5391261,4,B00A705E7C,"I watched this flick on Netflix and was amazed at how good it is and had to own it.
It is a very good movie dealing with crime and adult relationships.
The movie has enough twists and turns to keep one engrossed throughout the movie.",1364169600,,233,4.2
5391262,5,B00A705E7C,"Just wow. This movie is a masterpiece.

(Spoilers) I have never seen a film that tackled sexuality like this one has. A perfect blend of love, forbiddance, sex, mystery, drama, and murder all in one with a dark twisted undertone. This movie at the beginning is a murder mystery, but builds to be one of the best movies of 2012 - and believe me I have seen a LOT of movies in 2012 -  The King's Speech, Lincoln, Safety Not Guaranteed, Wreck-it Ralph, Dark Knight Rises. I actually could not control my emotions at the end because I, for one, finally understood all the ridicule and torment that homosexuals have to go through. (super spoiler alert) That a person would have to change his sexuality just to be with the person he loved, because society forbid it so much - could anything else be more of a testament to love? Could anyone out there say ""I think I have found my soul mate"" and simply let go? I found myself, a straight male, identifying with the pain and the anguish of the gay characters in the film, in not just one of the best love/drama/mystery films of 2012, but a masterpiece that forced a change in my perspective.",1357603200,9,1133,4.4423076923076925
5391263,4,B00A705E7C,You have to stay with the plot in the beginning. It is tragic so bewarned as well as unpredictable. The film is well done and very realistic. I don't like bloody scenes so it was hard to see them. You get to understand the charcters well and find that there is motivation for each action. It is not a movie that I will watch again but I can recommend this to those who like mysteries. The Korean culture attitude towards the gays is harsh. I do have to say that the actors did an amazing job in this film as well as the director.,1399766400,2,529,4.096153846153846
5391264,1,B00A705E7C,I think it was about a gay guy and his macho cop lover but I don't know what they were so upset about - life maybe,1393632000,,114,3.423076923076923
5391265,5,B00A705E7C,"Compelling combination of mystery thriller, action and violence.  This movie operates on many levels from the basic detective story plot to psychological thriller to romance to the classic revenge genre.",1386720000,3,203,5.766666666666667
5391266,5,B00A705E7C,"This movie started out as your usual murder mystery. It then slowly begins to morph in to a tale of forbidden sexual inclinations, guilt-trips and cover-ups. This film had so many twists that I didn't really understand everything until the very last scene of the movie. I don't want to give any spoilers, but just be patient for the first few 20 minutes and you will begin to follow the unwinding strands of this intricate plot.",1373846400,3,428,4.644736842105263
5391267,2,B00A705E7C,"Watched about 45 minutes of this movie and decided to call it quits, finding it difficult to follow the characters. Better luck to you.",1373328000,,135,4.666666666666667
5391268,1,B00A705E7C,This movie begins with cheesy dialogue and a quite sad attempt by almost every character to be cool.  Unfortunately the script is so bad it plays like it was written by a teenager.  I couldn't finish it.,1372809600,,203,4.45945945945946
5391269,3,B00A705E7C,"My rating might be higher if I had watched it through. Work and outside intrest have kept me from watching the whole movie. It is a chic flik, be warned.",1372550400,,153,4.133333333333334
5391270,5,B00A705E7C,"Wonderful move that contains a sad love story and wraps it nicely in a murder mystery noir style.  I really enjoyed the love and regret this story portrays and the topic of forbidden love is handled in such a beautiful manner.

One of the better films I've seen in a long time and will probably watch this one again.",1372377600,3,316,4.338983050847458
5391271,4,B00A705E7C,wow....this movie took a turn that was completely unexpected. I'm still not 100% on what happens at the end! I think that is the beauty of films like this. It lets the viewer interpret the ending.,1371254400,3,196,4.472222222222222
5391272,5,B00A705E7C,"Except last useless scene, this movie deeply moves my heart. As a devoted and faithful Christian, I believe that among faith, hope and love, the greatest one is love. Two childhood friends suffered so much from their forbidden love. Although I am not a supporter of gay marriage, I cannot dishonor them. It was a true love. Since the movie 'Crying Game' had caught my eyes long time ago, this movie 'Rainbow Eyes' did great job in this kind of genre.",1369094400,4,450,4.567901234567901
8547411,4,B00A705E7C,"Great plot with a great topic, which is not often dealt in the Korean movie. But editing of the movie was horrible. This movie could have been a great one, but the director and his team spoiled the chance. Despite some problems, however, this movie is great to watch till the end.",1468022400,,280,4.403846153846154
8547412,5,B00A705E7C,"I haven't seen a bad Korean film through Asian Crush yet.  This was no exception.  I don't want to leave a long review but urge you to give it a shot.  I must say that the very very ending confused the hell out of me, though.  Not sure if it was just an accessory to the story or not...",1461628800,,286,3.7966101694915255
8547413,4,B00A705E7C,"I like watching Kim Kang-Woo and the female star, who played the transgender person. The story was a little dark, even if it was about love and the ending unhappy.",1461024000,,163,4.466666666666667
8547414,4,B00A705E7C,bestest.  motorcycle should made it to other side,1459209600,,49,5.125
8547415,3,B00A705E7C,Storyline too predictable.,1450310400,,26,8.0

8547418,5,B00A705E7C,"good movie.  it reminds me of a story where the tomb stone of a soldier says something to the effect, ""Got medal for killing men; got discharged for loving one.""",1436572800,,161,4.366666666666666
8547419,5,B00A705E7C,Where are the best films made today? Korea,1435968000,,42,4.375
8547420,5,B00A705E7C,This Korean crime drama has plenty of plot twists... Especially the ending! It had me fooled! The Korean market has so many awesome movies in different genres... this one certainly rates top of the list! Watch the last half hour VERY closely and the plot twists a couple more times! Did you guess who the murderer was...?,1422748800,,321,4.649122807017544
