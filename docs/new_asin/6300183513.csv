222892,5,6300183513,I first saw this film when I was seven; since that day I have seen it again and again - I think ten times - but the suspence is always at the top! In two words: exciting and elegant!,925516800,,182,3.6923076923076925

There is nowhere to hide when we get attacked in our wheelchair/theatre seat!

I was lucky enough to receive the VHS version as a gift 5 years ago, but my copy is starting to lose it's picture quality after to many viewings. I had heard  that they were rereleasing it too, but does anyone know when?? The visual  beauty of this film would be magnificent in the DVD format. Also, any added  materials as were in Vertigo would be fabulous. If anyone hears an exact  date of release- please post it here.",919555200,,483,4.274725274725275
222896,5,6300183513,"Alfred Hitchcock uses everything possible to make this movie the awesome, suspensful movie it is.  Don't run away from this one just because it's a classic, it is better than most thrillers today.  Don't be miss-lead by the  1998 re-make.
James Stewart plays a wheelchair bound photographer,  suffering from a broken leg. Subsequently he takes up the interesting habit  of watching his neighbors through his ""rear window"".  His  girlfriend, nurse, and old friend who is a detective, soon become involved,  when he suspects a salesman neighbor of murdering his own, invalid wife,  one night!",915148800,3,590,5.191489361702128

How ethical is it to spy on someone because you think they ""might"" have done a crime?  Questions which still hold true today!  James Stewart is  outstanding.  Grace Kelly is very good as well.  There is a bit of a disconnect due to their age difference which was common in movies in the 1950's.  Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey and Raymond Burr are great in their supporting roles.",1520208000,,534,4.78021978021978

223334,3,6300183513,"""Rear Window"" is a good film, but it is not a great one. It is technically brilliant, like most of Hitchcock's most acclaimed films, but it has one overriding problem that is simply too glaring to be ignored. As Dan Schneider writes in his own review of the film, it simply isn't plausible that a man would murder his wife and cut up her body all in front of a window. Hitchcock is certainly considered one of the greatest directors, but as an overall artist, he is rightly looked down upon when compared with true cinematic geniuses like Ingmar Bergman and Stanley Kubrick, and his absurd plots are one reason why.",1501891200,,615,4.54954954954955

Not every actor/actress could pull off this role because he literally sits around the entire movie and has to keep your attention throughout...and he definitely does!

223542,5,6300183513,"Five MYSTERIOUS Stars. Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" is one of the all-time classic suspense movies, has an excellent cast, and is based on the short story by Cornell Woolrich. The movie may come as a surprise to some in terms of the overall movie set, the odd plot development, and how the cast is deployed throughout. In the plot, Jimmy Stewart's character is convalescing at home and gets to know some things about his neighbors from looking out his rear window, becoming very concerned about certain activities. Starring a marvelous cast of James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Wendell Corey, Thelma Ritter, Raymond Burr, Judith Evelyn, Ross Bagdasarian (David Seville, the Alvin and the Chipmunks creator), Georgine Darcy, Sara Berner, and more, plus the voice of Gig Young. Musical score by Franz Waxman. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Contains some rather shocking and breath-taking moments. My Highest Recommendation. Five CURIOUS Stars. (Universal pictures.

Second, if you are planning to murder someone, think of the nosy neighbors with binoculars or telephoto lens.  Third, thank your lucky stars your nosy neighbor wasn't photographing evidence, he was just aimlessly speculating.
Ive often wondered why Jefferies (James Stewart), a famed photographer and risk taker (hence the broken leg), didn't put film in his camera.  He only used the camera as a means of spying on the neighbor/suspect.  But then this was the idiot considering dumping his girlfriend (Grace Kelly as Lisa) simply because she was too perfect!  The only one with any sense in that apartment was the incomparable Thelma Ritter as Stella, an insurance companys nurse.  She noticed a woman about to commit suicide and brought it to Jefferies attention only to have him ignore it.  Jefferies was not a sterling character, nor was he a hero.  It was one thing for him to take risks with his life, quite another to risk someone elses life in the pursuit of his theory.",1490832000,,1130,4.84375

223734,5,6300183513,"Rear Window is one of my favorite Hitchcock films, not because of the suspense factor but because of the casting. James Stewart plays the crippled L.B. Jefferies- a photographer who had an accident and broke his leg. Wheelchair bound Jefferies has nothing to do in his small Manhattan apartment but look out on the courtyard of his complex and observe what's going on with all of the neighbors. This harmless snooping to pass the time suddenly takes a dangerous turn when, he notices that in the apartment across the way- the wife who is an actual bed ridden invalid- disappears. The husband's (Raymond Burr) suspicious movements in and out in all hours of the night get him thinking. With his high society girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), care taker Stella (Thelma Ritter) he sets out to find out the answer to this mystery. With the whole screenplay taking place from the same set inside the apartment- Rear Window is no bore!

It's where voyeurism comes to you and where you, in return, get caught up in events, or I should say, the lead character L.B. Jeffries gets caught up.  I don't want to compete with the volume of analysis that this film has garnered, except to say that it has a choreographed precision to it that is clearly the hand of Hitchcock weaving the plotlines together.  Rear Window is rich in statements of isolation and crime; voyeurism and immersion into the clockwork grind of daily life from a single perspective.  From the benign to murder.  It has a murder mystery plot but its also very inventive and wry.",1484265600,,718,4.6141732283464565

I really liked the way the movie was set, wit the different neighbors and the different scenarios per each one. Even though it was a mystery movie, I wish it had more suspense to it and more drama. But overall it was ok...the ending was a bit rash and quick. The suspect just opens the door and lets himself in.,,,didn't the lead male actor lock his doors???

But then you throw in the beautiful and elegant Grace Kelly and wow what a mix. I love this movie about a man who is laid up in his apartment on the mend from a broken leg who becomes a voyeur in his boredom. In watching the neighbors in the building across from his own apartment he unwittingly becomes a witness to a murder. Being the kind of man he is, he can't control his detective skills as he tries to piece together what really happened to the wife of the man living across from him. It really becomes a nail biter when he gets his beautiful lady friend, (Grace Kelly) involved. Watch as they try to catch a killer without becoming his next victims.",1476403200,5,776,4.214765100671141

Hitchcock shows the actor(s) in a close up, he cuts to what they are looking at and cuts back to the actor(s) to get their reaction to what they have seen. Cinema 101.

Very entertaining with great actors and very witty dialog.  I always marvel at how far Hitchcock pushed the censors in his films.

Unfortunately my BD player (a brand new Samsung also bought at Amazon) says disc error again, so now I will once again start the return process in the hopes that one disc one day will indeed play!

I don't regard ""Rear Window"" as the peak of the director's career but it has entertaining performances and some genuine suspense at the end.
I did not find the Kelly-Stewart romance very credible but that is often the case  with popular culture; characters are paired for their amusing opposite values without the audience understanding how they would ever be interested in one another in the first place.
AS usual, Hitch gets great performences from the minor characters such as Thelma Ritter.",1456963200,2,708,5.042735042735043

The whole story takes place in one man's apartment and apartment complex, yet it's interesting as Jimmy Stewart's character observes all the drama and humor in his neighbors' everyday lives, which is very easy because the apartments all face towards an inside courtyard, and it's during a summer heatwave, so everybody's windows (and lives) are wide open for observation.  Then when a neighbor's wife mysteriously disappears after Stewart's character hears a scream in the night and observes unusual behavior from the husband, Stewart and his girlfriend Lisa, played by the ever-beautiful and elegant Grace Kelly, take it upon themselves to prove to Stewart's skeptical police detective friend that the neighbor (played by Raymond Burr) murdered his wife and disposed of her body.  Thelma Ritter is delightful as Stewart's home healthcare nurse and adds humor to the story.  No gore or graphic violence -- just suggestion and suspense.",1456617600,,988,5.354838709677419

224655,5,6300183513,"L.B. Jeffries, renowned action photographer, had a run-in with a crashing racecar. It left him with a broken leg and a convalescence that is driving him crazy with boredom. He's stuck in his Greenwich Village apartment during a summer heat wave with his leg itching and nothing to do but watch his courtyard neighbors. This is made easier because it's the 1950's and no one has air-conditioning. Instead, everyone has their windows wide open trying to beat the heat. Everyone but the newlyweds.

Because he's stuck in one place, Jeffries is seeing more than usual of Lisa, his gorgeous, elegant, intelligent girlfriend. She doesn't pressure him, but she would not be averse to marriage planning. Jefferies, however, knows that she could never fit in with his rough and tumble traveling.

But then, Jeffries thinks he sees murder across the courtyard. He is surprised and impressed when Lisa joins him in trying to unmask a murderer. Humor, romance and murder  what else could I ask for in a movie?

This is a great movie, and, as I learned in Bonus Extra 1, it was very close to being lost forever. This was the 2nd of 4 times Jimmy Stewart starred for Hitchcock, and, as in ""Vertigo"" (their 4th movie together) his character is an ambiguous hero. He spies on his neighbors out of boredom, which I don't consider a virtue.

""Rear Window"" is available in more than one edition. This is a review of Universal's ""Alfred Hitchcock Collection"" also called the ""Collector's Edition"" (the latter written in a gold band at the top of the DVD case). The movie has been lovingly restored in picture in sound quality. In addition, it has 73 minutes of Bonus Features, including some commentary about how the restoration was done, and side-by-side photos of before-and-after scenes.

You can watch the movie in English and French. Captions for the Hearing Impaired are available in English and Spanish, and are available on the movie and the Bonus Features.

Bonuses:
....1.  ""Rear Window Ethics: Remembering and Restoring Hitchcock"" (55 minutes) This documentary was interesting. Commentators include Curtis Hanson (filmmaker), Peter Bogdanovich (filmmaker who was friends with Hitchcock), Alfred Hitchcock (from an older audio-only interview with Bogdanovich), Herb Steinberg (Paramount Publicity Director), Pat Hitchcock (Hitchcock's daughter), James C. Katz (film restorer), Herbert Coleman (assistant director on ""Rear Window""), Robin Wood (author ""Hitchcock Films Revisited""), Georgine Darcy (plays Miss Torso), Henry Bumstead (Paramount Art Director), Doc Erickson (unit production manager), Robert A. Harris (film restorer), Leonard Smith (camera operator), John Waxman (son of Franz Waxman, composer).
Lots of fun background detail. Bumstead says that the film's art director, Max Johnson, came to him for some ideas: ""He had to do this whole courtyard, and we didn't have stages that high. So I suggested to him  Paramount wasn't a large studio  but two or three of the stages, we stored furniture underneath. So I told Max, 'Why don't you cut the floor out?"" And that's what they did!
Darcy mentions later: ""It was a great set. People came from all over the world to view it and take pictures. I think it had been written up in 'Life' or 'Look"" magazine.""
....2.  ""A Conversation with Screenwriter John Michael Hayes"" (12 minutes) ""Hitchcock combined humor and suspense. I have a feeling that that's why Hitchcock selected me to do 'Rear Window'.... A lot of [Hayes' prior radio works] were tongue-in-cheek detective stories.""
....3.  Production Photographs (3 minutes)
....4.  Theatrical Trailer (3 minutes) This is a downright odd trailer. It goes through Jeffries' courtyard neighbors, going by their 'names', such as Miss Lonely Hearts, The Salesman, and The Composer: ""The songwriter who plays the same melody over and over again... a genius or insane?""

This is a fabulous movie. It hasn't staled for me at all.

224689,5,6300183513,"Rear Window is an suspense film directed by Alfred Hitchcock. It was written by John Michael Hayes that was based on Cornell Woolrich's 1942 short story ""It Had to Be Murder"".The film stars James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Wendell Corey, and Thelma Ritter.

Laid up with a broken leg, photojournalist L.B. Jeffries is confined to his tiny, sweltering courtyard apartment. To pass the time between visits from his nurse and his fashion model girlfriend Lisa, the binocular-wielding Jeffries stares through the rear window of his apartment at the goings-on in the other apartments around his courtyard. As he watches his neighbors, he assigns them such roles and character names as ""Miss Torso"",a professional dancer with a healthy social life or ""Miss Lonelyhearts"",a middle-aged woman who entertains nonexistent gentlemen callers. Of particular interest is seemingly mild-mannered traveling salesman Lars Thorwald, who is saddled with a nagging, invalid wife. One afternoon, Thorwald pulls down his window shade, and his wife's incessant bray comes to a sudden halt. Out of boredom, Jeffries casually concocts a scenario in which Thorwald has murdered his wife and disposed of the body in gruesome fashion. Trouble is, Jeffries' musings just might happen to be the truth.

Rear Window is arguably the second best film of Alfred Hitchcock next to Vertigo. The new-of-a-kind movie during its year of release makes a murder mystery tense as well as entertaining. In it,Hitchcock's genius delivers as one of the most elegant entertainments ever made in Hollywood, and also one of the boldest and most personal of the his films since it is a work that's almost perverse in its giddy celebration of the thrill of voyeurism.",1451088000,,1712,5.244525547445256

224692,5,6300183513,"I always love JImmy Stewart (in most movies) and the only Hitchcock I like better is ""North by Northwest"".  But ""Rear Window"" is a close second to me.  I love the idea that the main character is kept sitting and watches the lives of the people in the next building.  Most people do have interesting lives, though we each might not consider it so.  Also Grace Kelly does bring beauty and excitement when she gets into the killer's apartment.  Really suspenseful toward the end with the killer coming for Jimmy Stewart.",1450310400,,517,4.637362637362638

224942,5,6300183513,"Not having seen every film that Hitchcock made, and therefore not entirely qualified to analyze what makes a film ""his,"" REAR WINDOW is definitely getting closer to what my idea of the ideal Hitchcock film is. Like his other pictures, it takes a simple premise and puts the audience through the wringer as to how it will turn out. Here, James Stewart plays L.B. Jefferies, a wheelchair-bound photojournalist who passes the time by looking at his neighbors through the rear window of his apartment. However, based on some things he sees, he begins to think that a murder may have been committed. Having just come off of ROPE, where the film was edited to appear as one single take, I noticed another technical challenge with this. The entire view the audience is given is from Jeff's apartment, which essentially forces us into his perspective. We see exactly what he sees, and know what he knows (with a few exceptions). In the hands of a weaker director, having basically only one fully developed character would have resulted in a very weak film, but Hitchcock makes it work somehow. It also doesn't hurt that James Stewart has a likable screen presence. And boy, is Grace Kelly easy on the eyes (and a talented actress, too)! However, what made the film so much more interesting was the social commentary that Hitchcock flirted with for part of the running time. Most of it is contained in some first-half conversations between Jeff and his girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly). Although I could just be reading this onto the film, it seems like Jeff's apartment-bound snoop is a metaphor for society's growing passivity. This is kind of supported by the fact that he's averse to getting married, is content with the status quo, etc. This is in contrast to his girlfriend, who is more ambitious. It's almost tragically ironic that they end up bonding over a murder they think has been committed based on their limited point of view from Jeff's apartment. Also, given the interconnectedness that the internet provides, and the privacy concerns that come along with it, one could certainly read the ethics of surveillance onto the film as well. Even if that wasn't the intention (and Hitchcock's primary concern was entertainment), you can certainly see how the film was prescient in that regard. Just substitute the digital world for the apartment complex, where you think that you know people based on what they post on Facebook. If anything, you can take away that life is better experienced than merely observed. However, my only minor complaint has to do with the ending (again). Hitchcock is a master when it comes to building tension and suspense, but after so much cinematic foreplay there wasn't enough time to savor the release when it comes. I will say that Raymond Burr, even though you only got really one scene to appreciate his character up close, was quite menacing. There were also lots of cool little moments that you get to see as Jeff spies on his neighbors. And, I was able to catch Hitchcock's cameo this time! From my limited perspective of only having seen a handful of Hitchcock's films at this point, I can still safely say that this is the best so far. I also can't wait to dig further into to his filmography.",1439683200,,3232,4.793906810035843

What a let down. I had to stop watching it and then force myself to finish it was so boring. Jimmy Stewart was excellent as the voyeur trapped in a wheelchair with his broken leg propped up.
Grace Kelly was......Grace Kelly. She needs acting lessons and to lose that upper crust accent.
Thelma Ritter is a character actress I adore but even she could not save this movie.
Raymond Burr looked ridiculous with the white hair. They needed an older actor for the part.

This was one example of a great combination and Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint in North by Northwest was another and it goes on and on; Psycho, Birds . . .  .",1437955200,,776,4.105263157894737

There's a bit of a flutter when a visiting friend realizes that Grace Kelly has planned to stay overnight with Jimmy Stewart - present generations will not understand what all the fuss is about since now, not only do people sleep together but they film it on webcams and send it to their friends.  Speaking of fusses, Grace Kelly (Princess Grace of Monaco to the younger set) is incredibly gorgeous in this one; watching her you finally realize what all the fuss over her was about.  She manages to be beautiful and sexy without taking anything off (yes, folks, it can be done).  Chills and thrills and comedy thrown in.

By participating in the voyeuristic experiences of the main character, played by perennial favorite Jimmy Stewart, we all partake of the pure cinematic experience which is, indeed, representative of the world of cinema itself.  No spoiler alerts necessary here: suffice it to say that a snoopy photographer who is confined to his apartment uses his close-up camera lens in order to gaze into the world of his neighbors across the way, finding out many intimate details of their personal lives as well as suspicions about one neighbor in particular.  What you as a co-voyeur begin to suspect might be true turns into a hope that it is, since this would prove to be an interesting story indeed, if it were.  The horrible nature of what it is we as voyeurs hope to discover demonstrates the fact that human nature is often compelled by a darker side to take an interest in those things we would never want to happen in our own lives.",1425081600,,1005,4.693181818181818

225586,5,6300183513,"Yes it really is Among the Greatest Movies of All Time, and hard to commit to a genre.... mystery, comedy?
Watch closely, not only the main actors but the subtleties of the life size Diorama (which is an amazing structure as well and worth looking into on the web).
The music and background sounds are very subtle and perhaps many could watch the movie without noticing them but when tuned into them one hears so much.
The movie starts out with titles and credits and a most interesting music that we eventually discover is coming from a radio in the musicians studio apartment. He is annoyed later when the dancer is playing her music and he is trying to concentrate.
Of course the dancer is a pleasant sight for our hero, Jimmie Stewart who one could label a voyeur. My thoughts about this are that Hitchcock is doing it again, really pushing the censors buttons. Very hard to believe that this  movie was produced in those days, 1954.
I saw the movie in a movie house in Los Angeles back in 1964 (at the age of 15) and even then the dancer was shocking.
I got back into watching the old movies again in the late 1980s when VHS came out and have introduced it to many since then but it is amazing to get the reaction of the women when they see Grace Kelley in that first scene she is in which is filmed in such a way that makes her seem a bit cosmic, angelic, spiritual and Jimmie's attitude towards Her is one of both admiration and a need to bring her back down to Earth and humanize her and again Hitchcock implies that they sleep together although not married.
I suppose one can go away from the movie assuming that it is just about a murder but this incredible movie has way more to offer than the mystery and the Digital download had a high quality that makes one see the great detail in the movie set....",1417219200,16,1813,4.33235294117647

225589,5,6300183513,"One of my great heroes, Robert Capa, inspired one of my favorite movies, Rear Window.  This film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starred Jimmy Stewart -- two other heroes of mine.

Robert Capa was a Hungarian-born photographer who documented the Allied liberation of Western Europe in World War II.  He was fiercely anti-fascist, but also disdained socialism -- my kind of guy!  He took extraordinary risks as a war photographer.  His mantra was ""If you're pictures are no good, you're not close enough.""  He got closer than any other photographer on June 6, 1944.  Only eight out of the 100 or so shots that he took that day survived the developing process.  Those eight shots, however, are truly amazing.

On the day that Paris was liberated, August 25, 1944, Capa rode into the capital city ""on a tank made by the Americans who had accepted me, riding with the Spanish Republicans with whom I fought against fascism long years ago, I was returning to Paris-- the beautiful city where I first lean red to eat, drink and love.""  (Source: Slightly Out of Focus)

After the war he met and had an affair with the actress Ingrid Bergman who had been sent to Europe in 1945 to entertain the many American troops in the European Theatre of Operations.  Just after the war Alfred Hitchcock cast Bergman in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Notorious/dp/B001D8W7EK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Notorious</a>&nbsp;with Cary Grant.  Capa hung around the set where he became friends with the famous director.

Capa was totally committed to his trade as a photographer which meant that he had to be ready to travel on a moment's notice to war zones and other locations.  He could not commit himself to a traditional marriage with Bergman who also could not accompany him into dangerous war zones.

Hitchcock remembered these tales of the adventurous photographer and the glamorous beauty and incorporated them into his film Rear Window.  Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly starred in Rear Window which follows the adventures of a bed-ridden photographer (racing accident) who may or may not have witnessed a murder from outside the window of his NYC apartment.  Stewart had, like Capa, exposed himself to great danger in world War II piloting over 20 missions in a B-24.

The enormous bust of Hitchcock made by Antony Donaldson can be found in London's east end neighborhood of Hoxton.  Gainsborough studios was used by Alfred Hitchcock during his ""English"" period.  The statue is surrounded by apartment buildings which could easily provide a location for an updated remake of Rear Window.

Rear Window was released in 1954, the same year that Robert Capa stepped on a landmine and was killed in Vietnam.

Among the best overall of Hitchcock's films, it is rated #42 on AFI's ""100 Years, 100 Movies' and #14 on AFI's ""100 Years, 100 Thrills"" The film has also been added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress due to its cultural value. Among the many reasons I admire Hitchcock so much is his admiration and partnership w/Jimmy Stewart, one of my favorite actors. They teamed up for four thrillers...and they are all among the best of Hitchcock's (and Stewart's) films. They include ""Rope"", ""The Man Who Knew too Much"", ""Vertigo"" and this film. In this film, Stewart, playing a professional photographer, is wheelchair bound after being struck while photographing a racetrack accident. During a heatwave in Greenwich Village, NY, while everyone has their windows up because of the heat, he begins observing the people living in the apartments behind and around him. Assisted in his voyeurism by his love interest, Grace Kelly; and his physical therapist, Thelma Ritter, he scopes out an apparent domestic murder committed by a man named Thorwald (Raymond Burr) against his invalid wife. He brings a skeptical detective friend (Wendell Corey) in on the investigation; but the investigation appears to be getting nowhere, until a neighbor's dog is killed while digging in Thorwald's flower garden. If you like Hitchcock and Stewart, and/or Grace Kelly, you need to put this one on your must-see list. My highest recommendation!",1414972800,,1482,5.128099173553719

All he can do is sit inside with his leg propped up looking out with his huge camera lens (he's a photo journalist) onto the courtyard of his apartment building and into the windows of the one across from him.  Using his special lens he watches a young, curvy dancer, a lonely lady practicing for a hoped for date, a piano playing composer and others. One night he falls asleep and wakes up at the sound of a scream coming from one of the apartments across from him. The jewelry salesman, played by Raymond Burr (Perry Mason) is acting suspiciously and his bedridden wife has disappeared. Did he kill her? The beautifully, elegant Grace Kelly plays Stewart's girlfriend who wears high end fashion and has dinner brought to his apartment from one of the finest restaurants in the city! Even the handbag she brings to Stewart's apartment one night that turns into a suitcase with a negligee, robe and slippers is still talked about today! Watch as she helps Stewart solve the case. I also want to mention Thelma Ritter  who plays his nurse.  She is a great character actress whose comic, sarcastic wit is like a dash of curry powder in a stew.

Rear Window (1954) stars James Stewart and Grace Kelly, who seem to have good chemistry together. A bit slow out of the gate, this movie nonetheless picks up momentum and manages to thrill at the end. I found the setting to be refreshing (buildings with neighbors' every move bring watched), as it depicts a sort of closeness or community in an urban setting. This is not your usual Alfred Hitchcock thriller; it would be 5-10 years later that his movies took on a darker and more aggressive approach. The acting is superb in this movie, which makes up for some of the slow parts. Grace Kelly's role is unusually provocative and seductive- a rarity for the time period. I enjoyed this movie as one of boldness, great acting, and a good plot. This isn't my favorite Hitch movie (Vertigo is), but I endorse it.

Stewart's chief entertainment has been to spy on his neighbors out the window.  He does it so continually that Kelly and Ritter are drawn to join him at it.  There's a woman who lowers her little dog in a basket from the upper floor, so  he can roam the garden.  There's Miss Lonleyhearts, who appears so miserable.  There's the hottie who attracts all the hunks.  Then there's Raymond Burr, dark and heavy, and what? Did he just murder his wife?

226449,5,6300183513,"There are a small number of Alfred Hitchcock movies that are pretty close to perfect.... and ""Rear Window"" is one of them.

Rather than your typical action thriller, this movie is an oddly minimalistic production, almost like a stage play. And Hitchcock produces a stylish, minimalistic blend of mystery and dark comedy, a taut sense of suspense... and having a cast that includes Grace Kelly and James Stewart doesn't hurt either. Who knew that illegally spying on your neighbors could be so exciting?

After being run over during a photography shoot, L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries (Stewart) is forced to just sit around in his apartment, crankily waiting for his leg cast to come off. While he does so, he spies on his neighbors to stave off boredom -- some sleep on balconies, some argue, some weep alone, and some (""Miss Torso"") dance in spandex. To make things worse, Jeff is having intimacy problems with his wealthy girlfriend Lisa (Kelly), because he fears settling down, and thinks she's too ""good"" for him.

But then Jeff's window-watching clues him in to something -- sickly Mrs. Thorwald vanishes, and her husband Lars (Raymond Burr) is seen acting suspiciously with a saw, rope and metal case. Jeff becomes convinced that Thorwald has murdered his wife. He manages to convince Lisa and his down-to-earth nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) of what he's seen, but detectives won't believe him. So without moving from the room, Jeff uses the rear window to watch Thorwald -- and find out what really happened.

Okay, peeping on your neighbors is not just creepy, it's illegal. Don't do it. Ever. But in the case of ""Rear Window,"" that fact doesn't really matter. Watching the fellow tenants is as much fun as the mystery itself, whether it's the newlyweds, the pair that sleep on the balcony, the weepy Ms. Lonelyheart, or the buxom dancer Miss Torso. It makes the story even more chilling when you realize that one -- or maybe more than one -- of these seemingly harmless people is a murderer.

Hitchcock -- who appears as a musician -- kept his deft touch in a movie that could have sunk like a stone, mostly because of the restrictions that are put on the action. Almost everything important takes place in one room, but he keeps it from feeling confining. Instead, the minimalistic set takes away all distractions, and makes the interplay between the characters even brighter. And much of the humor is provided by Ritter -- she's not a comic character, but her homespun wisdom is delivered with tart humor.

Jeff is likable as very few actors (one of those being James Stewart) could make him -- this guy is bored, crabby and in denial about his feelings for Lisa, but he's likable despite having a lot of qualities that could make him intensely irritating. Kelly does an equally solid job as the ""girl who is too good for him,"" who also proves that in a pinch she can rise beyond her uptown-girl roots. Back when many women were relegated to side roles, Lisa gets to be an equal detective to Stewart.

""Rear Window"" gives a view into one of Hitchcock's best films, a taut thriller about how, if you watch other people, you might see something dangerous. A well-deserved classic.",1395532800,8,3178,4.777777777777778

226451,5,6300183513,"I love Hitchcock movies and Rear Window is most definately in my top 3. This is an amazing set up for suspense. Imagine that you're laid up in bed all day or in a wheel chair due to a broken leg. A caregiver comes in each day to help you out. You don't have a television. This is before internet, cell phones, and facebook. Nothing to do, except look out your back window to an open view of all your neighbor's apartments with nothing but a small courtyard between you and the building behind yours. You'd be surprised at all the tiny details you begin to notice in the everyday lives of your neighbors. Their habits, routines, schedules, comings and goings, arguments or parties that get too loud. And you begin to notice one particular apt. straight across from your own with a couple always arguing. Then, one day, you notice the wife is no longer there and the husband is cleaning the bathroom walls, wrapping knives in newspaper, rolling up the mattress, and tying up a large trunk. Could mean nothing. But when you're bored and have nothing else to do all day but jump to conclusions, only to be laughed at by your detective friend, then it's time to recruit your girlfriend and your caregiver to hear you out and listen to your theory of ""what happened to Mrs. Thorwall.""

Evidently not, because the Blu-ray Rear Window presents the original film without mucking it up at all. This film was MADE for Blu-ray, because every face, action, flower and brick on the set looks real and tangible. The water-color paintings in Raymond Burr's apartment aren't just there; they seem to pop out and scream, ""Look at me!""  No fooling. I was amazed at the cornucopia of detail I had missed by watching the normal DVD version. This just goes to prove that a movie studio CAN bring their film to Blu-ray with a ""true"" restoration, and keep it intact for those who love it. Disney Pictures could take a lesson here--but they probably won't. While they continue tampering with perfection, painting mustaches on the Mona Lisa, I will instead be collecting the Hitchcock films on Blu-ray, delighting in the untampered mastery which produced them.

Wendell Correy's character has the great line in the film about not looking into other people's lives, you might not like what you see.

Grace Kelly is magnificent as Lisa Fremont.  James Stewart is wonderful as well.  The suspense, and the fact that the film is viewed from the same point of view throughout is something that every movie buff needs to see.

You want to get a towel and wipe off the beads of sweat on James Stewart's head.  What was truly amazing is there is a scene in the movie where the actor Raymond Burr (suspected of killing his wife) is taking the jewelry out of her purse.  And you can see him pick up her wedding band - a perfect round wedding band and this is from the ""rear window"" of James Stewart's apartment.

Absolutely amazing.  I have about 100 blu ray dvd's and I don't think one matches the clarity of Rear Window.  The transfer is perfect and that is rare today.

Worth every penny as this is a ""play it again"" movie. And not to be forgotton is the beautiful Grace Kelly who appears more stunning if that is possible.

If you love this movie - don't hesitate to get the blu ray version.  You truly won't regret it.",1382400000,9,956,4.2032967032967035

'Jeff' Jeffries (James Stewart) is wheelchair bound and board. So for entertainment he gets out his high-powered binoculars to see with the neighbors across the courtyard that conveniently leaves their blinds open are up to. Naturally he must make up scenarios as to what it is he thinks he seeing. The shocker is he believes he spotted a neighbor Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) dispatching and disposing of his spouse. He adamantly tells his girlfriend and eventually the authorities. Naturally there is no forthcoming evidence despite the incessant snooping of his girlfriend Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly.)

Could be he was wrong in his assumption. Or will Lars get Jeff and the little dog too?

This is a typical Alfred Hitchcock movie. That this atypical, is not to say that it isn't great, and lots of fun to watch. We see more than our share of great actors including the Princess of Monaco when she was just Grace Kelly and Raymond Burr in one of his few dark character personas.",1380931200,,1141,5.0

Convinced that he has uncovered a murder, Stewart maintains his vigil with his society girlfriend (Grace Kelly) by his side. Hitchcock asks the viewer about the ethics of interpreting what goes on behind the closed doors of our neighbors, as his courtyard is an allegorical cross section of American society and mores during the 50s.",1380240000,,554,5.306818181818182

I believe that Hitchcock said, ""suspense is not when two people sit at a table with one or both knowing that there is a bomb underneath. Suspense is when is when the same two sit at the same table and neither know that a bomb is underneath. Only the audience watching the movie knows of the bomb.""

That same anticipation, that same terror is seen in James Stewart when he inadvertently reveals himself to Raymond Burr. James has been the audience (up to that point), but now Raymond knows. Both James and the movie viewer watch in the growing anticipation of the confrontation between James and Raymond. It is excruciatingly delicious.

227086,5,6300183513,"If there's anything Hitchcock is exceptional at, it's keeping each and every viewer at the edge of their seat. Rear window embodies that Hitchcock trademark beautifully. James Stewart plays Jeff, a photographer confined to a wheelchair after breaking his leg. Thelma Ritter plays his wry, helpful nurse, Stella, and Grace Kelly is stunning as Jeff's sophisticated, intelligent, graceful girlfriend Lisa. Bored by being in his apartment all the time while recuperating, he passes time by watching his neighbors: a dancer, a lonely woman, a newly married couple...and a salesman with a nagging, bedridden wife. The salesman is Lars Thorwald, played by the lumbering Raymond Burr. When his wife disappears, Jeff is convinced that Lars had something to do with her disappearance, and is convinced she has been murdered. Jeff must depend on the help of Lisa and Stella to prove Thorwald guilty of the crime. This film left me speechless. I've always loved Hitchcock, but this is by far my favorite. The entire movie takes place in a small apartment, helping the viewer to feel the same claustrophobic desperation James Stewarts character feels throughout the entire film. This is a must see for any Hitchcock fan; the tense fear in the film is powerful, yet it is softened by the tender serene beauty of Grace Kelly. By the middle of the film, I was completely still until the very end. That's how effective Hitchcock is, and it is such a tense power that cannot be explained until you view this film yourself.

Stewart is watching the ultimate reality show, right in his own backyard. Yes, this is an older movie and Hitchcock is probably better known to the younger viewers for Psycho and The Birds, but this is such a great, timeless masterpiece that is relevant today that I hope new generations watch this and appreciate it. It's a gem.",1373500800,,741,4.66412213740458
227134,5,6300183513,"IMO Aflred Hitchock was at his creative height during the 1950's and ""Rear Window"" is one of his best from that era. Jimmy Stewart is a professional photograper who is wheel chain ridden due to an accident while working at his profession, he lives in an apartment complex in which he can view the other tenants during an extremely hot New York city summer as all the tenants leaves the drapes/blinds open. Raymond Burr, as a tenant who lives directly accross from Stewarts apartment, has an ailing bedridden wife who suddenly goes away on a trip. Well Stewart has an idea that Burrs' wife has not gone on vacation and that she was murdered. Stewart girldfriend is played by Grace Kelly who is also at the height of her girly charms and is always enegantly dressed, he plays a high society fashion model in the film. I sure love 1950's womans fashion. Thelma Ritter plays Stewarts wise cracking nurse and Wendell Corey is a police detective friend of Stewart who is skeptical of his friends fears. 5 Stars - As I mentioned I adore 150's womans fashion and Grace in this film is amazing, not only in her looks,but the wardrobe that she wears is one that I would die for, especially in my salad days.",1373328000,,1197,4.546296296296297

227178,5,6300183513,"There are a number of qualities that make Rear Window one of the best films of all time. Set entirely in a single room facing out onto a courtyard, a photographer recuperating from injury and confined to a wheel chair spends his days observing his neighbors through their windows. His natural voyeurism becomes obsessive as he begins to draw conclusions about each of these people and give them nicknames ( Miss Lonely Heart...etc) based on what he sees through the window. Jimmy Stewart is fantastic in this role. His fashionable socialite girlfriend is played by the incredibly beautiful Grace Kelly , who is slowly drawn into his obsession that one of his neighbors is acting suspiciously and his wife is uncharacteristically missing. Suspicion and Suspense builds from there.
Hitchcock had tried something similar in his earlier film Rope, also set in a single setting and involving suspense around a murder. Here he succeeds in taking that concept and directing two incredible actors to create a film that deserves it's reputation and longevity. Rear Window doesn't feel dated and still has the quality to grip the viewer and maintain it's suspenseful quality even 60 years on.",1371859200,,1182,5.066666666666666

Jefferies (Stewart) is a professional photographer who is incapacitated in his flat with a broken leg. All he has to pass the time is watching the people across the courtyard. Although he very rarely interacts with them, he slowly begins to know them just by spectating. Pretty soon he realizes something is amiss when the annoying wife across the way is no where to be seen and her husband (Burr) is acting strangely. With help of his ravishingly beautiful girlfriend (Kelly), Jeffries tries to uncover the truth. Everything escalates when Lisa breaks into the man's apartment and it finally peaks in a climatic confrontation. In the end all is well and Jeffries realizes his true love.

227185,5,6300183513,"Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film Rear Window has been called a masterpiece but does it deserve that distinction? If so then why? In answer to the first question, in a word, yes. The film is as high cinema as a director can achieve and very brilliantly paints a picture out of each frame.

 As many have pointed out the film uses it's basic premise of a handicapped man's only connection to the world being through captivating beautiful girlfriend, Lisa, (played by the gorgeous Grace Kelly) landlady and detective as well as the neighbors around his apartment. This gives the audience the feeling of watching several different mini movies in one although the murder mystery takes the main portion of the film.

 The film also greatly uses Hitch's popular less is more style of suspenseful film making barely giving any information to indite the movie's antagonist as a killer despite his profile and the fact he has knives and a saw and a disappearing wife and gradually builds tension as more becomes unveiled. It also allows the characters to be meta participants in this situation letting them voice their opinions on what's happening like an audience would in a horror film.

 The film also greatly benefits from it's very jazzy and catchy pre Bernard Hermann soundtrack. The film is further enhanced by Hitch's masterful use of angles and lighting as well as his relationship with actor Jimmy Stewart and their proven symbiosis as an amazing actor/director team. All in all this film is a masterpiece and demonstrates the brilliance of a master of his craft.",1369180800,,1559,4.908745247148289

227226,5,6300183513,"Rear Window is my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie, and one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It is tied with Silver Linings Playbook as my 7th favorite film of all time. It is a total masterpiece of film making, and it is one that must have been amazing to make from a directors point of view. Hitchcock has had a lot of films that I would have loved to experience from his point of view, but if I could go back in time and be him for the making of one of his films I would choose Rear Window because it must have been fascinating for him. I think that because it was fascinating just to watch the movie, because it felt like you were really there. It felt like you were spying on all of the neighbors that he was spying on. That is why it is such a remarkable movie, because you feel like you are there, and because it is original as it gets. I imagine that Hitchcock must have felt like he was watching real people going through their lives in one room the entire time.

What is so remarkable about the film is how it all takes place in one mans apartment, and how you can only see inside of his home, and what he can see out of his rear window. The plot and character development is very unique and remarkable. A photographer with a broken leg cannot leave his apartment, and he must sit in a wheelchair and look out at the neighbors. Because of how hot it is nobody will close their windows so he can spy on everybody, and he gets to know all of his neighbors, and what they are up too. He even names certain people. There is one lady who he calls ""Mr.'s lonely heart"" because she is always pretending to have a man over and then starts to cry in the middle of it. There s also a ballet dancer who he spies on, who he calls ""Ms. Torso"". My favorite thing is the musician who lives up stairs. You hear his piano playing throughout the entire movie, and at one point Hitchcock makes a cameo and he is with the musician. He throws a party and you can tell he is trying to make it to the radio. There are newly weds who have moved next door, and there are also two people who sleep on the fire escape stairs. Somehow the neighbors who are innocent seam like something would happen to them. Hitchcock made the things with the neighbors suspenseful, and you will know what I mean by that when you see it. Well the film is really slow, so it can develop the relationships between characters, and the lives of his neighbors.

The man's name is L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart), and he is the peeping Tom who stares out the Rear Window all day. It starts off one the first day of his last week in a cast. He has a girlfriend named Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) who is beautiful, sophisticated, and a bit of a celebrity. He doesn't think that she is right for him, because her high-class sophisticated life doesn't blend with his working class life. He doesn't think she will be able to be with him for that reason. It is actually more of a thing where he doesn't think that he is good enough for her. The develop that more as the story goes, and I didn't pick up on how they developed it the first time I saw it.

He also has a nurse named Stella (Thelma Ritter) who comes in to take care of him everyday while he is recovering. He is so bored and all he can do is spy on the neighbors, and she makes fun of him for being a peeping tom. Lisa also makes fun of him for that, but she eventually begins to take an interest in the man that he is spying on and so does Stella.

The man they are spying on in particular is a man who looks like he probably just murdered his wife, and looks very suspicious. He makes several trips in the middle of the night with a briefcase, and is using things like saws. All of this is causing Jeffries to get very suspicious, and he even contacts the police, but the won't do anything because that isn't convincing or good enough to get a warrant.

The thing about the film is that you know the guy killed his wife, so the suspense isn't who did it, did he do it. It is how are they going to prove this, and how will it end. The ending is unpredictable until you get to it, and the suspense at the end is crazy, and tremendous. The first hour and twenty minutes were good, and interesting but the rets of the film is crazy and awesome. That is why I love the film so much. It is so fascinating. It is also beautiful and peaceful at first. The neighborhood is very nice and peaceful, and it is beautiful at sunset and at night. The film makes me feel happy, at peace, and it puts me on the edge of my seat. It is my favorite Alfred Hitchcock film, and I love a lot of his films so that says a lot. What a genius, and I think that this film really shows how he was the master of suspense. The ending of the film was probably one of the most suspenseful, and on the edge of your seat endings of all time. Such a phenomenal movie. The only two Hitchcock films that challenged this one for being my favorite were ""North By Northwest,"" and ""Psycho."" But they are entirely different. Also his best films always have James Stewart in them. Well the best ones usually either have James Stewart, Cary Grant, or Grace Kelly in them, so if you want to get into Hitchcock know that the ones you should watch always have one of those actors in it. There are only a few of his absolute most amazing films that don't have them in it like ""Psycho,"" ""The Birds,"" and ""Strangers On A Train.""

He was really good at having people in one small setting for the entire film. He did that with ""Rope,"" and ""Lifeboat."" But he perfected the idea of having an entire movie in only one place with this film.",1364947200,,5604,4.146139705882353

While Ms. Kelly pouts over Stewart's lack of interest & as she struts about as if on a Seventh Avenue runway (I kept waiting for her to give the price of the ensemble she was wearing, as they use to do at store fashion shows years ago!!), it's Ms. Ritter who adds some balls to the script.  Admit it; Thelma Ritter was a great actress!!!  Ms. Kelly was an incredible mannequin!!  A Philadelphia bricklayer's daughter, to be sure!!  Anyway, the movie is a success at making you tense up & keeping you ""in"" the story!  No one did that better than Hitchcock!

227325,5,6300183513,"Rear Window is this reviewer's favorite Hitchcock movie.  It shows a man of action and adventure L. B. Jefferies (Jimmy Stewart) laid low by an accident (the movie implies an incident at a racetrack) and confined to a wheel chair and a cast.  Jefferies has been so confined for some time and is only a week away from getting the cast cut off.  Bored, hot and chafing under his plaster fetters, Jefferies begins to spy on his neighbors.

Jefferies' neighborhood is one that simply invites a voyeur.  He simply looks out the rear window across a quadrangle lot into the windows and lives of perfect strangers.  One is a lonely woman, another a frustrated songwriter, a retired couple and their dog, newlyweds, a sculptor, a dancer, and finally a traveling salesman who has a nagging, invalid of a wife.

Our voyeur can only surmise the private going-ons of his subjects, but he studies them intensely.  The audience is also drawn to his watching, and with Jefferies, they draw the same conclusions.

Jefferies focused observations of his neighbors is contrasted by his lack of introspection.  He is desperately courted by Lisa, played by none other than Grace Kelly but he is unable to commit to such a woman.  Instead he pushes her away.

One evening something happens that make him suspect that there has been a murder-and the hitherto beached man of action rapidly starts to search for clues and bring others into his project of bringing the suspect, Lars Thorvald (Raymond Burr) to justice.  As the movie progresses the people Jefferies watches begin to have intensifying personal troubles that parallel Jefferies troubles in search for the truth.  In an ironic twist, Jefferies feelings for Lisa only surface when he sees her through the Rear Window.

The movie is packed with a tremendous sense of danger, sexual tension, and gore of murder but these things are subtly hinted at and are carefully wrapped in a movie set of artistic beauty.  In different viewings this movie's thick detail can be enjoyed differently each time.  The first time you watch, the suspense is overwhelming, the second Jefferies bone-headed stubbornness can only be marveled at, finally you can feel sympathy for Thorvald-who almost brakes free from a terrible, grating burden only to be stopped by a man of action in a wheel chair.",1361923200,3,2312,4.902313624678663

I've been a fan of Hitchcock since I was very young, but for some reason I had limited myself (consciously or not?) to the short films and television episodes.  Rear Window is the first of Hitchcock's full-length feature films that I've seen, and I will definitely be back for more.  Jimmy Stewart is at his best & Grace Kelly is absolutely stunning.  It's odd to see a woman in an active role, considering Hitchcock's leading ladies tend to be victims.  That's just one of the reasons Rear Window is so impressive.  It's a film about films and about film watching - the protagonist is a voyeur and we are all voyeuristically watching his experiences.  We align ourselves with him, but the disturbing feeling we get isn't so much from the antagonist (a murderer, possibly?) but from the sense of identifying with a ""hero"" who is immoble and impotent.  It's an uncomfortable place to be, particularly as Hitchcock assumed his audience to be male.  Feminists and film theorists, of course, have much to say about this film - and for good reason!

227575,5,6300183513,"194us Rear window (Alfred Hitchcock, 1954, 112')

Written by John Michael Hayes (with whom there is a delightful interview in the features of the dvd, and who won a 1955 Edgar Award for Best Motion Picture), based on Cornell Woolrich's 1942 short story ""It Had to Be Murder"". Originally released by Paramount Pictures, the film stars James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Wendell Corey, Thelma Ritter and Raymond Burr. It was screened at the 1954 Venice Film Festival. The film is considered by many filmgoers, critics and scholars to be one of Hitchcock's best.

After breaking his leg during a dangerous assignment, professional photographer L B ""Jeff"" Jeffries (Stewart) is confined in his Greenwich Village apartment, using a wheelchair while he recuperates. His rear window looks out onto a small courtyard and several other apartments. During a summer heat wave, he passes the time by watching his neighbors, who keep their windows open to stay cool. They include a dancer (""Miss Torso"", played by Georgine Darcy), a lonely woman (""Miss Lonelyheart""), a songwriter, several married couples, a middle-aged sculptor, and Lars Thorwald (Burr), a wholesale jewelry salesman with a bedridden wife.

Jeff discusses his observations with his wealthy socialite girlfriend Lisa Fremont (Kelly) and his insurance company home-care nurse Stella (Ritter), and becomes obsessed with their theory that Thorwald murdered his wife. He explains their theory to his friend Tom Doyle (Corey), a New York City Police detective, who looks into the situation but finds nothing suspicious. A few days later, the heat has lifted. The lonely neighbor woman chats with the songwriter in his apartment, the dancer's lover returns home from the army, the couple whose dog was killed have a new dog, and the newly married couple are bickering.

In the last scene of the film, Lisa reclines beside Jeff, appearing to read a book on foreign travel in order to please him, but as soon as he is asleep, she puts the book down and happily opens a fashion magazine. The film received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics and is considered one of Hitchcock's finest films.

Time called it ""just possibly the second most entertaining picture (after The 39 Steps) ever made by Alfred Hitchcock"" and a film in which there is ""never an instant ... when Director Hitchcock is not in minute and masterly control of his material."" The same review did note ""occasional studied lapses of taste and, more important, the eerie sense a Hitchcock audience has of reacting in a manner so carefully foreseen as to seem practically foreordained.""

Franois Truffaut in the Cahiers du cin&eacute;ma in 1954 centers on the relationship between Jeff and the other side of the apartment block, seeing it as a symbolic relationship between spectator and screen. Film theorist Mary Ann Doane has made the argument that Jeff, representing the audience, becomes obsessed with the screen, where a collection of storylines are played out. This line of analysis has often followed a feminist approach to interpreting the film.

In his book, Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"", John Belton addresses the underlying issues of voyeurism, scopophilia, patriarchy and feminism that are evident in the film. He quotes ""Rear Window's story is ""about"" spectacle; it explores the fascination with looking and the attraction of that which is being looked at."" Generally, Belton's book asserts that there is more to Hitchcock's thriller than what initially meets the eye. These issues that society faces today are all more than just present in the film, they are emphasized and strengthened.

Hitchcock uses sound to convey the thematic elements behind Jeff's behavior and the audience's relationship to his subjective point of view. The music in Rear Window is entirely diegetic, and therefore every character in the courtyard hears the sound and acts based on what they hear. Hitchcock is less interested in reality than in how reality is perceived. Thus his use of entirely diegetic sound illustrates the idea that what we see as the audience is real.

194us - Rear window (Alfred Hitchcock, 1954, 112') -Rare view - 10/10/2012",1349827200,,4157,5.174107142857143
227576,5,6300183513,"Alfred Hitchcock had a unique style and his films are readily identifiable. High on the list is 'Rear Window', which contains several of Hitchcock's trademarks.

First on the list is that Hitchcock's approach to mystery thrillers is quite different to most writers and filmmakers (to those who say that Hitchcock didn't write his movies, I can only say that a military commander doesn't fight his battles, but he controls those who do!). Usually in other people's mysteries a cast of characters is paraded in front of the viewer and the game is to guess which one is the murderer. In Hitchcock's films, it's pretty obvious who the murderer is, the question is how to pin the crime on them- preferably before they do it again. In 'Rear Window' Hitchcock plays up this aspect of the movie to its utmost, giving the lead male character a handicap which means that he can't do anything himself and has to act through others. Hitch builds the tension to an edge-of-the seat climax, in which both male and female leads are in mortal danger. Do they survive? Watch and find out.

Then there's the claustrophobic setting. Many of Hitchcock's movies are developed from plays, but even when they aren't ('Rear Window' was developed from a short story), he tends to eschew large-scale settings and has the action take place in confined (literally in this case) quarters. This adds to the tension; anyone who has had a nightmare in which it seems impossible to escape a terrifying situation will know the feeling of paralysing fear that is induced and Hitchcock creates that feeling better than any other filmmaker. Much of this movie takes place within a single room, with the world outside observed as though it were on TV. When the TV world intrudes on the lives of the lead characters, they can't escape.

Hitchcock liked to work with actors (and crew) with whom he felt comfortable and this movie contains a number of Hitch stalwarts, most notably James Stewart and Grace Kelly in the leading roles. They interpret their characters splendidly and are backed up by the feisty Thelma Ritter, adding light relief. There is also a group of characters whose job is create atmosphere by being observed going about their daily business and Hitchcock makes sure their stories, comical, tragic and sometimes embarrassing, are entertaining enough to make watching them seem a justifiable pastime.

Hitchcock's films are always worth watching for entertainment, but the more you see them, the more you appreciate the technique of one of the cinema's greatest storytellers.",1349222400,,2554,4.960280373831775
227577,4,6300183513,"This thriller takes place almost entirely in one room of a Greenwich Village apartment where photographer L.B. Jefferies (James Stewart) is confined to a wheelchair with a broken leg. The only change of scene is provided by the views that Jefferies has of the apartments opposite. The film was made in 1954 and was directed by Alfred Hitchcock.

Jefferies suspects that one of the tenants opposite, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), has done away with his nagging wife. At first, his girl-friend Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) and his home-help nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) think he's imagining it - just bored by his inactivity. But soon the pair become convinced that he might be onto something - no doubt looking for a little excitement themselves. The local detective that Jefferies phones, Tom Doyle (Wendell Corey), who is a friend of his, takes a great deal more convincing that something is amiss.

The excitement in the movie arises from the attempts of the trio (Jefferies, Lisa and Stella) to get more convincing evidence, and Thorwald's response to the confrointation. Despite the monotony of the surroundings, reflecting perfectly Jefferies' boredom, the plot is quite gripping.",1348876800,,1183,5.18848167539267

227625,5,6300183513,"This terrific classic focusing on our fear of intimacy and tendency toward voyeurism is one of Hitchcock's most entertaining films. There are no crop dusters or other devices to provide the tension this time and it works in the film's favor. Rear Window is a more character-driven film and the suspense builds slowly into a bonafide thriller. Hitchcock understood that most people are more comfortable looking at the lives of others from a distance and explores this area of our personalities in a very enjoyable fashion.

Jeff (Jimmy Stewart) is a professional photographer wheelchair bound after an accident while on assignment. Grace Kelly is his  icily beautiful and doting girlfriend, Lisa. Jeff is feeling claustrophobic, not only about his immobility but about his relationship with Lisa, whose patience and elegant charm as she tends to his needs and waits for him to ask her to marry him are put to the test. The no-nonsense practicality of his nurse Stella, winningly portrayed by Thelma Ritter, makes a fine contrast to Kelly. Jeff, stationary and bored to tears, begins secretly watching his neighbors across the courtyard through the lens of his camera, becoming involved in their plight as if following a daily soap opera; taking to heart their loneliness and finding great pleasure in their finer moments. But something darker begins to take shape when Jeff pieces together witnessed events in one of the apartments across the courtyard and comes to believe he is spying on a killer.

Both Lisa and Jeff's policeman pal Lt. Doyle (Wendell Corey) think someone is letting their imagination run wild, at least in the beginning. Jeff's own disbelief and his girlfriend's early scorn begin to wane, morphing into an evermore dangerous pastime when Lisa becomes Jeff's legs. But the man who may have murdered his wife begins suspect that Jeff has seen too much, putting both their lives in danger. Hitchcock is marvelous here, using his own lens to show the voyeuristic inclination of us all, as Jeff's seemingly innocent means of passing the time from afar threatens to turn into a personal confrontation which he may not survive. Hitchcock deftly takes the viewer from a light and breezy beginning to a more concerned tone, until there is near panic, chiefly because we are all a bit voyeuristic, and can easily put ourselves in Jeff's situation.

Like most of Hitchcock's films in Hollywood, it is a bit detached, but less so than others during this period, marking this as one of his finest. Raymond Burr as the possible murderer creates terror just by his glance across the courtyard at the spying Stewart, while Kelly and Ritter give this film its footing, making the events completely believable. Jimmy Stewart gives one of his finest performances, marvelously conveying the frustration of becoming suddenly immobile, which leads him to live vicariously through his neighbors' lives. A terrific film classic, perfect for a dark and stormy night with a big bowl of popcorn.",1342656000,2,2989,5.056795131845842

227632,5,6300183513,"If you watch Hitchcock's Rear Window, you may be deceived into thinking that not much thought went into it.  It's so seamless, you can't see how clever it is.  There are two sets, and they blend into each other.  The whole shebang - Jeff's apartment, the courtyard, and the other apartments the main characters can see into - was filmed on a big soundstage.  The sounds and music in the movie are ambient, what you would naturally hear if you lived in one of those apartments.  This enhances the reality of the setting, and puts the characters and story in the forefront.  We're really there with Jeff, a world-traveling photographer who's laid up with a broken leg and going stir crazy.  That's why we're able to see, almost from the beginning, that things are not what they seem.

The screenplay is based on Cornell Woolrich's short story, ""It Had To Be Murder.""  Woolrich was one of the best American short story writers of the 20th Century, a master of suspense.  John Michael Hayes' adaptation is perfect, and I suspect it was shaped as much by the cast as it was by the necessities of the movie medium.  Grace Kelly owns the role of Lisa - I think it's her best role ever.  She's so believable, you know she lives beyond the story, having adventures well into her 90s.

Jimmy Stewart made several great movies with Alfred Hitchcock, including Vertigo, an almost-perfect movie.  Vertigo is marred by an info-dump scene in which Kim Novak's character writes a letter explaining a plot point.  The studio insisted this was necessary, because the executives who saw the first screening were too dumb to figure out what was going on.  If Hitchcock could have lived long enough to see the ""Director's Cut"" videos that have since become the norm, I'm sure he would have insisted on releasing a version without that dopey letter scene in it.

Fortunately, Rear Window made it to the final cut without that sort of tampering.  Complementing Kelly and Stewart is a cast of veteran character actors.  Thelma Ritter shines as the visiting nurse, Wendell Corey makes you believe he's a police detective who also fought in WWII.  The actors who play the neighbors whose antics are so fascinating really seem to be living the lives of those people.  And Raymond Burr is one of the scariest movie killers I've ever seen.

Though Burr is a big guy, he's not an ax-wielding, snarling, macho kind of killer.  He's clever, quiet, and sneaky.  You don't get a hint of the violence he's capable of until someone actually confronts him.  Even then, you get the feeling he'd rather not mix it up with anyone, he just wants to get rid of the multiple packages that used to be his wife and get on with his new life.

Stewart's character is also not a macho guy, though he has a lot of courage.  He's never afraid to say what he thinks, but even if he didn't have a broken leg, you get the feeling Burr could have kicked his butt.  That's what makes the final confrontation between the two so suspenseful.

One terrifying moment that stands out in Aliens is the scene where the door to the freight elevator opens.  You suspect the Queen alien is crouched in that shadowy space, but you don't know for sure until you see the light glistening on those dreadful teeth.  In Rear Window, the cinematographer manages to achieve that effect with Raymond Burr's glasses as he steps into Jeff's darkened apartment.  Somehow, this nerd gear is transformed into something really creepy and threatening.  Burr manages to make the salesman sound both pathetic and dangerous when he demands to know who Jeff is and what he wants.

Rear Window doesn't have a formal score, unless you count the title sequence (""Juke Box #6""), a delightful crime-jazz piece written by Franz Waxman in the heyday of the great movie scores.  Otherwise, music plays on the radio, or is sung by drunken partygoers, or is tinkered together on a piano by a struggling songwriter in his rooftop studio.  The song he's working on eventually becomes an integral part of the plot, and by the end of the movie it's ""Lisa's Theme.""

The plot threads are woven into a satisfying conclusion, and Jeff and Lisa reach a believable accord in their relationship.  The ending of the movie is every bit as perfect as the beginning.  That's why Rear Window will always make my list of top ten greatest movies.",1338854400,4,4334,4.667546174142481

Stewart is an action photographer whose leg was broken in getting a special shot of a car race. He's in a cast, and bored to tears with nothing to do. So he looks out his rear window into all the other windows that face it. We get to follow quite a few sub-plot stories along with him in those rear windows. Because this is Hitchcock, several are pretty amusing.

Grace Kelly is in love with Stewart, but she's just ""too perfect."" She's a buyer for a top dress shop, or perhaps the dress department in a posh department store. Evidence: in 1954, the dress she's wearing is ""a steal"" at $1,700. That's at least $30,000 today.

He goes gallivanting all over the world to take pictures; she is strictly Park Avenue. She says she could get him great work doing portraits and fashion photography, but he hates the idea. What can they do?

They can turn amateur detective watching Raymond Burr apparently murder his wife and cut her up into pieces!!!

Of course, being a photographer and an outdoorsman, Stewart has binoculars and telephoto lenses. He also has a friend who is a detective. He tells his friend about his suspicions, and the friend is skeptical, but checks out the facts. It seems Burr has covered his tracks well enough that Stewart's friend decides there's been no murder. The wife just went on a visit in the country for her health.

Of course, there was a little more to it than that, such as Grace Kelly climbing fire escapes, the little dog sniffing the flower bed, the scenes in Jeff's apartment, and the final scene. But for the most part, that's all it was. And you know a movie is excellent when it keeps your attention for that long when it's simple dialogue, seemingly simple shots, and relatively few special effects.

Rear Window boasts a strong casting compliment, a solid story line, and a master director to make it all fly off the screen. From a short story of only thirty pages by Cornell Woolrich, the chill of murder was never colder.

Jimmy Stewart is convalescing and confined to a wheelchair. His girl friend (Grace Kelley) visits, sometimes cooks, sometimes has dinner sent in. Jimmy Stewart is a photographer and as such has a natural curiosity. The rear window of his apartment faces a courtyard and the rear windows of various other apartments. He knows just about all the neighbors by eavesdropping or peeping as it may be called. One day, he notices something very strange at Raymond Burr's apartment. The wife does not seem to be there anymore, the curtains drawn where they never were before, and Burr acting jumpy, making trips out of the apartment with a suitcase, clearing the way with suspicious eyes.

Well, there are the opening minutes and now, suspense is a sure thing.

227702,5,6300183513,"Rear Window, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, is well deserving of its #41 spot on the AFI top 100 listing. It is suspenseful and interesting even over 50 years later. It touches on issues we face in our current times. And, perhaps more amazingly, it manages to pass the Bechdel test, something that few AFI movies manage to do! It has two strong, named female characters who talk to each other about a topic other than men. Most movies fail this simple test. In Rear Window, Hitchcock provides equal strength and time to both the females and males in the story line.

Stewart is a photographer stuck in a wheelchair, resigned to peering out his windows at his neighbors. In our modern times this might seem a casual thing. Heck, we know the second-by-second details of our far off friends thanks to Twitter and Facebook. However, in the 50s this was considered less of a normal thing to do. He's even scolded by people around him for intruding on their privacy. Amazingly, we really do come to care about these people around him, even though they don't have names. The sad, lonely woman who eats alone and gets roughed up by a guy she brings home. The newlywed couple who goes from bliss to bickering. The loving couple with their cute little dog.

Even when Stewart gets concerned about an invalid wife who seems to go missing, he's still being caught up in all the dramas around him. The song-writing guy and his piano. The ballerina with her bevy of admirers. The whole courtyard is fascinating.

I love how Kelly shows her strength and surprises him with her independence. I also cringe when her quite astute observations are dismissed as ""women's intuition"" - as if they are not based on logic.

I do find the ending to be a bit contrived. The killer was an extremely logical, methodical man who planned out every last detail of what he was doing. He knew there were multiple people aware of what was going on. Why in the world would he try to kill just one of them? Surely that would prove beyond a shadow of a doubt his guilt? Why not take off to safety? To me that's the one false note in this story. They needed a more rational reason behind what he does at the end.

Still, a great story with a wealth of details. This demonstrates quite clearly the power of creating a rich atmosphere for a story. So many other movies have throwaway background characters who have little to distinguish them. Here we have a rich array of characters who we really care about - and when the ballerina's ""not a GQ model"" boyfriend comes home to her, and she clearly adores him, it's richly fulfilling.

227704,5,6300183513,"I rank this among some of the best Hitchcock films (Vertigo, Lady Vanishes, Rebecca), though it's a slightly different feel than many of his other films.

Basically Jimmy Stewart is holed up in his apartment with a broken leg.  He is a professional photographer, so he likes to look at things.  In the course of staring out at the neighbors from his window, he believes he witnesses a murder.  He enlists the help of a detective friend, his visiting nurse, and his girlfriend.

Like Lady Vanishes, the viewer is not really given any real clues if there was even a crime, or what happened.  So the viewer is not really given any privy information.  We follow along as a casual observer, given only the same amount of information as Jimmy Stewart has.

It's an interesting film that is not only about a possible homicide, but it's about the neighbors and their seemingly ordinary lives.  Though we don't really see any interaction between the main characters and the neighbors, we get to know the neighbors, as Jimmy Stewart does, by viewing them through their windows.

It's a wonderful and original film that is beautifully shot and well acted.  Jimmy Stewart is amazing as usual and Grace Kelly lives up to her name (Grace-fully).

A great film, top notch!  The restoration is good, but I would have liked some more extra features.  Perhaps one day Criterion will get their hands on this film and do a really A+ restoration with oodles of extras.

227706,5,6300183513,"Out of all of Alfred Hitchcock's movies, this is definitely my favorite next to a few others. This film sticks out so much because everything is perfect. The acting, the actors (James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey, Raymond Burr), the Edith Head costumes, the music, the sharp dialouge, the terrifying ending, and of course, suspense like no other. Everything about the film is absolutely perfect, and I think it's one of the greatest suspense films ever made. This movie is what Hitchcock would call ""pure cinema"".
  The film is about a photographer named L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries, who broke his leg in an accident and, while confined in his apartment, has nothing else to do but stare out his window and look into other people's apartment rooms. Later on, he suspects that his neighbor right in front of his apartment building, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), murdered his invalid wife. Grace Kelly plays his girlfriend, Lisa Carol Fremont, who helps Jeff investigate the murder, along with his homecare nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter), who provides the typical Hitchcock comic relief in the film. Wendell Corey plays Detective Tom Doyle, who is skeptical about the whole murder theory.
  This film has the perfect amount of suspense, and even though it takes place all in one room, it's still so suspenseful. It gradually builds up scene after scene all the way to the shattering conclusion, that you'll think about way after the movie is over. This is an ultimate Hitchcock masterpiece, along with some others, like ""Psycho"", ""Vertigo"", ""North by Northwest"", and ""The Birds"".
  The Universal Legacy Series edition of this film is absolutely phenomenal. The film does look pretty grainy, but other than that, it looks beautiful. The Disc 1 comes with the film (of course), a commentary by John Powell, production notes and photographs, along with the theatrical trailer and the re-release trailer. The Disc 2 comes with a 55 minute documentary ""Rear Window Ethics: An Original Documentary"". It talks about how the film was made, and it's extremely interesting. It also comes with a 15-20 minute interview, titled ""A Conversation With Screenwriter John Michael Hayes"", a very interesting 25 minute documentary about Hitchcock's films ""Pure Cinema: Through the Eyes of the Master"", with different directors talking about his films, a very similar 25 minute documentary about the music in Hitch's films, ""Breaking Barriers: The Sound of Hitchcock"", a 15-minute Hitchcock/Truffaut excerpt with Hitch talking about ""Rear Window"", alongside showing parts from the film and some photots, and it also comes with an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, titled ""Mr. Blanchard's Secret"", which has a very similar plot to ""Rear Window"" (somebody believing their next door neighbor is a spousal murderer.

227741,5,6300183513,"Alfred Hitchcock was in near-perfect form when he made ""Rear Window,"" a stylish, minimalistic blend of mystery and dark comedy. This thriller explores ""what you shouldn't see"" skilfully, with a few funny bits thrown in. And having a cast that includes Grace Kelly and James Stewart doesn't hurt either.

Photographer L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries (Stewart) got run over during a shoot, and is crankily waiting for his cast to come off. While he does so, he spies on his neighbors -- some sleep on balconies, some argue, some weep alone, and some (""Miss Torso"") dance in spandex. To make things worse, Jeff is having intimacy problems with his wealthy girlfriend Lisa (Kelly), because he fears settling down.

But then Jeff's window-watching clues him in to something -- sickly Mrs. Thorwald vanishes, and her husband Lars (Raymond Burr) is seen acting suspiciously with a saw, rope and metal case. Jeff becomes convinced that Thorwald has murdered his wife. He manages to convince Lisa and his down-to-earth nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter), but detectives won't believe him. So without moving from the room, Jeff uses the rear window to watch Thorwald -- and find out what really happened.

Okay, peeping on your neighbors is not just creepy, it's illegal. In the case of ""Rear Window,"" that fact doesn't really matter. Watching the fellow tenants is as much fun as the mystery itself, whether it's the newlyweds, the pair that sleep on the balcony, the weepy Ms. Lonelyheart, or the buxom dancer Miss Torso. It makes the story even more chilling when you realize that one -- or maybe more than one -- of these seemingly harmless people is a murderer.

Hitchcock -- who appears as a musician -- kept his deft touch in a movie that could have sunk like a stone. All the action takes place in one room, but he keeps it from feeling confining. Instead, the minimalistic set takes away all distractions, and makes the interplay between the characters even brighter. And much of the humor is provided by Ritter -- she's not a comic character, but her homespun wisdom is delivered with tart humor.

Jeff is likable as only James Stewart could make him -- this guy is bored, crabby and in denial about his feelings for Lisa, but he's likable despite that. Kelly does an equally solid job as the ""girl who is too good for him,"" who also proves that in a pinch she can rise beyond her uptown-girl roots. Back when many women were relegated to side roles, Lisa gets to be an equal detective to Stewart.

""Rear Window"" gives a view into one of Hitchcock's best films, a taut thriller about how, if you watch other people, you might see something dangerous. A well-deserved classic.",1305936000,,2658,4.77995642701525

227744,5,6300183513,"So much has been said about this movie already, what's one more long description of the plot going to do?  If you want to know the entire plot, read other reviews.  I just want to give my thoughts on this movie.

I find Rear Window (1954) to be entertaining, fun, suspenseful, and a little scary at times all rolled into one.  The biggest reason why I like this movie is because Grace Kelly is in it.  She was a looker and her performance in this movie was Oscar-worthy.  She plays the role of Lisa Carol Fremont, who is the girlfriend of L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries, played by Jimmy Stewart.  Stewart's performance was also great.  Grace Kelly reminds me so much of Nicole Kidman, or should I say that Nicole Kidman reminds me of Grace Kelly.  Kidman's overall look she had in The Others (2001) is so similar to Kelly's look in Rear Window, especially during the early part of Rear Window.  Kidman's character name coincidentally in The Others is Grace Stewart.

This movie takes place entirely in an apartment complex where the rear windows of all apartments are open and expose what is going on inside each apartment that overlooks a courtyard.  It's funny to watch Jimmy Stewart's character take part in voyeurism.  But his voyeurism pays off as he and several people are able to solve a murder that took place in an apartment across the courtyard.  The suspense builds as the movie progresses.

This DVD is in widescreen format.  The extras are excellent.  There is a documentary called Rear Window Ethics: Remembering and Restoring a Hitchcock Classic, which describes the making of the movie with interviews with cast and crew, Hitchcock himself through an audio interview, and Hitchcock's daughter.  It also shows how the movie was restored.  Also included is a featurette with screenwriter John Michael Hayes.  Other extras include production photographs, the theatrical trailer, a re-release trailer narrated by Jimmy Stewart, production notes, cast and filmmakers, and access to the original script.

Overall, this is one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movies.  I highly recommend it.",1295654400,2,2089,4.942528735632184
227745,5,6300183513,"Hitchcock is becoming a treasured family evening activity in our house.  We have more than a dozen of his films in our collection, which draw us in for a forget-the-world experience of suspense and drama.  OK, the characters are not necessarily all that deep, but there is a engaging quality to the films that is a magic all its own.

Because of the static setting of the film, this is one of the last ones we watched.  It starts slow, with a relationship that is fraught with tension:  Grace Kelly wants Jimmy Stewart, but he is holding back - because she is too perfect, he says, but also because he fears a basic incompatibility.  She is a fashion and social goddess, he a news mag photographer who is convalescing after an injury sustained by standing in the middle of a race track.  She wants him to stay in NYC and take up fashion photography, where they can go to the finest places, he doubts she would want to give up that world and travel to the jungles of Asia with him.  Kelly, who is absolutely stunning in her prime and reeks of NYC sophistication, is wooing him, the doubter, the pursued one.  With a hip cast, all he has to do is watch his neighbors, quite a roster of characters.

THere is Raymond Burr in an unhappy marriage, lonely women, and a newlywed couple, who are active behind closed shades all the time (though the new husband shows signs of reluctance and fatigue.)  It is a wonderful social observation of a happening neighborhood, The Village.  Soon, he observes what he thinks is strange, and has trouble convincing Kelly, a detective pal, and his nurse that something is really going on.  However, with so many signs, Kelly begins to participate, in a way to prove to him that she is not what he thinks she is.  An adventure, largely just observed by Stewart from his room, ensues that builds to a frightening climax.  If ever you doubt that Hitchcock has a certain genius, you have to experience this.  There are also flashes of humor and sexual innuendo.

There are also excellent critical reviews and documentaries of the restored version, which add to the excellence of this dvd.

227752,4,6300183513,"This 1954 Alfred Hitchcock classic was nominated for four Academy awards.  I remember seeing it years ago and loving it.  Seeing it again, I'm reminded of the way things used to be, and it is certainly worthwhile as a retro experience.  It's interesting to see the clothing styles and the dial telephones.  There's also a mystery that kept me interested.

Jimmy Stewart is cast in the role of a photographer with a broken leg.  He's confined to his apartment which is supposed to be in New York's Greenwich village.  From his window, he observes his neighbors.  And the apartment house across the street just happens to be designed in a way that he can look into the windows of all the apartments and get a bird's eye view into the lives other people's lives.  Every day a nurse, played by Thelma Ritter, comes to look in on him.  She shares his interest in his neighbors and she counsels him about his love life.  It seems his girlfriend, played by Grace Kelly, wants to marry him but he holds back because she is a society girl and he doubts if she can fit into his life of international travel to a wide variety of war-torn and isolated places.  But as the film progresses, she gets more and more involved in what he suspects is a murder in the apartment across the courtyard.  She's beautiful, of course, with an unnaturally tiny waistline which was the style in those days, and she plays her part well.  Raymond Burr is cast in the role of the supposed murderer.  Did he or did he not kill his wife?  This is the storyline that keeps the audience guessing.

The plot moves swiftly and it certainly captured my interest.  And Hitchcock had a way of capturing suspense that is unique.  It is successful as a film in most ways.  But it's 2010 now I'm a bit jaded.  That why, in spite of my giving this film a high recommendation, I'm not exactly sure that it has stood the test of time.",1278806400,3,1888,4.430232558139535
227753,4,6300183513,"This isn't as tense and scary as a lot of Hitchcock films.  It's much more main-stream, American, 50's era, middle of the road.  That's not entirely bad.  The cast is great.  James Stewart is charming and likable as usual, Grace Kelly is exquisite, as usual in her gorgeous Edith Head created wardrobe, Thelma Ritter is endearingly wise-cracking as usual.

The story is clever enough featuring a photographer who approaches life through the safe distance of a lens.  I didn't see a lot of chemistry between Kelly and Stewart; he seemed much older than she was, which strained the credibility of her adoration and patience.  There were other things that didn't really make sense, but overall the film pulls you along pleasantly.

Hitchcock fans will go gaga over it, uncritically, because it is, after all, Hitchcock.  But if you just want to enjoy a movie on its own merits, this is fun, but a little dated.",1278201600,2,907,4.8

The makeout scenes could have been deleted, for all I care, or an older attractive actress could have been more demure.  Oh, well...  I mean...it was like some sweet young thing doing you know what with her grandfather. But, the VHS still stacks up well against most new releases.

227756,5,6300183513,"""Rear Window,"" of course, is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most glittering masterpieces, and the great thing about this DVD is that it goes a long way in showing us why. First, it presents the film in a beautiful new restoration, with glowing colors and crisp picture definition. Second, it provides a fascinating feature in the Extras section, describing how Hitchcock designed the set--one of the most ingenious production designs in cinematic history. It contains interviews with surviving members of the cast and crew, including several of the neighbors on whom L.B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies (James Stewart) trained his binoculars. The featurette fills us with renewed awe at Hitchcock, one of the most meticulous directors ever as well as one of the most brilliant, and at how he could keep such myriad, tiny details in his head as he made this film.

And the film itself? I can only add my few droplets to the oceans of deserved praise it has received over the last half-century. What perfect casting: like a master chef, Hitchcock blends the disparate styles of Stewart, Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey and Raymond Burr into something delicious and unique. What superbly timed suspense: if your pulse rate doesn't exceed 200 beats per minute as Stewart listens to Burr's footsteps up the stairs, growing closer and closer in a measured beat, you need to see your doctor immediately. And of course the first appearance of Kelly, a breathtaking blonde beauty arising as if from a dream, will haunt you forever.

It is superb story unfolding details of a murder of a wife by her husband in parallel with unfolding of a romantic and passionate relationship of another budding couple. Yes, James Stewart looks too old to be a bachelor photographer but that could not rob him and the screen of his charming personality. Stewart and Kelly looks at the different tenants of the apartment complex and finds in them one of the possibility of their own relationship - boy leaves girl alone, boy without a lady, married couple but with little match, happily married or at the bottom of a relationship so as to kill the wife. Stewart/Kelly pursues the worst combination but comes out - expectantly - as the best one.

227772,1,6300183513,"The image on this disc was cropped on the bottom, to convert the original 1.66 shape to the 1.78 shape of modern screens.

The still image from this movie that I see most often shows Grace Kelly facing the camera and reclining on the daybed in the foreground, with Stewart upstage in the wheelchair. On this disc, the portion of her figure closest to the lower edge of the image is cropped away. You can see that shot 71 minutes into the movie.

To me it seems that about every other shot in the movie is badly composed, and that's because the image was cropped along the bottom. For instance, Thelma Ritter's hands keep dropping below the lower edge of the screen while she's making the bed. Once you become conscious of this, it really spoils the movie.

Is mutilating old movies to fit modern 16:9 screens just a fad? Will there come a time when we can get genuine (not mutilated) copies of these terrific movies?

I really wish everyone who notices this on any movie would give the movie the lowest possible rating in online reviews.

227774,3,6300183513,"Just saw the glorious ""North by Northwest"" on the big screen at a local rep house, and browsing online reviews afterwards (""Top Ten Films of the '50s,"" etc.), I was startled to see that ""Rear Window"" actually made more ""best of"" lists than ""NXNW.""

So--my faith in my fellow film-goers' good sense shaken to the core--I'm writing this brief review to throw some critical cold water on the idea that the competent but undistinguished ""Rear Window"" could ever deserve mention in the same breath with really first-rate Hitchcock, like ""NXNW,"" ""Vertigo"" or ""Psycho.""

""Rear Window"" is a stagy, stodgy piece of '50s mass entertainment. (The villain is Raymond Burr, for god's sake!) It's always struck me as one of those conservative, big-box-office-targeted popcorn movies that directors make to keep their Hollywood hitmaker cred--like, say, Warren Beatty's ""Heaven Can Wait"" or Scorsese's Howard Hughes bio-pic.

Don't get me wrong--""Rear Window"" isn't a bad film at all. It's cleverly conceived and written, in an old-fashioned well-made play sort of way. (The hero, stuck in a little bachelor apartment with a broken leg, spies a possible murder out his back window and has to catch the bad guy without ever leaving his room.) It's carefully plotted to dole out the suspense spoonful by spoonful, and has the requisite colorful minor characters--mostly quirky neighbors noted from afar through Jimmy Stewart's nosy binoculars.

But it's one of Hitchcock's least personally-stamped films. Though there are some nice touches--it cocks an impudent eye at film's inherent voyeurism--more than any other movie of Hitchcock's great mature period, it seems a filmed version of somebody else's work. Like a stage play brought to the screen, say, though I know it wasn't that. (The screenplay was based on a short story.)

Jimmy Stewart is a bit miscast as a hard-boiled war-and-disaster photographer; trying to play hard-bitten, he's wooden. And maybe it's me, but the opposites-attract, mildly troubled romance with society-girl-to-the-max Grace Kelly left me yawning, even rolling my eyes at times. (Yes, she sure is purty.)

Now, contrast that with ""North by Northwest""'s infectious filmic dynamism, from the classic crop-duster sequence that uses the screen so amazingly, to Eva Marie Saint's suavely torrid seduction of Cary Grant on the 20th Century Ltd., to the stunning finale literally all over Mt. Rushmore. And note how brilliantly all that deeply pleasurable inventiveness paints the movie's theme--of American individualism  embattled in an era of mass commercialism and Cold War deceit--right across an iconic American landscape. No mistaking a masterwork; nobody but Hitchcock.

Sorry, but comparing ""Rear Window"" with a really great piece of Hitchcockian filmmaking like ""NXNW""--or ""Vertigo"" or ""Psycho,"" films that changed the whole terrain of film--does NOT work to ""Rear Window""'s advantage. It just shows it up as the perfectly okay but definitely second-tier piece of moviemaking it is.",1260230400,,2999,5.3931623931623935
227775,3,6300183513,"Hitchcock films usually string the viewer along and slowly builds up the tension and suspense until a climactic finish.  Rear Window is no exception and from a slow start we are gradually propelled along with the main character towards a confrontation with the man he's slowly realised has committed a murder.

The added ingredient is that he's wheelchair bound following an accident, and is unable to flee when events conspire to bring the two together.

The story is basic enough, and we get to see the neighbours of the courtyard which comprises the entire world of this film - with the sole exception of a glimpse of the outside strret through a narrow alleyway.  Most of the neighbours we hardly meet close up, but they all have their own personalities and lives, and we only really see them through the eyes of the wheelbound voyeur.

James Stewart and Grace Kelley are the headline stars here, Stewart the wheelbound photographer and Kelley his glamourous girlfriend, but I couldn't help feeling they were mismatched and things didn't exactly gel between them, either on screen (at least to my eyes) or as characters.  Also it was a little ponderous at times in getting to the point, and I felt my attention wandering on occasions while watching it.  I was also a little let down at the climax when Raymond Burr's character finally confronted Stewart.  It was certainly unrealistic and was like opening a long promised box of chocolates to find they had been crushed en route.

227799,4,6300183513,"Rear Window (Alfred Hitchcock, 1954)

Few directors did it as well, and as consistently, as Alfred Hitchcock. And while I often wonder what it is the critics are thinking when they rank Hitchcock's films (Vertigo is better than North by Northwest? On what planet?), I have to admit that they've mostly got it right with Rear Window, which is a masterpiece of casting. It's a masterpiece of direction, too, but then it's a Hitchcock movie. You expect that.

John Michael Hayes' adaptation of a story by the now mostly-obscure Cornell Woolrich (and his current obscurity is more of a crime than anything he ever wrote about) is brought to life by the casting of Jimmy Stewart as L. B. Jeffries, the film's main character. How much thought went into that choice? Actually, probably not much, given that in hindsight it makes such perfect sense. You're taking an actor who's well-known for being a good old-fashioned down-homey kind of guy and playing on that typecasting. You even give him a down-homey kind of hobby; he's bored, so he grabs his binoculars and starts spying on his neighbors. That's the kind of thing you expect eighty-year-old ladies to do. Where's the harm? I'm not sure any other actor could have brought that kind of baggage to the table but Jimmy Stewart. I mean, that's inspired casting, that is. And at heart, all the stupidity that follows is Jimmy Stewart trying to do the right thing. Doesn't he always?

In fact, it's hard to think of Rear Window as noir, really. It's all just good, clean fun, with death and mayhem. (And really, how many of Jimmy Stewart's movies would have been spiced up by a little death and mayhem?) It's got a fun script, a fine leading actress in Grace Kelly (though honestly one wonders why someone as all-fired hot as Grace Kelly would waste her time on Jimmy Stewart when he's obviously trying to get rid of her), and some fabulous minor characters to inject much-needed humor to lighten things up now and again. There's none of the sense of bleakness that you get from a movie like Ace in the Hole or Sunset Blvd. here. And because of that, given the time in which it was made, it seems a bit out of place. I mean, even Douglas Sirk managed a pretty darned good piece of noir when he turned his mind to it (as did Hitch, actually; he practically invented the genre, where film was concerned, with his original version of The 39 Steps in 1935, and revitalized it briefly over a quarter century later with North by Northwest).

Still, for all that, it is a fine piece of moviemaking, to be sure, and definitely stands up to repeated viewing; I think the time I'm basing this review on was my fifth. I like it a bunch. I still don't think it's North by Northwest or Psycho, or even Lifeboat (which I seem to like a whole lot more than most people), but it's one of Hitch's, say, top twenty movies. *** ",1233964800,,2853,4.553606237816764
227800,5,6300183513,"L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) is a dashing photographer who usually spends his time out in the field getting the most exciting and difficult shots.  Unfortunately, while he got a fantastic photo of a crashing race car, he also got a busted leg and is laid up in his second floor apartment in a cast.  For seven weeks (and one more to go) he's had nothing to do but watch the neighbors whose apartment windows all surround the same courtyard.  But very late one night he hears a scream and notices one neighbor (a salesman) making repeated trips out into the rain with a large samples case and his nagging wife has disappeared.  Jeffries becomes convinced the man killed her.

The entire movie is shown from the point of view from Jeffries' apartment, and illustrates perfectly Hitchcock's genius.  He tells the story by what he shows with the camera (pay attention to the very clever opening sequence for a good example), by what Jeffries sees and does, and what you see of the neighbors.  Has a murder really been committed?  Hitchcock interjects subtle humor throughout, from Jeffries and the various neighbors, such as ""Miss Lonelyheart"" or ""The Newlyweds.""  And when Hitchcock decides to turn on the suspence, he turns it on all the way.  One part I found slightly unbelievable is Jeffries' resistance to his beautiful girlfriend (Grace Kelly) who offers repeated hints about marriage.  C'mon, Grace Kelly?!?  What's he waiting for?

But it's all part of Hitchcock's larger theme here, and this movie was lots of fun to watch noting how clever Hitchcock is and looking for his cameo appearance (and I'm not really much of a film buff).

227825,5,6300183513,"Restorers' Error

What the restorers of Rear Window don't know is that there exist two dream sequences in the first part of the movie.

The first takes place after Grace Kelly leaves, and James Stewart has heard the scream from across the courtyard. Thelma Ritter, Grace Kelly, and the courtyard are shown while dialogue from Thelma Ritter's argument with Stewart about Lisa, and Lisa's argument with Stewart, are heard with an echo. The composer's new song is heard.

The second takes place after Stewart has waked up and noticed the salesman taking a suitcase out during the rain, coming back, and taking the suitcase out again. The composer's song is heard over the image which shows the salesman arguing with his wife, the artist neighbor telling the salesman he is giving the plants too much water, Thelma Ritter saying ""I've got a nose for trouble, I can smell it ten miles away."" Then Ritter says, ""I can smell trouble right in this apartment. First you break your leg, then you start looking out the window, seeing things you shouldn't see,"" while we see the wife catching the salesman in the other room talking to his girlfriend on the phone, then Ritter saying ""We've become a race of Peeping Toms, what we ought to do is get outside ourselves and look in once in a while. The New York sentence for a Peeping Tom is six months in the workhouse. There are no windows in the workhouse. You know, in the old days they used to put people's eyes out with a red-hot poker. Any of those worth a red-hot poker?"" as we see the salesman carrying the suitcase out into the rain.

When Stewart wakes up the apartment complex is dark, the shades are drawn. He sees Miss Torso come home from her evening out. Then he sits up as he sees the salesman coming back for a second time with the suitcase.

Each sequence is introduced by a rippling of the image of Stewart's sleeping face, and his face is superimposed over the dream images.

These dream sequences articulate the major themes of the movie: the dubious morality of voyeurism, Stewart's sexual ambivalence about Grace Kelly and his interest in other women, the salesman's conflict with his wife, Thelma Ritter's attempts to persuade Stewart to come back to a normal way of living. The salesman's problems with his wife are an analog to Stewart's problems with Grace Kelly. The core of voyeurism is sexuality, and this is shown over and over again in the movie. The motive for the salesman's murder of his wife is another woman. Miss Lonelyhearts' attempted suicide is because of her failed relationships with men. Miss Torso is fighting off suitors and trying to save herself for her husband, who, in a comic moment at the end of the movie, returns from military service more interested in food than in his sensual wife. The newlyweds keep their shades drawn because they are making love.

The restorers should have researched the film more carefully. Neither restored transfer includes these dream sequences as ""deleted scenes.""",1223683200,2,2982,4.745173745173745
227826,5,6300183513,"Every film is an artifact of its era and ""Rear Window"" is no different so those expecting slam bang action like they see in ""The Matrix"" should look elsewhere. All of that said, ""Rear Window"" still stands tall as a film classic because of the themes, artistry of Hitchcock, the performances and the witty dialogue that we hear in the film. Unseen except for rare TV performances in the early 60's and rare revival house showings, ""Rear Window"" looks extremely good in its DVD presentation although clearly no complete restoration was done here like was done for ""Vertigo"" (but ""Rear Window"" wasn't in as bad a shape as ""Vertigo"" either). This edition looks better than the previous DVD (although it should be noted it's the same transfer as what was in the Hitchcock boxed set release four years ago)with a nice anamorphic transfer. Some people seem to think that film grain is a bad thing--it's not it's just how the film looks and ""Rear Window"" is no exception. Expecting this to look like a film produced in 2008 isn't realistic and it won't--but it still looks darn good.

Extras are as follows: The extras that came with the boxed set as well as those from the previous single DVD release have been ported over to this release as well. We get two new delicious extras--a theme appropriate episode of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" with the Hitchcock directed episode """"Mr. Blanchard's Secret"" and also excerpts from the interview Traffaut did with Hitchcock for his book in the early 60's.

Other extras: Audio commentary by author John Falwell, ""Rear Window Ethics"", Interview with Writer John Michael Hayes"", ""Pure Cinema: Through the Eyes of the Master"", ""Breaking Barriers: The Sound of Hitchcock"", production notes, theatrical trailers, photo gallery, audio interview excerpts from Truffaut's interviews with Hitchcock,

A plot synopsis is below for those intereested:

Spying through a glass darkly (his camera lens), L.B. Jefferies (Jimmy Stewart) believes a neighbor (Raymond Burr) has murdered his wife. His evidence is circumstanial at best and the wheelchair bound photographer has to convince his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly)of the crime. In the process he puts his friends in harm's way. Hitch laces his film with more than a touch of humor and irony pulling this thriller together as it's L.B.'s peeping that reveals the ugly underneath--revealing something unsavory about himself as well without him truly realizing it.

Hitchcock manages to do more with less than just about any director out there. Using a single soundstage, a small cast and the witty script by John Michael Hayes, Hitchcock crafts one of his classic films. ""Rear Window"" has aged yes but it looks, sounds and plays remarkably well fifty four years after it's original theatrical release. Highly recommended.",1223424000,6,2795,5.093886462882096
227827,5,6300183513,"While Psycho is my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie, Rear Window is a close second, and it is to my mind the classiest suspense movie he made.  Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly provide that classiness.  Cool and brazen Grace, subtlely provoking Jimmy at every turn, knowing he is stuck helpless with a broken leg in a cast, while she cavorts about getting too close to the murderer, and enjoying his nervousness.  The murderer is played by Ramond Burr in a strange role for him--but he is very scary.  In a stroke of genius, Hitchcock provides us a cutaway view of the appartments across the way and the dramas going on inside of them.  We start getting invested in the stories of the inhabitants.  Thelma Ritter adds something to the movie that it could not do without.  As Stewart's private duty nurse, her no-nonsence philosophies of life are very necessary for thorough scene development.  I never get tired of watching this movie.  Barbara Bel Geddes is also very good as Jimmy's secretary.",1221609600,,991,4.7823529411764705
227828,2,6300183513,"Some films show their age, and others do not. Despite its reputation as a classic of great filmmaking, Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film Rear Window, unfortunately, shows its age far too much. No, it's certainly not a bad film, by any standard, and is a pretty good one, but it's not one of Hitchcock's best, much less a great film, nor deserving of any place in the Top 100 Films lists of the last few years. Technically, it deserves many plaudits, but what really fails is the screenplay, written originally by John Michael Hayes for a radio play, and adapted from a short story by Cornell Woolrich. Yes, one can suspend disbelief from night till day comes, but the whole idea that a man would murder his wife and cut up her body all in front of an open window is sheerly implausible, even back in the 1950s New York milieu the film takes place in. Even one of the film's characters, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) comments on that fact, but it's not with irony, which only highlights the film's greatest failing- its implausibility.
  Now, there are genres where the suspension of disbelief is absolutely essential. For example, one of my favorite films from childhood, the original Planet Of The Apes (1968) requires a great suspension of disbelief, far more so than Rear Window does. After all, the Charlton Heston character, Colonel Taylor, a veteran trained astronaut and scientist, goes throughout the whole film not recognizing the sun and moon, the constellations, the unlikely evolutionary odds that humans and apes could evolve anywhere but Earth, and that the apes speak English, no less! It's not until he sees the wreck of the Statue Of Liberty that he realizes he's back on our world. I was four or five when I first saw the film, and knew it was Earth a minute or two after the astronauts arrived on the Planet Of The Apes. Perhaps too closely studying books on geology and science destroys a youthful ability to suspend disbelief, but the rest of the film was so brilliantly satirical that the implausibilities were minor solecisms. In short, there is no story unless we accept these liberties with common sense, including the fact that the astronauts could be frozen in suspended animation for two eons. It's an all or none proposition- accept, or walk out of the theater. Genres that depend on the implausible- like sci fi and horror, demand such of their audience, and once given it's foolish to quibble over things like time travel, faster than light speed, aliens, modern dinosaurs, ghosts, atomic age mutants, or the like....The plot is well known.... While not a great film overall, Rear Window is a technically great film. The camera work by cinematographer Robert Burks is first rate, and the film goes over many standard Hitchcock themes such as voyeurism- especially apt in this cyberworld of 24/7 voyeurism, marriage as a horror, and challenging technical restrictions, as in Lifeboat and Rope. There are many small moments in the film that work for effect- such as pure mise-en-scene shots of Jeff or the neighbors doing minor things unrelated to the main tale. And, there is some comedy, such as after Jeff is tossed out the window, and Thorwald is arrested, Stella comments to the cops, `I don't want any part of it', when asked about assisting in the search for Anna Thorwald's body. Still, none of the many pluses of the film are enough to lift the film up from a good, solid period piece, for Rear Window's reputation is based largely upon its claim to being a slice of `realism'. It's not. It's far closer to melodrama with its reliance on coincidences and implausibilities- not to mention the very sexism of the premise that a woman is so predictable that even her murder can be deduced by small deviances from that predictability, to propel the main action along. And melodrama, while it can often be great fun, is almost never great art. Rear Window is vastly overrated, and no exception that proves the rule. It is the rule, and that's a fact no amount of suspended disbelief can alter.",1221523200,7,4018,4.771551724137931
227829,5,6300183513,"This film has become a cult film with time. Everything seems to be at that level though the situation and plot are rather light. What is important here is that Hitchcock transforms this back yard and garden surrounded by buildings all around and a highly voyeuristic microcosm into a complete vision of human society with all its dramas, and its pleasures and joys. To transform such a small microcosm entirely closed onto itself into a vision of the whole society we hardly get a couple of glimpses of through an alley opening onto the main street is marvelous and amazing. The second phenomenal fact is that the main actor is a wheelchair-ridden man with a severely broken leg in a cast. How can the whole world completely turn and whirl around that sole man? It is only possible because it is absolutely seen through the only eyes of this man or the eyes of the people standing next to him. There is only one instance when the point of vision is not his own eyes but a point outside in the yard-garden: at the end when he is being dropped from his window and then we get for a very short period of time the vision from the cops' eyes. This gives to that film such a personal dimension that it is nearly sickening: we have the impression of invading the privacy of that man. In fact what I have just said is false because he alternates what the man can see and close-up shots on him to show his personal reactions to what he has just seen. This constant alternating of voyeuristic sequences from the eyes of one man and close-up shots on his body language and language forces us into his own skin, body, bones. We are no longer voyeurs but ghosts in him seeing through his eyes. We are the direct witnesses of what he sees because we see it with him, through his own eyes and we start feeling the same emotions as he does. Of course everything is seen through the camera, but Hitchcock even uses some tools to emphasize the voyeuristic dimension and force us into it: a camera with a zooming lens that is so big that the camera becomes minuscule, or binoculars that are of course too big for the distance across the back yard and later the flash bulbs to force us not to see through the eyes of the murderer but to be seen through the eyes of the murderer. The last point I would like to insist on is that Hitchcock shows a murder but he is not interested in the murder per se but in the reactions of the witnesses, those who see everything and how they are blind to what they see. Then he builds up the slow recognition in their eyes, language and behavior, and then they become obsessive about it, to the point of becoming if not courageous at least unconscious of the risks they are taking or running. That too is remarkable and that nearly makes us get out of the simplistic voyeurism I have spoken of all along and climb into some kind of distantiation from the penned up impression of before, a distantiation that leads us to the idea that courage in a human society is often the result of a conviction that makes us blind to the danger or risk we are facing. Courage is the result of a lack of consciousness more than intensified consciousness. This is the human dimension Hitchcock always brought to his films. And that is kind of lost in our modern action films that do not have one single second now and then to just rest and digest what has happened before.

227830,5,6300183513,"Rear Window is considered by many Alfred Hitchcock's best movie.  The story suited him well.  A man confined to a wheelchair, watching things that may be innocent or murderous, a beautiful woman out of her element, in danger, with gradually building suspense that takes a potentially fatal turn as we watch helplessly with our immobilized protagonist, and a cliffhanger climax.  The movie has been analyzed by very smart people looking for much more than that, deeper meanings and allusions, and some of their ideas are true, and some are fun.  But it's the basic story elements, sharp dialogue, fine acting and the direction of a master that make it a great movie.

The immobilized man is ""Jeff"" Jeffries (James Stewart), a Life Magazine photographer who's laid up in his New York City apartment with a broken leg.  Accustomed to an active life of adventure and world traveling, he's reduced to passing his time using binoculars and a telephoto lens to spy on the small world of neighbors across a small courtyard from his rear window.  The beautiful woman is his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), a high society woman whom he is avoiding marrying on the excuse that she isn't cut out for his rambling life of action and danger, and he doesn't want to settle down.  As events across the way take a potentially sinister turn, the tables are turned as Lisa shows her grit in risky investigations while Jeff must remain passive.  Raymond Burr (of Perry Mason fame) plays the suspect neighbor who may or may not have killed someone.  Thelma Ritter is Jeff's house-call nurse who also gets involved.

Most of the film is presented from Jeff's powerless perspective, giving the suspense an extra edge.  There are allusions to impotence and, through the lives of the neighbors, a range of romantic and marriage relationships mirroring the fears of many men and women, including our protagonists.  Much has been made of the theme of voyeurism, the window as a representation of the movie screen and so on, though I think it's easy to make too much of that.  Screenwriter John Michael Hayes and Hitchcock work in the usual Hitchcock cameo and humor, including a dog who ""knew too much"" (a reference to another Hitchcock film).

Their dysfunctional relationship is believable and well acted.  Thelma Ritter stands out, even among these two, to be a transcendent comic character.

The story itself is still so intriguing: a voyeur witnesses a crime, but has trouble convincing others because he is prying on his unsuspecting neighbors.  I think reality t.v. proves just how much interest we all have in the lives of others.  The timeless storyline is so well acted and cleverly presented; it is difficult NOT to like this film.

227842,3,6300183513,"This movie is a great one to encapsulate what makes Hitchcock films great.  His brand of storytelling is unique and for me very enjoyable.  He always shows us the story from the subjective viewpoint of the actor and in this case, Jimmy Stewart, as the temporarily invalid photographer who out of boredom decides to take an interest in his neighbour's activities.  In effect, he is watching many television screens aka windows outside his apartment that happen to be screening real-life soap operas.

I disagree that what he does amounts to voyeurism because he doesn't really watch continuously just to get gratuitous pleasure out of it but he really appears to be concerned about his neighbour's well-being.  He tries to prevent the lonely one from committing suicide in addition to the main part of the story about his concern for the invalid woman who was killed by her husband.  I thought the beautiful irony was that while everyone was critical of Stewart's character spying or peeping at his neighbours and yet his concern for them and his willingness to even put his life on the line to help them contrasts with that of the other neighbours who just didn't give a damn and who are supposed to be doing the right thing.  The scene with the dead dog perfectly illustrates this as at one apartment, the party simply resumes as if nothing happened after the distraught owner's emotional outburst.  I just loved the dramatic irony of how Stewart's character was really the good neighbour despite his peeping while the others were really bad neighbours minding their own business just like in the parable of the Good Samaritan.

The screenplay was very well written and the witty and comical dialogue especially between Stewart's character and the masseuse was very amusing indeed.  The acting wasn't brilliant but was good enough and I enjoyed the theme about the differences between man and woman and how their motivations are driven by different things and yet both are really trying to arrive at the same thing: happiness in a life together.  The final scene with Grace Kelly and the magazine was especially telling and amusing for me.

The special features are quite good and I especially like the documentary ""Rear Window Ethics: Remembering and Restoring a Hitchcock Classic.""  The only problem is with the dvd which sound quality wise isn't great and the picture quality despite being restored is quite poor with many imperfections on too many frames.  This suggests to me that the original master must be very poorly preserved if this is the best that they could do.  Here's hoping that with the advent of Blu-ray they will take the opportunity to have another try at improving both the picture and sound quality.  For the latter a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround restored sound option would be much appreciated.

Jeff quickly assumes the wife was murdered.  Enlisting Lisa and Stella's help, he tries to prove it.  But is he right?  And can he prove it without leaving his own apartment?

I seem to have a weird relationship with Hitchcock.  I don't enjoy the movies everyone considers his masterpieces, but I do enjoy his lesser known films.  In keeping with this tradition, I didn't enjoy this one as much as I thought I would.  The beginning of the film was very slow as the many side stories were set up.  Even once the main story got going, I still found it rather slow for my tastes.  The ending, however, was exciting if a bit predictable.  And the acting was great, bringing the characters to life.

The plot is intelligent, the characters well-developed, the actors top notch, Princess Grace is incredibly glamorous, the dialog is memorable and the social observations and commentary quite thought-provoking.  It's a visual and verbal treat at every level.

I do agree that the murder is not so much the main point of the movie (since we never actually see the murder and there's no doubt as to whodunit), as is the exercise in pseudo-voyeurism that Hitchcock provides.  The viewer gets to take advantage of the neighborhood espionage of L.B. Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart).  It should be pointed out that in 1954, television had fortunately not yet become the staple feature of American home life - which makes it understandable that a homebound individual in an urban neighborhood would unintentionally find himself watching real people instead.

Jeffries (James Stewart), but there's no real chemistry between the two leads (had Prince Rainier already proposed?).  Worse yet, the two supporting players (Thelma Ritter as Jeffries' nurse, and Raymond Burr as the defense attorney accused of killing a dog) seem to be phoning it in.

Worst of all, this mystery movie has no real mystery.  Stewart and Kelly suspect Burr has killed a dog--guess what?  He did!  I won't spoil what follows, except to say Burr's actions are beyond belief, given that he (at most) faced no more than a fine for cruelty to animals.

The ""Miss Torso"" character is the sole bright spot in this gloomy production, but alas, she has far too little screen time.  The two stars are for her.",1200355200,5,1036,4.829545454545454
227849,5,6300183513,"Released in 1954, REAR WINDOW was a major success with critics and public alike--and unlike some Hitchcock films, which were praised at the time but negatively re-evaluated, it has held up incredibly well over time.

Loosely suggested by several notorious crimes, the premise of REAR WINDOW is widely famous.  Photographer L.B. Jefferies (Jimmy Stewart) is confined to his New York apartment with a broken leg, alternately nursed and harrassed by his elegant girl friend Lisa (Grace Kelly) and pragmatic day nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter.)  Annoyed and bored, he begins to watch his neighbors across the courtyard--and soon notices the activites of Mr. and Mrs. Thorwald (Raymond Burr and Irene Winston.)  Their quarrels quite suddenly cease, Mrs. Thorwald is no longer visible, and Mr. Thorwald is unexpectedly given to taking packages out of the house.  Is it murder?

The set for REAR WINDOW has long garnered a great deal of attention, and deservedly so: it is a meticulous sound stage re-creation of New York apartment buildings of the era, and with few exceptions both the camera work and sound effects are presented from Jefferies' point of view: we see what he sees and hear what he hears.  In the process, we become as much of a peeping tom as Jefferies himself, a device that tends to make audiences increasingly squirm as the film progresses.  At the same time, however, we are also privy to Jefferies' private life, most particularly his rocky relationship with Lisa, who wants marriage but whom Jefferies rejects as incompatible with his own lifestyle.

The performances here are extraordinary, with James Stewart cast against type as Jefferies and Grace Kelly sparkling as the high-fashion Lisa.  But the real stunner is the supporting cast, which ranges from the truly remarkable Thelma Ritter to the host of players who are glimpsed from Jefferies' window as they go about their daily routines: the lonely lady, the musician, the newly married couple, the scultor, the woman with the dog--and, of course, ""Miss Torso,"" a particularly voluptuous blonde who spends her time in what Lisa calls ""a woman's hardest job: juggling wolves!""

This is Hitchcock working at the peak of his talents, working his themes of isolation, vulnerability, and most particularly voyerism to the nth degree.  The script is tight, the cinematography is flawless, and the production designs are beyond perfection.  Critics may argue which film can be regarded as Hitchcock's ultimate masterpiece, but even the most picky among them will place REAR WINDOW either at or very near the top slot--and so will you.  Truly memorable and beautifully restored on this DVD release.  Recommended.

But, Hitch could do that..create a good film out of next to nothing."" So, Hitchcock paired Stewart with Grace Kelly (old enough to be his daughter) and came up with a gem. which seems to have faded a bit with time.

Whatever the case, I was left a little underwhelmed.

Jimmy Stewart is great, as usual. Grace Kelly is a knockout. I even like the nurse.

Yet this movie drags.

As I explained to my wife, who fell asleep a half hour in, not much happens. They sit around. They sit around some more.

They conjecture.

And then--boom. There is an ending. While this movie has all the stylish atmosphere you could want out of a Hitchcock movie, it does not rise the level of a Psycho, Vertigo, or North By Northwest.

Rear Window is worth watching. It has some very funny dialogue and a couple of iconic moments. I just don't recommend investing in your own copy unless you are a Hitchcock completist.",1195948800,9,913,4.463855421686747
227869,5,6300183513,"Rear window was taken from a short story entitled, ""It had to be Murder"" by Cornell Woolrich and adapted to the screen by John Michael Hayes  (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-Who-Knew-Too-Much/dp/B000CCW2TS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man Who Knew Too Much</a>) & (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-Catch-a-Thief-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000MX7V5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To Catch a Thief (Special Collector's Edition)</a>). To Catch a Thief was Hayes's second collaboration with Hitchcock after Rear Window.

What makes this particular thriller one of the all time greats in cinematic history is its simplicity, revealing human nature's tendency to voyeurism.

L. B. Jefferies (Jimmy Stewart) is a photo journalist, forced to sit in his apartment because of a broken leg. He becomes extremely bored because his only contact to the outside world is his editor by phone, his nurse played with humour and charm, Stella (Thelma Ritter) and his stunning, rich girlfriend, Lisa Carole Fremont, (Grace Kelly) To alleviate his boredom, through the lens of his telescopic camera, he is able to spy on all his neighbours through his back window. It is through Jeffries eyes that the story is told as we get to know so many different characters with their interesting, mundane, sometimes lonely and murderous lives.

Jefferies girlfriend, Lisa, visits him frequently, and in one scene brings in a catered dinner of lobster and fine champagne, looking absolutely ravishing to get Jefferies to stop obsessing with his telescope and his spying. Despite her beauty and the brilliant food, Jefferies has a suspicion: one of his neighbours has killed his wife, chopped up her body, and disposes the evidence in several trips with a suitcase. This fixation turns obsessive and suddenly manic as the evidence mounts against the ""husband"" (Raymond Burr).

There are two story-telling devices that make a great thriller, mounting tension and the element of surprise. Rear Window has these qualities and much more.

For me the best aspect of this film is the stories within the main story. Through the eyes of Jefferies we become intimate with his neighbours and their various situations, some interesting, some plain evil, some mostly sad and terribly lonely. It's like the old adage: if you feel your life is a drag, look at other lives and miraculously, your problems are not that serious or sad.

I remember watching this film as a child and almost climbing the walls in fear at the end. Viewing the film so many years later, I didn't climb the walls but felt the same tension.

Rear Window has to be one of the great thrillers in the history of film.",1194480000,,2732,5.519138755980861

The movie is mostly dialogue between Stewart and whomever  is in his room at the time. During the times where there is no dialogue the camera is panning into the other windows of the courtyard. Stewart really doesn't have much evidence to go on but he is convinced one of his neighbors killed  his own wife. The movie builds and builds until we find out he is right.

227876,3,6300183513,"This film does a good job of creating a suspenseful atmosphere by making the audience the voyeur, however it was a little ridiculous at times.  Anyone saying anything negative about a Hitchcock film is sure raise a few eyebrows because some people seem to feel everything he churned out was remarkable.  This film was less than remarkable and if it didn't have the Hitchcock name on it, it would probably be rated lower.

Most of the problems that I had with Rear Window had nothing to do with Hitchcock though.  In fact, I would say that the concept was better than the screenplay and, if anything, Hitchcock did a good job at making a fairly weak screenplay into a watchable movie.

POSSIBLE SPOILER

Most of the character's behavior was absurd at best.  Maybe there were time/money constraints which prohibited a plausible ending but whatever the reason, the ending was ridiculous.  If Jimmy Stewart knew that the suspected murderer Raymond Burr saw him, why would he tell the Nurse to go bail out Grace Kelly and leave him alone in a wheel chair?  Why would he answer a phone (without knowing who's on the other end) and immediately start talking about the murderer?  Because he thought it was his friend that he just got off of the phone with?  Stupid.  Obviously, people can be that stupid in real life but I guess I just expected more than that from this film.  I also found Raymond Burr's desire to throw Jimmy Stewart out of the window retarded.  Let's see, someone has ""evidence"" that I committed a murder so why don't I give them absolute evidence by throwing a man out of a window while the police are right outside.

I know because they're old these movies are supposed to be so great, but you can't tell me that Rear Window is as exciting as a movie like Disturbia!!!  I guess you can tell me that, but I don't plan to listen to you.

Here's what happens in Rear Window:

No, I didn't make a mistake in that paragraph.  I was proving a point that nothing happens (by leaving a lot of blank space after the colon).  It's a movie about Jimmy Stewart sitting in a wheelchair and watching real action happen through binoculars.  Guess what, Alfred Hitchcock?  Maybe it would have been a better movie if we had been watching whatever was going on in that other building and not wasted our time watching the guy who was watching all the cool stuff go down!

That would be like if Steven Spielberg decided to make E.T. a story about a scientist in a lab coat who does nothing for 2 hours and then at the end he gets to poke and prod a little alien fella for about a second.  Hey, Steven Spielberg: thanks for not making that movie!!!

The photographer includes his girlfriend (Grace Kelly), his nurse (Thelma Ritter), and a detective friend in his theory that the man murdered his wife.

227903,5,6300183513,"It is difficult to not fall in love with ""Rear Window"" starring James Stewart and Grace Kelly. The film is a witty and strong testament about voyeurism without venturing into dark territory. In the case of Rear Window it concerns a physically disabled photographer's desperation to peak out the window of his apartment into the lives of his neighbors.  His new hobby while unhealthy, is an amusing, sympathetic portrayal of Alfred Hitchcock's reoccurring theme of how voyeurism plays a role for the viewer in cinema.

Everything works perfect, the cast, the story, the direction, even the cinematography. James Stewart as the protagonist L.B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies and Grace Kelly as his love interest Lisa Fremont have excellent chemistry together in the film along with a strong supporting cast.  The story is a clever, fresh, and funny execution of how the male gaze (as the camera lens) can function as a source of voyeur pleasure.  As the audience we are captivated in Jeff's life as he gazes through his camera to solve a murder mystery that happens across his apartment window.  Grace Kelly remains a heartfelt beauty, the woman in his life who's only desire is to divert Jeff's gaze away from the activity outside his apartment to herself.  Lisa represents Jeff's real world in which he is distracted away from by all that does not concern him.  Jeff's disability becomes a mental one as well as physical.

The movie is a film that should be watched while you are laying down with your feet propped up at night when you have the chance.

227904,3,6300183513,"This 1954 film is taken from a short story by Cornell Woolrich. The opening shows apartment houses in Greenwich Village and the people who live there. It is 90F and people are sweating it out. [Crime goes up with the temperature.] L. B. Jeffries is a graying photographer laid up with a broken leg. His apartment overlooks the windows of other apartments, the adults there and in the courtyard. A woman comes over to give him a massage. His girl friend is from Park Avenue. The lighting in the apartments allows viewing into the rooms. Lisa Carol Fremont is quite well-dressed and brings along a fancy take-out meal. Lisa wants to domesticate LBJ, to get him to settle down and quite foreign travel. But LBJ loves his career as a news photographer (can he look into his future?). Lisa is an upper-class lady who is happy in her niche.

At night LBJ sees a man from across the courtyard making many trips at night carrying a suitcase. He views the apartment with binoculars, then with a long-lens SLR camera. At times you hear children, but see none. LBJ is more interested in the man across the courtyard than in luscious Lisa, and this upsets Lisa. What happened to Thorwald's wife? [Decomposition would be rapid in the 90F heat.] LBJ seems cranky from being stuck in his room for the past 7 weeks. Lisa says Mrs. Thorwald would not have left her favorite purse and jewelry behind. Lt. Tom Doyle warns against imagining things, he checked out the shipped trunk. [No search warrant needed?] The death of a pet dog is ominous. Only one person didn't come out to look!

The amateurs continue to snoop into Thorwald's life. They wonder if something was buried in the back yard. Lisa enters Thorwald's apartment, is found, but the police take her away. LBJ answers the phone without saying ""hello"" and talks too much. There is a suspenseful series of heavy footsteps (believable?), then Thorwald enters the room. Can flashbulbs stop a murderer? The police arrive in time.

The temperature drops to 70F. We see what happened to the others across the courtyard. The success of this film tells much about popular taste in those times. It is basically a short story that is padded out to make a long story. I would not rate it among the top Hitchcock films. ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" and ""North by Northwest"" were better remakes of earlier films. Such snooping about neighbors is a feature of small-town life, unlike the anonymity of a big city.

227908,5,6300183513,"""Rear Window"" comes very close to be the perfect Hitchcock film that illustrates nearly all his great abilities...

Hitchcock demonstrates in ""Rear Window"" that he is a great voyeur, that he loves to spy on his characters making each viewer into a voyeur, forcing audience to see everything from his hero's point of view... James Stewart is hold up in his Manhattan two rooms apartment with a broken leg... He passes his time spying on his neighbors through back window in an orgy of voyeurism...

Speaking of technical challenge, ""Rear Window"" is Hitchcock prototype... Most of the film is shot from one confined set... It is also notably theatrical since it takes place in one room...

Hitchcock forces limitations on himself, as he did in ""Lifeboat"" when he shot entirely on a restricted set, in only one boat... And in ""Rope"" (his first Technicolor film) where the single setting for the production had only walls and furniture...

Having restricted his movements, Hitchcock is demanded to be ingenious in order to keep curiosity alive... He builds a realistic courtyard of apartments with inhabitants in it, and the restriction becomes a potency and the technique a fascinating example of what he chooses to call ""pure cinema.""

Hitchcock's camera tracks out through the windows... It never goes inside the apartments... We never see close-ups of the characters... We can only see what Stewart sees... We feel like we are watching people through a window instead of in a movie...

Hitchcock doesn't use any kind of music... We hear natural sounds, occasional live music played in the surrounding apartment...

""Rear Window"" describes Hitchcock at his best for the way it works on several levels, yet hides its own complexity... Stewart, tied in too by pressure from his high society girl who loves him and wants to marry him... Everything he sees out is related to this problem... He avoids to discuss marriage with her, though he himself does not seem to realize it...

All the while, the people in the 31 apartments that he can see live out their little lives... The tormented middle-aged bachelor, composer/songwriter; the couple who beats the heat by sleeping on a fire escape; the newlyweds and lovers; the tragic ""Miss Lonelyhearts"" and her fantasies of entertaining gentlemen callers; the hearing-impaired sculptor working day and night; the vivacious and sexy blonde dancer ""Miss Torso"" who does suggestive routines in bikini tops and, most important, the hysterical ""nagging wife"" - lying in bed - and her grouchy fed-up husband, a jewelry salesman...

One 'great shot' reveals just how involved Stewart has become in their lives when Miss Lovelyheart - in her romantic dinner for two - raises her glass in a toast to her imaginary lover and Stewart raises his glass as well...

The urban backyard setting is the night city terrain of ""Rear Window,"" a night city shattered by the sharp sound of a loud female scream and the sound of breaking glass...

Hitchcok presents Stewart who sees (or think he sees) what he is powerless to stop... The insidious salesman strangely attracts Stewart's attention... His Passtime becomes an obsession after he suspects that he has murdered his ailing wife and specially when he notices that she is missing... His ravishing fiance (Grace Kelly) and his nurse (Thelma Ritter) warn him that voyeurism is a crime and is dangerous... But Stewart persists, eventually he was turned on ... This explain perfectly his specific use of a huge zoom lens to do his peeping as he monitors the murderer's activities... The murderer and his wife became subject of Stewart's parody with the ""too perfect, too talented, too sophisticated,"" Grace Kelly...

""Rear Window"" is visually very strong... Hitchcock designs the film in such a way so that his view is our view... He manipulates our emotions because he knows perfectly his work... He has the film synchronized in his mind... Shooting and editing are, for him, a simple mechanical phase... The creativity has all taken place before...

The first shot of ""Rear Window"" is a perfect example of this reality - as his many typical first shots - for the way it visually transmits the whole complex to the audience...

Hitchcock is a master at using his camera to create suspense... Like Stewart, we are restricted in movements, paralyzed inside the apartment, immobile, trapped in a room where we are anxious and uncertain... There is no way we can warn the outcome... This is what 'suspense' is all about--not surprise... An effect of intense and prolonged expectancy, lacking all help in the state of knowing that we possess but the characters do not... And, of course, all this great suspense is created by only 'visual' means...

Stewart gives the performance of his life behaving at ease... He was the perfect Hitchcock character: a voyeur by profession, an unpretentious photo journalist who becomes caught in a terrifying event...

When you see the film, feel the menacing 'look' of the murderer staring those evil eyes at you... And don't forget to catch Alfred Hitchcok in his customary cameo appearance, this time repairing a clock... Enjoy!",1168473600,,5134,5.015276145710929

Through the eyes of Jefferies (Jimmy Stewart), we see the events that lead up to the suspicion of a murder that happens across his courtyard. He sees the events unfold through the window of his apartment, just as we see them on the movie screen.

Hitchcock uses suspense, point of view and camera angles to suck the audience into his own little movie world, with just a little voyueristic flair thrown in.",1165190400,3,609,4.735849056603773
227937,2,6300183513,"Well, I hate to say that I was not impressed, but I cannot lie so here it goes:

""I was not impressed.""

The question to ask would be why, and I guess the answer to that question is that I expected much more.  I have been a long standing fan of Hitchcock, not because I shiver at the sight of his films but because as a storyteller he is one of the most brilliant men who ever directed a film.  The problem with `Rear Window' to me is that you spend almost two hours just waiting for something to happen, and the suspense your promised doesn't really rear it's head.

The film follows L.B. Jeffries (Stewart), a photographer who is still recovering from an accident where his leg was broken.  He's stuck in his home until his cast is removed and he has nothing to do with his time but spy on his neighbors.  In the process of doing so he thinks he uncovers a murder take place (or at least he thinks he uncovers a murder, for he never really sees the murder happen).  He tries of course to convince those around him, including his girlfriend Lisa (Kelly) and his nurse (Ritter), and he succeeds on those accounts, but when it comes to getting his friend Lt. Thomas Doyle (Corey) he fails to do so.

Because of that Jeffries and his two accomplices decide to take matters into their own hands by sneaking into Lars Thorwald's (Burr) apartment (he's the man they assumed killed his wife) and by digging up the garden where they assumed he buried her.  I guess to me that main problem is that for the majority of this film nothing is happening.  We, the viewer, are just watching what Jeffries watches, which is pretty much nothing.  The story is a fine story it's just a bit boring.  Like I said, being such a long standing fan of Hitchcock I expected so much more from this film since it is so well regarded as one of Hitchcock's finest.

227939,5,6300183513,"I don't usually give classics high marks because movies to me are visual more than cerebral entertainment, and technology, production and might I even say, directing, is just so much better all the time.

However, Rear Window is one of those movies which transcends time, maybe because it only takes place in one setting there isn't much technology could do to improve it. And perhaps the grainy quality of the movie actually enhances the creepy atmosphere. The movie set itself is masterful, especially considering it was done in 1954. And gosh, Grace Kelly, they just don't make movie stars like that anymore.

So, what's good about it?  It puts you in the position of Jefferies, who is basically helpless. We are voyeurs together with him, however, a horrendous event occurs which eventually involves him, and being helpless, he cannot escape...... That's it in a nutshell, without telling you the story, which if you want to know you can read the other reviews.  I don't think any of Hitchcock's other movies have stood the test of time as well as this one because there pretty much isn't anything you could do to improve it. As I said, the poorer quality of 1954 production values only adds to this movie - making this movie any better would only make it worse.

Goofs:
1) When Jefferies changes his lens, he just puts it camera side down on a table. No pro worth his salt would ever do that, or use a telephoto over binoculars for that matter.
2) An in home nurse who also prepares a sandwich?! Bring me back to 1954! OK, her sandwich better be better than her 1 minute massage.
3) And this is the worst goof of all. Unbelievable. There isn't anything wrong with Jefferies' leg, it's his brain which is the problem.  How can any sane man reject a Grace Kelly who's throwing herself at him, c'mon, get real! That's just real bad script. If Rosanne Barr was playing Lisa Fremont, then yeah, I'd believe it, yeah then I'd try to get to SE Asia ASAP lobster dinners notwithstanding. (Or maybe he just doesn't want to leave that apartment and Ms. Torso.)

227940,5,6300183513,"Rear Window is one of Hitchcock's masterpieces. It's a simple, yet incredibly elaborate film that will make you laugh, excite you, and marvel about how hot Grace Kelly was. Everyone knows the plot of the movie for the most part; James Stewart plays L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries, a photographer confined to a wheelchair after suffering a broken leg. Apparently he hasn't heard of a TV, so he spends his days looking out the window at his neighbors. After a series of coincidences, he believes that his neighbor has killed his wife. With the help of his girlfriend Lisa (Kelly), detective/friend Doyle (Wendell Corey), and nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) he begins to uncover the mystery. This movie is a few minutes shy of two hours and is never dull...For a movie like this, that definitely takes some talent. First of all, the movie keeps throwing curveballs at you which make you question whether his neighbor is innocent or guilty. But even watching it today, it's not cliched. The subject of the film alone is fascinating; Voyeurism. Everyone is a voyeur, so the whole idea of voyeurism (especially when placed on film) can be fascinating and it's really fascinating here. Hitchcock manages to keep the suspense going, while occasionally making you laugh. The scene where Lisa and Stella go down to dig up the flowerbed and Lisa eventually sneaks into the neighbors apartment are truly great moments. James Stewart delivers one of his best performances. Rear Window holds the #42 spot on the American Film Institute's Top 100. The only Hitchcock film it ranks below is Psycho. If you like thought-provoking, slow moving suspense films. Check out Rear Window. It's a masterpiece.

This movie, with it's excellent cinematography (duh!  It's Hitchcock), shows you the world through Jimmy Stewart's eyes of the apartment complex.  Tension mounts as you see what Jimmy sees.  You find yourself asking the same question: Did the man really kill his wife?  Hitchcock takes you on a rollercoaster that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I have noticed that many TV shows throughout the years have used this movie premise as a TV episode (two that come to mind are ALF - remember ALF?! - and The Simpsons).

227967,5,6300183513,"For a director who once described his actors as cattle and who said the best way to direct them is to treat them as cattle (he said this as a joke by way); Alfred Hitchcock sure got the best out of his actors.

Mr. Hitchcock never really got the credit he deserved for most of his acting performances in his films: especially with his work with leading and supporting female actresses. Part of the reasoning may be due to the fact that he did work with the best talent in Hollywood. But look at his past films and you will see characters that come alive, heartfelt, and feel lived in. There's extreme depth, realism, and complexity to most of his movie characters.

In his 1954 classic, Rear Window, Hitchcock gets career performances from Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly. Both actors carry this film to heights that would not have occurred with lesser talent. The gold nugget is that Stewart and Kelly both do something that is extremely difficult for an actor/actress to achieve on screen.

They don't act, they re-act.

It's very difficult for an actor/actress to achieve this effect for a sustained period of time. There's always that motor or inner instinct telling the actor that they have to do something, say something, or show the motivation of the character. It basically takes trust. Trust in the story and directing.

I see a lot of this reactionary acting in Asian cinema. In particular Japanese films. The effect is still the same, but in Asian cinema we get the reactionary shots via conversation(more so than American cinema). For example, when we see a shot of the person listening and not the character talking it creates a very compelling shot. A surprise element comes into play.

In Rear Window the effect is different as we see Kelly and Stewart reacting to off screen stimuli. By using subtle gestures and reactions we get inside the heads of the two characters. We feel thier confusion, anxiety, and bewilderment. The subtlety of the acting is so precise in its realism that the audience feels that they are a 3rd person voyeur. It's this talent that the actors bring to the table and the set up of the story that makes this film work.

Mr. Hitchcock was the inventor of the POV shot as we know of it today and here he creates breathtaking POV shots, wonderful pacing, and unique camera angles to create ""pure cinema"", but believe me it's the strong acting and compelling story that makes this film an endearing classic.",1147392000,6,2442,4.691588785046729
227968,5,6300183513,"For me, the most interesting aspect of this film was the relationship between the roles of James Stewart and Grace Kelly.  As the movie progresses, it becomes ever more puzzling to understand why would a woman, so incredibly intelligent, beautiful, elegant and with her own career, pursue a rude man nineteen years her senior, unkempt, with a somewhat dirty and greasy look, who treats her with sarcasm and condescension without any obvious reason.  Her behavior is even more unexplained when he tells her openly that if they parted, he would not miss her.  Yet she comes back!  And she does not impress as a submissive character, so why does she bother with him?

I believe there is a power game between them, and her pride is hurt when he does not throw himself at her feet, perhaps he is the first man to resist her charms.  She doesn't know why but wants to discover, and she is determined to bring him to his knees, with him offering the wedding ring.  Once that happens, her game will be won and she would leave.  We can see how she takes an upper hand in the final scene, after her heroic break-in to the murderer's apartment, after that james' hero has no chance but to surrender, and immediately, as he is sleeping so obediently, like a baby, and in her care, she discards the book of their agreed-upon exotic voyages that she promised to him and turns instead to the most recent issue of Bazaar, her TRUE passion of fashion!!!  What a great battle of two egos, and poor James is totally defeated.

His weakness and impotency is finally reveled in a scene when he sees her straggling with the murderer, and James does nothing except pathetically screaming, he is so passive at this moment, that we know his deep-hidden secret of incapacity, which is a source of his rudeness and cold reaction towards her.  We know that the power table is turning then, when she becomes a heroine and he is just a hopeless spectator and coward.  She is clearly the winner of the game.

The film is a physiological masterpiece, and is worth watching alone for Grace's gowns.",1146441600,4,2065,4.594005449591281
227969,4,6300183513,"I was a bit hesitant to watch this movie because I had seen Vertigo and I really didn't like the casting choice of James Stewart.  But I'm on a bit of a Hitchcock thing right now and want to see all of his films.  One of the beautiful things about the movie is its superb use of location. The whole movie, bar a couple of brief scenes, is set in the apartment.  The obvious twists Mr. Hitchcock could have delivered upon us are never used. Perhaps we would have found out that in fact the neighbor's wife was alive, but that the neighbor was in fact involved in a crime. What was buried in the garden? The stolen jewel perhaps? No, We never really find out, they just elude to the mysterious treasure and we are left to assume it is just another cut up bit of wife.  Over all the story wasn't all that bad, it does pull you along, and it keeps you watching. But, admittedly a large part of that is because the viewer is left expecting one of those supposedly famous ""Hitchcock Twists"", but with a rushed and unimaginative ending, the twist never comes.  What intrigued me is that we can witness Stewart's voyeurism, taking the journey with him from curiosity to suspicion to certainty to fear, finally subconsciously delighting in becoming voyeurs ourselves.

227970,5,6300183513,"Based on the Cornell Woolrich short story `It Had to be Murder' (penned under the name William Irish), director Alfred Hitchcock takes his long-time obsession with sexual voyeurism to an entirely new level. This time it revolves around a man left impotent, so-to-speak, from an accident (shown in the beginning in a photo from a car accident at a race track) which has left his leg broken and confines him to a wheelchair. The man's sole source of amusement and pleasure during the day (and occasionally in the evening) is intruding on his neighbors' privacy from the comfort of his apartment window and observing their daily lives. There are three frames in which the brilliant cinematography of the film is shaped. The first comes from the point-of-view of Mr. Hitchcock's motion-picture camera. The second is from Stewart's binoculars (only briefly) and his high-powered telephoto lens (meant of course to be sexually suggestive). And the third is straight from the window itself. Nearly every shot in Rear Window, with the exception of a few, are seen entirely from the point-of-view of James Stewart's character, Jeff. While confined in this solitary apartment building, the audience sees exactly what he sees; nothing more and nothing less. The audience is placed in the same emotional element as Jefferies, whether it is frustration, excitement, or fear. We are craning our necks just as he is to get even the tiniest glimpse of what we assume is taking place inside Thorwald's apartment - murder.

Yet at the same time we the audience struggle with ourselves. We are all fully aware that human beings are not infallible and therefore are easily susceptible to jumping to conclusion for whatever reasons or motives, whether it stems from prejudice, ignorance, or something else entirely. This makes Lars Thorwald a sympathetic villain in a way. Ironically, Jefferies who jumps to the conclusion that Thorwald is guilty of murdering his own wife without any circumstantial evidence to prove it cautions Detective Doyle ""Careful, Tom"", as he glances at the contents of Lisa's suitcase which contains pink lingerie as if to suggest that she will staying the night at his place. All the same however we are still left with a sense of uneasiness. The scene in which Lars confronts Lisa and physically assaults her in his apartment before the police arrive on the scene is the precise moment which proves his guilt to us. Some may suggest rather that it is the death of the `dog who knew too much' but there was no direct proof he committed this violent crime, though audiences are meant to believe he did.

Alfred Hitchcock brings up through the course of the film the analytical topic of `rear window ethics'. Is it right for a man or woman to spy on one's neighbor even if it turns out that the person is indeed guilt of murder? Jeff's girlfriend, Lisa, brings up this exact argument just when it seems as though their little investigation into the mysterious disappearance of Mrs. Thorwald has hit a dead-end. Then, moments later, a woman's scream is heard outside. The little dog which belonged to the couple living on the fire escape is found dead with its neck broken as if strangled. The distraught woman who owned the dog cries out, """"Which one of you did it? Which one of you killed my dog? You don't know the meaning of the word 'neighbor.' Neighbors like each other, speak to each other, care if anybody lives or dies, but none of you do"", as if to directly counter Lisa's argument a few minutes earlier.

Nearly as entertaining and enthralling as the murder mystery which ultimately shapes the main course of the picture, the distinctive subplots of the assorted neighbors surrounding L.B. Jefferies's apartment building stands as one of director Alfred Hitchcock's finer touches in Rear Window. The set itself is simply breathtaking. An impressive feat of engineering and filmmaking, it was built entirely within the confines of a Paramount studio soundstage with several of the apartments themselves fully furnished. Georgine Darcy, for example, who plays the exquisitely sensual Miss Torso, used her apartment as if it were her real home, relaxing in between takes. Her character of course was the most blatant examples in this Rear Window of Hitchcock willfully taunting the Production Code, although there were plenty more besides this one background character. The director nonetheless enjoyed nearly every minute of it. In order to get around the complication of filming a leering depiction of Miss Torso, Hitchcock shot her scenes in three ways - one topless, one with her wearing white undergarments, and the other with her wearing black undergarments. Playing all three versions off the Production Code, he was able to keep intact all the scenes he intended for her by making it appear as though one version was less sexually suggestive then the other two.

In addition to Miss Torso, there is one scene in particular in which Lisa proposes to Jeff that she be allowed to spend the night in his apartment is oozing with double entendres. While proving to him that she can live out a suitcase like he can she retorts, ""I'll bet yours isn't this small?"" And as she exposes the contents of her little suitcase, ""Compact, but, uh, ample enough"", pink lingerie is revealed. The daunting eloquence of Grace Kelly makes this scene all the more erotically charged.

Two subplots which ultimately converge, to quote the insurance nurse Stella, like `two taxis on Broadway' and shift from agonizing heartbreak to emotional euphoria are those of the Composer and Miss Lonelyheart. Miss Lonelyheart's introduction is truly lamentable with her enacting a scene in which a gentlemen caller pays her a visit, complete with fine wine for toasting, while in the distance Jefferies raises a glass of wine toasting her as Lisa prepares an intimate dinner in the background. This of course is all perfectly ironic, demonstrating Jefferies's emotional distance from Lisa and his inability to commit to her, choosing instead to immerse himself in his `rear window' world as he has done for the past six weeks. Adding to the paradox, Bing Crosby's `To See You Is To Love You' plays in the distance as Miss Lonelyheart snaps back to reality, realizes she is alone, and buries her head in her arms and weeps.

The next we see of both the Composer and Miss Lonelyheart, alcohol is heavily involved (the Composer staggers into his apartment drunk and Miss Lonelyheart takes several stiff drinks before leaving her apartment searching for male company). In yet another slight tinge of irony, Lisa starring out the window of the apartment listening to a tune on the wind says, ""Where does a man get inspiration to write a song like that?"" The Composer is playing the tune called `Mona Lisa' just as Miss Lonelyheart is sexually assaulted by a man who she proceeds to toss out of her apartment and then collapses on her couch weeping. The scene and tune itself can be interpreted two ways - for the Composer it is instantly identified with the famous painting by Leonardo Da Vinci (considered his muse) while for Miss Lonelyheart it is linked with the lyrics of the Nate King Cole song of the same name which references sexual assault.

Her suicide attempt (complete with suicide note, Bible, and an overdose of sleeping pills) at the precise moment Jefferies is calling Thorwald's apartment to warn Lisa of his impending return make Jefferies next move (should he call the police in order to stop Miss Lonelyheart from killing herself or try and save the woman he supposedly loves by warning her of Lars Thornwald's return to the apartment) all the more intense. It culminates with Miss Not-So-Lonelyheart paying the Composer a visit whose song he has been composing all this time and what ultimately stopped her from taking her own life.

Of course there is nothing humorous about a cute little dog having its neck broken but if one could find some amusement in this scene then it would have to be Lisa's line upon realizing that the dog was digging up something in Thornwald's garden, ""Maybe he knew too much"". This of course is a jab at Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Much (Stewart in interviews referred to the little pup as `The Dog Who Knew Too Much), a remake of which he was currently working on to start James Stewart.

As Jefferies explains to Stella, his insurance nurse, he's not ready for marriage and that Lisa, his girlfriend, is too `Park Avenue' for his lifestyle, as he puts it a `camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank', he stares into an apartment where a newlywed couple has just moved. From this moment on until the end of the film, every time Jefferies looks toward their apartment window either the shades are closed or the husband in his underwear sticks his head outside to get a breath of fresh air only to be called back by his sexually unquenchable newlywed wife. The irony of this couple is that when the husband announces to his newlywed wife at the end of the film that he is quitting his job, the honeymoon is officially over, both literally and figuratively, leaving her to exclaim to him, ""But if you'd told me you quit your job, we wouldn't have gotten married"". In contrast to the relationship between Jefferies and Lisa, it leaves their future together rather open ended, especially if these two lovebirds are already having marital troubles.

Whether or not Jefferies and Lisa wind up together and the rest of their neighbors find some sort of happiness is entirely irrelevant. Hitchcock believed (or so he said in interviews) that the characters and the story ended when the film ended. What is for certain however is the brilliance of this film. The performances are top-notch (easily the best in Grace Kelly's sadly short-lived film career and one of the best in James Stewart's lengthy career as an actor), the script is intricately woven with meaningful subplots and wrought with tension and excitement, and director Alfred Hitchcock is at the top of his game. You couldn't ask for anything more. Rear Window is without a doubt Alfred Hitchcock's best motion picture of his career, if not the best of the 1950s.",1144713600,7,10179,4.871824480369515

The film owes a lot to script, Edith Head, scenic design, James Stewart, Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey and Raymond Burr. Grace Kelly is visually right, but her speaking voice is phony and a letdown.

227995,5,6300183513,"Where can one begin to sing the praises of Rear Window? Is it the two leading performances (James Stewart & Grace Kelly)?, the wonderfully absorbing narrative? or the immensely claustrophobic cinematography?

Answer: all of the above. very rarley there appears a film which manages to encapsulate every ingredient required to culminate into a top rate suspense thriller. Rear Window is the king of kings in suspense with a little romance and humour thrown in.

Rear Window was the second of four collaberations between Alfred Hitchcock and james Stewart and in my opnion is the best. The gratitude that Stewart shows is reflected in his portrayl of the no nonsense snapper who, despite dominating the picture, you never tire of the sight of Stewart in his blue PJ's peering out over the courtyard at the array of characters the director treats us with.

The film centres around travelling photographer L.B. Jeffries (Jeff) played by James Stewart, who as a result of an accident, is temporarely confined to a wheel chair with a broken leg and in order to stave off immense boredom, peers nonchallantly into the windows of his Greenwich village neighbours apartments. What he sees to be innocent, slightly eccentric characters ('miss hearing-aid') there is one apartment which holds a suspicious fascination for Jeff and that is of salesman Lars Thorwald (played brilliantly by Raymond Burr with a frightening and both pathetic and desperate angle.)

His determination to prove that Thorwald murdered his disabled wife despite objections from his detective friend (Wendell Corey) is intertwined with an array of interesting and spectacularly original characters such as the afore mentioned Grace Kelly as Jeff's socialite girlfriend 'Lisa Freemont', whose passion for Jeff is only matched by his apprehension and the doubts about the relationship and it's uncertain future. The insurance nurse with the sharpest tongue in fifties cinema played by Thelma Ritter who seems to share the directors thirst for the macabre.

All this ends in one of the most nail-biting endings Hitchcock has ever created in use of lighting and montage in his piecing together of the scene.

There seems to be numerous sub-texts which appear in the film, (the nieghbours dilemma's seem to outline the possible outcomes of Jeff's relationship with Lisa). However, put aside the ins and outs of Hitchcocks mind because you will only scratch the surface, and instead marvel at the sheer brilliant cinema at which every shot portrays from the 'jazzy' opening credits to the delightful closing offering.

227999,5,6300183513,"""Rear Window"" (alongside ""Psycho"") is universally regarded as Hitchcock's masterpiece and perhaps rightly so. There's something unique about this film which becomes harder to recreate as the years go by and we are hit left and right with silly special effects.

So what is cinema but the opportunity it gives us to look into other people's lives? That is, by definition, in some way or another, true for most films. ""Rear Window"" takes that premise to the extreme. Well, if you live in the 50s, have just broken a leg and your place happens to have a big window through which you can spy on your entire neighborhood, there's not much else you can do, is there?

At least that's what Jeffrey (again, magnificiently played by James Stewart) thinks, even more so when he becomes convinced that one of his neighbors (Raymond Burr, of ""Perry Mason"" fame) has killed the wife. The trick here is that Hitchcock places us right next to Jeffrey the whole time. We get no more information than he has and we are kept guessing all the way through.

The plot only gets thicker as it goes along and fortunately for him Jeffrey can share his concerns with his girlfriend Lisa (played by the beautiful Grace Kelly) and his maid, who helps him with the house duties in his time of need. Obviously both of the women grow increasingly worried with the proceedings, with Lisa even managing to get herself in danger on a desperate attempt to solve the big mystery.

I have trouble thinking of a genre that has more power to keep the viewer on the edge of his seat. But as with everything, it has to be done right. Can you think of a better director for the job, though?",1128729600,3,1649,4.542087542087542

Too many anachronistic bits got in the way for me, I just couldn't connect. The movie's coloring was so brash as to suggest colorization in many places, even though I withold that charge. The whole premise, of in-home care paid for by the insurance company (!) and of six weeks' incapacitation for a broken leg - well, that was all long before the 'walking cast'. Even Ms. (sorry, Miss) Torso in the window across the street, she was built like a futbolista, like a powerful woman in command of her body. She was - she was a dancer, but that was back when dancers were superb athletes first, not a DSM IV category.

Grace Kelly did a lot to illustrate the vision of 'glamor' of the 1950s. She may also have done a fair bit to demonstrate how a proper lady may express her serious intent to a gentleman, inviting herself for an overnight visit, showing her preparatations, and dang the nosy visitors. Maybe back then it was risque (or worse). Today it would scarcely raise an eyebrow, more likely a smile wishing the best to both. If the lesson is still needed anywhere, this is the very best of how a girl may present her interests to a boy without pretense and with allure.

All the McGuffins got to me, though. The newlyweds, the composer-for-hire, the dancer, even ""Miss Lonelyheart."" I guess I've gotten used to a denser style of story-telling in the half-a-hundred years since this movie came out. It's good, but there are other Hitchcocks that I like lots better.

She, of course, leads the way in the dangerous murder probe they set out upon. It's to Hitchcock's credit that he had Kelly believe Stewart's story almost from the start, so we don't have to endure his trying to convince her it's true. (It also allows the picture to focus on its single point: she's no mamby-pamby and can do anything Stewart can.) The early going is rather slow - only the snappy dialogue saves it, though the suspense builds nicely near the end.

228033,5,6300183513,"This is a superlative film of suspense. It is a tribute to the direction of Alfred Hitchcock that one is never bored watching this film, though it entirely takes place within the confines of a claustrophobic New York Greenwich Village apartment, the windows of the neighbors across the way, and a courtyard that separates the buildings.

Professional photographer L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart) is recovering from an accident that occurred while on assignment. Encased in a cast covering his left leg and hip, Jeff is pretty much immobilized and temporarily confined to a wheel chair. Despite regular visits by his nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter), and his beautiful, sophisticated girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly), Jeff is chafing at his confinement. Bored stiff, he does what he does best. He peers at those around him from his window. Jeff finds the lives of his neighbors both immensely interesting and amusing. He watches them through their windows and in the courtyard, enhancing his experience with binoculars and the zoom lens of his camera. Jeff draws inferences and conclusions about them, based upon his own experiences with human behavior.

This interest intensifies and takes a strange turn, when he believes one of them, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), may have committed a grisly murder, killing off his invalid wife, Anna. Though Jeff never actually sees the murder, what he does see is its aftermath and some peculiar behavior that puzzles him. Putting two and two together, he becomes absolutely convinced that his neighbor across the way has done away with his invalid wife. Jeff then informally involves his friend, Lt. Thomas Doyle (Wendell Corey) of the New York City Police Department, who initially scoffs at Jeff's assessment, though he does a cursory check . With Lisa and Stella also becoming fascinated by the strange behavior of Lars Thorwald, their interest and amateur sleuthing propels the film to an exciting climax.

Jimmy Stewart is terrific as the housebound voyeur, drawing the viewer in with him. One finds oneself peering along with him into the lives of those around him. Grace Kelly is stunningly beautiful as Jeff's girlfriend Lisa, with whom Jeff is finding it difficult to make a commitment. It is interesting that as Jeff gets more intimately engrossed in his neighbors' affairs, his intimacy with Lisa seems to grow, drawing them closer together. Thelma Ritter is funny and sassy as the tough talking, no nonsense nurse. Raymond Burr, looking eerily as he would half a century later, is well cast as the neighbor whose wife got on his nerves. Wendell Corey is very good as the congenial, though jaded, detective.

All in all, this is a terrific film that clearly shows the mastery and deft direction of the legendary Hitchcock. With a well written script and a stellar cast, this is a film that is well worth having in one's personal collection. Bravo!",1124236800,5,2897,5.067085953878407

From his rear window, he is able to look out in the courtyard of the apartments around him and into the windows of other apartments.

During the course of his vicarious living, he becomes suspicious about a neighbor and comes to believe that he is a murderer but nobody at first will believe him. Gradually, others come around but danger looms when the crook realizes that he is being watched.

This has become something of a signature role for Jimmy Stewart. He gives a very creditable performance with only a single flaw. He is bored with life and bored with his adoring, socialite, beautiful and intelligent girlfriend, played by Grace Kelly. He displays ebullient, angry, pensive, playful and sarcastic moods well but he never quite manages to be convincing when he is bored with Grace Kelly. No one is that good an actor!

Jeffries (James Stewart) is in a wheelchair and housebound while waiting for his broken leg to heal. His only visitors are his girlfriend Lisa Freemont (Grace Kelly)and his unsympathetic, wisecracking nurse Stella played by wonderful Thelma Ritter. With nothing to do and limited visitors Jeffries spends his time looking out of his apartment rear window and into the windows of his neighbors. As he looks, he finds himself drawn into their lives. The woman who nags her traveling salesman husband, the newlyweds who keep their window shade down at all times except when they occasionally come up for air; the beautiful young ballet dancer who practices everyday, the unsuccessful composer, the older couple with the little dog who does nothing but bark and middle-aged woman Jeffries has dubbed ""Miss Lonelyhearts."" Miss Lonelyhearts lives alone but sets her dinner table for two and holds conversations with her make imaginary lover.

When Jeffries relates the daily goings on to his girlfriend Lisa, she chastises him for being a voyeur and invading his neighbors privacy. Jeffries nurse Stella notes that ""We've become a race of Peeping Toms. What people ought to do is get outside their own house and look in for a change."" Nevertheless Jeffries continues watch. He now uses his binoculars and his always by his side camera. Then he notices that the salesman's nagging wife is not only quiet but absent from the scene. What happened to her? Jeffries watches the salesman as he appears to cautiously leave his apartment in the middle of the night. Why is he sneaking out of his own home? Why is the salesman cleaning knives and a saw, what where they used for? What was in the trunk that he had shipped? Jeffries is convinced that the salesman has killed his wife. He sets out to prove it. He enlists the help of a friend, Thomas Doyle (Wendall Corey) who is a lieutenant in the police department. Jeffries also believes that the salesman, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) has killed his neighbors small dog because the dog was digging in the garden for something that the salesman had buried. He wants Doyle to investigate even there is no evidence that this is true.

As with all Alfred Hitchcock movies, you can always find humor just below the surface. In REAR WINDOW Jeffries says, ""He killed a dog last night because the dog was scratching around in the garden. You know why? Because he had something buried in that garden that the dog scented."" Doyles response is ""Like an old hambone?"" Jefferies says ""I don't know what pet names Thorwald had for his wife.""

When Jeffries can't get help from Doyle he persuades Lisa and Stella to help him get some answers. They dig in Thorwald's garden and break into his home. It doesn't matter how often you watch this film you still hold your breath and want to shout ""get out, get out"", when Lisa is searching Thorwald's apartment and he walks in. This is good stuff.

228040,5,6300183513,"It doesn't have the psychological complexity or panoramic sweep of his later films, but 1954's ""Rear Window"" is arguably his most fun film to watch. An entire Greenwich Village apartment complex and courtyard was built inside a Paramount studio building to create Hitchcock's unforgiving microcosm of lonely souls that stretches the ethical envelope of voyeurism. James Stewart plays L.B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies, an adventure photographer, wheelchair-bound with a week left in his cast for a broken leg. He is itching for some excitement and not even the devoted attention of an impossibly beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa, a Park Avenue fashion model is enough for him. Stuck in his apartment all day, he sees the comings and goings of his neighbors, all strangers to him, and pieces together their lives and gives them pseudonyms like ""Miss Torso"" and ""Miss Lonelyhearts"".  But his attention focuses on a suspicious, white-haired man named Thorwald. Jeff becomes increasingly intrigued by his neighbor's odd behavior and the sudden disappearance of his nagging, bedridden wife. Jeff suspects a murder plot, which seems far-fetched at first, but becomes gradually more evident as his obsession infects Lisa, his masseuse Stella and his detective buddy Tom.

Hitchcock was indeed the master of suspense, but the movie is suffused with an unexpectedly light sense of humor that touches rather candidly on sex and relationships thanks to John Michael Hayes' sharp script.  Lisa's entanglement with Thorwald is played out well, especially as Jeff looks on helplessly from his apartment. Stewart is wonderfully sly throughout, giving hints of the inner torment he displays later in ""Vertigo"" but still likeable even as he tries to reject his glamorous, sheltered girlfriend. Kelly seems merely decorative at first, but she sharpens as her character gains a fearless sense of intrigue that Jeff finds alluring. Thelma Ritter plays a smarter and warmer variation of her typical wisecracker as Stella, while Wendell Corey is his usual nondescript stalwart self as Tom. Raymond Burr, pre-Perry Mason, shows up as Thorwald and lends interesting ambiguity to his menacing character.  Robert Burks' probing camerawork makes the perfect complement to Hitchcock's trademark filmmaking style, and special mention needs to be given to Robert A. Harris's splendid 1998 work in restoring the film's original splendor, even the slow-motion first kiss between Stewart and Kelly. The DVD has a couple of nice extras, an hour-long documentary that focuses on the ethics behind the story and the restoration effort, and a brief interview with screenwriter Hayes.

228065,5,6300183513,"This terrific thriller from Alfred Hitchcock about our fear of intimacy and tendency toward voyeurism starring Jimmy Stewart and  the lovely Grace Kelly is one of his most entertaining films. There are no crop dusters or other devices to provide the tension this time and it works in the film's favor. Rear Window is a more character driven film and the suspense builds slowly to a fever pitch, a bonafide grab the edge of your seat nail biter. Hitchcock understood that most people are more comfortable looking at the lives of others from a distance and explores this area of our personalities in a very enjoyable fashion.

Jeff (Jimmy Stewart) is a professional photographer laid up in a cast due to an accident while on assignment and Grace Kelly is his doting girlfriend. We should all be so lucky. But Jeff is feeling claustrophobic, not only about his situation but about his relationship with Lisa (Kelly), whose patience and elegant charm as she tends to his needs and waits for him to ask her to marry him are put to the test. The no nonsense practicality of his nurse Stella  (Thelma Ritter) makes for great entertainment as Jeff is bored and begins watching his neighbors across the courtyard through the lens of his camera.

Jeff becomes involved in their lives like he is watching a daily soap opera, much to the disapproval of Lisa. He takes to heart their loneliness and finds pleasure in their finer moments. But something darker begins to take shape when Jeff begins to piece together what he has seen in one apartment and fears he may be spying on a killer. Both Lisa and his cop pal Lt. Doyle (Wendell Corey) think someone is letting their imagination run wild, at least in the beginning.

His own disbelief and Lisa's early scorn turns into an obsession that becomes evermore dangerous for all of them as Lisa begins to believe him and becomes his legs. But the man who may have murdered his wife may believe Jeff has seen too much, putting all their lives in danger. Hitchcock uses his own lens to show the voyeuristic climate Jeff has become comfortable with dangerously changing to a one on one confrontation.

This is wonderful entertainment. It moves deftly from a light and breezy beginning to a more concerned tone, graduating to heart pounding suspense. This is a teriffic and enjoyable film and one of Hitchcock's best. Raymond Burr as the possible murderer creates terror just by his glance across the courtyard at the spying Stewart. Kelly and Ritter give this film its footing, making the events completely believable.

But it is Jimmy Stewart who hits this one out of the park to dead center. He gives one of his finest performances, conveying the irritation of being in a cast and the emotional helplessness when he may not be able to escape the consequences of his own voyeurism because of it. You'll watch this one many times over. A great film to pop in the vcr late on a rainy night. Don't miss it.",1113004800,5,2936,4.689320388349515

Hitchcock involves us in this deligthful satyre with all the discrete elegance and extreme good manners. Don' t ever consider  our starring is a vulgar Peeping Tom. How can you dare?  He is simply a man who is wound and unable to displace, and by this cause his only hobby consists just in taking a little bit around here and there. The illusion through the window is basically the same experience between the viewer and the screen. Window and screen mean the possibility of watching other different realities from the other side of the street.

Someway Hitchcock suggestively reminds us but always keeping a discrete distance .

But that hazardous Peeping Tom activity has its risks and demands its prize. This occurs when he is the involuntary eyewitness of a murder. And suddenly our beloved friend becomes hunted due its hobby.

The rest runs for you my dear reader. A love affair is the secondary argumental line and the huge stage of several open windows seem to work out as a multiple stage. So the camera is a nervous eye until the moment our hero is watched by the assasin. The camera wil be introspective from this moment, and in this case it will be an impotent and mude witness of an unfair and furious human chase.

228068,5,6300183513,"Alfred Hitchcock was in near-perfect form when he made ""Rear Window,"" a stylish, minimalistic blend of mystery and dark comedy. This thriller explores ""what you shouldn't see"" skilfully, with a few funny bits thrown in. And having a cast that includes Grace Kelly and James Stewart doesn't hurt either.

Photographer L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries (Stewart) got run over during a shoot, and is crankily waiting for his cast to come off. While he does so, he spies on his neighbors -- some sleep on balconies, some argue, some weep alone, and some (""Miss Torso"") dance in spandex. To make things worse, Jeff is having intimacy problems with his wealthy girlfriend Lisa (Kelly), because he fears settling down.

But then Jeff's window-watching clues him in to something -- sickly Mrs. Thorwald vanishes, and her husband Lars (Raymond Burr) is seen acting suspiciously with a saw, rope and metal case. Jeff becomes convinced that Thorwald has murdered his wife. He manages to convince Lisa and his down-to-earth nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter), but detectives won't believe him. So without moving from the room, Jeff uses the rear window to watch Thorwald -- and find out what really happened.

Okay, peeping on your neighbors is not just creepy, it's illegal. In the case of ""Rear Window,"" that fact doesn't really matter. Watching the fellow tenants is as much fun as the mystery itself, whether it's the newlyweds, the pair that sleep on the balcony, the weepy Ms. Lonelyheart, or the buxom dancer Miss Torso. It makes the story even more chilling when you realize that one -- or maybe more than one -- of these seemingly harmless people is a murderer.

Hitchcock -- who appears as a musician -- kept his deft touch in a movie that could have sunk like a stone. All the action takes place in one room, but he keeps it from feeling confining. Instead, the minimalistic set takes away all distractions, and makes the interplay between the characters even brighter. And much of the humor is provided by Ritter -- she's not a comic character, but her homespun wisdom is delivered with tart humor.

Jeff is likable as only James Stewart could make him -- this guy is bored, crabby and in denial about his feelings for Lisa, but he's likable despite that. Kelly does an equally solid job as the ""girl who is too good for him,"" who also proves that in a pinch she can rise beyond her uptown-girl roots. Back when many women were relegated to side roles, Lisa gets to be an equal detective to Stewart.

""Rear Window"" gives a view into one of Hitchcock's best films, a taut thriller about how, if you watch other people, you might see something dangerous. A well-deserved classic.",1110153600,,2658,4.77995642701525

The plot is just so fascinating and well done.  I also saw ""Vertigo"" for the first time recently, but I definitely like this classic Hitchcock movie better.  The story in ""Rear Window"" held my attention; and the climax, for me at least, was much more suspenseful than the climax in ""Vertigo"".  I highly recommend this movie!

228071,3,6300183513,"""Rear Window"" is an excellent thriller by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock.  All throughout the film, the audience becomes a willing accomplice to a peeping tom.  The audience watches the main character's nieghbors right alongside the main character.

L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart) is confined to a wheelchair due to a bad accident in which Jeffries nearly lost his life.  It was a car accident, occuring as Jeffries tries to get a picture of a car racing, but the race car ends up coming apart just as Jeffries takes his picture.

Needless to say, Jeffries gets injured and his camera gets broken.  He has broken his leg, preventing him from being able to get out of his apartment.  These days, when that happens, someone might take to spending his time watching television.  However, this film takes place in the 50's, when television was just coming into it's own.  As a matter of fact, at the time, advertising companies generally were not agreeing with thier clents as to whether or not to advertise on television.  The advertising companies thought television was doomed.

Hence we have the reason why Jeffries ends up spending his time watching the nieghbors.  He has nothing else to do.  He makes up his own name for each of them.  There is a woman he calls Miss Torso, who dances all the time.  There is Miss Lonelyhearts , who cries herself to sleep every night.  Then there is the travelling salesman, who Jeffries becomes very concerned about.

Turns out the salesman's wife is bed-ridden.  Then why is no one paying attention to her?  Why is it the salesman is wrapping such bizarre things as knives, and in newspaper?

The film is certered around this mystery, and the audience becomes a peeping tom themselves as they try to unravel the mystery alongside Jeffries.

What I am trying to point out here is that the film is entertaining, but, like all Hitchcock films, it requires a different sort of attention span than a modern day film does.  Sure, the film is about the same length as modern films usually are, but ;modern films have to have something exciting happen often, something usually in which the main character's life is threatened.  Take for example ""I Robot.""  The character played by Will Smith cannot go more than twenty minutes before he has problems with the androids in that movie.

Unlike ""I Robot"" ""Rear Window"" has the ability to just focus on the mystery and the development of the characters it has.  This is not to say that the film is not interesting.  Trying to unravel the mystery to ""Rear Window"" is fun, even though it means becoming a nieghborhood watchdog like Jeffries.

Also, considering the year the film was made, the portrayal of the woman in the film is somewhat sympathetic, like in other Hitchcock classics including ""The Man Who Knew too Much.""  Films from around the time, such as""The Three Faces of Eve"" have a tendency to look at all semi- strong woman as either loony or dangerous.  ""Rear Window,"" however, has a very sympathetic strong female character in the form of Lisa (Grace Kelly).  She goes with the nurse to dig up the plot of ground Jeffries believes the wife is buried in.  She is the one who goes and gives Mr. Thorwald's apartment (Raymond Burr, known to television audiences as Perry Mason) and even breaks intoThorwald's apartment, an event that becomes pivotal to the story in a way I will not mention, through a second story window while wearing high-heels.

In other words, the women of the story make up for Mr. Jeffries' weakness.

These are all reasons why ""Rear Window"" has stood the test of time.  Although there are also other reasons, the film is fun to watch if you don't have to have something exciting happen every few minutes in order for the film to keep your attention.  The mystery to the film makes watching ""Rear Window"" a lot of fun.",1107302400,2,3842,4.724812030075188
228072,5,6300183513,"""Here lie the broken bones of L.B. Jeffries.""  That's what's been written on the plaster cast on the aforementioned Jeffries, an ace photographer who's been in a wheelchair for seven weeks because he got too close during a race car match.

Jeffries is bored and listless, but at least his days in limbo gives him a view of life's passing parade through his binoculars, namely the other tenants whom he can see through his window.  The show's starring attraction is Miss Torso, a blonde buxom ballet dancer who can be seen shaking her thing and wearing nice pink bikinis-Jeffries expression on seeing her is priceless.  (Yes, she is nice, isn't she?) The songwriter who's lost his muse, a pair of newlyweds, a couple with a dog who fight the hot summer heat by sleeping on their balcony, and Miss Lonelyheart, a single woman who undergoes the being single blues.  However, during a particularly sleepless night, he notices how Mr. Thorvald, a jewelry salesman with an invalid wife, goes in and out of his apartment three times during the late hours, returning once with a large saw.  Why hasn't he been in his wife's bedroom all day?  ""Something's terribly wrong,"" he surmises.

Jeffries is also going through a bit of a crisis with his girlfriend Lisa Freemont, and they are quite a pair.  He's more a rough action-type of guy, having served in the war, going on tough assignments on one suitcase, entering tough situations, while she's ""too perfect,"" having that chic, ultrasophisticated, rarified Park Avenue ambience, never wearing the same dress twice.  Jeffries is thinking that he wants someone too ordinary, someone who can bear up to his way of life if she wants to come along.  He's the old-fashioned type who thinks that ""nothing has caused the world more trouble than intelligence,"" and goes on to discuss how psychoanalysis and interpretation of different emotional levels as examples.

It takes the goings-on of the Thorwald apartment to draw the strained couple together, as Lisa uses her feminine intuition to realize that indeed a woman wouldn't leave such an expensive handbag, jewelry, and her wedding ring behind if she was going to leave on a long trip.  However, feminine intuition and Jeffries' speculations don't convince his war buddy and now detective Tom Doyle, who does some digging around to humor Jeffries and finds out the wife isn't dead.  And the final half hour, after a dramatic incident, when Lisa, Jeffries, and the latter's insurance-provided nurse Stella all join in and decide to brashly throw caution to the wind, that the excitement rises to a fever pitch.

Rear Window's also one of the many New York films, showing the apartment life of the tenants as seen through Jeffries, played superbly by James Stewart in his second Hitchcock film, the other being Rope (1948), the next one to be the tepid remake of The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), and later, another classic, Vertigo (1958).

Like Stewart, this was Grace Kelly's second of three Hitchcock films, the other two being Dial M For Murder and To Catch A Thief.  As Lisa Fremont, she gives one of her cold ice princess roles.  She looks elegant in her pink nightgown, and dresses well, but she provides a shot of audacity herself in the final half hour.
And Thelma Ritter does another great turn as Stella, giving her usual wisecracking schtick as a supplement to James Stewart's flippancy.  She tells of her talent as a foreteller of bad things, saying of the Wall Street crash, ""When GM has to go the bathroom ten times a day, the whole country has to let go.""  The other two players worth mentioning is Judith Evelyn as Miss Lonely Heart and as guilty pleasure/eye candy, Georgine Darcy as Miss Torso.  And it's Raymond Burr (Perry Mason, Ironside) as Mr. Thorvald himself.

One of Hitchcock's all-time classics, and one of my favourite personal four, the others being Spellbound, Vertigo and The Birds.",1107129600,,3902,4.862537764350453

However, this can be a more demanding movie to watch than some may expect. Obviously, this film is largely psychological and thus requires effort to watch. And it is also really slow, although it is ingenious, precise, and somewhat formal in its development.

228096,5,6300183513,"""Rear Window"" is an extraordinarily clever movie. Though a thriller, it is fun to watch.  Alfred Hitchcock must have relished making it. RW is special in that there is only one location- Jimmy Stewart's rear-facing apartment. The ensuing claustrophobic effect only adds to the charm. Jimmy plays a big time ""Life Magazine"" photographer, laid up with a broken leg. With too much time on his hands, he spies on his neighbors in the building across the courtyard. What an assortment of cameras!  And what an assortment of characters! Each window holds a story. Just imagine the choreography the director had to manage. The ""neighbors"" include the struggling musician with strange friends and stranger parties, Miss Lonely Hearts, Miss Torso, the newlyweds, the couple with the little dog (!), and the man with the sickly wife. The husband, Raymond Burr, gives Stewart bad vibes right away. Some bizarre actions-and sounds (!)- emanating from that apartment leads Stewart to believe that Burr has killed the wife and disposed of her in a suitcase. In 1954, Burr still was cast as a bad guy. The problem is that no one listens to Jimmy. His ravishing girlfriend (Grace Kelly), his physical therapist (Thelma Ritter) and his detective buddy, (Wendell Corey) all think Jimmy has gone stir crazy from inactivity. Suddenly, in a pivotal nighttime moment, Kelly believes him! Dressed to the nines, she actually breaks into Burr's apartment! This reviewer won't divulge the resolution but Hitchcock does a masterful job in resolving the kaleidoscopic sagas of the vanishing wife and those wonderful folks in the windows. How grateful we are that they kept their shades up.  (Most of the time) It's delightful to think about how many subplots this classic movie has. Many praise Stewart's work in RW but this reviewer would shed the spotlight on Kelly, the perfect uptown girl, icy and sexy all at the same time. Watch for that second story job in an expensive calf length dress! RW was nominated for Best Director and Best Screenplay but came away empty handed at Oscar time. Why it was not nominated for cinematography is a mystery- since RW is a photographic marvel Kelly did win the Oscar for her role in ""The Country Girl"".  The New York film Critics also bestowed on her their Best Actress Award for ""Rear Window"", ""The Country Girl"" and another Hitchcock classic-""Dial M for Murder"". 1954 was quite a year for Grace.  The Academy Awards may have passed RW by but movie fans should not. This is one of those films that get better with time and are more appealing on the fifth viewing than the first. The sheer visual effects alone mark RW as a jewel.",1103155200,2,2644,4.866666666666666
228097,5,6300183513,"Not only does REAR WINDOW (RW) have Alfred Hitchcock's trademark wit, suspense, and romance (with a touch of friction) in spades, but it's one of his most well-crafted, cleverly-staged movies; in fact, even though RW is based on a Cornell Woolrich story, I can't imagine this story being told as effectively in any medium other than cinema. However, the technical accomplishments (explained most entertainingly in the DVD's documentaries) would be nothing without the engaging characters. James Stewart's neighbors are interesting enough to warrant their own movies, and in addition to providing a wry microcosm of New York City life (the only dated thing about it is the lack of air conditioning), they all reflect possible outcomes for the somewhat stormy romance between laid-up shutterbug Stewart and the luminous Grace Kelly as his upscale fashion maven inamorata. As Brent Spiner said while hosting a showing of RW on TNT, the real perversion of the film is Stewart's reluctance to commit to the irresistible Kelly! In fact, one of the things I like about the movie is the way it shows these two very different people gradually learning to compromise and work together. The piquant final shot shows that a woman can have a happy relationship with a man without submerging her own personality -- refreshing for the 1950s! Great supporting cast, too, including Wendell Corey, Raymond Burr in one of his last bad-guy roles before PERRY MASON, and the scene-stealing Thelma Ritter.  Incidentally, the restored special edition RW DVD was put together just in time to include Georgine Darcy (""Miss Torso""), then one of the last surviving cast members.

It is one of the purest pieces of cinema ever created- Hitchcock is  amaster at telling the story through the camera lense (something directors often don't do!)

It works as a mysterey, it works as cinemographic art, it works because Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly are fine people to have in your living room- if only on the TV screen.",1096329600,2,528,4.36734693877551
228099,5,6300183513,"Why is Rear Window one of my favorite movies? Every time I see it I wonder and I come up with new things. One thing is outstanding and that is Jimmy Stewart. He is a photographer who broke his leg while on the job at a racing track. Strangely enough photos of the crash are in the opening scenes. Because he cannot move he is in his chair for the entire movie. The dialogue between him and his nurse is superb, especially the nurse has some great lines.

He is dating the beautiful Grace Kelly who he thinks is just to perfect for him but she doesn't seem to mind. The dialogue between them sounds like that between two people who have known each other for a while. Words that bystanders might find horrible but they are perfectly happy with.

While sitting in his chair Stewart has a chance to look outside his rear window at what is going on outside. There is a dancing lady, a composer, a sunbathing woman, a single woman and a just-married couple. This by the way for a long time was the biggest inside set ever built for a movie.  The thing he notices most however is a married couple and the story will be about them, since he thinks the man has killed the woman and is trying to get rid of the body everywhere. At first no one believes him, especially his friend a police officer. But the evidence gets more and more certain and more people start believing him, leading to a very tense end scene of the movie. This is of course, still a Hitchcock film.

The great thing is that even as a viewer you are convinced that Stewart is wrong, he just seems to be a sad wheelchair bound man that can't wait for another week before the cast can come off. He scratches himself with a backscratcher while making crazy assumptions based on the scarce things he sees at the other side.

It's a very funny movie too and that is especially in the dialogues between the people. An example: Gunderson: It's about time you got married, before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man. Jeff : Yeah, can't you just see me, rushing home to a hot apartment to listen to the automatic laundry and the electric dishwasher and the garbage disposal and the nagging wife...  Gunderson: Jeff, wives don't nag anymore. They discuss.  Jeff : Oh, is that so, is that so? Well, maybe in the high-rent district they discuss. In my neighborhood they still nag.

Rear Window is, together with North by Northwest, my favorite Hitchcock movie. It is well-acted, incredibly funny and of course has a great and unexpected ending.",1096243200,,2500,4.431372549019608

Aside from his reluctance to engage with Lisa, there is at least one crucial moment in the film when he remains inactive even though there are avenues of action open to him.

There's something claustrophobic about what is essentially a movie set.  We are stuck in that lofty room with the big glass windows.  Jimmy Stewart peers across a courtyard and observes New Yorkers in their habitat.  When I was in elementary school we used to have projects called diorama's where we would take a shoebox and decorate it like a stage.  Each apartment in Hitch's diorama showcases a mostly silent vignette, the gorgeous dancer and her boyfriends, the lonely-heart middle-age lady, the sex crazed newlyweds, and the guy who kills his wife.

Stewart can watch all the fun, but with a broken leg, he can't leave the apartment to do anything about it.  Hence, the suspense centers on Stewarts inability to maneuver when his girlfriend, fashion gal, Grace Kelly breaks into the killers apartment to find clues.  We see the killer coming down the hall and Jimmy can't warn her from his perch.

Stewart and Kelly are interesting as a couple with opposite interests.  She's high fashion-society chick and he's a rough-it, world-traveling photographer.  These differences never resolve and Stewart appears maybe 15-20 years older than young marriage-scheming Grace.  The film is actually a stage play with stage play lighting and a who-dun-it plot.

Results --- [Entire world placing hands skyward.]  :)

Well that's not surprising. Put Jimmy and Grace together (in an Alfred Hitchcock flick no less!), and you can't help but to have a classic piece of motion picture entertainment.

One of the all-time great suspense films, ""Rear Window"" (1954) places us (the viewer) squarely in the shoes of L.B. Jefferies (Stewart), as he peers out his ""rear window"" at his courtyard neighbors. (BTW -- My spelling of ""Jefferies"" in this review IS correct. I've noticed ""Jefferies"" almost always being misspelled ""Jeffries"" (lacking an ""E"").  The spelling of Jeff's last name can easily be verified at the beginning of the movie, when the camera pans across his leg cast, revealing the words: ""Here lie the broken bones of L.B. Jefferies"". I assume that the filmmakers didn't deliberately have Jeff's last name misspelled on the plaster cast. Of course, I suppose that's always *possible*; but I fail to see a reason WHY they'd do it.)  :-)

Hitchcock lets the plot of the movie unfold in sections, building the suspense and drama with his usual superb efficiency and skill.  But ""Rear Window"", when you stop and think about it for a minute, doesn't really follow the same ""format"" as many (or most) other Hitchcock pictures -- in that we (the audience) are just as much in the dark about this possible ""murder"" across the courtyard as L.B. Jefferies is.  In many of the director's films, ""Hitch"" lets his viewing audience know, right up front, that there's a ""bomb under the table"" (to use Hitchcock's own example from his interviews).  But in ""Window"", Mr. H. doesn't give us much up front, and lets us discover things as they happen, right along with Jefferies.

There is one particular part of this movie that has always left me scratching my head, wondering why nothing was done about it during the course of the film. .... Near the beginning of the picture, just after Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) leaves Jeff's apartment, Mr. Jefferies hears a woman scream and hears glass breaking right after the scream.  Now -- my question is: WHY didn't Jeff tell his detective friend (Thomas J. Doyle) about having heard this ""scream and breaking glass"" when he called Doyle into the ""case"" a short time later? Such evidence would surely have gone a long way toward convincing Jeff's skeptical pal that something HAD indeed occurred across the yard. But this ""scream"" is never once mentioned in the movie.

But, even with this little ""hole"" in the plot (IMO), ""Rear Window"" remains near the top of my list of ""Best Hitchcock Films"".  Everything about it is impressive --- The small courtyard (which was actually custom-built right on the movie-studio's soundstage!); the kooky neighbors; the tension-filled storyline; Hitchcock's cameo in the ""songwriter's"" apartment; the radio playing in the background; the ""street sounds""; ""Miss Torso""; Jimmy Stewart's performance; Thelma Ritter as the sassy nurse; Grace Kelly for just being there; the mysterious trips with the suitcase; etc., etc.

This DVD comes under Universal's ""Collector's Edition"" label, and is packed with many first-rate extra features. Let's probe these, shall we? ..........

>> ""Rear Window Ethics"" is a 55-minute original documentary detailing the making of this Hitchcock classic and the restoration process undertaken to bring the film back to visual perfection for this first-ever DVD release. Very good documentary.

>> There is also a second featurette about the film, entitled ""Screenwriter John Michael Hayes On Rear Window"". This bonus lasts 13:10.

>> Photo Gallery. -- This gallery of production photos and advertising materials runs all by itself on its own timed track.  Music from the film plays as you watch the images go by.  The gallery CAN be paused for longer looks at each image.  Running time (without pausing) is 3:07.

>> Original Theatrical Trailer.

>> Re-release Trailers for 5 different Hitchcock films. -- Narrated by James Stewart.  Length: 6:15.

>> Text features with ""Production Notes"" and some biography pieces on the Cast & Crew.

Another small ""mini-bonus"" I kind of like is a video montage of Hitchcock movie clips when ""Play"" is selected from the Main Menu. This, however, can easily be bypassed quickly with an additional remote key stroke.

Video and Audio Specifications:

This color film is presented in an Anamorphic Widescreen format, and looks mighty fine thanks to the restoration efforts. The image is as clear and clean as we've ever seen it. The 2-channel Mono Dolby Digital soundtrack serves the material on screen adequately.

Ratio Talk .... The packaging says this DVD's Widescreen aspect ratio is 1.66:1. But, due to the inherent nature of the ""anamorphic"" transfer process (i.e.: the requirement of placing all anamorphically-enhanced DVD material inside a 16x9-shaped [1.78:1] area of the screen), the ratio of this movie (1.66:1) will be displayed on your TV in a somewhat wider-looking ratio (closer to the more commonly-utilized ratio for movies of 1.85:1).*

* = That is, if your TV is a ""standard"" set, with a 4x3-shaped screen, that also has the ability to perform the ""Anamorphic Squeeze"" function. But, if you watch this DVD on a ""Widescreen 16x9"" set, then the image should fill the entire screen (except for small ""pillarboxed"" bars on the left and right sides of the screen). But on some 16x9 TVs, these ""side bars"" aren't visible due to the ""overscan"".

In any event, the anamorphic image on this disc looks quite good, no matter how it's ultimately formatted onto your screen.

Also -- If you have a ""standard"" (4x3) TV with the ""16x9 Anamorphic Squeeze"" or ""Compression"" feature, and you decide you want to watch the film in its true ratio of 1.66:1, you can always turn off the ""compression"" feature on your TV and switch your DVD Player's settings to ""4x3 Letterbox"" mode. This combination of settings will allow the 1.66:1 aspect ratio to take shape on your TV screen (albeit with slightly less image clarity due to the ""Anamorphic"" feature being turned off).

A four-page booklet is included inside this DVD package, with a chapter listing on the back, plus some Production Notes and reproductions of five ""Rear Window"" lobby cards/posters.

Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" has stood the test of time for many decades, and will no doubt stand erect for many more to come.  If you like this movie, there's no better way to re-visit it than by indulging in this picture-perfect ""Collector's Edition"" DVD.",1084838400,7,6587,5.027598896044158
228131,5,6300183513,"I have always been a big fan of Alfred Hitchcock movies, but I have to say that Rear Window is one of my all time favorites.  It has all the elements of a great picture; A star studded cast with Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly, and Raymond Burr, suspense and intrigue, and even thought provoking dialog.
Jimmy Stewart is a photographer that has been laid up with a broken leg.  Unable to leave his apartment, he becomes board and has found that his only entertainment comes from watching his neighbors across the courtyard.  He becomes obsessive about a particular neighbor played by Raymond Burr whom he believes has committed murder.
With the help of his girlfriend, played by Grace Kelly, they set out to find the evidence they need to prove that the crime has actually been committed. Acting as his legs, Grace Kelly finds herself in some very dangerous situations, and all Jimmy Stewart can do is watch from his rear window.",1082937600,3,924,4.691358024691358
228132,5,6300183513,"Rear Window is just as suspenseful today as it was when it was first released back in 1954. Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly are perfect in this priceless piece of cinema. The movie is brilliantly shot with only one set. Most of the movie takes place in the point of view of Jimmy Stewart's apartment. One would think that a movie with no change in the scenery would be boring, but it's not. This movie, incredibly, keeps your attention throughout the whole story.

The suspense!!! This movie has some great suspense scenes in it that keep you on the edge of your seat (even if you've seen it a hundred times) Some great performances (Thelma Ritter and Raymond Burr top them off), wonderful writing, and of course, Hitchcock's direction make this a masterpiece that will be cherished always (at least by me).

The DVD is great. It's great to watch the movie with crystal clear clarity and in widescreen. Special features are always nice features too, but this DVD would be a deal even without any special features.",1082073600,,1011,4.674157303370786
228133,4,6300183513,"This is a great film that discusses the mystery of perception. James Stewart plays a photographer confined to a wheelchair, and, because he is bored, he voyeuristically examines the lives of his neighbors in the apartment building. We only see these neighbors through his eyes. Therefore, when he assumes that the man across the courtyard has murdered his invalid wife, at first no one wants to investigate his theory, especially his detective friend. But the clues seem to pile up, leading Stewart's girlfriend and nurse (a wonderfully witty role played by Thelma Ritter) to lure the man from his apartment to investigate further. The climax is powerful, true to Hitchcockian form.
Hitchcock's films are quite different from suspense films made today. The primary difference is the method in which Hitch crafts suspense. It's slow--on purpose. The climax is more powerful because the viewer builds up tension throughout the first 3/4 of the film. In this movie, Hitch's goal is not to shock or horrify viewers, but put them on the edge of their seats in anxious expectation of the climax. That, in my opinion, makes a great suspense thriller.",1081382400,3,1143,5.052910052910053
228134,5,6300183513,"This extremely dense and subtle film is assuredly one of Hitchcock's greatest achievements. Too intrepid for his own good, Jefferies pays dearly for his mistake: confined to a wheelchair in a small apartment, he becomes a prisoner and takes pleasure in the multiple visions that unfold in front of him. He soon lives only through these images, a slave of adventures he wants to understand even as they elude his grasp; he periodically contemplates another kind of spectacle, that of Lisa courting him with the same energy he himself manifests as an amateur detective. He gradually identifies with his neighbours, and Hitchcock frequently equals his viewers with Jefferies, letting us see exactly what he sees. The film has a lot to say on the interpretative reading of works of art, as Jefferies tends to accept events only so far as they confirm his own hypotheses. It is when he seemingly elucidates the Thorwald mystery that he goes too far and commits his hubristic mistake for a second time; the film thus ends as it started, with Jefferies stuck in his wheelchair and Lisa reading a fashion magazine. Both goth too involved in the images...",1081036800,,1146,4.912371134020619
228151,5,6300183513,"Undoubtedly one of the greatest movies he ever made, Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 masterwork ""Rear Window"" has certainly stood the test of times, and with good reason. Every little second of the film is to die for, from the opening credits to the long and breathtaking closeup of Grace Kelly to its breakneck conclusion, it's hard not to love it.
When photographer J.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries, played by Jimmy Stewart in one of his finest roles ever, breaks his leg, he is confined to his Greenwich Village apartment room and becomes fixated with the lives of his neighbors across the way from him. He soon expects that a mysterious salesman (played vigorously by Raymond Burr) may have murdered his annoying wife, he decides to do a little investigating - with the help of his gorgeous girlfriend Lisa Freemont (played by Grace Kelly in her finest role ever). It all leads up to a shocking conclusion that will linger in yout mind long after the end credits.
If you're a Hitchcok fan or just love movies, ""Rear Window"" will surely satisfy. I promise.",1080864000,,1039,4.777777777777778
228152,5,6300183513,"This film was always one of Hitchcock's finest.  There is nothing I could add to what has been said before in praise.
However, I question why the film was letterboxed when the original movie was shot with a ratio of 1.33:1 (or 4:3).  Paramount Pictures, in 1954, had not released anything in Vista Vision, their wide screen answer to Cinemascope. ""White Christmas"" would be the first to be released later that year in the new process.
After comparing the new DVD to my 1984 VHS tape, I noticed some striking discrepancies.  The most obvious were the shots when James Stewart looked through his camera viewfinder.  What he, and we, saw was a complete circle, with the image contained within the circle.  On the DVD, this circle is cropped at the top and bottom.  Why?
Also, during the DVD documentary on how the film was restored, a technician is seen holding the actual film.  It plainly shows the movie was shot in the common ratio of 1.33:1.  When before and after comparisons are shown, one can clearly see extra image at the top and bottom of the before shot.  Again, why letterbox?
For such a great film, my criticisms may seem of low importance.  I would just rather not see cropping like this happen to other restorations of great classics in the future.",1078531200,10,1261,4.63963963963964
228153,5,6300183513,"This is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films; one that is confined to only one set (much like his ""Lifeboat""). This is a tale about a professional photographer, LB ""Jeff"" Jeffries (James Stewart), who is confined to a wheelchair in his two-roomed flat. He passes time by looking out of his window into the courtyard that backs several small apartment buildings. Jeff even give nicknames to some of the neighbours he watches, mostly to keep absolute bordem at bay. But things aren't quite so bad; he has a nurse who comes in daily to take care of him. Her name is Stella (Thelma Ritter). She makes a casual reference to his being a peeping-tom could get him into trouble for seeing things that he shouldn't see. And, even better, Jeff has a lovely girlfriend, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), who is a number of years his junior. High-class and beautiful; Lisa doesn't care that Jeff is living from paycheque-to-paycheque. Eventually, Stella's warning comes true. Jeff discovers that a salesman (Lars Thorwald played by Raymond Burr), could very well be a murderer. He calls his friend, who is a policeman, to check out the situation. His friend can't; not without sufficient probable-cause. Many rather nasty things occur that Jeff sees but can't explain. He enlists the help of both Lisa and Stella.
I find that this film is very captivating and quite fast-paced. The ending is nail-biting. A must-see classic!",1078444800,2,1406,4.911764705882353

However, it is pleaseantly surprising.  The other residents of the complex made me laugh, cry, hate them, love them, all emotions at once.  the plot starts slowly and escalates to a very suspenseful climax and ends with a happily ever after type thing.

James Stewart over time has made me love his acting (from vertigo, rope, and other films) where he wants to explore more but is trapped by the accident which lays him in the cast. the movie is not all a myserty in the ""murder"" but the mystery in james stewarts life (with his job and his dating situation with grace kelly). but this is over commmed by suspicon which creates this film. hitchcock wants us to see only what james stewart sees which causes the audience not to be all knowning but curious at the characters and situtations. We tremble as we see james stewart sitting in the dark in his wheelchair looking out the window trying to direct grace kelly out of the ""murders"" apartment as he re entered since she was snooping. elements like that are everlasting to films and the audience. hitchcocks film rear window is a tribute to the inner selves on how they wanna know everything and will be willing to reach it by anymeans necessary. one of the top 100 films for your collection.",1076889600,,1221,4.554545454545455

228158,5,6300183513,"This old classic (with photographer James Stewart confined to his apartment with a cast on his leg and his girlfriend Grace Kelly providing legs for their sleuthing) never fails to satisfy. And it's really, really scary, especially the scene where the suspected murderer (Raymond Burr with menacing gaze and heavy brow) sees Kelly twiddling her finger behind her back, glances out the window and up, up, up to where Stewart is framed in his apartment window across the courtyard. Ridiculous, but even as I type this, I'm getting goosebumps.
The beauty of this film is the way it plays on the role of the voyeur. Stewart amuses himself by spying on his neighbors in the apartment buildings that surround his Greenwich Village courtyard - and we, the viewing audience, get to peek over his shoulder. It's incredibly titillating - until Burr's invalid wife goes missing.
Terrific cure for boredom, both Stewart's and ours, especially with the truly terrifying conclusion.",1073174400,3,968,5.09433962264151
228159,5,6300183513,"""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo"" have been referred to as Alfred Hitchcock's voyeuristic masterpieces with good reason.  The latter film relates to Jimmy Stewart playing a retired detective determined to make another woman into someone he believed had previously existed but never did, and was only a fictitious creation of her lover, who was a clever murderer.  Kim Novak, in one of her early efforts, played the dual role with just the proper measure of ethereal distance.
Four years before ""Vertigo"" previewed Hitchcock directed another powerful voyeuristic film with Stewart cast in the male lead, this time opposite another blonde bombshell, the future princess Grace Kelly.  Based on a story by master thriller author Cornell Woolrich, ""Rear Window"" is about a successful photographer who, after breaking his leg in an accident while covering an automobile race, is laid up in his Manhattan apartment.  In between visits from gorgeous socialite Kelly he whiles away his time observing his neighbors from the apartment building behind his own, separated by a courtyard.
Stewart lives as a voyeur, spending his time observing people like Miss Lonelyhearts, the woman who fixes herself candlelight dinners she shares with wine and music with imaginary love interests, a composer constantly at work at his piano, and a seductively constructed ballet dancer with a seemingly unending host of male admirers.  Kelly becomes concerned over his interest in observing the ballet dancer.
Eventually Stewart becomes preoccupied, however, with another neighbor, the husky, white-haired Raymond Burr, several years away from his future starring role in the Perry Mason television detective series.  Stewart notices that Burr's wife is ill and confined to bed.  He then becomes increasingly preoccupied with Burr's comings and goings at various hours of the night.  At first Kelly tells him he is concerned over nothing.  He then attracts her interest, and finally that of his detective friend and former World War Two Air Force buddy Wendell Corey.
Just what is happening?  Are their imaginations overworked?  The finale is spelled out in typical Hitchcock fashion, after he has worked his audience's curiosity to overpowering levels.  Hitchcock seemingly loved little, if anything, more than tweaking his audience.  The curiosity grows and grows until the finale.
The color and camera work are spectacular.  We stare into the lives of individuals who are unaware of the fact that we are there.  That is, until Raymond Burr begins to suspect something.  At that point the story moves into high gear, all the way to its compelling climax.",1072483200,,2624,5.317191283292979
228160,5,6300183513,"I love Hitchcock, and his infatuation with Grace Kelly is contagious. He makes you realize what he saw in her that so fascinated him. I always thought she was an especially gifted, classy and beautiful actress and I always had a soft spot for James Stewart. The way these three come together in Rear Window is truly magical. It's one of those movies one can watch over and over throughout the years and never get tired of. It's a movie you grow old with, like a beloved spouse.
It's great entertainment, but the questions that are posed by it are eternal, like the meaning of privacy for instance, more valid than ever at this age of big brother and paparazzi; or how you can love someone with all your heart who doesn't fit in your universe and your way of life. Stewart's argument with the nurse (amazingly played by Thelma Ritter in what may very well be the role of her career) upon that very subject is one of the most amazing things I have ever seen on film. The movie would be worth it for that alone.
He proves the world over and over again that, just like his movies tend to be about bringing two lovers together and how that is achieved is ultimately unimportant, the eroticism between them is not about how much skin or graphic sex you're shown. Any frame in Rear Window is hotter than everything else you'll ever see in the movies put together. No one can be as erotic or as romantic as him.",1070841600,4,1403,4.379310344827586

228178,4,6300183513,"Like the Greenwich Village courtyard view from its titular portal, Alfred Hitchcock's classic Rear Window is both confined and multileveled: both its story and visual perspective are dictated by its protagonist's imprisonment in his apartment, convalescing in a wheelchair, from which both he and the audience observe the lives of his neighbors. Cheerful voyeurism, as well as the behavior glimpsed among the various tenants, affords a droll comic atmosphere that gradually darkens when he sees clues to what may be a murder. Definately  one of Hitchcocks best, but my favorite is, and always will be Psycho. See it today.",1067126400,3,622,5.282828282828283
228179,5,6300183513,"Hitchcock directed his movies so that the audience would see and feel exactly what the characters in the movie experienced.  Never was this done more obviously or more effectively than in Rear Window, the 1954 classic with Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly.
Stewart is a magazine photographer who has suffered a broken leg.  He is forced to spend most of his day in a wheelchair, and his only entertainment is staring out the window of his Greenwich Village apartment.  Kelly is in love with him and wants to marry him.  He wants no part of that (for some reason) and is contemplating ending the relationship.
It is interesting that we learn a lot about six or seven of his neighbors just by watching with Stewart.  There's the songwriter, who goes from failure to success right before our eyes, and the newlywed couple, who move in at the beginning full of love and lust and end up at the end like a couple married for 20 years.  Miss Torso is his name for a shapely young woman with multiple suitors and he calls another Miss Lonelyhearts, who is desperate for companionship.
The most interesting neighbor is Raymond Burr.  He has an invalid wife who disappears suddenly.  Stewart sees suspicious things in the middle of the night and develops a theory that Burr has killed his wife and disposed of her.  At first no one believes him, but eventually they come along and spy with him, trying to figure out what happened.  Stewart has a detective friend who refuses to be convinced, but Stewart tries over and over to explain why he thinks the wife is dead.
Throughout the film, Hitchcock has us totally hooked.  We are right there with Stewart and we are totally enamored by Kelly, who may have one of the most sensual screen openings in film history.  Thelma Ritter is Stewart's housemaid, and she dispenses advice on relationships and how to handle this supposed murder.
In the end, we learn whether Stewart's suspicions have any merit.  I can say that there is lots of tension and suspense along the way.  It takes real guts to make a film like this, where you are limited to one section of a room for almost two hours.  Hitchcock's genius is clearly obvious here.  One of the master's five best films of all time.",1064188800,2,2214,4.60969387755102

Hitchcock never completely reveals her attraction to him and this only service to draw us into the relationship between the two.  As they are attempting to sort out the meaning and direction of their relationship, suspense builds naturally.  It reaches a height when she decides to investigate the missing woman across the way.

Fascinating entertainment that will solidly remain a classic for years to come.",1059350400,,625,4.904761904761905
228181,5,6300183513,"This is a great accomplishment - a film which captures so much in the very confined space of one Hollywood soundstage, complete with articifial daylight and the sounds of an urban neighbourhood. But that is just a small part of the genius - Hitchcock manages to draw together several visual ideas with a number of underlying messages and come up with a movie that could be anything from comic entertainment to an intuitive social commentary - you decide!
Perhaps the best aspects of the movie are the relationships - be they between neighbours, employees, friends or lovers - the audience is drawn in and the 'voyeur watching voyeur' aspect becomes all the more ironic. James Stewart is fantastic as the recuperating photographer who cannot find anything to do except watch the comings and goings of people in his apartment block. Thelma Ritter, as his nurse/housekeeper, has some of the best one-liners. And Grace Kelly as his love interest is in truly stunning form - both in terms of her acting and physical presence (I think I fell in love with her when I first saw this movie - and I was only 10 years old).
If you want to know what all the fuss is about when it comes to movies of this era, do get this - you will enter a world of sophistication you might never have known existed. Highly recommended!",1058313600,2,1307,4.613733905579399
228182,5,6300183513,"This is a superlative film of suspense. It is a tribute to the direction of Alfred Hitchcock that one is never bored watching this film, though it entirely takes place within the confines of a claustrophobic New York Greenwich Village apartment,  the windows of the neighbors across the way, and a courtyard that separates the buildings.
Professional photographer L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart) is recovering from an accident that occurred while on assignment. Encased in a cast covering his left leg and hip, Jeff is pretty much immobilized and temporarily confined to a wheel chair. Despite regular visits by his nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter), and his beautiful, sophisticated girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly), Jeff is chafing at his confinement. Bored stiff, he does what he does best. He peers at those around him from his window. Jeff finds the lives of his neighbors both  immensely interesting and amusing. He watches them through their windows and in the courtyard, enhancing his experience with binoculars and the zoom lens of his camera. Jeff draws inferences and  conclusions about them, based upon his own experiences with human behavior.
This interest intensifies and takes a strange turn, when he believes one of them, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), may have committed a grisly murder, killing off his invalid wife, Anna. Though Jeff never actually sees the murder, what he does see is its aftermath and some peculiar behavior that puzzles him.  Putting two and two together, he becomes absolutely convinced that his neighbor across the way has done away with his invalid wife. Jeff then informally involves his friend, Lt. Thomas Doyle (Wendell Corey) of the New York City Police Department, who initially scoffs at Jeff's assessment, though he does a cursory check . With Lisa and Stella also becoming fascinated by the strange behavior of Lars Thorwald, their interest and amateur sleuthing  propels the film to an exciting climax.
Jimmy Stewart is terrific as the housebound voyeur, drawing the viewer in with him. One finds oneself peering along with him into the lives of those around him. Grace Kelly is stunningly beautiful as Jeff's girlfriend Lisa, with whom Jeff is finding it difficult to make a commitment. It is interesting that as Jeff gets more intimately engrossed in his neighbors' affairs, his intimacy with Lisa seems to grow, drawing them closer together. Thelma Ritter is funny and sassy as the tough talking, no nonsense nurse. Raymond Burr, looking eerily as he would half a century later, is well cast as the neighbor whose wife got on his nerves. Wendell Corey is very good as the congenial, though jaded, detective.
All in all, this is a terrific film that clearly shows the mastery and deft direction of the legendary Hitchcock. With a well written script and a stellar cast, this is a film that is well worth having in one's personal collection. Bravo!",1049587200,45,2898,5.067085953878407

228204,5,6300183513,"Countless times during the 25 years I've been alive, I've heard someone older than me sigh nostalgically and comment, ""they just don't make 'em like they used to"" with regards to contemporary cinema.  And I have to agree in terms of objective fact, but not in spirit.  No, they don't make movies like they used to, and as far as I'm concerned, that's to the good- I much prefer movies made from 1965 on, for the most part.  However, there are certain films, such as Rear Window, that you recognize could never be made in this era where special effects, short attention spans, and cheap thrills, dominate the suspense/horror genre, and you have to sigh nostalgically, even if, like me, you weren't alive during the period of cinema for which you are yearning.  Fortunately, you can pop in the excellent DVD release of this classic Hitchock film anytime you like and be taken back to a time where, indeed, they still made movies like they used to.
I don't see how you could not like this film.  As far as the acting goes, James Stewart is great as the crusty photographer with a broken leg and nothing to do but spy on his neighbors.  Meanwhile, the female lead, Grace Kelley, has the best role in the film, and she assumes it brilliantly.  Grace plays the woman of every man's dreams: heart-breakingly beautiful, kind, smart, and, as we find out in the film's climax, tough as nails.
That said, the real star of this film is Hitchock, who once again advances the art of filmmaking with his unique sense of macabre and technical expertise.  The story here is mainly existential rather than suspenseful.  The act of violence around which the film is centered is the most chilling example of the darkness of modern/postmodern existence, but each apartment into which James Stewart looks provides both James and the viewer with some very dark insight into the pain, the banality, and the frustration and isolation, that has become ingrained into life as we know it.  Now, how many suspense films can you name that are philosophically profound in addition to dramatic?
Finally, the DVD version is sweet.  I don't care much for extras, but the documentary is interesting.  Meanwhile, the sound and picture of the film itself won't give Terminator 2 a run for its money, but are both fantastic in DVD adaptation, especially given the period during which the film was made.
In sum, see Rear Window many, many times.  That goes for those you who already have seen it many times, as well as for those of you have never watched it.  Maybe they'll never make another Rear Window, but hey, you couldn't pop the film into your DVD player and lounge on your sofa cuddled with your loved one, pet, or bottle of beer, back in 1954, now, could you?",1046649600,,2729,4.658333333333333

228206,5,6300183513,"Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film Rear Window has a simple plot, an injured photographer becomes intrigued and enraptured with the comings and goings of his neighbors across the courtyard in his apartment complex and becomes convinced that one neighbor has murdered his wife.  The film takes place exclusively in the photographer's apartment and we merely can see into the neighbor's apartments through their windows.  The photographer, Jeff Jeffries, is played by James Stewart and due his broken leg is confined to his apartment and due to the inherent voyeuristic nature of his trade, he trains his eye on the apartments across the courtyard.  Grace Kelly plays his girlfriend, Lisa, and she is at first disinterested and disapproving of his actions, but she too is soon drawn into the human drama.  Thelma Ritter plays her usual sarcastic role as a visiting nurse who is sucked into Jeff's human drama.  Mr. Hitchcock does a brilliant job of making Jeff's voyeurism at first seem comically, a fun way to kill idle time, then slowly building upon a suspicion that grows and grows until it reaches a scary and thrilling conclusion.  The fact that he only allows the audience to see things from the perspective of Jeff's apartment and never allows into the apartments across the courtyard is a brilliant piece of direction and adds to the tension.  Rear Window was the second of the films that Mr. Hitchcock and Mr. Stewart made together and it was rousing success after the disappointment both felt after their first collaboration, 1948's Rope.",1043625600,10,1541,5.019607843137255

Directed and produced by Alfred Hitchcock. Written by Cornell Woolrich, John Michael Hayes (screenplay).

L.B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies (James Stewart) is a professional photographer. He lives in an apartment in Greenwich Village, New York where he is recuperating with a broken leg in a cast. All he can do is sit there in his wheelchair and read, talk on the phone and occasionally watch the neighbors out his huge window. His apartment building has a small courtyard with an apartment building in front of him and to the left and right side. There is a walkway to the left where Jeff can see goes out to the street and a cafe/bar across the way.
  He has a good view of all of his neighbors when they open their windows or blinds. He can see what they are doing inside their apartments and when they come outside as well.
  He is visited by his insurance company home-care nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter) who gives him a daily massage, but also gives him some common sense not to watch his neighbors so much. It is trouble.
  His wealthy girlfriend, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) tries to get his mind off of things including what is going on out his window.  Perhaps a kiss and dinner will do.
  One night, Jeff hears something. It's one of his neighbors. Something has happened.

Watch this suspenseful movie and look at what Jeff is looking at out his rear window.

Also in the cast: Georgine Darcy, Ross Bagdasarian, Sara Berner, Frank Cady, Jesslyn Fax, Rand Harper, Havis Davenport, Judith Evelyn, Ralph Smiles, Raymond Burr, Irene Winston, Wendell Corey, Iphigenie Castiglioni, Harry Landers, Bess Flowers.

228208,5,6300183513,"This 1954 film was directed by the great master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock and stars James Stewart as Jeff, and Grace Kelly as Lisa. Jeff is a photojournalist with a broken leg after an accident on one of his previous news assignment. He is bound to his wheelchair in his small apartment over looking a wide variety of people with different stories, and situations. He's bored so he observes them, but when one of them shows suspicious behavior, he believes there has been a murder. He becomes obsessed and watches day and night, even getting his friends involved. Since they have no evidence, they must investigate themselves.
This is another masterpiece from Hitchcock, with many layers, and stories going on. The direction is great, and the film ends very suspenseful. The acting is perfect by both leads. The film is great as entertainment, but also you can have a variety of interpretations of what Hitchcock really meant with this film. This is a classic and should be in every film lovers DVD collection. Highly recommended. 5 stars.",1037404800,3,1042,4.892655367231638
228209,5,6300183513,"'Rear Window' has long been revered not only as a classic Hitchcock film but a classic in its own right, so I was keen to watch it.  When I did so I was more than pleasantly surprised that something that is now quite old could be enjoyable as well as intelligent and just as relevant today (maybe even more so) than it was in its time.  The story by now is famous, with James Stewart playing Jeffries, a photographer who is wheelchair-bound in his appartment and begins spying on his neighbours to pass time.  Interesting as his neighbours may be, one man in particular catches his eye when his wife mysteriously disappears and Jeffries convinces himself that she has been murdered by her husband.
Whilst on the surface this may appear to be a routine, but masterfully crafted thriller, it is actually a lot more than that, questioning the voyeurism inherent in everyone, our wish to see something new, exciting and shocking.  The camerawork creates an incredibly tense atmosphere, with everything shown from Jeffries' perspective from the window of his appartment.  As the camera pans slowly over the other flats we see tiny images of people boxed up in their windows, their private lives on display and us staring in at them; whether it be a couple arguing, a lonely woman or a sexy ballet dancer it's made very clear that it isn't just the character who's the voyeur but the audience as well.
The movie also questions how we view our lives as reflections of other people's, such as when Jeffries reluctantly talks of committment to his girlfriend (Kelly) whilst looking on at a husband and wife shouting at one another.  All this and it's acted to perfection by Stewart, Kelly and a highly accomplished supporting cast.  There's even a spot of dark humour here, especially in the character of the nurse who views it all with a ghoulish yet comic intensity.  In 'Rear Window' Hitchcock had created that rarity - a Hollywood film that was not only popular at the time, but that continues to be so today, a movie that is enjoyable merely on the basis of the story yet is intelligent and insightful as well.",1034294400,,2106,4.688346883468835
228210,5,6300183513,"This is one of my favorite Hitchcock films.  Part of its appeal lies in its originality and simplicity.  Jeff (played by James Stewart) is an injured photographer who's confined to a wheelchair in his apartment.  The story revolves around the things he sees from his window as he's spying on his neighbors.  Binoculars in hand, Jeff looks at what everyone's doing and knows a lot about each of their lives.
He begins to suspect his neighbor of murdering his wife, and a number of things happen that seem to support that hypothesis.  He investigates, and gets both his girlfriend (played by Grace Kelly) and his nurse to help him.
Directing was an art for Hitchcock, and his ability is showcased marvelously in this thriller.  Using just the apartment building for a set, Hitchcock creates an aura of suspense and uncertainty that will keep you involved throughout the movie.
The acting in this movie is superb, and its story is interesting, all the way to the final climax involving the helpless Jeff.  This is a movie that definitely deserves to be on AFIs top 100 list.",1032393600,,1071,4.756756756756757
228221,5,6300183513,"""Rear Window"" came to my attention 20 years ago, courtesy of my mom. She and I were talking about our favorite scary movies, and mine, of course, were confined primarily to blood and gore. She then told me about this amazingly simple story about ""a man confined to a chair who may or may not have seen a murder."" When I asked her how he could've seen a murder from his perspective in an apartment wheelchair, she told me ""that's where all the suspense comes from."" The movie was then rereleased in theaters, and I saw it for the first time. To put it simply, I was floored; no film with such a simple skeleton should have this much flesh and blood packed in a running time of 114 minutes. I went out and purchased it the moment it became a home video. The single-set confinement, the sub-stories involving the other neighbors, the cat-and-mouse interplay (not just with Jeffries and Thorwald, but with Stewart, Corey, Kelly, and Thelma Ritter) is spellbinding. (Sorry, that's another movie.) It's also a wonderfully adult movie, with more than a little sexy entendre betwixt James Stewart and the gorgeous Grace Kelly. One of my top ten favorites, I can honestly conclude that it is Hitchcock's masterpiece.",1032393600,2,1207,4.725118483412322
228222,5,6300183513,"Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' is a 50s classic. It's almost everything - a romance, a thriller, a mystery and a comedy - all at the same time.
With some brilliant performances, especially by James Stewart, this movie is about how a man observes his neighbors, only to find that each experience is only a reflection (to varying degrees) of his feelings towards his girfriend (Grace Kelly).
This is a thoroughly enjoyable (and less scary) Hithcock movie!",1032307200,,448,4.986666666666666
228223,5,6300183513,"One of Hitchcock's favourites of his own films, REAR WINDOW is up there with the master's best, including VERTIGO, NORTH BY NORTHWEST and PSYCHO. James Stewart has one of his best roles here as L.B Jefferies, a photographer who busts up his leg and gets stuck in an apartment with nothing to do but stare at the neighbours. Voyerism, wit and suspense are all well played and along with Jimmy's great performance, there is the amazing Grace Kelly and Ramond Burr as the surly neighbour who may, or may not have killed his wife. Franz Waxman's musical score adds a tense layer of gripping suspense, with one of the scores where the music is the 5th character. Everything about the film is brilliant. What other film could you mention where every line is classic? Stella: 'Let's go down there and find out what's buried in that garden.' Lisa Carol Fremont: 'Why not? I've always wanted to meet Mrs. Thorwald.'
If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would. It is one of the most superbly-crafted films of all time.",1030492800,3,1013,4.602209944751381
228224,4,6300183513,"This is the quintessential Hitchcock flick, easy to understand, addictively interesting, featuring great stars (Grace Kelly and James Stewart), familiar bit players (Thelma Ritter in one of her best roles as Stewart's talkative nurse), and a kind of almost imperceptible satire on the human animal.  In this case, Hitchcock has glorious fun displaying a whole range of human behaviors through the device of watching them through a Greenwich Village rear window before the age of air conditioners when everyone had to leave their windows open (and some even slept on the fire escape-I've done that) to cope with the appalling heat and humidity during an eastern seaboard heatwave.
James Stewart stars as L.B. Jeffries, an adventurerous photographer who has a broken leg and is confined to his apartment in a cast while it heals.  Bored beyond belief, he becomes a voyeur of his neighbors.  Meanwhile there is his girlfriend, none other than Grace Kelly playing a ""too perfect"" socialite intent on winning his heart and soul.  Trouble is Jeff worries that it won't work out, that they are essentially incompatible, she a socialite, who always goes first class, he a roughing it man of the world comfortable with second class accomodations.  Naturally the audience (me!) finds it incredible that he isn't madly in love with her.
Raymond Burr (long TV's Perry Mason) in gray hair and specks has an interesting role as Lars Thorwald, seen almost entirely from a distance across the courtyard doing very suspicious things with knives and suitcases and mysterious comings and goings in the middle of the night.  Bored voyeurs wonder what is going on.  There is some light romantic play between Stewart and Kelly, but it is decidedly secondary to the voyeuristic adventures seen through the rear window: the saga of Miss Lonelyhearts, the ardor of the newlyweds, the angst of the songwriter, the exhibitionism of the dancing beauty, the pampered dog in a basket, and Thorwald and his invalid and then missing wife.  Hitchcock's America at midcentury.  Each of the little stories within the story has a plot and a resolution: Miss Lonelyhearts finds her man.  The songwriter finds somebody who appreciates his work.  Dancing beauty's man (looking from a distance a little like Woody Allen in an army uniform) returns.  The groom seeks a break from his exhaustive marital duties, etc.  Hitchcock's sense of satire has the softest touch, which is why, I think, he is so beloved.  In the final scene Grace Kelly, finding her man asleep, puts down the adventure book she is reading (for his benefit) and picks up Harper's Bazaar to check the fashions.  One gets the sense of future marital bliss and especially, marital reality.
There is some tension and some mystery, but nothing too strenuous for little old ladies from Pasadena, and nothing to offend anybody and nothing too graphic.  You can see this with the kids and your maiden aunt and all will find it interesting.  See it for Thelma Ritter, the sadonic character actress of many films, most notably this and All About Eve (1950).",1029456000,,3076,5.0
228225,5,6300183513,"Rear Window and North by Northwest are my favorite Alfred Hitchcok films and rank very highly on the list of my favorite films overall. Although they are very different films, they both share great suspense, creative plots, some humor, and wonderful stars - what more could you ask for in a movie? Additionally, Rear Window offers some interesting insights into human nature and shows that, like L.B. Jeffries, we (as movie watchers) are essentially voyeurs.
Basically, Rear Window is about photographer L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) who, not being able to move due to a cast on his broken leg, starts to use his powerful camera lenses to observe people in the neighboring apartments. While watching, he notes the strange behavior of one man...and then begins to believe that the man murdered his wife. With a beautiful girlfriend (Grace Kelly) at his side, Jeffries investigates the situation, creating a great deal of suspense. The movie has a wonderfully clever conclusion which I am NOT going to describe: watch it and find it out for yourself!
Anyhow, this is a true thriller, Hitchcock style. It features classic actors (James Stewart, especially, is amazing in this film), a creative, original plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and interesting thoughts about voyeurism, etc. As a last point, Rear Window has a real sense of atmosphere - it really transports the viewer to the apartment building in the hot summer.

228226,5,6300183513,"1954's REAR WINDOW is a brilliant study on voyeurism and insatiable curiosity. Wheelchair bound James Stewart spies on his neighbors in the courtyard from the window of his Greenwich Village apartment. Convinced that he has uncovered a murder, Stewart maintains his vigil with his society girlfriend (Grace Kelly) by his side. Hitchcock asks the viewer about the ethics of interpreting what goes on behind the closed doors of our neighbors, as his courtyard is an allegorical cross section of American society and mores during the 50s.",1026777600,,535,5.232558139534884
228227,5,6300183513,"Not only does this marvelous film cater to one's desire for a peek at the neighbors, but it makes their daily round unrealistically interesting, attractive or affecting.  The courtyard of the Manhattan apartment I once inhabited had no lovely ballerina starting the day with graceful, sensual dance, or talented songwriter filling the night air with live, semi-classical piano.  Rather, my window opened on the blare and schlock of commercial television and radio.
Jimmy Stewart's neighbors include not only a killer who considerately leaves his shades up for everything but the crime but also Miss Lonelyheart, who searches and grieves in full view, another woman who eloquently laments and protests (to all the world who failed to stop it) the murder of her pet dog, and policemen who arrive within seconds after being summoned to stop a fight.  Who would need movies if ordinary life were this alive?
Although Stewart is prone, with left leg in full cast, his role is something like that of a male ballet dancer, functioning as a kind of center off and around whom others play.  These ""others"" include not only his neighbors (for the most part unaware of him), but also his visitors.  In dialogue, we first see this with Thelma Ritter, who plays his skillful, no-nonsense nurse.  Stewart's unassuming, brief responses set off her fast, funny, caring, shrewd paragraphs.  For how many people do insurance companies provide nurses like this?
But of course the crowning wish-fulfillment is Grace Kelly as Stewart's would-be bride.  If there is another movie in which she is this beautiful, lead me to it.  The beauty is in her carriage, her looks, her clothes, her speech, her love, her intelligence, her pluck, her resourcefulness, her resilience, her good temper, her liveliness.  (That she stays superbly attractive is the more remarkable, since aggressive pursuit is not ordinarily a becoming posture.)  Here she is, mine to enjoy.  The more so, because Stewart's retreats leave her more available to me, who would be glad to fill in.
The murderer is played by Raymond Burr, who spent much of his cinematic life as a central character, Perry Mason.  Here, he mostly elicits action from others, rather than providing it himself, which is perhaps the fate of most criminals in detective stories they precipitate.  There is of course the last, frightening struggle between him and Stewart, a climax more crucial for the plot than for my enjoyment of the movie, which had already been signed, sealed and delivered.
By the way, two recent customer reviews see Stewart as totally or partly defenseless as Burr approaches his apartment.  But is he?  Why not lock the door?  He is physically able to move to the door and lock it.  He could unlock it again for friends or police. It is certainly frightening when a disabled good guy wrestles for his life against a strong bad guy.  But is this predicament really necessary?  Do we have an ending with no artistic necessity?",1026691200,,2968,4.969635627530365

HITCHCOCK is clearly at his peak here,working with a crew that understands his vision. The casting is examplary in every aspect;GRACE KELLY shines with her feminine charm;THELMA RITTER was one of the best supporting actress of her time and JAMES STEWART was tailor made for his role. A  suspense film  like this was quite unusual in 1954. What makes HITCHCOCK such a great director is his attention for details:the ring in GRACE's hand near the end;the way that HITCHCOCK combines the appetites of sex prelude and murder without insisting too much but making his point. If you pay attention,this film actually has a lot to say about the human nature. You should watch this movie twice to fully appreciate it. Many youngsters, brainwashed by the thrillers of our time ,that manages a few killings every fifteen minutes will be bored by this film. It is in fact stylish and  intelligently conceived.

But none of them can even come close to the sheer brilliance and the excellence of Rear Window. I first saw Rear Window about a year ago and I can remember being enthralled, thrilled, and very entertained by it. I would consider Rear Window to be one of the most chilling movies Hitchcock ever made. I remember feeling a little nervous when Raymond Burr came over to Jeff's apartment to try to kill him and Jeff was totally defensless. I also loved the wit, and style of this film. Grace Kelly was as beautiful as ever in Rear Window. Stella who was the nurse really made me laugh with all of her wisecracks. I can't praise Rear Window enough. Buy the DVD and watch it.

228230,5,6300183513,"Rear Window is one of the classic Hitchcock films, made in the latter part of his career, where he could almost do no wrong. It ranks up there with Psycho, The Birds, Vertigo, North By Northwest, The Man Who Knew Too Much, and in my opinion the only movie of Hitch's that is better than Rear Window is North By Northwest. Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly give one of their better performances. The action in this movie takes place in Stewart's apartment or viewed from his apartment. Stewart plays a photographer who has broken his leg and is pretty much immobile (the cast is from the pelvis to foot) and witnesses what he suspects to be a murder. The film can be truly horrifying. Imagine what it would be like to watch a man attack the woman you love (there is only one way a man should be allowed to put his hands on Grace Kelly) from your window and not being able to do anything about it. Or having a hulking man (the size of Raymond Burr) coming to kill you and not being able to flee or adequately defend yourself. It gives a level of creepiness that you won't find outside of Psycho or The Birds. Rear Window is one of Hitch's more chilling works.
The DVD gives a better picture and sound quality over VHS and it is nice to be able to skip around the movie quickly. Unfortunately there is no commentary, but with Hitch dead and virtually no action who would be the logical choice? Probably better that no one attempts a commentary. In addition to trailers and production stills there are production notes, which give you that little bit of trivia that you can use to impress your friends with. There is also a featurette ""conversation with screenwriter John Michael Hayes"" which is interesting. And an hour long documentary titled ""Rear Window Ethics"" which is a commentary on the film (including audio interview excerpts with Hitchcock) and Restoring the Film. The two added featurettes are a definite plus for the DVD. Also, if you have a DVD-ROM on your computer you can get to a copy of the screenplay, which plays the section of the movie (in a little box in the corner) that you are reading.

228256,5,6300183513,"In Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, we view from a distance and up close a number of people trapped in their lives:  the struggling songwriter, the woman looking for companionship, the salesman and his invalid wife, and a photographer confined to a wheelchair following an accident, looking at all the other trapped people through his window into theirs.  James Stewart is that photographer, a man who has become more of a voyeur than he wants to admit.  He's feeling trapped by his wheelchair, but also by his relationship with beautiful rich girl, Grace Kelly.  And then he begins to suspect that one of the neighbours has committed a murder, and from his perch at his window, he begins to piece it altogether.  Rear Window is an amazing film.  Like he was in Lifeboat, Hitchcock is limited to a small physical space to play out his action, and he does it here with even more success.  The suspense, the suspicions, and the evidence builds gradually in a plot perfectly paced for maximum effect.  Stewart gives a very assured performance here, just as effective in his reaction shots as he is delivering dialogue.  Kelly is sophisticated, beautiful, and very real in her performance, and both are matched by the always great Thelma Ritter as the to-the-point nurse who visits daily, and who also becomes involved in the goings on.  This is clearly one of Hitchcock's top achievements - a smart, romantic, sexy, funny, scary, mystery film that delivers on all those levels.  Make a point to see this one!",1012003200,,1504,4.8359375
228257,5,6300183513,"""Rear Window"" is widely considered as one of Hitchcock's best, and there is good reason for this. I am no film critic, but I do know when a movie is good or not after I see it. In such a small neighborhood setting all throughout the film, Mr. Hitchcock is able to generate considerable viewer-interest and suspense as he affords us a window-sized view into the lives of the tenants living in the surrounding apartments. We see these through the eyes of our hero, who for the moment is tied to the wheelchair with one leg in full brace. It is through the idle hours of doing nothing where he begins to look out of the window and observe (spy is a more fitting word) more closely the lives of his neighbors. The dilemma starts when he begins to suspect one of them as having committed murder.
Let's face it, to some degree, every human being has a taste for voyeurism (although, the nature of voyeurism in this film is not largely sexual : only one scene where our protagonist sees, through a small window which only exposed the head, the young woman living across his apartment taking a shower.) The movie knows this, and aptly capitalizes on this knowledge. James Stewart stars, and Grace Kelly, as the leading lady, has never been more beautiful and captivating. The cast is first rate.",1011052800,,1287,4.551724137931035
228258,5,6300183513,"When Grace Kelly utters that line to James Stewart, she like he has her gaze riveted to the window watching the goings-on across the back courtyard. Now we know that she finally believes his fantastical claim that the seemingly innocuous nearby apartment dweller (pre-Perry Mason Raymond Burr in a white wig)has in fact murdered his nagging invalid wife.
Stewart has been laid up for weeks in his apartment with a leg cast, unable to pursue his adventurous life as a daredevil photographer. Bored, he has taken to watching the antics of the apartment dwellers across the way. Things look a little strange about Burr and his now-absent wife, so Stewart's long-dormant imagination takes him into a cat and mouse game with dangerous consequences.
I like ""Rear Window"" quite a lot: the speaking actors are all first-rate, like the aforementioned Stewart and Kelly, and also reliable Thelma Ritter as the visiting nurse who has her own pet theories about where ""things"" might be buried. Then there's a  pile of non-speaking actors, the pantomine players comprising the apartment dwellers, whose skill makes the whole movie work. Costuming for Grace is great, too; there are numerous occasions for her to spin about in haute couture outfits while trying to tempt the wheelchair bound Stewart away from his voyeuristic habits.
If you've ever tried to piece together what the folks across the courtyard from you are doing, whether behind drawn shades or out in plain sight, throw open ""Rear Window"" and take a peek.",1008806400,2,1507,5.028
228259,4,6300183513,"Rear Window is somewhat languidly paced, lacking the taut direction of some of Hitchcock's best films (Notorious, North by Northwest, Dial M for Murder, etc.), and this one-set movie does start to feel claustrophobic.  I was hoping for Stewart to be able to get out of that wheelchair, leave his small apartment with the oversized lamp shade, and get out into the world.
The climax was a bit disappointing.  It is chilling to hear Burr coming up the stairs, but once he comes in to the apartment he just starts asking questions -- that's not too scary!  And he doesn't even have a weapon on him!
It's not one of Hitchcock's best films, but it still is interesting and entertaining.",1008633600,2,681,4.658333333333333
228260,5,6300183513,"Although Hitchcock listed this as one of his 2 favorite films, I had once viewed it as ""closet drama"" because of the limited set, conventional bad guy, passive good guy.  The voyeuristic angle was interesting, even provocative to a point, but insufficient to save the movie from its sense of claustrophobic one-dimensionality.
That was before I viewed the film through the eyes of Grace Kelly.  In one respect, the critical, pivotal moment in the movie is not when Kelly puts herself at risk in Raymond Burr's apartment, nor is it the film's climax with James Stewart fending off the murderer with his camera's flash bulbs.  Rather, it's the moment when Hitchcock's camera (not Stewart's) shows Kelly's eyes suddenly open wide and come alive when she, too, becomes interested in the scenes being played out on the other side of the court yard.
At this point, within the first half of the film, Kelley drops her high society, fashion-model airs and her constant mothering of Stewart.  She now spectates with greater curiosity and imagination than Stewart, and even though she questions these ""rear window ethics"" and characterizes her behavior as ""ghoulish,"" it's clear she has become a major player, fully participating in the game of voyeurism, scopophilia, and fetishism that is normally assigned only to men who fail to emerge from an obsessively narcissistic and hedonistic childhood.
For the past 20 years feminist academics have been applying ""male gaze theory"" to just about every film in sight, and invariably to the discredit of the male.  He is the subject; she's the object; he's the one who sees; she's the one who is seen; he owns the gaze in all of his power, pleasure, and guilt; she can only helplessly follow the gaze, experiencing a kind of masochistic pleasure at best.
In ""Rear Window"" Hitchcock, frequently depicted by feminist critics as a mother-obsessed misogynist, turns gaze theory on its head.  Grace Kelly demonstrates that a woman can get as much pleasure from looking as do men--an irony of collossal proportions when we consider that as a high fashion model her role, if not job, is to be looked at and photographed.
But Hitchcock's film manages to liberate its central heroine's vision while preserving the ""institutions"" of marriage, motherhood, and femininity.  What is the object of Kelly's pursuit while playing the game at its most intense moment?  A wedding ring, which she flashes before the probing telescopic lens of Stewart.  And at the end of the film, the camera makes clear that, pending his recovery from double castration (both legs are now broken), he will no longer go off on adventures without Kelly at his side.  But then, of course, Hitch has his final little joke when, once Stewart goes to sleep, Kelly (now wearing pants) puts away her mountain-climbing magazine and replaces it with a high fashion title.  Still, a radical film for Hitchcock and, for that matter, most other filmmakers.
The DVD makes it all the more possible to read the visual dynamics of the film, permitting razor sharp stills of the principals' faces and eyes, disclosing the act of seeing to a degree never before possible.",1007078400,,3151,4.97148288973384
228261,5,6300183513,"The ultimate Hitchcock classic, REAR WINDOW gives us a glimpse into the mind of Alfred Hitchcock, and in turn Hitchcock turns the mirror on us and forces us to admit our darkest desire...to be voyeurs.
That is exactly what Jeffries is.  Jeffries (James Stewart) is a wheelchair-bound photographer who spends his time cooped up in his apartment, peeping in on the neighbours across the courtyard.  He comes up with ""names"" for them; Miss Torso the ballerina; Miss Lonely-Hearts; The Newly-Weds and so on.  His only contact with the outside world is his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) and his wisecracking nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter).

228283,5,6300183513,"Mounting suspense, witty dialogue, great performances and so much to watch. Four reasons to see this movie immediately. If it's your first time watching Hitchcock, this might be a good place to start. The story centers around photographer L.B. Jefferies (played by Jimmy Steweart), who is confined to his apartment because of his broken leg. He is visited regularly by his nurse Stella (played by Thelma Ritter) and his socialite girlfriend Lisa (played by the luminous Grace Kelly). As for that, he really has nothing more to pass the time with. So he begins to spy on his neighbors. From this, several miny story-lines enfold but the most interesting by far is that of a man who appears to have murdered his wife. As the evidence becomes more clear, the suspense mounts and leads to a gripping conclusion that is much better than any in a modern day horror movie. A movie like 'Rear Window' is so interesting to watch because there is so much for us to watch. There's Jeff's story line, the possibility of a murder and all of the other things going on around him that gives the viewer something interesting and new. In a way, 'Rear Window' is like an homage to movies themselves. What is Jefferies doing? He's a voyeur. What are we when we watch movies? Getting the idea? Maybe that's what makes this movie so interesting to watch. As Stella quoted, we've become a race of peeping toms. So watch 'Rear Window', you won't regret it.",1001808000,6,1433,4.66798418972332
228284,5,6300183513,"Why is Rear Window so important? FIRST, because it sums up all the elements that made Hitchcock a master among directors. It presents his vision of what Cinema was all about. It has a flawless screenplay with, director, stars and technicians at their peak form. SECOND, because Rear Window is one perfect example of the production triumphs the studio-system industrial line of work could generate . THIRD, because it is not just a classical work: it shows the evolution from the classical period in film history towards modern cinema. FOURTH, because it is one perfect example of mastering a technique.
I will not bother with the story (which by now, I guess everybody already knows it - a man on a wheelchair watching his neighbors from his window... the crime... etc.) because the story is just one small aspect of what makes this film great. In fact, what it is important to point out is that this story (which is very simple) was translated into a screenplay structurally perfect. This perfection gives depth to the characters, amplifies relationships and oppositions (the stuff drama is made of) and makes the viewer an active part of the spectacle. The viewer works his way through the film and sees things we do not see very often on today's commercial cinema.
Plus it is now on DVD. Restored. The image is beautiful and the sound is fine dolby mono 2.0 (although I was expecting a stereo soundtrack when I heard the DVD restoration was coming). The extras are fine (could be improved). Anyway, when the work is that great, who complains about small things? An absolute gem that demands multiple viewings and endless analysis.

Let there be no doubt about the cinematic qualities of this feature, this movie is what it is all about! If you must buy one DVD this year, let it be this one. It doesn't get any better than this. Having said that, I would like to comment on the technical quality of this ""Collector's Edition."" This is the one negative aspect that I could find. The extra material is very good, however, taking into consideration the many difficulties  that the restoration team encountered while trying to save this movie, I (for one, at least) would have liked to see more about how it was actually restored. And why wasn't the 2000 re-release trailer included, when you can find it on the Internet? Also, I miss a separate audio track with  commentaries from the cast and crew, not to mention the restoration team, led by James C. Katz and Robert A. Harris.  And finally, and this is single most important issue in connection with this release, why did they make such a lousy transfer of the movie itself? It looks like it was made in ten minutes or something. Maybe a new THX certified transfer would be preferable for subsequent releases of this movie, i.e. on the second edition of this DVD. In my opinion the ""Vertigo"" Laserdisc edition looked sharper and had less noise than this DVD version of ""Rear Window."" And I think that they did a wonderful job with the ""Vertigo"" DVD transfer, so I don't understand why this one needs to look so second-rate.

But voyeurism is such a banal topic today in our constantly online world.  And don't forget that voyeurism is also a major plot point in most trashy films made since the 60's.  But it was nice to see a film that was so respectful of the audience's intelligence.

228324,5,6300183513,"""Rear Window"" is rightly regarded as one of Hitchcock's best films and has been written about and analysed many times. Hitchcock considered it would be a challenge to make a film using just one set (he had done something similar in ""Rope"" also starring James Stewart in 1948). ""Rear Window"" is considered to be one of James Stewart's best roles even though he was confined to a wheelchair throughout the film. Grace Kelly was elegant as Stewart's girl friend and Raymond Burr made an impressive villain.
Jeff Jeffries (James Stewart) is a photo journalist who is recovering from a broken leg and he passes the time by looking out of his window which overlooks several other apertments. He thinks that a murder has taken place in the apartment directly across from his. He has observed his neighbour Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) arguing with his wife and later becomes convinced that Thorwald has killed her and disposed of the body. He shares his thoughts with girl friend Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) but she is reluctant to believe him and tells Jeffries that his imagination is getting the better of him. However, after observing Thorwald for some time she also becomes suspicious and agrees to help Jeff find evidence to support his theory. Jeffries is unable to leave his apartment due to being in a wheelchair with his broken leg so Lisa volunteers to break into Thorwald's apartment to look for clues when he is out. Naturally, Thorwald returns and catches her in there which places Lisa in great danger with Stewart helpless to do anything while watching from across the courtyard.
Some favourite lines from the film:
James Stewart (to Grace Kelly): ""I've seen it through that window - I've seen bickering and family quarrels and mysterious trips at night. Knives and saws and ropes, and now since last night not a sign of the wife"".
Kelly (to Stewart): ""Start from the beginning again Jeff. Tell me everything you saw - and what you think it means"".
Wendell Corey (to Stewart): ""You didn't see the killing or the body - how do you know there was a murder?"".
Raymond Burr (to Stewart): ""What do you want from me?.
One of the delights in watching a Hitchcock film is to be clever enough to spot the director's cameo appearance. (In ""Rear Window"" he was winding a clock in the music composers apartment about an hour into the film). In his early films he sometimes did not appear until near the end (as in ""The Lady Vanishes"" for example). However, as people became aware of this gimmick Hitchcock realised it would spoil the audiences concentration of the film if they were watching for him to pop up so he began to make his cameos earlier in the films to get them out of the way. James Stewart appeared in four films for Hitchcock - the others were ""Rope"", ""Vertigo"" and ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"". Grace Kelly made two other films for Hitchcock - ""Dial M For Murder"" and ""To Catch a Thief"". Raymond Burr went on to have great success on television in both the ""Perry Mason"" and ""Ironside"" series. ""Rear Window"" was remade in 1998 with Christopher Reeve and Daryl Hannah.",990748800,,3078,4.691312384473198
228325,5,6300183513,"Rear Window is one of Alfred hitchcock's best films. The opening shot of the community is hard to believe that it's not NYC!, but a back-lot at the studios where the picture was filmed. But this is more than just a film its Hitchcock's autobigraphical celluloid version of his life! Hitchcock wasn't a pleasent man, he was very sardonic and on several occasions was very cruel to the people who worked with him even going as far as to chain a camera man over night to a camera and give him coffee laced with ex lax before hand! Even the films characters are based on people he hated for instance in the film Burr looks ever so much like Selznick the notorious producer who brought Hitchcock over from England and watched over him with a hawks eye.

Kelly looks amazing as usal though she was never the best actress in hollywood she was one of the best movie stars. Stewart plays a photographer stuck in a wheelchair with a broken leg.

228328,5,6300183513,"""Rear Window"" is a masterpiece of filmmaking art and one of Alfred Hitchcock's best movies. It shows Hitchcock at his best in two different aspects of making movies. One is the technical aspect. The use of lighting, perspective, and the way that details and events are portrayed visually. The second is the aspect of storytelling. The way that the story unfolds, building tension and suspense at a deliberate pace as the plot transitions from humorous looks at newlyweds and a woman who lets her little dog out by lowering him to the ground in a basket, to the question of a possible murder. Hitchcock excells at both aspects of his craft, and he demonstrates his skill brilliantly in ""Rear Window"".
The story involves a professional photograher (played by Stewart) who is confined to a wheelchair for several weeks with a broken leg. Bored, he spends his time observing the lives of his neighbors whose apartments border the same courtyard as his. Hot summer weather guarantees lots of open windows. Things get serious when it begins to appear that the man across the courtyard has murdered his nagging wife. As other reviewers here have pointed out, this tale works on many different levels. But, whether you view it as a morality play about voyeurism or a psychological examination of commitment issues, the bottom line is that it is one of the best suspense movies you'll ever see. I'd give it six stars if I could. It gets my very highest recommendation.",989107200,,1459,4.84
228329,5,6300183513,"One would be hard-pressed to dethrone this film as Hitchcock's greatest film (NOTORIOUS is neck-n-neck). What is spectacular about this film, and many of Hitchcock's best works, is how he reveals characters. The opening shot in that pans around Jeffries' apartment then out the window to see the rest of ""players"" in this little drama, before coming back to Jeffries and his wares is simply an amazing tour-de-force in filmmaking style and technique. One recalls other great reveals like the opening in PSYCHO (the overhead shot of the lover's at the end of their mid-afternoon tryst) or the final death-rattle at the beginning of ROPE, one can help but revel in the Master at work. But one of the top reveals in movie history is when Grace Kelly makes her entrance and kisses Jimmy Stewart... breath-taking (Harry Lime's reveal in the THIRD MAN is one of the few major rivals).

228330,5,6300183513,"A daredevil confined to a wheelchair is the concept of Alfred Hitchcock's comedy-mystery ""Rear Window"", a man of action so bored with his confinement that he begins spying on the neighbors he can see across his Greenwich Village courtyard: the frustrated composer,the ""interpretative dancer"", the newlyweds, the desperately lonely spinster ... and the bickering couple. The wife suddenly disappears. Has she been murdered? L.B. Jeffries thinks so, and he convinces his fiance Lisa (Grace Kelly) and the insurance company nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) who visits him every day. (Jeffries, a professional photographer, has been temporarily disabled in an accident.) This set-up is perfect for Hitchcock, who loved tense situations in close quarters (""Life Boat"", ""Rope""), and who was in top form when he directed this masterpiece of entertainment in 1954. (There was a made-for-TV remake a few years back; according to... reviewers, it's pretty awful.) James Stewart was one of Hollywood's most popular personalities, but he was often mis-cast. He was pushing fifty when he played the 25-year old Lindbergh in""The Spirit of St Louis"". Similarly, in ""Rear Window"" he's too mature for the lead. The part just weeps for William Holden. Stewart even takes his shirt off in a couple of scenes, revealing a pale, thin physique. The idea that Grace Kelly would travel all the way down from the East Sixties to Greenwich Village to spend the evening with him is a little ... well,unbelievable. Miss Kelly is almost as seductive here as she was in her next Hitchcock ""To Catch a Thief"".The Master was obviously infatuated -- but, then, who wasn't? She also had a droll sense of humor: the way she pronounces ""weird"" is priceless. Thelma Ritter and Wendell Corey give witty support. Raymond Burr, just a couple of years away from playing the most famous of fictional lawyers, is quite creepy as the killer Thorwald.

228370,5,6300183513,"Alfred Hitchcock is considered by most to be the master of suspense.  I believe he was also a master of understanding human nature.  He intuitively understood that human beings are voyeurs by nature, not in the perverted sense, but in the curious sense.  We are a species that slows down to look at accident scenes and steals furtive glances at lovers in the park who are oblivious to everything but each other.  A major appeal of cinema and television is that they offer us an opportunity for guilt free voyeurism.  When we watch a film, aren't we in essence looking through a window and watching people who behave as if they don't realize we are there?
Hitchcock realized this and took voyeurism to the next level, allowing us to watch a voyeur as he watched others.  While ""Rear Window"" as a whole is probably not quite at a level with ""Vertigo"" (which was far more suspenseful and mysterious with a powerful musical score) as a cinematic accomplishment, it is more seductive because it strikes closer to our human obsessions.  Hitchcock's mastery is most evident in his subtle use of reaction scenes by the various characters.  We watch an event that Jeff (James Stewart) is watching and then Hitchcock immediately cuts to his reaction.  This is done repeatedly in various layers even with the other tenants as they interact with one another.  For instance, in the scene with Miss Lonelyheart (Judith Evelyn), we see her throw out the man who made a pass at her and then we see her reaction after she slams the door, followed by the reaction of Jeff and Lisa (Grace Kelly).  In another scene, Detective Doyle (Wendell Corey) sees Lisa's nightclothes and presumes she will be staying the night.  Hitchcock shows the suitcase, then Doyle's reaction, and then he goes to Jeff who points his finger at him and says ""Be Careful, Tom"".  This elegant scene takes a few seconds and speaks volumes with little dialogue.  Such technique gets the viewer fully involved, because if we were there this is exactly what we would be doing, watching the unfolding events and then seeing how others around us responded.  In essence, it puts us in the room with them.
Hitchcock was a stickler for detail.  For instance, he aimed the open windows so they would show subtle reflections of places in the apartment we couldn't see directly.  However, there were certain details included or excluded that were inexplicable.  Would Thorwold really be scrubbing the walls with the blinds open?  Would Lisa be conspicuously waving at Jeff while Stella (Thelma Ritter) was digging up the garden?  Moreover, wouldn't Lisa have taken off her high heels before climbing a wall and then a fire escape?  This film had numerous small incongruities that are normally absent from Hitchcock films.  Though these are picayune criticisms, they are painfully obvious in the film of a director known to be a compulsive perfectionist.
The acting is superb in this film.  Jimmy Stewart is unabashedly obsessed as the lead character.  Photographers have an innate visual perceptiveness and the ability to tell a story with an image and Stewart adopts this mindset perfectly.  Grace Kelly has often been accused of being the ""Ice Maiden"" in her films, yet in this film she is assertive and even reckless.  Though cool at times, she is often playful and rambunctious.  I always enjoy Thelma Ritter's performances for their honesty and earthiness and this is another example of a character actor at her best.  Raymond Burr often doesn't get the recognition he deserves for this role, which is mostly shot at a distance with very few lines.  Yet, he imbues Thurwold with a looming nefariousness using predominantly physical acting.
This film was rated number 42 on AFI's top 100 of the century sandwiched between ""Psycho"" (#18) and ""Vertigo"" (#61).  I personally think more highly of ""Vertigo"" but it is a minor distinction, because I rated them both 10/10.  ""Rear Window"" is a classic, a masterpiece of filmmaking technique from a director who was a true pioneer of suspense.",986860800,,4032,4.8939617083946985
228371,4,6300183513,"a note about the review of Audrey the librarian;
You're right, the film ends with the blind on the window closing down behind a Paramount logo (which was missing in the early 80's release because it was shamefully replaced with an Universal Logo), but that's shot is also in this version. REAR WINDOW ends without an end credit; which is quite normal at that time.
The ending credits you see on this version is the the restoration credits. They did a tremendous job and I guess they deserve a credit, or to take the responsibility about it.
It is not quite fair to compare the result of this restoration with that of VERTIGO; while VERTIGO was shot in VistaVision, which allows practically the same exposed film area per frame as a 70 mm film, REAR WINDOW is a straight 35mm (shot in 1:37 academic ratio, but here presented as wide screen, which may raise a controversy), so the resolution of the film itself is much less than in a VistaVison film.
And the restoration of VERTIGO had a grave flaw; for the sake of making  a DTS stereo soundtrack (while the original release was in mono), they threw away all the original sound effects and replacing them with new folley works (adding sound effects on a sound stage), which in my opinion, sounds quite awful and disturbing. At least for the sound, REAR WINDOW is a much more faithful job.
Also, the color is treated with the Technicolor dye transfer process, basically the same color system as the original release, which allows deeper, more saturated color, which is even apparent on this DVD edition. Remember the climatic scenes in VERTIGO? While that scene was printed as dark as Hitchcock originally intended, the Eastman color positive does not allow to have as much range of contrast as dye trasnfer does, so the faces of James Stewart and Kim Novak should have been a bit more visible (or at least it was when I saw an old dye-transfer print). You don't have that problem with this new REAR WINDOW.
The famous kiss scene effect is the only portion of this restored version that was restored digitaly (as far as I know). The original film elements has completely faded (optically-processed film elements tend to fade easily), but Cinesite has done a beautiful job. That scene looks almost mystical in this verison. For that shot alone, this DVD is worth buying.",986428800,5,2317,4.6928746928746925

I found the movie very enjoyable and loved the set. It lent itself to being very memorable as is was just that one set. Stewart and Kelly play off each other wonderfully and our truely great together. I just could not believe the story until the end when I just gave in to the idea. Still the movie is wonderful at what it is suppose to do. Hitchcock uses the idea of the audience seeing what his character sees plus a little more to tell the story and add to the suspense.

There is also supposedly access to the original script, but I have not yet been able to access this running the DVD on a Mac.

228374,4,6300183513,"No need to say much about the film itself, it is one of Hitchcock's most enjoyable, with excellent performances.  James Stewart is marvellous as always, although I doubt if his part stretched him quite as much as other roles, in 'Vertigo' for example.
The image on DVD is good, although this film (from 1954) goes not look as impressive as 'Vertigo' (1958) which is excellent.  Also don't miss Stewart's best screen performance in the fabulous courtroom drama 'Anatomy of a Murder' which looks superb on a black & white MGM DVD.
As for Hitch's 'North by Northwest' (1959), that is an absolutely stunning image on DVD, better than you could imagine.
In this film, the image is warm and clear, although with a hint of grain on some fleshtones which occasionally do not look entirely natural.  Also there is some loss of sharpness, particularly on closeups.  The footage of the view from L B Jefferies' (Stewart's) window is very fine.  There are no serious nicks or scars that I noticed, just the occasional fleck.
All in all this is the best 'Rear Window' has looked for home viewing, and too much should not be made of the slight flaws I have mentioned.  They will not interfere at all with your viewing and enjoyment of an excellent film.",985305600,3,1239,4.686635944700461

228377,5,6300183513,"Like all of Hitchcock's films, 'Rear Window' examines the duality of nature. To be more particular, the thrill and guilt of voyeurism. Sidelined by an accident and confined to a wheelchair with a broken leg, photographer James Stewart sits in his sweltering apartment with nothing more to do then look out his window. The simple hobby soon becomes an obsession when he grows to believe that one of his neighbors, a costume jewelry salesman played by Raymond Burr, has killed his wife. Hitchcock's amazing ability to craft suspense sequences figures in what can only be described as a nailbiting finale. This is very much a movie about moviegoing. Each of the occupants in the apartments Stewart watches has it's own story: Ms. Torso, the beautiful ballet dancer seen entertaining numerous men, Ms. Lonely Heart, who dresses up and waits for someone to come to her door, and a struggling songwriter who, right before our very eyes and ears, composes a song that ultimately becomes the very theme of the movie. We see Stewart watching these people, followed by his reaction. Thus is the essense of moviegoing. When his girlfriend (a radiant Grace Kelly) makes her way to Burr's apartment in search of evidence, Burr suddenly comes back. Stewart watches the volitile situation from his chair, unable to intervene, just watch. It's simply brilliant, made at a time when Hitchcock's powers were at their peak. Any person who enjoys film both as art and entertainment needs to see this film. The DVD edition is beautiful, the sound incredible. This is a film where the soundtrack is of utmost importance since the only sounds we hear are the sound from outside Stewart's window (whenever there is music playing on the film's soundtrack, it is coming from a neighbor's apartment, etc.). The making of documentary is fascinating viewing as is the production gallery, both giving us some rare insight into the master of suspense.

228379,5,6300183513,"This amazing director Alfred Hitchcock got the nod for 4 of AFI's (American Film Institute's) top 100 movies in 100 years (1998).  This incredible feat showcases ""Hitch"" at his very best !!!!  His greatest run began with his greatest movie ""Rear Window"" (1954), then Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959) and his most famous horror thriller, Psycho (1960) all on AFI's list.
Rear Window's cast was meticulously chosen and performed perfectly and flawlessly.  This movie is the perfect blend of story, cinematography, acting, music, drama, suspense and most of all COLOR.  Digitally restored masterfully you now can enjoy the artist pallet at its best.
In summary; An adventure magazine photographer (James Stewart) is in his 6th week being wheelchair bound from a broken leg in a 2 room apartment overlooking the courtyard of an apartment complex in New York.  Socialite girlfriend (the most beautifully photographed closeup sequence of Grace Kelly) tries to persuade the reluctant Stewart to be allowed into his high adventure life.  Along with his physical therapist (Thelma Ritter) the trio get involved in a peeping Tom scenario of the neighbors & the possibility of a  husband (Raymond Burr) killing & disposing of his wife?  The girlfriend and therapist become predators to find the body.  Stewart becomes the victim of the husband & the rest is history.
This the greatest movie and Grace Kelly is absolutely gorgeous!!!

228410,5,6300183513,"Finally, It's here and available. I've been waiting for this DVD for a long time and the wait was well worth it.
Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 masterpiece, ""Rear Window"", was painstakingly remastered by the team of Robert A. Harris and James Katz.  This is the same team that did a splendid job on ""Vertigo"" and they almost one up thier previous effort. The DVD has a special 55 minute documentary and in one of the sections they discuss how they went about the process of the restoration and the extreme difficulties they encountered in bringing this classic back to life.
I can't begin to think of all the hard work and tedious hours of work they had to confront. Ahead of them was a daunting task of organizing and fitting hundreds of thousands of feet of raw footage, negatives, positives, and foreign transfers together in one coherant, unified film. In the interview, it was documented that the negatives were virtually untreatable.  It's a near miracle that they produced the quality that they did on this DVD.
There is one important point to make about this treatment and restoration of the film to DVD...It is not perfect.  The quality of the restoration is not as good as the job they did on ""Vertigo"".  You will see some minor artifacts, medium to high grain resolution at times, and some mismatching of shots from high focus, less color saturation to slightly blurry focus but higher color resolution. Katz and Harris explain in the interview why they had to make certain compromises due to the lack of resources they encountered.
But all in all the valiant effort and there is nothing that really distracts you from this spectacular and breathtaking film. After viewing this film you will see why Hitchcock was the grandmaster at ""pure cinema"".  Hitchcock had a sixth sense in knowing where to put the camera at all times for maximum effect.
I can only think of 2-3 modern day directors that have this deep advanced intuition of camera placement, movement & composition to create a purely visual experience for the audience. This is a very important responsibility for the director.  To know exactly where a camera is to be positioned for dramatic effect and the progression of tension and drama within a scene.  In my opinion, the two current directors that really stand out with this extraordinary talent are Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese.
Back to the DVD...Buy it.  I strongly recommend the purchase. If your a Hichcock fan this is a must.  If your a regular movie fan you will see an excellent display of filmmaking at it's finest.",983923200,3,2549,4.801369863013699
228411,5,6300183513,"Though it's unfashionable to say it, I'm not a big fan of Hitchcock. I watched Psycho, Frenzy, The Birds, Vertigo and Rope, and could not for the life of me work out why he was so popular, but then, after seeing it parodied in a `Simpsons' episode, I saw Rear Window. What, in the first five minutes, seemed a good 50's-era Hitchcock film became, within ten minutes, a good film, period. Rear Window is incredible in terms of acting, writing, filmmaking, everything. I've never liked James Stewart either, but in this film he is fantastic, and playing against Grace Kelly is a work of pure genius. Shot entirely within one room (except after Stewart has left the room, shall we say), it places the viewer in Stewart's position, trapped inside his two-room apartment, with nothing to do but gaze out of the window, and as such this creates an incredible level of empathy with the character. You feel his claustrophobia at the same time as feeling his compulsion to watch, and thus in terms of placing you within the film, Rear Window has no near rivals.
The beauty of this film is in the simplicity of its construction. A guy, a girl, a room, and an apartment building opposite containing what looks like a wife-murderer. Perhaps because there are so few things to watch, you watch ten times harder than you watch other films. Anyone who has any voyeuristic tendencies (voyeur meaning the pleasure of looking, without the negative connotations of Peeping Toms) will love this film, and based on the success of shows like Big Brother and Survivor, there are a lot of people out there who take pleasure in looking. But not only is it great to watch, the characterisation is exceptional; Kelly and Stewart are great as the odd-couple Jeffries and Lisa, and serial-massager Stella is a wonderful counterpoint full of home-spun philosophies and unintentional witticisms. As the film progresses and the originally sceptical Lisa and Stella both become drawn into Jeffries' voyeurism, you are drawn too, so that when, towards the end, the line between watching and acting is crossed, you feel the increased sense of danger and excitement that they do. But it is not a tense film; it is hailed as a work of suspense, but it is difficult to see it as that. Rear Window is realistic, compelling folk drama, plain and simple and incredibly addictive.
Admittedly, it's not everyone's cup of tea. I have friends who call it slow-paced and lacking in spectacle, but to me, every scene is imbued with some kind of hook that keeps you watching. Every character across the way has an evolving story, so even when the main story takes the back seat, you remain glued to the screen. As there can be unputdownable books, so this is an unlookawayable film. It is by far the best Hitchcock I have ever seen and is still better than 99% of films made today. To me, it is an asset to every film collection, regardless of whether you're into Hitchcock or not. You could definitely do worse than owning a copy of this.",983836800,2,2991,4.709923664122138
228412,3,6300183513,"Rear Window is one of those films that tends to be over-rated most of the time. Definately not the best Hitchcock film in my book. The performances of James Stewart and Grace Kelly are wonderful to watch, but the plot is not exceptional. Yes, the film itself is suspensful, but do you want to watch a two hour picture whose subject is a handicapped photographer trying to solve what he thinks is a murder mystery?
If you really want to watch Hitchcock's masterpieces, I would recommend Vertigo, Psycho, Rebecca, The Birds and North By Northwest.",983404800,2,545,4.747368421052632
228413,5,6300183513,"Jimmy Stewart is a reporter confined to his high rise New York apartment building because he is recovering from a broken leg.  Grace Kelly is his fiance.  She comes over to help him with his recovery, although he is crankiness personified because of his condition. However, things look up when Stewart finds himself more and more engrossed by what is going on at his neighbor's apartment in another high rise, facing his.  The neighbor is played by Raymond Burr and Stewart starts to worry that Burr may be planning to do something awful to his wife.  This is a real nailbiter of a movie because Stewart is hugely limited on what he can do to help by being confined to his wheelchair. We are back in the 1950s so a phone is his only instrument of communication.

Also, Kelly is never there when the most suspicious things with Burr occur so Stewart's going to have trouble making the police believe him.  Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, this is an extremely satisfying exploration of a man's bored voyeurism turning into a rolly coaster of a nightmare. Stewart and Kelly starred in several Hitchcock films. Stewart excels at playing the regular ok guy for whom life turns nightmarish in Hitchcock's films.  Kelly excels at playing the beautiful blonde society woman.  She is unaccustomed to crime interrupting her perfect life yet she can face crime with cool aplomb. For those who have only ever seen Burr in his heroic tv roles, they will be surprised to discover that he usually played dark or villainous roles in his earlier movie career.

228414,5,6300183513,"Key word being  ""visual"".  With this movie, Hitchcock, fantastic bully that he was, forces those of us who consider ourselves  ""decent""  (whatever that means)  to confront the nasty voyeur within.  Of course, those who cheerfully admit being voyeurs will absolutely adore  ""Rear Window"".  In case you haven't seen it, it's about a professional photographer  (the ever-solid James Stewart)  who's laid up with a broken leg.  Out of boredom, he begins peering into other people's apartments across the courtyard, using a comically large camera lens  (torpedo would be an apter description).  Naturally  (for this is a Hitchcock picture), he sees something in one of the apartments which leads him to believe that a certain man  (Raymond Burr)  has done away with his wife.
The story is top-notch; but what will really impress the movie-lover is the sheer technical brilliance here.  Almost the entire film is one long-shot -- and from a first-person point of view, at that.  Astonishing.  The Master is not known particularly for his visual finesse  (I keep thinking of  *Suspicion*, with that ridiculous  ""spider-web""  shadow from the window-panes all over the inside of Joan Fontaine's house), but here his concepts are boldly conceived and fortunately executed.  Further, the DVD version looks smashing -- obviously supervised by a technical wizard.  Indeed, this 46-year-old movie looks sharper and fresher than most movies released last year  (think  *Gladiator*, with its murky computerized palettes).
*Rear Window*  is a masterpiece, natch.  But then, if you love movies, you already own it and I'm speaking to the converted.",983232000,9,1630,5.307086614173229

Hitchcock includes everything in this very classy thriller with a involving romance between two compelling and enduring actors.  With humor, style, directing, script, visuals, and thrills, this one leaves you with such a satisfying feeling that it is impossible not to smile- and think about the thought-provoking visuals and themes.  Jimmy Stewart plays a man who is restricted to staying in his apartment due to being in a wheelchair.  With a socialite girlfriend(the charming Grace Kelly) and a ""wise"" physical therapist(a endearing Thelma Ritter), Stewart investigates the strange happenings going on in the apartment across from his.  As his interests grow, the trio goes through many hardships to satisfy their curiousness and prove their shocking theory.  The movie is absolutely well-paced, the structure and plot/character-development becoming more and more familiar and interesting.  Alfred Hitchcock wonderfully directs this film.  He had worked with the elegant Grace Kelly once before and had many meetings with her to talk about this film.  It was a pleasent surprise when he offered her the job of Lisa in REAR WINDOW.  Alfred Hitchcock was the master of suspense and the avant-garde.  Hitchcock was a very influential director, which he showed in this movie.  Almost all the shots originate from Stwewart's apartment.  Watch for him winding a clock in the musician/composer's apartment approximately half and hour into the movie.  The music is done by Franz Waxman, the great composer of SUNSET BLVD., THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, Hitchcock's own REBECCA, and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.  Story by Cornell Woolrich, script by John Michael Hayes, and costumes by Hitchcock's staple designer, Edith Head.  This was one of Hitchcock's most ingenious thrillers.  This movie is also one of wit and subtleness.  Stella, my favorite character, has two of my favorite lines- ""We've become a race of Peeping Toms. What people ought to do is get outside their own house and look in for a change. Yes sir. How's that for a bit of homespun philosophy?"" and ""When two people love each other, they come together - WHAM - like two taxis on Broadway.""  Buy this movie and experience a classic film that overachieves almost every aspect a good drama and comedy suspense should do- will satisfy everyone from the thrill lover to the analyzer(a great film to pick apart like many other Hitchcock films), and from the people who want fun to people who want meaning and depth.

I must say after seeing an advance copy of this film that Rear Window looks incredible, especially compared to the Laser Disc copy I have as well as the poor copies that have been showing up on television and VHS over the years.
The colors are vibrant, in particular the reds which don't give a hint of bleeding into the frame, and the image looks I imagine as close to the original as possible given the fact that this film is almost fifty years old now.

This has been one of my favorite movies since I first saw it on NBC in the 60s, and when I saw the restored version last year in Seattle, the animated, standing-room-only crowd went from a gasp (as Burr looked down) to an outright shriek (when he looked up).

Jimmy Stewart plays a magazine photographer who's stuck in his apartment while his broken leg heals.  He spends his days peering out the rear window of his apartment into the open windows of the apartments across the courtyard.  He sees lots of life stories, parties, arguments, sex, just about everything that happens in real life.
One thing in particular catches his eye though.  He sees what he thinks may be a man (Raymond Burr) trying to clean up and hide evidence after murdering his own wife.  He doesn't witness the murder itself, so he spends the next few days, with the assistance of his Park Avenue girlfriend (Grace Kelly) and his hard-nosed nurse (Thelma Ritter), trying to find enough evidence to prove it.

228454,4,6300183513,"This was the first Alfred Hitchcock movie I have seen and I enjoyed it very much.  I thought it was interesting the way he made opposites attract with James Stewart's character, Jefferies, and Grace Kelly's character, Lisa.  Jefferies was the type of person who like adventure.  He would be gone for days on trips and wouldn't get to take a bath, that was until he broke his leg.  Lisa, on the other hand, was a glamorous and polite uptown lady who always wanted things her way.  She tried to persuade Jefferies that they were meant for each other until she got caught up in all of the commotion of a suspected crime in the apartment building across the courtyard. Since Jefferies was stuck in a wheelchair, Lisa became his legs.  She went to the apartment building and got the name off of the mailbox.  She also went into Mr. Thorwald's apartment and took his wife's wedding ring.  When Mr. Thorwald got home and found her in the bedroom, he backed her into the living room with her back facing the window.  She pointed out to Jefferies that she had the ring, but she didn't mean that she only had the ring.  She also meant that she was ready to get married.  I really liked the end.  Lisa was laying on the couch reading a book and a magazine dresssed in pants, a shirt and a rag in her hair.  Jefferies was asleep in the wheelchair with two braken legs instead of one.",976579200,,1371,4.392857142857143
228455,5,6300183513,"Alfred Hitchcock stated in an interview, ""When someone looks out the window and sees someone in a window doing something, they don't say 'Oh, it's none of my business',and leave-they stay and look out."" That is the premise of his voyeuristic masterpiece, ""Rear Window."" ""Rear Window"" contains no blood, little screen violence, no nudity, obscene language, special effects, car chases, explosions, or MTV hit songs-almost all the prerequisites of what constitutes today's ""Big hits."" However, ""Rear Window"" contains a tight, witty, insightful script, fine performances, a charmingly lovely and beautifully dressed heroine,superb camerawork, and one large, realistically detailed set of an apartment courtyard. Hitchcock stated that this apartment courtyard was a microcosm of humanity-people in all of their frailities, foibles, and secrets. I went to see ""Rear Window"" with a friend when it was re-released in the early 1980s (I hadn't seen it in years), and sat through it TWICE. There was one fly in the ointment. In the scene when Grace Kelly gets into Raymond Burr's apartment, some fool behind me said ""Oh finally, something's HAPPENING!"" Pretty indicative of the number of individuals out there who can't see past the end of their nose! I have seen this film innumerable times-I even play the videotape sometimes while I'm ""doing other things around the house""-it's a pleasure to listen to, let alone watch. Just try and look away!

The audience audibly reacted to the masterful build-up of suspense and spontaneously applauded when the movie ended.  Never before or since have I been witness to such a positive reaction at the movies, and it has stayed with me all these years.  The term ""popular artist"" is not an oxymoron in Hitchcock's case, and ""Rear Window"" is Hitchcock at his very best.  It's a movie (or ""film"" if you prefer) that can be appreciated on a multitude of levels, from ""pure cinema"" (Hitchcock to Truffaut), or simply as a rousing crowd pleaser, or better still as a combination of both.",975888000,,649,4.6173913043478265
228506,5,6300183513,"Finally, ""Rear Window"" has made it onto DVD!  The 1954 suspense classic, shot almost entirely in one room, and starring a cast with panache and style to spare, has long remained on Amazon's list of Most Requested DVDs, as well as the ""most wanted"" list of many film lovers, after a long stay in the ""out-of-print"" category.  But Universal comes through!
""Rear Window"", to a certain degree, moves at a languid pace, not unlike the steamy weather conditions in which it takes place.  However, the witty and concise dialogue, matched with the murder that occurs across the courtyard (the evidence of which is pieced together by Stewart, Kelly, and Thelma Ritter...and what's a Hitchcock movie without somebody getting whacked?), and interesting supporting characters like Wendell Corey as the skeptical Lt. Doyle; a pre-Perry-Mason Raymond Burr; and Ross Bagdasarian, the voice behind Alvin and the Chipmunks(!)--it all comes together in a fascinating hybrid that has remained a landmark classic for almost 50 years.
Like ""North By Northwest"", ""Vertigo"", and ""Psycho"", all of which have preceded this movie on DVD, ""Rear Window"" appears to have some intriguing special features--a nice touch, especially considering the movie's age, and that none of the stars are with us any longer.  The archival and historical additions make the DVD not only a pleasurable viewing experience, but also a study and an insight into Hitchcock's brilliance.

But the real star of the show was Thelma Ritter as Stella, the insurance company nurse.

228515,5,6300183513,"""We've become a race of peeping toms. What people ought to do is get outside their own house and look in for a change."" So says Stella (Thelma Ritter) at the start of ""Rear Window"". Alfred Hitchcock's best film and one of my all-time favorites. It's a key line into the film which was taken from a short story called ""It Had To Be Murder"" written by Cornell Woolrich and made into a screenplay by John Michael Hayes.
""Rear Window"" gives Hitchcock the chance to explore one of his favorite themes;voyeurism. L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) is a photographer for a magazine who managed to break his leg in an automobile race track accident. He has a cast from his foot up to his hip and has been in it for 6 weeks. Jeffries' passes his time by staring outside his window looking (or spying) at his neighbors. I've noticed many people seem to overlook something cruical in this. Jeffries as the saying goes is a ""watcher"" NOT a ""doer"". He is by profession a photographer. He's always seeing the world through his lens. Never actually experiencing life himself. I bet even if he wasn't injured it seems like the kind of thing this guy would do anyway. It's in his blood. It's how he makes his living. By capturing moments of people's lives or popular events. But, one day, Jeffries is going to see too much.
 What makes ""Rear Window"" such a great film is the way the screenplay is constructed. The viewer never knows more than the lead character. Everything we see, we only see becuase that's exactly what he sees. We can only draw the same conclusions he does, because we only know as much as him. If he says 1+1=3, we have to go along with him, because we don't know otherwise. And this is where all the suspense leads in. You see, for those who have never seen this movie. Jeffries thinks he has seen one of his neighbors murder his wife. Mr. Thorwald (Raymond Burr, who would later become a lawyer, go figure!) was seen leaving his house several times durning the night. We see him wrap up a saw and knife. And the next morning his bedridden wife is gone! Was she murdered? Or is there a reasonable explaination for everything? We are lead to believe she was murdered.
 Hitchcock has such a confident feel for the material. I don't know if his directing was ever better. Some may argue ""Psycho"" or ""Vertigo"" but, whichever film you chose you can't deny how brilliant his directing is here. The way he adds to the suspense. Our emotions go back and forth. Was there a murder committed or not?
 As with all Hitchcock films you can expect that dry wit. In my opinion it has never played off as well has it does here. It's all over the place. Take Thelma Ritter for example. She plays an insurance company nurse sent to take care of Jeffries. Her dialogue is full of witty remarks. Just about ever word she choses to use seems inappropriate at the time. There is also a character named ""Miss Lonelyheart"". A scene involves her getting dressed up, ligthing some candles, dimming the lights, fixing the dinner table and than pretending she has a gentleman guest. It may not sound funny as you read it, but, to see it will put a smile on your face.
 Besides Stella (Ritter) no one enters Jeffries apartment except Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly, looking her absolute best!). A designer who is a well known Manhattan socialite. Things are rocky in their relationship as Jeffries thinks she is ""too perfect"". But, naturally it's takes a murder to bring them together.
 ""Rear Window"" was quite a big hit when first released. Hitchcock was at a peak in his career when this was made. The movie was nominated for 4 Oscars including ""Best Director"". When is was made it was also the largest set on the Paramount lot. But, that doesn't stop the movie from having a big city feel to it. Here's a Hitchcock movie any true Hitchcock fan HAS to see.
 Bottom-line: Alfred Hitchock's best film. One of my all-time favorites. Great directing, great acting and chemistry betwwen Stewart and Kelly. Hitchcock at the top of his game.",961545600,,4008,4.552011095700416
228550,5,6300183513,"Few films offer this much attention to detail. Hitchcock created one of the most elaborate and stylish films ever made. Jimmy Stewart is in top form playing L.B. Jefferies, the photographer who enjoys to spy on his  neighbors in his free time. The beautiful Grace Kelly delivers a strong  female presence in the film, the scene where she first kisses Stewart is  incredibly sexy. While she is not remembered the most by her acting, but  then Hitchcock always said he used women as 'sex objects' and chose them  for their looks (the blonde goddess look seems to be his favorite), however  politically incorrect his methods were, it sure worked, and will keep on  working. Maybe Hitchcock's greatest accomplishment was making us feel like  a 'voyeur', and thinking that Stewart spying on his neighbors is a natural  thing, and we even want him to, more and more, as we get enthralled in the  mystery; did Mr. Thorwald kill his wife and is he really chopping up her  body?. We get hooked on that premise and that is when Hitchcock takes us  for a ride into his psychological roller-coaster, making us; the 'viewer',  feel like the 'voyeur', when we know that it is not right. The extremely  suspenseful ending is a knock-out and the whole film is an example of  Hollywood in it's golden years and of a genius at his peak. Extras: the  usual Hitchcock cameo; the person adjusting the clock in the piano player's  apartment. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 10!",961027200,,1463,4.65234375

Further proof that Rear Window  is so incredibly great, is that it is able to completely enthrall  both  passionate cinema viewers, as well as casual movie viewers.

228554,5,6300183513,"One of Hitchcock's best; he often made us feel as though we were spying on people in his films (like in ""Psycho,"" ""Strangers on a Train"") but this one was probably his most obvious attempt to cash in  on the natural craving of human beings to want to know other people's  business (""get the dirt on them,"" so to speak).  Jimmy Stewart  plays L.B. Jeffries, a photographer who is laid up in his apartment with a  broken leg.  Out of boredom, he spends his days and nights staring out of  his apartment window into the rooms of other tenants across from him.  One  night, he hears some strange goings-on in the apartment directly across  from his; little by little, he begins to suspect that the man who lives  across from him (played by Raymond Burr) has murdered his wife.  Able to  withstand multiple viewings, unlike many murder mysteries, particularly  because of the standout performance of Thelma Ritter, as Stewart's  wisecracking comic-relief nurse Stella, who starts out disapproving of his  spying but later becomes just as curious as he does about what is  happening.  There's a touch of Hitch in Ritter's character - she  demonstrates perfectly the macabre sense of humor that Hitchcock tried to  inject a little bit of in all his films and in his TV show (her comments  about how she thinks Burr did it will keep you laughing throughout). Grace  Kelly is  very good as Stewart's girlfriend, who also gets in on the  voyeurism game and almost goes too far (in one of the most suspenseful  scenes in the picture - you'll be biting your nails the first time you see  it).  It's interesting how (in keeping with the theme of voyeurism) the  activities of all the apartment house tenants center on either sex or  death, the two great taboos which human beings naturally shy away from  discussing openly.  Definitely worth the price of the DVD - highly  recommended for purchase.",956793600,3,1885,4.722222222222222

228556,4,6300183513,"One of the joys of Alfred Hitchcock films is his ability to take social taboos, present them in an enticing context, throw in major stars we know and love to perform them, and thus make abhorrent behavior seem attractive!  'Vertigo' is the best-known example of this Hitchcock trait ('Psycho' also  comes to mind), but 'Rear Window' is the most fun to watch, because of the  appealing combination of James Stewart and Grace Kelly!
Stewart is a  photographer, laid-up while recuperating from an accident (cleverly shown  through photographs in his studio), who, out of boredom, begins spying on  his neighbors. Jimmy Stewart a 'Peeping Tom'? Only Hitchcock could get away  with this!
Of course, Kelly, as his high fashion model girlfriend, and  Thelma Ritter (who is fabulous as his nurse), are appalled by Stewart's  behavior, but are drawn into voyeurism by Stewart's devotion to it,  particularly after he witnesses an apparent murder (committed by Raymond  Burr, in one of the most wonderfully EVIL roles of his career!)
The film  takes on a cat-and-mouse intensity, as Stewart attempts to prove Burr's  guilt to his skeptical policeman buddy (nicely played by Wendell Corey). To  add a touch of sexual foreplay to the proceedings, Kelly models a variety  of '50s evening and nightwear, while teasing the injury-constrained Stewart  (""Previews of Coming Attractions"", she purrs). All this leads up  to a fabulous, claustrophobic finale, with camera flashes, and a twist  ending that is pure Hitchcock magic!
