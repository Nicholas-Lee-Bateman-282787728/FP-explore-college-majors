2384402,4,B000AC7OV6,"Frightenstein, to me- seems like a show
that never planned on gaining the following
it has today; it didn't get its fans by being
the most commercial show out there.

It was a low-budget Canadian show,
that had almost an accidental brilliance to it.
Whether you were 5 years old...or 10 years old-
or 30 years old, you never forgot the unique feeling
of watching an episode

It was just something completely different.
So bizarre and entertaining, yet so simple!
Nothing ever changed in that castle.
We always knew that Igore would never keep his new pet,
we always knew the gorilla would get bonked with the ball,
and we always knew that Grammar Slammer would never let
Bammer actually SLAM Igore....

But we just couldn't change the channel!
Even if you hated the show- its originality
stayed in the back of your mind- tattooed on your brain.
For some people it was even a guilty pleasure-
that they came home early from work to watch!

Vincent Price and Canadian actor Billy Van
made this show something special.
A true gem from our childhoods.
And now...with its long awaited DVD release,
a whole new cult...is about to discover....
THE CASTLE OF COUNT FRIGHTENSTEIN !!!!!",1122249600,18,1176,4.75
8077717,1,B000AC7OV6,A laugh trac and horrible editing took a once great show from my childhood and ruined it.  Which does not surprise me when it had to be Americanized.  This version is garbage don't waste your time and money purchasing this item.  Obviously the producer has never seen this show in it's original form.,1383782400,,300,4.622641509433962
8077718,5,B000AC7OV6,"I loved this show as a teen, and did not think I would ever see it's like again.  I am so thankful I found it on Amazon!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!",1224892800,,156,3.696969696969697
8077719,5,B000AC7OV6,"Thanks for the reviewers who said to get the Canadian version. To think of the U.S. version of this DVD having an added laugh track and the original 1 hour episodes hacked up to 30 minutes makes me cringe. I'm enjoying this DVD set as a first time viewer. Very campy fun. I first heard of this show as a preview on a Digiview ""Kimba The (White) Lion"" dollar DVD. We have yet to find a copy of the $1 DVD but in our search found the set for sale. As mentioned earlier, try Amazon Canada, You can get the DVD set for less than $25. The US to Canadian dollar conversion is almost the same. I've seen the Canadian version on an online Auction site (Starts with an E ends in Y) go for $75. It pays to shop around.",1181952000,2,708,4.028368794326241
8077720,5,B000AC7OV6,"It's clear that the 3-DVD from Canada is a far superior version.  13 full one-hour episodes vs. 4 chopped up half-hour episodes on the US version.  Whether you're a long-time fan or just discovering this hilarious horrorthon, the version from our neighbors to the north is surely the way to go.  Check out the alternate new/used section to see if it's available from indy sellers.",1179360000,14,380,4.815384615384615
8077721,5,B000AC7OV6,"Great version, b ut the original Canadian one is better, longer, and doesn't have the stupid kid laughter.",1174262400,12,106,4.944444444444445
8077722,2,B000AC7OV6,"the two stars r 4 billy. i live in canada and i can tell you that the show is one hour long. not the 30 min cut up hunk of scrap that is this disc. also, a laugh trax? for shame. for shame. good thing it's back on the air in canada.",1158796800,6,232,3.480769230769231
8077723,5,B000AC7OV6,"I've had delays before on ""Amazon-supplied"" items and don't mind waiting, but why do you have it still listed as 7-10 working days for delivery when mine is now extended 3 more weeks?

That said, Frightenstein was my intro as a kid to scary stuff in the 70's and made it easier for me to watch and enjoy the films intended to scare.  So for kids today it's still fun to watch and at the same time, when they see monsters in the ""scary"" movies they know it's just guys pretending.  Great stuff",1154476800,,492,4.268817204301075
8077724,2,B000AC7OV6,"I am outraged, I live in Calif and they refuse to send it to me. I loved the show as a kid and now not even a tease this is discrimnation!!!!I would have give 4 stars but all you get is a 1. please send me dvd, pleas.",1143244800,,217,3.5416666666666665
8077725,4,B000AC7OV6,"Like most of the other reviewers I remember this show from my childhood.

First off, I was very impressed with the quality of the DVD transfer of this show.  The only bits of this show I've seen since childhood were off the internet and those were low quality. I've also read in various places that the orignal master reels may have been destroyed.  So I was very impressed when I popped this in and see a very vibrant, crystal clear image. Some of the effects definately show thier age, but the image and sound are both excellently preserved.

The show itself is just as fun, silly, bizzare and charming as it was when I was a child.  Several times I found myself laughing at the jokes just on account of how corny they are.

As others have also said, it is wonderful to see Vincent Price and hear that voice again.

The show definately still works for children, and it still works as an adult too.

This is VERY much worth picking up again.

4 out of 5 stars because very, very little will ever get 5 stars in my opinion.  The picture and sound could be a little cleaner still (Though they are great) and I would like to see a wider selection of classic rock songs on the next DVD (Though I understand licensing will play the biggest role in that).",1142640000,4,1250,4.32618025751073
8077726,4,B000AC7OV6,"I do say that it is great that a show has been brought back to life (which most have forgotten). Anyways, its wonderful seeing the master of horror Vincent Price at his best and the great comedian acts of Billy Van (which were many) and crew. A great childeren's program for the young and old at heart.",1133827200,2,302,4.315789473684211
