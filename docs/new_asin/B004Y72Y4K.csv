8447957,5,B004Y72Y4K,"A number of other reviewers have carped at the amateurish level of performance and videotaping / editing, whether Schechner used actual Living Theatre members or NYU kids, etc. I disagree with all of that, you are brought right into the theatre space by this film; both Richard and Brian are geniuses. This DVD reminds me of the work of American photographer Max Waldman (1920-81), who photographed the original Dionysus In 69 dancers, naked, in the live-birth scene, with his trademark grainy-printing and raw immediacy.  In this DVD, their clothes are a distraction only if you let them be, the emotions on view are quite naked. This is a valuable addition to my DVD library and I'm thrilled to have a copy.",1510099200,,709,4.859504132231405

8447959,3,B004Y72Y4K,"Raw, very 60s, interesting take on the play. The presentation is all latter day hippie, but Euripides text is also used for sometimes striking effects. Worth the modest price for a student of theater or of the 60s. Has not aged well as a production.",1415059200,,249,4.555555555555555
8447960,3,B004Y72Y4K,"Yikes, this is a really crappy transfer.  The dialog is totally out of sync with the action.  Very disconcerting.  Video is fuzzy.  Wow.  I guess we should be lucky to have even this (for us diehard DePalma fans), but wow, I can't help but be disappointed.  Potential buyers beware...",1414454400,,284,4.6938775510204085
8447961,5,B004Y72Y4K,the actors wore more clothing for the film than they usually did in performance.  That was disappointing as it was so not 1960's.,1390867200,,129,4.608695652173913
8447962,3,B004Y72Y4K,"There's no other release of this title for hardcore fans of Brian de Palma -except an extremely rare and expensive european edition- so there's no much place to look for alternatives to this edition than not even has the title of the movie on the side of the box. Surprisingly, on the back of the box the synopsis is actually a description of the film that says, literally, that is a bad movie performed by amateurs... An extremely poor edition for De Palma's most obscure work.",1367971200,3,478,4.569767441860465
8447963,5,B004Y72Y4K,"This is a film made of the legendary Living Theatre production of the Greek classic. The story of this production already exists in book form...a book carefully preserved on the shelves of many theater directors, producers, actors, and academics. Now in a surprisingly good film by De Palma, we are able to watch this ground-braking performance. This is ""HAIR"" for real. This is a political, social, sexual, and artistic statement made by people who actually 'lived' what they believed. They didn't perform the Dionysus  ritual, they lived it! They celebrated it. I have read bad reviews of this film from those who obviously know nothing of its origins or it's purpose. They want I guess a glossy, Disney version of the Greek tale. This film is as rough as the production itself. This is what people in theatre all ""Rough Magic!""  Someone also said the acting seemed amateurish. I totally disagree. These people were gifted actors who were putting their careers on the line to explore new ways of storytelling and new ways of using a performance space. For me, the film is thrilling, and the ideas often stunningly potent.",1365811200,3,1123,4.905263157894737
8447964,4,B004Y72Y4K,I bought it because I am studying different experimental theatre works. This was really good for my study. Great buy!,1364083200,,117,4.9
8447965,4,B004Y72Y4K,"The film is compelling, although I would recommend reading the reviews on IMDb first! The notes about parts of it being hard to watch should be taken seriously.

This is a split-screen B&W film of a performance of a play in the late '60s. The play is classic and the performance is energetic.

The film pauses (momentarily) frequently. Since the sound track is not affected, this is not likely to be a disc problem, always a possibility with a DVD-R. This could be a compression artifact, but then again, it may not be. An alternate possibility suggests itself when it is noticed that the sound track is not quite synchronized with the action. The film may be a separate soundtrack of one performance merged with film from (I have read) three cameras used during two performances. The pauses might be to help synchronize the images to the soundtrack a bit better. Also, this is an art film, and the pauses could well be for artistic reasons. Stranger things have happened.

Momentary pauses or not, the film is a compelling record of part of what was going on in the late '60s.",1329523200,10,1077,4.628272251308901
