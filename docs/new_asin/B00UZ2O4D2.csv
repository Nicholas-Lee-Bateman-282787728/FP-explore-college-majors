7071982,5,B00UZ2O4D2,"I wasn't sure about this film, it was my boyfriends pic, but I ended up loving it. The movie did a great job connecting us to the main character, and the fight scenes were well coreographed, but not endless! I initially didn't think Sean Penn would be believable as soldier, but he did a fine job with this role. This movie was really well done, my only criticism is that the character of his girlfriend should have had a little more depth. Otherwise it was a great movie",1434326400,14,471,4.363636363636363
7071983,1,B00UZ2O4D2,"After taking out the minister of mines of the Congo he goes into hiding and tries to start a new life. Years later he returns to the Congo with another organization and finds out that some people haven't forgotten what he did and attempt to assasinate him. He must now return to his old ways after finding out their is a plot to take out his former group. I was not a fan of this movie. These kind of movies are usually full of action. They tried though to make this more of a love story than an action movie and it failed. Sean Penn went off the liberal deep end in his personal life and tries to bring that into this movie which makes this movie way too boring. Maybe it was my fault for expecting another Jason Bourne type movie but this movie is not even close. Unfortunately, if you saw the trailers, you have seen all the action parts of the movie",1432425600,6,853,4.175757575757576
7071984,2,B00UZ2O4D2,"I didn't want to do this anymore. Terrier (Penn) is a very successful assassin. After taking out the minister of mines of the Congo he goes into hiding and tries to start a new life. Years later he returns to the Congo with another organization and finds out that some people haven't forgotten what he did. Terrier must now return to his old ways in order to save his own life. I love assassin movies. They are usually exciting, tense and full of action. There have been a few exceptions, but for the most part I have liked them all. This is one of the exceptions. I think Sean Penn is a great actor and does amazing work, I think personally though he is boring and takes himself a little too serious. That comes across in this movie. He seems to not be having fun and enjoying himself in this movie and it really comes across on screen. Im sure many people will enjoy this one but to me the fact that he seemed that way was distracting to me and took me out of the movie. The added point of him having a debilitating brain condition was also distracting and really was unnecessary. All that said this isn't the worst assassin movie I have seen, but its certainly not the best. Overall, nothing terrible, but I lost interest pretty quickly in this. I give it a C+.",1431648000,3,1264,4.315126050420168
7071985,2,B00UZ2O4D2,"What does the Gunman get right for action fans? Plenty of things. Sean Penn is a believable hitman cast into a dangerous situation, dealing with it the best way he can. He avoids danger when possible, but if confronted, he is more than a match for the tough henchman against him, as he quickly decimates them one by one, through fisticuffs or through gunfire. He's efficient and strong. When there is action, it's usually well shot and choreographed.
But that leads to the problem. There needs to be more action for this particular story to save the movie. The story starts off promising, but by the turning point at his old cohort's mansion with his former girlfriend, the story takes a nose dive in terms of logic. Not by Penn himself, but by the villains and their disposable mindsets, as one of them pretty much throws his life away without much explanation. The audience loses a lot of respect when a potentially worthwhile villain so easily disappears from the picture due to folly instead of circumstances. If they make it due to his own foolishness, convince us why, even if it's just one more time. Why did he do this? Let us know his motivation so we can believe it.
Unfortunately the movie never answers that question beyond our assumptions, and then we're left with the final villain, who gives one of the most grating speeches to Penn, who thankfully retaliates despite Penn's constant, painful headaches that put him in harms way, but not in a good way the audience can root for. Just an easy way Penn can get caught due to his seemingly unavoidable vulnerability. Kind of like giving Superman Kryptonite. Those scenes are rarely fun to watch, as our hero is reduced to nothing and at the enemies' mercy. Not because the enemy is a worthy match, but because of a cheat. Make the enemy earn it, not get a free hit. Thankfully the story plays this card early enough, so it's convincing that this will eventually become a problem later in the story.
Certain story twists can ruin a potentially good action movie, and in this case, the story was lost for me despite the exciting action scenes, as few as there were in The Gunman.
Penn is definitely in shape to be an older action hero along the lines of Neeson (Taken series), though this script just needed some major revisions to its villains with an increase in action to be truly satisfying as an action fan. Almost, but not there. Disappointing movie, though it does have some action worth taking a look at.",1430784000,9,2472,4.633257403189066
7071986,2,B00UZ2O4D2,"Jim Terrier (Sean Penn) works as a bodyguard in the Congo and also is a secret operative for a mining firm. Annie (Jasmine Trinca) works for a non-profit and his cover is protecting her, a job with benefits. When the Mining Minister announces he has cancelled all contracts, Jim's job is to be the trigger man and to leave the country, something that bodes well with co-conspirator Felix (Javier Bardem) who has designs on Annie.

Eight years after the deed, Jim is back in the Congo (without Annie) working as a well digger, a self imposed penance. Then out of the blue some well organized guys want to kill him. He returns to Europe in an attempt to find out who is behind this. Now being a trained gunman going after the bad guys isn't enough in the movies anymore. Jim is handicapped by post concussion syndrome and is instructed to stay away from ""rough sport, loud concerts, and East End pubs."" He has memory problems so he writes everything down. He also has mood swings etc.

Our protagonist can no longer be a super spy as I think Matt Damon has set the bar too high. Now the latest gimmick is that they have to be handicapped and only be able to use half their brain, half the time. The fact that this didn't work well with ""Dying of the Light"" didn't deter ACE et al to make us another menatlly handicapped hero, who really was a corporate assassin, which some people see as a bad guy. The scruffy looking Sean Penn, who never combed his hair, and loved by Annie, didn't fare any better than Nicolas Cage. The action consisted mostly of the typical filmdom gun play of the ""gang that couldn't shoot straight"" against the protagonist. Coupled with plot predictability, the entertainment value ran on the low side.

7072005,1,B00UZ2O4D2,"I won't compare this to the book it's based on simply cause the book is far superior. Instead, we'll judge it on it's own merits. Needless to say they are minimal.

Sean Penn here tries to be a 80s action hero by way of old man action heroes like Liam Neeson. His sole contribution to this is being a sensitive liberal progressive who wants you to know no bulls were hurt in the making of the movie and that he feels very bad that he ever shot someone who wasn't white. Needless to say, it's a poor contribution. He seemingly wants us to feel like he's a good guy deep inside but all he really succeeds in doing is showing us that he hasn't thought about the character outside of the cliches he hears about what people want in the echo chamber where he lives. It's the first of many signs of contempt he has for the project and the audience it caters too.

All this would've been fine except that rather surprisingly the action sequences are pretty bad. They also take a while to get to and are rather short. Not short because they're those more realistic style shoot outs that you might see in a more high minded thriller or military procedural, they appear short because they probably didn't have much to work with and Penn seems drearily uninterested in them. His contempt for the genre is just everywhere here. Director Pierre Morrel seems to try and get some stuff out of it. He keeps things more gory than expected. It's amazing what a couple extra blood squibs can do. Morrel is unfortunately not able to work any of that Taken magic here.

The most interesting thing about this movie is the cast. It's all middle aged people or older or at least people that look middle age and older. On that level, it's interesting to see actual grown adults in various roles. It falls apart when they are playing games that are meant for young glamorous actors and actresses who don't have any life experience to offer yet. It's arrested adolescence on screen.

Penn is a weird case. He's overly political and more concerned with appearing smart by saying all the right things to the college faculty than in actually being smart and maybe forming his own opinions. Like many a person in the horrid western school system, he's mistaken intelligence with parroting back warmed over 60s cliches. When he's not attempting to act super smart, he's typically allegedly beating women like Madonna. Occasionally, he's risen above all this mess like his early pre-Into The Wild directorial efforts, which all 3 are excellent. He seems like potentially he has some talent that could be tapped and his choice of source material here was excellent but his own navel gazing has unfortunately killed this.",1471824000,,2685,4.6344537815126055

7072028,2,B00UZ2O4D2,"The Gunman strives to be a Taken, with Sean Penn as the middle-aged hero (who happens to be an ex-special agent). The result is, however, just disappointing.

In The Gunman Sean Penn is Jim Terrier, an ex-mercenary hired for some shady job in Africa, where he falls in love with a doctor Annie (Jasmine Trinca) working at a local hospital. Eight years later Jim is attacked by a group of mercenaries. So, who sent them? Who is trying to kill him?

The Gunman is directed by Pierre Morel, best known for Taken starring Liam Neeson. Obviously the directors latest action thriller wants to make an action star out of Sean Penn, but The Gunman just doesnt have something that is necessary for action movie, and that is the protagonist we all can relate to.

We don't know what Sean Penns emotionally detached character really wants to do. The convoluted story offers little to no thrills, and action set-pieces are just bland. The great cast including Javier Bardem, Idris Elba, Mark Rylance and Ray Winstone is not enough to keep the rehashed story afloat.",1458172800,,1053,4.743169398907104

Disappointed, as the cast is generally excellent, but the screenplay is drivel, and the action sequences are weak.  Several of the major characters are not native English speakers, so perhaps this contributed to the awkward dialogue and acting.  Several of Penn's movies devolve into comic melodrama (e.g. ""21 Grams""), and ""The Gunman"" also goes this route.  The chemistry between the romantic interests is not believable, Penn is in his '50s-'60s and from the get-go they act like PDA teens.

It's worth it. As a side note, I'm a huge fan of Bourne, Bond, and movies made of the same ilk. I teach Combatives, and spent my share of time carrying a rifle for a living. Sure, every movie takes license with certain aspects of any number of things. However, that's why you ""suspend belief"" when you watch a movie.

7072095,3,B00UZ2O4D2,"Sean Penn is a Hollywood rarity: an actor who can act. Some of his previous movie roles are outstanding (for example the eponymous Milk). So why, then, should he turn his hand to a run-of-the-mill action flick that requires little more than a generic going-through-the-motions shtick? True, his biceps are up for the part and he's nearly perfected the Stallone frown/grimace but apart from that there's little to hint that behind the cardboard there's a real human being. Which is a shame, because in the end there's no reason to make yet another action flick unless you don't have the talent to make better movies. We can only assume that Penn felt he could use the income boost that might result from making something to appeal to a mass audience a la Bourne Identity. But this is too gritty a movie to appeal to the popcorn-and-mouth-open crowd and it lacks the special effects necessary for pseudo-Bond. So in the end it's not clear who the movie will really appeal to. Fans of acting will be disappointed; fans of spectacle will feel cheated.

We can only hope Penn takes his talents on a more worthy outing for his next movie.",1446768000,,1132,4.688442211055277

7072116,4,B00UZ2O4D2,"The hero, one Jim Terrier, is an ex-Special Forces who has become a gunman, that is a mercenary. The story starts in 2006 when he and a handful of other similar types are in the Democratic Republic of Congo, officially protecting an NGO, and unofficially helping out the rebels and assassinating the Minister of Mining. After having successfully completed his mission, he has to leave Africa in a hurry, leaving behind him the woman he loved (Jasmine Trinca). Eight years pass, he had been back in Congo for over a year working for an NGO, presumably to appease his somewhat guilty conscience, when someone attempts to take him out.

I will not spoil the story by telling it, but it is rather easy to guess: our hero will go after those that are trying to kill him, of course. You can therefore expect some rather impressive firefights and close combat, again rather unsurprisingly, with most of the action taking place in Spain, or around Gibraltar, to be more precise, where the nasties headquarters happens to be. You can also expect some kind of moralising and a more or less happy ending, however implausible it may feel.

As for the actors performances, this is perhaps not one of Sean Penns very best. His role is not exactly a complex and original one as a freelance version of Daniel Craig (muscles included). He is nevertheless quite the part, provided you suspend belief, as he wipes out the nasties in one desperate struggle after another. Ray Winstone is his usual good self in his (also usual) role of the heros best friend always reliable and always there to help him out when he is down and alone. Javier Bardem, in the role of the envious and double dealing rival, does not have much to do apart from feeling sorry for himself, and, while just about, he is clearly not up to his best.

To conclude, if you are looking for a rather exciting action-packed film, and provided you do not cate too much about the quality of the at times implausible scenario and the just above average acting of the main characters, then you will like this one as much as I did and find it very entertaining. If, however, you are looking for a top class scenario and fantastic acting, then this one is probably not for you. A somewhat generous four stars because I liked this this thriller and it delivered exactly what I was expecting, no less, but no more",1445817600,,2352,4.595238095238095

The movie has a good story line, great acting, adventure, intrigue, great cinematography ,(Bullfight scene) and just an all around good movie. Sean Penns role could have been done by any of the greats like, Tom Cruise, Matt Damon or Mark Walberg, but Sean Penn pulls it off tremendously. This movie could do for Sean Penn what Pulp Fiction did for John Travolta. If you like a good espionage shoot them up movie, you will like this movie.",1440201600,3,655,4.6068376068376065

These stories are bit predictable, with the bad guys being complete bombastic idiots and the good guy being seriously roughed up but still able to out-muscle or out-think opponents (like the escape from the house).

7072245,4,B00UZ2O4D2,"I would have given this film five stars if it was not for the clich ending.  But in general, this film deserves four solid stars.  Like one of the commentators noted here, it is a 'standard' Hollywood action flick that starts off as a political thriller.  Sean Penn is really convincing as a special ops, well trained and one-step ahead type of macho...for a 55-year old he has kept his body in great physical shape.

The film includes an all international cast from England, Spain, and Italy, namely Ray Winstone, Idris Elba, and Javier Bardem.
I also, like the locations/settings of the film from Africa to London to Barcelona.",1439856000,,629,4.743119266055046

7072248,2,B00UZ2O4D2,"Initial positive thoughts for an action movie with some mention of the contemporary environmental and human problem of illegal (or corruption endorsed) mining in Africa. Followed by Penn showing how important potable (drinkable) water is to health in the undeveloped world. I thought, a rare intelligent action flick.  Wrong!. It just turned out to be formula clichd romantic triad which led into more formula of ""who is the mysterious bad guy"" hook; his identity was also obvious. Followed by all the really improbable shoot-outs with formula predictable scenes and outcomes. Not to be outdone, acting was also too scripted.

An aside, for solutions to clean water, as an informational source, there is a documentary DVD on a recent invention called Slingshot with which communities can clean water. Also, another tech innovation of filter papers in a book with impregnated antimicrobial capabilities in which the pages are removed to act as long lasting water filters.",1439769600,,970,5.292207792207792

7072250,1,B00UZ2O4D2,"This movie begs the question: ""Has Sean Penn fallen on hard times?"" or ""Was this some scheme to get free trips to Africa & Europe?""

The movie starts with some brief exposition about the main characters, then jumps ahead to ""present day"" (about 10 years) to find Penn who plays a (former?) assassin pulled back into action when an attempt is made on his life. He also suffers from headaches which a doctor later diagnoses as plaque build-up in his brain, probably induced by stress.

This movie includes: mysterious unseen figures giving dialogue, several shoot-outs including one in an Aquarium and an extended sequence where he finds his front door has been rigged to explode and manages to fool the bombers into blowing themselves up. Might be the best sequence in the film.

A few plot holes/bad twists later this thing ends at a bull-fight because someone (director? producer? etc?) wanted the bad guy to get gored by a bull? Oh sorry, should have said ""spoiler alert."" But seriously when at minute ~105 (of 116 minutes total) you wind up at the bull fights, you have to expect someone is getting gored by a bull, don't you?

This movie would make an excellent candidate for the podcast ""How Did This Get Made?""",1439596800,2,1216,4.721698113207547

I stuck with it, though, and was surprised to find a fuller, more tension-filled movie developing. Sure, Penn spends a lot of time without his shirt on to show how buff he is at his age, but fortunately there's a lot more to the film than just that. The dialog often crackles, and the action scenes are filled with suspense.

I'd love to see Penn in a well-thought-out action movie, spy thriller, or even a superhero movie, because the guy is pretty amazing when the action starts.  And of course he's one of our best actors.  But this movie fizzles out like an old Alka Seltzer.  Boring.

7072291,4,B00UZ2O4D2,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Sean Penn has been known to perform extremely well in many dramatic roles hes had over the years. But little is said of the action films hes made which is odd since his first notable roles was in BAD BOYS where he played a young troublemaker trying to stay alive in juvenile hall. That all could change with his latest film THE GUNMAN.

Penn plays Terrier, a hired mercenary for a global company with interests in the Congo. Part of a team, their latest target involves a man the company has paid influence money to. Rather than trust him they decide to take him out and Penn is the man assigned. This means that not only will he be required to kill this man he will also have to leave behind the love of his life, Annie (Jasmine Trinker), since a killer never stays once the hit is carried out.

Years go by and Terrier has returned to Africa, this time to actually do what his cover claimed years prior. Helping smaller towns to dig wells and solve their water problems during one drilling expedition a group of soldiers show not randomly but specifically seeking Terrier. In the course of events he defends himself stunning the locals hes been helping by taking out the group of soldiers and his cover is blown. The question is why were they there searching specifically for him?

Terrier leaves the country and seeks out and old ally, Cox (Mark Rylance), who sets him on a path to connect with Felix (Javier Bardem), one of the men from his group. Felix is now married to Annie having been in love with her prior to  s leaving years ago. The pair do not have the happy life that he had wished for and with Penn back in the picture things get even rockier. Invited to their villa in the country a drunk Felix argues back and forth with Penn eventually revealing, as Penn has already guessed, that hes called in troops to take him out. What he doesnt realize is that this is a total cleansing and everyone from the old team is being taken out one at a time.

Barely escaping, Annie in tow, Terrier heads for help. But who can he now trust? Who is behind all of these murders? And can he stop them from killing both him and before it all ends?

This is a nice thriller that holds your interest from one minute to the next. Penn does a fantastic job of playing the ill-fated assassin who has tried to make up for his past mistakes only to have them follow him to the present. Sadly Bardem is wasted here playing the love smitten puppy who thinks he can win the woman simply by eliminating his rival. His was the order that sent Penn out to kill all those years ago. But his character here is limited too little more than looking jealous and getting drunk.

The movie is well made, the cinematography stunning to watch be it the streets of London or in the wilds of the Congo. Even the night scenes, some of the most difficult to film for some, come out easy to see and not get lost in the shadows. Director Pierre Morel adds another top notch action movie to his list of accomplishments which include the first TAKEN, DISTRICT B13 and FROM PARIS WITH LOVE. With the way his movies have turned out so far hes a name I know Ill be looking for in the future, expecting some great action films under his name.

Perhaps the only odd thing about this movie is the juxtaposition between the actions of the lead character and his crew and the real life opinions of Penn. A staunch anti-gun advocate he joins the already long list of actors who portray gun toting men of action in their films while demanding gun ownership be restricted or banned altogether. But then again this is Hollywood, the land that calls for clean air action while creating more explosions than most other businesses in the world.
Truth be told it doesnt matter. As a movie goers Ill continue to watch the movies that these folks make and enjoy each and every one of them. The end product here is a watchable movie that entertains and thrills from start to finish. Penn does a good job and I look forward to seeing him in more roles like this. Add this movie to your list of those worth renting and watching.",1438300800,,4130,4.381201044386423

7072337,4,B00UZ2O4D2,"Jim Terrier' (Sean Penn) was once part of a mercenary-team operating in 'Congo' after conducting a
successful hit, killing the minister for mining, he then has to disappear for a time after the high-profile
hit.
Eight years later again in the Congo he works as a humanitarian aid worker trying to atone for his past
deeds, however when the camp is attacked by gunmen he realizes that he was the target.
He now has to find out the how's and why's of the attack he travels to London to make a start meeting
up with an old friend 'Stanley' (Ray Winstone) who will again offer help later on.
He begins to learn that he is in fact the last living member of the mercenary team of eight years past....
Now in 'Barcelona' he comes across and old associate 'Felix' (Javier Bardem) who is less than pleased to
meet up with a ghost of the past especially as he is now married to 'Jim's' ex 'Annie' (Jasmine Trinca)
The old-flame still flicker's for both 'Jim' and 'Annie' but, when invited to dine at 'Felix' and 'Annie's home
under the pretence of 'Felix' needing to speak to 'Jim' the house is attacked, could it be his old associate
had set him up.
There is much worse yet to come, the organisation that had exploited the resources of Congo cannot afford
to have 'Jim' tell 'Interpol' what he knows.
The film is well worth a viewing, there is plenty of action throughout much of the film, fire-fights and hand
to hand grappling.
There are many sequences of graphic violence and frequent use of colourful language.

I  thought  that it was very well acted, Mr. Penn's work was above par in this film. His portrayal  of a man living in 2 world's was well done, more so when the 2 world's collided. Fighting to protect and save the only thing in the world that meant anything to him, while the dark side of the world was doing its best to kill him. The support acting was well done also, in particular  the role of Stanley. The female lead however, could have been done better. The character is a woman  of strength, used to harsh situations and environments, and I felt that the character should have adapted to the situation a little sooner than was done. This could be editing though that made it turn out this way. The only reason that I didn't give the movie 5 stars is that it just could have been done better. I  still recommend  this film though, it's almost frightening how close to reality it comes.",1436572800,2,1038,4.321243523316062

He goes back but this time he is drilling water wells and staves off an attack and determines that they were purposely after him.

Although for a movie directed by Pierre Morel (Taken), I was expecting more action scenes.  The plot was predictable with an easily guessed villain.  Three way love triangle, mercenaries, backdrop of politically unstable Africa, no surprises.  Penn was physically believable as a highly trained mercenary, bulking up considerably for the role.

Gunman was like a more mature version of Taken.  There were 3-4 action scenes that were nicely staged.  The end fight scene between Terrier (Penn) and henchman Reiniger (Peter Franzen) was brutal, but could have done with fewer fast cuts.

I will say that this movie is incredibly well done and filmed. The film is directed by Pierre Morel who directed Taken and From Paris with Love so he a ton of experience with action style movies and it definitely shows. The story is easy to understand and clich yes but put together nicely and while there is a ton of talking that just makes the action scenes even more desirable in my opinion. The acting was top-notch by Sean and as for Idris Elba and Javier Bardem they were in it here and there but not much and they did all right but nowhere near there performances of the past. The action is where it is at in this film there are maybe half a dozen action scenes but Phenomenal I must say that had me believe this is definitely an R rated Taken and it shows.

than action movies. Thus, Sean Penn, being an ex professional killer turned humanitarian worker
(we are talking about Sean Penn, there must be a cause in the movie), and is dealing
with all the trained operatives that are sent to kill him. It is a relatively plain and easy to follow
story. The only difference with other such movies is that the woman involved (Jasmine Trinca) is
not the hot-karate-fighting babe that you expect, but rather a more down to earth beauty (maybe
Penn's current girlfriend does not allow babes close by).
Javier Bardem is ok, a shadow of the actor that for some reason won an Oscar a few years back,
and as far as acting etc there is nothing interesting here.

Again, it is an action movie, with nice fighting scenes. The bad guys are not government ones any
more, rather evil comes from multinational companies, but again nothing interesting in the story line.

7072495,2,B00UZ2O4D2,It seems like a TNT movie of the week.  Is there anything else beyond this stupid agent espionage s***e?  Is there any imagnination left?,1434499200,,137,4.666666666666667
7072496,3,B00UZ2O4D2,"The knife fighting scene is exciting and suspenseful. There are a couple of other scenes which are also full of suspense.

Sean Penns acting is engaging in action scenes. However, in emotion scenes, he's not convincing.

The best thing about this movie is the fighting scene where Sean used his cunning to kill his enemies instead of using guns. Ive never seen something like that before. Its gripping.

Overall, this film is worth watching once. I rate it 3 stars.",1434499200,13,465,4.7875
