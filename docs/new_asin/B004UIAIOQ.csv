8441562,1,B004UIAIOQ,"I would love to review the documentary ""Hungry for Profit"" but I've received it twice and both times it's the wrong DVD. The box and disc are labeled ""Hungry for Profit"" but the actual documentary on the disc is ""The Last Atomic Bomb"". Looks like they aren't paying too much attention at headquarters. I tried to find Richter Videos to call them but their website no longer exists. I have no idea who is sending these things out. Already returned one, the other is going to be returned today.",1310342400,3,492,4.53932584269663
