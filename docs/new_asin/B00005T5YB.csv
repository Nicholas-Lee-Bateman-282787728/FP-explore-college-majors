1660860,5,B00005T5YB,"Due to an overpresence of saccharine to non-existent scripting and plots, I tend to shy away from Disney's live action offerings. Even though they supposedly market to all ages, I never saw anything memorable...until this release.
Familiarity with former Representative Ronald V. Dellums (D CA)'s politics convinced me to give this dramatization a chance. Even if it employed some of the traditional scripting elements I despised in many youth videos, I would also be able to see anti-apartheid work of some kind.
The story centers around the learning experience his daughter Piper and a white South African exchange student named Mahree have when they (especially the lattter, who has to learn blacks are not placed on the earth to serve her) meet and learn each other are more alike and dissimillar.
Also inspiring is Mahree's implicit promise to take up anti-apartheid work upon returning to South Africa, given the likely loss of her own privlleged position this would entail. As an anti-racist white, I did not intially like the self-centered behavior exhibited by the earlier Mahree and found her change of conciousness much more enjoyable.
While this film (like many of Disney's offerings) is geared towards youth, I have personally watched this film several times and can readily attest anybody regardless of age will enjoy this video.",1041811200,25,1343,5.193548387096774
1660861,5,B00005T5YB,"A powerful movie with a triumphant ending! This video is suitable for all ages, and everyone should see it. It certainly earned every accolade it was awarded -- what more can I say?
I logged on to price this video, bcause after borrowing it from the library, I want to own it so I can share it with my friends and thier children.",1041206400,,329,4.238095238095238
1660862,4,B00005T5YB,"A year or so ago for black history month, Disney released The Color of Friendship, the story of Mahrie and Piper, two girls from two different races, sides of the world, and with different beliefs who come together through the foreign exchange program. Piper's father is Congressman Dellums, a man who has worked hard against slavery and racism and is now fighting it in South Africa. Mahrie happens to be the child of a South African policeman, a man who strongly believes in a partide. So, two girls from different situations become the best of friends and Mahrie is able to understand that sometimes what you are taught is not always right.",1011657600,2,643,4.75
1660863,5,B00005T5YB,"I am so amazed by this movie I can't begin to describe how much I enjoyed it.  Racism is an amazing part of our history, but it is somthing that we need to end.  This movie deals with a white girl from South Africa, who is sent to the United States, Specifically Washington D.C., to live with a Congressmen and his family.  The Duloom family took this girl in, despite her shock about them being black, and their shock about her being white.  Together, though, they overcame many odds and problems.
  This is an Inspiring True story that will get you thinking about what it means to be a free person in a country such as the United States.  It makes you think about what's beyond your country, and what they are forced to go through as well.  I would highly reccomend this movie, it is perfect for anyone needed anything, although it is geared at teens and young children.",1011571200,,872,4.40625
1660864,5,B00005T5YB,"This movie is great! It's for everyone and its not like most Disney Channel Original movie where they try to hard to make it for all ages.  This movie was perfect and dramatic. It's about a ""white"" girl living in South Africa and her father is an officer there. They don't treat ""colored"" people the way the should, and that's the way that girl was brought up. When that girl gets a chance to go to the United States, her new friend is a colored girl.  People try to break them apart, but the color of frendship is too strong.",1011398400,,526,4.25

1660926,5,B00005T5YB,"I remember when this movie first came out and how it was played over and over and over again on Disney Channel. I was pretty young so I got annoyed with the fact that that was the only movie Disney Channel played for quite some time. However, it's been almost two decades since I saw this movie. That seems so crazy to me. Watching it again brought back all the old memories and how much I loved it when I watched it for the first time. This was the first time I learned about apartheid and I remember talking with my mother after watching as a little kid about some of the stuff covered in the movie. I still love this movie and I wish Disney still did movies like this one. It seems to me, though I don't watch the channel anymore, that they don't. That's a shame. Anyway, great movie and it really helps you to see some of the stuff that America and South Africa were enduring in the late 70's as well as the line of racism.",1500422400,,927,4.12707182320442

1661094,5,B00005T5YB,Too many films about race relations and prejudice are either geared toward adults only or are so much about the past that they are too graphic and cannot be shown to children. This is not the case with The Color of Friendship. I am 43 years old and grew up in the south. I watch this movie over and over. The movie starts with both girls having preconceived ideas of what race the other should be based on the society and country that they live in. Early on they learn that they are wrong. This - along with so many other things - are lessons that adults too can learn from. This movie could easily be included as part of Black History Month - and it is actually shown on TV over and over during Black History Month - but could be included in media presentations at the local level if it were available on DVD.,1214611200,,810,4.198717948717949

It's an inspiring movie that highlights the issues with race relations that were prevalent in the 50's and 60's (and before), and it is filled with so much symbolism (such as Muhre's bird which Flora explains the uniqueness of at the end of the movie,etc.).

1661098,4,B00005T5YB,"""The Color of Friendship"" is based on the real-life story of the family of Congressman Ronald V.Dellums and their struggle to help end apartheid in South Africa in 1977.
 As Dellums, Carl Lumbly gives a strong and sensitive performance as a politician suddenly faced with the challenge of reshaping the attitudes of a white South African exchange student whose father is a policeman who has expressed his delight at the recent arrest of activist Stephen Biko before sending his daughter to America. As young exchange student, Mahree Bok, Lindsey Haun alternately displays arrogance, humility, and sensitivity as she comes to see the world in a different way.
  As Representative Dellums' wife, Roscoe and daughter, Piper, Penny Johnson and Shadia Simmons must deal with the initial shock of receiving a white student into their home when they had initially expected her to be black, and guide a reluctant Mahree through her initial shock of seeing blacks in prominent positions.
 Gradually, Piper and Mahree form a close bond, but world events, which I myself vaguely remember begin to take precedence over the girls' friendship, when Stephen Biko is killed by the South African police and Mahree forced to leave the Dellums' home to stay in the South African Embassy until she can be returned to her homeland.
 A despairing Piper calls her father at work to report the incident, Dellums and an entourage have a chat with the South African Ambassador, and Mahree is returned to her host family.
 Shortly thereafter, a heated confrontation between Piper and Mahree gives the latter a rude awakening to the fact that a powerful thing called the Court of World Opinion is against the killing of Stephen Biko and the government her own father represents. Tearfully, Mahree acknowleges this, as well as the fact that she has no control over the events in her country.
 The girls soon reconcile before Mahree goes home. But according to a reviewer on Amazon's affiliate site, imdb.com, the film's ""Disneyfied"" ending belies the tragic truth about what really happened to young Mahree: Upon her return home, the 16-year-old reportedly met the same fate as Stephen Biko--being taken into custody, interrogated about the Dellums, tortured and beaten to death by the South African Police--her father's own colleagues.
 If this is true, it doesn't surprise me; [...]
 If Mahree's tragic end is factual, she must then be eulogized as a young girl who learned to see the light of racial harmony a few years before many of her fellow white South Africans, and Dellum's successful efforts to dismantle apartheid are a memorial to her as much as to the many non-whites who suffered under it.
 I have withheld from giving this film all five stars because I question its historical accuracy. But the Dellums family is to be commended for lending assistance to the making of this film, and can be forgiven if they chose to skirt over the painful truth.
 Since I learned that story, this movie has been difficult to watch, but it is an important film for the young to see, even if it spares them an ultimate reality that is too unfathomable for many.",1108425600,15,3130,4.931558935361217

I recommend it for a fun evening or a teaching opportunity. The music sequences are a bit tedious, especially to an audience of boys (I have three of them), but overall this is a great kids movie.",1055894400,,561,4.544554455445544
