I'm sure the DVD will be an improvement, allowing one to skip from cut to cut more quickly.  The vhs came with a nice booklet with tabalature and tunings.  I especially like his version of He Punahele, very moving and not that hard, technically, to learn (but to play in Keola's style of nahenahe is another matter!).",1103155200,15,416,4.434210526315789
8020082,2,B00021TDQ4,"Great video for slack key stories.  The CD is also good for listening to slack key music.  However, if you are looking for finger placement or telling you which chords are involved, the video keeps panning back and forth from finger picking to fret and finger placement so you miss half of what is trying to be taught.  I also have had to go to you tube to fill in many gaps in playing the songs that were poorly shown on the video.  I have had better luck with Keola;s friend Mark Nelson on Jam-play.  He really walks you through  a more comfortable level of instruction instead of assuming you already know how to play slack key.  Don't get me wrong, Beamer is a master slack key guitarist but a bit unkind to the beginner.",1515888000,,725,4.325925925925926

Beautiful songs too - worth the effort to learn

Aloha!",1432598400,,94,4.222222222222222
8020085,4,B00021TDQ4,"It's got some wonderful songs on it with beautiful arrangements. The lessons note just a few things to know while playing each piece, but assume that you will already play fingerstyle tab quite well and can figure out the songs out on your own. I'm onto my third song and having a great time learning them. Probably the only issue I'm finding is that there are only a handful of songs in each tuning, so once you're in one tuning, you have to learn (or re-tune to) another tuning to play the others. It would be easier to have a book all in the same tuning. I handle this by keeping a few guitars in different tunings on hand.",1430697600,,626,4.26890756302521

8020087,4,B00021TDQ4,"and I wanted to learn how to play a few songs.  Keola Beamer is a master guitar player of the Hawaiian slack guitar.  This DVD is great for someone who has a bit of guitar knowledge already, it is definitely not for a beginner.  I like the history that Keola gives and his take on his style of Hawaiin slack guitar.  Once I learned a song I would listen to others playing the same song on YouTube to help add to the piece.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone wishing to learn this style.",1398384000,,489,4.105263157894737
8020088,5,B00021TDQ4,"Keola Beamer plays in such a way that one can't help but love the music, but he also makes it easy to comprehend the techniques he uses and teaches. Even though some of the songs are more advanced then my skill level, the way the techniques I'm working on improving are explained in such a way that it truly does help improve these techniques.",1378598400,2,343,4.375
8020089,2,B00021TDQ4,"as a beginner, cd was rated as level 3 , whatever this means.. I would have perferred a level 1 instructions. Many of the lessons assumed students understands what is being taught,, but in reality, student had know idea what Keola was explaining. Wanted a lesson in strumming/beat  could not find it. Song book showed finger placement, but know explanation on beats,. In general to confusing  for this beginner,, will stick to the ukulele..",1375747200,,440,4.9324324324324325
8020090,5,B00021TDQ4,"Keola Beamer is a master, an inspiration and a great human being. All of this is so apparent in this video. Thank you for sharing your talent and being so generous with your instruction.",1309219200,,186,4.5
8020091,2,B00021TDQ4,I have seen and listened to most all of Beamer's instruction and all of it seems way to difficult for me.  I am a pretty good learner but it always seems like his teaching takes a lot for granted.  Just my two cents.,1214870400,,216,4.0
