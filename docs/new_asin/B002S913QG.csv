3978351,5,B002S913QG,"I'm not a musician or particularly knowledgeable about music so I suppose this DVD was targeted at someone like me. I have watched two DVD's in the series ""Keeping Score"" the first being the Tchaikovsky 4th and now this the Shostakovich 5th. The tone of the first was playful and very enjoyable & I learnt a lot about how the composer put together his 4th symphony. This current DVD was in stark counterpoint to that in that the stakes for Shostakovich were those of life and death. I really learnt a lot from listening to Michael Tilsen Thomas's explaination of the background and reasoning behind the 5th Symphony of Shostakovich & I thought the performance of the piece as part of the 2007 Proms was outstanding. I want to see and hear more - Mahler's 1st, Brahms' 2nd, Sibelius' 4th all would be welcome additions to this series. Many thanks SF Symphony and MTT.",1258070400,21,866,4.62987012987013

3978353,5,B002S913QG,"Toward the end of the 55-minute documentary/lecture surveying the historical framework in which Shostakovich composed his Fifth Symphony in 1937, conductor Michael Tilson Thomas says, ""The music's purpose is to reach you. Inevitably, it will mean different things to different people. But we all know that Shostakovich is saying something urgent, serious and profoundly felt. What's left with you when the last note is played?""

In the superb 2007 Proms concert performance that ensues, in highest quality Blu-ray video and audio, Tilson Thomas follows the Sikorsky score, in which the disputed tempo of the finale's coda (at rehearsal No. 131) is marked at the slower eighth note = 188 instead of the improbable quarter note = 188 of the old Kalmus score Bernstein used in his celebrated 1959 recording. For me, in answer to Tilson Thomas' question, watching this Blu-ray bring to mind novelist William Faulkner's 1950 Nobel Prize acceptance speech, which -- after recounting the existential fears of the 20th century -- concludes:

""I decline to accept the end of man. It is easy enough to say that man is immortal simply because he will endure: that when the last dingdong of doom has clanged and faded from the last worthless rock hanging tideless in the last red and dying evening, that even then there will still be one more sound: that of his puny inexhaustible voice, still talking.

""I refuse to accept this. I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail. He is immortal, not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance. The poet's, the writer's, duty is to write about these things. It is his privilege to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past. The poet's voice need not merely be the record of man, it can be one of the props, the pillars to help him endure and prevail.""

Fueled by the publication of Solomon Volkov's ""Testimony"" in 1979 and by such divergent tempo indications for the ending of the Fifth Symphony in its two editions, controversy has raged for decades about its meaning. One camp sees the 1937 composition as caving in to the Soviet authorities who had excoriated Shostakovich for departing from acceptable guidelines in his highly successful opera Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District, providing in this symphony an ""optimistic,"" glorified conclusion incorporating the proper rules of Soviet Realism. Is it, in the phrase not coined by Shostakovich but often attributed to him, ""a Soviet artist's reply to just criticism""?

Or does the symphony instead, as Mstislav Rostropovich and others insist, speak out as a voice of dissidence against the Stalin regime, sounding out a hollow triumph behind a mask of irony to mock oppressive officialdom, declaring the composer's identification with the suffering multitudes who are beaten into the ""business"" of rejoicing by their masters?

This either/or debate is artificial and arbitrary. It ignores a third option in which the symphony is more of a personal matter than an address -- either pro or con -- to and about the Soviet state or the Russian people. Must a 21st-century audience know the ins and outs of the political situation in 1805 Vienna to appreciate Beethoven Third Symphony? In ""The Rest Is Noise,"" Alex Ross says Shostakovich's son Maxim described the Fifth as his father's ""Eroica,"" that its ""message"" is the hero's saying, ""I will  follow the way I choose"" -- that it depicts ""the determination of a strong man to BE."" In other words, Shostakovich's simple statement at the time offers the straightforward truth: ""The theme of my symphony is the making of a man. I saw man with all his experiences at the center of the composition."" Over the decades, Shostakovich's use of irony -- if not outright lies -- in public statements has caused many people to dismiss any comments he made about his music as suspect. But as Svetlana Savenko explains in her analysis of ""Shostakovich's Literary Style,"" translated by Laurel Fay in ""Shostakovich in Context,"" edited by Rosamund Bartlett (2000), it's not so difficult to sort out the attempts at obfuscation from fact. And she points out that in communicating with friends and confidants, Shostakovich was surprisingly simple and direct.

Thus, in the tumultuous conclusion to the Fifth, Shostakovich himself stands firm with his integrity intact. The forces aligned against him don't go away, but he prevails despite their onslaught. Bypassing the official injunctions against ""formalism"" -- that is, anything that smacks of individuality and the expression of tragic emotions -- the Fifth Symphony rises as a personal triumph for the artist over barbarism, over whatever forces would belittle the dignity and sanctity of existence, not just at one particular place and time, but anywhere, in any era. It seems that in doing so, he struck a chord with a wide audience of Russian people who could relate their lives to what he was saying about his own.

This performance, then, by Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony presents not a dusty museum artifact, applicable only for Stalin's Soviet Union of 1937, but a timeless creation that remains alive as an exemplar to demonstrate, as Faulkner believed, that humanity can and will prevail, under any circumstances.",1414108800,2,5459,5.029867256637168
3978354,5,B002S913QG,This work is my favorite and I wanted a good video recording of it.  Michael Tilson Thomas and the orchestra lived up to my expectations.  I would recommend this to any classical music fan who loves Shostakovich.,1393200000,,212,4.702702702702703

3978356,5,B002S913QG,"This concert recording was spectacularly played and recorded at the 2007 London proms concerts when the orchestra was on tour. The documentary concentrates on the events up to the writing of this symphony and then continues with events in Russia under Stalin thereafter.

The documentary makes extensive use of video film material from that period of Russian history plus film of Shostakovich. There is also modern footage of places and examples of importance and relevance. Musical extracts are taken to make points throughout and these are inter-cut with observations and reminiscences by Russian members of the orchestra as well as extracts from an 'educational' event for the audience based on the symphony.

Tilson Thomas takes us on an illustrated tour of the symphony explaining how it unfolds and relating it to the times it was written in. It becomes quite clear that the Bernstein approach, and Previn's, of a bombastic and joyous ending at speed is not appropriate. Instead we get quite a different ending where Shostakovich's implications of an alternative meaning as can be deduced from his 'Testament' publication years later. Tilson Thomas brings us the alternative meaning behind the notes that we can now expect. This is an approach that can be heard worldwide including in Russia. This is an excellent documentary.

The performance can simply be described as one of the most exciting and also one of the most moving that I have ever heard. Tilson Thomas is a very emotional type of conductor who can wring every last drop of feeling out of the music and out of his orchestra. In this case, and in addition, there are many of his colleagues who identify directly with the circumstances surrounding this composition. Their commitment and that of the whole orchestra is quite uncanny and is a powerful document.

The recording of the concert by the BBC is of excellent definition in every respect and the large audience, many of whom stand for the whole duration, are remarkably attentive and non-invasive of our concentration and enjoyment. The sound, as always defaults to DTS with a stereo option.

I would suggest that this is a very special disc and well worth purchasing while it remains available. The performance will stand comparison with the best otherwise available on CD or Blu-ray/DVD and the recording quality is in general terms, better than most. This series as proving to be a major musical statement.

Finally, this Blu-ray disc is clearly marked as 'Region 1' but nevertheless plays perfectly on my region 'B' Blu-ray player so presumably this is actually a region-free disc in reality. The labelling is therefore not the most encouraging and the use of a number code rather than letters is unusual.",1369440000,2,2733,5.035398230088496

Michael Tilson Thomas must be a genius; he brings forth the entire background of Shostakovich, the problems he faced during the communist regime and the way he composed his 5th symphony.

3978359,5,B002S913QG,This is an enthralling performance of Shostakovich's 5th symphony by the San Fransico Symphony under Michael Tilson Thomas. It is a performance made all the more thrilling after listening to his discussion of the symphony and reflections by members of the symphony with first and second hand knowledge of this period in Stalinist Russia.

3978360,5,B002S913QG,"MTT takes us on a journey to Russia to see with our own eyes the apartment building where Shostakovich lived and wrote this symphony, as well as the hallway where he slept so as to not awaken his family when the secret police came (as he expected) to take him away in the dead of night. The conductor takes us through each movement of the symphony, highlighting key passages and how he interprets their meaning. One of the focal points of his analysis is the ending of the final movement, which on the surface sounds triumphant but which has since been analyzed differently by many interpreters, including MTT. Then the disc concludes with a masterful performance of the symphony. All in all, a musical and musicological tour de force. Highly recommended for any lover of this 20th century masterpiece.",1323734400,4,802,4.776978417266187
3978361,5,B002S913QG,"Shostakovich lived through Stalins purges. He virtually destroyed the officer corp, by having many of them shot before the Second world war. His great five year plans caused thousands to die of starvation. Also,people simply disappeared. In 1936 after Stalin had seen the opera, Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk,( traditional opera conducted by Conlon, modern by Jansons, both on bluray),a article was printed in Pravada condemning him and his work. Shostakovich thought he was going to be taken away and shot. He slept on the stairs so his family would not have to see this happen. He did have to visit the authorities. When he returned the next day, the person who was going to interview him was himself taken away,so he survived. He wrote the 5th Symphony in response to this situation. It was termed by the authorities, a Soviet artists response to criticism. They liked it. But to Shostakovich it was a matter of life and death. He later stated, that whether the public liked it or not did not matter, but whether Stalin did. He also said that to him, Stalin and Hitler were alike,both facists.

Tilson Thomas in his lecture with his San Francisco Orchestra, shows us how Shostakovich placed coded messages in the music. The adagio is a Russian Orthodox Chant,which bids farewell to the departed, probably those killed by Stalin and his cohorts. The Last movement,outwardly cheerful, is actually a dig at the whole bloody regime. Taking the mickey out of forced rejoicing, which was created under threats. Your business is rejoicing. The symphony is really about the composers suffering. These messages in his 5-9 symphonies was the act of a very brave man, who knew if he were found out, was surely going to be shot as an enemy of the people.

Tilson Thomas was a pupil of Bernstein,this comes through very clearly in his conducting. I rather like this. Instead of simply standing there like a statue and giving vague movements of the arms,he jumps and uses sweeping movements of the arms. I notice that Tilson Thomas has the build of a marathon runner. He would be fit. I would suggest the more staid amongest you,keep away from this performance. His tempi captures the mood of the symphony. However,Gergiev's version is more gritty. I would suggest along with this symphony, you buy the DVD,Shostakovich against Stalin, the War Symphonies, 5-9. Shot on location in Moscow and St Peterburg,the film brings together archive film,personal recollections from Shostakovitch's family, friends and colleagues, and key extracts from the symphonies, conducted by Valary Gergiev. You get an insight into the ruthless dictatorship of Stalin after Lenin died.",1314489600,4,2646,5.011363636363637

3978367,2,B002S913QG,"Because of the good recommendations, I ordered this BD. And I am absolutely disappointed. If you are only interested in proofing your new BD-system, maybe you are satisfied with this BD. Audio and Video quality is excellent. If you expect a good intepretation of the Shostakovitch 5., I can't recommend this BD, you will be disappointed. There is nothing of the Shostakovitch typical seriousness, wich you have always to feel even in the lyrical parts. For me there is much to much ""easy listening""-character. Michael Tilson Thomas conducting is for me often unwatchable, because his movement absolutely doesn't fit to the music. He is jumping, actes, gesticulates in a way, that has for me nothing to do with the score of Shostakovich. So he is not able to create a atmosphere, there are no longer phrases, there is no suspense. In the first movement, after a few bars, he brings the orchestra really in trouble because his conducting is completly different from the pulse of the orchestra. Sorry, but I have the impression, that MTT is on this BD never really in the music.
So, as I said, if you want a excellent Audio/Video-quality BD, buy this BD. If you want listen to Shostakovichs stunning 5. symphony: Buy CD's with Mravinsky (Leningrad), Svetlanov, Barshai (WDR), Haitink (London Philharmonic).",1269129600,15,1303,4.981651376146789

3978370,5,B002S913QG,"In 1924 Lenin died and Joseph Stalin, named as one member of a troika to rule the Soviet Union, took sole power as leader of the country despite Lenin's earlier warnings. In the early 1930s, Stalin launched his disastrous collective farming plan, which resulted in six million deaths from starvation in the Ukraine alone. In the late 1930s, Stalin launched his Great Purge, which resulted in the imprisonment of thousands of citizens in Gulag labor camps. No sector of society was spared this punishment and many artists were targeted.
In 1936, Shostakovich fell from favor after his opera Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District was sharply critizised by Stalin and the Communist Party apparatus. Fearing for his life, Shostakovich composed his triumphant Fifth Symphony, which brought him back into favor with Stalin and the Party.
But was the Fifth really what it seemed? Michael Tilson Thomas dissects the symphony and shows that Shostakovich, taking a cue from Mahler's Fourth Symphony, was secretly mocking the Stalin regime by changing a few notes from the expected major key to a minor key.
Thomas presents newsreel footage of the 1930s to illustrate the fear that pervaded Stalin's reign and interviews artists from that age who tell what it was like to live under Stalin's rule.

I splurged because (A) I am in a Shostakovich mood;  (B) I really like the San Francisco Symphony;  (C) I appreciate the talent of Michael Tilson Thomas (I have absolutely nothing against his 'podium antics' ... what the heck is that?  Let him conduct how he will, if it brings out the proper sound from the orchestra!)  and (D), MTT gives the most amazing documentaries on the three 'Keeping Score' productions I have seen so far.

The documentary here is even better than I expected.  As usual he has taken a film crew to the actual places where some of the historical events occurred.  For example, he speaks from within the theatre where 'Lady of Macbeth of Mtsensk' made its debut.  When he tells about Shostakovich spending the night on the landing outside his apartment door, so that when the police came for him they wouldn't disturb his family ... he tells it from the very landing!  This stuff is truly amazing and if I were reviewing ONLY the documentary, it is a slam dunk to receive five stars which round up to 10 stars and beyond.

I also appreciate that Thomas does not bring up the controversial 'Testimony' (purported to be Shostakovich's dictated memoirs, but demonstrated and believed by many to be a fraud).  He does not even mention the book (or its author), much less&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/hit-you-over-the-head-with-it-and-insist-that-you-must-believe/dp/1565856856/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">hit you over the head with it and insist that you must believe</a>.  Thomas does interview several people including several in his own orchestra that grew up in Soviet-era Russia and let them speak their impressions and opinions (and Thomas himself met Shostakovich).  However, Thomas does not state that we ""know"" this or that, but merely that the Fifth Symphony among others ""may"" contain 'coded messages' that are still being discussed by scholars and musicians around the world.

The documentary was extremely interesting, and so then I thought we were going to repair as usual to Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco for the concert performance.  After all, Davies is not only the natural habitat of Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony, it is where the many musical examples and much of the narration was given for this wonderful documentary.  However, we were not treated to a concert at Davies, rather, we were whisked away to London (!) for a performance at the BBC Proms (double !!).

Now, I like the BBC Proms as well as anyone ... I have cherished memories of the noisy Role Albut Hole and its smelly loos, and the drinking fountains right next to the loos, where they can be conveniently smelt.  And I remember with fondness the rowdy crowds, and afterwards the pub crawl with warm beers, etc.  But this is not the ambience I was expecting for Shostakovich, being built up in the documentary.  I would rather have had the concert back home in San Francisco, or let be in St. Petersburg ... that would have been awesome.  But anyway, I was still looking forward to it, and so Role Albut Hole it is.

So here comes the noisy British block with his announcements and the concert began.

And musically, I have nothing against it.  As long as I keep my eyes shoot, I didn't mind it.  The acoustics there are nothing like Davies, but I am open to variety.  I do like the richer reverb, within reason.  But alas, the garish Brits, and their garish hot pink backdrop they had erected, or projected, with its neon blue pulsating frame ... that is just way, way too much.  The Fifth Symphony is a severe piece of music, and it just doesn't go with this ambience at all.  (Frankly I can't imagine what WOULD go with it, maybe a boxing match for drag queens, but let me not waste any more of my life speculating.)

And so, I blew money on the Blu-ray when the DVD would have been just as well.

But what a great documentary!",1475712000,2,4080,4.8328530259366
