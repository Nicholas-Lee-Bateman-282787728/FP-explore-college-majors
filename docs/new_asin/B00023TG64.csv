8021582,5,B00023TG64,"What a nice surprise.  All scholastic videos I have are great & this one included 3 stories I was unfamiliar with.including Princess Furball & Possum Magic.  I enjoyed them so much I purchased the books.  A pure delight & I learned that Princess Furball is an old ""Cinderella"" tale.  I love the Grandma in ""Posuum Magic""....so nice to see a tale about a grandchild & grandma...Excellent artwork & narration as well. Of course, Strega Nona complimented the book very well.  I highly recommend this for age 3 to 99!",1391644800,,513,4.719101123595506
8021583,5,B00023TG64,"This has always been one of my favorites in storytelling for kids......a moral lesson is told with great humor.
I highly recommend this video.",1356825600,,142,4.958333333333333
8021584,5,B00023TG64,"I recently ordered the Scholastic Treasury of 100 Classic Stories DVDs. Since I was impatient to get the order, I went to the library and checked out the Strega Nona DVD. This is a wonderful, lovely collection of stories. My favorite is ""Joseph Had a Little Overcoat"" from an old Yiddish song. I love that the story teaches how to be frugal, and how to make ""something"" out of ""nothing"". (You will have to read or see this story to understand what I mean). The book is worth buying too with interesting ""cut outs"", and even includes the song that inspired the book.

""Stone Soup"" also teaches how to make ""something"" out of ""nothing"", and that if everyone shares you can come up with something rather grand. One reviewer pointed out how ""Stone Soup"" lacked some of the action, and colorful illustrations of the other stories, but it is true to the original book which was written about fifty years ago.

""Strega Nona"" is delightful! She is a wise, old woman, even if she is a witch (which I'm not fond of), but the story is set in Italy, and is a good folk tale.

Check out the Bonus stories. This is a great addition to your child's video collection.",1255910400,,1151,4.4714285714285715
8021585,4,B00023TG64,"Grand kids love this story, so they really enjoyed seeing it come to life. Other folk tales on this DVD were also enjoyed. Great way to add fun to books they have read.",1255219200,,168,4.121212121212121
8021586,3,B00023TG64,"I read the Stega Nona series to my 10 year old when he was little and relished sharing it again with my 3-year-old.  The first book, Strega Nona, was the best of the series and when we saw this DVD adaptation, we were very excited to watch.  However, the story misses singing or even reading the ""pasta pot"" song.  This was the best part of our reading and my kids enjoyed singing it with me during story hour.  The video brings to life a wonderful story, but misses our favorite part of the book.  Great alternative to Dora, but will not replace story time.",1138147200,7,558,4.326923076923077
8021587,5,B00023TG64,My 3.5-year-old daughter loves this DVD.  It is well done and you really can't go wrong with such a great book to begin with.,1128643200,,125,4.208333333333333
8021588,5,B00023TG64,"Because my son (who is actually only 15 months old, much younger than the age recommendation) loves the Scholastic Where the Wild Things Are DVD, we decided to try another Scholastic Video.  We both couldn't be more pleased.  The story is simply animated and is accompanied by charming music. The narrator's voice is perfect and the adaptation of the story very close to the original.  Joseph Had a Little Overcoat is also well done, but Stone Soup, because of the sparse illustrations (just black line drawings with a little red) and lack of animation, is not quite as enjoyable.  I look forward to more DVDs from this collection.",1096329600,12,631,4.814814814814815
