7955590,5,B00005UW75,"Fantastic black and white spy drama with a man at the peak of his career,the great Mr. Patrick McGoohan.
Tight scripts,clever plotting and story lines,great location shooting (yes those are REAL people you see in the streets of London not like the deserted facades you saw in most American 60s dramas!)
And Patrick McGoohan as the ultra smooth,professional John Drake,what more could you want?
To go from something as classy as Dangerman and then go on to do The Prisoner means that miracles do occur!
Two standout episodes from this collection are ""Colony Three"" (possibly the blue print for The Village) and ""Its up to the Lady"" (was the conclusion of this mission for Drake the straw that broke the camels back and led him to resigning and therefore eventually becoming a number?)
Watch Dangerman as a prequel to The Prisoner and revel in a great spy drama with intelligence,flair and a fantastic narrative,truly a masterpiece from the 60s!
The only thing to avoid is the atrocious song by Johnny Rivers (this would make the jukebox from hell) instead treasure the great theme music which suits the show very well!
Its a pity that the producers of the over hyped,over produced,over acted bile that passes as tv entertainment these days don't actually do some homework and research some of these old classics.
The amazing shows from the 60s like Dangerman did not need computer graphics,shallow over dramatic acting,slow tedious mood music nor every other scene to be in slow motion to dramatize the so called effect.
No they just relied on a good script and yes good acting,simple isn't it!
Showtime,HBO and Lionsgate get As on their report cards,they produce classy intelligent television.
The rest of you are not worth the effort!",1287014400,,1735,4.945205479452055
7955591,5,B00005UW75,"Relive the early days of TV espionage!  Before he was ""The Prisoner,"" Patrick McGoohan was ""Secret Agent.""  (This was the American title -- it was originally called ""Danger Man"" in its native Britain.)  In locales ranging from London to Lagos (Nigeria), British agent John Drake (McGoohan) plies his trade amidst an array of surprisingly well-developed plots.  This particular set of 8 episodes, described elsewhere as being from season two, even includes one titled ""Colony Three,"" which almost surely served as the inspiration for the subsequent series McGoohan himself is credited with creating, ""The Prisoner.""  While each episode uses the original ""Danger Man"" theme music, a recording of the Johnny Rivers classic theme song of the American version, ""Secret Agent Man,"" is included in the bonus material.  In all, highly enjoyable, whether as drama, ""camp,"" or just an example of classic television.",1272758400,,905,5.382978723404255
7955592,5,B00005UW75,"One of the episodes in this Dangerman, Set 2, is ""the Colonel's Daughter."" Major Khan of the Delhi Police Department wants John Drake's help in locating a retired British Army colonel who has chosen to remain behind in India after its independence. ""Flotsam of the British Raj,"" Khan scoffs.
""You're not still chasing the poor old Imperialists, are you?"" Drake protests.
When Drake wants to know why he should find the British colonel, Khan sneers, ""Fellow white man, and all that.""
""The Colonel's Daughter"" is a story of two hardened intelligence officers doing their work in a changing geopolitical environment. Its hard-edged realism doesn't disappoint.
""Whatever happened to George Foster"" is arguably the best in the entire series.
In ""Colony Three,"" Drake has to penetrate a spy training school located in the mock-up of a British village in far-off Siberia. Patrick McGoohan's ability to assume the role of a file clerk is remarkable.
Five stars.",1250726400,,953,5.15483870967742
7955593,4,B00005UW75,"There are eight episodes on this DVD, of seeming various length. They're certainly entertaining, in black & white, which is part of the charm. McGoohan himself is very appealing and fun to watch. The sets are a bit cheesy, and recycled. The hotel in one episode, is, with minor alterations, the hospital in the next and the German apartment complex in the next. The plots don't really make much sense if you think about them for more than five seconds. The third world episodes all seem to be set in Banana Republic #43. But the visuals are fun, from footage, some stock, some not, of London and Paris, and make-up and fashion styles of the sixties, complete with the occasional semi-fashionable thug. And of course, there's the obligatory set of fisticuffs almost every episode. But the atmosphere is nicely paranoid, and, somehow, John Drake, the hero, emerges as slightly less adolescent than his main screen rival. There are some ""upsetting"" or ""ambiguous"" endings, though Drake seems more invigorated than drained by the paranoia. And there's funny dialogue like when an adorable Latin American Minister of Culture, a babe in uniform, says ""I have read all of your great writers, your Shakespeare, your Dickens, your Upton Sinclair."" I wouldn't exactly call this show intelligent, but it is very entertaining, and, by today's standards, remarkably wholesome. And, yes, the episode 'Colony Three' is certainly a precursor to the Prisoner. But Danger Man stands on its own merits.",1031011200,12,1483,5.057142857142857
7955594,3,B00005UW75,"Patrick McGoohan is back as British secret agent John Drake in further episodes of Danger Man.  Here are summaries and/or comments for the episodes in this set.  Episode ratings are on a scale from one to five (best).
Volume 3: (Disc 1)
The Professionals (3): An agent in Prague has suddenly vanished.  John Drake arrives in Prague, posing as a member of the embassy staff, his mission is to locate the missing man.  Very quickly he is taken in, and compromised by a crafty operative, and his lovely accomplice.  Drawn into their trap, Drake learns the fate of the missing man, and then takes steps to save him before it is too late.
A Date With Doris (2): Drake is in an unspecified Latin American location to extract an agent in jeopardy, and then rendezvous with the submarine ""Doris"".  His cover is as a reporter sent to interview a prominent General.  Things just do not go smoothly for Drake, and he always seems off balance.  He barely concludes this messy affair, and is only successful because of luck, and some very fortuitous assistance.  He is also guilty of a major error, when he foolishly allows himself to be followed to his ""safe house"".  Count yourself lucky this time, John.
The Mirror's New (3): This one keeps you guessing.  Edmund Bearce, a member of the British Embassy staff, chooses murder as a way to cancel a personal debt.  Preparing to dispose of the body, he has an accident, and is knocked unconscious.  Upon waking, he has a dead body on his hands, and a lost day to account for.  Bearce reappears, but can't explain what happened.  A suspicious Drake investigates and uncovers a secret life, and much more.
Colony Three (5): Easily the most thought provoking episode on the disc.  The plot is similar to an episode of ""The Prisoner"" or ""The Avengers"", skirting the edges of credibility.  Drake takes the place of a communist sympathizer, just prior to his defection to the Soviets.  After arriving in Soviet territory, Drake and two other defectors take a long train ride to a secret location.  They arrive at a place named ""Hamden"", also known as the ""village"" (sound familiar?).  The phony English town is actually a training ground where Soviet agents learn to assimilate into British culture.  Drake penetrates security, gathers as much information as he can, and then it is time to leave.  This one has a bit of everything, torture, gadgets, death and a tragic end.
Volume 4: (Disc 2)
It's Up To the Lady (2): Sometimes Drake is just not on his game, and this is one of those times.  A British diplomat intending to defect vanishes.  A rendezvous with his wife (Sylvia Syms), will take place in Greece, near the Albanian border.  Drake is on the scene, to try and get the wayward diplomat to return to Britain.  Underestimating the local opposition, he is nearly drowned, loses his charges, and carelessly gets himself shot.  Topping it all off, he learns once again what it is like to be a pawn in the game.
What Ever Happened to George Foster? (3): Bernard Lee (""M"" from the Bond films) guest stars, as Lord Ammandford, a wealthy industrialist who seeks to destabilize the government of a fictitious South American country.  In addition, the Lord is a man interested in keeping a mysterious past a secret from a probing John Drake.  This is more of a straight detective story.
The Galloping Major (2): Sent to Africa, at the request of the President (Henry Marshall) of an unnamed country, Drake finds himself the pawn in a political power struggle.  Makes interesting viewing in light of historical events, but not a great story.
The Colonel's Daughter (4): In India, classified information is being leaked to the enemy.  Drake is looking into the activities of a butterfly collecting Colonel, and his daughter, living in a house in the country.  Soon, Drake is up a tree, in the middle of the jungle, maintaining surveillance.  Later, he uncharacteristically emerges victorious in a three on one brawl, on his way to uncovering those involved in the secret pipeline.  Drake finds that the Colonel's daughter is definitely Daddy's girl.

Writing is critical to a good story, and some of the plots of these international exploits just do not quite pass muster.  Drake is simply not at his best, making some near fatal mistakes.  Perhaps being an operative largely on his own in a foreign land, puts Drake at too much of a disadvantage.  He doesn't quite have the fire we have seen before.  A few good episodes, but not enough for a ringing endorsement of this set.  Give A&E positive marks for addressing a previous complaint, by upgrading to four episodes per disc.  Fans of Danger Man, may find my other reviews of interest.",1017619200,11,4666,4.753731343283582
7955595,4,B00005UW75,"Watching these 35-year-old shows is a disturbing revelation at how television today has gotten even MORE dumbed-down than when it was referred to as the ""vast wasteland"". ALL of these shows have interesting characters, exotic locales (from Africa to Greece, South America to behind the Iron Curtain), and PLOT. Compared to ""Man From U.N.C.L.E"", this is Nobel Prize material! Each 50-minute show has more PLOT than most 2-hour movies foisted on us these days.
As noted above, probably of greatest interest to McGoohan fans will be the episode ""The Colony"", as the origins of ""The Village"" are plain for all to see. However, my favorite has to be ""What Happened to George Foster"", where McGoohan's Drake takes on a millionaire Lord (played by Bernard Lee, no less!) and risks his career, not to mention his life, in a private vendetta that foreshadows #6's battles with the assorted #2's of ""The Prisoner"".
This is certainly not light-hearted ""Avengers""-style material. McGoohan gets roughed up in just about every episode, and there aren't any charming eccentrics or snappy gadgets. But it is nearly incredible that such high quality LeCarre-like material was shown on a weekly basis. Truely, it was a Golden Age.",1017014400,23,1212,5.0954773869346734
7955596,4,B00005UW75,"Not as cerebral as ""The Prisoner"", nor nearly as simplistic as James Bond, Man from U.N.C.L.E., or any of the dozens of spy shows that were popular in the late sixties, ""Danger Man"" (Secret Agent in the U.S.) is a fine example of how British drama is often more subtle and ambiguous than anything you're likely to see on American TV.
Modern viewers may scratch their heads, wondering why this show was so wildly popular.  At its worst, the pacing is glacial, the narrative larded with long chunks of exposition.  At its best, this is chilling, thought provoking drama with plenty of gray areas, reminiscent of the Le Carre adaptions (Tinker, Tailor, etc.) that were produced in the 70s and 80s.  These shows are surprisingly cerebral for a TV series; while some episodes are too deliberately paced to work as thrillers, McGoohan is always worth watching, the black and white DVD transfers are gorgeous, and the endings are often startling.
If you're not a McGoohan fan, you'll probably find ""The Prisoner"" more accessible.  If you've already discovered ""The Prisoner"", and enjoy John Le Carre-style gritty, realistic espionage stories, give this box a try.  (The episodes in Volume 2 are generally more absorbing and darker than those included in the first DVD set.)",1015286400,11,1266,4.952830188679245
