7997419,5,B0000AINIT,"I first saw this video presented at the Roger Miller Museum in Erick Oklahoma.  It is so good it is presented at the museum and it is quite entertaining and informative.  I don't think I have seen a more thorough presentation on his life and it is presented with fairness that is just not seen that much any more.  While a little short in length, it is very well done and very much worth the purchase price.  It cost much less here than it does at the museum so that also says something. I am glad I waited until I got to Amazon to check the price, it saved me about $15.

7997421,5,B0000AINIT,"This documentary is great and offers insight into his music and Roger Miller the person.  Keeps your interest, moves quickly, but over way to soon. If you have an interest in Roger Miller's music, this DVD is highly recommended.",1187827200,9,228,4.846153846153846
7997422,5,B0000AINIT,"Roger was a musical genius.  The things he could do with his voice

is one thing, his real magic lay in his writing.  Thinking about the music that is being cranked out today, I don't think anyone today can match wits with Rogers writing ability.",1153440000,14,246,4.4222222222222225
