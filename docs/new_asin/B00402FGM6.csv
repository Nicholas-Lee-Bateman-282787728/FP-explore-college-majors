4237690,2,B00402FGM6,"I purchased this for children 3-5 years of age and it actually frightened them, It would perhaps suit an older group of children",1359504000,,128,4.608695652173913
4237691,3,B00402FGM6,"I bought this item used on Amazon.  It arrived in great condition.  The content is so-so.  The kids enjoy it, but not nearly as much as other titles.  There are a number of movies in this selection and they're all special in their own way, but the movies  themselves do not all contain the best acting.  I don't regret the purchase by any means, but watch how much you pay for it.",1353369600,8,380,4.208333333333333
4237692,3,B00402FGM6,"It's called ""kids movies"" but most were too scary for my six year old girl who usually loves Grimm's fairy tales. The packaging also isn't so great. It's kind of hard to figure out which movie you're putting each time because it's written so small. They could have made ten discs for ten movies instead of putting two movies on each disc (from both sides of the disc) which means you have to be extra careful not to scratch either side of the disc. For kids it's a little scary and for teenagers I guess it would be a little too boring and childish. Perhaps this is meant for grown ups who still love fairy tales or kids 10-12 years old.",1349740800,2,637,4.2727272727272725
4237693,4,B00402FGM6,"I bought this thinking it would be fun for my three year old grand-daughter. I have since decided most of these tales are a little scary for the younger kids.  I have, however, enjoyed these movies myself and think older children would enjoy them.  Christopher Walken is at his best in ""Puss in Boots"" and the acting in all the movies is first rate.",1328486400,5,349,4.4375
4237694,3,B00402FGM6,"I bought this collection because I have fond memories of watching these films as a child.  However, the packaging that MGM has provided is terrible.  The 10 movies in this collection are presented on five 2-sided discs.  The discs are packaged in a way so that they rub up against each other, and at least one (probably more) will end up with scratches on the playing surface.  I went through two of these sets to find five good discs, and the second one I bought was worse than the first (I ended up with three good discs and two that were only slightly scratched).  Since the individual releases of most of these movies are out of print, this is the only way you'll be able to buy them now (outside of Marketplace sellers), but MGM really missed the mark on the packaging.",1303430400,17,774,4.422535211267606

8411674,4,B00402FGM6,"Puss in Boots and Red Riding Hood are two of my favorites so I was sold on this little collection. Christopher Walken is so fun as Puss and the Wolf and songs in Little Red thoroughly addicting. Beauty and the Beast, Hansel and Gretel, and Emperor's New Groove are all secondary favorites. Some I remember from as a kid and others I saw for the first time older but despite (or because) of cheesiness and the classic feel they have I do love and recommend them. The docked star is only because the cover art is thoroughly unappealing and because I hate flipping reversible discs (hard to see at a glance which is what).",1433289600,,619,4.43859649122807
8411675,5,B00402FGM6,I watched all of these as a kid and I was so thrilled to find them in this multi-pack for my own kids!  They love it and I catch them singing the songs from these movies.  It was really fun to watch it with them and to see that they enjoy these movies as much as I did when I was little!,1413676800,,287,3.6129032258064515

8411677,4,B00402FGM6,I have all 8 of the 10 movies shown in the ten pack.  I wish that the frog prince would have been in the package.  I have it on VHS and only saw in on DVD in German. It is the one with Aileen Quinn as the princess who kisses the frog.,1398902400,,234,3.480769230769231
8411678,5,B00402FGM6,"I used to watch these movies on TV as a kid and always enjoyed them.  I like that you can buy a 10 pack of all of them like this and have to watch.  I'm a collector of movies and I like having these in my collection.  One of the things I like about them is the story lines, characters, plot etc.  They are beautifully told and acted out.",1394841600,,337,3.8405797101449277

8411681,5,B00402FGM6,"I LOVE all of these movies, but could only find some of them on DVD  (and expensive too!) I hit the jackpot by finding this.  I had no  problem with the packaging - all my DVDs appear to be working fine.  Their menus have a play, scene selection, and trailer option for each movie.  It shipped EXTREMELY FAST (and I used free shipping).  Just an absolute GREAT find.  So excited they decided to produce this collection.",1367107200,5,419,4.434210526315789
