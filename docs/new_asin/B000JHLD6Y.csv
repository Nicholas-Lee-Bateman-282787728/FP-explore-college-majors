8411424,2,B000JHLD6Y,there is one hard fast rule when it comes to martial arts and that is that you cannot remove portions of the art and claim it is still the same art anyone familiar with serak knows that the sambuts are a vital part of training yet this guy does not even mention them let alone show them instead of showing some ridiculous madeup sensitivity drill from wingchun the sambuts should have been taught along with the jurus . this guy has also ommited othr areas of traditional serak training .even his own teacher says this . he is not recognized as a teacher of serak by any legitimate organization. the methods demonstrated cannot be used against a fast randomly moving determined attacker .thy look good against the little girl he is pummeling on the dvd but i would love to see him try it on the street,1419552000,4,801,4.45578231292517
8411425,5,B000JHLD6Y,"I like Simonet's work.  This one is good if you are interested in the meaning behind the FORMS in the style, which are harder to learn on a DVD but it can be done.  If you are a student of Silat I'd recommend this.  If you like different Martial Arts and are interested in their movements and background then this will be good.  If you want slam bang stuff the first disc will not be interesting.  I also have a problem getting it to play in my PS3.  I get that more frequently with these kinds of DVDs.",1418515200,,503,4.081632653061225
8411426,2,B000JHLD6Y,"Bought this along with a number of other Silat DVDs to build up my library. Compared to a true master like Bob Orlando, this video is a joke. The man's sheer size is more impressive than his use of this art. Perhaps he should have picked a training partner comparable in size, instead he demonstrates his moves on a petite woman who acts more like a training dummy than a drill partner. Coupled with his severe lack of intelligent terminology (he uses phrases like 'downward motion' and such, more than anything else) or discussion of underlying principles makes this a complete waste of time. I'm sure he would win in a fight against many opponents, simply because complete dedication to one thing often trumps lightly applied talent or intelligence.",1371686400,2,751,4.829457364341085
8411427,5,B000JHLD6Y,"Having studied Pentjak Silat before, I was very happy to find a DVD to have around for training. I think the video is well made and Guru Simonet is very good at explaining the specifics of the forms. Very good video.",1279584000,3,216,4.2926829268292686
