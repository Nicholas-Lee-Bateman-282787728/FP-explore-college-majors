8267182,5,B00177Y9XY,"SOJA is a great homegrown reggae rock band whose music/lyrics are both inspiring & uplifting! This live DVD is of superior
quality especially if your DVD player has DTS - digital surround sound! I can't get enough of this band! If you know SOJA's
music or if you are just discovering this excellent band....You gotta check this out!",1376697600,4,332,4.741379310344827
8267183,5,B00177Y9XY,"I first saw SOJA in concert in 2006, at Reggae on the River. They are one of the truly outstanding US-based reggae acts (they're from the DC area) that have started to make a tremendous impact throughout the reggae world (Rebelution and Groundation are another pair of similar acts). This dvd has outstanding audio and video quality, and some of my favorite SOJA songs are well represented here. Truly a must buy for any hardcore reggae fan who appreciates uplifting lyrics, fantastic ""riddims"" and perfectly blended instrumentals. Buy this one, you won't be disappointed.",1257724800,6,572,5.095744680851064
