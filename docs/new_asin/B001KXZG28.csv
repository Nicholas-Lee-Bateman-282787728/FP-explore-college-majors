8316527,4,B001KXZG28,"Ok first off, this movie is neither a direct sequel to the anime or the manga. So if you're buying this movie expecting such you will be sorely mistaken. This movie is a direct sequal to the nadesiko video game, the blank of three years, which unfortunately was never released in the u.s. but there are sites where you can read the overall plot of the game, which helps to fill in the blanks. Now assuming you know the back story this was actually a pretty good movie. It was great seeing the returning characters and the comedy was still spot on, that said i still had a few problems. Like why'd the rest of the original crew quit and what happened to the original nadesiko (only the nadesiko b&c are shown in the movie) also it was kinda a shame about what happened to akito and rurika. (read the plot of the blank of three years) the original series was great and didn't really need to continue but this was a solid movie and a great continuation of the story if not a necessary one",1467158400,,985,4.301075268817204
8316528,1,B001KXZG28,"This thing quite honestly jumps the train track right out of the gate and derails into a fiasco. You have no real take off from the series, but rather are thrown in to a complicated subplot that is hard to figure out, but requires a sort of getting the band back together spiel that never quite works out. In plain language this thing was just plain yucky with a terrible ending to top it off. A real dud. Although Martian Successor Nadesico was serious enough when it mattered the endearing part of the series to me was the lighthearted interaction between Akito and Yurika, and this abomination totally ruined that, as well as turning the whole story somber serious and complicated. I really could tell you the whole story right now and not spoil anything, because you really can not spoil a piece of garbage like this atrocity. I would have been much better off never seeing this terrible thing and defiantly better off not buying it. And whoever you are and where ever you may be in your life you would be so much better off if you never even new this thing existed at all. If you did not like Nadesico and you in fact hated it so much that you really would enjoy seeing the whole show and character concept completely ruined, then perhaps you may want to give it a try, but I warn you even if that is how you feel, if you go through with watching this thing I guarantee you will regret it.",1410134400,,1394,4.365384615384615
8316529,5,B001KXZG28,"I know alot of people hav critisized this movie saying it is much darker than the anime and has hardly any humor, well there is a reason for that.....  The Prince of darkness finishes up the manga not the anime.  The manga was a much darker and different expirence than the anime ad the movie continues that so give it a chance it really is good when you think about it.",1352419200,,370,4.197183098591549
8316530,4,B001KXZG28,"Is a good movie, a couple of jokes, good history and script, but loses essence of the series. Nadesico is genial because a lot of joke, fun and relaxation who's pass for the spectator, in same time his show a good history. The movie, however, is much dramatic and sad, definitely, this is not the face of Martian Successor Nadesico",1292025600,,331,4.533333333333333
8316531,5,B001KXZG28,"So sad... Not pathetic sad, but like crying your eyes out sad. Like OMG so sad!
Martian Successor Nadesico was a marvel in Japan and its humor and spoof was both unique and very tasteful (at least to me it was). The ending of Nadesico also was unique and tasteful, since it hinted of a sequel and ""didn't"". But this movie, sad as it is, ISN'T Nadesico!

Taking two years after the end, Ruri is the established hero and has matured greatly and has a new crew and seems dense as ever. Bosen jumping is still the ""hot-button"" in the universe, and while the war between the earth and the Jovians are over, everyone wants just a little more control than the other.

One thing that made me happy was the appearance of the movie. The characters are in spirits just the way they should be! However those who wish to try this movie, be warned, you will initially feel like you are missing something!!

Most wonder where are Akito and Yurika, and who wouldn't? Both of them were awesome leads offering humor and awe, rather cheesily. But alas Akito is not the same, as he is battle-hardened ruthless, less chatty, but still the same hero. Yurika, on the other hand, has screen time, but doesn't voice nearly as much as she did in the series... Most find that without this two characters, Nadesico is lost. I'm sure that is how everyone feels but the message is still the same as the series was, and that is: no matter how much people change, who they are can never be forgotton or let go by people who love and want them.

Honestly I HATED the beginning, but LOVED the ending!
SPOILERS: Everyone skip until you see when. Akito lost his senses of a cook in order to be strong enough to save Yurika, this made me almost cry because it proved how much he loved Yurika. Akito's Aestivalis appears black and souless, but the ending made me happy, he shed his armor revealing his classic purple model from the series! Showing that the old Akito exists! His mech ""crys"" to show how he's missed the real Akito. What happened next was... un-necessary, but nevertheless good.
WHEN

OVERALL: Prince of Darkness is a not-so-direct sequel to the series, people will find the humor here unique and quirky as ever, but in different manners than before. I felt TOed at first, but PoD is a great movie and has some of the greatest plot twists ever seen in anime!",1231804800,,2335,4.471830985915493
