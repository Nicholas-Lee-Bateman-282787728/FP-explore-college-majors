8326004,5,B00114XTI4,"This pack contains one DVD that has been previously released and another that is only available in this pack or on Andre's website.
The first is 'Christmas with Andre Rieu'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Andre-Rieu-Christmas-with-Andre-Rieu/dp/B0002OOV4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Andre Rieu: Christmas with Andre Rieu</a>. We bought this title from Amazon as we were at that time unable to buy it in Australia. Andre's selection is traditional European with a few favourites thrown in. However, what attracted us to this DVD was the setting - a barn. This is quite unusual and certainly different so we bought it to see and found it great. (As an aside, living in Melbourne, where we suffer bushfires only an hour away I do find the open flame of a candle amongst straw quite disturbing. Given that the barn is surrounded by snow thoughts of that would never occur to most people.)
The second and main reason we bought this is the second DVD 'New Year's Punch' concert. We had been holding off buying this concert as the exchange rate at that time was not in our favour in Europe. We're glad we did. We knew we had the first DVD but decided that at  Aus$ 30.00 this was value for money for just one DVD. The New Year's Eve concert was recorded at Hannover in 2003. It includes 'Bond' and Russell Watson. The DVD of this concert is longer, according to the tracklisting, than that of Andre's website with equal parts of concert and encore and provided lots of laughs.
Even if you have 'Christmas with Andre' this package is well worth the value to get 'New Year's Punch' with the extra tracklistings. Have fun!",1261699200,5,1655,5.0181818181818185
