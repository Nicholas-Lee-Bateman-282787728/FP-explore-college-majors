It's mostly just interesting in that it's a movie determined to avoid it's central puzzle and also is attempting to be mainstream with a decided not mainstream director. It leads to a strange movie that feels something like a Hallmark TV movie but also feels like a serious movie made by serious people.

The plot is that a group of cops have to escort a child rapist and murderer to trial. He has had a million plus dollar bounty put on his head causing anyone and everyone to try to kill him. The guy is guilty. The guy did even more than most people know. So, the cops have to decide as things go on if the chaos is worth it or not. Basically, by doing what's good by following the law are they making themselves morally guilty for all the carnage that's taking place. A lot of carnage takes place in this movie too. So the tension increases quickly. It seems like the thing notable skilled creep Takashi Miike seems most interested in. How much can he ratchet up the hurt on his characters and the audience still be on board. He's in a difficult situation though cause he can't use all the shock tactics he's known for. So, he has to rely on psychological pokes. He's not bad at it either but you can see him tugging on the leash so to speak. He wants to really go for it but can't.

The problem is that the movie wants to be a crowd favorite. You can't really make a movie about moral culpability a fan favorite like Star Wars if you're being honest. So, moments of anime or 70s cop movie flair come off as ridiculous and they are shockingly frequent . That the movie sometimes moves into a Michael Mann vibe makes it more difficult as those sequences work. A good example involving an older cop in a hostage stand off that is extremely tense with characters making many in character decisions that make it all the more difficult. The banal evil of greedy and evil characters is placed in stark relief in this sequence and a few others. It also leads to moments of twisted virtue that are equally unnerving. It makes the questionable ending all the more difficult. If you're not ready for a difficult answer, you should probably avoid difficult questions. The movie is determined to give an ending it has no business delivering.

In the end I would never say not watch the movie as it's interesting. It's not good but there's a good movie buried in there.",1512518400,,2406,4.414414414414415

8626838,5,B00GSQ5ATG,"I will admit it: I am a great Takashi Miike fan. He is one of the most interesting directors today, definitely the most versatile. Even when making a conventional genre movie, he produces a film which will stand out from the rest.

This movie, Shield of Straw, is a good example. At first glance, it is your typical chase movie. It is the story of the transport of a sociopathic killer who the rich relation of one of his victims has offered a billion yen reward for anyone who kills him legally. That means the sociopaths killer must be either the State or the States representative; in other words, the police officers charged with transporting him to the authorities. The price on the sociopaths head is so big a price that everyones loyalty and duty is challenged.

But typical usually is not in Miikes lexicon. This movie is in a way Miike's variation of the essential plot to ""3:10 to Yuma."" Sure, there multi-vehicle chase scenes, explosions, and shooting. The first part of the movie has a magnificient mult--car pile-up. This is not a typical chase because the movie is supported by an excellent script (not a cookie-cutter plot), real dialogue (not corny cliches),fully developed characters (not one-dimensional caricatures found in too many movies), and real drama.

This movie is more assessable than your average Miike film. He is famous for employing non-linear, hyperlink, story-telling, forcing the viewer to pay attention and watch the film. The story-telling here is simply and directly told in a totally linear fashion.

At least currently the movie is not available in NTSC format, so in order to vew this movie a region-free DVD player must be purchased. This movie is a good excuse to buy one.",1417564800,,1715,4.863013698630137
