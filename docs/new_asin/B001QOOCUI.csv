8336139,4,B001QOOCUI,This video is choppy but the instructions are good.  She goes through a lot of moves quickly.  She incorporates basic belly dance moves with the use of finger cymbals and veil.  It is comprehensive for 50 minutes and you even get to do a little dance at the end.  I would have preferred more time spent on each move especially since you are using finger cymbal but I really like that she uses zills and veils together in this DVD.,1310256000,2,430,4.3375
