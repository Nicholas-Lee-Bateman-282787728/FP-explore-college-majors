It's fairy tales with a twist--they take standard fairy tales that have run a stray.  In comes the FTPD to the rescue to make the fairy tale turn out right.  I have three children, ages 10,7,& 4, and they all love them.  In fact, I loaned them to my daughter's 2nd grade class; you could have heard a pin drop, they were so mesmerized by them.  FTPD is an excellent find and I strongly recommend them. Good clean family viewing!!!",1275609600,,577,4.598039215686274
