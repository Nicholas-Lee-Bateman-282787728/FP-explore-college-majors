It's entertaining.",1034035200,7,144,4.958333333333333
408129,5,6301980476,"Producer Jack Cummings gives us a nostalgic look at early America with its traditional mannerisms and unique dress in this turn of the century musical.  While vacationing in a Catskills resort, Patti (Jane Powell) and her younger sister, Melba, (Debbie Reynolds) are determined to turn their two-week family get-a-way into two weeks with love.  Patti sets her eye on a dashing older guest, Ricardo Montalban, while Melba stalks the hotel ownner's son, Carleton Carpenter.  Patti believes that if she were only permitted to wear a corset, like the other young women, that her romantic woes would be over.  She is reminded by Mama and Papa (delightfully played by Ann Harding and Louis Calhern) that she is only eighteen and that the answer is no.  Phyllis Kirk, a fellow vacationer, doesn't help any by spreading word that Patti doesn't wear a corset.  She, also, has her sights set on Mr. Montalban. Needless to say, misadventure and comedy abound.  Busby Berkeley, renowned for his spectacular choreography and 'people moving', staged all the numbers for this bright period musical set in the early 1900's.
The musical sequences are dazzling.  They begin with a lilting waltz, the movie's untitled theme, which I call the LOVE WALTZ, conducted by Louis Calhern for his Sunday concert in the park.  Jane Powell adds her talent to the concert with a vibrant A HEART THAT'S FREE.  At the resort, Debbie Raynolds and Carleton Carpenter entertain the guests with a lively THAT'S HOW I NEED YOU.  Jane follows with a robust OCEANA ROLL. Debbie and Carleton next give us the rousing ABA DABA HONEYMOON which gave them a smash-hit record.  While rowing on the lake, Mama and Papa, Ricardo and Phyllis, and Jane (alone in her own little boat) sing the romantic BY THE LIGHT OF THE SILVERY MOON.  Jane ends up IN the lake.  At a resort dance, we hear a beautiful refrain of the LOVE WALTZ.  Jane then gets her wish for a corset in an elaborate dream sequence in which she appears in the hotel courtyard with all guests assembled in their finest attire.  Jane enters wearing a dazzling corset and a wide brimmed hat accessorized by a shade umbrella over her shoulder.  All eyes are on Jane and her beautiful corset, not to mention her beautiful legs, as the crowd sings BEAUTIFUL LADY.  She rewards their admiration with the revered Oscar Straus favorite MY HERO as her own hero, Ricardo, waltzes her around the garden.  The dream ending and the film drawing to a close, Debbie and Carleton encore with ROW, ROW, ROW in a resort entertainment and Jane and Ricardo follow with a lively Latin dance, FLAMENCO. The music and movie conclude with the haunting LOVE WALTZ.
Of all of her movies, this is Jane Powell's favorite. It's one of my favorites, also. The entire cast seems to be having a rousing, good time.  I think you will, too.",976492800,73,2823,4.781443298969072
408130,5,6301980476,"This movie is charming from beginning to end. It has wonderful songs like ""Oceannia Roll"" and ""Abba Dabba Honeymoon."" Young Jane Powell and an even younger Debbie Reynolds perform magnificently. Ricardo Montalban is on hand to add class to the proceedings. This is an old-fashioned musical that classic film lovers will eat up!",972777600,12,327,5.188679245283019
408131,4,6301980476,"From 1950, this has marvelous musical numbers staged by Busby Berkeley and incredible talent performing them.
Jane Powell and Debbie Reynolds are two diminutive dynamos that play sisters vacationing in the Catskills. Great also are Louis Calhern as their father and Carleton Carpenter as a gangling young man in the mood for ""spooning"". The real star here though is Ricardo Montalban. What a gorgeous, graceful man. To watch him dance with Jane Powell is a joy, and YOWZA ! he looks good in those white tights...how many men could carry off an outfit like that ?!.
Sweet and funny ( the ""grand and glorious 3rd"" scene is hilarious !), this movie is enchanting, wonderful for the whole family, and one to enjoy repeatedly.",970704000,7,721,4.869918699186992
408132,5,6301980476,"My children and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! Jane Powell is wonderful as a teenager trying to convince her parents that she is not a child, but an adult. In her attempts to do so, she ends up in some hilarious  situations. My girls and I laughed until we had tears in our eyes! Debbie  Reynolds is wonderful as usual, playing the part of Melba, Jane Powell's  younger sister. This is such a sweet movie, I highly recommend it. They  just don't make many movies like this anymore!",939600000,4,483,4.454545454545454
408133,4,6301980476,"If you're in the mood for a delightful musical comedy, then this is the show to see.  Debbie Reynolds is the cutest she has ever been.  Jane Powell as always wows the viewer with her beautiful soprano voice.  The music is  wonderful and the comedic timing is absolutely great.  This video is a  favorite in my family's collection.",915062400,2,330,4.603448275862069
408277,5,6301980476,Wonderful music and cast with a classic and sweet storyline.  Our family has loved this one for as long as I can remember.,1319328000,,122,4.304347826086956
408278,4,6301980476,"Considered by Jane Powell to be the personal favourite of all her films, 1950's TWO WEEKS WITH LOVE is an utterly charming and delightful musical.  Set in a turn-of-the-century America, it was the kind of movie which producer Jack Cummings did best, and also appealed to the tastes of MGM's Louis B. Mayer, who was known for his sentimental streak.

Summer vacation has rolled around for the Robinson clan, and that only ever means one thing - two weeks at a cozy boardinghouse in the Catskills.  But this year, eldest daughter Patti (Jane Powell) is less than enthused about their holiday.  It's all about priorities, you see.  She's almost eighteen, but *gasp* has yet to receive her first ""La belle mode"" corset.  Simply every young lady must be properly-dressed just in case that perfect man should come along.  He does, in the form of exotic touring actor Demi Armendez (Ricardo Montalban), but Patti doesn't think she has a chance when her competition involves glamorous stage beauty Valerie Stressemann (Phyllis Kirk of ""House of Wax"" fame).  Eventually it all becomes too much and Patti's vivid imagination runs wild in a dream where she gets both the guy *and* the corset, but will the real story end just as happily?

Co-starring Debbie Reynolds in one of her first big supporting roles as Powell's spunky younger sister, TWO WEEKS WITH LOVE is a great big musical bonbon - sugary sweet with very little substance underneath - but that's the only thing you want in a film like this.  Just immerse yourself in the frilly period costumes and the nostalgic musical numbers (this movie is where Reynolds launched herself into her ""Aba-Daba-Honeymoon"" with Carleton Carpenter).  Ricardo Montalban is perfection as Powell's love interest; Ann Harding (who came out of retirement especially for this film) and Louis Calhern are the parents.  Calhern later played Powell's grandfather in ""Nancy Goes to Rio"" and ""Athena"".",1309996800,,1923,5.012578616352202
408279,5,6301980476,"Set in the Victorian Era, Two Weeks With Love is a sentimental tribute to the frivolity of youth and years gone by. (Think Meet Me in St. Louis.) Its historical setting lends itself well to the theme, and the beauty of the decor is splendid in Technicolor.

The Robinson family sets off to go on their yearly two week vacation to the country. This year is different though, because daughter Patti (Jane Powell) has grown up. Rather than fall for boys her age, she sets her sights on a new, older Spanish visitor (Ricardo Montalban). She does her best to act like a mature older woman, but with mother's strict rules against modern bathing suits and corsets for 17 year old girls, she isn't making much progress.

This coming of age story's plot is very similar to that of Dirty Dancing, but much more innocent. It has a great cast, great music, and a story that's easy to relate to.",1304899200,,882,4.50625
408280,5,6301980476,"Great musical if you like older movies.  Debbie Reynolds is great.  She and Carlton Carpenter in ""Abba Dabba Dabba"" are worth watching the whole movie for.  Not a plausible story but great escapist musical.",1291161600,,206,5.0
408281,5,6301980476,"This sunny, scintillating music-filled delight from 1950 has been rightfully viewed as a prototype for ""Dirty Dancing"", but taking place at the same resort, depicting a more innocent time, at the turn of the 20th century. I first recall seeing it at a time when I was facing similar issues as its young heroine-particularly a rivalry that I hadn't realized existed.
  Bandleader, Horatio Robinson(Louis Calhern) presides over his last concert at a bandstand in a park before he and his family leave for a two-week vacation in the Catskills.
 The crowd is treated to the sweet, tart soprano of Mr. Robinson's oldest daughter, Patti(a lovely Jane Powell)as she sings, ""A Heart That's Free"".
 A short distance away, Mrs. Katherine Robinson (Ann Harding) waits impatiently for her husband to finish playing ""The Light Cavalry Overture"" while making final preparations for their getaway with their children, who also include their pert, lively, and straightforward second daughter, Melba(Debbie Reynolds), and sons McCormick(Gary Gray) and Ricky(Tommy Rettig).
 Before their departure, we view the beginning of the mother-daughter conflict that  will escalate as the story progresses when 17-year-old Patti, who is reluctant to go on the trip, protests that she is mature enough to wear longer skirts and figure flattering attire, and her mother disputes her claim, wanting to keep her daughter a child forever--or at least for another year.
 Upon their arrival, the Robinsons are enthusiastically greeted by young Billy Findlay (Carleton Carpenter), whose father (Clinton Sundberg) owns the resort at which the family will stay. Billy has an eye for Patti, but Melba has an eye for him.
 The actress Valerie Streseman(Phyllis Kirk), who had been amiable towards Patti on previous occassions, realizes that Patti has blossomed, and unbeknownst to Patti, now views her as a rival. The two chat briefly in the Robinson's designated quarters, amid the apprehension of Melba, who sees Valerie for the vixen that she is. Once Melba leaves, Valerie shows off her new La Belle Mode Corset. But both are distracted when the honking of the horn of a motor car signals the arrival of a handsome Cuban visitor, Demi Aremendez( Ricardo Montalban) and his mother( Melba Meredith). Realizing a potential prize she must try to wrestle from Patti, Valerie hurriedly leaves.
 In the dining area, all eyes (except those of Mr. Robinson) are drawn to the Armendezes when they enter. Desi and Patti eye one another from a distance, and a flushed and nervous Patti takes out her fan. Excusing herself from the table, she accidentally spills tapioca pudding on Demi as a smug Valerie discreetly gloats.
 Regretting her continuing relagation to the juvenile section for entertainment, Patti makes the most of her situation. After Melba and company perform, ""That's How I Need You "", the room livens with Patti's rendering of the ragtime song, ""Oceana Roll"".
 Sometime later, Patti and Demi have their first chance to talk. But an intended trip for ice cream is thwarted when Mr. Robinson calls Patti in for the night, and Valerie commandeers the outing.
 In the days that follow, Patti suffers the jeers of peer group members because she still has a child's bathing suit when all her contemperaries have graduated to more mature attire. The worst of her tormentors is Eddie Gavin(Charles Smith). Mr. Robinson initially empathizes with his daughter when she laments her plight, but then concedes to his wife's judgement when she explains her take on the matter.
 Another round is lost for Patti.
 But through evenings of songs under the stars, such as the version of ""Aba Daba Honeymoon"" that Debbie Reynolds and Carleton Carpenter made famous, and ""By the Light of the Silvery Moon"", featuring one of two of Patti's fantasy sequences involving Demi, amid the support of young Billy, whose own father is reluctant to let him wear long pants, a climactic and humiliating setback for Patti, a prematurely offset 4th of July fireworks display, of a father's overhearing a conversation that encourages him to act(albeit haphazardly) on his devastated daughter's behalf, and a chance to perform one delectable tango during a talent show at the end of the fortnight's vacation, as well as a sisterly act of petty larceny, the tide turns in Patti's favor.
  This wonderfully technicolored film is the definition of frothy, wholesome, and lighthearted MGM musicals. It is still wonderful to watch six decades after its release.",1280966400,,4490,5.155433287482806

I have long checked to see if this has come out on DVD, and to my surprise it is STILL only VHS.  Tapes are being worn out here!

408285,4,6301980476,"I'm not a huge Jane Powell fan, but she looks great in this movie and I do enjoy her singing in this one. However, America's Sweetheart Miss Debbie Reynolds steals every scene she's in. I've always felt Debbie is somewhat underrated as actresses go, but she
shines in this film. Romantic and comical without being silly, this
is fine family entertainment. This is the ""next generation"" at MGM

7819510,5,6301980476,It's an older comedy musical made in 1950 when comedies of this kind were popular.  It has some laugh out loud scenes and a nice music score.  Some of the songs will be familiar to the audience.  It's more of a family movie than just a romance as the entire family of the heroine have their own scenes and involvement.  My daughters enjoyed it when they were teenagers a decade ago.  I'm always partial to movies/musicals of this era so I really like it!,1517788800,,454,4.357142857142857

7819516,5,6301980476,"Two Weeks with Love is an excellent and classic movie musical from MGM. The plot moves along very well and the cinematography and choreography are exceptionally well done and quite impressive. The casting reflects careful forethought and this led to very convincing acting, too! The musical numbers are excellent; I especially liked ""Aba Daba Honeymoon"" performed by Debbie Reynolds and Carleton Carpenter! The rest of the musical score enhances the film as well.

When the action starts the Robinson family takes a two week vacation to a resort in the Catskill Mountains in New York. Horatio Robinson (Louis Calhern) and his wife Katherine (Ann Harding) are looking forward to their vacation while seventeen year old Patti (Jane Powell) is more focused on how she may attract young men on vacation. When the family gets to the resort it isn't long before Patti, her catty and conniving ""friend"" Valerie (Phyllis Kirk) and other young women are absolutely swept off their feet by the very handsome Demi Armendez (Ricardo Montalban) who is also staying at the resort with his mother (Melba Meredith).

The arrival of Demi Armendez sets up quite a competition between Valerie and Patti for the affections of the somewhat older Demi; but Patti never gets a real chance to impress Demi because Valerie is always beating Patti to it--not to mention that Patti's parents think she is a year or two too young to be going around with boys her age, let alone men! Worse yet for Patti, her parents steadfastly refuse to let her wear a woman's corset to shape her figure; this causes Patti great embarrassment when others her age find out! Patti doesn't want Demi to discover she isn't wearing any corset for fear that she'll really turn him off and far prefer Valerie to her.

Of course there's more to the plot but I won't give away spoilers so you can enjoy this film as much as I did! Suffice it to say that the rest of the film shows how all the issues play out and I think you will be as entertained as I was--this is a fantastic motion picture.

Look also for Clinton Sundberg as Mr. Finlay, the owner of the resort; Carleton Carpenter as his son Billy Finlay; Debbie Reynolds as Patti's younger sister Melba; Gary Gray and Tommy Rettig as Patti's younger brothers McCormick and Ricky Robinson; Charles Smith as Eddie Gavin and Edward Clark has a brief cameo as a druggist.

I highly recommend Two Weeks with Love for any fan of the actors in it; and anyone who appreciates five star, high quality control classic movie musicals will be enchanted by this one! People who enjoy a musical with elements of romantic comedy will not be disappointed either.",1363910400,,2648,4.747826086956522
7819517,5,6301980476,Two Weeks With Love is one of my favorite Jane Powell movies. It is surpassed only by Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. I have very fond memories of watching this as a child with my grandma. Every member of the cast does an excellent job!,1359504000,,237,4.288888888888889
