8478264,5,B005LKH7OG,Another brilliant show with an All-Star cast. Peter Capaldi was a fantastic job yet again,1522713600,,89,5.0
8478265,5,B005LKH7OG,"This is one of the FUNNIEST series I have ever seen - tears in your eyes funny.  The writing and acting are so sharp!  I was happy (and enjoyed) the American version too, but this one is SHARP!  If you study or enjoy witty comedy, great dialogue, subtle humor, this is for you.  I tend to watch it every six months or so and still find brilliant 'bits' I haven't noticed on prior viewings.",1507420800,,389,4.216216216216216
8478266,5,B005LKH7OG,Excellent example of Brit humor(humour). Love the American copy too.,1456617600,,68,5.9
8478267,5,B005LKH7OG,"OMGodness!!!!! Yay, America..  For once u have gotten ur silicone enhanced hands on a Foreign series and didn't submit it to plastic surgery, insipid situations, breast augmentation, hair extensions.... The 3 main chickadees in US version of GOn don't even have mascara on!!'
Hellooo!! There's FAT people in it ! I know ! Real, flawed, funny, pathetic, desperate, aging, characters sqeeeezed into it/ portrayed by genuine, excellent actors who help make u FEEL for these characters .... In spite of the fact that they are, pale, overworked, flat chested, bald, old really old in diapers, funny, sarcastic, genuine, lonesome, and didn't starve, workout w a trainer, have perfect  professional makeup and their situations r not glamorized ..... Yes!!!! Watch the 1st 2 seasons before the 3 starts on nov 8 people!!! Unless u r sensitive to authentic portrayals and like life ""pretty"" .... Then stay with NCI crap, anorexic chics lost on islands, 2 waitresses ,poor, w a horse in ny( and someone zip her diner uniform up , really, what is that??) geniuses w super powers/ blah-blah-blah, go for it . .... Happy trails...",1446768000,3,1117,5.032432432432432
8478268,5,B005LKH7OG,"This is probably the best illustration of the perils of obama-care that every American should be concerned with. Having worked in health care I can tell you that what you experience through the cast of Getting on is simple reality of the types of absurdly, yet hilarious, behaviors in the medical arena. But that's not all. This isn't limited to the medical profession. If you took the premise and behaviours that you witness in ""Getting On"" and simply changed the profession-to many other organizations such as the military (and yes I am a combat veteran who retired with 33 years) you'd have another award winning show. Think of ""Getting On"" as simply the civilian version of ""Mash"". FYI, the British version trumps the American imitation. Sadly it seems that when it comes to copying humour and mysteries from the Brits-something gets lost in the translation....",1435708800,,865,4.972413793103448
8478269,5,B005LKH7OG,Hilarious. 'Nuff said.,1424649600,,22,6.666666666666667
8478270,5,B005LKH7OG,This is a great series.  I watched the first two seasons of the American version so didn't expect to like the British series as much.  It would be hard to say which was the best.  They are both great.,1424044800,2,200,4.076923076923077
8478271,5,B005LKH7OG,This will make you laugh and appreciate nursing homes.,1416873600,2,54,5.111111111111111
8478272,3,B005LKH7OG,"However, i thought the UK version would be more interesting (and funnier) than the American version.
SO although we did laugh once (which is more than we did in 3 episodes of the US series), it is almost verbatim the same script.
So we gave up on watching both US and UK versions.",1389744000,6,280,4.30188679245283
8478273,4,B005LKH7OG,"Great cast, concept, writing, acting (I really need a f.....ing cigarette; 'you fat nance'). Just enough humour mixed with 'a day in the life of' to satisfy. Always enjoyed Jo Brand's humour so knew I couldn't lose with this one. Hope there's more to come from these women.",1326844800,,273,4.708333333333333
