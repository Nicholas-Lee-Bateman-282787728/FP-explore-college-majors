1651225,2,B00005QTAU,Video was OK.  Audio was choppy and intermittent.  Hope all old Pacino movie films have better audio,1509926400,,100,4.823529411764706

1651231,5,B00005QTAU,"I watched this movie again, maybe for the 4th time, and it's amazing! Loaded with emotions, great acting, it simply brings joy in my heart and...tears at the same time. It is an emotional rollercoaster. Al Pacino plays to win, each and every bit of the movie. Getting to see him making love is probably the big bonus. Michelle's beautiful and oh-so- adorable, feminine face says it all. A very lovely love story. I will watch it again and again.",1499644800,,445,4.575

1651264,5,B00005QTAU,"This is a wonderful romantic film. It's the first time I've seen Al Pacino in such a subdued and romantic role. (Subdued for him, anyhow. He's still a powerhouse here.) He's incredible in this. His Johnny is so sweet and understanding and loving. And funny! Michelle Pfeiffer is great here too. Al and Michelle's chemistry is top notch. Nathan Lane is great at Frankie's best friend forever. I highly recommend this one!",1489363200,,420,4.847222222222222

1651269,2,B00005QTAU,"I had to suffer through this one.  The waitress had the most disagreeable demeanor.  The cook was charming but had a problem with insisting that she love him.  Since she admitted she delighted in the death of her Parakeet, it showed her as a shallow person.  I kept waiting for something of substance in this film and did not find it.  Another supposed happy ending, but with her surly, unkempt, annoying manner, I could not rejoice in the ending.  Frankly, I wanted the cook to run the other way.",1487721600,,497,4.52808988764045

1651309,5,B00005QTAU,"Johnny (Al Pacino) is just released from prison. Frankie ( Michelle Pfeiffer) is an emotional captive of her own guardhouse. The guy is totally smitten and definitely won't take no for an answer. He's a bit brutish, but quite literate-- loves to share his wisdom-- and instinctual enough to be mindful of her fear and avoidance, without yet knowing the why of her hesitance. He navigates her lack of confidence, not in an exploitive way, but with the energy of full appreciation and attraction and an ability to challenge her misguided lack of self-esteem. Frankie is a winning character. She has a great capacity for delivering and receiving smart humor; she's savvy, despite her limited education, and can handle any quick repartee. She's kind and caring, expressive with her caring except towards him. Both are exceedingly lonely. Early on, Johnny pays a prostitute to stay dressed and just hold him.  The connection, chemistry, and sexual tension are beautifully paced. So don't leave the building. There may be some major electricity on its way. The acting is top notch by all, and the writing, directing, all filmmaking disciplines are solid. I saw it first many years ago and just now, and find it still great. Highly recommend.",1486598400,,1235,4.995145631067961
1651310,5,B00005QTAU,"This is a beautiful love story. It is intensely dramatic one moment funny the next. This is one of Gerry Marshall's best films. At the center of the movie is a poignant and inspiring tale about second chances and the power of love. Al Pacino and Michele Pfeiffer both give compelling and tender performances. The two actors have great chemistry. It's a must see for fans of romantic flicks.

1651311,5,B00005QTAU,"One of the all-time best romantic comedies.  And, generally, I dislike that genre.  The Italians and French can do small movies, especially romantic comedies, that seem significant.  The cast sparkles.  Pacino at his best and Michelle Pfeiffer has always been a favorite of mine.  Well written, believable, heart warming and funny.  Has it all.  Don't miss it if you like Pacino, Pfeiffer or romantic comedies.",1486425600,,410,5.2153846153846155

1651334,5,B00005QTAU,"This is probably my 2nd favorite movie of all time. I have always loved the tight writing and characters who come to terms with their own loneliness and lack of love. Johnny is pushing too hard for a chance with Frankie, damaged and afraid to begin with. Wonderfully played by Pacino and Pfeiffer and supporting cast, full of sensitive lines that reveal their souls and dreams.
By the way, my favorite movie of all time is Dr. Zhivago.",1486166400,,435,4.589743589743589

1651519,3,B00005QTAU,"There are some nice things about this film.  Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer are both attractive actors, very enjoyable to watch.  Some feel Pheiffer was miscast, a little to picture-perfect for the role.  One reader informed us that this is an adaptation of a stage play that starred Kathy Bates and F. Murray Abraham.  Wow...that must have been a very different Frankie and Johnny.  Since this was made in Hollywood and directed by Gary Marshall, this version is considerably sweetened up for mass consumption.

There are some lovely moments,.  I liked the scene in the flower market, where the two are standing together  and the metal door slides up to display a dazzling backdrop of red and orange flowers.  Also, the final scene with the toothbrushes and Claire de Lune is nicely done.  Pfeiffer is particularly good here and Pacino backs her up all the way.

Still there are so many hackneyed cliches.  Perhaps its just that we have seen so many films, good ones in which people are more realistically portrayed that it's annoying to see so many old-timey stock types:  the good hearted gay buddy, the good hearted but slutty waitress buddy (think ""Flo"" from ""Alice,"" the good hearted Greek retaurant owner, the good hearted homely waitress buddy, the good-hearted Puerto Rican busboy and the good-hearted Black busboy.  Then there are the good hearted clients.  If they had gone for realistic characterizations of some of these people rather than going for heart-warming ""types"" this could have been a much better film.  I blame Garry Marshall for this.  Pacino and Pfeiffer did their best to bring some class to this film.  Enjoy it for their appearances but don't expect too much.",1414540800,,1689,4.929078014184397

1651548,4,B00005QTAU,"Al Pacino and Michele Pfeiffer together in a romantic comedy. This one has been out for a while now, so IF you have never seen it and you are looking to watch a movie this might be cute enough for you to snuggle with that special person you care about to watch it or if you just need to kill two hours before doing or going somewhere.  It is about two people struggling to find out where they are heading in life and get their act in order and as they are doing this, they meet. It is the old ""love, at first sight"" story for him towards someone Michele that's had a rough life coming never to trust anyone after her past experiences even though she wants and feels for this guy. They are both surrounded by some good supporting cast like Hector Elizondo (from pretty woman hotel manager fame, among others) as the owner of the small mom & pap restaurant serving a crowd mostly of senior citizens set in their ways. Pacino is the cook and Michele plays one of the servers. Some rough patches they go thru while trying to figure out if they are right for each other but good therapy. There is that ""old"" fashion romantic touch you hardly ever see anymore from a guy that really cares trying to assure he's the real thing. Nice little movie and I hope you like it.",1400716800,,1262,4.258333333333334
1651549,4,B00005QTAU,"When the University of Oklahoma had a good basketball team back in the days of Waymon Tisdale, the coach was asked about his team's strategy.  His reply: ""We just get the ball to Waymon and get the hell out of his way.""  In this movie -- expanded from a two-actor stage play by Terence McNally -- when Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer have the ball, all goes relatively well, but in the expansion for the big screen, McNally has added a lot of extra clutter.  The additional characters are mostly lovable eccentric New York stereotypes, and not even the talents of Nathan Lane, Hector Elizondo, Kate Nelligan, and the others can make them more than one-dimensional.  Still, they're lively, and the scenes in the restaurant in the busy times have a kind of energy and color that's appealing.  More important, perhaps, these scenes let us see Frankie and Johnny interacting with others, with the result that Johnny doesn't seem as creepy as he otherwise might (an unsympathetic woman might consider him a stalker), and Frankie shows that she isn't all about depression and neediness.

Pacino and Pfeiffer are very appealing, which is good, because their characters aren't all that interesting. Johnny was jailed for forging a signature on a check and spent 18 months in the slammer, which is where he developed his cooking skills.  He has come out desperate for connection and real affection.  Frankie can't, as they say, ""commit,"" and it takes most of the movie's almost two hours for us to find out why that is.  The sexual chemistry between them is not a problem, and part of the movie's agenda is to make sure that we see the difference between that chemistry and a love that is protective and nurturing.  The movie succeeds as well as it does because Pacino convinces the audience, as well as Frankie, that that is what he has to offer, and because Pfeiffer is believable as a wounded woman (even before we know what the wounds are) and not just a wet blanket.  This isn't the best movie that Pacino or Pfeiffer has been in, but they carry it pretty well.",1400112000,,2057,4.686111111111111

Nathan Lane is exceptional in ""Frankie and Johnny"" although he only has a few scenes.  Michelle Pfeiffer, as Frankie, is in so much emotional pain that you can read it on her face.  Al Pacino as Johnny gives one of the best performances of his career...I actually liked him in this movie.  They meet when working at a Greek restaurant that is a dive.  The characters in the restaurant move the story along with their richly developed personal stories and wonderful drawn personalities.  Kate Nelligan plays against type and steals almost every scene she is in.  Johnny falls madly, deeply in love with Frankie who has so many emotional walls up to be kept from being hurt again that it seems almost impossible for a relationship to succeed.

1651660,3,B00005QTAU,"My wife saw this movie years ago, and absolutely hated it.  She found it boring and sleep inducing and so when I decided to rent it she was highly apposed.  In the end, I wound up watching this all by my lonesome and I must say that I am on the fence at the moment.

I love so much and then again, there is this unsavory taste on my tongue.

The film is based on a stage play and basically follows an ex-convict named Johnny, who is trying to establish roots as a fry-cook and woo the reclusive and somewhat abrasive waitress, Frankie.  They both notice each other, and there is definite chemistry, but she is playing hard to get, hiding a past that is obviously making a true connection difficult for her, and he is pushing the issue very hard, getting too close for comfort.

I'll start with the things I loved.

Michelle Pfeiffer.  I mean, seriously; she's outstanding here.  She completely sinks into this role and delivers one of her finest performances of her career.  From a technical aspect, she's spot on.  The accent, the body language, the delivery; all of it is beautifully astute...but in the end it is the heart with which she embodies this woman that stands out the brightest.  When she finally confides in Johnny, it's enough to break your heart.  Al Pacino is also VERY good here.  I was expecting his usual antics, but then I remembered that this was early 90's, back before he decided to just regurgitate stereotypes as actual performances.  He does one `Hoo-Ha', but once he has that out of the way he shoots straight and delivers a beautifully composed and heartfelt performance.

I'm on the fence about the script.  In parts I love it.  The dialog between Frankie and Johnny is smart and natural.  You can tell it was adapted from a stage play because a lot of the interaction between the two leads is dialog heavy and relies on our acceptance of their conversations to really work, but the leads handle the words wonderfully and they are really engaged and poignant conversations.  But then there is the development of supporting characters that is rather underwhelming.  But, maybe that is the fact that I found the supporting cast, outside of Kate Nelligan, to be atrocious.

Yes, Hector Elizondo seriously followed up his beautiful `Pretty Woman' performance with this bland as dirt stereotype.  Faring worst of all is Nathan Lane, who fails to deliver any of his lines.  He just isn't funny, at all, and he is supposed to be major comic relief here.  It's sad when you can tell that someone is supposed to serve a certain purpose.  It's too obvious.  Lane is just horrible here.  Jane Morris is also just bad.  But then again, I certainly blame the script on that one.

Oh, and the closing `wrap up' with an overview of the characters in bed was just dumb.

In the end, there is more than enough to validate seeing this.  Pfeiffer is one of the best of the year, and if it weren't for the iconic duo of Sarandon and Davis coming out in 1991, I'd be forced to name her the absolute best.  It is soft and sweet yet laced with an acidic bite.  It's just drug down by some poor acting and clichd character development.",1339027200,,3141,4.540106951871658

Here he meets and falls in love with waitress Michelle Pfeiffer - only she's got a head full of bad memories with men and resists Pacino like the plague. He keeps plugging away, though, and predictably wins her over.

1651719,5,B00005QTAU,"This is one of the lesser known and appreciated screen gems of the 90's. It's a superior romantic-comedy-drama which stars screen legend Al Pacino and screen goddess Michelle Pfeiffer. The movie is so much more about the love story. It is a very perceptive movie about people who are lonely and people who are trapped into their own lives. The movie has an achingly melancholic mood.

The casting of Michelle Pfeiffer was controversial at that time because the original role on Broadway was played by Kathy Bates and a lot of people think Pfeiffer was too beautiful for the role. Bates reportedly laughed when she learned hat Pfeiffer got the role. Granted that the reason Pfeifer probably got the role was because at that time she was at the height of her popularity, she was the ""it"" girl then. But Pfeiffer was phenomenal and proved that she deserved the part. Her beauty was toned down to make her look as ordinary as possible. The character she played has so much depth and layer that is pretty uncommon for films generally regarded as romance films.

Pacino of course was good, this is his and Pfeiffer's second team up after Scarface of course I love the fact that he played the role with such ease and charm which is a lot different from his more serious roles before. The supporting actors Nathan Lane and Kate Nelligan stole some scenes

Of all the movies of Pfeiffer this is one of my all time favorites together with Fabulous Baker Boys, Married to the Mob, One Fine Day, and Batman Returns to name a few. I whole-heartedly recommend this film.

1651722,5,B00005QTAU,"Thre are a lot of things to like about this movie. The supporting actors to a person are perfectly cast. It's hard not to believe that the director just took over a Greek greasy spoon in New York and used its employees. You can literally smell the grease as the short-order cooks scramble the eggs and bacon. And you can feel the loneliness in the pit of your stomach as these characters go home to their less-than-fine apartments. They are the people Barbara Ehrenreich writes about in NICKEL AND DIMED. Robert Frost would say they have nothing to look backward to with pride and nothing to look forward to with hope. Paul McCartney would call them Eleanor Rigby. Many of them will never rise about their minimum wage-plus tips jobs; yet they show a resilence and endurance and manage to find laughter in their dismal jobs that is heart-warming.

This film has as good a portrayal of gay characters as you are likely to see. Terrence McNally has created here two, believable, likeable gay men who act like real people. There is a quite funny scene when Al Pacino meets the gay couple for the first time and makes all the usual mistakes though well-intentioned-- he didn't realize, you would never know, he just found out that his cousin is gay-- to which Nathan Lane quips that he will check the cousin out in the new listings.

This movie says that a short-order cook (Al Pacino) recently released from prison can find happiness with a waitress (Michelle Pfeiffer) with broken dreams. That may be a tall challenge, but most of us would like to believe in that possibility. It's all about starting over, taking a chance, tearing down the walls that separate most of us from each other and taking a chance on love.

 Michelle Pfeiffer cleans up well and is almost too pretty to be a down-and-out waitress. But then, nobody's perfect.",1090627200,,1833,4.6656346749226
1651723,5,B00005QTAU,"The dialogs are a dream come true.

I heard some people were upset that Michelle Pfeiffer was cast as Frankie. Apparently the actress who played that character on stage was Kathy Bates and came to be regarded by many as definitive in that role. I'm sure she was terrific, and I loved her in ""Dolores Claiborne"", but as much as I sympathize with those who claim that it's all part of Hollywood's conspiracy to make ordinary women feel dissatisfied with their ""real"", ordinary bodies and faces, Michelle Pfeiffer - gorgeous as she is - is a sensitive, real performer, not a Barbie doll in any way, and though I couldn't be more different from her physically, I find it very easy to relate to her thanks to her talent.
The movie is a gem, though every time I watch anything with Al Pacino in it I'm always counting the seconds for the ""scream scene"". I'm not sure I ever watched a movie in which he starred, that he didn't scream his head off at some point, and this one's no exception. One love scene is basically spoiled by it, although die hard fans can always make the case that the script was asking for it. No minor problems like this one can spoil the movie as a whole though, that's what's important.",1070755200,,1205,4.427927927927928

I am totally hooked to this movie. I guess it is because I can find my own fears in Michelle Pfeiffer's character but even so it is the only movie that effects me so much each time. It is a pure peace of art. It is simple, basic but it hits you straight to the heart. Don't miss it !!",1028160000,,462,3.8229166666666665
1651745,1,B00005QTAU,"Ostensibly a love story, this film incorporates as many politically correct stances on the issues as just about any film ever made. It starts out with sexual harassment, then adds wife beating, criminal rights, the death penalty, and more. Of course, we get sympathetic portrayals of women, ethnic/racial minorities, criminals and gays, but there is not one law-abiding heterosexual White male portrayed favorably in this film.

The characters are not at all believable. Someone with Michelle Pfeiffer's looks working in a greasy, Westside diner? Yeah, right! In my thirteen years in New York City, I've never seen it. A woman like that would have doctors, lawyers, CEOs, and investment bankers falling all over her. At worst, if she had no education, she'd end up behind the cosmetic counter at Saks Fifth Avenue.

And we're supposed to believe that Al Pacino did hard time in a maximum security prison (while in prison, he befriended a murderer who was executed) for a first-offense, bad check.

The film pretends to be about ex-con Al Pacino pursuing Pfeiffer. Does he get her in the end? If, without seeing this movie, you can't predict the answer to that one, then maybe this film is your speed.",1027900800,,1200,4.960199004975125
1651746,5,B00005QTAU,"Saw this film when it first came out and though it takes about an hour to get into its best moments, it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Michelle Pfeiffer is a gifted actress. Pacino has never been more affable. For once, he doesn't take himself too seriously. And another plus is that these two stars had on-screen chemistry - a factor missing from Pfeiffer's pairings with Hollywood's leading men often, i.e. Robert Redford (UP CLOSE & PERSONAL)and recently Harrison Ford (WHAT LIES BENEATH.) The VHS I just bought is in lousy condition so tonite's much awaited viewing was ""painful"" for me. I hadn't seen the film since it was on the big screen about 10 yrs ago. It holds up well - it's completely character driven and though short on plot - it's believable. An added bonus was seeing my hometown - NYC looking good. This is clearly one of Garry Marshall's best directorial efforts - a small but good-to-the-last-drop flick. Final note on special features: seeing Nathan Lane begin what was to become a stellar career, as the gay-best-friend, for once-done well, in good taste, though. (Rupert Everett - take some notes here.) All in all well worth the 110 mins.",1022803200,,1171,4.717073170731707
1651747,5,B00005QTAU,"This movie means so much to me.  The script, the acting, the directing-- it all comes together with a great story to offer up some really amazing moments.  It captures the intrinsic quality of loneliness, the fear of being close to someone, the courage to be true to yourself.  Al Pacino's character is almost creepy, and the elegant Michelle Pfeiffer is, believe it or not, downright dowdy.  Even on the fifth viewing, I found myself feeling embarassed (alone in the room), my heart aching, and my idealism & hope returned to me.
For those of you who want a storyline:  Al Pacino is an ex-con on his first post-prison employment.  Michelle Pfeiffer is the main character, a waitress who catches his eye, and he persues her.  But he's kind of creepy, and she has that post heartbreak love of being alone, so she rejects him.  And so he persues her more, showing more of his creepy touchy-feely idealistic self, and a bunch of stuff happens, and they live happily ever after.  It is a romantic drama, after all.  Many funny moments, and an excellent cast-- early classic work for Nathan Lane in here as well.",1011052800,,1107,4.630769230769231
1651748,3,B00005QTAU,"1991's Frankie and Johnny is not a sugary sweet formula romantic comedy. Unfortunately it is not a particularly realistic or believable slice of life romantic drama either.  How could it be with stars like Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer directed by Garry Marshall?
Many will like the film quite a bit because there are some scenes that work and the stars are either much better than you expect (Pfeiffer) or simply exude the charm and charisma you want from them (Pacino).  The supporting characters seem to be from another film or t.v. sit-com and all of it is 100 percent predictable, but the film is not difficult at all to sit through.
Part of the blame is director Garry Marshall who worked so long in television (Happy Days, Laverne and Shirley) he probably really believes he could pull this off as a feature film.  He doesn't let the film become overly up beat and sickeningly sweet, but he refuses to ever put any real doubt in our minds that it won't have a happy ending either.  Marshall just can't help
dousing everything with an un-real fairy dust...like in 'A Pretty Woman' or the recent 'Princess Diaries'.  Those were supposed to be fantasy films however,Frankie and Johnny was originally something grittier and more realistic. It was originally a harder edged two-character stage play that starred Kathy Bates and F. Murray Abraham.
Al Pacino plays Johnny who's actually a really decent and nice guy even though he's just gotten out of prison.  Johnny gets a job as a short cook at the same diner where Frankie works. Frankie refuses to open up, Johnny needs to love and be loved by someone desperately.  Johnny decides that Frankie is the one he needs and it's destiny that has put them together like this.  Johnny's infatuation with Frankie doesn't seem like a stretch at all....I mean she almost looks like Michelle Pfeiffer.  Johnny comes across somewhat like a scary stalker as much as an obsessed lover.  So despite everyone's best effort the entire film feels like a corny Hollywood romance. The film however is written to be the opposite of a cornball Hollywood romance. I hate to say that the biggest fault of the movie is the fact that Pfeiffer is too damned good looking to play the part... but it's the truth. I hate to say that because Pfeiffer is actually better in the film then Pacino is.  Pacino falls back several times on the type of please the crowd surliness and schtick that the film is trying to convince us it's above.  Pfeiffer on the other hand buries herself in playing her character so completely she almost makes us believe she has got to be a rather plain looking woman.
The DVD present the film very nicely but gives you no extras.

Their chemistry was off the charts, and the supporting cast was superb. Frankie is afraid of commitment after past relationships that soured her on men, and Johnny falls hard her. He spent some time in the slammer for a white collar crime, and works as a short order cook in the diner where she is a waitress. True love has its ups and down non stop-but Pacino gets through Pfeiffer's defenses, through sheer desperation and determination.
The musical score was perfect. I have watched love scenes in so many movies and Frankie and Johnny had the BEST love scene I have ever viewed with no real nudity and I credit Gary Marshall for pulling this off.
Nathan Lane plays Pfeiffer's best friend and gay neighbor, and his performance was spot on. I loved him and all the rest of the cast.
