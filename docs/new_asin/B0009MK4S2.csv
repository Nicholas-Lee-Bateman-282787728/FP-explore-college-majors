8451374,5,B0009MK4S2,"This is a wonderful film and is explained in depth, I loved viewing the film as it is a true account of the park, there is so much to Denali Park that seeing it in its entirety would take days to visits, this is a very good film, I would recommend to anyone that has been there or will soon visit Denali. The film has so much to offer, the animals, the plants of Denali. Thank you for making my trip to Denali, with 2 of my very best friends and for sharing your life with me.",1188259200,2,476,3.917525773195876
8451375,1,B0009MK4S2,Not worth the money I paid for it. The quality of production is low and the narrator sounds like he is tired or not interested in talking about Denali. Most of the footage is handheld and you can tell by how unsteady the picture is. I am very disappointed with this purchase,1171065600,,274,4.288461538461538
8451376,5,B0009MK4S2,"This DVD contains some of the most amazing Grizzly Bear scenes I have ever viewed.  In addition, there are Moose, Dall Sheep, Caribou, Wolves, a lot of smaller animals, birds and waterfowl to complete the package.  The details about the animals, their habitat, how they forage and manage to survive in the wild was educational and interesting.  I loved the closeup scenes of the little Pika and the Hoary Marmot.  What a thrill to see the rare scenes of a little Golden Eagle Eaglet!  I was pleased with the extra time spent to view Grizzly females and their cubs.  The family unity of these magnificent Bears as they foraged, nursed or played was amazing. The care the mother shows was quite endearing. This DVD is mostly about Wildlife, but also contains some spectacular scenery.  It was rewarding to learn about a part of Alaska that I have not had the privilege to visit.  It was interesting to find out why locals and many visitors call North America's tallest mountain Denali instead of Mt. McKinley. The narration is not a famous voice but is obviously done by a person with a vast knowledge and a deep love of the wildlife and Denali National Park. The Scene Selection Menu with a special map, allows you to easily view favorite scenes over and over.  The additional bonus material is a definite plus.  This presentation was informative, pleasant and very enjoyable.  I would and will recommend this film to anyone who enjoys North America's wildlife and the wilderness in which they live.  This is indeed a special film about ""A Special Place.""",1122422400,6,1554,4.757462686567164
8451377,1,B0009MK4S2,"I, myself, am a video producer and was quite dissappointed in this DVD. The visual presentation was alright, but the audio and narration was diplorable! The narrator was boring and the audio mix was way off. You could barely hear the narration under the music. Even the choice of music was uninteresting. All in all, very disappointing for the money.",1121817600,,350,4.85
