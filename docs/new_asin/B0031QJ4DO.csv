8387170,5,B0031QJ4DO,"If you like wushu/kungfu, you'll love this movie.  If you have even just a little curiosity about what wushu/kungfu is, you'll love this movie.  It is a great movie, not only because the wushu/kungfu moves are so enjoyable to watch, but also it tells about the essence, the moral of wushu/kungfu and it teaches a lesson about making choices.  I highly recommend this movie, especially to the young adults/teens who likes wushu/kungfu.",1340064000,,434,5.0
