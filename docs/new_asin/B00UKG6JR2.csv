7049639,5,B00UKG6JR2,Love the concept of AimPoint. I still haven't mastered the feeling the different exact slope degrees yet but there are moments where I feel myself getting close. Got my first eagle on a 60 foot double breaker by using AE. My biggest issue is my digital level (I bought the one Amazon suggests). I can't seem to get it calibrated.,1492992000,,329,4.5

7049642,5,B00UKG6JR2,"This is essentially a video version of the one-hour AimPoint Express on-course training. The cost of the video is about half of the training session. I didn't purchase it to save on the cost of training,  but because there were no training sessions immediately upcoming in my area. That said, adopting the AimPoint Express system has helped my putting tremendously. I've gone from 38-40 putts a round to 28-35 per round (even the putts I'm missing are because I'm leaving them short or putting them long, not because of my line). It's an easy system to learn. The most difficult thing is to learn to read slope using your feet. After a while you begin to determine variations from zero to four degrees of slope. For me it's not an exact science (for example, my feet can't accurately distinguish between, say 2-1/2 degrees of slope and 2), but it gets you close to the exact line you need for your putts. I noticed Adam Scott using it in the Masters last weekend. He'd read the putt using one finger (one percent) and two fingers (two percent), which I'm assuming meant he was reading a green at one and a half percent, or was determining his line based on different speeds. In any case, I'm glad I purchased this video as it has helped my game considerably.",1491955200,,1258,4.566371681415929

7049661,5,B00UKG6JR2,"I bought the DVD and wow!  I had to watch it twice out of the box, as they go too fast and it is a lot to process.  Some people have fat fingers and others thin so you have to practice.  On the course, after five rounds it makes more and more sense.  The main point is that you eliminate three putts and actually make more 12 to 18 footers.  But the ball does get REALLY close if you have distance control, which I try to control by looking at the target and making several practice swings.  I had a 70 foot putt on 18 yesterday and it was a 4 finger drop...it stopped six inches away...just bragging.  This system makes you read the right to left, down hill and stimp speed etc but really works.  Figuring out a 1,2,3,4 percent slope sounds hard but you will get it if you retain your guesses.  One percent is 3.6 degrees, 2 percent is 7.2 degrees...I have done Dave Pelz short game school, and this is a new way of looking at putting.  I truly think this is a great add on system to putting.  Then again like many tools, the honeymoon is not over.  But first week in, it is a game changer.",1442534400,20,1091,4.09433962264151

7049663,5,B00UKG6JR2,"Everybody tends to underestimate the break.  It's a known fact. AimPoint  will improve your putting and reduce three putts, especially on high breaking putts.

AimPoint tells you the break only.  You determine the putting surface inclination from 1 to 5, and place the same number of fingers on the lower lip to know  where to aim.  AimPoint does not cover putter speed (pace), mechanics or fitting.

Ball speed is a requirement of all putts and putting techniques.  For AimPoint to work you must putt  so that the ball rolls a foot (30 cms)  beyond the hole.",1440374400,,559,4.729166666666667
7049664,5,B00UKG6JR2,"I began playing golf more regularly about five years ago and while my general game developed encouragingly, my putting did not. I was able to develop a more consistent putting stroke, but my ability to 'read' greens remained very poor. I took a few lessons and read about and tried a variety of common approaches, including the ever-popular 'plumb-bob putter,' walking the green, identifying areas of water pooling, looking at the green from various angles, crouching or even prostrating yourself to look at the surface, all with no real success. Worse, many made little sense to me and felt more like rituals than scientifically sound approaches. For example, if you look at the wide variety of putters sold today, it seems impossible to believe that ANY of them would provide anything like a plumb line reference when dangled by the handle. So my putting line was more often dependent on getting to see someone else putt from near my position or making a best guess. Then I discovered the AimPoint system while Googling around looking for help. It was based on actual data collected from careful green-mapping measurements. It was a logical and understandable system. Perhaps most important, it was easy to learn the basics and begin applying them. The results are nothing short of amazing to me. I have slashed 10 strokes off my game by reducing the number of three or more putts that resulted from mis-reads! If I can get better control of my putting speed/distance I'll be even better!!! The system is almost deceptively easy to learn and you can practice on any putting green. You may feel a bit shy or silly implementing it, walking the line, holding up your hand, etc., but you WON'T feel silly watching those putts drop and writing down those lower scores!!!! Short of hiring a personal caddy, THIS is the best system I have found for improving your putting game. Highly recommended, unless you regularly play against me, in which case, ignore all this and keep dangling your putter.",1440374400,4,1992,4.8617647058823525

8707178,5,B00UKG6JR2,"A number of people interested in AimPoint Express have asked, ""should I take the instructors course ($125-$200) or is the DVD enough""? I've taken the instruction class AND purchased the DVD, and unless you have money to burn you only need the DVD. You'll be able to get some subtle tips with the instruction but it's almost exactly what's covered in the DVD. I taken all that information to the course and practiced it. These are my comments from my experience:

AimPoint is predicated on two basic facts: The first, is that, after watching the DVD you'll be able to feel the slope of the green with your feet; and two, to work ideally it assumes you're able to stroke the putt along, or close to, your chosen line. The DVD only deals with the first premise, i.e., determining the correct green read for your putt.  The DVD covers all the fundamentals including short putts from 3'-6', birdie length putts from 7'-20', lag putts, single break and double break putts. The concept is very simple. Depending on the length and type of break of the putt you position yourself just to the low side of the putting line to read the slope of the green. The DVD covers slopes ranging from 1% to 5%. This will cover most situations on the course, but on challenging greens with severe breaks it's common that slopes greater than 5% will occur. Those are not covered but the concept and method of measuring is exactly the same. For each degree of slope you hold up one finger and determine the aim point by lining up one edge of your finger(s) on the edge or center of the cup, depending on the length of the putt, and then look at the opposite side of the finger(s) to see where the AimPoint of your putt is located. In theory, that's all there is to it, and in the video they move quickly and they make it look simple. The AimPoint inventor uses two young golfers and a kid to show us how it works and they make it appear that after a few minutes you'll know how to read slopes and knock in putts from all over the place. They even show the little kids making a 50' putt. Don't assume that in practice it's that easy...it isn't. The AimPoint Express fundamental premise is that you are able to read, with consistency, the percentage slope of the green. To do that you will need a level with a percentage readout so that you can practice recognizing the actual slope of your intended putt line. The only way to get used to feeling slopes accurately with your feet is to set up some spots with 1%-5% slopes and stand on them to begin to know what these slope percentages feel like. Without the level theres no way to do that. Husky makes a $40 level, that I bought at Home Depot that works great. I spent several hours going through slope exercises on one of the greens at my course. The hardest part is being able to sense the 0%-2.5% slopes. Those subtle slopes are hard to distinguish. Once you get to 3% slopes and greater they are much easier to feel. Unfortunately, especially on shorter putts, most of your slopes will be less than 3% slope. I could usually get within 1% of the real slope but not always. It's going to take a little more time for me to refine and recognize slope. My instructor said that if we can get to within .5% that would be excellent. Another thing that you'll need to know is how far out do you hold your fingers when measuring for the AimPoint?  That depends on the length of your arm, the thickness of your fingers and the green speeds. Obviously, you need to practice this on your course greens. Faster greens break more than slower greens so if you are constantly missing on the low side you should bend your elbow more to bring your fingers closer to your face when measuring for the AimPoint and vice versa.

As you can see the concept is simple but making it work on the course will take practice, so to prevent any frustration and giving up on AimPoint I strongly suggest that you get the level, with % function,  and take it to practice green and work with the system until you understand and have confidence with it. If you just go out to the course and guess about slope and how to measure for green speed you'll end up saying that the system doesn't work. My personal experience (I'm a 9 index) thus far has been that's it's a great help on longer putts with more severe slopes. AimPoint has shown me that I need to play much more break on these putts than are apparent to the eye and it has been quite accurate in this regard. I haven't yet been able to nail down the feel for the subtle sub-3% slopes but I'm convinced that just requires a little more practice. I use a line on my ball to show my intended putt line. I noticed that with AimPoint when I hold up my finger(s) and then put my hand and head down to line up my ball the AimPoint is no longer clear to me, so I've determined that when my finger(s) have determined the AimPoint rather than look next to the cup I look at an object in the distance (it can be anything) that lines up with my AimPoint, and then when I'm lining up my ball I just line it up with the object I've selected in the distance. That works great and gives me the confidence I have the right line.

In summary, just get the DVD and a level and you're ready to go. Skip the expensive instruction. Some reviewers have said the DVD is too short and they go to fast. That's only because they are not familiar with the process and they're learning something new.  Heck, I've watched the video three times already and I took the instruction first. Be patient, make a few notes and go out and practice. I think you'll be pleased with the result and even if you're not a great putter AimPoint will at least help you to get your misses closer closer to the hole.

UPDATE 8/18/2018:  It's been about 2 weeks since I bought the DVD and have spent about 2 hours everyday with the slope level on different greens at our club testing all the different slopes and distance situations that I could think of. I have a couple of observations. First, I found that with putts inside 7' I was better off just to use my eye to line up the putt. It's too easy to be off by a half a percent slope and that is enough on a short putt to make you miss the putt. From 8' and further the AimPoint was more accurate than my eye. On fast downhill breaking putts I definitely had to bend my elbow at about 90 degrees. On fairly level breaking putts 45 degrees seemed to work best but on fairly steep uphill putts I had very little bend in my elbow. The obvious reason this is necessary is because slower (downhill) putts break more than faster (uphill) putts. I also confirmed that AimPoint works wonders on longer breaking putts. These are the putts that most amateurs under-read and AimPoint takes a lot of the guesswork out those challenging reads. Reading slope percentages gets easier the more you do but it's still a pretty subtle feel. I have found a neat way to quickly confirm my slope feel. When I set my feet apart to read the slope I concurrently let my putter hang like a pendulum between my thumb and forefinger with the edge of the putter grip centered on my zipper. I then look down at the  line on my putter and I can read the putter head deflection between my shoes. I've done it enough to know how much deflection equates to what slope percentage. If my slope feel and my pendulum deflection are not the same I go with the putter deflection because it's actually more accurate than my feel. Keep in mind that when you read left breaking putts vs. right breaking putts the putter will need to be turned 180 degrees so that you get an accurate deflection in each direction. I don't know if this works with all putters because they are weighted and balanced differently but it works perfectly with my Ping putter. If I've described this clearly you might give it a try for fun...maybe it will work for you too. Good luck.",1533600000,2,7870,4.343983684568321
