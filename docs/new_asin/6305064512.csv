8170473,4,6305064512,"This is a good movie for a soft porn flick, but why the hell is it only VHS? You're telling me that they can put the Godfather series in a DVD, but not in a 1998 porn flick? May the universe forsake me. (sigh) So anyway, I'm reviewing this all from memory sense I no longer have a V-H-S. The story starts off on what you see in the cover of this pic, the story continues to grow from a kid's feancee' (I don't know how to spell French.) that want's to have sex before marriage, so she meets this guy in a bar and ends up bangin' her in a cabin somewhere without protection. It turns out that it was the kid's father. And the story goes from there, and it leaves it open-ended, sense no one knows what happened to her in 9 months.",1357084800,,729,4.0

There is a storyline but it is secondary to the display of the flesh offered. And what flesh it is!",1333929600,,272,4.333333333333333
8170475,3,6305064512,This movie is about a woman (FAWNA MACLAREN) who is obssesed with a man. There are other storylines including one with carrie westcott who along with fawna were playboy playmates. don't expect great drama or performances but there is some sexual tension and nudity.,998697600,,265,5.045454545454546
