3911890,4,B002DMJVV2,"IMDb says this film is 60 minutes, but the Amazon.com instant video is a little under 47 minutes. I did not notice any obvious cuts to account for the missing time.

The story is simple and reasonable believable. Two thirteen-year-old boys, due to their own misbehavior, become stranded on an island. Unfortunately for them the island is being used as a hideout for two escaped convicts. The arrival of the boys, to say nothing of the search for the boys, are also unfortunate for the escaped convicts.

The story does not focus on the search, but on the cat and mouse game between the convicts and the boys. One convict, it would seem, would not have a big problem with killing the boys, but the other is opposed to that idea. The convicts are low on supplies, and the boys have none of their own. After learning of the presents of the convicts the boys up their attempts to get off the island, and after being captured are constantly trying to escape from the convicts, but of course still have the problem of being stranded on an island with them.

The story moves forward at a steady pace but with enough low-key action and suspense to stay interesting throughout the 46 to 47 minutes.",1407801600,7,1189,4.546728971962617

8365489,4,B002DMJVV2,"Wonderful movie!  It seems like every modern movie has to be as over the top as possible, but this one is just a short, well-scripted adventure.  Nothing life-changing, I suppose, but I don't really think it was expected to tear apart your whole existence with an epiphany about mankind (*cough* every modern movie *cough*).

I wasn't born in the seventies, but kids will be kids no matter when they were born.  Black Island reminds me of my own childhood, running off and getting into trouble.  Well, maybe not THIS much trouble, but...

I don't want to say anything and give it all away, so just watch it!",1452643200,,607,4.626168224299065

8365491,3,B002DMJVV2,"I had never ordered the kind of DVD like this which appears to be a kind of ""print on demand"" but was pleasantly surprised to find that the disc had no problems whatsoever and displayed picture and sound that was comparable to what I'd hoped for - the sort of display that might have appeared on television (or cable) 35 years ago when this would have first been shown.

Of course there are no ""extras"" whatsoever, nor subtitles, etc.  But the movie was completely watchable without any problems, providing a standard 1980s tv-style image (not widescreen).  To my knowledge, this ""full screen"" image is probably the original format for this short film, which might also have been available in 16mm movie reels at the time.

The film is short - about 46 minutes - but of decent quality for its genre.  It's a decent British production made for young viewers, and since I grew up with this type of show, I found it to be of decent quality.  Unknown actors doing what they could to provide a realistic-sort of presentation for a couple of schoolboys who get lost and find themselves in the midst of an adventure rather than just another ordinary day.  The adventure is pretty low-key (no special visual effects) but interesting enough, given the presumption of ordinary kids in a realistic setting.  The plot is nothing special of course - this doesn't aim to be more than a simple story of ""what if things went astray on an outing"" - with an implicit theme that one of the boys becomes better accepted by his peers as a result of the adventure.  Nothing earth-shaking.  But I wanted to post sort of a favorable review about the DVD format, which I found to be quite functional even though I had misgivings about whether this would play in my DVD player.  Since I had no problems there, I'm satisfied with my purchase.  The film itself will be worth an occasional re-viewing when I'm feeling nostalgic to re-live some of the 1970s moods of my childhood.  This short film would have been typical viewing fare for educational and television use, back then, to mildly entertain with what was then G-rated fare (today more like PG for mild violence/threat) while building the character of young persons by evoking their interest in the outdoors, keeping them wary of criminals hiding out, etc.  This would have been a standard diversion in between my reading of another Hardy Boys novel or comic book.  Glad that these scarce, near-forgotten films are actually available in some format, like this.",1434931200,,2490,4.731481481481482

8365493,4,B002DMJVV2,"Two boys wander away from their field-trip group, winding up on a deserted island. They discover that they're not alone, as two criminals have been using the island as a hideout. Drama ensues when the two parties meet, causing a fight for survival. While fairly non-violent, BLACK ISLAND is a decent little kid adventure movie from England. The crooks are well-played, especially the very thuggish, Jack (Michael Elphick) who gives a zesty performance w/ just the right amount of menace. He sort of reminded me of Oliver Reed's more sinister portrayals. Suitable for family viewing...",1427241600,,584,5.157894736842105
