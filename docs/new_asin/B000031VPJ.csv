But ""Destiny""'s highest recognition was it's selection  for the 50th Anniversary Award at Cannes also. This prize is given only  once to a most outstanding and distinguished movie.

1256640,4,B000031VPJ,"Like many a philosopher before and after him Avveros(Ibn Rushd) was the subject of ridicule by the ignorant and fanatic alike. Youssef Chahine deserves a great deal of credit for having the courage to make this film. While the film lacks good lighting and the accent is egyptian, the struggle  between secular and ultra orthodox is a story that deserves to be examined  thoroughly. The film set in 12th century Andalusia(Spain) could just as  well be set in any modern day society (not just Muslim societies). The film  would be a lot more impressive if it was dubbed in English. The dialogue is  quite immpressive when Avveros presents his arguments. I hope that the film  will be dubbed because it has a lot to say and I intend to use it in my  teaching at the University. Thank you Mr. Chahine. I wish you would make  more films about the other greats like Alhaytham( Alhazen),Ibn Sina and Ibn  Khaldoun. Perhaps funding for these projects could be secured from  educational and artistic foundations.",957225600,10,1003,4.77906976744186
1256641,2,B000031VPJ,"Destiny or Al-Maseer as it is known in Arabic is a gorgeous looking whitewash about the ever present link between Religion and violence. The message here ofcourse is that fanatacism is an abberation of the true  nature of Islam, and while this is certainly true, the director Yousef  Shahin forgets to involve the audience on a dramatic level before spoon  feeding them this ever so politically correct message.
  The first and  most jarring problem is the accents, which are for the most part modern  Egyptian slang. Western audiences won't mind this, as they are reading  sub-titles anyway, however as a person who speaks the language I found the  characters' accents hilarious. Imagine Keanu Reeves in Bill and Ted state  of mind acting in Spartacus.
  Another highly unnessecary device is  having the characters break into song every 10 minutes, it not only  destroys the dramatic tension, but this being a religious epic the result  is often ludicrous. Roger Ebert found this charming in his review of the  film, but he isn't familiar with the fact that singing in non-musical films  is a constant irritation in Egyptian films.
  This maybe unpatriotic of  me, as I am Egyptian, but this confused film is probably one of the best  films in Egyptian cinema for a couple of years now. But just because it is  less terrible then most of the dross produced does not make it anygood .  There is a compelling film to be made from this material, the relationship  between organised idealogy and violence goes as far back as the begining of  man. Unfortunately Destiny is not that film.",956620800,13,1583,4.8389513108614235
1256642,5,B000031VPJ,"Once again, Chahine outdoes himself. This film is of great quality; the cinematography, the soundtrack, the acting, the scenario, everything. The stories of great Arab/Muslim persons are often forgotton. Chahine reminds  us of IbnRushd the great philosopher and of the true essence of Islam that  is based on love of life. It is a witty and powerful criticism of religious  fanatics who destroy the image of a religion of which the very name means  peace.  The only bad thing about this film is the scene where 'Laila  Elwee' dances the flamenco. But, her acting elswhere is genuine. I would  love to see more movies by this world famous director on Amazon.com.",948758400,8,661,4.900900900900901
7916403,4,B000031VPJ,"Egyptian director Youssef Chahine biopic of Arab philosopher Averroes (who lived in Andalusia during the 1100s) is surprisingly compelling, with fine production values, including a lavish color cinematography (this was a co production with France that won awards at the Cannes film festival in 1997). Averroes (played by Nour el Sheriff) is seen in the movie, avant la lettre, as a wise champion of rationality and against fundamentalism. Aside having to fight the intrigue of fundamentalists, he has to do some optical experiments and also has to deal with family problems, a misguided caliph, and Christian troops eager to attack Andalusia. The movie also includes ridiculous but charming musical interludes reminiscent of Indian movies.",1411344000,,739,5.491228070175438
7916404,4,B000031VPJ,"What an experience! The book, a metaphor of freedom and secularism; the song, a metaphor of rebellion, and dance, the art of it all. A swipe at Fundamentalism set in real history.",1383264000,,179,4.625
7916405,5,B000031VPJ,"Brings to life one of the most important episodes in world history.

I have done a lot of study of Averroism and its fatal wounding by fundamentalist politics in Islam, and then its eventual appropriation into Christianity via Thomism and into Judaism via Maimonides. This all helped to keep Greek philosophy and the quest for rationality alive in the West, while it was being slowly eclipsed in Islam. Here we have the beginning of the end of the Golden Age of Islam and a gradual slide of historical proportions.

How well does the film do this? It does not really try!! This is a big subject and difficult to communicate easily because it takes a lot of historical context both centuries before and after -- and not just political history but intellectual and religious history.

Yet it is wonderful to have even a small glimpse of this largely unknown but important time in history. I appreciate this so much that it is hard for me to discuss it as just another film. For me it was quite decent and engrossing.

I find some of the critics remarks interesting. The criticism about modern accents is a bit mysterious to understand. We are so used to English language films about Rome and so on with British accents and American accents that it seems like nitpicking to suggest that the film should have used ""authentic"" 800 year old accents. I am frankly irritated by British accents in classical films if I think about it, but I just try to remember that this is a matter of style and that correct accents are not known and some sort of decision has to be made.  Shakespeare films are being made with modern accents and that is an effort to make them more accessible  and bring them into our time. Okay that irritates some people and I am glad to know that, but if that is all they get out of a film then I say too bad for them.

The negative comments about too much breaking out into music are interesting. That sort of bothered me the slightest bit on first viewing. But then I thought that not all Islamic cultures have been alike and the Andalusian Muslims in that area  at that time had the reputation of joyous living. Maybe more like India or Mexico today than some of the more modern conservative Muslim countries.

The director was trying to make a point, but perhaps he did not really overdo his point. It may be more the case that some of the reviewers are mostly familiar with modern Muslim societies and found it unrealistic to portray a Muslim society where people were joyful in a rather ""secular"" way.  I should add that I love some of the joyful Sufi music, but that is religious and not ""festive"" or perhaps ""secular""  in the same way portrayed in the film. So perhaps that came across as unrealistic to people who know only modern Muslim societies. But then this is history -- that Islam back during the Golden Age and for a time was not the same in various parts of the world as it is today in so many parts of the world. And the changes had a lot to do with things that were happening around the time featured in the film. Again, we only get a glimpse of these changes in the film, but a very nice glimpse. In a sense I wonder if the critics who found this unrealistic were simply missing a major point of the film because they do not share the same historical context as the director and me seem to share.

So is the film ""politically correct""? That term has become a snide code word for so many things that it has no common meaning. I do think that the director was using an important chapter in history to try to make a point about certain dangers of mixing politics and religion, and the suppression of intellectual and other freedoms.

These sorts of tensions are still going on in the world's major religions. They have been realities for centuries. Is it ""politically correct"" to have TV series like The Tudors or The Borgias that deal with the messy side of mixing religion and politics? For some people ""politically correct"" is simply a slur against people who believe that religion and politics should be kept separate as though they have no good reasons for thinking this way, but are just being ""fashionable."" The director does probably (apparently) believe that religion and politics should be kept separate, but he tries to present some reasons for this sort of belief. In this sense he is not just being ""fashionable"" but is making a case. Any serious film is likely to have a point of view about something, even if the point of view is that some matter or other is not black and white. In this case the director's point of view is clear, that the fundamentalist mixing of religion and politics was not a good thing and by implication IS NOT a good thing.

If his going back into history to make his point inspires some reading, there is A LOT to chew on. The ""not a good thing"" turns out to be the undermining and hastened decline from the Golden Age of Islam. It is an active controversy how much the decline of independent reasoning ( Ijtihad ) contributed to the decline of Islam, but there are good arguments on the position that the director takes and towards which I now lean. This is not an issue that can be brushed aside.  At the very least it was bound to have been a non-trivial factor.

Considering the importance of this chapter in history and this excellent quality of this film, and the awards it has earned, it is a crime that this film is not available on a zone 1 DVD.",1369008000,,5426,4.460141271442986
7916406,4,B000031VPJ,"Youssef Chahine's ""Destiny"" or ""Al-Massir"" is a film that really deserves a wider audience in North America.  It is a fun, adventurous, and well-acted film.  Its subject is the important twelfth century Arab philosopher Ibn Rushd (or Averroes as he was known in Europe).  The movie takes place in the romantic setting of medieval Arab Spain, the enchanted land of al-Andalus.  The film is a commentary on the dangers of corrupt governments and religious fanaticism, and hence somewhat of a commentary of Chahine's Egypt of the 1990s.  As a testament to the film's passionate message of intellectual freedom, as well as its very good production and direction, it won the prestigious 50th Anniversary Palme D'or Prize at Cannes in 1997.  Though an Arabic film, it is available with French and English subtitles.

The star of the film, Nour El Cherif, does an excellent job of portraying Ibn Rushd, who was a brilliant judge and commentator of Aristotle, faced with issues of government, religion, and family.  The film has elements of a musical, in that at certain points the characters break into song and dance.  This is not overdone however, and mostly adds to the film's sense of fun, right alongside the very important issues it deals with.

As Ibn Rushd's reconciliation of faith and reason would be deeply influential in Europe, helping to foster such developments as the Renaissance, the film is important as it shows the interrelationship between Europe and the Arab world, between Christianity and Islam.  It also shows how ideas transcend borders, and highlights some of the universal values we all share regardless of culture.

Overall, a very, very good film that serves well as a Friday night movie, or a film for the classroom.",1258243200,4,1740,5.003472222222222
7916407,5,B000031VPJ,"This is a great historical epic.  It's from the 1100's Spain, which was ruled by Muslim rulers at the time.  It centers around Averroe who is a great medieval philosopher and a thinker.  He clashes with fundamentalists who are attempting to stamp out all free thought and other ""vices"" of their time.  It is not only a great historical account, but also a very urgent and important message for our day.  The irony of history is that at the time, the Muslim world was the educated world and Christian Europe was very backward and illiterate.  It's another one of those ""must see"" movies and in fact should be a required material for schools.

The movie is hard to get as it is a European production, but it's not impossible, try Amazon and Ebay -- it's worth it.  Just make sure you get NTSC version or have a PAL-compatible VCR/DVD if you get the PAL version.  There are also some movie rentals that have this movie in their foreign film section.  The film is in Arabic with English subtitles, which may discourage some, but it's wonderful.  Arabic is such a melodic language and it add authenticity to the account.",1220572800,2,1115,4.58080808080808
7916408,5,B000031VPJ,"I must admit that I am a Chahine junky. He may not be accurate, he may not be liked in the arab world (he is pretty unpolitically correct & bold in his work), but I enjoy his work. Especially the more recent work.
He choses not only real interesting actors, but he also has a style. You watch these movies in the movie theatre & your heart really races. He taes you to another world, one you'd like to stay in.
I just love all his movies, including this one. One comment though, Laial Olowy has acted with a little bit too much exaggeration. Not that it changed my mind.
Oh I also want to add that I love the fact that it's in contemporary language, it makes it all the more interesting to watch. Who in the arab world really enjoys classical arabic?",1059955200,3,750,4.215277777777778
7916409,4,B000031VPJ,"This is a moving and beautifully filmed tale of a war, the unending war between skeptical reason and religious fanaticism, with its dire political consequences. The setting is medieval Andalusia, but could also well be some contemporary Arab and Muslim country. One of Chahine's major aims is clearly to satirize the lust for power clothed in a religious robe that is a thorny issue in these quarters today. But the movie is chiefly about the relations between rational wisdom and a disquieting world, about music (some rousing numbers, and all the music is beautiful and shiny), about love. The movie should also appeal to a gay audience: Chahine is gay, as his brand of soft and ""ladish"" eroticism shows it very well. All in all, a highly ""watchable"", entertaining and thought-provoking piece of art that I cheerfully recommend.",1011657600,6,830,5.021739130434782
7916410,5,B000031VPJ,"The film by egyptian director Youssef Chahine ""Destiny"" , recalls the story of Averoes the writer and scientist and takes place partly in Andalusia. I recommend you to see this film on the Free minded writer in an age when Europe was living under religious inquisition, and Andalusia torn between political rivalry between religious and political intolerance. The film is a strong message against religious intolerance and Chahine is very courageous in his statements. The film was prized in Caan and did well at the box office. Sure it does have its shortcomings due to lack of financial help. The special effects were made in Paris Studio's, but on the whole the film is a spleandor for the eyes and ears. However beyond its political statement the film is also a hommage to Hollywoods golden Age Cinema, which influenced Chahines generation, in that it is at the sametime a Musical, a Peplum ( that is swords and sandles movie) and also a Comedy at times. I highly reccomend this film to westerners who can rediscover Egyptian cinema and one of its best directors.",997747200,10,1067,4.836065573770492
7916411,2,B000031VPJ,"Chahine is an esteemed director , when I see the reruns  of some of his early material such as "" Bab El-Hadid"" , I marvel at the  beauty and the simplicity of those films ,made  in the  pure neo-realist tradition. Yet ""The destiny"" is a weak and disconnected film , its main message is a ""politically correct""  one: there can be no strict adherence to a religious doctrine without fanaticism and to a certain extent terrorism , that message was almost tailored  to please the western media , and Mr Chahine was rewarded with the much coveted Palme d'Or.
  I also agree with Mr Hefny the reviewer from Cairo , he blew a great opportunity for a serious treatment of the subject of political  coercion in the name of religion . His decision to use egyptian  slang as the language of Andalusia some 800 years ago is a farce and an insult to the intelligence of the arab viewer. With all due respects to Mr Chahine , we deserve better than this.",987292800,3,940,4.412790697674419
