8390888,5,B0037ZAKDM,"I had struggled with something called Paruresis, shy bladder, for as far as I can remember. After doing the program regularly the mental tension and other fears I came to relate with my problem eased and I no longer suffer from what I hardly wanted to acknowledge and never discussed with others.  I think the program makes sense scientifically in terms of how pipe breathing stimulates the vagus nerve which has many implications for relaxation and stress relief and it seems every day a new study comes out that states the benefits of regular meditation.  I do the meditation portion before going to bed and it helps to clear my mind which allows me to get to sleep easily.  I notice a big difference in how I sleep from when I do the meditation and when I don't.  Overall the program helps and I owe a more positive and clearer mind to doing the program.",1333238400,15,857,4.509677419354839
8390889,5,B0037ZAKDM,"This breathing and meditation CD has helped me to create a positive change in my life.  I had never done much meditation before, and had never used a breathing program to relieve stress. This CD guided me through a breathing technique and meditation that greatly improved my mental, physical and emotional well being. The effect from the program is fast and profound as you release old baggage from the past, you breath in a new more relaxed life.",1332720000,11,447,4.730769230769231
8390890,5,B0037ZAKDM,"I got this video at the New Life Expo after seeing the lecture there.  I have done meditation before, but it was difficult for me to achieve effects and keep focused.  This breathing and meditation program makes it so simple, yet the positive effects come fast!

This video explains the science behind the breathing techniques.  It also explains how to do it step by step.  There's also a CD included that is great to play on my mp3 player before I go to sleep that guides you through the exercises and meditation.

So far my mind has felt clearer and I feel like stress just rolls off of me.  Highly recommended, even if you have done meditation before.",1271462400,19,654,4.491525423728813
8390891,5,B0037ZAKDM,"Just saw this listed on Amazon.  I already own a copy.  The title is Irish Gaelic and pronounced ""airu olas.""  It's a deep-breathing technique that systematically oxygenates the body and relieves stress at the same time.  Interestingly, you can use it either to relax and get to sleep, or to energize yourself for the day.  The difference in the way you feel is obvious after the first session, and it changes over time.  Deep breathing is really important, good stuff for general health and mental well-being, too.",1265760000,25,515,4.862068965517241
