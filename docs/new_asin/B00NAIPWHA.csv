8676774,5,B00NAIPWHA,"Loved this DVD.  It had such an old school look to it.  It felt like something you would watch on the Discovery Channel from the 50's..  The photography was spectacular.  The colors of the plants, flowers and bees were something to behold.  Also the pictures of the countryside made me homesick for my native Minnesota. Really, really informative.  Especially now that the entire nation is suffering from a die off of honey bees that they can't explain.  Well worth the money.",1489795200,,476,4.802469135802469

8676776,5,B00NAIPWHA,"The World of Bees holds a message for all of us. I grew up on a Minnesota farm ten miles from Charlie Hofmanns bee farm and bees were an inherent part of my world. Always there, always working. Never asking anything of me. For a time, a swarm of bees found a temporary home in the eaves of our house. For many years, we allowed a bee-keeper to put his hives on our farm, so his bees could feed on our clover. Aside from that, however, I took bees for granted  just as people still do. Although we valued their role in pollinating crops, we didn't think about them. Until now, that is. Charlie Hofmann took his photos and made his recording at a time when the life of bees seemed secure. We know that is no longer true. There are many reasons to watch The World of Bees because it goes to our world and what is or may not be on our plates. This story has many virtues  good information told simply  but it is free of rants, finger pointing, and blaming that attends so many earnest endeavors today. Charlie simply wanted you to understand what bees do. If we are lucky, we will understand this in time. If we dont, we will live a line from Joni Mitchells famous Big Yellow Taxi  you know what youve got till its gone. Thanks to Charlie Hofmann, we know what we had, still have, and can keep, if we try. This rates Five Stars.",1431216000,,1324,4.200787401574803
8676777,5,B00NAIPWHA,"After all the news coverage about bees being killed by pesticides, I decided to learn more about them and purchased The World of Bees video.  I am not a beekeeper, and have only a superficial knowledge about them, but this video gave me a good basic understanding of these vital pollinators.

The video features superb photographs by a beekeeper who was an educator his entire adult life; he also narrates the video.  The narrative is engaging, sometimes humorous, and informative and gives a very good basic understanding of bees, their life cycle and what is involved in beekeeping.  The video covers not only bees and their hives, but also a fair amount of botany and how the honey is produced.

The video's underlying piano score adds a feeling of serene beauty to the production.

I strongly recommend this video as a educational tool for anyone interested in learning more about bees, and I am convinced that children will find it interesting as well.",1426032000,,957,4.840490797546012
