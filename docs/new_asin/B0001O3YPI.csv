2021425,1,B0001O3YPI,"Warner Bros...  WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?  Do you realize how frustrating it is to only get a few episodes here and there and not the whole season?  And what a ripoff this ""collection"" is. I suppose the other short DVDs are geared more for small kids but how about us big kids?  Get with the program people.  Shame on you WB.  Release full seasons NOW and ditch these money grubbing tactics, you greedy people.",1098835200,17,408,4.373333333333333
2021426,1,B0001O3YPI,Fans wants SEASON BOX SETS now! Stop playing with us and making more $ at our expenses....bring out SEASON BOX SETS NOW! This 3 DVD Pack a.k.a JUSTICE LEAGUE COLLECTION are the 3 first single DVDs releases in 1!!!! No way! How can you call it a JL COLLECTION?? OMG! WARNER BROS. PLEASE LISTEN TO THE FANS FOR GOD'S SAKE.,1096502400,18,320,4.35
2021427,2,B0001O3YPI,"Real collectors want the complete season, not just a few episodes that are going to be included in the complete season anyway!! Its also overpriced considering what you're getting.

 I'm in total agreement with the majority of fans of Batman Animated, Justice League, etc.. when say how i'm dissapointed with the DVD offerings that Warner is releasing and which they are not releasing.

 I am speaking for more then myself when I say there is demand for the complete first season in a boxed set just like was recently released with Batman Animated Vol 1. Warner, stop trying to get us to buy the same ""collection"" or episodes twice. I vote to not buy these incomplete collections and wait for the real complete season sets.",1091404800,147,723,4.76
2021428,1,B0001O3YPI,"Like many here, as an avid DVD consumer I strongly object to the current methodology of WB in their DVD release program.  You have issued several Batman: Animated episodes on their own stand alone DVDs and then you followed this with a volume one incorporating those episodes. Do you really expect anyone to fall for this twice with your Justice League release.  This is an excellent show and the fans do want to have this for their permanent collections, so lets not take advantage of them hmm?  J.L. Unlimited started this evening, so isn't this maybe a good time to release season one?

I could be wrong now...but I don't think so.",1091232000,57,634,4.633928571428571
2021429,1,B0001O3YPI,"If you are going to spend this much on Justice League DVDs, then you must like the show quite a bit. And if that's the case, why buy such a slipshod release? You might as well wait a short while before they finally start releasing seasons - which they have finally done with Batman: The Animated Series and Superfriends.",1090540800,40,320,4.440677966101695
2021430,3,B0001O3YPI,"It is completely mind boggling as to why Warner isn't doing the simplest little things.  Every fan has the same complaints, no widescreen, not a complete season, no significant extras of any kind.  These are the simple expectations of every modern DVD release.  Simple expectations.
Warner, your marketing department, simply, isn't doing their job.",1089158400,32,348,5.407407407407407
2021431,4,B0001O3YPI,"This DVD is a re-packaging of the three previously released Justice League DVDs.  It contains ""Secret Origins,"" ""Paradise Lost,"" and ""Justice on Trial.""
The animated versions of superhero cartoons just keep getting better and better.  This DVD is being released just as Justice League season 2 is ending.  The quality of the Justice League series is unquestionably excellent.  This show is better than and builds upon the foundation created in the individual Batman and Superman animated TV shows.  If regular comic books looked this good and were written this well, the industry would not be in such disarray.  This is the show we want.  We want that beautiful artwork (animation) and we want every story to be Alan Moore quality.  Justice League comes closer to the model than anything we've seen so far.
However, the people who create and market the DVDs are targeting the wrong audience -- again.  It seems to me that they expect this to be purchased by parents of small children to watch over and over with Scooby Doo and Elmo.  These videos will appeal to the 8-12 year old comic book reader just a little.  But it seems like the core audience for the show on DVD is adults, especially the baby boomers who grew up with these characters and enjoy them.  The versions of the characters in Justice League are fully developed and consistant with all the comic lore we know and love.  I think that's who would buy the DVD box sets.  I always buy the good box sets just to encourage their creation.
But, we didn't get a nice box set here.  Much like the Batman animated series, we're getting a few individual episodes.  For this reason, I'm urging people to hold out on this one.  Maybe the marketers will listen to fan reaction and package and release this show in a proper box set format.  Season 1 & 2 of Justice League in 16x9 widescreen would be purchased by every fan with an HDTV.  A good example is the recent MTV Spider-man box set - mastered in HDTV - complete - high quality with entertaining commentary for each episode.
These sporadic releases are just wrong.  The marketing strategy is wrong.
The material is great and worth the 4 stars.  However, the best material is missing!  There was some great stuff in season 1, i.e., ""Savage Time""; ""A Knight of Shadows,"" and can you ask for a better script than season 2's ""A Better World""?  The upcoming Justice League Unlimited looks even better if that's even possible.
Message to Justice League creators: Outstanding Job.  You've met or exceeded my expectations in every respect.  Keep it up.  You are nailing this material.
Message to DVD packagers and marketers: Do your market research.  You don't know your market for these DVDs.  You've made an error that will cost you a lot of sales.  You've screwed up releasing it in this manner.  Knock it off.  Do it right as the creators did and the sales will naturally follow.",1086220800,194,2884,4.673956262425447

8015490,1,B0001O3YPI,"Once again, corporate america is attempting to gouge our pockets (and our common sense) with this junk offering. I am a die-hard JLA fan but I refuse to give in to this DVD piracy. This is classic carrot-and-stick. Once they've exhausted these copies MAYBE they'll finally start offering complete seasons. Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage.

Real JLA fans will protest and fight this injustice.",1143158400,12,408,5.0
8015491,1,B0001O3YPI,"As a 56 year old JLA collector (completist) with every JLA comic ever printed, bought from the stands, AND a masive collection of JLA related items, I thought this was going to be THE video collection to have. IT ISN'T. READ THE OTHER REVIEWS!

What WE all want is ""JLA Season 1""; JLA Season 2"" etc. NOT some jumbled mixture of some of the episodes while missing others. If WB wants MY money, they will do like they have done for Smallville, and release each season, in a COMPLETE collection with EVERY episode, in the order of their TV showing.

Don't waste you money on this, no matter HOW good the video is. If it isn't complete, you will just have to buy more later and waste your money on duplicated episodes.",1129766400,35,714,4.401515151515151
8015492,1,B0001O3YPI,A few years ago I purchased B:TAS VHS tapes.  Then I purchased the DVDs.  Then I purchased the collected box sets.  Don't make the same mistake I did.  I was lucky enough to sell my double copies however I still lost plenty of money.  Warner will release a complete season box set or else people will illegally make their own by downloading them or getting them off the black market. Warner will be extremely niave to let this happen.  Be patient wait for the season box sets.,1123545600,34,476,4.413793103448276
8015493,1,B0001O3YPI,"It's a rip-off, selling the episodes three at a time and at inflated prices. Insert sermon on the disintegration of integrity and mankind's slide into a moral abyss sticky with ignoble motivation and short-sighted thinking. Phooey.

The show itself was very good, the writing transending the level of many TV shows and movies. Fun for us boomers who grew up with stuff like this, filled with messages of hope and basic humanitarian values, not the holier than thou hypocrisy that passes for ""moral values"" today.",1111363200,18,512,5.023529411764706
8015494,1,B0001O3YPI,"It's an understatement that many of us feel ripped off by WB's attempt to unfairly empty our wallets. If we refuse to buy these horribly priced episode dvds and at the same time purchase the available full season box sets that are of value then we can make some headway. They are in the business of making $$$. Slowing their cash flow will force them to give us consumers' products we demand or risk losing our disposable income. Die-hard fans of this series and other series must convince every parent to withhold from purchasing these dvds until full seasons are made available. C'mon WB, we love these shows and will pay for them. We only ask that you don't rape our wallets. Give us the full season box sets much sooner.",1110412800,21,724,4.534351145038168
8015495,1,B0001O3YPI,"Warner Brothers does not seem to understand the loyalty of its genre audiences.  There are two seasons of Batman: The Animated Series to be available soon and the first season of Superman: The Animated Series is on its way as well.  Justice League was something its potential audience waited for with bated breath--it doesn't make any sense to not give it the same treatment.  Give us ALL the episodes of the seasons in a box set like the others.  I would skip out on these paltry offerings, and it seems that the same thing is going to occur with JL Unlimited, so I'll skip out on those as well and wait for the box sets.",1106006400,17,622,4.3826086956521735
8015496,1,B0001O3YPI,"""Justice On Trial"" is not fit for kids under the age of 12 and it is a pathetic, crying shame.  There is a scene in this movie in which a hit-man basically offers to have sex with Wonder Woman in order to divulge information about his employer.  I could not believe what my eyes and ears were taking in. How do you explain this to your 4-year old little girl or boy watching? Kids always ask questions about what they don't understand.  Where were your editors Warner Brothers???? Why can't these guys making super-hero films just make clean, action-packed, well-scripted material. For some reason they think they need to add some rough edges, innapropriate behavior or language and they think they are making it cool for older kids and adults?  Older kids and adults need to grow up and stop watching cartoons and leave the cartoons for the kids.  There are enough movies and programs for adults! Let's let the kids be kids, shall we?  All Warner Brothers is doing is alienating their product from any self-respecting parent with half a brain.  The old Super Friends DVD's are much better.",1104451200,9,1090,4.705263157894737
8015497,1,B0001O3YPI,"I agree with all the reviewers here.  So I won't repeat what they said.  Because of this, I have been going to eBay for complete season sets at reasonable prices.  Wake up Warner Brothers!",1101600000,11,188,4.470588235294118
8015498,1,B0001O3YPI,"Lets face it. Most of us love the Batman, Superman and the Justice League and would pay the money for the boxed sets so you could sit and watch a good quality show. However they put out a Justice League DVD every blue moon making you jump at the chance to buy it when you see it out on the shelves. Then later you release another and so on. Then you release a ""collection"" of maybe three in a set. Come on!!! You know a vast majority of people would buy the Justice League Season 1 & 2 etc.. straight out or Superman or Batman. We have been loyal fans. Release the complete seasons on boxed sets. Thanks Mike",1099612800,12,608,4.117647058823529
