8467519,5,B005DTZXFU,"For those interested in learning about some fascinating history of the amazing Death Valley territory, Ted Faye's Tales from Death Valley will keep you well entertained, while educating you in the process. I have spent a lifetime exploring this remote portion of the Mojave Desert, and was fortunate enough to meet Ted in 2009 at the 60th annual Death Valley 49ers Encampment. He and I were both presenters during the week-long annual event (I am the author of the Death Valley Book Of Knowledge, a huge compendium of regional history and lore). Ted Faye shares my enduring enthusiasm for Death Valley and its strange allure, and his passion clearly shows in these excellent tales of the region. From factually fascinating histories of the twenty mule team and early railroads, to mythologically mystifying speculations of giant cannibals living underground in the mountains, there is a lot to like in Ted's captivating telling of tales. This is a five disc set, so you will have many hours worth of enjoyment. Ted knows his stuff, both true and weird, and presents this knowledge in an entertaining manner. Live the mystery of Death Valley through his presentations.",1433548800,2,1167,5.051813471502591

My boys watched it on the way to our vacation in Death Valley and it really enhanced the experience because we learned so much about the history and people that made Death Valley what it is today.  The video is very entertaining and we often re-watched a segment after we had visited a related area.  We watched it again a couple of weeks after we got home with the director's commentary turned on, which added yet another layer that was worth experiencing.  One of my boys used it as reference material when doing a report for school.  It is obvious that a great deal of research, time and effort went into the production of this piece and the attention to detail makes the history, people and places seem more ""real"" and alive.  While the incongruous segment about aliens and hollowed out mountains with lost cities can (and probably should) be skipped without any loss, the rest of the video series was well worth it and definitely made our vacation in Death Valley more complete.",1360540800,,1067,4.619047619047619
