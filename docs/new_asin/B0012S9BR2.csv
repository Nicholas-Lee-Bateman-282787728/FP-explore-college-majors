This is an honest record of a woman, Dorothy Izatt that is capturing amazing footage from the skies. The amount of film reels she has recorded is baffling and almost impossible to fake without spending hundreds of thousands of computer generated work to replicate any of it, much less the thousands of feet that she has recorded.

3098686,5,B0012S9BR2,"I saw this film too and I couldn't disagree more with Elena's review. In fact I think Elana may be slightly, well, lets just say not the sharpest tool in the shed.

The film is an amazing testimony of contact, and without a doubt, Dorothy has accumulated the most supportive body of evidence than any one individual has on the planet. You need to watch the film again Elena because you failed to mention that the filmmakers cover the fact that Dorothy's camera WAS thoroughly examined and taken apart by an expert (how'd you miss that?!) The film also covered that Dorothy was given 3 different cameras and got the same results on all three of them. How do you explain that? Oh right, you didn't because that'd blow your whole theory out of the water. So if you think the flashes are due to a camera fault of the shutter being ""propped"" or ""stuck"" (with such consistent precision for 30 plus years nonetheless, lol) then your ""professional STILL photographer"" friend (wedding photographer does not make one a professional photographer btw) has little or no understanding of how MOVING film works.  You really think that that possibility escaped all the people ever involved in this case including a world renowned physicist and astronomist?! A faulty camera?! C'mon! A faulty camera could not produce those results on a single frame, there would be light on several and/or dozens of frames.

Another thing that floors me about Elena's review is how she says the filmmakers put this meaning or that meaning on things... well probably one of the best things I enjoyed about the film, next to the footage, is how there is no slant from the filmmakers. It was probably the most unbiased UFO film I've ever seen! They just let the people in the film tell the story! Did we watch the same film Elana?!!

Search the web for more in-depth discussions and reviews about Dorothy's films rather than relying on Elena's selective memory and her bone-headed amateur photographer friend. This film, at the very least, is the best contactee story out there, bar none. And for me, there tons of the best proof I've ever seen IMHO.",1205452800,17,2114,4.736413043478261
3098687,2,B0012S9BR2,"After reviewing the footage on this video with a professional photographer, it is clear that much of the hype about this video comes from  prolonged exposures due to a stuck shutter or a propped open shutter taking streaked picures of lights in the dark. The film maker  ascribes special meaning to these single frame flashes or squiggles which result from the prolonged exposure of quite possibly real UFO sightings.

Another problem with the film was that the film maker believed that lens reflection artifacts are some sort of orbs of energy. The timing of the ""orbs"" and the interviewee's eyes blinking was an impressive coincidence however.

I can't address the veracity of Dorothy Izatt who seems to be a very nice lady, but if you look at the multiple duplicated parallel streaks, it is clear this is due to camera motion while the shutter is open.  There is a particularly suspcious frame where the camera was moved over lights, spelling out ""Dorothy"" in cursive.  Clearly this couldn't have been done in 1/20 of a second and it is hard to understand how Dorothy couldn't notice the change in shutter rhythm when the shutter clicks out of rhythm.  Also, it is hard to understand how the film maker doesn't recognize prolonged exposure when he sees it.

This all is unfortunate because there IS some interesting footage worth seeing...just not enough to justify this whole film.

This aside, there is some very interesting UFO footage of crafts (collections of lights moving together as if from a craft) that was very exciting if you want to know what a UFO sighting looks like.  I am inclined to believe that these sightings are real just because a close relative of mine witnessed two UFO sightings along with thousands of folks in the same overseas cities.

The fact that the film crew of this movie accidently captured some difficult to explain footage during an interview helps the veracity of this case despite the problem with the stuck shutter misleading frames.

One light was filmed through a window behind an ongoing interview, then moved laterally across the open window, and was filmed through the screen, (ruling out reflections).

All in all this was a disappointing film making much amazement out of almost nothing.

Also, and totally without comment , was the interview with Dorothy ( at about 21 minutes left) and a ""face"", alien looking, in the background that just kind of moved around, take note of it.

Though it was a bit short and could have had more content, especially regarding the 30,000 feet worth of 8mm film that has been filmed showing multiple messages and actions that the ""light beings"" have performed for the purpose of being filmed and transmitting data.",1349049600,,308,5.0588235294117645
3098717,4,B0012S9BR2,"I had heard of Dorothy Izatt originally from an episode of Unsolved Mysteries. It was an intriguing case, but I had forgotten about it until recently when I saw that this documentary had been made. Dorothy comes off as an amazing woman who truly believes in what she's filming, and that lends a ton of credibility to the believability aspect of it.
One of the great aspects of ""Capturing The Light"" is her family's involvement in it. They seem to be an average middle-class family, skeptical of the paranormal and definitely skeptical of ""aliens"" and such, but nevertheless open to the possibility. The moment in the filming where the film crew actually captures lights in the sky outside the kitchen window (while filming an interview with Dorothy's daughter) makes for an interesting reveal to the entire family. The feeling of true shock and confusion is portrayed eerily well by the filmmakers as members of the family discussed what they had just seen.
There is a moment in the film I didn't quite agree with. The family and others interviewed suggest that the ""orbs"" seen floating through the kitchen (while the lights were filmed outside in the background) could be some sort of alien presence. ""Orbs"" are a subject of constant debate in the paranormal community, and it is my firm belief that 99% of the time they are nothing  more than dust or bugs. I believe that to be the case here, although I do respect their beliefs and I acknowledge the fact that there is no way of proving this either way. Until we come up with a way of measuring or documenting an actual energy or presence within these ""orbs,"" I believe they cannot be looked at as solid evidence of paranormal activity. Nevertheless, it is laid out there in the film for you to draw your own conclusions.
Towards the end of the film, we are shown footage of an absolutely incredible occurrence. One of Dorothy's photographs of light is shown giving off brilliant flashes of light -as- it is being filmed. We are told of this by the filmmaker, and shown about five seconds of footage of it actually happening, but then left completely hanging as no more time is given to it. This is truly disappointing, because it looked amazing and it seemed to be something they could've really sunk their teeth into and tried to find an explanation for, or at the very least given us more documentation of it happening.
In the end, ""Capturing The Light"" is a must see film, and in my eyes it may be the best evidence presented in UFO history. Over 30 years and 30,000 feet of footage shot with different cameras doesn't lie. There is something there, and it's up to us to figure out exactly what it is. I can only hope that somebody is working on a follow-up with Dorothy and this evidence, as 46 minutes was not enough time to fully analyze and appreciate what she has given us.",1271721600,4,2835,4.6138613861386135

3333204,4,B0012S9BR2,"I thought this video was well done, perhaps a bit more footage of actual Ufo/Aliens if possible but overall the way it was presented was pretty convincing, certainly there is no doubt of her sincerity and the camera footage has been verified. The interview with her sister(?) was astounding, I immediately noticed the bright object moving around in the background. Also, and totally without comment , was the interview with Dorothy ( at about 21 minutes left) and a ""face"", alien looking, in the background that just kind of moved around, take note of it. I read the book so am a total believer in her and their is no doubt a considerable alien (non human intelliegence) presence in our world. I recommend this video, rent it !!!",1419292800,2,729,4.703125

3333206,4,B0012S9BR2,"The woman featured in the movie is very charming, sincere, intelligent woman. I found her to be beyond reproach. Something happens during the filming (I don't want to spoil it if you haven't seen it) which makes this one of the most compelling documentaries on the UFO topic ever filmed. Mind blowing stuff. For any UFO buff this is a must see!  For any skeptical but curious person, if you have any open-mindedness whatsoever, you will at least open up to the possibility that we are being visited.

Fascinating and I think she is telling the truth.  If the Universe is empty, it sure seems like an awful waste of space.  Review is 8 out of 10 stars. Enjoy!  I sure did.

3333213,5,B0012S9BR2,"Very great documentary about the unknown. Though it was a bit short and could have had more content, especially regarding the 30,000 feet worth of 8mm film that has been filmed showing multiple messages and actions that the ""light beings"" have performed for the purpose of being filmed and transmitting data.",1349049600,,308,5.0588235294117645
3333214,4,B0012S9BR2,"I had heard of Dorothy Izatt originally from an episode of Unsolved Mysteries. It was an intriguing case, but I had forgotten about it until recently when I saw that this documentary had been made. Dorothy comes off as an amazing woman who truly believes in what she's filming, and that lends a ton of credibility to the believability aspect of it.
One of the great aspects of ""Capturing The Light"" is her family's involvement in it. They seem to be an average middle-class family, skeptical of the paranormal and definitely skeptical of ""aliens"" and such, but nevertheless open to the possibility. The moment in the filming where the film crew actually captures lights in the sky outside the kitchen window (while filming an interview with Dorothy's daughter) makes for an interesting reveal to the entire family. The feeling of true shock and confusion is portrayed eerily well by the filmmakers as members of the family discussed what they had just seen.
There is a moment in the film I didn't quite agree with. The family and others interviewed suggest that the ""orbs"" seen floating through the kitchen (while the lights were filmed outside in the background) could be some sort of alien presence. ""Orbs"" are a subject of constant debate in the paranormal community, and it is my firm belief that 99% of the time they are nothing  more than dust or bugs. I believe that to be the case here, although I do respect their beliefs and I acknowledge the fact that there is no way of proving this either way. Until we come up with a way of measuring or documenting an actual energy or presence within these ""orbs,"" I believe they cannot be looked at as solid evidence of paranormal activity. Nevertheless, it is laid out there in the film for you to draw your own conclusions.
Towards the end of the film, we are shown footage of an absolutely incredible occurrence. One of Dorothy's photographs of light is shown giving off brilliant flashes of light -as- it is being filmed. We are told of this by the filmmaker, and shown about five seconds of footage of it actually happening, but then left completely hanging as no more time is given to it. This is truly disappointing, because it looked amazing and it seemed to be something they could've really sunk their teeth into and tried to find an explanation for, or at the very least given us more documentation of it happening.
In the end, ""Capturing The Light"" is a must see film, and in my eyes it may be the best evidence presented in UFO history. Over 30 years and 30,000 feet of footage shot with different cameras doesn't lie. There is something there, and it's up to us to figure out exactly what it is. I can only hope that somebody is working on a follow-up with Dorothy and this evidence, as 46 minutes was not enough time to fully analyze and appreciate what she has given us.",1271721600,4,2835,4.6138613861386135
