8059185,4,B0009DY5HW,"The ""Church in the Wildwood Video Concert"" is filmed in the chapel at the Cove, The Billy Graham Training Center in Ashville, Nor Carolina. The concert is filled with well known cherished hymns sung by the Homecoming Friends.

The program includes familiar favorites including: Revive us Again, On the Jericho Road, Everybody Ought to Know, Heavenly Sunshine, Further Along, and The Church in the Wildwood.

Some personal favorites include: ""God of the Mountain"" featuring Lynda Randle, ""I Am Bound for the Promised Land,"" and ""Will There Be Any Stars in My Crown"" featuring the Homecoming Friends.

Other featured artists include: Squire Parsons, Allison Speer, Steve Amerson, and Stephen Hill.

Bill Gaither conducted and inspiring and informative interview with Franklin Graham on the background of the Chapel and the program of the Cove.

On a lighter side Buddy Greene was featured in an arrangement of Jonah and the Whale. I also enjoyed the story shared by Jim Hamill.

It is always a blessing to see out the Homecoming Friends interact with each other and of their appreciation for the musical gifts and ministries of their peer's performances.

Great music, inspiring worship, and meaningful entertainment.",1315872000,,1215,5.2642487046632125
