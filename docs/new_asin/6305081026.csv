965014,5,6305081026,"This DVD is worth the price alone to hear the guys put together(off the cuff) background harmonies for the classic Caroline No, which was originally released with only Brians lead vocal.  Priceless!!  Al Jardines son honorably provides the old Brian falsetto on a few songs.  I wish it would have focused more on just the Boys but man can these guys still harmonize....  Check it out, now!!",1064275200,6,390,4.776119402985074
965015,5,6305081026,"I purchased this DVD for one song / video ... ""I Can Hear Music"" by Kathy Troccoli with the Beach Boys on harmony.  Absolutely terrific and flawlessly performed.
But I found that I really enjoyed several of the remakes by other stars.  I'll list my favorites.  ""Little Deuce Coupe"" remade by James House.  This guy is a crackup and a great singer with a rock-a-billy style.  ""Caroline, No"" really explores Timothy B. Schmit's wonderful voice.  I really enjoyed Timothy from the days he sang ""I Can't Tell You Why"" with the Eagles.
Junior Brown gives a rendition of ""409"" that's just great.  While I still prefer the original, I like the different spin Junior put on it.  ""Long Tall Texan"" is great as done by Doug Supernaw.  And the tongue-in-cheek music video with Supernaw on a burro wearing a carnival sombrero is flat hilarious.  You will laugh!
Next, ""Be True to Your School"" by Toby Keith is probably the best remake of this song I've heard.  Very energetic and upbeat.
Finally, ""I Can Hear Music"" by the lovely and talented Kathy Troccoli.  If you haven't heard Kathy do this song, do yourself a favor and buy the DVD right now!  Kathy has done work with Taylor Dane and recorded Dianne Warren songs and is one of my favorite Christian singers (check out Kathy Troccoli's ""K.T."", IMHO, her finest compilation).
Watching the DVD, you can tell all the performers had a lot of fun working on this project.  There is also some footage of a live music festival at the very end.  Great entertainment!
one note: Widescreen might have been a good option in addition.",1059350400,7,1565,4.660583941605839
965016,5,6305081026,"Ladies and Gents...to think I almost passed on this DVD because of the few less-than fully enthusiatic reviews (the idea of Mike Love giving ""phrasing"" suggestions to Willie Nelson as described in one review nearly turned me away by itself). I buy a lot of music DVD's, and too many are disappointing, to be sure. But this one is outstanding. The quality of the sound, the excellent harmonizing, the history: put this one on to lift your spirits, enlighten young people, or impress visiting dignitaries. You will be pleased. As another reviewer implied, Junior Brown's treatment of ""409"" is worth the price of admission alone.( And the Mike Love/Willie Nelson ""discussion"" is not nearly the put-off as it might sound in this forum). You will certainly watch this one many many times.",1048896000,12,783,4.9393939393939394
965017,5,6305081026,"After renting this disc, I decided that I wanted to add it to my personal collection.  Imagine my shock when viewing the disc that I purchased (from another online site) titled simply ""Nashville Sounds"" that did not include the Tammy Wynette (""In My Room"") or the Fan Fair in-concert version of ""Barbara Ann.""  Though I can personally do without the Tammy Wynette tune, I do miss not having the ""Barbara Ann"" segment that included a large number of the artists featured in the other individual segments.  The one listed here on Amazon appears to be the longer, more complete one so I would advise anyone interested in purchasing this disc to do so here, rather than by trying to save a couple of bucks by buying it elsewhere.",1048809600,3,725,4.6484375
965018,5,6305081026,"On this DVD you will hear why The Beach Boys are the best harmony band of ALL time. Backstreet b, -N-stink cannot hold a candle to The Beach Boys. Brian Wilson is a rare talent who can play, sing, arrange vocals, write and arrange music. The Beach Boys have probably put out the most diverse music of all time in their long careers. Lets see where all the other boy bands are in a few years. It takes talent to achieve long lasting fame!",1015891200,10,437,4.214285714285714
965019,4,6305081026,"Probably the last time you will see Brian, Carl, Al, Mike,and Bruce recording and performing together.  Rodney Crowell's Sail on Sailor and Tammy Wynette's In My Room are added bonuses.  Directors Alan Boyd and  Steve Monroe capture the mood of the band's recording in 1996.  Excellent  sound and video footage of them in the studio and at Fan Fair 1996 in  Nashville.",948844800,16,368,4.854838709677419

7882891,5,6305081026,"My only dissappointment about this version of the Stars & Stripes DVD is that it excluded Tammy Wynnette's version of In My Room. But being that i'm not a huge fan of mainstream country music, this DVD actually exceeded my expectations and turned me on to a few country acts I didn't even know about, but plan to get more music from to add to my collection (ie Junior Brown).The highlights for me are Junior Brown's 409, Sawyer Brown doing I Get Around, James House doing Little Deuce Coupe, Lorrie Morgan doing Don't Worry Baby, Kathy Troccoli doing I Can Hear Music, and one of my favorites was Eagles' Timothy B Schmitt doing Caroline No. This is one of my Beach Boys related DVD's that i watch frequently.",1401667200,,709,4.546875
7882892,5,6305081026,"I truely enjoy the C.D. created. I was hoping this product would be a DVD audio recording of the songs. It is that...except conversation is part of every song. Otherwise,this is a very good program.

7882893,5,6305081026,"This is a unique interpretation of the Beach Boy's music. I particularly liked Lorrie Morgan, Willie Nelson and KathyTrocolli.
The other artists were equally as good with their interpretation of classic Beach Boys songs. This DVD is a must for the lovers of Beach. Boys and Country Music!",1330905600,,288,5.020833333333333
7882894,5,6305081026,"I loved the DVD. Been looking for it for years. I bought the CD when it first came out and saw some of the video on our local cable channel a short time later, but could never get a hold of the DVD until now. As far as I am concerned, no one can  measure up to the Beach Boys for their strong harmonies, but it was a nice touch having country western people singing the lead on those songs, with the great Beach Boy harmonies in the background. I think they had planned a Part 2 CD but then Carl Wilson passed away and the remaining Beach Boys kind of fell apart.
I grew up with the Beach Boys and it brought tears to my eyes listening to this album and then finally getting to watch the DVD. Super glad I found the DVD available on amazon.com, and to me, well worth the price.",1290902400,,777,4.012903225806451
7882895,5,6305081026,"I have been looking for the 'out-of-print' Beach Boys Nashville Sounds for a while now.  I finally did what I should have done a long time ago.  I went to Amazon.  Their reseller had the 'Like New' item in stock.  It may have been used, but you would have not know it by the condition.  It arrived very quickly and in great condition.  The DVD was even packaged as new.  Great reseller.  I would use them again.",1261958400,,411,4.246753246753247

7882897,4,6305081026,"I can't believe the review above dismises Lorrie Morgan's ""Don't Worry Baby"" as cheerleader-peppy. This song is haunting. It's a nice twist to have this song sung from a woman's point go view, and with a woman's voice replacing the falsetto.

All in all a pretty entertaining CD - except for the concert footage which is a bit boring.",1094947200,4,334,4.661016949152542
