4082621,4,B00382S9MS,"This movie is defiantly worth checking out. Flannery and Pantoliaon work well together. Suspense through the whole movie, and a killer ending.",1271289600,2,142,5.5
4082622,5,B00382S9MS,"I don't want to write anything that will spoil this fine feature for movie-goers, so I'll keep it as generic as I can: If you are a fan of action/suspense movies like The Bourne Identity, Die Hard, or Lethal Weapon, grab some popcorn and watch Robert Kurtzman's DEADLY IMPACT. Pitted against a criminal mastermind (Joe Pantoliano) are a psychologically wounded cop (Sean Patrick Flanery) and a fiery Latina FBI Agent (Carmen Serano). If you like fast, well-choreographed, visually stimulating action movies, Deadly Impact really delivers. Veteran horror film-maker Kurtzman knows how to get the most from his actors, and Flanery, Serano, and Pantoliano prove this as Kurtzman jumps into the action/suspense world in a very big way, making Alexander Vesha's story a movie-screen roller-coaster you won't want to miss.",1271030400,12,816,5.333333333333333

4082645,5,B00382S9MS,Great movie.,1446249600,,12,5.5
4082646,1,B00382S9MS,"This movie is 99% suspense music and the remaining 1% is bad acting, bad writing, and bad action.  And don't forget bad cinematography.  I hope Joe Pantoliano got paid up front, in cash or gold bouillon when he took this role. As a veteran actor,  he does the most legitimate acting in the entire film and he probably only needed to look at the script once. Completely predictable if not a total clich of a movie.  This is the kind of crap we get for an Amazon Prime membership?",1446249600,,478,4.337078651685394

4082653,3,B00382S9MS,so so movie.,1445558400,,12,3.3333333333333335
4082654,3,B00382S9MS,This is a B film with repeated foolish acts on behalf of the police that would not appear in better films. The acting is also sometimes heavy handed. A police officer is forced to either kill his wife or ten people will die. He kills his wife. He resigns from the force but he is persuade to return because it is felt that he knows the criminal better than anyone else. The film is filled with action and with the criminal repeatedly tricking the police and killing many people.,1445472000,,478,4.382022471910112

4082693,2,B00382S9MS,This movie came close enough to being a 3 so that I didn't feel completely guilty about watching it.

As much as I want tell you about the movie I can't because you must see and follow the story to the conclusion. The special effects were very good for I think this was a  TV movie released in 2008. The acting was good for the most part, you could tell at times which actors and actresses where  still learning their trade craft but that did never slow down the theme or explosions and mayhem through out the film. Both a fun and heart stopping story that builds and builds to the final scenes and how the good guys saved the day.",1437782400,,648,4.260162601626016

This douche is supposed to be a good technician but the ""agents"" continue UNDERESTIMATING him, treating him as a criminal with room temperature IQ!

The story line is predictable, and the acting is fair. The most suspenseful scene was at the start of the movie and it was followed up by other interesting situations.

4082950,3,B00382S9MS,It was an action film and had a good plot. You did not figure out some of the exciting twist and turns. Older movie so it was hard to keep up due to thinking why not? When why not was because technology was not invented when the movie was made.,1401148800,,244,3.9

4082964,2,B00382S9MS,Plot good - acting bad. The female lead was about the same caliber actress as an 80's porn star. Only reason I didn't turn it off was because i kept hoping it would get better. Too bad it didn't.,1395792000,,195,4.0256410256410255

I got tired of watching Pantolino beating Flannery up and decided after fast forwarding and doing other things including games with sound in the background, that this film is a real bummer and not worth the time watching it!

His review is titled ""The FBI should hate this"" which is the only thing I disagree with~ I think there's plenty here for EVERYONE to hate (not just the FBI.) Seriously, though, this movie actually gives ""Invasion: Earth"" a run for its money when it comes to absurdly inept ""good guys.""

Most people that watch movies will only except a certain level of realism, stupid errors from trained professionals, clumsy behavior, reasonable fighting skills, and basic commonsense. I wasn't convinced that anyone at the level of FBI law enforcement would be trained to respond to situations in the manner portrayed in this movie. I can't be convinced that one villain has the resources, intelligence, fighting skills, stealth behavior, mobile tracing ability, and other electronic expert skills to outsmart a top law enforcement agency.

4082989,3,B00382S9MS,"Fair movie. I was entertained for an hour and a half. Same worn out plot with a few new twists.
I really get tired of movies that can't/don't cast correct age characters. When the lead charter is supposed to have twenty years experience, it is hard to relate to twenty year old actor. But at least this time they didn't make him a drunk.

I am a fan of Joey Pants and the movie had a fairly high rating (???) that's the reason I watched this silly movie. The concept was okay and might have made a decent movie, but it went bad from the beginning. A local Albuquerque cop is on the trail of an international assassin/terrorist called the Lion, not the CIA or NSA or Homeland security or the FBI, but a local ALBUQUERQUE cop! ???? I could go on about the supposed 8 year bender in Mexico this cop has been on after being forced to shoot his own wife, but amazingly is in good shape and looks just like he did at the beginning of the movie. Or how about the sexy and beautiful Latino FBI agent who makes one stupid move after another. Or how the drunk and damaged cop is not only recruited by the FBI to help get the Lion because, (""He knows the terrorist better than anyone.""), but without being reinstated into the ALBUQUERQUE police force is some how still a cop and very quickly takes over the FBI and is running the show, because you know, the FBI always lets local cops, (or ex-cops), run their operations, NOT!

This entire lot has to be the most dim-witted ""intelligence"" officers I've ever seen portrayed in a crime movie.

Sorry -- be warned -- there are spoilers below -- but necessary to show how unintelligent these guys are:

- They repeatedly walk into buildings without checking -- knowing that they're chasing a guy who sets bombs.
- The female lead wanders off by herself after getting a tip about a secret warehouse.
- The male lead believes the villain when he says ""put down your gun and I won't shoot you...""
- They can't figure out why a guy who has blown up several other buildings has corralled all law enforcement into the same place.

4083033,4,B00382S9MS,"This is not a bad movie it's just a low budget (B) crime drama type movie.  The acting all around isn't bad but the story is kind of bleh or meh depending on how many of these you've seen and your standards.

You basically have the setup of a ""master assassin"" (albeit super sloppy assassin) reigning down his fury on law enforcement in some non-descript meh city (I believe it was albuquerque).  Hero (whom the master assassin hates for no valid reason (in my opinion) saves the day after lots of nonsensical drama and writing stupidity.  Pretty standard stuff for this genre.  Does the story make a whole lot of sense?  All around, not really, even for this genre of money.  It is watchable, not that enjoyable to watch but watchable.  4 stars only because they stretched the budget fairly well which kind of makes up for the stupidity of the story.

There is a warning though...the lead female is a distractingly ugly and bad actor (notice I said actor not actress).  Maybe it's the makeup (at least for the appearance) but...um...yeah.  I was about to toss chunks when hero and ""her"" got hot and heavy.  Might want to just fast forward through anything like that.",1362268800,,1167,4.611650485436893

I was enjoying this one until they had a character make the most dumb obvious rookie, stupid plot device possible. So for the last 20 minutes of the film I was not happy, especially when they had another character show up and be even dumber.

So I give it a two star for Sean but it really should be a half star because of that last 20 minutes!!!!",1342569600,16,488,3.9693877551020407

The villian was annoying as hades and the FBI agent girl he fell for even more annoying. I really wouldn't recommend this movie unless you're a diehard SPF fan like me because it really tanked otherwise. The whole thing was pretty painful. Can I have my money back?",1331078400,15,386,4.5285714285714285
4083040,2,B00382S9MS,"There's nothing much wrong with 2010s ""Deadly Impact"", but there's nothing much right with it either. This type of ""mad bomber vs. tough cop"" was covered in several films, the best including ""Ticker"" (2001) with Dennis Hopper as the mad bomber and Steven Segal as his bomb squad nemesis, and ""Blown Away"" (1994) with Tommy Lee Jones as the mad bomber and Jeff Bridges as his nemesis.

So why remake this type of film? Especially if you're going to cast Sean Patrick Flanery as the cop and Joe Pantoliano as the mad bomber. Pantoliano does a pretty good job, but he's not equal to Hopper or Jones, and Flanery is an even weaker link here. The only real treat is Carmen Serano who plays an FBI agent.

Don't get me wrong. I think Joe Pantoliano is an excellent character actor. He's given memorable performances in ""The Sopranos"", ""The Matrix"", ""Midnight Run"" and others, but his strength is in the character role, not as the leading villain.

Another problem with the film is the lagging direction from Robert Kurtzman. Kurtzman is a distinguished makeup and special effects man who transitioned to producing and directing. This was his 5th film, following ""The Rage"" (2007), ""Buried Alive"" (2007), ""Wishmaster"" (1997), and ""The Demolitionist"" (1995). Unfortunately the film drags, which is a real problem for an action thriller that already has several good films out there with nearly identical plots.

BTW - the makeup and special effects, especially Pantoliano's makeup and many disguises are quite good, as one might expect given Kurtzman's background.

Another problem comes with the script. There are several flaws, the most noteworthy coming at the very beginning of the film when Pantoliano instructs Flanery to turn out the lights and then fire a rifle, telling him that Pantoliano's cameras are equipped with night sensitive lenses. That may be true, but Flanery is being required to make a very difficult shot, and neither he nor his rifle are equipped with night vision, so once the lights are turned out, he is ""in the dark"", yet he makes this very difficult shot.

Bottom line - an OK B film, but there are far better out there with similar plots.",1318723200,6,2161,4.874659400544959

4083043,5,B00382S9MS,"Find a spot at the edge of your seat and get comfortable. ""Deadly Impact"" will have your stomach in knots within the first 10 minutes.

After mastermind assassin David Kaplow (Joe Pantoliano) proves the strength of his capabilities early on, there's little time to ask why, but rather when.

This highly suspenseful film is so captivating, the smallest disturbance will have you jumping.

Realistic but horrifying scenarios are so mind-boggling, audience members are left wondering how anyone could make the decisions police officer Tom Armstrong (Sean Patrick Flanery) faces, and survive.

Intense, non-stop action, a splash of romance and equipped with a satisfying ending, ""Deadly Impact"" is a flick for thrill seekers.

Written by Columbus native Alexander Vesha and directed by Robert Kurtzman of Precinct 13 Entertainment in Crestline, ""Deadly Impact"" makes the perfect flick for thrill seekers.",1271721600,3,901,5.5
