4902391,3,B005X7HAC6,I liked the experienced guide that took his group on tour. I would have enjoyed watching more side films of what he was teaching the group while out in the park instead of viewing him speaking to the group as much as was filmed. It was beautiful on blue ray when scenery and wildlife was shown.,1365033600,,294,4.267857142857143
4902392,5,B005X7HAC6,"I REALLY ENJOY THESE DOCUMENTARIES ABOUT OUR NATIONAL PARKS, ALTHOUGH THIS IS ABOUT AS CLOSE AS I'LL GET TO THEM, STILL I ENJOY ALL THE NATURAL WONDERS THAT GO ALONG WITH THEM. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL THE ADVENTUREST.",1338508800,,234,4.7317073170731705
4902393,5,B005X7HAC6,The Everglades National Park HD Blu-ray video is a quality presentation and is most enjoyable. The photography is beautiful and the naritive information proivided on the history of the park is very well done. I highly recommend it to those that have an interest in the National Parks and their history.,1336435200,,302,4.9411764705882355
4902394,3,B005X7HAC6,"The documentary is very good. It just buying. It's a good movie to collect.
The film with no pretensions. Soft and good for relaxing.
The images are beautiful, the soundtrack good. It's a good movie.
The only problem is that there is no legend in Portuguese and Spanish.",1336348800,,270,4.645833333333333

4902396,1,B005X7HAC6,"Having lived and worked in the Everglades National Park, I was really looking forward to having this BluRay.
Well, it was worse than awful.  Full of misinformation and really poorly done
The Everglades are a true jewel of nature, and were presented so poorly.  Never when I worked there would
I have treated the visitors the way they were treated in this film, and we never, never would have found it
necessary to carry ""learning or teaching aids.'  The Glades all by themselves are splendid and didn't need
anything other than a good Ranger/Naturalist to explain them.

There are enough errors in this film about an area which I know so well that it makes me wonder what is in its
sister films about which I know nothing that is also incorrect.

Really a terrible disappointment.",1333756800,17,780,4.705882352941177
4902397,5,B005X7HAC6,"I really enjoyed this nice, beautiful overview of the Everglades. And what a reasonable price! I hope they put out more of these.",1333152000,2,129,4.6521739130434785
4902398,2,B005X7HAC6,"I was fairly disappointed with this disc. Having visited Everglades National Park many times, I feel that it failed to capture the real beauty of the park. The presentation also contained errors such as showing images of a Tri-colored Heron, when talking about the Great Blue Heron, images of a Snowy Egret when taking about the Great White Heron, and an image of a Red-bellied Woodpecker, when talking about the Downy Woodpecker. These types of errors occur throughout the disc. It seems like the narration was recorded without regard for the video. Video quality is also not the best. The image lacks dynamic range and saturation as does the audio.",1328832000,60,650,4.918181818181818
8488357,1,B005X7HAC6,"This documentary is a major dud. The Everglades is my favorite National Park. I've been there hundreds of times and witnessed startling  beauty like nowhere else. This amateurish film misses all of that. From a park ranger who drones on and on from a memorized script to the lifeless,passionless narration -all worthless. For people wanting to visit the ""glades for the first time-this will turn them away,For those with a lifetime love affair of the park,this will have then groaning. That many species are mis-identified is unforgivable. I noticed a whole series of National Park Docs that I planned to watch. I've deletrd all of them. Where is Richard Attenborough when you need him ?",1529020800,,687,4.973913043478261

8488364,5,B005X7HAC6,It is a very well done video of the park.  It is divided into three parts .  Each section is chuck full of information.  The scenery filmed was great a great piece of work.  I lived Florida for 17 years.  I have been there. It's a great buy!,1378425600,,241,3.9375
8488365,5,B005X7HAC6,"Howdy;

As with the ""Great Smoky Mountains"" this is another in a great series for national park videos.

The narration and music are great and the interviews are most interesting.

Running time is 80 minutes.

Hope this helps out, L8R daze...",1378080000,,242,4.829268292682927
