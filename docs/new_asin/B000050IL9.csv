1385332,5,B000050IL9,"Sure, the plots are simplistic and the boobie-flashes are sophomoric.  But... really now... just what DID you expect?!?  It's damn good, mindless anime.  Throw it on at a party.  Your guest'll love it!",1214524800,,201,5.0
1385333,5,B000050IL9,"Boredom with endlessly repeating ""Crisis of infinite crossover twists"" and plots aimed at juveniles, I quickly grew disinterested with the ""Superhero"" genre.  I loved the 'deconstructionist' things, like ""Marshall Law"" and ""Watchmen""...

But this anime is just so good.  Cutey Honey is a true superhero, an endless, selfless crusader for justice who willingly fights to defend those around her but also needs them to believe in her.  My favorite scenes are the ""Burning up"" song intro from chapter 3, and then the fight on the bridge scene from ep 5.

Thanks to YouTube, I found out this was animated in the 70's, but not shown in the USA...  Thanks Disney...and public stereotyping of comics and cartoons as kids stuff only.",1205107200,,725,5.0
1385334,5,B000050IL9,"Back in the early 1970s, Go Nagai and the animators at Toei thought up Cutey Honey. Busty, bouncy, very pretty, violent, and often naked, Cutey Honey was one of the first world-famous magical girl superheroines. And American critics have had a field day ever since proclaiming that they of course are not fans of naked girl androids, and reassuring us - and anxious parents - that the plot is pretty silly, the animation hopelessly old-fashioned, the characterizations paper-thin, and the whole thing is really only a marginal show at the very best. And certainly NOT FOR KIDS! Well, I won't argue with people about it, but -- and there *is* a but.

If ""Cutey Honey"" is so bad,  why does it get all those 5-star reviews? Because ""Cutey Honey"" is thoroughly enjoyable. If you're old enough, you'll remember when movie theatres showed cartoons - Daffy Duck, for example - and they were simply entertaining. The episodes on these two DVDs are precisely that kind of cartoon. Heroic good guys! Evil bad guys! Funny grandpas! Gorgeous naked android girls! Lots and lots of them, in an unabashed celebration of a kind of animation that has become very rare today. Yet I have read reviews of ""Cutey Honey"" that solemnly tell us that the video transfer is really excellent. If you're watching ""Cutey Honey"" for its excellence of video transfer, maybe you should watch the test patterns instead, because ""Cutey Honey"" is not about excellence of video transfer. It's about Heroic Good Guys, Evil Villains, Funny Grandpas, and Naked Android Girls, all running around loose in a cartoon world without a shred of reality to it. The violence is about as serious as Coyote falling off a cliff, and if you're going to tell me that Mayor Light is ""unrealistic,"" maybe next you'll tell me that Bugs Bunny isn't a biological rabbit either.

""Spirited Away,"" ""Innosenzu,"" ""Ergo Proxy,"" and ""Akira"" this is not. ""Cutey Honey"" is a high-speed romp, a comedy done in the grand manner without any pretensions at all. If you like cackling villains with tattoos and blue eyebrows or if you like naked android girls who are the heroine, you will LOVE ""Cutey Honey."" And, if not, well, maybe you're missing something, or, if you're old enough, maybe you've forgotten something. Once, cartoons were fun. Nothing serious, no great messages, no philosophy, just fun. And ""Cutey Honey"" is pure entertainment. So sit back and enjoy it, and forget about the excellence of the video transfer. Very highly recommended.",1194393600,3,2482,4.918854415274463

Who ever said the sound quality was poor on this DVD was lying. I admit it isn't the best, but it wasn't the poorest either. I have heard much worse. Well, it is at least better in sound and picture quality than the VHS version, which is what you really want anyway. Overall, the anime series is hilarous and provides plenty of fan service, if you like that sort of thing, and a lot of action, and I don't mean of the fan service kind. If you were dissapointed in the quality of the VHS version, pick up this one, it is definately a step up. For those of you who like to see women in skippy outfits in serious cat fights, sexual hijinks and a heartwarming love story, screw the mushy stuff, pick it up for the cat fights and sexual hijinks. Honey Flash! Sorry, I just couldn't resist the temptation.",1191110400,,1017,5.16969696969697
1385336,4,B000050IL9,"I suppose it's odd that my first review should be about the sound quality of the DVD. After all, DVDs have stunning, digital mind bending sound right? Well, not in this case. There's plenty of music but the problem is the mix. Throughout the entire series the voices on the English tracks are buried in the background music and sound effects. I ended up putting the subtitles on as well and, interestingly enough, got very different dialog on some of the conversations I *could* hear!

Now for the good stuff. It's fun and fluffy for the most part and if you let your 13+ kids watch anime on TV the only thing new they're going to see is bouncy breasts with nipples and Barbie genitals. If you think your 14 year old hasn't seen this yet then by all means hide their eyes!",1183852800,,772,4.398601398601398

gets kinky and even more kinky. Loads of viloence and nudity and even

goes awawy and comes back even more sinister. it's a movie that pleases

you with how cool people or monsters can fight each other. Another hyper

violent romp in anime. the old school covers were better on vhs in my opinion.",1160006400,,440,4.382716049382716
1385340,4,B000050IL9,"If you've read any of my previous reviews, then you know that I'm not a huge fan of fan-service. I think its shameless and I believe that animators use it to keep your attention while they struggle to keep the story going. This is why weaker anime can sometimes thrive, because it allures subconsciously to our more carnal section of our brains (philosophical, huh?). New Cutey Honey, however, isn't one of those anime. Fan-service dominates this series, but it runs parallel to the story, and is really meant to bring about laughs more than anything.

Honey is an android capable of changing into many different forms, all with their own special skills and uniforms. Unfortunately, that means she must end up in the buff for at least a few moments while the old uniforms shreds away for the new one to come. Though clearly shameless, it's usually funny because no matter how modest she attempts to be it just doesn't work. She must use a vast array of uniforms and skills in order to battle the evil Dolmeck, the man responsible for taking control of an entire city. Helping Honey is a young boy--who blushingly idolizes Honey--and his family, including the lecherous grandpa and the boy's criminal parents. When mixed together, it adds an interesting and unique cast.

Though filled with action and some drama, this is not a drama in any way. It's pure slapstick comedy from start to finish, never meant to be taken seriously. The animation quality is pretty high for an anime of that time, and Go Nagai, one of the legendary directors and animators, applies his well-known style. I'd recommend this to people who either enjoyed the original Cutey Honey series, are a fan of Go Nagai and his many anime, or like anime similar in design such as Golden Boy, then pick this up. Rated 17+, though, I would keep it away from children.",1137542400,33,1831,4.71875
1385341,4,B000050IL9,"Cutey Honey is an acquired taste even for anime fans, but it's endlessly pleasing to its fans. This isn't just because of its frequent nudity or its interesting battles, it's also because it has colorful, likeable characters and a very creative premise. Honey, able to change from one female form to another at will, has near-limitless means of trouncing her opponents, but she's not indestructible and part of the fun comes from how she figures her way out of certain sticky messes.

The DVD is low on extras but the picture and sound quality are excellent and it's great to have all the episodes in one package. The English dub isn't the best I've ever heard but since there is the option of watching it in Japanese with subtitles I'm not complaining. This is a good collection and it's a shame there were never more episodes released. Cutey Honey is a fun and funny series that leaves you wanting more.",1126396800,9,905,4.65625
1385342,5,B000050IL9,"Chokkei feels like he is the luckiest boy in the world cause he gets to protect the lovely warrior ""who's an android but still looks good"" who fights evil at all causes. Why he gets to protect her cause of his innocent charm which some how work on her. Good thing this is the kind of android who can't keep her clothes on. Vols. 1 & 2 are in this case their both interesting.

Rated 17 up: nudity, violence, and profanity",1120435200,2,421,4.197530864197531
1385343,5,B000050IL9,"Just watch and see, it's intensely violent, and the nudity is certainly on a perverted scale. However, this is Go Nagai we're talking about here, so it is ultimately not a huge surprise.",1115769600,,186,4.666666666666667
1385344,4,B000050IL9,"yeah, I forget!  With Honey's bouncy breasts and ample derriere- jutting, the words in the title song are somewhat lost.  Cutey Honey is a fun anime that I plan to keep watching.  In this first volume, the title character makes her debut.  A demure secretary for Mayor Light, Honey Kisaragi discovers her true identity with the help of a dirty old man, Grandpa Danbei.  Honey can ""change"" appearance and costume into just about anything, including a gorgeous mermaid, depending on what the situation calls for.  All she has to do is yell ""Honey, FLASH!!""

In Cosplay City, where all the buildings close up look suspiciously like The Flintstones' houses, there are all kinds of He-Man reject villians attacking anything right and just. Mayor Light is the last bastion of justice for the city.  Little Grandpa Danbei, whose body is really a cyborg, enhanced with powerful weapons, knows Honey's secret.  His grandson, Chokkei, and Chokkei's parents, live with him and Honey.  Chokkei's dad is also a pervert.  One disturbing scene shows an enraged Chokkei's mom, naked and ranting about what a good body she has, after she has captured her husband and father-in-law spying on Honey in the shower.  The scene is disturbing because Chokkei is grabbing his naked mom, trying to stop her.

Where does Honey come from?  Much more of the mystery of her past has yet to be revealed.  In the third episode, it is revealed she is an android.  The main He-Man Villian Reject, Dolmek, comments that Honey, the ""lovely warrior"" is part of a prophecy.  What is the prophecy?  Is Honey unknowingly playing into the bad guys' hands?

I am a little confused.  Honey's changing involves the magical girl genre, but she is an android.  So is she magic or mecha?  In anime, the two are rarely combined.  Oh, well, maybe I am overthinking it.  Let's watch the jiggling, round chest and fabulous physique.  ""She's the Girl With The . . . Uh . . . """,1110240000,28,1925,4.743202416918429
1385345,4,B000050IL9,"First off I am kind of ashamed to even rate this item as that is it very much meant to be be a hentai.  First off a warning to those planing to possibly purchase this the movie has strong language mostly the F bomb.  Secondly lots of nudity and lesbain actions.  However, this movie really isn't just that the story line is average to almost strong. Because the charcter of Cutey Honey is so 1# culess it is funny and 2# a very addictive personality.  Not to mention the just odd ball things that happen.  The adult theme to it is really the downfall I would say but, the charcter designs and personalities make up for it.  Plus the Cutey Honey theme is very catchy their is alot to say for well done music in anime!!  If your a big anime fan why not buy this and take if for a test drive.  Alot better than that modern anime crap!",1108598400,5,831,4.15
1385346,5,B000050IL9,"This collection is the better alternative to buying the more expensive single discs separately.  I love Cutey Honey.  I had the original VHS tapes years ago and was glad that a collection of the eight episodes had finally been released.  The extras on the DVDs include cosplay performances and interviews with the voice actresses.

Sadly the number of episodes belies an unfinished work.  I have a feeling Go Nagai wanted a continuing series, but never got around to making it so.  Still, for all fans of Cutey Honey this is a must-buy collection.",1091664000,6,547,4.827956989247312
1385347,1,B000050IL9,"You know, I keep hearing that Go Nagai is this manga/anime legend. After viewing Cutey Honey and looking at the character designs and reading reviews of his other works, I'm not impressed. To me, it would be like saying Tiny Tim was a pioneer of rock music. It just doesn't add up. The first volume of this collection was fair, but the second disk became unwatchable fast.
The world of Cutey Honey is a strange place, looking like something from Hell basically. Cosplay City, where the action takes place is a gloomy, sunless, place where you would expect to find Lucifer. We do find his equivalent in the uni-brow demon crime lord Dolmek. The city is overrun with crime, even the parents of the preadolescent Chokkei, are involved in the crime wave. The new mayor is trying to change things but even he can't rid the city of crime alone. That's where Cutey Honey comes in.
Cutey Honey is a well-endowed female android whose powers allow her to shapeshift to defeat the evil person of the week. She also has an attraction to Chokkei which borders on the illegal.
In the end she always transforms into a beautiful red-headed warrior with a sword, but before she does that she catalogs all of her guises she used in the episode before she kills her enemy. To transform she has to yell ""Honey Flash!"" This is a good pun because all her clothes dissolve off her body and she is stark naked as she changes. Her enemies are usually human in appearance until she begins to fight them and then they shoot up something from a syringe and they transform into a demon.
The first disk ends in a confrontation with Dolmek in which the ship she is fighting him on blows up as Chokkei looks on helplessly. Is Cutey Honey dead? Did she win? Did she escape?
Who knows?
When you put in volume 2, unexplainably you are on a different world. The characters are basically the same, except Chokkei looks about 17 or so now and Cutey Honey is asking him about sex. The city has the same name and mayor but it has transformed into a modern looking city with skyscrapers and such. Without any explanation, we have dimensionally shifted to a world completely different than the first volume. This is where my attention span dropped off. It was too disorienting to me. I mean, 2001: A Space Odyssey made more sense to me.
The series was interesting at first but the battles all ended the same way. It followed an unalterable formula. The abrupt change with no explanation on the second disk destroyed any enjoyment. I didn't even finish watching after the 2nd episode on Volume 2.
There are tons of extras if you're a Honey fan. Especially amusing were the sections showing these 3 Japanese actresses portraying characters from the series at press conferences and anime festivals. At one point, they are singing the theme song, and they are the most horribly choreographed 3 people I have ever seen. They can hardly even keep a beat, and their moves are so slow, you can tell they didn't get much rehearsal time. when they act out a fight scene from the show, it looks like William Shatner and Dolemite had a hand in the stunts. There are interviews, trailers, phone messages, and a recording session of the theme song. If you really like Cutey Honey, you'll love this collection. If you're not a fan, I would recommend you not waste your money on these dvds.
For better fan serviced action that actually is of good quality, I would recommend Najica Blitz Tactics on Dvd.",1089504000,11,3444,4.592532467532467
1385348,5,B000050IL9,"Go Nagai is one of the best animator's alive, and Cutey Honey is one of his most fun series to watch.  Honey is a beautiful android who is able to change into many forms. She reminds me of Naomi Armitage in that she feels very deeply for other humans. Her nemesis is Dolmeck, ruler of the dark world.  He controls various demonic creatures that pose as normal humans, and Honey must battle these demons in pretty much every episode.  Beautifully done, with a great sense of humor.  If you enjoy Cutey Honey, then check out Kekko Kamen or Hanappe Bazooka.  If you want more serious anime, then buy the Devilman DVD!  He is also responsible for Mazinger and Getter Robo, for you fans of Robotech, Macross and Gundam.  I would highly recommend getting as many of his videos and DVDs as possible.

This anime isn't too bad. It has tons of action, comedy and lots of fan service. The story needs some work, but Cutey Honey is about having fun. The main focus is the action and the constant nudity. That's enough to keep most people interested, but not enough to make it great. I was a little disappointed; not that I expected a lot in the first place. I must say that  The animation isn't bad considering how old it is. Many animes in that time period had awful voice acting as well. That's not the case here. It's fairly decent. This DVD has 4 episodes. That's kind of a let down considering that you could fit the whole series on 1 disc. I think that this deserves 3 stars. It kept me occupied, but I wasn't thoroughly entertained. I think it's a little overpriced. I think that it's worth $5 at the most.

7928936,5,B000050IL9,"Manga writer/artist Go Nagai brings audiences a hero that is the complete polar opposite of his other popular character known as Devil Man. Here he presents us with Cutey Honey. Go Nagai created this character around 1973 (before Sailor Moon which was created in 1992). Go Nagai initially represented Cutey Honey's character through manga (Japanese comic books).

Cutey Honey is not your ""typical"" heroine that carries a bad ass demeanor, and the clich ""I don't take crap from anyone attitude"" that we usually see from many western interpretations of female comic book heroes (which is not a bad thing, by the way). The no nonsense ""I'm a bad ass heroine that will kick your butt"" heroine is all fine and good. But I enjoy the change of pace that the Cutey Honey character is. She is a Warrior of Love. She carries neither hatred nor animosity. She is here to defend the weak and the innocent with an essence of love. Her powers give her the ability to be good at anything she changes into while she still proves to be a caring and good person that adores humanity. This is why I enjoy Cutey Honey. She adores humanity and sees the good in people regardless of their shortcomings, yet at the same time she is a true hero.

Cutey Honey is a childhood hero of mine. If you like action, science fiction, comedy, and a bit of distorted ""out there"" styled comedy then this show is for you.

She's capable of miracles, she spends a lot of time with two thieves, she's hanging on a cross by the second ep, and (here's the biggie) she has no sin nature.  Well, why would she?
