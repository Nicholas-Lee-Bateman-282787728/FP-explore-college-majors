Please, please let's collectively return to this great man and the greatest composer his true identity! And let's continue enjoying his great music!",1023148800,,413,5.555555555555555
7800781,1,0769720110,"This video is a misfire. It attempts to chronicle the life of Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov, arguably one of the most seminal of Russian composers, but wastes much of the half hour on bad dance ""interpretations"" of some of his works. This is lamentable, as the footage of his native village and his St. Petersburg apartment is fascinating. Better luck on some of the other tapes in this series.",985392000,2,388,4.8059701492537314
