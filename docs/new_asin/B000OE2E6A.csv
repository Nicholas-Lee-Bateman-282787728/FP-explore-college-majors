8184770,5,B000OE2E6A,"Okay, I'd like to clear up a few things about these dvd sets. ""Are You Afraid of the Dark"" was one of my favorite shows as a kid and I almost didn't buy this dvd set, I'm glad I did. Alot of peolpe are wondering if these are bootlegs. They are not. They are 100% authentic dvds. THe show was a canadian show that Nickelodeon co-produced and released in America. The dvds are from the canadian company. Don't expect a Nickelodeon rlease of the show. They seem quite content screwing over fans of early 90's Nick, by cnacleing the release the final season of Pete and Pete, and not putting any of Salute Your Shorts on dvd either. The biggest issue people were worried about with these dvds was The first seasons packaging. It is a tri fold out cardboard case, like a standard tv show dvd is. The problem is, it doesn't include an outer sleeve to put it into. It's supposed to be that way, so don't worry. Not the best packaging, but it works. The other 2 seasons that were released do include an outer sleeve, which I definitly prefer, but the first season is acceptable. The dvds are of great quality, the picture and sound qaulity is great too. Don't expect remastered in surround sound and high def, but they are better than your average tv broadcast quality. Another question people had was about the changed opening. The first season has a changed opening. They cut the regualr opening short and added a bunch of scenes from the show cut to the credits music. Season 2 and 3 have the original opening you all remember and love. And finally, the question of altered scenes in episodes. In the first season, The Tale of The Hungry Hounds, a scene in the begining is cut where the main characters friend jumps out and scares her in the attic. It cuts akwardly instead to her reacting and doesbn't make any sense in the context. I don't know why thet did it, but the episode is far from ruined with that 5 second scene excised. The only other part thet changed was the song at the end of the Prom Queen episode. They changed it because they lost the rights to the song. Again, not a big deal, but be forewarned. These dvds are definitly worth the price, and they will play in your dvd player. They are Region 1 which is North America and Canada so don't worry. They are not available in American stores as far as I know, so ebay and amazon are your best bet for getting them. Hope this helped to clear up a few things, and let's hope they put out the rest of the incredible show soon!",1182124800,32,2484,4.355603448275862
