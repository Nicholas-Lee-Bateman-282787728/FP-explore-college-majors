8073237,1,B000A2XC6C,kick it out of your cart this is a insult to kick boxing and your hard earned money do not buy this i wouldn't give this to someone i didn't like,1331424000,,145,3.7096774193548385
8073238,3,B000A2XC6C,"I love Janis Saffell's work-outs. I bought most of her DVDs and I am a happy customer ;o) However, this DVD was a disappointment for me. You need some extra equipment for this DVD: You need a 'step' to step up and down. I did not know this when I bought the DVD and I cannot do half of the exercises on this DVD because I do not have the right equipment. (And I also do not want to buy any big equipments). I am writing this comment as a warning to other Janis fans. Regards...",1200787200,5,477,3.9791666666666665
8073239,4,B000A2XC6C,"I did this workout for the first time this morning.  I found it frustrating because I think the choreography is a little complex.  However, I do think once I get the choreography down I will enjoy it.  I was sweating throughout the workout even though I messed up quite a bit.  I will say that I didn't enjoy this workout nearly as much as Strike Zone but it is still a very good workout.  You have to do multiple combinations.  You learn them each and repeat them several times.  At the end you have to put all of the combinations together and I had a hard time remembering them once I moved on to the next one.",1189123200,4,612,4.17948717948718
8073240,5,B000A2XC6C,"This is a really, really hard, but awesome work out. I just love it!! The DVD is divided into four (4) sections. First part: A good warm-up. Second part: A regular kickboxing class. Third part: Kickboxing with a step and a partner if you want to. The Fourth part: A good cool down.

If you do all four (4) sections at one time, I promise you will sweat like you have never sweat before. The work out is just about 1 hr. and in that time you will work every part of your body. Janis is a great instructor, but if you have no previous kickboxing experience you may be a little confused. Do what you can, and you will get better after each time you do the work-out.

The sound and quality of the dvd is horrible, but if you gan look passed that, it is one of the best work-out you will ever do!!",1188259200,3,792,4.07051282051282
8073241,4,B000A2XC6C,"I have done kickboxing before and was really excited about trying this one out.  I needed to do the routine many times before I felt comfortable with it.  I would recommend this workout to those of you that catch on to intermediate to advance choreographed workouts.  If that makes sense. Janis's other workout ""StrikeZONE"" was awesome and much easier to learn.  They are both great workouts and make you sweat but the other is easier to learn than this one was.",1175299200,6,462,4.666666666666667
