8196634,5,B000QJLW5C,"Pagliacci was perfect for Del Monaco's voice... He terrified and thrilled me all the way through this.
His 'Il nome!"" at the end of Act I was sublimely horrifying; and I almost wept at the end of the opera-- the horror in his voice! My word!
the audience loved it, too--  nearly fifteen minutes of curtain calls. After Act I alone they had to ring up the curtain four times.
This is an opera you shouldn't miss for anything!",1403049600,2,424,4.367088607594937

The performance's and the production are very satisfying. It's special to have this record of Mario Del Monaco's singing.",1397347200,2,248,5.073170731707317
8196636,5,B000QJLW5C,"Simply put, the number one reason to purchase this video, is the unbelievable performance of Mario del Monaco as Canio. After the first act aria, Vesti la giubba, I literally had to pick my jaw up off the floor. NO ONE in my memory has EVER achieved the same sense of pathos, desperation and drama---NO ONE, not Corelli, Domingo, Pavarotti, NO ONE. Don't get me wrong, I love these other tenors. But del Monaco was in a class of his own. Unforgettable.
The DVD is from a performance in Japan and there are embedded Japanese subtitles. The chorus is Japanese and while they perform admirably, they are clearly fascinated with del Monaco's performance, and who can blame them?
This performance is a must-own, not only for opera fans, but for anyone curious about how the big boys used to sing. They don't make them like this anymore. It ranks as one of my all-time treasured recordings.
Highest recommendation.",1373068800,4,908,4.753164556962025
8196637,5,B000QJLW5C,"This 1961 b&w production of Pagliacci was filmed live in Japan with Japanese choristers and the NHK Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Giuseppe Morelli.  The camera work is good quality and the subtitles are clear and well done.

The performances are superb.  In order of my admiration:  Mario Del Monaco is a powerful singer (like Placido Domingo) and as Canio he brings emotional intensity to the role--the kind that sends a chill up your spine!  The audience loved him.

Aldo Protti, who appeared first as the Prologue, also portrayed Tonio, the deformed, half-wit in love with Nedda whose revenge for her scorn fuels the action.  He is a convincing actor as well as a dramatic baritone.  He actually did a gymnastic flip at the beginning of the opera.  (I rarely see anyone--except Juan Diego Florez--do anything athletic in opera!)  I was impressed!

Gabriella Tucci as Nedda gives a splendid performance, too.  She plays the pivotal part against the four major roles, Canio, Tonio, Silvio and Beppe, with the widest emotional range of expression.

Attilio D'Orazi as Silvio and Antonio Pirino as Beppe were great, too.

If you like Pagliacci, this is worth a viewing.",1209686400,10,1171,5.0

My deepest thanks the the Japanese nation for having done the almost impossible and make our dreams come true to see and hear our heroes of old showing how it should be done !!!",1206662400,13,326,4.030769230769231
