6014521,1,B00FM4S7KO,I wish they would stop making these motion comics and make some real animation titles instead. These are not good Marvel.,1383264000,19,121,4.809523809523809

6014523,3,B00FM4S7KO,"This movie is another Marvel Knight ""comic/stop animation"" type film (it's hard to explain unless you have seen it). I'm a huge Wolverine fan and have been for over 20 years. This is another re-imaging origins story for Logan and Victor. The story is fine, ""animation"" is gorgeous BUT it is only available in DVD. I couldn't find anyplace to rent/watch it, so I bought it. Considering, if I could have got it in Blu-ray for the same price, 4 stars, but since it is the DVD version at this price, 3 stars.",1407024000,,504,4.43010752688172
6014524,5,B00FM4S7KO,"wolverine fan from way back, now i know more surely the relationship between logan and sabertooth, in addition to the wolverine movie version relationship, great video!!!!",1405555200,,171,5.615384615384615
6014525,5,B00FM4S7KO,"Exactly the same as in the comic book; however, if you prefer the original look of Sabretooth this will disappoint you.",1404950400,,119,4.714285714285714
6014526,5,B00FM4S7KO,Excellent,1404604800,,9,9.0
6014527,2,B00FM4S7KO,"Please, Marvel, please lay off Wolverine for a while.  Hes not only in but also the center of nearly all of your motion comics lately.  And theyve not been good.  While the animators have out done themselves, they're getting better and better, the stories have gotten so dull.  After THOR and LOKI, nearly all of them center on Logan.  The only time that really turned out to be a good thing was HULK vs Wolverine, which was GREAT.  I see you have ETERNALS coming, and I look forward to it.  Thanks for that.  Id still LOVE to see maybe Peter Davids MADROX mini series that lead to X-FACTOR.  Or Greg Ruckas PUNISHER.  Or ANYTHING from Majorie Liu.  Her X-23 run would be amazing and hey!  Logan is in it!

Also, please lay off Paul Cornell.  Hes a strong writer, but these adaptions haven't made that case.  InHumans didn't work.  Logans ORIGINS def didn't work.

How about some more stories like IRON MAN: Extremis?  Or the SPIDER-MAN one.  That was great.  The Whedon X-MEN motion comics were solid.

I LOVE motion comics.  Just not this one.",1404432000,,1045,4.535135135135135
6014528,4,B00FM4S7KO,"For anyone who doesn't know this is not a cartoon, it's a motion comic.  This means it's the artwork from the page cut out and given movement.  It doesn't look amazing by any stretch of the word but it's the closet you will get to the comic in terms of ""animation"".

With that out of the way this one was fun.  The voice acting is actually pretty good.  Well Wolverine is good, the rest are decent.  They reuse some animation a few times too many but the episodic editing sort of explains that.  Speaking of editing I wish they would cut out the intro and credits on these DVDs because they're unnecessary.

As for the story it's fun.  I was surprised Jeph Leob wrote it.  My only complaint is it left a lot of unanswered questions.  It is a comic after all though and the special features sported some scenes from the sequel book so one can assume they plan on finishing it.  While on the subject the interview with the creators was interesting and gave me a new respect for Leob I never had before.

I can't say how this plays when you've already read the comic as someone who hasn't it was enjoyable.  The book and this film are the same price so it's up to you which you'd prefer.  Personally I read a lot of comics so sometimes it's nice to ""watch"" one instead.",1404086400,2,1266,4.282700421940929
6014529,1,B00FM4S7KO,"WARNING! You don't get the whole story on this DVD. Just watched this and I was incredibly disappointed when it just ended abruptly. This DVD only features the first part of a two-part story that Loeb and Bianchi originally did in the comics. And the DVD description doesn't mention that at all. Why Marvel decided not to include the 2nd four-issue miniseries is absolutely bewildering.

In a special feature documentary that is included on this DVD, Loeb even talks about how it was built to be two parts. So, if you are interested in the full tale story, do NOT buy this DVD. Pick up the book that has both parts.

6014530,5,B00FM4S7KO,this product was purchased as a gift and the person was very happy to receive this as a gift and will view it many times over and over again,1402617600,,140,3.8620689655172415
6014531,3,B00FM4S7KO,"We love cartoons on the avengers and xmen. My husbands favorite character is Wolverine so I got this for him. The story is pretty good, but we really aren't into the kind of still animation style.",1402444800,,196,4.472222222222222
6014532,5,B00FM4S7KO,I loved Wolverine vs Sabretooth storyline. I grew up watching superheros and read all the books for many years. It`s been about 8 years since I picked up comic book and collect superhero movies and animation instead and this one was a much valued addition to my collection.,1400630400,,273,4.708333333333333
6014533,3,B00FM4S7KO,"This storyline between Wolverine & Sabretooth, which I actually followed in its comic book form, is the reason I purchased it as it was the first time a comic book I collected was done in the motion comic form. While I would not sell it or trade it, it marks the first time I felt so-so about a motion comic from Marvel. The voice acting is done well, and the art retains much of it original form, but standing on the fence of this Marvel Knights production left such a dissatisfied taste in my mouth that I honestly considered not purchasing another one from Marvel. For me, the benchmark for Marvel's motion comics are still Iron Man: Extremis and Spider-Woman: Agent of S.W.O.R.D. With as many of these motion comics that I have pre-ordered, while reviews can sway the wind of consideration from yes to no, I think my streak will end until opinions are left about the next one, which again is features Wolverine.",1397174400,3,915,4.551515151515152
6014534,5,B00FM4S7KO,Great story and great art work. I hope they put the other part of the story in a stop motion comic film as well.,1396051200,2,112,3.7083333333333335
6014535,5,B00FM4S7KO,"I love all of these animations.  They don't need to animate because they realize the story is so powerful in these, that it will carry the sales.  They are right.  These stories are Great Pieces of writing.  Fans need to buy for sure.",1395964800,,234,4.372093023255814
6014536,3,B00FM4S7KO,I very much wish that Marvel would do more things like Green Lantern Animated Series rather than crank out these mediocre quality motion comics.  If I want comics I'll read the mags.  If I want motion I'll watch animated series.,1394928000,5,228,4.675
6014537,2,B00FM4S7KO,Nice to see a different point of view but this one was a stretch. This battle should have never ended this way.,1394323200,,111,4.090909090909091
6014538,5,B00FM4S7KO,Good story to watch if your a fan. Though the description says one must die its not a big strech to guess which one. But like all the Marvel Knights DVD so far its worth the watch.,1394323200,,180,3.891891891891892
6014539,5,B00FM4S7KO,Well marvel does it again. another great motion comic. I have seen almost all of them and have not been disappointed. I think this is kind of a sequel to the wolverine origin story. I can't believe they finally kill off sabertooth. the most famous rivalry in the marvel universe. but spoiler alert in the special feature they give a hint that sabertooth comes back and shows scenes  in the special feature that's not in the movie. so are they releasing another one a vol. 2. I hope so because they kind of leave you standing and wondering who the heck is romules. I hope they put it out soon. but all in all this is a awesome motion comic. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1393891200,,695,4.265151515151516
6014540,4,B00FM4S7KO,classic battle it was time for them to put up or shut up for good! you see who the real animal is!,1393372800,,98,3.5
6014541,4,B00FM4S7KO,"I enjoyed this motion comic a lot and I think this is what Marvel does best, (DC kills them in the animation department) but can anyone explain that in the extras ""spoiler alert"", they show more images from the motion comic that were not in the feature. It is discussed how Sabertooth comes back and they show the scenes where that happens. Are they planning to release it in the future? I was left wanting more.",1393286400,,412,4.434210526315789
6014542,4,B00FM4S7KO,Another good job by Marvel knights. Good extras as well. I love the whole series of motion comics very good acting and voice work.,1393200000,,130,4.458333333333333
6014543,1,B00FM4S7KO,"I was expecting it to be an animated movie not still pictures with narrations. Good story line, Marvel should have taken the time to produce this feature the right way.",1393200000,,168,4.633333333333334
6014544,5,B00FM4S7KO,"I found these DVD, to be excellent.
I appreciate all Marvel knights, movies please continue to sell and offer any of these movies.",1393200000,,130,4.695652173913044
6014545,5,B00FM4S7KO,Great story which answers many questions in regard to the history between Wolverine and Sabre Tooth. I truly enjoyed this story as well as the artwork.,1393027200,,151,4.846153846153846
6014546,2,B00FM4S7KO,"I purchased a motion comic before without knowing it.  I was very disappointed and threw it out after I seen it wasn't an animated movie.  The same thing happened when I purchased this one--Marvel Knights: Wolverine Vs Sabertooth.  Before I purchased it, I wanted to be sure it was not a motion comic but I couldn't see anywhere on the packaging that is was or was not.  After unsuccessfully trying to figure that out, I purchased it anyway hoping it was an animated movie.  But when I got home and put the disc in my dvd player, lo and behold, it was another motion comic.  I was again very disappointed. Although the story line in this motion comic was entertaining, I was still regretting the fact that I was mislead into thinking it was an animated movie.  There should be something on the packaging stating it is a motion comic and not an animated movie. Maybe ""Marvel Knights"" only makes motion and I should look out for that before buying another dvd that I believe is an animated movie.  By the way, unless I missed something on the navigation menu of this dvd, this motion comic was just 10 minutes long.  I was so angry when it ended after 10 minutes, I threw it out just like I did the other one.",1392336000,3,1207,4.400900900900901
6014547,3,B00FM4S7KO,I'd rather buy a digital version of this.  Who buys DVDs anymore.  It's not available in iTunes or Amazon as a digital copy... meh,1390176000,,130,4.375
6014548,1,B00FM4S7KO,"but for everyone else i'ed pass on this. like most big names these days. they would rather pump out crap to empty fans wallet rather than make a quality product. this is not ""animation"" its a digital comic.",1389916800,3,206,4.447368421052632
6014549,5,B00FM4S7KO,One of the best stories I have seen  in a long while and recommend it to anyone who is into Wolverine,1389916800,,101,3.8095238095238093
6014550,5,B00FM4S7KO,"First off I want to give a disclaimer that this is a MOTION COMIC not an animated movie. I keep seeing negative reviews on motion comics from people who expected something different. A motion comic is exactly what it sounds like, think about it like stop motion straight from the comic panels with a little added for transition and voice and sound tracks added. I really like that Marvel does this and hope they keep putting them out. It's a great way to bring your favorite story lines together without losing the art and feel of a comic like animation does.
The story is word for word from the comics, Wolverine volume 3 issues 50-55 the story line called ""Evolution"". This pretty much picks up right after Wolverine gets all of his memories back and is trying to piece his past together. Sabretooth has always been a large part of that past and this story brings their tension to a climax. Romulus is introduced in this story and I think he has been one of the better secondary villains introduced in the last 10 years. Yes, this is the same Romulus that founded Rome just a little bit of a different story. If you like this and want continue reading the exploits of Wolverine vs.  Romulus read the Wolverine: Origins story line. That whole run by Daniel Way builds up to a great ending between the two and I hope that Marvel considers adding those stories to the Marvel Knights motion comics line.
Overall this was a word for word adaption of Jeph Loeb and Simone Bianchi's story. There are plenty of cameos from other Marvel characters like Rouge, Black Panther, Storm, Emma Frost, Cyclops, Wild Child and some of Alpha Flight. The voice actors did a great job, but I do feel they may have gone over the top with Storm. This story is probably best suited for a mature audience and again it is a motion comic. If you want a cartoon go watch Wolverine and the X-Men. Worth the watch for any comic and Wolverine fan.",1389657600,18,1918,4.495702005730659
6014551,5,B00FM4S7KO,"Marvel Knights motion Comics are always at the top of their game & always manage to hit their releases out of the park. Needless to say, their at the forefront when it comes to this exciting, fairly new medium that's sure to replace the printed comic form in the future. Personally I wish DC Entertainment would step up to the plate & give Marvel some healthy competition since DC has a few motion comic releases under their belt but not nearly as many as Marvel Knights. Anyways, this comes as close to a comic book adaption that your ever going to get other than besides reading the stories panel for panel at your own leisure. If you enjoy art, film, & animation, this is the perfect mix.",1387756800,3,691,4.448818897637795

8616833,2,B00FM4S7KO,"Herky jerky movements of ""animated"" still-art is distracting and reminiscent of marionette puppets from the 70's.  They broke the entire video into little vignettes about 5-10 minutes each complete with credits... Again, distracting.
