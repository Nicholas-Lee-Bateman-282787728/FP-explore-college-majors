This is one of my most watched movies, and I've probably seen it at least 100 times...seriously!  (which is why I'm buying it on DVD, I'm afraid my VHS tape may be on it's last leg).  It's because of this movie that I have long planned a hike of my own on the Long Trail, something I will achieve someday.  Each of the hikers; Joe, Nancy, Dan and Verna (aka 'Grama Soule') offer a unique perspective on their hikes as individuals, and as a group.  Four retired individuals, hiking 270 miles....how can that not inspire anyone, of any age, to not attempt something similar?  If you haven't seen it, and you wonder if you might like it, I hope my review influences you to do so....you'll love it.  Enjoy, and happy hiking!",1491350400,,819,4.348684210526316
