It is an amazing piece of art.  If you get the chance to buy it, don't hesitate!",1353283200,,249,4.413043478260869

8045259,5,B00076YOZE,"My rating for this DVD is 5 out of 5, there's just no words to describe its beauty. It is truly awesome and mind blowing. I would like to have a copy of the cd if it's available. This piece of music reminds me of 8.30 by Weather Report.",1226448000,3,236,3.836734693877551
8045260,5,B00076YOZE,"This is probably the best concert DVD I own! I had the CD from the same concert for a long time and I was dreaming about being THERE in the audience. Now I have my dream on my big sceen! Three words to describe : Perfection, perfection, and perfection. Sound quality is superb. Image is HD. I was absolutely shocked by the vocal of Rachelle Ferrell in classic ""Atumn Leaves"" (not on CD). All the musicians are the masters of their instruments. This is the supergroup of jazz:

Wayne Shorter, Stanley Clarke, Lenny White, and Michael Petrucciani are the core of the band but Pete Levin and Gil Goldstein are adding the fantastic moody background sound. If you own the CD you must get this DVD. There is slightly different material on them. This kind of music I would take to a deserted island.",1156982400,16,792,4.5
