3655744,5,B001JAHQ1Q,ER is one of the greatest TV series.,1310515200,,36,3.625
3655745,5,B001JAHQ1Q,"After reading all of the negative reviews I was a bit hesitant to order this DVD set but thankfully I went ahead & ordered it because I loved it!
SPOILER--

It did seem like Dr. Pratt was made ""too nice"" because they knew he was going to die so it was to make us miss him even more!  If I didn't know he was going to die I'd have bought this Big Brother to everyone act and been impressed w/the character's turn around.

I reluctantly ordered S15...I say reluctantly because I dread watching the episode where he does die! :((",1307318400,,526,4.24

3655747,5,B001JAHQ1Q,Just hooked on this program and seems like it takes FOREVER for the next series to come out in my region!,1298419200,,105,4.0476190476190474
3655748,3,B001JAHQ1Q,"In a season scheduled to be its last, fans actually benefitted by the writers' strike, as ER was brought back for a fifteenth season.  Unfortunately the fourteenth season, released on DVD from Warner Home Video on January 11th, 2011, is extremely uneven in its storytelling.  Luckily the performances of the actors both guest and regular, make this season worth watching.

Most notable of the excellent performances by a guest is that of Stanley Tucci as Dr. Daniel Moretti whose subtle brilliance as the new head honcho brings a sense of class to the show from his appearance in the season opener:  The War Comes Home.  Despite the fine performance of Tucci, the impact of a new chief on the ER has simply been seen too many times before, and thus the first few episodes of season fourteen seem dissappointingly familiar.  Like many of the storylines throughout the season, that of the restrained Dr. Moretti takes an abrupt turn as writers struggle to get rid of someone who had not signed on for a fifteenth season.  The same can be said for many relationships throughout the season, as storylines begin and end awkwardly.

In anticipation of the end of the series, the cast of regulars had been whittled down to just six (Parminder Nagra as Dr. Neela Rasgotra, Linda Cardellini as Nurse Sam Taggart, Scott Grimes as Dr. Archie Morris, John Stamos as Dr. Tony Gates, Maura Tierney as Dr. Abby Lockhart, Mekhi Phifer as Dr. Greg Pratt) and that allows for not only the audience to truly appreciate those that are there, but also for each of the talented actors to be given plenty of time to shine.  Tierney takes full advantage of the opportunity as Dr. Abby Lockhart runs the gambit of trials and tribulations throughout the entire season.  One could only hope that Abby would find happiness in season fifteen, cuz there is not much to be had here.

Season fourteen includes the 300th episode which is celebrated with a unique episode in which Dr. Morris wagers three hundred dollars that the ER can treat 300 patients in one twenty-four hour period.  This storyline is wrought with forced comedy that fails to payoff.  Other disappointments in this numerically historic episode include a return appearance by former regular Goran Visnjic as Dr. Lukka Kovac and a guest appearance by legendary actor turned infomercial host; Peter Fonda.  Fonda's character is dealing with a terminally ill wife and an introduction to a son with Downs Syndrome that he had given up at birth.  Visnjic and Fonda never share any screen time in this episode but still manage to compete for the most stoic and one-dimensional performance.  Episode 300 does include a pleasant but far too brief look back and some of the more memorable patients that have stopped in to the ER.

Other guest appearances in season fourteen include:  Charlotte Rae, Eddie Mekka, Hal Holbrook, Patrick Cassidy, Jesse Borrego, Howard Hesseman, and Steve Buscemi who appears in the final episode of the season.  Buscemi works well with what he is given, but the cliffhanger to ponder over the course of the summer, like most of season fourteen, is far too contrived.

The bonus features include ER at 300: Highlights from the ER 300th Episode Tribute at the Paley Center for Media featuring cast and crew, Gag Reel, Outpatient Outtakes: Unaired Scenes, and Subtitles.  Like in previous season releases, the gag reels seem staged and simply aren't enjoyable to watch.  Even more disappointing is the tribute which is poorly edited and will leave you wondering why they didn't give us the whole event.  The reasons for exclusion of the Outpatient Outtakes: Unaired Scenes will be obvious when you watch them.

Recommendation:  This release has potential to irritate the most loyal of fans for many reasons, the least of which is that Warner Home Video changed the size of the packaging from the previous thirteen releases.  Thanks for ruining the uniformity of the collection guys.  The episodes are a mixed bag full of good performances lost in poor storytelling.
Season fourteen is worth buying for the performances and for the true fan that needs to complete the collection and does not care how it looks on the shelf.",1297036800,5,4177,4.887943262411348
3655749,2,B001JAHQ1Q,"What an awful season.  I can only suppose it had to do with the writers strike.  It seemed more like a soap opera to me, and the camera work was awful as well, almost like home made movies with too many closeups.  It also looked like most of the season was shot late spring and summer months as you did not get the sense of changing seasons as you did over the course of other seasons, although there were a few winter episodes.  Pratt lost like 20 pounds overnight near the end, so I could tell there was quite a gap between 2 episodes at that point, strike related no doubt.

I was also disturbed by the apparent acceptance of some behaviour like doctors lying to childrens parents to perform or withold treatment on the children, police attacking a patient and striking an attendant who got in the way, none of which resulted in any action taken against the doctor or policeman, or even any outrage from those who witnessed it, or were victimized by it.

It did improve near the end, and the last episode suggests one or two characters will no longer be with us in season 15.  If you are an ER fan you will buy it, but if you have to miss any of the 15 seasons, this is probably the one to miss.

I normally do not write reviews but after seeing the 2 positive reviews that seemed out of line with my experience, I decided to put my 2 cents in.  I still look forward to season 15, but expectations are not high.",1295654400,8,1414,4.226765799256506
3655750,5,B001JAHQ1Q,"This is probably one of my favorite season of ER, next too Season 2 of course. It has a sweet ending that leads to season 15 (which they need to hurry up and make) the season finale. I have seen every episode or ER and i can honestly tell you that this season ER delivers the goods. We see many lovable characters leave, new flames are lite, and last but not least amazing stories of patience who ended up in the Emergency Room. This show is the longest lasting series on television and it proves it. Give it a chance. Get this Season if you are a fan (if you have not seen ER get the 1st season first)and I promise that you will be glad you did.",1293667200,2,646,4.0546875
3655751,4,B001JAHQ1Q,"Season 14 was originally intended to be the last for ER. Thank God it wasn't.
One of the few positive effects of the 2007-2008 Hollywood Writers Strike was
delaying ER's demise so that this mediocre (by comparison to other seasons) year was not the way the most emmy nominated drama of all time signed off.

We'll never now how the second half of season 14 would've gone if there wasn't a writer's strike, but I can say with certainty that the first half of the season,
which was written pre-strike, wasn't up to the challenge of sending ER out
with a bang. Too many subplots are end abruptly and uneventfully (example, Archie's
relationship with Hope). Maura Tierney gets a great storyline with Abby
falling off the wagon (much harder than that wink and you miss it season 8 sub plot) and her performances are excellent. The problem is, the writers seem to put all their effort into that storyline, and don't balance it out enough with patient storylines or well developed arcs for the other characters. The 300th epsiode
is decent, but pales in comparison to other milestone ER episodes.

After the 300th episode, things improve somewhat. We get fantastic guest appearances by Gloria Rueben, Hal Holbrook and Steve Buscemi, and more fast paced medical storylines (the first ten episodes of season 14 are very soapy).

It's still an entertaining season. But I'm glad the writers strike gave
the pwoers that be some time to plan a stronger final season.",1285891200,32,1453,4.804

3655773,3,B001JAHQ1Q,Not nearly as good as seasons 1-10. But good TV show.,1504224000,,53,3.909090909090909
3655774,2,B001JAHQ1Q,"In a Very Bad Economy, our intrepid healing heroes turn the ridiculousness up to 11. With Kovac in Croatia to help his dying father, Abby snaps and re-starts drinking alcoholically. Boy are her beer goggles thick, because she hops right into bed with Terrible New Boss Stanley Tucci. I guess she's really turned on by all the efficient processes he's implementing, like stationing a doctor in the waiting room to make sure none of the sleeping drunks are bleeding into their brains. Abby is too busy being awkward & guilty to clue Tucci in to his son's apparent bipolar disorder. He soon drops everything to go help that son. It's unclear whether the ER keeps his new rules in place.

Abby & Kovac's baby, Joe, cries A LOT. Possibly he's just an empath, since he cries loudest with Neela, who's getting over losing two almost-boyfriends and healing from being trampled at a Grant Park rally. She's soon well enough to get overly attached to her patients, and overly flustered by her mouth-breathing teenage intern. Samantha goes back to her natural hair color, starts sewing the wild oats she missed as a teen mom, and mostly ignores or forgets about her troubled son at boarding school.

Gates gets banished to (work in) the ICU and comes back a changed man who does everything right. He has to use his powers for good, now that every other man on staff is a jerk. He gets Sara back from her grandparents, who suddenly realize they're too old to raise a teenager AND fight Gates for her custody. Morris fails all over the place, but he fits in well with the parade of insane patients. Pratt becomes a Grown Man and a real doctor, but he's mostly the same shambling grouch he's always been.

The show wants very badly for us to learn Valuable Lessons, but it also wants us to laugh, and it fails to reconcile the two, so we're mostly just horrified. This award-winning television has devolved into a variety show that needs a laugh track.",1503792000,2,1938,4.627906976744186

3655920,5,B001JAHQ1Q,"As other reviewers suggested, it's remarkable how an ER season can be made or broken by good guest appearances. This is a shortened season, cut to 19 episodes by the writer's strike. The first nine episodes are dominated by the guest appearance of Stanley Tucci as the new head of the ER, having been transferred from intensive care. In episode 9, Skye Wexler, another major guest star, takes over as temporary head of emergency medicine, and Dr. Pratt considers leaving County General.

After Tucci, the most important non-lead role is Leland Orser as Dr. Lucien Dubenko as chief of surgery. His presence is usually the only thing which makes Parminder Nagra's role as Dr. Neela Rasgotra interesting. She is one of the very few major characters who, for me,  tend to add to the mix of characters and plot.

Goran Visnjic and Maura Tierney are still the leads, but their roles are less important to the main action. The addition of  David Lyons as Dr. Simon Brenner spices things up around episode 14.

John Stamos' role grows in importance. But the biggest change with lead characters is Dr. Archie Morris' becoming a far more serious doctor, comparable to Pratt and Kovac as the ER's best attendings, even if, sometimes, he still appears to be a klutz.

Near the end of the season, Hal Holbrook appears as a guest. That is always a treat.

One of my constant aggravations on ER is that whenever one of the doctors or nurses shout's ""Call Security"", it seems as if Security never arrives, until the doctors, nurses, and clerks have already subdued the disturbance. One would think that the ER is one place where two security guards would be posted on a 24 hour basis. This season has just such an episode. It seems as if most in hospital scuffles could be put down in a few seconds if the guards were a few steps away.

The last episode of the season ends with a great cliff-hanger, and an appearance by one of my favorite actors, Steve Buscemi.",1390608000,,1946,4.636627906976744
3655941,1,B001JAHQ1Q,"ER has been the ""as-real-as-you-can-get"" series on what really happening in the emergency room. As a RN, I have experienced the trauma and thrills of working in ER myself, which is why this series is a ""almost"" spot on.

However, the sad news is Season 14 and 15 is by far the worse of the lot because there is lots of ""sex"" and ""skin"" showing in this series. From what's found in the internet, the writers decided to change the storyline approach and approach it like ""Grey's Anatomy"" (another hit tv series) instead. This severely put off the realness and seriousness of the series.

If you really love ER for what it almost truly represents then my advice is stay away from these last 2 seasons, they're not worth buying nor watching. I found myself reading a book while letting the episodes run.",1388188800,6,799,4.580419580419581

3655985,5,B001JAHQ1Q,"My three favorite shows of all time are The Twilight Zone, The Fugitive, and ER.  I had already purchased every episode of TZ and The Fugitive on DVD, and had all but the last two seasons of ER on DVD.  About two weeks ago, I was scanning through Amazon.com and found Season 14 of ER for about $17 and Season 15 at the regular price of $39.  I decided to bite the bullet and buy both seasons.  I'm not in the medical field, but I remember staying up on a Thursday night, knowing I'd be paying for it the next morning at work, just to watch this great show.  My series is complete.  I want to thank Amazon for making a little bit of it less expensive (similar to a medical co-payment - LOL-) and thank you for the cast and crew of this wonderful show for making medicine so friendly, yet believable.",1330732800,,798,4.183006535947713

3655989,5,B001JAHQ1Q,"A good send-off to a medical series that was one of the best shows ever!  Brought back a lot of characters from earlier in the series, everyone from Ross, Greene, Hathaway, and even dreaded Rocket Romano in a 'flashback'.

Honestly, if you've been the previous seasons and enjoyed them, you'll be extremely happy with this season.  Characters that left the show coming back for bit pieces within the season and some (Carter) with a small story arc, characters leaving.  It's all a very good tie up for the series.  My only wish is that they had done some kind of gag reel for the complete series with some new clips as this season didn't have any gag reel whatsoever.",1316995200,,667,4.571428571428571
