8221636,4,6303937802,"I have seen this film and wanted to purchase it, but it seems difficult to find.  I am actually from the hometown of the author of the book that this movie is based and am very proud of the fact.  James Oliver Curwood is such  a great author.  I recommend his writings.  This movie does an excellent  job of giving the feel for the environments in the film and I definately  recommend it for those that interested in period pieces such as the  Klondike gold rush, etc.",937526400,4,468,4.2988505747126435
