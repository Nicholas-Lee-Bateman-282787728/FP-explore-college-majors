3712091,5,B001NA1W2G,"After many years of study within the Hermetic arts and Alchemy, this is the most complete explanation of the physical aspect of Alchemy that I have found and this film covers the field in all of its aspects, an EXCELLENT piece of work!  Now, just wait for the next installment, Solve Et Coagula, and you will have all the tools necessary to complete the Great Work!",1290470400,2,365,4.53030303030303
3712092,4,B001NA1W2G,"Good documentary about alchemy, the ancient and mystery art.
I recommend it for someone who is interested in the history of chemistry.
Nevertheless, there are some other documentaries more complete in serious historical aspects of alchemy.",1264809600,2,239,5.666666666666667
3712093,5,B001NA1W2G,"This DVD is a production and collection of the truths behind the ancient practice of alchemy. It presents the subject in a way anyone would understand and enjoy.  Included is historical information about its roots as well as biographical information about the major players in the lost but emerging art. The graphics are beautiful and truly assist in understanding this subject which dates back almost to the beginning of civilization. I now understand its place in today's modern science, as well as today's practice in the Art of Alchemy after watching this DVD - Thank you! I would recommend this DVD to anyone seeking the truth about this subject!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alchemy-Sacred-Secrets-Revealed/dp/B001NA1W2G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alchemy - Sacred Secrets Revealed</a>",1231891200,3,831,6.163793103448276
3712094,5,B001NA1W2G,"I enjoyed this DVD a lot!  It provides good insight into what alchemy really is, where it comes from, and the different stages/steps of progression in the quest for the Philosopher's Stone.  Luxor Media did a great job of presenting esoteric material in a way that makes it easy to understand to the inquisitive seeker.  It also shined light on and demystified a lot of artwork that I have seen but never understood.  The DVD connected the alchemists of old with some modern day seekers like Carl Jung and Terence Mckenna.  Keep up the great work!  You have a happy customer!",1230854400,5,575,4.643564356435643
3712095,5,B001NA1W2G,I total enjoy Alchemy - Sacred Secretes Revealed.  I watched it twice and plan to watch it again.  It has deepen my understanding of The Ancient Secret of the Flower of Life by Drunvalo Melchizedek and Ancient Geometry.,1395187200,,219,4.7368421052631575
3712096,4,B001NA1W2G,"lots of information, yet it all connected in such a way that made sense,so it wasn't ""too much"". watched twice",1389744000,,110,4.55
3712097,2,B001NA1W2G,Bored me to the hilt. Sacred secrets? What sacred secrets were revealed? This left me skipping ahead a lot. The dictionary did a better job of explaining alchemy.,1384819200,,162,4.821428571428571
3712098,5,B001NA1W2G,"The information in this video is right on the money.  You'll get a lot out of this if you watch it, and if you are interested in discovering who you are, or unlocking your true potential, the signposts in this video will be very helpful.",1384732800,,237,4.266666666666667
3712099,3,B001NA1W2G,The production values are really low.  There is some really irritating music loop in the background that you have to get past.,1380499200,2,126,4.7272727272727275
3712100,5,B001NA1W2G,"Every time I watch this I learn something new. It caters to many different aspects of the mind. Truly brilliant to see the allegory tied to practicing alchemy. Alchemists weren't trying to transmute for material gain, but it was an allegorical way to explain mental enlightenment. I definitely recommend this documentary to the open minded truth seeker.",1380067200,4,353,5.2105263157894735
3712101,5,B001NA1W2G,I highly recommend this movie as it provides the basic understanding towards achieving a higher state of consciousness and embodying that state.  It is explains the principles of alchemy from an earthly and spiritual perspective.  Very insightful.  Enjoy!,1377388800,4,255,5.657894736842105
3712102,5,B001NA1W2G,"Changed my understanding of what alchemy truly is. The presentation is not the best, but the information contained is well worth sitting through it.",1375488000,3,148,5.208333333333333
3712103,4,B001NA1W2G,"If you've been studying this for a while this is a nice wrap up. I'd like to know if the do loop on the beat was ""engineered"" in a tone to drill the information into the subconscious - or if he was throwing his pal a bone to do the music - I found it annoying.",1370736000,2,260,3.6607142857142856
3712104,5,B001NA1W2G,"Alchemy-Sacred Secrets Revealed, is actually part one of a two part series on Alchemy. It is good and full of rare alchemical images. The producer and main narrator, Josh Garrett, speaks about the need to make esoteric knowledge available to all seekers and he believes esoteric knowledge should not be the exclusive property of the Vatican and Secret/Magical/Fraternal Orders. Josh states this was the purpose for making this DVD.

The DVD is very comprehensive and you should probably watch it more than once to refresh your memory and to see something you may have missed the first time. Josh starts the narration by stating you are being ""Self Initiated into the Sacred Mysteries."" Next, a historical survey of Alchemy is given; starting from Ancient Egypt to the Greeks who ruled Egypt for 300 years during the Ptolemaic Dynasty. Topics covered, include: Hellenistic Egypt, Hermeticism, Thoth, Maat, Hermes Trismegistus, the Emerald Tablet, Isaac Newton, the 7 major operations of Alchemical Transformation, the 4 Elements, the 7 Primary Metals, the 3 Primes, and much, much, more.

I highly recommend this DVD for all sincere seekers and the second one in the series entitled, ""Solve Et Coagula-The Great Work of Alchemy."" Buy them today!!!",1364601600,7,1246,5.1940298507462686

8323365,1,B001NA1W2G,"the movie was terrible. It is just someone talking on and on with nothing to back up what they're saying. Anyone can say anything, it doesn't make it true.",1469577600,,155,4.379310344827586

8323367,2,B001NA1W2G,"It's got good information - but I was really hoping for an engrossing and relaxing experience. While it does contain good info the narrator's voice is very tense and with little enthusiasm or expression - it really ruined it for me. I turned it off after about 20 minutes as the experience of hearing his voice was so jarring. I could sit through it if I had to learn this stuff for a class or something, but not for an evening of enjoyment and fulfilling my curiosity. If you've spent all the effort to put together a seemingly well-researched and well-thought-out documentary, why not put in a bit of effort to find a narrator whose voice is nice to listen to?",1444694400,,662,4.479338842975206
8323368,2,B001NA1W2G,Would be more enlightening if they chose a music score that didn't sound like it belonged to the Friday the 13th movie!,1433203200,,119,4.454545454545454
8323369,5,B001NA1W2G,"A very interesting introduction to the lost art of alchemy. The pictures are the real deal. The material moves very fast so it is challenging to the mind to follow it.  This is the precise fact that makes it very effective. You can't hold onto this stuff in the mind anyway. Thought it was very well done. For anyone interested in this ancient form of inquiry into the vast depths of the human psyche and creation itself, this is a very short and formal presentation that strikes at the heart of what alchemy is all about. This is not for the faint of heart, as it will challenge many beliefs about the nature of Reality. But if one is truly interested, buckle your seatbelts, because you are in for quite a ride.",1424736000,,713,4.401515151515151

8323372,2,B001NA1W2G,"There's information here, but you can get the same information for $2.99 from your local used book store down the road. The ""movie"" is composed not of interviews or demonstrations or the like, but a series of slides while Ben Stein's long lost son reads narration from a card. I want my money back. I'm calling shenanigans. The only reason it's getting two starts instead of one is because it's actually giving you some information.",1396396800,3,432,4.773333333333333
8323373,5,B001NA1W2G,"I like that this program gets right to the material that I need to study. I can watch it over and over like textbook material to memorize. I have found it to be very informative and comprehensive on the subject. I've re-watched this one repeatedly and have it downloaded to my Kindle for unexpected study moments. Sometimes a documentary is great when it's like a movie, but sometimes it's great to have just the pertinent information. If this weren't so compact, I'd have to make notecards.",1395273600,,491,4.72093023255814
