Wish it was on dvd however.",1514937600,,202,3.8780487804878048
7858061,5,6303974678,"The girl Aurora has difficulty maintaining the perfect silence the authorities have imposed on the kingdom - she's not really rebellious, but she has a talent for not quite fitting in, and she's definitely the curious type. So when she meets a mysterious gypsy woman (Patti Lupone, a perfect cast) and discovers the magical beauty of music it's no wonder that she gets into major conflict with the establishment.

This is an adventure movie of the finest sort without needing flashy effects a la Golden Compass, it is a beautifully acted and designed movie with enchanting characters that warms the heart, yet keeps you glued to your seat. Highest recommendation - absolutely unbelievable that this gem was never issued on DVD!",1291939200,,727,5.008264462809917
7858062,5,6303974678,"Such an engaging production should have tracks on the internet, but I can't find any to speak of. The child actors were some of the best ever, but what have they done since?  No photos, no credits to speak of.  Brent Carver was riveting in every one of his scenes, and when he sang, (for about two seconds)I thought it was heavenly beyond words.  I loved the hand made costumes, the location used, the wintery scenery and the sets.  A lot of love was put into this production. The sound track music with the viola and harp was so beautiful but it cannot be found. I found the movie on ""on demand"" and watched it about six times, now I've bought the VHS tape (wish it was on DVD, it might later be found on RHI Productions, Inc, downloads (I think they might rotate them, not sure). A highly recommended family film.",1248480000,,815,4.342105263157895
7858063,5,6303974678,"This movie only comes in VHS but what a movie it is. I saw it years ago with my children and they loved it so this Christmas I bought it for my daughter and we watched it again and were happy once more.
It is the story of a town that doesn't allow noise of anykind to the point of extremes, like making your boots quiet. Then into town comes a woman that was expelled many years ago because she sang and that was noise. All the people in the old days were sent to a town far away for making noise, but she comes back because she promised a man that she would bring a gift to his grand daughter. This causes a uproar in the town and things get interesting. You find out in the end why the king made a silent law. All works out and every one is happy.",1199577600,2,749,3.9019607843137254

7858067,5,6303974678,"I'd never heard of it, never seen it and happened upon it from simple curiousity. One of the best moves I've ever made! It's simple and beautiful in it's simplicity - I can't wait to find it for purchase! My husband is a  musician and we LOVE music - I can't recommend this highly enough!
