7869504,5,6304392524,"It wasn't long after when this film was released that countless sequels were inspired but had little to do with the original. To capitalize on the success of Angel there were many films with the title ""Angel"" in  them (""Angel Force"", ""Angel Terminators"" and  ""Killer Angels"" just to name a few)but this one was the start of  it all; the girls with guns genre. Hong Kong turned out many of these films  and had a rabid cult following that is still going strong. The best years  from this genre were 1988-1995.
The orignal title for this movie when it  was first released was ""Iron Angels"" which later became  ""Angel"" for video release. It stars two of the greatest Girls  with Guns actresses, Moon Lee and Yukari Oshima (Cynthia Luster). Moon  plays a part of a special group of undercover operatives called The Iron  Angels. When police destroy an opium field, the druglords seek revenge by  methodically killing off the police force one by one. That's when the Iron  Angels are called in.
What I really enjoyed most about this film is the  final fight between Moon & Yukari. One of the most brutal and vicious  fights ever. I've never seen two actresses plummel each other like they did  here. That scene alone makes this video worth buying.",963619200,9,1242,4.658986175115207
