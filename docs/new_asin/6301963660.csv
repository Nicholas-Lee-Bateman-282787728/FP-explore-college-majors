382377,3,6301963660,"I am not a huge 2001/Arthur C. Clarke fan, however I did enjoy this movie. I would recommend it if you are into Sci-Fi at all.
I would like to point out two things, though: When people watch the movie in the year 2010, it  will seem very goofy to think that America and the USSR will be about to go  to war... considering that that latter won't have existed for 20 years.  Finally, this movie has a problem where in several scenes the spaceships  have a ""halo"" around them. I think that this is caused by the  clear film that surrounded the space ship pieces when they were glued onto  the starfield background. I am not saying that this problem is unique to  the DVD, but it is present on the DVD and is a little annoying.  I know  that old Star Wars videos had this problem, but Lucas has since cleaned  them up.  The process of converting 2010 to DVD might have been a good time  to fix this problem, but that opportunity appears to have been missed.",918950400,,953,4.233333333333333

382550,1,6301963660,"I am a serious 2001 fan and I really looked forward to seeing a professional take on the loose ends Kubrick left at the end of the movie. But, it was awful. In the 9 years that pass in the movie, technology has somehow decreased. And in the 16 years that passed between filming of the two movies, effects technology appears to have been similarly affected.
The casting for Dr. Floyd was awful. Not to say the acting wasn't decent by Scheider, but he is literally nothing at all like the original Dr. Floyd.
The last problem I feel like discussing is this Cold War Anti Russian rhetoric that was forced into the film. Seeing as it was filmed in the 80s I can't say I'm terribly surprised. But it really takes away from the movie as a whole. If i wanted to watch a movie about Soviet-US tensions I would have chosen The Hunt for Red October.
Overall it feels like a classic Hollywood attempt to make an easy buck. Weird flashbacks to the original for the fans, and lame 80s Cold War action for everybody else. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone wanting a quality sequel to 2001.",1500249600,,1083,4.393034825870647
382551,1,6301963660,"The movie is what it is. Never mind that. The problem is the DVD release. The box claims ""enhanced for widescreen tvs"", which implies anamorphic video. But the transfer is not anamorphic. It is letterboxed in a 4:3 format, equivalent to the 1998 DVD release. Just terrible.

I thought this was going to be a new transfer, since the DVD release date is listed as Nov. 9 2010. But they are just putting the same old garbage in new packages. Apparently the blu-ray release is a new transfer. But they could not be bothered to re-encode the DVD release. Infuriating.

And why does this packaging error persist? It is a known problem going back years. See the wikipedia page for the film, where the problem with the DVD releases is discussed.

Or is it just the usual problem with amazon, wherein you never know exactly what you are going to get because they cannot seem to figure out how to label the different product releases in a meaningful way. The world may never know. Sigh.",1497916800,,976,4.565714285714286

382705,5,6301963660,"2010, sequel to the inconquerable 2001 . . . almost impossible to surpass or be a legit sequel.

The book 2010 is a great sequel to 2001.  Some differences between the books is the Europa scenes.  In the 2010 book, a Chinese space vessel gets inadvertently swamped by a Europa ice-plant. There's some other differences; but, overall, the movie follows the book pretty well.

About the only parts I really didn't like . . . and should have worked, like it did in the book . . . is the Dolphins in the home scene.

The movie opens with a review of 2001, and a good sequence of scenes from the New Mexico radio interferometer, where a Russian meets Floyd, who's cleaning and taking care of the radio wave astronomy antennas. The scene highlights how different the science worlds are from the political worlds. The theme comes up a few more times I the movie.

The second scene, before they go to space is Heyward Floyd with his replacement talking in front of the white house.  Once again, Arthur C. Clarke is highlighting how the political world is wasting humanities time and getting in the way of science.

The third scene is when Dr Chandra is talking to Hal's female voiced successor.  This is a great scene showing the intellectual, rational spirit.

Then comes the dolphin in the house pool scene(if I'm remembering correctly, from the movie, the house is in Hawaii).  I didn't think the kid was all that cute, and the wife wasn't that great(throw no fault of the actor).  This scene was changed from the book.  In the book, a government official comes to the house to share some top secret documents.

Then we go to the space scenes. They're first going past Europa. There's a great scene where Heyward Floyd is going over the Europa data with the Russian crew.  He's like ""I remember a process, where I ask questions, you ask questions . . . I think I read that in a manual some where!"".  The Russians are acting up.  I find this scene to be a great dramatization of the difference between open minded science types and non-scientists. This and a later scene where Heyward Floyd and Tanya are talking alone in the spaceship  They end up looking out the window.  Tanya is still very military minded and says, ""Floyd, you're not very practical"".  Heyward replies with ""look out there, tell me what practical is."" These are two of the most underrated scenes in the movie, for sure.

The spaceship and crew, after the Europa scene then go through aerobraking in Jupiter's atmosphere.  An idea that was innovated at the time of the movies making. There's an o.k. human scene of Floyd with a Russian female crew member.  They're both mature enough to know that they are just bracing through the aerobreaking procedure.  And that, they are not thinking about anything sexual.  The movie has two other really good humanistic/mature scenes in David Bowman, as a transuman, going to see his still alive former wife/girlfriend. His girlfriend is now very old, been through life, and is kind of done with her life.  She's just waiting out her last days in a nursing home. David Bowman is glad that she found a good man after his supposed death out in Jupiter(Saturn in the book). Then, later, David Bowman visits his comatose mother.  He has her pass away in her sleep - a quiet painless death.

- The movies special affects may, on a first viewing, not seem very good.  The special affects of the spacecraft out in space seems to me mix some kind of corny scenes with some good space scenes which shows the depth and mystery of space. It takes some paying attention to.

Due to politics on Earth, the American crew and Russians are ordered to separate themselves in the different(American and Russian) spacecraft. During this time, David Bowman shows up and meets Heyward Floyd.  This is a pretty good spooky scene.  David Bowman relates that they need to leave the Jupiter system, because ""something wonderful"" is going to happen. Heyward Floyd manages to convince(partly due to a disappearing monolith) the Russians to hook up the two spacecraft(because, otherwise, they wouldn't have enough fuel to 1) get away from Jupiter, and 2) get back home). To everyone's surprise Jupiter collapses, due to an exponential growth of the monolith eating up Jupiter and increasing it's mass enough to turn Jupiter into a star.

The movie ends with a message from the Aliens that ""all these worlds are yours, Except our new Europa experiment.  Attempt no landing there.""  Then, there's a good scene of Europa turned into a life paradise and a Monolith standing some lake.

Overall, the movie grows on you(including the space scenery).",1491868800,,4618,4.721598002496879

382802,5,6301963660,"Of course, this a dated movie.  But it has become eerily relevant now that the U.S. and Russia could be considered close to the brink.

That aside, 2001 was a colossal failure as a science fiction movie that might add anything resembling a human elemant to science fiction.  It seems that Hyams, the Director of 2010, got that.

So 2010 was all about human interaction.  And the wonderful tension and dialogue he set up between the Russians and Americans trapped aboard a space mission to Jupiter, as the then Soviet Union and United States were on the verge of World War 3 was absolutely precious, not to mention an astute introductory lesson on critical words in Russian for Americans to learn.

There should be an award for best opening scenes in movies, and the opening scene in 2010 is the absolute best I have ever watched in any movie ever.  It is authentic, clever, humorous, a zinger in terms of laying bare what countries do to each other in spying, and just plain the best in movie art.

And best of all, (spoiler alert) for those who watched 2001, IT WASN'T HAL'S FAULT.  It was those creeps in the NSA who screwed up the first mission to Jupiter!

This movie makes me weep with joy and sadness every time I see it, and I only wish there was a higher intelligence out there somewhere in the universe who can save us now from ourselves, now that we find ourselves close to the situation postulated in 2010.

Physical locations, physical sets, in-camera effects...the lost art of Art Direction and Set Design.

2010: The Year We Make Contact is not 2001: A Space Odyssey.

Ok. That's out of the way.

Peter Weir is not Stanley Kubrick - and no one ever will be again.

With those caveats out of the way, 2010 is a thoroughly enjoyable film. Immersive. Tactile. You feel the tension, the claustrophobia, the physical and political reality. Characters - not a terribly important element of Kubrick's earlier film - are fleshed out and given room to move, breathe, grow. Roy Scheider and Keir Dullea are fantastic. Helen Mirren is PHENOMENAL. Bob Balaban is at the top of his game. Candice Bergen makes a wonderful sister to the iconic HAL 9000 with her performance as SAL 9000.

Dave Bowman, HAL 9000, and the Discovery One return. As does the Monolith and the Starchild. Roy Scheider takes over the role of Heywood Floyd.

Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke cameo.

Separate yourself from the singularly original and game-changing 2001: A Space Odyssey and view 2010 not as a sequel but as a standalone parallel film and your experience will be fulfilling.

This was one of Roy Scheider's better roles, and the rest of the cast was excellent including Helen Mirren and John Lithgow. I also appreciated Arthur C.

And considering the ""original"" is 2001, A Space Odyssey (pretty much the Citizen Kane or Gone With The Wind of Scify) then it's probably not even a fair comparison.  2001 is the space movie upon who's shoulders stand all other space movies.  With 2010, gone are so many of the elements that made 2001 so amazing.  Gone is the creepy.  And gone is that lonely feeling of being trapped out in space with only your breathing to listen to.

382877,5,6301963660,"Watching this movie reminds me of why I don't care to watch Star Wars. True science fiction does not involve outer space car chases and bang bang shoot 'em up battles, one after the other. It's hard to criticize this movie because it is masterfully done in terms of special effects (1984!!)
and full of thought provoking sequences which are difficult to anticipate any viewer unfamiliar with the book. In other words, like the original film 2001, there is a presumption by the director that the viewer is willing to be left with little idea of why things are happening as they unfold and after they transpire as well without the need to constantly have their hand held. If I were to change anything, I'd do away with some of Flynn's diary-like narratives explaining things . Yes, without those explanations there would have been much room for interpretation for the viewer and therefore controversy about whether such reflection was profound or contrived- that lack of explanation created as a device by the film makers-, but again, watching this movie served as a confirmation to me personally that the current so called Sci-Fi genre is mostly a bunch of earthly drama and car chase scenes only taking place in space. I will say that presently, Ridley Scott who is heavily influenced by the films 2001 and 2010 at least TRIES to put some Sci-Fi out there! By the way, Helen Mirren' acting is amazing and the general interaction and dialogue between all of the astronauts seems very genuine and natural for the most part. As an aside and I don't mean to be self serving, I am the inventor of a device that allows one to see the stars in real time in 3D through a telescope as well as a specialized binocular.  A review of my 3D invention was done by Dr. Mike Reynolds, astronomy professor at Jacksonville in the May 2016 issue of Astronomy Magazine. When he first viewed globular cluster M13 in Hercules using my device, he wrote this: ""I just keep thinking of the book 2001: A Space Odyssey: ""Oh my God, It's full of stars!""  I was very pleased that he experienced such wonder by viewing the night sky with my 3D device. My final thought is that my own sense of  'wonder' is what this movie evoked. The mystery and beauty of the Universe should always evoke a sense of wonder, firstly and foremost.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Space-Walker-3D-Binoculars/dp/B01IAAYWPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Space Walker 3D Binoculars</a>",1480809600,,2467,4.9397590361445785

I found Roy Scheider's interpretation of Dr. Heywood Floyd to be particularly disappointing; too crass, too unnuanced, too ""in your face."" William Sylvester did a much better job in ""2001."" So glib and insouciant, just the kind of person who would collaborate in a government cover-up.

382949,4,6301963660,"While 2001 was more of art piece, this movie is a more traditional sci-fi flick.  There's far more dialog, there's a readily obvious and dare I say predictable plot as well as a few bits of romance for good measure.  I personally enjoy the futurism of sci-fi films and unfortunately I think 2010 is a massive step backwards compared to 2001.  The attention to subtle detail and presentation of technology was extremely well executed in 2001, where as 2010 tries way too hard and ends up being corny.  I can't help but feel 2010 really tries to push political agenda of the 1980's where as 2001 does allude to political unrest and even with the same antagonists it's crafted far more around profound mankind issues and not just dragging out cold war sentiments.

Ignoring the connection to 2001 and treating the film on its own merits, it is a good story and keeps you engaged.  Its relatable and offers multiple angles of character development.  It does have the space travel in the future science fiction feel.

382992,5,6301963660,"My original thoughts: ""This is a totally inept and unnecessary sequel to ""2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY."" Director Peter Hyams continues to demonstrate his predilection for mediocrity. This film is a total inversion of the original. Stanley Kubrick's vision of the future that he established in the original is totally scraped and revamped in this second film for no good reason other than dollar signs. I suppose the producers of this film thought that approach would have been too cerebral for the 80's audiences. Kubrick created a sterile environment for his astronauts of the future. Here we see a continuing trend in films to create a lived in and grimy environment for space travelers. Kubrick's astronauts were the consummate professionals. They were the clean-shaven, cool headed, clear thinking professionals. They were never verbose going off into unnecessary dissertations on baseball and hotdogs and mustard like occurs in this film. Kubrick's astronauts restricted their dialogue to the requirements necessary to complete the mission successfully. Verbosity has always been a trademark in Hyams' films and a detriment to his abilities as a director and screenwriter in my humble opinion. Verbosity runs rampant in this film and it becomes nauseating to the point where I often turn this movie off. John Lithgow's Walter Curnow is the guiltiest of this. Roy Scheider is totally miscast as Dr. Heywood Floyd. Of coarse the character of Floyd is scripted entirely wrong in this film, so you really can not blame Scheider. William Sylvester's performance as Floyd in the original was one of the most realistic performances ever given by an actor up till then. I never once saw a review even mentioning his performance. That was a shame. Bob Balaban as Dr. Chandra seemed totally unnecessary and not believable. That character was a mistake. It's hard to believe that Arthur C. Clarke had some collaborative input on this film. I will admit that it was good to see Keir Dullea reappear as Dave Bowman for purely sentimental reasons. Helen Mirren as the Soviet Tanya Kirbuk gave a somewhat acceptable performance. It was dramatic but contained enough stoicism to be believable. My biggest complaint however with this film and it my seem trivial, was the presence of sound in outer space. The images in the original 2001of massive spacecraft floating in space traveling at incredible speeds all to either dead silence or majestic musical accompaniment was deafening. Who can ever forget the image of Gary Lockwood as astronaut Frank Poole grasping for air hurtling into deep space after Hal 9000 has cut his airline? Again this scene was played to dead silence and still lingers in my memory. That is a tribute to the concept of pure cinema. And remember Peter there is no sound in the vacuum of space.""

But times change and time affects many things. 2010: THE YEAR WE MAKE CONTACT deserves another look. Yes, 2010: THE YEAR WE MAKE CONTACT deserves another look. It has a totally different look and feel and tone from Stanley Kubrick's 1968 classic 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. It has been a while since 2010: THE YEAR WE MAKE CONTACT was released. I always felt that the emphasis was more on characters and political ideology than plot in this squeal. It is interesting that the politics of the Soviets and Western powers have totally changed. The film is nostalgic, I suppose, in that regard. And speaking of nostalgia, it was interesting to see the Discovery ship in a tumbling orbit around Jupiter. I really wanted to revisit this film. I thought there was so much wrong with it at the time of its release. I guess I am a bit soft and just wanted to take another look.

383087,2,6301963660,"I saw Kubrick's film what it was in the theater, and I adored it. I kept delaying watching the sequel until this week.  I bought it as a part of a three pack Blu-ray sale. The only comment I will add about the quality of the DVD is that this version lacked subtitles which I have come to need, and no list of scenes. Compared to Kubrick's movie, this one was like going to a one and a half star hotel after having stayed in a five-star hotel. It lacked the sophistication  and deep mystery of 2001. I also thought that the set of the ship where there were banks of hundreds of multicolored lights looked garish; and the inane position that Helen Mirren was put in, where she acted as the tough, decisive, bold Russian commander, who was an office of and loyal to the army and to her nation. Based on this stance, despite dire warnings, she orders one of her crew to go out to examine the monolith. But when he is killed, she falls apart, acting weak, confused, and crying. It would have been more in character if she had maintained this tough exterior, even if privately she was devastated. Then, there was a To Russia with Love scene when the Russian cutie seeks out Roy Scheider to hold her while the ship is going through an exercise that could destroy it. On in a different note, I was intrigued to see that two important features in the multi book series The Expanse were foreshadowed in this movie. The first is the lure of Jupiter, a place that seems to harbor deep mystery. The second is the rather transcendent, not of this world, figure that the original pilot, David, occupies in this film.  He is made up of the essence of the man that is not the man any longer; and that also is true of one of the characters in The Expanse, Miller the detective who is taken up by the mysterious, ruthless life force.",1466812800,,1814,4.329411764705882

The US and Russia are about to start the Last War Ever over some kind of proxy war in Honduras (remember what the US was doing in Central America in the 1980s? No? Go look into it). Oh, wait, it's 2010 and we're STILL at it! So much for the human species.

So, realpolitik being what is was/is, the rival space agencies - US v USSR (remember, the USSR still existed in 1984) - want to get to Jupiter to find out what happened in 2001 when the USS Discovery mission failed. Things are changing and no one has enough time and expertise to get done what needs to get done. Forced to cooperate by external realities, the US sends a crew along on the USSR spacecraft. International cooperation is no less fraught in space than along the coast of Honduras.

Meanwhile, our Alien Overlords have a little something up their sleeve (assuming they even have arms, which they may not since the only thing we know about them if The Monolith, a 1x4x9 slab of something unknown and unknowable). It becomes clear that whatever the Alien Overlords may look like they have a temper capable of being triggered whenever a human tries to touch their stuff.

This film is NOTHING like its predecessor. It's probably a good thing that they didn't even try to be like 2001.

For me, this film did not age well. The esthetics of 1980s Hollywood film making are all to front and center in this piece.

All in all, I'd give it a ""meh.""",1466121600,,1453,4.386617100371748

So I didn't bother seeing 2010 until yesterday. Wow! They shouldn't have waited so many years to explain it all. I was hooked because Helen Mirren is one of my favorites (we are the same age), and I wanted to see her 1984 self. I thought this movie captures what is was like to be inside a space ship just as well as the new Star Treks, also what it was like to be riding with rockets propelling you, the dangers of space, the problems of making decisions where someone might get killed, the mistrust of the Russians and the Americans (nothing changed there). How is it that this movie didn't make more than a blip on the radar screen? I'm going back to watch the two (2001 and 2010) together. I think I'll get a lot more out of 2001 now.

383598,3,6301963660,"Movies are not books. I bought this in anticipation of watching as soon as I finished reading the book. My anticipation was swiftly curtailed.

The basic synopsis: In order to claim the rights to the Discovery, left behind in 2001 by astronaut Dave Bowman, a couple of Americans hitch a ride on a Soviet spaceship (sound familiar) to check on Discovery and, more importantly, HAL, the Daisy singing AI/computer of ill repute.

For the time this came out (1984), I suppose this might have seemed cutting edge graphics wise. Thirty years later, though, it seems rather crude. I think even for the time, though, the graphics seemed more an afterthought.

Ah, but the story, that's where the strength of the movie lies, you might be voicing to yourself. Only in comparison to everything else might it seem the strong point, but it's still a 90-pound weakling. It seems the movie was made to serve someone's agenda as a commentary on Soviet-US relations.

Forget being a bad translation of the book. This was an uninspired followup to the stunning piece of work that is 2001 (not a perfect film, but pretty darn good-to-excellent). There was no sense of wonder to anything happening in this film, no extension of intellectual curiosity raised in the previous movie. This really seemed more a fifth or sixth sequel in quality.

In relation to the book, there is a wealth of imagery and plot wholly ignored by the movie creators, much to the detriment of the viewers. Having read the third book (2061), were Hollywood to decide to continue the story, the movie 2010 would have to be ""re-imagined"" because the current incarnation cut the whole thing off at the knees and blocked future development in any good or reasonable manner.

The story certainly deserves to be more than just a piece of propaganda.",1448582400,,1797,4.818181818181818

The original 2001 is (was) a unique movie.  It was groundbreaking and sort of timeless (yes, it's dated but somehow rises above it).  It's hard to capture the magic again and it's hard for me to explain exactly what I mean.  2010 just feels too much a product of its time; it's very dated and doesn't feel special.  It's just a movie, you see it and you forget about it.  And the special effects of 2001, despite being much older, look much better.  Having just watched it, I'm not sure if I want to think about it and what it adds to the original story or I if I just want to purge it from my memory ASAP.",1444089600,,618,4.108333333333333

This movie was unfairly panned by the critics, who wanted another classic, another 2001: A Space Odyssey. If they had read Clarke's novels, they would have known it followed the second novel in the series very well. Something else to consider is that the late, great Stanley Kubrick was not the director. I would recommend the film because, as a sequel, it addresses and answers (to some degree of satisfaction) the questions and mysteries of the 1968 classic.",1443484800,,539,4.806451612903226

384094,4,6301963660,"In 2010 experts on Earth are still pondering the fate of the Discovery One mission to Jupiter nine years earlier. After encountering the mysterious Monolith in Jovian orbit, astronaut David Bowman disappeared leaving the derelict Discovery spacecraft in orbit with the deactivated HAL 9000 computer. Meanwhile, the Soviets are planning their own mission to Jupiter and there is no way for the Americans to beat them there. Despite increasing Cold War tensions, the Soviet Union agrees to take three Americans, Dr. Heywood Floyd (Roy Scheider), engineer Dr. Curnow (John Lithgow), and computer expert Dr. Chandra (Bob Balaban), along with them to Jupiter to figure out just what happened.

Based on the novel 2010: Odyssey Two by Arthur C. Clarke, this movie continues the story started in the monumental 2001: A Space Odyssey. Stanley Kubrick did not return to work on this film and it is directed by Peter Hyams instead. It would be unfair to compare this movie to 2001 too much, despite the fact that is a sequel. 2010 lacks a lot of the poetic beauty and memorable film making that Kubrick's 2001 had. Instead of a unique movie experience, what we get is a more standard science fiction movie. Those hoping for something on par with 2001 may be disappointed, but the average science fiction fan will probably enjoy it.

Overall, this movie is a pretty entertaining adventure with neat special effects that look pretty good on Blu-ray. The scenes at Jupiter look especially good with the Jovian environment given a sort of mysterious and eerie feeling. The acting is generally good all around. As a plus, Keir Dullea and Douglas Rain reprise their roles as Bowman and HAL 9000, respectively. One of the negatives of this movie is the horribly dated Cold War overtones which takes some of speculative fiction out of this and make it more of a period piece.

I felt that this is a decent science fiction movie that can be enjoyed on its own merits. It may not be 2001, but it is entertaining.",1440892800,,1992,4.835777126099707

384280,4,6301963660,"***This review is for the DVD. 2010: The Year We Make Contact (1984) is basically a sequel of 2001 that tries to tie up the loose ends left from its predecessor. Of course, 2001 and its symbolism left us to give our own interpretations of what we think happened or will happen years later. Roy Scheider (The French Connection, Jaws) stars as Dr. Heywood Floyd, and does a stellar job. I will say that casting him as Dr. Floyd took some getting used to, but by the middle of the movie, I was on board (no pun intended). Something to note about this movie that is sort of funny in a way: At times, it seemed like Kubrick's mid-sixties special effects were better than this movie, even though this one came out 16 years later, which I guess is a testament to Kubrick's mastery as a filmmaker and innovator. Also, if 2001 was known as a movie scarce in dialogue, then 2010 should be known as a movie with an abundance of dialogue. This movie has tons of dialogue, so I guess it all averages out. Overall, this movie is certainly a must-have for fans of 2001, or the science fiction genre. The special features aren't anything to brag about (just a documentary), but this review is really about the movie. 2010 is a movie with a nice pace, good acting, and tells a good story.",1437091200,8,1271,4.389830508474576

Beyond that however, the story takes far too great liberties with the book. The film injects the cheap US/Soviet politics of the mid-80s, while the book states the far more probable space capabilities of the Chinese.

Because THIS one's better made than most films of  today. It immediately draws you into it's web of intrigue. You know within 10 or 12 minutes that some serious trouble is on it way to us. We know this because of an alien artifact found. Then there's the gray cloud of ""fear/tension/bad vibes"" of worry over the previous crew that had made the same trip to Jupiter,and they totally disappeared!.  I hope this is OK to paste in here,because it's a great way of describing this movie. I had been looking for a list of actors/actresses and went to IMDb through my Roku connected TV.That's when I decided to also read the reviews and discussions of others who have watched it.

 **CAUTION SPOILER ALERT!!**  These 2 reviews from IMDb, CONTAIN SEVERAL SPOILERS>> The phrase ""My God, it's full of stars"" was not a part of the film 2001, but was a part of the novel. In the novel, the ""star gate"" monolith was found on the surface of Saturn's moon Japetus (or Iapetus), rather than floating in space near Jupiter. As Bowman flies over the monolith, it suddenly changes from a towering slab to an infinite tunnel. As this happens, he utters the final phrase: ""The thing's hollow! It goes on forever, and... oh My God, it's full of stars!"" <<
** CAUTION SPOILER ALERT**
AND here's another one.  >>(at around 21 mins) When Dr. Heywood Floyd stands in the doorway of his sleeping son's room, on the wall to the left of his bed is a poster of an Olympic runner with the text ""Beijing 08"" on the bottom. Considering the film was made in 1984, and the Olympic Committee did not chose Beijing for the Olympics until July 2001 is a fun example of life imitating art and background detail that came true.<<",1434240000,2,1833,4.522658610271903

384366,4,6301963660,"You'll remember that Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi classic ""2001:  A Space Odyssey"" left the viewer with any number of questions to ponder, which was part of the movie's appeal.  Dr. Floyd's final mission report, quoted above, acknowledged just a few of them.  In writer-director Peter Hyams' follow-up movie, 1984's ""2010:  The Year We Make Contact,"" Hyams and the first film's original co-author, Arthur C. Clarke, attempt to answer the questions.  ""2010,"" based on Clarke's second book in a series, is a respectable attempt to follow up on the spectacular success of ""2001,"" and if it doesn't fully succeed, well, just consider what it had to live up to.

As it stands, director Peter Hyams created in ""2010"" a good, well-made, tightly-knit, nicely-acted science-fiction sequel, yet one that clearly lacks the vision and scope of its illustrious predecessor.  Where ""2001"" had been all about imagery, ""2010"" is all about plot.  Be that as it may, however, ""2010"" might be a more appealing proposition than ""2001"" for some viewers.  The sequel has a more conventional story line, a greater reliance on character relationships, and more matter-of-fact explanations for otherworldly phenomena, which could make it more accessible than ""2001,"" which relied almost exclusively on images and sound to sustain its ideas.  Looked at another way, ""2010"" is a good piece of entertainment, while ""2001"" is a persuasive work of art.

""2010"" begins nine years after the spaceship U.S.S. Discovery's captain abandoned it near the planet Jupiter, its crew mysteriously dead or gone, with yet another giant, black monolith standing ominously nearby.  Now, the Americans and the Russians, ever at odds with one another, have agreed on a joint mission to investigate the situation, with three Americans going along on a Russian spacecraft.  Their explorations again reveal the presence of higher intelligences guiding Mankind's destiny and even restructuring our universe.

Three familiar characters return to the film.  Dr. Heywood Floyd, this time played by Roy Scheider, becomes the main character in the drama, and he has a more well-rounded personality than before.  Whereas Kubrick preferred to leave his characters as bloodless cyphers, Scheider invests Floyd with far more animation and emotion.  Keir Dullea reprises his role as Dave Bowman, the captain of the Discovery; and the familiar voice of Douglas Rain once again personifies the HAL 9000 computer.

In addition, the cast includes several other fine actors:  John Lithgow plays Dr. Walter Curnow, an astronaut-engineer with a fear of heights.  Helen Mirren plays Tanya Kirbuk (a play on ""Kubrick""), the captain of the Russian team.  And Bob Balaban plays Dr. R. Chandra, HAL's creator, his ""father"" so to speak.  They make a convincing unit.

Together with some stunningly beautiful special effects, the cast and sets create an absorbing story.  Of course, those introductory strains from Richard Strauss's ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" still open and close the film, setting the tone for whole affair.

Video:
The DVD picture quality had always been good, and it's no less so here in high-definition Blu-ray.  Using a dual-layer BD50 and a VC-1 video codec, the Warners engineers provide a clear, clean image in the film's original 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  It appears that director Peter Hyams chose to shoot much of the film under natural lighting conditions (much as Kubrick favored), so don't expect every scene to be bright and glowing.  Instead, expect most of the interior shots to look quite lifelike but subdued.  In outdoor footage, colors are brilliant, however, deep and rich.  Contrasts look strong and definition sharp, with a light film grain present to provide texture.

Audio:
The Blu-ray disc offers the sound in both lossless Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and lossy Dolby Digital 5.1.  The TrueHD firms up the sound slightly, smooths it out, and provides marginally better clarity and dynamics, although neither audio track makes the most effective use of the rear speakers.  While separation is fairly good in the front channels, it is somewhat limited in rear-channel output.  Deep bass is prodigious and taut, though; you'll know your subwoofer is working from the beginning ""Zarathustra"" fanfare.  This was the first movie soundtrack that, when I first heard it in a theater, actually shook the seats.  It does no less here.

Extras:
To complete the package, Warner Bros. offer a ten-minute vintage featurette on the making of the film, with interviews with the writer, director, and stars, hosted by Arthur C. Clarke, plus a well-worn theatrical trailer.  Furthermore, we get thirty-two scene selections; pop-up menus; English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Portuguese spoken languages; French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, and Finnish subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Parting Thoughts:
Watch for a couple of cameos by novelist Arthur C. Clarke.  He first appears sitting on a park bench feeding pigeons in front of the White House, and he appears again as a face on the cover of ""Time"" magazine, presumably the face of the President.  He seems to have had a good time with the project, and I think viewers will have a good time, too, if they understand beforehand that ""2010"" is a more traditional, straightforward science-fiction story than ""2001.""

I'm sure the promotional people at Warners feel it's mandatory for every buyer of ""2001"" to also purchase ""2010.""  And I see no reason why viewers can't enjoy both, providing, as I've said, they go into it with the knowledge that the two films are very different in style and content--one a preeminent classic, its successor merely a competent follow-up.",1432771200,,5740,5.254665203073546

Must be a big difference seeing it in HD with subtitles on my own personal laptop. This movie was quite true to the book 2010 and it's in the natural sequence.  OK, 2001 was full of mystery and this one is full of answers, but that doesn't make it any less watchable really.  This was the intention of the author who, by the way, followed up with 2061 and 3001 in case anyone's interested.  He did a similar thing with the mysterious Rendezvous with Rama - presented sequels that make it all very ""down to earth"" - well, almost. Now, THAT would be some movie!  Now, at the time, of course I never noticed Helen Mirren and Bob Balaban in their ""cross-ethnic"" roles in the movie - didn't know who they were.  Now, looking back, I was pretty flabbergasted.  That tough Russian lady was actually a British actress!  So I look up Helen Mirren and find out that she's really Russian - go figure.  And did I never notice that Dr. Chandra is not Hindu?  Today we all know Bob Balaban from so many fun roles, but who knew at the time?  So it turns out that watching this movie now provided more information than it even intended to.

384596,3,6301963660,"This was a disappointing adaptation from Arthur C. Clarke's excellent novel.
When MGM was considering making 2010, they polled people about what they thought of 2001: A Space Odyssey.  The result was that people complained the film was ""too long..."" and ""too intellectually intimidating"", so MGM made 2010 extraordinarily literal (i.e. using voice overs from messages about discoveries we should have seen for ourselves) and overshadowed the novel's story line from a non-political epic space adventure (that description does not do it justice, my apologies) to one of the U.S. against Russia (due to the current climate that existed between to the two nations when 2010 was released in the early 1980's).
As a result, MGM made 2010 into a political issue and ruined the grandeur and mystery of further encountering an alien race.
2001 is my favorite film.  You need to have an appreciation for it to be sure.  2010 is not a worthy successor to it.  Some people gave the excuse that this was not successor but was a film of its' own. I cannot see how one can differentiate between the two.  It is a sequel pure and simple.  I am still waiting to see the excellent film this should have been.  This is my opinion, of course.  Rent it first and draw your own conclusions.  Roy Scheider and Helen Mirren are excellent.  Dana Elcar spoke in a Russian accent that was poorly executed.  If you are not a fan of 2001, don't read the 2010 novel.  Simply watch the film for what its' worth.",1423872000,,1481,4.6976744186046515

2010: THE YEAR WE MAKE CONTACT: Imagine being asked to write and direct Citizen Kane II, and youll have a clue to the obstacles Hyams faced in fashioning this sequel. I know Citizen Kane, some critic is bound to write, and you're no Citizen Kane.

2001 is inviolable; an absolute: hypnotic, mystical, visually brilliant; one of the finest films in the genreperhaps even one of the finest films in all of cinema history. 2010 naturally suffers by comparisonbut only by comparison. Taken on its own, as a stand-alone story, 2010 has much to recommend it. At the top of that list are the flawless and beautiful special effects by Richard Edlund. And Hyams (who adapted Clarkes novel, produced, directed and did his own cinematography) deserves a lot of credit, not just for taking the risk of attempting a sequel to 2001, but for making such a [expletive deleted] good one.

While 2001 was a detached, emotionally frigid film, 2010 concentrates on character and action, and excels at both. Not that its devoid of ideas, however. Quite the contrary: In any other film, ideas like a computer learning what it means to perform a noble sacrifice, or wondering if it will dream when its unplugged, or of life arising elsewhere in our galactic neighborhood, would be enough to hang an entire plot on. But comparisons are inevitable, and in any contest between mystery and clever explanations, mystery always wins. Even in this contest, however, 2010 offers a subtle touch: the mystical implication that Starchild Bowman might become the anima mundi of a new planet, or the consciousness/life-force of its emerging species.

The real secret of 2010 is that it is essentially an old-fashioned, 50s style space adventure movie (well-)dressed up as an 80s action and effects extravaganza. (The films political subtext sets it squarely in that Cold War eraand is the one part of the film that seems dated.) Its a space adventure that is intellectually stimulating, emotionally compelling, visually interesting, tense and suspensefuland which even touches wonder in its climax.

So its not 2001. So what? Its still a thrill to see our old friends the Discovery, Bowman and HAL (featuring his original voice, Douglas Rain), once againa trio of veterans who provide the film with a poignant finale in their ultimate reunion.",1423267200,2,2562,4.907621247113164

384650,4,6301963660,"This is the conclusion to 2001: A Space Odyssey, 2010 is more of a faster pace movie that completes the story. It has a lot of actors in it we are more familiar with. For Example, Roy Scheider (JAWS), John Lithgow(Footloose), Helen Mirren( The Queen), Bob Balaban( Altered States), and Keir Dullea(2001). I found this movie much more exciting, great special effects for the time, and the story was unique. The story came out at the height of the cold war 1984. It does deal with some factual political problems we were facing at the time America/ U.S.S.R. . The movie does deal with this Americans/Russian out in space together, helping one another. I do not want to give the story away, and I will if I continue. When watching it be open to the fact it is a movie that came out in 84 when The Cold War was at peak level. So be prepared to take a step back in time, I think you might like this film. It is wise to watch 2001 A Space Odyssey before so you will be able to put the puzzle together quickly.

384773,4,6301963660,"If you are an Arthur C. Clarke, 2001-Space Odyssey or just plain old sci-fi fan, then this film is something to consider.  It is clearly not the magnum opus that 2001 was, but how could anything match that...
This film is a sequel, wherein Roy Scheider as the chief scientist for the lost 2001 space mission has to retrace the steps to Jupiter to discover what happened.  We get to see what did happen to Major Bowman(Keir Dullea) and the ship(from 2001).  There is some fingerpointing as to who's responsible for the missing spacecraft from 2001; it would've been nice for Roy Scheider's character to have accepted responsibility, yet they weasel out and blame it on some nebulous 'agency'.  Meanwhile, on earth, it's the climax of the Cold War, which is threatening to become a hot war with the west vs. Russia.  Ironically, there is a mini space race(a la the Moon race) to reach Jupiter first to learn of the fate of that ship, for national glory.  In the film, Scheider(USA) and Helen Mirren(USSR) have to cooperate in order to get home safely before something momentous happens.  To describe what happens any further would ruin it completely...
Again, I recommend the film though it's not 2001 by any means and is flawed in other ways.  For instance, the film was inspired by the Voyager pictures of the Jovian system, with those incredible 256-color pictures of Jupiter.  So, the director uses that gorgeous vista of Jupiter in the film.  Problem:  if you remember the pale greenish yellow Jupiter in 2001 and then look at that planet in this film, you have to wonder?  Well, hate to disappoint you, but the garish Jupiter we see in 2010(from Voyager press photos) was artificially enhanced by NASA and does not exist in nature.  Oh well, it did make for some great photo ops...",1417219200,,1785,4.719354838709678

384775,1,6301963660,"This sequel to one of the greatest movies of all time was made by Peter Hyams, a filmmaker who clearly didn't care for the original.  Instead he attempted to apply his own aesthetic, something more akin to Ridley Scott, and the fit was poor at best.  There are even rivets on the Discovery ship, which makes no sense.  The humor is awkward, the acting (mostly by otherwise fine actors) is weak and at times horrendous, the look inappropriate, and so on.  And cliches abound.  Though there are good things about the film, such as a younger (and mostly unknown to U.S. audiences at the time) Helen Mirren as a Russian cosmonaut. Roy Scheider chews up the scenery as Dr. Heywood Floyd, originally played by William Sylvester in a brilliantly low-key and even deadpan manner... I cringed at the line ""I didn't know... I didn't know"".  Keir Dullea, in a brief appearance, is also terrible... ""It's full of stars"".  Perhaps the film was entirely looped (due to the sets?), but quite poorly.  Even John Lithgow is sometimes bad.

I try to keep an open mind at attempts at remakes and sequels to great films... there are a handful that aren't so bad... but this one is truly disappointing.  Most of the women resemble models.  The earth settings are over-designed.  The acting ranges from acceptable to Ed Wood bad.  Overall a waste of time and only for completists and the morbidly curious.",1417219200,3,1383,4.7125

384936,5,6301963660,"2010 follows 2001, and the two movies really must be seen together to be fully appreciated, in my opinion. If you've seen 2001 and you were left with a feeling of ""what the bleep did I just watch?"" you need to continue the journey and pop in 2010.

It doesn't rate as highly with critics or audiences as 2001, but for my money, I actually prefer 2010. But I only say that as someone who has seen both, first as a kid around the tender age of 12 or 13, and now as an adult nearly 30 years later. It's not so much a matter of comparison, for me, both films enhance one another. 2010 makes 2001 better, and vice-versa.

What I love about 2010 is, first and foremost, the accessibility. It's more of a traditional space adventure. Gone are the long, lingering shots, or the stretched out scenes of people and objects moving seemingly in slow motion. This isn't an art film, it's a space opera, pure and simple. Instead of a confusing, mysterious work of silent beauty, 2010 has warmth, suspense, thrills, and even a bit of comic relief (just a few chuckle moments of dialogue, no floppy eared clowns!). If you saw 2001 and were blown away, then go into 2010 expecting more of the same, you'll be disappointed. In some ways, 2010 makes 2001 seem worse, and vice-versa. It all has to do with your mindset and expectations.

It's when the movie returns to scenes from the previous one, with all that nostalgia and mystery caked over by years of dust and neglect, that was the moment, for me, that still gives me chills. Towards the end there's a tense scene that really boils down to a battle of wits, trying to use psychology and deception in a desperate struggle for survival, and it's one of the best moments in the history of sci-fi on the screen. But that's just me.

2010 is full of Cold War paranoia, and overall it's very much a product of the time when it was made. But the struggle reflects current events between Russia and Ukraine, so here we are 30 years later and we're still on the brink. Is the idea really that far fetched? I don't think so. Now when it comes to the bigger story, the main theme of both films, well that's something else entirely. I don't want to give anything away, but it certainly leaves the viewer with ideas to ponder.

Watch both, make up your own mind, but don't pass them up because they seem difficult or too dated. There's something in both movies for everyone, and if you're a student of culture and history, you can't afford not to experience both 2001 and 2010.",1413590400,,2501,4.4164859002169194
384937,4,6301963660,"The way to gain the greatest appreciation for this film is to completely clear your mind of the existence of 2001: A Space Odyssey.  If you spend the entire film drawing comparisons, you will be soundly disappointed as many people were in 1985 upon its release.

The movies simply have different purposes.  2001 is a work of art that attempts to elicit an emotional response to abstract concepts.  Kubrick intentionally leaves questions unanswered so we can decide for ourselves what the answers are or if they even exist.  2010 is an adventure story that lays out the plot details of its predecessor probably in a way similar to what Arthur C. Clark would have envisioned for a film adaptation of 2010: Odyssey Two.  2001 was based on Clark's short story (the Sentinel) but the artistic beauty of the film comes completely from Kubrick.  2010 is more a of straightforward, nail on the head adaptation of the novel.

All that being said, 2010 is not a bad movie by any means.  It is certainly much more accessible than the prequel and Peter Hyams does a good job reproducing the awe that should be affiliated with a good space opera.  Roy Scheider is clearly trying his best to put on a good performance but I personally think he was the wrong casting choice.  The acting in general is unremarkable.

The best part of the movie has to be the finale of the last 10 minutes.  This is really when the sense of wonder begins to pick up again after a few hours of straightforward, linear plot progression.  However, unlike 2001, the open ended questions asked are not as philosophical as they are plot related.  Most are clearly answered and explained in 2061: Odyssey Three (which, by the way, is worth a read as is Clark's entire series).

If the fact that I've been referencing 2001 throughout this review despite saying we should put it out of our minds in the first sentence wasn't indication enough, I will go ahead and reiterate that 2010 is not in the same league as its predecessor.  There can be only one 2001, but that doesn't prevent 2010 from being a noteworthy installment in the body of science fiction.  It is a must see for anyone interested in the genre but as to whether or not it qualifies as one of the ""greats""... I'll leave that for you to decide.",1413504000,,2265,4.578163771712159

Clark was sitting on a park bench feeding pigeons. There are other scenes in the film that also suffered in this chopped transfer.

The Blue Ray edition of this film is a MAJOR disappointment!! Yes, the film was presented in its original aspect ratio, Clark can be seen in this transfer. BUT, for a Blue Ray disk to look this bad is a disgrace. Major parts of the film look like they were filmed with a gauze over the camera. This bad transfer included all of the interior shots. The special effect shots of the ships and Jupiter were fantastic, but the interiors were inferior.

No excuse for a Blue Ray disk to have been produced so badly.

""2010: The Year We Make Contact"" is a lazy, mediocre re-writing of the excellent Aurthor C. Clark novel ""2010: Odyssey Two"". While it goes without saying that the process of adapting a book to movie format invariably means excluding some or many of the original details, ""The Year We Make Contact"" strips away just about everything except for the plot. Jupiter and its moons, which were a central theme in the novel, are reduced to backdrop while the complex and often entertaining relationship between the Russian and American scientists has been twisted into a divisive and paranoid cold war era partnership -- a decision clearly influenced by the politics of the time (80s). Clark's hard science fiction has also been discarded in favor of artificial gravity (not centrifugal force) and an awful scene that involves Heywood Floyd using floating pens to convey an idea while he and the other crew member retain their weight.

And yet, the worst part about ""The Year We Make Contact"" is not what it leaves behind in the adaptation, but what it lacks in its own merit. This movie is really boring, which is sad, because the universe is not. It was foolish enough to make a sequel to 2001 without Kubrick, but to make a movie based on a book about our solar system when you obviously have no interest in such things seems like a truly frivolous endeavor.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: It's no secret that sequels are often little more than calculated rehashes of popular movies, with extra emphasis placed on re-creating dialogue or bits of action that everyone talked about the first time around. But Peter Hyams film '2010: The Year We Make Contact' [1984], the long awaited follow-up to Stanley Kubrick's monumental classic, 2001: A Space Odyssey [1968], is a different beast altogether. It may well be the only sequel in movie history that was designed to explain the plot of its predecessor...not that everyone was clamouring for an answer.

'2010: The Year We Make Contact' is relatively straight-forward narrative picks up nine years after the first film ended. The United States government discovers that the Soviets are planning to travel to Jupiter to find out what happened to The Discovery, the doomed ship that served as a sort of metaphysical launching pad in 2001: A Space Odyssey. The Soviets eventually contact the U.S. and request that Heywood Floyd [Roy Scheider], the mastermind behind the original mission, accompany them on their journey. It's never explained how Floyd, who was played by William Sylvester in 2001: A Space Odyssey, managed to transform himself into a completely different person between stories.

'2010: The Year We Make Contact' is judged strictly on its own, as if it were an original production with no connection to '2001: A Space Odyssey,' Peter Hyams' film version of '2010: The Year We Make Contact' is arguably one of the better sci-fi pictures to come out of the 1980s. Unfortunately, you really can't judge the film on its own merit. Its existence is inextricably tied to Stanley Kubrick's legendary masterpiece. Any positive attributes  '2010: The Year We Make Contact'  may have are unavoidably overshadowed by comparison to its predecessor. There's just no two ways around it. As the direct sequel to one of the greatest motion pictures ever made, quite frankly, '2010: The Year We Make Contact' cannot in no way be compared to '2001: A Space Odyssey,' it must stand on its own merit.

The fault for that lies mainly with author Sir Arthur C. Clarke. If a few of the sub-plots had been changed around a bit, the movie is a mostly faithful adaptation of Sir Arthur C. Clarke's novel 2010: Odyssey Two in all of its most important aspects. When Sir Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick collaborated back in 1968, the results were a fusion of each man's strengths as a storyteller: Sir Arthur C. Clarke's background in hard science fiction and his grounding in plausible scientific speculation, with Stanley Kubrick's visionary artistry and mind-bending flights of imagination. The sequels (the author penned four books in the series) are purely Sir Arthur C. Clarke's doing, and suffer from the lack of Stanley Kubrick's perspective.

That's not to say that Sir Arthur C. Clarke was an inferior storyteller to Stanley Kubrick. In his prolific career, he wrote several legitimate classics such as Childhood's End and Rendezvous with Rama. The two men simply approached the material from completely different angles. Their collaboration on '2001: A Space Odyssey' produced something beautiful and transcendent. '2010: The Year We Make Contact,' on the other hand, just isn't in the same calibre.

At the end of '2001: A Space Odyssey,' the human race had encountered the single most important event in its history, and was quite possibly poised at the brink of an evolutionary jump forward. As '2010: The Year We Make Contact' picks up, we learn that basically nothing has happened in the following nine years. In fact, the mysterious monolith and the intelligence behind it don't seem to have much interest in Earth or humanity at all. The film opens with a stream of facts and data that recap the discovery of the monolith and the first mission to Jupiter. In this alternate timeline, the U.S.S.R. is still a major superpower, and the Cold War is still very much on. While their governments squabble over an escalating conflict in Central America, the American and Soviet scientific communities decide to launch a joint mission out to Jupiter. Their plan is to board the derelict spaceship Discovery and find out exactly what went wrong the last time. The Soviets can get there faster, but only the Americans can reactivate and repair HAL 9000, and so they need each other. Leading the expedition are Dr. Heywood Floyd [Roy Scheider taking over from William Sylvester] and the Russian captain Tanya Kirbuk [Dame Helen Mirren] who I felt was misplaced, as well as not very convincing and should of instead had a Russian actress taken her place.

While Stanley Kubrick embraced ambiguity, Sir Arthur C. Clarke was a strict literalist. The brilliance of '2001: A Space Odyssey' lay in its open-ended nature, the fact that it opened the door for ideas that each audience member would have to interpret for him- or herself. '2010: The Year We Make Contact' sets about to systematically deconstruct all of the mysteries left unresolved at the end of the first story. It attempts to provide rational, understandable explanations to the images and plot developments that were intended to represent concepts beyond humanity's comprehension. Do you need to be told, in easily-digestible terms, exactly what the monolith and the Star Child were, where they came from, what they did, and how they worked? Well, here you go. Personally, I find it more interesting to ponder those things on my own, especially when the explanations that Sir Arthur C. Clarke comes up with are so simplistic and mundane.

If I haven't mentioned Peter Hyams much in all this time, well the director illustrates Sir Arthur C. Clarke's story with workmanlike competence and efficiency. The film has strong performances from the cast and solid production values for the '80s sci-fi flick. The model and miniature effects are quite excellent and hold up very well. (However, optically they have dated really badly and some of the compositing work is downright terrible, especially using 4:3 video screens, whereas the '2001: A Space Odyssey' video technology was so far more advanced and still stands out today). Anyway Peter Hyams stages several moments of nail-biting suspense, including the aero braking sequence and a breathless spacewalk between the Russian craft Leonov and the Discovery. I have to admit disappointment that he falls back on that old crutch of using sound in the vacuum of outer space (which Kubrick went out of his way to avoid). Nevertheless, I think it's safe to say that '2010: The Year We Make Contact' is the best film that Peter Hyams ever made, even if that's not much of a complement considering some of the dregs he's churned out in the years since.

For what it is, the film's script is intelligently written and has some thought-provoking ideas. The depiction of the future year of 2010 misses the mark in a few respects (like the Soviet Union still being around, or the preponderance of all those bulky CRT computer monitors), but is a fairly credible extension of the world created in Stanley Kubrick's film. Unfortunately, '2010: The Year We Make Contact' lacks any real vision, which is why '2001: A Space Odyssey' stands out so spectacular. On its own, '2010: The Year We Make Contact' is a decent enough sci-fi picture. But sadly it's not a worthy follow-up to ''2001: A Space Odyssey.'

Sir Arthur C. Clarke, for his part, was receptive when a nervous Peter Hyams sent him the screenplay. ""I felt like playing a few tricks on you, like a message from my secretary that I was last seen heading for the airport carrying a gun,"" he told him. However, Sir Arthur C. Clarke added, ""I'll say right away that it's a splendid job and you have brilliantly chiselled out the basic elements of the novel, besides adding quite a few of your own."" Whether or not Peter Hyams succeeds in clarifying a deliberately unknowable film will hinge on your eagerness to abandon your personal interpretation of Stanley Kubrick's and Sir Arthur C. Clarke's work. Regardless, '2010: The Year We Make Contact' can still be appreciated as a solidly entertaining piece of sci-fi, and especially as I have already stated that '2010: The Year We Make Contact' was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Sound, Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup, and Best Visual effects.

Blu-ray Video Quality  '2010: The Year We Make Contact' is not the revelation on Blu-ray that '2001: A Space Odyssey' was, but that has more to do with the nature of each film, than their respective high-definition transfers. Unlike its predecessor, the majority of '2010' wasn't shot on 65mm film, just regular 35mm. Furthermore, director Peter Hyams performs double-duty as cinematographer on all of his films. His preferred visual style is dark and grainy. He favours source lighting and high-speed film stocks. You'll find a consistently drab appearance among most of his other films ['Timecop,' 'The Relic' and 'End of Days']. The 1080p transfer is at the mercy of its source material. Presented in its theatrical 2.40:1 aspect ratio, the image is flat and hazy. Colours appear accurate, but aren't particularly noteworthy. Contrast wavers; a lot of shots had their exposure pushed in the lab, elevating black levels and grain. Accepting that, the Blu-ray is certainly a substantial improvement over the inferior NTSC DVD edition released with a cruddy non-anamorphic letterbox transfer back in 2000. Although fairly soft due to the lighting and use of photographic filters, the picture has a decent amount of detail and exhibits no signs of Digital Noise Reduction or artificial sharpening. The special effects footage (which was shot on 65mm by an entirely different crew than the live action scenes) looks terrific. The model shots are as sharp, clear, and well-lit as you could hope. If anything, the contrast between the two types of scene is a little jarring, but that's just the way the film is. The 1080p encoding has a few minor issues. The grain isn't always well-compressed, and sometimes comes across noisy or blocky. I also noticed some colour banding on the flat surface of the monolith. Still, overall, this transfer is about as good as I'd ever expect for '2010: The Year We Make Contact' to look in high definition. Now that '2001: A Space Odyssey' has now been remastered and brought out as a Limited Edition SteelBook Blu-ray release, it is now time Warner Home Video also brought out a remastered '2010: The Year We Make Contact' Special Edition, as it is crying out for one and then the two films will be complete for another generation.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  '2010: The Year We Make Contact' was nominated for a Best Sound Academy Award way back in 1984. For its vintage, this is an interesting sound design, even if fidelity and aggressiveness aren't quite up to modern standards. The Blu-ray offers the soundtrack in 5.1 Dolby TrueHD or Standard 5.1 Dolby Digital formats. Dialogue sounds a little flat, but the music (especially Strauss's Also Sprach Zarathustra) has nice body and depth. The film features some very loud, shocking sound effects. The aero braking sequence is an auditory highlight with pretty intense bass action guaranteed to get your subwoofer rumbling. Even though the movie played in 70mm theatrical engagements with a 6-track audio mix, the 5.1 options on the Blu-ray are virtually devoid of surround activity. Whether that's inherent to the original sound design (it wouldn't surprise me) or an issue with the conversion to 5.1 configuration, I can't really say.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Vintage Documentary: 2010: The Odyssey Continues [1984] [480i] [4:3] [9:00] Sir Arthur C. Clarke introduces the film by the novel's title, 2010: Odyssey Two, and in the introduction to this vintage making-of promo. The short piece doesn't go into much depth, but does offer some quick interviews with visual futurist Syd Mead, production designers (who stress the importance of a utilitarian style in the sets), and SFX people. It's kind of amazing to see that Sir Arthur C. Clarke and director Peter Hyams were essentially communicating by E-mail (via a very primitive ""computer link-up"") all the way back in 1984. Around that time, they thought it was on the cutting edge with computer technology. This promotional short for 2010: The Year We Made Contact [1984] shows moviegoers how some of the film's visual effects were created. This includes makeup for Keir Dullea's character, how the astronauts float in space, and the construction of the spaceship in which the astronauts carry out their mission. The vehicle is so large; the two largest sound stages on the M-G-M lot were used to construct it. Narrated by William Rus.

Theatrical Trailer [1984] [[480i] [3:00] This 4:3 pan and scan trailer is in pretty lousy condition and cannot understand why they could not do the same aspect ratio as the actual film, this is a very bad unprofessional attitude of Warner Home Video.

Finally, '2010: The Year We Make Contact' is a film simultaneously underrated and not nearly as good as it should have been. If you can try to divorce your expectations from any comparison to '2001: A Space Odyssey,' it's a solid '80s sci-fi adventure. Unfortunately, it is a sequel to '2001: A Space Odyssey' and on that mark it sort of fails. Despite this, it is still a good companion Blu-ray to the previous awesome film, but what lets it down is the 4:3 video screens, at least with '2001: A Space Odyssey,' the technology was much more far advanced looking and is still today after 50 years since its release in the cinema and I think that aspect lets the film look slightly old fashioned. Despite this anomaly the Blu-ray looks and sounds about as good as the film can look or sound, and is still worth a recommendation, despite not coming anywhere near the very high standards of '2001: A Space Odyssey' which we were hoping to see when '2010: The Year We Make Contact' was released in the cinema. Again, still despite this, it is still a worthy addition to '2001: A Space Odyssey' and I am very honoured to have it in my Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

Yeah it kind of meanders around answering the monolith and what happened to Dave Bowman questions but it really is a muddy plot and once you get to the credits you have a feeling of thinking ""hey, that time could have been spent a little bit better"".

385316,3,6301963660,"An interesting enough film but pales in comparison to the original. It just reminds me how much I miss Roy Schroeder, but it can't escape the fact that this film is only a disappointing sequel.",1399939200,,193,4.542857142857143
385386,4,6301963660,"That's the big question for any sort of sequel or addendum to Stanley Kubrick's visionary film. It stands on its own, a cosmic colossus of beauty & wonder as big as the Universe. Even Arthur C. Clarke's own novel, written in conjunction with the original film, necessarily falls short -- though it's a very good Clarke novel, I hasten to add.

The only thing to do is judge this film as a work in its own right -- and on that basis, it's a good, solid, thoroughly re-watchable film. The cast is first-rate, the screenplay hews very closely to Clarke's own sequel, and it does evoke that ""sense of wonder"" so vital to quality science-fiction. While offering some answers to the Big Questions raised by the original, it also maintains an aura of mystery, the feeling of mere mortals encountering forces beyond their imagination -- and perhaps managing to grasp a glimmer of what those forces might actually portend.

The obvious drawback for any viewer today is the political & technological sub-structure of the film. Clearly both aspects belong to the 1980s. But as with all good science-fiction, it addresses the issues of the day in which it was made, extrapolating from them; and the technology presented, as well as the special effects technology used to envision it, is top-of-the-line for its time. Let's face it, so many of the CGI special effects highly touted today will undoubtedly look just as dated some 30 years down the line. So what matters here is whether they did the best they could with what was currently available. I think they did, or at least came close enough.

And as for the political aspect, of course that part is dated now. However, it does reflect the time in which it was made, when the Reagan administration had revived & ramped up fears of nuclear war with the Soviet Union. In addition, the political changes since then only reinforce the basic message of the film, however preachy at times: the macho military posturing of power-besotted human beings is not only infantile & horribly dangerous, but it means absolutely nothing compared to the immensity & mystery of the Universe. We have intelligence, we have incredible potential, and we shouldn't be wasting it on destructive ideologies, creeds, nationalism, or just plain greed.

Yes, as a sequel to the magisterial ""2001"" this film must disappoint to some degree. But if you can set that aside & simply watch it as a strong adaptation of work by a grandmaster of science-fiction, then it comes off very well. It's not the transcendent experience of ""2001"" ...but it is quite entertaining & thoughtful, and worth many viewings. Recommended!",1399593600,8,2628,4.859375

385390,4,6301963660,"I remember loving this film as a little kid, and it's surprising how well this film has held up. Without taking anything away from the artistry of 2001, this film serves as a somewhat preachy but overall good sequel. Roy Scheider gives a clean, understated performance as Heywood Floyd; Helen Mirren is a stern yet sympathetic Commander Kirbuk. and Bob Balaban as R. Chandra ( the one jarring note in casting: Dr. Chandrasmurti, shortened to CHandra, is Indian and gay in the book as conceived by Clarke; in typical casting of Hollywood at the time he is made White. Balaban does an awesome job, however.) John Lithgow delivers a great performance as well- the spacewalk scene is brilliant!

The look of the film is lovely- interior sets are grainy, alternately white and shadowed, as it would be in a large spaceship. Outer shots are very crisp and incredibly beautiful.

Given current technology and geopolitics this film is dated, but in a good way. 2010 posited the triumph of scientific knowledge, individual spirituality and the absolute need for peace amongst the great world powers. I highly reccomend this film =both as a  sequel, a space mystery on it's own and look back at what we thought was important back in the 1980s.",1396742400,,1233,4.834123222748815

It is a nice follow up to ""2001"" and for most people is more watchable.  I like both, but I concede ""2001"" has long sequences that are not for everyone.  ""2010"" is a more typical film and tries to tie up a lot of loose threads left at the end of ""2001"".  What happened to Dave Bowman?  Why did the HAL 9000 malfunction?

Well, for once they're wrong because this one is pretty good, in fact, it is very good, particularlyt the message at the end.  A benevolent , intrighuing, come -see-us invitqation from an advanced civilization instead of some damn death ray, smoking everyone in sight.  Here, we never see the ET's but siomehow I feel thedre maybe  yet another film to answer yet more questions.  Arther C Clarke wrote this sstory AS WELL AS THEW ORIGINAL 2001.  NOW, THE SOVIETS AND AMERICAN ARE UNEASY FRIENDS AS THEY JOIN PEOPLE AND WE HITCH A RIDE with Russkies in their newest inter planetary ship, the Leonov.  The skipper, in this politically correct theme is the terrific British actress Helen Mirren and a small cast of Russian actors and the head American Dr. Floyd, plaed by the versitile Roy Scheider aLONG WITH JOHN LITHGOW and Bob Balaban, AS THE COMPUTER GEEK, DR. CHAUNDRA, THE DADDY OF HAL THE 9000.  HE WORKS WITH SAL, ANOTHER 9000 computer.  She helps Floyd get this project ""off-the-ground, pazrdon trhe pun.  Supposedly set in 2012, the environment isn't very convincing, aside from some yet unmade clothing and alsost fairy tale technology.  It really seems that this should be in the years 2050-2075, or greater.  But, ALL THAT ASIDE, THE MISSION BEGINS AND THE STORY STARTS BY THE AMERICAN CREW ON BOARD, ANDS KERNOW (LITHGOW) AND CHAUNDRA M(BALABAN) BEING AWOKEN IN FLIGHT, 2 DAYSA PRIORTO REACHING THEIR 9 MIONTH TRIP TO JUPITER.  The color photography is stunning, especially on HI-Def TV's.  As Floyd prepares for the long trip, he says a sad goodby to his pretty young wife and pretty cute son, in CaLIFDORNIA AND THE NEXT SCENE IS HUNDREDS OF HUNDREDS OF MILES  AWAY DURING THIS 2.5 YEAR ROUND TRIP.  THE TRIP IS THE JOURNEY OF A LIFETIME AND SCHEIDER IS PRIVATELY WORRIED ABOUT THE WHOLE THING, PARTIVULARLY IN LIGTHT OF HIS GUILT at ""loosing the men on the 2001 DISCOVERY MISSION, A MERE 9 YEARS EARLIER.  THE SCIENTIFIC PREINCIPLES USED ARE CREDIABLE, SUCH AS THE LONG INDUCED SLEEP AND THE GAGUES, COMPUTER AND LITTLE DAILY AMMENITIES OF THIS MAGNIFICENT GALACTIC HOTEL IN OUTER SPACE.
  Floyd is awaoken earlier than the other Americans, to inspect strange data collected from Europa, and  Mirren's accent, by the way, is very good and she is believable as are the other members of the Russian crew, some real Russians and some, probably English actors.  Seems the English can do about everything a director needs.  A probe sent down to the sxurface of Europa is blasted back into space and all the data lost.. Floyd correctly assumes this as a ""warning, "" especially after Chlorophyl is detected.  This element is necessary by-product of photosynthesis, the chemical reaction of changing light, water and  into fuel for growth in the plant world.  THIS MEANS ""LIFE"", EVEN PRIMITIVE , CRUDE AND BASIC  LIFE.  AZN EXCITING FINDING AND NOW THE TWO GROUPS OF SCIENTISTS ARE INTERESTED IN THIS SUPRIZING DISCOVERY.  MAY I COMMENT------------ALL THROUGH THIS FILM, I AM NAGGED BY THE REAL WORLD CONSEQUENCES OF OUR FAILURE TO COOPERATE WITH THE USSR ON SCIENTIFIC ADVENTURE AND POOLING OUR MATERIAL, MONEY, RESOURCES TO EXPLORE TOGATHER.  BUT, SADLY, WE HAVE POISONED THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH POLITICAL IDEOLOGY AND SUSPICIONS OF A MUTUAL NATURE.  IN ORDER TO REACH JUPITER IN AN ORBVIT, WE SEE A SPECULATATIVE example of air-braking, slowing down with the life preserving assistance of a heat sheild, just a really huge hefty bag, which does the job, nicely and although scarey, it works.  DR.'S KERNOW AND CHAUNDRA ARE WOKE UP BY THE CREW AND FLOYD TELLS THEM THISA THING IN CENTRAL AMERICA IS GETTING WORSE, WITH AMERICAN AND SOVIET MILITARY FORCES SWSIRLING AROUND EACH OTHER LIKE ANGRY HORNETS, RISKING A FULL OUT WAR OVER SOME worthless chunck of land, in Honduras, as if it were Berlin.  FLOYD BRIEFS HIS FELLOW CREWMEN as to the Europa findings, and Kernow and Max, a Russian, suit up for a spacewalk to each the USS Discovery, lying dormant and susspended nedarby.  Max and Kernow become friends and hit it off from the start, but Mirren is a tough nut to crack.  She is the Captain and lead pilot of the Leonov and is also an officer in the Soviet Air Force, and a to-the-death patriot.  AS THEY ENTER DISCOVERY THEY FIND THINGS FROZEN IN TIME, AND JUSTAS WE LAST SAW THEM IN 2001, as Dave Borman, Kier Dulay left it , traveling into the void to search for the reason Frank Poole was killed, probably by Hal ands sent into the void to drift in space forever.  My copy of this cool movie is a NON Blueray disc, but it looks GREAT on my new Samsung 40"" HD TV set.  I MIGFHT BUY A BLUERAY  VEFRSION IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT.
  SUPRISINGLY, THE DISCOVERY IS FULL OF O2 AND THE MEN SOON CAN DISCARD THEIR HELMUTS AND DO A QUICK INSPECTION OF THE US SHIP, AND IT SEEMS OK AND AWAITING REACTIVATION, WSHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED LATER.  OUR TWO INSPECTORS ARE NOW FRIENDS AND SIMPLY FELLOW AZSXTRONAUTS, BOTH CURIOS AND WILLING  TO WORK TOGATHER .  CHAUNDRA NOW ENTER HAL'S BRAIN, A ROOM WITH HIS FUNCTIONAL AND MENTAL CIRCUITS AND AS HE PUSHES THE ELECTRONIC PACKAGES BACK INTO PLACE, UNLODGGED BY BOWMAN IN 2001, HAL BEGINS WAKING UP.  AFTER SOME GOBBIDY-GFOOK JABBER , HAL SAYS ""GOOD MORNING TO HIS FRIEND DR. CHAUNDRA"" AND THE AUDIENCE IN THE THEATER SIGHS OUT LOUD IN WARMTH AND APPROVAL.  WE WANT HAl to work with both sides, in the persuit of science.  Hal, to his credit, has no nation, no bias, no fear of humans, only a mission to do and will work with whoever The crews  discuss the monolith encountered nearby and notes it has the same dimentions as the one found on the moon, 9 years earlier, 1 by 4 by 9, the squares of 1,2,3.  No one knows what trhis means and Clarke's novel doesn't  apparently azrgue over it, wasting film footage and time in a dedbate that wiould probazbvly degrade into a childish movie fight.  Max goes back down alone in a pod from the Leonov and after a HORT TIME, THE SLABbegins getting disruptive untill it ejects the pod and MaX INTO DEEP SPACE, KILLING THE RUSSIAN AND TEMPORARILY DOUSING BOTH CREWS WITH SADNESS AT THE LOSS OF A COLLEGUE AND NEW FRIEWND.  IN a reaLLY SPOOKY scene, Dave Bowman's widow sees and talks to him in her kitchen on TV, and it is clear she still loves him.  He says ""something is going to happen, something wonderfull""  BCK ON THE LEONOV, A PAUSE TO MOURN MAX'S DEATH, MIRREN AND FLOYD  TALK AS FRIENDS AS HE OFFERS HER A DRINK OF KENTUCKY WHISKEY AND TALK ABOUT THEIR FAMILIES.  THEY FIND OUT THEY HAVE MUCH IN COMMON, BOTH WITH YOUNG KIDS AND THIS IS THE BEGINING OF A BREAKING THE ICE, AS MIRREN IS , AS I SAID EARKLER, AZ TOUGH NUT TO CRACK.  ON BOARD DISCOVERYNOW, CHAUNDRA AND HAL DISCUSS THE PREVIOUS MISSI0N.
  IN A HOSPITSAL ON EARTH, MRS. B OWMAN, DAve's mother, is a comatose patient, beingf seen by agroup of rfesidents, nd as the men leacve the room , DaVE appears invisably in her room, lovingly combing hisx mom's hazir, as whe suddenly sits up and smiles boadly, knowing it is her son, Dave.  The life support monitors go flatline, sounding an alert and she falls back in bed, clutching her hairbrush he used and smiling broadly in a peaceful death.  Now, we think Dave is in some kind of angelic state, perhaps an angedl himself., as the nurse rushes into the room.  People in the theater ., like us, now chatter quietly as to the meaning of this event becomes another idea of this terrific mystery movie.  Clarke throws yet another interesting curvew at us, aND WE LOVED IT.
  BACK TO SPACE, THE DISCOVERY, THE LEONOV AND THAT MONOLITH.  A VIDEO IS WATCHED  AS THE US MISSION CHAIRMAN INFORMS THE AMERICAN CREW THAT SHOTS HAVE BEEN FIRED AS THE US NAVY nazd the Soviet Navy are on a war footing.  The result is that the two crews are now ordered by their governments to seperate and not work togather, which is what they need to do, and we know they will, despite the tensions over Honduras.  Hal tells Floyd that he has a message from an unknown sourse for Dr. Floyd.  It reads as follows, ""It is dangerous to stay here, and tyouy must leave in two days.""  Hal does not kmnow who the sender is but says, after Floyd skeptically says wed can't leave for lack of fuel.  Hal the says, the semder says,"" I understand this problem, but you must leave in two days.""  Again, Floyd balks, but Hal says the response is, ""In life I was David Bowman.""  Wow, now it is really getting spooky, and yet again Floyd expresses skepticism, to which Hal responds 'IT IS important that you believe me, look behind you"".  Slowly, aS WE GRIP EACH OTHER'S HANDS, FLOYD turns around and is astonished to seeDave Bowman (Kier Dullea, looking as if he hasn't aged a second, let alone 9 years.)  This is the stunner of the movie and Floyd beats it over to the Leonov, whicxh he has been forbidden to enter due to the threat of imminant war, and confronts Mirren with a plan to link up the two spacecrafts , fire the Discovery's huge rockets and leave Jupiter's orbit on a lifesaving emergency excape and head to Earth, with the Discovery serving as a booster for the Leonov, then the discovery and Hal will be destroyed by the expanding monolith.  Bowman walks away from Floyd and as Scheider follows him they meet in the pod bay.  Bowman, now an old man, reiterates his message, stressing the urgency of leaving in two days and that ""something wonderful is goingf to happen"", but he can't say what this is.  Then Bowman says goodbye and  FLOYD DEMONSTARATES how the two ships can be used to leave in two days, but only if the crews agree to cooperaTE for a one time event.  Both are scared of the idea, but know they have no choice in the matter.  However, there is a problem, with Hal.
  The crew's bosses on Earth need to know every move the men make and want to know what they are up to.  If they won't allow the ships to be coupled, the authorities can sabotage the efforts, and, to make matters worse, Hal has been programed to launch back to earth later, but now he is being told to leave in musch sooner time, and by analyzing the data, he can see that the discovery will certainly blow up and with it, Hal also.  Will he stand in the way aor sacrafice himself fdor the credws to save their lives?  Of course, Hal will do what Floyd asks of him,  and the crews prepare for the ""burn"", this being timed down to the split-secoand.  Chaundra feels betrayed and has a special affection for Hal, since he built the computer and he feels responsible for him  and his very existance.  Anothefr discussiuon regarding Hal's original orders in 2001 and how he was instructed to lie about the mission.  As many times as I'ver seen this wonderful film, I still don't fully understand the predicerment that Hal was put into 9 years earlier, but Chaundra now tells all that Hal may not carry out the operation onboardc Discovery and could, at the last instant, balk and thus allow everything and everyone to be destroyed by  the rapidly multiplying monolith.  Perfforming this complex task manually, is near impossible, and , for sure , all are in Hal's hands.  Finally, Chandra, in a touching moment, tells Hal privATELY the real mission he is needed to do, and he asks, ""Will I dream, Dr. Chandra?""  Tearfully, Chandra says ""yes, all intelligentr beings dream, perhaps ytouy will dream of Sal.""  To which Hal agreedss and thanks Chaundra fdor telling him the truth.  So, my question at this point in the film is this, does Hal actually have feelings, and compassion for the humans he seems to be gaurding and, from Hal's point of view, caring for.  I think the film answer is yes ands trhis is a touching moment in this fine film.  Chaundra is clearly distressed by this situation and at thi scene in the movie, I COULDN'T resistthe opportunity to make a crack, so I SAID, IN A VOICE A FEW OTHER COULD HEAR AND SAID, THIS GUY needs a blow-up girl or something.  Terse laUGHTER COULD BE HEARD.  AZLL THE PREPERATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE and as the tension grows, the momoliths are multiplying at a tremendous rate the total of them doubling every 2 minutes.  The monolith seems to eating the planet, Jupiter.  As the countdown proceeds, Hal asks if it should be stopped,, but Chaundra stalls by trying to persuade Hal not to abort the countdown.  And, finally Chandra tells hal the truth, that if the countdow and ignition is aborted, all is lost. Now, at last Hal understands the situation. aND AGREES TO CONTINUE.  THE INGITION SEQUENCE CONTINUES AND AS THE ROCKETS FIRE, CHANDRA NARROWLY ESCAPES AND IS BARELY ABLE TO REACJH THE LEONOV.  MOMENTS LATER THE PLANET EXPLODES ALONG WITH ALL THE MOMOLITHS.  AND THE LEONOV IS HEADED BACK TO EARTH AND SAFETY.
  THE FILM THEN ENTERS AN EPILOGUE PHASE IN WHICH THERE APPEARS IN THE SKY, FROM EVERY PERSPECTIVE on Earth, two suns.  The people mon Earth will forever see them in the sky and will never know a day of darkness.  Dave BowmAN IS HEad from one final time as he dictates a message to Hal for transmission to Earth.  The message reads, ""All these worlds are yours except Europa, attempt no landing there;use then togather, use them in peace"".  The result on Earth is a recalling their Military forces from Honduras.  We can thus conclude that peace will reign in the world as the two great powers, the USA and the USSR, have learned to peacefully coexist and respect one another, AND that a bright new dawn of mutual space exploration has come into being.  A fairy tale ending, yes, a romantic idea, certaqinly far-fetched? perhasps not so distant after all.  We are men and we put these obstacles in place , it seems to me, we can remove them.  In trhe real world of today, in the post Reagan/Gorbachov era, we still harbor suspicions and as for this notion that the Cold War is overf, I rather doubt it.  The Communist ideology, bent on a global revolution and remaking of the map of the nations of the world, allow, in the Marxist mind, only room for two entities, the Communists and the Capitalists.  One must eventually destroy the other, as there can be no tolleration of a competitor.  It rfeally is an all-or-nothing idea. and, in this, lies the great materiral threat to mankind.  One must understand that Communism is ""Atheistic Communism"" a blatant, relentless , cruel and barbaric deniaL o\f the existance of God. If you don't agree or don't recognise that fact, youy cannot understand Communistic Philosophy and the plan for world domination.  Satinism is the core belief of Communism and, for that matter,, it is also at the hub of Capitaism, as this ""good"" form of social order is unbridled greed, and addictive and desperate , clutching materialism.  The business of America is Business, said President Cooledge and we have infested the American mind with consumerism, self-love and a edndless demonic embracement of goods, toys and a me-first attitude that has instructed the world , in the most pompous of manners, how to live our lives.  The Grfeeks were close to a workable solution with their maxim, ""all things in moderation,"" yet the very inclusion of the term ""all"" bellys this notion that medn should not be ashamed to want it all, just in a maderate sense.  We are too weak for that, and we fail continously.  Either we adopt a policy of austerity, and push back from the table of plenty or we surrender our base instincts.  The saints and the Church have been saying this for over two thousand years now and we still havn't learn,  and perhaps we never will. But, that is what prayer was invented for.  God Bless all asnd pray for all  mankind, wed need it

After watching 2001, the dialog in this movie seems schmaltzy, the special effects should have been better but were worse, relying on sloppy matting. There's a sequence when the Russian craft is using an air-brake to slow down in which the giant balloons catch fire and bits of flame seem to ""drip"" from the craft as they might in a 1950's B-movie rocket. The interiors of the spacecraft were more reminiscent of Alien than 2001. All of the things that Kubrick left to the interpretation of the viewer were nailed down and set in stone in this film.

He concluded, however: ""And yet the truth must be told: This is a good movie. Once we've drawn our lines, once we've made it absolutely clear that 2001 continues to stand absolutely alone as one of the greatest movies ever made, once we have freed 2010 of the comparisons with Kubrick's masterpiece, what we are left with is a good-looking, sharp-edged, entertaining, exciting space opera"" (source Wikipedia)

Personally, I would have to say that I couldn't help but constantly compare this movie with Kubrick's masterpiece. It probably isn't fair but in 2013 I am still awed by Kubrick's vision of the vastness and emptiness of space and man's tremendous arrogance to conquer it. In comparison in this movie human interactions clutter the whole landscape. If appears that human civilization went backwards in the ten years between 2001 and 2010 (comparing the equipment and the technology shown). There are some moments in the movie which seem, to put it mildly, inspired by Kubrick, like the heavy sound of people breathing when they are performing a space walk. But unfortunately they do not achieve the same effect.

I also think that the whole cold-war point of view was overplayed. I do not think that it was important in the original books.

Last and not the least, the spaceship-crew of Kubrick seemed like real astronauts. They behaved and acted like trained professionals. The crew in this movie acted like a bunch of amateurs without basic high school level science training (I find it unbelievable that a trained astronaut would test oxygen in a potentially hostile environment by exposing themselves out of their their space suit!!!)

So, this is an average space movie based on Arthur C Clarke's vision. A true heir to Kubrick's timeless grand vision, it is not!",1372118400,,2066,4.92816091954023

I take that back - (right now I am highly perturbed that I used 2+ hours of my life watching this film.) There are some good things, I guess 2 of them: Helen Mirren and, um.... Sorry, 1 good thing. Can't come up with 2. I did try.

The acting (except for Mirren and Schneider at times) is not too great. Lithgow is his usual over-acting self. The dude who fixes HAL is pretty bad. So, basically all of the lead characters are not really well portrayed.

The special effects are great! Especially if you think that an interplanetary vessel should have control switches and lights on every interior surface, making the whole thing look like some cheap carnival. I'll just stop now. There is no point in going on. This was a very poor movie. I cannot imagine it ever having seemed decent.

One thing I can say that this movie may have done better than any other movie; exploited a great first film and hoped people would buy / watch it based on the following of the first film. I know that I did.

Bottom line - I think that this is a horrible film in every aspect. I would be surprised that anyone likes it. Therefore, my recommendation is to pass on this one.

2010 seemed like it could be 'real'.  It held your interest, while 2001 could put you into a deep, deep sleep.  I've got a copy in regular DVD and Blu-ray.

The story involves a joint mission with the Soviet Union to travel where man has gone before and learn the fate of the Discovery.  A few stars are featured: Helen Mirren, John Lithgow, Roy Scheider, Dana Elcar, and Keir Dullea (pops in as a decidedly older version of Dave Bowman).  HAL's back, as inquisitive as ever.  There are monoliths galore (just as enigmatic).  The ending is stellar.  As a Sci-Fi flick, it's not that bad...........until you consider its ancestry.

386198,5,6301963660,"First: a word of warning: Who SHOULDN'T check this movie out? Kubrick purists. This is *not* a Stanley Kubrick movie. That's not a slight, mind you, but people looking for 2001 again are bound to be disappointed. If you're looking for a solid ""hard"" science-fiction film based in an alternate future where the soviets still exist that follows on from the plot of 2001, and does a good bit of explaining about the end of that first movie, read on...

Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey was as important a movie could be in the genre of science fiction: It broke new ground in special effects, it raised important questions regarding extraterrestrial life and artificial intelligence, and more importantly, was considered a work of art and cinematography in a genre that up until this point was not really taken seriously as anything more important than b-movie matinees. That being said, it's not the easiest film in the world to watch unless you're high. It's very long, very slow, and very trippy at the end. You almost -have- to read the companion book (written by Arthur C. Clarke) to really understand what is going on from the arrival in Jupiter space till the end of the movie (although in the book, it is Saturn, not Jupiter. Apparently Kubrick decided he couldn't do a sufficiently realistic Saturn and so moved the setting of the last scenes in the story).

So this brings us to 2010. 2010 cannot be understood without at least some context about 2001, hence the preceding paragraph. Whereas 2001 was more or less an art film made by a renowned director. 2010 is more your typical sci-fi sequel, and at the time was cashing in on the popularity of science fiction films brought on by the recent successes of the Star Wars and Alien movies. Arthur C. Clarke decided to carry on the Space Odyssey series in a number of novels, and by 1982 had written a sequel to 2010, although the book sequel followed the movie continuity, with the Discovery mission travelling to Jupiter, although other elements from the book are still used.  This made the second book hew close enough to the original movie to justify being made into a straight sequel film, and in 1984, this was the result.

2010 is one of my favorite movies. It's a movie about the cold war, and about the near-future (at the time) of civilization. It continues on where 2001 left off, but where 2001 was trippy and unexplanible at the end, 2010 is more of a hard-core sci-fi movie in the vein of Alien. While this movie doesn't break any cinematic ground, it presents itself effectively while answering questions left by the first movie and providing a fair amount of tension.

Perhaps best of all, this is a very 'real' movie in the sense that there is no 'magic' in the movie, all the technologies used in it theoretically could have existed by 2010 (with the possible exception of a.i. and hibernation, although they're still entirely possible) had we as a civilization deemed it important enough to develop them.  In fact, most of the technologies seen in this film DO in fact exist real-world 2010, in many cases in ways far more advanced! In once scene early in the movie, Heywood Floyd is seen using a laptop the size of a suitcase on a beach. The laptop was in fact current technology when the film was made,but very expensive and very unusual. By the 90s however we had reduced the form factor of laptops more or less to the size they are today, at least compared to what is seen in this film.

If you've seen 2001 and ever wondered what the hell the ending of that movie is about, or you just like good scifi, you should definitely check this out. If you like cold-war 'what-if' movies (the Soviets play a major role in this film as it was made during the height of the cold war), you should DEFINITELY check this out.",1357171200,2,3798,4.609467455621302

386200,5,6301963660,"Even though Kubric's 2001 is considered the classic movie, I personally like this one better.  Set in the 1980s at the height of the cold war, it definitely used the USA v. USSR tensions, and even had the two nations at the brink of war.  The two nations had to team up on a mission to Jupiter to keep the spacecraft Odyssey from crashing and being lost.  The movie was a continuation of the first, expanding on the theme of the origin of life.  It also resurrected the HAL computer, and explained why it did what it did in 2001.  Roy Schnider and Helen Miren did great in their respective roles of commanders of the US and Soviet teams.  Kerr Duella reprises his role as Dave Bowman in a little more than a cameo role, but he is not in the movie a great amount.

Sound is not great.  A number of minor unnecessary irritations.  The whole US-USSR thing is in the way rather than helping anything.  Meant to heighten tension I suppose.  Very poorly done.  Spacewalks are clumsy and non-sense in how they are done.  When aboard the Discovery for the first time, they open a spacesuit and breathe the air to test for oxygen.  Ridiculous when they obviously would have the means to test the air.  That was widely available even back when the movie was made.  The future time of the film with many apparent advances portrayed would not have done things this way.  Just oodles of these things all through the movie.

Then when the US-USSR declare war, order the US part of the team to Jupiter to leave the Russian ship and vice versa, well that gets beyond stupid.  Would such orders get issued?  Probably.  Would people in that situation around orbit or Jupiter and a mysterious monolith go along rather than staying together?  I don't think so.  And adding that to the movie really adds nothing.  Again, I don't mind these spoilers.  They are saving you from the putrid movie this is.  Then of course they do actually work together, as this in between was just a clumsy attempt to create drama and of course extend the movie which lacks any real content.

However, it's by no means a perfect film. Where 2001 was hard to understand, 2010 sometimes hits you over the head a bit too much with plot points (particularly bad is the voice over narration from Dr. Floyd's character telling viewers that he's scared). The camera focuses a bit too much on Dr. Floyd who comes across as a pretty plain character.

386363,4,6301963660,"If you liked 2001: A Space Odyssey, you'll probably like this. It's at least as much of a teckie movie as that was. That is, it's at least as much about the hardware and the technical details of what they are doing as it is about the humans doing it. But the best parts of 2001 are back: the mysterious monoliths, and HAL 9000. One thing that may strike younger viewers as odd is that it talks about high tensions between the US and the USSR, whereas we all know the USSR no longer existed in 2010. Just remember that it did exist in 1984, and that very few people expected it to go belly up so quickly.  I believe it was Isaac Asimov who pointed out that every science fiction story has three times: the year it was written/produced (1984), the year in which it was set (2010), and the year when you read/see it (2012).

As the story opens, Dr. Heywood Floyd (Roy Scheider) is approached by a Russian scientist who wants him to go aboard the Russian space ship that is planning to go out to Jupiter and see if they can find out what happened to the Discovery and to HAL. He points out that they will get there about a year earlier than the planned US ship. Eventually, Floyd does go with the Russians, along with Dr. Chandra (Bob Balaban), who was HAL's original programmer, and another American who is an engineer.

I won't spoil it by telling you what they find, except to note that, as before, Dave Bowman is played by Keir Dullea. Yes, they had all assumed he was dead, but we know better, don't we?

386366,3,6301963660,"After 2001 was completed Stanley Kubrick had all the models and sets destroyed to prevent a sequel being made.  Kubrick wanted to keep the ending of 2001 mysterious. However, the Sequel 2010 was made much to Kubrick's chagrin. Where Kubrick's was interested in ambiguity director Peter Hyams was more interested in explanation and finalizing the story with an uplifting ending, something that is rarely seen in a Kubrick movie. For this reason Kubrick was not a fan of 2010.

The story commences with a joint American and Russian crew setting out to solve the mystery of the Discovery. Unlike, 2001, 2010 is just as much a political film as it is a science fiction. On Earth the two super powers are on the verge of war, and what they find on Discovery and Jupiter will directly affect what is happening on Earth.  The crew makes the best of things despite tensions on Earth. The interior of the spacecraft is very convincing.

Suddenly the American commander sees a ghostly looking David Bowman haunting the halls of the ship. This apparition also ages before the American's eyes (Roy Scheider), and says ""Sometime wonderful is going to happen"". Bowman then tells the crew they must leave quickly. In the final scenes you see the crew grasping at their chairs waiting for the temperamental Hal900 to launch both ships. This time HAL obeys and the Russian craft and the Discovery leave orbit. Behind them a large hole is opening up in Jupiter and the abandoned Discovery, used as a booster, falls into this massive hole that now almost fills the whole planet.

Jupiter has evolved into a new sun which in a spiritual sense brings peace again to the Earth.  There are some impressive shots of famous Earth landmarks situated in front of the two suns. Even if some the forest shots are staged they are impressively mounted, giving the impression of a dream. The Dream in 2010 is world peace bought by a new sun.

I must also comment on the pre-CGI effects, which hold up quite well. The shots of the astronauts pulled over Jupiter by cable have appropriate awe and mystery. Unlike 2001, the effects in 2010 are more colorful, but not any less convincing.  This film looks very much like similar fare made during the early 80s like The Wrath of Khan.

To understand the direction of the film you have to know what kind of Director Peter Hyams is. He is talented technician who, in the past, has made traditional Hollywood films.  Most of the films he made prior to this were imaginative pop-corn movies like Outland, and Capricorn one.

Maybe Kubrick would have seen the ending of 2010 as a cop out. Then again Kubrick's wants his version of 2001 to keep people guessing for years to come.",1330905600,4,2686,4.693617021276595

The blu-ray transfer is not as horrible as many of these reviews would have you believe. If you want to see a BAD transfer, check out the DVD of Outland, another Peter Hyams film from the '80s. Compared to that, this is the best transfer in the universe. Although folks have called it ""grainy"", to me it appears to be more like digital camera noise you get at a high ISO rating - in any scene where there is sufficient brightness, there is no ""noise"", even within the same frame. In only one scene (when they are discussing what HAL will do when they ask him to sacrifice himself) is Roy Scheider slightly out of focus, although the rest of the frame is in focus.

It is an old movie and incredibly many more movies do the same mistakes or this stuff on purpose. However as I mentioned, the cast is fine. I believe the movie would be much greater without all this political ''war'' and if only both countries behaved politely. Why to show all this anger in a scientific movie? Let's not blend political arguments and views with us, people. Let politics hate each other. We are people and no ones puppets. Be the movie without all this stuff you'd love it even more. As to finish the review, this movie is a must. Get it and watch. It will sure provide you with a lot of stuff to think about.

It is not. While Arthur C Clarke wrote the book the film is based on, it is not a Stanley Kubrick film.

Having said that, the film is very good. It is a film from the 1908s, where tensions are high between the Soviet Union and United States. It tries to answer questions like what is the monolith, why was it there, and what really happened to HAL 9000. While we may not necessarily like the answers, the answers are reasonable.

The film is not a huge CGF extravaganza (remember, it was made in the 80s). But what it does it does well. There are technical flaws (like an inconsistency surrounding gravity), but nothing that really gets in the way of enjoying the movie.

The Blu Ray version is very good, given it is copied from film, not a digital copy of the film. It is clear, with a softness that comes from film copy. However, it is well focused, and and worth getting in Blu Ray.

386540,4,6301963660,"""My God...It's full of stars!""

One of the best science fiction movies of the 80s, other than the Star Wars and Star Trek movies, is 2010: The Year We Make Contact (1984). This sequel to director Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey continues to be undervalued and overshadowed by its predecessor. But this is truly one of the great science fiction movies of all time in my humble opinion. It stands on its own as a great movie as well as a great sequel. I actually prefer it over the original 2001, as crazy as that will sound to some, but it just connected with me at the right time I think. Don't get me wrong, 2001 is a classic groundbreaking science fiction film that predates Star Wars and Star Trek. It paved the ground for Star Wars and Star Trek to get made. It's a poetic masterpiece of filmmaking by one of the great film directors of all time...and on a cinematic level I truly appreciate it's beauty. But 2010 got to my heart first. I saw it first...and then I saw 2001 because I loved 2010. There was just something about 2010 that was more of a movie that a teenage boy could get into. It was simpler, it had more ""answers"", it was more straight forward hollywood filmmaking, and it was less ""artsy"" than 2001. And even now at my ripe old age of 37, with my newly educated filmmaking mind, I still prefer 2010 over 2001.

I was 11 when 2010 came out in theaters, but I remember very vividly seeing it for the first time when I was probably 12 or 13. My Dad was working as a bartender at a small motel called The Highlander in Madison, Wisconsin. For some reason I was hanging out there one night and 2010 was playing on HBO on the TV I was watching. I remember being completely captivated by the movie, even though I came into the middle of it. I still have images in my mind of me staring at 2010 on the big wood-furniture encased television that sat on the floor in the TV room at the motel. I'm not sure when I actually saw the full film, but it's been one of my favorite sci-fi films since. It's currently in my Top 100 movies of all time, somewhere in the 51-75 range. I give the film 4.5 stars out of 5.

By now you probably know the basic story behind 2001 and 2010, as written by author Arthur C. Clarke, so I'm not going to bother trying to summarize the story or plots of these movies. If you haven't seen either movie, watch 2001 first...then watch 2010...and come back to my review. Filmmaker Peter Hyams is the mastermind behind 2010 the movie. He wrote the screenplay, produced and directed the film, and was the Director of Photography on it as well. I'm not sure why Kubrick did not make the sequel to 2001. I'm sure there's a story out there about it. These two films are like oil & vinegar...mixed together they give you a complete telling of Arthur C. Clarke's story from two points of view. But they also work separately.  And there are many people who like one movie and not the other. Some who like both. I like both, but give the higher marks to 2010 because as a film, it connected with me more than 2001. But of course 2001 had to be there for 2010 to exist.

I've heard arguments that 2001 is more timeless than 2010 and holds up better now because it doesn't have that ""pesky"" russian vs. USA storyline. But I like that 2010 is set at the height of the Russian-US nuclear war age of the 80s. I like that the story revolves around these two bitter enemies having to work together in space and set aside their differences for the greater good of humankind. The monolith, and the ""aliens"" or ""god"" that it represents, bring the planet together, united as a race at the end of the movie. I know it's a little bit ""sappy"" and ""silly"" now in our post-communist age, but at the time, it was an impossible idea. That's what makes 2010 timeless for me...the underlying idea of rivals coming together against a foreign threat. We've seen this idea expressed in countless movies after 2010...and probably some before it.

The production design on 2010 basically uses the same great space aesthetic established in 2001. Apparently the production team for 2010 meticulously studied the original film for all of its details, then crafted the sets, models and visuals after it. For me, the spaceships are totally believable, even though they aren't as slick as J.J. Abrams' new Star Trek (2009). I'm always able to escape into the movie and get lost in its story. All of the lead actors are perfectly cast in this movie, with great chemistry between Roy Scheider and Helen Mirren. Their yin-and-yang banter is perfectly executed, representing opposing countries, opposing genders, and opposing ideas. While the movie is told from the point of view of Scheider's character Dr. Heywood Floyd, Mirren's ""captain"" gives a nice counter-point.

You can't really talk about 2001 or 2010 without mentioning the music in both films. While Kubrick went more classical and orchestral sounding, using various classic composers' works from his temporary soundtrack, Hyams went with a modern and electronic reinterpretation of similar music by David Shire.  I like Shire's work...it fits right in with the movie and its time period in the 80s.

I purchased 2010 on bluray this past weekend and watched it for the first time in a few years. I've also got the DVD of the film that was released back in 2000. The film definitely looks better on bluray than on DVD. It's the best presentation of the film I've ever seen. And the ""exterior space"" scenes are absolutely brilliant looking. It's the ""interior"" scenes that look fuzzy and excessively grainy. But 2010 lacks the restoration that so many other classic films have been receiving as part of their bluray release recently, like 2001: A Space Odyssey. Granted, 2001 was shot on 70mm film, giving the studio a much better original to work from. It doesn't look like the studio rescanned the original 2010 film negative with our new higher resolution scanning technology. It looks like they took the old scan they did for the DVD ten years ago, color corrected it a bit, tweaked the audio, and put it out for sale. It's not bad, but I look forward to the restoration of this film digitally sometime in the future...maybe for a 30-year anniversary edition in 2014. When you see other films on bluray that have been cleaned up and restored after rescanned, you just hate to settle for a lesser quality presentation. But I realize 2010 is not the critical and popular favorite that 2001 is, so the studio probably didn't want to spend the time and money on this one.

Overall, I can't recommend this film enough. It's a classic in my movie mind and I highly cherish re-watching it every few years to reconnect with the spiritual message that it proffers. Now I can enjoy it over and over on bluray for years to come!",1289952000,,6779,4.544635544635544

The limitations of the source material are clearly evident, and many artifacts of the special effects are much more visible. The film does look much better on Blu-ray than the DVD ever did, however.

I still think though that ""2010"" is the better movie. It's not as long and drawn out, plus it's a lot clearer at the end while still having a lot of mystery in it as well.

From a visual side, it looks pretty good once you get over the fact that ""2001"" looked better. True I think ""2001"" is still better looking, but without comparing the two movies together, ""2010"" looks pretty damn good too. The special effects are realistic and beautiful, the only real let down visually is the out-dated 1980's computers featured on Earth at the beginning of the film and some of the controls featured on board the Leonov spacecraft. But overall, it looks great.

From a storytelling side, it is great and in some ways even better than ""2001"". Nine years have passed since the Discovery mission to Jupiter. Now a joint U.S.-Soviet space mission is launched to find out what happened up there and solve the mystery of astronaut David Bowman's mysterious disappearance. Danger and excitement await the crew as they venture into the unknown and encounter extraterrestrial life.

386546,2,6301963660,"I personally liked 2001: A Space Odyssey because of its mystery, music, and emotion. The great feeling of isolation as the astronauts flew to Jupiter made the movie seem very realistic. However, 2010 removed most of these interesting aspects. For example, 2010 is moves along at a much faster rate, which, in my mind, is not an improvement. The most notable difference between the two movies is the open ended feeling of 2001 versus the obvious message in 2010. Whereas 2001 questioned the creation of life, 2010 questioned nothing more than whether or not they can return home safely. 2001 was only for a select kind of viewer. You had to be patient, able to question the theme, and appreciate the work of Stanley Kubrick. 2010 is catered more towards the general movie-watcher; the kind of person who just wants to sit down and watch, but not have to interpret the movie for themselves. I am not one of those, and therefore I only gave this movie 2 stars.
  In short, if you liked 2001, I recommend passing this movie, unless you want all the fun of 2001 to be squashed by 2010. If you haven't seen 2001 but want to see this movie, I suggest not watching 2001 (unless the description for it intrigues you) and relying solely on the summary at the beginning of 2010 to get you caught up (the summary at the start gives you more than enough background information). As for me, I miss the simplicity of 2001 when I watch this movie.

386602,4,6301963660,"I was pretty upset when I discovered that my DVD copy of 2010 wasn't anamorphic...  so I would have been happy just to find a DVD in anamorphic.  But I decided to upgrade to blu-ray for this disk, since I remembered it from the theater as being pretty visually impressive.

I read a number of reviews on here.  I have noticed that Amazon has taken to ""clustering"" reviews recently...  so the reviews for Blu-ray, DVD, or even VHS are all together.  This is DUMB, but it's what they do these days.  Oh well...  In this case, the review is for the USA release of 2010 on Blu-ray (not the Canada release, as some of my other Amazon purchases have turned out to be lately!).

I've just finished watching it.  And I watched it, and listened to it, EXPECTING to see the issues that some folks mentioned here (bad image quality, artifacts, etc).  So I'm pleased to say that on the BD I received, there was NONE of that.  It's a very nice transfer.

Granted, the master has a lot of grain, and there are some minor scratches which can be noticed on rare occasion.  But it still looks really nice.  Short of doing a ""frame-by-frame restoration"" (as was done on the James Bond disks a few years ago) where colors are corrected to compensate for fading (NOT an issue on this print by the way), scratches are digitally ""painted out"" and so forth...  I doubt that this could look much better.

Of course, the criticisms about the SFX sequences are...  well, utter nonsense.  Yes, there are some minimal visual artifacts that inevitably exist on ANY film that was made in the days when filmmaking was optical in nature.  Somehow, I was expecting (based upon some of the reviews of the blu-ray) that these would be jarring in HD.  But they weren't.  The film looks very, very good.

I've also noted the criticisms of the film itself.  Well, as others have stated... this is NOT 2001.  Nor was it intended to be.  Personally, I like this film a lot more than I like 2001.  2001 is ""higher art"" but it's less ""watchable"" and that's what I care about when I'm watching entertainment.

It's a fun film.  Clarke was involved, very much so, in the making of the film, by the way, and despite claims to the contrary by some would-be ""urban mythmakers"" he never ""forswore"" this film.  No, he always spoke of it fondly, at least in all of his public commentary.  He even went so far as to say that there were elements in the film which he wished he'd included in his earlier novel.  So ENOUGH with the ""Clarke would have hated it"" nonsense, OK?

The design of the film is classic Syd Mead, except for the re-used design elements from 2001, of course.  Mead's individual setpieces on the Leonov were beautifully done, as was his design for the Leonov itself.

Sadly, there were flaws in the execution of these designs.

The Leonov's rotational section should have all of the ""modules"" set up so that they are normal to the radius of rotation, but there two angled modules per ""arm"" which are not normal to this... so the floors of these sections would be, effectively, on a 30-degree slant.  I blame this on the model-makers, not on the designer... but it happens.

More significant was the fact that all of the ""setpieces"" on the ships were built in a soundstage, as complete ""uninterrupted"" floorplans.  This is, of course, nonsense...  but would not have been a significant issue except for a pair of ""long, walking"" shots aboard both vessels which simply wouldn't fit into the ship designs.  Most viewers will never notice this sort of thing, but to me, it's a huge issue.

Finally, a lot of criticism is placed on the film for not having the shots which should be in zero-g be in actual zero-g.  Of course, considering that the film was shot on the planet Earth, not in deep space, it would be pretty difficult to get the shots in true zero-g, wouldn't it?  It would be tremendously expensive, and would make for a lot of distraction from the storytelling for the average viewer (just like it was for viewers of 2001!)  I would have preferred that the actors, and the director, had remained more aware of this during filming, but it's a minor quibble that doesn't really interfere with the storytelling.

All together, this is a fine, enjoyable film which has (for the most part) withstood the test of time.  The anachronisms - Pan Am, the USSR/USA ""cold war,"" etc, etc...  are minor concerns, but remember, this film (and its predecessor) specifically didn't use NASA but instead NCA as the national space agency (and NASA existed at the time, so this clearly was by design).  So you can think of this as a ""parallel world"" to the one we live in, and you can enjoy the film just fine on that basis.

Overall, this BD was much higher quality than what I'd been expecting from the reviews, and I'm totally satisfied with it.",1275523200,3,4803,4.5472578763127185

In fact what amazes me to this day is how they created such great special effects for a movie as old as it is. I still like what they were doing in that department back then over all the fake looking CGI(yes, it all looks fake if you pay attention) stuff we use today.

With that said, this movie desperately needed a remastering and sadly it didn't get it. When you place the blu-ray in your player it immediately goes to the movie instead of a menu, which is sort of the first giveaway that they didn't put much attention into this movie. When the movie does play, it's evident that they didn't remaster it but rather transferred an old copy of it. Well, I hate to say this, but just because you put something on blu-ray doesn't necessarily make it look better. The source material has to be good, and in this case it isn't.

I know what some people will say, that it's an old movie and you can't expect much better. That's simply not true. You can see there's clearly a beautiful movie waiting to get out, but it can't because they haven't bothered to clean up all the noise and grain that exists in the picture, especially in dark scenes.

386748,4,6301963660,"If your'e actually reading this, you likely figured out as I did the only way to see review of a Blu-Ray when the DVD is also out (and when is that not the case?) is to check most recent reviews - otherwise you must wade through often hundreds of DVD reviews to get to what you want. They should definitely fix that - when looking at a BLU-RAY I'd like to just see reviews of the BLU-RAY! But enough of my rant.

I found this Blu-Ray to be quite watchable and enjoyable. As others have said, this is not ""more of the same"" in terms of 2001 so if that is what you want you will be disappointed. In some ways since the characters are more three-dimentional it is a more engaging film than the original. I think that part of the intent in 2001 was to have the characters drawn as fairly two-dimentional to emphasize the parallels with HAL, who as the computer was ironically the most fleshed-out character. I believe Kubrick set out to create a work of art with little regard to popular preferences, and I respect that. This movie is much more conventional and therefore more accessible to a wider group of people. The story is good solid science fiction and the special effects are quite good, especially considering how long ago it was made. I for one don't feel the set design was too bad; they were trying to create a more utilitarian / spartan atmosphere in the Soviet ship (yes, Soviet not Russian - this was 1984 before the wall fell).

Now to the technical aspects. As others have noted, there seems to be quite a bit of variability from scene to scene in terms of quality. I do not believe this is a mastering issue but instead I suspect that like with many sequels the quality of film stock used was much lower than for the original (the most glaring example of this which I am familiar with was the difference between the first 2 Star Trek movies). This would explain the variation between special effects scenes and set scenes.  I suspect that whether or not you like this movie's look depends to some extent on your preference of film grain vs. DNR (digital noise reduction). Many times looking at a Blu-Ray with its terrific resolution one naturally looks at the edges of objects looking for the razor-sharp edge which is one way to produce the disc. Film grain does not allow for that razor-edge but is more true to the original look of the movie in the theatre. To be honest it does not matter much to me either way, though there are staunch proponents for both camps, both with valid points. And no, I'm not a politician by trade though taking both sides on this might make me seem to be one!

Overall, a good movie well worth the presently $10 cost.",1264377600,6,2664,4.419551934826884

Okay, so I was disappointed that the title character was played by a different actor than William Sylvester, who played the character in the original 2001.  But, realistically, there aren't too many William Sylvester fans out there anyway.

Within about 15 minutes of the film, we're introduced to the definition of the Phoenix, bringing the whole idea of resurrection into play.  As much as the 2001 mission looked forever dead, this wonderful movie brings the mission back to life and restores it to completion.  Even though I didn't care for the ending, I sure did enjoy a lot of what was going on in the middle of the movie, so much that the whole 80's Soviet/USA feud didn't give me continuous thoughts about Rocky 4.

It's great to see the old sets and the old characters, for the most part played by the same actors from the previous film.  And while it doesn't seem quite the masterpiece that 2001 was, it manages to do a good job of entertaining with a lot of action throughout.  In my opinion it has a lot more mainstream appeal than the artsy style of 2001.

Second, as a 2010 movie fan.
After almost 10 years watching the letterbox format on DVD, I have to say this BR edition is very good.  Details is all about, from the beginning to the end.  Now you can appreciate all the details this movie has, even the movie was clean in my opinion, on the DVD version the scene on New Mexico the VLA, you can notice a lot of particles, dust at the edge of the screen left and right, just look the sky on those sides.  The BR version all is clean.  The colors are more vivid, the sound is way better also.
One bad thing about it, is because you can see more details many of the space scenes you may notice the camera shaking, on the planets and the Leonov's spaceship.  This was also noticeable on 2001 early DVD versions, then this was fixed on the latest edition and HD-DVD (I guess the BR version too).
Some scenes also you may notice the film-grain, but other scenes are very clear picture.
The BR edition has the same as DVD extras, the trailer, and the making of the film.  Only more language options you have here.  Also the russian dialogue is not translated, so keep your imagination on those parts.

386806,2,6301963660,"This review is for the BluRay release.  As has been said before in other reviews of this title, do not expect the atmosphere and feel of 2001 from 2010.  Still it's an interesting story that answers many questions you were left to ponder after Kubrick's epic 2001 which is still a fantastic journey to undertake.  I had a problem at first with Roy Scheider taking over the role of Heywood Floyd from William Sylvester who played him in 2001.  Perhaps Sylvester was not available for 2010, I do not know, I haven't checked.  Still overall 2010 is a good film.  It's special effects really need to be cleaned up as a lot of the green screen shots are uneven, the astronauts look muddy and things have a cut-n-paste look to them.  Matte squares (where they mask out everything they don't want in the picture as in the case of a space ship) are plainly visible in many shots.  Of course we have to remember that in 1984, when 2010 was made, computer graphics were just becoming fashionable in motion pictures and we've come a long way in the 25 years since this film was made.  Still, I feel a good re-mastering of this film is definitely in order.

I was appalled by the quality of this BluRay disc!  Here I thought that by purchasing it on BluRay, the newest thing in HiDef, I'd be treated to an entirely new experience in viewing this film.  Especially compared to the crummy previous releases not to mention the horrid pan-and-scan VHS and Beta editions ... oh I said not to mention those didn't I? ;-)

Anyways, the sound was fairly flat with not much stereo separation and the picture was extremely grainy (worse than VHS!) and it didn't look like all the grain was due to the film copy they used for mastering, some must have been inherant in the video transfer.  I only blew $15 on it but still, how this one got thru quality control is beyond me.  Certainly they must have better film elements to work with and more care should be taken with these releases.  Maybe they just rush these things through so that they can have more titles out on BluRay to compete with the other studios?  If so, shame on them!",1252108800,8,2111,4.455729166666667
386807,3,6301963660,"As a movie on its own, ""2010"" is a great one.  The sort of movie I would watch, greatly enjoy, forget about for a few months, then maybe buy if it were on sale and consider it a great movie I would watch once in a while and recommend to friends.

As I said in my review for ""2001"", 2001: A Space Odyssey is an epic beyond the scope of any genre.

Unfortunately, ""2010"" is a sequel to this, and is a part of its storyline.

Because of this, ""2010"" is, and will always be, mediocre.

I was really thoroughly crushed and gaping at the screen in an almost disgusted disbelief during the squicky, saccharine soap-opera like scenes of Roy Scheider playing with his son on the beach.  All I could think during these ""Quintessentially 80s"" scenes was ""This is 2010... This is 2001: A Space Odyssey's continuing story... This is the man who flew to the moon and actually touched the TMA-1 Monolith... playing at the beach with his son set to a then-contemporary 80s soundtrack""

Starting with the bad,

- This movie is too much in the realm of ACCEPTING its own mediocrity.  It does not attempt to match 2001 in any way.  It doesn't try at all for Kubrick's style of ""Show, Don't Tell"" or any sort of artistic approach.  The main spaceship, the Soviet ""Leonov"" is a dark, claustrophobic mess reminiscent of any of the ship landscapes in the ""Alien"" movies or Imperial cargo holds in ""Star Wars"" with wires dangling everywhere and random computer machinery stuffing it.

- While some of its CG attempts are admirable, they made some very clearly wrong choices, such as the scene with the Astronaut and Cosmonaut floating out in open space to reach the Discovery One---almost every shot of them against the black background is just a jarring jerk out of immersion, as you can very clearly see that the shadows and darkness on their space suits are amazingly bright compared to the pure blackness of the space behind them, and in some cases you can even see the green bleed-through of a Green Screen or something.

2001 didn't try as audacious space-walk attempts as this, but for the instances where it did have an astronaut in space, they were completely and totally THERE!  It was perfectly seamless, perfect technology for a pre-CGI age.

As well, Jupiter in this movie looks not only completely different from the one in 2001, but looks HORRIBLE.  It looks cartoonish.  It looks like it was drawn for a 1970s cartoon.

- For my tastes, far too much time is spent on Earth where we clearly do not need to spend.  An example is the overly long, laborious, and needlessly hostile conversation between the Russian ambassador and Dr. Floyd in the very beginning of the movie.  The whole ocean-playing scenes as well seemed to me a total Red Herring, as it did nothing to establish Heywood Floyd's relationship with his son, and his relationship with his son played almost no role whatsoever in the movie.

- As well, the movie begins with a prologue that in my view, only reinforces the feeling of mediocrity of the film.  It gives us a largely pointless ""recap"" of what happened in ""2001"", using still photos from the film that play off less like a ""tying-in"" from one movie to another, and more like an amateur fan-site's ""study guide"" to the most basic and bare-bones events and plot of the movie.

- Another HORRIBLE decision is to step back from Kubrick's genius decision of silence, and added SOUND IN SPAAAAAAAAACE!  It's a huge detraction, not just comparing and considering ""2001"", but many of the sequences which are almost complete mirrors from 2001 (ex, a pod being released from Discovery One) or epic scenes like the end involving Jupiter.

- Keir Dullea returns as David Bowman, but I was slightly disappointed in that his role felt largely useless.  He DID have two vital points in the film for brief exposition, but for the most part, he was little more than a cameo.  What only made this worse is how during his conversation with Heywood Floyd, he randomly switches appearances from his last-known self (Regular Dave), to his three Older Selves (as seen in the final sequence of 2001), to one brief shot of him as the Starchild in which he (and I am not joking) WINKS at Floyd.  WINKS.  And that's it.  One whole shot of THE ONLY THING ON THE COVER OF THE DVD/BLU-RAY, and all it does is WINK.

- Roy Scheider, to me, was a colossal disappointment as Heywood Floyd.  Heywood Floyd was already established to me in ""2001"" as played by William Sylvester.  Maybe he looked too old or he refused to sign on, or they didn't even bother, but Roy Scheider looks nothing like William Sylvester.  Even worse, he doesn't even try to act like the Heywood Floyd established by William Sylvester.

William Sylvester's Heywood Floyd was a calm, bemused sort of gentleman.  Roy Scheider's Heywood Floyd is pretty much an [...].  An amiable asshole, but an [...]nonetheless.  He's got a slippery, sly, jerkish demeanor to him all throughout, joking at inappropriate moments, attempting to dominate crew members that don't answer to him, that sort of thing.  He's a completely different character going by the same name.

- The soundtrack is largely 80s-style synthesizers, which rarely works in the scenes it is placed in.

- It's attempts to try to explain all the things that had occurred in the previous movie, and their future implications, often ranges from unnecessary to downright pathetic---like someone who didn't get the first movie at all trying to explain it all realistically (though still very soft sci-fi), all throughout the entire sequel.

- For the Blu-Ray release, they did not do a very good job with the transfer.  I'd say it's better than a DVD transfer, but much of the special effects are still very fuzzy, soft, and scratchy, and a lot of times when faces are in view, the screen gets soft.

While that sounds like a lot, it is SHOCKINGLY not enough to render this movie total garbage.

The good:

- The story is still highly compelling.  Likely the work of Arthur C. Clarke's original book.

- The relationship between Walter Curnow (John Lithgow) and Maxim Brajlovsky (Elya Baskin) was very quick and brisk in building up, and yet it still worked magnificently.

- The scanning of Europa's surface (without spoiling) was a very tense, edge-of-your-seat type thing for a science fiction fan like me.

- Douglas Rain as HAL9000 steals the show, as usual.  The entire dilemma at the end of whether or not to tell HAL the truth is made all the more tense by HAL's unchangeable, unshaking monotone and childlike questioning.

- HAL9000's final scene and end is a tear jerker in itself.  I still get teary-eyed remembering his question to Dr. Chandra (""Will I dream?"")

- The end sequence involving Jupiter was fantastic, even for the special effects limitations, and the shots of scenes from Earth with two suns were realistic and gutwrenching.

- The final scene on Europa, with its music choice... a pure bit of ""2001""'s style of cinema.  Amazing and spellbinding and epic.

Whether you can accept it or not, ""2010"" is the sequel to ""2001"".  Unfortunately, it is destined to mediocrity, and does not attempt to rise above that overall feeling throughout.",1251849600,6,7168,4.720836685438456
386808,3,6301963660,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE ""BLU RAY"" VERSION Of ""2010..."" ***

When MGM began making ""2010: The Year We Make Contact"" in February 1984, the CD was in its infancy, nothing was digital and portable and the Internet and the global sharing of ideas and images was non-existent. Showing its film age badly - in one particular scene Roy Schreider even talks of information being given to his astronauts on 'cassettes' - on board a Jupiter spaceship mission for God's sake! Even the television monitors were black screens with monosyllabic block lettering on them and nothing else... Why mention all of this, because it has of course - in some places - dated the film very badly...

But - and this is a big but - for its time (finally released in 1985), ""2010"" was an extraordinary vision and a technological marvel. It provided the moviegoer with a superbly detailed and realistic depiction of future space travel, shots of the majestic Jupiter and its moons Io and Europa that were and still are incredibly accurate. Even the story of the Americans and Russians coming together so as not to annihilate each other was both relevant and damn good - and made for a great end message by Bowman (Keir Dullea - who looked like he hadn't aged a day since 1968's original ""2001""). Throw in model makers from the Star Wars Trilogy, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, Poltergeist and Ghostbusters - and the goodies were bound to be on display and they are. Which brings us unfortunately to the bad news...

...this is one of those instances where the enhanced BLU RAY image has only worsened an already hazy print...

You see - once you go from the entirely model-led outside shots (say of outer space) which are clean, beautiful and impressive to look at - into the interior shots and live action on dimly-lit stages - the blurriness and shading act as a direct contrast to the clarity you just saw - it drive you nuts. And because a good 70 to 80% of the movie is 'inside' - the effect of the wonderfully realized and designed interiors is almost completely lost. It's like watching Aliens without the clarity - or Star Wars on blurry videotape. It's as if a heavy filter hangs over every frame - and it makes the BLU RAY picture feel and look very dated.

Don't get me wrong - the picture 'is' lovely in some places - but in the main - it's not - which is a huge disappointment.

The only real extra is a 10-minute 1984 'making of' called ""2010; The Odyssey Continues"" which is fascinating and contains very brief interviews with all the principals - Roy Scheider as Dr. Floyd, Helen Mirren as the Russian pilot Tanya, John Lithgow as Dr. Curnow, Elya Baskin as the loveable Russian Max, Bob Balaban as Chandra the genius who created Hal-9000 - Discovery's malfunctioning computer (voiced by Douglas Rain). There's interesting stuff too with Richard Edlund the model maker - the make-up people - interior designs - even words from author Arthur C Clarke and director Peter Hyams about the screenwriting process in 1983 when they were prepping for the film.

I really had such high hopes for this BLU RAY release, but unfortunately I'd say hire it first before you buy...

The film was - and still is - excellent - an impressive one even. But this BLU RAY reissue of it is anything but.

It's not ""full of stars"" folks, it's pushing three.

I personally found it disjointed, and I'm sorry, but flashy images and makeup does not make a good movie. Sci fi needs action and adventure to be successful. Once it becomes elete, it no longer is a movie, instead it becomes a unique piced of art only appreciated by the select few who find it interesting. But if you want a successful movie that sells tickets to the general public, sci fi and non sci fans alike, you have to have adventure and a story that can be followed without being constantly derailed by having to think hard on what you just saw. This movie has the action and adventure. It has good actors and characters, and a suspensful story that you can watch, see an honest beginning, and follow it to the end, in a straight line to it's completion. Gene Roddenberry marketed Star Trek as ""Wagon Train"" to the stars. Wagon Train was a good, old fashioned, adventure story. You didn't have to ponder why they were on horses going where they were going. This movie is Wagon Train. Sit back, get the popcorn and enjoy a fantastic trip to the moons of Jupiter.

The movie brings the story behind the mad HAL-9000 computer, the monoliths, and the astronaut Dave to a more understandable conclusion than in ""2001"". The cinematography is nearly as beautiful and accurate as the original.

My only real complaint is that the ""Star Child"" is left entirely unexplained despite its prominence at the end of ""2001 Space Odyssey"".

The now-completely-dated Cold War scenario is more history than the first film itself.  The HAL 9000 is reawakened and is all better now.  The happy ending is so hokey that even Steven Spielberg would've been hesitant to go with it.

In Kubrick's film, his atheistic sensibilities chronicle the origins of man while hoping for some higher intelligence.  Since he couldn't grasp that intelligence himself, he created the eerie monolith and left most of its power and identity a mystery--which gives the original film its aura of the unknown.  The universe is a cold and unforgiving place through his lens, which gives 2001 another layer of meaning and style.

This sequel, on the other hand, is just pure recycled 1950s melodrama.  It's a good cast.  The special effects aren't too bad.  But the ending is just pure cotton candy.

This movie should NEVER have been made, period! This was a blind buy and a regret, sold the next day. It is basically the exact opposite of 2001. Everything that was cool about 2001, this movie makes cheap and ugly. It looks like they filmed it on the ""set of 2001"" instead of the actual spaceship, like 2001 appeared to be filmed on. The whole movie looked cheap and dialogue is borderline moronic. Special effects were terrible and this movie is an abomination to sci-fi of which I am an avid fan.

Considering the fact that this is an old catalog title I wasn't expecting too much but for $13.99 and free (Prime) shipping it was too much of a bargain to pass up. For the most part the film has a soft look but some scenes look fairly sharp. The movie is on a BD50 disc but the only extras are a featurette ""2010: The Odyssey Continues"" and the theatrical trailer. The TrueHD sound is an improvement over the old Dolby Digital 5.1 on the DVD but is only important in a few scenes like the one that involves 'air-braking' and the Jupiter explosion otherwise much of the movie is just dialog.

386913,5,6301963660,"After initially being disappointed by the Blu-Ray release of 2010 I'm happy to apologise for panning the video quality of the transfer to 1080p. After recently (February 2011) seeing the Blu-Ray played on my brother's big screen Samsung full HD plasma unit (which has much better contrast and accurate black than the Sony Bravia LCD) I realise that what I thought was video noise in some darker scenes, is actually just the original film grain. That film grain is not noticeable on the DVD versions purely because it is smoothed to a blur by that inferior system which has at best only a sixth of the video data of Blu-Ray.

Seeing film grain is a good thing - specific film stock which tends to show grain is especially chosen by cinematographers because it performs better in certain circumstances, such as the many low light scenes in 2010, and in Donnie Darko.

So while it seems that good plasma screens will show the Blu-Ray of 2010 at its best, those of us who speak English will benefit greatly from the surround soundtrack being offered in Dolby TrueHD, which is at least 10 times more detailed than the DVD's highly compressed Dolby 5.1. The Blu-Ray also offers a choice of Dolby 5.1 in English, French, Spanish and German.

The Blu-Ray includes a fine mini-featurette on the making of the film (the featurette is in original DVD quality).

My late brother bought a can of ""anti-glare"" spray which he used to coat the screen of his cathode ray tube TV - and while it did reduce the reflected glare from his window, it also slightly blurred everything (which Paul thought was an improvement). Some people may similarly misinterpret the inherently slightly blurry image from DVD as being more pleasant than the crisply detailed image which is possible with Blu-Ray. I now understand and appreciate that this Blu-Ray edition of 2010 has been properly and very carefully managed in its transfer from film to 1080p and I can highly recommend it.",1240272000,7,1950,4.777448071216617
386914,2,6301963660,"I like this film and came close to buying it on various formats over the years. When the blu arrived, I thought: This is it. Well, MGM really dropped the ball on this one. Parts of the film look fine, but some of the effects shots are a disaster. It looks like they used unfinished elements (?). Color is WAY off in many composite shots (and full of pulsating digital artifacts). There are also a number of painfully obvious traveling mats. Jupiter looks too gaudy, like a big jaw breaker (instead of soft and mysterious, as in 2001), but that may be the way it looked theatrically. What a shame they didn't go the extra mile on this transfer.",1240099200,4,643,4.411764705882353
386915,4,6301963660,"2010 is one of my favorite movies.  I saw it in the theater.  I owned in on DVD for many years and have watched it dozens of times.  When it was released on Blu-ray this week, I ordered it NEXT DAY SHIPPING.  Get my drift?  Well, I should have saved my money.  It looks a tiny bit better on Blu-ray than it does on DVD.  There are no extras on the Blu-ray disc that are not on the DVD disc. The sound is no better.  In other words, if you own it on DVD, don't bother with the Blu-ray.

That said, I think this movie is grossly underated by most people.  As Stephen Hawking himself has said, most science fiction movies are merely westerns set in space.  2010 is different.  Here there are real human emotions.  I can't be too specific without spoiling some of the surprise, but let me make one example.  When the movie came out I was very dissapointed that an Indian actor was not cast in the role of Dr. Chandra.  Bob Balaban's performance in this role, however, is perfect.  His character created the HAL9000 supercomputer (which as I recall was at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana in the book and portrayed in the movie as the University of Chicago--how's that for nitpicking?)  Balaban shows us a Dr. Chandra who feels for his machines as he would another human being, and there are some very touching scenes in the movie.  At one point Dr. Chandra is asking HAL's follow-on SAL9000 to help him model what will happen if SAL's higher functions are removed, mimicing what happened to HAL.  SAL asks him, ""Will I dream, Dr. Chandra?""  Chandra replies, ""I don't know.  Perhaps you will dream of HAL, as I often do.""  It's a nerd's delight. I love it! Balaban perfectly captures the character, and gives him intelligence and feeling.

The rest of the cast is extremely strong:  Roy Scheider, Helen Mirren, John Lithgow, and others do a great job.  Look for Dana Elcar in the opening scenes at the VLA in New Mexico, and Arthur C. Clarke makes a cameo feeding pigeons in front of the White House.  The story line is much more accessible than 2001, yet the movie contains many of the hallmarks of an Arthur C. Clarke story--IDEAS--not space battles.

I'm downgrading the rating by one star because of the inexcusable poor Blu-ray transfer.  But I highly recommend you see this movie!",1239753600,10,2295,4.53170731707317
386936,4,6301963660,"I've always loved this film, but let's face it, it's never gotten much love from WB.  The standard DVD is non-anamorphic and just doesn't look very good, especially on a large screen.  The Blu-Ray is a big improvement in this regard.  However, I doubt much (if any) work was done in the way of restorative work to the master, and there are no extras beyond those found on the standard DVD.

All that said, it's been priced very fairly, and I DON'T see Warner re-releasing it in two years with a sparkling new transfer and a boatload of new extras. So, if you like this film, don't fear the ""double dip"" - just scoop it up, because this is probably as good as it will ever get, at least until the NEXT video format rolls around!",1239667200,,727,4.323529411764706
386937,4,6301963660,"First, the disc itself:

There are a lot of reviews on Amazon for various editions. This review is for the Blu-Ray, not the DVD. Yes, the DVD was a cheap, non-anamorphic quickie release. But rest assured, the Blu-Ray is in anamorphic 1080p resolution and faithfully presents the 2.4:1 image of the original film.

This is a bare bones release, to be sure. The only extras are a 9 minute TV piece about the making of and a theatrical trailer, both in SD. We don't even get a commentary track. Pretty weak, all told.

The picture quality is good, not great. Certainly, it is light years ahead of the old DVD release. But it is nowhere near the level of ""2001"" on Blu-Ray. Blacks are generally very solid, and detail can be striking in some scenes. Color is also very rich, especially in the space scenes. However, there are three issues with this transfer: One, the additional resolution and color depth easily exposes the matte lines on the 1980's optical effects; Two, there is some color banding and posterization on the monolith itself, presumably this is in the source material, but it should have been fixed; Three, there are several effects shots, mostly space-scapes, which display a sort of horizontal ""juddering"" back and forth.

Either way, this is as good as the film has probably ever looked, and probably will ever look. It is clear that WB didn't pull out all the stops in cleaning up and restoring this film for Blu-Ray release (as they did for 2001). It probably represents a very faithful transfer of whatever film elements they have in their archive. It thus has strengths and weaknesses. It certainly does things which even a good DVD cannot do. It just doesn't shine the way the best Blu-Rays can (the Blu-Ray release of 2001 among them).

The audio is relatively uninspiring as well. Don't expect a roof-rattling sonic experience which tests all of your surround speakers. It is a very front-loaded soundtrack, but clear enough for what it is.

The movie:

Many pooh-pooh 2010 as the red-headed stepchild of the ""masterpiece"" 2001. Well, I'll agree that 2001 has a certain austerity and mystery that make it live in the memory of the viewer. It is a classic. But 2010 is no slouch as an entertaining science fiction film.

In its 2 hours, we are given explanations to some of the mysteries of the earlier film, as well as a continuation of its plot. Also, we are treated to some vintage 1980's Cold War drama. Overall, it is a very tightly paced drama, with good characters and performances (especially Roy Scheider and Helen Mirren), and generally very good effects. It looks, sounds, and plays out like a movie which deserves to rank among the better sci-fi flicks of the past 40 years.

Really, my only beef with it is the production design of the computers. All those bulky CRT monitors really kind of threaten to take me out of the moment, especially when the earlier film maintained such a ""timeless"" look - but suspension of disbelief puts me back. It is very easy to feel charitable towards this film, given its faithfulness to the material, good acting, and crisp pacing.

At this price, if you're a sci-fi fan and you are purchasing 2001 on Blu-Ray, there's no reason not to get this as a logical companion piece. Seeing as how you can probably own both for under 30 bones, it's pretty much a no-brainer. This is an entertaining film, a fine if slightly problematic transfer (though probably the best we could have expected), and a good buy overall for fans of the original and genre fans in general. It's also a nice movie to have on hand if you introduce someone to the original and are met with frustrated bewilderment on your audience's part.",1239667200,75,3676,4.694099378881988
386938,3,6301963660,"I was hoping that it would be an improvement over the DVD version of this that I have, which is dark in several spots, and has a variety of camera flair and special effects errors.

386940,4,6301963660,"I've always enjoyed 2010 and it finally gets a transfer that doesn't suck. However, it's the poorest looking film I have on Blu-ray. It's whoppingly better than the previous DVD release (for shame MGM) but it's in need of some cleanup. The ship board scenes are very grainy, and I'd swear I'm seeing superimposition lines for some of the special effects (especially when the probe to Io is launched). However, a lot of it does look pretty good, especially some of the later space scenes.

The blu-ray release is essentially good enough that I can watch the film without wincing at how bad the video transfer is. And for the price, it's hard to argue that we should have gotten a restoration. But I still hope that one day this film will get a restoration because it's a really engrossing tale in its own right.",1239235200,4,810,4.586206896551724
386941,3,6301963660,"2010 is a respectable sequel to 2001, though not as awe-inspiring.  In terms of video, the Blu-ray is superior to any previous standard DVD release.

386942,4,6301963660,"Standing on its own, this was actually a very good movie.  It was a different style than its big brother, lacking the ""mystic"" overtones and also lacking the bizarre imagery which made 2001 incomprehensible to so many people.  This movie is NOT incomprehensible, with a very clear storyline.  The special effects are technically better than the first movie (not surprising, given the advances in movie technology).  And, they're inserted naturally into the storyline instead of being highlighted and framed like they were in the first movie, which frankly made 2001 pretentious at times.  The movie is a little dated in that it pits the US against the old USSR.  Of course, the years specified in BOTH movies (2001 and 2010) are either gone or almost here, and the reality of space exploration is far less than what these movies envisioned.  Still, I found this to be a satisfying continuation of the first movie, with a moving ending.  If you're bothered by the fact that it actually explains away some of the incomprehensibility of the first movie, so be it.

BTW I notice many reviewers denigrating the DVD (NOT the movie) based on aspect ratios and quality.  I'm writing this review for the upcoming Blu-Ray release, which WILL be in 2.40 : 1.

But complications soon arise when the USA and USSR essentially enter into a state of war. The U.S. crew members are ordered into the abandoned Discovery, but will the warfare on Earth ultimately place roadblocks on peace in space and the cooperation in science and technology? HAL and Bowman  just may have the last word in the matter.

Based on 2010: Odyssey Two by Arthur C. Clarke, the book and movie are sequels to the iconic 2001: A Space Odyssey. Director, producer and screenwriter Peter Hyams takes on the task with a possible new beginning in the coldness of outer space and a spark to bring sanity to the vicious political chess games.

Roy Schneider is the disgraced Dr. Heywood Floyd - the scapegoat for the Discovery debacle - while John Lithgow and Bob Balaban portray, respectively, Dr. Walter Curnow and Dr. Chandra, who are all part of the U.S. team to Jupiter.

To tackle a sequel to a Sci-Fi classic that has had a unique spot in pop culture seemed to be a no-win situation for Hyams and the cast. And though the effort falls short of matching 2001: A Space Odyssey, the message from space is a timeless one as long as small minds tackle issues of a global scale.",1234224000,3,1496,4.609022556390977

386972,4,6301963660,"Having not seen it in a while, I watched this movie on DVD the other day, a day or so after also re-visiting ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".  My verdict?  ""2010"" shouldn't be faulted for simply being an intelligent, solid movie while its predecessor was a filmic milestone.  One thing that this later film does just as well as the earlier one, however, is its communication of the wonder and danger of space travel and space exploration.  Two examples of this:  the tense slingshot-around-Jupiter braking sequence with the Russian vessel and, later, the two astronauts moving toward and boarding the slowly-spinning-out-of-control U.S.S. Discovery.

Other plusses: a great stable of actors (Roy Scheider, John Lithgow, Helen Mirren, and Bob Balaban join Keir Dullea from the first film), a resistance to over-explaining the alien monoliths from the earlier story (though we get a little more about their possible aims and purpose), and just a general air of intelligence.  On this last point: although the film is definitely more conventional and mainstream than ""2001"", there's a refreshing non-reliance on cheap thrills and other typical movie conventions.  Yes, the ""we should all get along"" political message (not a part of the original novel) is a little clunky, but I'm willing to forgive that

My DVD of ""2010"" came out a few years ago, has an adequate level of visual clarity (though no more than that), and a somewhat interesting, though ultimately bland, nine-minute ""behind the scenes"" featurette that was apparently produced back in 1984 as an introduction to special showings of the film.  Unless another DVD edition has already come out since then, this interesting, well-crafted example of 1980's science-fiction filmmaking really deserves a better-looking, more generously equipped DVD.",1232409600,,1795,5.288732394366197

The acting is superb and the plot makes complete sense.  In the end, one actually feels attached and sympathetic to Discovery.  If you liked the first, this will probably seem less stellar; but if you found the first thought-provoking, albeit confusing, then this movie will help you understand its predecessor substantially.",1218412800,,558,5.177777777777778
386974,5,6301963660,"2010 is a wonderful continuation of 2001. It is well acted and has plenty of technical reality straight from NASA for its day. There are no science fictions that come as close to real weightless space travel then 2001 and 2010. These two highest quality movies show the positive ingenuity that ambitious mankind can create and dream about from childhood.

A quality science fiction movie is NOT one that relies on violence of sex to sell the movie. Filling time with violence is the lazy way to fill time in a movie and dash the hopes of young children. We need more quality movies such as 2001 and 2010 in which our humans ingenuity and dreams come true.

Since 2010 is a timeless classic, 2010 MUST be rendered into High Definition with the upmost care for detail of picture quality.

2010 explains the odd behavior of HAL9000 in 2001. Hal was forced into acts of death by directive of the White house, due to White house folks who would not share information to the public but placed the top secret into HAL's memory and directed HAL to protect it's release at all costs. An intelligent being like HAL would constantly dig at such locked code and be suspicious (just as NORTON virus protection is today). This locked code is the same as we would describe today as a computer virus and a virus is very hard to get rid of.

386975,4,6301963660,"This movie came out during Reagan's reign, when the Cold War was still running pretty hot. The race to Jupiter, to the abandoned Discovery craft from 2001, turns into another expression of that strange time. Political rivals are forced into close but uneasy cooperation, and the joint mission turns into an friendship that neither side would admit to. When the Earthly saber-rattling becomes loud enough to hear all the way out at Jupiter, the two parties are ordered to separate. Then, as promised, something wonderful happens - but the kind of ""wonderful"" best appreciated from a few million miles away.

That's where Clarke's newscaster style of storytelling really works best. Fantastic engineering feats under near-impossible conditions, natural grandeur, and world-shaking cataclysms don't need a lot of shouting and exclamation points. Clarke's story and Hyam's direction let the inherent drama speak for itself.

Even though it's almost a quarter century old at this writing, it's held up well. Only the most jaded of effects-fans could fault the presentation, and the optimistic ending combines the right mix of explanation and mystery. You won't find chases and explosions here - well, not exactly - just a good story and an enjoyable movie.

386977,4,6301963660,"This film was a good sequel to 2001, but really only a 3-1/2 or 4 star movie experience for me.  I personally enjoyed the basic plot and credit Clarke with writing an excellent film with much more human interest and explicit narrative than the original movie.  The model work and zero gravity special effects were all beautifully done, but not nearly as innovative as what was accomplished under Kubrick's direction in 2001.

There was one scene (available on UTUBE)in which the Russian spacecraft employed aero-braking to enter the orbit of Jupiter which was very credibly done using what I believe was a blow torch and the animation of Jupiter's ""surface"" in the background.  This was visually new for a sci-fi film and the appearance of a hypersonic wake heated to incandescence by atmospheric friction looked correct in form right down to the leading edge stagnation point in the flow field.  Someone had a good feel for what had to be done, and I believe did it by the seat of their pants with blow torch in hand using slow motion photography. It was, however, the only imagry which really excited the ""engineer"" in me.

2010 considered some interesting questions regarding HAL, the (AI) computer from 2001. In another scene available on UTUBE, Dr. Chandra was concerned with what would happen when attempts were made to restore connections to HAL's higher brain functions after such a prolonged shutdown by Dave Bowman and subsequent exposure to cryogenic temperatures.  He attempted to simulate this in his lab with the cooperation of SAL, also an AI computer who was asked how ""she"" would feel about it.  In Dr. Chandra's mind there was no mystery concerning the feelings and consciousness of an AI computer of the 21st century.  One of his statements during the course of the film was that life deserves respect though it be carbon or silicon based.  Of course, the rest of the crew believed Dr. Chandra's feelings for the possibly authentic emotions of HAL were misplaced since their safety and very lives were at stake. This was a pretty interesting scene and until the very end we are uncertain in weather HAL will lay down his life for the mission. All he wanted was an explanation, and quickly agreed to do what he was instructed to once he realized the deadly ramifications to the crew of his disobeying this order.

2010 also included some Hitchcock style shots of the science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke seated quietly in front of the White House (at a bench adjacent to Dr. Heywood Floyd) which document his participation in the movie for film historians.

I actually had the rare treat of seeing the late Arthur Clarke during a Connecticut showing of 2001 in the early 70's. Clarke spoke to the audience following the showing at Bushnell Memorial Auditorium and answered questions concerning the plot of 2001.  Here Clarke explained the reasons for the very visual and non-narrative screen style of 2001 as envisioned by Stanley Kubrick.",1205539200,5,2960,4.872509960159363

What you'll get will be the el cheapo snap case with Jupiter and the infant on the cover, movie by Warner Bros., which you can typically find at WalMart for $7.50.

I thought I would get a decent copy of 2010 in a keep case, what I got was the bargain bin copy in a snap case that I paid too much for.

387010,3,6301963660,"First off, the original movie 2001 is in a league of it's own, and few movies can or will ever acheive it's lofty heights.

Having said that, 2010 is a decent movie in the vein of ""Alien"" or a standard Star Trek movie, but it comes off as very 'clunky' and does nothing to stir our imagination.  One reviewer said it plays like a TV-movie, and they're absolutely right.  Something about it just seems ""off"", with abrupt scene cuts, scenes that go nowhere and just end, and absolutely no sense of wonderment or excitement.

The editing is infuriating too.  We're jarringly thrown from one scene to another with absolutely no attempt at a smooth transition.  One example that dove me nuts - they'll show the monolith floating by Jupiter with the great music playing, then cut to inside the ship with no music, then back outside with music, then inside with no music, etc.  Talk about clunky - it gets pretty damn annoying after a while.

The narration by Roy Schieder makes you think you're watching ""SeaQuest"" and is a bit of overkill as this movie just has to explain EVERYTHING.  This movie tells you exactly what's happening before, during and after it has happened, which dilutes any or all excitement.  You can definitely check your brain at the door for this one, because it doesn't require you to think about anything - it's all table-spoon fed to you constantly during the film, and that becomes annoying as well.

And there is absolutely no sense of awe or wonder in this film.  I do think it's a good Arthur Clarke story, and his stories usually end with Man or another race ascending to a higher plane of existence, and the ending here is similarly along that vein.

It was nice, however, to see Keir Dullea and hear Hal again and to re-visit some of those sets.

Another nitpick - they got the read-out screens wrong in the Discovery.  In the scene in the pilot's chair of the Discovery, when they show Hal's eye flanked by the screens, you can see that they used simple CRT screens instead of the flat screens used in 2001.  Because there is so much glare on the CRTs, the read-outs don't pop out brightly like they did in the first film.  Again, everything just seeme a little 'off' in this film.  And the awesome Centrifuge set is nowhere to be seen.

All in all, it's a decent, clunky, un-exciting journey, worth a look or two but destined to collect dust in your DVD collection.  By contrast, how many times have you seen 2001?",1182124800,3,2443,4.534246575342466
387011,4,6301963660,"True, this movie could never compare to Kubrick's ""2001,"" but I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing. Perhaps it's because I was in high school when ""2010"" came out, but I relate a lot more to the sequel than the original, which I think could have shed the beginning and final acts and still been a coherent movie.

As a stand-alone movie, it's one of the more thoughtful sci-fi films I've ever seen, and the performances are quite good, especially Dame Helen Mirren and John Lithgow. And the vidual effects...Richard Edlund does a sublime job of following in Douglas Trumbull's footsteps.

The only fault I found with the film, and this is mainly in retrospect, is Peter Hyams' choice to have the US and Russia at loggerheads, considering that no such conflict existed in either the books of ""2001"" and ""2010,"" nor in the film version of ""2001."" It dates the film somewhat, but it's still a good movie.

Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the transfer. ""2010"" has never had a decent transfer to video, and the DVD version is about as bad as it gets.

387015,5,6301963660,"I have read 2001 and 2010 and they are both very entertaining what-if novels.  However, if I had to pick one of the two film adaptations to take with me to a desert island, I would definitely choose 2010.  True, it lacks the perpetual artsiness of 2001, but that does not make its direction any less insightful, or the film itself any less worthy of its source material.  As was said in a previous entry, Hyam's stylistic vision is simply different than Kubrik's, and frankly, in my opinion, more interesting and less show-offy.  Believe it or not, it is, in fact, possible to be a fan of the novel 2001 and to not enjoy watching the film.  This isn't to say that I don't think 2001 was a very well done piece of art.  But simply because I can appreciate abstract art in a museum doesn't necessarily mean I ENJOY looking at it.  In contrast, the nice thing about 2010 is that through strong acting, beautiful (to this day) visual effects, and a very haunting score, it faithfully expresses the wonder that comes from the exploration and the investigation of the unknown that Clark goes to great lengths to try to convey in his novels.

Another nice thing about 2010 is the fact that it is accessible enough so that a viewer can understand the story without having seen 2001 ahead of time.  Best of all, however, is the fact that the script doesn't insult the audience's intelligence.  Entertaining or not, this is a thinking man's film.

In a sense, I regard this film as the slightly superior 1980's predecessor to the film Contact.  They both strive to be technically accurate, they both employ engaging visual effects, they are both very patient, and they both employ scores as evocative as the imagery on the screen.

In summary, 2010 is a truly excellent film and it is a mistake to criticize its and 2001's stylistic differences.",1168300800,7,1835,4.609230769230769
387016,4,6301963660,"After watching ""2001"" and ""2010"" back to back, some differences are obvious: is it less stylized, lacks 1960's fashions, and not a s slow-plodding as the classic.  Therefore, it is a more accessible film.  ""2001"" was about mystery, while ""2010"" is about answers.

Seeing this movie twenty years later, two things are apparent. First the special effects are top notch.  The ""Leonov"" has a cramped, dark, submarine feel that was adopted for ""Star Trek: Enterprise.""  The computer monitors--despite being non-Plasma--do the job and convey the feeling of what we are actually doing in the 21st Century.  The Jovian systems, revealed so beautifully with the Voyager probes, gives you the feeling of actually being there. Compare the external scenes with ""Silent Running.""

The second observation is that film is dated.  Keep in mind that we are watching a film that is the product of the Hollywood Culture and reflect the hopes and fears of the Hollywood Microverse--that it was made five years before the Velvet Revolution--and that Hollywood has never forgive actor Ronald Reagan for betraying the quote-unquote Cause and becoming a conservative.  In the film, the US president is an obvious effigy of Reagan.

The clash of politics is a reminder of several aspects of the 1980's scientific culture.  One is the love-hate relationship between the Scientific-Industrial Complex with the Military-Industrial Complex.  The scientists were ""high and mighty"" with their distain of the atavistic military (reread your Carl Sagan as a refresher), but they were also dependant upon the military for funding.  So the relationship is reminiscent to that of a 30-year old unemployed teenager still living with his parents and collecting an allowance, but mouthing off to dad, and not doing his chores.

Defense, which is the first order of government (Federalist 23), serves to protect life, liberty, and property; specifically the lives of the scientists, the liberty to be heretical to established orthodoxy, and the scientific hardware that they use to advance knowledge.

This leads to the last point: the film is dated because our quisling-enemies have changed.  You can see a Soviet wanting to go to the moon or using the Hubble, but you cannot see Al-Qaida doing the same thing.  Can you honestly us having a joint US- or UN-Al Qaida mission to Jupiter?  Beginning  with the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz mission, US-Russian missions are commonplace, but could we do a joint space mission that Al-Qaida or the terrorist cells?

This is, at best, an OK film.  It has none of the mystery, the art, the ambiguity, or the brilliance of 2001.  It's just a rather straightforward story.  It explains everything that happens in 2001, which isn't the point.  One of the reasons 2001 worked so well is there were no explanations.  It just happened, and you were supposed to let your mind and imagination interpret it.  And as some reviewers have noted, the bizarre inclusion of a Cold War, US/USSR military confrontation over Central America was short sighted, stupid, and now, terribly dated.  It wasn't in Clarke's original novel, and Hymas should have never put it in.  The film was made in 1984, when the US/USSR Cold War was still happening.  Most of the dialogue is ridiculously expository, with no intelligence or nuance behind it.  The fact that the film has good actors in it (most notably Roy Scheider, playing Heywood Floyd, and Helen Mirren, playing the chief scientist on the Leonov, the Russian space ship) makes it even harder to take.  The film looks like a cross between the original 2001 and Ridley Scott's Alien, two masterful science fiction films which are still startingly effective and mysterious.  2010 is puny by comparison.  The only reason the film is worth watching is that it reminds you of 2001.
The only moving scene is when Dr. Chandra (Bob Balaban) informs the newly reactivated HAL 9000 that he will be destroyed because Discovery isn't going back to Earth, and has to be jettisoned for the crew of the Leonov to live.  Douglas Rain reprises the role as the voice of HAL, and manages to make you feel for the computer like he did in the first film.

The technology and sets are incredible, the acting is very good, and seeing David Bowman again was CHILLING.

387061,3,6301963660,"'2010: The Year We Make Contact' directed by Peter Hyams and released in '84, sixteen years after classic '2001: A Space Odysessy', is a far cry from the majestic, poetic and mystical cinematic masterpiece of Stanley Kubrick. I'd compare this film to that popular series of books that have glutted the market in recent years that are geared to making particular subject matter more accessible for the intellectually challenged. Title this film ""2001 Space Odyssey for Dummies."" That's not meant to insinuate that this is a bad movie, it's just a very practical, straightforward approach to trying to understand the mystery of the awe-inspiring Monolith that has stumped a generation of film fans.

Positives: The reworking of Hall 9000 into the script and resolving the artifical intelligence programing problem that occurred during the first mission was well done. I also enjoyed the cast of characters, they were more developed and likeable than in Kubrick's film. Most of all I'm glad they didn't completely spell everything out for the viewer. The mystery of the Monolith is still left a mystery.

Negatives: The Monolith(s) are not the awe-inspiring presence they were in the original, they're just kind of there. There's also a couple of technical issues, not a widescreen presentation and rather poor, grainy picture quality.

My ultimate litmus test for any film is the repeatabliity factor. Is this a film I could enjoy watching over and over again. Unfortunately the answer is no.",1152921600,,1490,5.148760330578512

Okay people, we all know 2001 was one of the best movies of all time, but the great thing about 2010 is that Hyams didn't try to recreate any of the artistic style that Kubrick accomplished in the first film--thankfully, Hyams did his own thing. 2010 is an awesome follow-up film to 2001. The story flows very well from the end of 2001, and it's awesome to see the chraters we loved from 2001 being expanded upon.

What we get in ""2010"" is not an artistic triumph, but it is a triumph of hardware, of special effects, of slick, exciting filmmaking. This is a movie that owes more to George Lucas than to Stanley Kubrick, more to ""Star Wars"" than to Also Sprach Zarathustra. It has an ending that is infuriating, not only in its simplicity, but in its inadequacy to fulfill the sense of anticipation, the sense of wonder we felt at the end of ""2001.""

But the truth must be told:  This is a good movie.  Once we've drawn our lines, once we've made it absolutely clear that ""2001"" continues to stand absolutely alone as one of the greatest movies ever made, once we have freed ""2010"" of the comparisons with Kubrick's masterpiece, what we are left with is a good-looking, sharp-edged, entertaining, exciting space opera -- a superior film of the Star Trek genre.""

  - Roger Ebert

  Chicago Sun-Times, 1984

I could not have said it better myself - so I didn't bother trying.  This is the best, as well as the most simple and concise, argument/explaination I have ever seen for why this is not only a good movie, but hardly deserves the backlash that it gets from Kubrick devotees.  Yes, ""2001"" is a far superior film.  A masterpiece.  A classic.  ""2010,"" may not be all that - but did it want to be?  Would it dare try to top the first film, or even be anything like it from an artistic, contemplantive stand-point?  That would have been foolish.  Even if it would have succeeded on some level (which it probably wouldn't have), it still would have felt secondary, unimaginative; a hack job copy-cat.  So, being smart enough to realize that, it went in a more straight-forward direction in terms of storytelling and mystique, though it was no slouch in these departments, but turned the major efforts and attention into crafting an exciting conclusion of the themes Kubrick presented.  For what this film was (and is), and at the time, it was far superior to most of its kind.  And consider this:  what if ""2001"" had never been made?  What if this film had to stand on its own?  It would have been hailed as pretty damn impressive.  Which, looking at critic reviews, it was actually.  It's this dumb, unnecessary backlash that would make one think otherwise.

Ebert gave this film three stars out of four.  As did Leonard Maltin, and a host of other long-time critics with review books out there.  I agree whole-heartedly with them.",1145404800,,2465,4.612903225806452

The graphics are beautiful, especially when the Russian space ship arrives near Jupiter.  The mysticism portrayed in the monolith puts forth philosophical questions about how a living, loving, intelligent Creator works in the Act of Creating.  It shows that the Creator in the shape of a box cannot be contained in a box, but works in mystic and natural ways to re-Create.  This is why we call the Creator the ""Great Mystery"".  It may be a fictional story, but stranger stories have come true.

That being said, I approached this film with the right mindset as in it will NOT be like 2001 and should be viewed as just a film that tries to pick up where 2001 left off.  I think Peter Hyams was screwed no matter what here: If he makes this too much like 2001 then he'll get trashed for copying Stan the man; If he went too far his own way then he gets trashed for not sticking to the feel of the original.

I think the guy did a heckuva job with the hostile reviews he was going to get either way, it was a noble attempt at a difficult task.  I think  the acting is solid, the plot moves along nicely, and there's just enough of the old movies characters and history to keep you interested.  The special effects were good enough although the mind-bending silence of space was sometimes lost or not adhered to.  The awakening of HAL was cool  as can be and Keir Dullea's cameo was very nicely done and added a lot to the film.

No, it wasn't perfect by any means. The Cold War subplot is WAY dated and unnecessary, the ending was OK but could have been a little more mystical like 2001, and even though Roy Scheider was good in his role it would have been nice to see William Sylvester back in action.

387098,3,6301963660,"**MY ACTUAL RATING WOULD BE 3.5 STARS**

I believe reviewer Mr Robert Wilson and others have several things wrong and are perhaps being a bit nit-picky: This movie was made with the FULL co-operation and consent of Dr Arthur C. Clarke and the blessing of Stanley Kubrick!! You've got to wonder sometimes if people even see the same movie you do!

First of all, LET ME GET SOMETHING CLEAR AND STRAIGHT: Almost NOBODY is as big a fan of Kubricks' original 2001: A Space Odyssey as I am. Yet I admire Peter Hyam's version of the Arthur C. Clarke sequel novel. Visually, it has many cues that link it to the Kubrick original and the special effects even today in the 21st Century still work very well.

Hyams wisely chose NOT to emulate the style of Kubrick, which would have been a lost cause on several levels, anyway.
A: It wouldn't have been as good if he did.
B: He would have been harshly criticised for trying.
C: The general audiences of 1984 and beyond wouldn't go see such a esoteric, 'antiquated' style of movie direction anymore (More fool them, I say!).

The acting performances are uniformally good, particularly Roy Scheider and Bob Balaban. Balaban does intellectual roles better than almost anyone, though I was irritated that the character's ethnicity had been changed from Sri-Lankan/Indian. But 2010 is not without it's problems now, which are mostly retroactive: the Soviet Union doesn't exist anymore, along with the Cold War. Also, space technology in the real 21st Century is, unfortunately, nowhere near as advanced as that portrayed in the movie.

Conclusion? 2010 succeeds, but only if you think that sequels are a good idea at all. After all, this is NOT ""Highlander 2"" or ""Jaws 4"" you know!! I'd like to see this film fully remastered in Anamorphic, Hi-Def with DTS sound and a host of interviews and making-of features.",1138924800,7,1845,4.789308176100629

The Bride of Frankenstein is one example.  Another is the movie in question.  2010 takes up where 2001 left off.  It takes up with the investigation into what happened in 2001 aboard the Discovery.  It takes up the double enigmas of the Monolith and David Bowman's last words: ""My God, it's full of stars"".  It also projects into the future the political realities of the 1980s, a period in which the two great superpowers (the USA and the USSR) were poised to totally anihilate each other and the rest of the world.  It brings back into the forefront the more-or-less sidelined figure in the original: Dr. Heywood Floyd (Roy Scheider).  It brings back that seemingly maniacal supercomputer, the HAL 9000.  And it brings back (in apparition form) that unsung hero and tragic figure of the original movie, astronaut David Bowman.  Finally, it reintroduces that enigmatic figure from the original, the Monolith.  Against all this backdrop and character array, a great story is built: the story of the appearance of new life on a seemingly life-hostile environment (the moon Europa).  In the end, the characters are brought to realize the true significance of the Monolith: the harbinger of life and intelligence.

387101,5,6301963660,"Peter Hyams has some good sci-fi on his director belt notches. This sequel to the Kubrick classic tries to continue many themes of the original, such as the HAL-9000 computer, astronaut David Bowmen's spirit and the Discovery ship, it is hard to call it a necessary sequel because it ends up being an explanation of the events in 2001, trying to neatly package what was already a great mystery that could stand on its own two feet. Still 2010 can be viewed without ever watching 2001 (although you should). It is, for all intents and purposes, a new odyssey, that deals more with the enigma of the Discovery and the Jupiter Mission. There are some great names in the cast, Roy Scheider as Dr. Heywood Floyd, John Lithgow as Dr. Walter Curnow, Helen Mirren as Tanya Kirbuk and Bob Balaban as Dr. R. Chandra who set off onboard the Soviet deep space Leonov as a bunch of science-detectives to figure out what is going on with the old ship. Written by Arthur C. Clarke, this movie captures some wonderful moments, such as various space walks with glorious moving backdrops that will leave your head and stomach spinning. There is also the very memorable air-breaking manoeuvre around a planet and the final countdown escape sequence. All in all, even though this is a needless sequel it still manages to be downright awe inspiring stuff. Even some 20 years on it has still kept up with the times. Family viewing, great drama and hugely enjoyable, 2010 should be a part of any sci-fi collection.

This last departure is particularly unfortunate--the movies seldom treat us to an accurate representation of space; indeed, the original ""2001"" is the only film I can recall that attempts to do so.  Therefore, it is disappointing to encounter, in this film, sound in the vacuum of space and either the complete ignorance or the willful ignoring of the nature of weightlessness.

387105,4,6301963660,"Back in 1984 when ""2010 The Year We Make Contact"" was written by Arthur C. Clarke, no one predicted that the Soviet Union's days were numbered - and this was a year before Gorbachev came to power, before ""Glastnost"" and ""Perestroika"" that eventually led to the collapse of the USSR in 1991! The Cold War was still on and Europe was still divided by the Iron Curtain. In an interview around the time of the movie's release, Clarke explained that the purpose of his novel and later the movie, directed by Peter Hyams, was a tool to institute a better peace between the two superpowers, especially at the end when Hal sent a message targeted to Earth as instructed by astronaut Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) that the two nations could co-exist in a better world, and by sharing the discoveries of our outer worlds.

Technology used in the movie was, of course, of early 1980s design (you could hear some Dot Matrix printers in a computer room when Heywood Floyd [Roy Scheider] was checking Discovery's orbit) and since then twenty-first century technology had improved drastically. Like ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" Richard Strauss' opening theme ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" was also used at the beginning of this film. The tempo of Strauss' famous theme was a little too fast and a little too rich in instrumentation, especially where the music fades prior to the opening scene.

The graphic effects were excellent, especially when both cosmonaut Maxim Brajlovsky (Elya Baskin) and astronaut Walter Kurnow (John Lithgow) make the transfer from the Leonov to Discovery over Jupiter's innermost major satellite, Io, Discovery was orbiting on a crash course toward this violent, pizza-colored, volcanic moon. The scene where you see Io's surface far below Curnow's feet as he drifted above looked better on the movie screen. It would definitely look great in 3D or in HDTV. Unlike ""2001"" where there was silence in the space scenes (there is no sound in space), sound was added in the space scenes.

Scheider's role as Dr. Heywood Floyd was far different than the way William Sylvester portrayed the character in the original film where he was mild-mannered. In ""2010"" Dr. Floyd was more sarcastic and would engage in a spat or two with his Russian counterpart, Tanya Kirbuk (Helen Mirren). This was the way Scheider wanted to perform him anyway since that was more fitting to his criteria.

The movie, overall, is very good and one not worth missing.",1121558400,,2434,4.914841849148418
387106,4,6301963660,"This is a good sequel to the classic sci-fi movie, 2001: A Space Odyssey. While it doesn't make the kind of impact its predecessor does, 2010 definitely scores some points in its own right. Solid plot. Solid story. Good special effects. As far as sequels go it achieves both consistency with the original while being in a different category than 2001.

Keep in mind, ladies and gentlemen, that this is NOT the same movie as 2001. This movie isn't a space opera with infinite attention to details and style. This is more of a straightforward space movie. Don't get me wrong. You get a good dose of atmosphere in 2010. It's just not the strong overdose of 2001. Above all it's a good tie in between movies, and the uber-mysterious monolith has even more of a focal point here.

Technically the movie is solid. The underlying events with the Russians date the movie, but the storyline isn't damaged by it. In fact it's a really nice story. It fills in most of the gaps and answers the questions the last movie left behind. Don't expect to know the secrets of the monolith by the way. Some things are better left a mystery. They picked good actors in this film, but I have a trouble with Roy Sheider as Dr. Floyd. Not because of Sheider's abilities, but because that part was originally played by William Sylvester and the two actors don't look alike. Not really that big a problem, but I'm a stickler for continuity.

The ships and tech are pretty impressive; especially the innovative way they conserve fuel. They do take some artistic license when it comes to gravity now and then, especially in one scene where there is gravity yet the pens are floating. Again that's just a minor detail. The coolest part about the movie is how it all comes together in the end. I can't say anything about it because it would ruin it for those of you who haven't seen it. But believe me, it's big.

As long as you don't put your expectations on 2010 to be just like 2001 you really enjoy this movie. It continues the story of our world in this alternate future and how the monolith fits into it.

In other words, it's rather lacking in depth and originality, but if you like that sort of Hollywood claptrap with a sizable helping of melodrama, then the movie is agreeable enough.  Helen Mirren does a remarkable job creating a compelling character with no help from the screenplay, and Roy Scheider is fun to watch, as always.

watched 2001 for the first time in college. I had no intention of seeing the sequel because I knew it was not made by Kubrick and felt it would probably be very inferior. However, my roommate, decided to rent it and I watched it. Even though my parents gave it to me a couple of years ago, I have had no desire to actually watch it. But since I have vowed to review all the movies in my collection I did my duty this evening. I was mildly surprised, but not at all impressed.

In watching this movie I did my best to remove the idea that this is a sequel out of my head and just tried to enjoy it as a sscience fiction film. This was increasingly difficult since a great deal of time in this film is spent going back and explaining all of the events in 2001. This is probably my greatest complaint about the film. Where 2001 works not by not giving any answer, 2010 works too hard to give meaning not only to itself, but also 2001. Where 2001 is silent, allowing images to tell the story, 2010 fills nearly every moment with noise.

The visuals of 2010 were very well done. I felt the images of the space ships, planets, and space travel were quite nice. The special effects, in general, were also very nice. The film does get severely dated with it's cold war subplot. Americans and Russians working together in space while their political counterparts wage war on the Earth below may have been effective at the time, but today it only seems cheesy.

I have not read the books to 2001 or 2010 so I do not know if their explanation of HAL's ""malfunction"" are the same as the movies. I can't help but feel disappointed with the explanation either way. I have always felt that part of the power of 2001 was how it didn't answer many of the questions it asked. How there was no explanation of where the monoliths came from, no explanation of what went wrong with HAL, no explanation of what the long sequence at the end meant. It's as if by not giving us explanations, the viewer has to fill in the gaps. In 2010 we get more answers than we need. Any real explanation of why HAL went bad, no matter how logical, seems to dull the experience of watching 2001. Now again, I haven't read the books, where I believe those very things are explained. So those who have read the books may not feel the same way, but this is my experience.

In the end, that is the better way to sum up my feelings on this movie. If you have never read the books, but find 2001 to be an immensely satisfying film experience then 2010 is most likely to be disappointing. However, if you have read the books and have already had much of the meaning behind 2001 explained to you, then you may find more enjoyment out of the sequel. Likewise, if you have never seen the art that is 2001, or found it too heady to understand, then 2010 may be an enjoyable piece of science fiction.

This two-hour 1984 movie is intended to be a sequel to Stanley Kubrick's 1968 masterpiece ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""  However, this sequel is self-contained.  That is, you don't have to see Kubrick's movie or read Sir Arthur C. Clarke's 1982 novel (""2010: Odyssey Two"") to understand this movie.

Why do I say this?  Because this sequel begins by letting the viewer read the mission report filed by the mission specialist named Dr. Heywood Floyd (a minor character in Kubrick's movie and now portrayed in this movie by Roy Scheider) who was involved (on planet Earth) with the 2001 mission to planet Jupiter.  According to this report, when the mission ended, the talking supercomputer (with the voice of Doug Rain, reprising his role for this movie) named HAL (that controlled the American spaceship called ""Discovery"") malfunctioned and was disconnected.  As well, this spaceship was abandoned near Jupiter by its only survivor, Commander Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea, reprising his role for this movie).  Just before Bowman disappeared, he had discovered an alien artifact or monolith in orbit around Io, one of Jupiter's moons.

As the movie progresses, we learn that the Russians plan to send a spaceship (called ""Leonov"") to intercept the Discovery.  The Russians allow the Americans to let three of their specialists go along with them.  (Two of these specialists are Floyd and Dr. Chandra, the genius who created HAL.)  So this movie is about a joint Russian-American crew on the Leonov being sent in the year 2010 to intercept Discovery and essentially find out what happened to Discovery, Bowman, and HAL.  As well, they are to learn more, if possible, about the alien monolith.  By the end of the movie, the viewer has most of these unknowns answered.

This 1984 movie follows Clarke's 1982 novel fairly well.  However, one addition not in the novel is the cold war that takes place between the Russians and Americans back on the Earth.  (This reflects the actual world political tensions that were occurring in the 1980s.)  I'm not sure why this was added but it, unfortunately, dates the movie.  One omission in the movie that's in the novel was a Chinese mission to Jupiter.  By omitting this mission, the viewer will probably not understand why Europa (one of Jupiter's moons) is so important.  I was also disappointed in the portrayal of Dr. Chandra (whose full name is Sivasubramanian Chandrasegarampillai).  In the 1982 novel, he is a short, Hindu computer genius but this movie portrays him differently.

I said above that the movie is self-contained.  It is true that this movie is easy to follow and is straightforward.  However, to understand the finer nuances of it, it is helpful to see Kubrick's mysterious and awesome movie and to read Clarke's 1982 novel.  For example, near the end of this movie, Bowman is shown alternating from a middle-aged man to an old man to a baby.  You won't understand the significance of this unless you've seen Kubrick's movie.

Bowman's last words transmitted back to Earth during the 2001 Jupiter mission were ""My God, it's full of stars!""  This important line occurs throughout this movie.  These words are not found in Kubrick's movie but do appear in Clarke's 1982 novel.  Note that this line originally appeared in Clarke's 1968 novel ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""  Also note that in this 1984 movie we are never told exactly what is full of stars.  (However we are told the answer to this in Clarke's 1982 novel and even in his 1968 novel.)

The special effects in this movie are impressive.  The images of Jupiter are also well done.  However, Io has many active volcanoes.  Surprisingly, this activity (essential to a line in the movie) was not shown.  Also, I heard noises in the vacuum of space throughout this movie!

Finally, there are small touches that make this movie interesting.  For example, there is a cameo by Clarke. (You'll have to look carefully for him).  The classical musical piece ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" (by Richard Strauss) is played during the opening and closing credits.  (This music was the famous music in Kubrick's movie.)  As well, the captain of the Leonov has the last name of ""Kirbuk"" (which is an anagram of ""Kubrick"" with the letter ""c"" missing).

In conclusion, this is a good, solid 1984 sequel that can be enjoyed by those who have not seen the first 1968 movie by Stanley Kubrick.  For those who have seen the first movie, most of your questions will be finally answered!!

387213,3,6301963660,"2010: THE YEAR WE MAKE CONTACT is the long awaited sequel to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. Now, the pressure of crafting a sequel to match the masterpiece which was Kubrick's original must have been great, and Peter Hyams was the man in Hollywood who decided to tackle this huge challege.
And he does shoulder the task quite well in reconstructing the DISCOVERY (whose miniature model was diliberatly destroyed after the filming of 2001) and bridge the gap between 2001 & 2010, but Kubrick's original casts a long shadow over 2010, and the film struggles to escape from under it, and for a brief moment it does but is quickly swallowed up again.
As you'd expect, the film takes place 9 years after 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, and has a US-USSR expidition to rendevouz with the derilct DISCOVERY, which is in a decaying orbit between Jupiter and Io. The Russian crew is originally quite cold to the American presence due to the fact that a conflict on Earth between Russia and America over South America has heated up almost to the point of WWIII. Yet these difference are over come, etc., etc., standard movie material.
The largest difference between 2001 and 2010 is the style. 2001 was a modern symphony set against the back drop of man's odyssey to the stars, with a very lathargic, artistic approach; while 2010 is a fairly straight forward sci-fi movie, that attempts to bring an atmosphere similar to the ALIEN movies (which is indirectly mention in the book).
As for style, story, acting, and ect. the film feels fairly average, there's no unique spark, no DEFINING MOMENT, and it ends with a straight forward in-your-face moral--like I said, it struggles to escape from under 2001's long shadow.
And there are some baffling additions and omissions to the book's story. For some reason Hyams felt it nessacary to remove the Chinese expidition, which results in the first discovery of organic life off Earth, from the film. Why would he cut an important keystone of the book's plot? Yet he decides to replace that with Cuban Missile Crisis-esque conflict down on Earth, which feels incredibly irrelevant in present year of 2004. I guess he did this to have the film connect more with the politics of the day, 1984 still being in the Cold War, so I guess we can't blame him for not being able to see into the future.
All-in-all the movie is worth a week long rental to watch twice. Once to see the movie, the second to point out inconsistancies between 2001, the film, and the book. While I'm still split on whether the book or the movie 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY was better, it is no contest with 2010: the book is far superior, and I recomend it highly.",1073779200,3,2644,4.663811563169165

387217,4,6301963660,"Arthur C. Clarke refused to even consider a sequel to the epic 2001 for a number of years, yet eventually he returned to the moons of Jupiter, and in 1984 movie audiences got their chance to go back themselves.  Out of all the questions left unanswered by the first film, the main question in my own mind as I began this journey was: Will anything actually happen this time?  I am happy to say that something does actually happen in this sequel, although the ending disappointed me by ignoring all kinds of valid scientific questions of a practical nature.  The film opens with a summary of the major events of 2001; this takes almost no time at all, of course.  We reunite with Dr. Heywood Floyd early on (now played by Roy Scheider), good old Hal and even Dave Bowman ....  2010 is a much more plot-driven film than 2001; while the space technology and special effects in the movie are impressive, the film never falls into extended periods of ""look at all the pretty pictures"" mode.  Furthermore, where Kubrick used classical music to impart bits of his film, 2010 director Peter Hyams actually lets words do the talking, and I for one am grateful to him for this.  Hyams even lets us in on a little bit of the mystery that was the original space odyssey of 2001.
One major difference between the first two films is the importance of the geopolitical setting on earth.  Kubrick barely alluded to the problems on earth in 2001, but now we get plenty of evidence attesting to the fact that the world is a real mess nine years later, with the United States and the Soviet Union at the brink of nuclear war.  Having taken the fall for the failure of the Discovery's original mission, Dr. Flood has left his science post and has become president of a university.  One day a Soviet scientist approaches him with a fascinating proposal.  The Soviets are going to go to Jupiter and investigate the huge black monolith there, and the Americans are at least a year behind in terms of being ready for a return mission of their own.  The Soviets want knowledge about the derelict Discovery spacecraft and the monolith out there in space.  This, plus the fact that the dead Discovery spacecraft's deteriorating orbit means it will soon crash makes it possible for Dr. Floyd, Discovery engineer Walter Curnow (John Lithgow), and Dr. Chandra (Bob Balaban), Hal's inventor, to make the journey alongside the Russians in a Soviet spacecraft.  The increasing geopolitical instability on earth will come to play a big part in the space mission.  The basic overall plan is to investigate the Discovery for any clues as to what the heck actually happened out there nine years previously and to reactivate Hal if possible and thus salvage the ship.  Something that used to be Dave Bowman puts in a few brief appearances, telling Dr. Floyd that something wonderful is about to happen but that all of the astronauts must leave sooner rather than later.  Everything is fine and dandy up until the actual conclusion.  It is as if Clarke decided to just pull a rabbit out of his hat and walk away without giving any real clues as to how the trick was performed.  Worst of all, and I have to be careful not to reveal anything about the ending here, I was left with a number of quite valid scientific questions that prevented me from taking the sappy conclusion very seriously.
All things considered, I believe 2010 is actually a better movie than 2001.  There can be no doubt that it is certainly more interesting and compelling as it does not deal with abstract thought as its primary plot device.  I especially appreciated hearing an explanation of sorts for Hal's system failure in the first movie.  The social dynamics of the American-Soviet crew made for added bits of drama that blow away the almost sterile presentation of everything in 2001.  Obviously, some people will prefer the much more grandiose, celebrated, and boring original, but 2010 presents a much better story, one which can be interpreted without need of advanced philosophical musing.",1061856000,33,4033,4.7218259629101285

However, at that young age I only liked it because it was a ""cool"" story.  I am now 27 and I just watched it again for the first time since I was a kid, and I am so glad I did because it all makes much more sense to me now.
Now granted it does have flaws scientifically speaking *SPOILER*, I have always been kind of space buff and so I immediately picked up on how implausable that ending is.  When Jupiter explodes and turns into a star, some how its moons are left untouched.  Now anyone even slightly knowlegeable in space facts knows that it is impossible for planets and moons to exist that close to a star without being insinerated.  Jupiter is a monster size planet and if it did become a star it would definitely consume all of its moons.
Still despite this glaring inaccuracy I am able to overlook it and understand what it did for the story line. Today you often hear how if there is life anywhere else in our solar system then chances are it would exist on Jupiter's moom Europa, because underneath its layer of ice there could be an ocean.  And so I believe that the point of having Jupiter explode and turn into a star was meant to draw you to the conclusion that this star would melt the ice of Europa and hence life would evolve.  I get that now, even though I totally missed that as a kid.
So I guess that what I mean by this rambling review is that this movie is outdated in its political undertones, and a bit inaccurate scientifically, but it is still a great story.  And it is one that I still enjoy 20 years later.",1053561600,3,1651,4.169811320754717

Roy Scheider leaves the hunting of sharks for a moment and joins a Russian crew en route to Jupiter. There in the orbit of Europa, one of the planet's moon, they park along-side Discovery, the now shut down spaceship that once was reigned by HAL 9000, the sinister yet pleasantly wacky computer that killed off the crew in 2001: Space Oddysey.
Here, with the typical cold war bravado, this mix of Americo-Russian scientists promised the viewer to explain the Stan Kubrick's open-ended sequences from 2001 in which Dave keeps turning from an old man into a large embryo and back and, of course, the meaning of the mysterious black monolith slab.
But no such promise is kept. On the contrary, the original quandary is further compounded. First, by the cameo appearance of the old Dave and his regaling Roy Scheider with his embryo-turning tricks. Then, by a sudden and a rather strange viral-like multiplication of these odd monoliths on the surface of Europa. Before anything is solved, understood, or explained the crew zips off back to Earth. Only a threat from Dave follows their speeding ship warning the mankind from ever attempting to land on Europa. This amalgamation of furthered confusion and the ever so apparent desperate try to match the cinematic surrealism of the 2001 film, is whipped into a frenzy in the last few frames of this flop by giving the Earth yet a second sun. But it appears that Roy Scheider enjoys the quicker tan the two suns offer him.

387251,4,6301963660,"Even though 2010 doesn't even approach the artistry, symbolism, or suspense of 2001, it's a great sci-fi movie by any other standard. The acting, camera work, and storyline are all top-notch. I appreciated how they used unique camera angles and sparser, more enigmatic dialogue at the beginning of the film. This helped to capture some of the atmosphere of 2001,  before they eased into the more ""conventional movie"" feeling that characterizes the rest of 2010. I really enjoyed most of this movie, and the scenes with the abandoned Discovery are particularly suspenseful and effective. BUT...
The movie shouldn't have tried so hard to tie up the loose ends that 2001 left (I admit I have never read the book, so I don't know how much of this was up to the director). An example of this is the mysterious fate of David Bowman. In the end of the first film, we watch Dave go through an enlightening transformation that transcends time, space, life, and death, in the dreamlike final sequence. By contrast, in 2010, Dave pops up on TV screens, interacts with people, and talks to HAL. That seems a little cheesy, given the mysticism of his original transformation in 2001. Even worse is the scene where Floyd is talking to an apparition of Dave, who cycles back and forth from a middle-aged man, to an older man, to a very old man, and back again. It seems almost like they missed the point of Dave's transformation in 2001--there was meaning behind his rapid aging in the original. He wasn't just randomly jumping around from age to age.
Also, the scene where HAL becomes a ""good guy"" seemed more than a little sappy. To me, the point of HAL in 2001 was to show how we can go too far with advancing our technology, how we can become too enamored with our own achievements, and how creating a practically living machine to serve us was crossing the line. This suggestion was underscored by HAL's dazed singing, ""I'm--half-crazy---crazy in love with you---"" as he was disconnected. Explaining and over-simplifying HAL's insanity undermines all that symbolism, and so does turning him into a ""good guy."" Or maybe I just like darker movies?
Finally, while there were some things that were explained too much, there were other elements that weren't explained enough. I'm going to talk about the ending here, which I assume is O.K. because this movie is 20 years old, but if you haven't seen it, I might spoil it here so read at your own risk. The part at the end, where Jupiter is turned into a star, is simply not explained enough. I'm probably being a little bit of a science snob, but there is no way that Jupiter's moons could exist a few thousand miles from a star without being destroyed. And, for that matter, why weren't they destroyed in the blast that consumed the Discovery? More perplexing, how could life on Earth still be normal (i.e., not fried) with a second Sun in our system? Either way, the ending is too scientifically flawed (and trust me, I'm no scientist) for the viewer to suspend belief.
To sum it up, I still think this film is well worth buying. The first 2/3 is fantastic. It doesn't try too hard to emulate 2001, but it moves into its technological-suspense-thriller mode gradually and seamlessly, so it doesn't feel inappropriate or out of sync with the original. It isn't until the last 1/3 of the movie that things start to go awry. And when they do, it's especially disappointing because the rest of it is so great!

This film, obviously the sequel to 2001, follows Dr. Floyd, one of the directors of the mission that took place in the first film. He goes on a mission to determine what happened to the Discovery, the ship that was lost in 2001.
This film, although not the same caliber as 2001, is good in it's own right. The crew discover the monolith that was found in 2001, and find that a higher intelligence has placed it there. Ultimately, they make contact with the intelligence and something happens, something wonderful.
Roy Scheider plays this role as he plays every role he takes, with every ounce of strength he has. This is one actor I can't see enough of. There isn't a movie, or TV show for that matter, he's made that doesn't show his talent. All the actors in this film, John Lithgow, etc., did the book justice.

387254,3,6301963660,"In a world of unnessary sequels, ""2010: The Year We Make Contact"" stands tall because writer/director Peter Hyams takes a very different approach from Stanley Kubrick's cold, glacial but powerful ""2001: A Space Odyssey""--he makes an tense thriller like ""Outland"" (another Hyams thriller that was essentially ""High Noon"" in outer space) that is set in space.

Heywood Floyd (the late Roy Scheider)is given the chance to find out what happened to the Discovery when the Russians offer him passage on their ship the Leonov. The ship is in a decaying orbit between Jupiter and its moons. During the long flight tensions escalate and war between the the U.S. and Russia looms. Floyd takes along Dr. Chandra (Bob Babalan) who designed HAL the onboard computer that killed the crew of the Discovery and Dr. Curnon (John Lithgow) who designed the systems for the Discovery. Floyd finds that he often butts heads with Commander Kirbuk (Helen Mirren)as he tries to unravel the fate of astronaut Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea)and what the Monolith is doing. To do all of this they'll have to revive HAL 9000 and risk that what happened before won't happen again.

Hyams does a nice job of giving viewers an overview about what happened in the previous film. Casting Scheider was a good move because he energizes the film with his presence. He and his crew had to recreate the Discovery without any of the blue prints or models for the film (they were all destroyed after production was completed). Although Hyams had to remove one of the subplots in due to budget and narrative constraints, the film flows amazingly well and works as a sequel because Hyams makes a very different kind of film from Kubrick's.

""2010"" receives a nice looking transfer that looks terrific during the visual effects sequences. The live action sequences wer always grainy looking to begin with and that look is reproduced here. The Blu-ray for ""2010"" doesn't look perfect but it looks very good with better fine detail and more accurate, brighter colors (which could be due to an adjustment of the contrast).

Sadly, Warner hasn't included any commentary track from Hyams (who wrote and directed the film from the late Arthur C. Clarke's novel)or the rest of the cast or any new featurettes. The original 10 minute promotional featurette that played on TV is included here and looks OK and we also get a ragged looking trailer for the film. Hyams, Clarke, visual effects director Richard Edlund and production designer Syd Mead are all interviewed briefly in the featurette along with the main cast members.

What matters though is the transfer of the film itself and it looks quite good even if it isn't a huge leap up from the DVD when it comes to extras. It's clear that most of the budget went to cleaning up, restoring and transfering the film and that's the most important thing here.

Clarke wrote a less ambiguous story, therefore the movie, if adapted faithfully, should be less ambiguous as well. The movie is, in fact, a faithful adaption in spirit. Many of the scenes and sequences from the book were excised but not at the expense of the story. It remains a beautiful picture with imaginative special effects from Dennis Mueren that is an entertaining reflection on the questions raised by a far superior movie.",1043798400,2,582,4.888888888888889
387256,2,6301963660,"This film is a long-time favorite of mine, but I give this DVD edition (Warner 65053) a 2 star rating because of the deceptive packaging and the DVD digital encoding used. The wording on the DVD package is as follows:
""...WIDESCREEN VERSION...preserving the 'scope' aspect ratio of its orignal theatrical exhibition. ENHANCED FOR WIDESCREEN.""
There is a lot of confusion in the marketplace due to a lack of agreement among the studios regarding the labels for the various DVD aspect ratios and their encoding, but on all other DVDs that I've seen, which bear the description ""enhanced for widescreen"", the higher resolution 16:9 digital encoding was used.  Despite the presence of this label however, this DVD is plain old-fashioned letterbox.  Even for those of us with true wide screen capability, this DVD looks like low rez letterboxed VHS.
As a result of this experience, I will be far more circumspect of all Warner editions from now on, and if I have any doubt of their being 16:9, I'll skip them. So much of this material is already on my shelf in VHS format. If I am to upgrade these titles, I insist they be true 16:9 encoded for widescreen TV.
I also dislike the cheap cardboard ""snap case"" used on nearly all Warner titles. When it comes down to choosing between which movies to buy, the bonus of an Amaray style keep case is often the deciding factor.  By saving a penny or two on these cheap cases, Warner is hurting their bottom line, over-all.  Most people I know prefer the keep case.  In the competition for the consumer's dollar, why does Warner put themselves at such a disadvantage by using such cheap and nonstandard packaging?
Come on Warner,get with the rest of the industry with your packaging, and please quit making us guess which video encoding is used. Those of us who have widescreen gear are savvy enough to understand what 16:9 means, whereas ""enhanced for widescreen"" is now anybody's guess.",1043366400,15,1924,4.783132530120482
387297,1,6301963660,"Peter Hyam's adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke's novel ""2010: Odyssey Two"" is a disaster.
The film takes on a completely different tone than what is in the novel.  Clarke's novel brilliantly follows up where ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" left off.  Many of the themes such as humankind's relationship to the universe were preserved.  The novel tells of an emerging intelligent species on Europa and how their evolution and chances for survival were aided by an unknown extraterrestrial intelligence.  The humans who were present during this happening were of no consequence and had not former human David Bowman warned them, the humans in the novel would have been destroyed.  Now, for the human part of the story, Clarke emphasizes the comraderie of scientists, American and Soviet (Clarke could not have predicted the fall of the Soviet Union) and how any political differences are meaningless in outer space.  Clarke deliberately avoids any mention of conflict between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.  Guess what?  As it turns out, he was right to do so.
""2010: The Year We Make Contact"" on the other hand, takes the opposite approach.  Hyams could not resist the temptation that since he had Americans and Soviets together, they would be in conflict.  In doing so, the film almost completely loses the real objective of going to Jupiter to begin with.  The film also loses the character that was in the novel.  In the novel, Dr. Chandra, the creator of HAL who originates from India is one of the most interesting characters.  In the film, he is another white American who shows no interesting characteristics in his personality.  Why make him totally American?  Obviously, Mr Hyams wanted to further the whole ""us vs. them"" theme that resonated throughout the film. Doctor Katherine Rudenko is a character sorely missing in the film and the characters of Curnow and Kirbuk are very much watered down as they are too busy being tense from the all the political turmoil going on. We have plenty of better films that show tensions between people of different nationalities or cultures.  In 2010, it was a distraction from what the story really is about.
In the film, David Bowman keeps mentioning ""something wonderful"" is going to happen.  This is a gross and not necessarily accurate oversimplification of what was about to occur.  Bowman, first of all, was not human anymore and was almost devoid of emotion.  So, it's doubtful he would refer to any event as ""something wonderful"".  The detonation of Jupiter, while enabling a species on Europa to thrive, also would have destroyed much of the other life on this moon.  Also, the novel speaks of life forms on the planet Jupiter itself.  Thus, in the novel, the destruction of Jupiter involved much sacrifice, whomever made the decision to convert Jupiter into a star, had to weigh the consequences of destroying a myriad of life versus dooming an intelligent species to an eventual death beneath the ice of the moon Europa.  Again, the film almost trivializes this event.
""2010: The Year We Make Contact"" is equally disrespectful of the preceeding film ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" by the late Stanley Kubrick.  While it was a [good] idea for Hyams not to try to duplicate Kubrick's style, he could have at least given some attempt to preserve the feeling of realism that 2001 is so famous for.  For example, what is with the shape of the Leonov?  (That's the Soviet ship.)  It makes no sense at all to have the ""windmill"" rotate around the axis of the ship.  I think Hyams was perhaps trying to mimic the space station in 2001 but he forgot that the only parts of the space station that would have the centripedal force that would substitute for gravity would be the ends of the rotating piece.  This makes sense in a toroid shaped space station where the entire wheel would have simulated gravity.  In the Leonov, however, there would be only two small sections where one could stand up.  The entire rest of the rotating section would appear to be a tall, narrow wall going upwards.  The rest of the ship doesn't rotate sor presumably, there would be no gravity at all there.  Yet the film shows people walking all around the Leonov except in a few instances where Hyams obviously figured it would be cool to show people or objects floating.
One of these instances is particularly awful where Heywood Floyd (Roy Scheider) walks over to a part of the ship, holds a pen in his hand, lets go and the pen remains suspended in air.  Floyd obviously encountered an unexplainable phenomenon where he and Tanya Kirbuk (Helen Mirren) are obviously affected by gravity but the pen is not.  Hyams also breaks the laws of physics by having the Discovery's engines blast its way forward.  This is okay for Star Wars and such, but not for anything from Arthur C. Clarke.
Finally, Hyams appended the final message of David Bowman to the people of Earth.  In the novel, the message was ""All these worlds are yours except Europa.  Attempt no landings there.""  Hyams had to add ""Use them together, use them in peace.""  This changes the meaning of everything because it shifts focus back to the human race.  2010 is not about the human race, at least from the extraterrestrial intelligence's point of view.  It's about the Europans.  The human race has already had their help, if they destroy themselves, it's their failure, the ET's aren't going to save them.  Floyd's final statement really kills me with his reference to the ET's as ""the landlord"".  This is extremely inappropriate in that the ET's have no claim on us. While they are obviously intellectually superior, they are not our bosses and nothing from Clarke or Kubrick ever even hinted that this was so.",1038960000,127,5684,4.8084449021627185
387298,4,6301963660,"I didn't approach this film expecting it to be a rehash of Kubrick's masterpiece.  I didn't expect the cryptic dialogue.  I didn't expect the astounding visual effects.  I didn't expect the minimalistic score.  Thus, when I did see this film I enjoyed it.  When I got it on DVD I wondered if the film would suffer from my maturing like some others that I used to love as a kid.  For the most part 2010 holds up.  It looks and sounds good, the dialogue is serviceable, the effects are truly amazing, and the plot -though dated by the whole 'cold war' atmosphere- is pretty good.  The extras are also quite interesting.  So don't be an idiot and expect this to be like 2001.  Hyams had an impossible task but he pulled it off.  He managed to make a film that retained characteristics of the original, yet was also up to date while avoiding the George Lucas 'commercialization' curse that has plagued the recent STAR WARS films.

387299,3,6301963660,"I know everyone has said this, but I still feel the need to include it anyway. THIS IS NO 2001. Duh! It doesn't even come close to Stanley Kubrick's enigmatic epic of space exploration and the possibility of other worldly intelligence. This one, set nine years after the events in 2001(Duh!) features a group of American and Russian astronauts who travel to Jupiter to investigate what happened on the spaceship Discovery. From this point they go against everything Kubrick wanted to do, in other words, they explained EVERYTHING. And I mean everything; the purpose of the Monoliths(aka the giant Hershey Bar looking things), why HAL went wacko, and even the fate of Dave Bowman. While Kubrick's film was a feast of visuals and of the mystery of Space, this film, directed by Peter Hyams(who went on to make such duds as ""End Of Days"" and ""The Musketeer"") is basically just another mid-80's commentary on the potential destructive force of the Cold War(which today dates the film immediately). That's not to say that this was a bad film. Some of the explanations of the events in the first film were kind of interesting. However, it was what Kubrick didn't say, what he didn't spell out, that made us wonder, that made us remember, and what made his film the sweeping masterpiece that it is today. And that, unfortunately, is something that 2010 will never be, a masterpiece. Even the few scenes featuring astronaut Dave Bowman only serve as a painful reminder of a much better film.

387300,4,6301963660,"First thing's first:  This isn't 2001.  It's not the sweeping, technicaly accurate, 4-million-year epic that 2001 was.  In this movie, you can have noise in a vacuum and most Russians speak English.
Having said that, this is a good movie that gets an unfair rep beacuse it's a sequal to one of the greatest movies of all time.  Peter Hyams does an amazing job of recreating the spacescapes and starships of 2001 and fills it with plenty of character.  Roy Schider's Heywood Floyd is not the vapid bureaucrat from 2001, but rather a person haunted by events nine years in his past.  To observers on Earth, the fate of David Bowman is a mystery (that last frame of 2001 gets something of an explanation here).
The focus of this film is the attempt to figure out what happened to Discovery, to Dave, why HAL did what he did, and what is that giant Hershey bar doing around Io?  Since many people who saw the first movie may have the same questions, it's quite appropriate.
The story is compelling and steeped in Cold War commentary.  This was written and filmed in the 80s, but it doesn't feel dated in the least.
The performances are great.  Check out Helen Mirren as the Russian Captain or John Lithgow as the American engineer.  The special effects are WAY ahead of their time.
In short, it's a great science fiction movie.  Check it out.
[This is a review of the movie, not this particular DVD. I haven't seen the DVD and can't comment on it, although I hope that Time Warner did a better job of it then some of their other science fiction titles; eg ""Outland"", also directed by Hyams]",1034640000,3,1586,4.510489510489511
387301,4,6301963660,"First, to correct the most recent two reviewers who seem to think either that one has to read the book ""2001"" to understand the film ""2001"" or even that ""Kubric [sic] could not accurately capture the story of 2001 completely""...it's entirely unnecessary to read the book to understand the film. It was written concurrently with the screenplay, and published after the film was released. Arthur C. Clarke, in his book, may have explained some things that were a challenge in the film, but Kubrick was very deliberate in how he filmed ""2001."" The enigmatic ending is there by design. Indeed, both he and Clarke, who co-wrote the screenplay, felt that if they had tied up all the loose ends, the film would have lost most of its emotional impact. It wasn't meant to have a nice, tidy, readily-explained ending. And the reviewer who said that Kubrick could not accurately capture the story of 2001...what?! He *wrote and filmed* the story! The vision was *his!* Who else to *try* and capture it?
That said, on to ""2010."" I won't add to what has already been said here about the plot lines, the direction and the acting, just to say that it's about as good a sequel as you're going to get *without* Kubrick making the film. Kubrick had no intention of making a sequel to his original masterpiece; ""2001"" stood on its own and needed no sequel or explanation. (If anything, his early work on ""AI"" shows how deep his interest in artificial intelligence went, partly from making ""2001"" and doing the research necessary to bring HAL ""to life.""). It was Clarke who took up the task of writing ""2010"" and the others, all of which do a reasonable job of continuing his first novel. The film sticks fairly close to the book, and is a good, mainstream SF movie. In addition, I don't think it's completely necessary to have seen ""2001"" to enjoy ""2010."" There's enough background given to understand what is happening.
As a lover of ""2001,"" the highlight for me was astronaut Dave Bowman's appearance and HAL getting revived. All in all, while it's no ""2001"", ""2010"" is a film worthy of its predecessor.",1033084800,3,2086,4.702185792349726
387302,1,6301963660,"Wow, this movie was a perilous attempt from the beginning.  This definetely was not a wise career choice Peter Hyams.  This movie is as blashemous to the book as Jerry Bruchheimer's ""Pearl Harbor"" was to the actual event.  Even Kubric could not accurately capture the story of 2001 completely, but he at least captured the eerie, helpless feeling that the reader sensed in Bowman's struggle with the paradox of nihilistic and life-preserving powers of the universe.  This movie hardly captures any of those feelings.  I only watched the first hour of the movie, then turned it off, I felt that it would completely ruin my interpretation of the book.  This is a watered-down, sensationalized version of 2010; do not buy/watch this movie unless you have never read/ never plan on reading the book.",1032825600,6,795,4.93984962406015
387303,4,6301963660,"""2010: The Year We Make Contact"" is a movie that is stuck with the unenviable, and even loathsome, task of being a sequel to what many believe to be one of the best movies of the 20th century, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".  ""2001"" was much beloved for its poetic and artistic interpretation of the dawn of man through its evolution to modern day with the ever-present monolith having influence over every stage of development.  While I understand why ""2001"" developed such a strong and loyal following, I do not share their opinion of the movie.  I feel it is slow and plodding, not to mention very dated.  It is not worthy of the high praise it receives.  It's a good movie, not a great one.

""2010"" was produced 16 years after its predecessor and such a layoff will always create ridiculously unfair expectations (""Godfather III"" and ""Star Wars: Episode I"" are other classic examples of that).  Many of the ""2001"" faithful, who thought they were going to get a similar movie, were sorely disappointed.  This accounts for a number of negative reviews and the backlash ""2010"" has endured.  What people fail to realize is that each movie told vastly different stories tied together by the same core events.  It had to be done that way.  To try and recreate ""2001"" would be an insult to the original.  ""2010"" uses straightforward storytelling techniques to pick up the tale of the wayward HAL 9000 computer and failed mission to Jupiter.  By itself, it is excellent cinema.

""2010"" picks up 9 years after the Discovery mission to Jupiter failed and Earth received the last transmission from pilot Dave Bowman, ""My God, it's full of stars!"" as he encountered the monolith (Quick note: this line was never said in the movie ""2001"", but it was Bowman's last statement in the book ""2001"").  Dr. Heywood Floyd, played by Roy Scheider, is the disgraced former head of the National Council on Aeronautics (NCA).  Floyd was blamed for the failure of the Discovery mission and the deaths of all its crew members.  The character of Floyd was played as a unmemorable, almost faceless bureaucrat by William Sylvester in the original film.  In ""2010"", Roy Scheider's portrayal gives him a very human image of a man tormented by the failure 9 years earlier and who wants to seek redemption.  Hence, the storyline for ""2010"".  The United States is building Discovery 2 to go out to Jupiter and find out what happened to its predecessor.  However, the Russians, who are also very interested in the events near Jupiter have a ship of their own, the Leonov, that will be ready to travel a full year earlier, but lack the knowledge to unlock HAL's and Discovery's secrets.  So, in spite of growing Cold War tensions that have both superpowers near the brink of nuclear armageddon, an agreement is struck that will allow three Americans to travel with the Russians to Jupiter:  Dr. Chandra (who built and designed HAL 9000), Walter Curnow (who is designed Discovery 2), and Dr. Floyd.  The Cold War backdrop, while now dated, provides a chilling atmosphere through which the Americans and Russians must learn to trust each other in order to make their mission a success.  After several months of travel to Jupiter, the crew begins its investigation.  The mystery of monolith and signs of life on the moon, Europa, prove just as perplexing as HAL's actions.  Alas, while the crew expect their mission to take at least 3 weeks, they (specifically Dr. Floyd) is informed by the ghost (or whatever his current form is) of David Bowman that they must leave in 2 days.  Bowman can't say why, just that ""something will happen.  something wonderful"".  In order to make the escape launch before Earth is back in range, the Discovery and Leonov must be used in concert with each other, even though the rising tensions between the U.S. and USSR have led to each crew being exiled to its respective ship.  The questions now exist:  What is David Bowman?  What is this ""something wonderful"" he is warning about? Can these people escape in time? and, most of all, will HAL cooperate in helping the escape?  The events leading up to the answers, and the answers themselves, are what make ""2010"" such an enjoyable watch.",1028851200,3,4177,4.7635605006954105

the special effects are complete knockouts for 1984 the planetscapes are lush and the ships look both cool and realistic
the leonov is one cool, strong, sturdy little ship

With all this on Earth going on and their mission to find the Discovery (the Hal 9000 lost ship) one other element is added to the story. We are not alone.

Put against 2001 and it fails poorly. Put against a film released around the same time ,like say ALIENS,and it fairs better. The reasons are this:against 2001 its not thought provoking enough and against ALIENS its beats it in terms of plot excution and source material. Thats not to say ALIENS is a bad movie,far from it. However ALIENS is an action,sci-fi sequel to the (in this reporters opinion) best sci-fi horror ever where as 2010 is the sequel to the GREATEST SCI-FI MOVIE EVER!
Director Peter Hyams acquits himself excellently but you can help but feel that he could have made a better film if he hadn't been sadled with the whole cold-war us against the pig-headed Russians(or vice-versa if you voted for the other side) story-line that all 80's action/thriller/sci-fi movies suffered from.
Roy Scheider is a good replacement to 2001's William Sylvester's character of Heywood Floyd. Elsewhere Helen Mirren applies herself well to the role of the Soviet captain of the Alexi Leonov Tanya Kirbuk(but she had an unusual name in the novel of the same name).John Lithgow is excellent as DISCOVERY systems specialist Walter Curnow. As always Keir Dullea looks ageless as Cmdr. David Bowman and of course Douglas Rain returns as the mentally unbalanced computer but whos always finding ways to make you feel at ease in its company HAL 9000.

A number of things were offensive to me in this film.  First, the United States was incapable of building a ship that could return to Jupiter first to learn about what happened to the Discovery; instead, the U.S. had to rely on the Soviet Union to get there.  U.S.-Soviet joint ventures is space were a popular film themes in the 1980s and early 1990s before the country collapsed, and this is just one more.
Most offensive, was the absurd ""let's kiss and make up and we will all live in peace"" ending.  I wanted to throwup. I was glad I had not made the mistake of buying this DVD and rented it instead.

387326,3,6301963660,"I realize that I am in the minority here, but I have never much cared for the movie 2001. Granted there are some breathtaking picturesque scenes and the score is one cinema's great masterpieces, not to mention the grand special effects (tame by today's standards, but that was in 1968). However, the movie dragged on forever and the plot was paper thin. There was a great deal in the movie that made no sense whatsoever. 2001 was like trying to eat plastic food; it looks really nice, but it serves no function except decoration.

Happily 2010 is not like that. The movie is very much plot driven (as movies should be) and is far more enjoyable to watch than it's predecessor. Roy Scheider is always a joy to watch and it's interesting to see John Lithgow in a ""regular Joe"" role instead of the quirky parts he usually plays. The movie not only has a decent plot of it's own, but it answers many of the questions that 2001 left unanswered: What happened to Dave Bowman; why did HAL go berserk; what are those monoliths near Jupiter doing.

The film never reaches the artistic achievements of 2001. However, movies should be more than just about art and 2010 succeeds where 2001 failed.",1018137600,,1185,4.584905660377358
387327,3,6301963660,"If it weren't for 2001: A Space Odyssey, this film might have received a higher recommendation from me.
DaVinci never painted another Mono Lisa for the collector plate market.  Michaelangelo never followed up the Sistine Chapel by doing the ceiling of his local [retail store].
In other words, this was a movie that didn't need to be made, a sequel that exists on a completely different plane from the original.  It seeks largely to explains things best left to the individual interpretations of the audience.
If, by some miracle, you are able to put the original film out of your head, you'll find a fairly effective, intelligent science-fiction film, devoid of their pyrotechnics that a lot of filmmakers feel obligated to stick in there in order to appeal to 13-to-18-year-old males.  About the only flaw from a strict filmmaking perspective is John Lithgow's performance.  He chews so much scenery here...
Another negative is the unnecessary Cold War subplot that was not in the original novel.  Less that five years after the movie was released, this element was already passe.
Taking the film as a companion to the original, 2010 suffers by comparison in many ways.  As I said before, the biggest knock on this film is that it seeks to make explicit everything that Kubrick trusted his audience to figure out for themselves.  I had my own ideas about what the monolith was and why HAL went bonkers.  I don't need Peter Hyams to connect the dots for me.
Visually, the look of the film is all wrong.  It's supposed to be 9 to 11 years after the events of the first film, but technology seems to have taken a giant leap backward.  The look and feel of the hardware is probably more ""realistic"" but if you extrapolate a decade forward from the first movie, you shouldn't get spacesuits that look contemporary for 1984.
Roy Scheider was also a poor choice to play Heywood Floyd.  He didn't give a bad performance, but he seems to playing a completely different character.  Floyd in the first film was an unctious, slightly sinister company man, not a colorful and eccentric academic.  The movie also lets Floyd's character off the hook for what happened in 2001 when the first film makes it clear that he was as involved as anybody (it's about the only thing Kubrick did make clear).

This is one of those movies.  2001, while a spectacular film in the most literal sense of the word, lacked pacing and character.  HAL always felt to be the most ""real"" individual in the film.  Shots would drag on into eternity.  2010 follows up on the concepts started in 2001 but takes the theme in a new direction.  A politically divided world that is crumbling upon itself must unite in order to understand one of the greatest mysteries mankind has ever encountered.  A father must leave his wife and son for years so that he may accomplish his mission.  Dave Bowman humanity pushes him to return, not only to give one final warning, but to say his last goodbyes.  A computer scientist searches out his ""prodigal son"".  While perhaps not visually stunning by today's standards, this continues Arthur C. Clarke's tradition of well thought out, realistic science fiction.  2010 maay not share quite as much of the sense of wonder of 2001, and in some ways is not as thought-provoking, but it proves, not only just as intelligent as its predecessor, but quite a bit more entertaining.",1016409600,3,1174,4.705882352941177

Clarke's story, Peter Hyams's adaptation of Clarke's sequel to 2001:A Space Odyssey is just as magnificent and spectacular. Not only does it contain the cerebral elements of 2001, it also contains a very straightforward approach to the storyline. It also explains why HAL had malfunctioned, and committed the acts that he did. 2010 is definately a worthy and excellent sequel to the greatest science fiction film ever made. With Keir Dullea and Douglas Rain returning to their familiar roles, and joined by veteran actors Roy Scheider, John Lithgow, Robert Balaban, British actress Helen Mirren, and a few Russian actors, this film is definately a classic. Most of all, it is certainly better than some of the other science fiction that has been coming out as of late.
If you are a fan of Kubrick, Clarke, Hyams, and the others who were involved in both MGM productions, check out not only 2001, but also check out 2010. You won't be disappointed.

The collaboration actually was more dependent upon Clarke than Kubrick. The sequel was also based on the written work of Clarke, and the film, to be a worthy sequel, did not necessarily require Kubrick's touch (as special as that touch is). The first film (and the first book) were meant to stand alone -- there was no plan for a sequel. Therefore, the original works could not readily be expected to furnish the expository material that a sequel could ably do. Thus the sequel seems less vague and more ""conventional"" than the original. But this does not imply inferior! Upon the conclusion of ""2010"" I was in a state of rapture -- the film truly was a DIRECT descendant of the original! Clarke wrote the sequel within the same philosphical context with which he had written the first work.
 The production of ""2010"" is on a fairly grand scale and does not in the least disappoint as a sequel to its Great Predecessor. The two films could be conjoined and shown as one (long) film -- as far as I am concerned.

The endless exposition in Scheider's monotone carries you deep into space. He really is very boring in this slow, slow movie. And check out Helen Mirren's Russian Commander!

People who have seen both films (like me) notice two completely different approaches to Arthur C. Clarke's tale of discovery. Stanley Kubrick's 2001 offers us an introspective into the human soul, and it is characterized by letting the visuals and music tell the story in the place of dialogue. Hyams takes a different approach, giving the audience a more straightforward approach to the film, with plenty of characters and dialogue.
Personally, I preferred 2010 to 2001. Although it couldn't capture the awe and wonder of space that 2001 did, the story was equally engrossing. We finaly learn exactly what happened to Dave Bowman at the end of the first film, and what drove HAL mad. The film has an inspiring, although not necessarily realistic, moral to it.
The acting is about average. I had a hard time believing John Lithgow as a reluctant astronaut after seeing him in 3rd Rock. If this movie has a fault, it's that it's based on a novel written in 1982, and the geopolitical climate has drastically changed. But its message of cooperation is as timeless as the ages.
The DVD special features, such as the ""making of"" featurette, are pretty good. I learned that the 2010 set designers had to build all of the miniatures from scratch, because Kubrick had the orignal Discovery from 2001 destroyed!

It's predecessor which I hold very high as one of the true sci-fi classics and also a masterpiece in both technical effects and pictures. 2010 starts out pretty good with Roy Scheider portraying one of the astronauts that went to the moon in the first movie. He and two other american scientists (one of which designed the Hal 9000 computer that returns in this movie). They take off together with a russian crew on a soviet spaceship to try and find out what happened to the Discovery and it's crew close to the moon of IO near Jupiter. And it's when they get on the Discovery ship that the movie really starts. Keir Dullea from 2001 also returns in his role and it's seeing him and Hal 9000 that makes the movie better to nothing for me. The ending is nothing more then ok. 2001 shouldn't be compared to 2010, I understand that but it is impossible not to. Especially when they in the beginning of the movie try to tell everyone what happened in the first one.
The first movie is despite the title 2001, timeless but 2010 is because of the political climate, the movie was made in 1984 when the cold war was still going on. And then it's the directors, well, I don't really like any of them but for me Stanley Kubricks 2001 was a really good film, despite the director's artistic necessity, and Peter Hyams with his action movies or sci-fi as in the case of Outland (which was also set on a moon close to Jupiter), doesn't really make 2010 to any more then a video rental or a late night watch on the tube.

Being more literal than the original, ""2010"" lacks the mystical qualities that made the original so appealing to audiences in 1968 (interestingly, we hadn't landed on the moon yet...bear that in mind when viewing the lunar scenes and the superb special effects), but has a compelling story to tell on its own. Simply put--Russia and the US cooperate on a mission to Jupiter to determine what happened to Dave Bowman and why HAL malfunctioned. Once they arrive, they encounter monoliths, the possibility of life on Jupiter's moon Europa, and an awakened HAL. A cryptic message from Bowman--""Something wonderful is going to happen""--sets up the (maybe) too literal finale (but that's what happened in the book...so complain to Clarke), but the payoff is satisfactory. Today's fans might find the Cold War political tensions between the US and Russia dated, but it really doesn't detract from the film. The effects (Richard Edlund, I believe) are very good, and the Jovian system looks remarkably true to life (but the producers of this film had the Voyager photos to refer to; Kubrick didn't, and still managed a realistic representation). The performances are fairly good, with Scheider and Mirren giving their best. And, it was nice to see Dullea again, and Douglas Rain (as the voice of HAL) is as unnervingly good as before.

387410,5,6301963660,"Let's face it, there can never be another film like Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY ever again.
That said, however, ""2010"" is still an excellent film in its own right, and an extremely well-made sequel to that undisputed classic.
Peter Hyams, who made other sci-fi films prior to this (CAPRICORN ONE, OUTLAND) was given the obviously onerous task of following up an overwhelming movie with this one.  It is certainly much more conventional than Kubrick's was, but still I think he did a superlative job.
The film picks up some nine years later, with a joint US/Russian mission to Jupiter to find out why the U.S. spaceship ""Discovery"" met with tragedy.  The eerie black monolith which was at the center of Kubrick's film reappears here with equal power.

387412,4,6301963660,"Sequels are sometimes the most infuriating devices in the world of cinema.  A sequel can either transcend a series or completely invalidate it.  ""Terminator 2"" cemented Jim Cameron's apocalyptic films as iconic emblems of the science fiction genre.  On the other hand, it is commonly held that the latter two ""Alien"" sequels were the ruination of Cameron and Ridley Scott's compelling visions.  ""Psycho"" did not need a sequel, but got one anyway.  So did ""Escape from New York"".
Imagine then, the sheer audacity of creating a sequel to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", not only a great science-fiction film but also considered one of the greatest achievements in the whole of cinema.  Compounding this fact is that the visionary director of the first one, Stanley Kubrick, would not be helming.  Instead, it would be Peter Hyams, a director whose previous forays into the genre were the decent, though not extraordinary, ""Capricorn One"" and ""Outland"".
Certainly, Hyams was aware of the act he was following and perhaps followed a line from Clint Eastwood's ""Magnum Force"": A man's got to know his limitations.  Hyams approached the making of ""2010"" in the best way - by working closely with Arthur C. Clarke in adapting the screenplay from Clarke's novel of the same name.  The major difference between ""2001"" and ""2010"" was that the first is a story of revelation, whereas the second is a story of explanation.  In this difference, Hyams would find the avenue to deliver his own powerful vision.
""2010"", as both a novel and screenplay, is a simple morality tale with science-fiction elements serving as the judge and messenger.  In its own way, it is a more ambitious take on the theme and story of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"".  The key to ""2010"" was not in allegorical images, but in clear conveying of the plot while at the same time keeping the fantastic elements just beyond the full grasp of understanding.  Hyams accomplishes this with his solid screenplay, first-rate special effects worthy of the groundbreaking original, a cast of versatile actors (led by Roy Scheider and Helen Mirren), and the ambitious use of Keir Dullea and Douglas Rain in their original roles.  In the end, ""2010"" is a perfect compliment to Kubrick's original vision, a follow-up that does not try mimicking the first film, but rather stakes out its own idiom.  By understanding the nature of  ""2010"" and by respecting the work done in ""2001"", Peter Hyams crafts a worthy sequel and a wonderful film in its own right.

387413,5,6301963660,"One of the biggest reasons why I think the so-called purists had such an allergic reaction to 2010 was that it was such a departure from Kubrick's 1969 masterpiece. In 2001, the audience is largely a witness to events and then must reach their own conclusions. In 2010, the audience is told what is happening through a host of wonderful characters that simply were not present on 2001. Heywood Floyd (Roy Scheider) is a fantastic protagonist. He obviously a gifted scientist, but unlike his counterpart and HAL-9000 creator Richard Chandra (Bob Balaban), seems far more connected to the human race than his particular field of expertise. In the end they are two completely different films. 2001 is a landmark film, no doubt about it, nothing like it had ever been seen before, but it was made in the 60's and perhaps younger people feel disconnected from it for that reason.
2010 begins 8 years after the Discovery disaster. The massive ship had been dispatched to Io in orbit around Jupiter to investigate a second monolith, identical but larger than one found on the moon. A Russian scientist Moisevitch (Dana Elcar) informs Floyd that the Soviets will reach the Discovery almost a full year before the Americans will and that Floyd should check Discovery's orbit. When he does so Floyd learns that the ship's orbit has begun to decay and will fall towards Io unless it is recovered. Moisevitch convinces Floyd that having American scientists onboard would make the trip go much smoother. Now that the scientists agree it is the politicians who now must be convinced. Unfortunately, the Americans and the Soviets are headed for a showdown off the coast of Honduras which may lead to war.
Four months later aboard the Soviet ship the Alexei Leonov, the joint American-Soviet crew arrives at Jupiter and in a spectacular sequence must use a process known as aero-braking in order to slow down enough to put the ship in position to rendezvous with Discovery. After this we are introduced to Walter Curnow (John Lithgow), the engineer and brains behind the Discovery II, the ship the Americans were building to go to Jupiter. Curnow and Russian Maxim Brailovsky (Elya Baskin) must transit over from the Leonov to the Discovery with the violent moon of Io spinning dangerously beneath them. Once on board the spinning American ship, they get its systems operational and pull it out of the decaying orbit. It is then they release Chandra to see if he can recover the damaged HAL-9000 (Douglas Rain). (Interesting tidbit: Add one letter to HAL and you get IBM).
Once recovered both ships move towards the second monolith which is two kilometers long. Things sour back home on Earth and both crews are ordered by their governments to return to their respective ships It is here that Floyd, aboard Discovery`s bridge, receives his first message from David Bowman (Kier Dullea), that he must leave the area within two days. Believing it a hoax, Floyd asks HAL who is sending the messages, to which the computer replies ""...I was David Bowman."" then, ""Look behind you..."" And we see David Bowman for the first time-still young and still wearing the orange spacesuit. Floyd follows him into the pod bay where Bowman is revealed to be an old man. Floyd is told that ""...something wonderful is going to happen."" and then watches dumbfounded as Bowman transforms once again into the starchild.
Back on the Leonov, Floyd argues with Captain Tanya Kirbuk (Helen Mirren) that perhaps they really ought to head back home. Kirbuk is skeptical and can't find any reason to go along with Floyd's crazy plan. Only after they concoct a plan to use the Discovery as a massive booster rocket that the large monolith vanishes is Kirbuk convinced. Only problem now is convincing HAL to go along with the plan- the AI was created to be curious, but also to look after the Discovery and if the ship is left behind it may be destroyed. It then becomes a race against time as a large black spot appears on Jupiter that seems to be consuming the planet. The massive gas giant begins to shrink.
Ultimately 2010 boils down into a wonderful science fiction movie- yes, it's `science fiction' and not `sci-fi'. The only reason I think that abbreviation is used is because most people have short attention spans. It is not 2001, as the movies are separated by a generation of directors who had different values and a different audience. Strangely enough, Arthur C. Clarke's book makes far more sense than Kubrick's film does and even the short story that the book and then the movie were drawn from is more conclusive. 2010 is a sequel and not the same film as 2001, if it were, Kubrick would have directed it and it would have been called 2001: Part II. Both films are excellent, but they aren't the same.",992131200,,4770,4.797083839611179

What's better though - is that you don't need that background. This film works even if you've never seen the classic ""2001"". It does a great job of giving you some background as part of the plot.
This is a very good, stand alone, film. It works on a lot of levels and is a great sci-fi story.
Yes, the monolith is back, and yes, it's doing some strange things. Roy Scheider is sent to check out some of the odd happenings. He's hitching a ride on a Russian ( It helps to remember that when this film came out, we were still pretty deep in the ""Russian's Are Bad"" mentality. ) Spacecraft, complete with a strong female captain and a ( english speaking ) crew. Scheider has his team along for the ride.
The interaction between the American Crew and the Russian Crew is wonderful. Roy Scheider, who can sometimes be a little overpowering in his acting style, is wonderful here. His main counterpart is the Russian Captain, played by the always watchable Helen Mirran ( of ""Prime Suspect"" fame ).
Also along for the ride is John Lithgow and Bob Balaban ( as the tender Dr. Chandra ).
The cast if first rate and the writing and storytelling are right on. I don't want to give away any plot points but the mystery of the monolith is still there.
This film probably isn't as ""deep and meaningful"" as the original but it does hold it's own as a sci-fi movie.

The goals are to investigate the Monolith near Jupiter, Board the Discovery, and Find out what happened to David Bowman and find out why Hal went mad and possibly reconnect him David Bowman (Keir Dullea) appears throughout the film promising us that something wonderful is going to happen. Hal also returns. Will he once again mutiny? There are also several other connections with 2001 throughout the film. Try to find them!
I for one have mixed feelings on 2010. It does have cool special effects and is a well made film. But it answers several questions from 2001 and thus, takes away the mystery.

387461,5,6301963660,"My original thoughts: ""This is a totally inept and unnecessary sequel to ""2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY."" Director Peter Hyams continues to demonstrate his predilection for mediocrity. This film is a total inversion of the original. Stanley Kubrick's vision of the future that he established in the original is totally scraped and revamped in this second film for no good reason other than dollar signs. I suppose the producers of this film thought that approach would have been too cerebral for the 80's audiences. Kubrick created a sterile environment for his astronauts of the future. Here we see a continuing trend in films to create a lived in and grimy environment for space travelers. Kubrick's astronauts were the consummate professionals. They were the clean-shaven, cool headed, clear thinking professionals. They were never verbose going off into unnecessary dissertations on baseball and hotdogs and mustard like occurs in this film. Kubrick's astronauts restricted their dialogue to the requirements necessary to complete the mission successfully. Verbosity has always been a trademark in Hyams' films and a detriment to his abilities as a director and screenwriter in my humble opinion. Verbosity runs rampant in this film and it becomes nauseating to the point where I often turn this movie off. John Lithgow's Walter Curnow is the guiltiest of this. Roy Scheider is totally miscast as Dr. Heywood Floyd. Of coarse the character of Floyd is scripted entirely wrong in this film, so you really can not blame Scheider. William Sylvester's performance as Floyd in the original was one of the most realistic performances ever given by an actor up till then. I never once saw a review even mentioning his performance. That was a shame. Bob Balaban as Dr. Chandra seemed totally unnecessary and not believable. That character was a mistake. It's hard to believe that Arthur C. Clarke had some collaborative input on this film. I will admit that it was good to see Keir Dullea reappear as Dave Bowman for purely sentimental reasons. Helen Mirren as the Soviet Tanya Kirbuk gave a somewhat acceptable performance. It was dramatic but contained enough stoicism to be believable. My biggest complaint however with this film and it my seem trivial, was the presence of sound in outer space. The images in the original 2001of massive spacecraft floating in space traveling at incredible speeds all to either dead silence or majestic musical accompaniment was deafening. Who can ever forget the image of Gary Lockwood as astronaut Frank Poole grasping for air hurtling into deep space after Hal 9000 has cut his airline? Again this scene was played to dead silence and still lingers in my memory. That is a tribute to the concept of pure cinema. And remember Peter there is no sound in the vacuum of space.""

But times change and time affects many things. 2010: THE YEAR WE MAKE CONTACT deserves another look. Yes, 2010: THE YEAR WE MAKE CONTACT deserves another look. It has a totally different look and feel and tone from Stanley Kubrick's 1968 classic 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. It has been a while since 2010: THE YEAR WE MAKE CONTACT was released. I always felt that the emphasis was more on characters and political ideology than plot in this squeal. It is interesting that the politics of the Soviets and Western powers have totally changed. The film is nostalgic, I suppose, in that regard. And speaking of nostalgia, it was interesting to see the Discovery ship in a tumbling orbit around Jupiter. I really wanted to revisit this film. I thought there was so much wrong with it at the time of its release. I guess I am a bit soft and just wanted to take another look.",972172800,27,3666,4.932038834951456
387462,4,6301963660,"Question: How can you give a movie a decent review by just comparing it to another movie?
Answer: You can't.
If one decides to have an opinion on a movie, one must try to keep that within the context of the movie.  If you're telling me that a movie isn't good just because you have already seen something better than we should shut down all of Hollywood!
Sure, there's a lot of schlock out there.  Always was, but that didn't stop people from creating some of the masterpieces that some seem to think dictate the merits of all later films.
I won't compare 2010 to 2001.  It's a sequel!  Different directors, different writers (Clarke was, of course, both) and a different time (the knowledge acquired since 1968 changed the story).
2010 holds up very well, my only vice is that it regressed into  using sound effects in outer space.  I'm sick of these Hollywood types who feel they need to 'hype' the scenes of a sci-fi movie.  ISNOCHYS (i.e. in space no one can hear you scream)

2001 was one of the  greatest examples of what cinema (movies as art) could do. It was abstract,  compelling, engrossing and confrontational. It changed the way you thought  for a little while, and changed what many people thought movies could do,  forever.
2010 isn't cinema at all, it's a *play*. Everything compelling  about this, except perhaps the special effects (which, while awesome, are  tellingly static) happens between two people, through dialog. Two people  sit on a park bench and decide the fate of the Discovery. Two people argue  on the bridge of a soviet spaceship about the Monolith. Two people stand in  the middle of the high desert of California and trade cold-war secrets  about an alien encounter. And it's all *awesome*!

That's what is so special about the movie - it's very ""matter of fact"" about going to Jupiter - everything feels realistic and looks  realistic (from what we've seen of Jupiter and its moons from the Voyager  and Pioneer flybys).
An additional positive point - the movie aged well.  The cold war conflict between the US and Russia sounds dated to us now that  the cold war is over, but the premise is realistic enough to those of us  that remember the ""Godless commies"".  But everything about the  ships and mission seem very realistic, and it's fascinating to watch the  probe they send to Europa, entering Discovery the first time, the  aerobraking, and even the tensions of the crew reflecting the tensions of  their respective countries on Earth, and the climax is really quite  exciting.
It is, of course, a different movie than 2001.  It's more  traditional in that more things happen, there's a real payoff (as opposed  to the weird aging thing beyond the Monolith in 2001), and with more  characters, it's got more dialogue/interactions.  I personally like it  better than 2001.
As for the DVD edition, there's not much else here,  except a short (10 minutes) featurette on meaking the film, which looks  VERY dated... =)  Even at the short length, though, it's much better than a  lot of ""making of"" segments that I've seen.",961372800,,1414,4.775933609958506

There is an aerobraking scene and the crew came  up with a way to safely leave the Jupiter system two weeks ahead of  schedule, the implementation of which was fun to watch.  The reason given  for HAL's murders was a bit of a letdown.  I think that perhaps that  mystery should have been left unanswered.
I would suggest that anyone  with this movie pause the film the moment the nurse puts down the TIME  magazine.  That looks like Clarke as the President of the United States!

387509,4,6301963660,"Although overshadowed artistically by its less-literal predecessor, '2010' works well on its own terms - it's much more mainstream and literal, and although it explains away most of the plot of the original it feels much  slighter, less substantial - ordinary, in short.
It's basically an  old-school science-fiction film - not a horror film, or an action film, or  a soap opera, but a science fiction film, with an epic grandeur to it, and  some excellent special effects. The rising cost of film production, and an  increasingly blockbuster-orientated market mean that proper sci-fi films  now come out once in a blue moon - the 90's gave us 'Contact' and 'The  Bicentennial Man' (which is stretching the argument a bit), and you might  count 'Pi' as science-fiction, but that's about it.
On the downside, it  all seems very slight, and it doesn't really stick with you after it is  over - a bit like the book, really, which this follows closely (with the  addition of a cold war sub-plot).
It's also a fascinating comparison of  two different eras of space travel - it's nice to see the sleek, gorgeous  'Discovery' again, and it's a very 1960's view of the future, antiseptic  and clean, whereas the functional, brutal 'Leonov' is closer to the earthy  reality of life in space. As with '2001', the technology of '2010' is  grounded so far in reality that it hasn't really dated, although the  genuine computer graphics look extremely clumsy compared to the animated  mock-CGI of the first film. The non-technology doesn't look too bad, either  - the film sticks to functional exteriors and plain interiors, although Roy  Schieder's apartment is very 'Miami Vice'.
The cast is good, too,  although this isn't really an acting film - Roy Schieder is Roy Schieder,  John Lithgow reminds us that he was once an Oscar-nominated motion picture  actor, Helen Mirren talks in Russian, and Keir Dullea makes a welcome  re-appearance, looking exactly the same as he did 16 years before. Really,  it's frightening.
The minimal soundtrack isn't as effective as the  extensive classical music used in the original, although there is a  memorable 'twannnnng' noise that will make you shout 'Star Trek: The Motion  Picture'.
It's interesting to compare this with the recent, vaguely  similar, but utterly inferior 'Mission to Mars'. Both films are  NASA-approved, technically impressive, and feature proper actors and a name  director (Peter Hyams did the post-modern 'Capricorn One', Brian De Palma  is sort of post-modern-ish, depending on whether you like him or not), but  whereas '2010' succeeds in being an entertaining drama, 'Mission to Mars'  fails utterly on so many levels.",956880000,2,2674,5.071264367816092

387512,5,6301963660,"2010: the Year We Make Contact will forever be hidden in the shadow of its famous predecessor, 2001.  The reason for this is probably the fact that 2010 seems a bit too mainstream though I found the film to be quite thought  provoking and awe inspiring.  It's truly one of the most underrated sci-fi  film of the 80's.
2010 takes place nine years after the disastrous  Discovery mission near Jupiter in 2001 that led to the deaths of the crew  members at the hands of the computer Hal and the disappearance of David  Bowman.  The Americans and the Russians both send a joint team on a ship  called the Leonov to the site to find out what happened to the Discovery  and learn the secrets of the mysterious dark monolith.  Heading the crew  are Heywood Floyd (Roy Scheider), the man who was blamed for the  Discovery's failure, and Tanya Kirbuck (Helen Mirren).  With the help of  the designers of the Discovery and Hal (John Lithgow and Bob Balaban) they  begin to search for the answers.  At the same time, the US and Russia are  on a standoff that could lead to nuclear war and Bowman constantly appears  at certain places telling people something wonderful is going to  happen.
2010 is vastly underrated; it's quite an enjoyable film filled  with moments of genuine tension and suspense.  This film manages to  maintain excitement and intrigue without a person pulling a gun on somebody  else.  Some of the great moments in this film include the Leonov's attempt  to slingshot around Jupiter, John Lithgow's terrifying (for him though we  feel some of the terror) space walk, the approach to the monolith, and the  fine conclusion which is nothing short of spectacular and awe  inspiring.
The cast includes Roy Scheider, John Lithgow, and Helen Mirren  so you know acting isn't a problem.  All three of the top billed actors  deliver stellar performances.  Scheider is a superb every day man who is  haunted by his past mistakes and hopes to atone for them.  Supporting  performances are all around solid with the most impressive coming from Keir  Dullea who truly mystifies as the the ethereal and almost celestial David  Bowman.
Of course, for a film of this sort you need the usual special  effects.  In this film's case, they are quite spectacular.  The interior of  the Leonov looks a bit dated and a bit 80's, but the exterior is very  realistic.  The scenery is quite beautiful as all the planets look  convincing.  The film's most impressive effects come at the end though I  don't want to say what it's like.
Director Peter Hyams did a fine job of  bringing Arthur C. Clarke's novel to the screen.  His script is intelligent  and the direction is more than competent.
The only actual grudge I had  with this movie were the voice over scenes when Scheider's character would  be writing to his wife.  The voice is a bit too loud and feels intrusive.  Thankfully it's not in the movie for long.
2010, in its own right, is a  science fiction classic.  Some may feel bored by the lack of violence but  for those who enjoy clear headed sci-fi films that are intelligent and  impressively mounted you certainly can't go wrong with 2010.

387571,4,6301963660,"In the final analysis, 2010 is a pretty good science fiction movie. It was in fact a very competent film that paid close attention to details (although we still here that impossible WHOOOOOOSH when a spaceship flies  by) and offered us a story that was actually about something. However, the  film did have its share of flaws. What was most annoying was the complete  lack of subtlety in the movie. The ending was far too literal to be very  effective, with all its preachments about human civilization. It leaves us  with a feeling of mundania (relatively) rather than the sense of profound  awe with which we leave the theatre after the final shot of 2001's floating  fetus.
2010 without a doubt fails to live up to the standards of the  previous space oddysey. But that was by design: Hyams wasn't trying to live  up to that standard.  Unfortunately, the tradeoffs he made with this film  don't always pay off.  What it gains in dynamics, it loses in importance,  profundity, and artistic sensibility. A sequel to something as wondrous as  2001: A Space Oddysey should not leave us with a sense of  ""earthbound"", but should take us on to new vistas of the  imagination. Instead, we hear about political squables and troubles with  loved ones. This would work fine if we were given characters with real  depth, but seems unimportant when we have flat characters laid against a  background cosmic in scale. It also fails to answer the questions left us  in 2001 in a satisfying manner. (Why did HAL go crazy and kill his entire  crew? Oh, that was a little programming glitch we overlooked. We'll make  sure it doesn't happen again.)
All this aside, the movie was quite  finely crafted. I mean, given the source material Peter Hyams still managed  to make an entertaing movie out of what could have been another so so  sci-fi film.  Don't expect the masterpiece that was 2001, but judge it by  its own merits and you'll come away satisfied.",946252800,6,1941,4.699404761904762
387572,5,6301963660,"What everybody should know about 2010: It is not 2001! Sounds stupid, but it explains about everything. 2010 is the continuation of the storyline of 2001, but it tells the story in a completely different way.
2001 was slow  and silent. It was filled with emotions and impressions. 2010 offers the  same but combines it with a far more interesting plot. On one hand it tells  the story nine years after the Discovery Incident, as a team of russian and  american scientists try to find answers and on the other hand it explains  the fate of Bowman and HAL 9000 ... and ultimately of mankind.
The movie  never gets boring and keeps you guessing until the end. The actors are  marvelous. The hangar scene between Floyd (Roy Scheider) and Bowman (Keir  Dullea) alone is better than any other scene in 2001. The russian/american  conflict may be a bit out of date (! ), but it never spoils the movies true  message.
2010 is not better than 2001. It is different. It is the answer  to a question and the beginning of a new one. You have to watch this film.  And i also recommend the other two (book) sequels from Arthur C. Clarke  (2061 and 3001).",945648000,135,1140,4.475728155339806
387573,2,6301963660,"When I saw 2001: a space odyssey I thought it was one of the most awe inspiring sci-fi movie in existence. Because if this I was expecting quite a lot of 2010. I was sorely disappointed. It was extremely slow, had a  quite boring USA vs Russia theme throughout and nothing truly great  happened until the end. This movie does not make you think - unlike the  original. I then read the book of 2010 and found that it was excellent.  What went wrong with the film? Around a third of the plot was cut and the  Russia vs USA theme was added for no apparent reason. The characters were  destroyed and all of the humour and suspense was forgotten. It is sad that  what could have been am excellent movie was let down due to sloppy script  and directing. The ironic thing is that 2001 has aged less than this movie!  I think I will just try to forget that a movie was made of this excellent  book - it lets me read the rest of the series in peace.",925603200,3,940,4.143646408839779

You cannot compare the original, so why bother..
But just the pure sci-fi of it all, good effects, superb acting.. Seeing Dave Bowman again..
C'mon  what else? Still blows away most of New stuff..
So glad they did not call this ""2001 Part 2""
Ending a little flat but I really enjoy it..
The Russian US confrontation really is put in perspective how lost the human race is..",1525564800,,411,4.48

7817416,3,6301963660,Very 1980s film. Soviet/American tension. Story has potential but I feel came up a little short. Not as good as 2001. I did not like the narration monologues by the main character at all. Thought they were distracting and a cheap method to explain or introduce story elements. Did not work well for this film.,1525219200,,309,4.636363636363637

7817419,5,6301963660,"Actually an event similar to this really will happen, though it would not involve Jupiter or any objects in our solar system.  One day, perhaps tomorrow or within a few hundred years or more, the Great Giant Red Star Betelgeuse (less than 450 light years from Earth) is going to go SUPERNOVA!  Because of the proximity of the Supernova to our Star, the brilliance of the event will closely mimic what you saw in this picture.  Betelgeuse will be 156,000 times brighter than Sirius, the brightest star in the heavens!!!  A full moon will completely pale in comparison.  Unfortunately, this event will only light up our day and night sky's for 3 - 4 months before fading and the constellation of Orion (the hunter) will be missing its bright orange shoulder star.",1521763200,,761,4.734848484848484
