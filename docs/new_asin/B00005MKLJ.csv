The story line is good, but the presentation drops the ball, the other thing that annoyed me was it seemed more like the story was about Jim the bartender than Brigit the real victim. The way they also integrated the Reilly's into the story was weak and they didn't stay for very long. I would only ever recommend this to people who want to see certain actors playing a role, other wise don't buy unless it's super cheap, like $1.00",1373068800,,514,4.255102040816326
8272983,5,B00005MKLJ,"I recently purchase a DVD; Title: ""Farewell My Love"" as I was unable to rent or buy it in any of the Video outlets in Australia. It was my first experience of a purchase from Amazon but not my last as I was more than satisfied with the whole process from A to Z. At the young age of 62 I don't know why initially, I was such a skeptic. I recommend Amazon without reservation to anyone wishing to make a purchase via their Web Site...
