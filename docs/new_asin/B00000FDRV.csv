1210905,5,B00000FDRV,"Its a good anime to watch, but get the subtitle, its much better then the dub. its about these girls who does sports  after months of competition the great competition for the Cosmic Beauty title that have begun. Kris challenges akari for the performances.  I really like these episodes and i rate this 5 stars so if you read this hopefully you would be writing this",974592000,,366,4.53030303030303
1210906,3,B00000FDRV,"About Kanzaki Akari, a fifteen-year-old girl who wants to be Cosmos beauty.  Even though the dubbing of this tape is a little off, and tends to have more perverted jokes then the original Japanese version (how could it  not?) it's done very well.  The voices can grate on your nerves, sounding  out of place at time, but this is a cute outer space comedy.  Definitely  not for those into girls fighting against girls.  Also it isn't recomended  for anyone under 13, considering it does have a few parts where the girls  are nude and they comment on one girls sexuality. All an all, it's funny,  but isn't the best I've seen.",951177600,,624,4.54054054054054
7908148,5,B00000FDRV,"A cute anime, one of the first I collected back on VHS. I wanted to update to DVD and got to relive the experience again. Cute, weird, funny, and just inspiring enough.",1414195200,,168,4.28125
7908149,5,B00000FDRV,"The DVD arrived earlier than scheduled, it was in excellent shape for a used DVD better than I anticipated. The price was an excellent selling point also. The shipping cost is pre-set but reasonable. I look forward to purchasing more DVDs in the future.",1372809600,,253,4.7727272727272725
7908150,4,B00000FDRV,"This is a fun athletic theme ova that presents a lot of the characters who can be seen in the tv series ""Battle Athletes Victory"".  This series does have some situations that are inappropriate for children, but otherwise is very entertaining.  This ova only shows one segment of the battle athletes story.

7908151,4,B00000FDRV,"The art work was excellent as well as the sound quality. The story arc held together quite well but did slow in some parts.

 Over all quite enjoyable. I will be playing it again whenever I would like light, feel good entertainment.

 This is what I purchase movies and books for, entertainment.",1144540800,,295,4.615384615384615
7908152,5,B00000FDRV,"I had heard of Battle Athletes Toshoyden before, (Original Japanese name) way back in 1996,but have never seen it.
I have to say it was well worth the wait, although I found it a bit wierd for them to be using a Saturn IV launch vehicle in the 50th century.
My only disapointment was that the discs only contain a meazly 2 episodes per disc. This could have been a much better series if they had crammed all 6 episodes onto one disc. This would have been a little more {money}, but far less of a waste.
If nothing else, I reccomend these discs for the beauty of the anime alone.
I found a lot of Star Trek , The Outer Limits, and a whole lot of Tenchi in here.  All and all, a great little anime!",1057708800,3,696,4.08029197080292
7908153,5,B00000FDRV,"I've already seen all of Battle Athletes Victory. It's very good. In my title when I say ""however"" I am saying that because if you're looking to buy this DVD, I think you should be aware that this specific DVD isn't the first in the series. Actually, im not completely sure, but all the info about this DVD leads me to conclude that this contains episodes from later on in the series. It starts where Akari has ALREADY entered the University Sattellite. The beginning of the entire series however, starts  off at a training school in Antarctica. So... I recommend this series yes, but I also strongly recommend that you watch it from the beginning...",1030579200,6,650,4.6521739130434785
7908154,5,B00000FDRV,"It was cheep & looked cute. I thought at least I would enjoy the animation if nothing else, but it was really a lot better than I was expecting! It looks so much like Tenchi (hair, clothes, setting, etc.) that that's what I thought I'd get. (I love Tenchi, too, of course) But the atmosphere is totaly different. Hmmmmm... can't really think of a series it reminds me of right off. It just has a really realistic, inspirational feel...It's really easy to get into how Akari feels about getting to University Satilite. She's excited & determined, even when she gets a bit of a shock, learning she's not as great as she thought, at the beginning. All the charicters are cool & original. For the most part they are too cute & awesome to hate. (because that happens too much! Poor Amelia... Poor Usagi... Poor Mia... weeeeell, Miaka's pushing it, but I like her, too.) None of them are the wimpy kind, anyway (they get bashed most) but they can't be, not if they got into US. Sorry, I just had to emphisize how well designed the characters are. They make the story great. The only one I don't liek is the B!tchy second year she meets in the first ep. XP but it's good to have bad guys, or how do you have heros. Oh, & another thing is, I didn't get bored. Not at all. I get bored easily, too. Still wavering? Get this anime. I'm telling you, you'll love it...",1024790400,3,1355,4.359683794466403
7908155,4,B00000FDRV,"When I first watched this DVD (...), I instantly connected with it! This is an anime for middle-, highschool girls who like to have a good laugh with friends while watching a pumped-up action-y type anime that's lighthearted. Warning: makes you want to go outside and start exercising! It's all about these girls besting each other to become the greatest athlete. You really identify with all the characters-- my friends and I all chose our favorite people and argued about who was best/right/cute etc. Really fun, very good for a sleepover series and for your bf so you can watch together! WARNING: I wouldn't watch if you are offended by ""gay"" jokes, nudity, a weird lesbian type relationship with these people, and a perverted headmaster. This is definitly not the mindboggling deep type, but it's cute and fun! Buy immediatlely!",1008460800,5,832,4.95
7908156,5,B00000FDRV,"The last in the OVA series Battle Athletes, Go!, provided both the much anticipated conclusion of the Cosmic Beauty Competition and the answers to some of the problems presented in the first two installments.  The story centers around Akari and her chums as they compete for the most coveted of all titles, Cosmic Beauty ooooo...eeee...aaaaah.  By this time it's really down to three contestants, Akari, Kris(her friend) and Lahrri(the defending champ).  There are some twists and turns mainly involving the religion involved with athletics and the (...lets say tense) relationship between Kris, Lahrri and the evil Mylandah.  The ending is fitting for the series and is actually very unexpected, well it was for me anyway.  It gets 5 shiny gold stars!",985046400,2,752,5.181818181818182
