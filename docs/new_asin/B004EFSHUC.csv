4337031,5,B004EFSHUC,"I was so glad to find this in DVD format, because when I first saw it on TV I thought it was terrific and tried to save it from my cable box memory mechanism to a DVD.
  I am fascinated by Quantum Mechanics, but don't have the science backgroung nor the mental capacity to even attempt to understand the concepts.  That's why I have a bookshelf of popularizations for the layman.  Much repetition, but hoping that some new analogy will stick with me (it never does).  A key to Quantum Mechanics is understanding the atom (although Feynman said: ""If you can't do math, you can't do physics"" --- I can't do math).  This presentation takes an historical perspective of the unlocking of the atom.  Even if you can't really conceptualize the later, trickier concepts, you think you have a handle on this part.
  The visual aspect of this is stunning and very informative,  It sticks with you and the narrative, especially with the history format, makes it comprehensible.  I don't know, but I hope, even scientifically minded people will find it entertaining, especially when they recall how important it is to get the public at large invested in science.",1311465600,7,1150,4.728643216080402
8426866,5,B004EFSHUC,This is the best explanation of physics and matter for the layman that exists.,1489363200,,78,4.642857142857143
8426867,1,B004EFSHUC,Problem: DVD for Part 1 is 60 minutes. Actual Broadcast is 1:15. Material is cut out of the middle of the show. Part of Bohr's story is missing as well material on DeBroglie (which is referenced later) and Pauli. Brutal,1477440000,,219,4.5
8426868,5,B004EFSHUC,"Atom is more than just a history... it explains and expands on QM gives you a kind of overview of the connections, like the old James Burke series, but just on QM. This video is just about the only one of Jim Al Khalilli;s you can buy in the US... ""The Secret Life of Chaos"" is also excellent as is ""The Secrets of Quantum Physics"" which doesn't even seem to be on video even in the UK where the Chaos one is 50 Pounds... over $100 US, and wrong region for US... The BBC produces excellent stuff... I guess it is worth the cost, if you can afford it - I just wish I had the money. The quality of the episodes on Youtube are sometime poor quality, and broken up by multiple advertisements...",1433289600,2,690,4.156716417910448
8426869,5,B004EFSHUC,"Excellent series on defining the historical points of the most significant area in science today.  And, especially the true relationship of Einstein, his peers and Comrad's, Einstein was a German Jew, (he could barely speak English when he arrived at Princeton), he is not the greatest scientist to ever live, he didn't support Quantum Mechanics, and Einstein the greatest scientist ever, says who, SAYS A JEW-Bullshit.  There are great scientist throughout history, Einstein made a contribution, but I can guarantee E=MC2 is not exactly true, Radiation from the sun has energy as a wave and a particle, but it has no mass and all of its energy is absorbed into the planet earth, as some form of energy good and bad.  Radiation has no mass velocity, therefore it has no physical impact as in mass or weight but only as a frequency like radio waves, infrared, micro waves and so on.  You can measure the speed of light as a velocity, but you can't measure its mass, and it has no energy force applied to earth as an impact other than radiation, its gravitational force on earths rotation around the sun is its best asset.  X-rays are a form of radiation from the sun, you have a chest X-ray but you can't feel the force of mass on your chest because in doesn't exist as energy or mass.  Without photography you wouldn't see the results of a chest X-ray.  Without photo-synthesis you wouldn't have plants on earth.",1430092800,,1412,4.6923076923076925
8426870,5,B004EFSHUC,"This is a wonderful set - Jim's delivery is clear, concise, and expert. Why can't we get copies of the rest of his wonderful BBC documentaries?",1385510400,4,143,4.538461538461538
8426871,5,B004EFSHUC,"$100???????? You can't be serious. Its a great series but get real. If that wasn't bad enough Jim Al-Kalili has done several great series but this is the ONLY one that's available on DVD. Brian Cox writes out a grocery list and they release a 5 part series on Blu-Ray a week later, but this is all we get from Jim Al-Kalili. Seriously this is just ridiculous.",1357516800,2,359,4.373134328358209
8426872,5,B004EFSHUC,I've been reading up on Quantum Physics for a while now. I find it extremely fascinating. It truly is the deepest rabbit hole one can find. Although i still have limited understanding I understand it is the magic that is at the foundation of all modern technology. I truly appreciate how Professor Jim Al Khalili can simplify something as complex as complex can get. For someone like me with no Science training I found these Videos incredibly powerful. In particular i like the historical information on how the great pioneers of Quantum Physics managed to create one of the most extraordinarily successful ideas of human thought. In particular i became a big fan of Paul Dirac one of the least credited Quantum pioneers who was once quoted by Einstein as not being sure whether he was a genius or mad man. Luckily for Dirac (who was first to tame Quantum Mechanics and combine it with Einstein own work special theory of relativity) Dirac was true a genius. Dirac used his new equation to predict Antimatter years before it ever proven to exist in lab. Dirac is beyond doubt frightenly brilliant!,1340323200,3,1098,4.78421052631579
8426873,4,B004EFSHUC,"I've been trying to find books and videos to educate my kids about atoms, molecules, etc.  I noticed this pricey dvd series on Amazon and decided to google it, and found that the series is presently showing on Youtube and on Google video for free.  I ended up glued to my computer for the full 3 hours watching the videos.  Very informative and interesting.  Well done, high quality.  I wouldn't mind buying the dvd's if the price was reasonable.  To me a hundred bucks is too much, particularly if you can watch on the internet for free.  I would give this five stars for content quality.  Am knocking off a star just because of the high price.",1323648000,22,645,4.452991452991453
8426874,5,B004EFSHUC,First saw this series on BBC America and it blew my socks off.  To have the history of physics explained so clearly and concisely was just amazing and everything Prof. Al-Khalili covered just simply clicked and fell into place in my head.  It inspired me to go back to school and pursue a degree in physics.  My highest recommendation.,1322006400,,335,4.6440677966101696
8426875,5,B004EFSHUC,"Few weeks ago I watched a part of this 3-part series on TV and was wandered by its quality. This is a series where Professor Jim Al-Khalili weaves a fabric of everything known so far about atoms and subatomic particles. He goes on and on telling the evolution of the Ideas about matter from ancient Greeks to modern ideas such as Feynman's Quantum Electrodynamics. He presents this series in such a way that both the layperson and a scientist would find it very interesting, I mean it's neither simple nor complex, but both would agree that the animations and explanations given by Professor Jim Al-Khalili make this subject look simple, although it is not so simple to be grasped. If you plan on spending 100 dollars to buy this, do not think twice, go ahead and buy it. I highly recommend it for high school kids and undergrad students and for anyone who wants to catch up with what physicists have been doing for the past few decades (and centuries)! Also, if you are a instructor and wants to buy this toy to show your students, do like myself: buy it and you'll see how it helps a lot in class.",1313884800,9,1099,4.472636815920398
