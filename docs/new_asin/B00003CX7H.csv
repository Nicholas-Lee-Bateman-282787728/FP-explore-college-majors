1262868,3,B00003CX7H,"While this movie isn't as bad as its reviews, it was lacking in some areas.  The characterization was pretty good...but the storyline dragged on and didn't really seem to be going anywhere.  And I'm not sure it actually did.  On the positive side, Goldie Hawn was wonderful as usual and more attention should have been paid to her as a comedy great.  Although a weird subplot, I thought Andie McDowell and her family to be a rare treat.  Although it was her psychotic father played by Charlton Heston that was given more screen time, her mother--suffering from a rampant wheelchair and the mouth of a sailor--was the standout and should have been used more for comedic purposes.  She was the highlight of the movie!",1009324800,3,715,4.725806451612903
1262869,3,B00003CX7H,"After an almost steady diet of martial arts flicks, I thought it was time for a change.  That's when I switched to this marital art flick:  Town and Country.  Although the movie has been almost universally-panned by critics, I really don't think it's that bad.
Admittedly, the ending is saccharine and weak, and there isn't a plot, but the film is an interesting ride in a slice-of-life kind of way.  When Porter Stoddard discovers his best friend has been having an affair to the detriment of his marriage, it sets him to thinking, albeit with the wrong head.  When it seems that everyone in his household is in the midst of a rut season, it sets him over the edge.  Porter's inevitable adulterous affairs are truly entertaining, if unbelievable.  Two out of the four women he becomes amorously attached to are absolute wackos (one believes her dolls are alive and another believes she's been impregnated by a cello), and it's probably this, as much as his love for his wife, that makes him attempt to get back into his earlier, saner state of marital bliss.
The movie is filled with understated ironies, and it's this subtlety that saves the movie from being a total flop.  I enjoyed the little touches, like the cellist's wonderful tattoos, the interior decorator's home being absolutely hideous, and the awkward homo-erotic tension between Griffin and Porter.
Most of all, I enjoyed the performance of Charlton Heston as the psychotic father of an insane ski bunny.  Town and Country is worth watching just for the scene where Porter meets this family.  I laughed so hard, I had pause the movie to catch my breath.",1006387200,3,1618,4.787769784172662
1262870,2,B00003CX7H,"I understand completely why this movie sat on the shelf since 1998. It should have stayed there. I haven't seen a movie this poorly directed and unfunny since Breakfast of Champions. The story revolves around Warren Beatty's character, Porter Stoddard, a chronic adulterer married to Diane Keaton. Goldie Hawn and Garry Shandling play their friends also going thru marital problems of their own.

It's beautifully shot, the score's pretty good, the opening scenes are okay...but then we're left with characters with no motivation doing ridiculous things, who show up unexpectedly with no explanation as to how they got there or why they're there, and a complete lack of any sensible ending.  Garry Shandling almost redeems this film.  But that's a very, very, very, very big almost.",1004486400,5,543,4.869565217391305
1262872,1,B00003CX7H,"Believe the rest of the reviewers when they say that this possibly may be the worst movie ever made.  My review is only based on watching 1/2 of the movie because after the scene where Charlton Heston starts bellowing like a dragon, I had to turn it off or be sick to my stomach.  My feeling is that movie is just too young for the actors playing the lead roles.  Warren Beatty is in his 60's - yes I know that men get better as they get older, but seeing yet another movie where the husbands start to have mid life crises and start having affairs and the women are clueless is just passe at this point.  These are roles that these actors can play with their eyes closed.  They certainly have proven time and time again that they are talented - why did they waste their time on this drivel?",1004400000,4,790,4.2052980132450335
1262873,1,B00003CX7H,"I doubt I will see a worse movie this year or next. After three years of rewrites, reshoots and re-edits, Warren Beatty's latest vehicle is released and falls mightily flat with a huge crash. All the post-production hoopla did nothing but destroy the film's chances of ever finding any artistic success or adding any glimmer to the careers of those involved. Beatty and Garry Shandling are idiot actors in idiotic roles as two men who can't stop cheating on their wives. Goldie Hawn and Diane Keaton hardly fare any better as the women who are being betrayed by these philandering gits (this is a very far cry from The First Wives Club). All the other talented performers, from Jenna Elfman to Andie MacDowell to Joshua Hartnett, are wasted in thankless roles that for the most part don't even make any sense. The film's script has absolutely no humour beyond the odd moment, and most of its scenes end without ever having gone anywhere. Even Beatty can't avoid the fact that he is just too old to be in something so ridiculous; with no character strength written in, how are we supposed to believe that all these gorgeous women a third his age would fall for this twelve hundred year-old goofball? The enjoyment level here is equal to a non-novocaine-assisted drilling in a back-alley dentist's chair. Unbelievable that is written by the man who wrote To Die For and co-wrote Heaven Can Wait with Beatty.",1003449600,4,1405,4.762295081967213

The Movie came and went quickly in theatres and I had decided I would Purchase on dvd. I don't regert buting this movie but a lot of people probbally won't like enough to own. One more thing The dvd is bare bones and includes only the trailer and cast and crew biogrpies and the option to watch it in wide or full on a one sided disc which i liked, I hate flipper dvds like terminator and goodfellas.

1262875,2,B00003CX7H,"The American public really OVER does things sometimes.  I've heard people say this is the worst movie of all time, and that it's the worst film of the year. I don't understand how and why someone would say that. Yes, I'm rating this movie 2 stars. And yes I didn't like it. But there appears to be two sides to this movie. Side 1- OK, yes it gets a bit confusing and yes the acting isn't great which is a suprise due to this cast. But, hey, it's funny. Go see this movie because you will laugh. Side 2- It's dumb! It has bad acting and isn't funny. It's also the worst movie of the year and the worst movie ever made. Here are my thoughts on the film. It has a very thin plot. There are moments in this film where we have scenes in this movie that make no sense. I mean, it doesn't movie the story along. I didn't get the purpose of certain scenes. For example, there's a scene where  Porter Stoddard (Warren Beatty) walks into his kitchen in the middle of the night and soon his son,his daughter's boyfriend and his maid's boyfriend all find themselves in the kitchen too. What's the point? I guess the director, Peter Chelsom thought to himself, well, people might think this is a funny scene. Maybe we'll get some laughs out of this, lets keep it in. Bad idea Peter! We've all heard the on the set stories about this movie. About, how long it took to make, about the 90 million dollar budget, and about the script changes. So with that in mind it should come as no suprise to anyone when I say the movies doesn't seem complete. It moves briskly but things don't add up. The story isn't solid. We're going from scene to scene and the ONLY purpose of the scenes is the punchline at the end. Everything in the begining is setup for the joke at the end. And after they make they're joke the scene is cut to a new scene that has the same agenda. The story as we all know is about Warren Beatty (Porter Stoddard)and his wife Diane Keaton (Ellie Stoddard) who seem to have a good marriage. Unlike there best friends Mona (Goldie Hawn) and Griffin (Garry Shandling). Griffin has been cheating on his wife, but, not with a woman! Soon, they get a divorce. Now while this is going on, Porter (Beatty) for reasons unbeknown to me starts to cheat on his wife! But, it happens so fast! They didn't lead up to it, which I didn't like. There is also an amazing waste of talent here. Andie MacDowell plays Eugenie Claybourne, one of the women Porter was with. But her part is so bland, and she barely has any screentime. Why put a famous actress in such a small role? The answer- so people will go see the movie. The same is true with Jenna Elfin (Auburn). Now, I'm not really a fan of her's but she is given an even smaller role than MacDowell! And Nastassja Kinski (Alex) has 3 scenes! And oh my God does she look old!  lol. I guess I never realized how old she is. She looks awful now lol. But, while I have all these faults with the movie, it is funny. I couldn't stop laughing at a bedroom scene with Beatty and MacDowell. And the scene where Beatty meets MacDowell's parents played by Charlton Heston and Marian Seldes. There were about 3 other scenes that I felt really worked and the rest of the movie is either smile material or just a failed attempt. It's NOT the worst movie of the year and it's NOT the worst movie of all time. If people are looking for a movie that's funny but not well made, it really wouldn't hurt to go see this movie, it's not a great comedy but it tries to be. ** 1\2 out of *****",990489600,3,3502,4.2395209580838324
1262876,2,B00003CX7H,"Other than death, can anything get more laughs than infidelity?  Apparently screenwriters Michael Laughlin and Buck Henry don't think so.  And, after all, it is the stuff of which many a black comedy has been made.  Unfortunately, ""Town and Country,"" directed by Peter Chelsom, is anything but a black comedy.  A comedy, perhaps, but one that lands more in a gray area; there's some laughs along the way, to be sure, and there's something of a moral to be found in the end.  Maybe.  But then again-- well-- it's just that kind of movie.  It takes you on a ride, but it's like one at an amusement park-- by the time you get off, if you're not prone to motion sickness, you may have had a good time but you're right back where you started.  And maybe a little wary of getting back on for another go.
 Without a doubt, the star power involved with this project keeps it afloat.  Beginning with Warren Beatty, who plays Porter Stoddard, an architect who lives and works in New York City.  He's just celebrated his twenty-fifth wedding anniversary with Ellie (Diane Keaton), and during all the years he's never once gone astray.  Then he finds out that his best friend, Griffin (Garry Shandling), has been caught cheating by his wife of many years-- and also one of Porter's best friends-- Mona (Goldie Hawn).  And at this point, some kind of domino effect comes into play apparently, because like a contagious virus, the next thing you know, Porter is in the sack with a young cellist (Nastassja Kinski) he's just met.  Actually, that's the first scene of the movie, and from there it goes back to fill you in on how it all came about.  Sort of.
 What Chelsom has on his hands is a mishmash of plot lines and characters that are somewhat amusing and interesting in themselves, but like the frayed ends of a rope, they all just kind of hang out there blowing in the wind and lead nowhere.  There's some really funny moments here that will make you laugh out loud, but they come more from a lack of context than anything else.  When you have to put Beatty in a polar bear suit to fish for laughs, you know something is rotten in Denmark.  The funniest part in the whole movie comes when Porter has a brief interlude with a woman he meets while on a trip to Sun Valley with Griffin.  Her name is Eugenie (Andie MacDowell), and she's something of a whack-o; but she doesn't hold a candle to her shotgun toting father (Charlton Heston).  It's funny, sure; but you get the feeling it came about because the writers were looking at their storyboard one day and said, ""Hey!  Why don't we put in a crazy guy with a gun here-- and we can get Charlton Heston, and...""
 The redeeming factor of the whole movie is the cast.  Beatty and Keaton are good together, and make you believe that Porter and Ellie have been married for twenty-five years.  Shandling is perfectly cast as Griffin, the man with a secret, and Goldie Hawn is not only good, but gorgeous.  In fact, the older she gets, the better she looks.  And MacDowell is a treat, playing somewhat against type, but the real sparkplug of the entire film is Jenna Elfman, who plays Auburn, a young woman the guys meet on their trip to Idaho.  She has a quirky and charming screen presence, and though her part is small, she brightens the whole show.
 The supporting cast includes Josh Hartnett, Buck Henry, Mare Casabani, Marian Seldes and Katharine Towne.  There's more dead-ends in ""Town and Country"" than the East Side Kids ever encountered, but it's good for some laughs and it's a passable evening's entertainment.  But keep in mind, it's like cotton candy; it's fairly sweet, but the flavor-- what there is of it-- doesn't last very long.  And it just won't satisfy your sweet tooth.  Before you know it, you're going to want some real candy.",988588800,3,3786,4.545051698670606
1262957,4,B00003CX7H,"(three and 1/2 stars)
Town and Country is NOT the worst motion picture Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton and Goldie Hawn starred in. Negative media coverage ""killed"" this movie before it even opened in 2001. The overall tenor of the film is hilarious, but there are ambiguities. This isn't unusual for any picture Beatty stars in, whether solely as an actor in a film directed and produced by someone else (as in this case), or as one who also controls the production (as the director, producer, and/or writer). Because the stories are often intentionally not as straightforward as ""Sesame Street,"" viewers must pay close attention to avoid overlooking something that's essential to the plot. Town and Country is no exception.

During a tryst, Alex (Nastassja Kinski) tells Porter (Beatty) she is ""married"" to her Stradivarius cello, the same as a person ""married"" to a spiritual vocation or other career. Later, she ecstatically informs him of ""the report from the doctor"" confirming she's pregnant. Even later, Porter, who presumes he's the child's father, is surprised when Alex suddenly utters the name of ""Didier"" (dee-dee-yaa) as the actual father of her child, saying that the pregnancy has gloriously revived her relationship with that man, and she didn't know she was expecting when she met Porter, indicating that she originally thought Porter was the father. This refutes the mistaken deduction by some viewers that Alex believes a stringed instrument impregnated her! Unlike Eugenie (Andie MacDowell), favorably disposed toward tall tales, Alex isn't a liar or delusional.

After just one night of pseudosexual role-playing with dolls by Eugenie and a bewildered Porter (who's too traumatized by her gun-crazed father [Charlton Heston] to dare begin a physical affair with her), Eugenie deludes herself that she and Porter are eloping. Overhearing Auburn (Jenna Elfman), whom Porter almost sleeps with but gets caught first, tell Ellie (Keaton) that a contrite Porter professed his undying love for nobody else but Ellie, Eugenie, trapped in her own fantasyland, is so distraught that it compels her father to seek revenge.

Porter sleeps on a sofa in his office when he and Ellie separate, and she refuses all phone contact with him. At the end of the picture he is still sleeping on his office sofa--and wearing his wedding ring! Divorced people usually sleep in the residence awarded to them, and the wedding bands are no longer on the fingers. Ellie may have thought twice about divorcing, following Porter's heartstrings-tugging mea culpa in attorney David Suttler's (Buck Henry) office, but not yet ready to take him back, especially after he said there was something else she needed to know (confessing his assignations with his and Ellie's best friend, perhaps?). It appears they continue in (undivorced) separation, with Porter feverishly striving to win Ellie back, she at last accepting his phone calls, and then finally allowing him to come out to the country house.

Many men wish they looked as good as Beatty did when he made this movie. Ruggedly sexy, with no plastic surgery on loose facial and neck skin that's normal for someone alive over six decades--and showing more of his body in this movie than he did in his youth, Beatty sizzled and, at 74, still does, with the clout and wealth to attract several yacht loads of women of all ages, were he so inclined! Unlike his character Porter, and his real-life heyday as Hollywood's leading UNMARRIED playboy, the filmmaking genius has remained FAITHFULLY wed to just one woman--the luminous and spectacularly talented Annette Bening--for nearly two decades, fathering four children with her! Twenty years ago, countless viewers (I included) believed that, although Beatty would never be a deadbeat and unloving father, divorced or not, Bening would be Mrs. Warren Beatty for only a short season until he tired and moved on to another woman. Man, we sure have egg on our faces now!",1319673600,,3953,5.124031007751938

1262959,1,B00003CX7H,"That depressing thought should motivate Beatty to make another movie and quick. It's been nearly eight years since this one came out and he's not getting any younger. As if the fact that this film is a crude sex romp that isn't funny or sexy isn't enough consider that it cost over $90 million to make. So many talented people, including Diane Keaton (Beatty's companion for many years), Nastassja Kinski, Andie McDowell, Jenna Elfman, Goldie Hawn, Garry Shandling and Josh Hartnett, are wasted and embarrassed here. (Let's not even mention Charlton Heston's cringe inducing performance which finds him growling like a dragon and chasing Beatty around with a rifle). The film begins with a nude Warren (thankfully covered by a sheet) being serenaded by a nude cellist. He informs us in a useless narration that this isn't his wife and that this will never happen again. Cut to Paris where he and his actual wife (Keaton) are celebrating their anniversary with another married couple (Shandling and Hawn). After the couples return from their vacation Hawn learns that Shandling is cheating on her and files for divorce. Devastated she confides in Keaton who's positive her husband could never do something like that. Guess again since the film tastelessly finds Beatty and Hawn hooking up and shows them having sex on numerous occasions. Warren doesn't stop there though  he goes on to romance McDowell, Kinski, and Elfman before finally coming clean to his wife. Not even Jack Nicholson, Warren's good pal, acts this bad in his movies so why should Beatty think he could get away with it? It's a terrible film that should depress fans of anyone involved.",1249948800,,1654,4.971119133574007

1263009,2,B00003CX7H,"If taken at face value, you'd expect TOWN AND COUNTRY to be an excellent movie: The script is written by Buck Henry, (co-creator with Mel Brooks of the classic TV comedy GET SMART), directed by Peter Chelsom who made the vastly underappreciated THE MIGHTY and featuring an all-star cast including Warren Beatty, Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton, Jenna Elfman, Nastassja Kinski, Andie MacDowell and Charlton Heston. You'd think TOWN AND COUNTRY would be pretty special, right? Wrong.
As soon as you read studio press hailing this as FIRST WIVES CLUB (which starred Keaton and Hawn) meets ANNIE HALL (which also starred Keaton), you just know you're not getting anything new.
Anyway the plot: Porter Stoddard (Beatty) has been happily married to Ellie (Keaton) for a quarter century. But when his best friend Griffin (Garry Shandling) tells him about an affair he had and how great it was; Porter decides to give it a go- by cheating on no less than four women at the same time. These include Mona (Goldie Hawn- still attractive, but obviously uses a double for her sex scene) sexy cellist Alex (Kinski) who plays music in the nude, as well as a ski-er (Andie MacDowell) and a shop owner (Jenna Elfman). Yep, so in a sledgehammer-subtle dig at his wild past, Clyde Barrow himself; toupe clad and wrinkly, every elderly spinster's fantasy man; plays a womaniser! Didn't see that one coming. Another surprise is Charlton Heston's role as MacDowell's dad who just happens to be ... a gun nut. No subtle nuances present in this movie.
TOWN AND COUNTRY veers uneasily between light romantic comedy and screwball farce and doesn't really suceed as either. When will film makers realize an all-star cast is usually a recipe for critical and box office disaster? It all starts with the STORY, people
In summation TOWN AND COUNTRY isn't a total failure, but its more a lumbering actors' showcase than the light entertainment you'd expect. Given the talent involved this is a huge disappointment. I was expecting better from Beatty after his brilliant satire BULWORTH. Watch that instead. And Chelsom should stop trying to be Robert Altman- 90% of the time HIS all-star efforts are garbage- and get back to what he's good at.",1054339200,5,2206,4.916890080428955

1263012,1,B00003CX7H,"""Inconsistent"" is the keyword of ""Town and Country.""  I mean, the keyword of how to explain the failure of the film.  Maybe I'm mistaken, but when I watched it in theater in Japan, the touch of photography slightly changes in the last 30 minutes.  At first, the colors and the light of the film are soft, but near the ending they get suddenly sharper and things look more distinct.  And maybe I'm mistaken again, but the opening credit has it ""Joshua Hartnett"" while in the ending credit ""Josh Hartnett,"" the way he is usually known now.
What I want to say is, as you know, ""Town and Country"" has experienced several re-writes because of negative response from the viewers at the screen test.  But to re-write or re-shoot a film is not unusual these days -- ""Fatal Attration"" is one good example -- but in this case, the bad reaction from the audience could have been predicted with ease.  Check out the story.  The hero, who suddenly turns a philanderer when his should be well mature, is played by none other than Warren Beatty (come on!); he has an affiar with a beautiful cellist (sexy Nastassja Kinski) and his friend's wife (ever gorgeous Goldie Hawn); and then, he goes on to have another one (apparently) with Andie MacDowell and Jenna Elfman.  He regrets (why not?) and goes back to his wife Diane Keaton, and asks to be forgiven, and ... she forgives!!  Okay, this is an ultimate fantasy for men, I understand, but no one, male or female, buys that idea.  So, Buck Henry was called as script-doctor, but even his talent could do nothing.  As a result, sometimes the film looks like a romance; sometimes a farce (and not a bad one when Gary Shandling is allowed to do his stuff): sometimes very serious and  ... forget it.  By now, you got my point.  The film is always apologetic for what it is based on.  Whoever gave this impossible script a green light?
At the climax ceremony scene, many co-stars hurriedly show up one by one -- Elfman, MacDowell, Kinski, and Heston -- but so hurriedly go away that this final showdown, which could be used as a good slapstick farce, vanishes without a trace.  It is as if they got other commitments.  Maybe they did.  It looks as if they are running away, and if so, it's a wise decision.",1013212800,9,2237,4.522388059701493
1263013,3,B00003CX7H,"This film took over three years to bring to the screen with a budget of over $90 million.  Having grossed less than $7 million at the box office, it stands out as one of the biggest box office disasters in history.  Actually, it isn't that bad, but it is by no means as good a film as one would suppose looking at the cast.
The film features an outstanding cast, but an undistinguished director and writing team.  The result is a whole lot of talented people going through the motions saying lines that are seldom funny in skits that are mostly insipid.  The story is a typical midlife crisis comedy where Porter (Warren Beatty) and Griffin (Garry Shandling) perpetrate various indiscretions on their loyal wives of 25 years.  This is clearly a comedy aimed at the 45+ demographic with little traction among the younger moviegoers that represent the lion share of entertainment dollars spent.
The ensemble cast of noted veterans does a decent job with sparse material.  Warren Beatty gives the best performance, with a plenty of good physical comedy despite the weak lines.  Goldie Hawn and Jenna Elfman are also good.  Diane Keaton and Garry Shandling are well off their game in this film and Andie MacDowell and Nastassja Kinski are little more than window dressing.  Charleton Heston steals the show with an outrageous cameo as MacDowell's father.
This film fails to scratch its way above the water line with a great deal of (expensive) talent wasted.  The whole is far less than the sum of the parts.  I rated it a 5/10.  It's worth a try for middle aged viewers.",1012953600,2,1567,4.720588235294118
1263014,2,B00003CX7H,"Wow... look at all the big names out there: Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton, Goldie Hawn, Gary Shandling, Andie McDowell, Nastassja Kinsky, Charlton Heston, Jenna Elfman, Josh Harnett... They somehow reminded me of another star-studded movie, ""Everyone says I love you"" (featuring Woody Allen, Goldie Hawn, Alan Alda, Julia Roberts, Edward Norton, Drew Barrymore, Natasha Lyonne, Natalie Portman...) which remains one of the best comedies ever. My point is, don't blame it on the actors. They could be at their best or at their worst (and they all got bills to pay don't they?) That being said, I believe poor movies like ""Town & Country"" are worth being made, just to render fairness and more value to good movies like ""Everyone says I love you"".",1010793600,3,743,5.0
1263015,5,B00003CX7H,"Having seen Town and Country twice, I am very surprised by the negative reviews.  Here is a film that offered a tour de force in ensemble acting, scenes that were deliciously subtle and laugh-out-loud hilarious, a plot that poked goodnatured fun at both human foibles and society's icons and still managed to address serious issues without somehow trivializing them.
  For once you have mature characters (however flawed) played by mature actors, Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton, Goldie Hawn and Gary Shandling whose chemistry and respect for each other fuel the story with an unstoppable energy and generous spirit. The supporting cast with Natassia Kinski, Andie Macdowell, Genna Elfman and Charlton Heston play their roles to perfection.
  Town and Country is partly a contemporary and very literate comedy of manners and partly a cautionary tale about taking the gifts we have for granted.  Despite his fall from grace, as in any classic comedy, Warren Beatty's character has a chance at redemption and a chance to reclaim conjugal bliss.  Regardless of the poor reviews, I predict that Town and Country will prove to be a sleeper classic.",1009929600,4,1139,5.157608695652174

7917215,3,B00003CX7H,"This film has been so pilloried, I expected the worst! It was a funny movie, nothing special, not a flop, as I had read so much before.
From all I have read, this movie lost around $100 million to New Line Cinema, with a $10 million payday to Warren Beatty.
This movie should have been made for very little money, but probably the bulk of the budget went to the stars' salaries, especially after the movie was stopped for 9 months, and then all the main actors were recalled to finish the movie, getting paid again, the original salary figure.
The movie has funny moments, clever writing, and it could have been made for little money, but for Beatty, his multiple takes on every scene, and the huge cost overruns this created.
The movie is pleasant, but nothing special.",1385078400,,770,4.546762589928058
