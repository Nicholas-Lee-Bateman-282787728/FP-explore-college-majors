2544088,4,B000EXHTFC,"""Summer Interlude"" is an often overlooked pearl from Bergman's film catalog. It's not as famous or as experimental as his other releases from this period, such as ""Sawdust and Tinsel."" Nevertheless it's quite good and I hold it in high regard. It fits in among the romantic-themed films he made from time to time--a close twin to ""Summer with Monika,"" which he made a couple years later. Both share the theme of young adults navigating the pleasures and dangers of falling in love over the course of a single summer. Monika is a classic, in part because of Harriet Anderson's notoriety, but ""Summer Interlude"" is a sweeter film and the characters more likable. The protagonist played by Maj-Britt Nilsson, is both beautiful and admirable without the seedier bohemian carnality of Harriet Anderson's Monika. I know a lot of Bergman fans like ""Summer with Monika"" and both films are worth seeing, but to me ""Summer Interlude"" is the stronger film.

Regarding this DVD version: Tartan has released several Bergman films on DVD that aren't otherwise available in the US. They're in PAL format, which may discourage American fans since they probably aren't playable on the typical television DVD player. But I've had success playing them on my computer's DVD player. For some reason computers are more flexible about formats. If you don't mind watching a film on your laptop, you may be able to view this and the other Bergman films Tartan has released.",1157500800,16,1448,4.958847736625515

This is a very good movie, but not one of Bergman's greatest.  It is better than 99.5% of the movies produced in the U.S. in any given year.

2544100,4,B000EXHTFC,"Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman is one of the world's most accomplished and influential directors of all time.

Known for a plethora of films in his oeuvre such as ""The Seventh Seal"", ""Wild Strawberries"", ""Fanny and Alexander"",  to name a few.  Bergman is best known for films that dealt with existential questions of mortality, loneliness and religious faith.  Many of the films, especially the characters are an expression of how Bergman felt at the time.

And many of his stylistic and conceptual themes were formed in his earlier work, especially stories that were set in summer.  ""Smiles of a Summer Night"", ""Summer with Monika"", ""Wild Strawberries"", etc.

But one film that resonated strongly with Bergman was an earlier film from 1951 titled ""Summer Interlude"".  Bergman wrote in his book ""Bergman on Bergman"", ""For me Summer Interlude is one of my most important films. Even though to an outsider it may seem terribly pass&eacute;, for me it isn't. This was my first film in which I felt I was functioning independently, with a style of my own, making a film all my own, with a particular appearance of its own, which no one could ape. It was like no other film. It was all my own work. Suddenly I knew I was putting the camera on the right spot, getting the right results; that everything added up. For sentimental reasons, too, it was also fun making it.""

And for the many cineaste who have followed Bergman's work, many credit ""Summer Interlude"" as his ""breathrough"" film and featuring a style that would later be fully expanded in later films.

VIDEO:

""Summer Interlude"" is presented in 1080p High Definition black and white (1:37:1 aspect ratio).  The video quality looks amazing considering that the film is 60-years-old.  The detail is amazing as the film shows quite a good number of closeups.  You can see the skin pores and the details on Marie's face, her clothing... for the most part, the clarity of ""Summer Interlude"" looks amazing, black levels are nice and deep, white and grays are well-contrast and this film has not suffered any major damage.

With that being said, there are some white specks and a few lines and scratches that do show up from time-to-time, but the majority of the film looks absolutely great.  In fact, there is a good reason for the scratches which the Criterion Collection mention in the booklet.

According to the Criterion Collection, the original negative of ""Summer Interlude"" has been lost; this new digital transfer was constructed from two 35 mm duplicate negative sources.  The Criterion Collection accessed the first, the only existing 35 mm duplicate negative in Sweden, at the Swedish Film Institute and was transferred in 2K resolution on an ARRISCAN film scanner at Chimney Pot in Stockholm.  Much of the duplicate negative, however, was scratched, as well as riddled with mold so persistent that in some sections, it was impossible to remove completely, even after more than 400 hours of restoration.

The Criterion Collection then discovered another 35 mm duplicate negative, in Janus Films vaults, made in 1966 and stored under the alternate title ""Illicit Interlude"".  Though there was no mold problem with this duplicate negative, much of it suffered from severe shrinkage, which can cause the right side of the frame to buckle and be out of focus.

The Criterion Collection was able to replace the sections of the Swedish Film Institute transfer that suffered from the worst mold and scratches.  The final master, which still contains scratches that could not be repaired, incorporates nine minutes of Janus Films' negative with the original transfer.

Additionally thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices and warps were manually removed using MTI's DRS, while Image Systems' Phoenix and PixelFarms' PFClean were used for small dirt, grain, jitter and flicker.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Summer Interlude"" is presented in monaural Swedish with English subtitles.  Dialogue and music are clear from the monaural track and detected no hiss or crackle during my viewing.

According to the Criterion Collection, the original monaural soundtrack was mastered at 24-bit from a 35mm optical soundtrack print.  Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD.  Crackle was attenuate using AudioCube's integrated workstation.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Summer Interlude - The Criterion Collection #613 on Blu-ray comes with no special features.

EXTRAS:

""Summer Interlude - The Criterion Collection #613 comes with a 20-page booklet featuring the essay ""Love and Death in the Swedish Summer"" by Peter Cowie.

JUDGMENT CALL:

As many new fans of Ingmar Bergman are starting to discover a lot of his films through Blu-ray (many released by the Criterion Collection) and on DVD via Criterion's ""Eclipse Series"", many have been introduced to his most earlier work and also his most revered work in his oeuvre.

""Summer Interlude"" is a film that is important because it is a beginning for Ingmar Bergman as a filmmaker.  It's a film that was the first to give Bergman independence and the freedom to create a film his way, his style and was literally the precursor to many of the films that people who have collected his films from the Criterion Collection.  It all begins with this film!

And it's a film that exemplifies Swedish filmmaking but it's also a personal film for Ingmar Bergman.

In Sweden, June and July offer people from the city, to enjoy summer vacation in the countryside before the cold, harsh winter.  And it's a season that Bergman would follow in later films in capturing the summertime, as one of the most memorable experiences in his life took place when Bergman was a teenager.  It is where Bergman would have a magnificent love affair with a young woman who unfortunately contracted polio.

In 1949, Bergman wrote a short story about this young woman and he would eventually go on to use the story for the film ""Summer Interlude"".

""Summer Interlude"" is a film that is beautiful to watch.  Capturing the beauty of the island region in film, capturing the silhouettes of the characters, but most importantly, how the moods of the characters reflect what is shown onscreen.  Visually rich, the film would attract cineaste and was lauded by film critics including Cahiers du Cinema critic (and filmmaker) Jean Luc Godard who also praised the film's beauty.  American film critic Pauline Kael  would praise ""Summer Interlude"" for its ""elegiac grace and sweetness.""

Actress Maj-Britt Nelson (who worked on Bergman's ""To Joy"" and ""Secrets of Women"") was remarkable in playing  28-year old ballerina named Maria who looks tired of life.  Doing something she loves, but yet looks rather effete, a loss of enthusiasm.  But often a person has a hard time letting emotions go of something that has happened in the past.

It's an elegy that perhaps Ingmar Bergman has kept with him when he wrote the original story back in the late '40s.  Marie more or less represents Bergman, who saw the young woman that he loved contracting polio.  A woman full of energy and life can change within a second.

We see the same with Marie,  when the story takes the viewer through a flashback when Marie is 15-years-old.  Unlike herself in the future, she is full of energy, constantly giggling, vibrant and full of life.  She feeds off the beauty of the island and she feeds of her love for Henrik.

Birg Malmsten did a wonderful job of playing the shy and timid college student and both Marie and Hendrik are perhaps the juxtaposition of Bergman and the young woman he had a love affair with.  For many people, to love at a young age and to see that love taken away is a painful experience.

While Bergman films would expand to characters that have lost their identities and at times, the storyline are darker than what is featured in ""Summer Interlude"", this film has a sense of pureness, hope and one person trying to find her way through tragedy.  The elegy of Marie shows us the corruption of youth in a different kind of way that most traditional films tend to explore of such things.

And as ""Summer Interlude"" has no doubt showcased an elegiac grace and beauty.  There is a visual style for the film that captures the balance of happiness, vibrancy, sadness and regret, but most importantly, a style that also brings to the viewer...hope.  Magnificent!

On Blu-ray, I was thrilled with the overall quality of the film.  The Criterion Collection have really gone to great lengths into having a proper restoration of ""Summer Interlude"" and reading in the booklet of how far they had to go in finding the best prints, it's no surprise that this Bergman film had taken so long to be released (considering The Criterion Collection have released so many films from Bergman's ouevre on video).  And as people wonder how come some films take longer than others to be released in the US, it appears that the Criterion Collection really went through hoops and bounds to take two existing film elements and present ""Summer Interlude"" in the best quality as possible.  And I'm grateful for the company for doing that.

While I wish there were special features included on this Blu-ray release, especially an audio commentary, to make up for it, the Blu-ray is much cheaper than other Blu-rays.

""Summer Interlude"" is an Ingmar Bergman film that is a must see, must own film to own, if you are a fan of his work or really want a film that shows a major breakthrough within Bergman's fillmmaking and would be among Bergman's earlier films to jumpstart the period of  fantastic Swedish cinema.

It's also important to note that with the release of ""Summer Interlude"", Bergman's other summer film ""Summer with Monika"" (1953), which shows us an alternate storyline of ""what if?"", as a couple who met on summer vacation, must take responsibility when the young woman gets pregnant. So, with the release of both films in May 2012, you'll definitely want to pick up both of these Ingmar Bergmans film on Blu-ray!

Overall, ""Summer Interlude"" is a highly recommended film despite its lack of special features.",1352332800,9,10084,4.940059347181009
2544101,5,B000EXHTFC,"Maybe it's because I first saw this film when I was 16 myself, but having seen it again every ten years over the last 40 years, I find the it holds up well.  It is often compared with ""Monika,"" but this film is more complicated, and Bergman is able to move easily from idyllic summer imagery to deeper subjects, from light moods to darker ones-- sometimes within the same shot.  So many of Bergman's future themes are already masterfully treated here:  loss, life and death reflected in the seasons, regret, nostalgia, even God's silence are palpable here in what would ordinarily be only a teenage love story (which ""Monika"" comes closer to).  I highly recommend this as someone's first Bergman film or even as a cure for those who are allergic to his density.  Everything is dosed out with sincerity and mastery. After ten films, Bergman came of age by making one of the best films ever made about youth.",1346112000,2,906,4.6375
2544102,5,B000EXHTFC,"(Review based on the Criterion release on DVD - checked out from local library with included booklet and original case)

I have been a Bergman fan for years.  The man could create some of the most strikingly beautiful black and white films ever.  Even watching this film, one of the earlier in his career (his 10th directing), the cinematography is haunting.  I could turn off the sound and subtitles and just watch the film for the beauty and the expressions of the amazingly talented cast.

In this film we see a series of flashbacks by the main character and ballet dancer Maria.  Her flashbacks are triggered after receiving a diary in the post.  The flashbacks take place 13 years earlier at her uncle's country house and estate.  The setting is idyllic and filled with the energy of youth.  Maj-Britt Nilsson plays a very convincing teenager (I figure she is supposed to be between 17 and 20) as well as a believable aging ballerina in the present time.  In typical Bergman fashion, we are given little snippets of foreshadowing.  One character even remarks on the ""presence of death"" around the lake.

I won't give away anything in the film, but I will say that it's not as happy go lucky as Smiles of a Summer Night, nor as dark as his later films.  Instead it has an interesting dichotomy between the present, where Marie is obviously suffering emotionally, and the past where things were free spirited.  There is an occurrence which ties the time and the emotional state of Marie together.  The use of shadow is of particular note in the past after this event.

I particularly enjoyed the supporting cast.  Marie's 'uncle' is very odd.  There is also some insinuation that he may have been with Marie at some point, and in fact later in the film we see that in the period between the past and present it may have occurred again (or for the first time).  But Bergman doesn't spell it out, and it is left to the viewer to interpret.  When we first see her uncle it is when he places a bracelet on Marie's wrist (in her youth) and fondly (and far to familiarly) kisses her wrist.  Henrik's aunt is also entertaining in her one scene, as is the rabbi in the same scene.  Other notable supporting characters are the ballet company dancers and maestro.

There are a few well shot scenes with Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake.  It is of note that the film almost follows a Swan Lake arc to the story, albeit slightly different in the end.  But Swan Lake is a tale about youthful innocence and love only to become much darker in the second half and end tragically.

This is not up to the level of Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, Persona, or Smiles of a Summer Night; but this film does take the first step from Bergman's more obvious and narrower earlier films into the greatest era of his directing.  The depth in this film is impressive, especially since it was unexpected for me.  Criterion did well to restore and release this film under their regular line and not in the Eclipse series.

Of note: There aren't any special features on the DVD.  You get the film on one disc, though it is amazingly restored despite its age (1951).  Instead of special features, Criterion has included a 20 odd page booklet with some additional reading.  This is an amazing addition and I highly recommend reading it after viewing.  The booklet helps the viewer to dissect much of the film, including the reasons Bergman chose the particular setting and the irony of the title 'Sommarlek'.

If you are a Bergman fan, you will like the foreshadowing to later films; in one scene the rabbi plays chess with the aunt while discussing Death, in another scene the characters comment on how they ""love wild strawberries"".  Both put a smile on my face.

So is this film worth a purchase?  For true Bergman fans, yes.  Otherwise, if you can get a copy from the library I might recommend picking it up.  Especially for the booklet.  If you can rent it or watch it streaming, then perhaps check it out that way first.  It's a great film, but I doubt I will be re-watching it over and over like Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries.  But $14.99 is more than a fair price for the DVD version.",1343260800,2,4158,4.571041948579161
2544103,4,B000EXHTFC,"This film is best watched in the context of Bergman's later work.  Many themes and motifs Bergman was to develop more fully later are present here.  You are shown the struggle of the artist (The Magician, Hour of the Wolf, etc.), religious crisis (Through a Glass Darkly, Winter Light), figures of death (The Seventh Seal), troubled relationships (all of Bergman), unsavory family members (Fanny and Alexander, Saraband), young love (Summer with Monika), cynical old people (Wild Strawberries), journeys back in time (Strawberries) and the wistfully short Nordic summers (Monika and Strawberries).  There is even a game of chess (Seventh Seal, Passion of Anna, etc.).

The narrative is a bit hokey, but it does have a way of getting under your skin.  Even though the lead actors (Maj-Britt Nilsson and Birger Malmsten) are much too old for their roles, there is a poignancy to their story (which I won't give away).  The score by Erik Nordgren is appropriately wistful and anticipates his later one for Wild Strawberries.  It is also appropriately somber--the film isn't a comedy by any means.

A few rough continuity jumps remind us that this is pre-genius Bergman (who was generally strong technically).  The new Criterion release (2012), however, does restore a few seconds that were whacked off prior to its release in the U.S. during the 1950s (the footage shows the two leads climbing into bed with each other).

All in all, recommended for Bergman students and fans or for those who have a strong liking for Swedish movies.",1339113600,,1530,5.035714285714286
2544104,5,B000EXHTFC,"these are terrific Criterion releases timed to our seasonal climatic. spot on. Bergman was building a film machine that would ultimately place him in the top 5 all time worldwide best directors (or ten if you are stateside fanatics). these are great examples that capture the uncluttered beauty of that country in the early 1950's just before mass production became a disease taking root and hold everywhere. while also revealing the youthful, rebelliousness, restless angst that subtly connected the first generation to come of age after WW II, manifesting subliminally and unspoken. I always preferred his black and white films over his color stock productions.

Bergman was a serious womanizer which is hinted at in a Summer With Monika featurette that would never be satiated in his lifetime regardless the chase and conquer. these films hint at the greatness bubbling under his surface and go beyond art house as far as substance and sustenance quantify. if I love them, you'll probably like them. be more, try them. go way beyond today's digital so ""30 seconds ago"" when timeless moments could happen, leaving you in awe and breathless. unconcerned with whom knew what, when, or if ever.",1338595200,4,1193,5.086734693877551
2544105,5,B000EXHTFC,"As previous reviewers have noted, this earlier Bergman film may not be as famous & acclaimed as his later masterpieces, but it certainly deserves to be better known. While deceptively simple on the surface, telling of the wonder & joy of first love, and then its sudden & tragic ending, it touches on quite a few deeper matters as well. The question of faith, belief & meaning (or their absence) -- the casual cruelties of the self-involved -- the poisoning of a vulnerable person's life by a jaded predator -- the place of art & artifice in a confused world -- all this & more is explored here.

But what really stands out for me is the exquisite tenderness of the romance between Marie & Henrik. Bergman is famous for delving into the depths of the human soul, especially its darker places -- the vile Uncle Erland is evidence of that -- but there's a sweetness, a playfulness, that really does capture the essence of first falling in love & discovering the consuming intimacy of giving both your heart & your body entirely to another. There's even a final grace note of healing & hope that comes from remembering & integrating what was once too painful to endure in the past.

An absolutely essential Bergman film? Perhaps not ... but a beautiful & moving one that will reward many repeated viewings, I think. Highly recommended!",1338595200,,1332,4.663829787234042

Bergman conjures up summer scenes on boats and rocky shores,clouds crossing the sun,sun glinting on water,running water,leaves blowing,accompanied by a montage of rich sounds:running water,birds whistling, steam boats chugging,days of fishing and swimming. Everything is framed by Marie's life as a ballerina with rehearsals, theatre backdrops,make up and mirrors and also her uncle who is lecherous and plying her with gifts and flattery, who would like to elope with her.

After Henrik's tragic accident she is left feeling life has no meaning,she feels like a'painted marionnette' when she cries the `paint runs'.Maj Britt-Nilsson as Marie gives a stunning performance as she confesses her sense of chilling freedom to a man in clown make-up.

Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0

Better translated as ""Summerplay"" or ""Summer Games,"" Bergman's 1951 offering is considered the iconic Swedish director's first ""mature"" work. Bergman also was quoted on more than one occasion that this particular film was the first in which his ""independent"" voice was heard.

Like Summer with Monika, which appeared two years later, Summer Interlude focuses on the relationship between a young couple spending their summer in the Stockholm archipelago. Despite a dark plot twist, Summer Interlude ends up on an optimistic note, in contrast to ""Monika,"" which highlights the pessimism of a relationship gone sour.

Bergman's protagonist is Marie (Maj-Britt Nillson), an emotionally cut- off, 28 year old ballet dancer, about to perform in a final dress rehearsal of Swan Lake. Marie's ""ordinary world"" is the backstage at the theater where she works. Although it takes a while to get to the ""inciting incident"" where the story gets going, we're content to observe all the backstage machinations, as Bergman's true-life experience in the theater is proffered in high relief.

While the dress rehearsal is delayed due to a technical glitch, Marie receives a package containing the long-lost diary of her college-aged lover, Henrik, whom she had an intense relationship when she was 15 years old; this propels her to take a ferryboat to the archipelago where the two young lovers began an ill-fated relationship marred by a horrible tragedy.

We flashback to those halcyon days of youth with Nillson transforming herself into a carefree, fledgling ballet student. She's staying with two friends of her deceased mother, whom she refers to as her Aunt Elisabeth and Uncle Erland. The ""Uncle"" proves to be a lascivious character, making it clear that he has designs on the teenager, despite the complete inappropriateness of the situation. Marie innocently dismisses Erland's behavior and nothing comes of it until much later.

The bulk of the story concerns Marie's relationship with Henrik. Bergman's portrait of Marie, a mercurial waif of sorts but also completely devoted to her ballet craft, is the best part of the film. One of the highlights of their interaction is a completely original comic animated depiction of the relationship that appears on a record label of all places!

Henrik is less developed as a multi-dimensional characterhe's a brooding fellow who is perhaps on the verge of overcoming his fears about getting out into the world. That's all cut short when Henrik is killed when he mistakenly dives over a cliff into shallow water.

Marie is so devastated that she blurts out that she doesn't believe God exists and will hate him until the day she dies. Flash forward to the present and Marie meets up with Uncle Erland who admits that it was he who sent her Henrik's diary. It was Erland who urged her to cut herself off from her emotions at the time of the accident (wouldn't Erland have been a bit more subtle in his exhortations for Marie to bottle herself up as he was engaging in the not so subtle act of seducing her?). Nonetheless, in the present, Marie now makes it clear that she despises Erland for how he took advantage of her.

Summer Interlude ends with an uncharacteristic ""happy ending."" The woman who cursed God thirteen years earlier and endures the ballet master's cogent analysis of her current situation of emotional paralysis, suddenly does a 180 degree, allows her current boyfriend David to read Henrik's diary and then the next day kisses him, before throwing herself optimistically into to the now live performance of Swan Lake.

The abrupt transition between the wounded teenager turned adult and optimistic professional dancer, doesn't quite ring true. Nonetheless, all the hints of Bergman's masterpieces soon to come, are there in Summer Interlude; especially the masterful cinematography of Gunnar Fischer, one of Bergman's long-time collaborators. Summer Interlude is worth watching in its own right as there are still many elements indicative of a true master film director at work.",1471392000,,4097,5.118263473053892

8115494,5,B000EXHTFC,"They've been showing a huge number of Bergman films on Film4 on British TV. So, rather than buy a load of his movies, I have been taping them so I can watch them at my leisure, as I suspect many people are. I first got into Bergman not that long ago, when I watched 'Wild Strawberries' which I enjoyed immensely and which I eventually bought off Amazon. Both 'Summer Interlude' and 'Wild Strawberries' could be said to be similar in that they are a little whimsical in their outlook and also involving lost love, or lost something, without being drenched in angst or misery, which neither of them are. Both films are also probably amongst Bergman's most accessible films, and easy to watch and enjoy.

There is a sense, in both 'Wild Strawberries' and certainly in 'Summer Interlude' of loss and lost happiness, and a yearning for nostalgic moments that will never come again. But, along with the sense of loss and even sadness, is a sense of something life-affirming and even of hope too. The film does not drown in sentimentality or even pity, and in its own way is fairly upbeat and even light-hearted.

This film is over 60 years old now, but it has a refreshing quality about it, and a freshness that doesn't, for my money, date it; in fact, it has a timeless quality. The story is one of a long past love, and a romance which has ended in tragedy. And the main character, Marie, is reflecting back on this summer love she had long ago, whilst in her present day career as a ballet dancer. As I said, the film isn't really maudlin or overly-sentimental, but manages to portray honestly the bitter-sweet feelings and memories Marie has.

Bergman was a cinematic genius, and yet to some, he can seem miserablist, and even pretentious. I don't find this at all, even though I don't like every film he made. He was trying, I think, to convey in his films feelings and emotions that all humans have, which can't fully be put into words or adequately understood or explained. And, sometimes, this might not translate very well in a film. I think that whatever Bergman did though, he tried very much to remain true to his muse, which means of course that Bergman has many millions of fans far beyond the shores of Sweden.
