8558502,5,B00AWPRC4K,wonderful walking dvd and getting something to see of Ireland. AAA+++++,1415836800,,71,5.545454545454546
8558503,1,B00AWPRC4K,"If I had not been to Ireland before this would surely discourage me from going. Galway has beautiful greenery and old stately houses but you
would never know that from this dvd. It seems like the people that made this were trying to film the ugliest most boring parts of Galway and
Limerick. Basically it is just one long walk past shops. Even an avid shopper would be put off by this dvd because they don't even slow down to glance in the shop windows. I realize that it is to be  used for exercise , as if you are walking, but most people take walks in appealing places and they look at the scenery around them not just the road.",1409184000,2,631,4.214876033057851
