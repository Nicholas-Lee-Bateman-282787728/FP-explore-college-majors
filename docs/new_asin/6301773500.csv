367259,3,6301773500,"Once upon a time the local movie theatres actually placed sizable print ads in small town newspapers--and I well remember this one, which showed a paper-wrapped head tied up with twine. I desperately wanted to see the film, but I was eleven and it was deemed unsuitable for one of such tender years. Even so, the ad made such an impression upon me that forty years later, when the movie at last came my way on DVD, I couldn't resist.

Amicus was an English production company that specialized in horror films--particularly in ""anthology"" horror films, in which a framing device allows several stories to be told. Among the first such Amicus films was THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD; among the final was ASYLUM. In the latter, a young psychiatrist (Robert Powell) interviews for a position at an asylum for in the incurably insane. The director (Patrick Magee) informs him that the previous director is now a patient, and if the young doctor can spot him among the other patients, the job is his. The young doctor goes upstairs, where the orderly (Geoffrey Bayldon) conducts him to interview four patients. Each tells a story--and each story is based on one by pulp writer Robert Bloch, author of the novel PSYCHO.

The first is ""Frozen Fear,"" and it is probably the best recalled of the four stories because it gave rise to the motif of the packaged head. In this tale, Walter (Richard Todd) and his lover Bonnie (Barbara Parkins) plot to murder Walter's wife Ruth (Sylvia Syms) by chopping her up and tucking the neatly wrapped parts into a basement freezer. Unfortunately for Walter and Bonnie, Ruth has recently become interested in an African religion and wears a charm to protect her from evil. Although the story is a little obvious, and the special effects are often quite silly, all three actors put it over extremely well. The second story is ""The Weird Tailor,"" about a down-on-his luck tailor (Barry Morse) who agrees to make an expensive suit for a mysterious client (Peter Cushing.) The fabric is unusual, and when the tailor learns the purpose of the suit he returns with it to his shop--only to have his wife (Anne Firbank) precipitate disaster when she puts it on a shop window dummy. Morse and particularly Cushing are extremely good here, but like ""Frozen Fear"" it is a bit too predictable.

The third story, ""Lucy Comes to Stay,"" is the best, for unlike the others it does not rely on anything supernatural and is entirely plausible on its own terms. Barbara (Charlotte Rampling) has been hospitalized with an unspecified illness for quite some time, and when she returns home she is made anxious by the fact that her brother George (James Villiers) has hired a nurse (Megs Jenkins) to look after her. In short order Barbara has found a stash of pills she hid before she went into the hospital--and is then surprised when her friend Lucy (Britt Ekland) appears, laughing about George's attempts to keep her out. Together Barbara and Lucy plan a way for Barbara to escape, but it soon transpires that neither Barbara nor Lucy are entirely what they appear. Much of this story's power comes from Charlotte Rampling, a truly extraordinary actress, who is able to put over the pill-popping, anxiety-ridden Barbara in a big way. The last story is ""Mannikins of Horror"" and is about Dr. Byron (Herbert Lom), who claims to have created dolls into which he can transfer his own existence--but by this time the young psychiatrist has had enough. He returns to the director in outrage, only to see Byron's story play out before his own eyes in the director's office. When he responds to the emergency, he falls into the trap of the former director, who has not been able to identify after all.

Now, truth is that by today's standards ASYLUM isn't anything much. At times the stories are mildly creepy, and there are indeed one or two jump-in-your-seat moments, but the whole thing is actually more akin to an extended NIGHT GALLERY episode than anything else. But it is a fun sort of thing, and the cast is truly and unexpectedly distinguished. Where else will you find Barbara Parkins, Peter Cushing, Charlotte Rampling, Britt Ekland, and Herbert Lom all in the same film? The DVD has a few entertaining extras, including an interview with director Roy Ward Baker and a somewhat less interesting audio commentary with Baker and others. The film elements are remarkably clean, although the score (most of it derrived from ""Night on Bald Mountain"") is a bit too loud now and then. All the same: good fun for those who are into English horror flicks of the period.

367263,4,6301773500,"A popular movie format in the 1970's was to compile short stories into a full length film by tying the shorts together with an overarching plot. In the case of Asylum, the overarching plot involves young Dr. Martin, who is applying for a job at a sanitarium run by Dr. Starr. However, when he arrives, Dr. Rutherford [Patrick Magee] is in charge; Dr. Starr has gone mad, adopted a completely new personality and life history. After an act of violence against Dr. Rutherford, the staff had no choice but to put Dr. Starr on the locked ward of the asylum. To get the job, Dr. Martin must determine which of the patients he will meet is the real Dr. Starr. But it won't be easy; each of the patients he meets has a strange tale to tell, and any could be Dr. Starr in his (or her) new, maniacal role.

Dr. Martin is presented with 4 patients, each who has a very strange tale to tell. The stories are enhanced by excellent makeup and special effects that create a truly creepy feel in each episode. And unlike some anthologies, where the overarching story is just a throwaway excuse for showing a bunch of short films, the plot arc here lends coherency and gives the movie an extra dimension.

Asylum is a must-see for anyone who has enjoyed 70's anthology horror.",1298332800,,1260,4.473913043478261

367277,5,6301773500,"This review is for the Dark Sky Films release:

  ""Asylum"" is an awesome anthology based on a collection of short stories written by Robert Bloch, author of ""Psycho"" - the granddaddy of all slasher films.  Like Norman Bates of ""Psycho,"" most of the characters in ""Asylum"" are psychotic; in fact, they are residents of an insane asylum.  Four patients each have a ghastly story to tell about how they became residents.

  Amicus Productions is famous for releasing horror anthologies and ""Asylum"" is considered by many fans to be one of their best.  Why?  It boasts a top notch cast of horror stars led by Peter Cushing (who portrayed Dr. Victor Frankenstein and Dr. Van Helsing in numerous Hammer Productions), Britt Ekland (""The Whicker Man,"" ""The Monster Club,"" and ""What the Peeper Saw"") and Patrick Magee (""Demons of the Mind,"" ""Dementia 13,"" and ""The Black Cat"").  Each story is truly frightening and involves inanimate objects that come to life such as severed limbs and tiny dolls.  There is always the thin line separating reality from fantasy.  (Is the homicidal playmate real or imaginary?  Which one of the patients is actually a doctor who suffered a mental breakdown?)  This film, which boasts beautiful sets and a great musical score, has some shocking twists and turns, especially at the end when we learn the true identity of Dr. Starr.

  ""House of Crazies"" is an alternate title and, I must say, a more appropriate one.  However, ""Asylum"" has a more ominous, chilling ring.  Whatever its title, I highly recommend buying it for anyone who collects horror films made by Amicus Productions or is a big fan of Peter Cushing or loves seventies horror.  I happen to be a fan of all three.

  The DVD presentation from Dark Sky Films is very professional.  ""Asylum"" is presented in its theatrical release aspect ratio of 1.85:1, the video and audio are pristine, and there are English subtitles for those of us who are having difficulty hearing in our old age.  There is also a collectible booklet of interesting liner notes inside the DVD keep case.  However, let me warn you not to watch the ""Inside the Fear Factory"" feature unless you have already seen ""The Beast Must Die"" and ""Now the Screaming Starts.""  There are film clips from these features that may ruin them for you.",1232236800,,2291,4.820051413881748

This film is fun and from a good era for horror films.  The film could have been longer with a few more stories, but, hey, what can you do?  The script is done by horror writer Robert Bloch, so it's certainly a must if you're a fan of his.  It's his style through and through.  Very much in the way Creepshow was a total Stephen King showcase.  Those familiar with horror films will have the twists and such figured out almost immediately, but what is surprising anymore, eh?  It's still well done.  A pretty cool cast is assembled here as well, which is certainly a who is who of British horror.  The twenty minute featurette is the only thing here of real significance as far as features go.  Amicus cofounder Max Rosenberg(who looks like he's about 110), Amicus(and Hammer) directors Freddie Francis and Roy Ward Baker are interviewed to talk a bit about working for Amicus.  Pretty cool considering I've never seen Francis or Baker before.  The Asylum probably won't win over alot of new fans and may not seem as original today as it did then, but it is a fun ride which is all we really ask of a horror film.",1163894400,,1282,4.446351931330472
367281,5,6301773500,"Wow, this movie was fun. I never saw it before and, because I've been on a big Hammer and Amicus kick lately, took a chance on it. I was not disappointed.

Like other Amicus productions, what we get here are several horror stories in one, all centered on ""incurably insane"" patients in a British asylum. There are some great stars here that make it work oh so well, including Patrick Magee (A Clockwork Orange), Robert Powell (Tommy, Jesus of Nazareth), Herbert Lom (Phantom of the Opera-1962), Peter Cushing (Do I need name all of his great horror films?), Richard Todd (Stage Fright)Barry Morse (Gerard from the 1960s TV series classic The Fugitive), Geoffrey Bayldon (The House That Dripped Blood), the scrumptious Britt Ekland (The Wicker Man-1973), beautiful Charlotte Rampling (The Fury), and lovely Bonnie Parkins (The Mephisto Waltz).

The transfer from Dark Sky Films is fantastic; it looks like a brand new film. It's presented in anamorphic widescreen and looks great when played in a progressive scan DVD player on a HD television.

Looking forward to the upcoming release of ""From Beyond the Grave"" from Image. Never saw that one before, either, but am looking forward to buying it just the same.

I'm hopeful other Amicus classics, including ""Dr. Terror's House of Horrors,"" ""Tales from the Crypt (1972),"" and ""Vault of Horror"" will be released on DVD soon. There are rumors abound that Vault and Tales will soon be released by 20th Century Fox in England, but that won't help those of us living in the states much. Dr. Terror was released in England on DVD, but never in the U.S. There is a demand for these films here. Let's get with it, whoever owns the rights.",1162944000,,1678,4.83623693379791

367314,4,6301773500,"This is one of a series of horror anthology movies released by Amicus Studios in the early 70's.  (i.e. ""Tales From the Crypt"", ""The House That Dripped Blood"", ""Vault of Horror"").Each anthology is held together by a certain theme.

In ""Asylum"" a young psychiatrist interviewing for a job in an asylum is told that the head of the asylum has gone crazy and is now a patient.  The young psychiatrist must hear the stories of some of the patients and then determine who was the head of the Asylum.  If he is correct, he gets the job.

The stories give the feel of old horror comics, which inspired many horror anthologies. The characters are one-dimensional and driven by such deadly sins, as greed and lust. In most cases,  with a twist and a touch of macabre, the fates get their revenge on the evil-doers.

The stories are mostly enjoyable and solid entries in the horror anthology genre. The British countryside, where the stories are mostly set, adds an extra chill.

The movie is recommended most to fans of horror anthologies, such as HBO's ""Tales From the Crypt"" or Stephen King's ""Creepshow"", and the movies noted earlier.  It would also be great for those who remember how much fun these movies were when they first came out.

More general audiences would be entertained, but I don't think this movie should be ranked with 5-Star horror masterpieces (""The Exorcist"", ""Halloween"", ""Psycho""), nor would I expect most general audiences to rank it so highly.

The DVD quality is definitely noteworthy, having sharp, rich colors which enhanced the movie's experience.",1156377600,,1569,4.860902255639098
367315,5,6301773500,"I just finished watching Amicus Productions' ""Asylum"" and was thoroughly entertained throughout!  This collection of macabre tales is imaginative, intelligent and contain some genuine thrills!  As the trailer for the film advertised, ""come to the asylum..."" we have a young doctor arriving to take the head position of the psychiatric department.  That is, if he can first identify the former doctor, who is now a mental patient of the asylum and is now residing upstairs with the other ""incurably insane.""  We meet each of the patients one by one as they reveal how they became patients of the asylum.

(1) British actor, Richard Todd (Disney's ""The Story of Robin Hood"" and ""The Sword & The Rose"") stars in the first story revealing a murder with a dash of voodoo mixed in for some truly chilling results, you'll never look in your deep freezer again, without remembering this horrific scene!

(2) The second story gives a new meaning to ""owning a good suit.""  Peter Cushing hires a tailor to make him a new suit for his son.  The material Cushing brings is ""special"" and even glows!  Wait till you see Cushing's son, and then how the suit effects the tailor's store mannequin!

(3) The lovely Britt Ekland stars as the friend of a wealthy young girl, who is on the edge of insanity.  Is Britt real or a figment of the girl's pill induced imagination?

(4) The fourth and final of the tales, involves the great Herbert Lom (Hammer's ""Phantom of the Opera"" and as Chief Inspector Drefus of ""The Pink Panther"" films).  Lom's character is a psychotic genius, which has invented several doll-like robots that not only can do his bidding, but the robot becomes the actual person it is created to resemble.  This one is the best of the tales and rounds up the collection with a good solid finale.

Also available in the Amicus Collection is ""And Now the Screaming Starts"" and ""The Beast Must Die,"" both starring Peter Cushing and a must have for any Hammer Studios horror fan or collector!  I hope Dark Sky Films will continue with more titles in their ""Amicus Collection,"" for these are just a few of the fine films that were produced from this Hammer Studio rival.",1154304000,,2162,4.710106382978723

367317,5,6301773500,"Long out of circulation (except in an inferior bad transfer and print) ""Asylum"" finally reappears on DVD. One of Amicus' finest efforts is told anthology style much like ""Tales from the Crypt"" and ""The House That Dripped Blood"" from a screenplay by Robert Bloch (the novel Psycho among many other genre offerings)most fans of the film know the story but I'll briefly recap it here after I mention the new stuff on the DVD.

For this edition from Dark Sky Films has struck a new print from the 35mm negative, transfered it in high definition and presents it in an anamorphic widescreen presentation. The extras include a commentary track by director Roy Ward Baker and Director of Photography Neil Binney, biographies for Baker, Cushing, Lom, Britt Ekland and producers Milton Subotsky & Max J. Rosenberg. There's also a featurette on Amicus entitled ""Inside the Fear Factory"" as well as liner notes and a still gallery. The only thing I could have asked for that isn't included is a appreciation in the form of a featurette for some of the deceased stars such as Peter Cushing.

Dr. Martin (Robert Powell) arrives at Dunsmoor a hospital for the mentally ill. Martin is challenged by the director of the hosptial Dr. Rutherford (Patrick Magee) to prove his mettle as a doctor; Martin must figure out who of the recently admitted inmates is Dr. Starr the former director of the hospital who's gone insane. Martin listens to the stories of different inmates (played by Barbara Parkins,Charlotte Rampling and Herbert Lom)and tries to determine which of them was the former director. Each has a bizarre story to tell from a reanimated dismembered corpse, suits that bring the dead to life to hand made little ""people"" that their maker can ""will"" himself into. Curiously Robert Bloch is credited as Robert Black on the box. Considering all the care that went into the re-release I'm surprised this happened. Also featuring Peter Cushing, Barry Morse and Charlotte Rampling ""Asylum"" is the gem in the Amicus crown.

The featurette features Max Rosenberg discussing the formation of Amicus and how the first couple of films came to be. For example Rosenberg discusses how he and Milton Subotsky became involved in Hammer's first successful horror production ""Curse of Frankenstein"". Freddie Francis also appears discussing how he got into direction, working with Peter Cushing and his work for the duo.

 The previous edition has been out of print for far too long. It looks as if the plentiful extras and usual care that MPI takes with their releases is here as well. It's taken a while for this gem to become available again but I'm happy it has finally come ""back to life"". This creepy horror thriller scared the heck out of me as a kid and while some of the edge may have been dulled by the more explicit horror films out there for younger horror fans the subtle direction and storytelling has kept this film vital and makes this film an essential horror thriller to pick up on DVD.",1145491200,,2978,4.842829076620825
367318,4,6301773500,"This, while somewhat clever in it's climax, is not a film of too much complexity. The plot is quite simple:
Dr. Martin arrives at the small asylum where he plans to begin his psychiatric work. His qualifications may be impressive, but all the interviewer insists he do to get the job is decide which one of the patients is the previous Dr. Starr. Here, the madness begins. Along with Dr. Martin and his tour guide Max, you hear the four patients tell their stories (don't worry, they don't verbally narrate it all the way through -- it's acted out). A woman who has witnessed a dismembered body come back for revenge, a man whose suit gave life to a dummy, a girl with a bad side named Lucy, and a man who wills his soul into his home-made robots make up these stories that cover the majority of the film. After he's heard the stories, Dr. Martin insists that the rules of his employment are absurd and does not want to guess which patient is the former doctor. But shortly after, whether he likes it or not, he discovers who the mysertious Dr. Starr is, and all hell breaks loose.

The Asylum is quite a satisfying treat of a film. The ending is truly unpredictable (for most people, anyway), and a decently creepy collection of madness and murder makes it worth viewing again and again. Certainly worth the money.",1121644800,,1315,4.502092050209205

It looks from all accounts to be a terrific release with a new anamorphic transfer and some terrific extras including a featurette and commentary track. This new release is from Darky Sky Films which also re-released ""Magic"" and some other Amicus gems as well!

Secondly, avoid purchasing the release by Passion Productions. The video quality is inferior (taken from an old videotape of the film)and I had problems BIG problems playing this version. If you can get a hold of the Image Entertainment Release it would probably be the way to go as it is a Region 1 and was licensed from the company that held the copyright to the film. Having seen (but I don't own unfortunately)the Image release, I can say that it is hands down one of the better versions of this film on DVD.

From what I can tell, there's a problem with the authoring on the DVD which makes it incompatible with many DVD players (although not DVD-ROMs). The result is a mess to view with bits and pieces from one from to the next sampled over each other. Perhaps it's a problem with the actual transfer (although if that was the case, it would be a problem for ALL players) either way, the Passion Productions release is inferior and shouldn't be purchased. The Passion Productions version has a picture of Peter Cushing on the cover while the Image release has a variation on the original theatrical poster for the film used for the cover art.",1118793600,,1549,4.608695652173913

He tells Powell's character that he can have the job if he can figure out which one of four current patients was once the doctor he is to replace. So, each patient tells their own hellish tale of evil and insanity. The first is a woman who tells of her conspiracy with her boyfriend, resulting in the dismemberment of his wife. Unfortunately, wifey just doesn't seem to want to co-operate! Next, a man tells of his former life as a tailor. A strange man (Peter Cushing) comes to him for a suit for his son. He's brought his own special, luminescent material and a set of bizarre instructions. The finished suit has powers that defy nature and bring only doom! The poor tailor is reduced to a shell of a man. Then, the third patient, another woman, talks about her friend Lucy (Britt Ekland), who makes her do bad things, even murder! Lastly, Herbert Lom (The Lady Killers) is a patient with a plan. He has been constructing a small army of dolls that he believes he can enter and control with his mind.

367334,3,6301773500,"This horror movie has very British sensitibilities, and you couldn't ask for a better, more entertaining introduction to the type of horror movie that was popular in the 1970s, before the era of the slasher film.  It's stylish and very proper, making the gore that much more shocking.
Basically, we've got a handful of ""short stories"" very loosely pulled together with the framing device of a psychologist visiting the asylum being asked to ""figure out"" which of the patients was actually the former director of the hospital.  There's very little to this part of the plot, but the various stories the patients have to tell do create varying degrees of chills.
None of the stories are great, nor are they especially surprising, but they are told quite nicely and are better acted than such low-budget stuff has a right to be.  Some outstanding actors such as Herbert Lom and Charlotte Rampling are featured, along with a brief but creepy turn by Peter Cushing (who, along with Christoper Lee, owned this genre of horror movie).
In many ways the film is a period piece, not so much about an era of history, but about an era of film history.  It distills the style and sensibilities of the Hammer films (so called because they were made in England's Hammer Studio) into one neat, entertaining package.  Will this be your favorite movie ever?  Nope.  But is it an amusing diversion and a wonderful slice of what was once the height of horror film making?  You bet.

367335,5,6301773500,"As one who has often panned for gold in the stream of little-known horror delights, I have discovered much more fool's gold than gold dust, but Asylum is a magnificent gold nugget.  Produced by Amicus, the British equivalent of Hammer Studios, this classic film features a remarkable cast bringing to life a compelling, delightfully shocking tale which comes straight from the pen of none other than Robert Bloch.  I think the whole idea of the movie is brilliant, especially the way everything is put together, meshing four largely unrelated tales into one overall and amazingly successful story.  We begin with Dr. Martin's arrival at the asylum in pursuit of a position.  He is surprised to learn that Dr. Styles, the asylum director and the man he expected to speak with about the job, is now one of the incurably insane inmates housed upstairs.  Dr. Rutherford is willing to hire Dr. Martin, but only if he passes a certain test.  There are four inmates upstairs, and he must determine which one is actually Dr. Styles (who has assumed a brand new identity for himself).  As Dr. Martin makes the rounds, accompanied by the doctor posted upstairs, we are presented with each individual's story as to how they came to be institutionalized.
The first story, that of Bonnie, is a wholly remarkable one.  Her lover, having finally agreed to kill his divorce-denying wife and run off with her, chops his wife into several pieces and stows everything in the freezer, including her voodoo-ish protective bracelet He is quite shocked shortly thereafter to see the head, wrapped in butcher's paper, roll into view upstairs, and he is even more surprised by what happens next.  When Bonnie arrives, she finds herself menaced and attacked by the separate body parts of the seemingly undead murdered woman.  Next we have the story of Bruno the tailor.  Facing economic ruin, he is offered two hundred pounds to make a suit for a rather strange gentleman named Mr. Smith (played magnificently by Peter Cushing).  The suit must be created under the unusual conditions specified by the customer and must be made from the remarkable fabric Smith has provided Bruno.  This metallic, strangely glittering coat is actually an instrument of magic, Bruno finds out upon delivering it.  Supposedly it has the power to give or restore life to whoever wears it.  Cushing's performance helps make this the strongest of the four stories, in my opinion.  Next up is Barbara, who denies having committed the murders that resulted in her institutionalization.  It was her friend Lucy, she says.  The story plays pretty well until the end, when whatever mystery lingered concerning the truth about Lucy is rather unnecessarily done away with.  Finally, we have Dr. Baron, maker of robotic men; actually, he says, the creatures are quite human on the inside, and he claims to have the power to will his own mind into one such creation and essentially make it come alive with his own consciousness.  This tale has its weaknesses, but its effect on Dr. Martin is profound and sets in motion the thrilling conclusion of the movie.  This conclusion, I must say, is remarkably good, treating me to a wonderful surprise and devilishly good twist.
The plot of Asylum does have a weakness or two in it, but the film's overall effect on the viewer is so gripping that minor questions cease to matter very much.  Frankly, I have never seen an anthologized movie such as this succeed so well.  Few movies can combine separate tales and succeed as a unified whole, but Asylum accomplishes this feat quite easily.  This is an intelligent horror movie that fans of the genre can point to with great pride.",1044230400,,3664,4.882067851373183
367336,5,6301773500,"I've had this on DVD for some time now and enjoy watching it when I'm in the mood.  It's an anthology film from the old British Amicus studios with a quartet of horror tales related by four inmates of an asylum to the new doctor on staff. It's also a beautiful print from Image. My favorite is the ""Frozen Fear"" piece with Barbara Parkins as the mistress of a married man who murders his occult obsessed wife, chops her up and stores her in the freezer wrapped in freezer paper. The wife's occult beliefs turn the tables and her body parts reanimate and kill the husband. When Parkins comes by (they were planning to run away together) she is attacked by all the parts shuffling and crawling around on the floor jumping on her as she tries to beat them off. This is very well done and really eerie. The other stories are good too. They include Charlotte Rampling, Britt Ekland and Patrick Mcghee in great performances. The direction by Roy Ward Baker is tight and Robert Bloch contributed the material. This may be OOP but there are still copies in stores. I recommend this for horror buffs and those who remember the horror anthologies from the 70's. Completely enjoyable.",1039824000,,1173,4.585714285714285
367337,4,6301773500,"We were pretty leery of horror films back in the early Seventies in those dark, dreary days before ""Halloween"" ushered in the era of the slasher film ad infinitim.  But the more you heard about ""Asylum"" the more you had to be optimistic.  First, you have Robert ""Psycho"" Bloch as the writer.  Second, it is a British film, and while Amicus Productions did not have the cinematic cachet of Hammer Studios, it is still British, which was always better than being American back then.  Third, you throw in director Roy Ward Baker, who directed one of my all-time favorite horror flicks known as ""Quatermass and the Pit"" over there and ""Five Million Years to Earth"" on this side of the pond.  Fourth, as a corollary to the second point, you have British actors in general and Peter Cushing, Patrick Magee, Barry Morse, Herbert Lom and Robert Powell on the eve of the role of his lifetime in ""Jesus of Nazareth.""  Then we have Britt Eklund, Charlotte Rampling, and Barbara Perkins.  Sold yet?
Oh, you want to know the story Bloch came up with.
Well, Powell plays Dr. Martin, who has arrived at the friendly neighborhood mental institution to see if he can land a job.  ""Asylum"" offers up four bloody little stories of madness and murder told by four inmates.  Yes, it is an ""anthology"" film, but remember all those good points up above and try to think about all the bad anthology films you have seen in your life.  But this is Bloch.  There is a twist.  Dr. Martin gets the post if he can figure out which of the four inmates telling the story is the former head of the asylum: There is Bonnie (Perkins), who was attacked by her lover's dead wife; Bruno (Morse), who makes a magical suit that brings back the dead son of one of his customers (Cushing); Barbara (Rampling/Ekland) a schizophrenic who is being made paranoid by her brother; and Byron (Lom) who puts his consciousness in a killer little doll.  ""Asylum"" stops short of being great, but it is certainly very good.  There are moments of silliness, but the horror elements still win out in the end.

The film is worth watching simply to hear the satanic laughter right at the end of the film. Its truly the most terrifying, insane thing ive ever heard, definately worth a few rewinds!

367339,4,6301773500,"Asylum is of course one of a group of anthology horror films that includes Dr. Terror's House of Horrors, Tales from the Crypt, Vault of Horror, etc., produced by Hammer wannabe Amicus Productions. Never as stylish, daring, or bloody as Hammer's efforts, their movies nevertheless were usually solid, entertaining mystery/horror outings. Half the fun of the Amicus pictures is watching so many terrific veteran English actors going through their paces. Asylum is a perfect example of this, with a great, mostly British cast including Peter Cushing, Herbert Lom, Patrick Magee, Barbara Parkins, Charlotte Rampling, Britt Ekland, and Richard Todd. I remember seeing the trailer for this (with the dismembered body parts) back in the early 70s at the theater and the audience went nuts. Unfortunately, decades of gore/slasher movies have lessened the impact of movies like this (see comments of other reviewers), whose horrors are more subtle, though still effective. I found it fairly absorbing and ultimately satisfying on recent viewing. Minor complaints: The film is a bit uneven, with a couple of standout episodes (the first and last) bracketing a couple of less effective, if serviceable pieces. (Anyone who's seen Robert Bloch's original 'tailor's dummy' episode of the Thriller TV series will wish the remake here was done as well.) I also would've saved the first (most blatantly horrific) story for last (somehow), and my wife did guess the ""twist"" ending fairly quickly. But overall still quite original; creepy at times, shocking at others, delicious fun throughout.
Sadly, Image's DVD is rather standard fare, with nary an extra in sight. The film is presented full frame 1.33:1, though it appears to have been shot this way (according to IMDb and by the way the titles and compositions are framed). The source print looks like a typical (16mm?) TV print with mediocre color fidelity, slight softness, and light to moderate speckling throughout. It's not really bad but not really great either, and put to shame by numerous other Image and Anchor Bay releases of similar type movies (see Anchor's recent stupendous Circus of Horrors disc). Fans of the film will probably buy this anyway (I did) since it's a huge gamble that it'll ever be released in a better version in the foreseeable future, but it's hard to recommend purchase to the uninitiated at this price, especially considering the mediocre quality of the source print and lack of extras. The movie gets four stars; the DVD is a solid three.",1005868800,,2512,5.1292682926829265
367340,4,6301773500,"From the mid 1960s and well into the 1970s, producers Max Rosenberg and Milton Subotsky released a slew of successful horror anthologies through an English studio called Amicus (The Studio That Dripped Blood), including this little nugget of joy titled Asylum (1972). Written by Robert Bloch (Psycho) and directed by Roy Ward Baker (Quatermass and the Pit, The Vampire Lovers), the film features a number of notable actors including Peter Cushing (Dracula), Herbert Lom (The Return of the Pink Panther), Patrick Magee (A Clockwork Orange), Britt Ekland (The Wicker Man), Charlotte Rampling (Zardoz), Barry Morse (""Space: 1999""), Barbara Parkins (Shout at the Devil), Robert Powell (The Asphyx), and Geoffrey Bayldon (Casino Royale), to name a few...

As the film begins we see a man traveling by car to what looks to be a stately manor in the English countryside. Turns out the man is one Dr. Martin (Powell), and the stately English manor is actually a nutter house for the criminally insane. Seems Martin has recently secured a position at the asylum, and is set to meet his new boss, a Dr. B. Starr, who runs the joint. On arriving, Martin is informed by another doctor named Rutherford (Magee) that Dr. Starr's had a bit of a breakdown, and is now a patient in the very institution he once ran. Rutherford, not being entirely satisfied with Martin's abilities, puts him to a test to interview four patients (which relates into a story involving each patient), and if he can guess which one Dr. Starr is, Rutherford will agree to take Martin on...the first tale is titled The Frozen Fear and involves infidelity, greed, and murder as man and his mistress make plans to do away with the man's wife (she controls the purse strings). The man makes short work of his wife by giving her the ax (literally), but her discombobulated parts seem to have a life, and mind, of their own. The second tale is titled The Weird Tailor and features Barry Morse as a tailor who's fallen on hard times, but finds hope in the form of a customer, played by Peter Cushing, who presents him with a proposition to make a suit (which ends up looking like a fancy Nerhu jacket) out of an extremely odd, shimmering material. The man also has specific instructions with regards to the assembly of the suit, the main one being the tailor can only work on the garment from between midnight until dawn...hmmm...sounds hinky to me. The third story is titled Lucy Comes to Stay and features Charlotte Rampling as a disturbed woman returning home from an extended stay in the hospital. Upon arriving home, she chaffs under the strict regime prescribed by her doctor, but her friend Lucy (Ekland) soon shows up, giving new meaning to the phrase `bad influence'. The fourth and final tale is a minor one titled Mannikins of Horror, and features Herbert Lom as a once prominent neurosurgeon and orthopedic specialist who now spends his days making little android like toys, believing that through sheer will he can make them come alive.

One thing that impressed me most about this anthology was the amount of attention given to the linking story, or the wraparound. Normally in an anthology like this, the wraparound is the most spindly aspect, as its only purpose is a transitional device intended to string the main tales together, but here it's actually a pretty decent piece, one that develops into a nice little twist ending to cap off the film. As far as the various tales, I enjoyed them, but I thought The Weird Tailor the weakest. It had Cushing in it, which was a definite plus, but Morse, whom I like, just seemed miserably miscast for his part, and I had a difficult time sitting through his overly ethnic rendition of a schlubby, immigrant tailor struggling to make ends meet. The casting in this piece may have been a little off, but the atmosphere was dead on, offering up some severely creepy vibes, especially once we enter Cushing's character's home as the tailor seeks to collect that which he is owed. Overall it was probably the least shocking of the bunch, along with also being the longest. As far as the other stories, they're all efficient and paced quickly, wasting little time on unnecessary junk, providing some mild to strong shock endings. Perhaps the best shock comes near the end, during the conclusion of the wraparound tale, as Dr. Martin is pressed to make his choice towards the identity of Dr. Starr. I admit I wasn't overly surprised by the revelation, but it was handled well and was quite a bit of fun. I'd say Cushing's performance stood out the most, but then I'm completely biased as he's one of my favorite actors. As far as the others, they were about equal, although Lom did seem to stand out a bit, despite his relatively minor role. Ekland was odd performer out, as her only talent seemed to be looking good, which never really translated over into her acting abilities (of which she didn't have much of). In general, the performances from a mainly talented and experienced cast were solid, the direction very strong, and the production entirely agreeable. Some of the special effects in this feature will seem shoddy and quaint, as perhaps was even the case the time the film was released, but this didn't bother me as the strengths in this feature more than made up for the perceived flaws. Asylum isn't the best Amicus horror anthology (many say 1973's From Beyond the Grave earns that title), but it is one of the better ones (in the top three), and certainly worth your time if you have an interest in the genre.

This DVD release from Dark Sky Films includes an exceptionally sharp and good-looking anamorphic widescreen (1.77:1) print, along with a decent audio track presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 mono.  Extras include an audio commentary track with director Roy Ward Baker and camera operator Neil Binney, along with a twenty minute featurette titled `Inside the Fear Factory', liner notes by Christopher Gullo, biographies, a still gallery, English subtitles, and a theatrical trailer for this film along with one for The Beast Must Die (1974) and And Now the Screaming Starts (1973), all three originally released by Amicus Productions and all three recently re-released onto DVD by Dark Sky Films (they were originally released onto DVD by Image Entertainment).

367342,5,6301773500,"This film describes 4 stories told to psychologist Robert Powell by patients at a remote English countryside house. Powell is invited to be interviewed as house doctor by psychologist Patrick Magee, who promises  Powell that he will get the job if he can recognise which one of the 4  patients is the former Dr B Starr, who was previously the house's chief  psychologist but now a patient himself/herself. Powell meets Reynolds  (played by Geoffrey Baldyon) who looks after the patients. The first story  describes a woman, Barbara Parkins, who became crazy after she discovered  both the dead remains of a woman whose husband Parkins was to be married  and the dead husband himself. He killed his voodoo-trained wife and cut her  into small pieces, but she later killed him. The second story describes  Barry Morse as a tailor who needs money to pay his rent and makes a suit  for Peter Cushing's dead son, hoping to be paid well. After the suit is  made, Cushing tells Morse that he has no money and demands the suit. Morse  kills Cushing with a gun and uses the suit to bring Cushing's son alive.  His son kills Morse's wife, and Morse becomes made. The third story  describes Charlotte Rampling having an imaginary friend, Britt Ekland, who  kills and makes Rampling the murderer. The last story describes Herbert Lom  as a scientist who makes toy mannekins and wills his soul into one of them.  Powell leaves to tell Magee he is not interested in working at the house,  and Magee is killed by a knife from a toy mannekin. Powell crushes the  mannekin with his foot, and finds human remains in the toy. Lom screams,  and Powell sees Reynolds, who tells Powell that Lom's body was crushed.  Powell tells Reynolds that Lom was Dr B Starr and goes to Reynolds' office  to telephone the police. Reynolds tries to stop him but Powell discovers a  dead body in his office, whom Reynolds tells him to be the real Reynolds.  The fake Reynolds is actually Dr B Starr, who strangles Powell to death.

In this case, four stories are slapped together through the device of interviews.  A doctor (Robert Powell) arrives at an asylum hoping for a job.  He has progressive ideas.  He doesnt think anyone is beyond redemption.  The current director (Patrick Magee) of the place is of another mind.  He insists that the patients here are incurably insane.  And whats more, he offers the young doctor a challenge.  One of the loonies is the head of the asylum.  Pick which one and the job is yours.  The four stories that follow are supposedly clues to the identity of the former director.  They arent, but thats the suggestion put forth.

The movie is also available in two different DVD versions, neither of which I have seen. Of these, however, the 2006 Dark Sky DVD is clearly superior. It contains several extra features including an audio commentary by director Roy Ward Baker, who died shortly afterwards.

Some 40 years ago, I saw a low budget British horror film called ""Asylum,"" which actually had a run in mainstream theaters. More recently, I read an unrelated horror novel of the same name, and that got me to thinking about the older movie. When I saw that it was available free on Amazon Prime, I decided to watch it again, wondering whether it would still hold up today. To my delight, for the most part it did.

At the time I saw ""Asylum"" theatrically, the British studio Amicus Productions was trying to rival the better known Hammer Films with a series of clever horror anthologies. These movies typically combined three to five short pieces that were all part of a larger story arc that came together at the end. The budgets (and consequently the special effects) were small, but the talent was often surprisingly good. ""Asylum"" stands out by having possibly the best ensemble cast of any of these anthologies.

The movie is set at a secluded mental institute where a new doctor arrives. His predecessor was driven mad by the stress of the job and has been committed. If the new doctor can figure which of the patients is his predecessor, he gets the job. As he interviews the patients, they begin telling him stories about how they wound up in the asylum, and these flashback stories comprise the movie.

""Asylum"" relies more heavily on special effects than some of the Amicus anthologies, and that is its main weakness. Even by 1970s standards, they look cheesy and, as I watched them, some of them were actually silly. In one segment, a woman's husband and mistress chop her up and wrap the body parts in butcher's paper and stick them in the freezer. Naturally, they don't remain in the freezer, instead coming back to life to move around (still wrapped up) and exact revenge on the killers. In another segment, a patient makes doll-sized replicas of some of the staff at the institute, and the mannequins come to life with murderous intent.

While the effects are primitive, the acting and script make up for them. The film was written by Robert Bloch, author of the novel ""Psycho,"" who adapted four of his stories, and he manages to get inside the disturbed minds of some of his characters and make their segments quite creepy. I don't want to describe the stories in too much detail, because Bloch puts a couple of very good twists in them. The first rate cast includes Peter Cushing, Herbert Lom, Barbara Parkins, Charlotte Rampling, Britt Ekland, Barry Morse, and Robert Powell, all of whom are quite good here. Director Roy Ward Baker also compensates somewhat for the special effects by a suggestive staging of some of the scenes so that the audience is left to imagine some rather gruesome happenings.

How much today's viewers enjoy ""Asylum"" depends on how much they enjoy good acting and some clever writing as opposed to seeing buckets of gore and cheap jump scares. ""Asylum"" isn't a very scary movie in the traditional sense. It is, however, quite a creepy one and an anthology that actually incorporates its setting into the storyline quite well, rather than relegating it to a gimmick. Unfortunately the picture quality on Amazon Instant Video is not HD and shows a bit of age (this is a 40 year old film that probably wasn't well preserved). It's watchable but a far cry from what audiences are used to today. Still, once viewers get into the stories, they won't notice these details any more. They won't want to live in that ""Asylum,"" but they'll enjoy the 90 minutes they spend there.",1451347200,,3885,4.731166912850813
