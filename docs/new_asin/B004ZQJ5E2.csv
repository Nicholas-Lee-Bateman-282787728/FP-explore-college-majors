8450406,4,B004ZQJ5E2,The kill or capture program is a part of the war in afganistan. The program is where the u.s. goes on nightraids and tries to hunt down the repulsive taliban. Only as this show proves the villagers are often in sympathy with the taliban because they believe in the terrible radical islam that the taliban does. And like other guerilla wars the state occupying the countryside is not living in the villages with the people. Part of this is because of political correctness. Certainly the majority of the soldiers are trying to help the afgans but the majority of the afgans from the villages don't care; they hate anyone who is not their form of islam.  The show does prove that in fact we are not winning over the areas of radical islam and perhaps we should just fight to win. If the taliban is in a village and fires at us perhaps we should bomb the buildings where fire is coming from.  Why? that's how it was done in other conflicts. It's horrible but unless the u.s. sends in more troops as in hundreds of thousands of them you don't have enough troops to cutoff the evil and cruel taliban. (the afgans forget how the taliban would randomly murder people or slaughter whole villages) The show may have a bias that is antiwar. But when you see the taliban say that even after we leave they will attack us in the west then you get the point. I would say that you should watch this and realize that although we want to help the people of this region their very form of radical religion is so intolerant that they feel that they should kill you just for NOT being part of their religion. That is a HUGe thing to overcome. We have been afraid to use airpower unless it's a dronestrike which we use effectively and sometimes make mistakes with. Which this show highlights. The bias comes through by their spending so much time on that incident. The fact is that this show will disturb you and make you realize that even after we leave. hoping that the corrupt afgan government will be able to run things. the taliban will come after us and we will have to go back to afganistan again. maybe just with bombs.  SO watch this show and draw your own conclusions. The dvd looks great too and this show was made in 2011 and it used high grade film. This is a standard dvd though. I would say anyone interested in this conflict should watch this and the show should be applauded for actually interviewing the taliban. It clears things up to what it's all about.,1329004800,3,2453,4.422566371681416
