They need to get a professional camera crew.
Instead there are all these stroby colored lights that blur everything.
However, since there is no other DVD of these acts - Lee Perry (no, there is a new DVD out), The Wailing Souls and Eeka a Mouse, they are still welcome additions to my collection.
The bands are excellent, with full bass, contrary to what many reviewers state. And the cds are good as a result, being the audio portion of the concerts.
Perhaps some of the reviewers are listening on their TV speakers or expecting a live performance to sound like their cds.",1231545600,,703,4.632
8104389,2,B000E1Z6TA,"First off, I love these guys. They are perhaps my favorite Reggae act and I was so excited about this dvd/cd. However, the quality of this is really poor. This shouldnt have been released as a commercial product. The dvd is fuzzy and not clear, and the audio is very muffled. It sounds like a bootleg, direct line from the soundboard. You hear it being mixed during the first few songs and it sounds very muffled like it was never mastered. it needs more high end EQ. I'm extremely disappointed in this and I'm disappointed in the band for releasing this. Its very amatuer. I was expecting an awesome box set here. These guys deserve better representation. Bread and Pipe rule, they are very underated in the reggae world, but this product is poor.",1181865600,,748,4.58955223880597
