2805838,5,B000OYCMLC,"I got it for special price of 21.99(available when Amazon's low on stock).  This DVD is NOT rated PG, 16 and up, extreme violence & strong language. The volume 3 of Black Lagoon continue story about kidnap a Cuban boy from his home. Roberta (is a woman), who's armed, carry a shotgun (cleverly disguised as an umbrella). She was sent to rescue the kid and bring him home alive. I DO NOT want to spoil any one, a short review is there will be a cat fight (Roberta and Revy), it going to be HOT, new plot of who's the most dangerous women, CIA involvements of new terrorist group, and Guerrillas. Overall is the best yet to come. The DVD's feature is 5.1 DTS audio (English) and 16:9 anamorphic wide screen. So it looks and sounds great in your HDTV and surround Sound system.  Action pack, funny, smart, buy it!",1192233600,2,810,4.3933333333333335

8187624,5,B000OYCMLC,"I wish I had the entire series, but alas, I don't (yet)

This has everything ANY action fan could ask for (and you won't find this on broadcast TV)

What more could I ask for?",1368662400,,175,3.9714285714285715
8187625,5,B000OYCMLC,"After receiving the kidnapped child, Lagoon's rendezvous encounters problems. They encounter the boys maid, who also just happens to be a killer android from the future. Well, that's Rocks theory at least. She has skills on par with Revy's and a past that is just as rough. After that battle, Lagoon gets drawn into a fight between the Triads, the CIA, and a anti-govt. faction. Rock is captured during the fight and Revy has to come rescue him. I can't imagine Revy being into guys, but if Rock is gonna have a chance with her he needs to man up. Getting with Revy is the only reason I can see staying with a crazy group like Lagoon.

This was a great DVD. I think that it was definitely my favorite part of season 1. This series really comes alive in the last 4 episodes. There are great new enemies, allies ,and some really intense situations. The violence and language is still R rated. Black Lagoon seems to be getting better, and I'm looking forward to watching season 2. I highly recommend this anime to people that don't mind a lot of violence and language.",1360713600,,1065,4.489690721649485
8187626,3,B000OYCMLC,"Roberta is a Maid.  A heavily armed Maid.  But not from the future.  Even if there is a joke made in the anime about it.  Roberta vs. Revy.  Big Bad Girlies trying to kill each other.  Fan service?  Yes, on many different levels.  Interesting and needed for the plot?  No.  But there is no plot, so that isn't a flaw now it is?
Blood, explosions, terrorists, knives, guns, guns, guns, and people who are NOT the good guys.  Action, cussing, drug use, I think some CIA agents also.  Hard to tell with so many sides.  Gee, I assume they are going for an adult rating?  If this was a movie, it would be X-Rated and THAT would be without sex.  Oh, and sorry, no sex.
Not much room left for character development or any plot.  Mindless.  Totally mindless.  Grab a pizza, sit down, turn off the lights, turn the volume up high - use headphones if you have them - and watch it.  If you are high on drugs or from cough drops, all the better.
Otherwise I suggest you just skip on this one.",1322784000,,980,4.2
8187627,4,B000OYCMLC,"When Geneon packed its bags and fled back to Japan, I thought it would never be completed here in the states. With Funimation grabbing up this title, I'm assured I'll be getting my next fix soon.

But, oh but. Is funi~ going to be Mother$#%#ing Sh@* Suckin' Scum and only release the first season as a pack?!

I wait with clenched teeth at their decisions in this regard.",1218326400,,371,4.4411764705882355

8187630,5,B000OYCMLC,"This is one heck of a great ride, that ends up with three of the most dangerous women in the world in an interesting ""altercation"".

This whole series has been fun from start to finish. Hopefully we'll be able to see the next one even though Geneon seems to be gone from the North American market.

Black Lagoon is on the order of Cowboy Bebop in action adventure anime. You will not be disappointed.",1193702400,,400,4.391891891891892
8187631,5,B000OYCMLC,"I own literally hundreds of anime DVDs. I am a fan of such shows as Noir, Madlax, Planetes, Egro Proxy and Gunsmith Cats. The sort of anime that is not too over-the-top science fiction and that has a tone of realism. For my buck Black Lagoon has to rate as my all time favorite.
If you like action, darker storylines and morally ""interesting"" characters then this anime is for you. I just pray that Geneon gets their distribution nightmare worked out and the 2nd Barrage is eventually released. While Black Lagoon is fantastic, Black Lagoon: 2nd Barrage is simply awsome.
Even if you can only ever get a hold on these first three volumes it will well be worth the price of purchase.",1193443200,3,682,4.5528455284552845
8187632,5,B000OYCMLC,"Final volume of season 1 from the sadly-no-longer-trading Geneon USA of what is one of the finest anime series of recent years.  Great manga, great adaptation of the manga, and superbly localised in the English dub as well.  Best bit is the hard-edged psychological underpinnings to the characters, lending dramatic and emotional credibility to the whole thing.",1192579200,2,361,5.315789473684211
