7954897,4,B00005UO7W,"The only reason I give this movie 4 stars is not because of the episodes, just after a commercial part the movie goes back a little bit and don't leave off at the part before the commercial break! I think that's stupid to waste the time.

7954900,2,B00005UO7W,"Ok, I normally like the Bishojo Senshi Sailor moon Series, but C'mon DiC! the cover is hidieos! Chibi-usa (Rini) isn't Sailor Chibi-Moon Until Sailor Moon S. And well, all the covers for ADV's ""Dubbed feture of Sailor Moon"" Covers are hideios, american-drawn (no offence), and when you pass it you probobley think ""Ok, who is gonna bye this?"" The covers basicly show what the movie is about so if you passed it, you'd think it was another ""Super Girl Chick Flick"" 1 sugestion:
 Get the UNCUT, just pass the dub, like it is a barney video...
Overall, I'd rate this 4.9/5, but DiC, PLEASE! (Dubb 2.3...",1010275200,,600,4.660377358490566
