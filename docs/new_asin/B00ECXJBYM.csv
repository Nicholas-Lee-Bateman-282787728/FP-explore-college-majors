5904029,5,B00ECXJBYM,"What a prize for my three year old grandson. Most boys and girls treasure these moments. Once and awhile, my grandson asks: "" Grandma, are you going to order Thomas again? Caritas7",1391644800,,180,4.65625
5904030,5,B00ECXJBYM,"My five year old son has been a Thomas fan from birth I think but hes starting to outgrow the show a bit as its almost TOO short for him. When they are really little, you need those short ten minute shows because thats about as long as their attention span is but at five, he likes longer features so the new Thomas & Friends 3 Movie Pack was perfect for him!

He was a little bummed that they weren't new movies so hes seen two of them BUT we didn't own any of them and he had really been wanting to see Misty Island Rescue and Day of the Diesels is one of his all time favorites.

This is one of those sets thats a great value at around $20 because some movies cost that much by themselves! Its perfect for all the Thomas fans out there and I was happy to get three in one.

All three movies also have bonus features which Reed really likes. He likes to play the games after he watches the movies and he really liked the video on Day of the Diesels about learning how they work. He has an engineering brain so its fun for him to learn things extra things about trains.

The Thomas & Friends 3 Movie Pack is a great value and features three of the latest (and best in our opinions) Thomas movies for your little train fan.",1381968000,6,1223,4.062240663900415

8604057,5,B00ECXJBYM,"Very nice toy for my 3 year old nephew.  He loves it.  I only wish it had a longer range for the distance the remote can control the train as it operates.  But for the most part, I would recommend this to any child who loves Thomas the Train toys!",1483056000,,247,3.9

8604061,5,B00ECXJBYM,"Day of the Diesels, Silly Steamies!!!! I swear I have watched this about 100 times since purchasing in Sept 2014.  The song at the end is great, the story line is wonderful.

8604065,5,B00ECXJBYM,This 3-pack of Thomas movies did not disappoint.  My 3 year old has been pretty much obsessed with Thomas & Friends since age 2.  I know some get annoyed with the new characters that are introduced (new characters = new toys to buy) but I think that keeps things fun. I like each of these movies and the music too and best thing...my kids love them!,1394496000,,349,4.2727272727272725
