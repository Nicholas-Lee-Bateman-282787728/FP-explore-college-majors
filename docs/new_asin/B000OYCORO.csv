8187608,5,B000OYCORO,"The narrator really opens the product all the way. Even though you feel you've perhaps made a good choice with the Juno-G
(LCD screen problem notwithstanding) there is hardly any way to know how many goodies you are really getting.
I haven't had a new synthesizer since I junked my Memorymoog after a divorce...it has taken this long to regroup and
I am amazed at how far the techology has come. This DVD is essential. Both manuals that come
with the unit are not enough. . . so I consider this DVD to be an absolute necessity.

The only aggravating point is his reference to certain
functions or paramaters as ""these guys."" That is my idiosyncracy. . .I cringe to that particular echo.

He talks fast and moves fast which means you get a good deal of information compressed into the time
limit but you can stop and go back. Ha...it is one of the best ""TV shows ""I've seen in a while.
Watch it over and over and everything starts sticking. There are so many fine points you don't
want to miss. Neglecting to adjust one little thing will keep you from your work.

The overall flavor is the man giving you some great tips. . .really showing you the ropes
just like a personal friend doing you a kind favor.

Before you know it, you have your
instincts in play and moving on down the tracks.
I have another DVD for my Tascam neo 2488 and he does a splendid job there as well.
First I said ""Oh no...it's him"" but he's okay.

Great buy and I intend to refer back to it for things I don't need right now.
He is very friendly and personable, not condescending
even when being gently simplistic. He pulls the drawers off this thing
and makes her blush.

Buy it...you will use it as long as you have your Juno.",1288310400,3,1701,4.333333333333333
8187609,5,B000OYCORO,"This is a wonderful training DVD for the Roland Juno-G synth.  It is very thorough and laid out in a logical way from beginning to end.  The trainer, David Wills, is an amazing instructor.  He is extremely knowledgeable with music technology, and clearly explains almost all the aspects of the Juno-G synth.  David brings to life many of the things that one needs to know to perform both basic and advanced operations on the synth.

The DVD starts with an orientation to the front and back panels of the synth.  It then moves on to using the controls appropriate for playing.  Next David covers the many onboard effects, building a song with drums and other parts, editing, and then recording audio.  He also covers connecting the Juno-G to your computer, as well as advanced functions such as editing patches and rhythms.

During his presentation, the video switches to a close-up view of the part of the front panel that David is working with.  This makes it very easy to follow what he is doing.  Finally, the DVD has navigation menus that allow you to jump to different sections, which is handy.

I am very satisfied with my purchase.",1246924800,2,1138,4.691919191919192
8187610,5,B000OYCORO,"This DVD manual is brilliant.  I learned so much, so fast.  The Roland Juno-G isn't the easiest thing to figure out.  This DVD manual helped me get up and running quickly.  I watched it beginning to end, which really accelerated the learning curve.  And still I use it as a reference when I'm trying to figure out something specific.  The navigation makes it easy to go right to the section you need.

There was only one part that I felt was less than perfect.  It is where you are transferring files to your computer.  The narrator says something like ""If you don't see the file on the screen, it is probably because you didn't write it.""  Well, he didn't say to write it in the sequence leading up to this section.  But at least with that quote, you can figure out what went wrong an how to fix it.  But that's just a minor issue.  Overall, this is a great product.  I wish everything I bought had something like this available!",1234742400,3,930,4.362573099415204
8187611,4,B000OYCORO,"I purchased this DVD because I am new to the world of synth. I am mostly a guitar player who loves and is learning the piano. I also really want to get into the whole recording aspect which is why the Juno-G appealed to me with it's ability to record live instruments. When I first got the keyboard the manual overwhelmed me; however, I read it as much as I could, when I could. Well being a musician and visual person I was hoping there was an easier way and I was suggested this DVD. I must admit that it has helped SO MUCH. I am able to put my portable DVD player next to me and search through the sections that I have questions with. The only complaint that I can give is that the instructor goes through the steps real quick. It seems like he speaks mostly to those who have previous workstation experience. I am able to follow; but, it takes a minute of pausing the DVD and cathing up where he is in the steps of creating ""patches"" and ""perfomances"" and so on. All in all, this is a much easier soluntion to the manual and is great for learning the amazing capabilities of this workstation. If you are someone who needs to see and hear what the manual is talking about this DVD is an A+.",1180396800,11,1193,4.1688311688311686
