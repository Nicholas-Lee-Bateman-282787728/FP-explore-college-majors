1893878,5,B00009WHSJ,"This vol. shows how much inuyasha really loved or missed Kikyo, but while admitting to it, but there was a plan behind it, and that was for kikyo to take inuyasha with her to hell, but while inuyasha was being pulled in and hugging kikyo, he didn't realize that kagome was in the middle of the whole thing watching them two, it is not sad, but once you hear the backround music it just makes you want to drift off!! And later we enter sango the demon exterminator, the berve girl, another victim of naraku who killed her village and took the only thing in the world...her brother....",1066608000,2,583,4.407407407407407
1893879,5,B00009WHSJ,"Now this is a movie. Kiyko is back and is now after Inuyasha heart. And soul? Kikyo wants Inuyasha to die with her. Inuyasha expresses his love for her without even knowing that Kagome is right watching every single thing that he is saying to Kikyo.
 Sango is now entering the show. The last episode on the dvd shows Sango. Sango's family are demon slayers that are called to a village to rid them of a giant spider, but instead as they kill the spider, her village is being slaughtered by demons. When she finds out, Naraku says that it was Inuyasha who did it.
  Buy this dvd. I have it and you will love it.",1066003200,,610,4.241379310344827
1893880,5,B00009WHSJ,"Those of you who love Inu Yasha, should see the movies. In this one, Kikyo comes back, it's basically the second half of book eight. She comes, and tries to kill Inu Yasha. But luckily, Kagome's able to stop her. This DVD also introduces Sango, the demon killer, the very end of book 9.",1063238400,2,286,4.314814814814815
1893881,1,B00009WHSJ,"I have all the Inu-Yasha DVD's up to this one, and they are all excellent. I preordered this one and have the next 2 on preorder as well. Inu-Yasha is one of the most entertaining series I have seen in a while. Here comes the but. BUT the quality off this DVD was terrible. At full screen on my pc all kinds of terrible lines show up in the picture. It looks much worse than any VHS picture. I tried it in my player attached to my TV and it has the copy protection fade that none of the others have had. I have an old TV so I have to run the DVD player through the VCR. Furthermore the first thing that happens when you put in the disc is it plays a minute long commercial for Ranma1/2 This is also a first for the series. I think I'm paying enough for these without having to put up with commercials. I am going to contact the publisher, VIZ entertainment, and complain about the plummeting quality. If I don't get satisfaction from the company I will probably cancel my order.",1061510400,,978,4.152631578947369
1893882,5,B00009WHSJ,"This begins the ""Inuyasha Love Triangle"", it is rather deep.  One episode is ""A Wicked Smile; Kikyo's Wandering Soul"".  I could compare some of the story to the Diablo 2 game for PC.  Both are the same time period and have some points that can tell them apart.  I have already seen the episodes that are on this DVD, and they have some interesting points in the story.  Want to know? See for yourself.",1060732800,,401,4.364864864864865
1893883,5,B00009WHSJ,"Hey all you anime fans and otaku and all you regular people too. ^_^  Anyway... I am a huge fan of Inuyasha and have been since i saw the first episode that aired in the U.S. I am gonna make this brief b/c I have to go somewhere... Anyone who is a fan of Inuyasha should buy this DVD. I am sure most of you fans have already seen the episodes air on Adult Swim on Cartoon Network and know what to expect. Can't remember how many episodes are on it... Wasn't paying attention when I looked earlier. >_<  And if any non-Inuyasha anime fan who comes across this I encourage you to start from DVD1:Down The Well. BUT that is if ya don't know the storyline...Anyhow have fun ppl...g2g... O yeah... For all you people that don't know Inuyasha is coming back on August 25, 2003 with the new epsodes...Yall people behind might wanna catch up if ya got behind.. ^_^ ...OK..NOW I am gone..lol...",1060646400,,885,4.325301204819277
1893884,5,B00009WHSJ,"This includes ""A Wicked Smile; Kikyo's Wandering Soul"", ""Kagome's Voice and Kikyo's Kiss"", and ""Enter...Sango the Demon Exterminator"" (Episodes 22-24, if you're counting).
In my opinion, the first two episodes are a couple of the best of the Inu Yasha series (and I've seen most of them).  These really define and set the tone for the relationship between Inu Yasha/Kikyo/Kagome for the rest of the series.  I highly recommend this one.",1060214400,2,436,5.126760563380282
1893885,5,B00009WHSJ,"The episodes on this DVD are really great epi.s! 'A Wicked Smile, Kikyo's Wandering Soul' was great! The monk had a good idea there, to bad Kikyo ruined it! Lol! But my favorite was 'Kagome's Voice and Kikyo's Kiss'! That totally gets Kagome jealous! Hah! This will be a great DVD to have! When August comes, I'm totally gonna get it on the first day! Heh!",1057708800,2,356,4.409090909090909
7993646,5,B00009WHSJ,"Kagome is a normal high school girl, until she falls down a well at her home on her 15th birthday. She climbs out and finds herself in a 16th century Japan where demons run rampant. She is pursued by a centipede demon and finds herself clinging to a boy stuck to a tree. He wakes up and tells her if she removes him from the tree, he will kill the monster. He makes good on the promise. While the fight goes on a jewel comes out of Kagome's side. It has the power to make any demon or human immeasurable powerful. That makes it a hot commodity. While retrieving the jewel, Kagome breaks it, and the shards are scattered throughout the country. Inuyasha and Kagome must work together to find them all and keep them out of the hands of evil doers.

Kikyo is tormented by her state. She traps Kagome and lures Inuyasha to her. She talks with him about the past, the present, and the future. Kagome sees this and becomes confused. She also realizes that Kikyo's heart is black and that she has a more sinister motive than she is letting on.

This anime is a legend. If there is someone out there who hasn't seen it, they need to remedy that situation as soon as possible. This series has everything. Drama, action, comedy, suspense, and romance. It is a fairy tale that you will never forget. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are also unforgettable. This anime is one of the best ever, and a must see for anime fans of all ages.",1353196800,,1435,4.370786516853933
7993647,5,B00009WHSJ,"The three episodes on this eighth volume are especially poetic and tragic, packing a strong emotional wallop. The first two episodes center on the vengeful soul of Kikyo. Last seen falling to her death, she survived and has been residing in a village, posing as a priestess. To all apperances, she seems like her old self, being respected as holy, acting kind, playing with children, etc. But she hides a dark secret. She must gather the souls of dying young women and consume them in order to keep the shape of a human. The rumors of her deeds have spread, and a nobleman has asked Inuyasha and the others to protect the soul of his dying daughter. They accept the task, not knowing that Kikyo is involved.  Meanwhile, at another village, Sango, a demon-slayer for hire from a village that kills demons for a living attend upon a lord whose main advisor is Naraku! How will this evil demon try to ensnare Sango into helping him in his battle against Inuyasha?

Kikyo and Sango are both young women whose lives are irrevocably changed by the demon Naraku. He takes a loved one away from both of them. Even in the form Kikyo inhabits now, she still loves Inuyasha, but it doesn't have a future. And I think she also senses that Inuyasha's heart is bending away from her and towards Kagome. Sango has to see her village and family destroyed in cold blood, all in an effort to lure her into a trap of Naraku's. This volume is not for the faint-hearted because it involves a lot of heartbreak.",1122768000,3,1489,4.5315985130111525
7993648,5,B00009WHSJ,"Inuyasha: Volume 8: Kikyo's Wandering Soul contains three highly dramatic episodes that pull you deeper into wanting to watch more of this series.  If you are not hooked after this DVD, you will never be.  Volume 8 contains three episodes, 22, 23, and 24.  They are titled ""The Soul of Kikyo,"" ""Kagome's Voice and Kikyo's Kiss,"" and ""Enter Sango, the Demon Slayer.""

After showing how Kikyo makes herself feel better by capturing souls of brokenhearted women with her soul-stealing demons (which look like eels), we see how she just wants to live in peace and anonymity in a little village where she has found a home.  Alas, it is not to be.  A powerful monk is out to defeat her, Kagome finds her hiding place, and she is followed by an adoring little village girl.  There truly is no rest for the dead here. The first two episodes give Kikyo and Inuyasha fans a lot of material.  We can see how they still love each other, how love reaches out beyond the grave.  Sadly, Kikyo's love has been somewhat twisted.

The third episode, ""Enter Sango, The Demon Slayer,"" is the darkest, most violent episode of the Inuyasha series so far.  Yet, it is also one of the most compelling.  The stunning Sango makes her debut.  We see her village, her family, her lifestyle and proud tradition of being accomplished Demonslayers.  In the blink of an eye, it is all lost, with horrible cruelty.  Those who have seen Sango only in later episodes as part of the gang, without knowing her full history and the anguish she suffered, will never look at her the same way after seeing this DVD and Volume 9: Origin of the Sacred Jewel.",1112054400,2,1615,4.578397212543554
7993649,4,B00009WHSJ,"another very good volume.  u may ask y i rate it w/ a 4 instead of 5...it's just cause this one is a bit more mushier than some others, but if u like that stuff, you should buy this.  cause InuYasha still ROCKS either way!  don't get me wrong cause i do like it though. :)

7993650,5,B00009WHSJ,"Thanks to some evil witch, Kikyo is back, and she wants to kill In-yasha, because she believes that he betrayed her... Now her wondering soul walks among the humans, with only one mission, ending Inuyashas life.

There is someone out there that is taking dead women's souls, and Inu-Yasha and his pals are here to help. But they find out this is mroe personal than what they thought, for the soul stealer is Kikyo(Inyashas first love) Now things get personal. But when Kagome decides she should help, she finds out more than what she might have wanted to know. For Inu-Yashas secrent is let out. Kagome fears of losing Inu-yasha, and knows that he would not leave. Kagomes shout awakens Inu-yasha, and ofcourse, he is there to save her. Somethign that nobody might have thought our Inu-yasha might do.

Inuyasha fears for losing Kagome, and wants to protect her.

The friends come upon a village, where the best demon slayers live.  But Naraku again with his desiving mind,tricks a young slayer to believe that the killer is Inu-yasha. Not knowing that she has lost alot of her blood, the girl Sango fights till death, but inu-yasha spares her life.  Now the team has a new member, and like everyone else....she has a reason for going after Naraku...she will avenge her village, and see that Naraku dies.

 These are one of the best episodes, because it has everything that it  needs, love, adventure, battles, and ofcourse, revenge..  Watch this and you will find out everything you need to know about the lives of our team: Inu-yasha, not Kagome, her life is just beginning to make sense, Noroku, and Sango.

Inuyasha is the best anime one could ever see..  :D",1091318400,4,1662,4.736111111111111
7993651,5,B00009WHSJ,"I wrote a review for this DVD already, but Amazon has not posted it!  I don't know why - maybe it was too long or they thought it had ""spoiler"" information.

So I won't say a lot, just that of the episodes I've seen, and own on DVD, I really like these three!

Episode 22:  ""A Wicked Smile:  Kikyo's Wandering Soul"" and Episode 23:  ""Kagome's Voice and Kikyo's Kiss"".  Sort of a two-part episode, though they are not called that.  Wow, great music, the eerie Kikyo (aka ""the angry dead ex-girlfriend from hell!"") and the Kagome-Inu Yasha-Kikyo love triangle, come on, it don't get any better than this!  Seriously, the combination of the supernatural, the spiritual, and love lost, is very powerful.  I recommend you check out Kikyo's facial expressions throughout these episodes, they are so varied and complex, they really took care to show her inner turmoil.  She's not at all like your standard anime character.

Episode 24 ""Enter Sango, the Demon Slayer"" is certainly bloody but Sango is probably my favorite *human* character (Sesshomaru and Kikyo are more interesting, but the one's a full demon and the other's sort of like your living dead).  Sango is a strong female protagonist, older (18-20?) and neither as hyper, emotional or clumsy as Kagome.  All of which makes sense, given that she is from a pre-industrial era and trained in physical combat (skills that are useful for fending off the advances of a certain ""bad boy"" Monk!).

All three episodes are top notch.  If you buy this one I suspect you will want to buy more!",1082160000,7,1536,4.739622641509434
7993652,5,B00009WHSJ,"I first watched Inu Yasha (the first 52 eps) on adult swim.  I am just now buying up the DVDs. To be honest, I was not impressed with this show much from the first 13 episodes.  Kikyo's arrival in episodes 14 and 15 really pulled me into this anime.  Her return in episode 22 represents one of the highest points in the first 3 seasons; because it escalates Inu Yasha's primary (and best) storyline arc.  If there was any storyline arc I found nearly as compelling, It is Sango's.  The way she parts from her father and brother is perhaps the most cruel and emotional I have seen in an anime to date.  Her brothers eventual dependency on a sacred jewel fragment sets up interesting plot developements down the road as well.  Episodes 22-24 cover the introduction and reintroduction of the animes 2 best story arcs, respectively.
Conveniently, 3 of the best episodes in the entire series fell into one DVD.
If you bought the first 7 volumes, then you would have to be crazy not to get this one.
The voice acting is done by the reliable ocean group (Ranma 1/2, Escaflowne); If you don't like this dub you probably saw it subbed first or don't like dubs period.  The casting in the sub version makes the anime feel darker, more cinematic, and frankly, better.
I still prefer the dub though, I've recognized 9 voices from Escaflowne (a good dub) so far, and the dub of Inu Yasha is much funnier.  Richard Cox (Ranma in Ranma 1/2) is well cast for Inu Yasha, probably an even better cast than he was in Ranma 1/2.  His brash talking style is perfect.  Kagome is completely different in the dub; more of a cheerleader.  I still like her better in the dub because she makes Kagome seem nicer and a more attractive love interest for Inu Yasha, but some will find her annoying.  Kirby Morrow (Van in Escaflowne) is perfect as Miroku.  A big surprise was Kikyo's voice actress, who only had small roles (Hitomi's friend Yukari in Escaflowne and Kasumi Tendo Ranma 1/2) before this.  I can hardly recognize her voice in this anime, its filled with so much emotion.  Her voice works very well deep and understated, it has kind of a strange sexyness/mystery to it.  At times she borders on overacting and sounding cheezy, but she rides that line well and the end result is very impressive.  She's probably a very big reason why Inu Yasha is one of my favorite animes.  Sango is perfectly cast as Kelly Sheridan (Hitomi from Esca, and the beloved Ukkyo from Ranma 1/2).  Paul Dobson does great work once again as Naraku and Myoga (He is probably best known for playing Folken in Esca).  I didn't catch his name, but the voice actor for Sesshomaru is very very good, perhaps the best male voice actor in the show.  He shames the relatively goofy sounding Japanese voice by comparison.  Kagura and Koga (when they come in) are excellent voices as well.
There are some annoying voices too.  Shippo is less entertaining and more annoying in the dub.  Jaken (Sesshomaru's helper) is simply unbearable.  The overall effect of the dub voice actors makes Inu Yasha seem more lighthearted; more fun.  But be warned, it will probably take a while to enjoy the dub for what it is.
If you are a fan of Rumiko Takahashi, Inu Yasha will not dissapoint, even if it is a little unconventional and little more action oriented (and darker).  This is perhaps her best anime for characters and character development, and thats saying a lot.
The dvd has some issues playing on some dvd players (like computer dvd drives).  I too think that VIZ is a little insane for releasing these volumes 3 episodes at a time.  The extra expense is fine, but the wait is becoming hard to bear.",1078963200,8,3644,4.561538461538461
7993653,4,B00009WHSJ,"I had seen episodes 1-21 on all Japanese subtitled videos and let me tell you, the voice actors were fantaboulus!!! Japanese voice actors always are awesome! It`a a known fact. Keppei yamaguchi as Inu Yasha is totally cool so is Noriko what`s -her-face as Kikyo and the woman who does Kagome, Yeah they`re all really cool. BUT!!! big BUT!!!!!! the American or Canadian or whatever they are voice actors SUCK.(with three underlines under suck)I mean royally. They are the mightiest of all SUCKY voice actors. When I first heard Richard Cox`s voice saying something like ""Kikyo did`nt go away to save herself""I was blown away, I fell of my chair,I died,I was brokenhearted. The other actors did the same thing to me ,
It`s sad but Kikyo sounded like she was impersonating someones voice under waster with poisen vapors all around her whlie sucking in air and digesting testosterone. while Kagome`s voice was alot better then Kikyo`s (at least she sounded like a girl)but she just did`nt match the charactor description AT ALL,and Miroku well he just gave a new and more extreme meaning to the word ""LAME"".Shippou was bad, even though he managed to get his voice to sound like a little demon boy`s. And the others like Kaede ( who sounded like she was 20, but with strep throat)The princess Sayo and the monk were all decent but they only had about 6lines each.  But let`s say we watched it with engilsh subtitles in Japanese,this dvd is very good. With the first two episodes all about meeting Kikyo without her tring to kill Inu Yasha. It was true to the comic which is good ,but I have heard that they start to drift away from the comic and go off to do their own thing after episode 30. If you liked the comic version you will like this ,and if you haven't read the comic  and you are looking at the store ,go out and get a life.
  The second part is when Sango comes into the scene. Wich stays true to the comic too.
  The thing is ,that these dvds are very expensive for only 75min,worth of fun,Isuggest you sped you dollars on gas money looking for a place were you can rent these dvds. Plus you can only watch them a few times before they get boring.",1069286400,,2155,4.498721227621483
7993654,5,B00009WHSJ,"Kikyo's Wandering Soul DVD is very well done as all the Inuyasha DVDs are. Basically what happens is exactly what happens in Manga 8 and the very end of manga 9. They totally skip the Peach Man but he's in higher episodes. The manga and anime don't correspond very well anyway. If you have manga 8 while watching, some of the dialogue aren't the same but they never are. The DVD does have some extra features like sketches and viewing the story from different points. I give this 5 stars because of the good quality of this DVD.",1068422400,,528,4.3979591836734695
7993655,4,B00009WHSJ,"I just started ordering the Inuyasha series not too long ago because I heard that it was a good show. After ordering the first seven dvds, I had to wait a whole month before this one came out. When it did I was a little disappointed with the episodes. They still are entertaining, but the first two episodes on the disk are just boring. I guess, though, that all series have their downsides. This dvd is still a great dvd.",1066780800,,422,4.2875
