3033621,3,B000YOX3G0,I know few Indians as out of touch with our culture as this Blood was.  But it had such cute twists and turns as the Trickster worked in his life.  - Laughs-A-Lot,1344384000,,162,4.03125
3033622,2,B000YOX3G0,"The story here is okay, but the acting, directing, and photography leave much to be desired.  This was clearly made on a shoestring budget, but even at that, there should have been more quality control.  If you want a better film about Native Americans, try Smoke Signals or Christmas in the Clouds.",1261353600,6,299,4.730769230769231
3033623,2,B000YOX3G0,"I wanted to like this movie but I just couldn't. The writing, directing, and acting were too sophomoric for me to enjoy. The basic premise was good and very Native American-like (think trickster meets modern Indian) but the writer-director could not pull it off.

There are a number of great Indian movies out there that work, and some wonderful must-see artistic beginnings (eg. Fancy Dancing by Sherman Alexie), but this movie falls into neither category. It is great high school material, but nothing more.",1230163200,2,509,5.059523809523809
3033624,1,B000YOX3G0,"Everything about this movie is bad, bad, bad. By far the worst acting I've ever seen. Couldn't wait until the awful thing ended.",1229904000,,128,4.608695652173913
3033625,5,B000YOX3G0,"This movie is refreshingly wonderful. While being very funny, it is also filled with many authentic Native nuances. Steve Pierre is delightful and captivating. The intrinsic innocence and purity of this movie gives it a depth and quality that the expensive, over-produced ""Hollywood"" movies could never capture. Even the flatness with some of the acting invites you into an authenticity of this very pleasant comedy. I highly recommend this movie. It is such a nice break from the deluge of over marketed,poor quality, made-to-make-someone-wealthy movies from an industry that lost touch with simple Quality a long time ago.",1218326400,2,624,5.377551020408164
3033626,3,B000YOX3G0,"This film shows its indie, low budget origins. The script is disjointed and contains too many fey, improvised characters - such as the dead man who cavorts across the landscape dispensing mystical wisdoms. To be fair, some of the annoying intrusions of this impossible fellow were probably due to misfortunes that dogged the filming of this movie. There's no Director's commentary on this DVD, as the jacket might lead a person to believe. But there's a printed Director's statement. When you lean in close to read the small print of this statement, you learn that the lead actor in ""Rain"" had a stroke during filming. The Director had to shuffle scenes and make other adjustments to fill in the gaps caused by this setback. That's probably how the dead man's role got expanded.

Despite the high school recital last-minute, run-on, pulling together in the face of catastrophe quality of this movie though, there is definitely something memorable and heartwarming about ""Rain."" Steve Pierre, that lead actor, plays his part with irrepressible ebullience.

Pierre is a Native American who feels called in the film to rally his people back to the old ways. However, since he has never hunted, fished, or done anything that could even remotely be classified as ""Indian"" - he faces quite a challenge. His attempts to return to a traditional way of living only end in a series of quixotic misadventures.

I didn't get many actual belly laughs here, but I did get some chuckles - for example, in the scene where Pierre takes his son to a town elder to ask the older man's advice about how to proceed in restoring the old ways. The elder speaks only in his Native language. Pierre, to save face with his son, pretends to understand. He translates the elder's idle offer of a beer as a mystic utterance of wisdom about ""following the path.""

After involving himself in his series of blunders, Pierre feels momentarily depressed, a failure. He apologizes to his son for being such an embarrassment. But his son knows better. His son cheerfully reassures his Dad that he wouldn't have any other man as his father. The boy sums up by rejoicing that none of his friends have fathers who are nearly so ""interesting.'

I felt the same way. I ended up wanting to spend more time with Pierre's unique character. He would make a wonderful centerpiece for a TV series. He calls for development, for our getting to know him over weeks and months. I hope someone out there will tackle turning this great premise into a ""Northern Exposure"" type of series.",1215302400,9,2534,4.7894736842105265

You realize how hard it is for Indians to get back to their roots and early ways of life, Unlike other nationalities, they cannot go back to the ''old world'' to learn like a lot of people can. A lot of the old people that remember are about gone. It is so hard.  I think the whole family would enjoy this one. It is wonderful with some hysterical parts!",1476748800,,582,4.2342342342342345
