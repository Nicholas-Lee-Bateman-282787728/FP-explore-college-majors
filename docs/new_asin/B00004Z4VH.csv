1382060,5,B00004Z4VH,"This is a great DVD by someone who knows HOW to sing.  Bobby has had a long career and isn't afraid to tell you about it.  I really enjoy this DVD and have watched it many times.  The only weakness in this DVD is the quality of the band.  I'm not sure if this is his regular road band.  I don't think it is, because none of the artists are listed and he has to instruct them at times during the performance.  I think some of these BET DVDs use local musicians.  I think this is particularly evident in the Chaka Kahn DVD on BET.  She is always great, but she is clearly unimpressed with the band.",1110412800,2,596,4.034188034188034
1382061,5,B00004Z4VH,I really enjoyed it. Bobby Womack sounds great and sung every song through. Thanks Bobby for so much good music! Cheryl/OKC,1078012800,4,123,4.904761904761905
1382062,5,B00004Z4VH,"Bobby Womack can definitely be said to be an American original.  An old school soul singer/songwriter who practically invented his own school...  There are no cliches in his music... Bobby Womack *is* Bobby Womack... and its all for the better. - -  What's amazing about this DVD is that he performs and sings the songs as if they were written yesterday... His voice hasn't changed a bit...  He's looking great too... pretty amazing when you realize this guy started out working for Sam Cooke during the golden age of soul...  Aside from his ability to write memorable hits, when you think of all this guys peers, and how few of them are still on the planet... its almost as if this guy is a gift to the world from the fountain of youth... And the great thing about this DVD :  his energy and vibrance still show him to be the star that he is... plus he has no shame in playing the tunes the people want to hear.  All in all... even though this video wasn't made ""back in the day"", its still a rare gem.  - - At my bar here in Tokyo, I can't tell you how many customers demand I put it on the player every time they come in... and believe me, I have no complaints about that whatsoever !",1073865600,11,1187,4.2444444444444445
1382063,4,B00004Z4VH,I REALLY ENJOYED VIEWING THIS VIDEO BECAUSE BOBBY WOMACK SELDOM DID TOURS TO THE CHICAGO AREA. I ALWAYS LOVED HIS MUSIC BUT I DID NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE. I WILL ADD THIS TO MY MUSIC DOCUMENTARY FILE.,1056844800,6,210,4.275
1382064,4,B00004Z4VH,"I really enjoyed this Performance from Bobby Womack. He is one of the most Underrated Artists to me.the Guy has a Soulful Pressence&a way with Words.the Cat can still Rap on stage. I've seen tighter overall Concert Footage from Bobby back in the day so this Performance while Good isn't the tightest on the Cat but You Can't go wrong if you are just getting into this Soul Genius Catelog.sit back&hear a Real Rapper,Soul Brother throw Down. Very Underrated Guitar Player&so many other things.the Cat has Gigged with Sly Stone,The Rolling Stones,Rick James Among many others.you can feel the Sam Cooke Influence in his Presentation.",1040774400,4,631,5.019047619047619
1382065,4,B00004Z4VH,"Bobby Womack is one of the worlds most influential soul music writers and performers.  Over the years, his songs have been recorded by a wide varity of music superstars like George Benson, Chaka Kahn, New Birth, Patti Labelle, Wilson Pickett and Sam Cooke.  Bobby and his band put together a great soul concert. They perform most of Bobby's soul hits including an impromptu version of Facts of Life.  If you want to see a real show, buy this DVD.",1010016000,,446,4.620253164556962
1382066,1,B00004Z4VH,"This is one of the most disappointing dvds that i have purchased in a long time. Bobby spends more time talking than singing. It would have been so much better if he had stuck to singing instead of trying to be a comedian. He recorded some very good songs,but he only sang them in small verses on this dvd. I was unable to enjoy one complete song. I feel as if i wasted my money. The reason for buying a dvd,is to be able to watch them more than once. I will never reach for this one again,unless it is requested by a guest. I would be leary of buying another dvd by MR.Bobby Womack!",979084800,6,583,4.078260869565217

1382227,5,B00004Z4VH,I watched this with my dad on Father's day because he is such a huge fan.  He enjoyed it so much and offered it to me to watch at home.  I know most of the songs and I enjoyed him giving background information his career and life.  So now I am ordering it for myself.  I truly enjoyed it and would recommend it.,1277078400,4,311,3.888888888888889
1382228,1,B00004Z4VH,"I have been a Bobby Womack fan since the 1970s, and unfortunately I have to say this is one of his worst performances.  First of all, Bobby acted like he was so tired of his own material that he didn't even feel like performing any it.  As a matter-of-fact, he preferred to talk to the audience for at least half of most of the songs he half performed, singing only three or four versus from a song.  His vocal performance of course was not optimal, however considering his age it was acceptable, if he had only elected to sing the songs rather than talk through them.  If I had paid for a ticket, I would request a refund.  Don't waste your time or your money on this concert, unless you are so much of a Bobby Womack diehard fan that you really don't care whether he sings or not.  In that case, perhaps you will enjoy his self-indulgent conversation throughout the concert.",1255651200,2,876,4.3765432098765435
1382229,5,B00004Z4VH,"I've had this DVD for over a year now and every time I watch it, I enjoy it just as much as I did the first time I viewed it. Although, it is unfortunate that I wasn't at the venue when Womack recorded the DVD, when I watch it at home on the big screen and home theater system, it's almost as if I am in attendance.  Most all of my favorite Womack songs are performed.  Why Harry Hippie was not performed is still mind boggling to me.  None the less, this was an excellent DVD.  The band was great.  Bobby struggled with a few notes but it didn't take away from his performance.  His overall performance was great.  The DVD was of excellent sound and video quality.  This is one of my favorite concert DVDs.",1238544000,7,707,4.147058823529412
1382230,5,B00004Z4VH,"Bobby is in rare form!!!  This DVD is great!  It is not only a show with good singing, he is kinda funny as well!  Bobby is a good showman and you will love his music and this DVD.  It definitely rates five stars!",1235520000,2,213,3.883720930232558
1382231,5,B00004Z4VH,"Everybody else, take a lesson. Bobby Womack is in session. He came to ""B.E.T and showed how to captivate an audience for an hour. He talked, he sang and he played. New Jacks, take a lesson.",1200528000,,189,4.277777777777778
1382232,5,B00004Z4VH,"I think Bobby Womack is one sexy brother.  I always liked his song ""A Woman Got To Have It"", but of course I was born in 1961.  Watching this concert made me realize what I had been missing.  I have watched this live concert atleast 10 times already.  He is my mid-night fire on Friday nights after all long working week.",1194307200,,321,4.213114754098361
1382233,3,B00004Z4VH,"There are two issues here. (1)The editorial review claims on the songlist ""Harry Hippie"" as one of the offerings on this DVD.

This is not so, and bearing in mind that I purchased same for that song more than anything else I feel cheated as I was looking forward to seeing bobby perform same. Someone owes me an apology and a refund.(2)Having said that I think the performance was good in general but Mr. Womack spoke too much thus detracting from an otherwise captivating performance.",1152144000,4,485,4.705882352941177
1382234,2,B00004Z4VH,"I review concerts and erotic films....sometimes I review normal films too...

But I happen to know a quality show when I see one on DVD...and this was not one!  I love the music of Mr. Womack and have many of his original records...and CD's.

That being said....I expected so much more from this live show recorded off of BET televison.  This was not one of his best perfomances I am sure.  I was disappointed by his lack of professionalism performing some of his biggest hit songs.

Most people go to see a live show to hear the songs (in basic form) the original way an artist once recorded it.  Performers like the Eagles, Boz Scaggs, Tom Jones, Luther Vandross to name a few...deliver on that important performing aspect sounding like the ""original version"".  Mr. Womack did a poor job of making me believe he wanted to be there singing that night....he seemed to rather sit down and chat with the audience about his long career...instead of concentrating on singing really well.  His voice cut out on him many times and sounded powerless....he butchured much of his best material.

The sound quality of this DVD was just average as well....I was highly disappointed by it for many reasons....you may be too!",1141948800,8,1212,4.728571428571429
