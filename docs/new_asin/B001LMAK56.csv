How awful, I hope they get there act together I will not buy either of the new shows. Thanks for the reviews!",1235779200,,260,4.3061224489795915
3685885,2,B001LMAK56,"I am a huge Holly Hobbie fan. I loved the first 4 movies that came out. The characters were sweet and unique. The stories were different then the usual stuff you see out there and the voices were real sounding! Like the people in our own lives. The relationships between the youth and elderly were inspiring and heart warming. They had tradition, country living and old-fashioned charm with a modern twist. My daughter and I loved having girl time watching them together. I really loved them.

However, the two latest movies, Fabulous Fashion Show and Marvelous Makeover are a big disappointment. The voices are dreadful sounding. Making Robbie sound like a smoker, Holly, Carrie and Amy sound annoying and fake and KT sounds like someone trying to sound like they have a really bad cold. The stories are okay but they have lost their tradition and charm. They are now like everything else you see out there. Removing most of the older characters and the charm they brought to the show as well as removing the value of what someone with years behind them would offer. My daughter watched the new movie and asked what happened to Holly? She noticed right away that she sounded and looked different. She is disappointed as well. I'm sorry to see that this has happened to a really great series of movies and that the makers have chosen to go this route. I will not be purchasing these new movies if they continue like this.",1235088000,4,1421,4.661354581673307
3685886,3,B001LMAK56,"Well, The last two Holly DVDs had me wincing. Best Friends Forever was daft in plot, Fabulous Fashion Show pushed the show to jump the shark, and so I set my expectations low for this one.

I guess I could raise the bar a bit.

We'll start with the animation. Well, it's a little cleaner than before, and the backgrounds look a bit sharper, but still not as polished as the first movie- a lot of the detailed backgrounds i.e. scenes in Holly's room were rendered in monochrome, particularly crimson. However, in other scenes they were in full color but a little blurred. It's almost as if Sony outsourced animation to two different studios. Animation fluidity improved a little, but is in most cases still jerking and some lip-syncing problem is still visible.

For the music, sound and voices, well, Holly's speaking voice has improved somewhat (or maybe it's the human mind naturally adjusting to age, as after doing a comparison of the first movie and this, the difference becomes clear), but Robbie and Carrie's are still way off, which is a problem since both of them really doesn't sound like the last voice actors who played them at all, even if you try to psyche yourself into believing that the characters aged. The sound effect and incidental music, I have no qualms with them since they're true to those used in the first special and thus is up to par. The songs, however, no improvement from Fabulous Fashion Show. Holly's singing voice has a noticeably lower pitch than Holly's talking voice and that totally ruins the experience (no doubt, a check on the credits reveals that the songs were not performed by the character VAs, compared to the first movie, where Alyson Stoner did both the talking and singing voice). Alternatively, consider just using the songs as just part of a set of clip scenes and don't sync Holly's lips to it, that would work better. If you must imply that it's Holly that's singing, send Holly's VA for singing lessons if she can't sing. It would be much better for the show if the singing and talking voices are consistent. Also, here's an idea- ever heard of something called a pitch-shifter? It's a modern day equivalent of recording a song at a slower speed at normal voice in hopes of achieving a higher voice pitch at normal song speed. What, you've heard of it? Well, consider using one to fine tune Holly's singing voice so that it matches her talking voice.

Storyline-wise, the plot is much more reasonable than the last two. I could relate to the new girl, K.T. (I mean, come on, my nickname is a surefire giveaway!), and I admit: the trials and tribulations the girls went through were very, very realistic. Holly's character and personality is back on track. However, there are still some minor problems, particularly Amy and Carrie's personality drifted a bit through the first half of the first story, but apparently it was just to set up for the plot- they were back to normal by the end.

All in all, the series is getting back on track, but it's definitely still a long way from it's former glory. It would do Sony good if they could just pull things back together in time for the next release. However, I pretty much don't see it as likely to happen in such a short term.

One last thought on the movie: Holly moves to Clover, permanently. For some reason I have this gut feeling that they're setting things up for a TV series. Well, if they are: good luck, Sony. It'd do you better to fix up whatever flaws in the series first before going with the TV show idea. You have a little of my faith in the series back, don't waste it again.",1234742400,,3593,4.5800933125972

8318556,2,B001LMAK56,"I was sooo disappointed when my daughter and I watched the Marvelous Makeover dvd! I noticed right off the bat that Holly's voice sounded whiney and completely different, but hoped my daughter didn't. Unfortunately, the voice changes are even obvious to a 6 yr old!! My daughter and I are both HH fans, but I miss Holly's sweet voice from the previous films (the Christmas one is the favorite at our house!!) My daughter does still watch the dvd from time to time and the message in the movie is a good one, however the ""new"" voices are so distinct that it is hard to focus on the ""moral of the story."" I will continue to purchase future HH dvds for my daughter, but it's just not the same :(",1284854400,,692,4.3307692307692305
8318557,2,B001LMAK56,"What a disapointment ! My grandaughters noticed right away that the voice for Holly Hobbie was different.  Someone else recorded  this DVD.  Big turn off. Also the story was not done well.  Lots of girls being mean to other girls and this theme runs all thru the movie.  I had to return it, no  one liked it, but we all love the earlier Holly Hobbie's movie's",1277424000,,359,4.363636363636363
8318558,2,B001LMAK56,Me and my girls love the first four Holly Hobbie DVD's.  They have changed voices and animation and it is not the same enjoyable movies.  It is all most painful to watch.  Good story concept but poorly delivered and annoying.  Buy one of the first ones and you won't be disappointed but don't bother with this one.,1271635200,,314,4.456140350877193
8318559,4,B001LMAK56,"Good clean entertainment for young ladies.  My daughters (1 and 6) love it!
Caution though.  They changed the voice actors on this one from the originals, so your kids may complain its not real.  My daughter was pretty upset at first, but when I explained to her who making a cartoon works, she understood and was content.  Though I thought the voices were no where near as nice as before.",1262563200,,389,4.514285714285714
8318560,2,B001LMAK56,"We love the first four Holly Hobbie DVD's.  My kids have worn them out we watch them so much.  They are 4 and 5 often dance around singing the music and the acting out the stories.  I also enjoy the first installments so watching them for the millionth time is not painful.  I was excited when the new Fashion Show came out, but because of the horrible reviews, I skipped it.  The reviews for Marvelous Makeover were not as terrible so I thought I would give HH another try.

The cast of voices is noticeably different, just ask my 5 year old.  Alyson Stoner, who played Sarah Baker in the Cheaper By The Dozen movies is quite talented.  She was Holly's voice and performed the music.  The new Holly Hobbie voice by Nicole Bouma is different but tolerable.  The tragedy is that Mariella Piluso performs the singing voice, which is so obviously different from the speaking voice it gives the movie a cheesy low budget quality.  In fact, it is a completely new cast of actors doing the voices and the genuine quality I loved about the first installments of Holly Hobbie DVD's is gone.  Also, the story isn't great.  I agree with Joe-Sha the tradition and charm is gone.  The story line is common and Brenda Piluso has replaced the pervious writer's this time.  Mario Piluso has been the director of all the HH movies, but I am not sure if its nepotism or budget constraints that are ruining a very good children's franchise.  I am glad I got a good amazon price on this DVD.  I will not be seeking out these movies like I have previously, unless they return to their original quality.",1254182400,4,1582,4.475524475524476

8318562,5,B001LMAK56,My 6 year old daughter just finished watching this movie and loved it. She say's it has a good message to treat others nice.

My girls 3 & 5 love to watch them, which I am sure is a part of the target audience.  I would recommend them to anyone with kids under age 8 or 9 roughly.",1237248000,,285,3.8793103448275863
