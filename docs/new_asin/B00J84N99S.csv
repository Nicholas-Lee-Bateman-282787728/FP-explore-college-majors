6338244,5,B00J84N99S,"Hi Cynthia, I just finished the videos and  I am currently looking at other things on your site. Great information! You are a great teacher and I love knowing the why of things instead of just the point and click ""go buy this"" that some people think is what a new person is after. I hope you continue to have much success in your business and one day I hope to help others as you have.
Thanks,
Dominic Fowler",1395705600,,408,4.1645569620253164
6338245,5,B00J84N99S,"I purchased Cynthia Stines book and video and they were extremely helpful.  She walks you through every process.  She has a very calming voice and no nonsense way of teaching, which I needed.  For those of you (like me) who are overloaded with such much information to get started, Cynthia's video is the way to go.

I feel confident in going out and researching, buying and listing on Amazon.

Thank you Cynthia.",1395705600,3,413,4.680555555555555
6338246,5,B00J84N99S,"Wow, finally a clear and simple hands on approach to actually see where to start and the quick and easy tools that are used by a pro.  Cynthia is GREAT, very concise and takes the time to explain and demonstrate the process of getting started as a FBA seller.  I tried other programs only to find them lengthy and complicated.  I would recommend Cynthia's book and videos. She is a breath of fresh air in comparison!  Thank you, Cynthia!",1395878400,,437,4.493670886075949
6338247,5,B00J84N99S,"This video is highly recommended to anyone (not just newbies) doing retail arbitrage for their Amazon business.  I started scanning and sourcing 8 months ago - I would have had a way more productive start if I had this video and extra bonus information at that time.  I have educated myself with books, forums, Facebook groups and a coach, but there is nothing like watching an experienced, successful seller walking through a store actively sourcing and showing you where to look.

Cynthia also includes a video on setting up your shopping kit and using your scanning tools.

In addition to the videos, Cynthia has included written information on her favorite Big Box stores and tells you what to focus on when you are inside these stores. The price of this video and accompanying material will quickly pay for itself and put you in a profitable position if you act on it!",1395878400,,873,4.76158940397351
6338248,5,B00J84N99S,"Cynthia's video course is profesionally done and gets right to the point. I learned additional sourcing information that I thouhgt I already knew. Recommended for intermediate users as well. Hey...advanced users may even learn something.
Great info for the price.",1395878400,,263,5.6
6338249,5,B00J84N99S,Cynthia video is a very concise to the point video. Cynthia explains in detail all the questions that were omitted my other FBA training videos Cynthia answers the questions that you were wondering about but you would have to search for answers otherwise. Cynthia has a knack for explaining the intricate details so they can be easily understood by everyone the first time around. You don't have to buy additional material to get started selling on Amazon. The onsite shopping demo is the only one I have seen which shows how it is done in real life,1395792000,2,549,4.670103092783505
6338250,5,B00J84N99S,"If you want to get serious about your FBA business, then this video is a must have! Cynthia does a terrific job going step by step through the buying decision!",1395705600,,159,4.333333333333333
6338251,5,B00J84N99S,"I bought Cynthia Stine's book several months ago and is an excellent resource in getting started as a seller on Amazon.
The video is an excellent tool using the resources and how to shop the stores with your scanning device.
I would recommend buying both resources.",1395705600,2,265,4.782608695652174
6338252,5,B00J84N99S,"In beginning my new FBA business I bought and read a number of the recommended books and I acquired the necessary tools and resources to help me successfully find, price, list and ship my newly purchased products to Amazon. I thought I was ready to get after it but only after I found Cynthia's book and  in-store training video of an actual sourcing trip did it all come together. Watching her do it and explain how and why she did what she did took the mystery out of it. I had never seen or experienced the ""sourcing"" function and this gave me the confidence that I could actually do this and be successful with FBA. This is a ""must have"" for any FBA newbie.",1395705600,4,661,4.330645161290323
6338253,4,B00J84N99S,"Cynthia has done it again. She has helped the average person like me to break down what works and what doesn't in her new video. The video showed me things that I was personally doing wrong in my business and it also gave me new ideas that I hadn't thought of.
I found this video extremely helpful and grateful that Cynthia shares this information with others.",1395705600,2,360,4.46969696969697
6338254,5,B00J84N99S,"I have been frustrated with the ""Just scan everything!"" advice I have gotten from others.  This video and accompanying information gives a much more realistic look of what it takes to actually find things to sell and what some of the parameters are when you are looking at the scanning app info. I have spent hours in the stores scanning stuff and not finding anything. After watching this video I am ready to try again with some hope that I will have more success.",1395705600,4,465,4.535714285714286
6338255,5,B00J84N99S,"Lots of good, practical information.  I especially liked the store-by-store analysis of their strengths and weaknesses.  We've now been shopping retail stores for about three weeks and we're about to finish our third FBA shipment.",1395705600,2,230,5.542857142857143

8648705,1,B00J84N99S,"Very Expensive for what one gets, The video was mostly about her software she uses and very little about how to sell on Amazon.  Extremely disappointed!!!!!!  Waste of Money......",1418342400,,179,5.137931034482759
8648706,5,B00J84N99S,Very informative,1416528000,,16,7.5
8648707,5,B00J84N99S,"This is an excellent video of how the whole process of shopping at retail stores and selling on Amazon works.  If you want to know the nuts and bolts of how to...this is it!  Cynthia Stine has created the ultimate step by step course and everyone should get this product if they are wanting to be a serious FBA Seller on Amazon.
I will be watching this video over and over to be on top of my own business.  Thank you Cynthia for going the extra step to help others to completely understand what to do, how, why, and all the other questions that come along.",1404345600,,556,4.226415094339623
8648708,5,B00J84N99S,"I found the video very helpful, and I have been selling on Amazon FBA for about 1 year. It showed me several things that I was doing or thinking about in the wrong way.

Just the sections where she tells you what NOT to buy, or to be aware of, is worth the price... as it saves you time.

I recommend it highly.

8648709,5,B00J84N99S,"As an amazon seller myself, I was somewhat reluctant to purchase a training course on how to shop retail stores to resell on amazon as I was not sure how much practical information I would actually receive. I was not disappointed. Cynthia lays out a clear step by step course on how she shops retails stores and explains the tools and criteria she uses to determine whether a certain product would be profitable to resell or not.  The information she provided has increased my understanding on retail shopping and has opened my eyes to be able to see the vast amount of profitable products that are out there for resale if we are diligent enough to uncover them.",1396224000,,662,4.610169491525424
8648710,5,B00J84N99S,"Cynthia Stine is the real deal! Her video class is an honest and detailed look at how to make the best business decisions when purchasing inventory to sell on Amazon.  Ive read Cynthias book and blog (btw, highly recommend both) but watching her actually shop in a store and listening to her explain how to evaluate an on the spot buy or no buy decision for inventory items adds great insight into this process.  Cynthias guidance is direct and sensible and her genuine interest in helping others succeed shines through in this video.  Oh, and have to say I loved the pop quiz, Deal or No Deal?  give it a try!",1396224000,,610,4.468468468468468
8648711,4,B00J84N99S,"Very helpful. These videos not only reinforced what Cynthia has already written/outlined in her book...the audio/visual media form takes it to another level! I had already used Cynthia's book (and other materials) to start my business as an FBA Seller. And, I've been using the Serial IO Scanfob and ScanPower List and Mobile tools (etc.). So, I found the most useful video for me was the live-scouting one. It was essentially a live-action question and answer session. Excellent follow-on resource supplementing the book!",1396137600,,522,5.301204819277109
8648712,5,B00J84N99S,Just got done reviewing the videos from Cynthia and they are exactly what I needed. These videos are very informative and gave me the direction I was looking for. It showed me how to do the things I wasn't doing yet and reaffirmed to me the things I was doing letting me know that I was on the right track with my FBA business. Thank you Cynthia for some great guidance!,1396137600,,370,4.225352112676056
8648713,5,B00J84N99S,"Cynthia's Shop Retail Stores is such a gift!  In this course she explains how to shop retail stores to find inventory for your Amazon business and what supplies you may need to help you and how to use them.  She takes you throughout a typical store section by section with two of her students and shows you what products to look for, how to interpret the data, answers questions, and ultimately teaches you how to make money. Her course has given me the confidence I needed to add retail store sourcing to my Amazon FBA business.  Thank you for all you do!",1395964800,,556,4.431372549019608
