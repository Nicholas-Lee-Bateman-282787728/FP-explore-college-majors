The baritone is the only one who takes away from the performance as a whole, and not because Lucifer was intended for a bass, but because he sings rather poorly. A much better version of La Resurrezione is available from the Collegium 1704 web site in the Czech Republic and is well worth it.",1393977600,,418,4.371794871794871
8491575,5,B0062Z0PJI,"The Chiesa  del Gesu in Rome was a wonderful setting for this stellar performance on period instruments.  Videography is wonderful. The singers are strong, with the exception of the bass, Stefanos Koroneos.  He is a baritone, and a true bass would have been better.  Unfortunately no libretto was included with the DVD, but a copy can be found with an online search and can be downloaded in Italian and English.",1374710400,3,411,4.828571428571428
8491576,5,B0062Z0PJI,"I bought this without having read any reviews and was very pleasantly surprised. It has a 45 minute documentary which was both informative and interesting (including the filming of a visit to to Handel's birth place at Halle).
The performance is as authentic as one would wish, and the commitment from all the performers was first class.
This early oratorio tells the story between the crucifixion of Christ and his resurrection. It has the story told from the persepective of the metaphysical world, both a good angel and lucifer are cast, and also three followers of Christ are also invloved, from the physical plain.
The set includes with the DVD two CDs making it a bargain.
Don't hestitate to buy it.",1202428800,9,705,4.8347107438016526
