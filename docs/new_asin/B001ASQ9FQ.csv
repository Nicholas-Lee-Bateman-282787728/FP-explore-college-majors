8279539,4,B001ASQ9FQ,"Director Osamu Dezaki was a disciple of manga giant Osamu Tezuka, and after the death of Tezuka in 1989, got the chance to direct almost a dozen OAVs and a feature film based on Tezuka's renegade surgeon Black Jack.  By 2006 Dezaki, still working for Tezuka Productions, had undertaken a non-Tezuka project: a 26-week TV series, ""Hakugei"", loosely based on Herman Melville's ""Moby-Dick"".

How loosely?  This is a sci-fi update, set centuries in the future, when ""whales"" were wrecks and castoff spaceships, which yielded enough scrap and sometimes cargo to make salvage a nice living.  Hence the whale-hunters: aggressive scrap scavengers.  And one of the best-known is Ahab Ishmael Ali. who lost a leg and an eye to an encounter with ""Hakugei"", a derelict ship that resembles a white whale.

This series, in short, doesn't resemble Melville very much.  It is, however, a singular mix of drama and somewhat lowbrow humor.  Sometimes characters just start verbally riffing off of each other, in a Japanese style of stand-up comedy.  Most of the characters have a comic aspect to them, except for the villains.  Standing in for Queequeg is Barba, a huge (ten foot tall) native speaking broken English/Japanese (depending on which voice track you choose).

It's a mix of drama, comedy, pathos and action.  Not for Melville fans, but interesting on its own terms.",1337040000,2,1359,5.044843049327354

8279541,3,B001ASQ9FQ,"First off let me make clear that my review is coming from a 56 year old woman's point of view.  I've been watching anime for quite a while now and am looking for any anime that's more mature in nature (and I don't mean extreme violence or explicit sex) just something not too juvenile. I had seen a few episodes on the Anime Network on demand and thought this might be for me.  I noticed it seemed to be made by the same people that made Black Jack and I've enjoyed that very much.  So I ordered the complete series at a very good price.  The first dvd was alright, with some light humor but my main complaint is as the series went on well into the 26 episodes it got cartoonish to the degree that I was fast forwarding it just to get through it.  There were some story lines in it that were very good in particular I liked the romance between the two androids.  Maybe a younger person would enjoy the mayhem but I found it ridiculous.",1237766400,6,935,4.166666666666667
