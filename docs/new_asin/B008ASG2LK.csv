8573443,4,B008ASG2LK,"If a drummer wants to learn how to play effectively with the brushes, this DVD and included poster would be a very good place to start. Florian is a very talented player, and applies brushes in some very non-traditional settings - even up-tempo rock music. So he should be able to get the attention of young players who could benefit greatly by discovering this nearly lost art form. I did not give the DVD 5 stars because the disc behaved in some unexpected ways when played. I watched some of it with a TV and DVD player and some of it on a laptop with DVD drive. In both cases, I had some difficulty getting from the menu to segments that I wanted to watch. The disc navigation was not tested thoroughly enough before the product was considered complete. However, the instructional material is good, and the artistic presentation of the video is engaging.",1407110400,,858,4.577922077922078
