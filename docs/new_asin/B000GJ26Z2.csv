8133156,5,B000GJ26Z2,Kay is a genius at the northern laugh. This is a weird little montage but worth watching.......Worth buying for sure.,1387843200,,117,4.9
8133157,3,B000GJ26Z2,"I looked forward to ""Phoenix Nigjhts"" with great expectations and I was disappointed.
Being a British emigre from the north of England, the reports were most impresive.  I missed the humour of the English north and I felt this would revive my memories ---- but it didn't !  I found the humour unbalanced, at times coarse, and certainly consistently unreal.  I wish it had been otherwise since I was ready for a taste of home but it turned out to be just a fill-up for the evening.",1371600000,,480,4.494252873563219
8133158,5,B000GJ26Z2,"This box set contains both series of the fantastically funny Phoenix Nights, including goof reel. Phoenix Nights is set in a Working Men's Club called (funnily enough) The Phoenix Club, which is in Bolton (Peter Kay's home town), each episode is a bit of a stand alone story but its best watched in the order of the dvd. The owner of the Phoenix is Brian Potter (Kay) who is obsessed with making money and making the Phoenix Club the best club in 'Clubland', and he cuts all sorts of corners to make this happen, much to the detriment of the rest of his staff.
The characters throughout this show are all well rounded and you do find yourself caring about what happens to them, from the doormen to the bar staff, they are all excellent.
The comedy is very english, and a little bit cringing, but if you are anything like me its 'laugh out loud'.
this is the best comedy show of its time from the UK. definately not to be missed.",1351209600,,928,4.369942196531792
8133159,5,B000GJ26Z2,"I got no clue of a blood relation between a nightclub business wheelchair-bound shark Brian Potter and world-famous Harry Potter, but either does miracles in own field of expertise, also this two-season two-disc work reflects the modern UK less sci-fictionally than wizard story, and surely not so rude as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shameless/dp/B0045K8XVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shameless</a>"" or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Britain/dp/B000UPMZ4O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Britain</a>"" do.

This semi-tragic comedy is a half-cast of something like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/54/dp/B004SEUJXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">54</a>"" with conservative guidelines on a family day out.",1350518400,,827,9.209876543209877
