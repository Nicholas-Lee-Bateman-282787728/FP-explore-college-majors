8048432,5,B0007LPSAE,"Interesting stories  with, last but not least, Anthony Perkins who comment them with his wonderful sense of humour. Great !",1447027200,,123,5.15
8048433,5,B0007LPSAE,An old series about unpleasant people coping with each other. That's a recipe for awful things to happen. The introduction is by Anthony Perkins - what could be better.,1404518400,,168,4.827586206896552
8048434,3,B0007LPSAE,Anthony Perkins hosts these short stories. I would not call them Chillers. The short stories were filmed in Europe with European and American actors. I would equate them more with short stories the I have seen in Tales of the Unexpected stories.,1386979200,,245,4.857142857142857
8048435,5,B0007LPSAE,"I knew nothing of Patrica Highsmith (The novels, ""Strangers on a Train"", ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"") before seeing this series. Very similar to ""Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected"", but with a early 1990's feel, much like the Ray Bradbury series of the same period. It's well written, and peopled by many talented actors. Apparently only 12 episodes were produced. I'd love to have seen 12 more! As best as I can determine, it was produced in France, with English actors & crews. And Anthony Perkins as the Hitchcockian narrator? He's a joy! He was so capable of putting a sly twist on a phrase, and all the time with a devilish gleam in his eye. What a fantastic coup to have this talented iconic man here! He gives these well produced episodes an extra boost. I gave this series 5 stars because it achieved what it tried to do, and I really just enjoyed the hell out of them. Anyway, buy them! You can pick these shows up for next to nothing, and I can't imagine that you'll be disappointed.",1347580800,,994,4.497237569060774
