Learning that he had muscular dystrophy when he was a tender teenager and knowing it could never be cured, Brett chose a path rarely taken. He, somewhat from necessity, chose the positive route. He loves humor, music, nature, learning, something not denied to a person because of his physical weakness and therefore available to all of us.
You will love Brett, as I do. I'm Brett's mom.",1301011200,3,475,4.804878048780488
8356734,5,B0028RXZVY,"Given Brett Leake's disability (""A degree in Economics"" as he says in the film), one might assume his physical appearance would distract from his comedy. To the contrary, he is first and foremost, hilarious. Although stricken with Muscular Dystrophy, a progressive disease that affects his body, his mind is as sharp as his wit, and both are celebrated within this very good documentary film.

Director Ken Sons, a professional comedian himself, brings a performer's timing and pacing to the film. Knuckleball is about laughter and love, as Brett's family (whom we meet and grow to admire in the film) encourage and support him in this journey. And what a journey it has been! The pinnacle for any aspiring comedian is an appearance on The Tonight Show. Brett has appeared on that national stage six times! His spirit and will to make people laugh in the face of adversity is nothing short of life-changing, and this movie brings Brett's inspiring message home with humor and heart.

The title of the film alludes to Brett's youth when he would throw a pitch called knuckleball. Such a pitch, when thrown well, has no spin and thus dips, dances and ""takes its own path"" to the plate. As Brett tells his story of letting go and trusting, as he did when throwing his favorite pitch, we are better for having heard it. Brett's ""life well-lived,"" the one that ""takes its own path,"" as documented in this entertaining and inspiring film, is simply wonderful to witness.",1242864000,2,1464,4.828685258964144
8356735,5,B0028RXZVY,"Knuckleball is a spirit-lifting experience that focuses on triumphing over challenges. At the start you meet stand-up comic Brett Leake and enter the world of MS. However, you  soon you find yourself forgetting the illness and laughing at an expert stand-up who just happens to sit down. Leake's professionalism and talent is well-known in the comedy world but it took someone like Director Ken Sons (also a respected comic) to make it this real.

Don't let the subject matter turn you off, because this films isn't really about MS. It's about meeting any challenge that life brings. Brett Leake isn't the funniest ""handicapped comic."" He's one of funniest comics out there despite his illness.

Leake also works clean and this movie is appropriate for the entire family. Buy this movie and play it whenever you need a dose of hope. And go see Brett Leake live - it's a great time.",1242604800,4,881,4.821192052980132
