5559380,4,B00B5G433S,"Reviewed by Amanda Jane Volovik ""Chava"": If you're interested in obscure pre-serial killers or the 'dawn of serial killers', I would give it a watch. Homosexual serial killing is also not a subject that is touched on often in documentaries, and the genesis of how a homosexual serial killer develops is revealed here. Also, this is about a period of history that is very interesting and history lovers will also appreciate this aspect.",1376179200,8,435,4.972602739726027
5559381,5,B00B5G433S,"The story of Carl Panzram is one of destruction and hatred. Panzram was a product of a cruel and hurtful society that created a monster beset to wreak havoc on those who crossed the path of the monster.

Borowski has once again, following on from the superb films HH Holmes and Albert Fish, transported the viewer to a ring side seat of serial murder, rape and destruction. In an atmosphere akin to the highly acclaimed Shawshank Redemption, Panzram is a film and documentary rolled into one that has the viewer tasting the spite that dripped from Panzram's tongue.  Shawshank Redemption took the viewer on a journey into the companionships of prison life, Carl Panzram takes that tenderness and slaughters it.

The tragic protagonist of Panzram is living and breathing, spitting in the face of his jailers as well as the viewer, he is brought to life by brilliant acting and voice casting, that is coupled by a collection of experts on the complex aspects of the serial killer's life.

Having viewed hundreds of films of serial killers it is easy to say that Borowski's films are a fantastic mesh of drama and documentary that are second to none in quality and research. He has once again reinforced that, when done well, serial killer docudramas can be a compelling and chilling viewing.",1371945600,5,1289,4.819004524886878
5559382,5,B00B5G433S,"Fascinating, well-made film.  Underrated too, since I can't even find it on Flixter or Rotten Tomatoes.  Watched it because it was recommended by comedian Bill Burr.  And he was right!  Excellent documentary!",1367107200,4,208,5.40625
5559383,5,B00B5G433S,"Things may have been different for Carl Panzram if he hadn't ended up in the prison system at an early age. Panzram is much like Frankenstein's Monster, a creature created by humanity that ends up on a path of destruction based on the treatment and rejection from the same humanity (society) that gave it life.

John Borowski's CARL PANZRAM: THE SPIRIT OF HATRED AND VENGEANCE is a great vehicle for learning about Panzram and what made him the violent, yet strangely introspective and iron-willed man that he was. The interviews are excellent and the use of veteran voice actor John DiMaggio as the voice of Panzram was a great choice. Also, artist Joe Coleman is always a welcome addition to any documentary.

Check out this great documentary and learn about one of the most fascinating and deadly figures in the history of the United States. We created him, we killed him, but we can still learn from him.",1361145600,3,908,4.7405063291139244
5559384,5,B00B5G433S,"At long last, Panzram's colorful life story - and his views, inseparable from it - became the subject of a feature-length documentary. The long wait ultimately paid off because Panzram got the treatment he deserved from John Borowski, independent filmmaker and author of two previous, equally superb documentaries on America's serial killers from the late 19th and early 20th century:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/H-H-Holmes-America-s-First-Serial-Killer/dp/B0002XL1NU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">H.H. Holmes - America's First Serial Killer</a>&nbsp;(2004) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Albert-Fish/dp/B001PVG4VC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Albert Fish</a>&nbsp;(2007). This means that Panzram ended in truly devoted and more than able hands. The resulting film, CARL PANZRAM: THE SPIRIT OF HATRED AND VENGEANCE, is a true paradigm of how to make a great documentary on a subject like this.

Borowski presents Panzram from as many angles as possible. Understandably, his hands are somewhat tied by the fact that Panzram lived in the early decades of the 20th century (he was executed in 1930), which means that there are no living witnesses, no current first-hand accounts, no direct video or film footage of him or scenes relevant for his deeds. Borowski had to rely on the few existing photographs, news clippings and facsimiles of Panzram's writings. The closest he comes to a direct footage is an archive interview with Henry Lesser, ex-prison guard: the only person ever to treat Panzram like a human being and the one who made him write his autobiography, smuggling and preserving his papers later on. Without Lesser we wouldn't have any record whatsoever of a rich and inspiring human being that Carl Panzram certainly was. This interview exists only on a poor quality VHS cassette, but it's a valuable document and the worthiest asset among the extras on the DVD.

What he couldn't get through direct footage, Borowski more than compensates with the use of said photographs and writings, but also through archive film materials from the period and, especially, through brief but colorful re-enactments. Three actors portray Panzram in the three crucial stages of his life: Brett Jetmund plays Charlie Panzram in his formative, pre-teen years, David Salmonson is the young Carl Panzram (in his 20s, when he did most of his killings) and Tom Lodewyck plays the somewhat older Carl Panzram as an inmate of various prisons before he was hanged at the age of 38. The perfect cast does a great job of embodying the abused abuser, ""the spirit of meanness personified"" but also the human being behind the mask of a monster.

Another layer of quality is added by the narration by John Dimaggio (best known as the voice of Bender from FUTURAMA): he reads numerous well-chosen quotes from Panzram's writings using a grave whisper somewhat reminiscent of Kiefer Sutherland's ""psycho"" voice.

The film provides an insight into the conditions which created this ""monster"", trying to understand his crimes without justifying them. This is a tricky thing: defending a person (as a victim of various circumstances) without defending his crimes, without glorifying him or turning him into a hero. Panzram's spirit of total negativity can be hypnotic and attractive for modern-day nihilists: his attitude of an almost Burroughsian TOTAL OUTLAW is very inspiring while many of his saying are highly quotable. Still, this shouldn't make us forget that this man has raped and killed at least 22 men. Especially unforgivable are his brutal rapings and killings of several pre-teen boys. They are mentioned in the film, briefly, but only in passing, while Panzram's cold-hearted reminiscences of them are NOT quoted. This is a pity, because paragraphs such as this one shouldn't be glossed over:
""I grabbed him by the arm and told him I was going to kill him. I stayed with the boy about three hours. During that time, I committed sodomy on the boy six times, and then I killed him by beating his brains out with a rock... I had stuffed down his throat several sheets of paper out of a magazine. I left him lying there with his brains coming out of his ears.""
This is the kind of crimes that earned him the label of a monster, much more than the one single killing (of an abusive prison employee) which eventually led him to the gallows. Other than that, the film does a fine job of balancing the life and times of this man and of putting him into a proper context. Panzram certainly was and is a telling sign of an age. Many bigger social, psychological, ethical and philosophical issues are reflected in and around him: from (in)human treatment of prisoners through the problem of psychopaths all the way to the questions of good and evil, right and wrong, human laws vs. higher laws... A big help in shedding some light on those questions comes from a superb selection of a wide array of relevant participants who talk on camera.
Thus, the documentary includes valuable insights from SCOTT CHRISTIANSON, PhD, author, investigative reporter, and scholar who specializes in crime and punishment; JOE COLEMAN, artist who has painted a portrait of Carl Panzram, who he sees as a ""kind of unholy saint of nihilism: the very shadow of Christ""; MARK GADO, a police detective whose story ""Carl Panzram, Monster of Minnesota"" (2004) won a Page One award for one of the top three magazine articles of the year; DR G. THOMAS GITCHOFF, a criminologist and professor of criminal justice at San Diego State University and associate clinical professor of psychiatry at SDSU School of Medicine in La Jolla;
JOEL GOODMAN, Federal Bureau of Prisons Retiree, an expert on jail, prison and community corrections operations; KENNETH LAMASTER, Leavenworth Penitentiary Historian; CHARLES DUDLEY MARTIN, Robert Stroud's Missouri Attorney; ROBERT RAY, Head of Special Collections and University Archives at San Diego State University which holds the original, handwritten Carl Panzram Papers; JASON SCHUBERT, curator of the J.M. Davis Gun Museum (which keeps several Panzram related paraphernalia, including the rope he was hanged by, and last but not least - KATHERINE RAMSLAND, PhD who has a master's degree in forensic psychology from the internationally esteemed John Jay College of Criminal Justice, a master's degree in clinical psychology from Duquesne University, and a Ph. D. in philosophy from Rutgers. She has published thirty-one books, including The CSI Effect, Inside the Minds of Serial Killers, The Human Predator, and The Forensic Science of CSI.

With their contributions CARL PANZRAM: THE SPIRIT OF HATRED AND VENGEANCE becomes as layered a story of the unique individual of Carl Panzram as one could possibly hope for.

Clocking at 80 minutes, the film could certainly use some more material without being overlong or repetitive. The extra features on the DVD actually contain many scenes which could've been used in the film. For example, most of the DELETED SCENES (approx 10 minutes of them) deserve to be IN the film itself, as they contain telling information and add further shades of Panzram's character (esp. the issue of being TRUTHFUL and /not/ honoring his word).

MAKING OF feature (approx 25 minutes) also contains at least 15 minutes' worth of material that could've been IN the film. It has very little actual footage of making of the film - instead, it offers many additional pieces of interviews and re-enactments not seen in the film proper. INTERVIEW WITH HENRY LESSER (approx 45 minutes), like said above, is a priceless document and a more than welcome addition to the DVD (although most of the best bits are used in the film itself).
Other extras include: PRODUCTION STILLS (accompanied by a song about Panzram), TRAILERS and a DETAILED VIEW OF JOE COLEMAN'S PANZRAM PORTRAIT (which is helpful indeed, considering this artist's style of collage with numerous very tiny and minute details, photos, drawings and quotes otherwise hard to decipher).

CARL PANZRAM: THE SPIRIT OF HATRED AND VENGEANCE is obviously a work of devotion, love and knowledge, self-financed and created among hardships which, thankfully, don't show up on screen. It manages to become the definite story about this unique man - and to show why his story is still relevant and haunting.

Strongly recommended!

Holmes and Albert Fish are hard to beat, Panzram is visually exceptional and is well researched. This is independent film making at its best. The extras on the DVD are also outstanding. If you are interested in historical documentaries, serial killers, psychology, or just great entertainment--this film is for you! John Borowski is the Ken Burns of serial killers and his films are outstanding. Do yourself a favor and watch this film!",1359676800,13,571,5.150537634408602

5559389,4,B00B5G433S,"Very interesting and does give a glimpse into what people r capable of and possibly why. Of course it could have partial lies as I believe the film makers where only able to substatiate only some of the claims.

It does give a good history of our penal system and 1 that i think should be taught in school (this was substaintiated). I think we perform a diservice to our citizens when we primarily teach the finer points of our history and sweep the darker parts under the rug like it was never done.",1479600000,3,500,4.319148936170213
5559390,5,B00B5G433S,"By far the best of the Borowski movies in my opinion.  I didn't know much at all about Panzram, but this movie was very informative.  The story of how he became such a sadistic killer was almost as sad as what pain he dealt out to others.  Loved this one!",1475971200,,255,4.06
5559391,5,B00B5G433S,"This is really worth watching. It is compelling and disturbing. He was shackled by his neck to his cell. Freed slaves who were in jail also shackled by their neck. A story that shows the failure of the system!! Except one very young brave guard who interviewed Carl, which made it possible for us as the viewers to see how sometimes the system fails a little boy, then shows us how he turns into a brutal killer. Carl said, (after the first time he had a cot in a cell alone) he said..""if just one person would of listened and allowed me a cot and leave me alone ...I would not of hurt anyone!!!!!",1474934400,,597,4.245614035087719
5559392,4,B00B5G433S,"Well made.  Wow.  Panzram writes his life story.  Very sad.  As a juvenile he was treated harshly, and that harshness continues throughout most of his life, fanning that ""spirit of hatred and vengeance.""  Panzram wonders, as I'm sure society wonders, what could have been if he'd been treated humanely.  Dark content, but interesting in that the time period involved touches on Alcatraz and Robert Stroud's name comes up, as the most famous inmate (Birdman of Alcatraz).  Good film, but may be too dark and harsh for some.",1474848000,3,522,4.931034482758621
5559393,5,B00B5G433S,"Another great documentary! I have honestly never heard of him, so it was very interesting to learn about him. Yes, he was pretty awful, but he seemed smart enough to know what made him the way he was. To think if he had maybe been shown love and kindness, he might off been different. After all the atrocious things he did it was the kindness of one prison guard, that got him to write his story. A very interesting story it was. Looking forward to more documentaries from you!",1471651200,,477,4.370786516853933

Some crimes are to gruesome to want to know more about after viewing once. This ones close but nothing like an Albert Fish.
I would also recommend the six episode Death Row that has a segment about Panzram.

What falls a bit short here are the theatrics and reenactments - the gruff, raspy narration is distracting and over the top, and at least one of the commentators doesn't seem to have credentials at all related to the telling.

It's interesting, but so little of the history can be researched or proven that it remains only fluff or speculation. As the commentators themselves note, much it cannot be disproven... but by the same token, cannot be proven.",1417996800,,666,4.732758620689655

5559412,4,B00B5G433S,"This is definitely not a typical serial killer documentary. It reads more like a cautionary tale directed to the American penal system; which in 1928 was definitely not all it could, or should have been. It's a sad tale of a man's brutal reactions to years of abuse, and although, one can admire his bravado in the face of violence, and we see, at times, (through his own journals) someone almost eloquent, there is also a question, if, given his propensity for braggadocio, if he even committed half the crimes he confessed to? A fellow prisoner at Leavenworth, the actual ""Bird-Man of Alcatraz"" goes so far as to opine that his (Panzram's) claims are ridiculous to anyone who has first hand knowledge of such things. I thoroughly enjoyed it; but did not give it 5 stars, because I was left feeling slightly dissatisfied. I was not uncomfortable with the somewhat sympathetic treatment of the subject, but felt that, having chosen to treat the subject this way, in a large part because,  ""if a man, knowing he is ""bad"" , and knowing he has done only ""bad"", wishes only for death, because he finds life itself (not the conditions of Leavenworth prison, which by his own admission he quite enjoyed) intolerable, doesn't that go a long way in toward proving that this individual is perhaps spiritually, or mentally sick, as opposed to sociopathic?
