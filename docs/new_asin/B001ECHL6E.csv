Andre Omgang is a funny comedy centred around a father and his two sons Sverre and Erik who are fulltime fans of their football club Skeid. We see them setting off on journeys around Norway in a true fan's effort to support their team. We also see into the home lives of all three. Erik is going through a divorce now that he has met another woman, Sverre and his wife are finding life different now that their son has left home and decide to invite a couple around for a swingers evening, while their father joins a singles club as his wife is in a nursing home suffering from Alzheimers. All three men are aware that their best years are past them and now are in their Andre Omgang (Second Half) of their lives.
Don't expect laugh a minute, but there are some funny situations which the characters find themselves in.
The DVD is entirely in Norwegian with English subtitles throughout.",1333324800,,1039,4.531914893617022
