7903249,3,B0000042C3,"The production was filmed in 1974 at what looks like an outdoor setting, using many camera angles ranging from close-ups peering into Freni's eyeballs to strange shots of people fading into fuzzy distance.  It is as though the person in charge of filming was intent on making a movie unto itself, subsuming the opera performance..  This recording is a chance to see and hear Domingo and Freni early in their careers and they were superb.",1458864000,,437,4.8133333333333335

7903251,2,B0000042C3,"While this production does have possibly some of the best singing of any, I had to wonder whether the director purposely intended to make some sort of comic parody or caricature of Puccini's opera... A number of unfortunate choices in staging, costuming, and characterization made it all but impossible  to take the characters or their tragic situation seriously... Goro looked like some great buffoonish clown, and Cio-Cio-San's mother like a vacant-minded old hag; not one of the characters seemed remotely Japanese to me...The overall effect seemed closer to farce, or mockery, than high drama and serious tragedy appropriate to the story.
Worst of all, for me, the consul Sharpless, presumably the moral backbone or conscience of the piece, manages to come off nearly as spinelessly degenerate as Pinkerton himself. When Goro offers to show him his selection of mail-order brides, so far from ""laughingly declining""- as the script indicates- he puts on his spectacles; he asks Butterfly about whether she ""has any sisters"", with a grin and a twinkle that would have had me wanting to lock my own baby sister away somewhere safe (one rather wonders why he bothers to warn Pinkerton against toying with his marriage and his bride, at all); he puffs distractedly away at a cigarette while trying to read Pinkerton's letter. One of the more affecting incidental details of the 1996 film version by Mitterand (Troxell and Huang) is toward the end when Sharpless takes away a bottle from Pinkerton with which he, Pinkerton, has been dosing himself when he realizes what he's done; here, however, it is the consul who is seen fortifying himself in the crisis with the contents of a similar bottle.
All in all, I could not find anything in this film to recommend it- beyond, again, some excellent singing, which its negative points for me far outweighed. I found it an embarrassing travesty of Puccini's masterpiece.",1023062400,12,1912,5.050632911392405
7903252,5,B0000042C3,"Believe this to be the oldest video/film of this opera of any quality.  Both Freni and Domingo were in their 30's and wonderful together. All the costumes and singing excellent. I liked the directing as well.  The sets simple and lovely with a flashback beginning which was very different at the time it was made.  I have many of videos, film and stage, made in subsequent years and none of them can begin to compare with this version.  Freni will make you cry and Domingo is the overweight, if attractive heel that Pinkerton is supposed to be.  I've seen it many times in person with many different singers and this video always comes to mind in comparison.  Buy this Butterfly and enjoy the wonderful music full of Puccini's sentimentality!  This is also a great gift for a newbie.",996537600,47,783,4.630434782608695
