2472177,4,B000CRR3GA,"Our local chapter of the English-Speaking-Union of the US has an annual contest for high-school students who must deliver a Shakespearean soliloquy and a sonnet. This DVD shows the nuts and bolts of how such an end-point is reached. But it is not in a well-endowed Eastern high-school peopled predominantly by students with  English-sounding names who can trace their heritage back to English ""Public-school-educated""  immigrants, as many of our local students are proud to do. It is in the Hobart public school in Los Angeles County, located not far from Watts, and filled with children whose parents were Mexican immigrants, or whose name had been originally bestowed on African slaves. Yet their inspired teacher has decided ""What's in a name?"" He is obsessed with the duty af a teacher to find and grow that spark of creativity which is deep in every child, and fan it with pages from the greatest of English dramatist until an all-consuming flame bursts out and ignites all within reach.  He does this not only by engulfing them in the Complete Works, but by bussing them to where many of the the most splendid creations of the American mind can be seen; from Washington to South Dakota so that they can raise the context of their aspirations to the highest possible level. By becoming Shakespearians they find the ""will"" to answer's life's challenge:""To be or not to be?""",1170720000,8,1377,4.901287553648069
2472178,5,B000CRR3GA,"In this enormously entertaining and moving DVD, Rafe Esquith emerges as a remarkable teacher, the rare sort who combines the ability to amuse students with the will to hold them to the highest standards. His fifth grade class at Hobart Elementrary is shown as mostly eager to rise to the challenges he poses. Such a two-way educational street leads to magical results. These include not only reading the very books (e.g. ""Huck Finn,"" ""To Kill A Mockingbird,""etc.) most students don't encounter until high school, but even putting on a Shakespeare play each year. Not surprisingly, as we learn toward the end of the DVD, many of his students in later years go on to the finest colleges and universities.",1167004800,11,702,4.907563025210084

2472181,5,B000CRR3GA,"One teacher takes a group of kids from the roughest neighborhoods and not only gets them to put on a production of Hamlet each year but teaches them to learn, grow and believe in themselves, day in, day out. It isn't  easy and the challenges are shown in detail but this teacher also shares his philosophy - and what a philosophy it is! He admits that he failed in his first years of teaching, watching as his former students failed in middle school.

  But somehow he recreated his teaching method and, in the process, has inspired countless children, gotten actors like Ian McKellan and Michael York to visit his classroom (!) and taught children who'd had teachers give up on them that they were not doomed to failure. If more teachers were like this one, what a future generation we'd have!

2472195,5,B000CRR3GA,"This inspiring documentary features the fifth-grade classroom of teacher Rafe Esquith,  who clearly makes a difference in his students' lives.  Most of them are Asian or Latino, and the school is in a rough neighborhood in Los Angeles.  Part of Rafe's core curriculum is Shakespeare, and each year his fifth-grade class performs one of Shakespeare's plays.  Visitors to the class are such luminaries as Ian McKellen and Michael York, who share scenes and discuss the plays with the students.  The students weep as they read Huckleberry Finn.  They all learn to play guitar.  They are treated with respect and no-nonsense firmness when needed.  The film isn't long (less than an hour) and every minute is inspiring.

He makes you laugh as you read about his trials and tribulations as a teacher but most of all I wanted to be in 5th grade again, in his class. He is a wonderful teacher is is one of the few that I aspire to be like.  Every child should have a teacher as inspired.",1357344000,,394,3.9125

It is inspiring, compassionate, and discusses how to give students the resources and motivation they need to aim high in life and live up to their potential.  The author is one of the hardest-working people in education who is a superb role model.  His message to cultivate the minds and hearts of all students and not give up on them despite their circumstances challenges the entire educational system to do better.

He sometimes works 4 jobs simultaneously to underwrite extracurricular class activities.

During filming a class through an entire academic year, the school is locked down from violence in the neighborhood. Rafe reassures the children they will not be allowed to walk home alone until the school is confident the children can be safe. Rafe turns to the camera sadly commenting on how calmly the children accept the news; violence and drugs are so familiar in their lives they resignedly keep themselves occupied until the lockdown terminates.

Rafe establishes a Saturday Academy after children graduate from 5th grade to middle school bullying, peer pressure and academic discouragement, so middle schoolers may revisit the friendly atmosphere which celebrates their aspirations toward excellence.

The last day of 5th grade Rafe responds to tears of farewell by enthusing about this as the start of exciting future moments. 5th grade is a single moment beginning a life of meaning based on courtesy and dedicated hard work. The other moments to come he helps them to see as even more challenging and rewarding to their honest striving, humiliry and compassion.

Rafe nurtures effort, curiosity, questioning and caring among children of immigrant visa holders. Immigrants may experience discrimination:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frontline-A-Class-Divided-PBS-Video/dp/B000XPAFGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frontline: A Class Divided (PBS Video)</a>&nbsp;documentary of a third grade experiment in bullying.  Paul Nurse Nobel Prize winning geneticist, President of Rockefeller University was rejected for a green card because of his birth certificate. Rafe helps these English as a second language children become Americans, appreciating hard won freedom and rewards for personal discipline.

The documentary follows a class none of whom speak English at home. Hobart Asian and Hispanic 5th graders are exposed to the hush of a university library by Rafe who asks: who would like to study in a place like this someday? The children are in awe. He confides: YOU can get here, but there are no shortcuts, only hard work.

When children try to share test answers, he speaks confidentially, respecting their privacy, pointing out that they only shortchange themselves by attempting shortcuts. He role models courteous adult conversation. Rafe projects an attitude of faith in their capacity to discover solutions to problems through restraint, hard work and individual reflection&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dhamma-Brothers/dp/B0040J1RZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dhamma Brothers</a>.

Esquith's classroom economy is based on earning [fake] money for attending class each day, paying for seats closer to the front of the room, paying a $50 penalty for not doing homework, bidding at auction for a Gibson guitar at the end of the year. Rafe: if I don't come to work, I don't get paid. Math is real.

The children play music at Gettysburg, as background for Shakespeare's Hamlet, experience American culture through Halloween and Christmas parties at Rafe's home where the children share, cooperate, clean up after themselves, receive book gift certificates as their sole Christmas gifts, playing the equitable American game baseball.

The children learn skepticism, challenge authority using scientific thinking (Huck decides to turn Jim in, the correct thing to do, right?), make decisions balancing options, engage in shared inquiry and moral deliberation, work hard to learn (classroom discipline is being prohibited from participating in class learning), critical thinking based on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Junior-Great-Books-Discussion-Program-for-Elementary-High-School-Students-Series-Five-Complete-Set-of-5-Books-Crane-Virgil-Gogol-Sutcliff-Euripides-Bennett-Blake-Melville-Bunyan-Moliere-Twaine/dp/B001QO57HK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Junior Great Books Discussion Program for Elementary & High School Students: Series Five Complete Set of 5 Books (Crane, Virgil, Gogol, Sutcliff, Euripides, Bennett, Blake, Melville, Bunyan, Moliere, Twaine +)</a>.

Scientific thinking slowly improves the mind through continuous questioning, testing, assessment of results and revision of successive approximations. Rafe Esquith provides the children an ethical foundation for respecting themselves and others, honest intellectual inquiry and effortful pursuit of making a difference. He role models integrity, honesty, dignity, compassion: I've told them Hobart Elementary is where possibility happens, if I were to leave then I'd be a hypcrite. Esquith rejects offers to teach elsewhere.

Rafe also understands that you cannot reach every child: 1/3 will ""get it"", 1/3 will be unsure, 1/3 will resist and try to disrupt the classroom. Your job is to move the 1/3 who are unsure toward those who are enthusiastic, so the disruptive third will be less likely to prevent the other 2/3 from learning.

5 stars highly recommended documentary 50minutes with special features, observing a human being who admirably tries to create productive humane Americans one classroom at a time.

With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.

2472201,5,B000CRR3GA,"This documenatary was recommended by a parent/teacher. I am a fifth grade teacher and I teach a unit on Shakespeare each year. I thought this was going to be more about teaching Shakespeare or a play about kids doing Shakespeare, but it is not. It's more about a teacher who works with inner-city kids and how he inspires them to do great things. I loved his approach and his message that there are no shortcuts in life- you must do the work! I highly recommend this documenary- especially for teachers. I shared this with my principal and she wants to show it at the beginning of next school year as a motivational tool.  I believe every teacher should watch this documentary each year as a reminder that each child can do great things and we (teachers) are the key!",1304726400,3,767,4.517985611510792
2472202,3,B000CRR3GA,"There are many important principles about excellence in teaching that are demonstrated by this film.  For example, that ""EXPECTATIONS is all""  (to bend a phrase from Hamlet). An excellent teacher has an abiding faith that high expectations, properly managed across individual students, are inspiring and motivating to children. Excellent teaching is a very specialized skill and requires much hard work (and should be justly compensated as such... but that is another issue).
HOWEVER, it is misleading to call these kids ""inner city"" kids.  These are the first generation children of new immigrants to this country who are highly motivated to have their children succeed.  These are not kids from families that have grown up in 'the projects' for generations - who have little hope and no role models, etc.  Having said that, I do think the basic principles may still apply - it will just take a whole lot more faith in the inner strength and resilience of the children that show up in your classroom.
It was sad to hear how other teachers in the schhol really did not appreciate Rafe very much.  I can understand it though.  Rafe probably has 35 kids or so in his class?  In a 2,300 student elementary, there must be more than one 5th grade class. How do student's get assigned to Rafe's class?  Do the other 5th grade classrooms benefit at all from Rafe's 501c3 corporation and the significant donations he gets to enable his 35 students to go on 2 major field trips each year?  Seems like the first order of business for Rafe should be trying to scale his methods across his own school or at least across all the 5th grades.  Has he tried?",1298764800,4,1642,4.726315789473684

2472204,4,B000CRR3GA,The main point of this documentary that really had an impact was how much a teacher can accomplish with his or her students when they really care about their students and take the time to invest in their students.

The ""Be nice, work hard, do your best"" message hits home with everyone I've shared it with.  Our teachers were inspired, to say the least.  There were more than a few tears throughout the hour.
The only thing I could quibble with is the blurb, ""starring Ian McEllen and Michael York.""  They were definitely highlights, but the real stars in this film were Rafe and those kids!",1235174400,3,524,4.788888888888889
2472206,5,B000CRR3GA,"This terrific documentary about an extraordinary human being who happens to be a teacher is wonderfully inspiring for everyone.  It will undoubtably have special value to other teachers and lovers of Shakespeare but we can all be heartened and encouraged by seeing the degree of committment and effort that Rafe Esquith shows while teaching inner city kids in LA.  He cares enormously about the value of each child and goes to great length to help them to develop intellectually, socially and morally.  He gives 110%, at least, of his energy and attention to the kids.  No wonder that so many of the graduates of Hobart Elementary have gone on to succeed in Ivy League schools and elsewhere.  One of his former students who later went to law school, set up a foundation to fund the two trips that the class takes.  They stay in first class hotels, eat in nice restaurants as well as visiting historical landmarks.  He wants to give them a taste of what life outside of their poor, violence-ridden neighborhood is like.

This small film about Rafe and his kids will give anyone a huge boost in morale--a good antidote to the usual bad news we are bombarded with. (He advises his students to ""kill their tvs!"")

Brief appearances by Michael York and Ian McClellan add to the fun of the film.",1232668800,4,1289,4.693333333333333
2472207,5,B000CRR3GA,"Director Mel Stuart has given us a wonderfully observed year in the life of a fifth grade class. Their teacher, Rafe Esquith, has challenged the students to pursue excellence in whatever they do. And one of the many ways they do this is by learning and staging one of Shakespeare's plays. In this year it is ""Hamlet."" But this is not a ""Hey, kids, let's put on a show"" story. It's an exploration of what happens when a teacher is willing to challenge his students (and works hard to do so) and the students accept the challenge. And it all takes place in a public school in a poor neighborhood in Los Angeles.

What makes this film special is that it is not a journalist report, heavy on interviews and narration. It is a behavioral documentary that lets us experience the lives of the children. It's terrific.",1231200000,5,810,4.510204081632653
2472208,4,B000CRR3GA,"I found this video to be very inspirational as far as teaching.  This is a teacher we all want to be, and want our children to have.  I thought this video would have more practical information about how to get kids to perform Shakespeare but, oh well, inspiration counts for alot!! I would recommend this video to teachers of all grade levels, even if they've never in a million years thought about doing a play in their classroom, much less Shakespeare (yes, you science teachers, I'm talking to you). It's more about a philosophy of guiding young people as they grow up than about putting on a play, but, man, do these kids do a fine job on stage. No wonder this sticks with them forever.  Bravo to all.",1225584000,3,705,4.449612403100775
2472209,4,B000CRR3GA,"I've read both of Rafe Esquith's books There are no shortcuts and Teach like your hair is on fire.  I was excited to find out that there was also a documentary out on him and his teaching methods and determination entitled ""The Hobart Shakespeareans.""  Upon seeing his teaching style up close, I continue to be awed by this teacher who works 12+ hour days with students from racially mixed backgrounds in an inner city neighborhood.  Yet his work pays off-his students typically score in the best 5% of students taking the SATs, and get accepted at both Ivy league and other colleges all over thw world.  Rafe's students get to attend national monuments and tours of college campuses due to funds from his private, non-profit organization ""Hobart Shakespeareans.""  At the end of every school year, his students put together a Shakespearean play in which they act, do sets for, music for, etc.  It is a moving documentary of the work of the most highly decorated teacher in the history of teaching.  It was wonderful to see what his students can do in and out of the classroom, and to see what Rafe seems to really be like.  I am in awe of this man, and boy do I wish I had his energy.
 My only fault with this documentary is that I wish the entire production of ""Hamlet"" by the HObart Shakespeareans had been shown as an option on the special features of this DVD.  I would have really liked to have seen the entire play that the kids worked so hard on. The clips do not do it justice.  That is the only reason I gave this work four stars rather than five.
 This DVD will inspire anyone who works with children to push themselves more-it is amazing what one person anywhere accomplishes!",1223856000,7,1687,4.5131578947368425
2472210,5,B000CRR3GA,"If only we had more teachers like this truly dedicated man. He has rejected many offers of a ""better"" position to stay in his same role at the Hobart school teaching 9- and 10-year-olds from a poor district in LA. In the year that was filmed, the kids work up and put on a performance of Hamlet - and these are kids who, when Rafe visited their families, he found that no-one even knew who Shakespeare was! The kids comment how at the beginning of the project they could not understand a word. He worked tirelessly to bring them along to the point where Sir Ian McKellen, visiting, says that they all clearly understand everything they are saying ""which is not the case with all Shakespeare actors!""

But the play is really a peg on which to hang Rafe's overarching philosophy, which is one of challenge, of opening minds - trips to Washington and UCLA to light the spark of ambition, for instance. In fact, Hamlet itself does not occupy that much of the time of the film. More attention is paid to Rafe's focus on teaching the children to believe in themselves, to respect each other, to work hard. Yet he is realistic: a possibly surprising moment is when he acknowledges that yes, some children will be left behind and there is not much to be done about it. He knows his class will contain three groups: those will readily ""get it,""  those who may or may not decide to join in, and those who he just won't be able to reach. His hope is to shift many of the second group into the first. Then, with that majority, the tone of the classroom will discourage the ""non-participants"" from making trouble.

The documentary focuses strongly on the positive. I'm sure there were disheartening scenes that could have been included. But the result is a really  heartwarming story, wonderful to watch...and the children are adorable. Think where they come from - and next time someone talks dismissively about ""inner-city kids,"" remember this film.",1223596800,7,1938,4.641399416909621

2472216,5,B000CRR3GA,"It is really quite amazing to watch what Rafe Esquith does in his 5th grade classroom with students from one of the toughest neighborhoods in Los Angeles.

The interviews with the kids themselves are enlightening. One boy recalls his fourth grade teacher's impatience with his inability to understand certain points and contrasts Esquith's willingness to explain and reteach it over and over again. The kids call him ""Rafe"" not ""Mr. Esquith.""  Tears roll down the cheeks of fifth graders who are moved by the lines of Shakespeare or the predicament of Huck Finn.

College pennants from Yale, Harvard, USC, UCLA cover the walls of the classroom as proof of what his former students have achieved and as encouragement for his current students. Esquith's attitude and classroom personae are uplifting but he is realistic. While talking to a group of teachers in Houston, he discusses ""No Child Left Behind"" and the effort that is required from the kids, themselves, and the fact that some of them are unwilling or unable to give that effort.

Then there is the annual Shakespeare play.  Classroom visits from Michael York and Ian McKellen have the students rapt and wide-eyed. York tells the kids that in Shakespeare's time an audience attended a performance to ""hear"" a play, NOT ""see"" a play.

2472217,5,B000CRR3GA,"Rafe Esquith has two rules in his classroom.  They are not ""raise your hand to talk"" or ""keep your hands and feet to yourself,"" but, ""work hard and be nice.""  I first heard Rafe's story on NPR when a friend emailed it to me.  She loaned me her copy of The Hobart Shakespeareans, and I have since purchased several copies myself.  Why several copies?  Because I have loaned it or given it to other educators on several occasions.  I teach pre-service teachers at the college level, and I teach classroom teachers at the graduate level, and I have not met one who did not find inspiration in this story.  Rafe creates the most positive classroom environment I have ever seen.  We all hear about setting ""high expectations"" for our students, but what good are expectations when there is no support provided?  Rafe provides incredible support, but as he readily admits, he was not always this type of teacher.  However, he was willing to learn from his mistakes.  Rafe clearly cares very deeply about every single student.  His investment of time, energy, and yes, money, is the hallmark of every excellent teacher out there (and, yes, there are many!), so it is thrilling to A) see him recognized on behalf of all excellent teachers, and B) view him as a role model for all teachers who seek to become even more effective.  When you view the DVD, keep your eyes on the classroom walls.  You will see pennants from top colleges and universities from around the country.  My first thought was, ""Oh, that's nice and encouraging,"" but look closer... you will see students' names and graduation dates posted under each pennant.  These are Rafe's former students, and look what they have achieved!  Those high expectations paid off because they also received the support necessary to succeed.  Rafe takes his students on field trips to college campuses, to Washington D.C. and to Gettysburg.  He instills pride in them to work hard and be responsible for themselves.  He teaches them how to play baseball, how to play guitar, and how to balance a checkbook.

The students are crying and clearly distraught that Huck, who is doing such a noble deed, should be seen by society as a ""bad boy,"" as one student puts it.  Clearly, 5th grade students can handle Huck Finn when taught by a teacher who knows what he is doing.

2472218,5,B000CRR3GA,"The truly inspirational aspect of this film and the teacher it presents is not that it is a cookie cutter mold for all teachers to follow, but that it demonstrates how teachers can bring their individual passions to bear in a classroom to ultimately achieve much more than high test scores. More impressive to me than the fact that this teacher achieves unabridged Shakespeare productions with 5th graders is that he helps his students learn to be self-disciplined, hard-working individuals, motivated from within, rather than without. This is his greatest achievement in my eyes. I have seen him in person, along with his students, and was impressed by their mutual authenticity. He is very candid with respect to his own shortcomings and his opinions of things around them, which may offend some. He is understandably proud of his achievements as a teacher, and does not try to propose that all teachers copy him. For those that are interested in understanding and learning from what he does, he is happy to share.",1200700800,,1016,4.947368421052632
2472219,5,B000CRR3GA,"This one hour documentary is an inspiration to teachers and educators alike, as it shows just how big a difference one deeply committed teacher can make in the lives of his students. The students, fifth-graders from a poor, immigrant neighborhood wracked by violence, are exactly the kind of children who would otherwise fall through the cracks of our public school system; yet Rafe Esquith gives them a fighting chance, first by believing in their abilities, and second by requiring non-stop hard work.

This film should be required viewing for all teaching certification programs, for all professional development days, for all public school administrators, and for all parents, as a model of teaching and learning practices that lead to excellence.",1196726400,,751,5.310924369747899

2472221,5,B000CRR3GA,"I originally saw this on PBS television but purchased it to see it again.  The teacher makes it clear that this is not primarily about the 5th grade students' primary studies but rather about their extra-curricular activities.  It is fascinating to see how the children respond to various topics and activities.  For me, it really caused a great deal of reflection on what a child is (curious, generous, loving, compassionate, and trusting) and so responsive to intellectual and emotional stimulation.  I don't believe I will ever forget the child who was crying while reading from Huckleberry Finn, she was so emotionally moved by the story.  I believe we all need to be occassionally exposed to the perspective this film brings.",1191283200,6,730,5.05
2472222,1,B000CRR3GA,"Yes, this man is a dedicated teacher. No, his methods are not the wave of the future for educational reform or methods that would often work elsewhere. The perspective of this film is skewed by describing these students as underprivileged inner city kids. Actually they are mostly Asian and Latino immigrant students. As a successful teacher of underprivileged children myself, I can tell you from experience that it is relatively easy to teach students from immigrant families, even those who are poor and just barely learning English, because their families came to this country for more opportunity and are usually highly motivated to succeed. The true underprivileged and most challenging students are those whose impoverished families have lived in the projects for generations, have little faith left in the American system and are often unmotivated as students and parents. Families from this demographic are conspicuously absent from this model teacher's class. This is an important distinction to make, because when this teacher is touted as a ""hero"" and an expert on inner-city education, all too often people with less knowledge about the educational system will be awestruck and believe this is the only way to go. There are many dedicated teachers in this country who use more sustainable methods of instruction and who are valiantly struggling with much more challenging students than the ones in this film.",1186099200,30,1421,5.26431718061674

2472225,5,B000CRR3GA,"I've been so inspired by this DVD because I also teach in a neighbourhood school. Children who attend my school come from the middle to lower income families.

I learnt from Rafe how to be an educator - one who not only inparts knowledge, but also equip our young ones with life-skills. Most of these children don't get love and guidance from home, so if I as their teacher also give up on them, who will guide them? Success is defined very differently in Rafe's classroom. Each child is accorded due respect and each one knows he/she is valued.

I'm inspired by the documentary to be such a teacher.",1173312000,4,600,4.495412844036697

8101389,4,B000CRR3GA,"The movie, ""The Hobart Shakespeareans,"" focuses on one teacher and how he teaches ""disadvantaged"" students from all races and backgrounds. The crime rate in the area of the Hobart Boulevard Elementary is more likely to produce criminals than scholars. The school's lack of funding and room proves true to the area itself. Many people would expect nothing from these underprivileged kids because of their poor background and non-English speaking parents. Rafe Esquith, however is the opposite of the norm. He challenges each and every one of his students equally and expects nothing but the best from them. The techniques he uses for teaching his students are a little unorthodox, such as the main thing they do is apply for a job. They receive paychecks and have to pay rent for the desks they sit in. The students also put on the play Hamlet and perform it completely unabridged, studying it all year long so they are actually in understanding of what they are saying. His dedication to his students have propelled them to attend major colleges and perform at high-end theaters. He teaches them that no matter their background, they can succeed and accomplish anything they want.",1427846400,,1180,4.99492385786802

This documentary from a great Elementary School Teacher, getting 'Shakespeare' across to these young kids is super powerful.
THREE other awsome related matters
(1)  Tavis Smile & Cornell West visited China a couple of times, a couple of years ago, they went to some schools where the lower classes attend school, ANDTHEN VISITED THE PLACES WHERE THOSE KIDS LIVED. Words simply can't describe how special those 20 minutes or so of video show a world the we in the US couldn't imagine in our WILDEST DREAMS.
(2)  Study the REAL story of who was 'ACTUALLY' William Shakespeare, the playwrite. HINT: Absolutely NO WAY, was it the guy that all the academics and everyone claims. That guy, William Shakespeare 'on-Stratford had a very public life, and did pretty well for himself, but his parents, wife, and children were all illiterate. AND IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE, there is no known correspondence between himself and ANYBODY ELSE.  The only known things every written by his own hand, are 6 indecipherable signatures, and most of them don't even look like signatures. Who really wrote those plays?  Amazing theories, but none of them are close to certain.
(3)  PBS Special from 10 years ago, about democracy in China: Election for Class monitor/president in a Chinese Elementary School, which had never had such an election before, or ever even imagined such a thing.  A 1-hour slice of life that is a joy to watch.",1396483200,,1604,4.8145454545454545
