1379505,5,B00004YZGS,I got this play after watching three other David Talbert plays and because Malik Yoba was in it.  It was excellent.  I stayed up till 2 in the morning watching this and his play Mr. Right Now. Every minute was a treat.  I especially loved the part where he finally realizes what he has and what he stands to lose by letting his lady walk out the door.  I was surprised by his singing voice.  I think he should release a CD so we can get the full range of his voice.  What I appreciated most about this play was that there was no gun.  I'm quite tired of every gospel play having a gun in it.  If I see one more character get shot I'm going to scream.  I loved this play and all his other plays.  I think you should buy them.  I know I'm looking forward to his next play coming out on DVD.,1172620800,2,788,3.9554140127388533
1379506,5,B00004YZGS,"This is an awesome Gospel play!  I recommend it to every woman who is SHACKING with a man.  This play is a real eye-opener that teaches a lesson of why should women degrade themselves by living with a man who will not marry them!  It also brings some painful truthes to light.  The best part to me is when the mom encourages her daughter to ""stand up"" and rediscover herself.  I encourage all to invest in this play, and grab all your teenage daughters and their friends to view it, so they can take hold of this valuable lesson in life!  This is truly a God send!  God Bless!",1126051200,4,576,4.229357798165138
1379507,5,B00004YZGS,"THIS ORDER WAS MY SECOND ORDER. I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY IT AGAIN YOU KNOW GIVE IT ONE MORE SHOT, BECAUSE THE FIRST ONE DID NOT GO SO WELL. BUT I HAD NO PROBLEM AT ALL WITH THIS ORDER. EVERYTHING WENT VERY WELL NO PROBLEM AT ALL. AMAZON IS MY NEW FAVORITE THING NOW",1121731200,,262,3.8703703703703702
1379508,5,B00004YZGS,"This play is sooooooo good. Not only does it have a good message, it also has some good actors/actresses and some good scenarios. The singing is ausume too. This is a good tape to have, to invite church friends or family to watch together. It offers a clear cut message. My favorite part is when the mom sings to the daughter after she confesses that she has lost confidence in her self. I was so affected by the mom's vocal skills and the words, she sung self esteem right back into my life. Go get it!!!!!!!! One Love.",1020816000,15,520,4.316326530612245
1379509,5,B00004YZGS,"If you have been living with someone and you feel that it's not a great idea, well, get this video!! You have this young couple(Malik Yoba is the young man in the video) and he lives with this young lady who helped him become the lawyer he is. Add to that pot a ""baby mama"" who is so jealous of his relationship that she latches on to his colleague at work to destroy his reputation for their own gains. Include a father who is looking for his second young adulthood, a mother who constantly harangues her daughter with engagement ring ads, and threatning bodily harm to the man so much that he has to run and hide and you got a comedy that although funny, has also a great lesson behind it. I urge you to get this video today!! You won't miss it. Check out the scene where the mother talks and comforts her daughter. Unforgettable...",1013904000,13,834,4.318471337579618
1379510,5,B00004YZGS,A play on VHS tape was a GREAT idea. I saw it in the theater and loved it on tape. An great piece of work artiscally and presentation wise.,1012262400,2,139,3.8275862068965516
1379511,5,B00004YZGS,Had a very natural story line.  Malik Yoba was very believable in his role.  Loved his surprise vocal at the end.,1356307200,,113,4.333333333333333
1379512,3,B00004YZGS,I bought this play based off the reviews and found it to be just ok. However it arrived at my house in good time and great condition. Id recommend the seller again though.,1345075200,,171,4.212121212121212
1379513,2,B00004YZGS,Catch it on BET or you can buy my copy for $3! It was just something to watch and pass the time. Wasn't thunder blasting but not boring either.,1293408000,,143,3.9655172413793105
1379514,3,B00004YZGS,Malik Yoba is a great actor but it was't really portrayed in this play. I think if the point would've been made sooner then the play would've been excellent but it took a little while to get there which made cringe at times. Not saying the lay was bad because it wasn't just a little slow in arriving to the point. but i'd still recommend it since just because i felt this way don't mean others will. it;s inspirational and does have a point to prove.,1275264000,,451,4.255813953488372
1379515,4,B00004YZGS,"This is a very good play and I really enjoy it each time I watch it. The singing is awesome. The play tells how a black woman should stop settling and giving a man her milk for free. Often hearing that phrase when I was growing up by my elders, it just meant so much more as you watch this play. It gives so many examples of how we as couples take from the very ones that love us so much and even knowingly in the process of doing it, continue. It shows how we have to push and convince our men to do the right things for us and how lack of a push can so easily end our relationships. Definitely a great theme for our younger generation of men and woman. This play does not back off off, so sit down and really listen to it. It teaches you something. Great play!",1263081600,,762,3.9545454545454546
1379516,5,B00004YZGS,"This is the video that made me a David Talbert fan. The theme of the play is great and timeless. The vocals are very good, (which is very hard to find in some of black stage plays today). The continuity flows well. The only negative about the play was the over use of lines about hot chocolate. I would reccommend this play to unmarried couples living together and can't seem to agree on the importance or unimportance of being married. I would also reccommend to anyone he wants laughter, seriousness, and a believable message.  This is a play that I watch over and over and know most of the lines and all of the musical performances.",1259539200,,635,4.474137931034483

1379518,1,B00004YZGS,"If you can get past the very bad acting, there was a message. It was also a very slow movie, longer than what it should of been.",1229299200,,128,3.7777777777777777
1379519,5,B00004YZGS,"Stuart Banks (Yoba) is attorney Stuart Banks. His live-in woman is Denise Washington. They've been shacking up for 3 1/2 years. Denise's mother is constantly at their house giving both Stuart & Denise a hard time about why they aren't married yet. Denise is living with the milkman & why should he marry her when he's getting the milk for free. Stuart's assistant is out sick & the temp agency places Cynthia, Stuart's baby momma of his 5 year old daughter Tyler, in her place. Cynthia & Stuart's coworker Michael further complicate Stuart's life. Between stress at work, problems at home, and baby momma drama, things are bound to be popping! Afterall, ""This is Stuart Banks"" we're talking about here.

This play was 2 thumbs up good! The acting is great, the storyline is great. There is a twist in the plot that I didn't even see coming at first. I highly recommend it!",1200787200,,872,4.662337662337662
1379520,5,B00004YZGS,"I thought this was an excellent play - a must see for play lovers. The acting was superb and the story line was wonderful. I didn't know that Malik Y. could sing, but the brotha can sang.",1196208000,,187,4.081081081081081

7927843,5,B00004YZGS,I loved this play. It's so true...women are known to give too much of themselves too soon. What is the challenge when you've already given everything that you have to give? Great lesson to be learned. Thanks for the inspiring message. Great singing and acting. Was pleasantly surprised to see singer Tony Terry*When I'm with You) playing a role...he did a great job! Thanks David for always displaying phenomenal talent in your shows.,1518220800,,434,4.958904109589041
