4499429,3,B004YHBAJU,"I simply cannot be too forgiving of a performance of this opera where the lead soprano is almost constantly sharp. Everyone is on the right pitch, so she should be, too. Since she doesn't look the part at all, she must win us by her singing. No way.",1310860800,3,249,4.208333333333333
4499430,5,B004YHBAJU,"The first performance of Butterfly was a failure at its premiere at La Scala in 1904, even though it had Storchio as Butterfly,Toscanni's lover at the time. The youthful Zenatello as Pinkerton and De Luca as Sharpless. A dream cast. The problem was that Butterfly was devided into two long acts. Also, many people in Milan wanted Puccini to fail. He was not their favourite composer and getting too big for his pants they thought. When the curtain finally fell there was total silence. Toscanni had predicted such a failure when he saw the score at Storchio's home. He had left La Scala by this time because the audience were too noisy. Puccini withdrew the opera, changed parts of the opera and divided the opera into three acts. Three months later Butterfly was presented at Brescia,between Milan and Turin. Butterfly was  Salomea Kruszeinicka  with a deeper voice. The other principal singers and conductor were the same. The success the opera received was due to the changes and a more open minded audience. Puccini fiddled with the opera until 1906, when Butterfly had its premiere at the Paris opera-Comique. Albert Carre, director of the opera Comique wanted changes to suit his bourgeois audience. This 1906 version is the one we hear today. Madama Butterfly was converted from a Japanese tragedy, to a Melodrama. In the original version of 1904,from the moment the child is born, he is the reason for Butterfly's existence,the reason for her independence. In the final scene, after she bids farewell to the child, she wilfully commits suicide as befits the dignity of the daughter of a Samurai. Only by her death can Butterfly give her child to the  Pinkerton's , because the maternal bond is too strong. This is a part of her destiny, the path she has followed and what has been delivered to her. She was not a victim as she became in the 1906 version. But this 1906 version as well as the 1904 version conforms to Puccini's wish"" I shall make you weep""  The 1904 La Scala Version can be found on Vox classics, conductor, Rosekrans with the Hungarian State opera house orchestra. The Butterfly is Maria Spacagna. You can programme the Brescia and 1906 Paris version to play as well from these 4 CD's. Also, included is the original texts. You might be interested in hearing the original 1904 singers, Storchio, Zenatello and De Luca,also Kruszeinicka on CD. EMI Classics Vol 1,1878-1914,La Scala edition.

The current Butterfly is produced at the Sferisterio opera Festival Macerata This open air stadium was opened in 1829 as a home for Italian handball game, but used as a music venue since the 1920's. Pier Luigi Pizzi is the Stage Director,set and Costume designer. The production is traditional with its pretty little Japanese House, blossom covered cherry tree and silk kimonos. Many of Pinkertons less likeable characteristics are shown. His thoughtless juggling of the statues of Buddha, and his doling out dollar bills to show money can buy you love. The Fondazione Orchestra Regionala delle marche is conducted by Daniele Callegari. The music is swift and captures the emotion and sadness in this piece. Bravo.  One of Italy's favourite Butterfly's is singing the part, Raffaella Angeletti, who has deep chest notes, more like a Kruszelinicka ,then a Storchio. She captures the emotional impulse. My stiff upper lip dropped for a while, I was almost in tears at the end. Puccini, you got me. Suzuki is Annunziata Vestri the mezzo, who is marvellous. Sharpless is Pisapia. Strong voice. The rest of the cast is equally fine. I think the reason why this opera succeeds, is because the orchestra, director and much of the cast are Italian. If you like Italian opera and Puccini, this is a must for your Blu Ray collection. This review is by a person who also likes Modern productions. This opera is traditionally staged.  Worldwide, filmed in HD.",1309478400,11,4016,4.897058823529412
4499431,4,B004YHBAJU,"Butterfly is always difficult to cast - mature caucasian sopranos just cannot look the part and of course the rest of the Japanese roles are similar. In recent years a large number of brilliant Asian singers, mostly from China and Korea, have appeared and it is disappointing they do not get selected more often for operas like Butterfly abd Turandot, particularly when Blu-ray discs are planned as they just make the visual side so much more realistic. It is no longer acceptable to say visual appearances don't matter. Having said that, this production makes a good attempt to disguise their Italian cast through skilled costume design and mostly one can overlook the obvious. Butterfly herself however is more difficult. Angeletti has a huge nose, rather large feet and in close ups her dental structure is very prominent. She tries hard and sings well but just does not remotely look like a 15 year old geisha. In the interlude between the two scenes in the second act, a short ballet appears that I felt added nothing to the production, but it was just odd and not a serious distraction.

The sets, lighting and sound were excellent considering this is an open air theatre. Full marks to the producers. This is thankfully a traditional production set in old Japan. No transfer to a bordello in Genoa or other modern nonsence! Sharpless was well sung and Pinkerton a really nasty cad as he is of course depicted in the story. I often wonder if he might one day appear as less selfish and more misguided, and therefore a bit more sympathetic, but not here. This is easily the best Butterfly I have seen on disc but there have been better productions in the theatre, notably one by the Australian Opera I saw last year. Hopefully more Blu-ray releases will appear to challenge this, but in the meantime there is much to enjoy and many good things in this release",1308873600,10,1864,4.717791411042945

8448281,1,B004YHBAJU,Very sad production. The singers and orchestra should sweep one into the production. Instead this pushes one away. The singing here is horrid.

I am truly that Amazon would even sell it.,1449532800,2,346,4.421875

8448286,1,B004YHBAJU,"I am very disappointed with this Butterfly, one of my most cherished operas.
The acting and direction are so primitive that is almost amateur in the worst ways... not a single new idea. Near this production the Metropolitan Opera Minghella's  oeuvre is a masterwork. Why put this on Blu-ray at full price? The taping has great resolution, worst for the singers, whose flaws is 1080i HD definition visible! The sound has the most serious problem in a show so full of problems. All the principals use microphones, but the choir is almost mute, in a balance far far distant... The huge space makes the singers, mainly Butterfly looking for the conductor aid and support  in the most poignant moments.
Do not waste your money, the image is beautiful, and stop! Very few for this wich is the most theatrical and romantic opera of all, Puccini's own favorite.

8448287,4,B004YHBAJU,"I know it's one of the most performed and most popular crowd-pleasers in the opera repertoire, but so perfect an opera is Madama Butterfly, that it doesn't need any modern revisionism or high concept staging, since it already works on multiple levels.  If you just want it to see it as a straightforward clash between Japanese and American culture that inevitably results in tragedy, then that's more than enough for it to work successfully.  There are however other clashes, divisions and incompatibilities brought out in the opera - from the division of imperialism and isolationism, destiny or self-determination, modernity versus tradition to simply the clash of ideals between men and women in respect of what each of them hope to gain from a relationship.  All these ideas exist in Madama Butterfly, and some of them can be tweaked for emphasis in individual productions, but they are all there to be drawn out by the listener in even the most basic of stagings.

Directed by Pier Luigi Pizzi, this production for the Sferisterio Opera Festival in Macerata in 2009 isn't exactly basic, but it is fairly traditional, aiming for a stylised Japanese setting with silk kimonos, bamboo and paper houses on wooden struts and a cherry tree in bloom.  Puccini's Madama Butterfly can bear such idealism, since in many respects, there is an unrealistic idealism in the minds of the two main protagonists, the American sailor B.F. Pinkerton and the young 15 year-old Japanese bride he has bought, Cio-Cio-San, known as Butterfly - both clearly have different ideas about what they expect to gain out of this arrangement.  This production makes use of the interlude music after the Humming Song to introduce a dreamlike ballet sequence that depicts this idealised version of the relationship, perhaps in Butterfly's mind as she sleeps awaiting the return of Pinkerton, and it's a nice touch that works very well with this idea.

The other notable thing about this production is the open-air performance at the arena which is not traditionally theatre shaped.  The long wings to the side of the stage however are well used for processional marches, as well as giving a greater sense of isolation of Cio-Cio-San from the world outside.  The walls behind the stage however do add to the reverb on the voices, but not in any overly detrimental way.  It does tend to lend a stridency to the singing of Raffaella Angeletti who can certainly hold the high notes as Butterfly, but doesn't have the delicacy that is required in other passages.  She does however certainly deliver where she needs to.  Massimiliano Pisapia is a robust and traditional Pinkerton, alternating between confidence and cowardice, between being arrogant and being loving.  I liked the tone of his voice here throughout.  Claudio Sgura's Sharpless demonstrates good clear diction, but the microphone or the mixing gives his voice too much reverb, and consequently both his voice and Angeletti's can occasionally be a little piercing in places.

Overall however, the singing is good and this is a fine production of Madama Butterfly, presented on a fine Blu-ray with a strong picture and - allowing for the slight extra reverb of the open-air location - good sound-mixes in PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1.",1311638400,4,3272,5.033333333333333
8448288,3,B004YHBAJU,"I would have paid very gladly to go see this for the original performance, and even bought this blu ray subsequently, had I been seated, say, 15 rows away from the stage and the orchestra. I have nothing to complain about the quality of the recording, its crystal clear resolution and the performance from the players. Very good sets, the costumes though tacky, are passable and the ambiance created on stage is lovely. Introduction of the ballet before last scene was actually quite pleasant and innovative.

What spoils this production is the clarity of the blu ray!!!!

This medium is for people to enjoy in their living rooms with close ups unimaginable in the hall, and the freedom to see and listen to the disc or parts of it repeatedly. It is a pure visual experience which has to be chosen with some sensitivity to its viewing public as well as the visual experience itself. Otherwise, a well recorded CD would do the job superbly.

Angeletti is certainly qualified and gives a mature display of her talents, but unfortunately in this blu ray, she looks closer to 50 than 15. That itself is a put-off...thoroughly unconvincing to say the least to a blu ray viewer. She would be and will be magnificent on the stage any day, even today to those sitting beyond 15 rows in the theater. But don't 'shoot' her for close-ups please.

All the others do their job quite very well, but the above factor by itself makes one want to switch off the screen and listen to the performance rather than view it.

The make-up is shoddy to say the least, and makes the girls look as though the talcum-powder ran out midway through the process.

A GOOD PERFORMANCE DOTH NOT A GOOD BLU-RAY MAKE, is my verdict on this. I would any day go back to the Freni/Domingo/Karajan or the Ling Huang/Troxel movie (which is visually pleasing indeed), whenever I wish to see this.",1311120000,4,1855,4.623100303951368
