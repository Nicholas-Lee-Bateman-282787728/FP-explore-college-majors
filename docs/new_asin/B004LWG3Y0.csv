The performances are very enjoyable. Musically you know they are in the right hands when they are directed by redoutable William Christie and Christophe Rousset and performed by their own bands using period instruments. The musicians (vocalists and instrumentalists) are obviously in tune with the French Baroque style. The staging are all ""modern"" and imaginative, although I'd wish to have some ""modern re-imagination"" of the ""period theater"", like the splendid&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lully-Atys-Blu-ray/dp/B005LL4UCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lully: Atys [Blu-ray</a>], which is my favorite French Baroque video by a very big margin.

The perspective buyers can find detailed reviews of the individual release at the above links. They are at this moment the only DVDs available for the pieces. Note however Zoroastre (the same performance) is also available in the Blu-Ray format:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rameau-Zoroastre-Blu-ray/dp/B001D068XY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rameau: Zoroastre [Blu-ray</a>], which has sharper image and better sound tracks, revealing more delicious details of the performance.

I am surprised that nobody has written any comments on this page. -- I recommended this box set to a friend more than a year ago, and he was delighted with the purchase. I think you will be too.

Strongly recommended.

8435040,4,B004LWG3Y0,"By all means try this collection.  At the price the experience is a bargain. (Shop around.) But be warned that if you are a typical opera lover you may find yourself left high and dry. I am not sure why William Christie asserts that Rameau is the greatest composer of ballet before Stravinsky.  But I see why he stresses dance because that is most of the event.  I could say dance attempts to rescue the music with whimsical costumes, bright primary colors, break-dancing, bottom-wagging and astonishing special effects including 18th century costumed men and women bouncing on clouds.  (You have to see it.)  It's like your dad taking you to the circus. (Or my uncle taking me to a 1950's New Jersey burlesque show)  The lead men are handsome, the women insouciant. Special effects include the transformation of humans into wild animals. (I have no idea how they do it on stage.)  It's all very French, which is to be expected but possibly disappointing if you are not fully into the language and Gallic humor.  I wish we knew how these operas were originally produced.  The Opera Atelier production of Lully's Persee, Herve Niquet conducting, is suggestive and far more satisfying.",1503964800,2,1183,4.845771144278607

8435043,3,B004LWG3Y0,"of the six discs I enjoyed three, ""In Convertendo"", ""Les Indes galantes"", and ""Zoroastre"", the voices were all wonderful, I was not very familiar with the music of Rameau prior to this purchase, he appears comfortable in comedy as well as drama, ""Zoroastre"" was very powerful and dramatic, while ""galantes"" was very light and airy, really quite beautiful, both of them, the only problem I have with the set are the dance sequences, I believe they ruined an otherwise wonderful group of musical performances, they looked more like people experiencing seizures than dancers..",1436486400,2,573,5.172043010752688
8435044,5,B004LWG3Y0,"I am very new to Rameau's music, and these operas collectively stunned me with the musical quality and elaborate productions.  Personally, I prefer the French productions to the Dutch productions, but the music is all fantastic.  There are also nice extras with information on Rameau, the operas, and the staging choices.

As a newbie, I would recommend starting with Les Indes Galantes, but buy the box set since all the productions are worthwhile and the price for the package is definitely worth it.  The video and audio are first rate as well.",1395878400,7,547,4.913043478260869
8435045,5,B004LWG3Y0,"This is an excellent compilation of Rameau's operas. The varying interpretations make for enjoyable viewing, and in each case, musically immaculate. I would definitely recommend these, especially for someone wishing to get a handle on this extraordinary and beautiful music.
'Les Boreades' is particularly evocative.",1382400000,3,316,6.044444444444444

8435047,5,B004LWG3Y0,"I didn't read the description closely, so was surprised when it turned out to be DVDs of actual performances, not just CDs, I was doubly delighted. Another happy note: ""Les Boreades"" is the first Rameau opera I bought, but it came without a libretto because of a copyright holder's quibble over sums. The DVD comes with an assortment of subtitles, so, for the first time, I was able to follow the opera with more than a synopsis.

I still have all the other operas in the set to watch. It isn't something you just sit down and make a marathon of. Most I've never heard in complete form, just bits and pieces on compilation albums or albums featuring a particular artist. While those bits and pieces albums give a sense of what to expect in an opera- and are often how I finalize a decision to buy a set if I'm unfamiliar with a work - there is nothing that takes the place of the whole. I look forward to working my way through the rest of the boxed set!",1360886400,11,954,4.3
8435048,5,B004LWG3Y0,"The collections is superb.  The performances are well filmed, the camera angles are well chosen.  Also, the sound quality of the DVDs are excellent and the subtitle are clear.
