1883519,5,B00009KNU5,"At a minimum, TPB offers polished character development and a unique mix of superbly performed personalities that guarantee absorbing every viewer. A typical comment during background holiday viewing was, ""What the h*** are you watching?"" -- with that individual converted to TPB in about an hour. No one left the room during our TPB DVD unveiling and short of seats, people sat the carpet.
As unique as the inhabitants are, TPB never beats the old ""fish out of water"" mule as there's nothing hackneyed about this series; the characters barely fit in amoungst themselves but are certainly their funniest interacting with the non-trailer park world.
Paraphrasing season 3:
Bubbles (in a scolding hush): ""Ricky, you can't shout 'dope' in a bank!'""
Ricky (proudly, out of jail about 20 minutes and still in his numbered orange jumpsuit): ""Sure I can Bubbles, I'm rich as f*** now. Dopity-dope-dope.""
How many people do you know that've been tossed from a bank?
Or get arrested at their wedding before kissing the bride?
The scripts never force or focus on nonconformity, become self-conscious or betray their characters, like ""Jackass"", or most US shows that substitute overemphasis and preachiness for lack of talent or perspective. TPB never goes through the tedium of lecturing on societal ills, as there's too much of that out there and we all see it anyway. They're too busy exploiting it: crime, alcoholism and drug usage, in which almost every episode owes, never get lionized but remain weaknesses to leverage, deal with or circumvent.
Given their extreme dysfunction and nonconformity with the outer world, TPB remains in control, very unextreme, unforced, certainly owing to improv somewhat, with an easy acting and visual style -- it matches well with the hyper-sharp hand-held video and could be your own personal footage on the TV. Until you see someone smashing a bottle on your windshield.
Further supporting character development and audience empathy is the precision in which situational ethics are bent and reshaped -- keeping things hysterically fresh. Ricky's first-person exposition to the camera is priceless as he rationalizes all behavior, improvising on whatever bits of logic that flash through his mind. For example, if he sells dope to the local prison guards, then he's guaranteed there'll be good quality dope the next time he's arrested -- so, life works for Ricky whether he's in or out.
""Park"" events never cross believability for the sake of a cheap laugh, but always feed a need or convenience: you never steal from someone in the ""park"", even if it's only Randy's barbeque and the serial numbers are sanded off for argument sake, but dragging an ATM machine at 60 kph to visit Bubble's welding torch, however distressing to Julian, is acceptable if it's for a forthright cause. Like trying to get arrested.
The show's still at cult status, except maybe in Canada where the actors are reportedly recognized everywhere, so there's no reason it won't pop internationally once aired -- honesty works hand-in-hand with universality and is its own reward.
After the dust settles on the series popularity, I hope the pilot film is released. It's a work of artistic black comedy that offers where TPB could have gone, but stands well on it's own, just like the series. The opening scene where Julian answers the camera crew at his door, and stands bewildered, hungover and disoriented for 30 seconds rivals the 50s ennui of Stanislovski- and Strassberg-trained actors like Brando, et., al. Yes, here's where the bar is.
In sum, talent on both sides of the camera, highest recommendation, unrivaled brilliance. There's not a character you won't like or at least, appreciate. Expect industry flattery soon -- my money says imitators are forthcoming and like Ricky says, ""it's supply and command"".",1072915200,5,3819,5.112

1883550,5,B00009KNU5,"At the turn of the Millennium, before MY NAME IS EARL added the trash to ""trailer trash"" and IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA added ""dirt-bag"" to ""sitcom,"" a modest little mockumentary out of Nova Scotia got going on those concepts and then some.  Fast, funny and profane, TRAILER PARK BOYS has been a Canadian joy for over a decade, and is now widely available in the States through Netflix or here, on DVD.

The series begins when life-long buddies Ricky (Robb Wells) and Julian (John Paul Tremblay) are let out of the local jail, not for the first time.  Ricky tells the camera that jail isn't really so bad, the guys are nice and the inmates and staff alike are a great market for the home-grown pot he and Julian produce.  Soon thereafter the two are joined by a third friend, ""Bubbles"" (Mike Smith), a sound guy for the show who quickly figured out that art was more fun than life in the making of this wack but endearing show, which apparently will run forever and has spawned several movies as well.  At least Bubbles has a shack on the trailer-park grounds; the other guys sometimes find themselves without accommodations (though Ricky has an ex-wife and pre-teen daughter who have a trailer of their own.)

Ricky isn't the brightest thing going, and he's hot-headed to a fault, but he does have a way with the blarney when it comes to talking his way out of re-arrest.  Julian is more the problem-solving type, cooler, magisterial and always willing to step into a crisis -- and with Ricky around, crises are almost inevitable.  Ricky, by the way, has enhanced the Canadian (and now American) vernacular immensely with his very own malaprops and misusages -- the Urban Dictionary even has a listing for ""Rickyisms"" such as ""horviculture"" (how to grow things) and ""RACK-in"" (Ricky's pronunciation for the woodland animal with the ringed tail).  Ricky lives by the precept ""What comes around is all around"" and speaks of ""Canepillars"" and ""Indianapolis Jones.""  Bubbles, with his Coke-bottle glasses, may be the smartest member of this triumvirate, but he is frequently undone by his hobbies, which include electronic gear and pet ""kitties"" (the more the better), not to mention a weakness for following the other guys into trouble.

These early seasons give the boys two clear antagonists:  Jim Lahey (John Dunsworth), a deposed local cop, now abuses his tenure as ""trailer park supervisor"" to ""clean up"" the Sunnyvale Trailer Park, which may be an impossibility since most of the population seems either retired, on dope, or pre-teen thugs-in-training who smash beer bottles into cars and people when least expected.  (Lahey never quite ""gets"" that Ricky and his crew have no small number of supporters in the trailer park, and that politically and economically, it's Ricky's ""turf"" as much as his.)  Lahey's live-in sidekick is ""Randy"" (Patrick Roach), a woebegone Barney Fife-type toady who never wears a shirt.  As the TRAILER PARK BOYS series grows in years and hilarity and production budgets, the number of residents who are sworn enemies (or cash-only employees) of Ricky and Julian grows, and sides and alliances are frequently changed.  Word has it that the filming of TRAILER PARK BOYS so roughed up REAL trailer parks in the Dartmouth, Nova Scotia area, that effective with Season 8 the show's producers had to create a Sunnyvale set to accommodate all the mayhem.  (Here's where I interject that most residents of real trailer parks are hard-working, tax-paying people.  I know this because I lived in one for two years.)

I can't name the titles of these episodes, because nearly half of them are so pungent as to require asterisks here at Amazon.  I can say that each year averages only about eight episodes, and the ""cliffhanger"" for each year -- the season-ender -- always comes when Ricky, Julian and sometimes others have to go to jail -- again.  But fear not, they'll be released for the next funny season just in time.  Whether or not you're stuck in jail, TRAILER PARK BOYS is prime viewing.  Here's the logical place to start, and at a good price.",1463702400,,4080,4.864161849710983

1883647,5,B00009KNU5,"As other reviewers have noted, Trailer Park Boys is necessary show for true fans of television comedy as the combination of raunchy jokes and outlandish behavior will simultaneously induce laughter, disgust, and pity from the viewer.

Trailer park residents Ricky, Bubbles, and Julian are the central characters of the show.  To make ends meet, the trio hatches a plethora of ridiculous schemes that almost always entail breaking the law in hilarious fashion.  Ricky is the smartest dumb character in television in that he continuously talks his way out of getting arrested, yet has absolutely no command of the English language.  He is unable to speak without swearing.  With his strong commitment to friendship and loyalty to his kittens, Bubbles provides a shred of nobility to the group.  From makeshift hydroponic operations to cashing out fake lottery tickets, they leave few stones unturned in terms of illegal activity.  Trailer park supervisor Jim Lahey and his shirtless assistant Randy attempt to maintain a semblance of order in the park with varying degrees of success.

Filmed in Nova Scotia, Canada, the show utilizes a mockumentary format with camera crews following each of the characters and brief interviews taking place on occasion.  It is evident the cast is still working out the kinks in the first season as Julian and Ricky return from an 18 month stint in prison.  The best approach is to stick with a several episodes to gain an understanding of character backgrounds.  Once you understand the desperateness of their situation, the hilarity of the shenanigans only grows in leaps and bounds.  Moreover, while the show contains raunchy, profane language, it is intelligently written in the sense that the personalities are subtly developed in brilliant manner.  For example, Ricky rapidly butchers phrase after phrase with absolutely zero awareness of how ignorant he sounds.  Time and time again, he rationalizes his behavior by placing the blame on someone else, especially when the cops show up.

If you do not mind foul language and gun fights and enjoy watching ruthlessly stupid shenanigans, Trailer Park Boys will hold great appeal.  If you don't give TBP a chance, then, to paraphrase Ricky, ""What you don't know won't learn you.""",1366848000,,2263,5.175824175824176

Season 2 - 5 stars

Well, this is the start of Canada's trademark cult series, a mockumentary of life in a trailer park located in Nova Scotia. While the show has become a personal favorite, the first season was a bit rough and underdeveloped, but at the same time, it is still an important part to the storyline. Two ex-convicts, Ricky and Julian, are fresh out of jail following the events that took place in the rare black and white Trailer Park Boys feature full-length. Both of them are doing what it takes to get back on their feet, whether it would be dealing with the gun toting Cyrus, starring in a grease film just to make money to start off a hydroponics operation (which quickly backfires), or even doing a little break and enter just to have a successful proposal. Trailer park supervisor Jim Lahey and his shirtless assistant Randy don't make things any easier for the two. The thing I've noticed about this season in particular is that it's more dark in tone, having Ricky and Julian constantly arguing and disagreeing with each other when it comes to their set goals and outcomes. While I still think it's not one of my favorite seasons of the show, it's still a great season to start things up. Besides, the last episode of the first season makes it worthwhile to keep watching towards the second season...

Season two feels more developed, with the ideas fleshed out better and by utilizing the cat loving Bubbles much more to bring out its own personality. Ricky is even funnier than ever with his use of ""Rickyisms"", and Julian comes off as less selfish. The main objective of this season involves a business strategy called ""Freedom 35"", a mass grow and sell operation to approach retirement. The Boys must deal with the trailer park turning into a mess due to a conflict in Lahey and Randy's relationship, spider mites infesting their plants, Lahey's daughter who takes a liking to Ricky (played by Ellen Page of Juno and Inception fame), and even con artists masquerading as Bible sales people, just to name a few. This also brings out the veterinarian Sam Losco in a negative light, who lost his license due to events in the first season, who threatens to take control over Sunnyvale. The season as a whole comes off as much less dark in its nature and more comedy based (which the show would keep following down that same approach), and with the use of clever dialog and awkward situations done even better than before, it's very obvious that this was the point that the show was something that would make an imprint in comedy television.

Even though the second season is done better than the first, it is still highly recommended to watch this show from front to back, starting off with the first season. It may be a bit slow to absorb it all in, but by the time the second season is on its way, it finally hits like a firecracker and you have no choice but to keep watching throughout the Boys' crazy adventures.",1362268800,,2959,4.579245283018868

Wow, it's painful to see Canada - the homeland of many fine comics and comedic actors - fall flat on it's face with TPB. Neither a notable mockumentary nor comedy, what I watched was a bad film project.

It is without a doubt the most hilarious, yet heartwarming show to come around in years.  Ricky, Julian, Bubbles and the gang work their characters to perfection.
The writing is excellent. Yes, there's swearing, guns, violence and drugs.  But that's their lives.
As an aside...We had the great pleasure of meeting the Boys at their live show in
Milwaukee Oct 2011.  They were wonderful.  Funny, kind and you just wanted to hang out with them for real.  If you ever get the chance to see them live it's soo worth it.

The writing gives each character a ""real"" personality. No one is the hero or the villian, they are each just trying to make their way in the world, however misguided and illegal, at times. The ensemble cast plays off one another and each actor gets ""their"" moment across episodes. In season 2, a very young Ellen Page has a recurring role.

This show aired on Canadian television, I believe, but is NOT for children. The langauge is foul and the themes are adult, including drugs, sex, violence, and criminal behavior.

I will not rate the special features, because I did not watch them. Some episodes have commentary, but I have yet to watch those.

1883710,5,B00009KNU5,"I haven't been this happy to watch a comedy series, or anything for that matter, in I don't know how long!

Ricky, one half of the main character force, is powerfully ignorant; forcefully ignorant. Everything he causes to go wrong becomes somebody else's fault through his warped rationalization. He's uselessly wise about his own stupidity. It's a thing of beauty to behold! He's constantly setting up people with Knock Knock jokes that don't actually follow the Knock Knock rhythm just so he can tell people to f*** off. Each time he does this, I laugh harder than the last time! Rob Wells plays this character to the hilt and is the true comedic genius driving this entire show, in my opinion.

Julian is the straight man/tough guy/brains of the outfit. He comes off as seeming more intelligent but it's only because he has more poise. He's almost as stupid as Ricky. It does not matter what is going on, to include action scenes, Julian is NEVER without his rum and Coke, ice tinkling in the glass. It kills me!

Something is clearly dysfunctional about Bubbles in a fundemental fashion, and yet he is the most intelligent citizen in the park. He passionately curses non-stop in a way as natural to him as taking the next breath. His blisteringly foul language often pops up in the most benign of situations causing the funny quotient to leap upwards.

There's a guy who never wears a shirt, wears too tight white pants, has a huge belly, and there's no explanation given, ever, for why he's like this.

The ""Bottle Kids"" randomly appear to smash bottles on people's windshields or homes, while the people are there, and this is an accepted part of life in the park. These brief, yet intense little violences hit when you least expect them. I'm telling you. it's funny!

Ricky's six year old daughter rolls her own smokes.

As you might guess, I could really carry on about this show. It's spectacular! Comedy's audience is sometimes elusive but if you're a fan of stereotype driven absurdity then don't hesitate to watch this series.",1207440000,29,2038,4.740112994350283

The first time I saw this I couldn't believe it aired on tv. Those Canadians are a little too honest, eh. But damn they're funny at times.

I don't know much about the show's history, but I found almost every character humorous, and Ricky approaches genius at moments.

It helps if you know a little bit about Canada and the Maritimes, but the laughs are there in any case. It's broadly drawn but the faux-documentary technique works wonders, and as trailer trash comedies go, I like this one even more than Earl.

The two leads have been friends since they were kids, and Wells' Dad was a Mountie, so there's a sense of realism in a lot of the farce that is somehow both charming and goofy in the best of ways.

I don't know how the later seasons are, but the first two are uniformly excellent.

I love the entire series, but season 1 is rough around the edges. the adlibbing is stilted and the actors haven't yet fallen into their roles. However, season 1 is short and by season 2 you will know whether this show is for you.

Much like Arrested Development, this show takes a number of episodes to 'click.' Or, it did for me. But once i hit that point, i was hooked. Bubbles might be one of the greatest TV characters ever -- both because of acting and the way he is developed in the show.

That's right.  Officially the first reality television show to air on national television, ""Cops"" pandered to the prurient in all of us, the urge to see willful stupidity and irrational rage played out in all of its seamy, accidentally-comedic glory.  ""Cops,"" now 18 years old, still plays, eternally banking on society's fascination with train wrecks, especially when those trains are run by boozed, baked, and bewildered boobs.  Well, move over ""Cops.""  If you thought real-live redneck morons could make for arresting television (pun intended), take a look at what Mike Clattenburg has done with the wonderful world of make-believe.

A mockumentary of Canada's Sunnyvale Trailer Park and its hopelessly clueless citizens, ""Trailer Park Boys"" owes as much to Reiner's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/This-Is-Spinal-Tap/dp/6305922756/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">This Is Spinal Tap</a>&nbsp;as it does to ""Cops.""  Like ""Spinal Tap,"" the show follows three short-sighted dopes around as they try to make sense of their lives, mend strained relationships among those they love, and -- of course -- try out any number of hair-brained (and mostly illegal) schemes to make money fast.

Bubbles is ostensibly the smartest (he quotes Aristotle and Plato ... with accuracy!) and most sensitive of the trio, a cat lover who gets caught up in the shenanigans if for no other reason than because he values loyalty over intelligence and friendship over freedom.  Julian, a well-built man who is always seen in a black baby-t, is the only one of the three who harbors dreams beyond his small life in the trailer park.  Rarely seen without a drink in hand, Julian is a smart man, but not smart enough to disengage himself from the chaotic orbit of Ricky, a truly crazy, dumb, dangerous, dumb, well-meaning, and just very, very dumb man.

If it weren't for the almost flawless acting, the show could very well be consider nothing more than a protracted and horribly foul-mouthed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-Stooges/dp/0809225808/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three Stooges</a>&nbsp;episode (with a little&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jackass/dp/B000BDH69O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jackass</a>&nbsp;thrown in for flavor).  However, with the exception of a few characters (Sam Losco, a former veterinarian, is the one that comes immediately to mind), the actors and actresses in this show are truly, and without exaggeration, dead-on in every scene.  If it weren't for the ludicrous circumstances and the fact that the camera work steadily loses its shaky, documentary feel over the years, it would be very easy indeed to believe that these are real people.  (Adding to the faux-autheticity, whenever the actors make live public appearances, they always remain steadfastly in character.)

Season One introduces us to the gentlemen, Ricky and Julian, as they are finishing up an eighteen month stint in jail.  They return to their beloved trailer park, but immediately encounter resistance (and will for the rest of the seasons) in the form of the trailer park supervisor, Mr. Lahey, and his half-naked assistant, Randy.  In addition, Ricky must deal with his dwindling relationship with Lucy (with whom he's fathered a daughter, Trinity), while Julian takes on the new trailer park hotshot, Cyrus.  Somewhere in there a kindly old woman's dog eats some suspicious brownies, an undeniably white rapper -- J-Roc -- tries to earn money in the amateur adult video industry, and a robbery at a local grocery store goes horribly, hilariously wrong.  The Second Season expands the characters, giving us a more thorough look at Bubbles (his affinity for felines and exactly how he makes his money), Cory and Trevor (lapdogs who are to Julian and Ricky what Rosencrantz and Guildenstern were to King Claudius), and Mr. Lahey and Randy (the nature of their symbiotic relationship is explored in disturbing detail).

If it sounds dirty, distasteful, stupid, and weird, it kinda is.  But the nicely contained cosmos of the trailer park, the perfectly defined characters, the psychologically-sound ties that bind every person in the park together, and the (as I said before) amazing acting make this show not just hilarious, but also ground-breaking and brilliant.  For most TV series, that would be high praise, but when you're talking about drugged-up, trash-talking Moe, Larry, and Curly, it's a recommendation of the highest order.",1176854400,9,4748,5.83092485549133

Or Bubbles making his living by restoring stolen shopping carts and, when facing jail time, asks the sincere and poignant question, ""Who's gonna look after my kitties""? As preposterous as the people and the situations become, the lads hold it all together with flawless comic logic that usually ends in hilarious parodies of typical TV style, not unlike South Park's addiction to ""I learned something today ..."" closings.

1883743,5,B00009KNU5,"insanely irreverent and hilarious mock reality show comedy with incredibly well developed characters and brilliant acting and writing.  set in a trailer park in atlantic canada, and follows the antics of the dope growing ricky, the always run and coke drinking julian, and bubbles, who wears the craziest glasses ever seen.  they are helped by their friends and hindered by the trailer park supervisor lahey and his shirtless assitant randy.  watch them and fall in love...",1084924800,,473,5.197368421052632
1883744,5,B00009KNU5,"Trailer Park Boys is the greatest and most powerful Canadian TV show ever made in Canada.  And with its rich Canadian humor, its even funnier if you watch it in America.  With the great casting and rolls, this great show is the best of all.  The drug use and harsh language adds more comedic feelings while watching this wonderful show.  The great storyline is one of the most unique of its kind and if you are smart, you will watch it like me. HARDCORE Takkun",1083628800,,460,4.376470588235295
1883745,5,B00009KNU5,"The Trailer Park Boys are truly a Canadian classic. Although the term trailer park trash may have originated south of the border, these tree guys live it, and endlessly make you laugh because of it. The show constantly pushes the envelope, and it just gets played on air. Unlike the censorship down south, we see how truly funny life can be, as this show is more reality than anything in the US.",1083456000,4,395,4.5
1883746,5,B00009KNU5,Great ensemble cast.  each episode gets better than the last.  Profane and witty.  One of the best shows on the air right now.,1083369600,,126,4.391304347826087

1883749,5,B00009KNU5,"Hilarious characters, everyone knows someone like these people. Mike Smith ""Bubbles"" is either one of the greatest actors of our time or touched in the head. ""J-Rock"" and his verbal jabs at the troublesome ""Mr. Layhee"" and the shirtless wonder ""Randy"" are priceless. ""Julian"" and his partner ""Ricky"" with their hairbrained schemes are sure to entertain. Long story short, buy these DVDs and get season three when it becomes available and you won't be disappointed.",1079049600,,464,5.2

7991117,5,B00009KNU5,"Got turned on to them before they became popular. Worth watching just for the Ricky-isms. A totally original series if you open your mind to their world - dope growing, drink swilling, shopping cart restoration and trailer park living rules and characters.  Kinda the Three Stooges reinvented for the 21st century.",1497312000,,314,5.1568627450980395
