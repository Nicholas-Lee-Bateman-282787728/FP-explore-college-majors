8648143,5,B00J4OI0UK,"Although all five movies are on one DVD, the picture and sound are clear as a bell.  Three of the movies are in widescreen and two in full screen, but since they are television movies there is no Pan-and-Scan to worry about.  Pick up this set and enjoy several hours of great family entertainment.

Thicker Than Water:

A successful job-oriented lawyer at a prestigious law firm loses her father and finds her true self. She is given a wooden box that contains her father's most prized possessions.  Inside she finds a photo of a woman sitting on a horse with an inscription to her father and signed ""Maggie May"".  She sets out to find Maggie May, ending up at a horse ranch in a small rural town, and learns that she had died just six months prior to her father. One surprise that throws her for a loop is the fact that the woman running the ranch, Maggie May's daughter, is her half-sister.

She portrays herself as a reporter doing research for an article on past rodeo performers (as was Maggie May), but eventually reveals who she is and ends up living at the ranch for a few months.  After some adjustment, they do begin to feel like sisters and this effects positive changes in both their lives.

The message I got from this movie is that sometimes life throws us a curveball and we end up finding joy in the midst of the trials.

Angel In The Family:

Who has not wished for just one more day with a loved one who has passed on? One more opportunity to say I love you and to feel the warmth of their hug? One last chance to right a wrong?  What if you prayed for that one more day and God answered your prayer?  Would it, could it, possibly change your life?

A grieving father and husband wants that one more day with his deceased wife. His two daughters, living miles apart and estranged for years, reunite due to his having a stroke just before Christmas. He convinces them to spend the holiday at a small cottage on a lake, where they used to live as a family, surrounded by the beauty of mountains and a snowy landscape.  After the settle in, the father finds his wish is granted and their lives are changed forever.

On Christmas morning, their mother appears on the scene - shocking them all. (Yes, she is the angel.) Once they realize she is only to be with them for one day, they treasure every moment as their mother creates a Christmas they will never forget. The father is renewed, pulled from his grief at last. The daughters are reconciled, making life-changing decisions due to a whole new perspective given them by the gift of those brief few hours with their mother. As hearts are healed, they open to let in light and love.

The message is that life goes on and those we love are always with us, living in our hearts as we remember all the little things that made our lives with them wonderful.

Ordinary Miracles:

A single judge, estranged from her father due to anger at his having asked her to compromise her ethics, is now living just for the job. She sits on the bench in family court and is dealing with a teenage foster child who continually runs away from the homes she is placed in. Circumstances lead to this judge becoming her legal guardian.  The initially strained relationship between the two becomes a closer one, each forcing the other to face some tough questions.

Through this unexpected relationship, the judge ultimately is able to forgive and reconcile with her father.  Since she has the power to open sealed files, she is able to locate the girl's father and manages to reunite them.  Will the judge have a permanent role in the life of this teen??

This is a thought provoking movie that demonstrates how simple compassion and putting oneself out for another can change lives. I wonder how many decent, intelligent children are shuffled around simply because the system is overloaded and they have nowhere else to go and how easy it might be for one person to change someone's life.

Blue River:

At the outset of this movie, the elder brother appears at the door of the younger brother's home, looking disheveled and lost. They have not seen each other in years, since the elder left home as a very young man, maybe in his twenties. He has no possessions with him and is evidently homeless. The younger brother and his wife welcome the elder, but when he asks to live with them for a while, the younger says no. This is where the movie becomes a flashback focused on their teenage years.

The plot is along the lines of a psychological study that I found engrossing. The intense personality of the older brother draws you in and you find yourself wanting to know what happened to make him this way. He is intelligent, articulate and shows genuine gentleness toward his mother, while the rest of the world is treated with animosity. The story unfolds fairly rapidly with essentially no wasted scenes.

In conclusion the movie reverts back to the present and the younger brother has a last minute change of heart.  It was interesting to see the elder brother, so angry and fierce in his younger years, now appearing to be beaten down and quietly desperate.  It just goes to show that all fires, no matter their intensity, ultimately burn themselves out and turn to ash.

What I Did For Love:

A city lawyer has just been offered a partnership in his firm at a six figure salary.  His fianc is a country girl at heart who can't formally accept his proposal of marriage and make it public until he meets her family and gets her father's blessing.  So, off to the ranch they go.  His arrival in Pine Gap is inauspicious as a horse jumps out in front of his convertible and he swerves into a utility pole.  This sort of sets the tone for the humorous aspect of this lighthearted romance.  It seems for a while that he just can't get out of his own way.

The cantankerous father puts this city-slicker through the ringer while Sally Struthers plays the aunt who, while a lovable bundle of energy and country kindness, meddles in the affair trying to reunite the fianc with her high school sweetheart.  This only brings about more mishaps where enough already exist.

Will this fish-out-of-water lawyer manage to prove his mettle in the father's eyes and win approval of the engagement??  (That's for me to know and you to find out.)",1411171200,5,6278,4.530141843971631
