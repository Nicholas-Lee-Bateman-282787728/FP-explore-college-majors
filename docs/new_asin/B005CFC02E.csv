8465247,4,B005CFC02E,"In the old days, ECHO BRIDGE, and its predecessor PLATINUM PLUS had an annoying on-screen watermark,
and their transfers had pixillation issues.
Neither is a concern with their 6 movie set, MIDNIGHT HORROR COLLECTION: DEADLY GAMES.

Got a great price on this two-DVD collection, but the films' IMDb ratings weren't all that reassuring.
Just watched the last one today and am quite pleased with the variety and quality of these movies.
Picture and sound are also quite good.

Best are MOMENTUM and THE PROPHET'S GAME, but DARKNESS also held my interest, despite its odd ending.
FROM THE DEAD OF NIGHT has cheap-o opening titles, a shot-on-Super 8 look and subpar synthesizer score,
yet despite these possible drawbacks the story and acting are fine.

All four are on the first single-side, two-layer DVD.

The last two movies, MEMORY and CLOSETS, are low budget throwaways, although both have their moments.

NOTES
""Closets"" claims to be based on real events, including a ""possessed"" house with a below freezing temp.
Diahann Carroll looks remarkably well-preserved in ""From the Dead of Night.""
Dennis Hopper is outstanding in ""The Prophet's Game"" as an ex-detective seeking closure on an old case.
Its ""whodunit"" plot is spoiled when a prominently billed person doesn't appear in the first hour.
Hopper has ""star"" status in ""Memory,"" but Billy Zane plays the central character.
""Momentum"" is about a group of telekinetics targeted for death by the man who helped create them.
Although she was nearly 20 when working on ""Darkness,"" Anna Pacquin (who's terrific!) looks about 12.
