447607,5,6302277736,"For many years I have been a great fan of the historical fiction written by writer John Jakes.  The epic series of novels ""The Kent Family Chronicles"" comes alive with great historical relevancy, making the  events of history march through the screen.  Personally, I love all kinds  of miniseries (espically North & South the miniseries), and I very much  enjoyed this third part of the televison adaption of his books.  They  acting, background and costuming is excellent, with a wonderful supporting  cast.  I highly recommend this video who enjoys, action, adventure or just  good old romance.  This is one film I have viewed that accurately depicts  historical events to audiences of all ages.  Except for a few scenes with  brief scenes of nudity. I truly love, and enjoyed this sweeping plot and  they way it made history come alive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",939945600,4,854,5.043165467625899
447608,4,6302277736,"I am a Randy Mantooth fan and ordered the movie for that reason.  However, I found myself caught up and captivated in the history of events and the lives and loves of everyone in the film! It was very interesting; I did not  like the way they let Abraham sink so low in the end however;that is the  reason for the four instead of the five!  Delta Burk was great and so was  Brian Keith.  Buy it; I did!",933120000,5,402,4.025316455696203
447609,5,6302277736,"This movie is a must see for those who love American History in the point of view of a family trying to make it in these times. The seekers speaks of the Kent family and there turbulent lives. As Abraham Kent bracks off from  the family biusness of printing and tries to make a life in the newly  settled land of the Northwest. It doesn't work. He finally chooses after  the death of his wife to go back to Boston, and ask to be  let back in the  family. Things then get bad Abraham takes to drinking, gambleing, and other  unorthidox sins. Acording to the Kent family. Because of Abrahams  foolishness he ends up loosing the only thing in my opinion that he has  left, his son. I highly recommend both the book and the movie to anyone who  enjoys suspense, drama, and action. I would also like to recommed that you  read the whole series of ""The Kent Family Chronicles"". This  series has everything that a person could want in a book and series. These  books to me are werth the money to buy them. Here is a list of the series  from the first book to the last book. ""The Kent Family  Cronicles"": ""The Bastard"", ""The Rebels"", ""The  Seekers"", ""The Furies"", ""The Titans"", ""The  Warriors"", ""The Lawless"", and last but certanly not least  ""The Americans"".

7823479,4,6302277736,"i give this fine mini-series 4 stars because this one was used to set up the rest of the series but for reasons unknown they stoped after this one.

  philip kent is now an old man(and now played by martin millner)and his son's are now the focus of the series. randolph mantooth is quite good as the oldest son who must do things for himself.his trek west with wife and new child is the focus of the first part and we get to see how hard the way really was and leaves us with very powerful images of the life and death daily life of our andercesters. the second part follows kent's two grandchildren as they fight for their part of the american dream. very well done,and i hope to see the other books turned into mini-series someday.",1148256000,3,733,4.297101449275362
7823480,4,6302277736,"i saw this one when it first came on t.v. and i liked it very much. the story of the kents moves to the next generation as philip's son take off for the west and finds a way is hard and full of many hardships. it gives this movie some powerful moments as we see what our forfathers went through to settle this wild land. i'm giving this 4 stars because is looks and feels like what it is ,just the set up for the rest of the novels to be filmed,so you are left hanging as to what happens next. for reasons i never understood they stoped after this one and made no more. maybe some day some one will do the rest of the story of the family kent.",1139788800,,643,3.9160305343511452
7823481,5,6302277736,I love this movie.  Saw it about 15 years ago on television and thought it was a great t.v. movie.  Have been looking for it for some time.  Can't wait to watch it again!!!,1132272000,,172,4.0

7823483,5,6302277736,"Okay, I bought this mini-series on VHS to add to my very extensive collection of all-things Randolph Mantooth.  I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the story. (But Randy still looks great and acts great through the entire thing!).
It's too bad they just don't make 'em like this anymore.  I miss the 1970's.
Oh, and ""Bravo!"" to Hannah Shearer, too.  Well done!",1056672000,2,367,4.703125
