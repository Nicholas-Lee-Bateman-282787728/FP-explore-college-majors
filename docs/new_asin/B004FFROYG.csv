8474302,3,B004FFROYG,"Not a bad documentary if you are a real avid fan of O'Connor. Very little live footage if any of him actually speaking or showing him hunting. I was hoping to see some live action but most of the documentary is made up of still photos that zoom in/pan in,out and around the photo to give you the feel of somewhat being on the field on his hunt.
Overall it is a good history of Jack and his family. There is some new insight of his relationship with his comrades and his family.",1414886400,,477,4.139784946236559
