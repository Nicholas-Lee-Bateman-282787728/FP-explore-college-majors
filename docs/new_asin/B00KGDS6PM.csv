It reminded me a bit of Hellraiser and Evil Dead. Definitely a fun one to watch with your friends on a saturday night!",1407888000,4,311,4.2

6425209,2,B00KGDS6PM,"I had never seen this movie prior to purchasing it but bought it based on the movie clips that accompanied it which looked great.
The problem was it was a totally different movie of the same name so buyer beware.
Instead of an American movie as shown in the movie clips that accompany the ad for the movie you get an Italian low budget horror movie with captions in English.
The one positive is Amazon was great to work with when I explained the problem and promptly refunded my purchase.",1425254400,2,488,4.433333333333334
6425210,1,B00KGDS6PM,"piece of crap not worth the dvd it is printed on.  You could use the dvd added to a few more for a nice wind chime maybe, at least it will sparkle in the sunlight.

I got this movie by accident thinking I had ordered The Pyramid  which is about some student archeologist that get trapped inside.  Oh well I just threw the movie in the trash.  I could not begin to rate this its below a D movie.  I think a 5th grader could have wrote and directed a better scrip.",1424044800,3,462,3.967391304347826
6425211,1,B00KGDS6PM,"Hold everything. Why is the trailer different than what i bought. please remove the trailer!. Now I wish i could have found the found footage trailer movie ...but i do like a 'd' level horror film especially a collaboration like trick or treat, etc. This was a three star for the movie it presented. the one star is for being misled. the description is accurate as i read it now in italian with subtitles, stories wrapped into one theme, low budget..it was pretty ok. Now to try to find the movie i wanted to watch. think this movie is overpriced it would be worth a watch or two but not for over 5 bucks and 3 shipping. anymore eh.",1416873600,3,632,4.319327731092437

6425213,5,B00KGDS6PM,"I was fortunate enough to have a private screening of this film when it was first released in Italy. It is a throw back to everything I love and cherish about 1980s horror. The main story line centers around a mystical pyramid totem that jumps from story to story in this horror anthology, each time adding a new element to an ever widening plot. The movie is filmed and directed well, and the characters kept me wanting to see more. There is plenty of gore, but not in the Saw or Hostile sense. Think Hellraiser meets Dawn of the Dead (the original).
If you're a true horror fan, it's absolutely worth seeing. I'm eager to see what Jack and Alex have in store for us next and I hope they stick to their 80's horror roots.",1410220800,2,722,4.3161764705882355
6425214,4,B00KGDS6PM,"Low budget shocker from Italy in the vein of hellraiser and Bava's Demons. Good acting and good gory effects, the plot is simple but quite entertaining. 4 stars out of 5",1408838400,4,169,4.483870967741935
8658302,3,B00KGDS6PM,"Yes, it's derivative of Hellraiser, but honestly that's not a bad thing. Decent stuff, but the anthology format doesn't work too well when you have two different actresses playing the same character in the film.",1520035200,,211,5.057142857142857
8658303,1,B00KGDS6PM,Couldn't finish it. Hard to keep your attention. If you like watching old school B movies this might be for you but just not good.,1467072000,,130,4.24
8658304,2,B00KGDS6PM,"This is a painfully slow movie. I finally gave up watching after I was half an hour in and realized I couldn't care less about resolving the plot. I had no connection to the characters and no investment in the antagonist. This movie steals a bunch of ideas from the Hellraiser franchise, but then doesn't seem to know what to do with them, so it just arranges them carefully in a row and hopes something will happen. The gore and body horror are tiresome, not very convincing, and don't really seem to go anywhere, and the malevolent force seems rather dull. Oooo, a pale asexual humanoid with white-out contacts...sooooo intriguing *eyeroll*.
Honestly, I feel a bit bad for the makers of this movie - it feels like someone's personal project,and I wish it had turned out better, but here we are. If I were you, I'd give this one a miss.

One more thing - though I couldn't care enough to sit through this in real-time, I did skim along the timeline to look at all the little thumbnails that popped up...based on the tiny pictures I saw, I would not hold out hope for a satisfactory ending.",1461196800,,1090,4.505050505050505

8658309,1,B00KGDS6PM,"Yet another garbage movie that appears to have paid for it's good reviews (see: Amazon goes after fake reviewers in suit). Complete waste of time: it's nothing more than a foreign low budget rip off of Hellraiser, (they use a pyramid instead of a cube) and once the puzzle is solved demonic forces come forth to wreck havoc. Don't waste your time.",1445212800,,347,4.612903225806452
