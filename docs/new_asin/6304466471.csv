889836,4,6304466471,"*** This review contains spoilers ***

This movie surprised me. I really enjoyed it. Lucy is stunning as a glamor star. She gets the soft focus and lighting, the glamor hair and makeup, but the showstopper is the glamor wardrobe. I've never seen her look more beautiful.

I did not know that Lucy had made it so far in her movie career as to be able to star as a glamor girl, opposite Bob Hope yet. Another notch on the resume of this fascinating woman.

My wife and I had just been discussing Lucy's talents as a straight actress and by coincidence this movie came on the next day. I had the opinion that Lucy was best in comedy and was not quite right in a straight role. This movie proved me wrong on that! She is convincing and when she kissed Bob I really believed it.

Bob is also great. His comedy style here is more subtle than usual, playing funny bits off in a straight style without the usual hamming. The bit with the hankie made me belly laugh.

The subject matter of this movie is similar to other movies of the early 60s as the sexual revolution was just starting...all clean and above board on the surface, yet doing their best to titillate us with sexual situations and innuendo. As I said in my review of Bob's ""I'll Take Sweden,"" I find this juvenile and boring. There's no shock value left by now, so it falls flat. However, this movie tackles more serious subjects than simply titillating sex, namely the subjects of infidelity, marriage, and marital boredom. That is more interesting and even in 2005 I found the subject matter moving and thought-provoking.

The script is tight and witty, with good dialog. The plot is also more or less water tight with plausible motivations.

Good stuff....worth watching.",1189987200,,1730,4.561290322580645
889837,5,6304466471,"It was really a Hollywood flurry and worry (I'm sure) when the greatest comics of the time (1960) embarked upon a true love story but with these pros there was no danger. A reworking of Brief Encounter emerged as a bitter sweet and humorous accidental love affair. These stars looked great, turned in Oscar performances and bowled over the fans. I Love Lucy already summed up, the Lucille Ball of TV returned to her motion picture roots and did not break stride and Mr. Bob Hope perhaps turned in the role of his career. Neither disappointed. All this was intentionally low key, no slap stick or outrageous capers. Fans who never saw Ms. Ball out of her ""Lucy"" role will be amazed at her great beauty and top notch acting and Mr. Hope will surprise you as the serious romantic leading man. There is the natural human comedy which only enhances the appeal of the motion picture. The gorgeous eyes over Hope's shoulders (ad catch line) will make you fall in love with Lucy all over again. This  film needs to be on DVD for posterity. Long live Lucy and Bob Hope.",1186704000,,1060,4.520833333333333
889838,3,6304466471,"A very charming little film about a husband and wife from two different marriages who wobble on the verge of adultery when they're stuck on a long-planned vacation without their respective spouses.  The script, by  Norman Panama and Melvin Frank (long-time writers for both Bob Hope and  Martin and Lewis) is a nice balance of wit and sentiment, and there's a  lovely performance by Lucille Ball--this is Lucille Ball the actress, not  Lucy the supreme and inspired dipstick--the ending, when she pulls away  from her almost-lover, despite her feelings for him, is genuniely  wrenching.
Unfortunately, the would-be lover is Bob Hope, who was OK in  vaudeville and radio, and in movies crafted as elaborations on his schtick  in these other mediums.  But Hope was a limited comedian at best, and was  never, NEVER an actor.  His attempts to have deeper feelings on screen are  almost embarassing.  With the right actor, such as James Stewart or Cary  Grant, this film might have been a minor classic.  As it is, it's certainly  worth having a look.  If only for Lucy.",946080000,9,1066,4.893258426966292

This movie is about two married couples, the two girls are friends and the two guys are  friends. They spend all their vacations together. But the married guy Bob  Hope and the married girl Lucy can't stand each other. But then when they  are about to go on vacation both Lucy's husband and Bob's wife cant go so  they have to go alone. Thats how it all begins with them falling in love.  It's a hilarious and romantic movie. A must see for all Bob Hope, Lucille  Ball, or just old time movie fans.",932688000,26,630,4.1652892561983474

890011,3,6304466471,"Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number! was critically panned when it first released in 1966, and, I think, justifiably so. There's a weak, dated sitcom vibe to this movie. It featured a creaky Bob Hope and a Phyllis Diller whose comic schtick doesn't hit on a universal level. It also stars the bodacious Elke Sommer who, here, plays the Divine Didi, an actress whose films are notorious more so for her dipping into sultry bubble baths than for her acting chops. As one awed teenager observes: ""Wow, is she ever copious."" But Didi is fed up with not being taken seriously. She storms out of the movie studio stark nekkid but for the residue of soap and bubbles. She jumps into her car and motors away in a huff. This is probably normal activity for Hollywood divas.

The media is all in a dither, what with articles of foul play sweeping newspaper headlines across the nation and rampant speculation and endless Didi sightings strafing the telly. And there's hapless real-estate agent Thomas J. Meade (Hope) lucking into her via the switchboard operator's goof and, so, an inadvertent connection on the phone between Meade and Didi.

Turns out, Didi's been hiding in a hotel room. She inveigles Meade into feeding her and allowing her to hole up in his cabin in rural Rocky Point, Oregon. It's the one piece of property Meade hadn't been able to unload to an unsuspecting client (he'd had to repeatedly scrawl a lower price on the real estate sign on the lawn until the last one reads: ""Make me an offer""). Meade's odd housekeeper (Diller) dubs it the ""no takers acre,"" never mind that she sunk her life savings in it. Today, Meade envisions selling the cabin for a profit, seeing as how he could now advertise it as someplace that the Divine Didi had stayed in.

For some dumb reason, Meade, contented family man, thinks he has to keep his wife (Marjorie Lord) and his housekeeper in the dark about his run-ins with Didi. It's what drives the plot. At this stage in his career, Bob Hope was pretty much past his prime. But he still had that knack for delivering the snappy one-liner. My favorite is probably that sly remark about Didi (""the biggest thing in bathtub since rings""). This is Hope's first of three colabs with comedienne Phyllis Diller, soon followed by Eight on the Lam (1967) and The Private Navy of Sgt. O'Farrell (1968). I admit that Phyllis Diller, with her fright wig and magpie cackle and her domestic/housewifey sense of humor, isn't up my alley. But I did like her sarcastic digs at Hope (and Hope's comebacks at her). And I like the loopy Phyllis Diller that tears thru the screen like an angel of anarchy in the film's third act, spreading chaos and lunacy and, as the police detain Meade on suspicion of foul play, hawking Meade's personal belongings as roadside merch at the scene of the crime. It all ends well, of course. But not before Hope drops a few more zingers and he reconciles with the wife and there's that madcap car chase and poor buxom Elke Sommer gets put thru the wringer. Sommer is a trooper, boy, because the film went out of its way to cast her as the central prop in various scenes heavy in physical comedy. She gets hung on a hook on the door. She careens down a muddy hill. She slides across the room, prone on a skateboard. She has to play asleep while Hope and Diller maneuver her like some life-sized doll.

Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number! is seriously dated, from the strained gags to the beehive hairdos to the more distinct phone numbers like ""Pomeroy 368."" This movie is perhaps best seen as a cinematic curiosity, its relevance resting on that two icons of comedy are in it, and, as well, a famous German bombshell, all doing their thing as much as a tired screenplay posing as a sex farce will let them.",1444089600,,3753,4.547337278106509

When I came across the pre-sale for this Blu-ray, I couldn't believe my eyes that they were finally releasing one of Lucille Ball's films in hi-def, so I pre-ordered it that day. Well, I was definitely not disappointed. I LOVED this movie! The adult themes of the story were great, while still retaining a more subtle brand of comedy than both Lucy and Bob were known for. The HD picture quality was great, even in B&W, and I was surprised to see that the movie was presented in a Widescreen format, as most movies back then were not. So I urge all fans of Lucille Ball, or Bob Hope, or both, to check this one out. You won't be disappointed.",1428105600,,776,4.25

890114,5,6304466471,"Yes, I suppose this film is rather hokey by today's standards, but I thoroughly enjoyed re-watching it. It proves that films in the 1960s could break with traditional mores and be sexy and even openly risqu without being overtly dirty, vulgar or debased. This is a really fun - and funny - film and Hope is in fine form.

Elke Sommer proves what a major star would endure as far as onscreen discomfort to achieve laughs at her own expense - something sadly and totally lacking with today's film star prima donnas. She is hilarious and beautiful and enjoyable to watch.

Phyllis Diller is true to her (then) form as a superb comedic foil providing both sidekick and straight man comic relief for Hope.

The worst part of the film is Marjorie Lord as Hope's wife and her 1960s hairdo. While it is obviously a wig, it is gross and disgusting and beyond outlandish and would give The Bride Of Frankenstein a run for her money. One of the worst things about the 1960's - other than the Mod way people dressed - was the beehive hairdos woman of all ages adopted. If one can look beyond this as an unfortunate - and pathetic - sign of the times, this is a really great, clever and highly entertaining film outing.

The one possible threat is the then-contemporary clavier view of people taking sleeping pills to relax and taking ""uppers"" to revive.

But all-in-all, it is a fun-to-view film that can be seen by people and children of all ages and enjoyed at all levels without real fear of offending anyone or exposing immorality to impressionable youth.

890204,4,6304466471,"In 1960, Lucille Ball had just finished ""The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour"" an extension of her television classic ""I Love Lucy"" which she had begun in 1951.  More importantly her co-star and husband Desi Arnaz and she had just undergone a not so amicable divorce after almost twenty years of marriage.  A diversion and a new career direction was needed, so Ball jumped at this opportunity to reestablish herself in feature films.  An added inducement was her co-star Bob Hope an old friend with whom she had worked successfully in two movies in the late 1940's.  As it turned out she chose well, not only was the film a hit, but Ms. Ball gave one of her best dramatic portrayals right up there with ""Stage Door"", ""Dance, Girl Dance"" and ""The Big Street"".

The film opens at a country club's Halloween Ball  in an upper middle class suburb of Pasadena.  Kitty Weaver (Lucille Ball) is bored and disenchanted; her husband Jack (Don DeFore) is down in the club basement gambling.  She is less than amused at the comic patter of Larry Gilbert (Bob Hope) who is acting emcee, she's heard his same jokes one too many times and in her ennui says aloud a couple of the punch lines to Larry's annoyance.  Both find the other irritating, but Larry's wife Mary (Ruth Hussey) and Kitty are best friends and Larry and Jack good pals so they tolerate each other.  The next day the Weavers and Gilberts are set to go on a vacation to Acapulco with their mutual friends Doc and Connie Mason.  Neither Kitty nor Larry want to go, each are tired of the constant vacations together as a group which they do to get a better rate and save money.  The Weavers marriage is in trouble, Jack's an inveterate gambler with a roving eye, they are starting to have money problems and Kitty is rapidly getting fed up.  The Gilberts marriage has gone stale, Mary is sensible and practical and preoccupied with the children and house, and Larry is frustrated in his attempts to try to make love to her that evening.  Come morning unforeseen emergencies force both Jack and Mary to remain home, but both insist the reluctant Kitty and Larry go on to Acapulco with the Masons.  The first day out, the Masons succumb to severe cases of Montezuma's Revenge, and Kitty and Larry are thrown together.  On a fishing trip they are surprised to discover they both attended the same high school, and further unbend particularly after Larry helps Kitty land an enormous marlin, and she spontaneously kisses him.  They suddenly are aware of a strong attraction between them that builds through the week, as the Masons are still confined to their room and Kitty and Larry spend all their time together.  By the end of the vacation they have fallen in love with one another.  How will they handle their situation when they return to Pasadena?

For Ball and Hope this movie was quite the departure from their usual comic personas, especially for Lucille Ball.  Her disillusioned, dissatisfied Kitty Weaver who falls unexpectedly in love with her best friend's husband was quite a stretch from her loveable Lucy Ricardo.  Can you imagine Lucy Ricardo falling in love with Fred Mertz, and contemplating an affair behind Ethel's back, NO WAY!  Still, this was another instance of art imitating life, like her movie husband Jack Weaver, her real life hubby Desi Arnaz had been both a gambler and a philanderer, and their divorce was a contentious one.  There is a restless edge and an underlying asperity in Ball's playing, which from what I've read was apparently the way she was at that point in her life.  Her character rings true to life though for a lot of women at that timeframe and I feel her role is the more interesting and well-developed of the two.  This movie was released in 1960, the start of a decade that would tear asunder the fabric of American life.  Three years later Betty Friedan would publish the seminal work of the Women's Liberation movement, ""The Feminine Mystique"".  Kitty Weaver is the prototype of the unfulfilled, bored housewife Ms. Friedan writes about, who wants more from her life but is unsure how to go about it.  Ms. Ball does have some of the slapstick, comic moments for which she was renowned, but this film was a definite departure for her, and a chance to stretch her dramatic acting muscles.

Bob Hope's Larry Gilbert doesn't come off quite as well, perhaps because of a lot of the trademark Hope wisecracks remained, and he has some zany physical comedy also, so his fans wouldn't be disappointed.  Maybe too I didn't quite feel the sympathy for Larry whose wife Mary is a nice person and a good spouse and mother, she just needs a vacation alone with Larry so they can reconnect.  Contrasted with the smug, self-satisfied Jack Weaver who blatantly lies about reforming from his gambling habit to Kitty, has an eye for the ladies, and takes Kitty for granted, Larry seems the more fortunate, and Mary doesn't deserve to be deceived.  However, like Ms. Ball, this is not a typical Bob Hope portrayal, and Hope gets a rare chance to succeed in a comedy with dramatic overtones. Ms. Ball and he have a fine camaraderie together in this the best of their four film appearances together, and both were nominated for Golden Globes for Best Comedy or Musical Performance for 1960.

As their mates Ruth Hussey and Don DeFore fulfill their duties nicely, unfortunately as I mentioned Mary is an overly complacent housewife and Jack a bit of a stinker so the viewer isn't overly interested in them.  Comedian Louis Nye is appropriately slick and eager as Hamilton Busbee a mutual friend of Kitty's and Larry's whom they run into at a most inopportune moment, and veteran supporting actor Robert F. Simon is drily sarcastic as a suspicious motel manager.  This would also be the final appearance of Louise Beavers as Gussie the Gilberts maid, her prolific career in supporting roles stretched back to the 1920's.

The script by the team of Melvin Frank and Norman Panama is a good one, nice blend of the comic and the dramatic, and as previously mentioned shows off the Ball-Hope combo to their best advantage.  They also served as co-producers and directors as well.  Art direction by the team of J. McMillan Johnson, Kenneth A. Reid, and Ross Dowd is very good with the exteriors in ""Acapulco"" (read the Hollywood area) with interiors giving a snapshot of an affluent, self satisfied American middle class, they got an Oscar nod.  The sole Oscar winners were Edith Head and Edward Stevenson for Best Black and White Costume Design, primarily for Lucille Ball's clothes.  She is beautifully dressed particularly one evening gown she wears in Acapulco to dinner, very elaborate with a full, bouffant skirt.  Yet this makes nonsense of an earlier caustic statement that Kitty makes to Jack about not being able to afford to buy a new girdle when she is very glamorously dressed like Lucille Ball the movie star in most of the film.  Oh well, just overlook it and enjoy the very chic Ms. Ball.  A bouncy title song by Johnny Mercer sung in brassy style by Steve Lawrence and Edie Gorme over some cute animated title sequences by the expert graphic designer Saul Bass establishes the right mood at the beginning.

""The Facts of Life"" although lighthearted, is in some ways is a harbinger of things to come in the turbulent 1960's, i.e.  Women's Liberation and the Sexual Revolution.  Regardless, it's bright and entertaining, yet there is a rueful, wistful quality especially in the last few minutes that makes the movie rather bittersweet. I highly recommend it, whether you are fans of Lucy and Bob or not.  Right now, it's unfortunately unavailable in DVD, but still in VHS, hopefully it will be rereleased soon.  In the meantime, it's occasionally shown on Turner Classic Movies; keep an eye out for it.",1373932800,,7781,4.74517087667162

890317,4,6304466471,"Didi (Elke Sommer) is a sexy European actress who is famous for bathing scenes in which her nudity is tantalizingly half-hidden by bubbles, but she is fed up with being merely a sex object. She wants to be taken seriously and given meaningful roles. In order to make a strong point about that to her director/manager Pepe (Cesare Danova), she flees from her current movie in Hollywood and drives up the California coast until she arrives in a tiny town in Oregon. While hiding out in a hotel there, the switchboard operator accidentally connects her with real estate agent Tom Meade (Bob Hope). Didi inadvertently gives away her identity to Tom, begs him to keep her secret, and plays on his sympathy to get him to bring her some food since she can't go out and get some herself. Tom's housekeeper Lily (Phyllis Diller) overhears the call, creating the major setup of the movie, a comedy of errors in which Tom is manipulated by DiDi, Tom tries to manipulate her, and Lily is continually spying on Tom and dropping heavy-handed hints that she suspects he is cheating on his wife. Tom knows his wife wouldn't approve of him having anything to do with a woman as gorgeous as Didi, but Tom sees dollar signs more than a potential affair when he convinces Didi to stay at a cabin in the woods he's been trying unsuccessfully to sell for ages. He hopes to increase its value and sales potential by claiming, after she leaves, that ""Didi stayed here.""

This is a fun movie for fans of Phyllis Diller and Bob Hope. They play off of each other for laughs extremely well. It's a good example of the bedroom farces of the 1960's in which there is plenty of sexual misbehavior hoped for, comically avoided, or assumed to be happening by various characters, but no sex (or nudity) actually occurs. All the naughtiness is merely a big misunderstanding. This sex-farce format allowed conservative moviegoers of the era to enjoy guilt-free, pseudo-illicit thrills.

890319,3,6304466471,"Bob Hope plays a husband, who mistakenly gets involved with a temperamental starlet, in Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number (1966), a sometimes amusing sex comedy, that also features the talents of the alluring Elke Sommer, and the sarcastic wit of Phyllis Diller.

Tired of acting roles that primarily feature her voluptuous body, the Divine Miss Didi (Sommer), refuses to get into a bathtub full of bubbles on a studio set.  When her husband Pepe Pepponi (Casare Danova) drops her into the tub against her will, Didi snaps, runs away, and goes into hiding at a hotel in Rocky Point, Oregon.

Real estate salesman Tom Meade (Hope) is trying to phone his wife Martha (Marjorie Lord), but is mistakenly connected to Didi's hotel room.  She reveals her identity, and asks Tom to bring her some food.  Unaware that his housekeeper Lily (Diller) has been listening in, Meade leaves for his ""secret"" rendezvous with the luscious Didi.

Tom offers Didi the use of an isolated cabin in the woods, so she can avoid her husband who is searching for her, but they part on less than the best of terms.  Tom is shocked when police detectives arrive at his home the following day, to question him about the disappearance of the missing actress.

The film's big comedic moments occur up at the cabin, where Didi has gone to stay, at the same time that Martha and Tom have planned to slip away for a little personal time.  Sommer and Diller display their talents for physical comedy, while Hope does a soft shuffle, trying to keep his wife from learning the truth.  Things don't go well, and Tom is a person of interest, when the police can't find Miss Didi.

While the relationship between Hope and Sommer could have been better developed, and the film's conclusion seems a bit messy, those who appreciate Hope's low key approach to humor, will find some genuine funny moments here.  Phyllis Diller's contribution to the comedy is significant, and more boisterous, highlighted by some crazy moments on a motorcycle.  Marjory Lane is also very good.

At age 63, the legendary Hope may be near end of his movie career, but the comedian's affable charm is still going strong.  He doesn't seem out of place with the much younger Elke Sommer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Shot-in-the-Dark/dp/B0009S4J3M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Shot in the Dark</a>, The Wrecking Crew), who at 26 was in her prime as a sex kitten, and in the film is frequently covered only by soap bubbles.  The DVD features both widescreen and full screen versions of this entertaining 60's romp.  Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number is included in the Bob Hope MGM Movie Legends Collection, which at this time, might be an economical way to acquire the film.",1327104000,2,2743,4.902597402597403
890320,4,6304466471,"Through the years, screen legends Lucille Ball (1916-1989) and Bob Hope (1903-2003) collaborated in films four times.  The Facts of Life (1960) is their third film together, and ranks with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fancy-Pants/dp/B0001ZWLTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fancy Pants</a>&nbsp;(1950) as one of their better efforts.  Although many today may have become familiar with the ""Queen of Comedy "" through her various TV sitcoms, Lucille Ball was a very talented actress, who also had a significant movie career.  Her performance here is a fine example of her dramatic acting skills.  Mr. Hope is also very good, just slightly toning down his trademark one-liners and quips, in this sensitive drama that recounts the development of a love affair among a group of close friends.

Every year, three couples, the Gilberts, the Weavers, and the Masons, residents of Pasadena, customarily take a vacation together, and this time their destination is Acapulco.  Ad man Larry Gilbert (Hope) and Kitty Weaver (Ball) don't particularly like each other, but circumstances bring them together as reluctant companions, when each of their spouses has to stay back for a few days.  After the Masons' come down with some kind of bug, Larry and Kitty discover that they have things in common while they are deep sea fishing.  Love begins to bloom, as the couple spends the rest of their time together, leaving things a bit unsettled when the vacationers all return to their ""normal"" lives.

Neither Ruth's husband Jack (Don DeFore), nor Larry's wife Ruth (Mary Gilbert), seems very interested in what happened in Acapulco.  Constantly running into each other at various events, and with some feelings of guilt, Kitty and Larry eventually attempt to pursue their relationship.  Even though standards may have relaxed today, fidelity is still important, and the film still has an impact.  The couple somewhat naively attempt to conduct an illicit affair, and are nearly recognized while at a drive-in theater.  Always the smooth talker, Gilbert attempts to lie his way out of a number of tight spots, but when checking into a motel with Kitty, a frazzled Gilbert signs the register as ""Mr. and Mrs. G. Washington"".

In a winning performance, Lucille Ball nicely captures the feeling of being in love, mixed with guilt, remorse, and trepidation.  Written and directed by Melvin Frank there isn't a hint of anything cheap or sleazy in the film, that ends up in a rather conventional fashion.  With quality dialog, strong acting performances, and sophisticated humor, this fine film was recognized by being nominated for five Academy Awards.

The DVD is a dual sided disc with the full screen version on one side, and widescreen on the other.  Image quality of the black and white print is very good.  As yet, this film has not been released separately on DVD, but was included in the Bob Hope MGM Legends box set.

890321,3,6304466471,"The Bob Hope MGM Legends Collection contains seven of the funny man's films, spanning over two decades of Hope's illustrious screen career.  Bob Hope (1903-2003) got his start in vaudeville, and enjoyed a successful career in radio and on the stage, and became a huge star in film and on television.  In the movies, Hope's style was usually characterized by fast talking, witty repartee, and generally being light on his feet.  After teaming with Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour, in The Road To Singapore (1940), the first of the seven ""Road"" pictures, Hope's career elevated to new heights.

In chronological order, the films in this collection are They've Got Me Covered (1943), The Princess and the Pirate (1944), Alias Jesse James (1959), The Facts of Life (1960), The Road to Hong Kong (1962), I'll Take Sweden (1965), and Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number (1966).  A quick summary of the films follows:

They've Got Me Covered (3.5 stars)
Set in Washington D.C. during World War II, Hope plays a newspaper reporter who is on the trail of some Axis agents who are trying to implement a nefarious plan.  Dorothy Lamour co-stars.

The Princess and the Pirate (3.5 stars)
Bob plays an entertainer on a ship bound for America, who gets tangled up with a princess (Virginia Mayo), when the ship is captured by pirates.

Alias Jesse James (3 stars)
Set in the American West, Hope is an insurance salesman who sells Jesse James (Wendell Corey) a life insurance policy, and then has to try and make sure that no harm comes to the infamous outlaw.

The Facts of Life (4 stars)
Comedic legend Lucille Ball co-stars with Bob in this sensitive and funny drama about marriage, love, and fidelity.  Not to be missed.

The Road to Hong Kong (2.5 stars)
The final installment in the ""Road"" series finds Hope and partner Bing Crosby involved in an out of this world escapade, as Russians agents send the pair on a rocket trip to the moon.  Joan Collins co-stars.

I'll Take Sweden (3 stars)
Hope is a father worried that his daughter (Tuesday Weld) may marry the wrong guy.  He takes her to Sweden to derail her wedding plans, but once there, both father and daughter find romance heating up.

Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number (1966) (3.5 stars)
Elke Sommer plays a starlet looking to get away from it all, who gets a misrouted telephone call from a real estate salesman (Hope), which instigates a kooky escapade that threatens to break up two marriages.

These seven films illustrate that while Bob Hope's unique comic style evolved through the years, in many respects, it remained essentially the same.  Ranging from Westerns, to swashbuckling tales, to wartime adventures, to the close of the Crosby era, to coming to terms with the beatnik generation, the affable guy with the quick wit, endless quips, and ski slope nose was there to entertain.  As this set has apparently gone out of production, getting a copy may unfortunately be a difficult and expensive proposition.

Due to a glitch at Amazon, this set and the film Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number are linked as being the same product, so this review is listed for both products.",1325980800,,3118,4.717712177121771

""Alias Jesse James"" is a late 50's offering with some surprisingly entertaining comedy elements from such satirical Hope westerns as ""The Paleface"". Hope plays an Eastern insurance salesman who sells a life insurance policy to THE notorious outlaw Jesse James---then must travel West to protect his ""investment"" so he can't cash in. ""Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number!"" (1966) demonstrates Hope's erratic film career during the 60's. A realtor (Hope) gets his wires crossed--literally!--with a beautiful European actress (Elke Sommers, of course) who's known more for bubble bath scenes than her acting. The beauty goes into hiding from Hollywood & it's up to Hope to hide her..which isn't easy with a wife (Marjorie Lord) & a snoopy housekeeper (the wild-haired Phyllis Diller, who trades some funny lines with Hope)around. The script is sometimes sparse in laughs, but it has its moments. The real delight is ""The Facts of Life"" (1960), a good ""adult"" comedy about married people (who are married to others) who, at first, can't stand each other, then are surprised when they drift into an affair! This was proof that both Hope & Lucille Ball could deftly handle more than just broad comedies & TV sitcoms. ""I'll Take Sweden"" (1965) seems to be just another teen-oriented 60's flick, but offers more as a generational gap commentary. Hope plays Dad to Tuesday Weld, and puts up with teen idol Frankie Avalon. ""The Princess and the Pirate"" (1944) lets Hope plunder a treasure trove of laughs in the pirate genre with this splashy Technicolor MGM offering. While ""The Road to Hong Kong"" (1962) finds Hope & Bing Crosby getting a bit long in the tooth for this kind of silliness, it does manage to score some funny moments. Peter Sellers steals his scene as an Indian doctor, and Dorothy Lamour brightens the picture in what seems to be (sadly) a glorified cameo appearance (young Joan Collins replaces her as leading lady). The film has something to do with a top secret rocket fuel formula, and is modernized into a 60's James Bond-ish flick. ""They've Got Me Covered"" (1943) is another good Hope vehicle, with him playing a hapless reporter getting up to his ears in espionage with Nazis..AND trying to marry his fiance (Lamour).

890374,3,6304466471,"Unfortunately this film was not actor-comedian Bob Hope's finest hour. In fact, it appeared in the subjective book ""The Fifty Worst Movies Of All Time"".
That aside, it has a largely juvenile plot revolving around the old comedy routine of mistaken identities and white lies escalating to high farce. It's just not very witty. Hope was only as good as his writers and in this case, I believe the writers were not very good. I usually enjoy Hope's work, though.
It also has an interestingly outdated music score for 1966 (I actually don't mind that).
The film is notable for being the screen debut of comedian Phyllis Diller, who was discovered by Hope. The lovely Elke Sommer, a German lady, plays the part of fictitious French celebrity Didi but Ms Sommer delivers her lines in her thick German accent. Work that one out!
The DVD of this film, in its slimline pack, is dual-sided. One side is in the theatrical release ratio of 1.85:1 and the other is in re-formatted 1.33:1 (4:3) for older television sets if you don't want to see any black bars. There are no extras. The disc is closed captioned and has subtitles in English, Spanish and French. The picture quality is good, with nice colour (originally by Deluxe) and the sound is fine.

890435,5,6304466471,"Did women really wear their hair this way in 1966. That sight alone on two of the lead females was worth the price of admission. The guys, too, while not quite matching the girls in quaintness to 2010 eyes, came in a close second with those shrunken fedoras they sport throughout.
Starting with these laughs which were unplanned when the film was made, there are many more in this Bob Hope vehicle, which relies more on old-fashioned slapstick than on the typical Hope gags. While having little more to do than show her body, deliver a few accented lines, and be somewhat manhandled in closeups unsuitable to a stunt double, Elke Sommer still more than earned her pay by just being second banana to Hope. Phyllis Diller, a frequent support player to Hope in his various comedy venues in those years, does her particular thing well. True she was an acquired taste, as they say, but in this film, she does provide some fun. The remainder of the supporting cast do what is required of them to give the star his laughs. Hope, himself, nearing the end of his film career, has better material and, therefore, more laughs than some of the other films he made as it became only a marginal activity to being America's favorite comic here and abroad. At this time, he had something like one-third of the twenty all time hit shows on TV with his specials devoted to his entertainment of the troops, most recently in Viet Nam, where a bitter struggle was rapidly escalating.
So for many good laughs, no irony or wit, no character development, no symbolic meanings, a story line just strong enough to carry the sight and sound gags, I can, still laughing, recommend this as feather-light, totally escape, viewing.",1273968000,3,1700,4.688963210702341

The theme, as with so many themes in 1950-1970 comedies, is a mild slapstick farce where a man's devotion to marriage is challenged.  Bob Hope is loyal to his wife but a misdialing of the phone gets him mixed up with a sexy movie starlet(played pefectly by Elke Sommer).  The rumor at the time in Hollywood is that Hope had requested to make this film with her as co-star.  I can't confirm that, but seeing the film, you could understand if he did.

890444,4,6304466471,"There is something splendid about this little comedy starring two of the most hilariously on-point comedic minds of all time; Bob Hope and Lucille Ball.  Yes, even though some of the gags don't quite work, Ball and Hope are never short of amazing and they help to elevate the `at times' ridiculousness of the script.  I say `at times' and I mean it, because for the most part this movie delivers quite strongly.  It is only in parts where things don't quite add up.

Ball and Hope play Kitty and Larry respectively.  Neither can stand one another yet both are married to the others best friend.  Kitty is married to Jack, a nice and responsible man, and Larry is married to Mary, a charming bride; but both Mary and Jack are at times too preoccupied with their own lives that Kitty and Larry wind up feeling neglected.  When a routine vacation goes awry, and Larry and Kitty find themselves in paradise; alone, the unthinkable happens; they fall in love.

They try and force their feelings for one another onto the backburner, but everyday life continues to throw them into each other company, and those feelings begin to fester and grow.

`The Facts of Life' may be dated, but it never feels that way.  It was made in the 60's yet the issue of adultery is still very much a taboo subject and is still very prevalent.  The idea of sneaking around and repressing feelings is not an uncommon practice and so `The Facts of Life' has not lost points due to the change in times.  In fact, this movie could really, frame for frame, have come out last year for all we know; it feels that `modern'.  The performances are also wonderful.  Bob Hope and Lucille Ball were true stars, and it shows on every frame.  Ball in my opinion truly steals the show here though and she manages to make herself even more lovely and sympathetic than on her hit television show.

The script is, for the most part, quite solid.  Like I mentioned, there are a few areas where some tweaking could have been done, but it's never a hindrance.  I for one found the `drive in movie' scene to be a tad unnecessary, yet I found the `convertible top fiasco' scene to be a riot.

That said; the film truly deserves to be seen and adored.

It's a rarity these days to find a film that tackles this very subject with objectivity and just the right amount of humor.  We all know that what these two people are doing is wrong, and they know it too; but unlike so many movies today, we are able to ride the balanced line of understanding and disapproval.  In films today the adulterers are either made to be extremely unsympathetic or they are overly sympathetic.  We are either rooting for them are firmly against them.  Thankfully `The Facts of Life' paints a picture of two average individuals we can understand and appreciate for their good, and their bad traits.",1225756800,,2826,4.517716535433071

890466,3,6304466471,"It may be safe to say that Bob Hope is a Hollywood legend.  He achieved this status through some decent acting and comic timing, along with his USO tours and a few really good movies (most notably, his Road pictures with Bing Crosby).  Somewhere along the way, however, I think Bob Hope became a bit of a caricature of himself and his later work didn't really display how good he once was.  The MGM Movie Legends Collection of seven of his movies shows the gradual decline in the quality of his work.  (To be fair, however, a lot of the failings in these films were beyond his ability to fix.)

The first movie (chronologically) is They Got Me Covered, a World War II movie with Hope as a bumbling war correspondent and Dorothy Lamour as his love interest.  He is given a lead on a complex sabotage plot, but his informant is soon killed and the only copy of the notes are in an untranslatable shorthand.  This film and the second in the set - The Princess and the Pirate - have Hope at his peak.  This second picture has Hope as a 17th century version of a vaudevillian who rescues an incognito princess from a vicious pirate.  Unfortunately, he also has the pirate's treasure map, which makes him a very wanted individual.

While the first two movies are on practically the same level as Hope's best movies, a slight decline is seen in the next one, Alias Jesse James, in which he plays an insurance salesman who has sold a policy to the famous outlaw.  Now, he has to make sure James stays alive.  There's a lot of good humor in this one, but sometimes Hope seems to be doing a Lou Costello imitation, and the attempt to capture the glory of his earlier comic westerns (such as The Paleface) is only partially successful.

The Facts of Life is the movie where the films really start to go downhill.  Though still passable, this comedy-drama has Hope and Lucille Ball trying to cheat on their respective spouses and finding an affair is not as easy as it seems.  I would imagine at the time that this was a disappointment to many Hope (and Ball) fans who would have expected something a bit more comic and less serious.

Road to Hong Kong is an improvement, thanks to the easy chemistry of Hope and Crosby, but the third member of the Road pictures, Lamour, is relegated to a cameo appearance, and female lead Joan Collins is no Lamour.  Nonetheless, the formula is tried and true and works.

The last two movies in the set are easily the worst.  In I'll Take Sweden, Hope plays a widowed father of Tuesday Weld.  Hope is the ultimate square, and though the film seems to mock teenagers, it actually just makes Hope look dumb.  Frankie Avalon is Weld's love interest, but Hope doesn't like him, so he moves off to Switzerland, where she falls for someone even worse.  The final film, Boy, Did I Get a Wrong Number, is little more than a sitcom episode, with Hope accidentally getting entangled with a movie star.  It's one of those stories that could be resolved quickly and cleanly if Hope just speaks the truth immediately, but he doesn't and the forced wackiness ensues.

The last movies are riddled with bad dialogue, contrived plots and cheap-looking sets, all of which were things beyond Hope's control.  I do feel, however, that by the time of these films, Hope had been typecast into a role as himself, just spouting off one-liners and seeming like a stand-up comic more than an actor; in fact, in I'll Take Sweden, his character's name (Bob Holcomb) is practically his own.

The set offers little in the way of extras beyond trailers.  In the Amazon rating system, the first two movies rate a high four stars, Road to Hong Kong a low four, Alias Jesse James a high three, The Facts of Life a low three, and the last pair barely two stars.  Overall, I am giving the set three stars; while it's got some good films, it also is a poor showcase for exactly how good Hope could be.",1223164800,6,3887,4.482954545454546

890470,4,6304466471,"I sprang at the chance to get this box set and bought it for far more than Amazon's dirt cheap price from a leading electronics retailer. I'd never heard of most of these films, and for good reason: they've never been on video before. I always find Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide helpful, and so it proved in this case. However, as regards Bob Hope, while both of us are big fans, my sensibilities somewhat differ from his on some of these films. Therefore, I'm listing the seven films, giving Maltin's view when available, and my own view. My overall sense is simply of gratitude that Bob Hope's films have finally made it to DVD. I can't wait to watch them all, and will be reviewing more of them as they are released. I also cannot forget what Bob Hope did for the troops before it was trendy to do so, and how greatly his shows on video contrast with the vulgar comedy and musical groups that now are foisted on the troops. Thanks for the memories, Bob, and thanks that, finally on DVD, Hope springs eternal. Seven discs in individual cases in a slip case with brief notes.

The Road to Hong Kong was the last ""Road"" picture. A DVD guide I read said they made one too many, and ought to have left this one off. However, this has always been one of my favorites. Leonard Maltin gives it 2.5 stars and says, ""while fun, it lacks the carefree spirit of its predecessors"". One sided disc, widescreen, 92 minutes, black and white, 1962.

Boy Did I Get a Wrong Number. Leonard Maltin calls this a BOMB, his lowest rating. I agree, although one may want to watch it once anyway. Double sided disc: full screen on one side, widescreen on the other. 99 minutes, color, 1996.

Alias Jesse James. Leonard Maltin gives it three stars and calls it ""one of Hope's funniest"". The Western theme didn't hold me and I found it a big snooze. Double sided disc: full screen and widescreen. 92 minutes, color, 1959.

The Facts of Life. Leonard Maltin gives it three stars and calls it a ""sophisticated comedy"". Bob Hope co-stars with Lucille Ball in one of her semi-dramatic roles. Maltin says ""The two stars make a good team worth watching"". I agree. I'll watch Lucy in anything, and that rather goes for Hope as well. Here's one of those ""almost an affair"" movies, full of subtle innuendo, before the late 'sixties brought out such bilge as Myra Brekinridge and the so-called sexual revolution which, after failing in society, was later shoehorned into popular culture to shore up the declining quality in TV and movies. Double sided disc: full screen and widescreen. 104 minutes, black and white, 1960.

They Got Me Covered. Leonard Maltin gives it two stars and says it ""was topical at the time, awkward now; not up to Hope standards."" Here we diverge. I found this spy yarn the most enjoyable film in the set. The writing is almost as scintillating as in My Favorite Brunette. Bob Hope plays a broadly comic, but vulnerable and flawed character, somewhat out of his usual ouvre. One sided, full frame disc. 94 minutes, black and white, 1942.

I'll Take Sweden. Leonard Maltin gives it two stars, calling it a ""pseudo-sexy Hope vehicle"" with ""witless proceedings"". Since it's from 1965, it had to be conflicted about relationships, but as with Doris Day's films, it's a comedy by Shakespeare's definition, which means it ends in marriage. A chance to see Tuesday Weld, Frankie Avalon, up and coming stars of the '60s, along with Hope and Dina Merrill, stars of the '50s. Lavish animated titles. One sided disc. 97 minutes, color, 1965.

The Princess and the Pirate.  Leonard Maltin gives it three stars and calls it ""one of Bob's wackiest"". This is the sort of '40s ""something for everyone"" box office smash that I can't get into. Virginia Mayo is, nonetheless, outstanding. Maltin likes the younger Walter Brennan in this film, in which he plays a pirate; I like the older Brennan much better in The Gnome Mobile and The Real McCoys.

Worse, FOX is deceptive in simply stating ""widescreen"" on the box and disc cases whether the film is anamorphic or not. Adding to the annoyance is that the three anamorphic discs are flipper discs with full screen versions on the other side. Therefore, you really don't know what you are getting.

By far, the two standouts are The Princess and the Pirate & They Got Me Covered. Alias Jesse James is available for the first time on DVD, it's his last comedy-western & a pretty good one. After this it's a drop off in quality. The Road to Hong Kong is the weakest of the Road movies & pretty lame, to boot. The Facts of Life co-stars Lucille Ball & is good, as all the Hope-Ball pairings. The Facts of Life & I'll Take Sweden are Hope vehicles that aim at getting a younger audience & are mixed bags. The former co-stars Frankie Avalon & Annette Funicello, the latter has Elke Sommer (eye candy). Boy, Did I Get a Wrong number has Hope's first pairing with Phyllis Diller that's not among his best.

This set concentrates more on Hope's later period (early to mid sixties) which is past his prime as to the quality of the movies. It's the other three movies that really make this set worthwhile. Here's how I would rate these movies on an individual basis:
1) The Princess and the Pirate*****
