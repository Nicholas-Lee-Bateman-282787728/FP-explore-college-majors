2840747,5,B000QUEQ6I,"Reviewers have already mentioned that the songs used in the episodes are intact in this series, so I won't mention it again.  Oops, I just did.

Anyhoo, the transfer quality is top notch.  After watching this series for so many years on Channel 11 in New York and occasionally on TV Land, it's wonderful to see the rich vibrant colors of the 70's on the dvd.  My senses are so alive!  Example, watching the ""Golden Earrings"" episode last night, I noticed for the first time how beautiful the greyhound was.  What a nice doggie!

Also, even the hardest of hardcore OC fans will find scenes they never saw before.  All the scenes WPIX, TV Land, and syndication edited out are back in.  Each edited scene is like a wonderful little nugget of discovery as you watch these episodes again.

Gratzi!  Mille Gratzi Paramount!  It took you long enough, but hopefully sales will show that the demand for this DVD series is a long time coming.",1188345600,8,932,4.581818181818182
2840748,5,B000QUEQ6I,"I was fearful when i read that the episodes have been tampered with due to musical sequences. DO NOT WORRY! The episodes are AS COMPLETE as when they first ran on network television back in 70- 71 season. They are hilarious as ever. Worth every cent. Took a long time to see this show on dvd, and well worth the wait. Although there are no xtras on the disc. IT doesn't matter, we have all the xtras we need on season 1. Buy them both, you won't regret it. PERFECT PICTURE and SOUND! BRAVO PARAMOUNT!",1188000000,29,500,4.273684210526316
2840749,5,B000QUEQ6I,"While the box has the edit and music replacement warning, don't panic. I'm in the process of reviewing The Odd Couple Season 2 for Insidepulse. Every episode is between 25 minutes and 20 to 35 seconds. We're not being given slashed episode.  In the Odd Couple Meet Their Host, Felix belts out all the themes to the old radio shows. Rigetto has all the opera tunes and the popular tune at the end. This is not WKRP as far as I can tell. If you want the show - please buy it.",1187740800,36,473,4.141304347826087
2840750,5,B000QUEQ6I,"Let's face it.  Other than a 3-hour Tony Randall tribute marathon, ""The Odd Couple"" has not been seen on TV Land since 2002.  And considering the direction that TV Land is going, it is not likely to come back any time soon.

So I put forth this question to Odd Couple fans everywhere:  Would you rather watch ""The Odd Couple"" with a few music changes, or not at all?  I recently bought WKRP in Cincinatti Season 1 which was also hacked to bits.  But it didn't bother me.  I am not a purist, I just want a few laughs when I come home from school.  And any amount of Odd Couple will surly give me that.

I do have season 1 of The Odd Couple, which is one of the best I have ever seen.  And I for one am very glad that there was enough demand to bring on season 2.  So quit complaining and enjoy what you're given.",1187481600,2,811,4.00625
2840751,5,B000QUEQ6I,"That's sad to hear. As a kid, I was actually turned on to Opera by watching the Odd Couple and the music episodes were by far my favorite. The Paul Williams song was for me, one of the most amazing sitcome moments. I love that song. I actually have it on tape somewhere. If they cut that song out of the episode, I would think it would make more sense to just delete that entire episode from the set as well as the other musical episodes.  This way we still get the set but we don't have to sit through and episode that's cut up and leaves us feeling angry that what we remember isn't there. To me, that would be the solution. I'll still buy the sets. Season 1 was not my favorite so I'm looking forward to 2-5 but it saddens me to think people have waited years and years only to get a subpar product. I guess time will tell.",1187308800,,826,4.067484662576687
2840752,5,B000QUEQ6I,"I much fear music alterations but I'm sure they won't cut Felix's ""Let Them Be"". I hope they keep the song Paul Williams sang to Edna. Really hits home for me. Did ya know he wrote that the day of the taping? But that's another season.

Important thing is to buy, buy, buy this set!

Gotta go. I have to go follow Paul Williams to Albany.",1186617600,3,338,4.106060606060606

Part of popular culture; fastidious Felix and the slouch Oscar...Tony (real first name Leonard, just like his son's name on the show) Randall & Jack Klugman starring. The second season of The Odd Couple is the first with a completely new set.  (The first season, utilized a set not much different, if at all, from the film version of The Odd Couple starring Walter Matthau & Jack Lemmon.)I'm sure opinion varies as to whether one prefers this period of the show, with the new slicker, brighter (seemingly more vibrant---technically speaking) modern set, versus the original set.  But both versions (so to speak) are enjoyable, of course. So enjoy, as the Odd Couple is most assuredly a classic sitcom with most memorable characters and able writing. Cheers",1180310400,45,1620,5.431451612903226
2840754,5,B000QUEQ6I,"Music alterations are regrettable, and do detract from enjoyment of the episodes, but the cost considerations that generate them won't disappear, and the networks will not change their behavior. If fans don't support the season releases, the networks will not improve them, they will stop issuing them. The Odd Couple is one of the finest sitcoms of the 1970's,and while I would prefer to have the series DVD's uncut and of high quality, I'll accept a few deficiencies rather than not have them at all.",1179964800,20,502,4.91764705882353
2840755,4,B000QUEQ6I,"The Odd Couple is my favorite sit-com of all time. And the DVD release of Season 1 was pretty much perfect. Season 2 is where The Odd Couple really hit its stride, and I (and I believe most fans) greatly prefer Seasons 2-5, which were filmed before a live audience.

Unfortunately it's been reported that the packaging for Season 2 of The Odd Couple warns of music alterations. The company that's releasing this (Paramount) has received huge criticism from fans of Happy Days for the music cuts to the DVD sets of that show (also from Odd Couple producer Garry Marshall). This season includes the episode where Felix's opera group puts on Rigoletto, so fear the worst, and I know that I won't pre-order until I see some reviews after the release. I haven't seen this show in decades but I recall that Felix sang frequently in the show's ""live"" years, so if the pattern from Happy Days is followed, there's a good chance there will be some true damage to this brilliant show. I dread seeing what they'll do in later seasons: Will the episodes with Felix and the Sophisticados get hacked to bits? What about ""Happy and Peppy and Bursting with Love""? Or the Paul Williams episode (with Felix's Beatles quote, which will also be in jeopardy)? Or ""Laugh, Clown, Laugh""? The music is key to those episodes.

Five stars for The Odd Couple, but altered content definitely diminshes this set.",1179705600,45,1383,4.68724279835391

2840822,4,B000QUEQ6I,"In this shows 1971-72 Season, ""THE ODD COUPLE was filmed before a live studio audience,"" and a good sitcom was well on its way to becoming a great one as sloppy Oscar(Jack Klugman), and the fussy Felix(Tony Randall)are 2 divorced men trying to live together without driving each other crazy, was casting alchemy, and as time goes by, we appreciate the fundamental things that still apply: smart, character-based writing and indelible performances.

While there are no episodes that can be said to be truly classic, several are fan favorites, including ""Sleepwalker,"" which was included as one of the bonus episodes on the first-season set, ""Felix the Calypso Singer,"" in which Felix becomes the third wheel on Oscar's romantic getaway with his girlfriend, and ""You Saved My Life,"" in which Felix almost kills Oscar with kindness after Oscar rescues him.

This sophomore season fleshes out the mismatched friends' backstory with two fun flashback episodes. In ""Speak for Yourself,"" Oscar is forced to step in when Felix develops laryngitis on the night he was to propose to his future ex-wife Gloria, and in ""A Night to Dismember,"" a season benchmark, Oscar, Felix, and Oscar's ex-wife, Blanche, have different memories of the fateful night on which Oscar and Blanche split up.

Gone in this 1971-72 Season are the daffy Pigeon sisters. Introduced are Janis Hansen as Gloria, Joan Hotchkis as Oscar's girlfriend, Dr. Nancy Cunningham, and Brett Somers, a perfect match, as the dread Blanche.

A pre-Laverne and Shirley Penny Marshall makes her first appearance as Oscar's secretary, Myrna, and in the episode, ""Security Arms,"" that's John Fiedler, who portrayed Vinnie in the original 1968 Odd Couple movie whom is also the instantly recognizable voice of Piglet in the Disney Winnie the Pooh shorts.

In later seasons, THE ODD COUPLE  overindulged on stunt casting (remember the Billie Jean King-Bobby Riggs episode?) This 2nd Season offers comedian David Steinberg (""The Odd Couple Meets Their Host"") and opera singer Richard Fredricks (""Does Your Mother Know You're Out, Rigoletto?"").

THE ODD COUPLE was a series that got better with each season. This live incarnation of the show is the one that is most fondly remembered, making this 1971-1972 Season one that, unlike Felix, will never wear out its welcome, despite the fact that this show was never a smash in the Nielsen ratings throughout its whole 5-year run on ABC with only mediocre ratings.

Overall, this sitcom remains popular in reruns to this very day on ME TV and previously on TV Land.",1396569600,,2553,5.105515587529976

I am working my way up to having all seasons, but I have not found them sold as a set, so I but one season at a time.

After much prodding & deliberation, Oscar asks Felix to sing Calypso in the episode ""Felix, The Calypso Singer"". Felix has difficulty in bonding with his son in ""Win One For Felix"" - when Felix becomes coach of his son's football team. Felix has trouble in deciding between his daughter's surprise birthday party & Oscar's poker game in the episode ""Surprise, Surprise"", & Oscar approves of Blanche getting married to a particular suitor in ""Being Divorced Is Never Having To Say I Do"", until Felix tries to get Oscar & Blanche back together. In ""And Leave The Greyhound To Us"", Oscar purchases a racing dog. When Felix becomes emotionally attached to the animal, the race is all but over. Oscar saves Felix's life in the episode ""You Saved My Life"", but soon comes to regret it. With a wave of crime in the building, Felix organizes a neighborhood watch group in ""Security Arms"", only to find Felix's 'round-the-clock schedule is driving Oscar & all the tenants nuts!

With a live audience everything is so exaggerated, and the interplay between the audience and the actors is not always beneficial to the shows. Audiences egg actors on and cause them to overact or overreact, makes them self-conscience and too eager to please or get laughs. Also, the show gets stuck on location and rarely moves, rarely goes outdoors, nothing.

2840864,4,B000QUEQ6I,"A one camera setup was used in the first season of The Odd Couple, and the look of the episodes shot inside the New York apartment set was tight, almost claustrophobic at times.  Stars Tony Randall and Jack Klugman felt the setup cramped their style and retarded their creativity.  For the second season, the program was filmed on an entirely new set, before a live audience, using three cameras.  As a result, The Odd Couple was a wide open look and feel, with smooth transitional shots now possible.  It is a huge improvement, and the two stars display new energy in their performances, taking their comedy to a higher and more physical level.  In one episode, Oscar is showing Felix how to play football, and a nimble Randall leapfrogs over Klugman while he is down in a football stance.  Another time Felix does a headstand, then kips up on a desk, finishing with flurry of pushups in an impressive display of physical fitness.  Oscar isn't as physically active, but when properly motivated, you can find him running around the living room exercising a greyhound.

While much activity is still centered around apartment life, the boys get out and about town too.  The circle of characters really opens up to more than just the boys over for a poker game.  With Felix's ex-wife Gloria (Janice Hansen), and Oscar's ex-wife Blanche (Brett Sommers), both being featured prominently in various episodes.  Dr. Nancy Cunningham (Joan Hotchkis) is Oscar's steady girlfriend, and Al Molinaro is back as Murray the cop.  For this season, Pamlyn Ferdin is Felix's daughter Edna, and Penny Marshall makes her first appearance as Oscar's Secretary Myrna.

Notable guest stars include Pat Morita, John Fiedler, Joan Van Ark, Vito Scotti, and Hal Smith.  The eclectic parade of celebrity guest stars that would become an Odd Couple trademark begins with the likes of opera singer Richard Fredericks, and comedian David Steinberg.

Highlights include `The Fat Farm', where the guys head to a retreat to lose weight, `Security Arms', where they move into a high-security building, and `Partner's Investment' which features Felix and Oscar toiling in a Japanese restaurant.

This is a great season, rich with diversity and expansive character development.  There is a lot going on.  The plots have moved beyond early clichs, like Felix's bad back going out, and Oscar's frequent threats to kick Felix out on the street. From here, the stage is set for even better things to come.  The only downside is that unlike the Season One set, which had a bonus disc and various commentary tracks, Season Two has absolutely no extras.",1213747200,4,2610,4.958620689655173

2840871,2,B000QUEQ6I,"Actually, let me change that to: this show sucks after Year One. Yes, I know that the OC community -- a group more rabid and protective than a pitbull on crack -- has always believed the opposite. I've been watching ""The Odd Couple"" for a couple decades now, always looking forward to it on WPIX-NY. And I have always preferred the opening season, but never as strongly as after watching the beautifully reproduced episodes on the Year One release, and then Year Two. (With Year Three just around the corner.)

The reasons have nothing to do with the magnificent Tony Randall or Jack Klugman(both of whom get better with every viewing). And certainly not the writing. For me, the reasons are: 1) the 3-camera set-up instituted beginning with Year Two, as opposed to Year One's ""movie"" style; 2) the always obnoxious influence of Garry Marshall, who really did take complete creative control of OC starting with Year Two.

I understand the advantages of 3-cameras and a live audience: 1) it's much cheaper than the dozens of set-ups required by the movie approach; 2) it's cheap; and 3) it's cheap. Yes, it's also much easier to rehearse, probably more fun for the actors, and it's cheap. But even on those terms, this show(and many, many others) lose something: the back-and-forth ""energy"" between the TV comedy actors and the audience often leads to major campiness, self-referential nonsense, and loss of timing(while waiting for the yahoos to stop cheering or whatever). Obviously, the heart of comedy is timing. But not just the actors' timing. One classic example would be ""The Jury Story"": both the hotel room scenes and the jury room scenes(all of them hysterical) would be impossible to repeat in 3-camera set-up because the ""punchlines"" almost all depend on cutting and camera placement: Felix moving the ashtray, Oscar holding up the cut-up newspaper, Oscar dumping ketchup on his steak, etc. The beautiful timing of all that -- and so much of Year One -- is lost with the stage-bound 3-cameras. And speaking of stage-bound: what the heck happened to New York City? Another one of the great things about Year One is that the camera became part of New York, showed us Lindsey-Era New York. Season One very much feels like New York(even 'though it was filmed mostly in LA). The rest of the series feels as canned and locationless as almost all sitcoms do.

Especially if they are under the control of Garry Marshall. Let's face it: the campiness, the obviousness, the playing to the immediate audience's most obvious expectations of the show, the ""characters,"" and the actors are not just part of the stupidity of ""Happy Days,"" ""Joanie Loves Chacchi"" and ""Laverne and Shirley"". It's here too, folks. Very much so. And one other Marshallization of this series really leaves me cold: the endless celebrity appearances. And what celebrities!: Monty Hall, Richard Dawson, Bobby Riggs, JAYE P. MORGAN! (Couldn't they get John Davidson or Bobby Sherman?) How stupid.

Well, at least we have the magnificent Year One.",1199836800,13,3018,4.946745562130178

2840874,5,B000QUEQ6I,"I grew up watching reruns of the Odd Couple on WPIX in New York in the late 70s.  Even as an early teenager I loved the show and appreciated the quality of the acting and the writing.

I also have to disagree with most of the other reviewers here who seem to like Season 1 and 2 equally well.  In my opinion, Season 2 is where The Odd Couple really hit its stride.  The writing, laugh track, old-fashioned set and ""filmed"" quality of the first season just didn't allow Jack Klugman and Tony Randall to shine the way they do in the later seasons.

In addition to the excellent writing and perfect chemistry between the two leads, I have to single out Tony Randall as the single element that propels The Odd Couple from notable sitcom to enduring classic.  Tony Randall was a gifted actor and comic to be sure, but he brought such unparalleled nuance and idiosyncratic perfection to the role of Felix Unger.  I can't think of another character that audiences love and are annoyed by in equal measure (maybe Archie Bunker?).

I remember reading an interview with Tony Randall - or was it during an appearance on Letterman? - wherein he expressed his complete frustration with fans who teased him about being so anal.  I understand that all fans tend to blur reality and fantasy but in Tony Randall's case I think it was a bit understandable.  It is so obvious that he brought so much of himself to the character that it was only natural for fans to lose sight of where fantasy ended and reality began.

I cried when I read that Tony Randall died.  I hardly knew him from anything other than the Odd Couple - which would have probably broken his heart.  He brought such exuberance and life to the role that it was inconceivable that he would die - ever.  I loved him for that role and for ensuring that the Odd Couple never gets old no matter how many times I watch it, even 30 years later.",1197849600,5,1886,4.413294797687861
2840875,3,B000QUEQ6I,"The notice ""Some episodes may be edited from their original network versions.

Here's hoping that CBS/Paramount get's a clue and provides some extras for the 3rd season release.",1194825600,4,560,5.032258064516129
2840876,5,B000QUEQ6I,"Based on the Broadway play by Neil Simon, this tells the story of two
mismatched friends, Felix Unger and Oscar Madison. Felix is a neat,
tidy, and healthy nut, a photographer at a portrait studio, and a
connoisseur of classical music. Because of this, his wife divorced
Felix and threw him out of his apartment for good. Desperately in the
need of a place to live, he moves in with his longtime childhood
friend, Oscar Madison, a sports journalist for the New York Herald.
What he realizes is that Oscar is the exact opposite of him: sloppy,
messy, and doesn't eat the right foods. Felix's cleaning, hygienic
tips, and healthiness annoys Oscar while Oscar's crazy world of living
like a pig upsets Felix. But in the process they'll learn that
friendship is more important than living in different worlds.

Prior to Randall's death, he and Klugman were the best of friends
which translated onto the screen in that the chemistry they had was
unsurpassed.

Not realized is that the show during its 5 year run was not a ratings
juggernaut.  At its peak it was only in the top 50 even though the
list of 70's celebrities that made appearances was impressive....

However, over the past 30 years while in syndication, The Odd Couple
has taken on a fan base and a popularity it never enjoyed in first run
episodes.

If not for the ABC executives being fans of the quality of the show,
it would have never made it past a season or two.

For television historians, the quality and writing rank in with
Seinfeld, Cheers, All in the Family, etc.

The Odd Couple will always go down in the annals of televison as one
of the best.

The electricity they exude transfers so easily to the audience. I saw these two fine actors in Tony's acting company in New York in The Sunshine Boys, which was done after Mr. Klugman's unfortunate cancer operation. These two men still had the magic they showed in the Odd Couple. I can't wait, and I really mean it, until the subsequent seasons come out on DVD.

On the DVD except for a few notes at the beginning of the episode it has been replaced by a generic instrumental song. When Felix has Oscar propose for him he puts on a record of ""Their Song"" but once again the generic instrumental is heard. This is really disturbing because this song was central to the episode and it was changed on the DVD. So far all the episodes I have watched have been unedited but there has been music replaced.

The DVD of the second season of ""The Odd Couple,"" really shows why this show will go down as one of television's finest situation comedies.
As anyone who is a fan of the ""The Odd Couple"" knows, season two was dramatically different from season one in that it was filmed with a completely different set and before a live audience. While I like season one because it is closer to the 1968 ""Odd Couple"" movie starring Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon, in season two Randall's and Klugman's true talents really rise to the surface. The timing between the two is impeccable, almost as good as long-time comedy team of Abbott & Costello, and the writing is execellent, with classics like ""Natural Childbirth"" ""Felix's Wife's Boyfriend"" ""A Grave for Felix"" ""The Fat Farm""
and ""Security Arms.""
The video transfer is beautiful, and the episodes are presented in complete fashion, so fans of the show will notice how much was deleted from the show when it was presented on TV Land or WPIX Channel 11 in New York.

The uncut episodes also yield footage I've never seen. The film transfer is absolutely gorgeous- deep blacks, clean whites, good shadow detail, rich colors, and very fine film grain.
