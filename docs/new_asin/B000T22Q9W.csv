2892319,1,B000T22Q9W,"I bought the 30th Anniversary edition of the original series. I was extremely disappointed with the editing. Several crucial scenes were cut. I know because I remember watching them on TV in 1977. Why would they cut out Kizzy's childhood, or the fact that Kunta Kinte counted out his age with rocks, or when Chicken George comes back to the Moore plantation to find Tom Moore dying? Other scenes were cut, as well. Too many to list. Why? There is no logical reason.

Now I'm afraid to buy any other version. There is no Director's cut, no words on any package that express ""unedited version."" I'd love to buy the Complete Collection if I were guaranteed that it was indeed COMPLETE.",1410307200,4,682,4.636363636363637

2892352,5,B000T22Q9W,this was one of my very first purchase from Amazon and what I'm not understanding is why they're just now asking me to write a review cuz I purchase this item to half years ago I will tell you that it is far as I can remember everything went smoothly I bought it from a daughter for Christmas because she loves roots as far as I know everything was okay but when she opened it I noticed some of the disk or loosely placed in there so she's never said anything so I'm going to take it is that two years later that they're good and we did buy for prime sole also I can say is if it happens play the desk at the loose or scratch send back but its a good movie,1386460800,,656,3.8666666666666667

2892355,1,B000T22Q9W,"First let me say that this rating is NOT for the movie/mini-series itself, rather it is a commentary on the seller.  I haven't seen the mini-series since I was a young child and yet it stuck with me after all these years so much so that I wanted to share it with my teenaged son.  In my opinion this series should be required viewing for ALL high school students.  Imagine my grave disappointment and unabashed anger when, having carved out time in my and my son's very busy schedules to sit down and watch this important film together, I put in the first disc only to find that it and the rest of the discs are unwatchable here in the US. It has the wrong region code so no player here in the United States can play the content on the disc. I spent $40 on absolutely nothing!!!  Beware anyone contemplating buying from this seller, there was nothing in the description of the movie boxed set that said that it had the wrong region code, it's nowhere to be found on the box or on the discs themselves either.  I haven't been able to figure out how to get my money back yet but I hope to be able to at some point. ~t*)",1381968000,15,1117,4.200934579439252

I liked the way RW says you'd be better off buying the series separately in order to prevent overcrowding in the cases which do damage the goods at times.

But the ones I feel most sorry for & I truly mean that nicely, are all of you that paid so much money for either individual parts or multi-packs. I just got on to Amazon 'cause I saw something that both shocked & made me laugh at how Amazon & God only knows who else, rip people off so horribly & there's really nothing we the people can do about it. I've been there, I know. As for Roots: The Complete Collection which Amazon is offering for both $140 & $150 for the collection that comes with 10 discs total, that's when I'd say ""Don't Buy It"".  Why?  Both my friend & I just happened to get lucky when we went to a Newbury Comics not too long ago, & my friends' the one who actually found them, when he came upon the movie ""Roots: The Complete Collection""  It wasn't so much the fact he'd found the movie collection. It was how much they wanted for it.

Needless to say, we each bought a copy (they only had 2 copies at the time) & all we paid was TEN DOLLARS total. NO lie. There's no way on earth, here on Amazon or anywhere else, would I pay $140 or $150 or nore, for the exact same collection we bought. I'm not rich. And even if I were, I still wouldn't pay that price.

2892442,5,B000T22Q9W,"ALEX HALEY - ROOTS - ROOTS THE NEXT GENERATIONS

This TV mini-series has become a classic in thirty years and it deserves to be. Yet the quality of the filming and editing has aged and the film is not served by the fact it was done for television that tends to show too many close-ups and to avoid vast rapid movements and wide landscapes. But it has become a classic by its theme.

The first mini series deals with the fate of black people from when they were captured in Africa to their liberation after the Civil War. The vision of Africa in the 18th century is slightly improved on what it was. Some rituals are nicely evoked but not shown, circumcision for example, and nothing is said about excision for the girls. The capturing of Bantu blacks in western Africa and their enslaving had been going on for centuries. The new thing is that the captured Bantu blacks were no longer sold as slaves to the northern Moslem tribes or even Moslem Maghreb people, but to the whites for only one reason: the whites paid better and more. It seems to be done in order to avoid any restrictive rating.

It is the same with the whole period about slavery. The film concentrates on odious but altogether rather limited facts: one whipping, a couple of children sold, very few rapes by the whites who produced mulattos that could be sold for a profit. The hardships of field work are also curbed. The living conditions and quarters are quite luxurious when we know what it really was. Even the Civil War is shown with a lot of reserve. They may say the number of dead but they don't show the battles, the medical care of the wounded, the savagery of the war and the innumerable amputees and victims.

Altogether the first part is rather tamed. It enhances the main theme of this first part: one has to retain the memory of one's origins, roots, past, even if only a name, a few words, a few episodes. Those recollections passed from one generation to the next will feed the sense of belonging, the hope that brings the future, the light that may one day illuminate the dull and dark present. And the joy of the liberation is important, but the first part ends on a closure too: the whites are still there and the blacks have to live with them and compromises are not always easy to find and not always to the real benefit of the blacks.

Slavery is replaced by sharecropping but the black sharecroppers start with the debts that are attributed to them to pay for what they need to work and they should get free since they worked for nothing for decades. That's how it works with the whites in the South, and yet the family we are speaking of managed to finagle a plan to get the mules free and to move out without paying for the debts of slavery from North Carolina to Tennessee where one freed member who got the chance to make some wealth in England had bought some land. That's the real freedom this family achieves after the Civil war: to possess the land they till and thus the harvest they grow.

The second part is telling the history of the USA after the Civil War as much at least as the history of this family. So we see the reconstruction period, and the emergence of the Ku Klux Klan, the imposition of segregation, WWI, the New Deal and WWII, and then the post war period. In this second series that ends with the author Haley as the main character, I am amazed that it is more contemplative of the injustice coming up than really fighting against it.

The only positive point is education. But if there is some kind of resistance it is always one person and not the community. In the 1930s, the subsidies voted by Congress to small farmers to help them survive the crisis and get even, blacks included, are systematically, for the blacks at least, hijacked by the land-owners and if one black farmer manages to get his check it is the private initiative of one man and the black farmer ends up in prison, wounded and to stay in prison for a while and his mules have been repossessed by the landowner and he has been totally pauperized and expelled from the county if not the state.

If after WWII there is some improvement the discourse is concentrating on the personal efforts of Alex Haley, his own personal way to wealth and grace. The closest we get to the struggle of the black community for the end of discrimination and more justice is a couple of scenes with Malcolm X and his assassination. But where are Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks and the collective massive battles waged by the blacks, including against the Vietnam War? Even Kennedy is some kind of epiphenomenon that does not count for much, and his assassination is not even evoked. That has to lead to a real ego trip at the end and Alex Haley going back to Gambia and meeting with the griot of the village of his ancestors and hearing from his mouth the story that had been told from generation to generation in his family and meeting one last descendant who still has the name Kinte like the ancient ancestor Kunta Kinte.

And Alex Haley himself adds a verbose conclusion about the importance of knowing one's ancestors. What pride am I supposed to get from the fact that my ancestors were the serfs of a small nobleman? That kind of nostalgia may make us unable to embrace the future today.

2892482,5,B000T22Q9W,"I was just a teenager when Roots first aired on TV as a mini-series. I remember having to look away, sometimes in tears, during some of the more graphic scenes of the movie. Its an extremely riveting, often painful, story that gives us an In-Your-Face look at how this nation was built; on the blood, sweat,and tears, of a people who were stolen from their homes, and forced into a life where they were treated worse than animals! Their families were ripped apart; fathers and sons, especially the stronger, more masculine ones, were literally dragged out of the arms of their loved ones, quite often never to see each other again! Roots, and Roots, the next generation, is a true, painful story that ALL Americans should see! Growing up, I encouuntered only a minute fraction of the  prejudice, and humiliation these people suffered throughout their entire lives It was painful. but pales in comparison what these people endured in their lives. Alex Haley, the author of the Roots saga was a genius with words. This is his family's heritage, and he chose to share it through his books. I've read the books, and these movies stay true to the stories! They draw you so deep into the story, that it makes you want to reseach your own ancestry, and makes you want to right all the wrongs that this family endured! There are many hours of story, and its best to watch the way it aired on TV, like a mini series; that is, if you can bring yourself to turn it off! These movies should be watched together with your family, so that, maybe, our children will get a good look at the sacrifices made for the freedom we all take for granted! This is not just a series of true events from our past. Its also an investment; as long as we have a record of the truth, it will ensure that we never forget!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roots-The-Complete-Collection-Roots-Roots-The-Next-Generations/dp/B000T22Q9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roots - The Complete Collection (Roots / Roots - The Next Generations)</a>",1268092800,2,2037,4.973607038123167

2892485,4,B000T22Q9W,"First let me clarify that material itself is 5-star. I have no issues with the movies. However I would rate the packaging 2 stars. While visually nice at first glace, the packaging is not practical to the storage or safety of the disks. The box set is WAY oversized (I would guess around 7""x12"") which means it cannot be readily stored on a shelf with your other DVDs. This made no sense to me because there were only about 10 disks. They could easily have condensed the packaging. Another fault is that they only put a single episode per side of each disk. This seemed a further waste of space. They could have cut down on the number of disks simply by putting more episodes per disk as is done with any other TV series box set sold today. Lastly, and maybe worst of all, the disks are stored by pushing them into stiff cardboard sleeves. The sleeves are tight enough to scratch the disks over time but loose enough to allow them to slip out during shipping and possibly when you are just moving the set about on your shelf. The only reason I wrote this review is to inform potential buyers and maybe warn them against supporting these kind of marketing & packaging techniques. Surely they could have come up with a smaller, slimmer, format that held the disks firmly and safely and was just as beautiful rather than delivering it in such an unwieldy, clunky and ill thought out form.",1267056000,20,1385,4.478260869565218

2892534,5,B000T22Q9W,"I'm at that age where I can say I saw this when it was originally broadcast. It had such an impact at that time. It was amazing to listen to people discussing the characters in it.

I bought this for my wife (at her request for you out there that are snickering that a guy might buy something for his wife that he would like too)!!! Anyway, we sat down and watched it all over again. We would stay up late just wanting to watch one more episode (insert droopy eyes here).

It's a wonderful portrayal of a family's history through the years of being a free person in their native land to being taken prisoner and serving as slaves for so many years. It's certainly something we all need to be reminded of now and then......if we don't pay attention to history, it's destined to repeat itself.

I would recommend it highly to anyone.

Double sided dvds - great way to cheap out on manufacturing guys!  Next time though, don't put them in cardboard sleeves, that when closed, cause the (double sided, remember) dvds to rub up against one another.  Even if the disks manage to stay in place (HA!) they'll rub against each other and scratch that way.

Looking closely at the disks themselves, they don't look very well made to begin with.  The ""silver"" at the edges of the disks is very ragged, and the edges of the disks themselves aren't smooth.

2892540,2,B000T22Q9W,"This is a great story.  I have watched it many times.  It is great. I was glad to get all of these disks at one time.  I was elated to get Roots and Roots 2 at the same time.  We can't forget about what happened during those perilous times in our history. (And no, I am not related to the author nor have any connection with him.  But if he ever wanted to give me his autograph, I would never turn it down.).

Like other reviews, my score is not because of the story.  I am not giving it a very high review because of the packaging.  I couldn't believe when I opened the box, there were 7 DVDs just rubbing against each other and the DVDs almost looked used because of it.  I could deal with about anything but that.  The only, so called, protection to the discs, is the cardboard sleeves that don't hold the discs during transport.

The other problem I had is that I couldn't get the captions to stay off on the original series.  That was quite annoying.",1193616000,71,955,4.158469945355192
2892541,1,B000T22Q9W,"""Roots - The Complete Collection"" (10 disc DVD set) contains the mini-series ""Roots"" from 1977 (""30th Anniversary Edition"" version on three 2-sided discs), the mini-series ""Roots: The Next Generations"" from 1979 (on four discs, three of which are 2-sided), the television movie ""Roots: The Gift"" (on a single-sided disc), and ""Roots: The Legacy"", a collection of old and new archival material/documentaries spread across two single-sided discs. The content is excellent, and there are plenty of other reviews on this site which go into depth regarding the material.

However, my one star rating for this ""item"" is based primarily on two things. First, this item constitutes a shameful forced double-dip manipulation on the part of the DVD producer with respect to customers who previously purchased either the ""Roots"" 25th Anniversary DVD set released January 2002, or the ""Roots"" 30th Anniversary DVD set released May 2007 (five months before this ""Complete Collection""), and who now must in effect repurchase ""Roots"" for roughly $40 in order to purchase ""Roots: The Gift"" on DVD, which is in release only as part of this set, which doesn't include any DVD extras, and which easily could have been released as a stand-alone item for $10-$15. Second, the packaging is horrendous. Instead of packaging this set in a manner which would make shelf storage convenient and which would protect the discs from damage (think of the typical DVD ""collection"" box set - e.g. ""The Matrix Collection"", or any TV series season set), the collection comes in a huge ""cigar box""-style case, with the DVDs wedged into tight ""slots"" in one of three long, flat cardboard folders in the box, much as if the DVDs were coins in a coin collection folder. Getting the DVDs in and out of these slots without scuffing them is difficult at best. Further, the set I received had four discs dislodged prior to opening, and these dislodged discs were scratched on both sides as badly as old rental store discs, while almost all of the other discs which were not dislodged from their slots had lesser degrees of scratch damage on one or both sides. Disc 1, Side 2 froze at the 41:30 mark, likely due to scratch damage.

The bottom line is, unless you absolutely must own ""Roots: The Gift"", this collection should be avoided like the plague. It is largely a waste of money and space. Purchase ""Roots"" and ""Roots: The Next Generations"" separately instead. Most of the archival material from ""Roots: The Legacy"" is included on the 30th Anniversary Edition of ""Roots"".

Edit:  One thing I forgot to add way back when I originally reviewed this set is that ""Roots: The Gift"" for this set has been cropped to fill a 16:9 (1.78:1) television screen.  Since ""Roots: The Gift"" originally aired on TV in 1988, this was years before anything on U.S. television aired in anything other than the standard 4:3 (1.33:1) screen aspect ratio.  Widescreen televisions are perfectly capable of showing those old TV shows and old movies in the 4:3 format.  ""Roots"" (1977) and ""Roots: The Next Generations"" (1979) are both on DVD in their original 4:3 screen aspect ratios.  Maybe the DVD producers wanted to make ""Roots: The Gift"" look more like ""a movie"".  If so, this was misguided.  ""Roots: The Gift"" was made for television and shot for television.  For the most part, I didn't notice any glaring framing issues on the DVD with the cropping from the top and bottom of the original image.  However, that's usually not the case with this practice.  And the viewer is not seeing the complete image as it was originally intended to be seen.  It's also completely unnecessary.",1192492800,303,3623,4.918032786885246
