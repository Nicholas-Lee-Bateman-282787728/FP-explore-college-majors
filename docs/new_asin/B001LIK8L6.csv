3683672,5,B001LIK8L6,"NOTE:  I received a free preview copy of this DVD from the web site Metapsychology Online; you can read a more complete version of my review on that site.

As a regular home exerciser in my early 40s--about the same age as Dara Torres, who is featured on this DVD--I have made more and more of an effort to include different types of stretching as part of my fitness routine, which is why this DVD set appealed to me.  Resistance Stretching was developed by Anne Tierney and Steve Sierra, co-founders of Innovative Body Solutions.  In the introductory chapters of the first disc, Anne and Steve explain that Resistance Stretching is the process of resisting during the stretch.  In other words, it involves taking the muscle from the shortest position to the longest position while contracting the muscle at the same time, which is also referred to as the ""e-centric"" phase of strength training.

The first disc includes an almost one-hour tutorial in which Anne and Steve thoroughly explain all seventeen self-stretches in their program.  Chapters 3, 5, and 6 each serve to assist with problem solving and modifications, either through learning how to work agonist/antagonist muscles, incorporating modifications for tight hamstrings, or building up strength to improve flexibility.

The Main Menu for Disc 1 is as follows; all times (in parentheses) are approximate:

Play All
Chapter 1, Introduction to Resistance Stretching (3m; with Dara Torres)
Chapter 2, Basic Principles: Resistance (6m)
Chapter 3, Basic Principles: Balancing Muscle Groups (8.5m)
Chapter 4, Master 17 Self-Stretches (55.5m; Anne & Steve modeling/instructing alternately)
Chapter 5, Problem-Solving for Tight Hamstrings (2.5m)
Chapter 6, Correlation Between Strength and Stretching (3m)

Here is the complete list of the 17 self-stretches which appear in Chapter 4 as well as on Disc 2:

Lower Body
1.  Medial Hamstring
2.  Central Hamstring
3.  Outer (lateral) Hamstring
4.  Lateral Quadriceps (includes IT band & glutes)
5.  Inner Thigh
6.  Outer Thigh (glutes)
7.  Groin (seated)
8.  Hip Flexors (lunge)
9.  Calves

Upper Body
1.  Chest, Shoulders, & Biceps (push-ups with emphasis on lowering)
2.  Shoulders & Traps
3.  Shoulders & Back
4.  Shoulders, Back, & Neck (scaption)
5.  Triceps, Lats, & Obliques
6.  Chest, Biceps, & Forearms
7.  Traps, Neck, & Side of Shoulder
8.  Chest, Shoulder, & Biceps

Disc 2 offers a complete resistance stretching workout with Dara Torres.  This 20-minute workout includes all seventeen of the self-stretches introduced on Disc 1, but the entire routine is performed without pausing for instruction.  Dara models the exercises alone while Anne and Steve again take turns cuing via voiceover.  Prior to the start of the workout, Dara provides a very brief introduction, suggesting props to have nearby (a mat and a small pillow or foam block to support the head).  Compared to the tutorial, the pace of this workout is quite rapid.  Although it felt a bit too fast the first time through, I have found the short length convenient for working in this routine on a weekly basis, and I haven't gone back to Disc 1 since my initial viewing.

I actually already incorporate some types of resistance stretching through other workout DVDs that I own (for example, the Classical Stretch series by Miranda Esmonde-White).  However, Anne and Steve definitely present a unique approach that is apt to be beneficial, and in Dara Torres, they have an appealing, likable spokesperson.  Although this method is appropriate for virtually all levels, I do think that it is likely to appeal most to those who are already active and/or who have an athletic background.  Nevertheless, I would recommend this DVD set for anyone who is interested in gently working towards increasing their flexibility as well as improving their overall health and fitness levels.",1279497600,69,3855,5.156451612903226
3683673,3,B001LIK8L6,"the info in this dvd is good and it does work. you don't have to be a sports person to bennifit from this type of work.
apply this to any activity and you will feel good doing whatever you do. sports or not.

the process is so simple it's the doing of it that works.",1277510400,9,266,3.8363636363636364
3683674,5,B001LIK8L6,"Resistance Stretching with Dara Torres 2-Disc Set is superb.  You get 17 exercises to stretch & strengthen your body.  One disc gives an overall in-depth tutorial with basic resistance stretching principles & demonstrates & explains each exercise.  The second disc is Dara doing the complete workout.  Additional problem solving is included & very helpful.  I first bought Bob Cooley The Genius of Flexibility Video 1.0.  Although it is good, this Resistance Stretching with Dara Torres & her 2 trainers, Anne Tierney & Steve Sierra is hands down by far better all around.  Anne Tierney & Steve Sierra, trained with Cooley.  This Resistance Stretching With Dara Torres 2-Disc DVD set  is top quality & extremely well done with excellent pictures to show the area that each stretch addresses.  I use it 3 times a week for my resistance stretching workout.  Highly recommended.",1272240000,99,875,5.134751773049645
3683680,5,B001LIK8L6,"Very well explained and demonstrated. The workout dvd is awesome. Quick and effective. Dara is a great model for this, you can tell she really knows her stuff. Love it!",1396483200,3,168,4.633333333333334
3683681,4,B001LIK8L6,"I'm an exercise physiologist so I know something about this stuff.  This is solid science.  It does require effort and concentration.  You can cheat yourself if you just go through the motions.  But the risk of injury is minimal and the combination of strength and flexibility is valuable in every sport at every age.  Resistance stretching is not a total fitness program but it can be a valuable portion of one.

I agree that the first disc is painfully slow and probably really boring for the non-scientist who just wants to get down to it.
There's lots of good information in there but you don't really have to spend a lot of time on disc one. Listen to enough to get the basic principle.  The 20 minute workout on disc two gives you the basics of the workout with Dana Torres walking you though it.  If you find yourself confused by any of the exercises, go back to disc one for extreme detail.

I used this product to teach dry land training to my son's hockey team.  I modified the workout for the goalies to help them with their unique flexibility needs.  I also use resistance stretching to increase flexibility in my middle aged, many time injured body.  These techniques work better than anything else I have tried for flexibility.",1380844800,21,1241,4.590909090909091
3683682,4,B001LIK8L6,good stretching just harder for me.  Im short and agile just not flexible enough.  I like the video a lot.,1366588800,3,106,4.25
3683683,5,B001LIK8L6,"I learn better visually than reading.  I have Dara Torres book, read it, and tried the exercises.  This DVD allowed me to restart correctly and quickly.  Resistance stretching works, and this DVD works.",1341964800,3,202,5.0606060606060606
3683684,5,B001LIK8L6,"I love Dara Torres and she's an inspiration!  While she actual had trainers to provide resistance stretching, this is still an effective technique to do at home.  The video quality is very poor - don't be surprised - but this workout gets the job done.  If you want more details on Meridian Stretching, you can purchase the book by Bob Cooley. His first video was not very good, don't know about the second one.",1331856000,7,411,4.527027027027027
3683685,1,B001LIK8L6,"This video gives a decent overview of what resistance stretching is but is unusable as an exercise guide. The ""workout routine"" does not give enough instruction nor does it give enough time to perform the exercises. It also doesn't have you switch to work the other side of your body so it is pretty worthless as an exercise tool.",1329436800,10,330,4.610169491525424
3683686,5,B001LIK8L6,"Hmmm, some of the naysayers spoke too soon. Dara shows up in the second DVD because the other two TALENTED trainers walk you through the workout giving absolutely letter perfect instructions. Keeping multiple instructions in mind (""relax the neck, make sure you engage the glutes, you should feel the burn starting in your arms now too"") they are covering all the bases and making sure you get the intended stretching done. Believe me, it's easy to cheat in exercise and many do.

This technique has been essential in giving me back my flexibility I lost through surgery, or long time lay up, or coming off of long-term (cortico-)steroid therapy etc. Stretching for 45 minutes at a time on the ferry over to Orcas for a bike ride, I would be locked up five minutes later. I couldn't get out of bed without help (I was 49 at the time and in good shape) and the pain was incredible and it didn't go away. Normal stretching just didn't work. It wasn't going after the deep injured muscles locked in tetany. Resistance stretching recruits the two sets of muscles necessary to stretch (extending and contracting muscles) and it has been KEY to getting healing done.

Man, I found out I had huge problems of deep injury (due to paralysis induced by surgery? I don't know. Coming off the steroids? Could be) that was not getting relief from practicing yoga, weights, aerobics, percoset, IBU, 12-hours of sleep a day, chiropractic, blah blah. The leg muscles began to contract and started turning my legs in different directions. The top in one direction, the bottom in another, my knees dying in the middle. This went on for two years until I found this method.

Resistance stretching, while very difficult for me initially (deep glute areas), has been a life saver. I have been able to release some of these deep charlie horses I didn't even know I had  I knew something was wrong but I was still really flexible in other stretches) until I started doing their exercises. I'm sure that people could avoid hip and knew replacements if they worked on the muscles that are pulling their bones out of alignment.

I highly recommend this DVD.",1319414400,42,2131,4.717741935483871
3683687,1,B001LIK8L6,"This is horrible!  There are two DVDs in this set and I didn't even make it to the second one yet. The first one does not even have Dara in it, but two weird looking trainers:  a chick that looks like a fullback and a skinny dude with platinum blond hair.  They do not even do a stretch workout! They just talk about the moves and then do one lame example--there is no stretching workout or sequence on the first DVD!  So booooring!!!!!!!!! They are both horrible on camera--no wonder they needed Dara to endorse it!  Could not even watch past Chapter 3, because I was so disgusted.",1296432000,9,582,4.351851851851852
3683688,5,B001LIK8L6,Brought the resistance stretching book and was interested but kind of confused as to how to properly execute the exercises in question. When I purchased thiis video it answered all of my questions.  Thedvd is a 2 set that takes you through all of the exercises. This is highly recommended.,1282867200,27,289,4.78
3683689,2,B001LIK8L6,"These stretches -- in one of them you lie on your back and grab your foot and push with your leg and resist with your arm -- just seemed strange to me. I tried one, and it hurt my back. I watched parts of the video and never really believed in it. Unfortunately, I didn't see any kind of notice about Amazon's return policy. But you only get a small refund and they don't pay for your shipping if there is nothing technically wrong with a DVD and you have opened it. So I spent $18 for the video and had to spend $9 to send it back, which totals $27. I complained and they gave me a refund of $13 or so, but the whole thing was unpleasant, time consuming and expensive. Sorry. I hate to bad-mouth anything to do with Dara Torres, but this didn't work out very well for me.",1280707200,6,772,4.052287581699346

8318107,5,B001LIK8L6,I love that DVD. I have a Bob Cooley's book and i was looking for  good DVD to make it easy to implement the resistant stretching practice  in my daily routine.,1440201600,,160,4.129032258064516
8318108,5,B001LIK8L6,"I have been using the bonus DVD three times a week now for about 6 weeks.  The results have been very noticeable.  I have lower back issues and was hoping for some core strengthening and some back loosening by using this tape.  It is very important to take the time to watch the first tape before moving on to the bonus tape.  I love the bonus tape because you get a great all over body stretch in just 20 minutes, but to use proper form, it is important to watch the longer version to learn how to do each exercise properly.  I brought a mat to the office and I do the tape in front of my desk before everyone else gets to work.  All you need is a mat, a neck pillow and your body.  I see great results in flexibility and my lower back problem has improved immensely. So happy to have added this little gem to my workout routines.",1433116800,4,831,4.092592592592593
8318109,5,B001LIK8L6,Great exercises for someone who really needs help with flexibility.  I've got some rotator cuff issues in my shoulder which have caused me to lose a lot of strength.  These stretches help keep me limber and help restore some of the lost strength as well.  DVD 1 is by Dana's partners who explain in detail each of the stretches.  DVD 2 is the workout with Dana.  The workout is only 20 minutes by itself so it's great for someone who doesn't have a lot of time to spend on a workout.,1420416000,2,483,4.263736263736264
8318110,1,B001LIK8L6,"Hated it! There was a couple nice stretches shown that I had already seen on her apperences other than that it's just
really gimicy. Nothing new.",1414108800,3,145,4.615384615384615
8318111,5,B001LIK8L6,Found the stretches to be a workout in itself,1405555200,2,45,4.111111111111111
8318112,5,B001LIK8L6,"I had read the non-weird parts of Bob Cooley's book about resistance stretching and was looking for a video to demonstrate the stretches as  you can only get so much from a book.  I've been doing P90X for several years and am trying to step up the stretching more than you get from that program.  So far this seems to be working quite well.

As other reviewers have said, Disc One is kind of dry.  The trainers obviously know what they are doing, but have limited personality; I guess I'm more used to Tony Horton.  Disc Two is better and is a good workout, although it could use a little more personality as well.

Overall, the workout on disc two gets to the point and stretches / strengthens a lot of the muscle groups.",1401494400,4,722,4.343283582089552
