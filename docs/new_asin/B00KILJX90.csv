8659256,4,B00KILJX90,"Sofie Grbl stars in this Danish and Swedish film, where she plays a priest, Helen, at a small rural parish. One day she gets approached by a psychologist who is carrying out experimental treatment research at a nearby maximum security hospital for the criminally insane. This is Lizbeth Wendt and she wants Helen to come and speak to a young man who has tried to top himself, after God - speaking through a cat, had told him to kill himself.

Well slightly bored by her mundane parish work and slightly intrigued by this young man, she agrees and heads off to be a Good Samaritan. This man is there because he killed an old couple for seemingly no reason. Lizbeth is using exposure to pets to help regulate the inmates behaviour patterns and is working to a university. As Helen gets closer to the man - she uncovers his past and the clues to why he has become what he is and maybe the key to saving his life.

This is quite a small film in some ways, it is filmed in the cells for a lot of the time and has a relatively small cast. Grbl, as ever is excellent, but so is everybody else and the story is very good, but for some it could be a tad too simplistic, but you do not always need a mad twist at the end of a film, but we still do get a sort of one here, but it was never that hard to spot. Originally released as `I Lossens Time' and runs for 89 minutes this is one for Nordic Noir fans, but whilst not being the best example of the genre, is still a worthwhile watch.",1446249600,3,1476,4.121527777777778
