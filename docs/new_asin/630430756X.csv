840283,5,630430756X,"This is one of my favorite films-not due to grand production values, or staying true to the novella, but because it packs such a powerful punch in the lesson of what life is really about. Certainly worth watching, but not really a film for shallow critical types.",1050278400,5,263,4.617021276595745

840285,4,630430756X,"This movie tels the story of a boy who is sent to live with his aunts after the death of his mother.  It's unique characters allow this heartwarming story to come to life.  A little slow moving at times, but  with just enough zanniness to keep me interested.  It shows that though  people may be different, we are actually all very much the same deep down  and all want the same thing - to be loved.",959731200,2,399,4.184210526315789
840286,4,630430756X,"Truman Capote's memoir of his past is translated to the movie screen with the right kind of homage that it deserves. Colin Fenwick, orphaned in his youth, is sent to live with his two maiden aunts and their eccentric  housekeeper. The awakening of his senses of the outside world is shaped by  these women. Vereena-the hardened bussinesswoman, Dolly-the free spirit  filled with a warmth that is like a comfortable blanket on a cold winter  morning, and Catherine-the opinionated but loyal and protective  housekeeper. Charles Matthau has given us a movie devoid of the  tastelessness that permeates most Hollywood movies these days. We move  lazily along (as it was in the South) getting to know each character  intimately and at the end, we are the richer for it. BRAVO!",954028800,12,772,4.9765625
840287,4,630430756X,"This is the type of film that we want hollywood to make and remake, fun uplifting movie that the whole family can watch then talk about what each person has seen within the film and reaction to what was felt by them as  they watched A must see type of movie great writing and acting.",944870400,2,283,4.1454545454545455
840288,5,630430756X,"I saw this last night on tv. Normally the kind of movie I pass over, I stopped to watch it because of the cast. And I am ever glad that I did. The actors were at their best -- even Walter Mathou whom I normally don't care  for. And Nell Carter! Why hasn't she been in more and more movies. She was  truly a pleasure to experience.
The cast goes on to include not only  Piper Laurie and Sissy Spacek, but also Roddy McDowell, Edward Furlong,  Charles Durning, and Mary Steenburgen -- all with their own eccentricities.  All a joy to watch.
I smiled and smiled. I cried and cried. The kind of  feelings that we all need tugged at and pulled on and brought out. One of  the best feelings I've experienced in a long time.

840289,5,630430756X,"This is one of the best film I have watched.

840291,5,630430756X,"The time period and story were perfectly mated, as were the actors and actresses who played the parts--and so many well known people had parts--it was a kick.  There is sentimentalism and meaning behind the ""grass  harp"" which will touch the heart of anyone who has lost someone near  and dear to them.",913161600,,302,4.660377358490566
840376,2,630430756X,"i can't believe how bad this movie was. I really wanted to like it.  I love period films, i love mild sweet stories with no sex or violence,and was impressed by the stellar cast. But what a dud!
It starts strong, with the narrator telling us how he lost both his parents around the same time, and we're rooting for our protagonist to take on the world.  Soon we realize his big adventure is life inside a large Victorian house with two middle-aged spinsters and their maid.  We then see that the soft-spoken spinster is the actual star of the movie, the one who hears the titular harp music in grass, the one whose journey we are actually following.
Spoilers:  When things get interesting there, they suddenly turn fantastical when the solution to the spinster's problem is to move into a tree house where the maid, the narrator, one of his buddies, and a suitor eventually join her.
It then turns madcap as the townspeople try to get this group of rebels out of the treehouse.  Yes, that's the plot.
Things really get crazy when a loose woman and her 15 illegitimate children join the fun.
Yes, we're supposed to be learning lessons here, don't judge, love each other, blah blah blah.  But all i learned was that Hollywood can con a lot of big stars into doing a really DUMB movie if it's based on a novel by a respected author.
I have a confession, i only watched this because i like Edward Furlong. He only had a couple scenes where his character showed a glimmer of personality, such a waste.  And I think the stars of the film (Piper Laurie and Edward Furlong) should have at least rated the cover of the DVD.",1502582400,,1614,4.450847457627119

I'm not knocking all the movies Hollywood is putting out now, but so very many of them really are junk.  This one is not, and I never heard of it until Amazon, in their infinite wisdom, recommended it to me.  (Smart computer they have, right?)
I felt so good after watching this.  It is uplifting, funny, and the scenery is, well, real!  It was made close to where it says it all happened, mosquitos and mud and the rest of the regional comforts.  Just watch it and see what it makes you feel.",1455926400,5,657,4.25

840505,1,630430756X,"The film, in my opinion, is a nostalgic fantasy, that could not possibly be true. Walter Matthau and Piper Laurie did very well, as they
always seem to do, despite a weak supporting cast. Sissy Spacek was too predictable. Jack Lemmon's character was overly vulgar for no good reason. He's too fine an actor for the ultra slick character, that he is portraying. Joe Don Baker's caricature of a good ol' boy sheriff,
is not convincing. Senior citizens living in a treehouse, where it hardly ever rains, but the grass and trees are very green? Mary Steenburgen
has how many kids to take care of? So, she rubs against the men who come to her camp meeting for money? I wasted my money buying it
and my time watching it. My wife could not sit through the ending: very good judgment on her part. No interaction between Lemmon and
Matthau...there should have been. Roddy McDowall as the barber, calling men and boy 'honey,' to what purpose? Nell Carter's character
was too overdone...she deserved a great story with a plot, as did Mathhau and Laurie. They didn't get it.",1440892800,,1062,4.654255319148936

840722,5,630430756X,"HIGHLY underrated!  Based on a wonderful book by Truman Capote.  It is like a painting by a talented artist:  light touches in the story line here and there are not, in themselves, that spectacular but when the whole is viewed a poignant and beautiful masterpiece is revealed.  Note the simple things as you watch:  Colin's hesitant beginning strokes; the circles of loves lost, found, and lost again (multiple characters); the wavy lines of the value of money and what it can and can't buy; the darker sides of faithfulness and faithlessness...I could go on and on.  Its NOT a bang-em-up, shoot-em-up, bloody, raunchy, sci-fi spy-robo-intrigue-action-sex-comedy. It is an intellectual gentle love story--not the kind of jump-into-bed-with-rank-strangers-type, but it highlights the love of friends and family and tests the traditional guidelines of attraction and romance.

840838,5,630430756X,"I adore this movie.  I saw it quite awhile ago, so I can't give many specifics, but you can read the other reviews for commentary on the performances.  An ensemble cast rather than a real star turn for anyone, with the exception of Piper Laurie.  Laurie is always wonderful in her varied roles, and this is a very sweet and graceful conception of a child-like character.  She never plays it for laughs, and the portrayal does not indicate that childlike here is equivalent to childish or emotionally disturbed.  Poor Sissy Spacek is cast as a typical ""old maid/prude"", unfortunately;  the writer(s) might have made the two women's roles less extreme in their behavior, but it does contribute to the reconciliation at the end.  I think I will put this movie on my wishlist.  By the way, I came across this movie on an [...] list that gave a rundown of all the movies the very interesting Mia Kirshner has been in.  I don't remember her being in the movie, and apparently she had a small role, but it makes me even more eager to see the movie again.  She's hot, and I love her on ""The L Word"".  One more note--I have never particularly liked
Walter Matthau, but he does an amazing job with his role.  It's worth it to see the very elderly Matthau wrap up his career with an attractive acting job.  The title of the movie aptly reflects the airy tone of the story--there is a kind of windy music flowing throughout the performance.

840839,4,630430756X,"""The Grass Harp"" (1995) will remind a lot of viewers of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". Not a huge surprise given that both stories involve Truman Capote's childhood (Harper Lee based the Dill Harris character on Capote). Both films also use small Alabama towns for their locations.

Capote loosely based his 1951 ""The Glass Harp"" novella on the eccentric maiden cousins of his childhood. For the film Piper Laurie plays good Aunt Dolly and Sissy Spacek bad Aunt Verena (who is even less likable than Pollyanna's Aunt Polly). Spacek gets to do something out of character and nicely underplays this one. Laurie gets to have even more fun and turns in a joyful performance. She is a little too good to be true but Laurie manages to sell the character with a remarkable performance. In the 1950's Laurie was an extremely pretty (and hot) young starlet but it is obvious from this and her performance in ""Carrie"" (playing Spacek's mother) that there was a lot of substance in that pretty package.

Edward Furlong (best know as John Conner in ""Terminator 2"") avoids the ""Pollyanna"" trap and is pretty easy to take. The coming-of-age side of the story works quite well.

""The Grass Harp"" is a bit underrated, probably because the screenplay fails to capture the lyrical quality of Capote's storytelling, giving the viewer a surfeit of sentimentality compounded by a too sweet score. The title is a reference to the musical sound of blowing grass, a metaphor about intergenerational connections and the primary theme of the story.

The film would have benefited from a little more restraint. This is not a fatal flaw but the film would have been more powerful with Mockingbird's toned down production design and less colorful characters; maybe even going so far as to release it in black and white.

Those looking for action adventure and hot romance should look elsewhere. But there are a lot of ""Mockingbird"" fans out there who should really enjoy ""The Grass Harp"".

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1172966400,7,2000,4.850439882697947

840841,2,630430756X,"The main fun of this film is picking out the stars often

playing minor roles. In the movie Carrie, Piper Laurie

played Sissy Spacek's religious fundamentalist mother.  In

this film the roles are reversed with Spacek playing Laurie's

domineering sister. Keep an eye out for Walter and Charles

Matthau, Nell Carter, Jack Lemmon, Mary Steenburgen, Joe

Don Baker, Charles Durning, Roddy McDowall and Doris Roberts

(Mildred on Remington Steele).

The movie is extremely slow paced.  You know how movies

often go syrupy right at the end where the actors start

mouthing platitudes and smiling benignly into the sunset or

running over fields. This movie goes on like that for the

last 20 minutes of the movie. It became so unbearably

saccharine I started laughing.

The other pleasure of this movie is the recreations a

gentler time, the south in the 1930s. Lavish interiors,

antique cars, prudish townspeople and nature in fall colours

are a feast for the eye.",1134518400,7,968,5.012658227848101
840842,5,630430756X,"Set in the 30's, The Grass Harp is a story about an orphan boy who is sent to live with his eccentric aunts. The story follows the plight of social ""outcasts"" with humor and insight.

On the surface this story is about love and our connections to others - both living and dead. Yet underneath run themes of social prejudice, racial inequality, religion, morals and the struggles of social conformity vs. individual expression - but the film never preaches. It just reveals.

Director Charles Matthau accomplished the near-impossible task of adapting Truman Capote's classic book into a beautiful rendered film. Wisely, he approached this multi-layered story with a light touch, allowing the material and talent to shine. Matthau skillfully captures a myriad of complex relationships and emotions, allowing the characters to live and breathe without placing judgment on who they are.

The boy's coming-of-age story is entertaining, humorous and poignant. As the film unfolds, Collin encounters a diverse group of characters, from which he gains valuable insights about life. Now an adult he looks back (as the narrator) reflecting on this formative time.

Each character is uniquely distinct and true-to-life. The entire all-star cast is at the top of their game.

This is the best performance of Piper Laurie's career. She is delicate and mesmerizing as the fragile Dolly Talbo. Her scenes with Spacey and Matthau will break your heart.

For those of you who have only seen Walter Matthau in grumpy curmudgeon roles, you are in for a treat!  Matthau is wonderful as a Judge Cool, a Southern gentleman struggling to find meaning in his retirement years. As Piper Laurie's love interest he is tender and charming yet dignified. A man of integrity and honor, Judge Cool is the only ""accepted"" towns person with compassion for the outcasts.

As a collective, the ensemble cast captures the social pecking order with uncanny accuracy.

Jon Don Baker is great as the Sheriff, Nell Carter is a hoot as the eccentric housekeeper and Sissy Spacek is an amazing blend of steely resolve masking her conflicted feelings of vulnerability and insecurity.

Roddy McDowell is the delightfully sarcastic barber. Jack Lemmon and Mary Steenbergen are great fun as out-of-towners who stir things up.  Mary as a traveling cowgirl evangelist out to save souls - never mind that she is a single- mother of fourteen kids...all by different fathers! She pulls it off with comic charm and sad poignancy. Lemmon is a ""chemical engineer"" (read quack potions salesman) with a scheme to get his hands on Dolly's herbal potion.  Although some locals may be skeptical about Lemmon and Steenbergen motives, they never play their roles in black and white terms.

The film is exceptionally well written, particularly considering how many characters there were to juggle.  All the characters are well-developed and performed.  Even the shady characters are oh-so-human in their desperate schemes to survive the Great Depression.

There is also one of the most delightful casts of furry creatures ever assembled: a host of cats, dogs, fish, and a scene-stealing Rooster named Ralph. It looked to me like Ralph was huffing around wishing he had more lines. I'd be all for him getting his own sequel.",1114473600,46,3261,5.112994350282486

7867729,4,630430756X,"Truman Capote is one of my favorite writers. Unfortunately, he is remembered more for being an eccentric celebrity than the genius short story and novella writer that he was. His early work, like this tale, is semi-autobiographical. He was raised in the south by his aunts and was very close to the one who was considered odd by the townspeople. I highly recommend reading his stories. As for the film version of this one, it is a mixed bag. The actors are just perfect in their parts. They bring the characters right off of the pages. What doesn't work is the atmosphere. The Southern Gothic feel is just not there. Some moments borderline Hallmark. Could have done without the voice-over.
