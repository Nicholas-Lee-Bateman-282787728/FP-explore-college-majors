8554078,4,B00AMQG1F0,First of all alot of the girls are very pretty so don't be an ass. Second everyone starts off somewhere who cares if it was low budget. Not everyone has a s*** ton of money. And I enjoyed the mask. Stop judging when you have no right. The point is people everything starts somewhere and everyone starts somewhere. Shouldnt really matter where. And to try and say non of these girls are attractive is crazy. Alot of then are really pretty. So really stop judging and let people have their fun.,1423958400,,492,4.417582417582418
8554079,2,B00AMQG1F0,"""Slice"" is a bottom basement slasher movie. Some girls decide to have a Halloween party at one of the girls house and the slicing begins. This movie is really, really, really low budget. They couldn't even afford to make a decent mask for the killer. And the actresses in this flick all look like dykes! Seriously, there's not a pretty girl among them. Don't waste your time or money this one.",1405555200,,393,4.549295774647887
