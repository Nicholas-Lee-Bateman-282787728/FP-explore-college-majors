8309172,3,B001HNJ0QO,"A steadfast fan of 21 Jump Street - Booker was my second favourite character (after Tom).

The series starts off really well, but during the last 10 or so episodes Booker goes from being a loner with a fantastic secretary - to the secretary getting married and Lori Petty being reinserted into the series as the very annoying Suzanne (I liked her in the first episode she appeared - but it is just too much) and having a bestfriend (previously unmentioned up to the point).

The storylines are quite good and the series is worth watching. It has some fantastic guest appearances by Mariska Hargitay (Law and Order SVU) and Don S. Davis (Stargate SG1).

Any fan of 21 Jump Street needs to watch this - even if Booker never does track down the villan from the crossover episode.",1239926400,,776,4.568345323741007
