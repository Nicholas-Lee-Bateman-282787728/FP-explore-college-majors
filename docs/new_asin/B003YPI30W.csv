4231355,4,B003YPI30W,Dr John Hartnett is a very precise speaker and shows his ability to share an often misguided message in such a way that we can all understand the  truth behind what we see within these DVD's.  Dr Hartnett has amazed us all with his understanding of the universe and put right many fables that  some people.teach.  Money well spent and a privelage to view.,1430265600,6,355,4.5
4231356,5,B003YPI30W,"This set of movies progress a little slower than others like it, but that is not bad. They do a very good job of making their points in an easy to understand way. I truly enjoyed watching and learning. You will find the DVDs are well done and easy to watch and most important to undersand. By the way there is a great deal of new information within these DVDs.",1416960000,8,360,4.1571428571428575
4231357,5,B003YPI30W,"Before viewing this dvd, I was doubtful anyone could ""prove"" a young sun. I was wrong -- they do prove it. They do it by making you aware that the temperature of white dwarfs is related to their age, and the temp of our own sun is such that it must be young. If it were actually older, as evolutionists insist, two things would be true: 1) it would have to be much hotter and larger than it is -- as are all other dwarf stars; and 2) it would of necessity have been so cold in the past that the earth would have been a frozen ball and evolution would have been impossible.",1361318400,15,572,4.026315789473684
4231358,4,B003YPI30W,"Fast delivery to my address in Europe and outstanding science.
Especially ""The  Young Sun"" is a great DVD. One can buy it separately from ""The Heavens Declare"": its cheaper that way.
""The young Sun"" defies and is making void the speculation that the sun must be in the midst of its 'life'-span  and is at least 3 or 4 billion years old.
If the sun - as a middle class star - is 3 or 4 billion years old - like the secular big-bang priests are telling us, the first life must have been ""evolved"" on an iceball.
Because in that case the  sun would have been 20 to 30% colder at that time and the earth a frozen ice-ball, when life spontanously evolved in a 'warm soup'.
Under these conditions Darwin and the evolutionchurch yet believe that on a relatively warm earth and in a warm soup the first simple living cells evolved.
By the way: simple living cells do not exist. They are more complicated than the most advanced machine mankind has ever built.
Furthermore according to Darwin and the followers of primitive biochemistry-scientists, the earth was warmer, due to a global warming effect by 2 gasses: methane and ammomnia.  Unfortunately ammonia and methane will not store warmth on an iceball but will lose it.  When life evolved -  according to the evolutionists - ,they admit the sun was young. But lately they found out that the normal young stars of the size and class of our sun not just are much colder but they ALL have violent weekly outbursts of deadly radiation. These outbursts would have blown away any atmosphere on earth.
Moreover, deadly radiation would have destroyed all life in their frozen 'evolutionsoup' Evolutiontheory ignores the fact that in their scenario the earth was not just a bit colder. A deep-freeze ice-ball is more like it.

But find out it yourself in this outstanding DVD that in fact the sun is a unique star and why it is young indeed and not old and much much more. It is fascinating!

This all means that the evolutionchurch again has no ground to stand on.
It is no science at all, but being willingly ignorant and speculation. But that is something more and more people already realize and discover.
Because over and over again we see that real science is proving the evolutiontheory is pure nonsense and no science at all. Even Darwin admitted this fact in his book, the origin of species,  that his speculations are very very unlikely and in fact impossible.  But we do not hear much of that when scientist are ignoring or even mocking Gods Word,do we folks?
More than 2300 years ago, long before mankind could know and had no instruments to find out that the universe is expanding,  the bible clearly is telling us that the earth is round and it is telling us more than once that God created the universe and that the universe is expanding. More than 2300 years ago. Think about it!
Come on guys and girls, read it yourself or learn another trade.

4231359,5,B003YPI30W,"We purchased this series for our upper elementary aged son.  He had been learning about space in school and his interest was sparked.  He really enjoyed this series.  I also found the series fascinating. I have watched most of the series and plan to watch the rest when they are returned to us.  (He lent them to his teacher.)  The theories presented regarding distant starlight, the uniqueness of the sun as a star, and the improbability of finding life in outer space are thought provoking and Biblical.  In my opinion, this series is appropriate for upper elementary through adult age groups.  Although our son does not completely understand all the information presented, there are enough rocket and space pictures to keep him interested.  He will grow into the rest of the information.",1305763200,17,790,4.931818181818182

Geology and astronomy are my hot buttons and I measure all things in accordance with real evidence, not the PIDOOMAs of the true believers who have left the scientific process for no other reason than to wipe out a Divine Creator.",1525305600,,326,4.5423728813559325
