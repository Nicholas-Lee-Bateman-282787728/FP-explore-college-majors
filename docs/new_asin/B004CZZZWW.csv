It is about a troubled teenage boy that is sent to boys town. His mother is an alcoholic and the boy smokes and steals car and almost killed his best friend in a stolen car. In boys town Art Carney is a priest, the town is filled with troubled boys. Well I'm not going to tell you a lot of specifics because if I told you everything that happened it would be a spoiler, but it is a great movie with a well acted cast.",1482796800,,551,4.064220183486238
