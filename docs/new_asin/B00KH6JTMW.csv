6426973,1,B00KH6JTMW,"I wasn't sure if I could give 0/5 and post- had that'd been the case, I would have. This is a fumbling sophomoric attempt at a documentary on the Floyd. Completely unauthorized and totally meritless. No interviews with band members or footage. A big glossly book with pictures I've seen a thousand times, and song by song trivia from which I learned nothing. I'd be more entertained, and likely learn more by watching my dog look at a shoe.",1416441600,76,440,4.582278481012659
6426974,1,B00KH6JTMW,"Looks like it was made by a student. It's a ton of interviews with people you don't know talking about nonsense that will put you to sleep immediatly. Nothing new here at all, I've seen and heard everything they are talking about. SKIP THIS!!! It'll be in the bargain bin or on sale on amazon for $5 in a week.",1416268800,44,310,4.183333333333334
6426975,1,B00KH6JTMW,Buyer Beware!!  This is an unofficial book not endorsed by the band.  The quality of the dvds is poor at best and the book itself tells you nothing you didn't already know.  The seller really should have provided more detail about the book....ie. the fact that it's an unofficial documentary by Blitz Books.,1416268800,33,307,4.754716981132075

6426977,1,B00KH6JTMW,"If you want Pink Floyd Information then I suggest The Rolling Stone Magazine Special Collectors Edition ""Pink Floyd, The Ultimate Guide to Their Music and Legend"" for $11.99 List Price yet it was pulled from the shelves no later than February 27, 2014. You can watch a boring documentary or read it from the best who interveiwed the best over the years.  Besides they have not been on the Darkside of the Moon for 50 years.they will see us On the Darkside of the Moon.they haven't been there for 50 years..",1412985600,43,506,4.56043956043956
6426978,1,B00KH6JTMW,This was not put out by the band. People who try to make money off the success of someone else should be locked up.,1412899200,81,115,3.8333333333333335
6426979,1,B00KH6JTMW,Not one word of this on the Pink Floyd web site.  Unofficial and pass until it hits $7.99.,1412726400,74,90,4.0
6426980,1,B00KH6JTMW,"Looks very unofficial, and thus definitely not worth the price.",1411862400,36,63,5.4

6426984,5,B00KH6JTMW,"The admission price is worth the four DVDs by themselves, the book is very informative and a joy for any Floyd fan. I will cherish this forever.",1420156800,,144,4.37037037037037
6426985,4,B00KH6JTMW,actually came as a surprise....this is a history supplied by others...not the band it is however very good,1419724800,3,106,4.944444444444445
6426986,2,B00KH6JTMW,Interesting for one watch.  The greatest irony of this sophomoric documentary is that there are zero actual notes played by Pink Floyd.  Big fans and musicians will like it.,1419206400,,173,4.931034482758621

6426991,3,B00KH6JTMW,"I didn't find this as bad as some of the others. I've seen countless interviews with and of the band and although some feel this is a  cheesy ensemble and all based on the music, I found it really interesting to find out how much went into their music creation and recording - especially without todays technology. They are truly remarkable artists that will never be duplicated.",1416614400,7,379,4.656716417910448

8658786,1,B00KH6JTMW,This was a total waste of good money.  A bunch of unknown boobs rabbiting on about Pink Floyd.  What a bust!,1483315200,5,108,4.095238095238095

8658789,5,B00KH6JTMW,"while there is no pink floyd in the 4 dvd box set it's still great work... it's pretty much people who worked, partied, and friends talking about our favorite band... I love this piece it has tons of snippets of information that I didn't know..... if you are looking for pink floyd this is not for you... if you want pink floyd stories from the people who worked with them then this is the product for you",1448064000,,405,4.2727272727272725
8658790,5,B00KH6JTMW,This is awesome and I cant wait for my husband to unwrap this on Christmas morning. The price was great and the shipping was really quick even though it wasn't Prime! I would definitely recommend this seller.,1447891200,,208,4.648648648648648
8658791,1,B00KH6JTMW,"I gave this set 2 stars simply because it's Pink Floyd. Or about them. Or something. The narrative is OK, but by nobodies. The photos are decent, but so are the photos in about a gillion other PF books. The DVDs are essentially a sham. Really, they're an insult to the buyer. I wasted good money buying this travesty. I think I'll change my rating to ONE star before I post this.",1442016000,4,379,4.277777777777778
8658792,4,B00KH6JTMW,"This book and CD'S on Pink Floyd is highly recommended....But if you're looking for CD's with members of the band speaking don't get these .
It is a very informative book with great pictures....The CD's are very comprehensive but are spoken by people , not members of the band....
I think though that this is a product well worth the money...",1436659200,,342,4.622950819672131
