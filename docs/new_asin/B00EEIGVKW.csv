8604758,4,B00EEIGVKW,"After viewing some different DVD on NYC i have to revise my first not favorable opinion. It gives a  brief overview on the city. I only missed the 5th Avenue. Grants Tomb and the African Burial Ground and the Statue of Liberty, the Federal Hall and 2 Forts, the Empire State Building, Ground Zero, Ellis. Island were presented in a interesting way, other sites were presented a little more superficially. It is a useful for an approach to the city. A very little deceiving is the picture quality of the Blu Ray corresponding rather to a good DVD!  - The Shipping to Europe was excellent speedy!
Finally it's as far as I know the most recent presentation by DVD/Blue Ray of NYC !!!",1445299200,,680,4.520325203252033
