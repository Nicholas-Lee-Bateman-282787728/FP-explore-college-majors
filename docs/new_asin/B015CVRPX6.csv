I guess this movie doesn't have as much selling potential as their more typical output, but is actually one of the very BEST adaptations I've ever seen of the Iliad in any format. For me, the dirty look and the English- dubbing, plus the little perks these guys usually include only adds to bringing back the feel of watching that ultra-rare flick on VHS everybody talks about but no one has seen, or those double features they would show back in the day for just spare change. The jumping car scene really has to be seen to be believed!",1520035200,,688,4.468253968253968
8733165,1,B015CVRPX6,"Terrible condition and a big disappointment.
1) Video quality very bad
2) The movie is dubbed in English something which was not explained during the purchasing process
3) The movie is dubbed and it sounds horrific
4) The quality of the sound track is very bad

Not sure who's fault is it but this was a terrible experience and we would like to  return the movie and get our money back.",1482969600,,386,4.422535211267606
