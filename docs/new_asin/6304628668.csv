7876081,5,6304628668,"Paramount Pictures presents ""HILLS OF OLD WYOMING"" (1937) (79 mins/B&W), features Stephen Morris (Morris Ankrum) using both names on the screen, as the ""western heavy"", came to Hollywood and Westerns directly from supporting Orson Welles on Broadway, Sherman and Boyd must have seen the evil this actor could portray, as he appeared in several ""Hoppy films""...another pick for ""Pop"" Sherman was a new sidekick for the Cassidy films...a newcomer Lucky Jenkins, played by Russell Hayden had his job cut out for him, with Boyd (as the hero) and Hayes (for comedy), left the field of romance and action wide open, Hayden filled those ""boots"" perfectly.

The most outstanding series of westerns began in 1935 from Paramount Pictures ""Hopalong Cassidy"", under the guiding hand of producer Harry ""Pop"" Sherman...continued well into the '40s proved to be the most successful 'B' Westerns ever made...based on Clarence E. Mulford's stories, they strived in changing Cassidy's image, which was both original and influential...the hero, played by William Lawrence Boyd, was mature and a man of his word...the plots were solid with a sudden burst of climactic action in the last reel, usually a frantic chase backed by tension-building music.

In all, Boyd made sixty-six Hopalong Cassidy Westerns, early films included Uncle Ben and Windy Halliday, both played by veteran actor George ""Gabby"" Hayes...was a steady favorite as a hitchrack, was chosen five years in succession as one of the 10 best money-making Western sidekick stars...like most western comics, had his share of narrow escapes being thrown from his horse, burned by blanks...but that was all in a days work...his one-liners will never be forgotten...""You're dern tootin'""...""Never trust a female, they're pure poyzin""...or my all-time favorite ~ ""Persnickgordy Women""...this crusty old-timer stole many a scene from John Wayne, Randolph Scott and yes even William Boyd.

William Lawrence Boyd, known as Hop-A-Long Cassidy never wears any outfit except his charactertistic black shirt, trousers, boots and Stetson...Hoppy rode, grinned and fought his way into our hearts on the silver screen and then right into our living rooms with a new inventions called...Television! ... Great Cast of Jimmy Ellison (Johnny Nelson) always hot-headed & getting into trouble...but the scene stealer is George ""Gabby"" Hayes, as the old-timer Uncle Ben, gives the a film shot in the arm with his down-to-earth humor and sentimentality, as the father figure to Hoppy the interaction with Boyd's character is pure Americana!

Must mention that it was sure good to see one of my all-time-favorite sidekicks George ""Gabby"" Hayes throw in with Hoppy. The added special features are simply great ~ Coming Attractions:""Hopalong Cassidy:Public Hero #1"", plus a poster gallery, still gallery and my favorite is original materials from ""Merchandising King of the Cowboys"" museum exhibit. Hope ""Image Entertainment"" will keep releasing this outstanding series featuring Hopalong Cassidy in glorious black & white. I'll be standing in line for the next adventure with the Bar-20 wranglers ~ William Boyd (Hopalong Cassidy), they'll never be another like him.

Hoppy's interaction with California Carlson (Andy Clyde) is always a shot in the arm with his down-to-earth humor and sentimentality, theses scenes are pure Americana! Boyd, with his silver hair, black clothes and white horse (Topper) rode into our lives and we've never been the same since...your children and grandchildren will enjoy this clean wholesome entertainment...Hoppy always wore two silver white handle six shooters, never drank or smoked, when the good guys always won and the moral to the story was fair-play...outstanding role model...gotta love it!

Another pick for ""Pop"" Sherman was a new sidekick for the Cassidy films...a newcomer Lucky Jenkins, played by Russell Hayden had his job cut out for him, with Boyd (as the hero) and Andy Clyde (California Carlson) for comedy, left the field of romance and action wide open, Hayden filled those ""boots"" perfectly.

William Boyd was my hero, this collection of his films are perfect, clear and give me hope for the future. Our youth should have such a hero to look up to today. Must mention the fact that I still miss one of my all-time-favorite sidekicks though, George ""Gabby"" Hayes, you're durn tootin'!

Paramount and Clarence E. Mulford's fictional western character Hopalong Cassidy comes to life through William Boyd as Hoppy and Andy Clyde as California with films from the '40s...horse operas directed by Lesley Selander and George Archainbaud...some of the best hard riding and smokin' gunplay that ever came across the big screen from the Bar 20 boys...just the way we like 'em.",1162166400,,4739,5.343163538873995
7876082,4,6304628668,"This 1937 Hopalong Cassidy film was filmed on the Chiwaue Indian reservation in Wyoming and is an excellent B grade western oater - with a slow buildup leading to the usual rousing climax.  Ranchers in the area are losing cattle to rustlers and the Indians are being blamed but in fact the chief crook is the deputy agent on the tribal reservation, Andrews (Morris Ankrum),who is trying to incriminate the tribe he is supposed to be helping. Hoppy (William Boyd) is alert to Andrews crooked ways but is soon in big trouble after this outlaw snatches the crooked half-breed, Lone Eagle, from Hoppy's camp and murders him in an attempt to foment trouble for Cassidy and between the ranchers and Indians. Hoppy, Lucky and Windy are captured by Chief Big Tree (played by Chief John Big Tree) but Hoppy is given a chance to prove his innocence whilst his friends remain captives. Cassidy manages to steal the deputy agent's rifle and carries out a ballistics test to the the satisfaction of the Chief.
Then follows the mandatory chase and action scenes so typical of the genre. This movie was the first of 27 for Russell Hayden ,as Lucky Jenkins, replacing Jimmy Ellison who had moved onto other things after playing Hoppy's side-kick Johnny Nelson in the first 9 Cassidy films, commencing in 1935. Hayden, who started in film production work, is generally regarded by Cassidy afficionados as the best of Hoppy's young 'pardners'. The outdoor scenery of this Cassidy film is great, as usual, and by this third season of filming William Boyd had already acquired international recognition as Hopalong Cassidy, with one Australian cinema manager being quoted as saying the Cassidy films were amongst the most popular Hollywood drawcards of the time - and it kept getting better for Boyd. Although these films may lack the worldly sophistication of current films there is a wholesome quality to them and they have to be judged in the context of their time. The 66 Cassidy films, produced between 1935-48, were still being played into the 1960's -that is tribute enough to Bill Boyd's durability and charisma as the greatest knight of the sagebrush-Hopalong Cassidy.",976492800,5,2157,4.9421487603305785
