7865811,5,6304258917,"I was so glad to find the Creation video.  Apparently these are not in print any more.  It is perfect for our Christian preschool.  The jacket was worn, but so what!  The movie works great!",1378771200,,189,4.314285714285714
7865812,5,6304258917,Great teaching tool for young children.  Have  purchased more than one tape.  Would recommend to anyone wanting to educate their kids via cartoons.,1370390400,,147,5.304347826086956
7865813,4,6304258917,"I didn't think it was that bad nor did my 4 year old grand daughter. I have heard worse narration and I never knew animated characters acted. Learn how to spell before you write another review. fiffteen = fifteen - ammused = amused
deffinatly = definitely - reccamend = recommend - boaring = boring - unentertaining <is that a word?? You can find these videos on You Tube. Watch them - see for yourself",1349136000,,402,4.445945945945946
7865814,5,6304258917,"As with all Beginner's Bible Stories, this one was great. I love this series because of how simple and effective, and enjoyable for little ears and eyes. I used to watch these as a kid, and the Beginner's Bible was my favorite book. It was soothing when I felt scared. These movies are so great for kids. Totally recommend them to any parent for their little ones. Will be enjoyed for years.",1299542400,,391,4.444444444444445
7865815,5,6304258917,"We have most of the Beginner's Bible series, and this is one of his favorites.  I do not believe these videos are intended for toddlers - my son still loves them at six but he really didn't watch them until he was three or four.",1038182400,7,228,4.066666666666666
7865816,1,6304258917,"Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! This video is so bad it doesn't even get a ratting. The narrartor is dull and boaring. The acting is pathetic and the way the story is told is down right bad. My fiffteen month old who usually loves to sit down and whatch christian video was highly annnoyed. He was so not ammused he began to cry. This is deffinatly not for kids. I don't even reccamend it for preeteens or teenagers. It's long boaring, unentertaining, and lacks good music. I rather stick to talking vegetables and puppets (Veggie Tales and Great Bible Adventuures.",1014940800,,563,4.755102040816326
7865817,2,6304258917,"I got this video for my kids, but took it back.  I expect a Bible video to be accurate & this one was not.  It had Eve being created after the Sabbath instead of on Friday.  This is a gross error & there really isn't any excuse for it.  If you want your kids to learn the truth, don't let them watch this one!",988502400,3,309,3.78125
