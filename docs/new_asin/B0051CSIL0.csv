4521182,3,B0051CSIL0,"""We die, or worse yet, we die and comeback.""  After the collapse of the US economy and a horrific vampire epidemic sweeps the country very few humans are left.  Along with vampire hunter Mister (Damici), Martin (Paolo) decides to drive to Canada for saftey.  This will probebly be a short review.  The only way to explain this really is that this is a serious version of ""Zombieland"", only with vampires and not zombies.  Both have a older and a younger man who travel together and kill bad guys.  They meet a girl on the way who joins them. Only thing this is missing is a cameo by a big name star.  Unlike ""Zombieland"" though this one went straight serious and horror, which isn't a bad thing really. Overall, not a bad movie, but I prefer the comedy one better.  I give it a C.

Would I watch again? - Probebly not, but it made me want to watch ""Zombieland"" again.

*Also try - Shadowland & Zombieland",1311724800,3,904,4.391566265060241
4521183,4,B0051CSIL0,"Stake Land is not a big budget movie. The special effects suffer if you look too closely, but they are typically shot in such a way that it's not too noticeable. The movie itself is actually quite good. I was surprised to discover that I actually cared about the characters even though we really don't learn a ton about them besides what we see them do.

The plot is not ""dudes mow down tons of zombies with big guns"". It's dark and brutal and real. There is one part near the end that is incongruous - more of an action horror film type of event - but not over much is made of it.

Stake Land is a step up from many big budget zombie movies. Its director really makes the most of his resources and shows some real skill. The ending is rather open ended, so be warned if you hate those.  That aside, I would definitely recommend it.",1308700800,5,832,4.1875
4521184,4,B0051CSIL0,"Stakeland was a great Vampire/ Zombie movie. The vampires are definitely of the ""30 DAYS of Night "" brand, only more feral and animalistic. The vamps spread over the world and pockets of resistance exist that try to conduct human life as before, but there's another problem lurking about. There's a group of religious zealots who believe that the vampire outbreak is a sign from GOD to cleanse the earth and they use the vampires to do his(their) bidding. Stakeland is a coming of age film about a boy, his vampire killing trainer and a small revolving cast of people who could be his mom, brother and sister, and even girlfriend. Along the way he's faced with a stern un-feeling mentor names Mister who saves his life one fateful night and takes him as a pseudo-son and trains him for the harsh reality of living in a world filled with vampires. As I said, the film works great with good action sequences and down time scenes that don't drag on and help advance the story. My one problem is with the leader of the brotherhood and something that happens that nearly ruined the film for me. (SPOILER ALERT!!!It's a lot like what happened with Steve in Dawn of the Dead. The foreshadowing that if he was to turn, asking Sarah Polley to kill him. We all know what's going to happen right? But look how it happened: We have to overlook why once the zombie bit him, he must have killed it , although he didn't have any type of weapon, and he was given a fatal bite that killed him immediately. See if the zombie kille dhim, what happened to it? Did it run miles away after a killing blow cause he doesn't eat his victims he just kills them?  Why wasn't he ating Steve instead of Steve walking around reanimated? I hated that. Still do. Well we get soemthing akin tot hat here and it was so ridiculous that I almost stopped watching. I gave them a pass on that one small stupid plot device though, and overall I liked the movie anyway. OK. END SPOILER!!)

This is a good movie and if you liek your vampires as monsters, this is the film for you. You will enjoy it. Oh, and there's a scene 10 minutes in that I did not think I would ever see in an American film. Something so heinous that I had to rewatch it to make sure I saw it. You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it. Keep your eyes open for it. WOW.",1308268800,5,2309,4.317972350230415
4521185,5,B0051CSIL0,"I recently viewed this movie during it's limited theater run, via Time Warner Cable. I'm a huge fan of horror and all off shoots, as well as cult cinema. I have to say that this picture was a breath of fresh air, compared to the commercial standard that's been burning the retina's for sometime. Stakeland is brought to you by the folks from Mulberry Street.(another fine film) Cast wise it's a virtual nobody list, although it does star the annoying little girl from the Halloween series. You know the one who couldn't talk, but could scream louder than all her cast members combined. Anyway, she's all grown up, and I must say she has come into her own, and is very attractive as the pregnant girl in this picture. The plot is a combination of the Road/28 Days Later/Mad Max/ and at least five other cult films from the last two decades. Now this may sound like old hat, but the screenwriting is fresh, and unpredictable. I wasn't quite sure what was going to happen next, because the twist coincide with different bit's of film from the past. It's not plagiarism by any means. The writers should be heralded for making this film, because I can go through my VHS and DVD collection and possibly down size. A wonderful film, it's horror, it's a cautionary tale, it's drama, it's suspense, there is action, A Little gore (maybe not enough for me, August Underground is in my top five)What more can you ask for. I look forward to this camp bank rolling this into another killer feature.",1307491200,9,1485,4.586466165413534

4521202,5,B0051CSIL0,"What a surprise this film was. I was checking out some of the latest zombie-apocalyptic type films and most were what I expected, but Stake Land stood out as a really original take on the genre, not so much in content as in mood and pacing. The mood is somber and melancholy, the pacing is slow and deliberate enough to be very frustrating to a zombie-action fan. The film is very serious with a matter of fact tone that tends to be downbeat and never glorifies its violence or central characters. It feels like a chilly November day, which seems to be the season and setting of the film. Put briefly (I'm sure other reviews here offer more of the plot if you want it), a man takes on a teenage boy who has just lost his parents and teaches him to survive in a post-apocalyptic world populated by zombie-like monsters, dangerous cults and pockets of survivors. Along the way they join forces with new friends and encounter many dangers.

First of all, the writer/director Jim Mickle has created his own ""monster"" for this film. For all intents and purposes they most resemble the ""Infected"" of the 28 Days later series and look really horrible like those of 28 Weeks Later. They are called ""Vamps"" however and are a form of Vampire. They conform to the basic rules of vampires: they can't go out into sunlight, and they can only be killed by a wooden stake through the heart, or in some cases through the spine. Unlike zombies or infected, they can't be killed any other way and survive gunshots and being run over by vehicles. Unlike most cinematic vampires, they are not suave and intelligent, moody characters. They aren't even violently unromantic like the vampires of Near Dark or animalistic like the ones of 30 Days of Night. They seem to be totally on the animal level, and being attacked by them is mostly like being attacked by a pack of rabid dogs. They're fast and deadly and at least on the surface conform to the fast zombie type.

The man, known only as Mister, and the boy, Martin, are attempting to drive through Pennsylvania and New York State to Canada, where a refuge has been set up called New Eden. It's existence is questioned by some, while others say it's been overrun by cannibals. Still they travel on, killing Vamps and taking refuge with heavily armed pockets of humanity who valiantly try to keep their spirits up. They and the people they meet have as much trouble with a violent end of the world cult called The Brotherhood which tries to disguise its murderous intent under a false gloss of Christianity. The acting is credible though only Connor Paolo is known from the TV shows Gossip Girl and Revenge. Kelly McGillis as a nun is unrecognizable from her Top Gun days.

There are many scenes of terrible violence by the horrifying creatures between periods of travelling and the few happy moments allotted to the characters. Martin narrates the story during some of the travel sequences, emphasizing the matter of fact nature of this unpleasant world and filling in facts to keep things moving. The movie successfully creates that world as a place of sadness and melancholy, what I think would be the most likely mood of people trying to survive such a place. Everything in the film supports this mood. The movie was filmed in the woods of Pennsylvania and New York during the time when the trees are all bare and the sunlight is pale. An excellent musical score includes drums and electronics during attacks but otherwise tends toward acoustic folk music, melancholy strings sections, cello-piano duos reminiscent of the group Acoustic Eidolon and slow piano solos modeled on Eric Satie.

There are issues here and there. At a certain late point the film leaves its ultra-realism (considering the circumstances) and indulges in a twist that alters the tone to one more like typical horror fare, somewhat undermining its consistency up to that point. I think someone felt they had to do something like this for a general audience's expectations, but it harms the film somewhat. But it's not enough to totally ruin it and it remains a film worth seeing and one that may gain a cult following someday for its daring to be a moody character piece.",1449360000,,4178,4.703551912568306

4521206,4,B0051CSIL0,Though I'm not a fan of vampire flicks I was very impressed with this movie.  For having such a small budget it was extremely well narrated and filmed.  Every scene accurately portrayed a depressing gritty post apocalyptic society.  Dreary bleak scene locations and narration from the main character set the appropriate mood.  The story's far from original but the way it's told sets it apart from similar films. It always amazes me what talented individuals on a shoestring budget can accomplish.  A very well made film.

4521212,5,B0051CSIL0,"As the world finds itself on the brink of destruction, due to the outbreak of a hellish pandemic that has swept across the globe and its continents with irrepressible speed, turning most of the population into ferocious beast-like vampires, it seems the institution of man is doomed to rot away among the already shattered monuments of past glories.
In the midst of the crumbling civilization of the new world, we meet Mister (Nick Damici), a rough n' ready death dealer to the bloodsuckers and his partner in crime, the young boy Martin (Connor Paolo), as they travel through the ravaged states and locked down communities of this fallen America. Their goal is to make it up north to Canada or more specifically the renowned safe-haven, New Eden, which is rumored to be one of the last bastions remaining for the human race.
But the dangers of the new world order are ubiquitously present and as the union ventures forth, they become entangled with a brutal ""legion"" known as the Brotherhood, a right-wing militant group who perceives the feral bloodsuckers and the eruption that spawn them as the work of God, which they in turn have been chosen to uphold and regulate as his sworn servants and new-found earthly rulers. As conflicts between the two factions turns to out and out warfare, the confines of New Eden conversely, comes to represent a dream that slowly but surely slips further and further away.

Stake Land is the second feature from the writer, star and director team of Jim Mickle and Nick Damici and after the very promising debut that was the New York based rat virus disaster film, Mulberry Street (2006), the boys really hits it out of the park with this, their sophomore effort.
Stake Land should down a trait for those with a preference for films such as George A. Romero's various zombie entries, 28 Days Later (Danny Boyle, 2002), 28 Weeks Later (Juan Carlos Fresnadillo 2007) and all the apocalyptic features available out there but perhaps most palpably the adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's The Road (John Hillcoat, 2009).
Stake Land, at its core however, feels more like an old school western than anything else, albeit one that is jam-packed by ferocious blood sucking monsters. Our heroes are roaming through the desolated landscape, making stops at random checkpoints along their route, for whiskey, women and the occasional haircut. They are men of the land, drifters that travel by day and spend their nights sitting passively by the scarcely illuminating campfire hoping most of all to catch a few hours of sleep, before once again venturing out into the world to do battle with any and all in it. A fantastic approach to the narrative that pays off immeasurably in regards to creating a somber atmosphere and effective and appealing characters.
And speaking of characters or rather the actors portraying them, I'm quite pleased to report that by and large, their efforts are exceedingly rewarding. Nick Damici shines overall however, as his representation of the gruff bad to the bone vampire hunter Mister, embodies everything that a mean, hard-core alpha-male needs to be in order to work effectively on screen. Mister is the sort of disestablished loner that John Carpenter perfected in crafting, at the early stages of his career and to experience that kind of character without having the filmmakers pussy out and compromising his anti-heroic antics at the altar of bland, crowed-pleasing ""entertainment"", constitutes a great deal of admiration, not to mention enjoyment in yours truly. The youngster Martin, played by Connor Paolo, is likewise handled with great expertise and manages to invoke sympathy rather than annoyance (as so many child- and teenage characters seem to do) and furthermore plays wonderful alongside the reticent Mister, instilling in him a vague sense of compassion and humanity.
The rest of the characters are well-defined and inspire empathy and even though their efforts aren't always the greatest, they mostly work in the context of the scenes they are present in. Particularly impressive is Kelly McGillis (who is far removed from her image as a 80s sexpot) as the anonymous nun who come to function as a sort of surrogate mother for Martin, and also Danielle Harris as a young barmaid with a crippling component, growing inside of her.
The film's main antagonists, the vampires, are all brutal growling undomesticated beasts as far removed from the velvet draped, sickly romanticized counterpart as humanly possible (and all the better for it, I might add).
Director Jim Mickle and producer Larry Fessenden have managed to achieve an incredible effective vision of a world gone up in flames on a relatively minuscule budget (rumored to be around $4 million) and technically the film shines high above most of its genre equivalents. The cinematography by Ryan Samul, shot on the very popular Red One camera, places great importance on capturing the environments and the terrific works of the art department in particular, and both are brilliantly executed.
This is wide-screen cinema at its finest which begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Furthermore it has to be said that the decision to shoot in the economically dejected environment of Pottstown, Pennsylvania aids the production team immensely in capturing an area that positively reeks of poverty and despair, a location that don't seem to need that much in the way of set dressing, to pull off that all pervasive air of the post-apocalyptic landscape. From abandoned corrosive railways to industrialized coal towns, this film accomplishes the look and feel of a society that's crumbling away, which expertly amplifies the film's, admittedly less than subtle subtext concerning America's, and the world's for that matter, ostensibly downfall, with reverberations of financial ruin and religious fanaticism banging away in the background. And as a fellow left-winger I can help but punch the air, when sampling a genre film which has the balls to amalgamate its story with social and/or political conscience/agendas.
Lastly I want to place great emphasis on the beautiful score by Jeff Grace as it truly is one of the very best I've ever heard in regards to establishing mood and overall ambiance.

With great emphasis on the importance of three dimensional characters and the necessity and value of atmosphere to go along with the depiction of the landscapes they travel through, the film, very skillfully manages to accomplish that rare quality of making the viewer connect and therefore care for the outcome of the story and the faith of its characters.
If I were to nitpick I'd say that the voice-over can get a little banal at times and the revelation regarding the identity of the final foe is both disappointing and contradictory to the established narrative (a shame, since it is very well set up).
But a few minor flaws can't diminish from what is arguably an absolutely flawlessly executed film, which fortunately insist on taking itself serious and doesn't pander to the one-liner craving horror-comedy crowd (more please). Ultimately Stake Land is as tense and brutal a film, as it is a humanistic and moving one, yes, this reviewer felt the tears pressing as the end credits started to roll. A rare example of a vampire movie that doesn't suck (pun intended).

Reviewed here is the region free Blu-ray from Metrodome, released in the UK. The feature is presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen and the quality of the image is absolutely flawless, which is also the case regarding the disc's DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack - truly a demo-disc to be sure.
As for the extras, you get a whole helluva lot, starting with two very entertaining and informative audio commentary tracks. The first with Jim Mickle, Nick Damici, Connor Paolo, Larry Fessenden, and Brent Kunkle, and the second with Jim Mickle, Peter Phok, Adam Falk, Ryan Samul, Graham Reznick, and Jeff Grace.
`Going for the Throat: The Making of Stake Land' is next and as the title insinuates, it's an hour long Making-of that presents an overwhelming amount of behind-the-scenes footage, spiced up by interviews with the director, producer, and stars. It's a fantastic watch for fans of the film and for people interested in the filmmaking process.
Then there are the director's pre-production diaries where we get even more behind-the-scenes material, broken into sections of Pre-production, Storyboards, Visual FX, Post-production, the Toronto Film Festival premiere and Q&A. The entire thing clocks in at around 50 minutes and is well worth seeing.
Then there's a featurette entitled `WFX Breakdown' (3 minutes) which shows you the specifics pertaining to the digital effects. Lastly you get seven short films, or webisodes, that explore the backgrounds of several of the main characters and the film's theatrical trailer. This constitutes a fantastic package for a truly wonderful film.",1435449600,2,8904,5.093086926762491

The movie itself has a nice creepy apocalyptic feel to it that fans of these movies will like. Good gore and gruesome kills abound. We find in this movie that even during the worst of times, you can still trade a bag of zompire teeth to gain entrance into a little hick town full of gun-toting beer bellies. While there, you can get yourself a warm beer, the boy a haircut and a little something-something on the side. 'Murica! Amazingly enough, there IS a story to this thing and it makes for an enjoyable watch.  Though barely recognizable from her Top Gun days, Kelly McGillis is in this movie as a nun on the run from a couple of rapists who belong to a ""religious cult"" (imagine that)  Like most of these movies, the group is trying to find their way to that magical, mystical place up north where somehow this crap hasn't hit yet. You'd think these folks would have seen enough of these types of movies by now for someone in the group to say, ""Uh...that's not really gonna happen, guys.""

4521230,4,B0051CSIL0,"Among other things, this is a brilliant use of a zombie/vampire/whatever-they-are movie to draw a contrast of Christianity vs. Christianity, as it were.  One one hand, we have the ""bad guy"" Christians (i.e. the Brotherhood).  On the other hand, we have our heroes and their merry band, who act in -- given the circumstances -- an admirably merciful, Christian manner.  They help a nun, who travels with them for a time before sacrificing her life to save the rest of the group by drawing the zombies away from them.  Oh yeah, consider that whole business with statues of Jesus and Mary in the scene immediately preceding.  And then their putative guide, El Seor -- err ... I mean Mister (which amounts to the same title, anglicized; they don't called Jesus ""El Don"" in Spanish, after all), gets sort of crucified -- although it is interesting to see that this, and much misfortune for our group of heroes, arises from Mister's one instance of descending from act of justice to an act of vengeance.  Did I mention that Mister is taking them to a place called ""New Eden"".  And then he mysteriously disappears leaving his duly instructed follower.  I'm not suggesting a one-to-one allegory by any means.  But ""Mister's"" story certainly follows the tradition of the Christ figure -- or, if you prefer -- a Moses figure.

Um.
Well, apparently it's a very flat zombie apocalypse movie only with vampires, and you have to keep reminding yourself, ""Oh, right, these are not zombies. Yawn. They're vampires.""
Along the way, we get a very pretty narrative about growing up and what it is that's worth salvaging of our humanity. Apparently, it's good old country living. Fiddle playin'. Coffee and a slice of pie. That sort of thing. It's actually a very thoughtful movie, and had a lot to say on the subject of religion especially, but I was too bored to get the message. The real problem is that the movie is dead serious, with emphasis on ""dead"". The emotional range is limited, humor is in dire short supply. And I'm afraid it comes with the territory. The almost universal takeaway lesson from apocalypse movies of all stripes is that the first casualty is the personality. These are not engaging people. For a refreshing exception to this rule, check out The Battery! It's a far better movie about a lot of the same stuff.",1404345600,,1183,4.719806763285024

4521248,4,B0051CSIL0,"The movie is made for a niche group of viewers.  But it was made very well for that niche.  Nothing done seemed impossible, we weren't dealing with supermen, or bat men, just men... save for the notion of the bad guys.  But, that IS the niche.  There was some character development, but in a dreary movie, attachments are a risk.  I believe they played a reasonable balance considering the risk and setting.  And the risks are realized.

Special effects aren't poor, and are limited to what seems to actually work.  I'm not into soundtracks, don't remember one from a single movie that I can recall right off hand.  Throwbacks to silent movies, I suppose.

The whole fit and finish of this movie was exactly right.  Sort of along the lines of a Mad Max, but without as much drama.  Coffee versus tea?  Perhaps.  If I hadn't been so busy, I might have watched it again, would have watched it again, while under rent.  I might well purchase it, as movie for rainy days or guests with a minor sweet tooth for something different.  I'd have no problems watching it again.  It didn't insult my limited intelligence or, mostly, sense of things.

Always quotas, some leftist revision of right and left, and typical but slight mischaracterizations, but other than that it worked.  It's about as good as the film industry as a whole can do.

There's no rhyme or reason plotwise of why ""Christian crazies"" were dropping vamps as weapons, but yeah, whoever wrote this screenplay seems to have something against Christians. It wasn't ""Muslim crazies, Jewish crazies, Atheist crazies, etc.  If the writers had chosen one of those three I might have been impressed.  Alas, they took the modern easy route.

Martin, a young boy, is taken under the wing of a vampire hunter, Mister, after his family is viciously slaughtered. The pair are heading North towards New Eden, but find vampires aren't the only predators out there...

I enjoy the story in Stake Land. It starts off immediately in the post-apocalyptic world. Martin and Mister are heading North, which is supposed to be safe; they avoid the graveyard-like large cities and use the back roads. However, the vampires aren't the worst thing out in the wild... the living humans can be just as vicious as the undead, if not more. Along the way, they find small cities with survivors trying to get by, they find crazies in the woods, they connect with people like them, and they kill many vampires. It's a survival-apocalyptic blend, and I genuinely enjoy it.

The acting is great from the entire cast. There are a few lines of dialogue that felt cheesy and unnatural, but only a few. The story feels like a realistic vampire survival guide, and it keeps this vibe throughout. There is one scene that hurt the realism in the film, and it was a showdown-like scene that felt clich. The entire atmosphere of the film is bleak, dark and immersive; the story itself is also very bleak as death is around every corner and no one is exempt, including children. It's moderately paced, although it can feel slow at times. The special effects and makeup are great, I really liked the design of the vampires.

Overall, I really enjoyed Stake Land; it's an immersive post-apocalyptic horror film that manages to entertain immensely. As of 5/11/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, a purchase is highly recommended for fans of the genre, a rental otherwise.

4521274,4,B0051CSIL0,"The secret of any good apocalyptic film is about making a global event feel like a personal one.  In the case of ""Stake Land,"" it's about what each character has to lose.

At stake for Mister (Nick Damici) is the survival of his young ward, Martin (Connor Paolo). At stake for Belle (Danielle Harris) is the birth of her child in a hostile world.  At stake for Jebedia Loven (Michael Cerveris) is his fanatical faith, a position diametrically posed to the kind-hearted nun Sister (Kelly McGillis).  Everyone has something to lose in a world roiled by a vampire plague, where rapists, murderers, and human apathy are as much a threat as the blood-sucking hordes.

And so Mister and Martin make their way, collecting vampire fangs as currency, with Mister teaching his apprentice how to effectively kill the monsters.  They work best as a pair, but Mister has his own personal code that causes him to immediately murder two rapists -- which will have serious repercussions later.

What ""Stake Land"" does best is not focus on the vampires (basically, sun-fearing zombies), but on the ragtag family that forms around Mister and Martin.  As each survivor slowly succumbs to the cruel world, Mister begins to consider what his goals really are.  New Eden, a place that may or may not exist, comes to represent that future.  In a world chock full of vampires, when can a vampire hunter truly be at peace?

Mister's evolution: as protector, as guardian, and finally as parent, leaves him with only one answer.  To ""Stake Land's"" credit, it doesn't give us neatly wrapped endings but instead leaves us with hope.  In the end, all Mister can trust in is that the next generation will learn from the mistakes of the past -- the hope of every weary adult that ever looks upon our current state of affairs in despair.",1367193600,3,1804,4.743589743589744

4521284,4,B0051CSIL0,"The world has been ravished by despair after a deadly plague has transformed most of the population into bloodthirsty vampires. Martin and his mentor, Mister, set off through dangerous territory in the hopes of reaching the safe haven known as New Eden, but in order to do so, they will have to fight their way through hordes of the undead, let alone an army of crazed religious fanatics that have embraced ""God's wrath."" Nick Damici and Jim Mickle follow up their vastly underrated feature debut, MULBERRY STREET, with another powerful post-apocalyptic vision of hell starring Damici as the mysterious vampire slayer, ""Mister."" The scope of the picture feels all-encompassing, transforming the entire world into an undead nightmare on a relatively small-scale. Damici creates an excellent new anti-hero in Mister, with his brash behavior and uncaring attitude amounting to a memorable performance overall. Connor Paolo comes as a much bigger surprise, however, as Mister's argil apprentice, Martin. His sincerity and vulnerability are what draw us in to their unfortunate predicament as they race for survival. With the human element already in place, we turn to the unbridled terror of Mickle's vampires. The creatures function on a level of base instinct, and attack with the ferocity of an untamed animal. This makes for many frighteningly intense moments as Mister and Martin find themselves in inescapable situations against overwhelming odds. STAKE LAND succeeds on almost every level, and is a refreshing change of pace for vampire fans.

4521285,4,B0051CSIL0,its the road meets zombie vampires its a really good movie that suprisingly didn't get more notice its dark and gritty and while the main character is a young guy you cheer for the older one cause it looks like he's been thru hell and he doesnt expect to be climbing out any time soon the story is provacative and while the one of the parts at the end i didn't understand at all (i'm not sayin anythin cause i hate when people do that to me with movies i've never see)andit seemed illogical to me but i liked it overall what i think it lacked was a more sound ending it was close just maybe not close enough and what most people don't know is creating an enjoyable satisfying ending is the hardest part i can say oh well it shoulda ended like this or they should have done that but write yourself a story and then show me the ending ill tell what it shoulda been,1359504000,3,862,4.136904761904762

""Stake Land"" plays like an apocalyptic Zombie film with Vampires instead. That being said, the Vampires in this film are but Zombies with Vampire physical traits, & even that is minimal, with no supernatural shape shifting abilities, though their make up is effectively feral in appearance. Their mental capacity is about Zombie level, though they have evolved in to two types of Vampires, with one stronger & harder to kill than the other. It appears they may be evolving more, which is an interesting idea, but it is a thin line to hang a whole film on. Now most of what I've wrote so far, really doesn't sound to interesting, or original, but this is only one aspect of the plot...

""Stake Land"" is a chameleon. Yes, it's an apocalyptic Zombie like, Vampire film, but it's also plays out like a western, especially a bounty hunter western. It is a road movie. It is a film that makes statements about how the human race will become fragmented, becoming just as much of a menace to it's self as the Vampires are, with fanatical religious groups, in this case extremist Christians, taking the appearance of Vampires as a sign of God's wrath, & feeding the non-believers to the Vampires as a sacrifice to God. It also taps into the male domination of women through religion, though it takes this premise to extremes, it is also conceivable that these things could & would happen with religious male extremists. So here's a little more fuel to the fire. Still, it's been done before, though...

The thing that makes ""Stake Land"" a great little film as opposed to a mediocre been there, done that film, is it's great acting, script, direction, & personal characters plot line interaction. Yes, this is an apocalyptic film, but seen at the very personal level of two characters, teenager ""Martin,"" whose family was destroyed by Vampires, & ""Mister,"" ( who reminds me of the Troll Hunter in ""Troll Hunter"") who saves his life & teaches him to be a Vampire hunter. There is a real relationship here, as ""Mister"" becomes a surrogate father figure to Martin, & as gruff & grizzled as Mister is, there are moments that shows his love of Martin, like a son. The two go on their journey meeting & helping other people, actually building strong relationships with these people, who are struggling against the Vampires & the religious extremists. These relationships are quite real, & touching. You get to know these characters. You get to care about these characters, & that is this film's saving grace, even though as preposterous a setting as Vampires taking over the world is, ""Stake Land"" remains a very human film, about human relationships, with all the love & hate that goes with human relationships. This makes ""Stake Land"" much deeper than most of it's sub-genre ilk. In a way, this makes ""Stake Land"" the Vampire equivalent to """"28 Days Later"" & ""28 Weeks Later."" It gives you people to care about as those films did. It is no where as groundbreaking as those films, but in the end, it's those little everyday relationships we have, that make life & this movie, worth while.",1357430400,3,3092,4.732838589981447
4521293,4,B0051CSIL0,"Stakeland is a grim low budget indie horror flick that manages to do the impossible. It actually makes vampires scary again. From the very first time you see one of the beasts on screen you know that these aren't the ""sexy, sparkly, elegant, or misunderstood"" vampires from most recent movies. These things are MONSTERS. Plain and simple. They have no super powers other than keen predatory senses and good old fashioned viciousness. They're ugly, deadly, and the scariest part is that they seem to be evolving.
The story follows a small band of travelers led by the Charles Bronson-esque ""Mister"". Mister is a seasoned vampire killer and is in the process of training a young orphaned boy in the deadly art of dispatching the vile bloodsuckers. Along the way the two hunters and their traveling companions begin to realize that in this post apocalyptic world full of real life monsters, it may be the remaining human beings that are  the real danger. Bandits, cannibals, and violent religious cults also stand in the way of their goal of traveling to the vampire free zone known as ""New Eden"". As the brave travelers get picked off one by one the tension builds to a final bloody showdown with a frighteningly intelligent new breed of vampire that Mister has never seen before.
This movie isn't going to be for everybody. It is very dark and very grim. If you are a true horror movie fan such as myself,however, it is a rare hidden gem. My one criticism with Stakeland is that pacing is a little uneven and the movie feels like it leaves you hanging a little at the end. Also, if you are looking to buy a copy of the film, save yourself a little money and just pick up the single disc version. The second disc doesn't really offer much other than some random behind the scenes footage and a few mini films about the characters that doesn't really reveal anything that you couldn't figure out from watching the movie itself.
Overall, this is a pretty solid indie horror flick that gives you some new ideas about vampires and what it might be like to live in a world overrun by them. I recommend giving it a view if only for the fact that it actually dares to break away from the trend of making vampires sexy and brooding and allows them to be legitimately scary again.",1356825600,3,2269,4.588669950738916
4521294,4,B0051CSIL0,"this movie laid down some great effects for such  a low budget flick. It managed to keep the gritty post vampire plague situation going well. Obviously it couldn't go into cities due to budget constrants but they cleverly made a point of saying that it was too dangerous to go into those areas anyway!. They stick to the backroads and fight plaguepires. I didn't think the movie should have called the cult group christians though. They were a group of right wing  nuts who kill people and such. THey don't act like real christians at all. They are a nasty cult like david koreshs looneys or the solar temple psychos etc. The acting is good and there's a small role for kelly migillis. She is much older now but she was the  beautiful star of the 1980's who was in top gun. This show however is a good one for it's budget in spite of the extra unneeded villians of the brotherhood. I can't imagine any group being organized that fast after such a disaster. It never happened that way in the past , and yes the world has basically collapsed and most people died a few times, like the end of the classical world or the end of the bronze age. It took centuries of recovery to gain larger areas of control. Anyways the movie is good low budget movie and it uses the natural senery to it's advantage. the blu ray has extra features and it is a very good one in clarity as this is a new movie.",1355961600,2,1387,4.306513409961686

4521299,4,B0051CSIL0,"Over the years, certain Horror/SciFi films have been dealing with pandemic viruses usually turning the human race into rabid beasts or the zombie living dead.  Now, Director Jim Mickle and writer/actor Nick Damici have updated author Richard Matheson's epic 'I AM LEGEND' by having pockets of people surviving against loathsome vampire hordes instead of one last survivor in 'STAKE LAND', a film combining the morbid atmosphere of Director John Hilcoat's 'THE ROAD'-2009 and the living nightmare of AMC's hit television series 'THE WALKING DEAD' and  utilizing the vampire mythos of Director David Slade's '30 DAYS OF NIGHT'-2007 but without the clannish euphemisms.  The theme focuses on an adolescent played brilliantly by Conner Paolo as we grow to maturity through his eyes as they experience the nightmare which unfolds.  Director Jim Mickle who also helmed the brilliant 'MULBERRY STREET'-2008 is aided by Producer Larry Fessenden who also appears as a bartender ; lead actor Nick Damici who also appeared in 'MULBERRY STREET' and who shares the writing honors on this one ; a ghoulishly evil performance by actor Michael Cerveris and a beautiful cameo by actress Kelly McGillis.  The atmosphere is beautifully stated by photographer Ryan Samul and the nightmare is abetted by a melancholic music score by Jeff Grace.  It may be a zombie movie with fangs but the film emerges as a pleasant surprise as an overwhelming sense of dread hangs over the proceedings.  I saw the Blu-Ray single disc version which has beautiful sound and a crystal 2.35 widescreen transfer but there is a limited edition two disc set also for those who want more special features. Its definitely one of the best Horror films of the last decade and comes highly recommended.",1354838400,,1754,5.133333333333334

It's a lot like zombie land, but that's not a bad thing. I enjoyed this film if for no other reason than it was exactly what I expected. A campy movie with some over arching messages about religious fundamentalism and how evil deeds transcend any human condition. It's a rare movie that gives different viewers each what they want.

4521304,4,B0051CSIL0,"I avoided this movie for quite a while mainly due to the title.  It's name conjured a campy and cheesy vampire flick, which there is nothing wrong with if you are in the mood for it.  This movie was far, far, from my expectations.  It was a wonderfully told and acted piece about a vampire apocalypse and a small band of survivors struggling to find a safe place.  It was bleak, gritty, and raw but didn't feel cheaply made at all.  It actually had a very AMC's Walking Dead feel to it.  There were no fancy and flashy special effects, just very decent makeup and gore.  It instead relied on good story telling and sucking the audience into the characters' plight.

My only real complaint is that the ending could have been done a bit better.  I wasn't really sure of the motivation behind what Mr. did and would like to have known what became of him.  Still this film rates very highly with me and I'd highly recommend you take a visit to Stake Land after which I'm sure it will rate highly with you too.",1353715200,,1005,4.32620320855615

4521308,3,B0051CSIL0,"No matter how you slice it (pun intended), there's nothing wrong with a good monster apocalypse. Since you've shown up here, you're probably following The Walking Dead in their zombified cruise through the southland, and have watched the 28 Days and Months series.  Stake Land gives vampires equal time, in a worldwide cataclysm that brings down governments and makes life miserable for those who are still living and breathing humans. Filmed in a bleak Pennsylvania during the winter of 2009-2010, it follows young Martin and his badass mentor as they escape the ravages of some unexplained bloodsucker invasion. Along the way they run into all manner of ne'er-do-wells, and some try-to-do-gooders in the form of a woman-of-the-cloth, and a young pregnant survivor. Their ride is a hulking old 1969 Mercury Marquis, which can (and does) manage to make a pancake of anything in its path (Spoiler Alert: the Mercury does die, succumbing to battery problems. This forces out troupe to walk for awhile, which is a convenient plot device).

So far so good. The problem, as I see it, is that all of this just doesn't quite add up to the sum of its parts, much less more than that sum.  It's not so much that we've seen some of the plot devices before, it's that they are not used as effectively as they could be. For example, our coterie tunes into radio broadcasts as they cruise the barren countryside in their Merc. But unlike 28 Days Later, nothing comes of them, as if the voices on the radio were solely entertainment for a moment. The problem is not that the vamps resemble the tattered zombies from Walking Dead, but it's the blank slate regarding their origin that is never really explained. In 28 Days Later, we learn how the plague is spread from monster to human. Here, that's never made clear. How do humans get covered in vampire blood (as these characters do) and not get Turned Into One of Them? I suppose we need a good chomping bite. Yes, we saw those, but in those cases the humans died rather than being transformed into wandering evil beings.

The acting is adequate and occasionally rises above average, as with the pregnant Danielle Harris. Writer Nick Damici doubles as the acting badass who is showing Connor Paolo's young Martin the ropes, but never adds much depth to his characterization. Paolo is an enthusiastic young disciple, but aspects of his portrayal are pallid, including narration that has just a bit too much of a 'Jeremiah' folksiness to it (this was a short-lived series from the creators of Babylon 5, focusing on migrating post-apocalyptic humans, without the gore).

The Blu-ray disc impressively handles the dark tones of the film, and the two commentaries (one with actors, one with production and film techs) are a generous and informative bonus. Coming in with a separate Making Of and a Video Diary of the production, no one can accuse this package of being skimpy. It's just that I wish the main feature had a certain sparkle that made a more lasting impression. If by any chance you're a zombie apocalypse newbie, watch 28 Days Later instead, and consider starting on The Walking Dead series on AMC. If that's not enough world decimation for one year, you can check out Stake Land.",1352592000,,3227,4.796762589928058

But I HATE low budget, low talent, and unrealistic movies no matter what genre.

Once you have seen the first action scene in this film you have seen them all.

After the first character is introduced there is little to no more character development of anyone else.

I have no clue how they got gas for their car.

I have no clue how they got/made their wooden spikes or any of their other weapons.

I have no clue why ""Mister"" (stupid name) was always so serious and angry. I think he should have had a run-in with the Joker, ""Why so serious?"".

I have no clue why ""Mister"" always had to find a prostitute in every town they stopped by.

I have no clue why ""Mister"" had weed on his person (unless that was what he was smoking throughout the movie).

I have no clue why they had to dog on Christians so much.

I have no clue why they had to use BB guns (Crossman 660 was the first one I recognized) as props.

If you have seen Zombie Land or Book of Eli, you have seen this movie but with much better directing and acting.

This film would be perfectly at home being shown of the sci-fi channel along with the rest of their low budget thrillers, but does not stand a chance when compared with the above mentioned movies of late.

If you must watch it, then I would recommend renting.",1345766400,4,1366,4.251937984496124

I'm sure parts were cut but from what I saw this movie was so sad, especially when the pregnant girl was tortured & killed. Maybe it showed what it really would be like if something like that happened but I see enough horror on the news & watch a movie to get away from life. One person said it was like Zombieland & Dawn of the Dead. Have to disagree. Zombieland WAS a comedy, gross in some parts but funny with a good ending.

The story revolves around a teenage boy and a gruff man who has taken him under his wing after his parents are killed by vampires.  The man teaches the young boy to toughen up and adapt to a brutal new world.  He acts as a sort of father figure.  The two are traveling north to a town called New Eden which is supposedly free from vampires.  The road leading north is full of vampires running around but the bigger threat are bands of fascistic Christians who want to impose their will on all who come nearby.  They control large areas of what is left of the United States.  In many ways, they are scarier than the vampires.  The boy and older man help other people along the way and soon have their own ""family"" that is traveling to New Eden.  The ""family"" is short-lived as the vampires and Christians pick them off one by one.  Who will survive to reach New Eden?  The film has a very sad, and bleak tone.  The musical score does a great job of conveying the depression and sadness that the survivors feel.  This is no Hollywood film full of one vampire fight after another.  There is more heart behind this movie and it hurts.",1341964800,7,1301,4.411764705882353
4521332,4,B0051CSIL0,"This movie was a recommedation from a friend; who knows that i like the Twilight series (books are better, the movies/actors suck)... well i really love anything vampire related... so i searched high and low for it... Netflix only has it on Blueray, and bestbuy/local movie rental doesn't have it at all. my friend lended his copy to me.

I literally just gost finished watching it like 3 mins ago.
First of all, this movie is more of a Zombie movie then a vampire flick. but i love both genres so either way i was going to like this movie.
as you know, it follows the lives of a young man of about 15 years old, and a 30-40 something year old man who saves him when his family is attacked and killed; the boy's rescuer teaches him how to defend himself and kill vampires of which there are a few mutated versions (some have a thicker breast platelike rib cage and therefore are harder to kill, while others are the typical running around zombiesque like vampires that look like zombies but simply have fangs...) anyways they meet people and lose people (typical journey story line) come into contact with non vampire foes (if you  have READ the ""Walking Dead"" series (the T.V. show really hasn't touched base on that sort of stuff yet), then this movie closely resembles the actions and ""civilization"" of humans during the aftermath of a plague, especially reminding me of ""The Govenor"" in the middle to later books of ""The Walking Dead"".)

ok, so with all that said here are the things i enjoyed about the movie (followed with a list of my gripes):
I liked how realistic the characters are, the writing moves along slowly but is believable. The characters are told more through their actions rather then dialogue; which i really appreciated. the sound was incredible and made me jump sometimes more than actually seeing the monsters. the boy comes in contact with some girls around his age, and though you can tell that both parties are interested they don't don't make it sappy/mushy... in fact it was actually quiet nice to see how innocent and youthful they were around each other (considering that nowadays you see teens acting way beyond their years in movies, books, and TV shows)

it was nice to not have a twisted storyline, Hollywood tries too hard to wrap things up in a nice bow at the end, or toss in some plot twist, and though this one did have a tiny bit of that it really was more bearable. overall this was a great movie, which is good to wash the taste of the $10.00 i spent seeing that P.O.S movie ""Lincoln the Vampire Killer""...

but i digress...

onto my gripes:
1. the vampires were borderline funny-looking.  think ""sunken eye sockets with the use of dark face paint"" lots of dark makeup and fake blood, and torn clothes to hide the human-like qualities of the actors/vampires. i'm sure they blew their budget on the fangs you get at Halloween Express during the holiday, but well, the vampires looked more like the kind of ""Extras"" zombies you would see on a studio set in California... not to rip on the topic too much, but it really was one of my ONLY major complaints, so i have to spend a little more time on it...
2. the barter of goods, in this movie you will see bartering of goods like antibiotics for services and merchandise. although i really liked that they showed that in this movie. i did not like the currency level of some of the things... (and now i really am just nit-picking but hear me out) in one scene the old man takes the young boy to a make-shift doctor in a ravished yet semi-civilized town, the boy receives a check up and as payment the old man gives the doctor two bottles of prescription meds (I'm assuming antibiotics) but in another scene the old man barters 1 bottle of antibiotics, a bag of weed, and a couple of trophy kills (fangs) that he plucked off some Zombies... opps i mean vampires.. for, get this.... a bottle of alcohol!

really??? a bottle of antibiotics and a bag of weed? those two things would be harder to come by to a closed off town like that, even my husband commented on how that would have been enough to barter for a car (I'm thinking more like a room for the night) but you know.. whatever

3. The movie chugged along at a steady pace, and that was fine and all, but it someitmes left a lot of moments were the storyline just seemed to kind of falter and become dry.
4. (and finally) this won't be a surprise to you by now, but the zombie make-up... i mean -- ""Vampire"" -- Make-up, was lacking in creativity and seemed to bring the style of the movie down quite a bit..

aside from my pet peeves, which really didn't sway my intrigue for the movie much, i really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone searching for a plague/aftermath/zombie movie (I really can't say ""vampire"" movie because my conscious just can't lie to you guys like that...)",1341273600,2,4841,4.490909090909091
4521333,5,B0051CSIL0,"The vampires in stake land are different from most in that they are like wild or feral animals blinded by blood lust, the backstories on the survivors of this movie are interesting so it makes for an above average film.",1341273600,,219,4.5
4521334,4,B0051CSIL0,"I will start by disagreeing with the low raters of this film. It is not a sleeper, it does have a story, the acting is solid, special effects are as good as any multimillion dollar movie. The characters let you in just enough to relate to them. Although it is about vampires, it is more the lazy stupid vampires. A cross between a vampire and a zombie, on the other hand a vampire is nothing more than a zombie anyway right. Also too many younger viewers are addicted to CGI effects, the really good special effects films don't needs CGI, this is one of them.
 Doesn't matter anyway, the details of the spread vampire-ism are left low key, we've all seen enough vampire/zombie movies to figure those details, the story lies the the survival of this small group. Yes that kind of story has been told a few times, but as with any movie, the characters make the movie, and these characters do make the movie.
 There's a few pop up scares, enough blood for the gore lovers but not too much. You will see remnants of films like ""28 days later"", ""30 days of night"", ""I am Legend"", ""The Postman"", yes I said The Postman, just some hints of it, simply because The Postman id a movie that has heart & emotion for the characters as well as action, the country side landscapes and visiting town to town give the feeling of that one.
  I didn't rate this one 5 stars simply because I disliked the ending, Its not a bad ending, I just prefer a different way of concluding movies like this. Never the less, you will enjoy the movie.",1340323200,4,1518,4.372340425531915

The storyline resembles the Woody Harrelson-Jesse Eisenberg flick ZOMBIELAND, but this is no comedy. The story is told with the just right straight forwardness to be an acceptable piece of goey pulp goodness. This is the sort of horror film that George Romero or John Carpenter might have made in their best years.

Set in a post apocalyptic future, after vampires have taken over most of the world, and human, cannibals and scavengers compete for the rest. Focusing more on character and their story than just gore or violence. This is a cool low budget horror opus co-produced by Larry Fessenden, a sort of modern day Val Lewton. Getting some good performances from the likes of horror hottie Danielle Harris, 80's movie star Kelly McGillis, and a scene stealing, should be a star making performance from Nick Damici in the central bad a** role. Damici, who also co-wrote the screenplay with director Jim Mickle, makes me think of a cross between 70's action star Warren Oates and Fred Ward. The dialogue is at times a bit wobbly, and the narration is often pointless and pretentious. Still, this is a welcome return for a genre that in recent years has suffered quite a bit of diminishing returns. It's worth it.",1339632000,3,1313,4.8097345132743365
4521339,4,B0051CSIL0,"Very well shot and atmospheric. Beautiful cinematography, locations, and soundtrack. A little redundant and ultimately a bit anti-climatic, but the latter was to be expected considering the plot (i.e. vampires overran the earth, let's find shelter, this place won't hold up, let's take some people with us to the next place, repeat). The script also lacked depth at times, but overall an excellent viewing experience. A good mix of characters, many of which you actually become invested in, and solid acting all-around.

One thing I found particularly interesting was that the film moved by as if it were adapted from a video game. I could see an adaptation of Gears of War looking something like this, for example. Gorehounds won't be impressed by any means, but there was enough in the blood/violence department to keep a splatterfreak like me satiated.

I loved it.  Good camera work, good scenery, good acting and the movie flowed.
We have a vampire hunter called Mister who is teaching a teenage boy how to survive
in a world that has been over-run with vampires that are slow and stupid for the most part.
The sun kills them, stakes kill them, and the really bad ones have to be spiked in the brain.
The gore factor was high and realistic looking.  The pair are traveling to a place in Canada called
""New Eden"" where rumors tell of a settlement of survivors living well.  They pick up others on
their way to New Eden. Some really bad people called ""The Brotherhood"" have a large territory
our team has to drive through and survive.  These guys are worse than the vampires!
I am not going to spoil the movie for you.  If you like zombie movies, you will find that this
movie about vampire undead is a new twist on a vampire saga.  If you like the Twilight series, you
may find this movie disappointing because the vampires are stupid and savage.  Our hero team do
not have Buffy powers, either.  Enjoy!",1336780800,3,1135,4.345971563981043
4521348,2,B0051CSIL0,"Imagine ""I Am Legend"" being remade for roughly $50,000 and you have this movie's flavor. Zombie-esque vampire plague destroys most of America, leaving a few enclave towns (oddly) untouched and most of the nation a wasteland. ""Mister"" an alleged tough vampire killer wanders the ruined nation with his apprentice Martin, who is our narrator. The two eventually run afoul of a Christian cult that worships the vampires and much strife ensues.

This film is surprisingly good in some ways considering it is a low budget first time effort. The set design and cinematography set a nice bleak mood, suiting the theme. The action sequences are filmed pretty well. The special effects and gore all appear to be ""real"", i.e. no CGI. (Take note, George Romero, who uses little else but lame CGI in what passes for his recent zombie films...) The director does have some promise.

However, the plot is pretty non-existent and feels both episodic and sluggish. More importantly, the characters are extremely bland and its hard to care about even the leads. Mister is a single note sounded over and over again, Martin is as bland and dull as a post office clerk, and the other characters are even less interesting. The cult leader is about as threatening as a stuffed animal, and the entire Christian vamp cult thing gets too much screen time considering how uninteresting it is in both theory and execution. Someone obviously thought that was a way cool idea, but the viewer may disagree.

Some plot elements are fairly half-baked as well. The odd ability of the cult to track the heroes over long distances is not well explained. The existence of the enclave towns also is hard to explain as the vamps are supposedly unstoppable killing machines whom only trained hunters like Mister can deal with, yet a fairly large town seems to be very secure on the basis of a roadblock manned by yokels with shotguns. Just more evidence of a fairly undeveloped script.

I really wish there was more going on here with both plot and characters, as the existing mix does not mesh well with the directors technical skill. Hopefully next time, he'll be paired with a better script and actors. As it is the movie feels very long subjectively, as the utter lack of viewer engagement with the protagonists and their adventures pretty much ruins the fllm. Scariest thing in here is the Kelly McGillis cameo; what happened to her?

Eventually a pregnant Danielle Harris joins the group.

Vampire teeth have become the new currency. What we didn't find out what caused the infection or how it was spread.

I read the customer reviews on this movie but honestly, I guess because I'm stuck in that mindset that a vampire is supposed to look like all the others I've seen, I kept saying. .""Hmmmm I don't know.""  Then I went back again and read more customer reviews and I thought all these people  agree that this movie is great, they can't all be off the mark, so I took a chance and finally ordered it.  I got it Saturday and I watched it twice. .I even cried at a couple scenes the pregnant girl getting killed and the sister (nun). .. It wasn't what I expected at all and very different than most vampire movies you see, but it was awesome. So I want to thank all the folks that gave detailed customer reviews because I'm definitely on board now. . it was everything you said and more!",1330300800,,910,4.182857142857143
4521363,2,B0051CSIL0,"The only reason why I watched this film (to the end) was because I spent $3.99 and didn't want to waste my money. Even though, looking back on it now, I ended up wasting my time instead. It's not that it was a horrible film - the cinematography was good, the acting wasn't bad, and the scenery fit the essence of the film quite well - there were just too many things that bothered me about it.

Potential Spoilers:

For starters, ""Mister"" left a lot to be desired. The script was essentially written around this character - he was the one providing hope to a desperate people, he was coming against the Brotherhood - but I'm not quite sure if it was the casting or a poor development in the script that just seemed to throw everything off. For as much faith as they put into Mister, it seemed that he should've been this larger-than-life character. To me, he just wasn't ""that guy"" and when you're writing a script around a single character ... he really needs to be ""the guy."" That was probably the biggest upset for me.

But I could go on and go - how the main boy in the film didn't seem too upset that his parents were brutally eaten alive by vampires, that ""Mister"" killed his dad and he seemed to be OK with that, the pregnant girl's belly grew at a ridiculously rapid rate (the time just didn't seem to match), there was little practicality in the film (they stop and siphon gas out of other cars, they hunt for food, they look for clean water, etc, etc) - but I'll just end with saying that I really wanted to like this movie. There were a few parts that could've made it a great film, but it just seemed lacking in too many areas for me.",1329782400,3,1646,4.269230769230769
4521364,5,B0051CSIL0,"Stake Land review (DVD - no spoilers)

The world is overrun by vampires. The government has scattered and people are now living in small towns, kept safe by checkpoints and weapons. Religion has adapted, bending to fit the vampire into its lore. Everything is about survival in some way. Martin is traveling with a man who goes by the name of mister, trying to get to a place called New Eden, not overrun by vampires. along the way he learns about how to kill them and how to outsmart them and just what makes them tick. The road is a long and strange one.

I avoided this movie for a long time because I figured it for another of the new wave cheap flicks. I readily admit i was wrong. From the start you can see just how well the vampires fit in and just how intimidating they are from the way they sound to the way they move. Add in things like a story that grows and keeps you interested, the addition of new that pop in and out but do not feel generically added to the story, good acting, nice narration, believable fighting, and enough explanation to feel the world and the creatures in it and you have yourself something good.

something that impressed me  about Stake Land was the fact that it added a lot of elements in the way the story developed. Sometimes you would be seeing a vampire die or watching training. Other times you might be seeing how a town works or hearing the impact on the government. Nothing too long, but enough overview to make the experience more authentic. I like that. It kept the story going forward, but diverted it just enough to make it interesting.

I was also impressed by the acting a lot more than I would have thought. Conner Paolo I knew from the TV Show Revenge, but I never made as a good narrator or as  someone that could make killing a vampire look good. He was both. Nick Diamici offered a nice portrait of a vampire killer as well, straying from the policeman roles I normally see him play in series. Kelly McGillis and Danielle Harris added depth to their characters as well, and Micheal Cerveris make a memorable villain when he popped up.

considering the lack of horror these days, good horror anyhow, I felt Stake Land was a treat. a well deserved 5 star watch for me",1329436800,,2224,4.383495145631068
4521365,5,B0051CSIL0,"Terrific for a horror film. The characters are not deeply developed but I could relate to each and actually care about them. There is a strong feeling of sincerity and caring and talent to the making of this film. The photography and mood were great, and the feeling about and immersion in backroads America was convincing and even artsy. The script was well-written. The monster/vampires are truly ugly and nasty and predatory/animalistic.

The overall mood was extreme sadness about the death of America, the decay of civil society. It is about the take over by the self-decribed Christian crazies who actually encourage the vampires because they want to rule with their sick values in the post-apocalyptic world. They use the vampires as weapons and even dropped them on cities and Washington to hasten the apocalypse.

That was the theme really. There were symbols of America everywhere, flags and all and it was clear that the great idealistic dreams were gone, dead.

It was difficult to not make comparisons with the present decline of America that the know-nothings seem to actually crave and have been doing things to help along -- as they might say mobilizing and acting to ""retake it"" so that they can be free to pursue their self-righteous anger and hatreds -- somehow or another in their minds in the name of Jesus (The Prince of Peace!! -- OMG, they walk among us now!). I can't help but think this was intentional.

WHOA -- I am watching the extras as I type, and they just made it clear that they were indeed affected by our tragic times in the US. So this was a very brave film and will be quite disliked and put down by the hate mongers that have been so riled up these days if they catch the allusions.  I doubt though that the rebs are sufficiently self-reflective to see themselves as destructive hate mongers.

The film is certainly not anti-Christian even though the bad guys, over and above the vampires are some sort aryan self-proclaimed Christian network across the country that reminds one of a sort of violence-prone survivalist mentality/society network. So the film makers put in a nun to represent a more sincere model of Christian love and charity. I thought that was a little much at first, but it ended  up working okay. She loses some of her idealism in the course of dealing with the realities of the new order, but at least she has a conscience and does not overdo it.

The extra feature ""making-of"" is ""low density"" but somehow engaging if you are not in a rush. It is mostly just footage about working out of doors on the shooting and make up etc. It is nicely done and not  saturated by hype or goofing off scenes as so many extra features are. It is slow and not talking heads. And somehow it works, though again, I will warn that it takes its time. I think I enjoyed it for one thing because so much of it was outdoors in ""real weather"" which got worked into the film.  I really like extra features when they are well done and give you a feeling for being at the shoots and this one worked for me.",1329091200,4,3040,4.561467889908257

Don't get me wrong, I like zombies as much as the next guy, but now there are almost, dare I say it, to many zombie movie out there right now.
And what makes this movie really stand out is the acting, top notch! You care about the characters, they behave in a way that is what I think realistic under such circumstances.

It was kinda of an interesting new take on the whole vampire thing...a world overrun by vampires, which actually seemed more like a cross between vampires and zombies.  They sucked blood just like vampires, but they were a bit more of slightly brainless drones who overall were unable to speak...and the whole apocalyptic side of this movie also made me think zombie.  I guess you could just call them zombie vampires or something.  One of the antagonists in this movie was somehow able to speak after he became a zombie vampire...not sure what's up with that, but for the most part they could not speak.  They were more like wild animals hunting out their next pray.  I was a little preturbed about a baby and a pregnant woman that got ate, but I guess it's a bit more realistic in a way, because in a vampire/zombie apocalypse such as this, I doubt they would be choosy  about who they would go after, as long as they got their blood/brains.

Vampires are everywhere and the only thing worse than the creatures are the human scum buckets, taking advantage of a terrible crisis, raping and pillaging wherever they want, or the religious fanatics looking for someone to blame and punish.  Our little group of heroes just want to kill all the vampires they possibly can and try to make it safely to New Eden, the sanctuary they have heard of but aren't convinced isn't a myth.

Casting is good (I especially liked Kelly McGillis as Sister, Nick Damici as Mister, and Connor Paolo as Martin). Also, special effects were well done, not over-done.

4521377,5,B0051CSIL0,"Imagine 'The Road', but in addition to thieves, killers, and cannibals there are vicious zombie-like vampires and fanatical religious cults who feed people to them. That more or less sums up this film by Jim Mickle, writer/director who also made the impressive 'Mulberry St.'. I think 'Stake Land' is kind of a weak title and does not do justice to this terrific film, so I urge you not to pass it up because it sounds like a cheesy B movie. It is beautifully photographed and atmospheric. The script is sparse, with just enough dialog to keep the story moving forward, no more and no less. The performances are realistic and subtle. The fx are well-done and bloody as hell without being over the top. It looks like they only used makeup and latex, old-school FX, which earns extra points in my book. One thing I hate is the over use of CGI now. They even use it for bullet hits and blood splatter, and it looks terrible. This is artful and engaging storytelling that I don't see very often in horror films. I watch a lot of horror, most are mediocre to terrible, but it's the gems like 'Stake Land' or 'Trick 'r Treat' that come along once in a while and give me hope for the future of the genre. I give this a very high recommendation and don't know why on earth it didn't get picked up for theatrical distribution. The best horror movie of the year.",1322784000,,1352,4.433734939759036
4521378,5,B0051CSIL0,"Few things in the movies today please me more than genre busting flicks and this one rises quickly to the top of my favorite list.  Here we have undead creatures that combine the gruesomeness of zombies with the blood lust and physical prowess of vampires.

Given the grimness of our ecomony, an ever burgeoning distrust of our political leaders by a nation screwed over by greed and powerlust, Stake Land, with its almost biblical allegorical qualities is poised to strike a chord that may reach beyond only just horror audiences.

It's difficult not to draw comparisons with the television hit ""The Walking Dead"" as much as with Cormac McCarthy's The Road - and with a bit of his earlier ""Blood Meridian"" thrown in for good measure.

Through classic, linear lines the story is narrated through a series of voiceovers by its protagonist, Martin (Connor Paolo), a teenager who, as they prepare to escape and move north witnesses the brutal massacre of his entire family by the.  Saved by ""Mister"" (Nick Damici - who co-wrote the screenplay) the two take to the road in search of New Eden (Canada) holding on to a desperate hope that something resembling normality will be found across the border.  In short order, we watch as Martin learns to fight, and the script's well-written voiceovers (all from Martin's point of view) provide background, commentary (sometimes on the obvious) and are beautifully delivered by young Mr. Paolo.

In classic road movie (or Wizard of Oz) fashion, the pair expands into a trio (with Kelly McGillis), then quartet (Sean Nelson) and eventually a quintet (Danielle Harris) as they search for food and fend off vamps.  Along the way, survival becomes further compromised as we meet The Aryan Brotherhood - a group of religious wack jobs led by Jebedia Loven (Michael Cerveris, dripping with evil) who, in a strong nod toward the kooks who explained AIDS as God's vengeance on a world lacking their personal morality, have discovered creative ways to use the vamps to further their twisted mission.

The film is clearly not going to appeal to certain horror/vampire film fans, what with its unrelenting severity of tone, understated acting, and offbeat, original chamber music style score by Jeff Grace, but that's their loss as director, Jim Mickel, art directors  Michael Ahern and Beck Underwood along with cinematographer Ryan Samul have given us a horror flick that is at all times visually stunning and emotionally charged by an enormous heart and done this without skimping out on delicious amounts of blood and gore.

I love horror and I love vampire movies, but these  creatures looked like a cross between zombies and vampires.  I like movies with vampires that look like vampires, not ones that look like half-eaten undead.  And that touching music along with all that spewing blood and gore simply did not go together.

All this movie did that was positive was what it did for the producers, which was set up everything for a sequel.  Wish I could get back the time I wasted on this piece of trash.....",1322265600,2,696,4.425196850393701

I remember thinking ""Oh, god another really awful vampire movie."" Then, yesterday I was really tired from having a long day at work and wanted to watch a movie to just go brain-dead and relax to. Well, I was quite surprised at how well the movie was done, and how well the characters where fleshed out, that it not only kept me interested it also made me feel involved. Sure some of the make-up effects are a little low end, but most of the action happens quick enough that you don't really notice. The music score for me really set the atmosphere and matched well with the scenes' mood. The writers did a good job making you feel sympathy for the characters and for the most part everything felt ""Real"".

The movie would get a 5-star rating, but there are a few flaws that keep it from being great. I won't spoil anything, but there is a twist that sort of kills the ""realism"" towards the end, but it picks back up really quick and doesn't kill the overall movie experience. The pacing of the movie is generally good throughout, but at times it does drag or a scene will feel rushed, other than that it is pretty on point. It has a few cliches and at times you feel as though they are fighting some crazy zombie variant rather than vampires, but once again that doesn't really cripple the overall feel of the movie.

I love how pathetic producers and movies end up writing in the same stereotypical bad guy religious leaders as the main enemy, it's like they can't help themselves, they're almost like the zombie vampires they portray in their movies, unable to quench their own thirst.  The only reason I upgraded it to two stars, because they got me to watch it at least once.  It wasn't 100% bad, ""some"" decent parts in it.  However, not enough.

4521395,3,B0051CSIL0,"After reading the reviews and seeing that it got 3.5 stars, I was looking forward to this movie. Did I just miss the good parts? Yes, it was dark, violent, and bloody; that was the best part of the movie. People change their personalities, disappear, and act really stupid (actually, the stupid ones seem to survive). There's no explanation for the ""nightmare that has become America,"" no reason why ""New Eden"" (which turns out to be Canada) doesn't have the same problems, and no cause for the super-bad guy that leads to the only real tension in the movie. The people who die had no reason to, there's no reason for the survivors to live, there's no cause for the bad guys to be bad or the good guys to be good, there's no explanation of why the good guys' leaders are constantly smoking -- there's not even a description of how the people can carry small daypacks for ten days in the wilderness and end up with changes of clothing, parkas, tents, and food (let alone all the cigarettes the leader is smoking)could have done without the kids voiceover telling the audience whats pretty much immediately happening onscreen. It seems to end just because the production ran out of money; there's no real belief that the last ""good guys"" have actually made it to a safe area.

4521398,3,B0051CSIL0,"An unidentified plague has wiped out civilization - its victims are transformed into vicious, carnivorous animals who feast on the living.  No, not zombies - vampires, killed with a stake through the heart.  One man, a vampire hunter/killer known only as Mister, traverses the wrecked countryside with an apprentice, a teen boy the hunter took under his wing after the boy's family was slaughtered by the creatures.  Together, they and a few other stragglers try to reach Canada - 'New Eden' - while avoiding vampires and cultists who see the plague as the work of God.

This film has one specific flaw - otherwise this is actually an excellent, albeit gory, apocalyptic genre film.  Depending on how one feels about this flaw will probably determine - if one is already predisposed to like these kinds of films - how well they enjoy 'Stakeland'.  The problem is that it just takes itself too darn serious.

Martin, the boy apprentice, narrates portions of the story, and, similar to a Terrence Malick film, this narration doesn't always match up with the onscreen action.  The boy's voice, plus musical and visual cues, elicit a great deal of melacholy, and create a heightened sense of drama.  This has a much better chance of working in a film such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Days-of-Heaven/dp/079215455X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Days of Heaven</a>&nbsp;because it takes place in a world that is at least recognizable, if not familiar.  In 'Stake Land', this effort at emotional heft seems ridiculously overwrought.  I'm unable to fully let go and immerse myself in the story's fantastic elements, because the film keeps trolling for my sympathy, and by that very act disrupts my suspension of disbelief.

There's a very good chance that others will not feel this way about the film.  For those who can ignore this emotional ploy, or who don't notice it, or who can buy into it, I think the rest of the film works pretty well.  There were several unsurprising moments, but then there were also some that I didn't see coming - and, given the premise, much of the character's motivations and actions seem consitent.  Nick Damici, as the hunter Mister, is a bit too cool for school, but doubtless that will be more attractive rather than detrimental to a large portion of the audience for this film.

Overall, one significant flaw, which for me, seriously impinges on the film's rating.  Still worth a definite look by horror fans, especially those intrigued by the post-apocalypse genre.

A defect on the rental disc prevented me from watching the bonus materials included on the blu-ray.  Two commentaries are included; one with the director and principle actors; the other with the director and some of the technical crew.

4521399,5,B0051CSIL0,"A shock to the system.  An eclectic mix of genres, homages and nods, but Stake Land is still completely its own creation.  What makes it brilliant is that it is not just a film about survival in a ruined land, but that it is about keeping one's humanity alive in the face of such overwhelming brutality.

The taciturn nature of the film is in keeping with the Western genre and the road films from which it cleverly borrows.  Two Rode Together... The Searchers...Two Lane Blacktop... The Outlaw Josey Wales. A nice touch is that the boy's name is Martin --both a nod to Jeffery Hunter's character (Martin Pawley) in the Searchers and to Romero's film of the same name.

Damici's script is pared effectively and movingly down to the bone.  The direction is faultless.  Mickle actually crafts his frames, blocks his characters and moves his camera to create a real point of view, rather than to simply record his characters in an environment.  I cannot think of another $500,000 film with such an attention to detail in every department (art, music, props); another independent or studio picture (regardless of budget) which is so committed to the art of filmmaking, to getting it right, to balancing the interaction of sound and image; another film in the last decade that conveys such a Romantic understanding of life -- the strangeness in beauty, the beauty in horror; another film in which the Red camera was used so effectively or where one feels there is a truly gifted cinematographer behind the lens.  Ryan Samul really brings the film's natural and personal geography to life.  This kid is damn good.

And the performances contribute, of course, to all of the above.  Five minutes with Damici's Mister and we understand his unspoken backstory - the loss of his family, his loneliness, his mission, his promise to 'save' Martin.  Kelly M, in her depression era clothing and open heart is revelatory; Danielle H has never been better, never had a meatier role.  Cerveris's savagery walks a scary tightrope between convincing whispers and screams. Bonnie Dennison's confidence and unbridled hope in her few scenes at the tail of the film are beautiful as they energize the film's resolution. And Connor Paolo's Martin -- a really difficult role -- is perfectly measured, brilliantly judged, and emotionally played.  A virtually silent performance (on screen in  contrast to his narration), Paolo tells his tale through his eyes.  The brutality, threat, destruction and terror that he takes in -- he gives right back to us with amazing subtly and nuance.  You can actually watch this 14 year old orphan (terrified, impressionable, speaking only when spoken to) grow into a man in the course of the film's 90 minutes.  The character's arc is palpable.  And his quiet performance meshes so sympathetically with his narration -- a poetic diary that tracks these figures through the broken landscape -- that the combined contrast of innocence and insight is truly unique.

Finally, Damici and Mickle's choice to end on such a hopeful image -- powered by the single building yet unfinished note in Jeff Grace's score -- is exactly right.

Best American film of the year.",1315526400,,3168,4.937735849056604
4521400,2,B0051CSIL0,"Drat, I thought I had a winner here, it certainly opened strong enough with a doozy of a sequence involving an attack on a family, but after that........it fizzled into a lackluster road trip with an occasional flurry of action.

The issues I have with this movie complied themselves at an alarming rate as I watched its meager story play out.  First of all, the characters weren't fully developed, they remained ciphers throughout (and worse, unlikable).  Second, the `action' was simply that overused gimmick, ""hit and run.""  I could time when the next event was going to occur; it went like clockwork.  This type of repetition speaks of a lazy mind (in this case, 2 writers).  Also, too many lulls in a film purporting to be action/horror is a grave mistake.  These weren't helped by the taciturn drawl of the narrator, Martin (Connor Paolo), who droned his tale of woe throughout.  There was absolutely no attempt to sustain any horror element in this movie, not even basic tension.  Which is odd considering it's billed as a horror movie, a vampire movie at that.  You would think with material of that nature they would have no trouble building suspense, but no, they quickly tossed aside all the potentially exciting scenes, as if they were in the way of the boring road trip with an unemotional man and his boy sidekick.  I wish I could say they had a few surprises along the way but no, they didn't.  The so-called climatic sequence was one that could be seen coming hours earlier!  (I know it's only 98 minutes long but it felt like an eternity to me.)  If this sounds like I don't have anything to recommend, wait, it gets worse.  This movie also took on a decidedly anti-Christian point of view.  The level of bile directed at Christians went from ""crazy cult"" to ""Christian crazies,"" in the blink of an eye.  This movie even went so far as to place the `Christian menace' above that of the ""vamps.""  I haven't seen that much hatred onscreen since the last Stephen King screed: The Mist.  If insulting and alienating an entire group was the filmmaker's intend, then I'd have to say they succeeded.  But in their haste to vent they also made a very poor film.

3. when they were in the bus, why not only go to the bathroom in pairs (one guy gets killed going solo outside the bus)
4. they said Eden didn't have vamps but had cannibals - but the movie ends with them arriving at Eden so unless that's Part 2, they left out all of that.

4521404,5,B0051CSIL0,"This movie way surpasses the genre of Vampire/Zombie/Crazed Cannibals and incredibly over the top religeous zealots who also happen to occasionally be vampires, zombies and crazed cannibals type of film. This is a story showing how incredibly fast EVERYTHING will fall apart if our normal situations in life really go to hell and go there FAST.
The movie's hero is a hard man on the outside and has survived for being so. His absolute and full tilt, ""I'm not playing your game"" outlook is buffered by the same true humanity that makes him the survivor that he is. He saves the life of and raises and trains a boy knowing full well to avoid what has become of little enclaves of make-do civilization and seeking the one goal his mind is set on; reaching Eden. Eden is supposedly far enough north to have escaped the ravages of what has become of mankind and the entire movie is one long fight to get there by any and every means possible. And every means is pretty much covered in this great film!
We are talking about things getting so bad that pulled vampire fangs are used as barter for lifes necessities (and for some not so neccessary items that man tends to need anyway).
One reviewer mentioned that the acting is horrible. The reviewer had to either be watching something else or was kicked in the head by a horse as a child as EVERYONE pulls of their roles superlatively. The most evil of the evil, a cannibalistic ""preacher of the one true faith"", pulls off his role perfectly. ""Mister"", the hero of the story was perfectly cast. A man whose face mirrors the horrors he has seen and at the same time mirrors the hatred he holds for the ""things"" that most people have become and has developed only two goals, killing every ""Vamp"" he comes across and reaching the ever longed for goal of making it to ""Eden"".
Some might gripe that the religeous types are only shown as being incredibly evil and who knows, when things get so bad that all the politicians run away in fear after allowing for the fall of Washington, those that used to be the good just might be the first to go REALLY bad. The boy that is taken in by Mister plays his role quite well and semi narrates the story line. Despite being saved by Mister time after time the young man remains fairly innocent until he begins to truly grow up and see the world for what it has become. The still good looking Kelly McGillis plays a prominent role as a former Nun, rescued from true violation by our hero, the man known only by one name, Mister.
There is much more to this movie than just another horror film. It is full of action and satisfies the most blood thirsty of any audience member and certainly contains enough violence to rile up a stadium full of PTA members. The movie also has a decent amount of true humanity still in existance where with less hard men than Mister around, there wouldn't be.
Heck, the movie even has a Shane like ending (with the exception of Mister riding off into the sunrise unwounded). You KNOW he will survive! He seemed to have hung around the boy until he could see that the young man had grown up to be the combination of good and necessary evil that he had to be to survive...and even left him with a gorgeous babe that can cook and shoot a bow and arrow as well as one nice old high performance Chevrolet Pickup not far from, you guessed it, Eden.
This is one great movie that I have seen several times and enjoy it at least as much every time. If there is ever a reason to purchase a movie then this is one of those reasons. You will want to watch this again and again.
Thoroughly enjoyable in every respect, action packed and a horror buffs delight yet also one with a subtle message that good lies in the best of men and not in social gatherings and most certainly not in politicians and in this case MOST certainly not in the type of religeous zealots Mister and the boy and a few other good people picked up along the way come across.

4521407,4,B0051CSIL0,"The stylish 2010 independent horror film ""Stake Land"" is a variation of a lot of previous works, some better, quite a few not. It's a moody vision, dripping with overcast days and the corrosion of a dying world. The key to its success is attitude, and filmmakers play the game with a straight face. I love the atmosphere, as morose as anything seen in the bigger-budgeted&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road/dp/B001FB5634/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Road</a>.

Sometime in the not-too-distant future, the world is overcome by the obligatory virus rendering the dead into a form of vampire/zombies. They can only be killed by a stake through the heart. Rural teenager Martin (Connor Paolo) becomes an orphan in the opening scene, but he's saved by the mysterious stranger Mister (Nick Damici), a trench coat wearing warrior whose obsessive mission appears to be ridding the land of the undead. He adopts Martin as a protg and they travel cross country in a coughing Buick, taking down Nosferatus wherever they may roam. It's a fun set-up, aided by unshaven facades and worn clothes having seen better days. During their journey they encounter pockets of civilization, fortified compounds involved in trade, heavily guarded when the sun goes down.

Okay, the apocalyptic genre has been around in countless films including the recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zombieland/dp/B002WY65VU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zombieland</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JMA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)</a>, but ""Stake Land"" imagines a dying society unusually plausible. Cities are trashed and terrifyingly lawless. Mister has been there and done that, a fascinating character combining the attitude of Snake Plissken (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Escape-from-New-York/dp/B00004Y87O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Escape from New York</a>) with the athleticism of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade/dp/0780624890/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade</a>. I don't know if Damici is a great actor (this is the first time I've seen his work), but he fits this Eastwood-esque role like a worn leather glove. The youthful Paolo also displays excellent presence and together, they make a sympathetic team. They're on a quest of sorts and pick up several refugees along the way, including a former nun (a barely recognizable Kelly McGillis), a pregnant teenager (Danielle Harris) and a surviving hostage of a religious cult (Sean Nelson). Oh yes, the religious cult, adorned in military gear with shaved heads. They preach the Bible and dream dictatorship.

There's quite a bit of symbolism going on here as Mister leads the way through purgatory and militaristic zealotry, including a desolate hike along a mountain trail where it appears they're being tracked by an unknown menace. What I love about these segments is the vampires become secondary and character motivations are more crucial. This great survival dynamic, akin in many ways to the almost forgotten&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Dawn/dp/0792838041/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Dawn</a>, is ruined somewhat by an unnecessary final conflict. When the menace makes its appearance, following a series derivative scenes in the clichd abandoned warehouse, you'll say aloud, ""And you were doing so well!"" Anyway, the film rebounds nicely with an effective conclusion and it's telling I would actually enjoy a sequel.

Director Jim Mickle (who co-wrote the screenplay with Damici) has done a great job in creating atmosphere and detail. I have not seen his previous work&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mulberry-Street/dp/B0019RP6KC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mulberry Street</a>, evidently a similar horror excursion.

Don't ask me; I didn't write the movie.

Wow.  I'm really surprised at these glowing reviews.  I found ""Stake Land"" to be very amateurish (in both look and feel).  No character has any sort of depth to him/her.  Characters are introduced for the sole purpose of being later devoured by the vampires.  Of course, there was ""Mister,"" who was supposed to be Mr. Billy Bad A**, but looked like a poor man's Michael Masden sans acting ability.  Also, there were too many inconsistencies about the vampires--some were not affected at all by sunlight; others were.  The Vampire effects are pretty sub-par.  Where there could have been some kind of depth to the plot, the filmmakers opted instead for a child's game of ""tend-like"" and seemed to just make up the story as they went along.

Stakeland is a very visceral, realistic feeling movie that deals with more than simple genre scares and gore. The relationship between Mister and Martin is symbiotic and emotional although shielded.

It turned out to be cheaply produced for the usual obviously fake blood (raspberry jam), stakes (for vampires) in a multitude of forms, shotguns (for zombies) and trashy vehicles from a wrecking yard for ambience and, of course, the somewhat dead who always seem to walk the same way - like they're imitating some other primates.

This is especially true when you get into vampire type movies. This is a vampire movie that will take you by surprise. It has a good storyline, good acting, intelligence & emotion. It's your typical horror movie in the sense that there are vampires, they only come out at night, you must stake them to kill them, they want blood, have fangs, etc. The only difference is their appearance & the way they act is more zombie like. The movie starts out typical. Vampire plague has taken over, few survivors, no government and a teenage boy who is taken under the wing of a lone man who loves to kill vampires. They head North, to where they believe there are no vampires, the rest of the story is their journey together. There are various people introduced along the way, some good, some not.

4521419,4,B0051CSIL0,"This was a new one on me - zombies that are vampires, or maybe vampires that are zombies. Anyway, formerly human things that try to kill, and sometimes eat, every human around.  And they pretty much succeed, to the point that America has ceased to exist except as small enclaves of a few dozen or a few hundred people.

Enter the naive teenager who was picked up or maybe rescued by the zombie killer.  The real story is the killer training the teenager to survive in this brave, new world.  The classic mentor or tutor or father figure helping the youngster grow up and succeed.  Except that in this movie, to succeed is to survive another day. And to fail doesn't mean trying again, it means moving on to the next world.

But there are sub-stories along the way, intertwined.  And somehow it all works.  It really does.

Don't get me wrong, the movie is not family fare.  It is very bloody, with some of the killing being fairly graphic.  But they are, after all, only formerly human things trying to kill everyone.  No sex and no nudity, but lots of blood.

This movie is a great example of a low-budget film using relative unknown actors and pulling off something far greater than would be expected.  By the end of the movie you realize that you are really into it and never realized it.  It may not be a big-budget extravaganza but it is certainly worth your while to watch.

4521420,4,B0051CSIL0,"Now this is a vampire movie.  Stake Land is an effort from director Jim Mickle, who previously helmed a bleak and understated horror flick called Mulberry Street a few years back, which still ranks as probably the best film to ever come out carrying the After Dark Horrorfest banner.  With Stake Land, Mickle presents to us an apocalyptic wasteland that the vamps are terrorizing and feeding off of.  For teenager Martin (Connor Paolo), his means of survival are being accompanied by the mysterious Mister (Mulberry Street star Nick Damici) as they come across various other survivors (including Kelly McGillis and genre stalwart Danielle Harris) and an insane religious cult while attempting to make their way to the supposedly untouched land of New Eden.  Violent, scary, and unapologetically bleak; Stake Land is the kind of horror film that we don't see much of anymore, which in itself is a crying shame.  It pulls no punches and even when it offers a glimmer of hope, it seems so far away that you will be on the edge of your seat to see if our heroes make it or not.  While the film isn't without its flaws, most notably being that various characters appear and are introduced with little in the way of character development to boot, this is undoubtedly the best vampire film I've seen in quite some time.  All in all, give Stake Land a chance, there's a reason why there's been so much hype built around it for a while now, and you won't be disappointed with what you get here either.",1313107200,26,1492,4.67175572519084

Bleak, vampires, apocalypse, plague, gore, religious fanatics, and hope are pretty much the keywords that best describe Stake Land. I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't just another vampire gore fest. It focused more on the human interactions following the fall of society than anything and how a small group of humans that have little in common can work to together. There were plenty of religious images throughout the film. The vampires could have used better makeup rather than makeup that harkened back to the first Evil Dead movie.

4521423,4,B0051CSIL0,"<strong>Stake Land</strong> (Jim Mickle, 2010)

I discovered a simple, but effective, hypothesis back in 2001 that, for the most part, has held up over the past decade: any film that has Larry Fessenden's name on it somewhere is going to provide you with one heck of a good time. (I did have to add a codicil later on that adds the phrase ""as long as Ti West isn't involved"", as Fessenden had cameos in both <em>The Roost</em> and <em>Cabin Fever 2</em>.) It started with <em>Session 9</em>, where he had a small role in front of the camera, and <em>Wendigo</em>, which he directed, both of which were among the best of 2001. The came the silly, but fun, <em>Zombie Honeymoon</em>, which he produced, and I went back and saw <em>Animal Factory</em>, and there was <em>I Sell the Dead</em>, and... you get the idea. In the middle of all that was a little film that got picked up by After Dark Horrorfest. Normally that's an automatic fail, but for an After Dark movie, it was actually pretty decent, and showed some potential. It was another Fessenden production, with a guy I'd never heard of named Jim Mickle directing, written and starring a tough-looking, quite likable chap named Nick Damici. The movie was called <em>Mulberry St.</em>, and it ranks among the three or four best movies After Dark has ever released. It's not perfect by any means (viz. 30Mar2009 review), but it had all kinds of potential.

Fast-forward a few years, and the team of Mickle, Damici, and Fessenden reunite for <em>Stake Land</em>, this time put out by Dark Sky Films, who have been responsible for such excellent genre fare as <em>Deadgirl</em> and <em>Eskalofrio</em>. You're already guaranteed that at least someone, somewhere, thinks this movie is a whole lot better than <em>Mulberry St.</em>. The good news: they're right. I wrote the following in that <em>Mulberry St.</em> review: ""The other major problem the movie has is that there are so many places where the script starts to branch out into complex, interesting character development, so many stubs that tell us that given a little more time and another rewrite or so this movie would have given us a plethora of characters we could have come to care about. None of those stubs, however, ended up growing legs."" Mickle and Damici, who once again co-wrote, haven't completely fixed that problem, but they've gone about 90% of the way. The result is a much better, more affecting movie that still manages to pack in the solid action of their last outing.

Plot: Martin (<em>Gossip Girl</em>'s Connor Paolo) was a normal kid living in Pottstown, PA (nice little place, they used to have an excellent used bookstore, wonder if it's still there?), until they day he watched his parents and infant sister get slaughtered by a vampire. That night, he was saved by a guy known only as Mister (Damici), who we quickly learn is a vampire hunter. Fast-forward a few months, and the two of them are now mentor and apprentice, slowly travelling through the back roads of the American northeast, heading for New Eden (as Canada is called these days), a place where, supposedly, there are no vampires (though a starstruck shopkeeper warns them that rumor has it there's no food up there and folks have turned cannibal). As they're driving along, they gain and lose companions, and the first of these sets up the film's main conflict (no, it's not with the vampires): the boys are forced to slam on the brakes when a bloody, half-dressed nun (<em>Top Gun</em>'s Kelly McGillis, known only as ""Sister"" in the film) runs across the road, screaming for help, pursued by two guys in burlap bags. It comes on the heels of the cannibal warning, and so you may think that's what happening, but no, these are common rapists Mister puts out of the world's misery. Unfortunately, they also happen to be members of the Aryan Brotherhood, who have risen to fill the power vacuum left by the disintegration of the government under the aegis of Jebediah Loven (<em>Fringe</em>'s Michael Cerveris), who declare war on Mister and Martin, attacking and harrying them on their journey.

It's a good, solid little plot, and has worked well before. It also works well here. Note that those who tag the film as anti-Christian propaganda are missing the entire point (after all, Mister and Martin are traveling with, you know, a nun. The AB may identify as Christian in the movie, but anyone with half a brain sees right through that... don't they?); but we wouldn't be having this conversation if these were cardboard characters, and that's the real draw here. For the first ten or fifteen minutes, I wasn't overly impressed with the acting, but Paolo eventually grows into his role, and the rest of the cast is solid as can be (I didn't get a chance to mention Dianelle Harris, who appeared in both the original and rebooted Halloween franchises, or <em>The Wood</em>'s Sean Nelson, or small, but extremely effective, cameos for Fessenden and <em>Thicker than Water</em> beauty Eilis Cahill). This makes for some surprisingly tender moments in the second half of the film, a real unexpected pleasure.

But--as if I haven't already declaimed enough about why you should see this movie--one thing kept occurring to me that I haven't seen anyone mention, though I haven't read too many reviews about it. It seemed obvious to me that while the film is, for obvious reasons, being compared to other recent postapocalyptic horror films (both <em>Zombieland</em> and <em>The Road</em> have received mention in multiple reviews I've read), it seemed equally obvious to me that the movie was actually more influenced by westerns than by horror films. It's most in the forefront in the scene with Fessenden, who plays a pothead bartender in an out-of-the-way watering hole on the road. Seems like a pretty dangerous kind of thing to do in a world full of vampires, setting up shop outside a heavily-fortified town, right? Well, folks, welcome to the Old West... just substitute vampires and the occasional white power loony for rustlers and outlaws. It all makes perfect sense, and might answer some questions I've seen posed.

Also: a lot of criticism has been levelled at both the climax of the film and the final shot. Most of it is relatively valid; I think both are love-it-or-hate-it moments. I loved the climax and kinda hated the final shot, but only because it's one of those ""we're leaving it open for a possible sequel"" final shots that annoys me. (Though once again, detractors: if you assume a sequel, suddenly some of the ideas you were complaining about in the climax seem less like they're simply abandoned and more like setup for ideas the be explored in the sequel, yes?) These aren't the movie's only problems, though I can't really talk much about those without getting way into spoiler territory; I will have to leave off by saying that there are some emotional choices made by some of the movie's characters that seem, well, a little abrupt (and a lot out of character given the setup). But these are not reasons you shouldn't see this movie. There are no reason you shouldn't see this movie. Mickle and Damici have gone from ""a coupla kids with a dream and some potential"" to bona fide indie horror auteurs. That should be celebrated, and preferably on the big screen. *** ",1312761600,,7297,4.865647626709573
4521424,4,B0051CSIL0,The costume FX aren't all that good though; the vampires look like clowns turned meth-zombies.  But the storyline & action is entertaining.,1312761600,3,139,5.318181818181818
4521425,4,B0051CSIL0,"I like when a given genre starts to mature and the film makers explore the various possibilities available.

Here's the scoop. A plague has devastated Earth and people are turning into Vampire-Zombies. A young boy, Martin, has lost his parents. He hooks up with a ""hunter"" (of said creatures) called ""Mr."" and he learns the trade as they make their way north to ""New Eden"" in the hopes of a better life. Of course things don't go smoothly.

This has more in common with ""The Walking Dead"" than it does with ""Night of the Living Dead."" Though the attacks come with enough regularity to keep things from getting bogged down, it focuses more on how various people cope with the new state of things than it does with outright mayhem. The individuals, and groups of people, they come across all attempt to find their niche in the new world. When they're in the south, where religious fervor is at a peak, and many of the survivors view the plague as the hand of God punishing the wicked, things get real interesting. This actually comprises a large part of the plot throughout.  They also spend a fair amount time showing the man and boy developing their relationship (such as it is), so when the final scene comes, it all makes sense.

Though not an expensive movie, the budget was good enough to give it polished look. The camerawork and editing were smooth. The music was better than it had to be. The acting was also very good. I didn't recognize anyone save for Kelly McGillis. (nice to see her working) but no one stuck out as being less than professional. My only complaints (and these are minor) are that I didn't much care for the creature make-up and it did get a bit slow in parts.

This is a very thoughtful and mature entry into the genre. There is a good balance of mood, horror and social consciousness. If you're looking for a mindless bloodfest then don't bother. If you're looking to explore another level in the evolution of these kinds of films then have a great time.",1312761600,2,1983,4.543417366946779
4521426,4,B0051CSIL0,"Stake Land is the perfect example of a low budget movie that is amazingly superior to similar apocolyptic vampire films with high budgets (""Priest,"" ""Day Breakers,"" etc). Best compared as ""The Road"" meets ""30 Days of Night,"" it's a very intense film that grabs you early and does not let you go.

A teenage boy (maybe 15-16 years old) is rescued by a ""lone warrior"" from a vampire attack that leaves his entire family dead. The lone warrior (sort of a cross between Wesley Snipe's ""Blade"" with a badass Mickey Rourke attitude) teaches the boy how to fight and kill vampires as they travel up north to find the salvation city of ""New Eden."" They pick up a handful of fellow travellers along the way and they slowly become a ""family"" of sorts. These characters (particularly the ""lone warrior"") are stereotypical yet developed enough to not come across as cheesy or cliche. Not only do the travellers have to worry about vampires, as mankind may be even more dangerous: rapists, killers, psychos, and murderous religious fanatics- who are a combination of all these things.

As you can see, the plot is not overly original. However, what it lacks in originality it makes up for with other strong qualities: the acting is solid and the movie itself is bleak as hell. As the film goes on, the elements of helplessness and doom escalates with a terrifically sad violin music score. And it only gets bleaker as it goes on. No sexy teen vamps that sparkle in sunlight, here, folks. The vampires are refreshingly gross and creepy with rotting skin and animalistic behaviour. The scenes with the religious cult leader are frightening, making you wonder which is worse: vampires or mankind.

Even with its low budget, Stake Land runs circles around similar movies that have much higher budgets. The story is a very solid road movie (think of a very serious ""Zombieland"") that is bleak, dismal, and very well made. There is plenty of action in the movie, but its not overly gorey. There is more story than action, which is why this movie is elevated above your standard action fare: while there are horror elements in the movie, I'd classify it as a ""dark drama"" and not a ""horror"" movie.

PQ is actually very good (which I truley wasn't expecting). Colors don't pop off the screen and the blacks aren't entirely inky- there's some crush / noise in there- but overall a very pleasant looking film.

If you enjoy end of the world movies and/ or vampire movies, you should definitely check this movie out. There are admittedly a few scenes here and there where the low budgetness of the movie shows, but overall this is well worth watching. It also wouldn't hurt to have a lighter-hearted movie to pop in when this one ends: this is pretty bleak stuff, but a road worth travelling down.",1312761600,30,2773,4.709278350515464

4521429,5,B0051CSIL0,"Every once in a while you get a movie where the main antagonist isn't the most dangerous. That's the case with Stake Land, a vampire movie where the bloodsuckers are the obvious bad guys, but are by no means the most dangerous.
In Stake Land there has been an outbreak of vampirism, and humanity has been splintered into lone travelers and small communities. The communities operate on a barter system and rely on the travelers to bring in food, medicines, tools, and luxury items. And everyone waits for confirmation of the safe zone in the north, New Eden.

Mister (Nick Damici - Mulberry Street) is a loner who saves Martin (Connor Paolo - Gossip Girl) from the vampire attack that killed his parents. Instead of dropping Martin at one of the communities, Mister is training him to become a vampire hunter, one of the most respected and needed commodities on this frontier. Along the way they team up with pregnant waitress, Belle (Danielle Harris - Hatchet 2), war veteran Willie (Sean Nelson - The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3) and with a woman of the cloth, Sister (Kelly McGillis - Top Gun), who they have also saved from a couple of rapists from the Brotherhood.

The Brotherhood is an organization that uses radio broadcasts offering salvation and safety, then keeps women for recreation, as long as they are usable, robs travelers, recruits the willing and the unwilling become bait. One of their favorite ways to take over an enclave is by dropping captured vampires into community, waiting for the carnage to conclude, and enter the camp to loot and take prisoners. This pleasant group is led by Jebedia Loven (Michael Cerveris - Fringe), and he has taken a personal interest in the demise of Mister, for the killing of his son, one of the rapists. He continues to broadcast his propaganda, but has added a description and reward for Mister and Martin. If you didn't see that coming the next couple run-ins with each other will surprise you.

Stake Land is your classic good versus evil, with a refreshingly simple character development. The good guys are good, and the bad guys are bad. When Mister takes Martin under his wing, there is no doubt it's so Martin will be able to learn to take care of himself, and know that there are people that care about you. The same goes for Jebedia and his merry band. He has no compassion for others and will take care of himself at the expense of anyone who has what he wants. Another aspect of this movie that sets this apart from other post apocalypse is the authenticity of the settings. The abandoned buildings and stark landscape paints an odd picture of desperation and hope, hope that the buildings will someday be inhabited.

I'm not a Special Features sort of person, beyond deleted scenes, blooper reels, and the occasional commentary, but this movie has a feature I hadn't seen done with the finesse of this one. Stake Land has seven character prequels, though one is an origin short, which gives some sort of an insight to the main characters. Some of the prequels show events that lead up to the characters introduction in the movie, and some are an event that develops the character into what they became.

Stake Land is one of those movies that you could pick to pieces, but you just don't want to. If you kibitz the movie in any way, you would ruin the relationship you develop with the characters, so you accept what they do, in the places they do it. And you hope there really is a New Eden.

I think it is a good mixture of the two, which again is saying allot for an indie. I thought the acting was excellent overall. Nick Damici, Kelly McGillis, and Michael Cerveris were all strong, but I thought the part of Martin was portrayed as a little too naive and innocent for a modern day teenager. The real story here for me was the gritty and dark environments, along with the awesome vampire makeup and effects. I've seen much higher budget movies that don't come off this good.

8452534,4,B0051CSIL0,"Released in 2010 and directed by Jim Mickle from Nick Damicis script (co-written by Mickle), Stake Land is an adventure/horror movie about an orphaned boy, Martin (Connor Paolo), and a laconic, grizzled stranger called Mister (Damici) who teaches the kid how to be a vampire-killer as they team-up and journey through the post-apocalyptic landscape of Pennsylvania and New York on their way to a supposed haven in what used to be Canada. Kelly McGillis, Danielle Harris, Sean Nelson and Bonnie Dennison play people they run across in their travels while Michael Cerveris plays the leader of a whack job group of religious fundamentalists.

I like the melancholic and realistic tone with the corresponding forlorn score, which is superb slit-your-wrist type music. This is basically an adventure movie in a post-apocalyptic landscape (think The Postman), but with extreme horror/gore elements. The zombies are undead and therefore vampiric in nature coming out at night to suck the blood of the living. The vamps sorta take away from the gritty tone of the film because they're a little cartoony, but The Brotherhood are even more cartoony, particularly at the end when a former member turns vamp, but somehow retains his mental faculties. Why sure! However, I love the Northeast locations, shot in Pottstown, PA, and Middletown, NY.
