If only you could a voice track to hear the lyrics,
otherwise one of the best i've ever bought for learning,",1326067200,3,121,4.083333333333333
3910153,4,B002DGEGJ0,This DVD looks really good although it's a beyond my playing ability. Hopefully I'll be able to grow into it in a couple of years.,1289952000,3,130,4.24
3910154,5,B002DGEGJ0,I would given this a 9 out of 10. It gives several run throughs on each song and 2 views. It allows the player to run through the song several times.,1277596800,5,149,3.838709677419355
8365076,4,B002DGEGJ0,"Ive purchased 7 of these play along DVDs and the last four at same time so each is going to have the same review and rating. I had previously rated my first purchase five stars but after reviewing each DVD and agreeing with some other reviews I feel 4 stars is more appropriate. In my opinion Hal Leonard is the best when it comes to publication of Guitar learning and TAB song books for beginners and rare that Ill consider rating anything less than 4 Stars. My guitar status is beginner with approx 14 months of player experience so my review is from that perspective. In General some great songs are on the DVD but its unlikely anyone with less than 3 years of practice will be able to just start playing many of the songs on DVDs considered in this review. The intermediate, experience player will definitely be better served than the beginner. All Im sure will agree that it would have been very helpful if the DVD had included a PDF file of the displayed tab used during the instructional videos. Also a separate track of just the guitar without additional sounds would have been nice. What is demonstrated is done well but some terminology used goes beyond most beginners. I haven't considered returning any and hope that periodic revisits will eventually result in mastering some of these songs. After viewing these DVDs Ive acquired a higher appreciation for the artist that perform the songs and it blows me away to think maybe someday. Reasonably priced so if you're a beginner don't be afraid to give one a try.",1514332800,,1523,4.623616236162362

8365084,5,B002DGEGJ0,"A re-peat of the last L&M DVD I BOUGHT!

Great angles!  Very cool to show the picking hand separate and then the note selection separate, and then both together.

Its in note and tab form.  It as played slow to begin with (and for you to rewind over and over) and a play along at the end.  Love the Beatles...Love their songs....and Love, even more, being able to play them!!!!

Extremely well done.

Thank you!",1370822400,6,411,4.4
8365085,4,B002DGEGJ0,"Guitar riffs are exactly like the Beatles but I'm no George Harrison. It's a bit challenging for the beginner, but the instruction is there so with moderate talent the songs can be learned.",1365120000,3,189,4.757575757575758
