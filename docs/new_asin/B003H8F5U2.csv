It's funny how things like that can do that.",1488067200,,87,4.4375

8396891,1,B003H8F5U2,"I rented this movie from the Redbox down the street for my kids this weekend, and though my five year old liked it enough to want to watch it again (actually, he barely watched it, just sort of played around with the TV as a base to come back to now and then), I have to say that it is the worst movie I've ever seen--and that's a moniker I don't wield lightly.  Animation: graceless, indescript and horrible.  Writing: a deplorably plotless mishmash.  Characters: voids composed of blank, dunderheaded pixels.  Dialogue: stupid, cliched, and at times impossible to follow.  I echo too that some of the action scenes--all of which are sensless and jumbled--are grotesque and bordering on downright inappropriate.  You know when you see a low budget movie and its so tastelee that you aren't sure whether you want to trust it to not make you feel disturbed or disgusted?  Well, this movie gives me that feeling.  I hate it when I get through a movie and feel that I just squandered and hour or two of my time here on Earth.  It makes me feel guilty and depressed.  That's this disaster in a nutshell.",1298851200,4,1099,4.561224489795919
