8227573,5,B000XA5JV2,"This ""living-room"" set is a gem.  Paul Geremia, for the uninitiated, is a master of the six and twelve strings gutiar, with a repetoire that ranges from old country blues and rags to contemporary folk.  Paul's never played with a band or plugged in.  He's a show unto himself,  a stubborn survivor of the Great Folk Scare. Here are 17 performances, up close and personal, along with Paul's stories (he's a great raconteur) about his influences and encounters with the likes of Ramblin' Jack Elliot & Howlin' Wolf.  The camera work is good, so guitar geeks can get some insights.  The rest can sit back and enjoy a master of traditional music at work.

ps Get it while you can.  Paul's not in good health and does not have a lot of resources.  Give the man a hand and pick a CD to go with this set.",1387756800,3,797,4.36734693877551
8227574,5,B000XA5JV2,"I loved this DVD performance and story telling. I had heard Paul play a couple of times in settings where there was too much noise from the crowd, and I wanted to be able to hear his playing and singing without distractions and be able to see what he was doing on guitar. I'm a fan of all kinds of blues, and I play a little too, so I thought this DVD was close to perfect.",1376956800,,373,3.9210526315789473
8227575,4,B000XA5JV2,"This dvd offers a good overview of Paul Geremia's musical influences
and history- with an interspersed interview and many live performances
from his vast repertoire. He showcases his mastery of blues guitar with
many engaging selections. The audio and video quality are superb.
The dvd would appeal to both his diehard fans and devotees of blues guitar
masters.",1227657600,2,361,5.241379310344827
8227576,4,B000XA5JV2,"Paul Geremia is a true master of pre-war blues on six- and 12-string guitar.  Paul doesn't just play the Blues, he lives and has lived them.  Since taking up the guitar in college (learning from players he accompanied on harmonica) Paul has made his living playing pre-war Blues for more than four decades.  He paid his dues and is the real deal.

Paul has an uncanny knack for accurately preserving traditional Piedmont and Texas style Blues while adding his own touches honed through years of playing night after night.  It is clear watching Paul play that, when he cares to, he can play the tune exactly like the original recording.  The embellishments he adds are always tasteful and a perfect fit for the tune.  Above all, Paul's playing and singing is emotionally genuine.  That's the mark of an honest-to-God bluesman.

This is not a traditional instructional video.  Unlike most tutorial DVDs, Paul does not break down the songs and walk the viewer through isolated techniques step by step.  There are no split screen views of the left and right hands and though he does demonstrate a little this should not be thought of as a ""how to play the blues"" video.

That said, the video was produced by Stephan Grossman's Guitar Workshop and they are experts at filming guitar players.  The camera work is visually interesting (even for non-players) and, unlike on-stage performance videos, the lighting is perfect.  This video is more like a master class with well-lit closeups of left and right hands.  It's like sitting in the front row for a performance that can be stopped, rewound, and repeated.  Experienced players familiar with the style will get a lot from watching Paul play.

Between songs Paul reminisces about playing and learning to play and many of the players he has met, learned from, and worked with over the years.  Paul's commentary centers around playing guitar---for example, he discusses how Leadbelly and Blind Willie McTell tuned down their 12-string guitars---but he isn't so technical that less experienced or non-players will lose interest.

Paul performs both traditional and original songs including Tootie Blues, Rising River Blues, Cat Man Blues, Kill It Kid Rag, Statesboro Blues, Stocking Feet Blues, Leaving Blues, Silver City Bound, Death Don't Have No Mercy, Meet Me In The Bottom, Pony Blues, Scrapper's Scraps, Wonderful Affliction, My Kind of Place, Kicking In The Country, Still Thinking About You, and Little Silver Airplane.  Running time is about 100 minutes.

Guitar Artistry of Paul Geremia is one of those rare guitar videos that is interesting for both guitar players and non-players who are fans of traditional Blues and fingerstyle guitar.  It is a close-up look at the playing of one of the best alive.  Paul generously passes what he has learned over a lifetime to the next generation of players.  This video is recommended if you want to see and learn from the real deal.",1218499200,8,2926,4.973251028806584
