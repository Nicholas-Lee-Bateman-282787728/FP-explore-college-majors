7822154,3,6302169623,I use this solely for the first 20-minute toning workout. Then I switch over to her Timesaver Cardio workouts and do the 1st of two 20-minute cardio workouts for a total of 40 minutes. The toning is awesome.,1464739200,,207,4.473684210526316
7822155,5,6302169623,I love this video.  I have been working out with it for many years now off and on.  I especially love the cardio part.  It is easy enough to do and gives me a good workout.  It is just long enough to keep me exercising and perfect for me to fit in before going to work in the morning.,1374969600,,284,3.76271186440678
7822156,5,6302169623,This is an older tape I used about 12 years ago. I lost the original one so I was pleased to find this. She has a great 20 minute toning segment on the tape that I love. And I will state that I am not a fan of exercise! So I am pretty happy with Kathy's Instant Workout. I have also used the stretching segment and enjoyed it.,1349654400,,326,3.8088235294117645

7822159,5,6302169623,"I bought this tape in 1994 and have used it off and on ever since. The routines are easy to follow and yet never boring. Each section, toning, cardio and stretching, is quick, yet effective. The ""class"" is cheerful and fun to watch. Perfect for beginners and the time-challenged.",987724800,5,279,4.714285714285714
7822160,4,6302169623,"I have really enjoyed Kathy Smith's tapes. This one is included in my collection and I have to say it is an instant work-out! The toning tape is a good challenge and gives pretty good results. The aerobic portion is fun,  kinda zany and doesn't get to boring. There are a few traditional moves,  like the grapevine with other funky ones added in, like the ""running  man"". It also allows for some freedom in sections that you are bound  to enjoy. The stretching portion leaves you feeling relaxed and free. Each  section is made up of its own individual 20 minute mini workout. Different  music and settings help alleviate boredom. All in all, I would suggest you  add it to your collection, especially for the price. Great if you are on  the go and have minimal time in your busy schedule to get in shape. Also  good if you feel like taking a long work out with lots of variation.",919296000,19,880,4.45
