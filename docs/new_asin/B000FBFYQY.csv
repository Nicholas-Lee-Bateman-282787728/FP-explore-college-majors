8120094,5,B000FBFYQY,"This is a brilliant pairing of a relatively unknown Carson and a very well known Cody.  (However, two separate stories are told.  Their lives do not merge in the narrative.)

Carson earned the recognition.  He lived an extraordinary life long before anyone thought about building a transcontinental railroad.  Few men can claim to have ""opened"" the West and to have commanded troops in the Civil War.  The nice remarks about Fremont are also appreciated.  Today, he is often remembered for his weak record in the Civil War, but prior to that he was the nation's pre-eminent explorer and the Republican Party's first serious presidential candidate.

Cody's life really cannot be handled in an hour, but this DVD touches all the bases.  I wish a little more had been devoted to his marriage.  In any event, buy a good book on Cody -- there are several -- and make your way to the Cody Museum in Cody, Wyoming, as soon as you can.  You will remember it the rest of your life.",1234051200,5,972,4.625730994152047
