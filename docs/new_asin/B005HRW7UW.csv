4703227,3,B005HRW7UW,"Someone bet a friend they couldn't cobble together a random assortment of farm footage they had interspersed with a bunch of public domain stock music into a movie on Amazon. The friend won. Like Don King says: ""Only in America!""

That being said, it transfixed my 1-year old for about 15 minutes, which was all I needed it for. So I'll probably be watching it again.",1373760000,5,367,4.5606060606060606
4703228,3,B005HRW7UW,"I got this movie for my 6 year old, and she does enjoy it, because she loves horses, but it is really just a montage of farm animals, very little talking and no story line.  It might be more enjoyable for younger children.",1360195200,2,222,4.162790697674419
4703229,5,B005HRW7UW,Pony Play Date is a great film for the young ones. This movie will keep the kiddies entertained for hours on end. Packed with extras and special features the kids will love. Safe for all ages.,1315699200,,192,4.361111111111111
4703230,2,B005HRW7UW,Children were bored.  I agreed.,1414627200,,31,5.2
4703231,1,B005HRW7UW,I have made better home movies on my phone-I'm not kidding !,1406678400,,60,4.083333333333333
4703232,1,B005HRW7UW,Terrible! ! Bad quality just plain dumb. Have to write more don't waste time watching boring bad movie please.  Thanks,1399161600,,118,4.9
4703233,1,B005HRW7UW,Pony play day's even the title sounds cheesy. I recommend this movie to no one . All to is I some strange farm footage that seems like a two week old were it . It is absolutely tolerable and I wish that I  could give it a lower review.,1391385600,,235,3.795918367346939
4703234,2,B005HRW7UW,My son loves horses so I thought he would like this movie but it kept his attention for 10 mins.,1391299200,,96,3.85
4703235,2,B005HRW7UW,"Let me start off with saying I don't have children.  I was set with the task of watching a three year old and decided stream a video on the computer instead of torturing my spouse in the TV room.  (Honey, just saying, but you owe me...)  Kid on my lap, I was all set to stream some ""My Little Pony""  Kid wanted to see ponies, so okay.  Yay!  Cartoons!  No.  She pointed to this.  Okay fine.  So I set it to streaming.  And then my eyes, ears, and other head-holes started to bleed.  It was nothing but poorly strung together clips of farm animals on someone's suburban hobby farm with a loud terrible music track that overpowered the minimal narration.  It was not good.  The farm wasn't even particularly nice.  I know this because we live on a farm.  No beautiful barns or bucolic pastures, but there are several background shots of a mid-sized sedan.  About five minutes into this treacle I was ready to take the kid out and saddle up the pony out in the barn.  Except it was dark.  And raining.  And cold.  The animals on the video were not exceptionally pretty.  Even the three year old noticed that the pony out in the barn was cuter than the one in the video.  And I quote, ""<Squeee!> Is PONY!  Like Pumpkin.  Dat pony not as cyoot as Pumpkin.""  That's right sweetie, it's not.  To be fair, she seemed to enjoy the video.  We clapped during the montage of ducks, and I obligingly quacked.  She liked that.  We called out all the names of the farm animals.  So I gave it two stars, because if I could set the kid in front of it, and myself be in the next county, it probably has some value.  So, if you enjoy a voyeuristic look into someone's backyard barnyard with bad dubbed over synthesizer music and the production value of a 1990's 7th grade film project, then this might be for you.  Otherwise, I leave you with the wise words of Fran Lebowitz - Do not, on a rainy day, ask your child what he feels like doing, because I assure you that what he feels like doing, you won't feel like watching.",1390953600,13,2004,4.28686327077748
4703236,1,B005HRW7UW,rated one star for poor quality all around. Would  not recommend to anyone of any age. will not watch again.,1382140800,,108,4.4
4703237,5,B005HRW7UW,This movie is perfect for young kids and parents needing a hour of quite time. My 3 year old loves the movie and sits entertained the entire time. Older kids may not enjoy.,1375574400,,172,4.242424242424242
4703238,2,B005HRW7UW,"This video consists of someone with a hand held video camera following a bunch of different animals around; horses, ducks, goats, pigs, etc.  There is some lighthearted narrative that goes along with the video, but the animals aren't really interacting with each other or playing (and there is no 'mischief' or 'adventures' as indicated on the video case).....and there is absolutely no story line.  The location is REALLY run down and littered with trash and feces.  You think they would have chosen a better location and cleaned the animals up a bit.  I actually felt sorry for them.
This is a great concept and we have watched movies like 'Puppy Party' which was much better. We rented the Pony Play Date movie from our library and I would not suggest someone ever actually purchase this movie.
My 4 and 6 year old girls thought it was ok, but were a bit disappointed in the lack of horses shown on the video and lack of story line.  (Think of someone going to a State Fair and videotaping the animals running around a bit and in their pens....not too exciting.)  Sorry JKK Jones Films, but instead of doing it all yourself, you should hire professionals to shoot and direct your movies.",1375574400,,1190,4.669856459330144
4703239,1,B005HRW7UW,As amazon prime members we were able to watch this for free.  Very happy I didn't pay for it since the quality was TERRIBLE. Just random farm footage set to music.  You can find a million videos like it on youtube. Very little talking and terrible special effects.,1373846400,3,264,4.479166666666667
8473520,1,B005HRW7UW,Awful!,1504915200,,6,6.0
8473521,3,B005HRW7UW,"Yeah it's cheesy and it's got just some basic footage with coarse copy and paste work and the voice actress is a pretty hard to swallow; it's cheap with amateur workmanship, but toddlers also don't demand Spielberg.
We live in the country so, of course, my 2 year old loves farm animals and while he'll come and go during the show (as he does with all movies, so that's not particularly telling) and isn't at all interested in the narration, he enjoys pointing out the animals, making their sounds, and watching a few seconds of their antics. It just sort of ""is what it is"": toddler background entertainment. Works well for first thing in the morning when we're getting coffee and breakfast going before we head outside for the day. Lots of other things work too and this is by no means his favourite but it's worth a go if your tiny ones love farm animals. He actually thinks the super cheesy ""rewind scenes"" are funny so... it works.",1499126400,,936,4.544378698224852
8473522,1,B005HRW7UW,Terrible. I don't even know how this made it to Amazon. My kids loved it but they are the easiest crowd as long as it involves horses. It was terrible filming and they didn't even clean up the horses or the background at all. I lived on a farm and this was just painful to watch. One horse was old or emaciated but I wouldn't have filmed it at all.,1478390400,,348,3.9857142857142858
8473523,1,B005HRW7UW,"Sweet Jesus this was just awful. I'm pretty sure it was made with an old vhs camcorder uploaded to Windows Movie Maker and axded in some free midi music and sound effects. The person filming has Parkinson's disease. All the ""voice overs"" were done by the same person in the same tone.

Just watch this to get a laugh of how bad it is. There are youtube videos with higher production quality.",1464134400,,391,4.430555555555555
8473524,1,B005HRW7UW,My 2yo lost interest quickly - very slow and uninteresting. Camera was wobbly at times too.,1462752000,,91,4.75
8473525,1,B005HRW7UW,"Out of focus, unbelievably bad camera work.  Yikes, my three year old begged me to turn it off, and she likes some pretty bad stuff!",1461110400,,132,4.28

8473528,2,B005HRW7UW,"Go drunk pony, you're home.

After a lot of thought that's all the review I can come up with. This is not like Pet Party, which is the clear implication.",1450310400,,153,4.1
8473529,1,B005HRW7UW,It is a quite bite simple.,1430265600,,26,3.5
