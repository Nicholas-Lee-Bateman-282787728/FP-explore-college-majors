My kids (boy and girl around 10 years old) love watching these shows. The don't get all the references, but they love the comedy and the spy angle.

We can laugh together at how stupid the hippies were and the moronic fashions of the 60s and 70s. We discuss how the ""peace and love"" subculture did essentially nothing to keep people safe, while the ""suits"" in CONTROL saved lives and defended freedom. A good lesson applicable to today.",1362528000,,492,4.64367816091954

8402020,5,B003PK28FM,"Get Smart has been one of my favorite television shows since I was a kid. As a kid, the fun for me was the antics of comic genius Don Adams. As an adult , half of shows fun is trying to catch all the references to the spy movies and television shows that Get Smart brilliantly satirizes. The other half is still the antics of Don Adams.

Video: The remastering done on Get Smart is incredible. The show is presented in its original full frame 1:33 ratio and looks fantastic. The episodes look clean and bright. The colors are vivid and really pop. It really is a revelation after watching drab washed out prints on television for years.

Audio: The only audio track on this set is English 2.0 stereo. It is clear sounding and I have no complaints

Subtitles: There are no subtitles on the set but it is close-captioned in English only.

Extras: All 52 episodes feature an audio introduction from Barbara Feldon.

Season Three: There is a commentary track by Barbara Feldon and Buck Henry on 99 Loses Control and a commentary track by Don Rickles on The Little Black Book, Part 2.

Season Four: There is a commentary track by Barbara Feldon and Buck Henry on With Love and Twitches and a commentary track by James Caan on To Sire, With Love, Part 2.",1428278400,,4046,4.516438356164383
