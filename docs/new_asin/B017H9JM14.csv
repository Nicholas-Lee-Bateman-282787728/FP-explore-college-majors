7505105,5,B017H9JM14,"We're DD fans & really enjoyed this DVD as well!  They added some fluff to the DVD by adding Phil & Kay's wedding vow renewal to this one.  I would have preferred to have had the DVD be a bit cheaper & not have P&K wedding on it too since we already own all of the series, but it is what it is.  Great show, fun watching the kids grow up, & wholesome entertainment for our family of all ages.",1455753600,4,392,3.875
7505106,5,B017H9JM14,"Awesome!!! This is such a wonderful set - includes John Luke and Mary Kate's wedding special as well as Phil and Miss Kaye's wedding special where they renewed their vows when their kids decided to surprise them with a wedding as an anniversary gift. So wonderful to see, funny and heartwarming - so sweet - just filled with love and laughter and tears of joy! If you are a fan, I'm sure you will love this set!",1455408000,,411,4.35064935064935
