8373525,4,6305111766,"Beautiful images of Paris. Beautiful program, but the sound is awful. Probably the tunel like stage in which the wind go through and the Champ de Mars to wide. Pavarotti does not seem at ease at all, for an hour. He is a sound fanatic as we know. His interpretation of Granada is a flop. Worth the buy?...Yes. You will have to ajust your sound system. Refer to CD edition for titles of the songs.",1129075200,4,396,4.293333333333333
