2525170,3,B000EO9OGS,"The movie was ok, here are some key points:
-Topless nudity throughout the movie
-Beautiful attire, makeup and hair styling
-Fun soundtrack that skips around from voodoo, jazz and piano bar music
-Good narration
-Film doesn't do a very good job making it clear between reality and dream sequences until the very end of the movie
-Use of blurred camera effects to insinuate dream sequences gets annoying and leaves you questioning the movie plot until it's made more sense of at the very end
-Acting is ok, there are some comedic parts and interesting sets, plus a little character development but nothing spectacular

I would recommend this movie if you're bored or curious to watch a 70s movie.",1384214400,,695,4.889830508474576

2525172,3,B000EO9OGS,"Christine (Alisha Fontaine)is a country girl who moves to the city when her father dies and leaves her in debt. She manages to find employment as a topless dancer. Attempting to leave town she meets a gypsy woman who gives her a potion that cause her to believe she is working in a brothel about 100 years earlier. Here she meets the same people she already knows, but by different names. The older era is seen as a dream like state as the placed some Vaseline around the edges of the camera while filming most of the scenes.

The acting was B grade, as was the plot. This is a first feature drive-in movie film. What I didn't like was the narration during much of the film attempting to show off the lack of creative talent the writers possessed.

F-bomb, sex, nudity, girl/girl scene,",1341360000,,786,4.451388888888889

2525174,2,B000EO9OGS,"Ripe you thing avoids ""a fate worse than death"" in the present and the past. Low budget attempt to recreate New Orleans at the turn of the 20th century is slow and predictable. Don't waste your time.",1251676800,2,199,4.405405405405405
2525175,4,B000EO9OGS,"I saw this movie when it first came out, and revisiting it years later, I find it still holds up well.  Sure, it's not a masterpiece, but it features well-crafted costumes, settings and music from turn-of-the-century New Orleans and energetic performances from everyone involved.  It's really a fantasy involving a young contemporary female drifter (Alisha Fontaine) who finds herself transported back in time to a life in which she works at a brothel.  A hot-shot piano player (Davison), promoting a new type of music called ""jazz"" becomes her protector and romantic interest.  Corruption, rivalries and voodoo enter into the story as well.  All-in-all, it's a gritty, realistic look at life in New Orleans and in the modern era.  Fontaine does one of the most hilariously inept strip-tease auditions that I've ever seen depicted.  And there's even a surprise ending.  Apparently there is a version in which much of the ""fantasy"" portion of the film is presented through a vaseline-coated lens.  I'm reviewing the VHS version, in which the technique is used for only a few minutes.  I recommend checking out this version.",1241913600,5,1122,5.115384615384615
2525176,1,B000EO9OGS,"I was interested in this film since I went to high school with one of the actresses. It has poor production values and doesn't take itself very seriously. At the end the narrator asks you to drive home safely, a reference to drive in teathers, where this probably played. there are some topless scenes and the entire thing looks like it was filmed with vaseline smeared on the lense. It really isn't a very good film",1181520000,3,416,4.4868421052631575

2525184,2,B000EO9OGS,the only thing good about this movie is the cute blonde and her first dance is pretty funny. I guess for the times it was ok for some but I turned it off half way through. I thought Sybil Danning was in it and that's why I watched but she was not. his movie was lame,1443139200,2,266,3.767857142857143

8111919,2,B000EO9OGS,"Well, at least it started out well.

But by the time it degenerated into a pretend musical, I was ready to shut it off.  I didn't.  I kept waiting for it to redeem itself.  It didn't.

I think it tries to do too much, at the cost of plot development.  It tries to be an extended dream sequence, a coming-of-age, a part-time musical, a T&A flick, a mild thriller/mild horror flick, all set against the backdrop of a historical fiction.  It had promise, and would have been better if the writers/producers had picked a strand and had developed it.

I mean, seriously, the main villain (?) only appears in two scenes (a couple more if you count verbal references).  There is no setup to establish him as the villain and he just appears at the end.  But then again, since it is hard to tell whether the dream sequence is the actual story being told by the film, I may not know who the real villain is at all.  And then, at the very end, the narrator asserts that the story is ""true.""  So there are actually three possible stories that may be being told here, and I can't quite make out which one is the film that I am looking at.

There are a couple of historical references in the movie that are at least enjoyable as inside jokes.  Most Americans today will never see them.  Some who know the history of jazz and blues will be intrigued by them.  Insider's advice:  Even those who ""get"" the references probably won't actually enjoy the movie as a whole.",1526774400,,1451,4.354477611940299
8111920,4,B000EO9OGS,"Definitely an odd and quirky film, but I liked it.  Lots of scenes of the French Quarter, great jazz music and a touch of voodoo.  The film has a good pace and the direction and acting are all right.",1524009600,,199,4.076923076923077
8111921,4,B000EO9OGS,"A fun 1970's film with a rating of T&A3. Young, really pretty girls that have trouble keeping their tops on. Nothing pornographic at all just some light fun and nice visuals. Probably appeal to those who have affinity for the 70's era films. Unlikely anyone under 60 is going to appreciate it.",1523491200,,293,4.653846153846154
8111922,2,B000EO9OGS,"set during the time period when the Everleigh Sisters were active in Chicago, the film was degraded by blurred photography which didn't make sense as ""dream sequences"" imputed by other reviewers.  N'Orleans itself was and remains subject to the dictates of the ""parishes"" (not counties) established by the thieving rapacious antihetero Wholly Roman Umpire which was so irresponsible as to demand that humans from elsewhere bury the dead after their preachers ran away during and after Hurricane Katrina and the criminal thugs they had trained and impoverished were killing residents of N'Orleans and shooting at rescue missions sent in from outside the criminally blighted state.  Allusions to discriminations against ""blacks"" has since been inverted to absurd discriminations against pale skinned tourists, whether or not they existed at the turn of the 20th century.  That there ever was anything entertaining about that cesspool at the mouth of the Mississippi River seems doubtful and this film joins in that doubt.",1478476800,,1019,5.436708860759493
