8046392,5,B000795RAW,"This is the must have DVD for Def Leppard fan, causual to hardcore fans alike. This is an english release that is comparable to our Rock Of Ages DVD video collection. It features 10 more videos than the Rock of Ages version released here in the US. It also includes three alternative versions of videos on the disc, for a total of 32 videos. This is the collection to purchase if you want to save some money and get the most videos for the dollar. For the heavier fan, Remember to get the other 2 DVD collections Historia/in the round,in your face and Visualize/video archive. Historia has 2 videos not included on the collection (including the studio Pour some sugar on me and Rock, Rock videos) and in your face in the round is a live concert. Visualize/Video archive also include live and acoustic songs as well. Finally, the Rock of Ages release has the video ""no matter what"" on it, a us exclusive release for Rock of ages DVD and CD. In all, this is the most complete collection on One DVD, and is the best addition to the DVD music library for value and music quantity.
NOTE: I actually bought my DVD new from Amazon UK. There are bootlegs that are circulating out there of this collection, so beware, I know from the experience of purchasing one. Legit copies are a dual layer disc (7.11 gb)with symbol ""D"" in the upper corner of videos 8,22,23 to link to the alternative versions of the video by hitting enter(appear in play all mode only). The bootlegs do not have the bonus videos and are on a single layer disc (4.11 gb on the disc if looked at on computer). they look good quality on silver DVDs. Also, the cover print quality is less, the DVD paint is a lighter blue, the insert inside the disc is not their, and it did not include the slip cover case.",1152662400,,1766,4.4036697247706424

8046394,5,B000795RAW,"This is a great buy! Even though I miss some of the more earlier videos. For everybody knows that Def Leppard was the greatest band in the known world before the guitarist Steve Clarks death. Ever since that day Def Leppard has not been anything else but a pathetic 80:s band that try to live up to excpetetions without any succses.

However the DVD is awesome cause it begins with the best songs of Def Leppard. And then there are some great ballads and then there are some not that great ballads (like When Love and Hate collide).

Buy this!!!

Ps. All Songs that Mutt Lange has been involved with are master pieces!!!

Ps2. Tell Def Leppard to get a good Music Video Director because some of the videos (like 4 or 5 of them) are very bad!",1110326400,6,741,4.3478260869565215
8046395,5,B000795RAW,This 29 video set is well worth it being it's in 5.1 DD surround. Pour sugar video is live u.s version and contains crowd chanting in backgroundlike we heard it first on MTV. I personally rec-ommend it for def lep fanatics. Buyer beware- plays only on multi regional dvd players May or may not work on yours-ex played it on my sony and did not play but the Jvc & Denon played it okay. I hope I don't confuse you. Just give it a try. It even played on ntscinstead of pal.  BW,1107820800,6,474,4.096774193548387
8046396,5,B000795RAW,"I just bought this DVD Yesterday and it is defenitly the best Def Leppard video collection to the date, the sound quality is great, also it has hidden videos, like alternative versions of Armageddon it, Slang and an 8 minute version of the video When Love and hate collide. A total of 32 Leppard Videos. A must have to all Def Leppard Fans around the world.",1105056000,8,357,4.424242424242424
