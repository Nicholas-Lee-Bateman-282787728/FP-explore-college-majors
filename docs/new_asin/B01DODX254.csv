7719826,5,B01DODX254,"I was at this show!! The dvd doesn't do them justice but it still rocks. The dvd mix for ""gold"" is terrible....nothing like it was live.",1468368000,,136,4.269230769230769
7719827,5,B01DODX254,Love it. Didn't disappoint.  Watched this concert film in the cinema when it was released earlier this year.  Wanting to watch it again and glad I could do it again with the blu-ray.,1468108800,,182,4.484848484848484
7719828,5,B01DODX254,Attended this concert and the DVD does not disappoint! Great DVD and a GREAT band!,1467676800,,82,4.533333333333333
7719829,5,B01DODX254,"A bit on the ""pop"" side, but not so much that its bubble gum-y. 1080p transfer. Great sound and video. There is a lot of deep bass in their drums and synthesizers, so it really sounded great in my opinion. I was surprised that I knew more of their songs than I thought I did and the songs I did not know. Concert was very enjoyable.",1467590400,,332,4.045454545454546
7719830,5,B01DODX254,I love this!!! I could watch or listen to them every day!,1466121600,,57,3.8333333333333335
7719831,5,B01DODX254,"What is there not to like about Imagine Dragons. My husband and I went to this concert, but in Pittsburgh. The band carries the same vibe in this concert. I can't wait until they come back to town with a new album!",1465948800,4,214,4.119047619047619
7719832,5,B01DODX254,"Very good, defaulted to stereo when i started it but dolby atmos was available plus others.",1465776000,,91,4.75
7719833,5,B01DODX254,"This Review is for the BluRay/CD Combo (even though the DVD comes with the same feautres). Just to clear things up, the CD is the AUDIO version of the BLURAY. So YES, you get the LIVE CONCERT CD. Second, this is the ENTIRE SMOKE+MIRROS SHOW they recorded in Toronto, Canada. No skipped songs, no documentary type footage, just the concert. It's AMAZING! I got so many emotions watching it because I had the chance to see them live last July. Truly a MUST GET for any Dragonhead!",1465516800,9,478,4.505747126436781
7719834,5,B01DODX254,So one question is the CD they are giving me recorded from their live shows because if so then I want this ten times more. I already have their studio recorded one but if this a live version then sign me up.,1463788800,4,207,3.9523809523809526
7719835,4,B01DODX254,I WOULD GIVE THIS 10 STARS IF YOU WOULD TELL ME THAT RADIOACTIVE IS THE 6 PLUS MINUTE VERSION.,1463702400,,94,4.0
7719836,5,B01DODX254,Awesome DVD!!! Couldn't recommend it more for fans of the band!,1516147200,,63,4.818181818181818
7719837,5,B01DODX254,Super sound and picture,1514937600,,23,5.0
7719838,3,B01DODX254,"I thought the band sounded excellent and the lighting and effects makes me think that this would have been an unbelievable show to attend. I enjoy watching concert DVDs as I really think it enhances the experience over listening to the CD. Although when watching this production, I felt it was overproduced and overedited. Instead of having the feeling of being sucked into the concert and feeling like I was there, I more felt like I was watching a film displaying how great the video production company  was. Constantly jumping from one camera to the next, with occasional (slow-mo) shots sprinkled in (cheesey), watching the DVD actually lessened the concert experience rather than heightening it.

The Killers Live from the Royal Albert Hall is an example of a concert DVD that better enhanced the viewing experience.",1513987200,2,821,5.029411764705882
7719839,5,B01DODX254,Absolutely the best concert ever. If you aren't a fan of Imagine Dragons you will be. All the hits very excited to watch very happy with this purchase.,1512000000,,151,4.428571428571429
7719840,5,B01DODX254,"Great cd/dvd amazing band, Imagine dragons never fails to amaze me.",1511136000,,67,5.181818181818182
7719841,3,B01DODX254,"If you really like Smoke & Mirrors it's probably something you want to pick up but I really miss tunes like I Don't Know Why, yeah I know different album.  If your a huge fan then it's essential but it's kind of limited being just that one album. Sound is OK but I thought the bass was pushed up too high in the mix so surround (nice) but boomy.... visuals were OK.",1509667200,,365,4.069444444444445
7719842,5,B01DODX254,A great concert to watch. Nice how genuine and appreciative the band seemed to be towards their fans.,1505347200,,101,4.666666666666667

7719846,5,B01DODX254,"I saw this group live in Nashville on July 8th, 2015, literally just days after the show in the video. I saw the video on March 2nd, 2016, when it was given a one night only theatrical release. Imagine Dragons has done one of the best live shows I have ever seen, and they are my current favorite band. I am also totally delighted with the live album that is included, since I have been wanting a live album from them since I fell in love with their music.",1490572800,2,456,4.134831460674158

7719856,5,B01DODX254,"Wasn't really looking for a concert DVD, was looking for more of a ""best of..."" but I am glad I chose the combo (dvd + cd) because this group really needs to be seen to fully appreciate their music. Getting the concert gave me all of their most popular songs (so far) and more insight into their 'mode of operation' as well as their genuine concern for their fans. They are not your typical rock group, they think outside the 'rock' box and put on a great show. Love the CD, and the DVD. Looking forward to what they'll do next.",1471910400,7,528,4.237623762376238
7719857,5,B01DODX254,Definitely 5 Stars!,1471910400,,19,5.666666666666667
7719858,5,B01DODX254,"I would have loved a behind the scenes feature or interview with the band, but other than that little complaint I love this DVD. I have not listened to the CD yet, but Dan sounds great live so it will end up in the car eventually.

The sound is exceptional - I will often put this on for background music while I clean but often get distracted and end up watching my favorite songs lol!  The graphics and light show are among my favorites of all my concert DVDs. It can get a little dark at times, best to watch at night! I love that they were able to incorporate so many songs through use of medleys. Dan Reynolds interacts well with the audience, his voice stayed strong, and he shines during the more rock numbers. He's become a very good frontman and the guys sounded great as well. The crowd interacted but wasn't a distraction, plus I like that the cameras were focused on the band rather than flashing to the crowd. There was a good mix of wide shots, close ups, and showcased all of the guys not just Dan.

It seems like a fun and high energy concert to attend. If they ever came close to me, I would definitely attend based on this DVD.  Favorite tracks - I'm So Sorry, Gold, I Bet My Life, and Radioactive (love when they are ALL pounding away on the drums!)",1471478400,3,1268,4.24896265560166

7719860,5,B01DODX254,"I bought this CD/DVD for my wife who is a extreme Imagine Dragons fan. She has haunted me with this, she loves it, i have to listen to it playing on the TV and in the car. If you are a imagine dragons fan, this is completely worth it for you.",1468800000,3,242,3.764705882352941
7719861,2,B01DODX254,"Good production, poor music concert. I didn't like that the singer had the audience singing most of the hit songs. I want to hear the singer singing the songs, not the crowd. I can go to a bar and hear crowds mumbling words to songs.",1468627200,10,233,4.2
7719862,5,B01DODX254,went to this concert and this is almost as good as being there,1468627200,,62,3.8461538461538463
