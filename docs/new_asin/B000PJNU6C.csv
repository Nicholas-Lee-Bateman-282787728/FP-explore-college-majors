8191971,4,B000PJNU6C,"A RUN FOR YOUR MONEY is a slight comedy playing on stereotypes of Welshness. Brothers Dai (Donald Houston) and Twm (Meredith Edwards) come to London as winners of a competition worth 200 in prize-money and free tickets to the England v. Wales rugby union match. They manage to get separated and enjoy a series of picaresque adventures that involve them losing their money and missing the game. Everything ends happily, however, as they return tired but happy to their Welsh mining village on the rugby special train.

Charles Frend's film contains every possible stereotype of the Welsh you might think of - male voice choirs, mining, chapels, and families all possessing the same surname. Yet Clifford Evans's and Richard Hughes's script also accentuates the positive aspects of working class life - its emphasis on honesty, family stability and openness, as oppose to the crafty Londoners typified by Jo (Moira Lister) who befriends Dai in the hope of fleecing him of his prize-money.

The script sends up many of the class-prejudices dominating British society at that time: the snooty newspaper editor (Clive Morton) looks down on Dai for no apparent reason, while the patrons of the London pubs think of Twm and his compatriot Huw (Hugh Griffith) as nothing more than a pair of uncouth provincials. On the other hand everyone strives to be socially better than they actually are, an attitude typified by Mrs. Pargiter (Joyce Grenfell), a would-be high society shop-owner whose suburban vowels are clearly evident beneath her strangulated tones.

The script also manages to take side-swipes at bureaucratic attitudes blighting people's lives, from the tendency of shops to close at lunchtime on Saturdays (supposedly the busiest time of the week), to the officious guides at the Tower of London forcing visitors to travel one way round the jewel-festooned halls. As befits a studio dedicated to middle class mores, director Frend makes fun of National Coal Board, one of the quangoes created in 1946 as part of the Labour Government's nationalization program. Ostensibly created to improve people's lives, it still condemns most miners to the drudgery of long hours down the pit.

For social historians A RUN FOR YOUR MONEY also offers valuable glimpses of postwar London, with streets thronged with shabbily-dressed citizens, deserted tourist attractions, and cars and buses that had obviously seen better days. Yet the overall tone remains an optimistic one, attesting to people's abilities to remain cheerful even in adverse circumstances. This spirit is never better typified than in a scene taking place in a local cinema in Paddington, where the entire audience join in a chorus of ""All Through the Night"" performed in Welsh by Huw (on the harp) and Twm (on vocals). The spectators might not know their language, but they can join in the English refrain. Community singing is one of those rituals that transcends class and regional divisions and brings people together.",1470700800,,2979,5.174273858921162
8191972,5,B000PJNU6C,"A totally charming little film if you see it for what it is--a Welsh Fable! From the world's longest name for a village, which we see to begin with, to the final rendition of the Welsh song we know as ""All Through the Night,"" this movie is about what every Welshman wishes for. SPOILER. Two young Welshmen travel to London to get their prize money for shoveling more coal than anyone else. and get their three wishes instead. What does a Welshman want? A wife (symbolized by the ring), a friend, and music!",1464134400,,506,4.451612903225806

8191974,5,B000PJNU6C,"A lovely little film about two Welsh coalminers who go to London for a day to collect a prize. It will be entertaining and fun for those who like the comedy films from the UK after WWII. It will be even more entertaining for people who are acquainted with the Welsh people - their heritage, habits and language idiosyncracies. While not the main characters in the film, Alec Guinness and Hugh Griffith play important roles.",1375488000,7,423,4.653333333333333
8191975,4,B000PJNU6C,"A young, up-and-coming Alec Guiness plays the straight man in this frantic 1949 farce about two provincial Welsh coal miners who come to London to claim a prize in a contest sponsored by a big city newspaper.  Naturally, the thickly accented rubes fall afoul of all sort of urban sharps and con men, and Guiness, as their hapless minder, first ferries then chases them about the town, trying to avoid disaster.  The film is filled with the broadest stereotypes of Welshmen as cheerful, singing drunkards, lugging their leeks about and weeping sentimentally at the sound of a harp. As drama, this scarcely holds up, but the look at postwar London is fascinating, with glimpses of the Underground subway, the various tourist sites, the cars, and -- above all -- the fashions and sounds of a bygone era.  Guiness is only marginally used in this production -- ""Kind Hearts And Coronets,"" which came out the same year, is his true early tour-de-force.  Still, it's an enjoyable film, if you can get past the iffy sound quality (from the original recordings, methinks) and the manic performances.  Nice time capsule.",1178409600,11,1110,4.9144385026737964
