8285776,5,B001C433UW,"This DVD release from Europe, from Sweden I think, is described in the Amazon listing and also on the DVD cover itself as 'all region', but it is not.  It is in fact a region restricted, I presume Region 2 restricted, disc that will not play, for example, on a US OPPO region 1 player that can play all-region PAL format discs just fine.  It must be played on a player that can play out of region (other than region 1) restricted discs.  Bergman's film is remarkably good, I think, far better than some seem to give it credit for, and the transfer of the film is perfectly fine, but don't buy this disc here in the USA expecting to be able to play it on a US Oppo player or something other than a player that has been modified so that it than can play region 2 and other out-of-region-1 region restricted discs.",1406073600,4,811,4.253246753246753
