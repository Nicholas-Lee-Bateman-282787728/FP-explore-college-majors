8371051,3,B002INLTKW,"A night club singer witnesses a murder and is pursued by the Chicago mob. She flees to the West to hide. Gene Autry is a good singer, and there are some good action scenes. (Roy Rogers and the Sons of the Pioneers are the thieves in this film!) Smiley Burnette plays a harmonica, accordion, tambourine, and a xylophone (with his toes) while singing. Quite a feat. Some horse chases and trick horse riding, too. Gene doesnt even lose his hat during fight scenes. Hes good. If you have an interest in 30s westerns, this is a good example. Mildly interesting.",1468713600,,556,4.57
