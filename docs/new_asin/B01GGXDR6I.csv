Thanks!",1471910400,,19,5.333333333333333
7760233,5,B01GGXDR6I,"I absolutely love this set, but I admit that it isn't for everybody. Being a fan of the attitude era definitely helps, but I think older wrestling fans, maybe 30 and up, will appreciate the grittiness and the feelings that watching these matches evokes from memories of going to live events before the Monday Night Wars.

It consists mainly of matches recorded at house shows, with a few PPV dark matches thrown in. The PPV matches have the regular camera set up, but the house shows are shot from angles you're not used to, some with only a single handheld camera prowling the ring apron area.

The matches span from 1996-2000, with almost all of them taking place in the 96-97 range. You'll get a good dose of HBK, Steve Austin in the early stages of his Stone Cold era, The Undertaker, and Mankind/Cactus Jack. Every match featuring The Rock is from his days with the Nation of Domination.

Overall, a very fun and unique collection. I hope they do a follow up.",1471737600,,964,4.5606936416184976
7760234,4,B01GGXDR6I,Buy this collection if you are like me and grew up during the Attitude Era and feel that the current roster and programming leaves a whole lot to be desired.  Its been stated before about the audio issues as well as only one camera being used.  Just keep in mind that most matches are house/dark matches; overall worth the purchase.,1471564800,,332,4.516666666666667
7760235,3,B01GGXDR6I,The set has some good matches but whenever Corey Graves is talking it sounds like his audio constantly is dropping in and out? Anyone else notice this?,1471132800,2,151,4.62962962962963
7760236,3,B01GGXDR6I,"This is a pretty cool set of rare matches from one of the most beloved, but overhyped, eras in professional wrestling. Although this is a good set released by WWE, in my opinion it is a must buy only if you are a hardcore fan.

The main reason this set is for diehard fans only is the entire absence of commentary during these 8+ hours of matches. Only 1 match on this set has commentary. This is understood if you know what this set is before you purchase, as this collection is comprised entirely of dark matches that occurred before or after WWF Raw or PPVs and also includes non televised house show matches.

Another drawback of this set is the camerawork. Sometimes, as seen on the first match in this set, only a single handheld camera is used. This gives an interesting perspective compared to the multiple HD cameras of today, but it can get tedious and rather boring after watching the spectacle of videography I am used to in today's wrestling.

In conclusion, I would definitely not get this set for your child or any fan who is not a total hardcore wrestling nut. I consider myself a wrestling nut and I still think this set comes up short. It would have been awesome if WWE had dubbed some commentators for these matches, but what we get does have historic value and is better than nothing. 3/5 tombstone piledrivers

PS: This blu ray set comes in an awesome slipcover with a nice mini book of greatest matches. Nice work on the Packaging WWE!!",1470960000,13,1458,4.490566037735849

Overall: The Attitude Era DVD series continues on with this third set. Only this time, all the content featured on this set is never before seen matches from numerous live events and house shows all across the globe. There's little coverage from 2000 and 2001 from the Attitude Era as most matches covered on here take place between 1996 and 1999. With me having the WWE Network and having access to pretty much all televised Attitude Era content, I'm excited for this set that shows unseen matches. Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels, Undertaker, Sycho Sid, Stone Cold, DX, The Rock, Goldust, Nation of Domination and many others are a lot of the top stars during the early years of the Attitude Era that you can expect to find on this extravagant DVD set. Any fans of the Attitude Era are encouraged to go out and buy this set for your collection to view for the very first time never before seen action from quite possibly the greatest era in WWE.",1468454400,25,4145,4.865606936416185
7760238,5,B01GGXDR6I,"This set is absolutely amazing.  I can not say enough about how good this set is. Sure people are annoyed by the fact that there is no commentary,except for one match. But the action really speaks for itself.  The premise of the UNRELEASED matches makes this set awesome.  Definitely several hidden gems. WWE hit another home run.",1465603200,,330,4.754385964912281
7760239,4,B01GGXDR6I,Love the attitude era and was glad to have a volume 3 but honestly did not care for the dvd in the way the quality of the matches were and the camera angles could barely see some of the matches due to that but being how they were unreleased matches I suppose that is how it had to be,1489449600,,283,3.8135593220338984

7760248,4,B01GGXDR6I,"This is one of those cases where I can try to make an introduction about the subject at hand but what can be said that hasn't always been said about this subject which in this case is WWE's Attitude Era which gave the company one of their most successful periods in history as fans all over the world witnessed the superstars & storylines of this period through various media outlets at the time then such as weekly television shows to their monthly PPV's with fans still reliving or now discovering that era of ""sports entertainment"" through the company's own Network & home video collections but there are still matches & events from this period of time despite all of the media exposure that still remain unseen to most audiences outside of those who were there in person until now. Cory Graves host this third edition of WWE's look at the Attitude Era which contains material during this time period (which is debatable but that's another subject for another time) that has yet be released through their television programs, DVD Home Video collections, or their own network at the time of this release while we also get some G-TV moments involving Graves that were either comedic or personal memories of the superstars on this collection.

Matches Include:
Bret Hart vs. Steve Austin - This match took place in Germany months before their highly underrated Survivor Series match that would later in the year & a year before their famous WrestleMania 13 match as both men started chain wrestling early on with Bret always staying a step ahead heavily working over an area of the body causing Austin to resort to brawling tactics while also using Bret's own momentum against him working over a section of the body anyway possible in a back & forth encounter that was definitely a preview of the matches we would know to come from both men.
Apr. '96

Undertaker vs. Mankind - This was their first ""taped"" encounter against each other (possibly their first meeting overall) with both men brawling at the opening bell taking the fight to the outside in the opening moments with both men using whatever possible in that environment to beat on each other from areas of the ring like the apron & ropes to ringside such as the post & steps along with using their own bodies to inflict punishment in what was nothing less than what we've known what to expect from these two: a physical fight.
Post-""In Your House: Good Friends, Better Enemies"" Apr. '96

Undertaker & Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart & British Bulldog - This happened during the WWE's tour of Kuwait with Taker & Bret relying on their strengths to gain the advantage causing Bulldog & Owen to resort to dirty tactics such repeatedly taking advantage of the referee & illegal double teaming while keeping one opponent away from his partner anyway possible in a solid tag match.
May '96

WWE Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Steve Austin - This happened during the WWE's tour of Kuwait with Austin wearing unusual ring attire that may have been a foreshadowing of his future as HBK heavily focused on an area of the body relentlessly working it over while Austin used different tactics to gain the advantage including those that weren't ""by the book"" in a good back & forth contest with the only real negative being ""technical issues"" that did effect everyone's ability to see the action including the participants themselves.
May '96

Ultimate Warrior vs. Owen Hart - This was the Ultimate Warrior's return to Madison Square Garden after 5 years with him using his signature power offense against Owen who in turn attempted a hit & move offense with various aerial offense in a quick contest that Corey Graves mentioned before the match had a resulted in a long term effect on Owen for months after.
May '96

Undertaker vs. Steve Austin - Undertaker was dominate very early with none of Austin's offense having any effect while easily intimidating the referee causing Austin to use a strategy to neutralize Taker's size & power including taking shortcuts when possible in a solid encounter that was more of a preview for their more famous encounters years later.
Aug. '96

WWE Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Goldust - Both men attempted to play mind games having fun at each other's expense before the match with HBK being able to keep saying one step ahead before Goldust was able to catch him & use the environment around him to his advantage neutralizing Shawn's speed while still attempting to play his mind games only for Shawn to one-up him the only way he knew how in a back & forth match with it's entertaining moments.
Post-""In Your House: Buried Alive"" Oct. '96

Shawn Michaels vs. Mankind - A rematch from their Match Of The Year encounter months earlier at ""Mind Games"" as Shawn wasn't his usual self coming into this match based off what happened to him earlier in the night as he started brawling right away bouncing Mankind's head off the table & using a chair before taking off all his ring gear in the open seconds as Mankind matched the intensity with his unorthodox style taking the match to the outside himself as both men continued to use the environment around them to their advantage in what was a physical brawl from start to finish.
Post-""In Your House: It's Time"" Dec. '96

WWE Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Bret Hart vs. Sycho Sid - This match took place in Toronto, Canada at the Skydome following an intense face to face interview with Bret & Shawn earlier in the night as the tension between them was clearly shown in the opening moments allowing Sid to take advantage early on as the match went one with various moments occurring such as one man being taken out of the match allowing the other two to concentrate on each other & instances where one man took out both opponents either individually or at the same time in a good match with each man playing to their strengths throughout the contest.
Post-""RAW"" Feb. '97

Steve Austin, Undertaker, Cactus Jack, Chainsaw Charlie vs. Nation Of Domination - Terry Funk debuted as Chainshaw Charlie earlier in the night making this his first WWE match in over a decade in a basic tag match that saw the the Nation focused on singling out one opponent in their half of the ring using illegal tactics while one particular member kept avoiding one of his opponents at any cost in a fun basic tag match.
Post-""RAW"" Dec. '97

WWE Intercontinental Champion The Rock vs. Ken Shamrock - The Rock had The Nation at ringside & attempted to attack before the opening bell only for Shamrock to trap him in the opening minutes as Shamrock used his trademark offense while Rock took any shortcut possible from pushing the limits of a disqualification to using the outside environment in a solid back & forth contest.
Mar. '98

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Cactus Jack vs. Billy Gunn - It should be noted that this match occurred a week before their Dumpster Match at WrestleMania. Both men started brawling on the floor to the isleway in the opening moments using the environment to their advantage from the cement floor to the ringside steps along with other weapons they were able to get their hands on to either hit with or put their opponent through in what was a fun match with some hardcore & entertaining moments.
Mar. '98

Steve Austin vs. Triple H - Austin faces off against D-Generation X's Triple H a week before his WWE Championship Match at WrestleMania against DX leader Shawn Michaels. Austin started off very dominate including bending the rules to his advantage & using some of his opponents tactics against him while Triple H was able to catch him off guard focusing on a previously injured area of the body through different methods in a match that had the Madison Square Garden crowd hot for everything from start to finish.
Mar. '98

Big Show vs. Triple H - Show had the superior size advantage easily overpowering Triple H to the point where he got so frustrated that he attempted to take it out on someone else only for that to backfire too causing Triple H to resort to various shortcuts & different tactics to neutralize his opponent's strengths in a solid contest.
June '99

Dudley Boyz vs. T&A - This was from WWE's live event on Wall Street in New York to celebrate taking the company public in a quick tag match showcasing both teams teamwork through double team maneuvers & tactics.
Oct. '00

Yokozuna vs. The Sultan - A special note here in that Owen Hart was on commentary with Jim Ross for this match (the only match on this set with commentary) from their tour of South Africa as Yoko was close to 700 pounds here as he used his size to make his limited offense more impactful while Sultan attempted to avoid Yoko's offense & keeping him grounded in a match that never left first gear but significant for one of the final WWE matches from Yokozuna & him against what we now know a fellow member of his samoan family in the Rikishi.
Sept. '96

Goldust vs. Steve Austin - This was a unique match as both men weren't fan favorites but began to start having a following as each attempted to play some mind games early on while working over the same area of the body with both men having no issues taking shortcuts & bending the rules to their advantage as it ultimately came down to one man's issues with someone else coming into play.
Post-""In Your House: It's Time"" Dec. '96

Undertaker, Goldust, Ahmed Johnson vs. Nation of Domination - All men started brawling from the start to the point where one team had to retreat to regroup before being able to focus on one individual when the action once again broke down again in what was a fun tag match.
Post-""RAW"" Mar. '97

WWE Champion Undertaker vs. Steve Austin - It should be noted that it was during this time that Paul Bearer was blackmailing Undertaker with a ""secret"" as Taker was very dominate causing Austin to keep using a tactic to break the momentum only for it to eventually work against him only to use another strategy to take away Taker's size & power advantage in a match that ultimately came down to one man being able to take advantage of catching his opponent off guard.
June '97

WWE Tag Team Champions Legion Of Doom vs. Shawn Michaels & Triple H - Legion Of Doom were very dominate utilizing their power to throw around their opponents individually & as a team to the point where they were bounced in & outside of the ring causing DX to keep attempting to use different tactics such as illegal double teaming & taking advantage of the referee along with Chyna making her presence known in what was a fun tag team match.
Oct. '97

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Steve Austin & Cactus Jack vs. The Rock & DLo Brown - Cactus Jack was the ""replacement"" for Dude Love here as him & Austin took the early advantage staying a step ahead of their opponents both in & outside of the ring before The Nation was able to come back fighting fire with fire as the action broke down into a brawl that saw various weapons involved with more action than the one camera was able to capture in what was a wild brawl that saw more than just the legal participants get in on the action.
Jan. '98

Steve Austin, Cactus Jack, Chainsaw Charlie vs. The Rock & The New Age Outlaws - You knew the direction this match was going when Cactus & Chainsaw started throwing weapons in the ring before the match began as the action went to the outside in the early moments with one man tossed into the front row while another kept getting put against a table that refused to break with the action briefly settling down but couldn't be contained for very long as this was just a fun brawl from start to finish.
Feb. '98

Steve Austin vs. Triple H - Austin started out very hot here before Triple H was able to target an area of the body through any means including taking shortcuts & advantage of any situation when possible only for one of those attempts to eventually backfire on him in a solid contest.
Mar. '98

WWE Champion Undertaker vs. Steve Austin - Both men started trading punches right at the bell & didn't let up when they went to the outside even down the isleway before making their way back into the ring with both men trading momentum & even executing the same move at the same time in a good encounter.
June '99

Hardy Boyz vs. Lo Down - This was another match from WWE's showcase on Wall Street with Lo Down using various tactics to control the match from taking advantage of the referee to singling out one opponent while the Hardys used some of their own strategies against them along with using their opponents against each other in a quick match that could be described as ""tag team wrestling 101""
Oct. '00

Blu-Ray Matches include WWE Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Mankind (Jan. '97), WWE Champion Undertaker vs. Bret Hart vs. Steve Austin (June '97), Dude Love vs. British Bulldog in a Street Fight (Oct. '97), Ken Shamrock & Owen Hart vs. Faarooq & D'Lo Brown (Feb. '98), and Road Dogg vs. Billy Gunn in a Dog Collar Match (July '99).

The positives is of course that WWE finally released an complete unreleased collection of material from their own company archives leading to lost quality performances in regards to the in-ring action or of entertainment value that is unavailable anywhere else. The negatives is that of course with some of this footage not being recorded for television (the house show matches) as we would usually get for their TV/PPV's that the quality isn't as good with some of the footage here as some matches were only shot with one camera either at ringside or from the top of the arena as this was really noticeable in the matches from either the Anaheim Pond or Madison Square Garden with some of the matches from MSG looking like different footage (including the infamous camcorder footage that was recorded for the ""Curtain Call"") was spliced together leading to the quality looking very poor plus keep in mind there is no commentary. The only other criticism that has been going around is that it's been debated when the actual ""Attitude Era"" began & if some of these matches should be on here but I'm not going to disregard matches like Hart/Austin or Undertaker/Mankind just because it doesn't happen technically within the time period. In the end, if your expecting 5 star quality classic matches then you won't find them here but as your getting exactly what is advertised here in unreleased material that is an enjoyable collection that I recommend.",1473552000,3,14374,4.635506677140612

These matches were never originally intended to be released, just house show or dark matches from TV tapings. A lot of it reminds me of going to see WWF/E shows live in the mid-late 90's with my family. This and the newer WWE Unreleased 1986-1995 DVD are a must for any old school fan.",1508803200,,563,4.174311926605505
8762933,3,B01GGXDR6I,"I had so much fun with the Unreleased 1986-95 set that I decided to take a swing at the unreleased set for the Attitude Era, which was the prime era for my WWE fandom so that theres a natural nostalgic tint to things. Knowing this, this should be an easy five star review right? Not so much
Theres nothing wrong about the set per se, its just kind of eh. When I think of the Attitude Era, Im thinking car crash storytelling, violence, nudity, and general craziness. Much of that is removed or sanitized downward in dark match or house show environments because you don't want to injure a big star and hurl weeks and months of planning down the drain.

Theres some interesting stuff here such as a Bret Hart-Stone Cold match from overseas in 1996, Shawn Michaels vs a still Million Dollar champion Stone Cold Steve Austin. But so much stuff comes across as just included for who was in the match see Undertaker-Mankind or even worse WHY was this here: Big Show-HHH and Yokozuna vs. The Sultan. Who was clamoring for those matches?

Some gems, but overall underwhelming",1508544000,,1067,4.5811518324607325
