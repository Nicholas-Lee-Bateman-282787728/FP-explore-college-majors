8507788,5,B0070EX0UQ,"I first saw this on TV and fell in love with this movie, but I was recording it and the recorder shut off before the final outcome of the movie - ahhhhhh!  So I kept looking for this movie and finally found it on Amazon.  It is a great story about a Dad and his daughters learning to know and like each other.
If you love Peter Strauss this movie will not disappoint you.  The bonus was that I found the movie with ""Wrangler"" starring Jeff Fahey another favorite of mine.  I had not seen this movie and thoroughly enjoyed every minute.",1389916800,2,535,4.215686274509804
