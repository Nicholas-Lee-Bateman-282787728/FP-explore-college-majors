2833718,3,B000Q7ZKWU,I had read some reviews on the movie and it seemed pretty interesting. In a whole the movie was so so. I felt that it wasn't really scary except for an occasional scene or two. I felt that they could have delivered more especially with the story line that it has. Worth buying but I would have purchased other movies before this one.,1231804800,,333,4.301587301587301
2833719,2,B000Q7ZKWU,"In terms of special effects and effective moments of creepiness, it works fairly well. The depiction of Kuchisake Onna won't disappoint if you are familiar with the urban legend and have imagined her in your own mind's eye.

However, and because we get a pretty good look at her early on in the movie, she ceases to appear so menacing. In my opinion, the mask shouldn't have come off until much later in the film, allowing the audience to build a sense of dread as to what's beneath.

The pacing is uneven, sluggish at times, and the ""twist"" ending appears forced. In terms of running time, it could very well have ended 15 minutes earlier and wouldn't have made much of a difference.",1221264000,3,684,4.5528455284552845
2833720,4,B000Q7ZKWU,"The Kuchisake-onna, known in English as the Slit-mouthed woman, is a popular bogeyman and urban legend in Japan. Although an ancient legend, she still holds a powerful sway on the Japanese psyche, and as recent as 2004 there have been sightings reported in newspapers, and a mild panic back in 1980's had people running scared from a Kuchisake-onna who had been supposedly hunting down children.  ""Carved""  (Japanese title ""Kuchisake-onna"") is the latest film to play on the fears of Japan, and manifest this folkloric monster onto the screen.

Almost a straight-forward monster/slasher movie, ""Carved"" does a good job updating the kuchisake-onna, making the most of her frightening appearance and equipping her with a signature weapon, a giant pair of scissors that make her even more fearsome.  The plot holds along with the established legend, with the whisper of the appearance of a Kuchisake-onna spreading fear amongst the school children yet being dismissed by unbelieving adults.  Some of the braver children try to catch a glimpse of her, with deadly results, and the plot thickens and the bodies pile up.  Some of the story is unexplained, because every Japanese person would be aware of the legend and not need it pointed out to them, and this might be a little confusing, but these instances are rare.

Director Kji Shiraishi has put out a number of B-ranked horror flicks, like ""Ju-rei"" and ""Noroi"", without ever scoring a really big hit.  His films do the job on a dark cold night of sending some chills up your spine, but no one should expect any sort of masterpiece.  With that in mind, I really enjoyed ""Carved"", more than I thought I was going to, and feel that he upped the ante over his previous films.  The Kuchisake-onna has never looked better, and he managed to make a scary folklore figure even scarier.  Most of the real horror of ""Carved"" comes from the cruel slaughter of children, something rarely seen in US horror flicks.  You see a couple of scrappy kids get cornered by the beast, and wonder ""How are they gonna get out of this one?""  Well, they aren't.  They are going to get a big ol' pair of scissors stabbed into their eyes.",1196726400,25,2161,4.805405405405406
2833721,3,B000Q7ZKWU,"I found the description on the back really interesting.  Of course I want to see a woman have her face cut open by her husband! Unfortunately, it wasn't like that.  This movie is about a woman who abuses her children in fits of madness and then starts kidnapping other kids years later... spooky basement, angry female black-haired ghost, but nothing really interesting.  It's okay but it's not wonderful, you can live without seeing it.",1196640000,7,437,4.878378378378378
2833722,4,B000Q7ZKWU,"At first, i was not sure what to think about Koji Shiraishi's film, Carved: The Slit-Mouthed Woman. If you are a fan of Asian horror (and I know the craze is long gone for this genre), this is a film to see. I own tons of Asian horror films, and while most seem formula, this was not one of those. There was more dept to the storyline and history of the ""long haired ghost woman"". If you're not a fan/or unfamiliar with Asian horror, then this might not be the introduction or the film for you.

I hope Koji Shiraishi gets more attention for his films. I find them better than most other Asian horror films. ""Noroi"" and ""Ju-Rei"" are his best works.",1194220800,,648,4.2682926829268295
2833723,5,B000Q7ZKWU,"CARVED is the latest HORROR DVD I have bought and it was totally
on a whim.  The gamble paid off for this is a CREEPY violent movie
that really grabs you and does not let go. I watched this with
my girl and not only did she look away at parts(hee-hee...Oh! Sorry)
she told me that this was a old GHOST story told from long ago
in Japan(i had no idea?????) in this movie legend holds that thirty
years ago,a suburban town was terrorized by the spirit of a woman
who was GROTESQUELY disfigured by her jealous husband. Now 2007
she has come to HAUNT and kill the children of the town. Make no
mistake this is VERY VIOLENT on children and if that does not
go well with you please avoid this movie at all cost.  I found
this very enjoyable and refreshing for being NEW HORROR(though
I must admit ASIA gets pretty repetitive with the GHOST...I mean
90% of their HORROR involves a GHOST) and recommend this highly
why are their 2 star reviews for this,your guess is as good as mine!
I am happy to own CARVED and suggest you own it too.  Buy CARVED
today, it is a CUT above the rest(sic)",1193443200,,1079,4.228155339805825
2833724,4,B000Q7ZKWU,"Carved was inspired by a Japanese urban legend. Kuchisake-onna (""Slit-Mouthed Woman"").

The legend is said to originate with a young woman who lived hundreds of years ago and was either the wife or concubine of a samurai. She is said to have been very beautiful but also very vain, and possibly cheating on her husband. The samurai, extremely jealous and feeling cuckolded, attacked her and slit her mouth from ear to ear, screaming ""Who will think you're beautiful now?""
""The Slit-Mouthed Woman"", released as Carved in the USA by Tartan Video, uses the Kuchisake-onna urban legend as its source. The version presented here is a modern day account in which the atrocious acts of the legend (jealous husband disfiguring wife), occurred 30 years ago. The Kuchisake-onna is transformed into the evil spirit of a mother who abused and killed her children because she was mentally disturbed from what I could understand.

Midoriyama, a present day Japanese suburban town, is the target of The Slit-Mouthed Woman and as parents, teachers and officials try to understand and solve the mystery of children disappearing, we begin to see a pattern forming about the town's dark secrets and slowly realize that perhaps they are fighting a losing battle - perhaps this is one ghost that will not be easily exorcized, if at all!

Like in most J-Horror films, the actions of the past, haunt present day society with a curse that (as the Ringu and Ju-On series indicate), are insatiable. The spirit will always be angry and vengeful regardless of how many victims fall prey to it and Carved keeps that tradition going with this urban legend of ""The Slit-Mouthed Woman"". Usually the vengeful spirit is an innocent person who was murdered in the past, but this is probably the first J-Horror film I've seen where the person was already evil to begin with. Why that is, is never explained.

She roams around the city, usually in public parks and school yards, wearing a surgical mask concealing her, well, she's called ""The Slit-Mouthed Woman"" for good reason! When she encounters someone, a potential victim (and I have something to say about those ""victims"" below), she will ask them the question: ""Do you think I'm pretty?"" while simultaneously removing her mask to reveal her mutilated mouth. God help you if you answer the question wrong, because if you do, start running fast! Still, it won't matter; you will be caught and be introduced to her little friend - the scissors. She's not Martha Stewart, so don't expect to be shown how to cut a pattern!

This is a very creepy film to watch - those yellow eyes, that slit mouth and that dark eerie house is unsettling enough without the extra added bonus of what I found most disturbing about Carved - the violent treatment of children! In most horror films, the victims are usually not all that nice and pure anyway, so they kind of deserve what they get, but innocent children?

You may have thought Guillermo Del Torro took some liberties with children in ""Devil's Backbone"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth"", but that was Disneyland compared to this. Many feel that the depiction of these violent acts on children in cinema is sort of a, ""necessary evil"" to display on screen, so that we can become a wiser and more aware society and think twice about our children around strangers. I personally find that UN-necessary and should be left out of the movies altogether where children are involved, but hey, some folks learn great life lessons from the movies so, far be it from me to preach here. And, then there are those who have a bent for this sort of thing (meaning a film that is willing to go the extra mile to show you reality and not sugar coat it), and Carved offers up a helping of it here.

It wasn't even all that graphic because most of the really violent acts took place off camera. Well, sort of - you could still see what was being done, just not up close, but what your mind can conjure up can be more alarming and frightening than what the director may have initially been thinking of. And, I couldn't get pass those sounds, those terrible sounds of children being killed!

I don't understand why children were the object of the spirit's retribution because the film never gave an explanation or motivation for these attacks on them. All that aside, you have to admire a film that takes these kind of risks - to treat an audience to something that sets itself apart from the usual Asian horror fare. It was risky, brutal and uncomfortable yes, but I still found it effective and very entertaining in spite of the issues I had with the treatment of children.

Whether that's a good or bad thing, I'll let you be the judge. As for me, when it comes to horror films, I think Pink Floyd said it best:

I personally thought the story was engaging and powerful. If you're uncomfortable with violence towards children, then this movie will be effective towards you. There is also children death. This should be expected though, since the slit-mouthed woman abducts children. Her design was creepy and disturbing. She asks, ""Am I Pretty?"" often, and repeats ""Aim for the neck"". It's not the scariest movie but it is creepy. The acting and music was fine, as well.

I did not like the ending, though; I felt it was a bit lackluster. There were also a couple of unanswered questions.

It is like someone watched a cheap American slasher film and copied its mindless structure.  As an example, the one-dimensional characters do not seem to be able to defend themselves and just lie there like stage props appearing aghast for an eternity  before entity claims them. The relentless focus on violence towards children is disturbing and must be reflective of a child abuse problem in Japanese culture that is not being addressed.  The ending was a silly, predictable ""slasher-film"" ending clearly borrowed as the result of a lack of general creativity in the writing.  Tartan Asia Extreme should be ashamed of this one.

2833779,3,B000Q7ZKWU,"<strong>Kuchisake-onna</strong> (Kji Shiraishi, 2007)

Now before we begin, let me say: take note of the release date. This movie was released in English speaking countries as <em>Carved: The Slit-Mouthed Woman</em>, but its Japanese title, <em>Kuchisake-onna</em> in Romanji, is identical to that of the 1996 cult-classic short that launched the franchise (known in English-speaking countries as simply <em>The Slit-Mouthed Woman</em>. AND, just to make things more confusing, the 2005 film <em>Kann byt: nureta akai kuchibiru</em> was released in America as, you guessed it, <em>The Slit-Mouthed Woman</em>. Which is all needlessly confusing. But of the three, this is the most famous, at least on this side of the Pacific.

While this could have been an incredible piece of work, most of the criticisms of the film I've read over the past few weeks all have merit to them; the film feels rushed (female lead Eriko Sat says in the DVD extras the entire film was shot in ten days), it's painfully low-budget, etc. You can make a great low-budget flick without having it <em>seem</em> like a low-budget flick (my usual example for this is <em>Deadbirds</em>, which looks like a Hollywood blockbuster despite having been shot in three weeks and costing less than a minute of the last Transformers movie did); <em>Carved</em> in no way does this. Sat (best known for the Cutie Honey live-action flick) and male lead Haruhiko Kat (<em>Kairo</em>) spend much of their time hamming it up, rather than acting, which lends an air of sad comedy to the entire affair, rather than the horror one assumes the director was after. It's kind of hard to like this movie, but despite all that, there's a pretty nice (if totally predictable) twist to the climax; watchable, though not worth going out of your way for. ** ",1327449600,,1804,5.1084745762711865

I enjoy this style of film where they don't really have a happy ending and there is no token male/female who make it out alive and in love... This is good old-fashioned boogeyman greatness. An unsettling horror that grabs you with little gore and keeps your attention without sex.  I love those as well, but this gets hold of you without it and gives you that nice Fulci feeling at the end where you made it out and all seems set straight, but NO you are somehow scarred by the experience and there is no hot chick or guy to kiss, no smiles or holding hands, but a true feeling of dread left from a traumatic encounter.

We have no idea who will survive, regardless of age, gender, or seeming heroic status!

2833782,3,B000Q7ZKWU,"Asian horror movies have really set the standard lately for the genre.  Almost all of the Hollywood horror movies nowadays are either direct remakes or homages to Japanese horror films.  Movies like Paranormal Activity tend to follow the uber-creepy style of movies like Ringu, while the torture porn like Saw pay tribute to the splatter-fests like Angel Guts (and, to be fair, the Japanese gore-fests are just the Italian Giallo redone).

So, a movie like Carved has some pretty big expectations.  Unfortunately, what we get is less top-flight J-Horor and more just the tedious American Freddy Kruger type slasher.

Carved brings a Japanese folktale to the screen, but in the process there is almost no drama or tension.  The characters are never really brought into full life, and there is never enough build-up in the situations to make them approach the minimum required scare level.  Instead, the movie just floats along as a basically non-threatening series of sharp cuts and growing victim count.

Which is really sad considering just how good some Japanese Horror is.  Their studios are really setting the pace for all manner of horror, and movies like Carved really fail in comparison.

That's not to say Carved was bad, per se.  In fact, as a standard slasher it stands quite well.  It's just when placed next to other Asian Horror where it shrinks.",1302220800,2,1359,4.964601769911504

2833784,4,B000Q7ZKWU,"Carved is a great ghost story that is extremely dark and extremely creepy at times. It deals with things that American film won't touch, namely, the killing of children with a large pair of scissors. Now if that isn't dark I don't know what is. The film can be quite shocking at times and I don't understand why some of the other reviewers said the pacing was too slow. The movie doesn't go at a breakneck speed but at the same time the film doesn't take it's time with introducing the villain. Overall, a great horror film that will appeal to most people even if they aren't interested in Asian horror. On a side note, read this account from wikipedia of the actual legend,

""The legend is said to originate with a young woman who lived hundreds of years ago (some versions of the legend state the Heian period) and was either the wife or concubine of a samurai. She is said to have been very beautiful but also very vain, and possibly cheating on her husband. The samurai, extremely jealous and feeling cuckolded, attacked her and slit her mouth from ear to ear, screaming ""Who will think you're beautiful now?""

The urban myth picks up from this point, stating that a woman roams around at night (especially during foggy evenings), with her face covered by a surgical mask, which would not be especially unusual, as people in Japan often wore masks in order to protect themselves from the flu. When she encounters someone (primarily children or college students), she will shyly ask, ""Am I beautiful?"" (""Watashi kirei?""). If the person answers yes, she will take off her mask and say, ""Am I beautiful now?"" (""Kore demo?""). At this point, if the victim answers ""No,"" she will slay them or cut their mouths to resemble hers (in many versions, her weapon is a pair of scissors). If the victim tells her she is pretty a second time, she follows the victim home and slays them at the doorway to their residence, due to the fact that ""kirei"" ('''), Japanese for 'pretty,' is a near homophone of ""kire"" (''), the imperative form of ""to cut"". In other versions of the myth if you reply yes after she removes the mask she will give you a large blood soaked ruby and walk away. Another version says that if you reply yes, she will take her scissors and cut your mouth from ear to ear, making you resemble her. On most versions of the myth she is impossible to escape, as she can either appear in front of you no matter which way you turn or can move at superhuman speeds and catch you.<Yokai Attack, Kodansha Publishing>""

8195024,4,B000Q7ZKWU,"I expected this movie to be a bit silly, but it was actually a little sad.  The main story is less about horror and more about what makes a mother begin to abuse their child.  It did have some creepy moments, but the ending was a little predictable.",1476144000,3,249,4.166666666666667
8195025,4,B000Q7ZKWU,I really liked this one. It's different than most ghost horror movies and is based on a japenese urban legend. I pratically really like urban legend horror movies. The deaths are good in this movie and the story line is decent. I love how she says am I pretty right before she slices them. On a bonus the sequel/prequel is alright but not as good.,1475971200,,347,4.3538461538461535
