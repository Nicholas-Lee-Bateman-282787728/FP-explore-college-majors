8224486,3,B000WOSB4G,"The highlights of the gladiators were given but nothing of real depth.
The History Channel could have put out something better especially knowing there were gladiator games for nearly a thousand years.",1299715200,2,201,5.3125
8224487,4,B000WOSB4G,Good but short history. It could have been expanded perhaps with the personal histories of some of the more famous gladiators or events.,1297987200,,136,4.956521739130435

8224489,5,B000WOSB4G,"This DVD is rich in history.  Not only does it cover the duration of gladiator games, but the history, weaponry, and some of the most famous.  It covers the emperors behind the games, and the evolution of the arenas.  I see lots of the film Galdiator taken from the history of the games.  Sorry, no mention of Maximus.  Sparticus was interesting though.",1211500800,9,353,4.629032258064516
