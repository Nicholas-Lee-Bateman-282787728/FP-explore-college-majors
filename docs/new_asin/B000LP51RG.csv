8162800,4,B000LP51RG,"When translating the video into practice, even as a refresher, the ""chapters"" are spaced too far apart.  This makes scanning for pertinent information cumbersome, and they are not necessarily rationally spaced.  For example, elemental Heng dao is mixed into the same chapter as the first TEN movements.  The instructor clearly knows the form better physically than verbally, and that comes across in his instruction, however, that is a bonus.  It means his illustration is crisp, clean, and controlled.  While it would have been easier if subtitles were traded in for dubbed english, it is easily worth the cost.  Despite my complaints, anyone willing to use their rewind buttons and fast-fowrward button will find this is an excellent reference and learning tool for the broadsword when used in conjunction with a solid knowledge of the unarmed elemental forms.",1193443200,,862,5.255474452554744
