7871213,5,6304376073,THANKS VERY MUCH for Good,1520294400,,25,4.2
7871214,1,6304376073,"Really.
I came here to watch a 'thriller'  movie with Christopher Plummer in it, after seeing him in 'Exception,' which was an amazing role for him.as well as a great movie (20 yrs after this one). Plummer is great here, but the movie is not, and honestly I hung on a long time.  I wanted to say that this movie was just 'not good', not that it was bad, but  just.  not.  good.

Then at around 1hr:15 or so, the dancing in the rain scene w/ background music written by Michael Bolton (but sung by some other dude) pierced my ears, and the combination of bad writing, incomprehensible story line, ridiculous 'i hate you, well maybe I really like you' budding relationship....Well let's just say it took a toll on me.

BUT I wanted to find out about the package (had I not already been given enough information to flee the scene?).  Foolish person, I  am.
You get the idea.  Really, save yourself.  Go watch Exception.  You can thank me later.",1502409600,,941,4.43859649122807
7871215,2,6304376073,"This movie, looks like it was shot for TV with an R rating, all over the place, it looks like someone who directed the Outer Limits was trying to do cameos for somebody's kid actors and commercial sounding music light and mellow music in dark parts, maybe somebody got out of rehab and got a producers job, maybe they were getting divorced and went to work and produced something weird. It's weird, I watched it to the end to see if there was a twist, a flip, there wasn't, it was just weird.",1497657600,,492,4.301075268817204
7871216,1,6304376073,"Disagree with thither three reviews! I did not/COULD NOT continue after  20 minutes! Acting was very poor, and the story progressed very slowly. Those are twenty minutes that I can never regain! So sorry I was enticed by what I thought was going to be a more recent production! The ad for this movie did not even have a date as to the year it came out, which is the only reason I started to watch it,",1481414400,,400,4.194805194805195
7871217,5,6304376073,"I really love this movie! Geraint Wyn Davies plays a Terminator-like villain who will stop at nothing to get the prize. Lots of suspense, action (some language that could be done without...) Forever Knight fans will especially appreciate seeing other familiar faces from the series - I counted three, but I might have missed some. This movie moves at a good pace and keeps you hooked. Now out on DVD!!",1202860800,,401,4.742857142857143
7871218,5,6304376073,"I'm lucky enough to already have this on VHS but will probably buy the dvd for the better quality. I'm a big fan of Geraint Wyn Davies, and he's particularly nasty in this. Everyone's acting is top notch, and the film itself is well worth buying.",1185235200,7,246,4.369565217391305
7871219,5,6304376073,"This is a teriffic movie. Geraint Wyn Davies is a bad guy who just doesn't quit... For anyone who loves children it will make you wonder how you will even make it through the elevator scene.
I highly recommend this to anyone who likes non-stop thrills.",1021507200,,252,4.5
