2831868,5,B000Q66QC4,"it has a good cast, the scenery is beautiful and the music score really puts you into the picture.  A good suspense/drama with a hint of the supernatural forces that plague the men in the movie.  the action sequences were choreographed by a real former US Navy SEAL, so the fight scenes are authentic as you can get.  definately worth it.",1185148800,4,338,4.508196721311475
8194476,1,B000Q66QC4,What a joke. First half of movie was fair but then the nonsense started. Save your time from watching this crap.,1526083200,,112,4.380952380952381
8194477,1,B000Q66QC4,Watch the first two minutes is all you need.  Horrible movie.  Shaky camera.  The weapons are from the Vietnam era.,1524528000,,115,4.65
8194478,2,B000Q66QC4,This was terrible.,1524268800,,18,5.333333333333333
8194479,1,B000Q66QC4,"Poor voice acting. Lack of firearm knowledge for a war movie. Overall, hard to watch.",1522627200,,85,4.733333333333333

8194481,3,B000Q66QC4,"Afghanistan. Buddies left behind. Michael Madsen dullifying my screen. Plot so thin it could be a runway model. Occidental Asians. No stars so far. Up side? Steve Bacic is a very beautiful and talented human being. Five stars for that lovely creature's mere appearance and dogged attempt to carry the whole damn movie.  If you want a well-plotted action flick, you're S.O.L. If you want tall, dark Canadian eye-candy (who, ironically, does the best, if not ONLY, acting in the entire flick), put it in the player, set to ""repeat"", and back over the remote. Don't waste your time sending e-mails or letters to the scriptwriter/studio/FX folks/""fight choreographers""(a claim which takes a big, clangy pair o'brass ones to even MAKE.  If this is how ""Real"" Navy SEALS fight, we're screwed!)/makeup/wardrobe/food services/random extras/etc. Send hearty ""Thank You"" notes to whichever awake-at-the-switch person that cast the only actual talent (and isn't even LISTED in the ""Who's in this thing, anyway?"" category): The exceptionally versatile Steve Bacic (Yes, I already said he's easy to look at. So are Michaelangelo's statues, but they can't act.  He CAN.  This guy's gotta be the most underrated actor in North America), and if so inclined, a congratulatory note to his Signifigant Other on making such a talented and attractive catch.  Zero stars for the flick, five stars for the ""scenery"", five stars for said scenery's heroic attempt to carry the whole freakin' show (while not disolving into paroxysms of laughter that his character's biggest problem isn't Bin Ladin, hostile locals, or poppy farmers upset that the damn Americans just stomped through their crops again and are even now dipping pitchforks in camel dung to go skewer the interlopers, but the ghost of GHENGIS KHAN seems to have severe P.M.S.!).  Averages out to three stars.  As with all, um, wobbly? plotted films, try watching it again after a water tumbler full of ouzo, it'll improve.",1258070400,,1960,5.16403785488959
8194482,1,B000Q66QC4,"Absolutely atrocious. Michael Madsen in his usual stereotype tough-guy movie. Someone mentioned an ex-Navy SEAL did the fight sequences? Not the firefight sequences, which were amateurish at ""worst.""  The opening scenes of the Ghenghis Khan crap was hilarious. They obviously didn't hire enough Asian actors, so they had a bunch of lilly white guys trying to look like Mongols. The acting and direction was pathetic. You can always tell when they story line and acting is going to stink within the first few minutes; this movie doesn't fail in that department.

Long story short - after 13 minutes, you'll be glad you didn't buy this garbage. If you did, you must be one of the many who want to pawn this movie off on Amazon. You won't wonder where all the wannabee actors are in Hollywood, because they're safely out of Hollywood doing these cheap, trashy, crappy movies in the boonies where they belong. This movie stunk like a pile of compost.

The prerequisite for acting in this movie was to be psychopathic killer and spout profanities at will. I've seen better short movies on You Tube.",1240617600,,1093,4.834224598930481
8194483,3,B000Q66QC4,"The demon filed caves of Afghanistan  are the setting for
a twisted fight between good and evil. The soul of a brother cries out
calling to a cave of demon Mongol warriors.
What was a rich warlord's extraction becomes the death of all but
a few. The filming in the cave is too dark, so that a lot
of plot detail is lost; a very dark movie with an ironic ending.",1204675200,,361,4.084507042253521
8194484,1,B000Q66QC4,"I can't believe the positive reviews for this one.  I kept watching this thinking ""I am sure glad this is a red box rental or I would be completely pissed"".  Poor acting, poor script, and a low point for Michael Madsen.  I felt bad for him.",1189209600,5,240,4.173913043478261
8194485,5,B000Q66QC4,"I really liked the depth of the script and the supernatural twist, plus I thought the storyline was good and all the actors were good, esp. Francesco Quinn.  Michael madsen, as always, had a good performance.",1186272000,3,208,4.777777777777778
