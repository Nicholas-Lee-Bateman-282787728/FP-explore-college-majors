8422158,4,B004BPD4PS,"It is a fun video about the mystery and ""curse"" behind the Hope Diamond and its history.  I show it to my chemistry students for the small amount of chemistry that it discusses with analyzing its composition.  If it had more of the science and more of an explanation about the spectroscopy, it would get 5 stars.",1485734400,,312,4.456140350877193

8422160,5,B004BPD4PS,hope diamond is such a mystery this dvd explains a lot,1475452800,,54,4.0
8422161,5,B004BPD4PS,"This film followed the history of the Hope diamond starting with the rumors of having a curse on it. Everyone has their own thoughts about it, but it is still fascinating in itself. Personally, I would love to touch it and view it up close at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, DC but I guess I will have to be content with seeing it in photographs and TV. But it is so very gorgeous, and the sub titles worked, and in the movie, everything that happened with it was explained thoroughly.",1461024000,,494,4.43956043956044
