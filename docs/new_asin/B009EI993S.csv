5322322,1,B009EI993S,This video is not worth the cost.  The acting is terrible and I can't belive that they could even think of selling it.  This should had ended up on the cutting room floor never to be seen.  DO NOT BUY THIS OR EVEN RENT IT.  one star is 10 to many (I give this -10 stars),1398211200,5,270,3.767857142857143
5322323,2,B009EI993S,If you did not see it it doesn't matter. Very badly interpreted. It is a very bad movie. I am disappointed that a book of such a quality is so been massacred by the movie,1397433600,2,170,3.8857142857142857
5322324,1,B009EI993S,"I had such hope for this ... deeply disappointed. Other than the homes, vehicles, clothing and style/music it is just reiterating Jane's words ... the acting was sub-par.

Very sad, very sad, indeed.",1396224000,2,199,5.03030303030303
5322325,1,B009EI993S,"Absolute rubbish!!! I wish I could return it for a full refund! I was very disappointed ,,,the acting was the worst!!! I would not recommend it to an idiot! Certainly not worth the time, effort  and the material it took to make the film and definitely not worth the price!!!! :( ....and not even worth the 1 star I had to give in order to make this comment!! :(",1393027200,,361,4.231884057971015
5322326,2,B009EI993S,"The acting was BAD. I didn't mind the plot changes so much, but the acting was so bad. I really hoped for more. The scenery was not England and the interior settings were from a high school play. Tank tops on a snowy day?

5322327,2,B009EI993S,The movie was like watching a play at the live Theater.  It didn't have background music to go with the drama.,1363305600,12,110,4.238095238095238
5322328,4,B009EI993S,I would recommend this video. Really liked & enjoyed it. It came promptly. Thanks for making this Bonnie Mae! Outtakes/behind the scenes would of been nice to see.,1356566400,2,163,4.857142857142857
5322329,4,B009EI993S,"Movie was good, but dragged with old english.  Actors were good and direction, set, and story coverage was very good.",1355356800,6,117,4.85
5322330,2,B009EI993S,"I hate to give pain to anyone, especially when it involves Pride and Prejudice, but this movie was a total disappointment for me. I had such high hopes for it. I love anything P&P and thought they had a great idea. So what happened and why do I feel that way? First of all, the acting. It was terrible. I don't know where they got the actors (I almost feel like they weren't actors at all!). It was torture listening to them recite their lines. I almost wish they had more modernized the language so at least they would be more comfortable with it (then again, maybe it wouldn't have helped). And there was no chemistry at all between the characters. I could see no evidence that Darcy liked Elizabeth (and really couldn't see why he would). I think one of the problems was that it was modern (Jane rides a bike to Netherfield instead of a horse), but at the same time it wasn't. I watched this movie once and I have no desire to watch it again. I was just glad I watched it before gathering my Jane Austen friends over to view it together. And one final gripe - this was supposed to follow the book. So why did they add the scene at Rosings where Elizabeth is forced to bid on a card game using her necklace? There was absolutely no reason for that at all. Overall, the movie is very ill, indeed.",1353715200,6,1297,4.255060728744939
5322331,2,B009EI993S,"Well what can I say?  This is truely a modern P&P. Having said this does not mean that it was good. The story is almost word for word of the original story which does not work. They needed to twique the script. Now on for the actual movie. The sets were boring and just plain wierd. They really didn't have much of a set and I think they could of used real family room furniture in the Netherfield house. And if a scene is out side than they should of used more of the outside, instead of really just pacing in the same spot.  The acting was sub par, but Mrs Bennet and Lizzy were better acting. I don't mind that I purchased this video because I understand the procedes go to Indie films.  Good cause. I wish these actors better scripts and sucess.  Unfortunately I cannot recomend this video. It was tedious and way too long to keep my interest or anyones for that matter. Sorry very disappointing :(",1353628800,16,902,4.288235294117647
8540594,1,B009EI993S,"I am amazed that this product is offered for sale at all. As much as I like a modern reworking of a classic, this film should not have been allowed to be released to the public. The script, costumes, acting, scenery, everything about it, yells amateur, backyard production. Now I have to try my best to unsee it...",1466121600,,314,4.431034482758621
8540595,4,B009EI993S,"""A Modern Pride and Prejudice"" does not purport to be a BBC Drama or Hollywood blockbuster. It is clearly an independent production that sought to translate in a contemporary fashion one of the most beautiful stories in English literature. Yes, it is obviously low budget and somewhat quirky, but it was also a job well done. I really enjoyed it and moreover appreciated the time and effort put forth by this group. I just want to say: thank you.",1463961600,2,446,4.658227848101266

8540597,3,B009EI993S,"Clever Idea---Not followed thru on as well as I'd hoped.
The ""classic"" language overlaid on a modern presentation didn't work very well; though with better editing it might have been better. This looked like a pretty low budget operation....

Still, for nuts like me, who want to see all video versions of our favorite story,  still worth adding to the collection...",1441152000,,366,4.983606557377049
