8125585,5,B000FQISTE,"Glad I did and the third disc as well!!!
Tenchi Muyo is my first real Anime 'love'... Some folks find it disappointing or a failure... but they just don't get what is being said through the series... it is basically what it always was - a teenager's problem with 'girls'... and some serious philosophy and history of Shinto sprinkled in.  I take back anything detracting I ever said! - I highly recommend this series and the FIRST SERIES and the GXP series as well! (which if you watch it BEFORE watching this final set - you will no doubt have these sets in your treasure chest!
GET THIS if you are a true 'Anime Otaku'!!",1402790400,,622,4.408695652173913
8125586,4,B000FQISTE,"This new OVA series was billed as the continuation and completion of the original 26 episode OVA of Tenchi Muyo, one of my favorite anime series of all time, but a series that was marred by a continued release of movies and TV shows that were abominations that adulterated and trampled the original Tenchi concept into the dirt. Will this new series live up to its promise and satisfy us Tenchi fans?

Apparently not.

Each episode on this set, though of excellent production value, introduces a new character into the Tenchi cannon - a wife for Tenchi's grandfather (where has she been the last 12 years, eh?) Misao (Sasami's shy gal pal from the Pretty Sami series) is brought back in name only, as Mihoshi's incestuous brother! No wonder the poor girl is so messed up... and then a new super-villain named ""Z"" shows up. And, once again, the story focuses on these new additions to the Tenchi family at the expense of Ayeka, Rhyoko and Sasami. And none of  these character have the charm and personality of the original cast. I found myself annoyed and thinking ""enough of this, get back to Sasami and Ayeka"". Sasami is pretty much a fifth wheel in all these episodes. Ryokho is, again, edgier - possibly to appeal to a ""modern"" audience - and the villains - Z espeically - are much darker and ""edgier"".  Revelations are made regarding Tsunami/Sasami, Washu, and Tokimi, which are about the only thing that ties these three episodes back to the original OVA.  And, for some reason, the new series is only 7 episodes long, rather than 13 - and those seven episodes are divided up on three DVDs - 3 on the first, 3 on the second and only one episode on the third set.  Certainly four episodes could have fit on the first disk, and the final three on this second disk. The verdict?  Tenchi is not the Target after all, but your wallet. Will the final disk fulfil the promise made of completing the original OVA. If they continue to introduce new characters at the expense of the old, I sincerely doubt it. If you are a hardcore fan of the original Tenchi OVAs you will probably want to pick this up, but also be prepared to be annoyed by the neglect heaped on the original story and cast. But, at least, it's not set in a new ""alternate"" Tenchi universe, which is about the only thing in its favor thus far. The series has one episode left to redeem itself.",1181347200,,2356,4.503512880562061
8125587,1,B000FQISTE,Storyline is weak and not consistent with past episodes.  Very disappointing.,1173484800,,77,6.0
8125588,3,B000FQISTE,"From the start the episodes take a turn for the good with a serious, though at times funny, story to it.  Then we get a look into the Masaki household to see everything's back to the norm, for the most part.  Noike makes a better presence at the beginning, though still has this annoying air of perfection about her.  Things quickly turn, however, when Misao, Mihoshi's brother, attacks.  The scenes are more hilarious than action-packed (most of the action is actually told rather than shown to us which isdisappointing) with Ryoko being the star of the show.  It's strange seeing Sasami beating up a supposedly combat-hardened warrior, though.  Methinks that could've been handled better.

The episodes quickly take a turn for the worse when everyone (sans Ryoko and Tenchi) start acting like Mihoshi on a sugar trip and feel like playing matchmaker during a rather serious situation.  From there the main characters are all glossed over to focus on Misao and his love interest, develop these characters and have them fall in love.  It's useless, really.  Both characters were only introduced an episode ago, they/re the only ones getting screen time for half the episode and neither is especially likeable nor has an interesting past to delve into, yet it still happens.  A potentially serious and good story was thrown away for a shoddily and quickly made love story.

Introduced to the cast as well in these first two episodes is Lady Seto, the devil princess who shows us nothing which lives up to her name.  The woman is mild and kind, playing matchmaker and generally being underwhelming.  The woman brings nothing to the table.  No plot points, no comedy, no personality.  She's given screen time for nothing.  On the other hand everyone else, aside from Noike, Sasami, Washu and Ryo-ohki, suffers. Tenchi and Ayeka are giving disturbingly little screen time, especially Tenchi, while Mihoshi is relegated to ditzy matchmaker.  Ryoko is better off than the previous three episodes, but she is still made this mild character who is quick to be other new character's *****.  I don't remember her ever really backing down before, but she does it now all the time and it's a rather disturbing trait.  Other than that she gets ample screen time and is central to the funnier moments in the episodes.

The third episode gets space of it's own as it's really the standout of the new OVA.  Z comes and the goddesses are explained.  This is by far the best episode of the new OVA, though that's not saying much.  Z remains a genuinely interesting character I wish we could see more of.  The girls are glassed over again, though it's understandable as they're little more than pawns while it takes place.  Despite the information revealed and the great character interaction, however, the episode is still very flawed.  For one, it was rushed.  It should've been made into two episodes, but it wasn't so a lot of things which could've been made better or explained more weren't.  The actual battle with Z is underwhelming, as is the appearances of the three goddesses.  The info expplained is difficult to take in and also a little underwhelming when we figure out what the heck's going on.  I also don't like how, while the other helpless girls are barely even backgorund scenery, Noike still seems to get special attention even though she brings nothing to the table.  On the other hand, it's good to see Ryoko as brash and aggressive as we've seen her.  In the end it's a great, if rushed and underwhelming, episode.

Voice acting is better than the last three episodes with Tenchi sounding himself again, Noike fitting in a little bit more and nearly everyone else remaining good.  Ryoko takes a turn for the worst, however, with a voice which ends up sounding forced.  The animation is pretty smooth with a bit too many of the crazier anime tendencies for my taste, but generally pretty good.

In the end, very flawed and not much compared to the first two OVAs, but much better than the previous three episodes.",1171756800,3,4016,4.801749271137027
8125589,2,B000FQISTE,"The first two Tenchi Muyo OAV series are amongst my favorite anim, and if I've soldiered on to buying this DVD (and the third one) is mainly a form of respect towards those two series, for of its own merit, this DVD and its two others are not worth the purchase. Forget character development, the makers have decided it was better to throw in a high number of characters and give them but minimal time to flesh out their personalities, which also results in the main characters becoming but background colors for the most part of the series. What made the strength of the original series was the mix between comedy, romance and drama, however in this series, there is no mix, it's generally all a big joke all the way (and generally unfunny), even supposedly serious confrontations turn out to be completely harmless situations as the episodes progress. This is true except for the third episode on this DVD which contains the only time that the situation isn't 100% anticipated or controlled by powerful benevolent figures. The serious story in here seems to have lost all sense of scale, going even beyond DBZ-level, which instead of increasing the series' drama, instead kills it by coming to ridiculous levels.

In short, the story blows... big time. Some ideas that were interesting can be detected, but their treatment was so bad that nothing grows out of it. The production level surrounding it, making it without a doubt the most attractive Tenchi Muyo series, seems wasted.",1168128000,4,1482,4.834645669291339
8125590,4,B000FQISTE,"Unfortunately I have to agree with a previous reviewer.

After all this story building up from the first OVA this second one consists of 3 episodes approximately 100 minutes long (total).

The first two episodes fall more into the category of slap stick comedy and in general do not provide us with much (story) background of the final battle of the third episode.

After the two episodes are over, the third one is one of the best of the entire Tenchi series and hell brakes loose as Z tries to kill Tenchi and during the battle they blow away (literally) the moon, earth, galaxies and so forth (unfortunately, I cannot say much more or how the battle will end otherwise I will give everything away, sorry guys).

To be honest, I love the Tenchi series and everything about it but I was expecting a lot more, from this OVA, something that did not come in the end. On the other hand, the final episode has everything but it just lasted for about thirty minutes. You see, in this episode it is not just the battle that is going on but you will also see what the characters are all about, like Tsunami. Furthermore, you will be given so much information and explanations that in feels a little bit rushed to do in only thirty minutes. If the OVA would be in the spirit of the last episode (and maybe longer) than this DVD would get ten stars straight.

Therefore, my recommendation is this: If you are a huge fan of Tenchi or just want to complete your Tenchi collection so far etc. than buy it. If on the other hand, you are someone who loves to watch anime than rent it; either way, and to be honest, buying it or not is entirely left up to you to decide.

As for the dub and music it is very well orchestrated and very good.

The animation is astonishing and even upgraded that the first OVA.

As for the extras: Non credit opening / ending, art work, previews of other anime series etc.

Well,

I hope that I could help... ^_^",1163203200,7,1928,4.345403899721449
8125591,4,B000FQISTE,"Volume 2 ends the ""OAV 3"" series (there's still the ""OAV 3 +1"" series with its single episode, which will be released in volume 3), and does so with mixed results.  However, its the end that canon Tenchi fans will find the best episode of the entire series.

Picking up from the original Pioneer episode numbering, volume 2 covers episodes 17-19 (4-6 of ""OAV 3).  Episode 17 has Mihoshi's brother Misao bring his giant, spherical, planet-sized Galaxy Police warship ""Chobimaru"" to Earth to rescue his sister from the ""evil"" Tenchi.  Meanwhile, Aeka and Sasami-chan's powerful grandmother, Seto-sama, arrives on Earth to visit them, her adopted daughter Noike, and to meet with Tenchi in person.  That means a feast must be prepared.  Episode 18 deals with Misao and his aide (and leader of the Galaxy Police Special Forces on board the ""Chobimaru"") Mashisu and their relationship.  While these episodes are OK on thier own, there is an amazing amount of time wasted.  Instead of pushing forward the story, Kajishima-sensei instead went for texture and ""day at the Masaki household.""  Fans who haven't seen ""GXP"" (which takes place a year after ""OAV 3"" but was produced prior to the OAV) may wonder why so much focus is given to Misao and Mashisu.  Fans may also be frustrated by how K-sensei resolves the various girls in Tenchi's harem dealing with the GP Special Forces.

MAKE SURE YOU WATCH AFTER THE END CREDITS OF EPISODE 18!  Otherwise you'll miss a VERY important event.

Episode 19 is by far the best.  Here, we have Z finally confront Tenchi and the secret of who Tenchi really is and the purpose of the Choushin (Tsunami, Washu, and Tokimi-sama) are revealed.  There is a lot of things packed into this episode, so much so that fans will certainly want to watch it more than once to get it all (and I recommend watching the Japanes subtitled version in order to get things as accurate as possible).  While this kind of story may not be the ones that K-sensei enjoys doing as much, it certainly is his strongest one of the entire ""OAV 3"" series.  However in true Kajishima fashion, for every question he answers, he drops a couple of new questions, which the site ""Tenchi Muyo! FAQ"" attempts to find answers to.

As to the DVD, FUNimation does a great job with the subtitles. The translator goes for a more ""fan-friendly"" translation in including the honorifics ""-oniichan"" and ""-oneechan"" (as well as thier more respectful forms), but refrained from going overboard and using the term as a stand-alone title.  I would have prefered the stand-alone version be included too, especially when Tokimi-sama addresses her older sisters.  However, how Mato translated this works perfectly well and as such, I am not going to complain. ^_^

FUNimation includes a couple of interesting extras.  They have the music video for the ED theme ""Lovely Cooking.""  If you are a hardcore fan like me, you may remember this as I believe the Japanese production company AIC  had it on their website for a time.  However, the two-part ""The Real Tenchi Tour"" will be of keen interest to Tenchi fans.

The two composers of the music for ""OAV 3"" take a tour of places in Japan that were used as settings for ""TM!R"" or were name-sakes for the characters.  These videos appear to have been done for the Japanese Tenchi Muyo Fan Club, so they aren't a documentary, but a cross between someone's home movies and a small production company's promotional video.  That's not a slam, just a note on the video style.  It was great getting to see these places especially since I may never get to take the trip myself.

Bottom line: some story is sacrificed for texture, but the final episode more than makes up for any of the problems in the series. FUNimation including the ""Real Tenchi Tour"" as an extra is a really nice touch.  Certainy worth buying if you are a Tenchi fan.",1159488000,12,3852,4.738738738738738
