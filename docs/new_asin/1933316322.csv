203228,5,1933316322,"This 2 disk DVD set ""Native Spirit and The Sun Dance Way"" is a must-see educational documentary for every North American, to learn about the Native Indian history, the unimaginable injustices committed against them, but also their amazingly beautiful culture and spiritual ways and ceremonies. The Sun Dance ceremony is very sacred and in respecting and keeping it that way, non-Natives usually do not have access to it. This documentary provides rare video footage and insights into the background of the ceremony, the preparations, the symbolism and the ceremony itself. It provides everything to everyone to learn about and respect the Native Culture.

A Native friend once said to me, no matter how much you read about Native Indians, you will not learn much ""knowledge"". And I suppose that is true, because knowledge comes from experience. Both documentaries ""Native Spirit and The Sun Dance Way"" give us the opportunity to be quiet and to listen to the Native Elders such as Thomas Yellowtail and Joe Medicine Crow, and hopefully to gain knowledge through what we experience by listening to them.

Both documentaries will leave you with a lot respect for what First Nations have endured, but also for what they have to give, and they will leave you deeply moved and humbled.

7801737,4,1933316322,"I do not think I personally  learned anything new but I appreciated  the sharing of wisdom and cultural knowledge.  There are too few such resources  that can inform those of other cultures or even that can be used with the children of First Nations People.  The fact that  some of the key contributors to this DVD are no longer on this side emphasizes the fact that  treasure not appreciated and preserved will disappear.  I doubt that this video would win production awards, but  its content is  to be appreciated.",1387843200,2,516,4.696629213483146
7801738,3,1933316322,I'm on the fence about this publication because it has pictures of some very sacred ceremonies that  I was taught should never be filmed or photographed for fear of people misunderstanding them and creating another Salem...hasn't happened yet,1359158400,,242,5.368421052631579
7801739,5,1933316322,I purchased the video and book as a present for my husband.  He loved both.  He's watched the video multiple times and keeps going back to the book.  Highly recomended.,1358553600,2,168,4.533333333333333
7801740,5,1933316322,"A rare opportunity to get first  hand information about this important Plains Indian Ceremony.
Native People sharing their religion with other people, also non - Indians, so we can get an understanding of them. This Ceremony is a prayer and thanksgiving to the Creator in a true and impressing way of high spirituality. I appreciate what is shared in this film. We all can learn something from it. As a student of North American Cultures it was very interesting to me and I can recommend this film highly.",1355702400,2,505,4.738636363636363
7801741,3,1933316322,I also was surprised at how they filmed the Sundance ceremony itself.  My understanding is that it is not done.  However the dvd had good information and was very interesting.  Packaging was cruddy however the case came broken into little parts.,1264550400,,245,4.926829268292683
7801742,4,1933316322,"If you like to compare religion, like Sufism, Gnosis, Vedanta, Buddhism, etc... you will be surprise how a tradition that has no books written belongs to the same center.
A Masterpiece that deliver a bit of the American  Indian wisdom from the old times to the new times. Thanks to the Tom Yellow Tail inspiration and the tremendous effort of the producers.
 But if I had something to say, I'd like to know if they kill animals to use in their rituals. The DVD just show them praying before cut a tree for the Sun Dance, but nothing about how the buffalo's head and eagle bones whistles comes into the Sun Dance. So, the DVD show just positive aspects of the American Indians.
  I miss the philosophical talks of the elders (the more esoteric aspects of them), normally present in the Black Elk books and the great chiefs talks.
 This DVD is more historical but equally important.
 The DVD delivered on time, good quality and nice price for this priceless product.",1249603200,4,964,4.608187134502924

7801744,5,1933316322,"This movie captures the beauty of Thomas YellowTail & the sacredness of ritual, primarily the sweat lodge & Sundance. This man has saintly qualities. The film is an excellent resource for educational purposes in schools & beyond. Those featured in the film are the ""real deal"". It is rare to witness such an authentic representation of Native American ritual. Even rarer to find this in a well put together package for educational & informative purposes. YellowTail does offer native prayers & a very short understanding of basic words in his native tongue. Beautiful.",1220140800,3,568,5.118279569892473
7801745,5,1933316322,"I highly suggest this DVD set for any gift item you may need this year.  If you appreciate Native American flute music, you need this DVD.  The combination of the narative and film and music is incredible.  Thank you to the directors and producers for a great product!",1179100800,5,268,4.541666666666667
