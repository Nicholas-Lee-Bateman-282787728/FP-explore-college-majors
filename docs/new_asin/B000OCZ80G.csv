2794294,5,B000OCZ80G,"Il Viaggio a Reims has been quite a revelation for me.  I do not particularly fancy Rossini's operas but I have to confess that this one is so delicious to listen at, that no one can resist the temptation of falling in love with it.  It is like a chocolate mousse, ligth and rich at the same time.  The stage production is vibrant, dynamic and innovative.  It is obvious that both the audience and the singers are having a great time.  I loved the closeups of some of the people in the audience, particularly the little boy that looks dazzled by the beauty of Rossini's music.  Highly recommended.  This is healing music at its best.",1242950400,14,633,4.452173913043478
2794295,5,B000OCZ80G,"Scott Morrison places all of us in his debt with his splendid review, with all its background material and the history of this magnificent opera. As a result my own effort is much shorter; essentially ALL it sets out to do is

1. Urge you to buy this DVD.

2. Suggest that when Mr Morrison's review is read along with all the others, it seems somewhat ungenerous of him to stop at four in the star assignment, considering the unique effort that came to consummation in the Chatelet performances. Such manifestations of esprit de corps as we see on this disc, in my judgment, along with all the other qualities on display, demand, require, a five-star review.

3. Share a moment I treasure: Having seen it (and LOVED it) at the New York State Theatre, I went to see the  City Opera's witty and quirky production of IL VIAGGIO when it was revived by the Canadian Opera Company in Toronto. (WHAT a TRAGEDY it is that so many SUPERB NYCO went totally unrecorded, even in an archival format, under the long-standing contract with its union musicians.) (I am a life-long supporter of all trades unions on principle, but sometimes I am appalled at the short-sighted protectionist decisions that are made.) As I left the Hummingbird Centre, I realized that I was right behind the finest music critic of my lifetime - the incomparable Andrew Porter, and I felt the urge to say, ""Can we see ANYthing by Rossini that's better than the production we've just enjoyed?"" He replied, ""Only 'Tell' in a perfect staging, I think."" (Or words to that effect.)

4. Give my opinion that as far as capturing the spirit of Rossini's joie de vivre, the Kirov production is greatly to be preferred to the one from Barcelona. If you can afford only one DVD of ""Il Viaggio"" please go to the disc where the great and generous Gergiev and his protegs have the times of their lives enjoying themselves at the same time as giving us so much to enjoy as well, on disc, whenever we wish to. What wonderful times we live in.",1229299200,15,1989,4.560224089635854

2794297,5,B000OCZ80G,"Simple (even silly) plot, wonderful music. This opera entertains and makes you smile, as can be seen by the faces in the audience.
The music is typical (and great) Rossini. The opera is a product of a big group of very good singers. An opera that has many roles for many singers. The ensembles are just pure musical art.
Gergiev proved that he can do more than Russian composers, and does it exceptionally well. The Russian singers are a joy to listen and watch.
Highly recommended to enjoy good music, good singing and even good acting.",1198627200,7,537,4.604166666666667
2794298,5,B000OCZ80G,"All Russian cast, orchestra and conductor for a Rossini opera? ... not a good forecast until you watch this DVD. REALLY GREAT.

As I have stated in other reviews, for a real good Rossini performance is needed an Italian conductor and hopefully an all italian cast too. I am glad to realize that there are exceptions as is this case. This is a great performance. Gergiev conducting makes the music flow with expertise during the whole opera. The difficulty here is that the orchestra is on the back of the stage so the conductor can not see the singers. But it seems that this did not cause any trouble at all.

The cast are all youg russian singers. Each one performed more than great and higly convincing the difficult roles for the large cast. The only negative point here are some minor diction problems.

The stage is almost empty and what makes the difference here is the eye-catching costumes, some of them very funny including some make up.

The way the stage is designed and the stage direction allows continuous action and gives vitality to the great individual and group performances. It allows interacion with the audience too. All this compensate the empty stage.

This is really the way to perform a comic opera. You will enjoy the music, the singing, the acting, the costumes, and laugh too watching the DVD, and at the same time makes you wish to have been there live. Really a pleasure to watch in all senses. You will not regret to buy it.",1194480000,26,1456,4.6061776061776065
2794299,4,B000OCZ80G,"This is the second DVD of Rossini's 'Il Viaggio a Reims' I've had the good fortune to review. The first, released in 2004, came from the Liceu in Barcelona and although musically pretty good it was tainted by its having been updated, set in 1900 Europe but with back-projections of Hitler's Germany and the Vietnam war. It aimed for 'big thoughts' and considering the silly plot of the opera itself, made little sense and was mildly repellent as a result. My review of that DVD can be read here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rossini-Il-Viaggio-a-Reims/dp/B0002J9TWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rossini - Il Viaggio a Reims</a>.

I shall repeat part of my plot summary from that earlier review:

'Il Viaggio a Reims' is an extremely difficult opera to produce, largely because it requires the services of ten first-class soloists as well as four other singers who can hold their own in the huge ensemble that closes the first part of the opera. It was Rossini's last Italian opera and was, in its time, strictly a pice d'occasion (written for the coronation of France's King Charles X) that he did not expect ever to be staged again; indeed, knowing this he recycled much of the music for his later sparkling French comedy, 'Le Comte Ory.' The piece lay unproduced for almost 200 years before it was mounted at Pesaro, Italy (Rossini's birthplace and the site of the Rossinian Pesaro Festival) in 1984. That production was recorded by Deutsche Grammophon and made a huge splash in the operatic world at the time. (It is still available at Amazon.) It featured such star singers as Katia Ricciarelli, Samuel Ramey, Ruggero Raimondi, Lella Cuberli, Cecilia Gasdia, Lucia Valentini Terrani, Francisco Araiza, Edoardo Gimenez, Leo Nucci and Enzo Dara. And since the plot of the work is structured by Rossini primarily as a showpiece for reigning singing stars of his time, the story-line is weak and simply an opportunity to line up a string of arias, duets, and other ensembles, with no semblance of credibility or dramatic engagement. The plot, simply, is that a group of European nobility and gentry making their way to Reims for the coronation of the French king are stuck in a spa, called the Golden Lily, and cannot make the last leg of the trip because there are no horses and carriages to be hired. They turn their virtual imprisonment there into a house party, with plenty of opportunity for romantic intrigues and self-made entertainment (lots of singing, of course!). Thus, this long one-act opera is rather similar to the 'entertainment' so often provided in Act II of gala productions of 'Die Fledermaus.' As a result, one can say that a recorded or concert performance gives us most of the 'juice' of the piece without the distraction (or enhancement, if you prefer) of the silly plot.

This staging, a joint production of Paris's Thtre Chtelet and St. Petersburg's Mariinsky Theatre, was filmed in 2005 at the Chtelet. The musicians are all Russian: Valery Gergiev leads the Mariinsky Chorus and Orchestra, with soloists from the Academy of Young Singers of the Mariinsky Theatre. Few of the singers are known in the West, although Daniil Shtoda, the tenor singing Count Libenskof, and Larissa Yudina, soprano singing the Countess Folleville, are reasonably well-known now. All the rest of the singers are young, attractive, dramatically apt and mostly quite satisfactory. Their voices do not match those of the classic (and first-ever) recording from the Pesaro Festival, made in 1984. And most of them are perhaps a notch below the singers in the Liceu DVD. But the staging -- or semi-staging, I should say (more about that below) -- is miles ahead of the Liceu's production in terms of it being frothy, humorous and engaging.

The Mariinsky Orchestra is seated at the rear of the Chtelet stage and all the action takes place in front of them. Considering that the singers cannot see Gergiev's baton it is amazing that there are no observable bobbles in musical synchronization. Singers interact in the shallow space in front of the orchestra and on a T-shaped runway that projects out into the auditorium, the latter allowing for some humorous interaction with the audience. The Chorus, acting as stagehands, set in place and then strike the various pieces of scenery and furniture that are required. This minimalist approach actually enhances the generally light-hearted approach to this most light-hearted of Rossini's operas.

Costumes are brightly colored, just slightly exaggerated for effect. Libenskof, dressed in Russian officer's uniform complete with astrakhan, arrives on a white horse and drinking shots of vodka. Countess Folleville is a voluptuously shaped and vacuous bottle-blond with a striking resemblance to Anna Nicole Smith. Corinna, a famous improvising poetess, makes her first appearance in a voluminous feathery costume and headdress, both lit from within; her entrance elicits gales of laughter from the audience. Count Trombonok makes his first appearance by standing up in the trombone section (get it?), holding a trombone. Shots of the audience, including some children, show them to be delighted throughout the show.

 Musical highlights include the marvelous 'gran pezzo concertato a 14 voci' ""Ah! A tal colpo inaspettato"", the duet between Libenskof (Shtoda) and Countess Melibea (Anna Kiknadze), the Sextet 'S, di matti una gran gabbia', and the hilarious finale in which various of the guests sing a song representative of their country of origin. One always hopes that the aria of Don Profondo, 'Medaglie incomparabili' will be as wonderful as Ruggero Raimondi's rendition in the 1984 Pesaro recording, but we are terribly let down here. Still, I prefer this DVD, slightly, to the earlier Liceu version because of the staging. The singers may not, on the whole, be quite as good as those from the Liceu but the dramatic (or, perhaps I should say, comic) effect in this production is superior.

So. If you need a DVD of this bubbly opera, this is probably the one to have, by a small margin over the Liceu production.

8184667,5,B000OCZ80G,"This superb DVD is a delightful version of a long forgotten comic masterpiece by  Rossini.  As is well known, the opera was composed  for the celebrations surrounding the crowning of the new King of France in  1825.  The plot is very modern, however,  in that the characters on their way to the ceremony find that they can't get there from here.  Since the opera quickly fell out of favor because it seemed that Rossini  was insulting the new king, he  put it aside but used some of the best music over again with  a new libretto in one of his last comic operas, The Count Ory (available as it happens on an equally superb DVD  live from the Met featuring Florez, Damrau,  and DiDonato).  The performance of  The Voyage on the DVD under review here  is just about perfect with terrific singing and masterful conducting.  The sets are minimal, but the energy of the young cast of singers more than compensates for the lack of more elaborate staging. The big ensemble numbers in each act are in equal parts delightful and exhilarating.  I find that I like them more and more each time that I watch this performance.  I  cannot recommend this DVD highly enough.  It is a worthy followup for those who already love The Barber of Seville and La Cenerentola.  If you enjoy Rossini,  I think you will love this.",1472947200,,1304,4.530172413793103
8184668,5,B000OCZ80G,"When I bought this DVD I didn't know the opera, neither anyone of the cast. When I started playing it I noticed that a lot of the music was familiar, later I learned that half of this music was used by Rossini in his last opera Le Conte Ori, I was surprised because both plots are completely different and the music with their different lyrics sounds very appropriate beautiful.
I have never seen so many soloists in one single opera and all of then were very good, I found the cast outstanding and enjoyed a lot the arias, duets and ensembles. The setting was simple but good even though it was outdated to a more recent period of time. There were some very funny and tender situations.
The quality of the DVD is very good.",1464566400,,724,4.37037037037037

8184671,5,B000OCZ80G,"This production created by Alain Maratrat was the result of a combined venture shared between the Theatre du Chatelet in France and the Mariinsky Theatre in Russia. It is, in effect a production almost `in the round' with the orchestra on stage behind the singers and therefore literally `seen' as part of the production. The cast make full use of the rest of the stage but also make use of the walkways around the theatre as well as the boxes. All of this is highly involving of the audience which experiences the performance evolving all around it. Needless to say they are suitably entranced by the sheer proximity and impact of the performers.

The performing cast are 15 members of the Academy of Young Singers of the St. Petersburg Mariinsky Theatre to give them their full title. They are, without exception, young, well-trained, enthusiastic and highly entertaining both musically and dramatically. Quite apart from the musical excellence clearly demonstrated throughout, there is a very strong element of humour which is, of course, what this essentially inconsequential tale is all about.

In the circumstances it seems invidious to single out particular soloists from such a talented group and it would be inappropriate to list them all with accompanying comment in a review section such as this. The orchestra is led with his usual concentrated energy by the experienced Valery Gergiev who ensures that plenty of verve and drive is maintained from start to finish.

The recording, made in 2005, was much published as a full HD production by Opus Arte at the time of its release so it comes as no surprise to find that the imaging and sonic values are both excellent in those terms.  The camera work is completely engaging as it must be in such a production as this is and the sound is presented in DTS 5.1 and stereo options. The pity is that Opus Arte has no plans to issue this as a Blu-ray disc which I find astonishing given the initial publicity. I have tried to suggest that they change their minds on this but to no avail at present.

The audience loved this experience and as it transfers well to the small screen it makes very enjoyable viewing. I would expect most future purchasers to be delighted with the production and the performances of the contributions of all the individual members of the cast. A 5 star rating seems totally appropriate therefore.",1352332800,2,2378,4.818627450980392
8184672,5,B000OCZ80G,"I love this opera and this performance by these young Russian singers and musicians.  I just want to echo what has been written earlier by other reviewers.  The ladies in this procuction can not only sing but are very attractive............the blonde soprano steals the show with her singing, stage prescence, and Anna Nicole Smith earthiness!  Highly recommended!",1333497600,,364,5.350877192982456
8184673,4,B000OCZ80G,"No it does not seem like an opera, more of a recital or burlesque. Rossini requires extraordinary talent from at least a dozen lead singers. This is a very good cast who thoroughly enjoyed themselves. You can't help wondering what this could have been with a dream cast like we see in so many of Ponnelle's opera films such as Der Rosencavalier, Barber of Seville, or the Marriage of Figaro. Highly recommended and strange that there are so few performances on DVD.",1301961600,,465,4.682926829268292
8184674,4,B000OCZ80G,"I am entering my opinion on this set rather late in the game. Initially my delay was created by attempting to decide between the Liceu performance and this one; obviously I opted for the Russian/French performance.

That most of us know this work at all is due to its revival at Pesaro and subsequent recording on DGG. In a sense it ""disappeared"" for the greater part of a century and even though Rossini co-opted much of the music of Viaggio for Le Conte Ory, that work had few performances until after WWII. The recording set a very high standard of Rossini singing. Would that there have been cameras present to memorialize the production. It is truly amazing to think that Russia would be able to gather a group of attractive singers who could grasp the style of early 19th century Rossini and for the most part compete with singers from Western Europe who would be more at home with this period. Obviously vocal pedagogy has moved in Russia to a more inclusive embrace of western styles. None of the singers with one exception, have had a presence in houses outside of Russia, the one exception being Danill Shtoda. It should be added that the group of singers assembled for the Liceu production are hardly more ""starry"" or international than what we have at the Chatelet but I gather that neither the production nor the singing can compete with this Opus Arte set.

It would be wonderful if a production could be mounted with the likes Juan Diego Florz, DiDonato, et. al, but finanial constraints being what they are it is hardly likely. In the meantime you can enjoy a highly professional well sung performance of a work that is not likely to come to your nearest megaplex, courtesy of a Met HD production.",1276128000,4,1713,4.65016501650165
8184675,5,B000OCZ80G,"I can't begin to tell you how much fun this opera was to watch.  I absolutely ADORE Rossini (but how can you not???)! This, to me, ranks right up there with Barber, Ermione, etc.  Of course, being a French Lit Ph. D., I also have a soft spot in my heart for this opera, as it was composed for the coronation of Charles X (even if he was quite the bastard, all things considered).  I must agree with Jerry Floyd's review when he says that ""who knew the Russians could have so much fun with Rossini!""  The whole production is a delight.  The interactions with the audience are fun to watch, and even if there is the occasional ""off-note"" as people are singing, we should keep in mind that these are performers from ""The Academy of Young Singers of the St. Petersburg Marinsky Theater"", so they might have a little bit of training/growing up to do, but nevertheless, I'm convinced that these are some names that will become VERY well known in the future.  Larissa Youdina (the Countess of Folleville) in particular bears watching (it's impossible not to smile as she's singing ""che miro, ah, qual sorpreso""), as does Anastasia Belyaeva (Madame Cortese)...Of course I should admit that I'm a sucker for a good coloratura soprano.  Not to neglect the men: they all sing their parts very well.  Overall, I can't recommend this DVD enough, especially since this opera isn't performed all that often, and there aren't too many versions out there.  Great Rossini music, great fun with the singers, what more could you ask for???  Had a bad day? Indulge yourself: get this DVD and have a great night at home with fun opera!",1267228800,3,1613,4.628070175438596

Voices were clear (crystal) orchestra well played and conducted in harmony with the singers. Setting simple, yet innovative. The chorus, young, attractive, and enjoying the interaction between themselves and performers.
The performance involved a modicum of audience participation, and the frequent camera flashes of this audience showed enjoyment and wonder.
A pleasure to watch and listen.
Singing was superb, I did not have a particular favourite, with just one exception, the variation on National Anthem, ingenious.
My recommendation, buy it 'fore the price increases.
