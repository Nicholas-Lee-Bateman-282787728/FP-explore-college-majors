Some good points however do come out, but by no means a Prep. and paint video that will get you comfortable to go ahead and paint your first tank. Goodeve does try, but too fast.",1412121600,,313,4.413793103448276
8037958,1,B00063QD9S,"I was expecting a soup to nuts video of detailed motorcycle tank painting. It is very incomplete and makes assumptions that you already know everything about paint reducers, paint gusn and airbrushes. Not a very complete guide. To be called complete, it should have some details regarding paint selection, color systems, reducers..etc... There is nothing at all about those important details. I'd pass this video by...",1301529600,,418,5.348484848484849
8037959,5,B00063QD9S,"An excellent video, Vince shows the basic from prepping a tank to a great looking graphic. Covering the use of Blue line, masking material, how to use over spray, and marbleizer. This technique is what you see under kandies and looks great on it's own. If you're looking to paint motorcycle tanks or a different graphic ideal, this is a great DVD to get. I'd recommend any of Vince other DVD's.",1113091200,2,394,4.563380281690141
8037960,5,B00063QD9S,"The DVD delivers exactly what it says, a guide to painting helmets. Watching this guy work makes the airbrush look like it the easiest thing in the world to use.

This Dvd is a very practicle guide (monkey see, monkey do)",1106006400,3,221,4.390243902439025
