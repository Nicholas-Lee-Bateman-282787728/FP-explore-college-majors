8578303,3,B00C7OB67S,"As is typical of many Troma releases ""Open 24/7"" features a healthy dose of black humor mixed in with its' over the top gore.  The first thing to note about this film is that you need to turn on the sub-title option at start-up because this twisted little flik was filmed in France w/ french language throughout (with the exception of a couple of songs sung in English)and some German! in the third segment.

The format of the movie centers around an open-all-the-time diner wherein several of the patrons, and the waitress/owner, spin tales of a horrific nature to 'pass the time'. There are 3 vignettes included - all featuring. principally. female protagonists performing the dastardly deeds described & depicted.

The first 'story' tells the tale of a pair of disaffected lesbian lovers who lure men into their realm to dine upon them as they are being 'hunted' by a police officer who was one of their 'victims' who survived, but lost his masculine member to one of them!  - the second, darkly comedic, yarn plays out like a demented fairy tale with a cannibalistic ogress who feeds on children - and the third chronicles a pair of sexually abused sisters from the provences who journey to the 'wicked' city in an attempt to 'follow their dream', with less than stellar results. There is a definite underlying tone of dark satirical humor throughout that is fun, but also a few attempts at blatant parody (such as Troma kingpin Lloyd Kaufman's gratuitous cameo) that fall a little flat.

Over-all though, this film presents a rather unique combination of sex and horror that is perhaps more prevalent in Euro horror offerings.  It reminded me of a similar filmic trilogy of sex/horror I snagged recently via Amazon entitled ""Little Deaths"" - wherein 3 individual British horror directors teamed up to make a similar 3 part anthology. It is a niche genre potentially ripe for exploration!

I found ""Open 24/7 to be an enjoyable (albeit BENT) viewing experience.  Due to the brevity of the segments, there was not a lot of detailed character development but the stories were engaging and moved right along to satisfying (if somewhat nebulous) shocking conclusions.  This is definitely 'adults only' fare - featuring extreme gore fx, some nudity, and salty language.  IF you enjoy the TROMA style of cinema I would rank this as one of their better pieces!  The disk contains the usual bunch of Troma-esque 'background' extras & trailers. Worth a look!",1376956800,2,2453,4.886746987951807
8578304,3,B00C7OB67S,"This is perhaps best described as a French ""Creep Show"" Troma style. The addition of Lloyd Kaufman in this film at the beginning and near the end was a big negative. The film consists of three people telling stories in a diner that involves, slashers, cannibalism, and perverted fairy tales. At times I thought the stories were very good, with well written dark comedy, while other times it was just junk.

The tales include blood splatter, severed body parts, child abuse, and sausage humor. This feature is clearly not for everyone. English subtitles.
