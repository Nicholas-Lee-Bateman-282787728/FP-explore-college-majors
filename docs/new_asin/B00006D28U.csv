1742566,5,B00006D28U,"Elvira is back! After such a long time away, she returns to the big screen in a hilarious spoof of the old Corman/Vincent Price films of the 60's. Great setting, and hilarious storyline. This has become a favourite of mine. Would recommend it to everyone in the mood for a good laugh.",1035072000,2,284,4.480769230769231
1742567,3,B00006D28U,"This program is an intentional burlesque of several famous horror movies and actors.  It is much less intellectual and more physical compared to the previous Mistress of the Dark movie.  That is, it is more like Benny Hill and less like Monty Python.  Gratuitous sex is as frequent as gratuitous violence in a James Bond movie.  Elvira frequently gets her chest contacted by people's faces and hands.  For me the best part of the video was the interview with the actress who to me is more appealing than the character she plays.",1034726400,2,528,4.695652173913044
1742568,3,B00006D28U,"Right off, I should say that I'm a big Elvira fan. I've always enjoyed her tongue-in-cheek,  Mae-Westish humor and I liked her first movie a lot. Furthermore, when I was young I greatly enjoyed the old Roger Corman / Vincent Price movies that this spoofs.
That said, I have to say that ""Elvira's Haunted Hills"" is a pretty thin offering; it feels more like a series of skits than a real movie. And at 50, Cassandra Peterson is just a wee bit old to be playing the vamp. In some of the close-up shots she really looks pretty haggard.  After watching ""Haunted Hills"" I really feel like I've had my lifetime supply of Elvira!
Still, if you like Elvira, and are old enough to remember the Corman/Price movies, it's worth watching.. and be sure to watch the ""making of"" featurette too!",1034467200,8,780,4.524822695035461
1742569,4,B00006D28U,"Finally! After 14 years, Elvira's second feature film debuts. It's quite different from her first, but equally entertaining. Setting out to spoof some of her favorite horror films, Cassandra Peterson and her writing partner John Paragon fuse elements of the classic Roger Corman/Vincent Price/Edgar Allen Poe films The House of Usher, The Pit and the Pendulum and The Tomb of Ligea into a campy farce - perfect fodder for Elvira's unique talents.
Elvira recruited Rocky Horror's Richard O'Brien as her co-star, and he gives a great performance as Lord Hellsubus. Rounding out the cast are several members of L.A.'s Groundlings comedy troupe, Mary Scheer and Mary Jo Smith. Heather Hopper is terrific as Hellsubus's doomed sister, and Scott Atkinson does an amazing job as the two faced doctor with both an aristocratic and cockney British accent.
The sets are enormous and detailed. The cinematography is virtually flawless, and there are several very well done special effects (and Elvira comments on them in the film...). Of course, Elvira's campy quips and physical humor are the stars of the show. There's also a great running gag with the stableman's bad English dubbing. All in all, this is a long overdue and highly enjoyable adventure. Well worth checking out, especially if you enjoy Elvira's first film, or if you're a fan of the Roger Corman Poe films. You might also want to read the Elvira series of paperbacks(if you can find them...), also written by Cassandra Peterson and John Paragon...Elvira Transylvania 90210, Elvira Camp Vamp, and Elvira The Boy Who Cried Werewolf....they are a lot of fun too.",1033603200,19,1616,5.10188679245283
1742570,5,B00006D28U,"""Elvira's Haunted Hills"" is a knowingly cheesy, hilarious comedy starring that wacky Mistress of the Dark.  Not only is this movie better than the first, but it also features another show-stopping musical number and wacky supporting characters.  The scenes toward the end of the film get a bit darker in tone than the rest of the movie (especially when characters begin getting killed off and we begin learning ""family secrets""), but this odd mix of comedy and horror works surprisingly well.  Highly Recommended!!!",1033603200,3,515,5.180722891566265
1742571,4,B00006D28U,"see Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.  But if you see two, see this one (considering there only are two, lol).  Anyway, first off let me just say I love Elvira.  I think she is one of the greatest drag queens that lived.  I am so thrilled to finally see her back in another feature-length film where she could shine.  I waited over a year for this thing to come home on video, seeing as it is an independant movie and had a very limited release.  Well it finally came home on Oct. 1 2002...and was it worth the wait?  Well...for me...being an Elvira fan, yes!  The movie is filled with plenty of one liners although not as memorable or quite on the timing as her previous outing.  I felt like some of the jokes kept falling ""flat""...but there are a few good ones in there to ""perk"" up the humor...like the guy whose voiced is dubbed and never matches up with his lip movements...and the musical number was pretty good too.  There is also a bit of gore in this outing...but nothing to strong...just a guy cut in half... and a decapitation.
I was also glad to see Rocky Horror icon, Richard O'Brien back on screen...how I've missed him.  I actually recognized a few of the key actors...like Uni Brow from Austin Powers 2 and an Ex-cast member from Mad Tv..the one who did Fran Drescher...When Babies Attack...lol.  Anyway...I think you owe it to yourself to see this movie just because it came out just in time for Halloween...and everyone needs a little Elvira for Halloween..she is an icon!
Notes on the DVD edition, I liked the Making of featurette...it lasted 22 minutes and had plenty of behind-the-scenes clips and interviews...you learned a lot about how the movie was made...it's not just an extended commerical like most DVD featurettes tend to be.  You also get a photo gallery, an on-set interview with Richard O'Brien and a Theatrical(?) Trailer.  For 15 bux...well worth the buy. Unpleasant dreams!",1033516800,,1905,4.630952380952381
1742572,5,B00006D28U,"Wow, just saw this film in Boston, with Cassndra Peterson hosting.  A fun romp that harkened back to the days of the 1960's haunted house thrillers starring Vincent Price (to whom the film is dedicated).
Elvira stumbles upon Castle Helsebus with her french maid, Zou Zou.  Once there, she discovers that everyone is freaked out by her uncanny resemblance to the late Mistress of the house, Elura.
That's the setup, and the rest of the film delivers campy sights and sounds and some great laughs.  The castle's ""Stable Stud"" is hilarious, as is Richard O'Brien from ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" who suffers from the same sensitive malady as Roderick Usher from ""The Fall of the House of Usher"".
The film was shot on location in Transylvania and Budapest, to lend authenticity to its roots.
If you are an Elvira fan, or remember the ""Creature Double Feature"" films that this movie is spoofing, then this would be well worth your while to check out.",1033257600,2,945,4.785276073619632
1742573,5,B00006D28U,"After a long (13 years) absence since her first motion picture (1988's Elvira, Mistress of the Dark) the wise cracking horror hostess is back. Now it's the mid 19th Century, the setting Transylvania, the star none other than Elvira. While en route to Paris, to star in ""Yes, I Can Can,"" Elvira and her robust French maid Zou Zou find themselves in creepy mysterious castle Helsebus.
  A foolish choice to hitch a ride on a stage coach lands them in Weird Central, where the family is cursed, the Master of the House (played by Rocky Horror's Richard O'Brien) is a lunatic, and Elvira apparently bears a striking (like a frying pan across the head) resemblance to the House's late lady, Elura who was said to have committed suicide exactly ten years to the day. However one is lead to believe foul play was involved, that one happens to be Elvira.
  Can Elvira survive this creepy castle and its inhabitants for two full days and nights? Will she escape and make it to Paris? Or will she suffer the same fate of Elura Helsebus?
---
  This movie pays fiendishly fun homage to the old Corman/Poe, Vincent Price flicks of the 1950's. Complete with dramatic sets, secret passages, curses, wall entombment and even a pit complete with full swinging (and actually dangerous just ask Elvira) pendulum.
  While Elvira fans will find this gothic romp a hilarious hay ride, non Elvira fans are sure to find something to enjoy. Besides Elvira's gravity defying pair this movie actually proves to hold up against today's market of CGI laden movies, with Hollywood big names and multi million dollar budgets.
  All said and done, Elvira's Haunted Hills are definitely worth surveying. Mr. Price would be proud.",1030320000,54,1696,4.817241379310345

1742629,5,B00006D28U,"I love Elvira, she's campy and funny. And doesn't take yourself too seriously. Which is why I actually was surprised how good this will be was considering how long it was from her first feature film.  To this one. But apparently time doesn't mean anything to this woman. A virus haunted hills is extremely funny and if you are somebody who likes more of the cult classics, obscure films then you'll recognize some of this cast. And I don't want to say anything by what I meant by that, but there are definitely some underground superstars in this film.

The film takes place and of course,  Transylvania. Where 05 up and her assistant are on the way to France so she can get to her next gig and I'll completely stuck in the middle of nowhere. And I would stay with this unusual family.  If I am leave that a semi reminiscent of the old universal studios classic monster movies characters, i.e. Frankenstein, Dracula, the bride of Frankenstein  Etc.

1742645,5,B00006D28U,"so here i am once again, doing my bit to counteract the world in general's anti-sequel sentiments. it's a never-ending job.
okay, so some sequels weren't worth it, but we've had as many worthy ones. i don't just mean the entertaining pictures which, due to preconceived prejudices, get dumped upon solely for being sequels (Ghostbusters II, Indiana Jones & The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull). surely such renown specimens as The Godfather Part II, The Empire Strikes Back, Superman II, and The Two Towers/The Return Of The King are proof enough that it can be done. sequels which find a new angle and so manage to bring something new to the party go back at least as far back as Bride Of Frankenstein.
what's more, at least one sequel, A Shot In The Dark, represents the moment the franchise found it's path. it's predecessor, The Pink Panther, isn't a horrible film by any means, but it's sophisticated ""heist farce"" nature is a few dozen miles removed from the lunacy-for-lunacy's-sake for which the films tend to be remembered. so much so, in fact, that technically speaking, Inspector Clouseau is the villain!
even so,  Elvira's Haunted Hills is something quite unique, at least in my experience: a wonderful sequel to a first installment that just plain reeked!
1988's Elvira: Mistress Of the Dark finds our heroine coming to a Massachusetts town which turns out to be stranded in the conservative proprieties of the '50s. the setup has it's moments as Elvira's uniquely sassy irreverence squares off against a tradition of stodgy bigotry. the problem is that it turned out to be such a one-note joke, as Elvira's free spirit (and/or gorgeous melons) shocks the status-quo again and again and again. it's denouement, involving her redemption of her family's history of witchcraft feels, like an afterthought. to say nothing of her dream of an act in Vegas, which results in the most embarrassingly schmaltzy finishes any film was ever cursed with.
in a nutshell, Cassandra Peterson clearly wasn't sure how to best serve her alter-ego in a movie, and made the mistake of (mostly) removing her from her schlock-horror element. it felt out of proportion because so larger-than-life a character doesn't really need such a cesspool of opinionated puritanism to make an impression. any place that isn't a Hollywood or a Las Vegas would do, really.
this film, on the other hand, is the work of someone who learned her lesson from that fiasco. it is described more than once in the special features as the Young Frankenstein of Roger Corman and/or Edgar Allan Poe movies and/or Hammer Films productions. that alone is infinitely reassuring. add Richard ""Riff Raff"" O'Brien to the mix, and things look even higher up.
the story finds our heroine, a diva entertainer in 1850s Europe, trying to get from Carpathia to Paris for a gig. en route she gets entangled with the Hellsubus family, a clan of eccentrics at the mercy of an ancient curse. of course the aforementioned O'Brien takes the part that was once the specialty of Vincent Price, the Lord who's reason is being worn away by said curse.
that the film delivers is all the more remarkable given the elements working against it. we film fans hear often that the moviemaking process is a tightrope at the best of times, but this one faced a particularly treacherous obstacle course. it's reported in special features how, for instance, on-location shooting took place in less than hospitable territory, and how they were unable to obtain insurance for actors, crew, or equipment.
the bottom line, this is the movie Cassandra/Elvira should've made in the first place. the only bummer is that it took more than a dozen years. where the first film comes off as the vanity project of a celebrity with a few too many ""yes-men,"" Haunted Hills found a formula that could've made for a viable franchise. it's a truly promising setup for a series that never was. why Peterson didn't follow it up is for anyone to surmise, but either way it's a bummer.",1488844800,3,3992,4.870588235294117

I loved Elvira's role and her iconic look; she was pleasing as usual, and her maid companion was adorable.

1742727,4,B00006D28U,"I was looking for an entertainment that didn't require too much thought, and opted to rent  Elvira's latest. It was all I expected, and, in some ways, more. The extras explain that the studio didn't want a sequel (to Elvira, Mistress of the Dark), so Ms Peterson and company decided to make an Indie film of their own. It was made for $1M, and filmed in Romania.

Cassandra and director, Sam Irvin, wanted to to an homage/parody of their favorite director, Roger Corman, and the result is loads of smarmy fun. I can't dislike anything about it, knowing the trials of getting it produced, but even if I didn't, the film lives up to the Elvira legacy.

The whole cast buys in to the silliness, especially Mary Jo Smith, as Zou Zou, her hapless servant. Gabi Andronache didn't speak a word of English, but was so good for the role, they dubbed his lines (the Steve Reeves/Hercules effect). Along for the ride is Richard O'Brien (Rocky Horror Picture Show). The silly Pit & Pendulum subplot is reason to give Elvira some trashy lines and insane banter.

1742765,4,B00006D28U,"Better than her first film, even though it was funded by Cassandra herself. She made her money back I'm sure. The commentary describes how many things fell into place to save money and hassle including a brother-in-law who is actually from Transylvania, well he's Romanian at least, so he helped with all sorts of connections.
But this a movie review, so here it is...I love the movie. It seems more like Elvira as she really is characterized, not the way a Hollywood producer would sell her.
It is a ""faithful"" parody of three Vincent Price movies by the same director Roger Corman. This one stars the actor who played ""Riffraff""? in the Rocky Horror Picture Show. He is spot on his character and was delighted to do the film...with some of his own costume.
It's Elvira as a full character, not just a horror movie host.

1742793,2,B00006D28U,"I had a difficult time rating ""Elvira's Haunted Hills."" I am a fan of Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) and a fan of the Corman/Price/Poe films this movie spoofs and pays homage to. My problem with the film is principally that Elvira is great as a hostess or in relatively short linking bits, but the gags wear off rather quickly in a feature length film (and this one is inferior to ""Elvira: Mistress of the Dark"" from 13 years previous.) I give her full credit for making this as an independent feature and self-financing it; there's no doubt she worked very hard on it as did many others including director Sam Irvin. For cost reasons the film was actually made in Transylvania and the locations do work very well for the film; considering the budget the sets look absolutely amazing and account in large part for the positive visual impression the film makes. The film features ""Rocky Horror's"" Richard O'Brien in a creepy starring role, as well as some lesser-known actors who all give it their best shot. The problem for me is that the material is wearisome.

The film opens in the Carpathian mountains in 1851 with Elvira and her bungling, unfunny handmaiden Zou Zou (Mary Jo Smith) trying to get to Paris to further Elvira's singing career. Of course they are promptly given a ride to a creepy castle by Dr. Bradley Bradley (Scott Atkinson, and yes that character name gives you just some idea of the hilarity contained in the film.) Opening with great subtlety and nuance with an enormous sausage and foot fetishism, the film proceeds apace through completely expected jokes and situations (Elvira on the rack, etc....oh, my ribs,) to a conclusion that may remind some of ""The Pit and the Pendulum,"" the 1961 Corman classic shot in 15 days which is in all ways the better movie. To be fair, the filmmakers completely acknowledge that this is a tribute to that and other Corman films, so that shouldn't be a surprise. That the spoof wasn't more entertaining is the problem here. (Quick! Can anyone guess what body part of Elvira's gets scratched by the blade of the pendulum? Find out in the extras if you really can't figure it out.) The film closes with an amusing miniature shot of the castle that will remind many of a pivotal scene from ""Titanic"" in one of the better directorial choices in the film while simultaneously economizing heroically on the special effects bill.

I actually don't have many issues with Irvin's direction, as I don't think a significantly better film could have been made from this script on a $1,000,000 budget. The underlying flaw in the film is that the premise of Elvira's repetitive, bawdy sense of humor is not enough to drive a feature film. As a fan, it pains me to say that, but it really is true. Though there were some funny lines of dialogue in the movie (""Who listens to the Village People anymore?"") the film is occasionally amusing, but offers up vast swaths of tedium. The introductory coach ride is as funny as it gets: once in the castle the humor grinds to a halt. The reprise of the coach scene at the end is a nice touch, but frankly nothing here offers any surprises.

Now that I have made my general disappointment clear, I do want to commend Peterson and company for the surprising number of extras included on the DVD. These were in most cases more interesting and entertaining than the film itself (except the brief and pointless outtakes) with the short feature ""Transylvania or Bust"" being quite captivating. I liked Peterson and Irvin a lot in the extras and hearing their recollection of the trials and tribulations of the production process gave me much more appreciation for the film (and scored the film its second star in my rating.) Peterson is clearly quite intelligent (I didn't expect a catalepsy joke here!) and this was clearly a labor of love for her. I genuinely feel bad for awarding it only two stars, but it just fell short on the comic spoof scale. As much as I did like Irvin and Peterson, I found some of the other cast member interviews highly annoying, particularly Mary Jo Smith who came across as hugely whiny (complaining about a fear of heights, lack of porter service, a long flight in coach, that the winter in Romania was cold, etc.) Maybe she was just having a bad day when the interview was done because she did emphasize how much she enjoyed doing the film, but the complaining got old fast in her interview shots.

""Elvira's Haunted Hills"" is a movie with a premise and plot readily apparent to anyone who has seen Elvira once in their lives. I genuinely appreciate that they set out to make a spoof of the old Roger Corman and Vincent Price horror films of yesteryear; I only wish it had been a better movie.",1417219200,3,4703,4.649038461538462

Plus CP and the others who made this film are true devotees to the schlocky  dramatic style of the 1950-60's Roger Corman and Vincent Price school of film.

Can the Mistress of the Dark free herself from the evil forces that have drawn her here? This thwarted production was a labor of love by Elvira star and creator Cassandra Peterson, who set off to revive the character on an independent budget this second time around. While it may not stack up to her first film, there is certainly enough raunchy humor and wackiness to keep her fans more than entertained. Placing the character in a period setting is a brilliant move on her behalf, and the Gothic backdrop frequently references the classic Corman pictures from AIP. Elvira's clever wit has mostly been replaced with sharp, cynical humor and cheap slapstick, however. Even her bulging bustline can't help save her from the Pit and the Pendulum in the film's grand finale! A cult-classic only amongst fans, but otherwise good for a few guilty laughs.

The humor relies mostly on corny jokes, slapstick, and jokes about Elvira's chest and sexual appetite. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) shows off her cleavage and unfortunately her age, reminding me of a combination of Mae West and Cher.

Elvira and her traveling companion (Mary Jo Smith) end up in a castle where they pay tribute to a couple of Poe tales. The film is dedicated to Vincent Price who performed those tales rather well. Adrian, The stable man (Gabi Andronache) voice was terribly dubbed as part of the humor.

The humor is aimed at male adolescent. I found the humor to be to stale and corny to be funny.

In it we find parodies of creepy characters one would find in an old Vincent Price movie. While not Shakespeare, it IS Poe to a degree, with allusions to several of his stories.

1742898,4,B00006D28U,"The ten year anniversary edition of ELVIRA'S HAUNTED HILLS is an absolute must for fans - and many others too for that matter! Besides the gorgeous new print of this amazing camp parody there is a myriad of reasons why you'd want to own the new enhanced edition; mainly for the entirely new revealing and interesting featurettes that provide some awesome behind the scenes making of gossip behind Elvira's second feature film.

ELVIRA'S HAUNTED HILLS was made in Transylvania on a cobweb of a budget of a $1 million dollars in 1999 (or was it 2000?), as compared to the big studio ELVIRA MISTRESS OF THE DARK which cost $14 million back in 1987. You wouldn't have known it as the films sets, look, and atmosphere that was captured often excels Elvira's first feature and more than matches the films it pays homage to in gothic grandure. What has unfortunitely been missed by the casual fan and audience member who are not familiar with the source material from which it is pulled from is how well ELVIRA'S HAUNTED HILLS pays a campy homage to the Vincent Price, Roger Corman, Edgar Allen Poe films of the 1960s. To have the Elvira character forever imprinted in the 1850's period composite of the story/themes is absolutely perfect - the brilliance of this idea and how well it was pulled together often tragically goes unreconized to most viewers.

With all the new special features we learn of the many details, drama, and delirium that enshrowded this crazy cauldron of comedy. While it was mostly exciting and fun for the cast and crew we learn it was most strenuous for its star Cassandra (Elvira) Peterson. This being an independant venture meant that she wore many hats (witches no doubt!), and her work load never stopped as she was the producer, financier, writer, casting agent, Star, and a little of everything else. She manages all this on too little sleep, a chronic respiratory condition, and a poor diet consisting of potatoes and cabbages - all the while pulling off this labor of love and still managing to look fabulous all the time. She was 48 or 49 when she shot this and her loveliness and classic humor are still in full swing here; even more than even her most famous (and 100% natural) assets. Despite the maddness of the experience ""Cassandra & Crew"" created a terrific picture and it is all the more worthwhile in its new special enhanced edition. Much is to be admired here and spending time with the cast and crew was most entertaining, funny and informative to this often under appreciated adventure. While ELVIRA'S HAUNTED HILL'S isn't as consistantly funny or as outrageous as its predecessor, this outing is still most wonderful and is a complete must for the fans - and then some - HAPPY HALLOWEEN EVERYONE !!!!!",1320019200,27,2745,4.752620545073375
1742899,4,B00006D28U,"Brett Cullum, DVD Verdict --This edition features a brand new mastered visual and audio transfer that look and sound amazing. Elvira's Haunted Hills excels in design and cinematography, so it is nice to see a clear and accurate representation of the picture at its strongest. Colors are a touch vibrant on purpose as if the feature were treated for technicolor. It looks great and fun. Sound design includes the original stereo as well as a full surround track for elaborate home systems. Amazing to think this film cost 1 million to make rather than the 14 million spent on her studio film, because it looks and sounds just about on par with the earlier work.

The extras are overflowing, just like the top of Elvira's best dresses. A commentary track kicks thing off and includes Elvira herself, director Sam Irvin, as well as some of the supporting actors including Mary Scheer, Mary Jo Smith, and Scott Atkinson. It's a great listen with plenty about the production and what they were paying homage to. The original trailer is included. There is a ""tell-all"" featurette with the cast and crew talking about the project, which looks like it was recorded recently. Elvira appears as Cassandra Peterson for this, and she spills the beans on how everything went down. Also included is a making-of featurette that further explores the origins of Elvira's Haunted Hills; this was recorded a few years ago, probably for the original DVD. Thankfully we get an on-set interview with Richard O'Brien proving he is just as crazy as you'd expect. There are outtakes, which mainly include Elvira forgetting her lines and cursing like a truck driver as a result. A photo gallery showcases the publicity shots. Also gathered together are a whole collection of sneak previews of the first season of the revival of Movie Macabre

It's interesting that Elvira found a way to make a sequel to her 1988 feature thirteen years later by running off to Transylvania with Richard O'Brien. It's even better that she decided to make a smart and campy take on the Vincent Price and Roger Corman flicks from the sixties. It's a cool idea to insert the Mistress of the Dark into a film that she'd be making fun of if it were screened on Movie Macabre. Fans of Elvira will find plenty to love, and non-fans will probably not even make it past the opening credits anyways. This is a great little package which offers plenty of extras which easily eclipses the previous release, so an upgrade is in order. Elvira's Haunted Hills has never looked better and it has aged very well. This one is perfect for Halloween or any time you want a black comedy about a showgirl schlepping through a haunted castle. Elvira knows what her audience wants, and she delivers it all without any hesitation or apology. It's all just a knowing wink, a jiggle, and an impeccable knowledge of camp cult horror that gels perfectly.

However, what is most impressive about this outing isn't Elvira's one-liners. It's the fact that the movie looks and feels authentically like a 1950's-1960's horror movie, particularly House on Haunted Hill and The Pit And The Pendulum.

1742906,5,B00006D28U,"For those not in the know, ELVIRA is the amazing creation of actress extraordinaire CASSANDRA PETERSON!!! Die hard fans have been waiting for a second vehicle for sooo long and will be rewarded with this wonderfully wacky parody/tribute of the 1960's Corman/Poe/Price horror films. ELVIRA'S HAUNTED HILLS is not a sequel to the much beloved 1988 camp classic ELVIRA MISTRESS OF THE DARK, but rather an entirely new an equally fulfilling celuloid romp. I find ELVIRA'S HAUNTED HILLS 1851 Carpathia the perfect realm for ELVIRA to be forever cemented in. We find our heroine surrounded in Gothic atmosphere haunting the same fogged hallways she used to host on MOVIE MACABRE, all the while spoofing too many Comedy/Horror genres and cliches to count. ELVIRA's in top form both physically and comically; as her impecable line delivery and enchanting gorgeous animated face once again crown her THE QUEEN OF HALLOWEEN - not to mention the humor genre Camp! The film has some hilarious moments and is a brilliant homage to the above mentioned people, films, and stories. Made on a shoestring budget and filmed in Romania; this movie nonetheless has some stricking sets, interesting location work, and a emotive soundtract featuring the Russian State Orchestra. We find ELVIRA on route to ""gay paree"" so she can do her ""Yes I Can-Can"" review with her French Maid only to get stranded at a haunted castle. There we have the crazed Lord of the castle (Richard O'Brian), his evil wife, his past dead wife who just happens to look exactly like ELVIRA, a Stable Stud, witty dialogue, and that rather nasty pit and pendulum in the dungeon. Sucked into a tornado of family disfunson, will Elvira and her French Maid ever get out of the creepy castle with their lives!?! My only resurvation about this work is that at times it could have a little more bite, and that the secend half needs a little more infusion of humor admits all the drama. Despite these minor grievances ELVIRA'S HAUNTED HILLS does have plenty going for it, and I think will please please her radically diverse fanbase. I just love this film and find it a hell of alot of fun - so I strongly recommend it to anyone who's in a campy silly cheeze-ball sort of mood! I'm gratful that it was ever made at all, as sadly the ELVIRA character has only stared in two featured films. Grossly underused by the Hollywood establishment, I can't help but think of all the great ""Camp Extravaganzas"" she could have done already that we could be enjoy today. On the sunny side enjoy the two films of hers we do have and let ELVIRA'S HAUNTED HILLS bring a little laughter into your world - UNPLEASANT DREAMS !!!!!",1270166400,3,2653,4.75704989154013

Rocky Horror Picture Show's Richard O'Brien whines and mugs for the camera too much as he plays Lord Vladimere Hellsubus.

The supporting cast of semi unknowns ham it up for camera with bit gags that are hit or miss.

1742926,4,B00006D28U,"When I first rented this over the weekend, I thought it was bad. I expected something more like Elvira's Mistress of the Dark movie, which is fabulous. However, as I started looking at the special features of this film, I realized what the film was trying to accomplish and the budget that they worked with and it was actually a very good film when looked at this way.

Haunted Hills is a parody of old Vincent Price/Roger Corman movies. If you are a fan of old-school horror, this film will make so much more sense for you. Because I had not seen these movies when watching the film I was ready to trash it even though I generally love Elvira!

My only qualm was the scenes with Elvira and the stable-hand, Adrian. They wanted to make a joke about dubbed movies (and coincidentally the actor did not speak a word of English) so he spoke all of his lines in his native Romanian tongue and while it was funny in the first scene they had together, I got frustrated with it by the end of the movie. I kept hoping he would suddenly start speaking in English though I was amused that they kept the bit going through the whole film (then I learned that there was a good reason for it!).

I think part of the difference between this film and the last one is that the first film probably had a higher budget. Some of the actors were working on no budget/low budget as a favor to Cassandra and the director. Having financial support can go a long way into the quality of a film.

That being said, this has got plenty of Elvrira and lots of boob jokes and boob shots. The performance by the actor playing Dr. Bradley Bradley was very good and I also enjoyed the actress playing Lady Hellsebus. I also liked the costumes, though there were different period styles combined together.

So, if you are looking for a very contemporary horror-esque comedy you are not going to get this movie. It's very cliche because it really is trying to be very cliche. Once you understand that, the movie will be so much more enjoyable.",1136592000,19,2008,4.401617250673854
1742927,4,B00006D28U,"On the surface this is a spoof of the films made by Roger Corman and other directors who worked in the genre during the same period. There are direct references to ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" and ""The House of Usher"" as well as less direct references to films such as ""The Raven"" and ""The Comedy of Terrors"". The overall ""look"" of the film resembles those films and the work that came out of Hammer Studios during the same period but does so without looking like an imitation of them. With its rich textures and lush colours its appearance is never less than striking.

The performances from most of the supporting cast are all way over the top. Scott Atkinson is hilarious in the role of the doctor, Bradley Bradley. Everything he comes out with seems as if it's sucked from his chest and thrown at the camera. The way his accent changes as his role in the proceedings becomes more defined is a brilliant touch. Mary Scheer performs her role as the adulteress as if she were a classic comic book villain, the type whose passion burns most brightly when she's manipulating everyone around her to the max. Elvira's character makes an excellent foil for her. Heather Hopper's portrayal as the sickly Roxanna (part whooping cough, part ""Night of the Living Dead"" stiff and full time punching bag for the rest of the cast) is a howl. The notion of dubbing in the dialogue spoken by Gabriel Andronache (who reportedly speaks next to no English) was a brilliant one. The first scene between him and Peterson is one for the books. Richard O' Brien has a role that that demands all the pork from Ham Central, and it's one that he appears to have relished playing. The scenes he shares with Peterson appear to have been a joy for both of them.

The excesses of most of the performances are balanced by the understated work from Peterson and Mary Jo Smith. Smith is absolutely adorable as Zou Zou, Elvira's much-abused maid. She plays the role with a combination of dry wit, self-depreciation and vulnerability that can't help but strike a chord. Peterson plays the ""Elvira"" character with her usual flair. That mix of impish playfulness and canny intellect combined with sweet innocence, brazen sexuality and doltish buffoonery that made the character a cult classic is wholly intact. Her comic timing remains razor sharp.

There's far more to the film though. It goes past the obvious to address (and skewer) a variety of topics. Richard O' Brien's soliloquies put the most overblown passages of Shakespearean Theatre to shame. The dubbing in foreign action films takes a hit or three. The way the use of accents is often bungled by actors and filmmakers is harpooned in a way that's wonderfully original. The ""special effects"" used for the cataclysmic moment of the film look as if they were intended to be worse than things Ed Wood would've come up with (though it doesn't quite hit that mark). Aging women who cram killer bodies under thick layers of paint (makeup) and thin layers of tight clothing spend parts of the film taking one hit after another.

There's no doubt the reigning Queen of Vamp Camp is showing her age. But she's using it to great advantage. The character seems older. Her sexuality is more overt. She has less patience for playing at being coy. She works too hard to be the centre of attention. She doesn't miss any chances to show her ""assets"". The camera captures the physical side of things. One of the most revealing of them highlights the ways gravity works on an aging figure regardless of how well it's been taken care of, and it happens early in the film as if to make sure all the viewers take note her of age. Peterson is far too intelligent not to have noticed it but she left it in.

If anyone is the right person to be spoofing the foibles of aging vamps it's Cassandra Peterson. She's old enough to be one of those characters in day-to-day life and she would look great in any of the outfits they pour themselves into. More importantly, she understands any subject matter she touches thoroughly, addresses it without meanness or cynicism and applies a measure of balance to it in the process. She jabs Zou Zou for her looks but makes sure that character is the first to light a fire under somebody's libido. The man with the dubbed-in-lines may look silly because his mouth doesn't match his words but he gets the girl. The aging vamp may fall in holes because she's wearing heels instead of runners the way those vamp wannabees would but the male characters still can't keep their hands off her. It all works because of Peterson's charm and because of the balanced overview she brings to the subject matter.

This is a picture that may find its wider audience in years to come. It's played as camp in a way that may alienate a lot of viewers and there's no doubt a lot of the jokes are lame. But that's all done intentionally. Essentially, it's a good movie that's made to look as if it was bad. Don't be fooled. There's a lot there to stimulate thought and enough light fun to make it easy to keep going back for another look. Today's dog (though it's anything but one) may be one of tomorrow' classics.

1742938,5,B00006D28U,"I loved it. It had a lot of quirky on-liners, nothing spectacular. But it was still funny. Elvira does her best at acting, and this movie fits her so well. She is more human, and less morbid. Haunted Hills, is a parody of old Roger Corman and Vincent Price films.

The axe scene is funny. I love this movie. It's very entertaining.",1117670400,2,331,4.338709677419355
1742939,5,B00006D28U,"First off,I have been a fan of Elvira's since her first movie ""Elvira Mistress of the Dark"" came out.  I have always admired the spunky character.  I told a guy I was dating once that Elvira was my hero and he replied back to me that she's not even real.  Who cares!  The character Elvira is a role model to me and I really look up to the person behind that character.  She's gorgeous, spunky, has a cheesy and charming sense of humor, and she speaks her mind!  Simply put, she kicks ass!  Now, with that being said, I was really saddened at some of the reviews I've read here.. not only is ""Haunted Hills"" being cut on, but the lovely Elvira is being cut on for her age, playing the character of Elvira at her age, and the way she looks... ????  WOW!!!  I did watch ""Haunted Hills"" and I've watched it quite a few times actually.  This movie is a ""feel good movie"" and I enjoyed it thoroughly!  Elvira has an amazing charm and it shines in ""Haunted Hills"" as well.  Elvira looks wonderful and I'm not entirely sure of how the comments of how ""bad"" she looked came about.  I will say that the lighting did seem bad at times in small parts of the movie, but ANYONE, regardless of age, won't look their best in bad lighting.  I've had friends of mine say that they had a bad picture taken of them and said it made them look haggard or terrible and it was because of bad lighting.. etc.  Yes, Elvira looks fantastic compared to some actresses half her age.  Does it sound like I'm trying to fend for Elvira?  Not entirely.  I'm just pointing out some facts and how harsh some of those comments were.

To move on, it's quite possible that some were expecting ""Haunted Hills"" to be something similar to her first movie, and there lies alot of the disappointment... but who am I to say.  I applaud Elvira for taking it upon herself to see this movie made.  It's the cheesiest humor (which is Elvira all over and it's always worked for her!), fantastic settings, and it's just an all around fun movie!  I won't go on about the scenes and characters since a few have posted already in detail about them.

I'm not an expert on the Elvira news, but it seems she's kind of dropped out of the spotlight since this movie came out.  I think she continues to make public appearances, but other than that, I'm not sure.  Out of my curiosity one day to see what's new with her, I did a little search on the net and found that there are some admirers of hers trying to get her a star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame.  This woman deserves one for all the pleasant years she has given laughter, inspiration, shared her talent, and for just being Elvira!  To anyone that did or didn't like this movie.. my words would be simply this:  We see what we want to see.  Everyone's tastes are different and that is just that.  I don't cut on anyone for not liking ""Haunted Hills"", but I applaud the ones that did.  I will always keep this movie in my collection!",1113264000,6,2932,4.285974499089253
1742940,5,B00006D28U,"I loved this movie from beginning to end. I may be biased because I have always enjoyed anything that Elvira has done but I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good laugh.

Oh by the way I have an autographed copy of this DVD.",1098489600,3,234,4.086956521739131
1742941,5,B00006D28U,"Thank God for Elvira, she is a dying breed. A sexy actress who is single-handedly trying to keep alive the lost art of Vaudville. When it comes to one-liner quips, sexual inuendos, sight gags, and of course boob jokes, Elvira is the Queen.
Few could argue that Haunted Hills is better than her first movie from 1988. It's just that with such a long wait between movies, expectations were so high. Kind of like Mr. Lucas' problems with Star Wars. However, this film is not complete garbage as some here would have you think.
Elvira at her age still looks better than half the actresses walking around today at half her age. Her body is still enough to make any man's eyes glued to the screen. Her comic timing is still razor sharp and throughout the movie she can even laugh at herself, which is refreshing.
What Elvira attempted to do (and she explains all this in the special features) is make a tribute to the films of Peter Lore and Vincint Price (whom the film is dedicated to.) Maybe this film wasn't as succesful because people have forgotten the old classics and wanted a more modern type comedy. I applaud Elvira for doing what she did. Movies aren't made like this anymore and it's a shame that in this day and age people have forgotten where modern horror and comedy have come from. I mean for the most part, this movie looks and feels a lot like a play on a stage.
With an excellent supporting cast (including Rocky Horror's own Riff Raff Mr. O'Brian) Elvira pulls off a good movie that will bring a few chuckles and plenty of eye candy.",1079481600,4,1548,4.4734982332155475
1742942,1,B00006D28U,"I should say that I LOVED the first Elvira film.  A classic camp, ridiculous comedy!
I was SO excited when I heard a new film had come out.
Wow - was this the biggest let down!
Its appalling - beyond bad.
Its not even so bad it's good - its just BAD.
Elvira is Elvira- the blame doesn't necessarily lie with her.
the co-stars are awful (Richard O'Brien should just bask in his Rocky glory - obviously a one-off), and the direction is terrible - I don't think the director has any understanding of comedy.
However - judging from the other reviews here, its obviously a love or hate film...",1079049600,7,588,4.345454545454546
1742943,2,B00006D28U,"When I rented Elvira's first movie, ""Elvira, Mistress of the Dark,"" I did so with the lowest of expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Ironically, because I liked ""Mistress of the Dark"" so much, I actually went into viewing ""Elvira's Haunted Hills"" with raised expectations, and was summarily disappointed.  Elvira (Cassandra Peterson, who also co-wrote the script) sticks with ""Mistress of the Dark""'s formula of double entendres, goofy puns and silly sight gags, but her schtick doesn't have quite the same charm this time around. There are plenty of fat jokes at the expense of Elvira's maid Zou Zou (Mary Jo Smith) and ""Rocky Horror""'s Richard O'Brien's role is essentially a self-parody. By the movie's final third, the humor is quite thin. There are a few laughs in ""Elvira's Haunted Hills""' 90-minutes, but most are in the movie's first 30. I particularly enjoyed her musical number ""Le Dance Hall."" Ultimately, though, ""Elvira's Haunted Hills"" isn't as funny as the old Roger Corman/Hammer horrors it's spoofing.",1075680000,4,1024,5.2439024390243905
1742944,5,B00006D28U,"Fantastic.  I could only hope for something this good from her and everyone else involved.  Originally I watched the first movie of hers when I was a teenager and the panache of her acting style always emphasized the wonderful writting.  This is a delightful homage to all the old horror's I loved as a kid and still love today.
I can only hope to express thanks to her and everyone involved for a delightful movie.",1075248000,,415,4.506666666666667
1742945,3,B00006D28U,"I did not like how this movie was set back into the 1850s. I mean I thought that her movie would continue as if in the year 2000. I was kind of dissapointed with the lack of humor as in her first movie and the acting of the other characters (except ELVIRA) was not very good. She still had her witty, sexy and clever one-liners which I did enjoy but I felt that the movie needed to be more modern. She definitely still looked the same back in the 1980s (Very Nice). But I still think that it could have been better...Sorry Cassandra.",1066262400,3,533,4.184466019417476
1742946,5,B00006D28U,"Since buying El's 1st movie on VHS, I bought a DVD drive for my computer. So with Halloween about a month away, I bought the 2nd movie on DVD--a purchase I'm glad I made. This time, the setting is eastern Europe in the mid-19th century, & El is not the only gal flaunting sharp cleavage--her French maid Zou Zou keeps blood sausages & a few other goodies hidden within it & pulls the items out as they're needed. In this movie, not only will you find spoofs on Roger Corman & Vincent Price horror films (though I might add that I've never seen the originals). You'll also hear, in the 1st few minutes of the movie, an irate innkeeper screaming, ""Heeeeeeeeeere's Johann!""--a variation of Ed McMahon's famous opening of the Johnny Carson show. After she & Zou Zou flee said innkeeper, El gets sexually harassed again--this time by a guy who gives them a ride to a haunted castle where they end up spending 2 full days & nights. As luck would have it, our heroine bears a very close resemblance (in both looks & name) to Elura, the castle master's late 1st wife, who supposedly committed suicide exactly 10 years before the 1st full day of Elvira's stay. But investigation of the castle, aided by scary dreams, convinces Elvira otherwise. In this castle (& family), acts such as adultery & theft of family jewels are punishable by torture & murder. Elvira even gets briefly possessed twice by the vengeful spirit of Elura, who is played by the very same actress as our heroine. Rocky Horror Picture Show fans will get a nice (trick-or-)treat out of this as well because Richard O'Brien portrays the demented master of the castle.
The ""making-of"" featurette shows Cassandra Peterson, this time WITHOUT the Elvira costume, discussing things like on-set injuries, lack of suitable stunt doubles, & how she & husband Mark Pierson had to finance the movie themselves. Another bonus item is an O'Brien interview with the dungeon set in the background.
While making this movie, Cassandra reached 2 milestones: 50 years of life & 20 years of Elvira. Yes, the camera does show her age at times (especially in her face), but in that best-known role of hers, she still has the power to titillate the fellas (no pun intended).",1065916800,4,2211,4.715762273901809

The acting was bad, the editing was atrocious, and I found myself squirming in my seat, waiting for this to be over.

1742975,4,B00006D28U,"Parody Queen Elvira {Cassandra Peterson} returns to the past amongst the legendary of Romania to tittilate and haunt the dreams once again. And she is as beautiful as ever, in that form-fitting thigh-split dress and buxom attributes. After a brief Bathory-esque interrment, The film begins with swirls of dark multi-colored paint churning ever-so elegantly to the sounds of a classical composition - quite a pleasing effect.
She continues to persue her dreams of fame and fortune, performing at various pubs in the countryside, when one morning, after an exhaustive night of performance, a crazed innkeeper demands his money, and even breaks through the door uttering a familiar, though modified ""...here's Yohan!"" She and her servant, a porky bess, escape through the window to the street below, but not before the maid makes off with some blood sausage from a vendor's booth. Soon afterwards, Elvira is mounted on the servant's back ""piggy-back style"" to save her the tremendous hike {what are servents for?}; they are left hitch-hiking on the side of the road when finally they are picked up by an English Doctor's coach, with a male version of a servant to match - a mute bald brute. So now The Mistress of The Dark embarks upon yet another adventure, this time, to Castle Hellsubus {exterior depicted in classic matte form, interior based upon that of 'The Haunted Palace'}, which is haunted by the vengeful spirit of Lord Hellsubus' {O' Brien} deceased wife {Peterson}, quite a beauty in her own right The morose and depraved nobility therein are taken aback by Elvira's resemblence to Lady Hellsubus; and in one humorous scene, she is greeted with a long, ear-piercing scream, which would also be another nicely comical way to deterr xian porch-pounders from soiling one's doorstep {of course, the best method, is that they would not even be able to make it through the locked gate, and the hounds}.
During a lethargic dinner, Elvira decides to liven up the atmosphere by performing her patented can-can dance which 'ends' in a delightful display of her choice assets, complete with black fishnet stockings and garter. And the werewolves howl at the moon.....
While meandering through the castle to the library, Elvira discovers a strapping stablehand who is hilariously misdubbed like the classic Hercules pictures. He has a penchant for reading the books in the library, in a peasant shirt with long flowing locks, so the ladies will have a treat here as well. Actually, the original actor was to be Fabio, but at the last moment, he flaked, so the country's Romeo had to be substituted, but it worked well, much better than what that monosyllabic numbskull could have done. This actor actually appeared intelligent, and recited his lines in Romanian, but was just translated into English - the effect is great comedy.
A jaunt in the local graveyard {in which she dons a crushed velvet cloak and silky opera gloves} brings Elvira face to face with a Hellsubus ancestor, as well as a true horror chewing its sustainance, and Lord Hellsubus reveals more about the family curse, but seems to be suffering from a case of MPD as he transitions between gentleman and crazed lovelorn killer. She discovers a full-proof method to break him from his trance. However, his dementia eventually gets the better of him, as he sees his ghostly wife in the hallways, as well as imposed upon the ladies of the house, until he finally manages to capture them, although I consider the relative's imprisonment a justified recourse, as it was revealed that she and the Doctor were in league, and in lust, together to possess the family fortune for themselves, and actually dance about when they believe him dead. But he arises to punish the rotten parasites.
Finally, the Pit and the Pendulum element enters in, as it just so seems that the Hellsubuses were always fascinated with torture devices, and most of them were 'evil adulterers', and one a cross-dresser {they also all resembled 'Al Bundy'}. Classic implements such as The Iron Maiden, the vice, the stockade, and the body cage array this delightfully gloomy subterranian dungeon - and the most impressive pies-de-resistance, The Pendulum. What I enjoyed in this film, is that it actually fulfills its purpose,and does end up actually slicing some body in twain. So the classically inpirational scene unfolds in which the ravenesque, voluptuous Mistress of The Dark is chained into its cruel fetters - and what an opportunity......
As is Elvira de-regeur, tis movie is a parody of the horror classics. Haunted Hills is a combination of The Abominable Dr. Phibes, The Pit & The Pendulum, and The Haunted Palace, rolled up into one with Elvira thrown into the middle for this ghoulish Halloween treat - and that ain't no trick!

It does an incredible job of paroding them and sometimes it takes a couple of times of watching to catch all the jokes.  But I have watched it several times, and while it is not MISTRESS OF THE DARK, it need not be compared because it stands up very well on its own.
Elvira's Haunted Hills is very amusing and has a wonderful cast.

In this loving parody of the Hammer and AIP gothic-horror films of the 60's, Elvira plays a busty entertainer circa 1851, who gets caught up in a tangle with the mysterious residents of the Castle Hellsubus.  Vladimere Hellsubus (Richard O'Brien - THE ROCKY HORROR SHOW) takes a shying to Elvira when he discovers that she looks exactly like his dead wife Elura, who died under mysterious circumstances.
Together with her robust maid ZouZou (Mary Jo Smith), Elvira sets out to escape from Vladimere's evil house and pendulum, with her cunning tricks and her showstopping number ""Le Music Hall"".
Hilarious.  Filmed entirely on location in Romania, the production values are lavish and Elvira looks as gorgeous as ever in the long-overdue sequel that will surely be relished by fans.
