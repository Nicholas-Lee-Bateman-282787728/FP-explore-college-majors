7972589,5,B00006RCKJ,This filled in missing episodes my local TV station would not play. I am hooked on the Saint TV series - very good entertainment.,1372464000,,129,4.416666666666667

7972591,4,B00006RCKJ,"I'll make it short. Of all seven sets and the two B/Ws I like this
one least. Roger Moore is good, its the pictures I don't care for
that much. One is a repeat, Vendetta. The difference in set seven
it comes in two parts. In watching this set I feel more like I am
seeing James Bond, not that I dislike Roger Moore as Bond, its just
the simple fact I like the Saint to be the Saint and Bond is fine
provided Mr. Moore is playing Bond. I believe what is missing here
is that TV format. Having had my say what is important is the DVDs. All is well with both picture and sound. Its just a me thing I guess.",1244592000,,603,3.870967741935484
7972592,4,B00006RCKJ,"I grew up with the Saint, beginning with the Black and White episodes and even continued with the ""Son of the Saint"" for a little while afterwards, but only for a little while.

The television of the late fifties and early sixties, reflects the changing nature of the contempoary society and it's culture. Whereas the fifties in Britain at least, had shows which were loosely based on the expolits of literary characters or heroic exploits fictionalised they developed in part due to the nature of the developments in the commerical television area as well as the increasing technological capability to bring dreams to life.

Viewing this, the last volume of Roger Moore's portrayal of Leslie Charteris' fictional modern day Robin Hood with a twist, one is reminded of those early adventure yarns especially the appearance in the Ex-King of Diamonds of the actor who was renowned in children's television at least, by his portrayal of Lamburgher Gessler, the villain in William Tell. Also in the same episode is the actor who played the pilot and his double, Jaques Duvall in the Bond movie Thunderball, opposite the Sean Connery Bond.

The last set of the Saint is thankfully the last. The theme music, changed to reflect the televising of the Saint in colour was mutilated even further towards the end and is a horrible transfiguration of the original theme which graced the black and white sets.

The Saint, under Roger Moore's watch had a satisfying charm all of it's own. here was the bad guy turned good even though he had an edge and attitude but who could not stand by in the face of injustice. The fact that the show was sustained for seven years was a testimony to the strength of Charteris' original vision and his stories. No simple good versus evil here. There was much more grey in the world after all. The production team, relying for much of the strong shows on the strength of the stable of British television actors who made themselves available for this show including the redoubtable Ivor Dean as the long suffering Chief Inspector Claude Eustace Teale, were a consistent aspect to the shows.

The most noticeable feature of this last set is the clear view that the show had run out of ideas after it's lengthy run. The show seems flat and tired with Moore nonchalantly playing his part. Perhaps it was a sign of the times that the old guard was being eclipsed by the newer and refreshing team which brought the Avengers to our screens as well as some of the more adventurous productions such as the Prisoner which elbowed out the Saint or perhaps it was just that the world too was changing with growing affluence among the wider population inculcating changing viewer habits where the charm of the old society that characterised Charteris' books was replaced by the anti-heroes portrayed by Michael Caine, or by the much more realistic and sinsiter Callan so admirably developed by Edward Woodward.

Even so this little collection ends on quite a good note, and Moore moved on to take his place in the pantheon of James Bonds. Indeed he had been Flemmings first choice but in the event the final word on who Bond was was established with apparent ease by Connery who made the character his own and who still today is regarded as the epitomy of James Bond 007.

All of the Saint stories as portrayed by Moore are a grace to any collection, in my view particluarly the black and white espisodes, and this set too is a must. They sure do not make them like this anymore which in many ways is a shame. A reminder of more gentler times past to contemplate.",1125532800,6,3573,4.698083067092652
7972593,4,B00006RCKJ,"Roger Moore returns as Simon Templar, alias ""The Saint"" in the seventh boxed DVD set of his exploits.  Templar, the suave ""Robin Hood of Modern Crime"" is featured in the final adventures of the long running 60's TV series.  Here are summaries and/or comments for the episodes in this set.

The Saint, never one to be made a pawn, looks to take control of the situation, and derail the masterplan, in this slightly off the wall episode.
Portrait of Brenda (Episode 117): Rating (4) - In London, Simon discovers a murdered artist, and begins investigating his death.  Mystery revolves around a portait, a spiritual guru, and a dead singer, with a couple of lovely ladies thrown into the mix.  Ivor Dean makes his final appearance as police inspector Claude Eustace Teal, lending a helping hand in this adventure that maintains the suspense until the very end.
The World Beater (Episode 118): Rating (3) - The final episode of the series finds Simon Templar behind of wheel of a rally racing car.  Intrigue and sabotage abound, as The Saint prepares to drive in a high stakes road rally.  A woman from his past makes an appearance, bringing excitement into his life.
The episodes in this collection feature some excellent writing and acting, taking this long running series to a conclusion strongly.  After this, Roger Moore would again return to television, teaming with Tony Curtis, in The Persuaders.  He would then assume his most famous role, after being chosen to succeed Sean Connery as the new James Bond, debuting in Live and Let Die in 1973.",1074643200,21,2990,4.664761904761905
