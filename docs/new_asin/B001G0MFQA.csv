3589788,5,B001G0MFQA,ANOTHER GREAT CHAPTER IN THE BEST TV CRIME SHOW EVER MADE. ROBERT STACK IS SO AMAZING IN THIS IS DOES NOT EVEN LOOK LIKE ACTING. MOVIE QUALITY ON T.V. IF YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN IT YOUR MISSING SOMETHING SPECIAL. MIKE JACOBSEN  9-12-2009,1252713600,13,233,4.5476190476190474
3589789,5,B001G0MFQA,"Nov 10....2009 is the release date for Untouchables  Season 3  Vol 2.....this leaves only season 4 to go, let's hope that will happen in 2010.",1250726400,11,142,4.64
3589790,5,B001G0MFQA,"Retro television shows have never done particularly well unless they were set in the Old West. Shows set in the 20's, 30's, 40's, etc, any era outside of the one in which they aired have never lasted long except in three major exceptions - Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley, and The Untouchables.

The Untouchables succeeded for a number of reasons. First, the veil that had been on the Mafia for a number of years was slowly but surely being peeled off due to gangland killings and the fame of gangsters such as Al Capone, Bugsy Siegel, Dutch Schultz, Lucky Luciano, and others. Even before the Godfather and its outstanding first sequel, the public had a fascination and curiosity with the mob. So take some true events, ture characters, heavily fictionalize them with Hollywood gloss and pathos, and you get a very successful show that made a star out of Robert Stack and brought new fame to a Treasury agent named Eliot Ness.

The Untouchables' collection should not have been split up into multiple sections. That's greed, pure and simple. But the lure of this show - its great characters, performances, grit and intelligence will draw buyers even though they know they're being ripped off. Stack's Ness is one of the best alltime detectives - fearless, relentless, and absolutely ruthless with the bad guys. The supporting casts were always excellent, and Bruce Gordon brough the right amount of humor and menace to Frank Nitti, Capone's chief lieutenant.

The Untouchables - Season Three, Volume 2 is not untouchable, but it is irresistable.",1250640000,13,1544,4.930769230769231

3589830,5,B001G0MFQA,This was definitely a well produced historical series.  Robert Stack as Eliot Ness was a good choice.  This show depicted on how brutal life was if you got caught up in the world of crime.  This is part two of season three.  A good one to own.,1383955200,,243,4.1063829787234045
3589841,5,B001G0MFQA,"I grew up with the Untouchables so I can only say that I absolutely love The Untouchables no matter what season it is. My only complaint is that each season is divided into two parts. But, in those days writers were better, television being fairly new still, there was so much material per season I guess, to sell the season in it's entirety might be too much and cost to  much. That said, time for season 4 1 & 2.",1383523200,,414,4.175

3589849,5,B001G0MFQA,"I have all available seasons, and they are good television.  This series has not lost anything over the years. The acting is crisp, the dialog sharp, and the action is plentiful. Since these episodes are filmed in black and white starting at the end of the 1950's, there is no unnecessary gore associated with the violence that is incorporated in them. Plenty of good stories and characters for all tastes. Besides the Untouchables themselves, the mobsters are all well-acted. Bruce Gordon is sensational as Frank Nitti. Guest stars are always a surprise, and you can see them before they became famous. Each DVD is very good and plays great.",1327881600,,642,4.889908256880734

I waited for so long to have this collection that I can't believe they will not release the remaining of the series. Put everything together and release it as one volume. At least you can walk out of it clean, whoever is responsible for it. But don't just leave your job unfinished. It doesn't sound like Elliot Ness.",1295827200,3,344,4.476190476190476

3589872,5,B001G0MFQA,"The television programs produced in the 60's were better than the ""crap"" produced today where sitcom actors sit on a couch, crack jokes, and go nowhere.  The Untouchables is an action series filmed in black and white which enabled using old 1930's film footage and mixing with the 1960's production.  This puts the viewer back in the 1930's time frame.
