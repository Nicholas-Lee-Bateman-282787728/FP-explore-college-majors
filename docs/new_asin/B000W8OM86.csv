2963417,4,B000W8OM86,It is hard enough to solve a mystery that happened a few years ago (like the Kennedy assassination?)but to trace a mummy over 4000 years old and to identify it with modern technology makes makes it looks like an episode of Perry Mason (I wouldn't call it CSI).,1256256000,3,260,4.4375
2963418,5,B000W8OM86,"I thought this documentary was excellent. During this 100 minute DVD a couple of mysteries are slowly solved. Using archaeological explorations, CAT scans, and molecular genetics (DNA testing) a number of experts set out to determine which of 4 mummies is ancient Egypt's Queen Hatshepsut and why her images were defaced and her legacy erased in ancient times. During the program, the historical background related to who this Egyptian ruler was is provided. A very interesting program.",1232928000,12,486,5.324675324675325
2963419,5,B000W8OM86,"I showed this video to my 10th grade World History students and I have never seen high schoolers pay such close attention to a video.  They loved it--it provided a lot of information on basic archaeology while educating them about the pharaohs of Egypt.

It drags on a bit, so maybe not perfect for a classroom, but definitely worth the cost.

I am, stunned by the abisimal 2 star rating by the previous rater.

When I visited the temple of Hatshepsut I looked at the desert rock landscape above the temple. It looks to me like many people gathering and celebrating her reign. She is so special.

She still watches it now and loves the way that Dr. Zahi solved a ancient mystery through modern day technology.

It takes you through the journey of how he went about trying to track Hatchepsut's mummy but also provides interesting footage about why her mummmy might have been moved through background knowledge about her controversial life and rein.

I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD as did my daughter.",1283558400,2,625,5.048543689320389

8221672,5,B000W8OM86,The story is fascinating and the scientists who worked tirelessly brought us a new dimension to the pharaoh of Egypt. This documentary should be required watching for all students of history. Thank you Discovery.,1483401600,,212,5.264705882352941

8221674,3,B000W8OM86,"If you already know who Hatshepsut is, you can simply watch the last 20 minutes or so of this video and learn everything new that the video can tell you.

But watching the entire program you get a lot of assumptions that no legitimate historian or scientists would dare make.

The most obvious assumption is that the person who tried to erase Hats from the historical record is Thutmose III.  But, then you have to wonder why did he put up with her for so long?  She became his regent when she was no older than 30, but she died sometime after age 40 and maybe not until around age 50?  If Thutmose III disliked her so much, then surely he could have found willing co-conspirators (especially since he commanded the army) to bring her to a quick and likely brutal death.  But, he didn't.  So could it be that Thutmose respected his regent, his half-sister/step-mother and knew that her power was the source of his own?

Also, if Hats wanted to pass the throne on to her daughter, wouldn't the obvious best way to do it be to marry her off to Thutmose?  Bringing the daughter into the equation takes this program on an un-necessary tangent.  Ditto for Hats' builder and presumed lover.

And I don't get how the Cairo Museum's 3rd floor is as dark as a CSI episode TV set.  Did Hawass not pay the light bill?",1477440000,,1306,4.395833333333333

8221677,1,B000W8OM86,"""More powerful than Cleopatra or Nefertiti, Queen Hatshepsut not only died mysteriously, but every sign of her existence was systematically erased. ""
What nonsense. Tell me, if that statement is true (-every sign of her existence was systematically erased."" ) how do we know of her now? Some new age telepathy perhaps? This TV show is PC feminist nonsense. There is no real proof of who destroyed some (obviously not all ) of her images. Instead we are regaled with  baloney,here and elsewhere, like the wall built around her obelisks was built by T 3  to ""obscure"" her accomplishments, then a French dig claims to unearth evidence that H herself had the wall built, so the line changes to the wall being built to ""accent "" the obelisks. This is not history nor honest archeology . It is PC speculation and should be labeled as such.",1435017600,2,833,4.698630136986301
