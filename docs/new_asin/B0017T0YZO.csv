8267148,1,B0017T0YZO,"Others have commented that the price for this dvd is too high ($195).  But it's available for only $29.95 at the filmmakers website IF you're an individual who will be viewing it at home.  The price listed on Amazon is the so-called tiered institutional pricing for libraries.  Because libraries loan out videos or let teachers show them in class, filmmakers think they have a right to charge libraries more -- much more.  There is no legal basis for this approach; it's simply a matter of what the market will bear.  As long as libraries continue to purchase videos at inflated tiered pricing, filmmakers have no reason not to overcharge us.",1319587200,,642,4.8
8267149,5,B0017T0YZO,"This is an outstanding documentary that exposes the nature of these men, their personal insecurities, habits and particular natures that played a role in their development, their callous inhumanity... and their ultimate decline.  If the directors/producers were really devoted in their intent to educate the public, then they'd cut their price by about $175.00... what a scam -- a sort of irony when one thinks about the movie as I'm sure one day, we'll see clearly how the evils of greed will be the downfall of a productive, healthy society.  Seems the evils of the men the producers and director expose in this 40 minute documentary rubbed off on them too...!  Posers.  Look for it on IFC, they seem to show it on occasion.",1313798400,,726,4.830645161290323
8267150,5,B0017T0YZO,"I saw this documentary on IFC or Sundance a few years ago and found it very telling.  For a moment, I thought what might have been if these ""men"" had found joy in their lives or childhood, or had not been plagued by whatever ailments made them self-conscience and turn their inward pain and shame outward on the world as pure evil!  Of course, there must have been some type of deep mental illness (sociopath, anti-social, etc.) to account for such blatant disregard for human suffering and a total lack of empathy, but what I find almost as disturbing as their crimes, is the fact that these monsters could not have enacted their vengeance on the world without the aide of your average citizen.  That should give us all pause.",1288656000,,727,4.576923076923077
8267151,5,B0017T0YZO,"I've seen this many times on IFC. I've always enjoyed it. I thought ""Hey I'd love a friend to see this"". But $195.00 for a 1/2 hour documentary... No. Check your local listings, it is very good.",1272844800,4,194,4.27027027027027
