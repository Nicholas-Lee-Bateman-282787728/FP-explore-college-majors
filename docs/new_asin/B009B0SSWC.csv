8539027,4,B009B0SSWC,"One ugly little weirdo of a film, but poignant in an underbelly sort of way. Interesting story with an unexpected twist at the end. I would definitely recommend it, but what can I say? My kid is in it!",1359072000,,201,4.17948717948718
8539028,2,B009B0SSWC,Okay movie but not very good acting. It also had a very amateur quality to it. It looked interesting - I guess I was fooled by the description and trailer.,1355097600,,155,4.2
