5546994,5,B00B1E6EAY,"These examinations of Shakespeare's plays are utterly fascinating, well-researched and moving. They include analysis of the works themselves, the historic context in which they were written, as well as examples of theatrical interpretations of the works. It is touching to hear and see the admiration that these actors, directors, scholars and others have for these plays. This set adds more credence to our reverence for this greatest of playwrights.",1361059200,34,451,5.550724637681159
5546995,5,B00B1E6EAY,Absolutely wonderful program. My only wish is that they made more episodes and covered more of Shakespeare's plays. A must see for anyone even remotely interested in Shakespeare.,1360972800,21,178,5.392857142857143
5546996,5,B00B1E6EAY,"This extremely well conceived series is not only rich in information, but extremely entertaining. Hosted by actors who have played the lead roles in the plays which they explore seem to be an a journey of discovery along with us. They take us to the new Globe Theatre in London as well as to some of the historical locations in the plays. Not only are the works and their sources uncovered, but  Shakespeare the man and his times as well. Inspiring!",1360368000,74,449,4.54320987654321

5547054,5,B00B1E6EAY,Excellent video. I used the Macbeth program while reading the play with my 10th Grade higj school students. It really helped put the social and political issues of the day in context.,1477180800,,183,4.75
5547055,5,B00B1E6EAY,"Brilliant, smart and very well done! It runs you through the whole gamut of emotions. You will fall in love with these characters, and because it's Shakespeare, part of you will even love and understand the evil ones.",1476748800,,217,4.7368421052631575

5547070,4,B00B1E6EAY,"While a bit try at times ( and in Derek Jacobi's case, meanderingly officials topic), geese were generally informative when giving background to my students. Will use again!",1465948800,,173,5.214285714285714

5547072,4,B00B1E6EAY,"Interesting anecdotes about acting in specific plays from well-known actors (each actor speaks about one play in particular) with some background/history about each play, but not meant to be a documentary for going into depth about the facts of Shakespeare's life.  If you are teaching this subject, this is more of a supplemental video about specific plays rather than a real teaching tool. For example, I was covering Othello, and that segment was a nice way to round out what we had already talked about.",1465516800,9,507,4.964705882352941

5547075,5,B00B1E6EAY,"Very useful to show to students as an introduction to William Shakespeare's Macbeth.  The ""dance"" scene with nudity was gratuitous and unnecessary.",1461369600,,147,5.681818181818182
5547076,4,B00B1E6EAY,"Excellently done. Heartfelt, diverse, appreciative. Very much liked that the authorship question was raised..Brave Derek Jacobi.
Yet, the beauty of the work is the thing and the series conveys it's intricacies very well.",1461283200,,220,5.696969696969697
5547077,5,B00B1E6EAY,"I teach Taming of the Shrew to high schoolers, and the episode on it is hosted by Morgan Freeman. He does a great job of tackling the difficult subject matter of the play, and my students were all paying great attention, and had an excellent discussion afterwards. Great wrap-up to the unit.",1459987200,8,291,4.615384615384615

5547101,5,B00B1E6EAY,"I find this to be a strong, inviting introduction to teaching the play to my high school seniors in A.P. English Lit. and Comp. It opens up the world of the play and introduces many of the themes, and effectively, energetically, shows the relationship between Shakespeare's script as literature and production as interpretation. I then, act by act, show the 2009 BBC production as we read and study the play.",1455580800,,408,4.8428571428571425

5547107,5,B00B1E6EAY,"If you want to exoplore Macbeth's inner most thoughts, Ethan Hawke does an amazing job of peeling away the layers. My students diagnose Macbeth with a mental illness, this character study gives them  insight on how to do so.",1445644800,,224,4.743589743589744

5547123,5,B00B1E6EAY,"A truly captivating, entertaining and greatly informative series that makes Shakespeare's plays accessible to all, young and old.  The series includes Interviews of famous actors who have played the roles with clips from many of the movies of each play that is discussed, as well as experts on the play.  The narrator is someone well-known who conducts the interviews and is a person who will be performing the role.  An absolute must for anyone contemplating attending one of the plays covered in the series, as it goes behind the scenes and explains all the key issues of the play.  I highly recommend this series.",1440806400,8,616,4.894230769230769

5547126,5,B00B1E6EAY,Awesome. Loved the Ethan Hawke episode. Especially when I later saw the Macbeth production at Lincoln Center.,1437264000,,109,5.470588235294118

5547131,5,B00B1E6EAY,"This is an excellent series that explains not only Shakespeare plays, but also important productions and actors throughout the ages. I also enjoy the historical explanations.

5547134,5,B00B1E6EAY,"Many years ago I took a class in Shakespeare from one of the ""World's Foremost Experts.""  S. Uncovered: Series 2 turns out to be better.  Anyone wanting to understand the Plays should watch both Series 1 and 2.  I have watched them twice, they are so well done.",1432512000,5,261,4.395833333333333
5547135,5,B00B1E6EAY,Such a great series.,1432339200,,20,4.25
5547136,5,B00B1E6EAY,"First off, I have a lot of education so you would think I would be one of those people really fascinated by Shakespeare. And, yes in some of my college classes we had to go over Shakespeare.  Despite all of this I never got into Shakespeare, until this series came along. Then I ate up the episodes like someone who was starved for food.  I loved that the actors and actresses presenting the various characters had actually played the parts.  I loved that they talked about the history behind the plays. I loved that the plays were made so relevant to today's times.  I loved how they jumped back and forth between various actors and actresses playing the same part over different times.  I even loved the part where there was skepticism as to if Shakespeare even wrote the plays in the first place by Derek Jacobi. (I am not sure I agree with him, but I loved that they threw in what he feels to open up the debate). To be honest, I have saved the series to the my Watchlist because I really want to watch it all again.  There is just so much to take in, it all demands another view.",1432252800,,1084,4.28921568627451
5547137,4,B00B1E6EAY,Great way to teach Shakespeare,1431993600,,30,5.2
5547167,4,B00B1E6EAY,"Watching the various actors explain their take on the characters they played made me want to watch the actual plays. In fact, I watched the Tempest and Macbeth after listening to this video and I also plan to watch Hamlet. Each presenter speaks with various historians who help the viewer understand the historical context in which the play was written. Very informative. Especially to a newbie like me who managed to avoid Shakespeare in high school! If you plan to see one of the plays described in this video, watch this first. It will really help make the play come alive.",1431907200,2,576,4.712871287128713
5547168,5,B00B1E6EAY,"Great program, they break down why Shakespeare wrote what he wrote. Very cool",1431648000,,77,5.0
5547169,5,B00B1E6EAY,"Very fine series.  Especially noteworthy is episode on ""The Tempest"" with director Trevor Nunn, which is magical.  For anyone unfamiliar with the plays, a wonderful way to prepare to go see a performance of any play in the series.",1431388800,,230,4.871794871794871
5547170,5,B00B1E6EAY,excellent contemporary coverage. Grewat for my senior students studying this topic.,1430697600,,83,6.636363636363637
5547171,5,B00B1E6EAY,"Please, the overview of ""Romeo and Juliet"" presented by Joseph Feinnes clearly points out that there was work which preceded Shakespeare and clearly could have provided a basis for Shakespeare's writing. After all, a rose by any other name would smell as sweet. Do we really need to argue about the name on the work? I believe we can agree that all of this work out of one single human being is most unlikely. And we can very likely agree that one single human being capable of so many observations of human behavior in an age not given to the study of psychology may be quite unlikely.

Take it for what it is. The series provides insight into the writing guided by presenters crafted in their profession and is a tour de force. Do we take exception to screenwriters adapting a book into cinema even when we read ""Based on . . ."" or do we choose instead to celebrate the talent of the screenwriter? Let it be what it is and enjoy literature that has lived on for more than 400 years knowing that it was performed at a time when theater was more an opportunity to fornicate in the balcony vs. celebrate literature.

And, lastly, since much of Edward de Vere's works have not survived, although we know that he was thought of as ""the most excellent"" fo Elizabeth's courtier poets. But, do we know for a fact that the 17th Earl of Oxford did not collaborate with Shakespeare to get something of his writing published notwithstanding performed? At that time, Oxford's interests at staying in favor at Court was far more important than being published. And Oxford was apparently not very successful in keeping is position at Court and could possibly have been put in the Tower (again) for treason had he pushed for his preferred order of succession prior to Elizabeth's death.

Seriously, it really doesn't matter. The work stands and this series, ""Shakespeare Uncovered"" provides insight into the work, regardless of authorship, which is educational, insightful, entertaining, and hope for the future of theater through the re-invention of the work.",1430697600,,2046,4.75774647887324
5547172,5,B00B1E6EAY,An absolutely outstanding series on Shakespeare.,1430438400,,48,7.166666666666667
5547173,3,B00B1E6EAY,"Actors are not generally noted for scholarship, and this is not a scholarly series on Shakespeare.  It's not entirely clear what we are uncovering in ""Shakespeare Uncovered.""  Derek Jacobi's piece on Richard II is very good.  The other actors have nice voices. My stars are for Jacobi on Richard II.  Not a very interesting read of the play, but a plausible offering on it.",1430352000,,373,4.78125

5547199,3,B00B1E6EAY,"I liked the way the whole idea was approached. Researching the actual location, the actual people, and so on made the show interesting. It would have been cool if it showed Ethan Hawke in the role at the end, but it was still a good show.",1429833600,,238,4.195652173913044

5547226,4,B00B1E6EAY,"Both theatre novices and buffs will get a lot out of this series.  Fantastic opportunities to hear scholars and top-flight actors discuss their Shakespearean roles and see clips of rare performances -- including a pre-James Bond Sean Connery playing the title role in the Scottish Play (!).  The presentation is logical (from beginning to end of each play).  The trans-Atlantic mix of presenters is refreshing.  Not every interpretation may suit your personal taste, but the glory of Shakespeare almost always comes through.  Only real criticism:  a bit too much walk-and-talk footage of the presenters brooding as they walk the streets of London (or wherever they happen to be).  Overall, an invaluable educational tool that goes down very easily.",1427587200,2,748,5.288135593220339
5547247,5,B00B1E6EAY,"Though my background is theatre,  there is no way I could have read or been fortunate enough to see the plays discussed and, literally ""uncovered"" in this show.

5547268,5,B00B1E6EAY,"The Series 2 Shakespeare Uncovered is insightful and interesting. These documentaries include history, biography and the real stories behind the famous plays. What makes it even more intriguing is the narration and personal passions of the six celebrity hosts. A Midsummer Night's Dream with Hugh Bonneville, Kind Lear with Christopher Plummer, Othello with David Harewood, Antony and Cleopatra with Kim Cattrall, Romeo and Juliet with Joseph Fiennes and my favorite, The Taming of the Shrew with Morgan Freeman. The Analysis and descriptions given through out the DVDs are my favorite part. Even if you have seen all of the plays, you will learn something new. I am familiar with the plays and I learned a great deal about really comprehending and understanding the story lines and the characters. If you aren't familiar with the plays, you will be motivated to see them all. You really learn about the true history of each Shakespeare play and really get to appreciate the characters and understand them. The personal passion of each of the six films really shines through because the Hosts also seem to be passionate about the films. There is a simple Scene Selection, Set Up and there are no other special features but the DVD series truly is a special feature. I give this one 5 stars!

5547273,3,B00B1E6EAY,"Just like Shakespeare's plays, some episodes of this series are really very worth it, and some are awash in a sort of uneasy, self-laudatory solipsism. Watching actors watching themselves performing Shakespeare can trigger a gag reflex for some. This is particularly the case with Derek Jacobi's discussion of Richard II, and Joely Richardson's homage to her mother, Vanessa Redgrave, in which we see the two of them more often than we'd like, cozily lounging on a plush divan chatting about Redgrave's performance in As You Like It. The episode most unbearable to watch is Kim Cattrall's bit on Anthony and Cleopatra. Cattrall, whose acting career includes all of one Shakespeare play--(you guessed it)--gives a wholly unconvincing performance of someone who knows anything at all about The Bard, or Cleopatra, or even acting for that matter.

The best of the series are David Tennant's piece on Hamlet; Jeremy Lyons on Henry IV & V; and Hugh Bonneville's piece on A Midsummer Night's Dream. Here, the actors are able to step outside their own performances long enough to add believable commentary on the works.

The best parts are watching various takes of the same scenes played by different actors and the historical background given by Shakespeare scholars, where, at last, viewers can actually learn something.",1425686400,,1316,5.173708920187793

5547275,5,B00B1E6EAY,"Shakespeare Uncovered: Series 2 is an excellent introduction to the six plays.  Given that each program is one hour, it isn't possible to cover (no pun) everything about the play.  On the other hand, what is covered (no pun) gives the viewer something to think about and, more important, to start the viewer on a personal journey of discovering  the play.  The scholars and historians provide interesting information, but the real strength of Shakespeare Uncovered is watching actors perform scenes for the play and talking about their experience acting in a production.

I've read about Peter Brook's famous Midsummer Night's Dream and in one article it said the production was never filmed.  It was a wonderful treat to see clips from the production.

Seeing a production first hand is one of the best ways to experience any Shakespeare play, but if this isn't possible Shakespeare Uncovered Series 2 is a good introduction.  I hope teachers will use the series as a ""tool"" to teach a play to the students.

I know those who claim that Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford is the ""true"" author are upset by the series because their ideas are not included.  Pity.  The producers have no obligation to acknowledge the Oxfordians. In a program on evolution why take time to include the views of creationists.

What I am writing her, is less a review than a reply to another 'review"" by someone who has certainly NOT bought the DVDs but DOES have a strong opinion about the series. I accept that Norwood didn't like them but he has a HUGE agenda. He is convinced that William Shakespeare of Stratford is NOT the author of the plays and that the 17th Earl of Oxford IS. He is wrong in my view, of course, but obviously entitled to his opinion. Since we felt that the overwhelming view is that Shakespeare WAS the author of the plays, then we did not need to get bogged down in biography or Tudor history except here and there - either for fun (the silly valet parking story) or for more serious issues like the relationship between Queen Elizabeth & Robert Dudley or the visit of the Moroccan Ambassador to London or Shakespeare's relationship with his daughters or indeed the death of the Queen and the accession of James I.  The academic consultants and contributors to the series are all universally acclaimed experts on the plays - but not to Norwood's taste as they don't share his view on the authorship. It seems a little misleading to ""review"" this DVD on that basis and so I felt emboldened to reply. For the 99% who are happy to accept the more or less universal view of the authorship, I hope that they will enjoy them as much as those 99% who have been tweeting their praise throughout the transmission of the films on PBS",1424908800,15,1446,4.415730337078652

I enjoyed hearing these performers commenting on different ways to approach these plays, and the series motivated me to go back read and reread many of these classic works of literature. I really don't think you could ask for much more in a series such as this.

These episodes are not ""mini-documentaries"" and were not intended to be. It was more like having an informal opportunity to sit down with celebrated actors while they explain to you why *they* like these plays. I really appreciated that opportunity.

Perhaps because Tennant is going to be [playing Hamlet, and Hawke is playing McBeth, there is little focus on the female characters.  Lady McBeth is one of the most powerful and disturbing characters in Shakespeare, but she is barely mentioned till at least a third of the way through.  But, then she does receive a good deal of attention, and gave me a new perspective on how she deteriorates.  All in all, fascinating refresher and look behind the scenes.

5547355,1,B00B1E6EAY,"""Macbeth""; what a bone headed play.

I love the Shakespeare portfolio. ""Love's Labours Lost"", ""The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark"", ""The Merchant of Venice"", ""Romeo and Juliet"", a number of others.

But the one play that's always had me scratching my head is ""Macbeth"", or ""The Tragey of Macbeth"".  And this show opens up with one of the most vapid play in the Shakespeare portfolio, and puts such a focus, such a primary examination on what has to be one of the worst plays in that said same portfolio, that it's a wonder the rest of this series got made at all.

To examine; ""The Tragedy of Macbeth""; traditionally this play is set in the middle ages. Say the 12th century. You and another lord lead a combined army to defeat a rebellion. It costs you lots of gold; dead soldiers, dead horses, broken weapons, spent arrows, food and so forth. That was the price you paid to help save the king's realm.

So you go back, and you have some kind of strange encounter with three old hags who try to foist some backwoods mumbo-jumbo. Okay, maybe you're superstitious. Maybe they got to you. Maybe they put a real good fright into you. But, remember, a day or two before, you were swinging a sword and mowing down enemy troops from your horse whlie crying at the top of your lungs. AND, you defeated the enemy army at great cost to yourself.

Now, with that in mind, why, oh just why on Earth, would you ever consider killing your king? To sleep with his wife? If you were the guy leading the army, and you won at great cost, would not simply flip a bill over to the king? Would you not tell ""your lord"", ""your sovereign"" that you were happy (or maybe unhappy) to serve him, but it cost you a great deal, and that your lord needs to cough up the cash to cover the expenses?

Now imagine the king renegs, or says it's the cost of doing business, and that you have to suck it up. Why would you plot to murder him?  A few days before you were shedding blood on this guys behalf. You are his army, and now you're going to do some kind of clandestine regicide by stabbing your king? Huh?  Why not just tell the king to pay up or threaten to I'll lay siege to his castle and take his crown?

But none of this most basic plot point is addressed in the least.  Instaed the opening episode of the series, hosted by Ethan Hawke, examines the emotional content of conniving to commit murder, and all the ramifications thereof.  From examinging an interpretation by interpretative dancers, to interrogating a criminal psychologists, to reflecting on the act of ending another person's life, all the while ignoring the fact that Macbeth himself probably killed at least a dozen or more men a few days before on the battlefield.

This fundamental flaw in this opening series is so blatant, so missing, is of such a dismissive mindset, that I cannot reccomend this series with any ounce of integrity.

Well shot, high production values, first rate narrators, the series itself misses opportunities to examine the most basic elements and loopholes in the Shakespeare canon, and fails as a complete investigation of the Shakespeare portfolio.

The truth is it, like some of the other plays in history, portions of the portfolio, that is select plays, were a tool for internal security. A kind of law enforcement tool where you reenact the gist of a crime to a perpestrator, and witness them fall apart due to their paranoia thinking everyone else ""knows"" what they've done. It's clear that this was the intent behind this specific play, though the author appears to have taken severe liberties with history as to what he thinks may have happened, when in truth any perpetrator of any similar crime was probably already vetted and in the Tower of London or chained in some dungeon awaiting trial. But, having said all that, this is how serious Queen Elizabeth and the house of Tudor took policing threats to the state.

Again, a general in the age of sword and shield contriving to murder his king, when all he had to do was lay a bill before him or threaten to take the kingdom by force of arms, then suddenly decides to brew a murder?  And this production team fails to address that?  You be the judge.

Even so, the series does try to look into the author's intent, albeit with overanalysis.  It's not a series I would reccomend. Look elsewhere for insight into Shakespeare.",1413676800,2,4360,4.551150895140665

I am not sure what to believe on if Shakespeare is the real author or just a lucky man that received the plays to put in his name, but I would suggest watching both.  This series does ask that question of the genuine author in episode 3 but the rest of the series holds true to Shakespeare being the real author and trying to prove why.  This still isn't the main point of the series, it covers a few of the favorite plays and why actors love delving in to become the main character.  It shows clips from recent plays done on film to some clips going back to  early 70's.  I love Shakespeare and only wish the series would of continued to do a few other favorites like ""Midsummer's night dream"" and ""Taming of the shrew"".

I love Shakespeare (despite the butchering my high school English teachers applied to Julius Caesar and Hamlet) and finally understanding some of the historical background of the plays, plus the insight into the minds of the characters, how the actors come to understand the characters, and into the mind of Shakespeare himself makes the plays even more wonderful.

5547453,5,B00B1E6EAY,"I must preface my comments about the show by stating that I love Shakespeare's work, but I am far from being an expert. With that said, I have found the episodes that I have watched packed with information not only about the plays themselves but also about specific characters or important themes that run through the plays. It is not just a boring documentary, though. The shows are guided by actors or directors who have had intimate involvement with the plays and characters that they are presenting. There are numerous clips from different performances and interviews by various actors to portray characters or perform in the different plays. All of this gives a broad picture of what Shakespeare was likely trying to do in the plays. The show seems to approach the plays not just as literature but also as performances which is precisely what Shakespeare wrote them to be. Rather than giving definitive explanation of the plays, the show fleshes out for a modern audience the questions that were being asked giving us, the audience, opportunity to make up our own minds and consider more fully the questions woven into some of Shakespeare's greatest plays.",1397520000,4,1161,4.928571428571429

But the people he spoke to were interesting. I've met Professor Garber a few times and Greenblat once--he came to Stony Brook to lecture and was very nice to me.

The most disappointing episode was the third--Derek Jacob's take on RICHARD II.

I took a class in College in Shakespeare and for someone who had just heard about it, or just tried to read it on my own with no context, it was thoroughly enjoyable and a tremendous experience.
It always amazed me to watch real actors say the words. It makes more sense that way. And when you know the background and the history behind the plays, or poems for that matter, you realize how morally ethical Shakespeare was. He believed in what it is to be human. The comedy, and the tragedy, and the outright horror of our everyday life.
Yet, he did all of that in a VERY entertaining way.

5547535,4,B00B1E6EAY,"I loved watching the actors explore the plays and the iconic roles created by Shakespeare. The actors are pretty impressive-- Derek Jacobi, Jeremy Irons and the Redgraves, among others, give us insight into the actor's craft as well as some of the masterful moments in the plays. But Ethan Hawke? Some of his questions and comments suggest that he wasn't paying attention during high school when his class was reading Hamlet. Maybe it doesn't matter who you are. The Redgrave family seem to focus more on their parts in the plays rather than the plays and Derek Jacobi brings up the question of Shakespeare's authorship that is quite controversial in some circles. But what resonates are the words of Shakespeare's plays and the insights that the actors provide. It's interesting to learn of the various nuances brought to the roles by different actors and given the complexity of some of Shakespeare's characters and plays, like one of the actors noted, he would play the role differently 20+ years later.

Each show offers archival footage of the plays, conversations with experts and other actors on the plays and the roles. Hawke is a curious choice for looking at Macbeth; I wasn't aware he'd done that much Shakespeare, and thought someone like Ken Branagh might be more suitable. Derek Jacobi, the stellar British actor, explores Richard II, even suggesting that Shakespeare might not have written the plays. Director Trevor Nunn sheds light on The Tempest and the place in life Shakespeare was in when he wrote it. Joely Richardson brings us the lighter comedies, in the form of Twelfth Night and As You Like It, examining what each in turn meant to audiences and actors at the time and in the centuries since. David Tennant explores the greatest Shakespearean play and part by talking about Hamlet. And the best episode of the lot follows Jeremy Irons as he looks at the plays about Henry IV and Henry V.

5547641,2,B00B1E6EAY,"Interesting in parts but largely saccharine attempt to ""explain"" Shakespeare from an actor's point of view. Sir Derek Jacobi and Jeremy Irons score very high marks. Ethan Hawke and Joley Richardson somewhat less so. What is most interesting about the program is the archival footage, and how differently different generations of actors approach the same material.

But if you REALLY want to learn Shakespeare from the perspective of actors and acting, you'll get a lot more out of watching ""Slings and Arrows"" -- a Canadian production that ran 3 season about a struggling theatre company and its angst-ridden managing director and his attempt to mount Hamlet, Macbeth, and King Lear (each treated to their own season).

Where Shakespeare Uncovered really subverts its benign educational intentions is its treatment of the Authorship Question--which is lamentable, rushed, and suspect. Repeating the bromide not once but twice that Hamnet, William's dead son's name, ""inspired"" the play Hamlet, is particularly odious. The Jacobi conversation with a de Vere descendant was presented--perhaps deliberately so--particularly disjointed. Simply put, this 6-part doc is not the forum to discuss the rather serious subject of authorship--so why even include it. Actors should stick to acting, not repeating historical untruths, suppositions, could-haves, maybes, it-is-possible-thats. Jacobi, at least, looks at the authorship issues with eyes wide open, unlike most academia who are more protective of their endowments and careers than truth.

But then again, no one wants to be played the fool. And, as D. Dennett once said, ""There is no polite way to suggest [that] someone [may] have devoted their entire life to folly.""

Shakespeare Uncovered attempts to ask: Is Shakespeare the ""soul of the age"" or, as Harold Bloom put it, ""the inventor of the human,""

Sadly, it doesn't get very close, since actual, real, paper-trail-documented history has more records pertaining to Wm Shakespeare as a money lender, a hoarder, a petty businessman prone to sue other parties pretty frequently, than anything even remotely resembling an author.

My point is, if you're going to bring it up, at least be honest about it.  So, questions that have haunted the world for hundreds of years, bedeviled or sustained by an extraordinary body of missing or misinterpreted information, depending on which side you keep, are avoided altogether. The program doesn't even mention the Sonnets, a subject even Strafordians avoid, because there is no way to connect them to the Wm Shakespeare they purport was the author. Largely autobiographical, the Sonnets are like an out-of-body experience, so directed, so pointed, so heartfelt, so personal, and so beyond the experience of a glover's son, that academics wish they would just go away.

Here is what the program didn't tell you:

There are three Shakespeares we know of, each a cipher, each unconnected by history or direct facts, each incomplete without the other. There is the Stratford-on-Avon Shakespeare, the glover's son, more commonly spelled Shaksper, six signatures extant, each painfully scratched out and each spelled differently. There is the London ""William Shakespeare,"" known to the Globe and several other theaters in a peripheral way, who seemed to be more of an investor than an actor and certainly never irrefutably publicly credited as the writer of the plays. And finally, the courtly `William Shake-speare,' hyphen intentional, attributed to the plays and printed on many of the title pages. I say courtly because the entire canon, including the Sonnets, is singularly devoted, with few exceptions, to such royal ways far, far removed from the normal experiences of a glover's son or the ""actor.""

Scholars consider all three to be one and the same. That may be true, but there are many complications.

In 400 years, not a single manuscript, not one poem or letter, no diary or even marginalia, has ever been found written in the hand belonging to the Stratford or London Shakespeares. The ""evidence"" linking Stratford to London to the writer of the plays is circumstantial and inconclusive at best. What does exist are a series of small-time business deals, money lending documents, litigation and court records that could scarcely fill a document ten pages in length. To compensate for this, the Shakespearean biographies (devoted solely to the man from Stratford) rely on a multitude of ""could haves,"" ""must haves,"" ""it is possible thats,"" and ""let us imagines..."" to reconcile the vast emptiness of concrete information. It is this extrapolation, heaped on over the years by conjecture and misinformation, that has clouded the truth. Any book suggesting otherwise is met with extreme derision and boycott.

Out of this void, we are told, rising like a phoenix from the ashes, a person of common rank rose and singlehanded defined the English age of enlightenment and set the standard for the Western Canon--an illiterate man who could barely write, certainly could not spell; who owned no books and knew no languages other than English; whose education is suspect or even non-existent; who never traveled much beyond London or Stratford and never out of England; who was never, ever associated to any royal household; who anonymously burst upon the scene and wrote furiously for 15 years--and I mean furiously--the sum total, not including apocrypha, equals almost 1 million words, including 3,000 new ones, at expert level, on matters of law, science, royal habits, the navy, falconry, and references to numerous books in their original language, just to name a few--and then abruptly stopped and ""retired"" back to Stratford never to pick up a pen again even though still 14 years from his death; who died anonymously and without fanfare, survived by a wife and two daughters, all three of whom were illiterate as well; whose name was never uttered or referred to in print until Ben Jonson' cryptic introduction at the publication of the first folio 7 years following his demise--this--this-- is supposed to be the man who is the greatest writer the world has ever known?

But I say, let right be done, and let's follow the words of Shake-speare himself:

From The Merchant of Venice:
LAUNCELOT: Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of
the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his
own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of
your son: give me your blessing: truth will come
to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's son
may, but at the length truth will out.

It was Edward de Vere himself who wrote:
""But I hope truth is subject to no prescription, for truth is truth though never so old, and time cannot make that false which was once true.""

Not un-coincidentally, in Measure for Measure, there is this line:
""Nay, it is ten times true: for truth is truth. To the end of reckoning.""
Needless to say, when it comes to Edward de Vere, there is much to meet the eye, and coincidences and references like the example above number not in the tens, or hundreds, but thousands. Indeed the Canon becomes a virtual autobiography of the life and times of Edward de Vere and his family and ancestors.

My point being, nothing from Wm Shakespeare the glover's son was ever found even remotely linking him to anything written, ever. The man couldn't even write his own name.

How fine it is to have Derek Jacobi, one of his generation's best actors, taking us through the political battles of Richard II.  Jeremy Irons is equally adept at narrating the Henriad.  But what were the producers thinking when they tapped Ethan Hawke to guide us through one of the Bard's greatest, darkest, most sublime plays is beyond me.  He comes across as knowledgeable as that fine critic Opie Taylor - the only thing lacking is a ""Gee Whillikers Pa"".  He asks a fellow expert what ""Murther"" could mean.  When he is told the answer his eyes bug out ""Really?  Murder?""  Was neither IanMcKellen or Patrick Stewart available?  What about Rowan Atkinson?  Another low point is when Jacobi stuffs his inane theory that Shakespeare did not author the plays down our throats.  The Earl of Southampton did indeed write poetry under his own name and it is worse than mediocre - are we to believe he only wrote well when using Shakespeare as a front? Absurd. It has no business in this program, but one guesses Jacobi demanded to be able to make his wild speculations or he would not participate.  I am second to none in my admiration for the man's acting prowess, but the cockamamie theory he advocates makes me wonder about his native intelligence.  It is always wonderful to have Trevor Nunn as a guide through anything Shakespearean and he does a yeoman like job with ""The Tempest"".

8560725,5,B00B1E6EAY,"The target audience of this series is pretty straightforward:  fans of the Bard who want to gain a better understanding of his plays.  The present DVD dissects 3 of his plays;  1 comedy (A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM), 1 history play (ANTHONY & CLEOPATRA) and 1 tragedy (KING LEAR).  We get an actor's perspective of the plays from myriad talented thespians such as Christopher Plummer, Ian McKellen, Kim Cattrall,  Joseph Fiennes and Hugh Bonneville.  We also get the perspective of directors and professors of literature as well.

This series offers trenchant insight into the plays as well as historical nuances and allusions which most modern day spectators would not be apt to pick up on as some of these subtle aspects have been lost-in-time.  Seeing the play through the eyes of the audience of the late 1500s and early 1600s is quite fascinating!

All in all, if you're a fan of William Shakespeare then this series is a MUST have!!",1498435200,3,936,4.836477987421383
