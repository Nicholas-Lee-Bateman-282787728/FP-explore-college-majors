8272511,1,B00198IWDY,This was a big disappointment and was way below my expectations. I would not recommend it unless you want to throw your money away.,1242691200,2,131,4.5
8272512,1,B00198IWDY,"A complete waste of time, just maddening, not worth six cents. The one positive review posted here is from the guy who made it, and giving it five stars, like it's CITIZEN KANE or something. I wouldn't have posted a review except that the unfairness of a guy posting a five-star review of his own movie offends me, and I'm hoping my one-star review (I too wish I could give zero or negative stars) brings the average down to one star where it belongs.",1221264000,2,451,4.380952380952381
8272513,1,B00198IWDY,"I'll start with the Positives:

1. Good DVD cover
2. Nice looking girl interviewer.
3. It includes Ray Harryhausen.
4. Topic is KONG!

Negitives:

1. It should state in KONG sized letters ""STUDENT PROJECT""
2. Poor Lighting.
3. Male interviewer dressed inappropriately.
4. Price should be $0.00-$3.00.",1220054400,4,300,5.340425531914893
8272514,1,B00198IWDY,"I ordered this thinking it was the original 1933 version of King Kong with some extra bonus material to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the film. That was MY fault for not reading the webpage carefully enough. So, first off I was disappointed that the film is not included. After that, however, I tried to warm up to the documentary. The case says ""special MAKING OF FEATURETTE."" They want you to think they mean the making of the film ""King Kong,"" but it isn't. It is the making of this pretended documentary. I don't recall the making of featurette even having sound.

This DVD does NOT tell you how the 1933 King Kong film was made. The interviews are NOT with people who made the 1933 film ""King Kong."" On top of that, they do not even ask the questions we would want to ask of the people they DID choose to interview.

And, it is a waste of DVD space. While a DVD can hold up to 3 hours of DVD-quality video and sound, this ""documentary"" (I have NO IDEA after watching it what they are claiming to document,) is a mere 25 minutes long.

As they say in ""The Muppet Movie,"" I've seen detergents leave a better film. The one star is because the rating system does not allow zero stars or negative stars for having me waste my time and money. Repeating a line from ""Gilligan's Island,"" this is the sort of film you walk out on - even on a plane.",1214784000,4,1348,4.2784313725490195

Someone that thought they knew how to edit Video  tried making a DVD.
The reason none of them will play is that the files are not named correctly.
If you waste the time it takes to transfer the files to your hard drive and rename them you discover that the  encoding is substandard with audio jump cuts, pixelization , flaring.
