This is the first film I have seen by Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan, a film festival favorite who won the main award of the 2014 Cannes film festival with this. I wasn't thoroughly convinced by it (it's too long, almost three hours and fifteen minutes and the characters engage too many times in aimless philosophical discussions), though it has its moments. It is a mostly ""true to life"" film, though being true to life doesn't always makes a movie interesting.

The main character is Aydin (Haluk Bilginer) a retired actor who lives in picturesque Cappadocia managing a boutique hotel he has inherited from his father that is seemingly carved in rock. He has also inherited properties in the surrounding area. Aydin sees himself as a sort of the area's enlightened feudal lord, though some of the villagers would beg to argue with the enlightened part, as he is often in violent conflict with those who are late with the rent. Among them is the tough ex-convict Ismail (Nejat Isler), who lives in a dilapidated house with his wife, their son Ilyas (who at the beginning of the movie throws a rock to the car in which Aydin was driving) and his brother Hamdi (Serhat Kilic), the ingratiating, obsequious local imam. Ismail would return towards the end of the film with one of its best scenes, when he pointedly rejects and destroys a valuable present brought by Aydin's wife.

In the hotel, Aydin lives mostly with his nagging, recently divorced sister, Necla (Demet Akbag), his tough, capable assistant Hidayet (Ayberk Pekcan) and his younger, beautiful wife Nihal (Melisa Sozen). Aydin and Nihal doesn't seem to be getting along very well, and Nihal tries to enliven her boring life by engaging in charitable work with the area's broken schools, an activity that Aydin mocks. Necla and Nihal criticize Aydin as arrogant and presumptuous. He spend most of the time in the hotel writing a column for the local newspaper (a paper no one reads, according to his sister) and preparing a volume on the history of the Turkish theater (Ceylan might be a bit as presumptuous as Aydin: in the end titles, he quotes Chekhov as a main influence on him).

Not much else happens in the movie in terms of plot, as it is mostly about the relationship between the various characters. The characters are recognizably real, though none of them is very likable. Interestingly, there is a clear distinction between the secular outlook of Aydin and his immediate family and the conservative values of the impoverished, religious villagers, all of whose women use the Islamic scarf.

I wouldn't recommend this film to a casual film-goer, but those who appreciate difficult, arty films, will probably enjoy this. The acting in it is phenomenal.",1425600000,,2773,4.904051172707889
8694630,1,B00R94BY8M,"This film says it offers English subtitles but there are almost none, consequently you have no idea whatsoever of what's going on or who's saying what. I cannot believe this is sold with subtitles the film-makers thought were sufficient to understand and appreciate this film.",1423267200,3,276,5.155555555555556
8694631,5,B00R94BY8M,"Aydin (Halik Bilginer) is a very talented man, writing opinions in a local newspaper. His wife Nihal (Melisa Sozen)maintains a discret distance with him. Both live in a small hotel. Aydin's sister (Necla) keeps a low profile respect him.

Bitter comments and points of view that are far to collide maintain the spark on, which leads to continuous discussions and subtle differences that conform a tense atmosphere. A concise and well rounded picture that gets its goal: To show us the human condition into a hostile ambiance.

Bergan's style is all around the film (The hour of wolf) plus the slow-paced style of Tarkovsky will keep you in your seat from start to finish.

Let's face it: It's not an easy film to watch. It's author's cinema all the way through.

Magical moments and crude realism make of this movie a must-see.

Don't leave it aside.",1421884800,3,850,4.794520547945205
