7177198,4,B00XN5U6QC,"112 Weddings opens the eyes to viewers about the realities of getting married. The struggles and battles for each couple varied, the director picks up perspectives from many different viewpoints which make it a much unbiased film about matrimony. This is a great example of what hard work and dedication comes out to be. Most couples that decided to fight for their marriage agreed it was not easy, but worth it. They tackled their challenges to better their families and situations. Some couples had children with illnesses and learning disabilities, other couples battled illnesses within themselves such as depression, while a few fought drug abuse. The documentary interviews people up to 18 years in to their marriage, yet still stayed current recording one couple a month before their wedding up until their actually wedding day.  Some couples even make the film richer by giving the viewers advice like ""all couples go through phases"" and ""don't get married"".
While there was so much great detail about the film, there were also some that I personally didn't enjoy. Only one interview was painful to watch and that was couple #71. The wife and husband seemed distant although they wanted to pretend they were happily married. They had a very uncomfortable moment and instead of Doug stopping the cameras and respecting the situation, he asked her more personal questions that choked her up even more. Doug should have omitted some of that clip simply out of respect.
It is hard to compare this documentary to others because it is not trying to convince people to agree with the director as most documentaries try to do. I feel the purpose of this film was to give the audience a feel of what couples actually go through behind closed doors. It corrects most stereotypical ideas of marriages such as the ""soulmates"" concept and why the ""happily ever afters"" aren't really real. It shows mini flashbacks of their wedding day then goes to their present day situations. It shows you the before and after results, giving you the option to take the information
you need or want to keep based off their experiences.
Overall, I feel this film was a great timeline of love stories. It is a learning experience for people who have never been married. I now understand the seriousness of marriages and know people go through problems much deeper than the typical infidelity or lack of love problems. I would recommend this film to many different audiences for multiple different reasons. The most obvious would probably be the people who have never been married and want to learn about marriage or claim they will never get married. Just so they can see things from a different perspective and learn some things they might be surprised they didn't know. I'd also suggest for engaged couples to view this film so that they know what they are getting themselves into and feel more secure going into such a big commitment. Most importantly, I'd recommend it to couples going through rough times in their marriages. Sometimes people just need a reminder or a little motivation to remember why they got married and this film will do exactly that for the people truly in love. Others might feel bad or even guilty they want a divorce but watching this film might help them realize it is okay to not invest time into a marriage that makes you unhappy. Any perspective you view it from, the documentary is still a great learning experience and even if you don't necessarily want or need a learning experience, it is still an interesting movie to watch. Doug Block is a talented director and independent cameraman for special events.",1446076800,,3620,4.86709886547812
7177199,4,B00XN5U6QC,"Very interesting and thought-provoking video which initiated great conversation with my husband and my daughter who is getting married next year.  Love is just the beginning stage of any marriage...thereafter it takes commitment, persistence, kindness, respect, sacrifice, and luck.  The featured couples were interesting subjects and all had different takes on marriage.  I highly recommend people who are at any stages in their relationships to see this.",1445472000,,456,5.776119402985074
7177200,1,B00XN5U6QC,"I am in a happy and wonderful marriage and I strongly dislike this documentary because I thought that it was so biased.  The filmmaker only happened to visit the ""most memorable"" couples - the ones with strong personalities, unusual weddings, etc.  And yet, many times (all too many times unfilmed, unseen) are the happy, quiet couples that aren't newsworthy - yet they live their lives in love with each other to the end of their lives.  This documentary did not show that; artistically, it was showing an edgy, dark side of marriage that made it not worth giving a lifetime commitment to another person.  There were so many couples on this documentary, who seemed to be chosen for their dramatic characteristics, who totally skewed the equation to the dark side.  Less than half of the couples ended up staying together in this documentary, and almost all of the ones who did were unhappy.  This documentary plays into our fear of marriage and commitment, showing how it can be the biggest, most draining sacrifice of one's life, which is just terrible because a good marriage is such a beautiful, wonderful, precious thing to be cherished..not some dark, moody play where over 50% of people get divorced.  What I truly dislike about this documentary is that it is not a truthful depiction of what marriage is.  AT ALL.",1443398400,8,1321,4.814159292035399

7177203,5,B00XN5U6QC,"This is one of the funniest and most life-affirming documentaries that I've come across in a long time.  Wonderful insights into human nature, at its most hopeful and most vulnerable.  Delightfully affirming and tantalizingly edgy!",1437004800,,231,5.571428571428571
7177204,5,B00XN5U6QC,"One of the most dedicated filmmakers of today, Doug Block has created a documentary that is always interesting and many times, spellbinding, from beginning until the end! I would recommend this presentation for anyone - whether in a relationship or not and whether married or single. You WILL learn something about human nature and marriage(s), while you are having a blast watching 112 Weddings!

Fun to watch with someone you love or while you're all by yourself.",1436659200,,465,5.038961038961039

8716347,5,B00XN5U6QC,"This is not only my favorite Doug Block documentary, but one of my favorite docs period. At times funny, at times sad, but always thought-provoking, well-paced and enjoyable. The characters are remarkably candid and human. As with the best movies, it's one that you are still thinking about the next day. It's fascinating to read the range of reviews in this case, because it really shows how much people bring their own biases and perspectives into viewing such a film, and focusing on the things that confirm them.",1483833600,,516,4.875
8716348,3,B00XN5U6QC,This almost beat the Verbadoes - all those couples that get married on that island (Bermudas) that has the great scenes of girl-prep to white-hood - the only thing missing is more follow up - should have had 75  couples - high expectations - and gone through all of them; past present and future.,1482710400,,296,4.481481481481482

8716351,3,B00XN5U6QC,"It's a clever concept for a documentary, but it's depressing. The couples profiled come from a fairly narrow demographic - they hired the filmmaker as their wedding videographer in the first place, which means they were in the NYC area, artsy, professional, mostly white, and interested in spending a chunk of money on a ""cinema verite"" wedding video. Most of them wrote their own vows; few of the weddings seemed overtly religious. The filmmaker seemed to have a downbeat approach to marriage - he kept asking (rhetorically, as a narrator) why anyone would even bother, why it was any different than living together. The consensus of the couples interviewed seemed to be that marriage was kind of okay. There were a couple of divorces (one husband traded in his wife of 20 years for a newer model after he lost weight and advanced in his career; another admitted that his mental health issues were too much for the marriage to sustain). The most touching stories involved hardship - the couple raising a seriously ill child, whose attachment is deeper and stronger because of it; the husband so devoted to his wife as she struggles with depression. I think this concept would make a fascinating series - I'd love to see couples from other subcultures and social classes and parts of the country, to see a documentary explore marriage outside the NYC bubble.",1464134400,5,1358,4.857758620689655
8716352,4,B00XN5U6QC,I really enjoyed this documentary.  Different couples with so many different perspectives.,1455753600,2,90,6.5
