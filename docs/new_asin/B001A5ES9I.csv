3445716,1,B001A5ES9I,"Don't waste your money if you want the real version of ROTJ. The package claims to have the real uncut version by proclaiming it is ""unrated"" and having the correct run time (77 v. 72 minutes), IT'S THE PG KIDDIE VERSION! The cut version of ROTJ is infinitely less fun, I NEVER would have wasted my time on this set without being lied to. It is deceptive advertising . Save your time and find the real versions. Pathetic",1472774400,,420,4.397435897435898

3445718,4,B001A5ES9I,"As a pretty big Batman fan I really enjoyed these movies, the quality of Mystery of the Batwoman is not really in my personal opinion on the same level of quality as the Return of the Joker but hey its Batman and its always fun.  I don't really enjoy the fact that this is a double sided disk product because it opens it up to the possibility of being scratched but if you are looking for a cheap way to get both movies this definitely does the job!  Oh and both movies have special features even though it says they don't!",1469318400,,523,4.1683168316831685

3445735,5,B001A5ES9I,Excellent  Product. A+++++++++,1412208000,,30,9.0
3445736,5,B001A5ES9I,"BIAS ALERT!!! First, you need to know that I am a huge comic fan and collector most of my life. Now before I tell you why I love this dvd. I must say that my favorite Batman animation is still ""Batman: Return of the Dark Knight Parts 1 & 2"". Now I love this dvd because Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman has a fantastic storyline. It is so good that even non-comic fans like my wife enjoyed it. Batman is always Batman so the children love it also. I have never been a huge fan of the Batman: Beyond Series but it has eventually grown on me. This film, ""Return of the Joker"" is probably the best outing of the Batman Beyond. Any time the Joker is involved the movie will be exciting. What makes this dvd special is that it fills in a lot of the storyline of Batman's younger days before he retired from being Batman. I don't like spoiler alerts so you will just need to watch it to learn all the added background information that is provided. We get to learn right along with Terry some of Bruce Wayne's greatest secrets. Don't miss this one no matter what or you will be sorry.",1409616000,,1076,4.202898550724638

3445739,5,B001A5ES9I,"This combination is outstanding.
I view both movies in a single evening and wanted more!
Nice to know that Bruce ends the movie on a uplifting note.
I would state what happens but I don't want to spoil the intrigue.",1374451200,,215,4.4
3445740,5,B001A5ES9I,"Great Batman Beyond story with a good twist to it, just gotta love the art style of the Beyond series. (Flip DVD over)

Excellent story of the Dark Knight and Batwoman...again, great artwork and a neat twist at the end...

Just an overall excellent DVD for those who are fans of the BATMAN!!!",1364428800,,292,4.490566037735849
3445741,5,B001A5ES9I,What more can I say?  It is simply good clean fun. If you enjoy DC characters you will enjoy this.,1362182400,,98,3.9

3445743,4,B001A5ES9I,"I've been wanting to see these movies for quite a while, so it was nice to get these.  They are great movies, and both worth watching on their own, the only problem is they don't really have any special features and both feature the censored version of each movie.  I would have hoped to be able to watch either version of the movie, or at least the uncensored versions.",1358640000,,370,4.3478260869565215
3445744,4,B001A5ES9I,"A good duo with the present and future Caped Crusaders, though neither is as strong as ""Mask of the Phantasm,"" ""Sub-Zero"" or either series.",1357344000,,139,4.833333333333333
3445745,5,B001A5ES9I,"I'm a tremendous Batman beyond fan. It may make me a heretic but I think it was probably the best of the Batman series. That's not to say that the other Batman's weren't very good, because I absolutely love those as well. The thing I like about Batman beyond is that it sort of crosses Batman with Spiderman. You got the kid who's not rich and has all the usual problems of trying to make things meet just like Peter Parker, but at the same time you also have the backing of Bruce Wayne so you have all the cool toys and a good explanation how you got them. The Batman suit is just great that series too.

Even with the cut version of the Batman beyond movie, it's still decent to watch. I've seen the uncut version and basically what happens is one scene ends in a death instead of a knockout. That's really the only difference I can remember. The only thing I never liked about the series that much is the women looked kind of scrawny. The other Batman series tended to have more attractive woman, just the animation style if it matters to you.

There's not really much I can say about the other Batman movie. It's just like watching a pretty good episode of the series, nothing especially special, but it's not bad in anyway.

This is a movie two pack from two great series for a very reasonable price. Go buy it and enjoy.",1292630400,,1326,4.296
3445746,5,B001A5ES9I,"I apsalutly love this.... My son is a huge batman fan so we got him this movie and he loves it he watches it all the time and its such good story lines expeshaly return of the joker,I enjoy sitting and watching them with him as well...
Its nice to becaue one is the original batman and the other in the new batman so you get the best of bouth... I definantly recamend this....",1249862400,,376,4.094594594594595
3445747,2,B001A5ES9I,"I read the other review for this double movie, and the BB Return of the Joker is the edited version. I doubled checked it by looking at the joker flashback scene and comparing it to a website that showed the different events between the editions. I don't know how much it matters that it is edited, but the other reviews for the main movie amazon listing recommend getting the uncut version. Also on the dvd, it says the movie is 76 minutes which might be correct for the uncut version but might be incorrect for this cut version.
I assume mystery of the batwoman is fine so you might want to buy the double movie if it is cheaper than just mystery of the batwoman.",1249344000,,665,4.328
3445748,1,B001A5ES9I,"This review is based strictly upon the edition details. The packaging states that Return of the Joker is 77 minutes (which is the uncut version), but is actually the 73-minute, ""kid-friendly"" edit.",1220313600,,197,5.1875
