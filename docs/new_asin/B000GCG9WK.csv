8551563,4,B000GCG9WK,"I really liked this Dvd, Especially the speacial features which shows you the ballet ""love stories"" in full. I just wished they talked a little more about the dancers and the new building.",1179705600,,188,4.7272727272727275
8551564,5,B000GCG9WK,"For those who love dance, and especially fans of the always-technically brilliant, thrilling Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, this DVD is a must.  The film mainly traces the development of ""Love Stories,"" a piece jointly choreographed by artistic director Judith Jamison, Robert Battle, and Rennie Harris.  Battle's section is particularly great, and Harris' hip-hop section is a terrific modern hybrid that manages to retain the sense of narrative that characterized Ailey's vision.  Dwana Smallwood is a star, and we get to see her not only onstage, but off, where she speaks with passion about what it means to be a dancer. I couldn't take my eyes off of the two male leads, Clifton Brown and Matthew Rushing, whenever they were onstage.  Amazing, too, to see how Russian theatregoers at the famed Mariinsky Theatre embrace both the performance, and the dancers themselves.",1157068800,11,879,5.212765957446808
