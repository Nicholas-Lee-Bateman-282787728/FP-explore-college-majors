8689945,5,B00Q05H0M0,"I am a very active 67 yr old , currently having knee problems. Going from Cathe, P90X, To chair workouts has been difficult. This dvd by Susan Tuttle is my favorite. Very pleasant instructor,not much chatter, just follow along. I can work out for an hour, at least getting some movement and circulation going. thank goodness. It is a very decent workout and the joint exercises are always good to do. If it is too fast for you, just go at your own pace. You will improve. I was able to do the second half with some standing and that was a great day. I got it at the library and then ordered my own copy. If it is not for you-donate it to the library, Goodwill or dvds for vets program. but I bet you will like it.",1518998400,,713,4.136690647482014

I'm buying all her videos one at a time.  This one was worth every dime.  Happy in Colorado",1513382400,,267,4.326530612244898
