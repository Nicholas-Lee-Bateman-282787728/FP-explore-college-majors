The Boys of Paul Street (Hungarian: A Pl-utcai fik) is a 1969 American-Hungarian co-production film directed by Zoltn Fbri and based on the youth novel The Paul Street Boys (1906) by the Hungarian writer Ferenc Molnr. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It features English-speaking (American and British) child actors (led by Anthony Kemp as Ern' Nemecsek) accompanied by Hungarian adult ones including Fbri's favorite actress Mari Tr'csik as Nemecsek's mother. Currently it is acclaimed as the best and most faithful adaptation of Molnr's source novel and a classic film in Hungary.",1295395200,5,656,5.238095238095238
