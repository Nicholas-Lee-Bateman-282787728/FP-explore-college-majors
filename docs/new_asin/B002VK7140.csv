3996302,5,B002VK7140,This DVD account should be required viewing in our school systems.  God Bless all of our Veterans for their Service!,1379721600,,116,4.8
3996303,5,B002VK7140,they need more true stories told like this one. We need to make this a mandatory read for all high schoolers.,1377216000,,109,4.238095238095238
3996304,5,B002VK7140,This movie brings it home I think sledge was there I know robert leckie was if you watch ken burns film you will learn who these great men where and from their humble beginnings from mobile ala north Florida Louisiana all them southern boys one shot Kelly,1365120000,,255,4.446808510638298
3996305,5,B002VK7140,So much respect for the Marines that went  through the horror that was Peleliu.  We knew quite a few of the Marines that were on the island.  Every single  Marine that went through combat on the island is a HERO.  SEMPER FI  and OOHRAH  to all the veterans that went through the hell on that godforsaken island.,1347753600,5,311,4.350877192982456
3996306,4,B002VK7140,"Many years have passed since this battle took place and many Americans are forgetting what our young men went through to start the defeat of the Japs.. The sad part about this battle was years later they said this island could have been by-passed,and we would not have lost so many youug men....this happened more than once...",1294704000,4,326,4.7368421052631575
3996307,5,B002VK7140,I thought this fleshed out the series as well as the books by Sledge and others.  Almost worth the price of admission to see Sledge in person after reading his books and watching the series.,1291161600,5,190,4.428571428571429
3996308,5,B002VK7140,"I loved this DVD... watched it twice already since I got it a few weeks ago. It's great specialy if you already read Eugene Sledge's book ""With the old breed"" which chronicles his service in the marines during the ww2 pacific campaign. The dvd has interviews with Eugene and lots of real film footage from the battle that really shows you this battle, which I think is the bloodiest fight ever to occure in history of this world.",1288310400,4,429,4.512820512820513
3996309,5,B002VK7140,When we serve in the Marine Corps we knew about Peleliu when we learned the history of the Corps.  What we did not learn was the personal moving experiences of the Marines who fought.  This is one of the best blends of video and personal narrative that I have seen and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know about the Pacific War.,1280016000,12,334,4.203125
3996310,4,B002VK7140,"If you liked the recent HBO documentary about ""The Pacific"", then you will love this DVD about Peleliu.",1274745600,16,103,4.777777777777778
3996311,5,B002VK7140,"As a son of a Peleliu veteran (12th Defense Battalion), this DVD was a must-have.  The interviews of the Company ""K"" vets are very telling at the physical, psychological, and emotional cost these men gave...and left on that island of coral rock.",1272326400,20,245,4.833333333333333
8382149,5,B002VK7140,The title tells the truth about what you will see. Many of the DVD's on Peleliu do not show how horrible our men had it on the island. Grahic but important to see and know.,1510099200,,172,3.942857142857143
8382150,5,B002VK7140,"If you are a history buff, especially about WWII, then this will be an eye opener about the Pacific Theater!!",1509062400,,109,4.5
8382151,5,B002VK7140,"Very good video.  If you want to see what the Marines went through and had to endure, this is the video.",1494374400,,104,3.9523809523809526
8382152,4,B002VK7140,Great to hear from the guys that fought this terrible conflict. It would be even better if there had been more real film footage.,1442275200,,129,4.416666666666667
8382153,5,B002VK7140,"This is another good video on the battle of Peleliu.  It highlights interviews with men who fought in Company K, 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division.  This video is excellent for explaining what the individual fighting marine experienced in this bloody battle, and the emotions they felt.",1431302400,,285,5.173913043478261
8382154,4,B002VK7140,My grandfather fought here and really enjoyed seeing this original footage. It was an incredible chapter in WWII.,1417996800,,113,5.333333333333333
8382155,5,B002VK7140,"E.B Sledge said to give the troops some hardening up before Okinawa, another of the generals' typical perspicacity, was brilliant.  It was savage combat that left holes in the psyches of each marine.  Then there was Okinawa another savage encounter with the japs.  I am fascinated by 'giganticism,'  of huge forces coming together as they did in Europe, the Soviet Union, and then the Far East.  This video was superb for showing the what it took to live if one were a marine and the little it took for the japs to die.",1409184000,,519,4.537634408602151
8382156,5,B002VK7140,"Great documentary. I watched The Pacific mini series then read Sledge's book so I decided to get the dvd. Great commentary from Sledge and several other veterans of the campaign on Peleliu. The sacrifice that these men made and the toll it took on them both physically and mentally is unbelievable. Great insights from these old warriors who are probably all gone now. As the character of Sledge's father said in the series ""you can't even begin to imagine what these men have been through"". I recommend this for anyone with an interest in World War II history, especially from the perspective of those who lived it.",1407196800,2,616,4.766355140186916
8382157,5,B002VK7140,"Peleliu is one of the battles featured in ""The Pacific"". It was a dreadful affair that took many Marine lives. Some veterans are interviewed which adds significantly to the impact of the battle footage. The realities of this brutal conflict should have a sobering effect on war hawks who are far too glib. Let us remember these men who were reluctant to talk about the horrors they faced!",1402963200,,388,4.720588235294118
8382158,5,B002VK7140,"The dvd arrived well packaged and expeditiously. The story itself as told by E.B.Sledge in ""With the Old Breed; Peleliu to Okinawa"" is  superb follow-up; probably the best infantryman combat story of WW II.",1395705600,,206,5.0588235294117645
