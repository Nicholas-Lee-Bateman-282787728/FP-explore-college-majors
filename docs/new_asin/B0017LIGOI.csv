8266391,4,B0017LIGOI,"This is a good group of clips, well done. Not quite as stirring as the Crave series clips by McManus. Shipped out quickly!",1353801600,,122,4.3478260869565215
8266392,1,B0017LIGOI,"This DVD has some cool short video clips (scenarios and erwin talking) but for the $25AUD i paid for it, it is a massive waste of money you hardly learn anything out of it and the short clips are a couple of minutes long maximum, half of them do not even make sense. There is probably all up about 30min running time on this DVD and I would recommend listening to his MOsaic podcasts on iTunes. These run for 40min+ each on each topic of which there is about 6 or 7, these podcasts are free aswell",1229644800,3,497,4.134020618556701
8266393,5,B0017LIGOI,I think this is a great new perspective on life and how to get the most out of it. A great read for anyone.,1220054400,2,107,3.5
8266394,1,B0017LIGOI,"If you have read one of Erwin McManus' books, you have read them all.  This book simply rehashes the same stuff he has said over and over before, and the dvd is made up of short films that have been used in his previous books.  It's a rip off.",1218499200,4,243,3.938775510204082
