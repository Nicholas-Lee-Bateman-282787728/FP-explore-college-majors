The second episode shares the examination of the collection as they aspire to figure out the sources of the items. Interesting.",1490918400,,381,4.757575757575758

Geo Channel when they first aired and tried to watch them whenever they showed again, but the channel would go in and out or the sound would cut out. Now I can watch and re- watch how one guy just metal detecting can start off a chain reaction of wonder and discovery of gold.",1425686400,,429,4.119047619047619
8492184,5,B0063RE55K,"Lost Gold of the Dark Ages is a production of the National Geographic Channel that consists of two televised hour-long programs about the Anglo Saxon hoard found in England by a metal detector enthusiast. Each program, without commercials, is about 50 minutes in length.

Each of the videos was produced at different times and contains a different focus. The first show was produced in the immediate aftermath of the initial announcement of the hoard's finding. It concentrates on Terry Herbert, the man who found many items in a farmer's field with his metal detector. It follows his initial finds and the chain of events that led to Mr. Herbert contacting the correct people. In Great Britain, regardless of who owns the land, the state claims ownership of any cultural or historic objects. There are penalties for not turning in any finds.

The DVD shows the levels of government and archeologists who have claim on the objects, their types and their conservation. The video gives the viewer a good backstory of the Anglo Saxon age as well as introducing the viewer to many of the objects through the video. The great mystery is why these are almost exclusively sword fittings: hilts, pommels, ""sword pyramids"", etc. There were no personal jewels or coins, just weapon parts...minus the blades.

The second show is better and, since it was put together after years of research and conservation were completed, was able to take a more in-depth look at many of the objects. I was surprised by the gold and garnet fittings for a seax, a combination weapon-tool common among the Anglo Saxons, that was essentially a single-edged short sword or extra-long knife. It is rare to see one of these weapons with so much decoration.

The second production takes the time to show many of the most spectacular objects and how they have been analyzed. The garnets used by the craftsmen of the day were from the area around modern-day Czech Republic and also from India or Sri Lanka, showing that there were very long, established trade routes even in the so-called ""Dark Ages"". Many of the ornaments are made from ""recycled"" gems or, in numerous cases, Roman glass.

This DVD also delves into the mystery of why this collection of mainly weapon fittings were buried, offering a number of scenarios. Ultimately, there simply isn't a context by which the hoard can be understood. There are no structures, graves or other evidence that could give us the clues as to the ""why"" of the hoard.

As someone who has read widely on Anglo Saxon England and the culture that thrived during that era, I was very interested in both videos. But, you don't have to be a devotee of Anglo Saxon culture or history to enjoy this DVD. If you enjoy history, treasure or science, you will find much of interest in these two productions. I recommend it with five stars.",1386201600,3,2835,4.811088295687885
8492185,5,B0063RE55K,"An intrepid treasure hunter (Tony Herbert) asks permission to search the land belonging to a small-time farmer - the farmer agrees, but tells him it's a waste of time because two others recently tried and found nothing. Regardless, they agree to split any findings 50-50 and Tony sets out. Within about 30 minutes he begins finding pieces. At first he believes them to be brass, then realizes they're gold. Continuing, he's amazed at what he finds, and at first the farmer doesn't believe him. Eventually, with help from archaeologists, over 1,600 pieces are found - ranging from small broken pieces and snakes to relatively large crosses. All the pieces are damaged, though many reveal intricate designs and many contain garnets.

Experts estimate the find is about 1,400 years old, from Saxon times, but cannot explain why the pieces are all buried together, damaged, and absent the steel from the swords many of the pieces were attached to. Valuation estimates place the total value at $5.5 million, split between the finder and the farmer.

What also impressed me was the total honesty of all involved - nobody tried to cheat another, and they willingly turned the find over to museum staff.",1338854400,2,1195,4.97
8492186,5,B0063RE55K,"This 9o minute DVD contains 2 programs that examine the amazing find of Anglo Saxon gold. The two programs are: `Lost Gold of the Dark Ages' and `Secrets of the Lost Gold'.
The first shows how Tony Herbert found this amazing hoard of gold. Using a metal detector in a farmer's field, that had already been explored by others, surrounded by highways; he comes across an amazing treasure. Many of the explanations are done by him and also the farmer, who had worked the field for years. This is a fascinating story and done very well. We see the different works that are found, all broken, folded and twisted, many with garnets and intricate designs.
There are the usual talking heads, but they are included unobtrusively; all wondering why there are no sword blades, but just the hilts and scabbards, a cross bent and folded. There is wonder and questioning; how did this huge hoard lie inches below a field, farmed for a thousand years? Why are all the pieces damaged and taken apart? We see the pieces as they are found and when they are cleaned.

The second program goes more into the speculation of why these pieces were there. Where did the gold and the jewels come from? How could they have been made in the Dark Ages?
The film does an excellent job in relaying the excitement and wonder of this archeological find. It answers some questions and speculates on many more. There are some reenactments shown and there are English subtitles available.
This is a DVD that those interested in the Dark Ages, English history, archeology and treasure hunting would find fascinating.",1331251200,6,1579,4.721014492753623
