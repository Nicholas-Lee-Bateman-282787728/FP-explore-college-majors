5974850,5,B00FC1ZC9Q,I always check with amazon before I shop with any other web store.  It arrived 9 individual blu-ray movies all individually shrink wrapped.  The movies are in both color and black in white depending on the film.  The picture quality varies but most all are excellent transfers.  Even if you don't like Marilyn Monroe the films themselves are excellent with great lead and supporting actors.  I personally like Joesph Cotton.  I won't individually review each movie since you find those reviews throughout Amazon.  Thanks Amazon for making this affordable.,1389657600,57,555,5.168539325842697

5974857,5,B00FC1ZC9Q,"What can I say about Marilyn? It is a shame that we lost her so early. I especially love her comedies, especially ""Some Like it Hot"".

I also particularly enjoyed, ""There's No Business like Show Business.""

I don't need to go into detail because if you love Marilyn, you already know as much as you need to know. I love the fact that I was able to get all nine movies at a good price.",1449964800,,384,4.1066666666666665

5974860,5,B00FC1ZC9Q,"Fantastic set. All the best Marilyn Monroe movies combined into one purchase. Found it during a sale and was great. Only issue was I would have liked them in a case and not strapped together individually, but you cannot beat a 9 film collection regardless.",1446508800,,256,4.711111111111111
5974861,1,B00FC1ZC9Q,"Bought this on a lightning deal for $30.  It was a gift for someone else.  It was a couple of months after the purchase before she tried playing the first blu ray.  The movie (Misfits) kept abruptly stopping in the middle and starting again from the beginning.  I had to do the troubleshooting.  I checked the disk itself to make sure it was clean and didn't show any defects.  I cleaned it with a soft cloth anyway just in case there was something there I wasn't seeing.  That didn't help.  I then tried starting after the point where the movie stopped using the ""scenes"" feature but it kept doing the same thing.  It never played all the way to the end.  I then checked the firmware on the blu ray player and found it was current.  I tried playing the disk on two other blu ray players with current firmware.  On each of those players, the disk did the exact same thing at the same point in the movie.  So it's the disk, not the player.  I tried resolving this thru Amazon, but they say it's too late to return anything.  Doesn't matter that most people are not going to open 9 brand new blu rays and watch all of them within the time period allowed for returns.  One star for lousy quality control.",1446508800,3,1201,4.294642857142857

If you do a little research, there should be no surprises there. The main thing that surprised me about this ""collection"" is that there isn't a box, or any special packaging. It just seems to be an ad-hoc shrink-wrapped group. The is price is good enough that absence of a box doesn't matter that much to me.",1441843200,4,474,4.459770114942529

You can read more details about each movie at their individual listings or other online review sites. I will tell you these are among Ms. Monroe's best cinematic features. I really enjoyed watching these movies again, especially since it's been a long time since I've seen most of them so, it was like watching these movies for the first time.

These are a good array of drama, mystery and comedy movies with many talented stars complementing Marilyn Monroe. I think this is a great set of movies to have in my DVD collection.

Having purchased this set in bluray format, the picture quality is a very good transfer from the original films with enhanced sound quality too. Really, this is a great set of Marilyn Monroe movies to have.",1438992000,,877,4.615384615384615

These films are largely scant on special features, but a great way to build up a collection, or upgrade batch of your Marilyn films in one quick movement.

Quick comment about the wrapping: These are each individually shrink-wrapped Blu-Rays, that are then sealed together in a brick with clear tape. The brick itself is then shrink-wrapped as well. It took a bit of time to unwrap the full kit.",1438905600,,660,4.632478632478633

I fell in love with a film that I had regarded as a minor musical. Some Like It Hot has and will always remain a favorite of mine. River of No Return was the first Monroe film, I can recall seeing. I was 10 years old and I fell in love with Marilyn. All the films have great transfers with clean, crisp photography.

She doesn't like many old movies, but like many people, she has a fascination with Marilyn & took the time to watch all 9 of these classic films. She enjoyed the comedy, the drama, the wardrobes, the sets & most of all MARILYN!! I had seen most of these when I was younger & forgot how funny they were & still are. The ones that I hadn't seen before were just as much fun to watch. I'm not a big fan of Marilyn's actual singing & acting (Her singing is especially bad), but the writing is good & Marilyn is easy on the eyes. We payed $38 for the set & let me tell you, it was worth every penny. If you're a fan of old films & are looking for some good old fashioned fun, then this is a good collection to keep you entertained for a while.
There are two black & white films (Some like it hot & The Misfits), two musicals (Gentlemen prefer blondes & Theres no business like show business), two dramas (The Misfits & River of no return), one film noir (Niagara) and five comedies (Some like it hot, Seven year itch, How to marry a millionaire, Bus stop & Gentlemen prefer blondes). So whatever you're in the mood for, Marilyn's got you covered.",1405814400,2,1195,4.177489177489178

It includes NIAGARA (some collections don't) which is one of her best performances, and a terrific film. The prints are terrific, and each disk has whatever extras are on the separate disks (ie they are all the standard commercial disks). This is not a boxed set, but rather all nine movies as stand-alone blu-rays. I only wish the collection had added a few more -- maybe 12 would have been perfect. No love lost with THE PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL -- I can easily do without that clunker. But one of my personal favorites is DON'T BOTHER TO KNOCK (which is not included here) -- if you're an MM fan and you've never seen it, watch it. One of her outstanding dramatic performances. I also miss LET'S MAKE LOVE, which is just an enjoyable romp between MM and her then off-screen lover, Yves Montand. These can be bought separately however, and if it's going to be 9 films, they picked a good 9, and the price is right. I'm happy I bought these, and then just supplemented them.",1405209600,,1079,4.454545454545454

They don't start smoothly or precisely, and many extra features play at one-quarter sized image in upper left corner of screen only. ""Niagara"" barely plays at all. Incidentally, this ""collection"" arrived as 9 individual Blurays shrink-wrapped together. Kind of curious.  Something strange here. I'd pass. I believe completely the reviews claiming defective disks. Performance may vary based on specific bluray players. Why take a chance? And, although I have purchased many items from Amazon with high satisfaction, please be keenly aware that you have a scant 30 days after delivery to return defective goods. I dare say most unfair in regard to series of DVD's and Blurays. Totally unrealistic to view a set in 30 days. I'm stuck with this defective product.

5974958,5,B00FC1ZC9Q,"As a life long Monroe fan, I've had these films on tape and dvd. What I really love about this blu ray collection is that it doesn't come in ""special packaging"" i.e. a bulky box with cardboard sleeves or the films stacked so that you have to remove a disc to get to the one behind (the pettily named Rooney/Garland collection comes to mind). These are in individual standard size blu ray cases that look nice.

There could be more extras. But, there are no fewer extras on the discs that were on the dvd releases. I'd love these films to get the full ""Criterion treatment"" they deserve, and when and if they ever do, I'll purchase them again.

Hopefully, Ladies of the Chorus, a Warner film, will finally be available on a region 1 disc as it has been in all other regions or better yet blu ray. Why Warner has prevented fans in North America from viewing Ladies of the Chorus is is beyond reason.",1394668800,,897,4.365269461077844

5974986,1,B00FC1ZC9Q,"The movies are excellent but the Blu-ray cases do not match the quality they are supposed to be protecting.  Most of the top movie companies have succumbed to making these super-cheap, paper-thin recyclable Blu-ray cases commonplace.  They should take a page out of Criterion, Olive Films and a few others who put their disks in well-protected cases instead of using cheap skeleton cases like they did for this great collection of Marilyn Monroe.  Who is going to buy a Blu-ray movie and then throw away the Blu-ray case for recycling? Nobody in their right mind would.  Because of their greater desire of maximum profit, they've disregarded the original purpose of the cases which were designed to protect  the artwork and the disk.  They don't even bother to ad bonus material like mini-posters or other niceties that were once part of releasing a movie on disk...not even a lousy menu--a cheap case and the disk and that's it.  In my opinion, the this low price is well deserved and justified.

It's nice to have all of the movies in their own boxes, plus the 2 extras (Bus Stop and Niagara) that were not included in that set.

The disks themselves have very limited special features, some only have the theatrical trailer. For the price paid ($39.99) I'm willing to overlook Fox not including anything extra. This is great for any Marilyn lover who may have not bought many of the films on Blu-ray as well as someone who is just now seeing these films for the first time.

This nine movie set is a great deal if you want ""Bus Stop"" and ""Niagara,"" even if you already have the seven movie collection, because for only $2 more than the cost of the two separate movies you get the other seven in individual Blu-ray packaging.
