1000575,5,6305265496,"I watched, 'Ever After' on video. I feel this has been a very overlooked movie. The casting of this movie was quite well done. Not to mention the costume designs in every area of this movie were elegant, superb. Some of the films' location shots are just beautiful. This is not the traditional Cinderella story we may be used to, however, it holds its own throughout the entire movie. Anjelica Huston makes hating her easy as Daniel's (Drew Barrymore) evil stepmother. Prince Henry (Dougray Scott) was unknown to me when I saw this movie. He does well in both his acting and is quite easy on the eyes. I found this story-line made me want to cheer for the good characters as well as the 'evil' characters getting their, ""Just Desserts"" I think this movie is a must see for the sentimental viewer as well as anyone who just plain appreciates the art of cinema. This movie is well written, cast, directed and full of great arty film making.",1518825600,,938,4.556213017751479

1000581,5,6305265496,"I remember watching this movie when I was younger and falling in love with it. When I turned 16 and my parents finally let me have my own debit card, this was the first movie I purchased! I couldn't wait to own it and be able to watch it anytime I wanted. I believe this is one of Drew Barrymore's strongest performances - she really makes Danielle shine as a heroine. The entire cast is just wonderful, and I especially enjoyed Angelica Houston's performance as the evil stepmother. She is so deliciously evil!

The romance and relationship between Danielle and Henry is one of the best portrayals in any Cinderella movie. Watching them fall in love is a true delight because it is so believable. They both want the same things - Henry to be free of his responsibilities as a prince, and Danielle to be free of her cruel family - and we watch them bond as they try to escape these aspects of their lives and confide in one another.

The costumes, setting and music are all fantastic as well! I really loved the soundtrack, it fit perfectly. I can't say enough good things about this wonderful movie, and it is definitely my most beloved.",1518134400,,1138,4.492753623188406

1000688,5,6305265496,"I remember when this movie first came out in theaters. I fell in love with it the first time I watched it. I ended up going back to the theater at least six times to see it again. I have never done that before or after for any movie that has come out. There is something so special about the chemistry of the Prince and Cinderella. I love how they made the story so realistic so I can day dream of meeting someone like that too one day. The witty banter that goes back and forth between the two main characters is so intelligent and I never get tired of hearing it. Cinderella saves the Prince from a lifetime of nothingness and superficiality. He saves her with his love too. They have true love for each other. It is such a beautiful movie, and Drew Barrymore is perfect as Cinderella. I can honestly say that no one else could play this role the way she did. She has an innocent charm that really gets into your heart. She makes me want to be a better person after watching how she passionately lives life no matter what the circumstances. She never pursued the Prince for ambitious reasons and actually found him arrogant, but he wins her over by making changes himself that are influenced by her and she truly falls in love with him. This has got to be my favorite movie of all time.",1515196800,4,1288,4.282786885245901

1000883,5,6305265496,This film  with Drew Barrymore is the best retelling of Cinderella Ive ever seen. It  tells the story of Cinderella but in a whole different way for instance one of the step-sisters was not wicked. One of the best  scenes-besides when the prince  went after her to apolagize for his actions at the ball and propose to  her-was when Danielle-the Cinderella in the story played by Drew Barrymore-punched  the wicked sister for  telling her her real mom was dead and having her fall over the bed.  This is a good movie. You should get it.,1505779200,3,535,4.557894736842106

1001016,5,6305265496,"This is one of my favorite versions of Cinderella, besides from the Disney cartoon version (I did NOT like the recent Disney live-action version). In this Cinderella, she's much more than just some poor girl that needs to be rescued, she's a strong independent woman. This is the ideal version of Cinderella if you want little girls to believe in themselves - she wasn't rescued by anyone, even in the end, she escaped on her own after being sold; and there are no magic or fairy godmothers, which sets a more believable tone to accomplishments and dreams come true.",1498262400,2,566,4.7272727272727275

1001090,5,6305265496,A sweet natured movie you can watch with a teenager and not expect too much eye rolling. A lovingly produced fairytale with a heroine you root for because she has spunk and sass while still being relatable and soft. Really fun movie.,1496793600,,233,4.571428571428571
1001091,5,6305265496,"This is not the Cinderella story a la the Disney animated movie. The characters are all real human beings and there is no fairy godmother nor a carriage and horses made from a pumpkin and mice nor is the glass slipper used by the prince to find his true love.

Indeed, this movie takes place in mid-16th century France, and the prince is expected by his parents to marry a Spanish princess for political purposes, and the movie does bring up the concept of social classes and obligations. Cinderella herself is strong and rebellious, but society and family restrict her as much as everybody else. Even the wicked stepmother is a product of her era-and she is subtle rather than shrill and over-the-top in her villainy.

The movie is not entirely realistic-Leonardo Da Vince is present as a court painter, and criminals were sent to the Americas, probably not done in that era. Still, this is a more realistic Cinderella than the standard fairy tale version, and well-acted all around.",1496188800,,984,4.7823529411764705

The stepmother is a complicated woman who inspires a twinge of sympathy even as she is scathingly cruel, and the stepsisters have distinct and entertaining personalities. And without giving anything away... the ""fairy godmother"" is delightful.",1476144000,3,570,5.274725274725275

1002682,5,6305265496,"Yes, another Cinderella story...  But I love this take on the old story and the extra stuff ADDS, doesn't detract or ruin in any way for me, even the attempt to gain a little sympathy/motivation explanation for the wretched monster the step mother (and at least one of the step sisters) is.  Drew is a very sweet while strong and believable Cinderella and her Prince, Dougray Scott, is worthy of her affection (and vice versa).  Cameo by Leonardo da Vinci is a brilliant addition, also.  Nothing is forced or senseless, with the possible exception of the ending of Cinderella not being further abused by the other monster in the film.  Somehow, without spoiling anything, that didn't quite ring true, why a man with no virtue would not take further advantage of his new ""house wench"" than he does.  We're GLAD this is the case, it just seems more a plot contrivance that what would really happen, this version, while a fairy tale, doesn't do that elsewhere, even amidst da Vinci's antics.

1002910,3,6305265496,"I gave the movie 3 stars because of Drew Barrymore who has a wonderful spirit in this movie.
But... like almost every movie in the 90s it is so laden with propaganda messages that it damages this old wonderful story.

1. Cinderella is turned into political dialogue early with the spunky Cinderella protesting the  serf rights. The language in these scenes is well written in service of their goal and even truthful and I didn't even mind this as an idea, but it is done with a heavy hand that makes the movie feel like it was written for this task only with the romance almost secondary but as with most movies in the 90s as with homosexual rights where everyone has a Gay family member and art is but a vehicle for a political goals... the movie suffers from untruth because of it.

2. About 3/4s of the way through the movie, Cinderella asks her step mother if she ever loved her after a touching admission... . This takes place in a garden. Now... in this period obviously Christianity suffused everything in Europe but in the movie to this point in the film, not one person has a cross around a neck or... is there any evidence of Christianity. This has been the MO of Hollywood that is obviously run proudly by Jewish producers and production companies and has been for nearly a 100 years and their antagonism for Christianity has shown itself for its real self only over time and only in increments. But a miracle does happen at this point in the movie,  a giant cross appears around the evil step mothers neck for I beleive the first time anywhere obvious in the movie and she says, a line about a ""pebble in my shoe."" A heartless, dark thing to say.

This was obviously intentional and I am not a Christian by the way but the slander of Christianity is so obvious at this moment that one laughs and feels anger as the manipulated.

Personally I detest all propaganda, as the poison and vehicle of prejudice.

The overall film is really not a very good retelling on any level of the well loved story. It has little magic, except Drew Barrymore although the male lead is well done but he is not well matched to Drew physically for some reason. All magic, Fairy God Mothers etc. too is gone.

The one bit of writing that is indeed cleaver and even beautiful in in the first 4 minutes of the movie.
The last Cinderella was done I think in about 2014, it was almost as bad as this one so... there is still an opportunity to do Cinderella in a movie with spirit and soul... . Hope that can happen.",1455235200,,2500,4.396103896103896

I have watched it so many times I can read all of the lines. It has such a wonderful story & beautiful scenery. I think Drew Barrymore & Anjelica Huston were perfect for their roles.

1003013,4,6305265496,"At the beginning of this tale we find the now famous Brothers Grimm summoned to the estate of the Grande Dame (Jeanne Moreau). It seems her great great grandmother is one Danielle Du Barbarac whose portrait hangs in the Dames parlour and is the true Cinderella of the Grimm Brothers fairy tale. The Dame wishes to set the story straight, but before doing so she shows the Grimm Brothers a very ornate slipper that appears to be made of glass! Thus the Dames telling of Danielles story begins. The story from here follows the traditional storyline of wicked stepmother, a Baroness, played so well by Angelica Huston and with at least one bad stepsister while the other by the end reforms.  There is much more interaction between Danielle and her Prince (Dougray Scott) long before the Ball, she masquerading using her mothers name, the Comtesse Nicole de Lancret, in order to save a wrongly accused servant. As they continue to periodically meet or run into each other, Prince Henry is amazed, marvels, and is even schooled by Danielle which opens his eyes and his heart. Although she is nobility, due to her station as servant under her stepmother and because she feels for the common people Daniele never considers herself noble. Megan Dodds gives a great performance as the reformed step sister Marguerite who due to her love of food sometimes faces the distain of the Baroness, her mother. The story even interweaves an older Leonardo Da Vinci, who eventually paints Danielles portrait as a belated wedding present. This grand retelling of Cinderella makes it a real story involving real people rather than a mere fairy tale from a book.",1451433600,,1640,4.857142857142857
1003014,5,6305265496,"In the film Ever After; A Cinderella Story, a Grande Dame (Jeanne Moreau)  opens with the story of a legendary woman. The film stars Drew Barrymore as Danielle, a woman whos life greatly changes after her father (Jeroen Krabbe) unexpectedly passes away. Danielle tries to forge a connection with her new stepmother Baroness Rodmilla De Ghent (Anjelica Houston) and her stepsisters Jacqueline de Ghent (Melanie Lynskey) and Marguerite de Ghent (Megan Dodds).  Jacqueline warms up to her but all the attempts that Danielle tries to get along with her stepmother are in vain.  Danielles life dramatically changes even further when she stumbles upon Prince Henry (Dougray Scott) taking one of the family animals.  Prince Henrys parents King Francis (Timothy West) and Queen Marie (Judy Parfitt) are well intentioned in their love for their son Prince Henry yet one source of friction is that they want him to marry as soon as possible  (whereas the Prince wants to naturally take his time and find the right one for him rather than just rush into an arranged marriage).",1451260800,,1065,5.028409090909091

This version was intended to take the story of Cinderella and show it in a way that it could have happened, without the fairy godmothers, talking mice, and evil cats.

The cast was perfectly suited for their roles. Drew Barrymore makes a splendid Cinderella, the wicked stepmother was brilliant. I also liked the fact that instead of two wicked stepsisters, she has one of them on her side. If you watch this movie, you will not regret it!",1439942400,,563,4.63

There was no romance in the story. The prince behaves like a pig and an idiot. The ""Cinderella"" character treated him like an idiot the whole time. She didn't respect him at all. Why the hell would she marry a guy she doesn't like at all?",1434326400,,559,4.273584905660377

I mean, they kinda had me hooked when I heard that it's basically ""feminist Cinderella."" It pretty much is, but outside of that it's just an interesting, well-written movie. I like that it's not literally a ""fairy tale"" where everything is perfect, but rather that heavier things like politics, philosophy, etc. get pulled into the mix. Not that the movie is dark, it's just more frank and realistic than your average fairy tale movie. If super sugary romance and fantasy make you gag, this movie is for you.",1432944000,,670,4.686440677966102

1004176,5,6305265496,"For me this is the definitive version of Cinderella. Gone is the improbable golden girl to whom the prince has lost his heart yet somehow can only identify her person by a shoe (really? she's the love of your life and you can only identify her by a shoe?) Instead we are presented a feisty, three dimensional woman possessed of wit, wisdom and strength of character; who commands the prince's attention and gives focus to his life.

So this is a first class script meeting an excellent cast. Everyone pulls their weight and the result is deeply satisfying - moving even for someone without a shred of romance in their cold, diminished heart. Like me.

The only other version of Cinderella I've even seen that has similar merit, though entirely different, was ""The Other Cinderella"" by the Black Ensemble Theater in Chicago.",1431129600,6,823,4.788732394366197

1004394,4,6305265496,"Ever After: A Cinderella Story (1998) stars Drew Barrymore as Danielle, the daughter of a wealthy commoner in 16th century France. When her father unexpectedly dies, Danielle becomes the servant girl of her arrogant stepmother (Angelica Huston). When she runs into the prince of the kingdom (Dougray Scott), he becomes captivated by her honesty, humility, wisdom and beauty. Meanwhile, her stepmother schemes to have her shallow daughter (Megan Dodds) marry the prince. Melanie Lynskey plays the younger stepsister while Patrick Godfrey plays Leonardo Da Vinci and Lee Ingleby plays Danielles guy-friend from her youth.

This is a quality costume dramedy/romance. Shot entirely in France at no less than four chteaus (castles), as well as some sweet wilderness areas, the film is awe-inspiring just to look at. The story is a little convoluted, so you have to pay attention to keep track of whats going on. Drew shines as the protagonist and Scott is great as the prince. The movie proves that you don't have to have overt sex scenes and nudity for a film like this to be effective or successful (which it was at the box office). I also like the message concerning the idiocy of societal classes and how one of the stepsisters is actually a quality soul.

The film runs 121 minutes.

The costumes are wonderful, the acting is so real and the story is very believable. The music is perfect.  Drews acting in this movie shows her ability to be believable in a period piece.  Cinema photography is fantastic!  The scene where she shows up at the ball,  has her in a very beautiful costume which is appropriate for the period.  A great romantic movie with humor.

A lot better roll model for little girls than the insipid lackluster Lily James portrayal of Cinderella. I took my daughter to see the new one in  theaters, so disappointed. Ever After actually has an entertaining plot and humor. I had my daughter see this version afterwards. New version has pretty costumes and the traditional pumpkin etc but it's completely devoid of character, particularly Cinderella who seems one dimension, willing to be run through without any push back.  Drew Barrymore made Cinderella a far more interesting person, willing to push back even in the most daunting of situations.

1005140,5,6305265496,"The best Cinderella story ever.  Why, because there is no fairy Godmother. There is no magic.  No mice become horses and a pumpkin does not become  a carriage.  There is, however, a very intelligent, caring young lady who is put to work by her step mother, Angelica Houston.  The step mother has a very complex story.  She is not, in fact, evil. She marries a man she barely knows. He dies leaving her with her children, a step child and an estate she can not afford.  She is a woman jockeying to get a daughter in the palace and improve her position as well.  She does not hate her step daughter, but she does resent her. There is no Ella. There is a Danielle. Drew Barrymore does not need the prince to rescue her. She is quite capable of taking care of herself.  This is simply an empowered, intelligent ""Cinderella"" who is concerned with far more than going to a ball.  Girls don't dance with someone at a party, fall in love and marry them after one evening.  This story is as complex and intelligent as you will ever find in a Cinderella story.

1005194,1,6305265496,"In eager anticipation for the upcoming, new Disney adaptation of ""Cinderella,"" (which I cannot WAIT to see!) I decided to rent this film, having never seen it. On the trailer on Youtube, many (very unfairly, I might add) were already bashing the new one from Disney, and insisting that it wouldn't be as good as ""Ever After."" After viewing the trailer, which made it look terrible, I still decided to give it a shot.

I have always really liked the traditional fairy tale of Cinderella. As we all know, there have been many different film adaptations of it, and some that add twists to the original story. This was one of them. I'm fine with plot twists, as long as you don't distort the main points that make it Cinderella. This just changed so much (i.e. not having a traditional fairy godmother, no pumpkin carriage, no having to be back before midnight, etc.) that it really ruined the story for me. I disliked the changes, but I disliked other things much more.

Probably the main point of contention I have with this movie is the Prince himself. I love romance myself, and in every other adaptation of Cinderella I have ever read/watched, I have always rooted for Cinderella to end up with the prince. But Prince Henry was such an unlikable, immature, arrogant douchebag from literally his first moment on screen that it made me really wonder WHY Danielle even fell for him. Their romance is actually rather rushed, and even in the end, when you know they will end up together, it was disappointing for me. He treats her so shabbily at the ball after finding out she is only ""a (lowly) servant"", and not a courtier, that again, it really made me wonder why she would even want him back. His sudden transformation at the end, for me, seemed forced and out of character, and for me, the Prince was as unattractive on the inside as he was on the outside. But I DID really love Gustav, Danielle's childhood friend. Honestly, I thought he was really cute and she had better chemistry with him, and that ultimately, she should have ended up with him. Marguerite and the Prince deserved each other.

Also, I really disliked the setting, and thought the costumes weren't that impressive. And certain aspects from the original that are included are so rushed it was really disappointing. The ball scene literally lasts maybe five minutes, if that!

The acting from the evil stepmother and the older stepsister Marguerite was very good, but, while you do like the nice stepsister, again, it's another change from the original that I thought was unwarranted. Both the stepsisters are supposed to be evil, not just one. And other bad guys in here just come across as cartoonish, like the man Danielle is sold to by her stepmother, who clearly desires her.

So, overall, I thought the settings weren't impressive, the overall changes with the story unnecessary, and the movie, to me, was terrible. Not to mention, I found the BRITISH accents when they're supposed to be playing FRENCH characters really jarring. But there's one final thing I will address that I really find curious.

Along with the new upcoming Disney adaptation, again, I have read many, many comments that are already attacking the main character, Cinderella herself, and how she is a bad role model for girls simply because she is kind, and does not descend to her stepmother and stepsister's levels. I even found an article online, saying ""Why girls should skip the new Cinderella adaptation and watch Ever After."" I really don't get this. For the large majority of the film, Danielle herself is passive as well to her stepmother and evil stepsister, and there is only one scene where she loses it and punches Marguerite. While she definitely deserved the punch, I really get annoyed when female characters are seen as weak nowadays just because they ""don't stick up for themselves"", as Danielle did. Other females have said that Danielle is an admirable role model for little girls simply because she does stick up for herself, and Cinderella in the new Disney version won't be just because she doesn't. Again, while the evil stepsister did deserve the punch, resorting to the same level as someone who is bullying you,  including violence, really shouldn't be a lesson that should be taught to girls. And it does take strength and grace to simply rise above the cruel way others may treat you, and be kind to them as well. But of course, resorting to violence and ""sticking up for yourself"" will ALWAYS make you a strong, admirable female character nowadays!! So what do I know, right?

Anyway, in closing, I really didn't see what was so great about this film, and it will never match the brilliance of Gail Carson Levine's
Ella Enchanted, and the 2004 film based on it, which is one of my all-time favorites, and one of my favorite live-action adaptations of Cinderella. Now *that's* how you put a clever twist on Cinderella!",1425340800,,4893,4.761792452830188

This was the most inconsistent overcomplicated retelling of a simple story and I've seen The Lone Ranger with Johnny Depp.  It was clearly written by a drunk with attention deficit  or a five year old meth head.  Go read any childs version of Cinderella or better yet, go watch Jerry Lewis in Cinderfella.  You will be a better person for yet.

Some of Drew's poor accent and stiff acting was a little distracting but the movie is so enchanting it doesn't really detract too much.  I did really like the male lead too.  His character development was well tended... and he's cute. ;-)  Some of the anti-victim-ness went a little overboard and I wish the prince had known a little more what she'd gone through, but other than that the writing was pretty tight except for a little inconsistency in the dialog.

Ms. Barrymore can be proud to show this movie to her children.  A classic and beautiful film.  It's a lush and sweet take on Cinderella that is by far one of my favorite modern romantic films.

A wonderful excursion that  delights the eyes and leaves the soul with joy and hope.  I wish somebody would tell Ms. Barrymore, this by far was her best movie.  Her self defining moment in time.

1006274,5,6305265496,"Best parts:

Chemistry and dialogue between Drew Barrymore and Dougray Scott--wonderful

Facial expressions, tone--so many wonderful acting moments

The fun dialogue and a multitude of memorable one-liners sprinkled throughout a pretty tight script.

Various ironies:
Leonardo daVinci's role in first drawing Henri, the prince, into a prince-like duty (saving the Mona Lisa) as the prince is desperately trying to get away from his responsibilities as prince.  Yet, daVinci is the man who played a significant part in releasing the prince from his ""gilded cage.""
The prince complains about how insufferable it is to be defined not by who you are but what you are, as he's talking to Danielle, who suffers from the same problem, being defined as a servant rather than as her father's daughter.  The whole day is spent as simply, ""Henri,"" being himself, while Danielle is actually forced to be someone else (Nicole) because her station in life would have excluded her, and almost did exclude her from being seen for who she was.

I love that Jacqueline at the end, as she's closing the door to Laurent, knowing the ""secret"" looks just like the Mona Lisa.

The mean stepmother(Angelica Huston) is magnificent as are the two stepsisters.  This movie is the equivalent to reading a very good book with fully explored characters.  Dougray Scott is fine as the Prince and love interest.,1416355200,,399,5.061538461538461

It had been so many years I had forgotten it, but when I came across it on Amazon Prime I decided to try it again: it was even better the second time I watched it.  Explained to the older kids that not all of it was very realistic, as expected, of course.  Some leering and passionate kisses included, for parents trying to determine age-appropriateness.  It was a relaxing evening for us all.  We recommend as a fun, relaxing evening for the adults and young-adults.",1415232000,,591,4.644230769230769

When I was a child, I understood Cinderella to be a passive character and I am glad that the screenwriter of Ever After didn't write Drew's character as a woman who simply needed to be saved.

1006899,5,6305265496,"I'll come right out and admit it -- I'm not a huge fan of romance.  I avoid the genre when I'm looking for a movie to watch or a book to read, and tend to roll my eyes when a movie feels the need to tack on a romantic subplot for no reason.  I don't mind a romance if it's a small part of a larger story, but when it feels tacked on by an executive or it starts to take over the story, I'm usually lost.  There ARE exceptions, however -- some of my favorite movies, such as ""The Princess Bride"" and ""WALL-E,"" are driven by romance, but I still enjoy them, mostly because there are other strong and fantastic elements besides the romance.

""Ever After"" is one of these exceptions.  It's a retelling of one of the most famous and well-worn romance stories of all time, but it's done with a fresh new take on the scenario and characters, with strong acting and a sense of humor to boot.

Danielle de Barbarac is the daughter of a widowed landowner in Renaissance France, who gains a stepmother and stepsisters when her father re-marries to the Baroness Rodmilla.  When her father dies shortly after the wedding, Danielle is reduced to the role of a servant in her own house, while Rodmilla outrageously spoils her daughter Marguerite and schemes to get her married to Crown Prince Henry and onto the throne of France.  Danielle isn't the sweet and nave Cinderella of fairy tales past, however -- she's feisty, stubborn, resourceful, and has her own ideas about how to better the world around her.  When she impersonates a noblewoman to save one of her fellow servants, she ends up catching the eye of Prince Henry, a rebellious royal brat who's struggling to find his own place in the world.  As Danielle and Henry butt heads -- and eventually fall in love -- their efforts are nudged along by Danielle's childhood friend Gustave and by the legendary painter/inventor Leonardo da Vinci.  But Rodmilla begins to suspect something is amiss, and she isn't going to let an upstart young servant get in the way of her plans...

The film doesn't look hugely lavish, like so many historical epics, but that works in its favor.  It looks more realistic and true to the time period, and doesn't pour on the glitz and glamor to try to pretty up the time period.  The scenes inside Rodmilla's manor and the royal castle look true to life instead of fairy-tale-ish, and most of the costumes look accurate to the time period (as far as I can tell, as I'm not a Renaissance scholar).  The filmmakers were trying to make a more historically realistic ""Cinderella"" tale, and in that they succeeded.

It's also refreshing to see the ""Cinderella"" story get a much-needed facelift.  When it comes down to it, the original Cinderella did very little to better her own circumstances, and mostly relied on her fairy godmother to make things better for her.  Danielle is an independent girl who doesn't constantly rely on others to improve the situation, and is capable of getting herself out of most scrapes.  And though she does get a little help from her fellow servants and from da Vinci, who serves as this story's ""fairy godfather"" of sorts, it's usually her own strength and wits that are her best assets.  It's also refreshing to see the Prince as, not a perfect Prince Charming, but a real character with flaws and development of his own.  And though the wicked stepmother and one of the stepsisters are as evil and mean-spirited as always, it's nice to see one stepsister, Jacqueline, as a sweet character in her own right.

The strong acting is what makes this film a winner.  Drew Barrymore, while she might not fit everyone's ideal of a Cinderella character, brings humor and toughness to the role, and plays Danielle well and strong.  Dougray Scott as the Prince does well too, playing both the petulant and immature brat of a Prince and the Prince who learns genuine humility and caring over the course of the film.  Angelica Huston is having way too much fun with her role, playing the scheming and wicked stepmother with relish and a constant smirk.  Patrick Godfrey makes an enjoyable Leonardo da Vinci as well -- eccentric and a little goofy, but wise and helpful.  Even the minor roles are enjoyable -- the royal parents bicker and snark at one another enjoyably, and the stepsisters play their roles to the hilt.

Not your typical Cinderella story, but still highly enjoyable.  Even if you're not a romance fan, you might still enjoy this film for its good acting, humor, and its ability to breathe new life into an otherwise tired story.",1412035200,,4533,4.638297872340425

1007123,4,6305265496,"Everyone knows the basic story of Cinderella ... the 2 ugly step-sisters and the greedy step-mother, but few could imagine the well-rounded, fleshed-out version of this tale.

Why was she treated this way? What were her responses? Was she that docile? Not according to Drew Barrymore's portrayal. Feisty, fighting back as well as she could to protect her late father's people and estate, yet all she wanted was to be loved. Who could not understand & sympathize her motives/actions?

Anjelica Huston as the greedy step-mother was marvelous and gets her just rewards in the end as does one of the 'ugly step-sisters'.  Ugly does not always mean facial features. It can refer to attitude and actions - as it does here. Ella's treatment of the servants and her responses to her own treatment by the 'steps-' win over the younger of the two step-sisters who was also on the receiving end of her sister and mother's treatment.

Several versions of fairy tales are appearing lately on the big screen - unfortunately.  This is not one of them. Make up a bowl of popcorn, grab a box of tissues, an afghan and curl up in a large chair on a wet, rainy afternoon. Pop in the DVD, sit back and enjoy.

Danielle de Barbarac was reduced to a mere servant girl after her father died.  Through multiple run-ins with the prince during which she challenged and criticized him, an almost Pride and Prejudice-esque romance blossoms.

I like that this Cinderella is very much independent and can pull her own weight.  The only criticism I have for her is that it seemed she was more fierce and amazing when not in presence of her stepmother and step-sisters, and seemed a little bit too naive for being mistreated 10 years by her step family.  The story explains this away with how she always wanted a mother, but still... I wanted so much for her to stand up to her stepmother the same way she stood up to everyone else.

Other than that, enjoyed this very much!",1409529600,,786,4.659420289855072

1007357,5,6305265496,"What can I say, I am a huge sucker for classical romance? I've always been a buff of Romance throughout history. I even majored in Authurian Romance in college. I really liked this re-telling of the classical Cinderella story. I was hesitant at first to picture Barrymore doing anything resembling a English accent -since EVERYONE else in the film seems to be of English descent- but she pulls off her own brand of accent well. She wisely stayed away from trying to sound British, and seemed to have settled on what could honestly be thought of as a 'commoner's' accent. After all, the movie is based in France, so an English accent wasn't really required. Barrymore and Scott had some good onscreen chemistry and Angelica Huston as the Wicked Stepmother was perfectly cast. Over all, it's a wonderful movie that just lets you relax and smile throughout.",1408838400,,854,4.816326530612245
1007358,5,6305265496,"Mom and I were thirty years apart in age, but there were some movies that we thoroughly enjoyed watching together. Pretty Woman, Ever After, and several Robin Williams movies were among our favorites.

Ever After strips away all the unbelievable stuff like fairy godmothers, pumpkins and glass slippers, and gives us a plot that actually could have happened, if you can believe an actual historical figure deciding to help romance along.

All of the elements of the Cinderella tale are here, but they have been contemporized (can't say modernized because the events are still in that time period). The evil stepmother might be driven by jealousy. The prince meets Cinderella out in the world and grows to love her because of her worldly charm and experiences.

Even the gypsies are lovable scoundrels, and I love the scene where they rob Cinderella and the Prince, but she gets away with her most valuable possession.

This is a movie I've seen at least six times in the last 15 or 20 years, and I will watch it at least six times more in the decades to come.

This movie is well worth my watching it again and again, and I highly recommend it to you for utter enjoyment and for its general plausibility.

She did so well in this role and has changed my perspective of her talent.  They also could not have selected a better actress than Angelica Huston to play the wicked step-mother.  She's superb.

1008949,5,6305265496,"The first time I saw this movie was 15 years ago, and as my title suggests-- I've re-watched it many times since!
I'm not a fan of original fairy tales.  In this one however, the writers took the fantasy elements out, and made the story believable.
It's interesting how they took real historical figures & events, and weaved the ""Cinderella"" story out of it (**see footnote for some examples**)!

Everything about this production has me hooked!  The actors: leading and supporting (I became a fan of Drew because of this movie).  Storyline, and dialogue (it's witty & comical).  Cinematography; scenery, and amazing old architectural buildings.  COSTUMES (I especially adore the ""Breathe"" ensemble.  **In my research I even found out the maker of the slippers-- Salvatore Ferragamo, and bought myself a pair by them, with the same metal embellishments*  But have yet to find their official replica of the slipper.)**  Musical score.  Etc., etc.!!
For these reasons, it has remained one of my all-time favorite period/costume dramas for a decade & a half, and that's why I give it 5 stars!
______________
**King Francis I (Henry's father) was a patron of the arts, and actually had Leonardo da Vinci as an artist in residence (who brought with him his famous Mona Lisa-- as depicted in the movie).  He was actually the one (instead of Henry) to open the Collge de France in 1530 where ""attendance is free and open to anyone"", and boasts one of  ""the best research libraries of Europe"".
He also sent expeditions to the America's, one headed by Jacques Cartier (who supposedly bought servant ""Maurice"").
His son Henry II, didn't marry a commoner as in the movie, but did have several mistresses.  One named Nicole de Savigny (who bore him an illegitimate son: Henri de Saint-Rmy).  The other Diane de Poitiers (almost 20 years older), was said to be his ""lifelong companion"", and for 25 years she was the ""most powerful influence in his life and the most powerful woman in France"".  She was also ""immortalized in sculpture and paintings"".  ""And possessed a sharp intellect and was so politically astute that King Henry II trusted her to write many of his official letters, and even to sign them jointly with the one name HenriDiane.  Her confident maturity and loyalty to Henry II made her his most dependable ally in the court.""  They however never had any children together, so the great-granddaughter/narrator ""Grande Dame Marie Thrse of France"" actually was Queen Catherine de' Medici's many times distant future g-granddaughter.
Finally, the portrait (wedding present) ""Head of a Woman"" by da Vinci, looks a lot like Drew/""Danielle"". **",1403481600,16,2638,4.9840182648401825

The cast of actors and the scenery was the best thing about this movie. I wasn't thrilled with fact that the main character gives the haughty prince a second chance, after he humiliates her in front of the whole court, telling her to address him as ""Your Highness"" rather than the name he had previously given her permission to use before he knew she was a servant in her household. Nope. If he used that tone once, he will use it again and again, whenever she's winning an argument. He was darn cute, though.",1402704000,,527,4.5

Danielle (Drew) became a servant in her father's home, after he passed away, because he'd recently married a baroness, whose ambition was to see her daughter become the queen of France.

1010618,5,6305265496,"This is a retelling of Cinderella that is funny and engaging for girls and boys, children and adults!  It even includes the character of Leonardo da Vinci. It begins with the Brothers Grimm arriving at the home of an older woman to hear the story of when she was younger.  She narrates the story to them in a way that makes it seem as though it could well have happened.  I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a family friendly movie enjoyable for all ages!",1389830400,,464,4.372093023255814

1010660,5,6305265496,"I had been meaning to see this movie for literally years and never quite got around to it. I wish I had. It's basically a retelling of the Cinderella story. It is set in the time period and told as a flashback by a supposed descendant of the main character, but it is one of those period pieces that has modern sensibilities written in. I'm not sure how historically accurate everything is, but does that really matter in a fairy tale? The actors were very likable and there was a lot of charisma between the main characters. The story was just different enough from the stock tale that it kept my interest. If you like love stories you should check this one out. It is very well-done.",1388361600,,685,4.4015748031496065

1010756,5,6305265496,What more is there to say??? This is every girl's dream come true. Minus the whole slave part. The thing I like about the movie is that the main character was mainly just herself (as far as her personality). She had courage and conviction throughout all she did. She was passionate about things she believed in. I wish she had told the prince the truth in the beginning. But I suppose that the movie would have ended too soon and there would be no suspense/drama to keep you tuned in to the story.,1385510400,,497,4.354838709677419

1010798,4,6305265496,"My adult daughter loves this movie, I, an adult male, liked it.  It's probably a bit more of a chic flick; however, I thought it was a great storyline as to how ""Cinderella"" could have emanated from a true story.  I think just about anybody would enjoy this movie, but definitely women a bit more than men...but remember I do like it too.

What I will say is that I saw this movie several years ago when it first came out. I like the genre and it's a good family fun movie. My rating reflects my opinion of the movie. I did have a problem with the Blu-ray disc. For whatever reason, it would not play in my player. I think it was a bad disc and not region issue. I ended up returning the disc and replaced it with the DVD version. It played just fine on my player.",1380844800,,538,3.8125

Even now that I'm older and better able to understand the story, it remains just as sweet and lovely as when it first came out. Ever After is the only Cinderella story I truly love and identify with. It meshes all the traditional aspects of the classic fairy-tale with history, realism, and whimsy.

Some of my favorite aspects (but not limited to): Leonardo da Vinci as fairy godmother, Marguerite's legs flying up over her head, the portrayal of Prince Henry as a floundering young man who is inspired by the woman he loves, gentle humor, and the wicked stepmother/ step sister getting their comeuppance.

Watch it and enjoy it! :)",1379894400,,783,4.625899280575539

I still even cry at the sentimental parts. Ever After - A Cinderella Story makes a fairytale come true, making you see where everything really could happen to someone, making you believe dreams can come true. Very realistic, evil step-mother and step-sister (one is actually nice in this), Cinderella (Drew Barrymore), and the ohhh sooo way too good looking for a man Prince Charming (Dougray Scott), all do a great job in this fairytale romance come true.",1374019200,,606,4.62037037037037

I guess there is someone in the world who isn't aware of Amazon's awesomeness!  :)

Getting back to the movie...I decided to purchase the Video on Demand version from Amazon for $9.99.  The quality of the streamng and the movie itself is second to none.  If you like ""good eventually triumphs evil"" type movies...this one doesn't get much better.",1371772800,,611,4.5

I saw it several years ago and just bought it for my daughter's Kindle.

Drew Barrymore is lovely and gracious & brilliant in her role. The stroyline expands greatly and makes it all so real & believable.  I always knew fairytales were base on some fact.  Though I never would have guessed who the Fairy Godmother was.

1011180,5,6305265496,"This is a different spin on the classic "" Cinderella"" story.  It takes place during the Renassiance in France.  The film in and of itself is well made.  The costumes are appropriate for that period of time.  The acting is very good.  The plot is excellent.  The way it is told is fantastic.
The "" Cinderella"" character, Danielle, starts out as the original story did.  The girl is a child who gains a step-mother, Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent and 2 step-sisters, Marguerite and Jacqueline, and is doted on by her father.  Shortly thereafter Danielle's father dies.
About 10 years later Danielle is a servant in what was her own house.  Danielle is loved and looked after by the other servants.  Prince Henry, the crown prince of France, wants nothing to do with the responsibility that being king will bring him.  Henry runs away, again.  He runs into Danielle, who nearly beats him up for stealing one of her horses.  Once she finds out who he is he pays her to keep quiet.  Danielle uses the money to buy back one of the servants that Rodmilla sold to pay her taxes.  Danielle pretends to be an aristrocrat to do this.  She also runs into Henry who doesn't recognize her.  Instead of the fawning that he is used to getting by the ladies at court what he gets from Danielle is something of a lecture.  He also has to chase her which is something new for him as well.  Danielle gives her mother's name, Nicole, as her own.  Then she leaves.
Henry and Danielle run into each other a few more times.  During all of this Danielle befriends Leonardo Da Vinci, the artist in residence at the French court.  Leonardo has some inkling that Danielle is not what she pretends to be, but he says nothing.  Meanwhile Marguerite, the prettiest and most spoiled of Rodmilla's daughters, is relentlessly pursuing Henry.  Both she and Rodmilla are convinced that because Marguerite is so pretty that she will marry Henry and be the next queen of France.  Jacqueline is the only one in Rodmilla's family who is remotely kind to Danielle and that is probably because Rodmilla treats Jacqueline as she were the bad seed of the family because Jacqueline is a tad overweight and is not nearly as pretty as Marguerite.
Danielle and Henry get to know one another.  He is entranced by her passion for life.  At one point Danielle even saves Henry's life.  Danielle discovers that while Henry may be an aristocrat he looks at being a prince as a burden.  He is also neither truly spoiled or arrogant.  Henry turns out to be rather kind and he rarely shows who he truly is to anyone.
Once Rodmilla finds out that Henry likes Danielle she tries to sabotage the relationship.  Danielle starts to stand up to Rodmilla and Marguerite.  Jacqueline admires her for that and even cares for Danielle's wounds that Rodmilla gives her.  On the night of a royal ball when Henry is supposed announce who he will marry Rodmilla locks Danielle up and her friend Gustav gets Leonardo who frees Danielle.  Leonardo doesn't care once he finds out who Danielle really.  Danielle shows up at the ball and Rodmilla sabotages the whole thing.  The next day Rodmilla sells Danielle to a man she hates.  Ultimately Danielle frees herself.  Henry realizes what a big mistake that he has made and that he doesn't care about Danielle's station, he cares about her.  In a scheme obviously devised beforehand both Rodmilla and Marguerite get their comeuppence.  Henry and Danielle end up together.  Jacqueline ends up with the captain of Henry's guard.
On the whole this is a great film.  While is not suitable for small children, slightly older ones, teenagers, and adults will probably enjoy it.",1366761600,,3642,4.688783570300158

1011221,5,6305265496,"This is by far the best rendition of the Cinderella story (Disney's version notwithstanding).  The writing is solid, the scenery gorgeous, and the cast spot on.  Anjelica Houston IS the evil step-mother.  No one else could have given such a gorgeous performance of the villainous bane of Cinderella's existence.  Speaking of the cinders girl, Drew Barrymore is stellar.  Not only does she maintain the decency and sweetness which is associated with the classical heroine, but she also gives a strength to Cinderella that we don't see anywhere else.  How many of us cheered when she punched Jacqueline over the bed for that mom comment?  Oh, yeah.

The story brings together all the elements of the fairytale we all grew up with, as well as a few interesting surprises, such as a prince running away from his royal duties, gypsies, and Leonardo Da Vinci.  This is truly one of the best films ever.",1365206400,2,896,4.842105263157895

There are so many great scenes in this movie that it's hard to pick my favorite.  I love the philosophical, challenging banter she has with the prince.  I love the romantic scenes in the library, the lake, and in the ruined cathedral.  I especially love the funny scene with the bandits.

There is something about the chemistry between Drew Barrymore, Dougray Scott, and Angelica Houston that makes this movie irresistible.  Dougray Scott is fantastic as the prince.  I've seen him cast as a villain, most notably Mission Impossible 2.  So I was a bit sceptic about seeing him as the prince.  Goodness was I wrong! He was handsome, charming, and brooding.  I dare say he made me wishing I was Danielle!  Drew Barrymore is one of my perennial favorites and she did not disappoint.

It's feminist without being annoying or preachy. It keeps you interested and you don't constantly find yourself thinking: 'Oh, I knew that was going to happen.' Sticking to the original story while still keeping it fresh is often difficult, but not so in this movie.

I would have to play them side by side to make an accurate assessment.  The picture was grainy and in some spots blurry.  The other odd thing was in scenes where Leonardo is wearing a white hat, there is a double halo/shadow effect going on.  When there is a scene with bright light (for example any outdoor scene) the entire shot is blown out. When it's dark, the black is grainy with no crispness whatsoever.

Drew was awesome and so very convincing as Cinderella (even with her fake but forgive-able English accent). Angelica Huston is probably the best wicked stepmother ever! I loved the chemistry between Cinderella and Prince Henry. The use of Leonardo Da Vinci in place of the famed fairy godmother truly elevates this timeless story up a notch, from a mere children's fairytale to a beautiful romance with which any romantic at heart can identify. My only criticism, though not enough to mark down my rating, is that I've always felt the dialogue at the end, between Cinderella and Prince Henry, seemed to be missing that little special something that was always present in all other scenes they had together. It wasn't their chemistry as this was still intact right to the end. I think the script was just a little lukewarm at this point.

1011746,5,6305265496,"The real and true story of Cinderella (and the Prince), the details of which were lost over time.  That is what this story purports to tell, narrated by a regent who is the great, great granddaughter of Cinderella!

This is a really, really GOOD, WONDERFUL movie!  Even though I'm seeing it almost 14 years now since it first came out, I'm so glad I happened to take a look at it and didn't miss it!

As story, it is an innovative, in-depth account of the classic fairy-tale/myth that has captured the minds and psyches of females down through the centuries.  This version of the story explores, however, new depths in the minds and characterological make-ups of Cinderella (Her name is Danielle) and the Prince of France who doesn't want to become King (His name is Henry).

Because this story of the young couple's alternating topsy-turvey and turvey-topsey acquaintanceship before marriage involves character growth in the Prince, who gains new human values that replace his previously self-centered, selfish ways, the story is very wholesome and worthwhile.  Although it is still an absorbing Romance, it provides an experience that greatly supercedes the story as mere Romance.  Through the strong and instructive character of the servant Cinderella/Danielle, values such as human kindness and human equality are emphatically expressed and fiercely lived out.  Her dearest friends are servants and she fights to save them from cruel fates.

Danielle is also an exponent of learning, a value which was inculcated by her father's practice of reading to her every night as a child.  The last book her father read to her was ""Utopia,"" or, a book about ""Paradise,"" and she has greatly treasured this book ever since.  The Paradisical thread in the plot has implications in the fact that we find Henry changing into a new kind of potential King, eager to take on his opportunity through Kingship to do great things for humanity through the inspired management of his Kingdom.

Another new twist to the old Cinderella plot is that although there are numerous kindly peasant servants, there is no distinct fairy godmother who manifests in order to transform Cinderella for the Ball.  The nearest thing to the godmother in this story, because he adds an outstanding feature to ""Cinderella's"" gown, is Leonardo da Vinci.  This amazing story is set up so that  da Vinci, a friend of the Prince, plays a major supporting role!

Another welcome change to the old story is that one of the ""wicked step-sisters"" is not so ""wicked.""  There is a lot of very nice humor in this script and one of the funniest scenes for me occurred when this ""good"" step-sister was forced by her hard mother to come to the masked Ball wearing a horse head-piece.  However, the girl encounters there a fellow, presumably her future soul mate, who seems to really like horses.

This movie was made in 1998 and yet there was no portrayal of sex or language use that would be considered objectionable by anyone.  What a pleasant relief!  I was so surprised by this!  I could hardly believe it!

I deem this movie a RARE TREASURE.  It's full of beauty; fun; and good, humane, LOVING-AND-LEARNING PRINCIPLES!  In my opinion, both women and men of all ages would enjoy the movie if they had a taste for this sort of thing:  An innocent, fun romance but with depth.

I found the closing statement of the Queen/narrator inaudible toward the end, so I listened to it several times and finally got it all.  She says that the couple did ""live happily ever after, but, the point IS that they Lived.""  This refers back to the introduction of the movie in which the Queen states that Cinderella and the Prince were real people who actually were a part of history, but it is a rather ambiguous remark, maybe meant as something to ponder.  I really LOVE this movie, which makes me laugh and smile.

The story seems a bit silly at first but it ""takes off"" pretty soon.  The scenery is beautiful, set in the Perigorde region of France.  I think those castles we see in the film are real.",1315699200,2,4038,4.770893371757925

1011748,5,6305265496,"Drew Barrymore and spunky go together pretty well. Conversely, Drew Barrymore and spot-on British accents do not. Still, she is captivating in EVER AFTER, a fresh reinventing of the Cinderella fairy tale. Off the top of my head, when thinking of kid actresses who were able to successfully transition into having grown-up Hollywood careers, Barrymore springs to mind, along with Liz Taylor, Natalie Wood, and Jodie Foster. Barrymore just has a knack for making you invest in her characters.

EVER AFTER benefits from the class and charisma of Jeanne Moreau. The movie opens with her welcoming the Brothers Grimm and offering to regale them with the true story of the fabled little cinder girl who, it turns out, had been a living, breathing person. The story shifts to 16th century France.

EVER AFTER frames the Cinderella fairy tale in familiar enough trappings, but it's the delightful swerves which had me big grinning. Barrymore plays Danielle, 16th century's Miss Fiercely Independent. Once the beloved daughter of wealth and privelege, the father-less Danielle is forced into household servitude by her cruel step-mother. But, despite grueling hard work and a scaling down of status, Danielle grows up a bright and irrepressible girl, something which can't be said for her insufferable step-sisters.

There's a glass slipper. There's a fancy ball. There's even a fairy godmother of sorts. There's a handsome prince, naturally. Specifically, Henry (Dougray Scott), the crown prince of France, chafing under the doom of an arranged marriage. When he flees in panic, he ends up in Danielle's backyard and comes under fire from Danielle's well-trajectoried apples (she thinks he's a thief). Prince Henry meets Danielle again soon after, except that, in the second encounter, Danielle is masquerading as nobility so as to effect a rescue of a family servant. Henry, believing her to be a comtesse, is baffled but smitten hard. ""Baffled and smitten hard"" sort of becomes Henry's default emotional setting. What do you expect when you spring a plucky and enlightened girl on a 16th century gent? It's probably an eyebrow raiser when a girl back in that day drops Thomas More quotes on a bloke.

Barrymore carries the film, although the supporting cast does a good job of spotting her. She imbues Danielle with immense likability and a strong sense of self. This is a heroine who doesn't require a prince or shiny knight to come to her rescue. She does her own rescuing, thanks very much. In fact, in a marvelous scene set in the woods featuring gypsy bandits and tree-climbing (guess who climbs the tree?), Danielle ends up rescuing the prince.

I like that most of the characters aren't reduced to caricatures. Barrymore's Danielle makes for a wonderfully appealing and high-spirited Cinderella. Anjelica Huston and Melanie Lynskey add dimensions to their roles of, respectively, the icy and calculating step-mother and the one rather sympathetic step-sister. You get the sense that the step-mother may have genuinely cared for Danielle's father and that he may have proved to be her saving grace should he had lived. But you can't gainsay how vile the step-mother is towards her step-daughter. When a despairing Danielle asks her step-mother if she'd ever loved her, the cool, cutting response is: ""How can anyone love pebble in their shoe?"" It's gratifying what ultimately happens to Huston's character and to the other step-sister (the really vile one).

But what makes EVER AFTER extra awesome is that Leonardo da Vinci subs in as the fairy godmother. He serves as matchmaker and a kindred spirit of Danielle's and, when needed, as a timely opener of doors. In a movie replete with fairy tale tropes and an ideally realized France dotted with fabulous castles and chateaus and inhabited by good-natured forest bandits, Leonardo da Vinci may have been the most magical element.",1306713600,3,3881,5.123222748815166

1011750,3,6305265496,"I enjoyed this movie, I really did, but it would have been better if I wasn't trying to figure out how Danielle could be considered a commoner when she's the daughter of a countess. We don't know for sure what rank her father was but it was evidently good enough for him to marry a very snooty and ambitious baroness, so he was almost certainly a nobleman. And if his first wife, Danielle's mother, was a countess he's likely to have been a count. Unless she was illegitimate, which was never suggested, Danielle would have been a noblewoman by birth and of equal rank to her stepsisters. Even if the mother wasn't really a countess, Danielle would certainly have been a gentlewoman, not a commoner. My feeling is that the Angelica Huston character's treatment of her would have been considered quite scandalous by the nobility. She and her fellow servants would most certainly have been aware of all this. Then add in the fact that the word 'courtier', which is used to describe Danielle, was used only for men - women were courtesans. (Granted, the female version has another meaning that wouldn't be appropriate for this movie.)

I guess all that is nitpicking, but it really bugged me and took quite a bit of entertainment value out of what's otherwise a very charming movie.",1303344000,3,1279,4.709821428571429

She is a strong woman who speaks her mind and stands up for those in need---and the prince doesn't rescue her; she rescues herself. Scott and Barrymore have great chemistry, Huston makes an excellent villain, and there are plenty of comical moments to lighten the heaviness of the drama.

There are some historical inaccuracies as pointed out in other reviews, but I didn't mind because the storyline is so clever.

The dialogue delights--it's witty, reveals character, and conveys the period well.  Ditto on the characters--all the actors fit their roles so well that I can't imagine anyone else besides Drew Barrymore playing Danielle or Angelica Huston playing the stepmother.  These characters possess a surprising amount of depth for the simple archetypes they are in the fairy tale, which I attribute to great script-writing and talented acting.

So why 4 stars?  Another reviewer mentioned that she had a problem with Dougary Scott but she couldn't quite put her finger on it.  I had a similar issue, not with Dougary Scott himself and his portrayal of the prince, which I thought remarkably well-done--on the cusp of boyhood and manhood, he is at times spoilt, thoughtful, adventurous, duty-bound, funny, intellectually curious, or sometimes all of these at once, which made for a very interesting character.  However, the storyline did not allow him to grow as Danielle grows, and that bothered me, since they're destined to be a great romantic couple.  I appreciated Danielle's strength of character, but I wanted the prince to show the same strength of character to be worthy of her, and that didn't quite happen.  The seeds are in the storyline--he overcomes his father's wishes and his own problems with love versus duty--but these seeds never quite come to fruition for me.

Otherwise, great film--I've seen it more times than I can say, and it delights every time.",1271376000,4,1999,5.116923076923077

1011920,4,6305265496,"Cinderella stands squarely among the most re-told stories. Dozens of variations exist, but nearly all stay close to the basics: poor but hardworking girl, cruel step-family, and a magical boost into the prince's affections. This time, however, we skip the magic and see a lot of hard work on Cinderella's part, plus a little righteous collusion by the housekeepers still loyal to her and her late father. I like that - instead of magic, we see intelligence and determination; instead of a magical fairy godmother, we're treated to larcenous devotion by the staff that she has treated honorably. The conclusion means that much more when it comes from personal strength (and a strong throwing arm) rather than an effortless wave of a wand.

Huston does her usual spectacular job as wicked stepmother, and Megan Dodds does beautifully as the stepsister you love to hate. Barrymore really makes this movie, though, with just the right&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-s-Angel/dp/B000056PMV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie's Angel</a>&nbsp;edge to the dutiful daughter.

1011928,5,6305265496,"I don't know how this one ever got past my radar, but I'm glad I finally discovered it. It was quite by accident. My mom and I were sitting watching one of her ladies' channels (Oxygen or CO2 or some such silliness), and I remarked how much the story was like Cinderella. (We had missed the beginning, when the narrator, a female descendant of Cinderella's, explained to the Brothers Grimm that this was the real story behind their fairy tale.) Well, it was delightful. It had humor, adventure, romance, villainy, gorgeous sets and costumes, a top-notch cast - pretty much everything. If it hadn't been for Shakespeare In Love and Saving Private Ryan dominating the Oscars in 1999, Ever After probably would have taken some of the statuettes for cinematography, art direction, sets and costumes.

Nevertheless, it's two stars, Drew Barrymore and Anjelica Huston, did win awards for their acting (not at the Oscars, but at other award ceremonies), which were well deserved because both women are terrific. Ms. Barrymore is the perfect Cinderella (Disney's 1950 animated version notwithstanding), although in this tale she is known as Danielle. And Ms. Huston (The Royal Tenenbaums, Mists Of Avalon) is perfectly mean, in a delectable sort of way, as the step mother. As with the Brothers Grimm version, there is no fairy godmother in the story; but there is Leonardo da Vinci, who, in my opinion, serves a much better purpose: he provides magic without it being unbelievable, and it is Patrick Godfrey (The Count Of Monte Cristo) who does the honors. I mean, pumpkins turning into coaches and mice becoming footmen? What was Charles Perrault, the 18th Century inventor of those fantastic elements, thinking?!

Prince Henry, who is smitten by and then pursues Cinderella, is played by newcomer Dougray Scott. (He later starred in Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde and The Ten Commandments.) Scott does an admirable job balancing swashbuckling tendencies with boredom. It is his boredom that Cinderella challenges. She can't believe how complacent he is, considering how much responsibility he will have as the future king of France; and he can't get over how passionate, committed and alive she is. Writers Susannah Grant, Andy Tennant and Rich Parks have done something at which most modern screenwriters fail miserably: they've given us a compelling story about characters that are full of wit and charm, whom we honestly care about, and whose fortunes are in the balance until the very end.

Like most classic fairy tales, Cinderella contains a timeless lesson that we never tire of hearing: that virtue wins over circumstances. Even though Cinderella is persecuted by her step mother and one of her step sisters, she overcomes this through perseverance, her concern for other people and her love of life and living. I like this version of the tale far better than Perrault's, which uses magic to rescue Cinderella, and is therefore difficult to relate to real life; and that of the Brothers Grimm, which contains some very grim elements indeed (like the step sisters cutting off parts of their feet in order to fit them into the glass slipper, and birds pecking out their eyes), making it equally unbelievable.

Cinderella has been made into countless stage and screen productions, including the 1957 Rogers and Hammerstein TV musical starring Julie Andrews; the 1965 TV musical starring Lesley Ann Warren; and Stephen Sondheim's 1987 stage musical, Into The Woods, starring Bernadette Peters (based on the Grimm version and encompassing other fairy tales as well) - not to mention all the operas and ballets. But this latest version is, in my opinion, one of the best.

The director of Ever After, Andy Tennant, has done a remarkable job weaving all the fascinating elements of both story and production together. Even more remarkable is the fact that most of his work has been for television, and this does have a certain made-for-television feel to it. But not only is it far, far better than most made-for-television movies, it out-shines most theatrical films. As a comparison, I think most viewers will find it to be at least one star better than Princess Bride, a film that is similar only in its storybook nature. I actually found myself reminded of First Knight more than any other film; although, again, this one is far better. For a good story that will capture your imagination and heart, and which the whole family can enjoy, Ever After is a charmer.

 I would love to know where this movie was filmed, they chose a very pretty place to make the movie, and also know, the history of the house Cinderella lived in with her step family, and I would just love to know the history of the castle, and the surrounding area!

In one of my favorite scenes, the Prince rushes off to rescue Danielle from great peril, only to meet her coming back, having capably dealt with the situation herself.  There is no sorcery in this version; Leonardo da Vinci fills the role of the Fairy Godmother.

Danielle's independence does not mean that there is nothing at stake in this film.  There is a strong love story and while I did not fear for her safety, I did for her happiness.

There are many aspects of the film that are well-done, but the major problem with it is the lead actress, Drew Barrymore.  It's not that she can't act or doesn't look the part; it's her private life, the lurid details of which are now public knowledge (e.g., in rehab by age 13!).

That being the case, it's virtually impossible to take her seriously as an innocent princess.  In fact, it's hard to sit through this movie and think of anything other than the irony -- even preposterousness -- of what you're watching.  Perhaps, the filmmakers reasoned, the silliness of this will be lost on the moppet audience to which the movie is geared.

The chief merit of the film, I submit, is Anjelica Houston's chilling and utterly convincing performance as the evil step-mother.  The problem there, however, is that it's so well-done that the movie seems to depress you more than it uplifts you, which it does try to do at the end, when everything of course turns out all right.

Cinderella, in this version, rescued the prince and herself, certainly a departure from the origninal story. The prince was uncertain if he wanted to marry Cinderella because of her class.  The gypsy-robbers were portrayed as being honorable while the prince apologized for his lack of honor.
The scenery was pretty at times, but overall it looked low-budget, especially the scenes from the ball.
The characters were miscast and boring except for Angelica Huston who played the role of the stepmother well. I don't know how this movie got 5 stars as it has virtually no redeeming features.",1211760000,10,820,5.111940298507463
1012038,5,6305265496,"A young french girl's father dies after being newly wed, and leaves his daughter to be raised by the hard women with her two spoiled daughters.  Sound familiar?  It is; it is Cinderella.  In this version, the main character is a loud mouthed tomboy who has a kind, generous, and loving heart.  Fate would have it that she meets the crown prince of France while saving one of her servants from being sent away to America, and the seeds of love or at least curiosity are sown.

  ""Everafter"" is one of those rare movies that actually transcends to material that is based off of.  Cinderella, at its heart, like many of the Grimms Fairytales, is not a love story, but a morality tale.  That is what folk tales are, morality in story form.  With this in mind, ""Everafter"" does not go for the morality tale, but the love story with morality undertones.

  What makes ""Everafter"" unique is that is has a great cast and message behind it.  The story, of course, is completely predictable, but the script is dramatic but peppered with a great sense of humor!  The principle message of the movie is that in for a relationship to work, you must be honest, and hiding things only makes the situation worse.  It also highlights that true love is not perfect, and that in love, we must learn to forgive many times.  One of my favorite scenes is the one after the ball between Prince Henry and Divinci.  This shows how the movie treads the line between love at first sight and making the choice to love.

  Is this a realistic movie?  Absolutely not.  Would you watch a movie about Cinderella and expect realism?  I would hope not.

  The only thing I would change is the DVD.  There are no extras except a trailer, which is not an extra.  So, where is the special anniversary edition with cast interviews/documentaries on the film and director/cast commentaries???  That is what all of us want!

1012042,5,6305265496,"I just adore this movie. EVER AFTER with Drew Barrymore is one of the most romantic films I've ever seen. Drew shines and endears as Danielle De Barbarac aka Cinderella.  Dougray Scott is Prince Henry and he fits this role perfectly. The rest of the supporting cast (Anjelica Huston, et al) compliment the leads in fine ways.

This is what I would expect a modern (sort of) take on our beloved fairy tale to be. It's not trying to be the Disney version, nor is it trying to be the fairy tale. EVER AFTER holds it's own.  The characters and the story are developed in ways that fit their apparent personalities and not just the plot.  For example, it's clear from the beginning that the Baroness (stepmother Anjelica) has no use for Danielle, and her treatment of her up til the very end is nothing but contempt.  Stepsis Marguerite is a spoiled brat who will do whatever to get what she wants.  Danielle is a free spirit (I usually hate describing someone that way) who is full of dreams but makes room for others in those dreams.  Henry is a caged bird trying to break out of the mold expected of him in order to forge his own way in life.  Each of the characters provides depth to the story, including the gypsies (very funny scenes).  EVER AFTER fleshes out the story of Cinderella by giving Henry and Danielle a chance to get to know each other.

At the risk of sounding super cheesy, I must say that I can watch this movie over and over and feel like I'm watching it for the first time. The direction is perfect, the visuals are great, and the acting choices are superb.

Drew Barrymore is wonderful, Riff Raff from Rocky Horror Picture Show is perfect, as really is the whole cast. I believe people of every age will enjoy this movie.  Certain things will go over little kids heads, but the adults will enjoy them.",1199750400,,515,4.1

It is well cast and there are some clever intersections with some real history (namely Leonardo Da Vinci and some of his real work). Though there is no fairy-god mother, there is magic just the same! I enjoyed it from beginning to end; in other words it was never boring, even starting out already knowing that the end would be a happily ever after!

I decided that it was about time to wipe off the dust and pop in the movie and I am so glad that I did for I had forgotten how much I truly adore this movie.  I mean, I remember that I was impressed when I saw it initially not knowing what to expect really but I think that over time my taste now allows me to completely fall in love with this movie.  Taking the classic story of Cinderella and making it realistic was an endeavor in itself but Andy Tennant and his cast truly deliver brilliantly here.

So, in this fresh undertaking we are introduced to Danielle De Barbarac, a young woman who finds herself in a dire situation.  Young Danielle's father has suddenly died and she is now at the mercy of the most merciless of women, her stepmother The Baroness Rodmilla De Ghent and her ghoulish daughter Marguerite (The Baroness' other daughter Jacqueline is actually a kindhearted soul).  The Baroness has turned her father's house into a house of fear and treachery and she is constantly butting heads with Danielle.  Their feud seems to reach its peek about the time that rebellious Prince Henry begins his search for a bride.  A misunderstanding causes the Prince to fall head over heals in love with Danielle and as they secretly court her `big secret' is in danger of being revealed.

The direction is wonderful here, the cinematography is beautiful and the whole mood expressed in the film is just warm and delightful.  The actors all do a wonderful job in their respective roles, Drew Barrymore deliver such a well rounded and heart warming performance that I'm astounded at her Oscar snub (especially in a year where Gwyneth Paltrow was embraced for doing the same thing).  Anjelica Huston is the epitome of evil as The Baroness, you can tell she is just eating this up.  Patrick Godfrey is hilarious as Leonardo da Vinci and Megan Dodds and Melanie Lynskey both are astounding as the two polar opposite stepsisters.  Dougray Scott was having such an awesome year (or few years) so it's odd that his career as fizzled as opposed to sizzled.  He is charming and believable as the arrogant rebel Prince who finds his way through the love of a woman.

The film is just an utter delight from start to finish and is sure to please just about everyone.  A wonderful film the whole family can enjoy again and again.  I've always been smitten with Drew Barrymore, but I think I can honestly say that she has never moved me more nor has ever been so close to my heart as she is as Cinderella.",1196208000,,2616,4.520169851380042

1012170,5,6305265496,"Looking at the hundreds of glowing 5 star reviews here, I am glad to see there are very many fans of this smart retelling of Cinderella. I fell in love with this movie since it first came out years ago and I still watch it over and over to this day.

Okay, so it's not BBC masterpiece theatre and the accents are iffy. However all the actors are wonderfully cast - Angelica Huston is superbly conniving and manipulative as the stepmother but Dougray Scott and Judy Parfitt standout as the prince and queen mother respectively. The dialogue and storyline is both funny AND smart.

Drew Barrymore is quite the revelation in this film. Yes, her character Danielle is kind, intelligent and strong but it's the scenes where she's vulnerable that stands out in my mind.  In the scene where she brushes her stepmother's hair, watch Drew's big luminous eyes shine with hopeful longing for a mother's approval and love. And later in the film when the Baroness coldly rejects her as a ""pebble in a shoe"", the stricken expression on Drew's face just breaks your heart.

Ok, now to my complaint about this dvd. Where are the extras?! Where are the deleted scenes, ""making of"" shorts and interviews? I hope the producers see the all glowing reviews here and reissue this with all the extras!",1191283200,4,1278,4.666666666666667

And, the only special features it has is the movie trailer. So, anyone who's looking for cast/director commentaries, deleted scenes and other behind-the-scenes features, you'll not get it on this DVD.

1012379,5,6305265496,"Ah, what can be said about this film?  A LOT....

It is, first and foremost, a retelling of the classic tale of Cinderella, but infused with historical fiction and factual characters.

You've read the plot points above, and I don't need to go over them again...  The movie, however, is spectacular...!  The acting is just about top notch, with excellent performances by Drew Barrymore (as Danielle, aka Cindersoot/Cinderella) and Dougray Scott (as the crown prince of France, Henry).  Exceptional is the word to describe Anjelica Houston's performance as Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent, the ""evil"" step-mother.

Great performances are turned in by nearly all the supporting characters, including an interesting twist on the ""evil"" step-sisters, Maguerite and Jacqueline...  But in this retelling - only one of the sisters is truly mean and spiteful - a vengeful witch of a girl...  Jacqueline, however, being somewhat plainer than her blond bombshell of a sister, is far more accepting of Danielle and others as the story unfolds.

Also a surprise is Richard O'Brian (of Rocky Horror and Shock Treatment fame) as an evil and covetous local baron/lord who sets his sites on Danielle and won't take NO for an answer - until he's threatened with becoming skewered by Danielle...

A truly humorous scene is the wedding of Prince Henry is just about to wed a wailing and thoroughly unhappy princess of Spain - who sobs and cries and wails throughout the ceremony - also lamenting that she cannot marry the one she loves, and is, instead, forced into a royal arrangement between her parents and Henry's parents.

The film is also peppered with great lines of dialog that are delivered with precision and the proper tone, right down to Baroness Rodmilla demurely asking how long she may have to live, after her treachories are discovered.

With inputs from Leonardo da Vinci, the King & Queen of France (Francis and his wife), and a band of Gypsies, not to mention the household staff of Danielle's familial home, we get the ""Happily ever after"" ending we all love and care about...",1168300800,,2071,4.9681159420289855

1012449,5,6305265496,"Cinderella is the most popular fairy tale of all time.  There are several versions of the story that we might have all read at different points as children.  This had ""chick flick"" written all over it, but I was pleased with the results as they fleshed out this tale as best as they could.

Drew Barrymore, the world's most successful comeback child star, plays Danielle, a young peasant girl in France.  Like the fairy tale, her father remarries, gains a family of a step mother and two step sisters, then suddenly dies.  Danielle is left with her new family but finds the true nature of her step mother to be cold and cruel (played wonderfully by Angelica Houston).  Her bitter jealousy of Danielle's good qualities and contempt is obvious.  What the fairy tale versions did not always hint at (with the possible exception of the Disney animated movie) was that the step mother is plotting for her own daughter to be in favor with the royal court and marry the prince.  It makes for many hilarious situations with Danielle and her step mother and sister (see that scene when she knocks her over and her feet go flying over her head).  Her younger step sister, while the weaker and clearly not the favorite of the two, makes for Danielle's unlikely ally.

While Danielle tries to keep the peace and home and make the best of her situation, the prince of France one day comes right to her door.  Prince Henry is suffering from a combination of cold feet and growing pains, and when a willful Danielle comes into the picture he is taken aback.  While at first there is animosity between them, but the love will naturally grow.  They incorporate some more modern themes in this story that your average so-and-so in those times might not have been thinking of (education, free thinking, justice system, etc.) because a vast majority were illiterate.  Plus, Danielle is strong enough that she doesn't need the prince to come rescue her from the evil neighbor who bought her.  She slays the dragon herself and has a humbled prince come before her asking her to take him back.  And her fairy godmother is none other than Leonardo DiVinci himself.

This is a wonderful take on the most beloved of all fairy tales and leaves wonders to the imagination.",1142380800,3,2244,4.669211195928753
1012450,5,6305265496,"I just had to right a review about my favorite movie. When people want to see a Cinderella movie they should watch this one and not the cheap imitations that get released every year. I have watched this movie over 50 times and am not ashamed to say that I have memorized the script. Every time I see it I can't help but shed a tear or more. I know this sounds extreme, but the screen play and actors are marvelous. You understand why the Baroness Rodmilla De Ghent (Anjelica Huston) hates Danielle De Barbarac (Drew Barrymore), and any woman can't help but fall in love with Prince Henry (Dougray Scott). I won't say more you have to see it to believe how wonderful it is.",1140912000,4,672,4.341269841269841
1012451,4,6305265496,"For every female who dreamed over the story Cinderella as a girl, this one is for you. Danielle De Barbarac (Drew Barrymore) is our heroine. She is a child of eight years when her father tragically dies, leaving her with her stepmother the Baroness, (Anjelica Huston) and two stepsisters, Marguerite and Jacqueline. Danielle becomes a servant, although unlike in most of these tales, she has other servants to help her, and has a close bond with them. Danielle craves her stepmother's love, but is no lilly-hearted maiden. This gal is more like a rose. Soft and beautiful, but watch out boys, she knows how to use those thorns. After her father dies, it's ten years before a new man enters her life. The prince, of course.

Another difference in the story is one of the stepsisters, Jacqueline. Instead of being part of the problem, she offers kindness and basic courtesy to Danielle, and although she's not in any real position to help her step-sister, you can tell it helps. It's a refreshing change, and one get's the feeling that they'll grow to be great friends.

Long story short, in the midst of Danielle's daily life, she meets and falls in love with the prince, Henry, and he returns the sentiment, but one little hitch. He thinks she's a woman of nobility, and she falls further and further into the hole of deception as the relationship evolves.(Dougray Scott is our hero.) This lie later causes problems, and makes a temporary mess of everything.

If you want to know more, see the movie. Everyone delievers a worthy performance but Drew Berrymore and Ms. Huston really knock it out of the ballpark. The Baroness is no one-domensial character. She's cruel occassionally, cold often, but there is one scene where Danielle is brushing her hair where you catch a glimpse of vulneribility from Danielle's stepmother, and how circumstances might have shaped her into what she has become. Danielle's character is just extradionary. She is fiery and passionate, but idealistic and kind at the same time. She's all you could ever want in a heroine. Also, she doesn't try to be the most beautiful woman. Her bratty stepsister is more physically beautiful, but is hallow inside, and it shows.

As for the romance between Danielle and the prince, the chemisty wasn't the best in the world, but the actors do the best they can, and in the end, satisfy. The script is a little modern at times, but not enough to be actually annoying. There isn't enough to actually complain about, and I reccomend this for anybody. Guys might not be crazy about the story, but will probably be happy to gawk at Drew Berrymore, and might enjoy the swordfight. The scenery is just georgeous, so that might help as well.",1138838400,2,2699,4.785407725321888

1012453,5,6305265496,"Andy Tennant's retelling of the classic Cinderella story by the Brothers Grimm (no pun intended on the movie of the same name) is a classic period film. Drew Barrymore (""E.T."") is still impressive and beautiful as Danielle, a young girl in 17th century France who inadvertently catches the attention of the crown prince (Dougray Scott) while slaving away for her evil stepmother (Academy Award winner Angelica Huston). An awesome score by George Fenton (who would reunite with Andy Tennant to score ""Anna And The King,"" a non-musical version of the classic Rodgers&Hammerstein musical ""The King And I,"" with Tennant again behind the director's chair). This is one of my all-time favorite period movies. I fell in love with Ms. Barrymore when I saw the promotional advertising for this movie; I was 8 years old at the time...and I fell in love all over again at 19.  Rated PG for some thematic elements and mild language.",1131926400,3,920,4.935483870967742
1012454,5,6305265496,"I have always loved Cinderella stories, but this is by far the best. Portrayed in the setting of 14th or 15th centurey France, Danielle De Barbarac is not the richest girl around, but has a wonderful father that loves her. Because of him, she has learned to read and is very insightful on the world around her.

  The story begins just after Danielle's father has remarried to a rich baroness with two daughters, Marguerite and Jacline. WHile riding to a buisness venture the next day, M. De Barbarac suffers from a stroke, leaving young Danielle alone with her jealous stepmother.

  As she grows older, Danielle meets the prince of France, Henry, as he is trying to run away from his royal duties. They meet again later that day, but while Danielle is dressed as a rich lady, trying to save a servent her stepmother has sold away.

The prince falls instantly in love and the story takes off from there.

  The thing I love best about this movie, is the setting in France and how it seems to tie in so well with the countries history (Though I am no expert). The story line stays very close to the original fairy tale, and doesn't seem to be a mere product of Hollywood's ridiculous tales of unbelieveable romances and ridiculous plots.

  I highly recommend this to all who are even slightly interested. Anyone can enjoy this masterpiece, even if you don't like fantasy!",1130716800,2,1372,4.619834710743802

The new adaptation of the fairy tale Cinderella is not as shocking as the Romeo and Juliet film with DiCaprio but this film with Barrymore was softer, kinder and much more romantic. Angelica Huston portrayed the wicked stepmother perfectly and the one sister, Margaret, was the best portrayal of a ratty stepsister, competely mean! I would recommend purchase of this film if you like romance/comedy movies. If you liked ""Never been Kissed"" then you will love this film. I would place it in the same category as ""The Princess Bride, Never Been Kissed and The truth about Cats and Dogs"" the whole rags-to-riches-finding-prince-charming thing!",1129334400,2,817,5.014705882352941

I particularly like the beginning, when the brothers Grimm visit the Queen of France, who then tells them the story of her greatgreat-grandmother, and isn't Jeanne Moreau phantastic in her role as queen?!

What shocked me was that many of the people sending reviews not only named her Gabrielle instead of Danielle, showing they paid little attention do detail, but one even said this was a medieval story happening in Old England! The story, however, is a Renaissance story (when Leonardo da Vinci lived, and lived in Amboise after being invited by the Kind) and the castle you can see in the movie is the castle in Amboise, where King Francis and later King Henri lived in often, if not in Blois, they always talk of Amboise even several times, and the river is the Loire, and a wonderful area it is, suited well for the movie. I love all Cinderella stories because most are just as well for grown-ups, and have much wisdom, this one is even better than the famous Czech movie I think. I can't praise it enough, and I will keep it for rainy days to brighten them.",1128729600,3,1258,4.469565217391304
1012457,4,6305265496,"There are over 500 versions of Cinderella in existence in the world today, but this is perhaps the most enjoyable. The director made this version for a specific purpose - to teach his two daughters that they shouldn't be waiting for a prince and a big house to make them happy. The lesson is taught with sincerity and humor within a great story.

Danielle De Barbarac grows up with her stepmother and two stepsisters - one evil, one not so evil - after her beloved father passes away. The first time she meets the prince is when she throws apples at him for stealing a horse, and the second when she goes to rescue a household servant dressed as a courtier. The prince pays her no attention the first time, but is instantly taken the second as she is intelligent and witty ""...for anyone who can quote Thomas Moore is worth it."" And so continues the courtship, with Danielle in disguise, until Henry finds out the truth at the mask ball.

Of course, the story ends happily, but I really liked the way it began...a woman telling two men of her great great grandmother's courage and wit, thus telling us, it's not a fairy tale, but only reduced to one after so many versions have been told over time ""...the point, gentlemen, is not that they lived happily ever after, but that they lived.""

The movie is well acted, especially by Dougray Scott (Henry) and Angelica Huston (stepmother). Da Vinci's and the King and Queen's humor are not to be missed, they have some great lines, especially when it comes to Henry's arranged marriage. The supporting cast is also great. I gave it four stars, however, because I didn't think much of Drew Barrymore's performance in the film, to me she was not as strong as her co-stars. Her accent faltered a lot, and she was unable to keep it consistent throughout the movie. Unlike some other actresses, Drew does not fit into a period piece, and she wouldn't have been my first choice for a fiesty Cinderella. Also, the script was well written in some parts, not not in others. I don't think people used phrases such as ""money to burn"" and ""you've got bigger problems"" in 16th century France.

But overall, those minor inconsistenices are outshined by the story, characters and their wit and humor. This is a great film for all ages, and I would definitely recommend it.",1127865600,3,2302,4.593673965936739

I try to tell her it's the same story told in a different way.. yet she protest.. in wishful thinking that Gaberilla is real.

I think that the Book the character's father brings her to read moves her to be who she is, which is a gripping person who you'd like to know. Dougray is so enchanting that you'll want to find other movies he is in.. which I think this one is his best! I only own two of his movies. I don't know how many he actually made. I love both Drew Barrymore and Dougray Scott in this movie!

The character of the Fairy God Mother is a great surprise.. and an artist who sees the beauty in Cinderella and portays it not only in what he has to say to the prince about her.. but what he paints. I would recommend this story to anyone of any age. It has a few gems in it that you will want to look into once you see the movie.

One question: why wasn't Ms. Barrymore nominated for the Academy Award as best actress in that year??

That aside, the other actors and actresses did a great job, particularly Anjelica Houston, who plays a particularly villanous stepmother. The music is also very good (hint, hint).",1121212800,,634,5.038095238095238

Drew Barrymore, in a not particularly attractive mode, plays Cinderella as a regular gal-next-door in medieval England.  Well, MAYBE.  Actually, it's set in France, but they all wander around with terrible fake Brit accents.  There's no explanation for this.  There is also:  No wit, no sparkle, no songs. AND the story has been messed with.  Not only is there no magic, but her fairy godmother is....  Leonardo Da Vinci??? (And even HE is not interesting -- how sad is THAT??)  There is some attempt at portraying Cinderella as a feminist.  The ""portrayal"" is an embarrassment to feminists everywhere, just as Barrymore is an embarrassment to actors.  Drew's acting is rote - she appears to be reciting for a high-school audition. Okay, frankly, her acting is awful, awful, awful.  For the life of me, I don't know why this did so well in the theaters.  Must have been the teen-aged girls.  It is watchable, but with a lot of eye-rolling.

The story is played out as if the legend of Cinderella were true, complete with the brothers Grimm meeting with an elderly French woman in the beginning, who claims to be decended from Cinderella herself.  It is exceeding well done, in fact, some of the English teachers at my school use it as an example and show it in class.  The cast are well-suited to their roles, Drew pulls it off with a great performance.

This is definately a movie to see if you're a romantic or a sentimentalist.  It's a sweet love story, about actually loving the person you are with, and about how being a good person helps out a lot in life... especially when you have to deal with a wicked stepmother!",1106092800,9,1034,4.4

Drew Barrymore does an excellent job as the repressed and trod upon Daniella also known as 'Cinder Girl' or Cinderella by her stepsister. What I loved about this movie was that Cinderella did not have to be saved by the prince, rather she saved herself. She is a gutsy, tough, clever and intelligent character who is still a sensitive girl because of her experiences in life.

Dougray Scott as the Prince performs his role of childish spoilt rich brat who grows in his love(for Danielle as well as in maturity) with aplomb. Parts of the movie where he spouts romance with utter sincerity such as when he tells Danielle upon her enquiry that did she not already know his weakness for wasn't it obvious? That should have sounded soppy(for a hardened jaded cynic like me) but it didnt!

Anjelica H(o)uston as the stepmother is just too good. I can go on and on about this movie but I will conclude by saying that this movie is a perfect mix of romance, drama, action, comedy(Danielle rescuing the Prince from the gypsies) and history(Leonardo Da Vinci!! as well as the fact that many think that the idea of the glass slipper was a misinterpretation where while in translation from French to English the original material fur was mistaken for glass) and just because it is different in so many ways(the second sister sympathizing with Danielle).

Watch it when you are feeling down, just like that, when you have the girls over, when you have people over and to give young girls everywhere who love Cinderella a more truthful version of the story as opposed to the rather pathetic wimp that exists in the more popular Disney version of the fairy tale.",1104710400,6,1760,4.652733118971061

She even manages to rescue Prince Henry from a band of Gypsies who plan to keep him hostage.  Her unlikely 'fairy godfather' is non other than DaVinci himself.  And the ending for her wicked Stepmonster and Sib couldn't be more appropriate.

Instead, this girl uses her smarts and courage to win the heart of the prince.  I was not a Drew Barrymore fan until I watched this film, and although she had received criticism for the accent used in the film, soon you forget and accept the accent as part of Daniella.

Needless to say, she is not in my top-5 favorite actress list. However, my thoughts were changed forever when I was bored one day and rented the DVD. This movie is even better than the original fairy tale told to us as impressionable kids. First off, its good that they went and told it as ""the actual events"" and not the same Grimm brothers load of crap that just disappoints cause you later learn there is no fairy godmother out there or magic pumpkins. Drew Barrymore's Cinderella is anything but a ditzy blonde who sings with mice and having vapid dreams of wishes coming true. THIS Cinderella actually has a mind... and uses it, too, even in the face of the prince, whose renowned charm is replaced with a rebelliousness and refusal of running a country. THIS Cinderella is way better... I especially like the fact that the role wasn't given to some unrealistically drop-dead gorgeous gal as Hollywood likes to do. Barrymore is beautiful in her own way, but not so much that it blinds us from her very well-rounded personality. The whole cast does a good job, the quarrels between Danielle and Henry are irrestible, but Barrymore's acting comes out on top here. My only beef is perhaps the narrator, Danielle's aging great-great-granddaughter, her voice is just so grating and painful to endure.

That's what this is, a sentimental movie.  I am not a fan of the overly sentimental, mushy love story movies that are termed ""chick flicks"".  Yet this is one of my faviorite movies.
  Watching this movie is like falling in love, not so much with the handsome prince that courts Danielle, whom he does not know to be a commoner, or even with Danielle herself, though she is an admirable enough character, and in my opinion very well portrayed by Drew Barrymore.  No, what really got me about this movie was the way it combined the hard facts of reality with the romance of a fairy tale, and all in an age that is a step back from today.
  The movie makes a point of showing the soot on Danielle's hands from the hard labor she endures, the calusses left there.  She does not wake up in the morning and look pretty.  But when she means to, she can borrow her stepmother's clothes and look lovely.  I'm glad they did not cast some overly glamorous actress for this film.  Drew Barrymore is pretty, but not nearly as glamourous as the actress that plays Marguerite, Danielle's wicked stepsister.  Yet there are moments in the film when something truly seems to be shining out of Barrymore's eyes that makes her the most beautiful woman in the room.  In particular, the ball scene at the climax of the movie.
  There's the appearance of Leonardo Da Vinci, which, while i'm not sure is entirely historically correct, adds another dimension of magic to the film.  He is the man who walks on water and builds kites, and, when the time comes, he serves the wonderful role as fairy-godfather to Danielle.  'A bird may love a fish, but where would they live?', Danielle says to him of her love for Prince Henry.  'Well, I shall have to make you wings' he replies.  And he does.
  The movie is filled with articulae, well voiced lines like that, in front of settings that really bring you there, and beautiful music played with such perfect timing that, if you haven't already been, will sweep you away.",1103500800,2,2164,4.506426735218509

Danielle De Barbarac (Drew Barrymore) lives alone with her father and their servants after the death of her mother, until one day her father brings home a new bride, the Baroness Rodmilla De Ghent (Anjelica Huston) and her two daughters, Marguerite and Jacqueline.  When Danielle's father dies, the Baroness turns Danielle into a servant to wait on her and her spoiled daughters.

Danielle accidently meets young Prince Henry (Dougray Scott) when the Prince pilfers a horse from their manor in order to escape his parents restrictions.  For her silence, he gives her coins, which she uses to pose as a courtier to buy back their old servant the Baroness sold to pay her taxes.

She meets Prince Henry again, but this time posed as a Lady, and Henry finds himself enchanted not simply by her beauty but by her intelligence and spirit.  He becomes determined to know more about her, but first must find her for she keeps slipping away from him.  In the meantime, Marguerite has set her sights on the handsome prince, with the help of her mother and a michevious courtier.

I won't give away any more of the movie, but absolutely must mention that there is a great deal of humor in this unique telling of the Cinderella story (take special note of the wedding chapel scene with the Spanish Princess).  The acting is supurb and the script very tight and well written, the costumes are stunning, the scenery is breathtaking, and the photography brilliant.

Overall, this is a wonderful movie that softened even my cold, hard heart, allowing it to pump warm blood if only for the length of the movie.  This is a love story without sappiness, a handsome hero with faults of his own, and a beautiful heroine who knows how to save herself.  Enjoy!",1102291200,213,1961,4.6686046511627906

Yet, amazingly, very little of this goes unforgiven if not totally unnoticed because the movie bears an infectious charm in its rhythm.

The script is thoughtful enough to maintain a distance from mickey-mouse concepts of pumpkins and fairies. The dialogue has enough grace to keep anglophiles glued, there's even a wanton skein of humour that makes it all more pleasant than your average garden-variety Cinderella narrative. The roundabout love story is beautifully developed, earning full marks for the screenplay. The visuals of nature, palaces, horse chases etc are stunning, and the costumes full-bodied and colorful. The background score, while not remarkable, makes for an excellent prop.

That is in itself a creamy cake, but the film wouldn't be quite the dessert it is, had it not been for some icing in the form of delicious acting all round.

I'm not a raving fan of Barrymore but her Danielle is thoroughly likable, sweet without being cloying, confident without being overly theatrical. Dougray Scott does his job as the Prince, but I could see why his character likes Danielle much more than she likes him. The vixen of a stepmother is played immaculately by Anjelica Huston, as are the two daughters and the crones who serve as the domestics.

Dougray and Drew are great in their roles and have wonderful chemistry together. And the addition of Leonardo da Vinci? Perfect!

The accents are a nice try, but in their defense, to be ""historically"" accurate they would've had to speak French, so let it go.

1012679,3,6305265496,"I've been after this DVD for quite some time now, and kept bidding on it on Ebay, but it always went for outrageous prices. And someone always outbidded me at the last minute. So when I saw this for a reasonable price, I pounced on it. And it's one of those movies that just yell out to you to watch it straight away rather than those that sit there gathering dust, cos you can't bear to watch them - the two sequels to Mad Max, cos the first one was so bad!

Drew Barrymore is a great actress in this, going from a little scruff, to almost a member of royalty. You laugh when she first hits the Prince with an apple (good shot!). You ache for her as her world seems to fall apart when Prince Henry (Dougray Scott) learns the truth. You cheer when she renders justice to her oppressors. Despite what other reviewers have said, her accent was certainly not the dodgiest, try Dougray Scott's accent! If you listen very carefully, his true Scottish accent doesn't quite manage to stay hidden.

I would have definitely have rated this movie 4 out of 5 if it hadn't been for Dougray Scott. He is just missing something that makes a normal leading man so terrific. I didn't like him at all. And he didn't look like how I imagine Prince Charming to look when I was young. I can't put my finger on why I don't like him, or why he doesn't make a good leading man, it's just something strange.

Anjelica Huston was great in the movie. She didn't quite have the evilness I was after, at times she was actually quite nice, especially when she told Danielle how much she looked like her dad. She also reminded me of the character (the name escapes me) she played in Mists of Avalon.

There are some things I miss from the original Disney version. The fact that Cinderella & Prince Charming never really meet until the end, and he's supposed to find the woman he loves, and uses her glass slipper to find her. In this, Danielle does leave her glass slipper behind, but he already knows that. And then the Fairy Godmother is missing. But the addition of Da Vinci, if historically incorrect, is a nice twist on the Fairy Godmother.

This is definitely a must have for all romantics at heart, and if you're a fan of Dougray Scott, then that's a bonus I suppose. Not for me.",1099440000,4,2256,4.34916864608076

That's why I'm going to get this movie on DVD as soon as I save enough money for it. When you do order this movie, I strongly suggest you get the family together, and sit down with a big bowl of popcorn, and lots of soda.

I watched this movie in the theater and the first time I saw it at home was with my roomate, her boyfriend and all his tough guy, motorcycle riding, tatooed all over friends.  By the time this movie ended, all those tough guys were smiling from ear to ear trying their best to coolly state that they enjoyed the movie when you could tell they were all just as giddy as I was about it.

The best thing about this movie is that there are two points where you think it ends, then it takes off again.  I bought the DVD for myself a month ago after buying it as gifts for 3 different people.  A wonderful, wonderful story.

You'll love the cast, Angelica Houston turns in one of her best performances.  The guy who plays Leonardo DaVinci, not sure of his name, but he just steals every scene he's in.  This is just a well done, easy to watch, movie.  It's not overly ambitious but it really hits the mark it aimed for.

Except for the ending (really, who wouldn't guess that the prince and Cinderella come together?), the rest of the movie is full of unexpected moments that move you and make you laugh.  For example:

1) In what other movie do you have Leonardo Da Vinci as the fairy godmother? (or godfather, I guess...)

2) The heroine can actually hold her own against dangerous people and rescue the prince when he needs rescuing (in what is one of the movie's funniest moments).  Also, she's intelligent, and it shows.  She and the prince have real conversations about interesting topics (not like the empty chatter that's common in other romances).  And though the prince is quite an endearing guy, smart and sensitive (if not a little moody), it's the heroine who teaches him true strength of character.

3) Anjelica Huston is marvelous as the wicked stepmother.  There are moments when you see some heart in her, or a troubled mind, and then watch as she quickly conceals the vulnerability and returns to being her cruel, hard self.

4) One of the wicked stepsisters isn't so wicked after all...

Amidst this confrontation, Prince Henry shows up and is impressed by Gabrielle's guts, intelligence, and beauty.  Smitten by the Prince herself, Gabrielle lies to him about who she really is.

1012742,4,6305265496,"At first when I saw they were making this movie I was intrigued, but also skeptical, about this new twist on Perrault's Cinderella, this time starring Drew Barrymore.  Well, Cinderella is my second favourite fairy tale, so I should probably force myself to sit through it for that reason alone.  Barrymore's also not that bad of an actress, not the best, but hey not the worst. Then I notice Anjelica Huston is in it also, and hey I really like her so why not go and see it?
Well eventually I completely forgot about the movie, never did get around to seeing it in theatres.  Then while surfing through the channels on my TV I see a commercial for the movie being shown on some station and I'm intrigued all over again.  So I tune in to see the movie, and wow, I was not expecting this movie to be as great as it was.
This is not Disney's version of Cinderella, not by a long shot, so if that's what you're looking for in your tale of Cinderella I suggest you search elsewhere.  Instead of the pixie dust and fairy tails you get the legend of Cinderella, the supposedly true story which the fairy tales were later based off of.  The movie opens with the brothers Grimm arriving at a castle in France invited there by an again woman who wishes to tell them the true story of Cinderella without the magical pumpkins or a faery godmother.  I'll spare you all the details of the film which every other reviewer has already gone through.  I will however tell you that the performance is average from Drew Barrymore, no fireworks with her acting here, just the way she usually is, which isn't that bad but she's not going to be winning an Oscar anytime soon I promise you that.  Anjelica Huston was amazing and easily stole the movie away from Barrymore, she was simply delicious as an Evil Stepmother, the role fit her like a glove.  Perhaps my favourite role in the film was of Pierre le Pieu played by Richard O'Brien more widely known as Riff Raff in The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  I nearly fell off of my seat the first time I saw this movie and he first appeared!
You'll not be disappointed at all by this movie if you decide to take the time to sit and watch this movie.  It is however a ""chick-flick"" if you haven't already noticed so considered yourself warned.  It's not quite as bad as most of them, but it has the makings to make most men wish to rip their hair out at having to even think about watching this movie.",1087257600,,2423,4.34589800443459
1012743,5,6305265496,"This past weekend I had the pleasure of seeing one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  I am speaking of Ever After starring Drew Barrymore and Angelica Huston.  This is a Cinderella story with a bit of a twist.
The film opens with an ageing Princess being visited by to two gentlemen who turn out to be the Brothers Grimm.  She compliments them on their work and mentions her fascination with the tale of the little cinder girl.  While the brothers joke about pumpkins and fairy godmothers the princess reveals the glass slipper and offers to tell them the true tale.
Danielle gains a step-mother and two step-sisters when her father marries a Countess.  Soon she runs into the Prince.  She thinks he is a thief and pelts him with apples.  When she realizes her mistake she offers up her life.  But the Prince in on the run so he rewards her with gold.  Danielle uses the gold to buy back the husband of one of the servants.  But to do so she must impersonate a courtier and runs into the Prince again.  She manages to sneak away but only after giving her mother's name as her own.
The stage is now set.  The Prince does not want to marry the Spanish Princess his father has arranged for and seeks out Danielle.  Under the pretense that she is a courtier they spend time together and a romance blossoms.  The Prince is all set to announce his engagement (made at midnight at a ball) to Danielle but her step-mother reveals her base heritage and the Prince becomes angry.  But in the end everything works out and the scene returns to the Brothers Grimm and Danielle's great-granddaughter.
There are no elements of the fantastic in this tale.  No magic of fairies.  Instead an attempt is made to place the tale firmly into history.  The story is set in France in the Sixteenth century with the Prince being the Crown Prince of France.  A little more cement is added in the form of Leonardo Da.. Vinci who has arrived to be the Royal Artist.  Could this be during the two-year gap in Leonardo's history?  I don't know.  I do know that the movie is filled with humor, adventure and romance and stars a Cinderella who is a bit more competent than other renditions.
Angelica Huston is perfect as the step-mother.  She really has the knack of being totally evil and proper at the same time.  My only problem with the film was that the younger step-sister resembled Drew Barrymore a little too much.  But that is a very minor point and hardly detracts from the film.  I whole-heartedly recommend this film to anyone who likes a bit of fun, adventure, romance or any combination of the three.",1085702400,3,2595,4.479744136460554

1012745,5,6305265496,"I've said in other reviews i've done, Drew Barrymore is my all-time favorite actress. She portrays a sweetness and honesty to her characters. She does great in Romantic movies and this is my favorite romance movie she's done even though I also love Mad Love, The Wedding Singer, and Never Been Kissed. This is my all-time favorite version of Cinderella I think it's one of the few times where a different version than the original was 10 times better. My fasination with the story of Cinderella really started with this there is so much they did that made the movie better than the original did not.
  Drew Barrymore plays Danielle Debaberake (sp?) AKA Cinderella. Her mother died when she was a baby and for 8 years it was just her loving father and her. That is until he remarried and suddenly Danielle is left to get used to having a stepmother and two stepsisters around her age. Well 5 min. within the movie her her father dies and her stepmother makes her a servant and constantly verbally abuses her. When Cinderella is 18 is when Drew comes into the picture and she plays a very independent wise spunky and beautiful Cinderella.
 Anjelica Houston is priceless as the wicked stepmother and adds so much to the sterotype character. Anjelica while playing a mean and self-centered stepmother also adds a tiny touch of tenderness and feelings to the character the main scene you can see this is when Danielle is brushing her hair and the stepmother talks to her. Anjelica is such a classy graceful actress and I can't imagine anyone playing the stepmother better. She is almost worth watching this movie by herself.
Dougory Scott plays the prince of france Henry he is very easy on the eyes and is believeable as a prince. The prince is unintentionaly arrogant and at the first of the movie comes off as a little jerky. But that all changes when he meets Danielle. Her stepmother sold one of her fathers long-time servants to the americas when she couldn't pay her taxes and Danielle puts on a nice dress and does her hair and pretends to be part of the court in order to get him released. This is where she meets the prince who is automaticaly and obviously smitten and dumbfounded by her spirit and the fact she's the only ""courteer"" that has told him like it is and hasn't sucked up to him. Watching the two bump heads at their first few meetings as he at first always comes off jerky to her but the two are still smitten with each other is quite amusing to watch.
Her stepsister Margeritte (sp?) is blonde beautiful and bitc*y. She is constantly favored and spoiled by her mother and has her eyes on the prince simply because he's a prince. She ridiculously flirts with him everytime they are together and despite her great amount of effort it's obvious to the viewer that she'll never match up to Danielle. Margerette and her mother is still willing to ""take care"" of any competition that comes along and spends most of the movie scheming on how to get the princes affections.
I love how they made one of the stepsister's nice. Jacalenne is Danielles other stepsister who is actually very sweet softspoken and sympathetic to cinderella but at the sametime wants to please her mother. She is also verbally abused by her mother and is only a level up from Danielle in her mother's point of view. Even her dress is only a slight fancier than Danielle's. Every scene she's in she brings sweetness and innocence.
Also unlike the original, the prince and Danielle met long before the ""ball"" and so they already built affection before then. When she opens up her heart to ""Henry"" she starts standing up to her stepmother and to Margerette. When I first saw this, this made the movie for me. I myself am a very fiesty ""no crap"" woman and I found myself getting totally frustrated when someone is mistreated and they just stand there and take it. I kept saying ""IF THAT WAS ME I WOULD OF TOLD THEM WHERE TO GO"" so when she starts mouthing off back to them I thought ""you go girl it's about damn time"" one of the most satisfying scenes is when she socks Margerette in the eye. I found myself wishing she could of gotten in a couple more hits because like I said throughout the movie Margerette is a complete bit**.
This movie is funny, touching, romantic, dramatic, and just overall entertaining. Everyone in this movie holds their place and whoever cast this movie knows what they are doing cause I can't imagine anyone of these roles being played by anyone else better.
This is a great movie for anyone but I do think girls will appreciate it more because of all the romance and the ""independent woman"" vibe cinderella holds.",1082332800,2,4626,4.591293833131802

1012818,4,6305265496,"As far as the movie itself goes, this is a beautiful rendition of the age-old Cinderella story. The plot is conventional, without too many surprises, but it was perfectly cast and holds together throughout. The story is set in Renaissance France. Drew Barrymore's performance as Danielle, an orphan commoner forced to act as a servant to her noble step-mother and step-sisters, is flawless. When one of Danielle's fellow servants is slated for shipment to the Americas as a thief (a scapegoat for the step-mother's debts), Danielle disguises herself as a lady of the court in order to exact his freedom. While in disguise, she is spotted by the French Prince, Henry (Dougray Scott), who is fascinated by her spirit. Believing her to be a noblewoman, he falls in love with her, but her sister Marguerite has her own designs on the prince, and she and her mother will stop at nothing to get Danielle out of the way.
The supporting cast is wonderful as well. Anjelica Huston as the stepmother and Megan Dodds as Marguerite just ooze with malice and contempt. Their wicked scheming is both sinister and delightful to watch at the same time. The second step-sister, Jacqueline, who in this version of the story is only slighter better treated than Cinderella herself, is portrayed by Melanie Lynskey. She does a terrific job of showing her character's torn emotions, wanting to please her mother, but sympathetic to her unfairly-treated step-sister. And finally, the addition of Leonardo da Vinci (Patrick Godfrey) to the story as court painter was a stroke of genius in more than one way. A friend of the prince, his words of wisdom end up turning him into something of a matchmaker.
The film is further enhanced by beautiful cinematography (the opening credit sequence alone is breathtaking), gorgeous period costumes, and a wonderful musical score. The story is not, of course, historically accurate, but then it isn't supposed to be. This is a fairy tale, and in that regard it is executed to perfection.
My only disappointment is with the DVD itself. The ""Bonus Features"" link in the menu is a joke, as it leads to nothing more than the theatrical trailer. There isn't a single featurette, or cast/crew interview, or anything. A movie like this could have had some great material discussing the process of developing this adaptation, the costumes, and casting choices, the music, etc. I would love to know more about the thought processes behind this film, and for this omission I have to drop my overall rating of the DVD to a four, though I'd give the movie itself a five. I almost hope they release some sort of special edition in the future, with featurettes included, though then I'd be forced to buy it all over again.

The script is well written to attract audiences of all ages, while the on-screen romance between Barrymore and Scott left viewers satisfied, yet wanting more. The casting was well done with sensational actors and actresses such as Scott(the prince), Houston(the evil stepmother) and Barrymore(as ""Cinderella"") There are surprising, though enjoyable twists to the traditional plot such as a fairy ""godfather"" and Barrymore's uncanny ability to fight back when placed under durest, which is a considerable feat considering the time frame of the movie, somewhere in the 16th century. Thus, the film feature Barrymore as a somewhat revolutionary character in the feminist struggle and for the want of equal rights. Scott shines in his casting as the prince bringing new meaning to the terms ""chivalry"" and ""gentleman,"" and these were combined with his charming smile and good looks.
The only fault which I believe can be found with the movie is the fact that all the supposedly ""French"" characters are essentially English is speech.

Danielle de Barbourac, after the death of her father, grows up as a servant girl under her stepmother and two stepsisters (one of which is not so bad). She is a girl with a strong will and a stronger throwing arm, as she flings apples at the runaway prince as he speeds away on her family's horse. He is thrown off the animal by her strikes...Danielle realizes its the prince, and so the story truly begins.
Prince Henry dreads having an arranged marriage to the Princess of Spain and has ran away many times. He is in many respects, still a young boy. After this episode, the King informs him that he will have until the masked ball to choose his own wife, or else the arrangement with Spain holds.
Henry sees Danielle again as she dresses up like a courtier to save one of the servants that her stepmother has sold into slavery. She looks familiar, but Henry can't recall. He is intrigued by this spitfire of a girl and Danielle leaves him with the name Countess Nicole de Lancre.
The romance evolves through several forbidden ""dates"" with Leonardo da Vinci as the ""fairy godfather"". Meanwhile, Baroness de Ghent (the stepmother) and Marguerite (evil stepsister) has had their eyes on the Prince ever since they received news that he will be able to choose his own bride.
I will not ruin the climax of the movie as it is the best part of the film. But needless to say, they lived happily ever after. It's a wonderfully enchanting film and Drew Barrymore couldn't be more perfect for the role. This movie also has many great quotes full of wit, humor, and love.

Set in sixteenth-century France- which the dialect coach confusingly chose to indicate by giving the characters English accents ranging from the reasonable (Anjelica Huston) to the appallingly bad (Ms. Barrymore)- this version of the story presents Cinderella as a spunky, educated, strong-willed girl who triumphs over adversity as a result of her own daring and creativity.
  This wouldn't be so bad except that the poor script is indifferently delivered by a cast who seem to be projecting ""Ooh, look at me, I'm in a clever adaptation of a fairytale!"" throughout. Add to this the fact that there is little to no on-screen chemistry between Drew Barrymore's Danielle and the Prince (played, if such a one-dimensional performance can be so called, by Dougray Scott); the scenes where we are meant to marvel at how two such different personalities can fall in love are instead extended exercises in excruciating cuteness and smarm.

1012924,4,6305265496,"Ever After is truly an escape. It leaves you with the same warm, happy feeling as a fairy tale, but you feel less ashamed of yourself for enjoying it.
Drew Barrymore's character, Danielle, however seems to be drawing upon that same smart, bookish girl that is automatically a heroine. She is kind to the servants, misses her parents and loves to read. These traits are quite deliberately placed into scenes, instead of being woven in subtly. Drew Barrymore, though, does an excellent job with creating a bit of depth to her otherwise cliche character. At times, especially when she must say something particularly noble, Barrymore's delivery feels a bit forced, but overall it is almost unnoticable.
Melanie Lynskey gives more depth to her character in the few minutes she is on the screen, than some do in the entire movie. As the ""good stepsister"", she is not completely good. She does not posess the malevolence that her sister and mother posess, but she is not brave enough to confront them. She takes their abuse silently. She mentally cheers for Danielle, but when Danielle's chores are given to her, one can see the immediate unhappiness on her face.
The movie has a wonderful supporting cast, and the scenes are well-crafted and unique. The sets include some beautiful gardens and castles, and the movie is, for the most part, quite pleasing to the eye.",1057536000,2,1361,4.870689655172414

They all get good lines, and the ending is truly funny. I've seen many stories of cinderella that has been written, including the mediocre and humorous work of Whitney Houston and Brandy (Eugh).

In all truth, her name was Danielle and she was a servant who lost her father right off the bat. How would the prince met with this servant? Well, it was fate and luck. I will not give out too much of the story though. But these were characters you get to know and love. Hate, if you mention the stepsister. Leonardo Da Vinci plays the fairy godmother, or should I say fairy godfather. He was quite a charming fellow. The stepmother and sister are quite complex character beyond the scope of which Disney had portrayed them, but yet they are still after the same thing. That illusive crown.

She is stuck with her wicked step mother and one wicked step-sister(the other one is nice to her).  It is actually the prince who is quite immature and lost in life, until he meets his lovely match.

1013057,5,6305265496,"Very often ""realistic fantasy stories"" flop like dying fish. ""Ever After"" is one of the few exceptions, a sparkling tale about Cinderella in a semi-historic setting, with an outstanding cast, strong script, and a delightful love story. What's a fairy tale without magic? It's ""Ever After.""
Danielle (Drew Barrymore) is a young girl raised alone by her father, who encourages his daughter's intelligence, curiosity and strong will. But her life takes a tragic turn when her father marries a haughty social-climber Baroness Rodmilla De Ghent (Angelica Houston), and brings her and her two daughters Marguerite and Jacqueline (Megan Dodds and Melanie Lynskey) to live with Danielle. He dies tragically of a heart attack, leaving his daughter alone with his widow. Years later, Danielle is treated like one of the servants, with whom she is a loyal friend. Her only relics of her past life are a pair of shoes and a beautiful dress left by her mother.
When one of the servants is imprisoned falsely for theft, Danielle goes to try to save him. And there, she bumps into the young Prince Henry, who is being pressured by his stuffy parents to marry -- and Rodmilla is targeting him as a potential mate for one of her daughters. But Henry falls in love with Danielle -- her intelligence, her political knowledge, her love of fun, her bravery, and her strength. As Danielle and the prince grow closer, the scheming of her stepmother threatens to destroy their relationship.
The director knows the right way to mix comedy and drama in a way that seems entirely plausible. When Henry ""dumps"" the Spanish princess, or when he wakes his parents with all sorts of bright plans, the audience laughs out of affectionate amusement. You like or dislike the characters exactly as the director wants you to. And he apparently knows that magic is less in plot elements than in the atmosphere -- though the setting is medieval France, there is the sort of bright, ornate look to the castle and clothes that you see in fairy tales. (The only exception is the painfully-90s gown and sparkling makeup that Danielle wears at the climax. This is medieval France, not the Butterfly prom!) The script is full of funny or tense moments, and the frequent uses of Sir Thomas More's ""Utopia"" add an extra dimension of realism. And, in perhaps the most brilliant move in this film, one of the stepsisters is not ""wicked."" Rather the chubby, not-as-pretty but good-natured Jacqueline adds a silent ally to Danielle and prevents Jacqueline and Marguerite from turning, essentially, into one character.
Drew Barrymore is exquisite as Danielle, putting on Danielle's intelligence, wit and strength with ease and believability. Thankfully Danielle is never turned into a feminist in the usual sense of the word; she is unafraid to show that she is every inch a man's equal, but the movie doesn't bash viewers with that theme. Dougray Scott is equally good as Henry, mixing pride and confusion, sweetness and boredom into a very believable young prince. Anjelica Huston is almost hammily enjoyable as Rodmilla; Dodds and Lynskey are even better as her daughters. And even Leonardo da Vinci (Patrick Godfrey) makes an appearance to help smooth out the course of true love.
This is a family movie in the best sense of the word. The plotline and scripting are clever enough for adults to enjoy thoroughly, but there is nothing that the kids can't watch. So get everyone together and watch this enchanting retelling.",1033084800,47,3474,4.94017094017094
1013058,5,6305265496,"This is one of my fav films. Drew Barrymore stars as Danielle, a modern 16th century woman. She is no wimp. Faced with the death of her beloved father & then the cruelty of her stepmother and one of two stepsisters, Danielle still has optimism & a sunny view of life. She uses her brains as well as her charm to win the admiration and heart of the dashing Prince Henry (newcomer Dougray Scott).
When Danielle is sold to the evil Pierre Le Pieu (the deliciously wicked Richard O'Brien), Prince Henry goes to rescue her. But Danielle needs no rescuing. She has the situation well in hand as Henry discovers when he sees her exit Le Pieu's castle, her freedom & virtue intact.
As always, Anjelica Huston gives a winning performance as the Baroness, Danielle's cruel stepmother. She & Richard O'Brien give villainy a new name.

Angelica Houston is always a marvel and the reason I decided to watch the movie. This movie is now a favorite of mine and one I can watch over and over again without losing interest in the characters. This Cinderella version is more realistic to recent times in that Danielle (Barrymore) isn't a helpless, weak female that is dependent on a prince to save her life. Instead, Danielle saves him emotionally and spiritually. This love story really tugs at the heart strings and is the dream that the little girl within our hearts hopes to find one day.",1031875200,,661,4.471074380165289
1013060,5,6305265496,"While I wouldn't go as far as calling Drew Barrymore's Danielle a feminist, this is a refreshing, sweet take on the classic fairy tale.  A must for anyone who enjoys romantic dramedies or pretty period pieces.  This is both.
The overall theme of this movie is sweetness and idealism.  It's got it's share of villains, but the real challenge for Danielle is class conflict - this is a true 90's Cinderella.  To their credit, the issues aren't done heavy-handedly.  Things fit together with the plot and characters, and if you can succeed in ignoring all the philo-babble, this is a great movie to relax with - after all, you know how it ends.
The disparate accents of the multi-national cast (American, Scottish, French, Dutch, British) grate a little, but eventually, this gets lost in the lovely French scenery and particularly expressive faces of actors Barrymore, Dougray Scott, and Anjelica Huston.  While the characters have been a bit updated and fleshed out, they hold few surprises.  Danielle/Cinderella is a free-spirited (but chaste) go-getter with heart and her Prince is pretty dull until he meets her.  They discuss philosophy, education, and social responsibility.  Um, this isn't your grandma's Cinderella.
Some changes: The stepsisters figure more prominently in the plot and they're both scene stealers (notice how opposite the sisters are in every way).  Also, no magical elements, but we get Leonardo da Vinci instead, which is a nice touch.

1013113,5,6305265496,"The two young leads in this beautiful rendering of the Cinderella Story posess such lovely chemistry, one can actually forgive some of the historical mistakes included in this film.

He finds both in the form of a poor servant girl Danielle (Drew Barrymore actually stretching a bit, albeit with an iffy accent that comes and goes)whom he mistakes as a Countess and falls madly in love with. Angelica Houston is note perfect as the evil Stepmother Rodmilla DeGhent, she makes every line she utters fairly drip with contempt and bitterness, and Patrick Godfrey is flawless as Leonardo Da Vinci, the artist in residence at the castle, home to King Francis(Timothy West) and his lovely Queen (Judy Parfitt). This is essentially a typical boy meets girl story and the resolution is reached almost too easily and tidy for my taste, but what elevates this piece far and above it's peers is the lush cinematography and enthusiastic cast who seem to be having the time of thier lives.

Now that I am a mother & am retelling the story to my daughter,I am quite critical of the character. I find the cartoon 'Cinderella' character quite pathetic.  Yes, truthful & naive but too soft.
Now, Daniella is what I have in mind as the perfect Cinderella.  If I were the prince, I would not fall for a lady-in-distress type of maiden.  I would look for someone who has guts, intelligence & strength - both physically & emotionally.  Yes, Drew/Daniella's physical built was bigger than the ideal fair-framed but hers was more realistic.  If you were made to work on the fields like a slave, you would grow strong & rough.

Poor Drew Barrymore gets the worst dialogue I have ever seen her stuck with. Angelica Huston comes off looking pretty well, but then she gets better lines.

Ever After is a delight. It's not a masterpiece. It has some structural flaws. But the thoughtfulness and hard work that went into make it a fine entertainment. And Barrymore shows again that she has her famous family's genes.
This movie makes a number of changes to the children's classic. Most of them work, and all are intended to update the story. Barrymore's Danielle [Cinderella] is not the helpless victim of the original tale. She's a bright, feisty girl whose had some bad breaks in life and is trying to make the best of them. The always wonderful Anjelica Houston, who can play every thing from comedies [The Addams Family] to thrillers [Prizzi's Honor, The Grifters], portrays the stepmother, Rodnilla, as a miserable, ambitious woman. She's mean-spirited, but hardly evil incarnate. When her husband dies early in the film, her grief seems as genuine as his daugher, Danielle's. Even the stepsisters have changed. Neither are ugly. One is ordinary looking and is secretly appalled at the way Danielle is treated. The other is beautiful to look at, but as heartless as they come on the inside.
One of the best changes is in the social outlook. Many fairy tales are basically about impoverished characters in a country that oppresses the poor. They wind up marrying a member. The irony is that they become a member of the group that oppressed them, and once in, they appear to do nothing for the people they let behind. They are too busy living happily ever after. I always felt this sent a not-so-moral lesson to children.
In Ever After, Danielle is less than impressed when she meets Price Henry [Dougray Scott]. He is witty and handsome, but it is his father, after all, who has made life so miserable for the commoners. Henry gives no indication that he will be much different. Their second meeting happens only because Danielle must save a servant who has been taken away in lieu of the family's back taxes. She then finds out that he does have a heart and a brain, and that his attitude is a result of his never having know any life but a royal one.
The movie is done with a fine sense of humor. The dialog is very well written, and the cast delivers their lines with gusto. The sets and the costumes are delightful, with the exception of Danielle's ball gown, which is decidedly a dangerous fashion statement. I think it was designed as an inside joke.
The problems with plot structure are fairly minor. A pointless subplot was added to the beginning and the end of the film. At times, the effort to remake the story clashes with an odd tendency, at times. to try to be faithful to the original.",1017187200,7,2950,4.599620493358634
1013196,5,6305265496,"I absolutely love this movie. Drew Barrymore acts like she was born for this role and she's just so good! Its about a girl named Danielle and when her father dies she becomes a servant for her stepmother. Yup a cinderella story but instead of a fairy godmother, she gets a famous painter to help her!
Clearly showing that girls and women can be strong without needing magic and by being themselves. Appropriate for the whole family, and most girls and women will enjoy this sweet Cinderella Story. Its a spectacular movie, wonderful scenery, wonderfully made. Drew Barrymore shows the world what she's capable as an actress.
However the DVD's only special feature is the trailer. That's so disappointing! Clearly because I remember that this movie was promoted heavily and they had many interviews, etc., so they should have had more special effects rather than the trailer.",1016150400,,874,4.9523809523809526

Drew Barrymore puts in a pretty good performance as Cinderella, but I found her acting a little fake at times. Dougray Scott is wonderful (in looks and acting) as the dashing prince, and Anjelica Huston plays a totally convincing and detestable step mother.

The story is actually a flashback from the great-grandaughter of ""Cinderella"", who is actually named Danielle.  The story opens with eight-year-old Danielle's father returning with her new stepmother and stepsisters.  The very next day, Danielle's father leaves the manor and dies of a heart attack before passing the gates.  Ten years later, Danielle has been reduced to nothing more than a servant, while her stepfamily lives the life of luxury.  One day, the prince steals one of Danielle's horses and is brutally hit by Danielle.  When he is recognized by her, he pays her a large sum to keep her silence.  With that money, Danielle dresses as a courtier and frees Mauriece, a servant the Baroness (her stepmother) sold to pay taxes.  When the prince sees her, she gives him an alias: Comtess Nicole de Lancret.  The king tells the prince that he will host a masque and either choose his bride before that night or he will marry a Spanish princess.  Now that the masque is approaching, Danielle is rushing here and there to see the prince, but to make sure that her family doesn't discover her.  And to make matters worse, the Baroness is trying extra hard to make sure that her daughter, Marguerite, weds the prince.  On the night of the masque, the Baroness discovers Danielle's charade and locks her in the cellar.  How will Danielle escape and get to the masque?  With ""Nicole"" not there, who will the prince choose to marry?

1013347,5,6305265496,"This is a wonderful movie.  The premise may be clich, but this is much, much more than just another ""Cinderella"" movie.  Its effects are really quite magical--it will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will totally immerse you in its spell.  If you are human, it will produce a lump in your throat that will remain there for hours.  Some people might call this a ""woman's"" movie, but I, as a man, will proclaim that it really touches my heart every time I watch it, and I freely admit that it does bring tears to my eyes.  I need not go into detail describing the plot--it is a somewhat modernized Cinderella story, replete with the evil stepmother, charming prince, and angelic, mistreated heroine.  Instead of a fairy godmother, there is Leonardo da Vinci--an unexpected but brilliant scripting decision, I feel.  There are no magic pumpkins turning into horses and carriages, but there is magic; it is the magic of true love.
The entire cast is superb, particularly Anjelica Huston as the evil stepmother, but all of them are overshadowed by Drew Barrymore.  Anyone who does not feel that Drew Barrymore is one of the greatest actresses of this and any other generation has obviously not seen this movie.  I love all of Drew's movies, but I really believe this movie represents her finest performance.  Even down to the most unimportant nuances of acting, she is simply brilliant.  She is equally convincing as a peasant in the field as she is a royal courtier among the nobility of France.  The emotion she is able to express to the audience is deep and amazingly real.  I really can't say enough about her performance here.
All I can do is encourage you to experience this movie.  I believe you will want to watch it more than once; it is just as fresh and moving the second and third time as it is the first.  Don't dismiss it as a ""sappy love story"" or think its 16th century setting will make it hard to relate to.  This is a story as old as time itself, really, and it is a story that will always be relevant to humankind.  It celebrates the power of true love and shows all of us that dreams can indeed come true.",1005955200,111,2133,4.484455958549223
1013348,5,6305265496,"EVER AFTER is a visually beautiful film that encompasses the legendary fairy tale of Cinderalla with a twist. First of all, Cinderalla is really named Danielle who loves and cherish the novel Utopia, a book given to her by her late father. Instead of having little rodents as friends, Danielle's friends are the house servants who subsituted as motherly influnces during her youth. Instead of a fairy godmother, Danielle is guided by Leonardo de Vinci. Her charming prince has a habit of running away and disobeying his royal parents.
I believe the actors and actresses are perfectly cast. Anjelica Huston is the most perfect step-mom: cold, rigid, and centered only on the benefits her daughters could bring to her. Drew Barrymore's performance touches one's heart because she seems so earnest in her role. She loves life and happiness, a reason why her Prince finds her so appealing.
This 'new-age' rendition of Cinderalla is breath-taking. Buy it today, you will not be disappointed.",1002931200,,986,5.092592592592593
1013511,5,6305265496,"Those responsible for the casting and historical setting of this version of ""Cinderella"" must own the same book on The Renaissance that I own from the National Geographic Society. I say this because on one particular page on the Court of the real King Francis I, there is featured a painting called ""Three Female Musicians"", in which three dark-haired, dark-eyed ladies play instruments. The casting of Melanie Lynskey as Jacqueline de Ghent, the Good Stepsister, could well have been inspired by this painting. The same page also features an engraving of a tennis match such as the one featured in this film, which French nobles would have played in the 16th Century.
 As the heroine of the tale, a still-baby-faced Drew Barrymore delivers a fine, charismatic performance as the scullery maid who will not be broken by the authority of her cruel stepmother(Observe,the French don't have a word for ""stepmother"", so there is a certain irony to the fact that this story takes place in France).
 Anjelica Huston matches acting genes with Drew Barrymore as the conniving, overindulged stepmother of noble blood who uses her servants as pawns and refuses to cut her losses in order to adapt to economic adversity. It should be obvious to a viewer that she could have made the three young girls in her care work together to maintain the manor rather than pit them against each other.
 As the Older Evil Stepsister, Marguerite, Megan Dodds was an interesting choice for the part because her pinched-faced cruelty is obvious to the audience, but not so readily obvious to the handsome Prince Henry, played by a befuddled but good-intentioned Dougray Scott, nor to the King and Queen, played by the appropriately strong and regal Timothy West and Judy Parfitt. Dodds'perfomance reminds me of the old adage, ""An indulgent mother makes a sluttish daughter.""
 Melanie Lynskey's performance as the good Stepsister along with the performances of the actors who play the three servants, is one of the redeeming qualities of the otherwise miserable household. The presence of da Vinci in the story adds a divine benevolence to this tale, and as a child, I did read a version of ""Cinderella"" in which a male figure had the role of the Fairy Godmother.
 I have wondered why the accents of the principals were English rather than French. But ultimately, we watch an assertive young woman with a keen intellectual ability form a necessary and loving alliance with a Prince which appropriately takes place over time, proving her mettle against both his tormenters and her own, going out of her way to rescue those she loves, inspiring a childhood friend to do the same on her behalf, encouraging the understanding of societal outcasts, improving the quality of life for her small circle of friends, and justly putting her tormentors in their rightful places.
 This is a beautiful movie--a da Vinci painting come to life. However flawed it may be, it should inspire any viewer to great things!",1001894400,9,2972,4.957831325301205

Danielle is wonderfully independant, passionate, and strong - all of those are the reasons Prince Henry falls in love with her. It is nice to see him be enchanted by her inner qualities and not simply her beauty. He grows up as a result of meeting her, as she fearlessly discusses her beliefs with him. Leonardo da Vinci is a great character, as the wise, irreverent old man who guides Henry through his emotions and decisions with sharp wit. Even the stepmother has her moments of weakness, and it is shown how her cruelty towards her stepdaughter is fueled by jealousy - the girl's father loved his daughter more than her.

1013644,4,6305265496,"Well, this is not really the drum I march to, but even Charles Dickens had a fondness for ""Little Red Riding Hood."" In some ways, this movie was a very bold effort. It took the classic story 'Cinderella,' and not only improved greatly on it, but left it within the boundaries of plausibility. The scenery is either gentle or spectacular at times, but always great! Barrymore is a well developed character. Her love for her father is made clear; she does her work as a servant with dignity; later she takes a dare to help a servant she cares about; when she falls in love, she dares to break a few rules; and she even falls into deep sorrow as well as deep rages at times. Most of the secondary characters are well handled. Henry is wonderful as a prince who develops humanly and morally. His parents are also handled well. They are disturbed by his growing desire for independence; they have clever one liners; ('I shall deny you the crown and live forever.'); they prove flexible as parents; they are given the pleasure of seeing parents stranger than they;  and they rise to prove heroes in the end! Leonardo Da Vinci is handled not only greatly, but humanly as well. In a work of fiction, it can be a charming bonus to throw in some characters who really did exist. Leonardo's character not only makes demands on our admiration, but he also reveals to us he is human. (A certain term used in a conversation with Prince Henry will tell us that!) The 'Cinderella' basis was heavily improved upon. One stepsister is bad, but the other is good. The good stepsister is memorable. She is very gentle; she shows herself to be virtuous; and she helps rise to give us a happy ending. My only complaint about this whole movie is that the wicked stepmother and stepsister are not as well handled as they could have been. They are quite repulsive throughout the movie. Also, there is nothing redeeming in them that allows us to see them as human. Charles Dickens was usually careful not to do this. He either put enough redeeming qualities in his villains so we could see them as human (Alfred Jingle, Fagin, Bradley Headstone), or he used so much energy in making them so wicked and evil, that they were more fascinating than repulsive (Daniel Quilp, John Chester, Uriah Heep).

Ever After is a light movie that while, benevolent and warm, escapes the flippancy that one may expect from a flick that was targeted at an adolescent female audience.  The beauty of this movie is its strict adherence to rational metaphysics; I've never seen a fairy tale presented this way.  The good characters in this movie draw their power through books and knowledge, through fierce independence and relentless individuality.  The evil characters in this movie are destroyed by their superficiality and parasitic reliance on the good.  Compared to the message of most of these types of movies from Hollywood, Ever After is defiantly positive.",992390400,,716,5.137931034482759
1013646,5,6305265496,"The opening scenes of the French countryside will make you wish you lived in France. In fact, you will feel very much a part of this movie as it will embrace your heart and captivate your attention.

As I watched this delicious fairy tale for the second time...this very evening, it occurred to me that my need to see the movie for the second time was so I could analyze the characters and find out why this story was quite so human yet so magical. Drew Barrymore (Cinderella) lent an almost ethereal quality to the movie. She floated on the screen like an angel, even before she gets her wings. She will steal your heart with her acting! She plays a country girl or a queen with equal ease. Only Drew could have played this part so well.

I found many contrasts in this movie. The idea of a greedy selfish woman chasing a rich man versus a man seeking the companionship of an intelligent woman who has inner beauty is contrasted quite beautifully in Ever After. A score fit for royalty fills out the film, carrying the emotions from light and carefree to deep and thoughtful, and sometimes even pensive. In some scenes, you must observe the facial expressions to completely appreciate the humor. You will laugh so many times you will want to watch it again. You will also laugh again the second time you watch it and will even appreciate the humor more. I could list 20 favorite witty lines at least.

Cinderella is Danielle. To Danielle's stepmother, she is mearly a pebble in her shoe. To the Prince of France (Dougray Scott) she is a mountain of strength that inspires him to pursue his own dreams and ""enlightens"" him. While Danielle is trapped in a social nightmare as a servant girl, she is happy. The prince who has everything, is still trying to find himself. When Prince Henry and Danielle meet, she throws apples at him, not realizing who he is. When Danielle helps to free a servant from being sold into slavery with money she received at the time the prince ""borrows"" one of their horses to escape from the palace....they again meet and he is intrigued by her knowledge of a book her father gave to her just before he died.

Prince Henry is not satisfied with his station in life so he seeks out ways to encourage his own happiness. He is destined to become king, yet does not desire the responsibility. Danielle is seeking love and has lost both her parents and her stepmother (Anjelica Huston) has lost the ability to love and is the child of an obsessive compulsive mother. One key to her character is when Danielle's father dies and all the evil stepmother says is: ""You cannot leave me here."" She has a human side and we somehow feel we want to like her, yet her words at times are chilling!

Her daughters are quite different. Jacqueline sees through their mothers fake attempts at deceiving their stepsister and Marguerite knows how to increase the intrigue, yet almost stalks the Prince to gain his attention. Danielle on the other hand casts an intoxicating spell on the Prince that he cannot resist.

There is nothing feminist about this movie. Yes, Danielle does enjoy reading and when she is given the choice of any book on a bookshelf she says: ""I could no sooner choose a star in the heavens."" She wants to educate herself, yet she does not demand that she be equal to the Prince, but does demand a respect for human rights. So perhaps that is what some viewers are picking up on. She is sweet and feminine and gains her man's respect so he naturally seeks her out as his equal. It IS about love!

Love gives you wings so you can fly to the place you want to be. It is a decision of the heart, which should be considered with the intellect as well. Yes, some things are meant to be. You must see this movie! It is one of the most beautiful romantic comedies I have ever seen....twice in one night! The exquisite costumes and scenery are only the backdrop for sheer magic.

Directors should take note of Andy Tennant's directing and I hope they will realize that with almost 700 reviews, a movie with this spirit is what we viewers love! Humor, romance, adventure, passion...this has it all. Escape for a few hours into the magical world only Cinderella can show you. I will be watching this movie many, many times. It deals with deeper issues and shows how people fall in love, the realistic way with magical results.

No pumpkin or singing required ;>. If you enjoy Fairy Tales, I also reviewed the ""Illustrated Book of Fairy Tales by Neil Philip. Nilesh Mistry has also illustrated the book to perfection. Cinderella is included in this world of tales. You might also enjoy ""The Illustrated Book of Myths."" Neil Philip has a Ph. D. in myth and folklore and has a great talent for giving insight into the cultural background of each story. Many stories have changed over time, yet they still hold true to the basic premise that evil is punished and good is rewarded. Fairy tales are filled with magic and wonder. They do in fact cast a spell on the reader.

Secretly, I think adults enjoy these stories just as much as children do. I love the ""book"" aspect in this movie. It is just delicious! This is now my favorite Cinderella story. Reading by a fire sounds good to me.

1013647,5,6305265496,"This is a GREAT movie version of Cinderella.  It has a few minor changes from the original story; but it is a fully-fleshed out story.  Drew Barrymore does a FANTASTIC job as the stepdaughter.  The stepmother if perfectly evil, and yet at times, you almost feel sorry for her.  There is a slight change in the way the stepsisters act, which i really like.  One of them, although being rich and spoiled, still tends to be more on Cinderella's side.  Throwing Leonardo Da Vinci into the story really made it great, as well!  That extra little twist was perfect!  :>  I definitely recommend it!  And the DVD includes the trailer, which uses 2 great songs as well (unfortunately, these 2 songs from the trailer are NOT on the soundtrack).  Not really anything else extra on the DVD though, which was a little disappointing.",991353600,,819,4.6573426573426575

I love historical romance books and this movie seems to fit right into that catogory only it's in film.  Inasmuch as I am embarrass to admit, I've watch this film more than 10 times, I've already memorized lines and occurances yet each time I watch it, I still could feel goosebumps.  The cinderella remake added with more unexpected twist and adventure truly made this film one of a kind.  The courtside, gypsy scene, the mask ball and of course, the ending is my favorite of all.  It's heart warming the way Danielle cares for her servant & the way they love her in return.  Even the wicked stepmom and sisters contributed tremendously in this film.  What can a say, I have no complaints even after watching it more than 10 times.  I only have pure admiration to everyone involved in this film.  I wish there's more movie like this in the future.
I also have the VHS version of this film but I enjoyed the DVD version better.  DVD price is quite expensive,... No regrets however cuz the wide screen/picture quality/sound quality is much better plus the additional features DVD contains make this film an even more enjoyable treat at all times.",989971200,4,1394,4.54

Daniel is a girl who loved her father very much. But when he died, her stepmother forced her to become a servant in her own home. When she is caught by the prince while freeing a servant, he mistakes her for a countess and falls in love. When her stepmother suspects something, she locks her up so she can't go to the ball. But she is set free by a friend and gets to the ball. But when she is exposed as a servant, the princes love is put to the test. Will he love her even though she is a servant?

I thought that the scenery (filmed on location in France) was absolutely breathtaking and (most) of the acting was superb.  I think (although many would disagree) that Drew Barrymore seemed uncomfortable with her role.  She sounded incredibly awkward using a British accent.  But besides to that, Dougray Scott (Prince Henry) was truly extraordinary.  By watching the movie you can most definitely tell why he was casted as ""Prince Charming"".  There's something about him that you just can't put your finger on...he has become another one of my favourite actors (Ioan Gruffudd, of course, being the first).  A definite must-have!!",983836800,,703,5.008620689655173

The only thing I would like to add to the previous rave reviews is that the feminist subtext mentioned previously is deftly entwined in the love story, and not at all heavy-handed (as in, say, Mulan).  In short, you wind up falling in love with Danielle for the same spirited qualities that the prince does.  It would also be a mistake to narrowly categorize this as a children's movie--it works perfectly well as a romance for adults, and I personally think Ms. Barrymore's performance is Oscar-quality.",983404800,,627,4.942857142857143

There really isn't any.  But the film is amazing.  It is funny, sad, frustrating, poetic and victorious.  In the film, it says that this is the true tale of Cinderella, and the story then proceeds to be told.  Anjelica Houston is pure evil as the stepmother of Danielle.  It really makes you hate her.",981590400,,478,4.552941176470588

It's a full length movie, with a lot more action and excitement than the Disney version. Barrymore's Cinderella is a far better role model for our girl than the cartoon character: she's pretty, strong minded, and tough. The bad people in the movie are not so bad as to be scary to small children, yet convincing enough to have the kids rooting for Cinderella the whole time.",980467200,,608,4.587155963302752
1013878,4,6305265496,"I agree with the previous reviewers who liked this movie. I did not expect to like it. The first time through it was a little silly to me. It felt like light-weight romantic mishmash. But something compelled me to watch it again  the next day, and I discovered that a great deal happens in the beginnning of the movie that I missed the first time around.
For instance, the manservant who is sold into bondage. He was Danielle's father's top servant. Once I recognized his face, the plot made more sense. The stepmother and wicked stepsister  are sinister and ridiculous at the same time. And the ""good"" stepsister was a good idea. It made more sense to have one of the other young women be empathetic to ""Cinderella.""
The young prince was just right, full of strength and spirit, and not too perfect to be believable. And Drew Barrymore! Why, this move makes me want to go out and rent every other movie she's made. She was superb in this film!  Just mouthy enough to be exciting, and just docile enough to be ultra-feminine in a lithe teenage sort of way.
""Ever After"" is an excellent light historical romance. Sweet and cliche but that that's OK. This is not realism. In fact, it's supposed to happen in France, but some (not all) of the actors use English accents. I can imagine that preteen and young teenage girls would find this the best movie of their lives.  Adults can also find a great deal here to enjoy.  Highly recommended!

1013881,4,6305265496,"Possibly the best film I have seen Drew Barrymore in, as of late (""Charlie's Angels"" takes a different turn on the estrogen kick.) She is a completely pro-active heroine, and that is SO appealling and much more interesting to watch over the more traditional self-abnegating Cinderella character we are familiar with. Of course, she has wonderful support- from Anjelica Huston (deliciously evil as the stepmother), Patrick Godfrey as an adorable Leonardo DaVinci, Dougray Scott as the Prince, and veteran actress Jean Moreau, who plays her great-great-great granddaughter, narrating the story for the record to the ""Brothers Grimm."" Beautifully filmed, simple story-telling and fairly accurate costuming make for an enchanting couple of hours.",978912000,2,742,5.633928571428571
1013882,5,6305265496,"I love this movie for many reasons, but the most important reason is that it portrays Cinderella as an intelligent and self sufficient person.  Yes, of course she gets her prince charming but unlike other versions of the tale, she dosn't need a fairy godmother, and she dosn't need the prince to save her while she sits around waiting.  This cinderella is a real woman with real problems, and she finds true love.  That is what a fairy tale is supposed to be.",978912000,,459,4.506024096385542
1013883,4,6305265496,"Given low expectations, no matter how well-recommended, this film can't help but succeed. It's a competent, well-made redoing of the Cinderella story, marred by a couple of narrative cliches (Cinderella's granddaughter telling the Brothers Grimm how it ""really"" happened, some petty vengeance scenes) and some throwaway lines.
Barrymore's luminosity shines through her limitations as an actress; every scene she's in is carried by her heartfelt performance. Angelica Huston is also brilliant as the very arch, evil stepmother. Dougray Scott is adequate as the prince, but one is grateful that he wasn't able to do ""Wolverine"" for the X-Men movie after watching this. The stepsisters were entertaining, though it was nice to see Melanie Lynskey (""Heavenly Creatures"") again.
The story kind of lurches, and the throw-away lines and scenes begin to wear on the good will generated by some of the plot innovations. Still, it's a good story, with basically a good heart, and well worth watching.",978912000,,990,5.352564102564102
1013884,5,6305265496,"I must admit an Associate gave this DVD to me. It collected dust for months before I finally sat down to watch it. Boy was I blown away by this film, Drew Barrymore has done the impossible -she made Cinderella accessible to today's independent, free spirited women like me.  Her Danielle (Cinderella) isn't sitting around waiting to be saved by some Prince.  She's strong willed, forceful, has her own opinions and is independent. These very qualities are the qualities that made her Unique and intoxicating to her Prince Charming.  She's a true role model for women of all ages. It's a feminist version without being preachy, and it's the perfect light hearted, yet romantic film that both women and men can enjoy.  It's the type of film that you can watch over and over again, no matter what mood you are in. It's perfectly vapid, but charming and engaging at the same time. I watched it 15 times in two months.  This film is highly recommended.
This is a rare case where the VHS Edition of a film outshines the DVD Version. The DVD's Letterboxed aspect ratio is too extreme, even for my 60 Inch Widescreen TV, the picture was still way to small, and it's not even animorphic, so zooming in, still doesn't fill up the screen. The Digital transfer is sharp but the extreme aspect ratio makes the color tones on the cinematography look washed out. As far as the added value DVD Junk that we've come to expect from a Fox release, this DVD is barren.
The only thing it contains is the Trailer and some cast bios, and for that they want $29? Don't pay it!  Get the VHS Tape. This is one of those films that's truly meant to fill up an entire screen and you can only get that with the VHS version.
This was one of Fox's very first DVD releases so I forgive it for the sloppiness and shallowness of this package - only because I love the movie so much.  But an excellent movie like this deserves a ""special edition"" package to make the DVD purchase worthwhile.",977270400,9,1955,4.474719101123595
1013885,5,6305265496,"I was very surprised to find myself enjoying this film, as I had thought this would be another typical Cinderella story. I mean how many fairy tale versions of this can there ever be until someone calls it quits. Well, this'll be the one to end them all. Drew Barrymore as Danielle (aka Cinderella) and Angelica Huston as her stepmother both give excellent and moving performances. Some have commented on Drew's English accent as being a bit off, although her performance far outweighs that fault, if it does exist. Angelica is a real treat to watch as well and may be, for some of you, the more focal point of the film. What sets the storyline apart from all other versions is in the character of Danielle herself. Contrary to the old fairytale, she is an independent young lady fully capable of saving herself from predicaments using her own skill and wit. The attempt of the valiant prince insisting on being her savior adds the comical twist to the tale. Through her tasks, Danielle establishes a strong sense of worth and aptness to her Cinderella character, which the other tales have failed to do. And while the underlying hint of feminism is apparent, it doesn't detract from the film, but rather creates a more delightful plot and sweet romance. Watch this movie, preferably on widescreen for the beautiful scenery, and you'll find yourself falling in love and enjoying it more than you thought you would.

Seeing as i have no self-respect and even fewer friends, i have no reservations in stating that i loved this one from start to finish. It is a clever and highly original retelling of the classic Cinderella story, set in France. The entire cast does an inspired job. Drew Barrymore hasn't been this endearing since ""E.T."" (or was it ""Doppelganger"" ? I keep confusing the two), Anjelica Huston is a fittingly loathsome stepmother and even the featured ""prince charming"" i found easy to stomach. Need i recount the (allegedly true) tale ? (daughter turned lowly servant turned pretend courtier turned princess) Check elsewhere !
The pre-feminist subtext is hard to overlook, but far from obtrusive. Couldn't help liking the not so evil second stepsister. No fantastic elements are introduced: there is no evidence of sorcery, or a pumpkin anywhere to be found. Replacing the fairy godmother with Leonardo da Vinci of all people is a stroke of genius, adding to the credibility of the storyline. The payoff is thoroughly satisfactory, leaving you with a smile on your face. My fellow countryman Jeroen Krabb (Barrymore's father) sees his acting career cut short as he is killed off within the first five minutes or so. The whole thing is accompanied by a great music score. Set aside your prejudice & suspend your disbelief. This is 1 hour and 57 minutes well spent !",969753600,100,1464,4.86

It's  both realistic and plausible (like i said, no fairies or magic pumpkins or  such things) And yet, for reasons i can't explain, this movie is actually  good.

Trying to  save one of her beloved servants (though she has become a servant herself)  she goes to court to free him, also meeting the prince.  He is, of course,  smitten, and she keeps up a masquerade of a lady, in order to continue  seeing him.  The story follows the basics of the Cinderella tale (slipper,  wicked stepmother), but in this case, we have a Cinderella who doesn't need  a prince to save her, just to love her for who she is.

As time  passes, her vain and conniving step-mother goes to extreme lengths to get  one of her daughters noticed by the crown prince of France.  Danielle, in  the meantime, impersonates a courtier in order to save the life of a fellow  peasant and life-long friend, and she gets noticed herself!  Yikes -- a  charade on dangerous ground.
The acting is good, the imagery is great,  the story is familiar, but not, and the casting is superb.  Kudos all  around!
This is definitely a 5 star offering.  It is fun, has something  for everyone, it is universally watchable, and children and adults alike  are able to enjoy it to the fullest.
Don't let this video get  away.

I guess I want to say that this one is an  absolute must for any true romantic. It's one of those rare movies that  makes you believe that there is still such a thing as TRUE LOVE.

I know I am supposed to love movies like Contact and Apollo 13... and I do... but I can deny it no longer, ""Ever After"" is my favorite movie.  The plot is the Cinderella  story with a couple of captivating twists.  Instead of a fairy godmother,  there is the genius Leonardo De Vinci, and Danielle (Cinderella) can  actually think for herself.  Although I love the plot, there are so many  other stunning details that make this movie a masterpiece.  These include  the setting, the costumes, the casting, the characters, and the historical  tie-ins.  Now, I haven't dug up my old history books to verify the details,  but the historical links draw you in and make the story seem less like a  fairy tale and more like reality.  The bottom line is that I absolutely  love this movie on so many different levels.  This is a classic, and much  much better than any other telling of this story I have ever seen or heard.

The acting is done horriblly.  The directing is also  horrible.  There is nothing right with this movie except the fact that Drew  Barrymore is in it.  Even she's horrible in this movie.

Drew just has a sparkle to her that she carries to all her  characters and this one is no exception. From shy to bold and courageous,  Danielle is the heroine of all heroines. She overcomes all her obstacles to  capture the heart of the prince like no other.

I liked how Danielle got back at Marguerite, her evil stepsister  (the other stepsister, Jacqueline, was ""good""), whereas in other  movies the poor protagonist just stood there helpless.
There were also  more funny parts in it than you would think. Overall, Ever After was one of  those ""It's-better-than-I-thought-it-would-be"" films.",958608000,,490,5.012345679012346

The DVD is nothing  special. The subtitles are thankfully below the movie (and I think would be  visible even on a wide screen TV, with the movie's aspect ratio of 2.35:1).  I listened to it on a mono TV, so can't comment about the surround quality.  There are no special features apart from the trailer. The root menu is  nice. It has some animation and has music playing, which already starts  drawing you into the mood of the movie. At least, it did for me.",956620800,,654,4.276422764227642

I am a big Barrymore fan and have seen most of her movies, but this is the best one yet.  If you are not a Barrymore fan you just  might end up becoming one after viewing this film.  She brings the  character of Danielle to life and really makes you feel for her.  The  chemistry between Danielle and the Crown Prince is outstanding.
All the  other characters are wonderful and add to the overall quality of the film.  This is one movie that the whole family should watch together.",956361600,,643,4.336134453781512

When asked to describe the film, I simply say ""Cinderella, without the fairy god mother and  pumpkin"".  I love the soundtrack for this film.  I don't have to see  the picture on the tube, because I can tell what is happening by the  music.
I also like the fact that the film goes one step beyond the  traditional story.  I always wondered what became of the stepmother and  stepsisters.  Now I know, and it goes beyond my imagination.
If you are  looking for a movie that everyone in the family can watch, this is it.  There's sword fighting, intrigue, tenderness and advice that works in the  21st century as well as it would have in the 16th.",956188800,,764,4.215277777777778

I truly loved the way the director and  screenwriters took a simple imaginative fairytale and turned it to a  believable story, where personal triumph is the greatest gift if one has  the courage and conviction to look within ourselves. Throughout this story  our ""Cinderella"", known as Danielle never strays far from who she  is inside. So few people today have the courage to stand up for another  person,or their beliefs,to take risks,and fight for what is right. This  movie was beautifully written, has a remarkable music score, and a cast of  fantastic actors,not too mention being set in a breathtaking area of  France. I can not recommend this film enough.

What has occurred is the making of a fantasy (fairy tale)  more realistic.  Using characters of real people (The Grimms Brothers) and  the nobilities (real people and time period) just adds to the realism of  it.  This version is heartfelt, humorous and an attention getter.  I  HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie.",955238400,,474,4.89873417721519

The main characters are Daniel played by Drew Barrymore, the evil step mom played by Anjelica Houston, and Prince Henry played by Dougray Scott.  Directed by Andy Tennant who also directed Anna and the King and many more  wonderful movies. There are still some differences between the Disney  version of Cinderella and the modern version, Ever After. For example, Ever  After had a woman telling a story of what happened throughout her life. In  the Disney version the story was just played out. I thought that was very  creative of the writers of Ever After. Even though this is a modern version  of Cinderella, I believe that it is telling its own story.

Drew grows up with the wickedly terrific Anjelica  Houston treating her as a hired hand.  By accident, Drew meets the handsome  prince and falls in love...she instantly becomes competition for her  stepsister and the fallout that comes next is heart wrenching!  Leonardo  DaVinci is Drew's fairy godfather in a sense and he helps Drew get to the  ball.  A modern twist on a great romance...it is well acted and full of  beautiful scenery.

And for those of you who complain about the  ""DeVinci"" typos -- remember that this IS a film purly for  entertainment.  If it's great (which it is!), nothing else matter.

I rented it on a Monday, watched it that night and loved it,  watched it again every night until Sunday- that's when I bought it. And I  don't think I'm going to stop watching it either. The love is not  mushy-mushy perfect with now flaws-that's what makes it sooooo romantic.  The actors/actresses make the story become reality, not just people playing  the parts of some fairy tale. Drew Barrymore played her part so well that  now I am addicted to all and any movies she's even had a 3 minute piece in!

It is a make you feel good movie.  I have told my friends about  it.  When I first saw the movie I thought that Danielle would have rejected  the Prince after his callous treatment of her. But she didn't because she  realized that he had changed and he realized that she had caused the change  in him.  The ending is great.  Nothing like getting even in the end.

This version is a refreshing ""real"" adaptation that is truly charming.  Gone  is the fantastical magic (no pumpkin here), replaced with a strong,  plausible heroine who doesn't wait for a man to save her.
Dougray Scott  is wonderful and charming as the angst-ridden Crown Prince rebelling from  his legacy.  His love/hate relationship with his princely celebrity status  is well drawn.  Drew Barrymore is convincing, if a bit cutesy, as the girl  who makes him realize he has the key to another world outside the gilded  cage he's building around himself.
Anjelica Huston is perfect as the  conniving stepmother.  She never becomes a cartoon character version of  evil - as could easily happen - she remains human.
The costuming and  locales are stunning and Andy Tennant keeps things moving with enough  action and comic touches to keep everyone in the family entertained.  I  highly recommend this latest version of the Cinderella tale!",949622400,9,1071,5.057471264367816

Drew Barrymore is well-cast as the independent, free-thinking (if not unmistakenly feminist)  Danielle, Dougray Scott is a fresh and appealing Prince Charming (here  known as Henry), Patrick Godfrey is loveable as Leonardo da Vinci (an  unexpected ""fairy godmother""), Anjelica Huston in the role she  was born to play is the most promising wicked stepmother yet seen in any  medium of entertainment, Melanie Lynksey prevents the possibility of a trio  of villains as the kind and loving stepsister Jaqueline, while Megan Dodds  draws more hatred from the audience than Huston's stepmother as the wicked  (and extremely spoiled) stepsister Marguerite. The scrpit is purposely  updated so as to shed light on the subjects of feminism and the rights of  servants. All in all, the cast is splendid, the script is fresh and the  lavish costumes and elaborate sets make for an all around enjoyment of  everyone's favorite fairy tale. Hooray for Cinderella!",924220800,4,1075,5.222222222222222

I mean, not only is it the classic fairy tale love story, but it's charisma (Barrymore and Scott were terrific together) and mesmirizing sequences  (when she arrives at the ball, especially) is enough to renew the faith in  true love that we can loose in day to day reality.

Although seeing it on a big screen is preferable, the video version is much woth owning - so you can watch it over...and  over...and over...and over...get the picture ?  Everything about this movie  is superb.  All the actors are brilliant and Houston is absolutely fabulous  in her role.  As a huge lover of fairytales - I must say that I was very  far from being dissapointed with this version - it is lovely, romantic,  funny, dramatic, exciting and entertaining.

1016330,4,6305265496,"I liked ""Ever-After:  A Cinderella Story"" because Danielle (Drew Barrymore) is a strong character.  She knows how to defend herself physically and speaks her mind to both men and women in all stations, which  sometimes does her in.  That means the character Danielle isn't flawless.  Even though Danielle lies to save one of the  servants and passes herself  off as a noblewoman-cousin living with her stepmother and step-sisters, her  intentions are true to her nature.  I plan to rent it again in the future!",921369600,,510,4.976190476190476

1017200,5,6305265496,"I thought that this movie was an excellent spin on an old story. Usually, Cinderella is portrayed as this little waif girl who hopes someone will notice her. Someone who waits for a Man to rescue her. However in this  story, Cinderella(as portrayed by Drew Barrymore), has a strong sense of  self and of herself. She knows she is smart and cunning, and, unfortunately  knows her stature in the rigid class system of the Middle Ages. Yet she  overcomes this with grace and humility, even when she is insulted by her  family. I felt that Dougray Scott did an excellent job as the Prince. His  character even had to be rescued instead of the other way around. The angle  with Leonardo da Vinci was rather awesome, it fared well in the frame and  context in the movie. Also, the idea of libraries at the monasteries was so  historically accurate. For that I was proud of Hollywood itself! This movie  puts a 90s twist on the Cinderella story. This film is even suitable for  children, it does not have profanity, nudity, or anything else that could  be of high offense to someone. The innards of the film such as direction,  production, cinemotography and the like were all solid. I recommend this  film highly!!!!!",919123200,,1211,4.650943396226415

Brilliant casting all around... Bravo, bravo, bravo!",918691200,,341,5.39622641509434
1017543,5,6305265496,"God knows I love Drew Barrymore.  Ever since The Wedding Singer, I've been entranced.  She does indeed seem to be living up to her Butterfly metaphor.  ""ugly and awkward"" to start...though she was never ugly, she was  hardly an angel.  But recently, she has evolved into a truely great  actress, person, and I had to admit my heart took an extra beat when I saw  her in her wings in this movie.  The lovely Angel Barrymore.
Ahem...but  the rest of the movie was also great.  Hehe.  DaVinchi's protrail was  excellent and humerous, and the entire movie had an air of entertainment  and fun mixed with a plot and dialouge that an older audience will love.  Romantics from every generation will smile, and cheer.  A very intellegent,  fufilling movie.  Rated on the Internet Movie Database as a TOP 10 MOVIE of  1998.  It deserves it's high status, too.

There is a slight feminist, girl-power bent to it, but, you know the story and nothing I can say will spoil it or add to it.  Angelica Huston really steals the show as the Step-Mother!  I've honestly memorized all her lines because they are just dripping with villainous, sarcasm.  She really is just one of those great actors.  It's also awesome to have two members of legendary Hollywood families in the same movie.  However, I wish Drew Barrymore could have really matched Huston's performance  Barrymore's accent (and acting) needed to be much better, but overall this is just one of those movies where I don't care because it's just too darn good!",1524268800,,715,4.851239669421488
