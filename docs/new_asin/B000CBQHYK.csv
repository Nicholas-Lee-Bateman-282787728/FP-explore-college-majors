8096707,5,B000CBQHYK,"If you are interested in Cold War science fiction from the other side of the Iron Curtain, Planeta Bur is one good bet. It is as imaginative as any Hollywood/Western world sci-fi product and  in certain ways maybe even more so. Although one has to make mental corrections while reading the films English language subtitles, it is still understandable. I am no fan of socialism, but as a former film student, I would recommend this as a glimpse into Soviet-era hopes and dreams for space that parallels what we hoped for back in the early 1960s (when this film was made.)",1523923200,,570,4.643564356435643

8096710,4,B000CBQHYK,"The original from which much of Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet and Peter Bogdanovich's first film, The Voyage to the Planet of the Prehistoric women, were copped. I hear the special effects were considered incredible in its time (1961). Another virtue, we can just be grateful for. Even though it's a Soviet picture, it contains very little direct Soviet propaganda. Instead, the explorers indirectly make propaganda by being Soviet Men, all intrepid and all altruistic. Even the woman Masha, who, left behind, wishes to help save the crew she has lost radio contact with. While this has been condemned sexist, I'm not certain it's not the opposite, what posed as feminism in the Russia of 1961. She is, in fact, as intrepid, altruistic and naive as the men. Overall I liked the movie. However, more for its interest historically than as competition for the current state of the art.",1325203200,,885,4.946308724832215

It drags you to sleep,the robot is a Robby want to be. Try to borrow or rent before you decide to buy,to me its way to much for what you get.",1285718400,,306,4.203389830508475
8096712,5,B000CBQHYK,"The first example of Soviet science fiction that conquered the western market, the film has risen as a model for many subsequent productions, especially American. Despite the naivete of the whole, the film by Klushantsev is considered a true classic of science fiction cinema for saying a ""structural location"" on subsequent American productions focused on exploring the galaxy.
The disaster in space, the crash landing, the robot that become crazy, escape from the hostile planet are moments with clockwork punctuality will occupy the minds of writers and measure the talent and imagination of filmmakers to come (take for example the recent Red Planet ).?
 Less experienced (and most intriguing) is instead better insight Klushantsev mind ,to symbolize two images of women (the real - Masha - the other fruit, perhaps, of the hallucination of an astronaut) the dialectic between technology and dream, between science and poetry.
Masha, who presides over and protects from the rescue operation, is a safe reference (a little 'mother) for men in scouting, the ghost Venus is a past irrevocably lost that instinct strongly regrets.Roger Corman bought the rights to distribute the film in America and pillaged the sequences to make other films (Prehistoric Voyage To The Planet, Voyage to the Planet of Women Prehistoric).In the United States is known under the titles: Cosmonauts on Venus, Planet of Storms, Planet of Tempests, Planeta Bur, Storm Planet.?
In Italy is also known as  Planet of the storms. and  i 7 navigatori dello spazio",1274400000,4,1539,5.193548387096774
8096713,5,B000CBQHYK,"Pavel Klushanstev (1910-1999) was a Russian film director and special effects creator. With the exception of ""Planeta Bur"", his films are speculative science documentaries -- not feature films. His first documentary/visionary film -- ""The Road to the Stars"" -- presented the space age and its potential to the USSR in 1957. Walter Cronkite presented segments from it on the CBS ""The Twentieth Century"" television series introducing this work in the wake of Sputnik, at the onset of the space age, in 1958. The success of ""The Road to the Stars"" enabled Klushanstev to create other films.

Based on a novel by Aleksandr Kazantsev, the science fiction film ""Planeta Bur"" follows a team of Russian cosmonauts in exploring Venus. This is back in 1962 when Venus was still shrouded in mystery so suspend disbelief when you hit 'play'. Adversity and challenges must be overcome before the cosmonauts return home.

OK, maybe it's not a *great* film but it *is* a very good one in its own way -- very well done and, really, a gem of a film. It does have its moments of Soviet propaganda -- Klushantsev had his own ideas of how to shape the film and he did not always get his way. But he did manage to create a film that is imaginative and entertaining, intelligent and contemplative. The film moves along at its own pace.

This Lenfilm release eclipses *all* previous releases -- thank goodness. The DVD appears to have been mastered from (gasp) good elements. The image is clean and clear, maybe a little soft. English subtitles appear to have been made for a theatrical release and not revisited for a home viewing; they're small but readable -- something I wish Lenfilm would revisit. The extras *are* worth viewing. If you want to see this film on NTSC DVD -- *this* is the one to buy.

Klushantsev managed to do so much with so little. If you want to learn more about him, try to track down a copy of ""The Star Dreamer"" (2002) -- a 55 minute Danish documentary about this remarkable individual whose work enriched Russian fantastik cinema and are still enjoyable today.",1225670400,11,2066,4.730555555555555
