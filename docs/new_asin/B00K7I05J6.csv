8656544,5,B00K7I05J6,"I've been looking for this video for a while and finally found it over a year ago. It had some exciting deer hunts and even included Stan Potts in Illinois taking one of the true giants that big-buck state's got a reputation for. It's said to be one of the largest ever taken on video. If anybody dreams of taking a buck of a lifetime, check out this video and see Stan's hunt and who knows? That can be a reality for you! There was also a hunt that was special for H.S. Pro-Staffer Rick White as he took a nice deer in Iowa. He kept repeating, ""This is for you, Dad,"" and for good reason. It showed a little icon and some writing which said, ""At the time this video was shot, Rick's dad was battling cancer. 8 days later, he lost his fight.""",1510185600,,742,4.124137931034483
