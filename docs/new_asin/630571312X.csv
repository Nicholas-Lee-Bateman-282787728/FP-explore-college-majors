1072587,5,630571312X,"I have waited for a long time for the Walking Tall Trilogy to be released on DVD but was not over joyed with the DVD set. First I have to say is that the movies are all outstanding and can be watched over and over aging without loosing their excitement. But, it looks like Rhino did not use a master print but a copy of the video tape. The print they used I think is a very poor print. Walking Tall part 1 has alot of what I call ""video tape lines' runnig through it, the Final Chapter is real dark in some scenes, and over all the video quality is not what you expect out of a DVD. It looks like you are watching a video tape. Rhino, you did Bufford Pusser an injustice! And I have to agree with the other reviewer; Where is the TV series at??? Release them pleaseeeee.
Over all, for the movies sake I give it a 5 star plus. On Rhinos part, 5 stars for releasing the movies on DVD, and 2 stars for their transfer. Go back to the master prints, thx them, re-do a new release to DVD including a release of the TV series.
If you like Walking Tall and Buford Pusser at all, this is a DVD set you will wnat to own",1045267200,50,1109,3.955357142857143
1072588,5,630571312X,"I would reccomend the trilogy of ""Walking Tall"" to anyone interested in a great classic action show. It will be a great addition to my movie collection. Recently though I had the chance to visit Buford Pussers home in Adamsville in McNairy County, TN.  His house has been turned into a museum and is open to the public. If you ever have the chance to visit the town and museum please do so. You will see how Hollywood can distort the truth ... Buford was a great lawman, there is no doubt but Hollywood really messed things up from the way that things actually happened. The tour of the museum will really open your eyes to the real Buford Pusser. He did not carry a big stick as the movie portrays, but he did carry a gun and he did break up a mob that was running illegal booze and gambling. He deserves to be rated as one the nations top heros but I wish Hollywood would just make a follow up movie that actually tells it like it was during his days as a lawman.
Again I would reccomend this set to anyone to buy for their collection, but just remember that it was made in Hollywood ... is not very accurate in it's content. If you would like to get more information about Buford and the way things actually happened visit the official web site for him ...",1032652800,2,1259,4.245833333333334
1072589,5,630571312X,"Although the entire trilogy is good, the best is the first! There is no doubt that Joe Don Baker's portrayal of Buford Pusser is unbeatable!
The true story of this brave sheriff reminded me that there really are certain principles worth fighting for.  It's too bad his life was so tragic. We could certainly use some of his bravery in this day and age.",992563200,2,352,4.5

1073344,4,630571312X,"This collection makes a great addition to anyone's video library.  All three Walking Tall movies are included and with many extras.  You get the original trailers to each movie and additional photos, also.  The quality of the trailers are not very good, but they are still worth watching.  There is a nice mini-documentary on the making of part 3 which was made at the time the movie was being made.  The best extra is the documentary about Buford Pusser's life.  It features many interviews with people that actually knew Pusser and includes an interview with his Daughter Dwana Pusser.  She even admits that the movies go overboard with the fact about Buford and his famous stick and that he really didn't carry one all the time, but explains that Buford would use whatever was lying around to administer justice.  But she adds that it did add to her father's persona of speaking softly and carrying a big stick. The only negative is the quality of the transfer.  It would have been better if they would have remastered the movie, but it is still clear and the quality is much better than previous versions.  If you are a fan of the Walking Tall trilogy or in 70s action movies, then you will enjoy this collection.",1468195200,9,1217,4.644859813084112

1073347,5,630571312X,I went to the movies in the early 1970's and saw all three (3); they were great then and still are. Joe Don Baker did a great job in the first movie; not sure why he didn't do the sequel(s); Bo Svenson did an O.K. performance in the sequel's; but I think Joe Don Baker would have done justice to the follow-up since viewers were already familiar with his character.,1467849600,,365,4.228571428571429
1073348,3,630571312X,"SHOUT FACTORY have reissued all 3 Walking tall films on blu-ray with all new 1080p 1:85:1 HD transfers
with only 2.0 Master audio stereo mixes
the picture quality of all 3 films looks excellent, shout factory have done a Great job
cleaning up the picture quality from the old dvd versions which looks very sharp & clear
the sound quality could be better the first walking tall should've been given 5.1 master mix, not an average stereo mix
after watching all 3 films, Joe don baker is the best version of Buford pusser for sure
Bo svenson does a Good job, but Joe don baker's performance is incredible
the 2nd film continues directly after the last scene from the first film so i found the 3rd film confusing abit
Shout factory always make the effort to add new extras for their reissues
with this blu-ray trilogy a new retrospective featurette has been added which only goes for 29mins actually
the only cast from the 3 films that are interviewed are the 2 child actors that played Buford pusser's children
which is Dawn Lyn & Leif Garrett plus Actor Bruce Glover who played Buford pusser's Deputy sherriff in all 3 films
Buford pusser's real life Daughter Dwana pusser is also interviewed & some of Buford's colleagues from the police department
are interviewed, Joe Don baker is also interviewed but only Audio interview which i thought was pathetic
for some reason Joe don baker was not interviewed in person for this blu-ray reissue
which is what should've happened
SF should've made more effort getting a face to face interview with Joe don baker, not an Audio one
Actor Bo svenson is also not interviewed about his role in the 2 sequels, which i thought another pathetic effort by shout factory
 Actress Elizabeth hartman who played Buford's wife in the first film tragically died back in 1987
otherwise she may have been interviewed for this blu-ray release
apart from that that's all you going to get for this retrospective featurette
there's also Theatrical trailers, TV spots, stills photo Gallery for each film
the 3rd film Final chapter has a TV broadcast promo behind the scenes interviews with the Director & actor Bo svenson in 1:33:1 ratio
Shout factory also released this trilogy on 2 Disc dvd set which has the same extras as this blu-ray version
the only difference is the picture & audio quality of the 3 films
the DVD set has only Digital remaster transfers of each film, the blu-ray has HD transfers big difference
if you love all 3 films better to get this blu-ray trilogy much better picture quality in High definition
3 stars for this blu-ray trilogy, if SF had made more effort getting face to face interviews with Joe don baker & Bo svenson
then i would give 5 stars for this release",1467244800,2,2711,4.695378151260504

Joe Don Baker puts most of the wanna be Tough Guys to shame in this film.  Without even seeing him, his voice is enough to tell you that a big can of Whoop A-- has been opened. But he acts like it too.  You don't want to mess with this guy.  This is the best one out of all the Walking Tall films that have come out over the years.  Just be aware that this is a 1973 film, and the censors did not allow some things that may seem routine now as far as graphic violence.  But it still puts out plenty for anyone looking for a great ""good guy gets even"" movie.  Wait till you see what he does with his home made bat.",1466208000,,739,3.847682119205298

Dwana, Buford's daughter, will be the first to tell you her daddy was no 'saint', but he fought for what he believed in, and we sorely need that kind of man now who won't 'buckle under the system' , who will stand up for what is right. Of course Buford knew the movie wasn't 100% accurate, but even most of the fiction was based on something that really happened to Buford. I saw the original movie for the first time at age 9, and I believe it helped me to want to stand up for what I believe in. One person's life really can make a difference.

But, there is definitely a serious problem with getting the movies (all three in these series) started. I thought I was going to have to send them back. That was very disappointing and made for an irritating and frustrating situation. All three Walking Tall movies had trouble starting. I had to stop, and re-start the system a time or two for them to get going. They seemed to freeze just prior to setting up. . Once they started they were all right so far as the movies themselves are concerned. Whoever is preparing these seriously needs to fix this problem. The movies brought back a lot of memories of when I first saw the original one with Joe Don Baker and the second one with Bo Svenson. The color and detail was fantastic as contrasted with the old originals. I would have given 5 stars if it had not been for all the trouble getting the DVD's started each time.",1435276800,,962,4.435028248587571

I actually saw this for the first time when I was 11 or 12 years old. Oh dear Lord right, what terrible parents I had. I liked Bo Svenson more so than Joe Don Baker as the actor to play the part of Buford. What an amazing man Buford was. He handled business as a sheriff, the way it should be taken care of.

I had never heard of Sheriff Pusser until I saw this movie, for the first time, years ago.  He  and his family lived in danger, every day, because of corrupt and evil people---even those in high places.  I am very glad that I purchased this set through Amazon.

1075579,5,630571312X,"I was 2 years old when this one came out, I remember it airing on CBS numerous times throughout the early 80's when I was a kid, however as an adult I find that this film still holds up well, based on a true story that took place in my home state of Tennessee, it is hard to believe that people would do these things to a Sheriff who sought to clean up his town, Jon Don Baker is Buford Pusser & is very convincing, the first film will always be the best, it is gritty & at times downright nasty, but men like Pusser is somthing we need more of, there isn't much I can say that others haven't already covered, but this is a classic film that will never bore me, Baker unfortunately didn't return for the sequels, the second film I didn't care much for, it was to Hollywood for me, however the third film ""Final Chapter"" does get back to what made the first film great, Bo Svenson does a good job taking over the role as Pusser, this one could have easily been a better second film but it too falls a little flat, but I say the original is all you really need to understand the kind of man Buford Pusser was, it you want good old fashion American justice, than this is one to get.",1391817600,2,1179,4.086206896551724

The original ""Walking Tall"" is one of the most violent films ever made, and even now it has the power to make you feel a bit sick. I still love it. The sequels aren't bad, but they are softer, probably because, whereas Joe Don Baker was a brute force of rising anger and hideous untapped violent potential, Bo Svenson is a teddy-bear football star-type. Not that the sequels are bad, they just shouldn't be confused as being like the original.
Shout! Factory's DVD set is complete with many great extras, interviews, trailers, and collectible packaging. After years of being off the market, the original nightmare masterpiece of nonstop violence is back and more restored than ever.

Joe Don Baker plays Pusser in the original movie an does a good job . The film stock was colorful an great shape. This film is much better than the remake made back in 2004 . For one in the seventies people had that redneck look to them . Then theres Pepper Martin who's a special effect of Her own , lights up the movie whenever She shows up .This southern movie  has its drawbacks , but still  holds up today, but the other two  films stars Bo Sverson an the second sequel  an tries to be like the original but  is half  way good an  the third is just for the money.

1076133,5,630571312X,"This is the film that unleashed Joe Don Baker onto an unsuspecting public and the end result is a compelling fact based story that gets your blood pumping all the way up until the end credits. After re-locating back to his home town in Tennesee, ex wrestler Pusser survives a brutal attack from the state line mob and while healing up, decides to run for town sherrif. After winning, Pusser is obsessively driven to end all corruption in his town but comes at a higher price than he expected. The iconic club hits plenty of home runs off redneck heads as Pusser sends more and more gomers to the hospital. Veteran western character actors give phenomenal support as we get an uncompromising look at some of the slimiest backstabbers ever seen in movies. The director doesn't leave much to the imagination as the violence is unflinchingly shown and this is one of the few films that you feel ""dirty"" after viewing. Bruce Glover and Felton Perry are the uncorruptable deputies that back Buford all the way. 70's audiences stood up and cheered as Joe Don Baker sold Buford Pusser as an invincible hero to the world and how much hollywood changed the original story can be seen in the book which is ripe for another movie. The true story is so different from any of the films and there is more to tell about the results of Pusser eventually cornering the very people who killed his wife. The film is non PC so turn it up for reality's sake. The dvd from shout is 16x9 w/5.1 surround sound that complements all the action. Some audio comments from Baker keeps everyone in the dark about what it was like on the set with Pusser and everyone else has nothing much to say about the movie vs. what really happened.  Absolutely avoid the new Dwayne ""the rock"" Johnson's version an inferior rehash with none of the talent that made the original a classic.  After the first ""walking tall"" the makers of part 2 were obviously looking to make a much more tame film and not exploit Pusser's recent death. The movie Bo Svenson walked into  was not the opportunity that Joe Don Baker had. We hope to see the bigger more imposing Svenson on a rampage to club, beat and shoot those responsible for his wife's death, but we don't because they are out of his reach. He hardly even gets to yell at anyone in this. Bo Svenson's best role as Buford Pusser is not W.T. part 2 or 3, it is the walking tall t.v. series with more action and drama providing Bo a chance to show he could do the part as good as Joe Don Baker. Pusser gets out of the hospital and faces all kinds of attempts on his life while trying to catch moonshiners. I still like this film because it is based on fact, and somehow it is very believable. Luke Askew and Richard Jaekel do a great job as bad guys. 16x9 DVD looks great but no interview with Bo Svenson or any discussion about how fictional part 2 and 3 were. A screen test  was supposedly made with Pusser originally cast in part 2 but nothing here on that. All comments from Pusser's family and friends are interesting but not too informative especially for anyone who read the book.  Final chapter has more action in it and is great up until Buford is voted out. Unfortunately the rest crawls along like a snail. Besides the boredom, Pusser seems a bit confused and is frustrating to watch as his life falls apart around him. Svenson is wasted in this and the obvious potential for a better movie can be found in the book, but they dropped the ball in a major way. Luckily, the T.V. series makes up for this downbeat error. 16x9 dvd is great. The audio is messed up during the bar fight scene, but the rest is just fine. Some decent trailers and a retro making of, are real gems and in good quality. A must own for fans of Buford Pusser, Joe Don Baker, and Bo Svenson.",1360454400,,3774,4.408895265423243

1076462,4,630571312X,"A trio of films from Bing Crosby Productions, the WALKING TALL series were mostly-fictionalized accounts of the life and alternately tragic and triumphant times of Tennessee small-town police chief Bufford Pusser in the `60s and early `70s. All three films - newly available on both Blu-Ray and DVD from Shout! Factory -make for ideal drive-in fare, mixing fisticuffs, some social justice sermonizing and vigilantism that would likewise become a potent formula for the ""Death Wish"" series.

The original ""Walking Tall"" is by far the best of the trio: a somewhat crudely made yet undeniably compelling B-movie with Joe Don Baker as Pusser, a former wrestler who returns to his small Tennessee town, only to find crime, corruption, moonshinin' and prostitution having overrun the local residents. Pusser nearly dies, twice, as he tries to clean up the town - first as a frustrated, concerned citizen, then as the newly elected sheriff - forever running into opposition from crooked judges, lying politicians and local white trash.

Baker's performance anchors the original WALKING TALL which became a huge hit in 1973, leading to a series of wannabes and similar ""redneck justice"" pictures. It's not a great movie by any means, but it has a certain charm about it, with the movie having been made on a workmanlike level across the board. Walter Scharf's melodic, occasionally overwrought score includes a forgettable Johnny Mathis end credits tune, while the supporting cast features little Leif Garrett as Pusser's son and a pair of young actresses who met with premature ends: Elizabeth Hartman, who plays Pusser's wife, later committed suicide in the `80s (she also voiced Mrs. Brisby in ""The Secret of NIMH""), as did Brenda Benet, Bill Bixby's ex-wife, who killed herself in 1982 and makes an impression here as a hooker sympathetic to the sheriff's crusade.

Baker didn't return for WALKING TALL: PART II, a barely serviceable 1975 sequel with Pusser still taking on the local mob in a movie that feels more like a TV film recycling as opposed to a legitimate big-screen continuation. Bo Svenson, at least, does a decent job as Pusser with a few faces having returned from the original; Walter Scharf repeated his scoring chores in a film that was released shortly after the real-life Pusser's mysterious death.

1977's FINAL CHAPTER: WALKING TALL is an appreciable step-up from its predecessor, offering an interesting account of Pusser's continued attempts to dismantle local organized crime, to his work with a film crew documenting his life and sad demise. The Howard B. Kreitsek-Samuel A. Peeples script aims higher than the second film, picking up some loose plot threads from the original that the first sequel overlooked, with Pusser's character being more developed as the lawman loses almost everything - though ultimately not his legacy.

Shout's Blu-Ray set is a gem: the first film's 1080p transfer (all films are 1.85) has been culled from a pre-existing HD master and looks pretty good, with just a hint of DNR, and a 2.0 DTS MA stereo remix. Judging from the credited telecine colorist who worked on Parts II and III, the sequels appear to have been freshly transferred for this release, boasting decent detail, less DNR and 2.0 DTS MA mono soundtracks, though the modest budgets and no-frills filming of each installment certainly don't make for HD ""eye candy"" or demo material.

Extras are also on-hand, including a documentary offering new interviews with Baker (albeit off-camera), Garrett, his sister Dawn Lyn (who plays his sister in the film), and numerous members of Pusser's own family, who discuss the real man whose story inspired the movies (and the later, lame remake with The Rock). TV spots for all films, trailers for the sequels, and a vintage look at the production of ""Final Chapter: Walking Tall"" make for an excellent package, which is also available on DVD with the same extras this May from Shout!",1337126400,54,3939,5.080370942812983

We watched the first movie last week on my projector and 80"" screen, and I can honestly say that this is the best this movie has ever looked. We saw no scratches, specks, dirt, nothing but a perfect picture. As far as HD quality, I can't speak for that since we only watched the first film.

I know a lot of people are curious about the special features, so here we go....

There are 2 discs on the blu ray set, and oddly enough, the first and 2nd movies are on the first disc on 1 side...the 3rd movie is on a disc by itself. I would have figured that part 1 would be on a disc alone, as it is the best film. Part 1 has 2 tv previews and a photo gallery; Part 2 has tv previews, a trailer and another photo gallery. Strangely, Part 2 is where the best feature is...the all-new ""Buford Pusser Story"" feature, which includes new interviews with many of the cast and real life people, including Leif Garrett, Dawn Lyn, Bruce Glover, Dwana Pusser and many more. What really disappointed and baffled me is that Joe Don Baker is only heard, not seen, as narrator. He is not shown giving his thoughts on-screen. Disc 2, which has Part 3 on it, has a trailer, more photos, and some older footage.

I can't speak yet for how parts 2 & 3 looked, as we only watched part 1, but the set is well worth the price for the fantastic transfer of the best of the trilogy and for the new interviews (even though we don't get to see Joe Don!).",1336348800,21,1519,4.191780821917808

As others have stated, they all include a lot of violence...much of it accurate to Pusser's real life. They are at times disturbing and there were times when I gasped viewing them for the first time. Pusser was a one of a kind character in real life, and the filmmakers did a good job of bringing that uniqueness to screen. I like both Baker and Svenson as Pusser. The first one and the last one are the best movies of the three, but the second one is important to bridge the gap. Getting the box set is a good idea in my opinion.

Synopses of the individual films appear below:

Walking Tall

The Original is still a Classic

Joe Don Baker plays the part of Buford Pusser, a.k.a. Buford the Bull, a pro wrestler who is disenchanted with the crooked sport and who decides to settle down in his home town in rural Tennessee. Home is not the way he remembers it, though. There is a hint of corruption in the air.

This does not matter overly much to Buford until it affects him personally. When the local thugs, working for the local moonshiners and madam, work him over and leave him for dead, he decides that he has had enough. He doesn't get a gun, his wife does not like guns. Instead, when he recovers, he gets a big piece of oak, heads over to the roadhouse where all the problems are and proceeds to kick everyone's collective butt. That lands him in jail.

When the trial comes about, it's a pretty open and shut case. Even Buford admits that he did the violence. It looks like he is going to be convicted until he fires his lawyer, makes an impassioned plea on his own behalf, shows the jury his scars and promises that if he is acquitted, he will run for sheriff and clean up the town. He gets off and then proceeds to clean things up.

The problem is that the crooks don't want to be cleaned up. They fight him and even threaten his family. That makes it personal for Buford. He cleans them up anyway but has to endure a fair amount of grief in the process. Throughout it all, he relies only on speaking softly and carrying a BIG stick.

This is not highbrow. Its just a simple good versus evil story. Buford is the good guy and he is likable.

Walking Tall Part 2

Vengeance in Mine Sayeth Buford

Near the end of the Original WALKING TALL, Sheriff Pusser's wife is killed while the mob is attempting to kill him. Now it is time for payback. There are a few changes, though.

Bo Svenson replaces Joe Don Baker as the likable sheriff. He does a creditable job but, under the circumstances, he is less concerned with the niceties of exactly following the law.

He's still effective, though. He is so effective that the mob is desperate to get him and hires a variety of hit men to do the job. One of the mob leaders, in particular, is just as obsessed with getting the sheriff as the sheriff is with getting them. That leads to an intense conflict and no concern for niceties. That means violence and mayhem.

Even with his proclivity for violence, the sheriff is concerned for his people. He is still a ""nice"" guy unless you are one of the people who is responsible for the problems. He still manages to get most of the small fry but the big fish still elude him.

This is not a bad movie as sequels go but it is not as good as the original. Anger can only take you so far in progressing the plot. It cannot make up for a lesser script and lesser story.

Walking Tall: The Final Chapter

End of the Road

The second Walking Tall ends with a notice that Sheriff Buford was killed in an auto accident. This third one picks up earlier in the story though. He is still adamant about getting the people who killed his wife and the Mob is still bent on getting the sheriff but Buford has a problem. He has lost his job as sheriff.

The job loss comes about for several reasons. In some cases, Buford is scene as having gone too far outside the legal boundaries. This happens even when his solutions make life easier for everyone, including the perpetrators. The people of his county also seem a bit jaded by continued success. Where they once cheered him, now they are not ready to support him.

The loss of his job means that Buford has to go after justice as a private citizen and he is well on his way to the poorhouse in pursuing his aims. The new sheriff is suspicious of him and is fearful that Buford might become a problem for him. It begins to look like he might have to move away with his business unfinished when he gets a lucky break.

A Hollywood producer learns of his story and wants to make a movie about him. That brings in money and a chance for achieving his goals. The mob leader with a taste for vengeance finally gets his chance and we learn the story of the end of the former Sheriff of McNairy County.

This one is better than the second but not as good as the first.",1159228800,10,4580,4.293844367015098
1076603,5,630571312X,i like this movie set because it deplects some of the real life characteristics of Bufford Pusser.  I know this for a fact because i grew up in Adamsville Tn just a few houses down from the Bufford Pusser museum and some of my family members knew him very well.  My family has lived in that area along time and we know just about anything and everything about Bufford that you won't find in the movies here or in the books.  If you purchase this triology and have any questions about it feel free to email me at anthony.goodman1@us.army.mil thank you and have a nice day.,1144368000,4,571,4.367924528301887
1076604,5,630571312X,"This is a great 3-DVD collection.  I have looked for a while to find these movies, then came across the 3-DVD set.  All 3 of the DVD's were error free, no problems at all.  The DVD collection was received 3 days early.

  As for the movies themselves, they are great action movies.  Watching these made me stop and think about law enforcement people and what their families go through: a lot of work with little to no appreciation.

  If you want to watch a good action movie, then these are for you.",1141862400,5,500,4.336956521739131
1076605,4,630571312X,"The trilogy came in a nicely boxed set and I found the DVDs to  be without flaw.  The movies were much as I remembered them to be when I first saw them in the theatre upon their initial release lo these many years ago. I enjoyed them greatly!! If there is a downside to watching something 30 years later, it lies in the fact that we have become a much more sophisticated viewer today than when these were first released.",1141776000,4,420,4.2375

1076607,5,630571312X,"This movie has a wonderful story to it. The only thing you sould consider when you buy it is when it was made. It is a old movie and is not as advanced as the movies that are made today. Like I mentioned though, the story is great. I enjoyed it even more than the modern day walking tall, although that is my opinion.",1124928000,4,317,3.96875
1076608,5,630571312X,I loved all three of these films and it great to have them all included here. The original Walking Tall is the best but I have always enjoyed the two sequels as well. A wonderful series.,1102896000,2,186,4.194444444444445

Sheriff Pusser wanted to rid his county of the vermin of society
to make it a better place to live, but as  reality sets  in,the  storey can be set to modern day america and the methamphetamine
labs and the under-funded sheriff's  who have to  keep law and order in area's where everyone and his brother  is a weed smoker and aparasite on society.
wish they would change the constitution so  more sheriff's
could rid their county's of evil doer's.",1080950400,2,492,4.46067415730337
1076610,4,630571312X,"I recall seeing the first ""Walking Tall"" movie when I was real small, back in the late '70s. I saw the last two chapters in later years, enjoyed them as well. However, not to take away from Bo Svenson's performances, I was somewhat bummed that Joe Don Baker wasn't in the last two parts. Nevertheless, I decided to buy the trilogy box set and i'm glad I did. If you're looking for a good action movie, you should get this whole series.",1078099200,4,435,4.317073170731708
