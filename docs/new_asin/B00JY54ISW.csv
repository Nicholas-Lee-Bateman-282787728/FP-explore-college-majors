6397193,5,B00JY54ISW,"This movie is so fabulous! My two preschoolers love it so much and dance along to it every day. At the end of the DVD, they promptly ask if they can watch it again the next day. :) It is great: the characters are memorable, the songs stick in your head, and my little ones laugh and laugh and laugh. I also really appreciate how an audio CD with the music was included with the DVD. Miss Erin, if you need any encouragement to make more DVDs, please consider this your encouragement!",1453075200,4,483,4.260869565217392

6397195,5,B00JY54ISW,My 3 year olds love this and so do I! I like that it starts out slow with stretching and becomes more active throughout the video. I pull it out every rainy and cold day. It is easy for them to follow and fun for me to do with them. It really does feel magical. My kids want to do this over and over. I wish there were more videos of Miss Erin's magical dance class. I would buy them all!,1451433600,4,388,3.802469135802469

8654567,5,B00JY54ISW,"Ive purchased several kids workout videos in an attempt to get my own workout in without my 3-year-old clinging to my ankles.
This is her favorite by far, and one of my favorites as well.

CONTENT:
This short 22-minute movie opens with a brief introduction by Miss Erin to her dance classroom, then moves on to 6 animated locations, with a costume change for each:
A forest:  warm-up
A pizza kitchen:  stretching
London Bridge: a basic introduction to some ballet positions (sung to the tune of London Bridge)
A farm: animal-themed movements (e.g., galloping like a horse, crawling on all fours like a cow)
A bus:  a short dance to The Wheels on the Bus
A park: free dance with a red light / green light element
Then its back to the real world for a quick good-bye.  Theres no cool-down or finishing stretch.
Miss Erin is accompanied by several girl students and one boy student, all probably between 6 and 8 years old.

OPINION:
I enjoy this movie.  The production values are on the cheaper end of something youd see on PBS.  The songs are passableI don't exactly find myself humming them, a couple of them are slightly cloying, but I don't ever find myself cringing over them.  You have to make some adjustments to get a good grown-up work-out.  I exchange squats for the little boppy dance move they do and do a sun salutation every time Miss Erin explains where the class is going next.  My daughter loves the songs, the motions, and the frequent costume changes.  She laughs in delight when we run around chasing a butterfly during the warm-up.  I appreciate the inclusion of a boy in the class, but wish the class was more gender balanced so that it could be shared with mixed-gender groups of cousins without anyone feeling excluded.

I have zero experience with ballet, so I cant speak to the quality of ballet instruction, but this movie is definitely more about sparking a love of movement rather than any kind of technical training.  I think its perfect for the 3-4 age range, and good for some 2-year-olds and some 5-6-year-olds.  An early 2-year-old would probably just sit and watch rather than follow the instructions, and an older 5-year-old with a specific passion for ballet would not be satisfied.

Overall, Im happy that we purchased this video, and would be happy to purchase more videos produced by the same team.",1489536000,3,2335,4.6838235294117645

8654571,5,B00JY54ISW,"I really am greatly anticipating more of these videos...they are the best educational videos I have gotten for them. I have spent a really embarrassing amount of money...going broke...to give my children a very large choice of positive life/career paths. These are the best by far. My toddler(2) and her brother(3) can't be more interested. I would strongly recommend these dvds and would love more produced. They are perfect!!! It may not be direct hard core instruction but it opens the door enough that it fosters a love for aquiring MORE knowledge. They want to learn more by choice. It's a great gateway to education in general, it makes learning positive and exciting. Thank you soo much for this! Please make more!",1460505600,2,721,4.918032786885246
