1716616,1,B000067IZM,"22 minutes of footage from the aftermath of Sept. 11th. 22 minutes of dust, broken windows and debris. 22 minutes with NO narration. 22 minutes of wasted time, in my opinion.
The only people who would appreciate this dull and repetative documentary, are the people of New York. I say this only because they know the city well, and this DVD is simply 22 minutes of images of their shattered streets. No human drama or personal stories. No images of the attack. Again, just 22 minutes of the streets of New York in ruins.
BORING! Save your money, or better yet, get CNN's DVD on the events of Sept. 11th. A much better choice.",1030838400,8,624,4.482456140350878
1716617,2,B000067IZM,"Having lost a family memeber on one of the planes that hit the WTC, I was ready to completely be moved by this film. I rented it because I thought the silence of it would really show the true essence of the loss we've all endured; no mindless commentary on something that no human can ever really explain. However, this film, although somewhat interesting, just showed the buildings still left standing, ground zero and dust and debris. There was no depth or real sense of why we were seeing the same shots over and over. The ""extended version"" was more of the same, except it showed one of the towers going down. The point of the film was to show the first 24 hrs after the attack but that's simply all it does-it does not produce any emotion or show the real human impact. All those fire people were around and instead of following a team of them,etc instead we see the same empty blown out windows and dust. For the year of crying I have done for losing a family member on a flight, this film did not even evoke one tear.",1030579200,18,1024,4.310880829015544
1716618,1,B000067IZM,"I wished there had been commentary and some information in the video.  There is none.  It just seems like somebody bought a camcorder Sept. 10 and decided to try it out and market whatever they shot.
PLEASE UNDERSTAND- I mean no disrespect to the men and women who worked so hard during the 'first 24 hours' and long after that-
This video doesn't do them justice, IMHO.
I just wish this documentary was that- a documentary.  Instead it seems like a tourist who didn't know he had a mic on the camera.  The video WAS Artsy, but it didn't 'grab' me and transport me in the middle of it all like I thought it might.  I prefer the WTC video that the Discovery channel did.",1027555200,4,669,4.32
1716619,1,B000067IZM,I was anticipating a summary of the news reporting on the event as it unfolded. This is an unnarrated DVD with at best average video. Save your money!,1026864000,,150,4.392857142857143
1716620,5,B000067IZM,"I purchased this DVD based on the high marks and excellent reviews given by the Sundance Film Festival, Judge P. Naugle, Michael Jacobson, and David Germain of the Associated Press.  So glad I didn't miss this one.  The filmmaker's talent for detail and image choices are incredible.  There is no need for commentary or music - just hearing the filmmaker's breathing as he walks around the huge tire of the airplane found on a street corner is more than enough.  I don't think this film was made to ""entertain"" its audience. What I got from it was based on reality and integrity.  This film drew me in, making me feel as if I was the one walking down that street and holding that camera.  What an impact.",1026864000,10,704,4.503937007874016
1716621,1,B000067IZM,"I agree with what some of the other reviewers said.  I bought it expecting what I found but ALSO expected to see the footage of the planes crashing, the buildings collapsing, the smoke plume rushing through the streets and people running.  I wanted this to be a full capturing of the emotions I (and the whole country) felt that day that I could show my kids someday as a true historical record of a tragic event.  Sadly, what I got was about 28 minutes of people walking through dust and debris covered streets.  Save your money and wait for this one to be done right.",1025136000,41,569,4.390476190476191
1716622,1,B000067IZM,"When will people learn? Within a week of the WTC attack, more books than I could bear to see were published about it, every single person in America was on the TV talking about it, and there was nowhere to go to find solace and understanding. All we could see were people becoming either blinded by anger or overwhelmed with pain. And now that things are just starting to cool off (STARTING), they release a DVD like this?
First of all, products like this only bring up simplistic messages that we already know, so there's no need to buy it. The message is: 9-11 was a really, really bad day. WE KNOW. Skip the DVD.
Secondly, it is unethical, and in my opinion, outrageous to make ANY profit off of such a tragedy. It's like selling ""I survived the WTC collapse"" T-shirts. How can any decent human being accept such a disgusting capitalistic venture, even if it is ""just a documentary""?
Next we come to the problem of what this DVD offers you. Insight into the problem? No. Comforting words? No. Sublety? No. Art? No. It just gives you a chance to bring up all the pain and wretchedness one more time. Just a chance for you to pop the ol' DVD in your player one night so you can say to yourself, ""Yes, the world bites! That's right!"" This DVD is little more than a gateway to all the negative emotions that we should be trying to avoid! We can't just ignore it - but we shouldn't obsess with the problem, we should look beyond it, to the future!
I know that people will say, ""This is a documentary."" They'll try to pretend that it means something more than it does. But it doesn't! History will be written with or without a simple DVD. If you really, really want to remind yourself of pain and tragedy, just watch the news. If you want to remind yourself of SPECIFIC pain or tragedy, find an old newspaper, or go to the library. And if you need documentation on what the event was like (which I can only assume is because you are reading this review many years in the future, or you are suffering from amnesia) then you can find it completely for free on the internet.
If you feel the need to express your patriotism (or just compassion for human beings), then there are better ways to do it. I know this probably isn't a helpful review, but I had to get this off my chest.",1024704000,23,2273,4.338028169014085
1716623,5,B000067IZM,"This piece is very effective, doubly so because it doesn't attempt to editorialize...we don't have narrators reading portentous hyperbolic melodramatic drivel, no manipulative music trying to tell us how to feel...what we have are stark, live-audio-from-the-site images, covering the first 24 hours after the explosion.  The confusion, the eerie silence, the destruction...the images do the talking, not self-involved filmmakers...it all builds to a solitary firefighter, searching for survivors, standing on a huge pile of rubble, calling out ""is anybody there"", only to be answered in silence.  That image, disturbing in both its simplicity and the horror it speaks volumes about, was a brilliant editorial choice as a conclusion...no music or editorializing needed, thank you.  This is a historical document, pure and simple.",1023840000,31,828,5.770491803278689
1716624,4,B000067IZM,"As a police officer, this hits too close to home... The documentry is unbelievable. You are offered a first person view of all the events as they happen, and hear sounds that will haunt your mind.  You get to see what true bravery is about and get a glimse of some of the unselfishness men of my profession, as well as firefighters display everyday.  There is no background music and no narration which fits in perfectly..This is a must for all americans so that the worst tradegy in most peoples lifetime never is forgotten..",1023753600,10,526,4.585106382978723
1716650,5,B000067IZM,"You see, this documentary does something that most network news channels are afraid to explore... it displays raw film with raw audio as recorded on-scene in real-time.  No sugar-coated interpretations, although the average television viewer might find it difficult to think for themselves; to explore their own thoughts in the chilling silence.  Around the city during and after the WTC event, you hear the planes, the crowds, the firefighters, the police, the sirens, car alarms, screams, footsteps, and... the silence.  No voice-over commentators, no colorful on-screen titles, nothing but it.",1072656000,13,596,5.6
1716651,2,B000067IZM,"The events of September 11, 2001 are long gone. When I first heard about this tape and began to watch it I expected a moving documentary that would give further insight on that tragedy. I was disappointed. An important element was missing from the tape and that element was human intereaction.
  WTC:The first 24 Hours shows footage of the World Trade Center during the aftermath of its collapse. Your eyes along with the cameraman will witness a ball of flame encompassing the building. Then you wade through the debris and see police, paramedics and firemen begin the tasks of trying to put things back in order. Your eyes are assaulted by the surrounding devestation.
  The shots of the collapse and workers are fine but they are just that;random shots. The lack of narration through the printed or oral word makes it difficult to grasp how one photo relates to the other. As the camera moved from one spot to another you would wonder just where you were in the center.
  If you are looking for raw footage of the the WTC collapse then this is an excellent film. If you desire more interpretation of what happened and want to focus on the men and women who worked through the tragedy, I would recommend that you try some other video.",1052438400,7,1236,4.621004566210046
1716652,2,B000067IZM,"I bought this dvd..I was hoping for a little more I guess..The dvd was less than one hour..it showed little more than fireman walking around in soot..I wasn't looking for gory details but a little more on the human side would have been good. I watched the ""enhanced"" version hoping to see more..I have seen better videos on nightly news channels. My advise is save your money and look elsewhere..the title is true..first 24 hours..but if you remember there was no power and no people..this is what you see.",1047081600,,506,4.696629213483146
1716653,5,B000067IZM,"On 9/11, two planes crashed into the WTC.  This film is about the aftermath of the first 24 hours after the attacks.  There are three features.  And each one is great.  Here they are:
Expanded Version:  A Timeline
The first images in the expanded version of the ""First 24 Hours"" show the gaping hole in the World Trade Center's North Tower, caused by the impact of American Airlines Flight 11.  At (:06 a.m., a giant fireball climbs up the side of the North Tower, an explosion resulting from the collision of United Flight 175 into the South Tower.  The next images show the South Tower, close up and shourouded in smoke, before breaking apart at 10:05 P.M.  The final images are of the North Tower, at 10:28 a.m, crumbling and disappearing for view, and moments later the cloud of smoke drifting out of frame, leaving a clear blue sky.  Then, you see the aftermath of the collapse for 24 hours.  28 minutes.
Original Version
The original version of ""The First 24 Hours"" was made as a raw reflection of ""ground zero"" in the wake of the World Trade Center collapse.  This film was expanded into a longer documentary, which begis with the footage of the twin towers.  The original version of ""The First 24 Hours"" had it's premier as an official selection of the Sundance Film Festival 2002.  11 minutes.

This documentarie's scenes were borrowed for creationg 9/11. (See ""9/11: The Filmakers Commerative Edition"")  I give it five stars.  It is one of the best 9/11 documentaries ever made.  So get it.  You shouldn't be sorry.",1036195200,10,1835,4.765079365079365
1716654,4,B000067IZM,"This is raw footage- pure and simple. From the horrifying spectacle of the North Tower falling out of the opening frames of the full length document to the almost banal sounds of talking heads on a hidden television as the scene pans through a dust covered Burger King, the film emphasizes the rawness of the moment.
The soundtrack is clanking metal, fireman's locator signals, blowing papers, and desperate digging. The cameraman thoroughly covered the area- from the Financial center to the perimeters of Ground Zero. Perhaps a decade from now, its frames will be carefully examined for more evidence and understanding about this awful event. With all the hype and music stripped away, this reminds us of the core of it all, Ground Zero when it was Ground Zero. Let us never forget.",1033603200,8,784,4.902255639097745
1716655,2,B000067IZM,"If I had remembered to read reviews on [an online internet store] before I bought this, I would have saved my money.  There is zero human aspect here, devoid of voices or people.  This video is really just a camera panning across building fronts, broken windows and ground debris after it was all over and no one was around.  No chronology, no sensible order of footage.  The only human contact is when the cameraman walks past a group of firemen, but they are just sort of standing around their firetrucks.  As a viewer I din't feel I was participating, as a matter of fact I felt disconnected.  Be aware that 90% of this footage is just panning the streets hours later and the next day.  Absolutely silent with no one on the street.  The helpless fear we felt that day is not expressed.  This DVD is not worthwhile.",1032393600,21,817,4.466216216216216
1716656,2,B000067IZM,"Although the opening segment of this film shows a couple of jumpers and one of the towers down, the vast majority of this is just shots of the devastation and the beginnings of the rescue and clean-up with no music or narration of any kind.  The filmmakers may have thought both of those intrusive(and in some 9/11 videos they have been) but the absence of both here made this rather cold and unemotional, almost 9/11 as work of art.  There is nothing here about what 9/11 did to people.",1032307200,6,487,4.46067415730337
1716657,1,B000067IZM,"This DVD is essentially a collage of various clips of fottage shot around Ground Zero during the first 24 hours. The footage is OK, but only 30 minutes! They call this a documentary, but it is just raw footage spliced together! I would NOT recommedn this as you can get just as good footage in several of the other real documentaries.",1032220800,7,334,4.491803278688525
1716658,4,B000067IZM,"This documentary does a very good job of giving the viewer a street-level view of Ground Zero and the surrounding areas hours after the tragic events of September 11th.  The images in this video are some that I have never seen before, and I appreciated the filmmakers non-use of narrative or background music which would have only interfered with the haunting images and the first-person view that the video reflects.",1031011200,3,417,4.957142857142857

From there a camera troops around town in the dust (why so much unburned paper?) and encounters a burned up car park (WHY?). There are no answers here and very little sound as a camera walks around recording experiences following the towers collapse. Surreal.",1481760000,,326,4.637931034482759

7963210,3,B000067IZM,"I would have given it two stars, or even only one star, but I was struck by the silence of the city in the aftermath of the disaster.  The evening and night footage is positively eerie.  Otherwise, the film was short and unimpressive.  You can find similar things online for free.",1324684800,,280,4.450980392156863
7963211,3,B000067IZM,"No one knew what happened on that first day,... how or why the towers came down. This video can be used for any view, but I find it wanting. It is not enough to see the downed buildings. The government lies, and what that means to the foundations of truth was the greater loss.",1167955200,,277,4.148148148148148
7963212,5,B000067IZM,"When I saw this film, it was several years after 9/11.  Yet after the first camera still that shows first a blazing tower, a plane slamming into the second tower, the towers fall, then clear blue sky, I began to cry uncontrollably.  What happened in that small camera angle and it's effect on NY city and the nation was powerfully conveyed in that single image sped up over time.  The sheer guts and determination of the cameraman (in this case the director, editor and film man, Sauret) is incredible.  We see footage of what happened in the hours after that horrible event when most of us were asleep (or grappling with sleep Iike I did after living through that day in NYC).  Sauret climbs in spaces no one else dare go-abandoned buildings with waist deep debris and in total darkness.  You won't see Nicolas Cage or hear a popular soundtrack along with this film.  There is no music or commentary and the actors are the brave and selfless firefighters, rescue people and regular citizens of NYC who serviced those that volunteered their lives in the aftermath of this tragedy.  This film is a somber reminder of that day, which has been shown so many times by polished and glitzy Hollywood style since.  We forget the ash-covered zombies that walked from the towers home and the horror of realizing our safety was compromised and that our world would never again be the same.  In a subtle and unique way, this film commemorates that loss of innocense and shows us what really transpired ""down there"" in the hours after the planes hit.",1165017600,,1538,4.662962962962963
7963213,2,B000067IZM,"Some documentaries serve great purposes and others simply fill in monetary voids. ""The First 24 Hours"" is a disappointment as a film, recording what is said to be the first ""24 hours"" after this horrific incident.  The expanded version is less than  hour.  We see the North tower smoking and then an off camera view of the flames of the second tower being hit.  The rest of the film is a collection of montages of street scenes littered with debris, dust, papers, cars and misery.  There are no spoken words, there is no music, there is nothing more than several cut views of the surrounding devastation. It would have been historically correct to try to film these terrible scenes in an artistic manner rather than a news film view.  No matter.  There are several other films that portray what really happened on that terrible day.

I highly recommend ""In Memoriam, New York City, 9/11/2001"" and ""9/11 - The Filmmaker's Commemorative Edition"".  Nothing else deserves the respect of those that lost their lives that day or the families that will continue to mourn.",1129852800,6,1064,4.802197802197802
7963214,3,B000067IZM,"This is a good film about the aftermath of the WTC collapse. It was not nearly as bad as some reviewers have made it out to be. The audio and video quality of the material is great. Speaking for myself, I actually liked the fact that this particular 9/11 film had no commentary & music. What you see is what you get, and unfortunately, this video is in the like-it-or-leave-it catagory. This program is definetly not for everybody. If you can't stand watching a real-life caught-on-tape video without narration & music, then you will not like WTC - First 24 Hours. As for me, my main complaint about the film is that it wasn't long enough. The film is just 47 minutes and should've been longer and had more footage of the actual attacks themselves. Oh, well, it was still a decent film. In the very first scene, you get to see the explosion of the second plane crashing into the South Tower, and you see two people jumping from the North Tower on the right side of the screen. Then it shows both towers collapsing from the same camera angle. Then from there, it's nonstop footage of the aftermath. You'll see how Manhatten was transformed into a nuclear winter; buildings fluttered with debris, the streets caked in white ashes and paper, damaged buildings, crushed cars & trucks, and 3 billion pounds of concrete, rubble, and steel covering the WTC site.

If you're expecting a historical document about the actual attacks themselves, then don't watch WTC - First 24 Hours. In Memoriam - New York City - 9/11/01 is the one that you would want to see. It shows footage of the attacks, people jumping, interviews, the pandemonium, the collapse, and the aftermath.

WTC - First 24 Hours doesn't document the actual attacks themselves, but rather, the aftermath. The footage speaks for itself.",1110240000,18,1790,4.715654952076678
7963215,4,B000067IZM,"The Ground Zero Footage is amazing & the way it was shot is interesting, wide angles & slow pans make this a unique video.

The video also has exclusive incredible fire footage. I highly recommend both videos.",1099353600,7,409,4.857142857142857
