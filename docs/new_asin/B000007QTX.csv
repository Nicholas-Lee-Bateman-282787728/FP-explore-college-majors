1197112,4,B000007QTX,"From start to finish, Contamination is a good sci-fi movie that some people claim is an Alien rip-off.  In a way it is with stomachs exploding on screen that is closely familiar with the scene in Alien when an alien popped out of John Hurt's stomach.  Along with an excellent Goblin score, Contamination is very suspensful.  Here is the plot.
A crew spots a ship on the shore of NY that seems deserted (very similar to Zombie which was filmed in NY also).  A local lieutenant along with a scientist and associates search through the ship that seems empty until they spot corpses of the people on board.  What seems weird is that all the men have been found dead, but with their bodies torn apart.  Then, they spot a couple of green eggs and one that is heated up.  One of the men picks up the egg and it suddenly explodes with debris hitting all of the men except the lieutenant.  All of a sudden, they are all torn apart.
A female military scientist then gets in the act, along with the lieutenant that survived on the ship.  They discover, after facing off with guardsmen who protect another group of eggs and sacrificing their lives in front of the crowd, two things:  these eggs must be from outer space, and why do they come in boxes labeled coffee?
While figuring the mess out, the scientist remembers an astronaut who returned from an expedition claming that there were green eggs and some bright light.  She goes to visit the poor geezer who is now an alcoholic living in pity.  She discusses the discovery of green eggs he discovered during the expedition.  He explains that he and his partner traveled to mars and saw eggs.  Then, a ball of light just gets bigger with his partner, Hamilton, just staring.  From there, the astronaut, scientist and the lieutenant head to South America to explore the connection with these eggs and coffee with some tragic results.
As stated earlier, this is a good movie, but it has its faults.  First of all, the plot is confusing, but it is not a surprise that it's from an Italian movie which is notorious for having lots of gore, but a plot that doesn't make any sense.  The reason for the eggs being on Earth doesn't make sense.  Second of all is the lieutenant.  At first when we get to know him, he is serious and takes his work seriously.  When the movie moves along, he becomes a horrible-like gigolo who tries to make a move on the female lead. It makes him look awful and unfortunately, his embarrassment ends with him getting killed.  Third and final is the alien.  It looks like an alien you would see in a 50's sci-fi bomb.  It isn't really scary but it makes you pay attention to it.
Other than the faults, it is a good movie with a pounding Goblin score enhanced by Dolby Digital 5.1 and a good performance by Ian McCulloch.  It is a good movie for anybody interested in sci-fi and Italian horror.",1066089600,,2856,4.469111969111969
1197113,4,B000007QTX,"This is the only film I've seen of Luigi Cozzi's, and it's not too shabby.  Silly and moronic to be sure, but we're talking about Italian gross out flicks here.  The Italians loved to try and cash in on whatever was big in America at the time.  Italian directors did westerns in the 70s, along with adult films, zombie films(because of Romero's success), crime and sword and sorcery films in the early 80s.  Considering these films are so low budget, they have to try and give you something you can't find in Hollywood pictures, and that ""something"" as you may already know is GORE.  Amidst the slew of zombie/cannibal flicks that came flying out of Italy comes Contamination-an imitator of the hit, Alien.  Cozzi isn't really into horror films, so decided to delve into his favorite genre, sci-fi.  Contamination is your basic Italian horror formula only with a sci-fi theme this time around.  We get an abandoned boat sailing into New York harbor(sound familiar?) carrying some eggs that spit out acid and make peoples' chests explode(don't ask).  This takes our cast of characters on that journey down south(sound familiar?) to solve the mystery.  Starring Ian McCulloch-a good actor who always gets suckered into doing these kinds of films-as our butt kicking hero, this film will make you puke in your pants and do a funky little dance as you watch exploding chests(and mice) and a man eating alien cyclops!  This was particulary scary for me coz I was attacked by a cyclops once in the Bahamas.  Certainly not the best import from Italy, but I've seen alot worse(see Bruno Mattei).",1062374400,,1587,4.837037037037037
1197114,3,B000007QTX,"Finally this long neglected SF film appears on DVD: withdrawn some 20 years ago in Britain during the 'Video Nasty' witchhunt and unavailable in any form since, 'Contamination' is a film full of charm despite its highly derivative nature. The most obvious comparison is with 'Alien' of course but as the director himself points out in a lovely interview that is the best of the extras on this disc, his aim with the film was to pay homage to 50s American SF pictures.  What a nice chap Luigi Cozzi clearly is - ready to admit his debts to other SF, clearly in love with the genre and unashamedly open about his derivative approach
References to 'Invaders From Mars' and 'Quatermass 2' abound: the Martian Cyclops monster is a corker, refreshingly unrealistic and like the director charmingly unsophisticated and direct.
The gore effects remain quite shocking but are  relatively few and far between - most descriptions of this movie indicate that someone's chest bursts apart every ten minutes or so, but all such descriptions are overexaggerated. Why this film remains banned in the UK after so long is a mystery to me...
The main problem with the film is its pacing - the middle of the film does lack suspense and imagination, some scenes crawling along when the injection of original ideas (unfortunately the lovely Cozzi doesn't have many of his own, apart from the blatant blood and guts) would have upped the adrenalin.
The picture on the DVD is very good indeed and the music by Goblin is of course excellent, despite the absence of Claudio Simonetti: only one gripe here, Cozzi under-uses the score which is apparent when one owns the superbly remastered cinevox CD.
If you love cheap pulp SF, you have to get yourself this unoriginal but fun film that will take you back to your childhood experiences of lurid science fiction at its most potent.",1046908800,,1854,4.808777429467084

Low budget, terrible acting and terrible plot. There's absolutely no conflict in this movie until the last 15 minutes. I had no idea where the plot was going or why.

People reference the gore like it something amazing - its pretty boring and does nothing for the movie.

One positive: the soundtrack by ""Goblin"" was pretty cool and fit the time period, but overall I would've been happier not seeing this one. Waste of time.",1359158400,,544,4.474747474747475

1197120,4,B000007QTX,"This film was fast paced and gory for about the first half hour.  However, the pace then slows dramatically and it began to get a little boring.  Not much happens then until the climax of the film.  In fact, the gore that was shown during that first half hour (a gore sequence on a ship and another gore sequence that takes place in a warehouse) ceases to exist until the climax; there's no more gore until the ending portions of the film.  Towards the end, a cyclops creature is revealed to be the creator of the eggs; he's got some hypnotic powers and just sits there and doesn't move except for his tentacles that he uses to eat people.  The film also has very good soundtracks, and I like that cyclops creature.  I'm still giving it four stars because I really liked the first half hour and the climax.  It's too bad that the middle portion of the film isn't better because then this film would've been a classic. Perhaps the reason why it slows down after the first half hour is because the director wanted to build some suspense, along with some character development and a story as they attempt to find the rest of those alien eggs. At times, (like the sequence when they discover the alien eggs by searching the ship in the dark with Goblin's effective soundtracks) it does have a good atmospheric quality to it. There's no nudity in the film, and I liked its 80s style of filmmaking.

The quality is sharp and brightness is fine. The colors are a little faded, and it needs some improvement with contrast. Overall, it looks good but doesn't look quite as good as other films I've seen from Blue Underground. The menu screen has some animation, and you get some good extras.",1329609600,,1682,4.491803278688525
1197121,2,B000007QTX,"A strange, unmanned Caribbean ship approaches a New York harbor and is quarantined.  Upon investigation, members of the crew are found ""ripped apart"" to various degrees, one of whom evidently appeared to have exploded like a small bomb was inside his chest.  They also find a huge shipment of coffee bean boxes filled with over-sized avocado-like egg things that are bioluminescent, pulsating, somewhat translucent and covered in green ooze.  These eggs should clearly come with a warning label indicating that handling them results in their detonation, spraying you with acid, and somehow causing your chest to explode.  These ""eggs"" turn out to be more than just eggs and--dun, dun, duuuuuuuun--of alien origin.

 Our investigators discover a warehouse full of them in the Bronx.  They connect the dots to an international conspiracy which includes NASA and the Colombian coffee industry.  This may sound exciting, but after the first 20 minutes (which were delightfully gore-tastic) this movie really slows down to a disinteresting pace where scenes devoid of action are needlessly dragged out.  Clearly this flick was made to prey on sci-fi fans left hungry for more since the release of Alien, which also had chest-burst-inducing, extraterrestrial, acidic, slimy eggs.  What a co-inky-dink, right?

 The concepts are conveyed poorly and the three portions of the movie (the first 20 minutes, the next hour, and the last 20 minutes) each included a new plot element which linked poorly, if at all, to the others.  The makers of this atrocious flick clearly had no idea what they were doing and forced out this movie with all the grace of passing a kidney stone.

1197125,3,B000007QTX,"Another mini budgeted Italian ""Alien"" clone...this one is fun though. A large freight ship is found floating empty, but upon investigation the mutilated bodies of many crew members are found aboard. No-one can work out the cause of their deaths except to say that it seems like the bodies exploded from the inside -  until (in a hilarious and unexpected scene) the same gruesome fate suddenly starts to befall members of the search team who get to close to the innocuous looking green pods that make up the ship's cargo: they explode in a slow motion fountain of blood and organs while other staff members look on in horror! What is the cargo that caused such horror and where did it come from? That's the plot for the remainder of the film.

Although the film is set on earth with no space travel involved, the similarities to ""Alien"" are too obvious to ignore. First of all, the death scenes involve people's chests exploding, plus the source of the infection is the same (green pods/eggs) and finally, there is a extra-terrestrial connection to the problem...but I'll leave it at that for people who haven't seen the film. What I enjoyed was the fairly simple plot, which ran just long enough to set up the leads required for the cast to track down the source of the menace, some enjoyable set pieces such as the ""bathroom menace"" and the bonkers climax, and finally the acting isn't bad either, despite the usual tacked on English dub. The music and sound effects are also pretty good, a spooky breathing/whistling noise is played a lot over shots of the eggs and it adds to the atmosphere quite well.

Once banned as a ""video nasty"" in the UK, I really can't imagine any viewer being traumatized by the exploding death scenes...the actors clearly have strapped-on fake chests which stick out like huge barrels on their bodies! But it's nice to see it out on DVD, as it works as a fun little sci-fi shocker if you don't have high expectations.",1255392000,,1947,4.65406976744186
1197126,3,B000007QTX,"I don't know about you, but I always get a kick out of these Italian knock-offs of successful American science fiction films.

Naturally, Contamination (or Alien Contamination, as it was called in the USA) doesn't even begin to compare with Aliens, but it is worth viewing - if you're a fan of the genre, at least.  I think it's safe to say that those who care nothing about low-budget science fiction and horror films will not enjoy this film at all, and those without the stomach for gore should also stay away.  The film basically has just one gory effect, but it's a pretty good one and is used on a number of occasions.  Gorehounds like me, of course, will revel in the ""he done blowed up real good"" moments.

Contamination opens with a cargo ship barreling into New York Harbor, its crew unwilling or unable to respond to radio calls.  Once authorities corral the thing and pull it in, the mystery of the missing crew is solved - they're all very dead, their bodies seemingly ripped open from the inside.  Of the three men sent in to explore the ship, only local cop Tony Aris (Marino Mase) comes back out alive.  Having found a bunch of strange egg-like things in the ship's hold, the other two made the mistake of picking one up - quickly demonstrating to Aris the awful, immediate, and painful way in which everyone on board the ship must surely have died.  That's more than enough reason for the government to quarantine the entire area and send in Colonel Stella Holmes (Louise Marleau) to figure out what the heck is going on.

Tests soon reveal the deadly acidic nature of the ""eggs,"" as well as the fact that they are not terrestrial in origin.  So where did they come from?  As it so happens, Commander Ian Hubbard (Ian McCulloch) had described finding the same sorts of objects in a Martian cave he explored on a recent manned mission to the Red Planet.  No one believed him, though - until now.  He reluctantly joins Holmes and Aris as they follow the deadly cargo's trail back to a coffee warehouse in Colombia, where all things are revealed.

Not surprisingly, Contamination has its share of weaknesses.  Special effects, apart from your general lab design details, aren't among them.  Sure, the dark-ish nature of the print sometimes makes it hard to fully enjoy the sight of people exploding from the inside out, but writer/director Luigi Cozzi's commitment to quality gore is obvious.  The storyline, though, is rather weak, the acting is not of the highest caliber, and you have to slog through several sections of painfully boring exposition on your way to the end.

I should also mention the fact that there are basically two versions of this film.  Unfortunately, I was only able to find the American version (released as Alien Contamination), which has a run time of some 84 minutes.  The original film runs a full 95 minutes, so you'll definitely want to pick up that full-length version if at all possible. Why would they cut a full ten minutes out of this film, you ask?  It almost surely stems from the fact that the UK's infamous Video Recordings Act originally led to Contamination being branded a ""video nasty,"" effectively banning it at the time.  (It has since been released in the UK with a 15 certificate.)  Apparently, slow-motion shots of characters exploding were just too extreme for the mother hens clucking over the British Isles.",1206835200,3,3873,5.1485623003194885

1197128,2,B000007QTX,"Others have given long and involved plot synopsis, so I won't bore you with yet another one.  Instead I will sum up:

Stock footage of a boat entering harbor with people in a helicopter having a badly dubbed conversation that is comically presumptious.  Then they investigate the ship to find gory corpses that have exploded from the inside, and a bunch of giant pulsating avacados in coffee boxes.  One of the avacados explodes and so does anyone near it.  So of course the US government sends in a woman with no common sense to investigate.  Because she has no sense and since this is a top secret issue, she takes with her a street cop and an unemployed alcoholic astronaut on their verbal promise that they will keep quiet.  To show just how serious these avacados are... she blows up a mouse and then they head to South America to find the source of the exploding Avacados of death.

The plot is... well... what to say... laughable and told through forced narrative dialogue.  The acting is over the top, and the characters behaviour is completely illogical... I won't even get into the Martian Headlight of Death.  What I will say is that this movie is perfect for a film class to overdub, or for MST3K.  Or for a night with a lot of beer and popcorn and a good group of friends to laugh with.  I wouldn't put this at the top of the bad but amusing horror film list, but it's on there... somewhere.

1197129,2,B000007QTX,"Contamination (Luigi Cozzi, 1980)

Not even that great bastion of bad acting, Ian McCulloch (Zombie), can save this schlockfest from B-movie auteur Luigi Cozzi. McCulloch, who doesn't actually show up until halfway through the film despite being one of the main characters, plays Ian Hubbard, a retired astronaut who was part of a Mars mission during which his partner was killed and, everyone seems to assume, he went utterly mad. Skipping back to the opening half of the film, the things Hubbard reported having seen on Mars--strange green eggs deadly to humans--have found their way to Earth, and are uncovered during a raid on a smugglers' ship. Tony (Marino Mase), the only surviving member of the police squad who raided the ship, teams up with Stella Holmes (Louise Marleau), a military scientist who also recruits Hubbard, and the three of them are off to stop the evil alien conspiracy!

Umm, yeah, something like that. It's an Italian gore flick, the plot isn't important. The pace is. The gore is. The effects are. Unfortunately, Cozzi manages to blow the pace at every conceivable turn, the gore isn't around nearly enough, and the effects, especially in the Evil Mastermind(tm), are unintentionally hilarious. This is probably a good one to watch at a party while very drunk, but if you're looking to expand your gore-film horizons, this one should be pretty low on your list. * ",1180137600,3,1392,4.965665236051502
1197130,2,B000007QTX,"Once you've made the ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" ""The Thing"" and ""Aliens"" comparisons -- you know, the whole song and dance where aliens enslave the human race popular during the Cold War paranoia craze -- there's really little else to stick around for ... unless you get a charge out of Giallo-inspired, slo-mo, car-crash-intense pneumatic gore, here represented by abdomens exploding in rich, ruby fury, entrails outstretched and flapping like party whistles. There's a heaping helping of these blowouts, fueled by alien eggs that spurt killer puke-colored fluid when heated (or whenever it's convenient), sprinkled throughout this b-minus level sci-fi soaper. There's even a climax featuring ""The Cyclops,"" an oozing alien who's a cross between Medusa, Audrey II and Aloysius Snuffleupagus and had a cameo years later on an episode of ""Power Rangers"" in which it spoke with a Brooklyn dialect, if I remember correctly. However, if you have ears or, god forbid, you can read subtitles, you're in a for a world of pain: director Luigi Cozzi, whose next venture was ""Hercules,"" is no better at piecing together a script than a pimply, ""TRL"" Tivo-ing, Wii-drenched teen is at making a latte at Starsucks.

Never mind that the actors all look like they need a good scrubbing; I actually felt like I was watching a dubbed movie because the mannerisms didn't match the words, and these skill-deficient oafs alternate between comatose and manic episodes, with little in between and ill-conceived utterances like ""Help! Let me out! There's an egg!"" ""What killed those men certainly wasn't coffee"" and ""You couldn't get it up, even if you had a crane"" make the brain reel and seem more like poor translations from Italian than comic relief. Even the impetus for humanity's demise, the alien eggs smuggled back to Earth by an astronaut who becomes a puppet of the Martians, isn't sufficiently explained. We know that the astronaut-symbiote who faked his own death re-emerges two years after the expedition to plant the eggs in New York's sewers. How the eggs will go from the sewers to conquer the populace Cozzi never even attempts to explain. But wait, let me back up because the female colonel, who a police lieutenant goes from calling ""sir"" to trying to get in the sack at the most inopportune times, assures the viewing audience that these aren't eggs, but a virus, then quickly contradicts herself by saying the opposite. And for all the care with which the eggs are handled at first, complete with high-tech hamster-cage incubation boxes and toxin-deflecting rainslickers, this same colonel, sans any protective garb, gets close enough to a batch of ""eggs"" that she could spoon herself out a sample. Which she should have because a later scene where someone tries to kill her by locking her in a bathroom with an egg combines the worst murder attempt with the worst bid for self-preservation (just cover the damn thing with a towel!) ever captured on film.",1175040000,3,2962,5.008113590263692

Do Italians just have this stereotype of New York/American males calling women chick? Men get respect by slapping women? You can slap a superior officer (or anyone) and that's OK. You can make yourself a NY officer by placing a piece of tape with ""NY"" written with a Sharpie on a mil. cap.

Upon watching this film I realized that I had bought a very mediocre/boring film. Don't get me wrong, Contamination isn't awful, it's just dull. It's one of those films which doesn't warrant repeated viewings.

On the plus side, as a fan of low budget films, I must give Luigi credit for the filmic aspects. He knows how to cover a scene with the camera and is able to light some fairly cheesy looking sets to maximum advantage. However he lacks the 'artisitc' vituosity of other great ""low budget"" Italian directors such as Sergio Martino, who could not only construct a fairly tight picture but also inject some kind of mood or atmosphere.

A runaway freighter is boarded and found to contain a gruesomely dead crew and boxes marked coffee that contain large avocado-like pods or eggs.  These eggs explode on maturity and any mammalian life nearby will explode seconds later.  Research shows the eggs to be non-terrestrial in nature.  A chance landing by alien spores is ruled out and the failed Mars mission is suspected.
The surviving astronaut from the Mars mission is now a drunk.  He had claimed to have seen avocado-like eggs on Mars but the rest of the crew denied his claims.  With his help the coffee shipment is tracked to a plantation in South America and the action moves there.
It turns out that the Mars crew mate is not dead.  He is alive and running the operation to destroy all human life.  He is under the control of a being known as the Cyclops.  He brought a Cyclops spore back from Mars where he was hypnotized.  After some fun scenes the heroes triumph in the end and the menace from Mars is ended.
Despite the feeling of wrongness that foreign films in English often have, this is actually well above the usual monster shlock movie.

The crew is dead, literlly torn apart by some unknown force, and the ship's cargo is not coffee, but groaning, glowing eggs that make people explode whenever contact with the slimy green filling is made.  Writer/director 'Lewis Coates' (aka Luigi Cozzi) crafts an incomprehensible story of alien invasion (or simple destruction, the exact goal is never made clear) in this most famous (or infamous) Italian cash-in on Alien.  In the to be expected excellent supplements (the disc is from Blue Underground, so special things are almost a matter of routine) Cozzi comes across as a real classic sci-fi geek.  Too bad that love didn't infuse his script or direction.  While the movie is entertaining, it is mostly for the wrong reasons, and Cozzi fumbles chances for suspense during key moments in the film (i.e. having the female lead trapped in a bathroom with an alien egg) by dragging the scenes out until they become ludicrous.  Nonetheless, fans of this long gone era of movie making (late seventies/early eighties low budget schlock cinema) will find something to enjoy in the movie.  I did.",1081296000,7,1164,5.0
1197137,4,B000007QTX,"""Contamination"" is one of those low budget Italian science fiction potboilers that provide countless hours of fun. There's something deeply nostalgic about these films for me; I spent whole evenings watching this pap on cable television back in the mid 1980s. There was nothing like coming home in the summer, ordering a pizza, and spending all night with these delicacies. I guess things haven't changed too much since I am still watching them thanks to the DVD revolution. That these movies look and sound better now than they did when they first came out is one of those technological marvels that stagger the mind. Thanks go to Bill Lustig and the folks at Blue Underground for taking the time to release ""Contamination"" with a plethora of extras coupled with a great audio and video presentation. If you have never sampled the wonders of Italian schlock films, this is a great place to start. ""Contamination,"" in case you haven't guessed, is a shameless rip off of Ridley Scott's classic science fiction gorefest ""Alien."" But don't expect to see Sigourney Weaver or John Hurt appear anywhere near this cheesy little number.
Eggs. ""Contamination"" deals primarily with eggs. An abandoned ship sails into New York harbor loaded with weird, pulsating pods the size of basketballs. When the authorities attempt to investigate this strange ship, a bunch of people die horribly when the eggs blow up and spray them with a viscous goo. The hapless souls coated with explosive yolk simply don't keel over and die in a nice, peaceful manner, though. Nope, they explode in ultra slow motion, with their chests and throats opening up with a bang. Obviously, the origins of these objects represent a significant threat to the human race, so the government quickly gets involved in the whole affair. Scientists quickly learn the pods are not of this world, a discovery that brings up a recollection of a disastrous trip to Mars some years before. In an effort to discover what the heck is going on, the government agents, headed up by sexy Colonel Stella Holmes (Louise Marleau), track down an astronaut who survived the ill-fated mission. With an annoying New York cop in tow, Holmes must work fast if she is to save humanity from a fate with decidedly alien implications. Yay!
The emotionally destroyed astronaut, Commander Ian Hubbard (Ian McCulloch of ""Zombie"" fame), just cannot bring himself to cast his mind back to that horrible time on the red planet. Eventually he does, of course, and in the process recalls a cave filled with millions of pulsating pods and a light as bright as the sun. What does it all mean? Not much at first. Then we discover that some lunk head Hubbard knows only too well managed to bring back the pods, and something else much more dangerous, to earth. The exploding eggs are the central linchpin in a plot to conquer the world. It is up to the psychologically unbalanced Hubbard, the mouthy cop, and Colonel Holmes to thwart this dastardly deed before people start blowing up on a regular basis. Their mission takes them around the world in search of a coffee magnate who smuggles the eggs in wooden boxes filled with beans. All the while, Hubbard's flashbacks about the mysterious cave on Mars reveal more and more clues about what is occurring here on planet earth. Can our heroes stop this nefarious plot before it gets underway? Can Hubbard overcome his difficulties and save the world? Will that cop ever shut up? These questions, and many more unimportant ones, will find resolution by the end of ""Contamination.""
The movie isn't a masterwork of cinema, even for an entry in the low budget Italian horror-science fiction genre, but it does have its moments. Ian McCulloch is always fun to watch in these types of movies, and he does a good job in the role of the horrified Hubbard. The rest of the cast, well, let's just say the word ""forgettable"" applies on more than one occasion. At least the gore keeps you on your toes; director Luigi Cozzi wisely spaces out the gruesome death scenes throughout the film, which greatly helps the pacing in an otherwise slow film. Moreover, the effects, from the grue to the pulsating eggs, are well done considering the ultra low budget. Throw in some scenic shots from different locales along with a pounding score from Goblin, and you have the makings of an entertaining little shocker. And let's face it; we all could use more exploding torsos and melting heads to help us get through the day. ""Contamination"" gives us all of that and not much more. Cozzi is no Sergio Leone, but he doesn't need to be when making a zero cost science fiction puker.
The extras included on the disc are as good as they are surprising for such an obscure film. You get trailers, of course, but you also get so much more. Blue Underground got Cozzi to do an interview about the film, an interview that sheds light on many aspects of the film. With all of the framed 1950's movie posters on the wall behind the director during the interview, it is obvious he likes classic science fiction films. Indeed, Cozzi emphasizes his love for old science fiction and how the genre inspired him to lens ""Contamination."" Add in a grainy looking featurette made during the filming of the movie and some poster stills, and you have yourself a very nice DVD worth purchasing. Give Cozzi's film a shot if you like your sci-fi gooey and cheap. If not, you can always rent ""Alien"" again.",1077408000,6,5424,4.7712765957446805

It has some neat extras such as an interview with the infamous director of the film himself, although it's subtitled since he is speaking Italian the whole time. But the movie itself is remastered well and you can see details that you could not make out in previously said copies. One example would be when Stella and Tony are taken to the Cyclops monster and you can see the entire monster in noticeable clarity.

7905250,2,B000007QTX,"This film had the potential to be lots of gorey fun, but the filmmakers fumbled.  The plot itself seems like an interesting enough springboard to launch the sort of b-movie schlock fans like myself have come to appreciate out of 70s Italian horror/exploitation. But nothing comes of it. You get these long drawn out scenes peppered by bits of the (decent) Goblin soundtrack that move the film along at a glacial pace. And they focus on all the wrong bits; all the unexciting parts of the story get tons of unnecessary screen time, while the interesting parts get rushed.

7905251,4,B000007QTX,"Wow! Director Luigi Cozzi did a darn good take off on ""ALIEN"" This film has a non-stop roller-coaster ride of gore. A ship is found floating in the New York Harbor (""ZOMBIE"" anyone) and the entire crew has been slaughtered. The only cargo on board is a huge stockpile of Alien-type eggs. When they hatch, anyone holding one explodes from the inside out blasting the screen with an unbelievable amount of gore. Turns out the Alien-type eggs are being laid by a hidden alien creature intent on taking over Earth and assisted by human slaves.. (But then isn't that always the plan?). The ending is a blood-soaked splatter scene worth watching the film for this scene alone. Beautifully remastered  (I also have a cheap copy) and dubbed. Just remember this is an Italian production and sometimes it shows. A great late night viewer though and if you like Italian horror films like I do, you'll love it. And to top it all off, Ian McCulloch (fresh off ""Zombie"" and ""Zombie Holocaust"") returns as the hero. With him starring, you know it's good.

7905252,2,B000007QTX,"A crewless ship comes in port as it is being searched I half expected Max Schreck.

Once again they (the Italian film industry) are ahead of us in alien gore, stilted dialog which could be interpretation. Cheap props and lots of uses of flashlights when they could just flip a switch. Their suits would never pass the Ebola test. Later to be replace with Japanese looking helmets.

It passes time but they could have put a tad more effort into acting; at least it is not one dimensional we have more than one problem. At least the story does not lose anything over the decades. They borrowed a line from ""Them"" (1954) ""burn it all."" We even get an Ayn Rand type speech on being a man.

I suppose if you like the Ripley series and spaghetti space this film can be watched.

7905253,5,B000007QTX,"Luigi Cozzi clearly states that his intentions were to make a film like Alien.  He further states that he is a fan of sci-fi flicks made in the 50s.  Both influences are evident in this movie.  Unfortunately, he also had to deal with a demanding producer with contrary ideas.  Cozzi didn't get the title he wanted (Alien Arrives on Earth).  He didn't get the actress he wanted for the lead role (Caroline Munro).  He wanted to use stop-motion animation for the alien and was told no.  The producer also wanted him to throw in some James Bond elements.  This is definitely not the way to make a movie.

The plot is literally all over the place, from the gruesome discovery onboard a runaway vessel in New York, to a coffee plantation in Colombia.  The main characters are Louise Marleau (as a tough colonel), Ian McCulloch (as an alcoholic ex-astronaut who tried to warn the authorities of the green egg menace), and Marino Mase (as a slightly sarcastic cop who gets dragged into this intrigue).

Is this the finest example of sci-fi ever created?  Goodness, no, not even close.  But it is an interesting curio that kept me fully engaged and entertained.  Sadly, it really only has the one `gore factor' used throughout (contact with the egg-goo causing chests to explode, blood and guts go flying).  I've watched it twice.  It's definitely something I'll keep to watch again.  But I don't think anyone should mistake this for a classic.  At best it's merely kitsch made by a fan of the genre who quit directing movies decades ago.",1411516800,,1530,4.68796992481203

7905255,1,B000007QTX,"This is a fairly lame Italian sc-fi film with bad special effects and a bad plot. It borders on campy, but doesn't cross the line often enough to make the film a cult classic. Instead it is a dud. Louise Marleau plays a very young Col. Stella Holmes. She doesn't like to be called ""baby"" but enjoys a good smack to the face. (Italian film give away.) Exploding head alien eggs are discovered on a coffee ship from South America. Our colonel recalls an astronaut who returned from a Mars mission talk about such eggs and drew pictures of them, because taking a camera to Mars wouldn't make any sense.

Eventually they travel to South America to find the source of the contaminated coffee.

There are better and campier Italian sc-fi films. This one didn't make it for me in either category. You might want to keep the remote handy.
