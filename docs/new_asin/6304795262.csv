7878259,5,6304795262,Product arrived in a timely manner.  These are very good videos.  It really helps you understand how Xena the Warrior Princess got started and it is nice to see Hercules and Xena in these videos.  It has been enjoyable watching them.  I would definitely recommend this product to whoever is a fan of Xena or Hercules. :),1342396800,,320,4.56140350877193
7878260,5,6304795262,"This is literally Xena's birth, both as a character and as a new person.  It is how we see her for the very first time, and this time she is evil.  In her own tv-series we have seen little from har evil past, but it felt so close you could smell it.  Here we see what she was like.  And it is everything you ever dreamed of.  Lucy Lawless does an excellent job in luring Iolaus to fall in love with her and betray Hercules.  She almost get's him to kill Hercules, but he regains his sanity just in time to see what's going on.
In the gauntlet we see her first step towards the new life.  She saves a child from being slaughtered, and as a concequense she is betrayed by her own army.  She has to walk the gauntlet, and nearly dies.  But on the other side we see a redeamed and newborned woman.  She isn't good yet, but in many ways their betrayal has caused her to become another person.  Xena meets Hercules which she again tries to kill, but he disarms her and leaves her lying on the ground.  He asks her to join them in the fight for good, but she refuses.  Later she reconsiders and saves Hercules and Iolaus from getting slayed.  She joins them. Of course Hercules falls in love with her, but they decide to go seperate ways.  She in order to find herself, and to find a new purpose in life.  But this time it is not a purpose like the one in destiny, namely death.  She decides to try and do good, one deed at a time, to try and redeam her past actions.  That's the woman we first meet in the series.
After having seen these series I understood Xena even better.  So if you're a hardcore nutball like myself, you have to see this.  If not, see it anyway.  The acting is great, especially from Lucy Lawless and Michael Hurst.  It is great action with a touch of sci-fi.  For short a must see for everyone who likes action and drama!",1012867200,9,1838,4.144475920679887
7878261,5,6304795262,"In this delicious trilogy of unterror, we see the beginning of the end of Xena,Conquerer of Nations. Thus, the Warrior Princess is born. In an all-too-predictable plot of evil turning good,we are introduced to Xena and  her evil ways,how Hercules helped her see the error of her ways,and why she  now chooses to fight on the side of the angels(instead of with the angels  if she continued her misdeeds.)'Tis a must for all Xena fans,as you see her  origin somewhat,and if you currently watch the series, it's a fine example  of a character having evolved.",964396800,11,555,4.8
