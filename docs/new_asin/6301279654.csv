323052,4,6301279654,"Whose swine were they?  Heloise asks her Uncle Fulbert noting that the Jews regarded pigs as unclean. The reference is to a passage in Mark 5:1-20 in which the unclean spirit (named Legion, because they are many) is sent by Jesus into a herd of swine, which then rushes down the steep bank and into the sea.  Heloises Uncle Fulbert, a canon at the cathedral of Paris, admits he doesnt know.  When she asks Abelard the same question he does of course know that the swine not only belonged to but were symbolically the Romans occupying Judea.  And the two well-educated, inquisitive and highly intelligent minds have met in what flowers into the medieval worlds most passionate and most doomed romance.
Student adoration translated into riches not only for the professor (students paid them directly) but for the entire town (students were consumers of goods and services).  The arrogant genius Abelard attracted students with his controversial scholasticism and remained protected by those who were the economic beneficiaries.  But the establishment heavily invested in the status quo and the rival professors, loosing students to him, and boiling over with academic jealousy, were ripe for and willing for a plot against him. His illicit love with Heloise provides the justification to move against him.
The film, however, is not about Abelards spectacular teaching or his big name opposition but is largely the story of Heloise, bearing a son, and banished to a nunnery.  Based on The Letters of Abelard and Heloise we follow their separated but on-going intellectual and emotional relationship, seasoned with Abelards resignation and Heloises constant love, recriminations, and bitter unhappiness.  Their final desire was to be buried side by side and whether this actually happened or not, they are forever joined together in the telling of their life stories.
A colorful and captivating medieval romp and one that holds the attention to the end.",1504569600,5,1949,5.165079365079365

Peter Abelard, despite the tragedy of this love and his life, is remembered as one of the greatest minds of medieval Europe. Heloise is remembered as well, as a brilliant woman who embodies what a medieval woman could be and often was given the opportunity: educated and influential.

323604,5,6301279654,"This was one of my favorite movies for many years. It is based on the romantic novel by Marion Meade and turned into a gorgeous costume/period drama about the incredible romance about Peter Abelard, a medieval French scholastic philosopher, theologian and preeminent logician and Heloise (Hlose d'Argenteuil), a French nun, writer, scholar, and abbess. The other reviewers describe the movie and all I wish to add is that it is shot beautifully and it tells the story from an angle that makes the audience connect to and feel for these two characters. What is untold in this romantic films is Heloise's contribution to history. She wrote many letters which are record of the earliest, most radical feminist philosophies of not only the 12th century, but even today. Heloise wrote of her disdain for marriage stating in her first letter, I preferred love to wedlock, freedom to a bond. She even went so far as to define marriage as ""the ultimate form of prostitution"", an unthinkably brash statement for a female in 12th century France. Peter Abelard himself reproduced her arguments in ""The Story of His Calamities"". My advice... watch the movie, do a little research on the couple and then delve into their letters to see the passion truly ignite between two forward thinkers who were centuries ahead of their time. That is the beautifulest love of all...",1439683200,3,1356,4.951754385964913

323608,4,6301279654,"Splendidly embellished and erotically charged film inspired by the tragic consequence of the relationship between Hlose d'Argenteuil and Peter Ablard. Historically cringe-worthy, but the stellar cast (Derek de Lint, in particular, gives a compelling and layered performance as the distinguished and complex teacher, Peter Ablard) and thoughtful script allows one to forgive its dramatic license. The symbolism of the white dove's feather was an excellent touch.

What succeeds in this film is that it doesn't, at least initially, over-simplify or exploit the stark reality of these two individuals whose lives were immeasurably altered by Canon Fulbert's singular act of brutality.  Where it falters, is that it doesn't keep up that momentum during the latter half and begins to descend into a vague sort of romanticized apology that clings to posterity's won't of reducing a multilayered, physiological, psychological and emotional disaster to an idealized myth...which has done these two brilliant souls a disservice for centuries.",1425859200,4,1033,5.701298701298701

I was really expecting a great romance :( To me I think their romance was too rushed, I would have liked to have seen some more interatctions before this couple before just jumping into bed together lol. Now this doesn't happen till about halfway through the movie but the main characters only see each other three or four times before they just have sex. She meets him in the street for the first time, then she meets him again at her uncle's and then...well they do meet quite a bit lol I just felt that only one scene actually showed me their conflict at least his anyway. From the beginning I didn't like Elouise...sorry!  ! just found her disrespectful and obnoxious but this was all to show just how intelligent she was though I personally just saw it as her being willfully confrontational. I think I might have liked this movie more if the heroine was at least somewhat believable...and I understand that it was a true story! lol Well if she did in fact act that way in the middle ages then she was a very rare woman. I think it could have been so much more if I actually felt a connection between these two.

What I saw in this movie was probably the most weakest willed man in the entire history of France, a nation known for being weak willed. Whoever would cry over this movie is in need of a prescription of Prosac. And a real life.

Of course, I don't believe in chance. Love can be passionate, reckless, overwhelming, selfless, cruel, and a million other emotions that pull you in every conceivable direction. This very real film pulls you through all of these feelings and more. The emotions are raw. The humanity is unavoidable. This is a cinematic masterpiece which shows the true depths of love and the cost it exacts on your soul.

Beyond the characters, the plot, and the timeless depths of this love story is the amazing cinematography. This movie defines passion in all its facets. Scenes are dramatic in color and tone. The individuals are vibrant and flawed. Anyone who has ever loved and stayed the course through adversity and the dictates of fate and destiny will understand why this film is such a masterpiece.

One negative about the film in its trimmed down version is the deletion of poignant love scenes. I far prefer the Director's Cut which includes these deleted scenes. As with any screen adaptation of a novel, some details have been glossed over. This saga would run several hours if it had been filmed as an unabridged version. This is a film well worth watching.",1113177600,21,1313,4.857142857142857

The tragic love affair (and its consequences) between the noted theologian Peter Abelard and the brilliant Heloise is artfully brought to the screen in the adaptation of the novel by the same name.  The casting and cinematograhy were supurb.

Two versions of this film exist on videotape.  The unrated version is by far the best, although EXTREMELY graphic.  The ""R"" rated version toned the explicit material down significantly -- but also cut much material which had nothing to do with any ""racy"" scenes, and really did damage to the plot line.

As an additional ""plus"", some of the historical liberties which the author of the novel took (see my review for details) were greatly toned down in the film.

An enjoyable, historical film -- but not for everyone.  If you can't handle the explicit material, don't bother with the edited version.  Too much was cut out.",1108339200,50,942,4.730061349693251

I've recently had the pleasure of visiting their graves at Pere la Chaise in Paris and the sight of them lying there side by side is one I'll never forget.

I tried to read the book that was written in old English (very difficult to understand considering I'm not a native speaker), so I felt I was losing part of the history. This movie made me learn more about the beliefs in the past. I really felt sorry for this couple who loved each other so much and had to go through so much pain in their lives. Two incredible minds who fell in love while debating... delicously exciting! I highly recommend it! Try to visit the Parvis of Notre Dame, as well, and if possible, read the book ""The Letters of Abelard and Heloise"".",1029974400,11,776,4.315068493150685
323695,3,6301279654,"I did not know the story of Heloise and Abelard before seeing this movie. The story is based on letters of a 12th century couple who had a very passionate relationship who are eventually separated by social and religious forces that inevitably lead each into lives of celebacy. Yet they maintained a lengthly long distance relationship relating to each other their continued passion for each other and sexual longing.  The story is by its nature very erotic and the film was given an X rating in its full form.  The R rated version is pretty much the same but the film is cropped a bit to mask the male and female naughty bits. However the directors cut is not so explicit as to be considered pornographic. The film is historically interesting and by the end you will have an education on the story of Heloise and Abelard from their meeting to the grave. The film is beautifully captured with pretty cinematography and nice authentic looking period sets and costuming. The film sets up an interesting relationship of Abelard who most believes in pursuing God and Heloise who most believes in pursuing happiness. The reason the film works on any level is Kim Thompson as Heloise. She possesses a glorious mane of Irish red hair, delicate facial features, beautiful transparent skin and slender feminine figure.  But beyond that she conveys a clever alert mind and a passion about her intellect that matches her passion elsewhere in the film.  With the exception of Denholm Elliot playing Fulbert as the fly in their romance, most of the other performances are less invigorating. The story does an adequate job of dramatizing the letters. But the centerpiece of the film is the well shot and set up lovemaking of two people who wrestle with their minds first before wrestling their bodies... which is very sexy.
