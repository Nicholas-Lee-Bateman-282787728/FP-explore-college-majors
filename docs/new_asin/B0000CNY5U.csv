1920206,2,B0000CNY5U,"This 1989 film is simply amazing. It is perhaps the one and only 92 minute film with no plot, story-line, or sense. The director must have thought the average movie goer is of high intelligence, why else would he leave it up to you to figure this out??

OK from what I can tell, is this sometime in the future where there are cyborgs. Some cyborgs are good and some are bad. So bad humans and bad cyborgs fight the good cyborgs and good humans. That's really about it. However there is one more added element. There is one policeman. Yes you read that right, one policeman. They come out of some kind of academy, and then they are field trained by a veteran cop. The veteran cop is known as 'Black Man', because he is a black man. He trains the new cop to take his place. He is white, so of course the good cyborg who comes looking for help from the law asks ""May I call you white man?""

It seems the cyborg (whose name is Dakar, or something like that) was in love with a human female. In the beginning of the movie we see evil people and cyborgs using good people as target practice. They are chased into a quarry by evil cyborg Shark. Once the humans are in the quarry, the bullets fly. One girl manages to escape and gets caught by the evil ones, she is raped and then shot. So now Dakar is out for revenge, he leads the good people and the sherrif to the evil fortress to kill them.

OK let's talk about the highlight of the movie. The evil blonde. She is stunning in her low cut red leather outfit. She's evil alright. It takes an evil woman to watch another woman get raped. It takes a more evil woman to smile as she shoots the woman after the rape. But this woman is the queen of all evil, because she has it on film and watches an hour later on a big screen TV. She does have some nude scenes, but the more I watched it, it seems that as the movie goes by her boobs get smaller and smaller.

Well the 'climax' of the movie if you want to call it that, borders on the ridiculous. You will see scenes of the same people going through the same area, shooting the same people they just shot a minute ago. Also they hit the fortress at night, but within moments it is high noon, then at the end of the movie it is sunrise. You figure that one out. The fight scenes are equally bizarre. Shark fights Dakar in a room and Shark knocks Dakar down and runs out of the room. In the next scene we have Dakar running down the stairs and into a hallway, and Shark comes up behind him. Now I said ""wait a minute. How did that happen? Shark ran out of the room first while Dakar was on the ground."" So Dakar had to run past Shark on the stairs to get ready for th enext fight scene.

In the end all are dead except for the sherrif. The hot blond shoots Dakar and the sherrif shoots the hot blonde. Blood flies throughout this movie, but when the hot blond gets shot while wearing nothing but a silk nightgown, she goes down without a mark on her. Even though she was shot at close range two times with a Colt 45. The sheriff then leaves his badge on dead Dakar's body and walks away.

Of course in the beginning of the movie all this man wanted was that badge. It was his dream. Now after one mission he gives up his badge and goes off to wherever heros walk off to.

If I could describe this movie in one word...... inane.",1179792000,6,3317,4.101694915254237
7999523,3,B0000CNY5U,"Cheese as cheese does. The Humanoids and the Androids are on a robot reservation, in a never ending war and are allotted one sheriff. The description makes it sound like a better movie but what you get are two 70's glam rock gangs killing each other - because why not? Good MST3K but outside of that forgettable beyond Margie's bloodlust ""I only Love Death"". No robots, no gore, just a lot of bad ""I've been shoot!"" acting.",1518393600,,423,4.5064935064935066
7999524,5,B0000CNY5U,"BRONX EXECUTIONER (1989) is an Italian film, shot in NYC. It begins w/ lots of electronic / computer stuff going on. This is to show us how ""futuristic"" things are. This movie is a conglomeration of various elements and particles, from actual hit movies, including ROBOCOP, BLADE RUNNER, and THE TERMINATOR, w/ a pinch of THE ROAD WARRIOR tossed in for extra zip. How could this NOT be the most exciting movie ever made? Wellll... They found a way. A woman named Margie (Margie Newton) leads her army of killer-biker androids, led by Shark (Chuck Valenti), in an assault on mankind. Said assault is a pure ballet of chunky cheddar goodness! Bullets fly, as people flip, flop, and twist about in slllowww-motiiionnn! The dialogue is poetically pathetic nonsense, and constitutes the greatest strength of this cinematic colostomy bag! All while Margie runs around in her awesome red, leatherette mini-dress and dog collar! Meanwhile, a man known as Warren (Woody Strode) is training a guy named James (Gabriele Gori) for some unknown reason. Fights occur. More people fly around. Lots of motorcycles, a blasted landscape, and musclemen, all add up to mostly nothing. A rape / murder scene takes place, in order to supply pointless nudity and a reason for the viewer to feel anger rather than the emptiness of this film. Enter Dakar (Alex Vitale), who up to this point, has spouted some of the best, most wondrous dialogue, in his newly torn, clean T-shirt and suspenders! He inexplicably joins Warren and James to take on Margie and her silly cyborgs. More beautiful, spoken lines spill from Dakar's lips like fountains of bubbling molasses! Can these heroes possibly defeat Margie and her forces of clunky robo-schlock? You Betcha!  Margie, for her part, manages to act tough while providing more pointless, albeit heavenly, nudity. All hyper-schlock lovers, be sure to watch the final battle between Dakar and Shark. It's RAW DEAL Arnold vs. TERMINATOR Arnold! Sort of. Any way you look at it, BRONX EXECUTIONER is a stupendous, skull-flattening experience!...",1506556800,,2060,5.07669616519174
7999525,3,B0000CNY5U,"Watch it with subtitles on for extra comedy. It seems as if they used the script to subtitle, so you'll get little gems like [with philosophical angst] thrown in with the already entertaining lines.

Lousy special effects, boring suspense and predicable plotting make this one a toss over.

7999530,4,B0000CNY5U,"Terrible movie with all the trimmings. The only reason it did not get five-stars is that 90% of the movie took place in what appeared to be an old copper mine or quarry. That and they used some bits of footage over and over throughout the movie.

7999532,1,B0000CNY5U,"I ""won"" this movie on autction on eBay for a penny...and wanted my money back!  WORSE movie ever!  SERIOUSLY!  The directing, action (ha!), acting, camera...everything was worse than 'homemade'.  I hate to be brutal, but why oh why didn't someone warn me about this.  After ten minutes I had to turn it off for fear my brain would explode.  I love 'world end' type movies, no matter how bad (child of the cold war); but, this was just plain painful.  It wasn't fun and kitchy or cult-ish in the least.  It was just plain dreadful and boring.  There.  I saved you a penny.",1256860800,2,571,4.456310679611651
