2883957,1,B000SAGGSC,"Some things never change.  The master of error, Uwe Boll (who has previously adapted other video games to the screen with magical results like House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, and the first BloodRayne) returns to direct this sequel (the second in an alleged trilogy) which finds the sexy, half human/half vamp Rayne (Natassia Malthe, replacing Kristanna Loken who wisely chose not to reprise her role) years after the events of the first film and in the middle of the wild west.  She teams up with lawman Pat Garret (Michael Pare) against the vampiric Billy the Kid (Zack Ward, soon to be seen in Boll's Postal) and his clan of blood suckers.  As you can expect from anything that has Boll's name attached to it, BloodRayne 2 features atrocious acting, laughable action scenes, and ungodly direction that could be done better by most amateur film students.  Malthe looks quite good in tight leather with red hair, but her physical appearance alone can't save this turkey.  All in all, if you thought the first film was bad, be prepared; because BloodRayne 2 makes the first film look like Citizen Kane.",1189468800,19,1107,4.774869109947644

I'd hoped to see Rayne for a few minutes in the outfit from the DVD cover - disappointed.
Is is a shame to cover so much of Natassia Malthe's body in a long, leather, coat and to have most of the film shot in the dark. Perhaps 10 minutes with Rayne and she's riding a horse or lying under something. Meh.

False advertising.

The DVD included comic book pages which are much sexier than anything in the movie.

He gloats that he gets money & tax breaks to make movies. Well, apparently enough people have complained. Yes, making a movie is impressive, but if you are bad at it, try to learn from it -- don't brag. I Loken and Ramirez from the 1st movie.

Everything you loved about the original BloodRayne is repeated here, only moreso, except the very hot Kristanna Loken has now been replaced by the even hotter Natassia Malthe! All you need to do is Google some photographs of these actresses and not only can you see how hot they are, you can even see the complete extent of their acting abilities: flat stomaches with toned abs, large breasts, pretty faces, tight butts.

2883985,5,B000SAGGSC,"BloodRayne 2 Deliverence is a new story setting for Rayne that is unique and imaginative. This installment dosen't follow any of the video game lore,but still ends up being a cool idea. I am one of the biggest BloodRayne fans in the world that has both video games,all three movies,and a tattoo of bloodrayne on my back and even with all the mixed reviews I was very satisfied with BloodRayne2. Natassia Malthe picks up the role of Rayne,that is half vampire-half human,and mixes it up with merciless vampire cowboys led by Billy the Kid. Rayne sets off to find the vampire cowboys to avenge the death of a close friend and the taking of the friends children. Her adventure leads her to the town of Deliverence which is under control of Billy and his vampire bunch. Rayne gets some assistance from Pat Garrett which is a member of the Brimstone Society and is tracking down Billy as well. Rayne then really sets the town alive from then on. Natassia is sexy as hell with a black leather outfit that will set your heart racing while doing a very good job protraying Ryane in the process. As far as the so-called flaws that exsist if you are a true BloodRayne fan you will take the good with the bad of Rayne in a new setting,but still doing what she does best in slicing and dicing her vampire foes into dust. If you love blood and gore dished out by one kick-ass blade wielding vixen then you will enjoy this if you are a true BloodRayne fan. Bottom line BloodRayne Rocks!!!",1315785600,4,1474,4.483271375464684
2883986,3,B000SAGGSC,"Let me state, for the record, that I don't think Uwe Boll is the worst filmmaker ever nor do I think all his movies suck. I've seen far worse movies and, I do mean, far worse movies than his. If you don't believe me, look through all my reviews of movies I've seen.

Boodrayne 2: Deliverance is a direct-to-DVD sequel to Bloodrayne. Instead of the lovely Kristanna Loken playing the lead role, this time- it is played by Natassia Malthe(who is pretty awesome, in her own right). The story takes 'Rayne to the old west as she battles a gang of outlaw vampires led by Billy the Kid in the western town of Deliverance.

While Bloodrayne 2: Deliverance isn't a vampire western quite up to the caliber of, say, Sundown;  it is worth a watch at least once. It is a fairly decent timekiller but one you'll quickly forget. Where the movie goes wrong with me is that the acting is quite dry and uninspired. While Malthe is a joy to look at and very sexy, that can only hold the film for so long. I wish Boll had cast actors that were well-known. It may have made a difference with this movie.

Sadly, not unless you find this in a bargain bin somewhere for a five-spot, this is a rental- at best. Keep in mind, though, this isn't the worst movie you'll ever see.",1315008000,,1253,4.319148936170213
2883987,2,B000SAGGSC,This was disappointing compared to the original Bloodrayne.  I would not recommend this one to anyone.  It was slow and boring.,1304294400,,127,5.0
2883988,2,B000SAGGSC,"I only paid 3 bucks for this and that was still ""expensive"" in terms of how much this film is worth. Try 50 cents if anything. I fell asleep during the film but maybe I was just tired to begin with but then Bloodrayne 2 was boring. It is really rare for me to rate a movie low and more so to not enjoy it. If I had her weapons, I'd be using them non-stop and her she is only using them, if not just one of her blades for a very short time. It's mostly just shootings and some blood here and there. I didn't care for any of the characters or plot. Bloodrayne is a bad ass videogame and Rayne is mighty fine so it's sad when the films stink. I dunno why Uwe Boll sucks at directing and hasn't discovered it yet. I hope they remake Bloodrayne into the gory, nasty, sexy film it's suppose to be. I respect Uwe Boll for all his films and work but he really needs to try harder so he can make a movie that can earn more than a 2 star rating.",1289606400,,935,3.875
2883989,5,B000SAGGSC,This was an excellent movie. If you like vampire movies you'll like this. I got it at a great price on amazon.com,1263081600,3,113,4.181818181818182
2883990,5,B000SAGGSC,"BloodRayne and BloodRayne2 are excellent movies.  BloodRayne is set in medieval period and BloodRayne2 is set in the old west, cowboy and indian time frame.  If you are into vampyras with a twist:  Sun light and holywater does not bother either of the ladies; once they get into full swing of things.  BloodRayne and BloodRayne2 have left openings for more of the same to come.  Hope they do.

2883991,2,B000SAGGSC,"This is a B-movie, nothing more,  and on that level it was successful.  Inane plot, cheesy characters, and complete logic-failures are just a few of the indictments easily leveled against this film.  But I admit, it did make me bust up laughing in more than a scene or two.  Poking fun at these kinds of movies is really part of their appeal.  They are made to be corny.  So set your expectations accordingly.

By the way, the outdoor cinematography startled me; sweeping mountain vistas, cold winter snows, and dark approaching storm clouds were very well done, adding lots of mood to this otherwise campy film.",1243900800,,612,4.771428571428571
2883992,3,B000SAGGSC,"I honestly don't get some of you people. Some movies are MEANT to suck (pun intended).

B movies and the like are not made w/the purpose of winning mainstream awards. They exist to give people in the industry a training ground and to give viewers a way to pass the time (when reading, watching a GOOD flick, or enjoying the great outdoors aren't on the menu).

The plot: Dhampir in the Wild West, out to save Deliverance from Billy the Kid (who is a vampire). She fails, escapes, forms a posse, and eventually ""saves the day"".

For dudes: she looks hot and can read and deliver lines better than Denise Richards.

For ladies: If you like pseudo ""karate"" fighting, western gun-slinging, and blood, this might work for you.

Much is written about how AWFUL Uwe Boll(sp?) is as a director. That may be. But, frankly, I am not impressed by Eli Roth, who seems to think naked women, diced and sliced every which way, make a good film (see also Saw I - 2 thousand.)

If you expect nothing more than the opportunity to while away the time and move on to the better video game, this should work for you.

2883994,1,B000SAGGSC,"What could possibly be worse than the most horrendously lifeless, plotless, horrendously acted, laughably choreographed movie in many a year, directed by the most reviled director?

Why, a sequel, of course.

And while ""Bloodrayne 2: Deliverance"" doesn't succeed in actually being worse than its predecessor, it does succeed in being almost as bad. Slipshod production, ghastly acting and a truly laughable central plot (oh come on, a vampire Billy the Kid versus the Ms. Romanian Bustier?) all weight down the flimsiest of campy vampire flicks. It makes for a good drinking game, though.

The railroad is coming to the Not-So-Wild West town of Deliverance... and so are some nasty vampiric desperados, led by Billy the Kid. Entre Rayne (Natassia Malthe), a dhampir with lots of leather and some faux-medieval weaponry -- and after she finds some corpses in the snow (which seems to appear and reappear at random), she head to Deliverance.

Billy the Kid is ruling the place now, and she's a-fixin' to clean up that town (sorry, I had to say it). Turns out that Billy is not satisfied with Deliverance -- he plans to build an army, and he has spectacular powers that surprise even Rayne. Cue lots of gunshots, faux-Western banter and the occasional Brimstone guy in jail.

When the director thinks that people are so stupid that the first line must inform where the movie is set (""Wow! The Wild West!""), you know things can only go downhill. This stinker of a plot might have barely worked in the hands of a cinematic genius, but in the hands of Boll, it's a disaster. Even worse, Boll appears to taking the plot seriously, rather than playing it for camp value.

And after the choppy, spasmodic style of ""Bloodrayne,"" the sequel goes the other way -- the entire movie oozes by at the pace of half-dried mud, with a lot of Rayne stalking around, staring at people, and occasionally having long, boring showdowns and conversations. Occasionally extras get killed for scares, or random shots are rendered in epic slow-motion, such as Rayne's horse walking through a river. Not an important river, just a river. Because it looks cool.

In other words, Boll seems totally bored and his actual participation is sporadic -- although his enthusiasm flares up at the funniest times, such as the absurdly silly showdowns. In the meantime, he lets the movie marinate in shaky, meandering camerawork and murky lighting, as well as a long stream of truly ghastly dialogue (""A woman alone won't be able to handle those bloodsuckers!"" ""Your fly's open"").

I will say this -- the gorgeous Malthe seems like a decent actress, mostly via her body language, her voice and her eyes. Too bad she's forced to spout faux-Western dribble like ""That ain't the work of no bandits!"" and ""You reckoned I'd given up lookin' for you?"" She actually looks pretty miserable, as if wondering how she ended up in this ghastly movie.

""Bloodrayne 2: Deliverance"" doesn't manage the heights of hysterical wretchedness as the first movie, but Boll's sleeping-on-the-job direction and ghastly script make this a minor trainwreck. Worst of all, it's a boring trainwreck.",1231632000,,3131,4.948571428571428

2883997,1,B000SAGGSC,"before reading this, anyone who is should know that i, before playing bloodrayne, and researching it on the internet, neither knew of uwe boll, or that movies were even made from it. if i had stayed ignorant, i would have been much happier.

bloodrayne 1 movie:

summary
the good:

pretty women & scenery

the bad:
acting,
story, // probably would have been better if the acting was better.
many of the stunts.
the fight scenes. (they rival the quality of those in ninja turtles 3).

The acting is stilted, and seeing rayne as a carny makes very little sense. she seems weak as a baby fart, and can only fight humans using bloodrage (until later when she magically becomes stronger, but only to low quality human level). rayne crying about drinking blood seems really stupid to me. i understand that she is supposedly sheltered etc, etc.

also would making raynes skin pale really have been so difficult? her complextion in this film indicates that she stays under the sun for long periods of time. basically rayne looks like a beautiful california girl, not a sleek deadly dhampir. also her blades are no longer bracers, but just some police night sticks with blades that she occasionally uses. she's no longer a vicious killing machine, but a lukewarme damsel in distress, who sometimes fights. the girl scouts from the movie dodgeball kicked more butt than this girl. she even says she doesn't thirst for human blood, which no vampire/dhampir should be able to say with a straight face. she even has sex with one of the vampire hunters. which to me is just a cheap ploy. as mentioned on other reviews of the movie (but not this bundle product) the bars clanking during the scene are hilarious and deserve a benny hill sound track to play in the background. even without comparing her to the game rayne, i'd still be disappointed.

while i understand not always using the games original story for a movie may be a good idea, its only a good idea if the idea is actually better than the game. anyone who played the game would probably be offended by the transformation rayne suffers in this sham of moving pictures. the commentarry states that boll some what wanted to make a prequel, but some story elements state otherwise. such as the eye of beliar being received hundreds of years before game.

the mindless gore in this movie is also disappointing.

meatloaf is one of the 2 people in this movie that actually has an almost tolerable performance, but the wig he wears is even worse than the one he wore in rocky horror (which btw is a very good movie).
the women around him are the bigger highlight around the scene, but the cross eyed guy that is seeking refuge there is more distracting than the women's breast. though his eye is much easier to follow than the boring plot.

the plot isn't difficult, just boring. little reason to care about anyone in this movie. even rayne.

kagan doesn't look scary at all. he has the appearance of the nerd of vampires. the kind that gets wedgies, has his lunch pale (blood plasma) taken, glasses stomped upon, and cello smashed.

the directors commentary is slightly more interesting than the movie. but not by much. there is more energy in the director commentary between the actors and boll than the actors amongst themselves in the film. what was most unnerving, was that the actors actually seemed to think they did a great job.

not much else to say than that this movie in insidiously boring. installation of the game that came with this pack was more entertaining than watching this.

this movie left a brown stain in my dvd player.

bloodrayne 1 game:

the good:

decent voice acting,
mildy interesting storyline.
this gives me another reason to use my p990 pad (would rather use my mouse.)
the characters are well designed (graphically)
there is a joke about an almost prize winning bull in it. (i can now understand the plights of farmer's and their need to win blue ribbons)

the bad

repetitive:
{
while level != complete;
hack/slash/shoot

if level = midway
make player find battery/key
make player fight a sub boss.

level = 1 + tocomplete.

if ever stand still or change area, respawn all enemies in previous area.
//makes backtracking annoying and is just filler.
}

the blade targeting system is nonexistent. the guns go dry rather quickly, and are best saved for special enemies and bosses. luckily, the guns can be poorly aimed, and the game has aimbot(auto targeting) for them otherwise. unfortunately that also means tougher to lead shots. so fast moving enemies can nullify guns.

the jumping system in this is horrible. i wish mario ran a jumping training camp. (oddly enough she acts like mario in 2nd game). usually the jumps are alright, until the temple levels. then, at least for me, i felt like physically going in and wiping the game from the drive.

i loved the stereotypical plot of thule (occultist nazis) finding artifacts that give them super powers. not like that hasn't been over used as a premise.
makes me wonder if hellboy got the idea for that german guy with the blades from bloodrayne. probably not.

also this and bloodrayne 2 have an annoying habit of asking about video settings.
as if remembering them is not enough. the good thing about it is, that if i didn't really mean to execute the program, i can just close that window.

another big problem is that the cutscenes spawn another window. which sometimes causes the game to cycle to desktop. this occurs in both games. really annoying, and can occasionally crash the game.

basically this game has low-mediocre gameplay, almost no replay value, though it is likable (somewhat). rayne is a very intriguing character.

bloodrayne 2 movie.

MOMMY BAD TOUCH! *weeps harshly*. please make the pain stop. 95 minutes of shame and suffering. this movie is basically a digital version of a dementor's kiss (a dementor is a harry potter creature).

the girl from silent hill movie (which also sucked badly) is unfortunately back in this. she wasn't very good in silent hill, but does alright in this. she plays scared little girl well. i feel sorry for her to have those two blots in her life. i hope she doesn't become like britany spears, the olsen twins, or the children from different strokes.

this time there is even a black guy in it (one was in first movie, but barely noticeable). haven't my people suffered enough? this is one movie where we sure as hell don't need to be a token character.

the fight scenes still are terrible. they warrant BAAAM! ZOOM! KAPAOWWWWY! to be added to the hits. would have been more fun.

billie doesn't look tough or interesting. his acting is terrible. actually all of it is. the trauma of reliving this while typing this is almost overwhelming.
his accent is horrible. basically he looks like a drag queen in cosplay (playing dressup). his bela lugosi impression sucks too. finally the way he kept stroking those children was a little uncomfortable. i kept expecting him to offer them candy to get into his van. i've got mars bars and a playstation in here, bulah buluah *hiss*

raynes character is even more unbelievable than the first. tolerates daylight just fine, apparently water immunity lasts from last movie (though i think allergies to water is silly anyhow). she is just as weak as in the first movie, but with mo betta diction.

i am still wondering why does the camera keep swaying like its unsecured on the rough seas. also many specific shots suck in this movie. such as the all important show down where raynes posse is about to be killed. good idea, keep focusing on the bad teeth, and the all important final cracker eating shot.

there was one decently done scene. a scene where rayne walks into a room, and children are set up in a trap about to be hanged by a big stone and rope. she has to hold on to the rope to save them. though one boy dies. a real omg now that is messed up reaction is warranted there, which is the only other emotion than disgust that was invoked by this movie. though, i ask myself, where the hell did he get that huge stone. the children's acting in this scene was convincing.

the final monologue from billy and the incredibly lame fight scene really did put the white cap on this steaming pile of bird... well anyway.

i think this movie actually outdoes alfie (with jude law) as being the worst movie ever done. even about schmidt wasn't this bad. about schmidt was just boring, so was alfie, but this is legitimately bad. thats it i'm done, i can't stand thinking about this movie any longer. colossal failure of a painful magnitude. i just want to move on with my life. i've had enough trauma already from the first.

only the children and the mayor were enjoyable in this movie. (the mayor only because he has a pleasant voice).

bloodrayne 2 game:

mediocre. it has its own problems. namely the camera, and the near endless supply of piggies to be butchered. it has a fairly vast amount of sexual prowess. i'd expect some gamers would likely find something else to play with while in game. rayne jiggles lewdly, and panty shots that successfully fills any fanservice. but other than that, this game hasn't much else to offer.

the good points are that rayne is a likable character, we see more of her history, more moves, better combat system, and harpoon is better.

the bad points are, the harpoon still sucks. many will disagree, but i find being required to toss people annoying. sometimes they go the direction pressed, sometimes not (have to press direction she's facing, not camera).

but what annoys me the most is that this HUGE chunk of metal is being thrown into their chest, and people get up from it. vampires/dhampirs i'd think probably could recover quickly, but humans? can harpoon them near infinite times without a problem (rarely does the harpoon kill them). although tacky i prefer to have a modification that could be added/activated that causes her to say one liners like scorpion from mortal kombat.

the acrobats, while a good addition, are done badly. the controls aren't the main problem, but the camera control is.

the combos, while nice, aren't exactly needed, or easy to do. this game is mostly just stay behind the opponent, and mash buttons.

to me i mildly enjoyed it. mostly because of the better graphics, bloodraynes model is exquisite, and extra ways to kick butt. but the over use of being forced to use the harpoon, horrible camera, lack of manual targeting hampers its desirability.

overall for all products.

the movies suck hard enough to warrant buying games separately. or not at all. for people who liked blood rayne games, they'll appreciate the games bundle. would love if these games were released on good old games' website for like 5-6$. then i wouldn't literally  have to wash the stink off them.

only worth buying if wanting the games. burn the movies. shred them, dispose of them. or better yet, don't buy the bundle pack or movies at all. put in the extra dollar and get the games individually. i am will not use the movies as coasters as i'm inclined to think that they will make any drink on them taste bad. or worse, trigger flashbacks and relive the horror.",1229731200,,11149,4.691282051282052

2883999,2,B000SAGGSC,"Imagine a movie set in snowy, picturesque Montana.  Then, let your mind's eye travel back some six-score years into the past.  Sprinkle you inner sight with a motley collection of hard-working farmers, tough frontier women, rugged lawmen, women of ill repute, and honest businessmen.  Your brain then creates an antagonist from antiquity's dustbin who threatens the way of life and very existence of the townsfolk.  Finally, a hero emerges who fashions a daring band of do-gooders that pledge to banish the new evil.

By the way, the bad guys are all gun-toting cowboy vampires, and their leader is an ancient vampire hailing from the darkest, most forgotten realms of Eastern Europe--the terrible demon known as...Billy the Kid.

Infamous director Uwe Boll (""Bloodrayne"") strikes again in ""Bloodrayne 2:  Deliverance,"" and not necessarily into uncharted territory, believe it or not.  The ""vampire-western"" has been done before, and probably done better.  Zack Ward (""Titus"") plays the vampiric Billy the Kid, descending upon the small town of Deliverance to spread woe and death.  Rayne (Natassia Malthe), the beautiful half-human, half-vampire heroine bedecked in full duster glory, rides into town to discover that her friends have been killed, and their children taken.  She soon finds that she is not alone--Pat Garret (Michael Pare), the perennial lawman/backstabber/mercenary (depending on your point of view) presents himself.  She rebuffs his offer of teaming up and rides into town alone, determined to destroy the rot which has infested the land.  Unfortunately, Billy and his accent have other plans for the would-be savior.

Intentional or not, Uwe Boll's direction in this movie is noticeably different than in prior films.  Note that I did not say better, but I also don't know if I mean that the direction quality is worse.  Standard Boll strategies of droll sex scenes, bizarre plots with nary a connecting thread, wounds spewing gallons of fresh blood, and video game splice sequences are not in attendance here.  Instead, he introduces numerous extreme close-ups before scenes of questionable emotional impact, multitudes of teeth-gratingly useless slow-motion bits, and pages of musical notation played constantly at ""dramatic"" moments.  Could director Boll actually be trying to become a better film-maker?  We can only hope.

I felt that this film was actually a bit superior to the first ""Bloodrayne.""  The opening horror sequence in the farmhouse was unnerving for the most part.  The scene during which ""The Preacher"" is recruited was a fine bit of over-the-top comedy, and actor Michael Eklund completely stole that part of the show.  Zack Ward managed to be creepy and even scary once or twice.  Gatling guns are always, and without exception, totally f****** cool.  The plot was much, much more solid and cohesive than prior Boll efforts, though it still bored to tears.

The bad--or rather, the worse, as we are already starting a notch or two lower than average--as it were:  lame fighting, poor acting, overuse of slow-motion shots, and a closing quotation that will have you scratching your head in befuddlement.  It was a hair better than ""Bloodrayne""--take that for what it's worth.",1226880000,,3217,5.2671905697445975

Next the guys she fought Rayne would easily despense of these clowns. Next when ever she was weak she could easily feed on her enemies to regain her strength. As far as martial arts she didn't use any in this movie. THe first one was more entertaining than this even though they butchered it too. Furtehermore anyone who plays the game that she can't come near water it burns her skin instantly. i could go all day long about things they left out about her  acrobatic abilities they should have included but it won't do this movie no justice.

2884001,1,B000SAGGSC,"The good Dr. Boll has outdone himself by following the lackluster&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BloodRayne/dp/B000EQ5V86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BloodRayne</a>&nbsp;with a sequel so bad that it gives&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-the-Dead/dp/B0000YEE6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of the Dead</a>&nbsp;a run for its money. While I'm a fan of direct-to-video cinema and am quick to forgive the quirks that come with a limited budget, knowing that this film probably wouldn't have been made any differently under Boll even if it had an extra $10 million to spend erases the empathy I might have held otherwise and allows me to embrace the enmity that I've come to harbor for the director's output.

The story: a frontier town has fallen to vampire infestation, headed by the notorious and bloodthirsty Billy the Kid (Zack Ward,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Titus/dp/B0009K8LCA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Titus</a>).

The original ""Bloodrayne"" feels nothing short of Oscar-worthy by the standards of ""Deliverance."" At least the first film had Ben Kingsley and a couple of mountaintop shots to its credit. The sequel, however, has Boll's new favorite actor Zack Ward giving the most atrocious performance of his career alongside some of the most boring storytelling and poor video production that I've seen in some time. The action scenes are uninventive and poorly choreographed. Veterans of the director's previous adaptations will need no reminding that there's no hope of plot intrigue to help us waste away the time between fights. Plainly, it's the convoluted parts of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alone-in-the-Dark/dp/B0007XBM5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alone in the Dark</a>&nbsp;all over again.

While I expected the dramatic content to be bad, it's the technical aspects of the film that take the cake for pure shoddiness. These are the worst production values I've ever seen in a Boll movie. For example, the film takes place in the Wild West, but it looks like a bunch of actors are playing dress-up around some renovated landmarks: everything looks a bit too staged and everybody looks a bit too clean. Where actual filming is concerned, the movie has two kinds of camera angles: clich&eacute;d ones and bad ones. In other words, if it's not a slow-motion shot of a horse's hooves galloping through a puddle, it's a shot so wide that it would fit into a documentary about the Savannah. The ""shaky camera"" effect is employed ad nauseum: while some films benefit from the mood and tension such a technique can instill, the impression ""Deliverance"" gave me is that the crew was simply too lazy to set up a tripod.

Natassia Malthe looks cool in her outfit, but she doesn't hold a candle to Kristanna Loken's original performance (how sad is that?), and the special effects are pitiful. If I had to praise one aspect, it would be Par&eacute;'s performance, which is acceptable given his immersion into the B-movie genre, but don't bank on him saving the movie. The only reasons that you would need to see this is if you enjoyed the prequel or if you have the same fascination that Boll apparently had about seeing vampires and the wild west mixed. I can't recommend it to anyone.",1222646400,,3980,6.165765765765766
2884002,1,B000SAGGSC,"This is a train wreck.  I can't even get into how bad this movie is.  If you thought the first was bad enough because it made no sense in the Bloodrayne universe, this one is ten times worse.  Usually I don't mind terrible movies from time to time because they at least have an unintentional comedy factor due to absurdity; this happened in the first one quite a bit.  This really doesn't happen at all during the second one.  In fact I'm simply in shock that Uwe Boll was commissioned to do a second installment of Bloodrayne.  The story was so completely botched that I can't believe another film was allowed to be made.  I truly hope this is the end for Bloodrayne's stint on the big screen (or should I say direct to DVD specials).

This is a Wild West Bloodrayne story.  That's right... you heard me... Wild West.  At this point you just have to accept the fact that this happened before Rayne was technically supposed to be around.  You just have to accept the fact how bad this story premise is in its own right.  Okay... whoever said ""wouldn't it be cool to see Rayne fight against Billy the Kid, but if Billy was a vampire.""  Should have been shot.  They should've stopped that person right there and said ""please leave the room... now.""  Obviously that didn't happen because here we are and you're reading my review.  Basically this revolves around the story of Billy the Kid waltzing into a town, essentially taking it over with his gang and turning people into vampires etc.  He holds the town hostage by kidnapping everyone's children.  Interesting move.  Anyway, Rayne is going to step in and take him down, only after she finds some completely random ally's to help her out.  Some of which never even get names, like ""The Preacher.""  He's one of the good guys on her ""special"" team and that's seriously his name in the credits.  Clearly a lot of thought went into this film.  How they find these extra people is never explained either... it's just terrible with no depth at all.

The least redeeming quality of this film is its lack of unintentional comedy.  Usually when films get this bad they tend to generate a few chuckles from me at how bad or absurd a scene is.  But this film doesn't even do that.  The closest it gets is that whenever someone important dies the death is automatically in slow motion!  Kind of like the video game, but way more lame for some reason.  It was a lot cooler in the game.  Also, maybe it's just me, but it always felt like the camera was shaking... I don't know if anyone else noticed, but it was horribly annoying.  Okay, I still can't get over how bad this script is.  Now I certainly do not mind the use of profanity or vulgar concepts.  Seriously, look at the other things I've reviewed.  But when vulgarity and profanity is forced for no apparent reason it just comes out bad.  There's simply no tact or wit.  I know, I know... we're talking about an Uwe Boll film based around Rayne in a Wild West adventure that makes nose sense, but d**mnit I want my profanity to be worthwhile!

I know this is going to sound weird, but the one good part of this film is actually Zack Ward's performance as Billy the Kid... probably because he played the role as more of an elite vampire rather than a cowboy.  If he could get caste in a Bloodrayne movie as a real vampire villain he'd do pretty well.  At that point they'd have to get a suitable writer (*cough* hire one of the guys that wrote the video game *cough*) and also get a suitable girl to play the role of Rayne.  Speaking of which Natassia Malthe was actually a worse Bloodrayne than Kristanna Loken.  I know that sounds pretty messed up because Loken's performance wasn't anything exciting.  Maybe Malthe would've been better in the first film, because it felt like she was better at acting out some of the combat scenarios where Loken felt insanely awkward in the first movie.  Malthe was also way to passive, she didn't have that ultra aggressive quality you'd expect from Rayne.  In the end we still haven't found the right girl to play Rayne.  Speaking of changing things around, seriously, we need a new director.  Maybe we should commission James Cameron to make up for the horrid first two films, since I clearly have no budget to think of here.  I think Rayne could be successful on the big screen for fans of the game and non-fans alike if they'd just make it a bigger production.  As a character Rayne's even more interesting than Selene in Underworld.  Don't get me wrong... Kate Beckinsale is an infinitely better actress in this role than anyone that has been in BloodRayne.  Selene is a cool character concept, but in some regards Rayne is a little cooler in my opinion.  Underworld is a good example of a large scale production Vampire movie that works.  (Not the sequel so much, but the first was great!)

Before I finish this up, I seriously have to ask.  Why were vampires dying by regular bullets in this movie?  They made special note that you needed bullets blessed with holy water and so on to kill the vampires... yet at the end the regular town folk using their guns shot and killed a few vampires.  Not to mention... Billy the Kid was ultimately killed by a Gatlin gun with regular bullets.  This makes NO sense.  None at all.  He shouldn't even be dead.  They even say in the film he can get shot and he'll heal without even drinking blood.  Seriously, this script writer was an idiot.  It's like he forgot halfway through the movie what was written in the first half.  They need to hire someone that's an expert in continuity to explain how flow works...

Alright, I'll stop ranting and wrap this up.  If you're familiar with the video game or the comic books you're going to hate this movie.  The game and comics at least work into the same time frame and same fantasy universe, but the movies are doing something completely different.  The only similarity is Rayne's blades and the ones in the movie aren't even designed the same way, not to mention her costumes aren't even the same in the movies.  The one other interesting thing on here is they have a ""video comic"" available.  Basically you can read through the issue of ""Tibetan Heights"" and at that point realize you'd rather be reading the comic than watching the movie.  I'm surprised the comic publisher agreed to put their quality product on here.  Maybe they figure the movie is so bad they'll get more sales when theirs is better.  Unfortunately ""Tibetan Heights"" isn't exactly the first in the series, but it's one of the better issues in my opinion.  That's really all I have to say about this movie.  As a director's cut they should've just cut out the entire movie and left us with the video game that comes with it.  At least the video game is better... a LOT better.",1219536000,,6771,4.511934156378601

It has a good cast and some good production design, but it is very shallow, poorly directed, and kind of awkward.  There are a few good moments, but the only real good thing is that it has lots of blood and sex, and would be good to pop in if I feel a sudden impulse to see so much senseless violence.

BloodRayne 2 (1 star out of 5):
Downright boring! There is hardly any violence or sex in it.  The new cast is terrible (except for the bad guy, played by Zach Ward), and the movie suffers even worse from having terrible cameramanship.  The only redeemable quality in this one are a few memorable lines (which I can't even remember) and a few nifty gunfights.  Still, wouldn't reccomend this one much to anybody.

Computer Games (5 stars out of 5):
Downright awesome! They have engaging stories, pretty good characters, and very interactive gameplay.  The graphics are smashing.  Not to mention, enough bucketloads of blood and loads of partial-nudity to make the experience very wicked.

Overall, the movies are bad, but the first one is good if you're looking for low-quality blood-and-guts action (kind of like a Stewart Gordon movie).

2884014,2,B000SAGGSC,"Based on a computer/console video game franchise developed by Terminal Reality, BLOODRAYNE 2: DELIVERANCE doesn't quite pick up after the first BloodRayne movie. Several hundred years have passed, and Rayne seems to have become a cowboy, er, cowgirl, in the meantime. Maybe a bounty hunter. I'm not quite sure because it was never revealed. With the time jump, the franchise gets even more convoluted and - to a degree - confusing.

Rayne is a dhampir, a cross between a vampire and a human, and her father was a Vampire King. In the original video game, Rayne was battling Nazis, and those are supposed to be the villains in the third movie. The sequel video game, which is included with the DVD to up the value packaging of the film, takes place in the present.

As it turns out, Rayne (Natassia Malthe) has come hunting Billy the Kid (Zack Ward) because, as everyone knows, Billy the Kid is a vampire hundreds of years old. She ends up riding with Pat Garrett (Michael Pare), who is a member of the Brimstone Society, the group of vampire hunters that's been around for hundreds of years.

Billy the Kid has ridden into the small town of Deliverance where he hopes to turn the children into vampires in time to take over the area. A train is about to start coming through the town and he'll have access to rapid transportation for his vampire gunslingers. Unfortunately for him, two of the kids he's captured were the children of Rayne's friends.

There's no way to know how or when Rayne got to meet these friends, but she has them. As soon as she knows that Billy the Kid's responsible for the deaths of the parents and the capture of the children, she rides off to mete out justice. She also meets Pat Garrett, who is hot on the trail of Billy the Kid himself. He offers to join forces, but - of course - she passes on that.

In Deliverance, it doesn't take Rayne long to get into more trouble than she can handle. She's quickly overcome and tossed into jail to be hung later.

The movie, even though it was billed as a horror-Western, really weighs in more heavily as a Western. The dialogue and the plot's movements and pacing pretty much mirror every B Western movie ever filmed. The hero confronts the villain, has to escape and regroup, then go out to recruit a group to come back and storm the villain's stronghold.

There's not much plot here, and even less character building. Thankfully Malthe can carry the barely-there costume and looks good doing martial arts. For some reason, though, the costume on the DVD cover actually looks more skimpy than the one she wears in the movie, and I honestly had to wonder if the DVD cover costume was just airbrushed in.

If you're not expecting much from the film, and I wasn't wanting anything more than a diversion with some martial arts mayhem, gunplay, snappy dialogue, and a hawt heroine, you'll probably get your money's worth. This is a DVD to sit down with your buddies with over a bowl of popcorn and prepare to lampoon the plot, the predictability, the pacing, and the characterization. That's what you do with campy horror movies.

I liked some of the look of the film. There were parts that had an edgy otherworldliness to them that worked. But even that was cheapened by the weak theatrics. One of the best parts was the trap Billy the Kid set for Rayne when he had the kids she'd come to save strung up from nooses. (Even that stretched credulity, though, because then you had to ask yourself why he'd go to all the trouble if he knew she was coming back. Why not set a better trap to kill her before she even got back into Deliverance?)

Unfortunately, both the beginning of the film and the end of it have fuzzy footage. I don't know what caused that, but it looks like straight footage you'd get off an ill-focused handheld video camera. I was entirely too aware of a film being shot and thinking how I would have tried to fix that than to enjoy the scenes.

This is director Uwe Boll's fourth movie adaptation, after ALONE IN THE DARK and HOUSE OF THE DEAD. Boll, and his projects, have all been the subject of heated discussion. There are plans for a third BloodRayne movie in the works.",1193443200,20,4161,4.527296937416778

2884016,1,B000SAGGSC,"I read the reviews before I rented it and still rented it wanting to see for myself if it was really that bad - and it was.  After having watched the first one I kind of wanted to see the second.

At best I can say that it was boring.  I didn't think they introduced anything new - kind of the same old same old.  Pretty much the first 30 minutes didn't have my full attention and even towards the end I looked at the time to see how close to the ending it was.

Acting not at it's best, not the best written script and at time the characters in the movie seemed for lack of a better way of putting it wussy.  I don't feel there were truths where there should have been - people's reactions and that sort of thing.  I understand that it's a fiction movie - but people's reactions shouldn't be too far off from what they would be in real life - still need a sense of real emotion and this movie does not do that at all.

Overall not the best movie - for sure not a keeper.  If you are looking into watching this movie rent it - don't buy it.",1191888000,,1040,3.937799043062201
2884017,1,B000SAGGSC,"Ok I admit I have BloodRayne so I wanted the second one.  I will watch a ""B"" movie; sometimes they aren't bad.
I have to say this is a great way to get your kids to clean their room... force them to watch the first 5 minutes and they will beg you to let them go.
The guy holding the camera was worse than the one in Blair Witch.  The directer I think just came from the porn business (although there is NO nudity in this film) (that could have improved it).  The actors... well a second grader is MUCH better (Michael Pare' what happened to you).
The only somewhat good screen was the one fight screen between Rayne and Billy the Kid.",1191542400,,634,4.138211382113822
2884028,1,B000SAGGSC,"I am a huge fan of the video game. Rayne is a great character and the game story line entertaining. To my disappointment nothing that I enjoyed about the game has translated with the films. The first is barely passable as a film. It was still a dog, but showed that with better acting and action, the promise of a great film translation.
The second film fails on every point made above. It is worst if that is possible then the first. Acting is very very poor. The storyline is boring to tears.
It is sad that what could have been great films have been butchered so badly. If you are a fan of the games, beware you will be extremely disappointed with the second film. Truly one of the worst films I have ever seen. Some day I hope someone gives Rayne the film treatment she deserves.",1191196800,2,783,4.297297297297297
2884029,1,B000SAGGSC,"The first BloodRayne was fine and dandy; it had plenty of blood, action, and sex to keep it entertaining, even if it was a bad movie.  I hoped that this would have much of the same, but I was very dissapointed.

The Good Things:
-Zach Ward (dude from ""Titus"") makes a good bad guy
-Slow motion gunfighting looks nifty
-A few memorable lines...I think...

The Bad Things:
-As I said above, it has none of the bloody action or sex that made the first one fun
-In fact, it has hardly any action at all.  It's boring!
-It doesn't feel right as a western.  The medieval setting worked better
-Cameramanship is terrible (they shook it way too much)
-I don't know how historically accurate any of this is (probably not...but you wouldn't be watching this for quality work anyway!)
-There are lots of stereotypes
-Natassia Malthe looks great, but she doesn't really portray an appealing character.  All she does is act tough, and it feels like a contrive effort.  Kristanna Loken did better at Rayne.

It's pretty crummy.  If you even liked the first film, or if you like westerns or horror or both, rent this and see how bad it is for yourself.

This package makes up for it by supplying the first computer game (I like to think that I bought the game and it came with a free movie).  A few other special features include a digital comic book (which is just a scanned comic that you navigate through and read), deleted scenes (which look quite raw), a commentary, and interviews.",1191024000,7,1472,4.537878787878788
2884030,4,B000SAGGSC,"I really enjoyed the first film and this one is just as good. Fans of the video game series will also enjoy this film. People slam it because it has Uwe Boll on it, ignore that. This is far better than it is getting credit for.",1190678400,4,227,3.9565217391304346
2884031,1,B000SAGGSC,"I'll make plain and simple, the mistake with both BloodRayne films is that the producers and director of ""The House of the Dead"", which was a piece of sh** was allowed to put their hands on this video game to movie project.",1190678400,2,223,4.333333333333333
2884032,1,B000SAGGSC,"At least Uwe/Ewe/Oo-Eee didn't use Romanian hookers in this one. Why make this film? The plot is silly (Billy the Kid?? Reallyy?? There was a film called Billy the Kid versus Dracula, maybe that's where this idea came from?), the fight scenes are terrible and the acting is truly horrible.

The game is fun, skip this mess and play the game instead.",1190678400,2,349,4.629032258064516

Do yourself a big favor and save your money and an hour and a half of your life which could be better spent by picking up dog poo in the park. Do the movie industry and uwe boll a favor by not buying it which maybe will finally force uwe boll to find something to do that he is actually good at, but keep him away from any movie making.. This was another tragedy concocted by boll. another movie that I believe could be good with many sequels if they had just let someone make it besides boll..he is the worst...do not buy or watch this...I repeat!!

2884035,1,B000SAGGSC,"Everyone should know that UWE BOLL is the WORLD'S WORST FILM-MAKER. His movies are worse than direct-to-DVD films. Now that you have that knowlege, let me divulge to you that you should STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE or any Boll flick. If you've had the wonderful opprotunity to not watch the first Bloodrayne, well, here's another time to not watch the sequel. Uwe Boll can't make films and this movie shows it. The action is well...not choreographed, the actor's are not even acting, prostitues are hired as extras and there is little or no story. Oh and more thing, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE VIDEO GAMES! Boll's films are mostly game-to-movie adaptaions but they're never based on the game. So, in short STAY AWAY FROM UWE BOLL FILMS!!! YOU'LL LIVE A BETTER LIFE!",1189987200,5,765,4.674074074074074
2884036,4,B000SAGGSC,"The title of the film is ""Bloodrayne 2"" but this film is more of a western.  It's not ""3:10 to Yuma"" but then that film doesn't have model Natassia Malthe wearing black leather and sporting two Colt 45's and two huge swords.  ""3:10 to Yuma"" also doesn't have some of the beautiful winter visuals seen in ""Bloodrayne 2"", which was filmed in Vancouver.  There are plenty of shoot-outs and gunplay and a few opportunities for Rayne to use her swords.  Actually the vampire themes seem to be a natural extension of the violence of the wild west, or at least the wild west as seen in Italian spaghetti westerns.  This film also includes some violence toward children, which is something that also appeared in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and the disappointing third ""Pirates of the Caribbean"".  Apparently cruelty towards children is no longer taboo in films.",1189900800,9,843,4.819444444444445
