4962633,5,B0067EKY7M,This movie is the feel great movie of 2012.  There are several plot twists involving love and politics which keep the viewer engaged in the film.  The acting is superb!  I give this movie five stars and an A+ rating.  I am going to buy the blu-ray when it comes out and highly recommend you do the same!,1333324800,11,303,4.172413793103448
4962634,3,B0067EKY7M,"About halfway through just saying the lengthy title and it becomes clear Salmon Fishing in the Yemen isn't going to be your typical romantic comedy. Can it even be called a romantic comedy? There is a central love story, but it's mostly between an eccentric, visionary Sheik(Amr Waked) and his love of fly fishing. So much so that he hatches a screwball plan to bring it to the desert highlands of Yemen. His reasons are grandiose and noble, even if the reality of it borders on impossibility. Doesn't really sound like something to take your girlfriend to on date night, does it? Are we sure this isn't some Werner Herzog documentary or something?

Balancing a healthy dose of quirky romance with a touch of political gamesmanship, director Lasse Hallstrom(Chocolat)  trims down the disparate elements of Paul Torday's novel into a film that only manages to succeed on the strength of its amazing leads. Ewan McGregor buttons up his natural charm as Dr. Alfred Jones, a dull, married fisheries expert with an inflated sense of his unimportant government job becomes embroiled in the Sheik's ridiculous plot by a publicity seeking press secretary(Kristin Scott Thomas) for the British Prime Minister. Unhappy at home with a loveless marriage, and now forced into a job he doesn't care for, Alfred has little reason placate the sheik's chosen representative, the optimistic Harriet(Emily Blunt), who has a mouthful of a last name that becomes a running joke unto itself.  Suffering as her new boyfriend was recently called to fight in Iraq, she is thrown into her work as a means of coping.

Lacking any sort of narrative momentum, the film isn't helped by an uneven script by the usually reliable Simon Beaufoy(Slumdog Millionaire). The very niche hobby of fly fishing isn't all that exciting on its own, in fact the very point of it seems to be the opposite of that. So you can imagine how engrossing it is to listen to McGregor discussing the different varieties of fishing lures, or if salmon taken from captivity will travel in the right direction. A missed opportunity was had with Thomas's character, as she steals the show when on screen with her boorish, invasive attitude. The film often veers into darker territory than such a light and airy comedy was built to handle, especially as the Sheik's own followers violently reject his plans to transform their homeland. The Sheik's reliance on faith to carry him through the difficult project is met with philosophical resistance by Alfred, a man of pure science. Their debates are brief, but provide some of the film's best moments of insight.

It's the awkward, budding relationship between Alfred and Harriet that keeps the film afloat, as McGregor and Blunt have a chemistry together that is obvious even if their characters aren't that interesting individually. Starting out a bit chilly with Alfred's stuffy demeanor, they slowly build a bond through the improbability of their task, and the desire to see the Sheik's dream of achieving international harmony. As their familiarity with one another grows, and Alfred stops acting like a stuffed shirt, the two become a joy to watch. Amr Waked, one of the biggest stars in all of Egypt who recently appeared in Steven Soderbergh's Contagion, makes for an impressive and charismatic presence.

The disparate plot elements never quite coalesce into a satisfying whole, even as McGregor and Blunt prove to be irresistible. While not a complete success, there's something to be said about a film that dares to swim against the tide.",1332288000,2,3538,4.99830220713073
4962635,3,B0067EKY7M,"Sugary snacks sneak into many of our diets because immediate gratification trumps the fact that nutritionally there's not much there.  Salmon Fishing is a cinematic sugar snack that will please most viewers with its sunny, sandy optimism and pleasant leading characters with nary a dark side among them.  Yes, some nasty terrorists show up, and a few humans and fish lose their lives, but this movie pushes on with its gentle, sentimental tones to a place we all know it's headed from the get-go (romantic happiness and professional success in the Arabian peninsula).  Premised almost like a 1930s screwball comedy (and acted by Kristin Scott-Thomas as if she'd been cast in one), the movie unfortunately has far less comic energy (this Salmon's a low-carb snack).  The story takes its sweet time to get to the Yemen and other plot-point destinations, and isn't afraid of melodramatic twists and turns.  But it offers enough emotion and good performances to render a mild sugar high.  Like most simple sugars, however, the effect's not long lasting.",1332201600,5,1049,5.069767441860465
4962636,4,B0067EKY7M,"If you're going to see this delightful movie, the first thing you need to do is to shut down your critical faculties.  Don't ask questions about the state of Ewan McGregor's marriage, or the logic of moving thousands of salmon, or the likelihood of a woman hugging an Arab sheikh in a Muslim country, or the ease with which people travel long distances, and so forth.  It doesn't matter because the gentle tone of the movie - even with the satirical edge of Kristin Scott Thomas' extremely obnoxious but funny Assistant to the Prime Minister - just carries you away.  It's sweet, it's charming, it's not cloying and it definitely draws you in to the story.  This is the first movie I've been in a long time where the character of a Scot is a key plot element.  [What was the name of the wonderful one years ago with Peter  Resier (?) and Burt Lancaster as Texans looking for oil off the cost of Scotland?]  Ewan McGregor gets to use his own Scots accent and is just wonderful and appealing in his role.  Emily Blunt is also good, as she rolls with the plot.

If you're in the mood for a lovely, gently comic, romantic movie, this is the one.",1332028800,73,1141,4.395238095238096
4962637,4,B0067EKY7M,"This one did snag me with a lure most appealing. Be forewarned that this 2012 romantic dramedy is idiosyncratic and full of whimsy, which should come as no surprise as the director is Lasse Hallstrm whose most successful films (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chocolat/dp/B004SIP6BI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chocolat</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cider-House-Rules/dp/B005DCJ1J6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cider House Rules</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Life-as-a-Dog/dp/B000087EY5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Life as a Dog</a>) turn on flights of fancy. Besides, it's certainly not every romantic comedy that encompasses hydro-engineering, environmentalism, Middle East tensions, and British populism. What holds these disparate subjects together is the pipe dream one Yemeni sheikh has to bring salmon fishing to the wadis of his homeland. Adapted by Simon Beaufoy (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slumdog-Millionaire/dp/B001UEBHYS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slumdog Millionaire</a>) from a popular&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2006-Brit-lit-book/dp/0156034565/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2006 Brit-lit book</a>&nbsp;by Paul Torday, the story primarily concerns the two people who get caught up in Sheikh Muhammad's dream - tweedy fisheries expert Dr. Alfred Jones, Fred to everyone who knows him, and super-efficient public relations consultant Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.

They are enlisted by Patricia Maxwell, the hell-on-heels press officer for the British prime minister who is desperate for a feel-good distraction from the bloodshed occurring in Afghanistan. She is immediately drawn to the human interest angle of the salmon fishing story as well as the revelation that there are at least two million anglers in the U.K. Fred thinks the idea is ridiculous and for good reason - the plan is to build a dam (which looks as big as Hoover Dam), construct an elaborate irrigation system, and stock the waters with 10,000 North Atlantic salmon, all for the hefty price tag of fifty million pounds. Alas, Fred gradually succumbs to the deeply spiritual nature and ecological sensibilities of the sheikh's quest as well as Harriet's quiet persistence and demure charms. Complicating matters is the fact that Fred is unhappily married, while Harriet is getting serious with a handsome soldier who gets shipped to Afghanistan.

Given the attractive leads, the romantic sparks are not surprising, but their cautious relationship and soulful connection provide much of the movie's unforced charm. The more fanciful events in the last half-hour do bring a level of incredulity for which Hallstrm has become renowned, and the terrorist subplot is woefully underdeveloped relative to the love story. However, the actors in exchange deliver nicely turned performances with Ewan McGregor (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beginners/dp/B0060M9T9U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beginners</a>) at his most modestly suppressed as Fred.

Kristin Scott Thomas (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-English-Patient/dp/B0064MT1QW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The English Patient</a>) easily steals all her scenes as Maxwell with acidic panache, while Amr Waked (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Syriana/dp/B000HF6XKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Syriana</a>) brings a charismatic calm to the sheikh.

4962638,3,B0067EKY7M,"Fred Jones (Ewan McGregor) is a scientist who specializes in fish. When he's contacted by Harriet Chetwode-Talbot (Emily Blunt) about her boss Sheikh Muhammad (Amr Waked) wanting to bring salmon to the Yemen, Fred scoffs at the project and flat out turns them down. Through some convincing and with his job on the line, Fred eventually agrees to try to bring salmon to the Yemen. Despite the uphill battle, Fred discovers that Sheikh isn't quite as crazy as he imagined and Fred begins to look at Harriet as more than just a fellow colleague.

Many may view Salmon Fishing in the Yemen as a witty comedy; at least as far as the first half is concerned. To be honest though, it generally irritated me for a good forty five minutes or so. Nearly everyone on-screen came off as a bunch of annoying twits, especially Ewan McGregor and Kristin Scott Thomas. The comedy wasn't funny either. It was like a string of snarky remarks that were nothing more than obnoxious. Emily Blunt is the only character who really had charm and likeability. Blunt is basically the only person that feels human. Being forced to listen to stuffy and uptight people drone on and on isn't my idea of entertainment or comedy. Did anyone reading this watch ""Scrubs""? You know how Dr. Cox's (John C. McGinley) rants were funny in small doses, but got on your last nerve if there were too many of them in one episode or if they went on for too long? The feeling is similar to how Salmon Fishing in the Yemen will affect you.

Once the Sheik is introduced though, it's as if that unlikeable layer is washed away. All of the snooty characters loosen up a bit and pull the stick out of their rear end. Suddenly a man who was looked at as being out of his mind is the only one speaking logically. Fred begins to warm up to the idea of bringing salmon fishing to an area that seems unlikely. The flaws he makes and the triangle that develops between him, Harriet, and her boyfriend Robert (Tom Mison) are essentially the heart of the film. The salmon fishing becomes secondary.

What's interesting is the first half of the film can be looked at as a straight comedy (this can be debated for some) and the second half is more of this dramatic romantic comedy. Some of the best dialogue of the film happens when Fred and Harriet show up in the Yemen after Sheik has started bringing water to the middle of the desert. They pass a group of people praying and Fred says, ""I don't think I know anyone who goes to church."" Harriet replies, ""Me neither."" Fred pauses before saying, ""On Sunday, we go to Target."" The humor is pretty dry throughout the film, but feels like it doesn't really hit its mark until the second half.

Salmon Fishing in the Yemen wasn't the best movie to sit through. A good portion of the film got under my skin, but then it got a bit easier to tolerate before actually becoming halfway decent. The film features some beautiful cinematography with incredibly green scenery and this amazing perspective in the water almost as if you're seeing through the eyes of a fish. Once the majority of the characters stop being such uptight douchebags, they're actually very warm in an almost enchanting sense. Salmon Fishing in the Yemen actually has a pretty powerful message at its core and a philosophy that just about everyone could learn from.",1331337600,2,3321,4.576470588235294
4962639,5,B0067EKY7M,"Just saw this last night (early screening), and though I went in with doubt, it was wonderful! There were just 200 people in the screening, but from how much and loudly we all laughed, it could have been far more.  Applause at the end was well-deserved. It may weaken my review, but I'm trying so, so hard to avoid spoilers... There are moments everyone deserves to see with fresh eyes, not knowing what will happen.

It builds... you meet the characters, get little insights into their lives, and then, there it is, a whole world of reasons to laugh, as people are put in positions where they have little choice but to pursue the sheikh's desire to fish in the desert... and face personal decisions about love, and love of life...

Honestly, as 'distant' from my life as the premise may seem, it's utterly relatable to my general experience with corporations and government, yet removed enough to be pure fun, to just laugh at, and feel a warmth for the characters who are (rightly) frustrated, yet make the best of each situation.

It's humor in words and meanings, in situations... Overall, the film is uplifting and good, something we could all use more of.

I've added this movie to my wish list and am eager to own it so that I can watch it for laughs and for when I just want to feel better. Between now and the DVD, I look forward to paying to see it in the theater, because it's a movie I'll be proud to support, and grateful to see again.",1331251200,5,1448,4.449056603773585
4962640,4,B0067EKY7M,"The Yemen is a river in the country of Yemen, which occupies the south-western corner of the Arabian Peninsula. As we know, that entire middle-eastern area is hot, dry, and arid. In this Lasse Halstrom-directed dramedy, an oil-billionaire sheik from Yemen owns several estates in Scotland and has developed a fondness for fly fishing. He dreams of a way to bring the sport to his homeland and at the same time encourage his fellow countrymen to upgrade their way of life with an improved water supply.

We loved this cast (mostly) from the UK:
  * Emily Blunt (""The Devil Wears Prada"") is the first person contacted by the sheik. Her job is to research the practicality of the idea and make a recommendation. To complicate matters, her fianc is soon reported missing in (military) action in Afghanistan.
  * Ewan McGregor (""Beginners"") is a mid-level bureaucrat with a touch of Asperger's who loves fly fishing on weekends. When approached about the feasibility of this experiment, he makes outlandish demands, assuming that their cost will deter these foolish people. He is struck dumb when his demands are met, e.g., the engineers who designed the Three Gorges Dam in China.
  * Kristen Scott Thomas (""Nowhere Boy"") is a blunt, plain-spoken government official who can see the public relations advantages for news from the Mid-east that doesn't include the escalating price of petroleum or body bags. She is hilarious in this (initially) preposterous plot and provides many laugh-out-loud moments. You will LOVE her e-mails!
  * Amr Waked (""The Father and the Foreigner"") is the fabulously wealthy sheik with the dream. It's obvious that he is intelligent and has already studied the situation. When our troubled heroine denies she is anxious, he says, ""I have too many wives not to know when a woman is upset!"" We can see why this actor is a heartthrob in his native Egypt.
  * Tom Mison (""One Day"") is our heroine's fianc, loving, considerate AND handsome!

I haven't read Paul Torday's novel on which this film is based, but knowing salmon are anadromous, I suspect the migration to salt water would be too hot and arduous, so I personally had reservations about feasibility. On the other hand, this film had far more comedy than we expected and was far more touching as well, so eventually it didn't matter. I even got goosebumps when that fish turned around and started upstream. Nice surprise!

Watched this one a while back but it popped up on my screen and I thought I should rate it out of love for a delightful little modern tale of heroes and heroins. As with any good story they achieve an impossible dream for the greater good, and find each other in the process.  It is just too bad with the obligatory bedroom scenes although by today's standards they were quite tame.  The points they illustrated in the bedroom could have been made in clever and not so lazy ways. We could have found out some other way that Ewan was in a bad marriage; that Blunt found his presence comforting--well, Ok that one was very chaste and sweet, he just comforted her, but why in bed? There were also other more intelligent ways to tell us that she felt misunderstood and alienated from her lost-and-found boyfriend.  All in all, an uplifting little fable (As an aside, I was amused to learn that thousands of American tourists have tried to find ""that place"" where they introduced salmon into the Yemen! That we could think such place exists is a credit to the movie and to the magic of storytelling. BTW, the Yemen scenes were filmed in Africa).",1516060800,,1172,4.514150943396227

I don't even fish, and suddenly I'm thinking a dark, roomy tent in the yemen with a carved wood bed and five hundred count sheets sounds like a lovely getaway. I wonder if the Sheik needs an assistant? Perhaps a PR writer? While the premise isn't in the least realistic, the conversation about faith versus science was charming and engaging. It is a good point that in order to believe in scientific unlikelihood, one kind of must pretend to believe in miracles for a moment. I enjoyed the footage of the fly fishing, and I do think standing in waders in the middle of cool rushing waters is a bit like mystical prayer. I can't wait to try it out...

Also the girl leaving her boyfriend who had gone missing in action in the gulf. He returned but she still left him for this married man. Sorry for the spoiler but this ruined the movie for me.

4962702,1,B0067EKY7M,"Typical idiotic British humor, peppered with the seemingly relentless, blitheringly mindless cliches.
Although an interesting premise, the film quickly loses traction by suckering us with McGregor's worst (over)acting performances ever, possibly only considered marginal when compared to Scott-Thomas' hyperbolically awful, and terribly dis-likable, portrayal of what we must imagine is the archetypal female British visage of modern success.
This film might make a solid example for eliminating the Director entirely, as the story is completely sabotaged, if not aborted, by weaselly, dumpy and spineless male characters combined with oh-so amazingly competent, professional and effective, if abhorrently revolting, female characters.
Prior to this garbage, I thought so much more of McGregor and Kristen Scott-Thomas. I hope they both made their yacht payments with this effusively horrid implosion of their collective talents.

4962902,3,B0067EKY7M,"(What's with Ewan McGregor and fish movies?)  Unlike some reviewers I had no problem with the salmon fishing in Yemen premise.  Novel, fun, why not?  No more unbelievable than a good science fiction story.  What I found unbelievable is that Harriet would be so attached to her military boy friend having known him only 3 weeks.  She works for years, presumably with the dashing, lovable, Ewan McGregor on this monumental, against-all-odds endeavor together, yet she pines for someone she had maybe 10-20 encounters with.  Why not have their relationship a little richer?  The plot gets thin in other areas as well, like the flash flood from turning a couple valves at the dam, the way the whole thing wrapped up real quick in about 10 minutes with Robert returning, the fish surviving, and Harriet choosing Fred.  Maybe it would have been better to have filmed the story more like Ewan's other fish story, Big Fish, completely in fantasy land with special effects, keeping the audience wondering what is real and what is not.  Still, a fun movie, and upbeat.",1477267200,,1058,4.865921787709497

What may be considered as no big deal to some or over-looked completely, the fact that Fred went through with his breakup with Mary even when he didn't think he would get the ""other girl"" showed a lot of integrity.  Not the typical I found a better deal scenario.  As for the acting, everyone was very believable in their roles.",1476921600,,406,4.611111111111111

4962907,4,B0067EKY7M,"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen is one of those movies that I had wanted to see after enjoying the coming attractions at the theater.  Unfortunately, I failed to go and then forgot about it until recently.  Currently streaming on Amazon Prime for free is this entertaining romantic comedy with a core topic of salmon fishing.  Salmon Fishing in the Yemen.

Its fresh thanks to the fantastic lineup of Ewan McGregor, Emily Blunt, Kristin Scott Thomas, Tom Mison, and others.  The basic story revolves around Sheikh Muhammed from Yemen who loves to salmon fish and wishes to bring the sport to his country.

Harriet, played by Emily Blunt, is the Sheikhs representative in the UK tasked with finding the talent to bring it to pass.  Ewan McGregor plays Dr. Alfred Jones, a fisheries expert, who is approached about the project.  Of course, at first, the idea is ludicrous because of the logistics and climate so he initially declines.

Because the government needs something warmhearted for PR regarding their relationship with Arab nations, he is pressured by the Prime Ministers PR representative to make it happen.  After Dr. Jones finally meets the Sheikh, who also owns an estate in Scotland (which you will immediately recognize as being the Ardverikie House used in Monarch of the Glen), Dr. Jones honestly conveys to him the challenge.  However, the Sheikh, whose personality is extremely likable, tells Dr. Jones who has no religion to have faith.  Cost is no object, and he immediately funds the project with $50,000,000.

The story, of course, is a romantic comedy that pulls at the heartstrings.  Harriet is in love with Captain Robert Mayers (played by Tom Mison), and Dr. Jones is married to a woman with a demanding career and they are childless.  At first, their relationship as colleagues turns into a friendship, but because of their circumstances, during the progression of the story, emotions and life decisions redirect their affections toward each other.

I really enjoyed this movie because of the endearing characters, humor, and an underlying theme that nothing is impossible if you believe in spite of the movie not being religiously bias in any way.

If you haven't seen it, check it out.  You won't be sorry even if you're not into salmon fishing.",1476748800,3,2269,4.973474801061008

4962919,3,B0067EKY7M,"Demonstration of the Gaelic proverb ""the best laid plans of mice and men gang aft aglae"".  It was quite impressive offering a British salary man the choice between doubling his remuneration or being outplaced (which resignation he ultimately chose to continue the project).  Yemen is unlike the Loonie Tied Studs of Merka where the criminal gang leaders (domestic Sheiks) have stolen every American's lives, liberties, and properties and there is nobody effectively opposing them.  In Yemen there are at least three opposing major groups of humans and portions of the Saudi army engaged in armed combat for control of the resources which the fictional Sheik had ""coming out of his arse"".  While Yemenis brought down the ""salmon fishing"" project simply by opening the flood gates on a dam as shown in the movie, the major criminal gangs in the Loonie Tied Studs (Repuke Lickings and Mock Rats in fundamental agreement about their intents to abrogate the US Constitution Amendments) are supported by naive ""voters"" who validate their criminal destructions of human and civil rights and continue to support them even while their gang licensed medifrauds ""wrongfully kill"" 250,000 citizens per year via one form only of their unprosecuted criminal malpractices.

The leads have no romantic chemistry whatsoever and the plot is highly improbable.

Ewan and Emily are great actors, but NOT great love interests. The cheeky Press Secretary character is even a tad too much to handle.

However, I had a difficult time getting past the ecological issues that were blatantly ignored in the story. The consequences of changing a region's hydrology and ecology on a whim are ignored.

Not to mention the caddisfly report in the beginning of the story suggests that Fred might have some understanding of the habitat this project will disrupt.

It is a movie about life and living --- about birth, discovery, and finding an intended path of life, love, and relationship.

It is food for the soul, one that reminds us that there is so much that we perceive to be impossible, when in actuality, we are capable of so much. We are capable of doing so much and feeling so much and we are capable of changing. It seems to me that many of the movies that we don't hear much about are the movies that we end up holding close to our hearts.

The trailer shows it all: a wonky, slow, project of hope and mild romance, with its own merits, but shy of cinematic brilliance. Average, watchable, feelgood. People who give it more stars may be biased that it's a ""positive story from the Middle East,"" which is rare and welcome, but this tale doesn't seem *quite* equipped to inspire a generation of Euro/merican kids to wake up and get off of the couch any time soon. To its credit, if it had tried to stretch itself that far, it probably wouldn't have succeeded anyway.

4964483,4,B0067EKY7M,"The title was both intriguing and a put off but eventually intrigue won out. Glad it did as I found this to be a Surprising Gem!

A movie about fishing didn't hold much interest for me yet it gave me pause enough to read the description. Don't get me wrong, I like salmon fishing, just couldn't picture watching a movie about it. I'm more of a mystery or action movie fan. Well, Ewan McGregor was in it and since, as I said, I'm more of a mystery or action movie fan, I am familiar with his bady of work so became interested in seeing him in it. Sort of a feeling came over me, if it's good enough for Obi-Wan Kenobi mind set, it's good enough for me. OK, that's a joke but the movie ended up bein very motivating and thought provoking, making some interesting life parells about fish and fishing that I felt gave meat to the movie. It was, dare I say - endearing.

Backing up, I almost stopped watching the movie because the beginning seemed a bit slow - that's the no action part. Well, in fact I did stop watching. But I stream movies using Amazon Prime and next time I turned the TV on it was still up so I thought I'd give it another go. OK, admittedly I've caught McGregor in some of those romantic comedies he's done a good job in, so thought lets see if he can turn this movie around. To my surprise, it is Amr Waked, (someone I never heard of) as Sheikh Muhammed that put their mark on this film. It's also what makes it a gem. I consider his acting Worthy of an Oscar Nomination. He really played his role quite convincingly and a brought a believable balance while showing how many hats we sometimes have to share.
Note: I realized I could actually check to see if he got nominated, sadly no.

Emily was good at her character but I'm a bit sad Mr. Waked was completely overlooked,

I'm quite tired so I hope if my review is ever read it does not turn anyone away from the movie. In my opinion, it is worth watching but save it for a time you can focus a bit on it or you will miss the little thoughtful gems the writer's took the time to provide.",1453680000,,2241,4.194895591647332

4964546,2,B0067EKY7M,"Several friends and family members recommended this movie to me, but I found it to be a really disappointing watch. The story perpetuated cultural stereotypes while making the idea of transporting thousands of animals in an impractical and downright wasteful endeavor seem like something we should all be supporting. Did no one think that the whole premise of the story was problematic? Despite continually attempting to suspend my disbelief so that I could enjoy the story, I felt very little attachment to the characters, particularly Alfred (Ewan McGregor), who was about as interesting as a wet piece of lettuce (and certainly more flaccid). Also, there was a good deal of very basic imagery where the director made artsy attempts to be metaphoric about life and fish - I just thought it seemed trite and unbearably obvious. If you're able to ignore your cultural and environmental conscience, and if you find utterly boring characters endearing, then you just might be able to digest this thoroughly bland film.",1452643200,,1016,5.126506024096385

Friends convinced me it was really a very good film. So, having now watched it, I can also say it is a very good film worth watching for its sensitive relationships between people, love, dedication to an idea however unusual.  It is an enlightening story about a young man who leaves his home because he needs a job and stays because he fell in love with a project, a girl, the desert, its people and the spirituality of its leader.  One wonders why people leave where they are, go far away, and stay happily.  This movie shows why and how.",1448150400,2,697,4.484126984126984

down then this movie is for you.

change the world.

I figured it would be a decent title merely based on the previous work of Emily Blunt and Ewan McGregor, each seem versatile and entertaining. Not knowing much about Yemen, I did find the idea of running Salmon in a river there peculiar and it was interesting to see how each character engaged or resisted the plan/process. The actual story became more about the relationships of the characters and continued to draw me in. Not much action found here, but a proper scattering of drama and comedy made it a good movie for me. Even the supporting cast was good, none of them were out of place and story moved along well with them.
There were hints of generic religion, romance, conflict and failing relationships, none of which were out of place or over bearing. A very good balance of each overall.",1441756800,,856,4.601307189542483

This uplifting story fashions a tale of romance that kindles between Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt's characters as the two work together to develop this improbable project.

Unfortunately the ending is classic Hollywood, based on a contrivance and against pretty much all reason. The high point of the movie has to be the acting of Ewan McGregor, playing somewhat against type as a very tightly wound academic. Emily Blunt is a little too precious in her portrayal of an investment banker. But the supporting cast is mostly strong in their performances. if they could have ended the movie with the challenge posed near the ending, it would have been a much better movie. (SPOILER ALERT) But someone decided that they had to tie up the ending in a big bright happy bow just like every B-movie romance story out there.

Having been to both Yemen and Morocco (where it was actually filmed) a number of times, I found the landscapes breathtaking, as they are in reality. Yemen, in addition to its current problems, is highly tribal, so that part of the story was reasonable, as was using violence to achieve an objective. Yemen is also already suffering critical resource shortages (including water) and it's going to get worse, so a plan to get out of a downward spiral (even if its not salmon...) is desperately needed, if in fact one is available.

Writing, in some ways great, but in some ways doesn't rise above pretty good. Important aspects of the writing that fell short were depth of characterization, how and why were they changed as the story went on, and how rich and deep were the story's themes and their development. But I give the script lots of credit for no overt cheesiness, superficiality, or lack of wit or sensitivity. It's only flawed in that it could have been better.",1426809600,3,553,4.770833333333333

4966587,4,B0067EKY7M,"This movie is about believing in long shots, or as the sheik refers to it, ""faith"".

A wealthy sheik decides to bring fly fishing to the desolate, barren Yemen region. In order to engage in fly fishing you need, well...fish.

The sheik's assistant contacts a grunt at the government fishery to spearhead the project. At first he thinks the idea is total nonsense and a waste of time. As he meets the Sheik, he begins to see his noble logic behind the project and agrees to provide his services. In the mean time, a member of the Prime Minister's staff catches onto the story and decides to use the positive publicity to her advantage.

The unlikely trio (the sheik, his assistant, and the fishery expert) meet one challenge after the next, but decide to keep moving forward in order to see their project through to the end. All the while, the assistant and fishery expert begin developing feelings for one another and find that the project attached them more than they realized.

Will the project work as planned? Will the complicated, relationship between the fishery expert and the assistant work out or fail before it begins? Does the sheik actually have ill intentions by introducing the idea of salmon fishing to the Yemen? Will he make a huge profit and leave the land worse off than he found it?

I chose to watch this as a free movie from Amazon Prime because the title was unique and interesting.  I wasn't disappointed!  I love how the sheikh helped reawaken the spirituality and connectedness of the main people.  Also, you don't often see a deep, caring friendship develop between two main characters before a romance starts, and that is what happens in this film.  It was really touching.

It's always a tear to compare a movie to the book it was based on, but this one certainly used the book as framework and the plot and action were significantly different.

4966971,4,B0067EKY7M,"Clean, unconventional, easy to understand with a solid ending. I enjoyed the witty back and forth. This movie isn't amazing but it was worth it for a Valentime's Day ending. My wife isn't a big fan of all movies but for this one she asked to pause it while she was indisposed. That is a big deal. She isn't interested in period dramams, Sci-Fi or movies backed more than 20 years ago. So, watching a couple fall in love while helping fish spawn in Yemen was worth it. Believe me, the ironic juxtoposition of sex to fish spawning wasn't lost on us.

4966972,5,B0067EKY7M,"I was nervous... The trailer looked ""too good"" for starters. The subject matter? Risky topic to say the least. Ewan McGregor? Well, he has never failed me, so I took a leap of faith regarding this movie.

Essentially the story is about many LEAPS OF FAITH and like all great stories, leaps of faith can create CHAOS when not everyone is on the same page. The movie barely ends well enough which is why I'm giving it 5 stars... Skipping off into the sunset ""Happily ever after"" would have reduced my score to 4 stars (strange. Yes... I know.) But the ending left room for my imagination to wonder about the possibilities for ""What happened next..."" instead of wrapping it up so tightly that I had nothing to think about.

The producers created a movie and also took a leap of faith regarding what is possible in this world. I recommended it to my Mom even though I knew she wasn't going to like it as much as I do... (She prefers chick flicks.)",1423872000,,943,4.413793103448276

4967014,3,B0067EKY7M,"-SPOILERS INCLUDED- Lightweight romantic fantasy about two people meeting while participating in a project to bring salmon farming and fishing to Yemen.  Most of the film is devoted to sprightly dialog between stars Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt, setting up what seems to be an inevitable intense affinity between the two.  Unfortunately, the plot bogs down when the budding relationship between them is derailed by the sudden reappearance of Ms. Blunt's boyfriend, who was presumed missing in action.  His absence fuels the potential personal feelings of Blunt for McGregor as they work together to make the project a success.

Then, in a whoosh of near biblical proportions, the project -which is suddenly portrayed as successful with fish miraculously swimming upstream- is derailed by some faceless cretins with ill intent.  Within 15 minutes onscreen 1) Man effectively ends marriage, 2) Boyfriend reappears, 3) fish project unsuccessful, 4) fish project successful, 5) dam release kills project, 6) boy loses girl, 7) fish reappear, 8) boy wins girl.  It's way too much obvious plotting way too fast and it nearly ruins the film.

Both Blunt and McGregor are a joy to behold and are well matched onscreen.  As a romantic fantasy, ""Salmon"" works on a superficial level, but the clumsy (and terribly obvious) last 15 minutes nearly ruins the film.  Recommended as a light entertainment, however flawed.",1421020800,7,1406,5.241071428571429

She looks at him for most of the film as if she were amused by him, and she's a wonderful enough actress where you can tell in her glances when she begins to consider him differently.

For the western viewer the challenges of government bureaucracy and how powerless people respond, are contrasted with the lack of bureaucracy in the mid-east but much more violent responses of the powerless people who live there.  Despite the best intentions of the government leaders, we see how often the people they govern have little to no input.

4968125,2,B0067EKY7M,"Oh the Rom-Com.  Take one really good idea, add a married blue eyed sandy haired man with cleft chin, adorable nature in a loveless marriage to a woman whose response to sex with him, Ewan McGregor is, well that will keep you for a while.  Add Emily Blunt for the striking lithe beauty who, in spite of being single, has two last names and is precisely the kind of woman who would, instead of dropping one, should she fine herself in a position to get married, gladly add a third to that mouthful.  And lets give her a temporary soldier lover who is conveniently called away for duty.  Put them in an improbable situation.  Populate with insane co-workers, sprinkle with giggles, layer with humor, and set everyone on a path of mutually assured destruction and let the love fun begin and sentence any creative thought or idea to death by asphyxiation.  Such is Salmon Fishing in the Yemen.

The premise is a sheik in Yemen wants to bring salmon fishing to his desert country.  So how do you get salmon to the desert and once there what do you do with them?  Youll have to watch to find out.  Youll meet a scimitar wearing sheik wading in his robes down a river fly fishing and at dinner in his palace he will explain to you how fishing and religion are related.  And it will make perfect sense.  You will notice the sheik setting our two heroes on their romantic journey and you will be rewarded with beautiful scenery.

While its just improbable that a woman who has dated a soldier for 3 weeks would be emotionally destroyed by the news that the guy she had 2 dates with is now MIA but that does allow her to be available to our sadly married hero.  And we just know his wife is probably cheating on him, but just how much fishing did you expect in a rom com?

I cant say this is a great movie.  Its not even that good even though the premise is interesting.  But have I mentioned its a rom com?  It just simply wouldnt matter if it took place against the backdrop of an earth destroying comet or an alien invasion; any interest, excitement and imagination is totally sucked into the black hole of romantic comedy.  There are worse ways to waste an hour twenty.  Not many though.

The whole thing is a contrived, derivative sequence of clichs interspersed with beautiful scenery.  Scenes are constructed to move the story forward as per script writing rules but the writers apparently missed the class on actual human behavior in their zeal to create a world in which all their written scenes can take place.  This is an example of the sum being much less than the total of the parts.  Its just lacking in anything any one of us can take emotionally seriously.

The most interesting character is Patricia Maxwell, press coordinator for the Prime Minister, played by Kristen Scott-Thomas who smokes, curses and treats her family like a platoon while micromanaging the lives of everyone she comes in contact with.  Sublime.  This could have been a grand movie, it could have been the Fitzcaraldo of the 21st century.  But its not.  Its just a yawn from beginning to end.

So in the final analysis, do rent Fitzcaraldo.  Its a 1980-is German film written and directed by Werner Herzog and starring Klaus Kinski as the title character. It portrays would-be rubber baron Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald, an Irishman known as Fitzcaraldo in Peru, who is determined to transport a steamship over a mountain in order to access a rich rubber territory. The film is derived from the historic events of Peruvian rubber baron Carlos Fitzcarrald.  I refer to it as the movie about making ice in the jungle which is just as problematic as salmon fishing in the desert.  But Fitzcaraldo is a wonderful memorable film that is timeless in its spirit and undertaking and you will remember it as long as you live.

4968234,3,B0067EKY7M,I don't recall what year this movie was released. Today it seems that all the movies have an agenda and some are more subtle than others. I'm not positive what the agenda is for this movie. It is not a movie that I would purchase to own and I would not watch it again free via Amazon Prime because it was not the feel good type of movie that you enjoy each time you see it. If I had not seen the movie I wouldn't have missed anything. It's basic and predictable from start to stop. The actors did a decent job portraying their characters but there were no Emmy/Oscar moments at all. They could have taught the audience something about the fly fishing experience or the salmon but instead what they did say about the subject was missing anything that made you glad you know that fact. Wait what did they say about salmon now?  Maybe that info was cut. There were no light hearted moments that made you chuckle or relate to the characters. The parts that were meant to be funny were not.  It was ordinary drivel and killed some time.,1417564800,,1031,4.309278350515464

4968286,2,B0067EKY7M,"If you like romcoms, this one features a set of great performances.  Each individual character is sympathetic and believable, and yet the movie as a whole comes off as less than the sum of its parts.  Maybe it's the nature of the genre - after all, the guy has to get the girl in the end, but this script was just too predictable.  It could use a little less artificial formality at the beginning to knock you over the head, a little more doubt and suspense, something more serious than a three week fling before the boyfriend gets sent off to war.  And for chrissake, don't kill him off just to revive him with a miraculous tale of survival - if anything in the script screeches like fingernails on a chalkboard, that is it.  On the other hand, Amr Waked's sheik and Ewan McGregor's fisheries scientist are pitch-perfect throughout, carrying off wonderfully engaging stories of vision and perseverance without a hitch.

Maybe I'm just grumpy; I can see how some would give it four stars.  But despite the creative and unusual premise and the likeable characters, the movie still felt unsatisfying at the end.",1417478400,,1109,4.685567010309279

4968503,5,B0067EKY7M,"I did love the movie.  Maybe it's flawed here and there, but not enough to distract from a fish story about having just enough faith  to go against the current.  McGregor and Blunt pull off an old fashioned love story in a world that hasn't much faith in it.  I particularly liked the chance to enjoy Amr Waked's character who stands in stark contrast to the caricature of the Arab male.  The language was well crafted and the actors delivered their lines  beautifully.  Kristin Scott Thomas provides a worldly comic relief while Rachel Stirling and Tom Mison give the story a tragic shadow.  If you have a romantic side and maintain a considerate skepticism of nihilism, you might love this hopeful movie too.",1416960000,,710,4.715447154471545

Ewan McGregor is wonderful in the lead role and with his witty dialog and strong supporting cast, delivers a very entertaining story of a very unlikely occurrence.  Building a river in the Yemen desert to stock with salmon so they will spawn, provide fly fishing for the locals, and hopefully bring life and a sense of local comradrie back to the region. That's the dream of a wealthy sheik & he won't give up his dream, no matter what obstacles fall in his way. Enters Fred. A fisheries expert - up for the challenge & a change of pace from his dull existence & boring marriage. How the story unfolds is great, well paced; provides some comic relief from some of the more dramatic scenes. I won't give any spoilers here.

4968638,4,B0067EKY7M,"The premise is somewhat absurd, but perhaps less so than it at first appears.  Who would have thought salmon fishing in Yemen (quite literally) could be the basis of a such a thoroughly enjoyable movie. On one level it is an improbable love triangle that is actually rather sweet in an old-fashioned way. On another it's a spoof of governmental bureaucracy and spin - ""we"" need a positive story about the middle east.  On what to me is the most realistic and important level it shows the futility of trying to impose ""good works"" on people without their understanding, buy-in and involvement.

There is an unsavory part in the movie where the Prime Minister's Press Secretary (Kristin Scott Thomas), who is also a mom with an incorrigible teen son, lowers herself by using foul language towards him; a scene meant to be humorous, but just doesn't work and cheapens her character's credibility and also detracts from the film.

4968844,4,B0067EKY7M,"I have enjoyed Ewan McGregor in many movie roles and he did not disappoint in this light, English rom-com.  The good news is that the tone of the movie manages to stay above slapstick, but the central premise of stocking the Wadi in Yemen with Atlantic Salmon is more than a little far fetched.  A few of the logistical scenes involving sourcing the salmon are very funny (especially between McGregor's boss (ConlethHill) and the Environmental Agency lead).  Amr Waked plays the requisite sheikh with a sense of solemn Zen and all of the supporting cast dutifully plays their part with skill and enthusiasm.  Kristin Scott-Thomas nails her part as the egocentric, jaded Government employee and the story, while slightly formulaic, moves along fluidly and with the usual understated British sense of humor.
All in all, a good time that deserves an audience.",1416182400,,856,5.007042253521127

4969139,5,B0067EKY7M,"SALMON FISHING IN THE YEMEN [2011] [Blu-ray] [UK Release] The British Comedy of the Year! Fantastic! Highly Enjoyable!

Salmon Fishing in the Yemen stars Ewan McGregor as Fred Jones, a fisheries expert who is approached by Harriet [Emily Blunt] with a plan to introduce salmon into the waterways of Yemen. Despite Freds protests, he soon finds himself working on a project that seems not only frivolous but absolutely unfeasible in the arid land of Yemen. But as the mission begins, they soon find that hope can spring  even in the most unexpected places!

Andrews Blu-ray Review: In life, sometimes it's important to try new things, to grow as human beings, to attempt the impossible, to head upstream and swim against the current. You know, like a salmon. At least, that's what the characters in 'Salmon Fishing in the Yemen' learn, which is not so coincidentally, happens to feature lots and lots and lots of salmon. A charming, sweet little romantic comedy, the film is home to a wonderful cast and a fun, quirky script. While the plot does adhere to a few clichd dramatic beats, the story's upbeat spirit and clever humour are irresistible and the journey proves to be heartfelt and entertaining.

Based on Paul Torday's novel of the same name, the film follows a Sheikh's efforts to bring salmon fishing to the Yemen and an area seemingly ill-suited for such a sport. Then we have Sheikh Muhammed's tenacious consultant, Harriet [Emily Blunt], is tasked with the impossible assignment, and soon reaches out to a fisheries expert, Dr. Fred Jones [Ewan McGregor]. At first baffled by the ridiculous notion, Jones declares the plan ""fundamentally unfeasible"" and wants nothing to do with it. Meanwhile, in search of a good PR opportunity, the Prime Minister's press secretary [Kristin Scott Thomas] latches onto the project, and pledges the British government's support, who I thought gave a brilliant performance, especially with her witty hilarious sarcastic comments and the best lines in the film. Now strong-armed into aiding their efforts, Jones slowly opens up to the idea. As the practical scientist begins to believe that the impossible might actually be possible, he simultaneously develops feelings for Harriet. Unfortunately, outside forces arise, not only threatening their budding relationship, but the project itself, potentially spelling doom for Dr. Fred Jones and the Sheikh Muhammed's elaborate dreams.

The script carries a fun, charming sense of humour, lifting us through a breezy, but thankfully not superficial adventure. Watching the leads attempt to achieve the impossible for the sheer thrill and magic of it all is fun and inspiring. Themes dealing with growth, spirituality, and faith are all touched upon, and the filmmakers' good-natured approach manages to be positive and uplifting without becoming saccharine or preachy. The salmon's impossible journey becomes a metaphor for Jones' own character arc, and both storylines end up fuelling most of the narrative's momentum. It might not be the deepest of allegories, but the simple parallel works very well, and the pragmatic man's potential transformation into a genuine dreamer is compelling and humorous.

Quick witted, fast-paced dialogue is prevalent throughout the runtime, and characters will often speak in cheeky formalities, displaying a very British sense of playful humour. As light-hearted as the picture can get, there is some genuine drama as well, and director Lasse Hallstrm does a great job of balancing the tone. Lasse Hallstrm also throws in a few fun visual touches every now and then you see the text from emails will appear on screen, for instance, but mostly offers a simple cinematic style that lets the whimsical story speak for itself.

Chemistry is paramount when it comes to films of this type, and Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt absolutely sparkle. Dr. Alfred Jones [Ewan McGregor] is a typical wet blanket scientist who is all business and totally out of touch with his emotions. Conversely, Emily Blunt's Harriet offers a warmer, more adventurous presence, and as soon as the characters meet, it's instantly clear that they've found their match. Both performers are incredibly likeable and their playful verbal sparring has a certain screwball charm that's infectious. Kristin Scott Thomas is also quite funny as the constantly scheming Patricia Maxwell, and Amr Waked lends Sheikh Muhammad a dignified air of wisdom and compassion.

'Salmon Fishing in the Yemen' is a simple but irresistibly fanciful beautiful film. Its sweet story is bolstered by great performances from the entire cast, and Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt make for a lovely on-screen couple. As original and quirky as the script can be, beneath the plot's outward imagination is a very standard romantic dramedy narrative. Though a few beats are a slightly contrived and predictable, the director's heartfelt sincerity and the script's witty humour saves the film from becoming too formulaic. It has some flaws, but there's just something about the film's light-hearted spirit that manages to win you over in the end and it is a joyous wonderful experience, that makes you feel glad hearted as the film credits roll up the screen and I know people who do not usually get very emotional with films like this, will definitely have a few tears rolling down their cheeks, in watching something really magical and extra special.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The Blu-ray is provided with a fantastic pristine 1080p encoded image transfer in the 2.40:1 aspect ratio. Featuring a nice clean look and a few impressive shots peppered throughout, the film comes to Blu-ray with a handsome transfer free of any major issues. The print is in pristine condition, and a very light layer of unobtrusive grain is visible, giving the image a natural, filmic quality. Detail wavers a bit from scene to scene, with more dimly lit sequences carrying a comparatively soft look. Bright scenes, however, feature very nice clarity, revealing many sharp textures and fine details. Shots capturing the breath-taking Scottish Highlands and majestic Moroccan landscapes (substituting for Yemen) are particularly impressive, and offer a great sense of depth and pop. Colours are rich and nicely saturated, complementing the whimsical tone of the story without becoming unnatural. Contrast levels are high but avoid blooming, and while blacks are a little inconsistent, shadow detail remains solid. Free of any unnecessary digital manipulation or artefacts, the transfer remains authentic and very pleasing. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The audio is presented in an English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track with optional English SDH subtitles. Though a bit front loaded, there are a few lively bursts that provide a decent sense of immersion during key moments. Dialogue is crisp, clear, and well prioritized throughout. The front soundstage has some solid separation and directionality with music and speech, but for the most part, discrete and disperse effects are minimal. Surrounds are fairly quiet during several stretches, but do perk up when appropriate with some ambient sounds like background traffic, rain, wind, or buzzing flies. These instances are quite subdued but do help to enhance the atmosphere and scope of the mix. Dynamic range is wide, providing a nice gamut of distortion free frequencies. The film's climax actually features some aggressive design work and there is even some solid bass activity and the mix is very solid.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Miracles Happen: The Making of Salmon Fishing in the Yemen [1080p] [13:07] Cast and crew, in this fairly basic overview piece, discuss the source novel, the story's qualities and themes, casting the lead roles, character traits and relationships, filming locales, preparing for and shooting the fishing scenes, natural challenges during the shoot that actually benefited the film, and the cast's satisfaction with the film and the filmmaking experience.

Special Feature: The Fishermen in the Middle East: Novelist Paul Torday [1080p] [3:14] A very brief interview with the source novel's author is included. Paul Torday discusses the book's path to the screen, but the piece is far too short to be of much interest.

Finally, Salmon Fishing in the Yemen is a gentle, touching, soulful picture about accomplishing the impossible, about determination, courage, faith, friendship, love, and life. It's not so much about fishing as it faith, faith in oneself and in others, in the possibilities, in the potential to unite, to find goodness in success. It's nicely directed and very well acted. It's a light but purposeful outing, a picture that will leave audiences feeling good and believing in the power of man to come together in harmony, under a shared goal and the bond of friendship, never mind in the potential of cinema to tell well, worthy tales. LIONSGATE's Blu-ray release of Salmon Fishing in the Yemen comes up a bit short in terms of extra content, but the Blu-ray disc features LIONSGATE typical high quality audio and video. Salmon Fishing in the Yemen is a charming, well-made, and definitely must-see film; the Blu-ray does it justice totally. One bonus in getting the Region B/2 Blu-ray is the far superior Slip Cover Design cover, compared to the Region A/1 Blu-ray Cover Design. Very Highly Recommended!

This movie is so well written and cast. The dialogue is fantastic (assuming you like dry humor) and Emily Blunt and Ewen McGregor bring so much to their roles you lose all sense of them being anyone other than the character.

The complexity of building a dam and lake stocked with salmon in the middle of the desert in Yemen has a potentially sad ending, but what happens is uplifting instead. There is a lovely love story that also seems unlikely.
I have liked Director Hallstrom's movies. They are almost always quirky and charming.
This is a family movie but it is also sophisticated, so like many movies it plays on two levels.
I give it a superior rating. I am a picky movie goer. I like to be both intellectually and emotionally engaged. This movie meets both of my criteria.",1390089600,,629,4.575221238938053

The movie has a fairy tale finish but in this day and age I welcome that.  Fred and Harriet are so controlled and understated. I think there's one kiss but the romance is still there. You have to pay attention to the dialogue.  Loved the Scottish accent and the  sheik's command of the English language.  I agree that the depiction of Harriet in a Muslim country was not realistic--she wore pants, no head covering, mixed company with the men--but I didn't care.",1388448000,,571,4.65

Having been in that part of the world, the problems posed are formidable to make this a reality. However, it shows the spirit of people who refuse to accept ""It can't be done"" as the final say on the matter. It was a highly entertaining movie on two vastly different continents highlighting not just two cultures but three: Yemeni, English and Scottish. The landscaping is just beautiful. I love to fish and was rooting for the sheik when he hooked his salmon... and wouldn't have minded hopping in the river beside him.

4969347,5,B0067EKY7M,"Lasse Hallstrom is famous for making whimsical films. His movies tend to stand or fall on their screenplays. But with ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen""--with a screenplay by Simon Beaufoy, taken from a novel by Paul Torday--Hallstrom taps into an appealing British sense of whimsy that elevates the movie.

The story concerns Alfred (Ewan McGregor), a scientist in the British government's Department of Fisheries, and Harriet (Emily Blunt), a public relations executive. Harriet represents a wealthy Yemeni sheik (Amr Waked) who wants to make his country a salmon fisherman's paradise. Alfred at first condemns the plan as ridiculous, but soon the government--seeking any sort of positive news from the Middle East--forces him to take part, and he soon becomes obsessed. He and Harriet also become obsessed with each other, but there are complications: Alfred's brittle, ambitious wife (Rachael Stirling) and Harriet's Army officer boyfriend (Tom Mison). Meanwhile, Islamist fanatics oppose the sheik's plan, and seek to sabotage it by any means possible.

There isn't all that much to the story of ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen,"" but Alfred, Harriet and the sheik are three of the most lovable characters in recent movies, and you come to care deeply about them and their plans. Alfred in particular is delightful, and Ewan McGregor gives one of his best-ever performances playing him. Also a standout is Kristin Scott Thomas as a profane, hard-charging government flack whose enthusiasm for the title project waxes and wanes with the latest opinion polls. Graced with beautiful photography and a strong music score, ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" is a gentle, surprisingly satisfying film.",1373932800,,1686,5.334586466165414

Whoever wrote that didn't see the movie. None of them seems to understand that the novel and film aren't really about salmon, fishing, or the Yemen. I wonder how these reviewers feel about The Shawshank Redemption, because this movie has, thank you Lasse Hallstrom, the very same themes as Shawshank: faith, love, and hope.

Devotees of Shawshank may feel the very same way about this movie. Yes, some elements are formulaic, but every successful drama, including Shawshank, has a first, second, and third act, and each of them in these two movies are so similar, save for Shawshank's tacked on ending, not in the book. Comic relief? Both have some of that as well. Yes, you can trace the structures back to Greece and Rome. And that's not bad. Many of those plots are still around, including this one. How can you be bored by faith, love and hope?",1371168000,,1001,4.6875

4969428,5,B0067EKY7M,"On so many levels this story is wonderful and onscreen even better. The premise is hilariously out there but everyone plays their role with such earnestness and joy, it seems entirely plausible. Look, Emily Blunt is a treasure in anything she's in so that's a given she is going to be good. What is surprising is Ewan McGregor who can be so hit and miss in romantic leading roles (check out The Island and you'll see what I mean). In this playing totally against ""movie"" type as a Scottish fisheries expert living in London ... wait a second, McGregor is in fact Scottish, lives in London and may in fact be a fisheries expert for all we know.

Anyway, he'd great in it as is Egyptian actor Amr Waked who plays the visionary sheikh with money and ideas to burn.

On the DVD the extras are short and first-rate. We get a nice inside story on how the Yemen valley scene was shot ""backwards"" in film sequence (SPOILER ALERT ahead) from flood scene first to construction phase last.

The story seems forced, as though the characters are being manipulated along the plot points, rather than the characters themselves driving the story.  For instance, immediately the Ewan McGregor character of Dr. Alfred Jones is introduced as over-the-top stuffy and dismissive, more like a cardboard figure than a real person.  The other characters are handled in a similar way.  So the relationships between them never catch fire.  Emily Blunt is gorgeous to look at and does her best.  All of the actors try, but there isn't much emotional leeway for them to work with.  The result is that it seems very contrived and predictable.  There is a nice sense of promoting Ango-Yemeni relations here, and some equating of fishing with faith and religion.  And the beauty of the desert scenes is undeniable. But the sudden reversals and surprises that dot the last half-hour of the film just feel manufactured, so that we get our feel-good ending.",1368921600,,1138,4.978835978835979

4969435,1,B0067EKY7M,"WARNING: Contains plot spoilers.

The only reason this doesn't get 0 stars is because Kristen Scott Thomas is pretty funny. Everyone else in the movie is basically eye candy. Initially, my husband thought that the soldier was lying and was actually married or something. That would have helped make the story more believable. However, there was no valid reason for the choice she makes at the end. I said, ""At least she knows the soldier's good in bed. For all she knows, Fred could have erectile disfunction!""

OK, so I'm being tongue in cheek about this. That's clearly not how you choose a lifelong partner. The point is, the movie showed us NO reason that either man would make a good partner, and they didn't present her as anything but gorgeous either. They didn't even show the characters spending any real time together.

I was glad they made the point (vaguely) about cultural relations and the fact that the Yemen people did not necessarily want anything to change or be saved---at the end, Fred did say he'd consult the locals moving forward. But overall, the premise was crazy from the beginning, and my decision to suspend disbelief for the sake of the romance was thwarted by the lack of any plot development in terms of romance.",1366848000,3,1243,4.74537037037037

This movie is about a Sheikh that desires to bring the sport of fishing (a sport where judgement doesn't exist)  to his native land.  The movie is all about the journey of believing.

4969463,5,B0067EKY7M,As I'm getting older I'm finding it  harder to enjoy the Hollywood block busters and its becoming less and less often I enjoy new movies. But this movie was so different and very very enjoyable. Ewan McGregor is out standing playing this part . Its just a lovely enjoyable movie no matter what kind of movies your into. I would highly recommend Salmon Fishing in the Yemen as an all rounder movie for all to enjoy,1365724800,,413,4.434210526315789

4969478,4,B0067EKY7M,"I really liked this movie.  The uniqueness of the concept of stocking salmon in Yemen was outstanding.  The writer could have done more with the relationships, however, as they were predictable.",1365033600,,194,5.225806451612903
4969479,4,B0067EKY7M,"Just a really nice movie with a good story and I loved the scenery. Talking about love I love emily blunt and find her work always convincing. The ending is probably predictable however the story outcome is not . Well worth a look buy this one.

4969504,5,B0067EKY7M,"The title caught my eyes.  Fishing in -- YEMEN?  Huh?  It's a romantic tale (albeit with some twists) involving two couples.  It's also about challenges of introducing a new idea to a place that is steeped in tradition.  People don't like changes.  They see it as a threat.  It's a hard nut to crack, and this one (introducing salmon fishing in this desert country) is no exception.  It's a wonderful story with beautiful scenery (in UK and somewhere in the Middle East).  The idea behind the movie leaves you something to think about.",1363564800,,535,4.666666666666667

4969528,4,B0067EKY7M,"""Salmon Fishing In The Yemen"" is the kind of absurdist comedy that the British do so well informed by American style romance movies.  I have virtually no interest in salmon fishing and even less for rom-coms.  The fact that the film kept me engaged means it's a smashing success.  The romantic chemistry between Ewen McGregor as a stuffy fish and game official and Emily Blunt as a perky attache to the sheikh of Yemen is palpable.  Kristen Scott-Thomas chews the scenery with aplomb as an aide to the Prime Minister.  The film is virtually stolen by Amr Waked as the Sheikh of Yemen whose dream of bringing salmon fishing to his arid homeland isn't so much a personal pecadilloe but symbolic way to unify people of all backgrounds.  Not classic stuff but a great thinking man's non-think diversion.",1363219200,2,799,4.753623188405797

4969530,5,B0067EKY7M,"Although I wasn't sure what to expect from this story, I found I really liked it! The idea of creating a river for salmon to produce their young and for the joy of fishing for them  in the Yemen is so unique.
The people involved in making this happen, as well as their personal lives which undergo major changes makes the story very interesting and enjoyable. This is one I will watch again and again.",1363219200,,401,4.346666666666667
4969531,4,B0067EKY7M,Hard to explain the premise but it was entertaining. I'd recommend it.  It was a different kind of romance movie.  I'm usually not all that crazy about romance movies because they are so predictable but this one had a different twist to it.,1362960000,,240,4.558139534883721

4969537,5,B0067EKY7M,"This is a great movie. I know it got good reviews but it came and went from our local cinemas before we had a chance to see it. The story centers around a sheik's desire to bring salmon fishing to Yemen. Of course the Scotsman charged with accomplishing it, can't see how or why this makes sense. It turns out that the climate and topography are not as poorly suited for salmon fishing as one might imagine. Stocking and redirecting the water enables them to go salmon fishing. There are love interests along the way. And the local tribesmen don't want it to succeed; it goes against Allah's way, in their view. Tensions abound and good triumphs.

It's a wonderful movie and will keep you entertained.",1362614400,,701,4.563492063492063

4969551,4,B0067EKY7M,The film is about a fisheries expert (McGregor) who is approached by a consultant (Blunt) and is asked to help a shiek bring the sport of fly-fishing to Yemen.  This is an unusual story but Emily Blunt and Ewan McGregor make it enjoyable.,1362096000,,238,4.534883720930233
4969552,5,B0067EKY7M,"The acting is amazing (every role, well cast) but beyond that is the story.  I prefer feeling happy at the end of my movies and this movie delivered that for me.  I am a fan of Ewan McGregor but I felt he never really made a movie where his fans could see him at his romantic best (even Moulin Rouge and Down With Love -- did not hit the mark for me).

4969621,5,B0067EKY7M,"I'd never heard of this movie, which may or may not imply I've been living in a box since its release.  Who'd pay attention to something called ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen""?  But I loved this movie enough to recommend it to anybody who'd stand still long enough to listen to me.  Its theme is implausibly simple:  An aggressive English politico, played flawlessly by wonderful Kristin Scott Thomas, decides to ""lighten up"" the dark and dismal sides of the war in the Middle East  by finding something to distract the public.  That something turns out to be a wealthy sheik's desire to introduce salmon into the bone-dry Yemen.  The technology involved in this goofy idea will cost millions, but he's willing to spend it.  And guess what?  He's not doing this purely so he can selfishly fish in his own backyard; he wants to pull together all those who will be involved in the project, including Emily Blunt, who represents the ""agency"" that handles his finances; and Ewan McGregor, who believes salmon won't survive in the desert any better than ravens will swim at the bottom of the ocean.

Add to this the fact that Emily's soldier boyfriend is mia in Afghanistan and Ewan's marriage should have been scrapped years ago, and you have the unlikely basis for love.  As you'd expect, these two are brought together as their individual and mutual passions for succeeding in their project grow.  Predictably, Emily's boyfriend miraculously survives an attack that killed everyone in his squad, showing up just when things look like they might work out for her and Ewan.  But the resolution is lovely, even if you think it's as improbable as a few salmon surviving the subterfuge that destroys the entire project.

Most impressive is that the sheik is shown in a believably favorable light, which flies in the face of present-day racial profiling and bigotry.  Although he is the victim of ""bad Arabs"", he's unquestionably a ""good Arab"", a visionary, a poet, a man of faith and a believable hero.  It's about time the entire world saw a portrait of a middle-Easterner that was not designed by George Bush.  There is good in every group, and it's nice to be reminded of this in a movie.

Please give ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" a look-see.  It's delightful.",1360454400,,2255,4.780361757105943

4969626,5,B0067EKY7M,"Lasse Hallstrom must be a chameleon, as he inhabits the worlds within his films. Watching Salmon Fishing in the Yemen in the theater had me thinking about the truly delightful 'small' British films like Brassed Off, also starring Ewan McGregor. This film is wonderfully quirky and heartwarming.

The director has given us equally exhilarating and offbeat films including Chocolat, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and The Cider House Rules.",1360281600,,436,5.411764705882353

4969644,5,B0067EKY7M,This is not an action movie and is slow paced so wait until you're in an introspective mood. It reminded me of Bagger Vance.

The premise of the story is ridiculous but true - an example of making your private dreams come true (if you have the money and can buy the know how!)  Personally, I think Ewan McGregor and Kristin Scott Thomas stole the show in this one.  Worth watching just to see KST as a driven, ignorant government emissary.",1359072000,,443,4.714285714285714

4969748,4,B0067EKY7M,"A rich beyond belief sheik (Amr Waked) who is fond of fishing is determined to introduce salmon to his country.  While this sounds preposterous on its surface, there is a section of the country that is mountainous and has a healthy river.  The sheik hires a British consulting firm to explore the possibilities.  In charge of the assignment, Harriet (Emily Blunt) arranges a meeting between the sheik and a fishing expert played by Ewan McGregor.  Pushing things along is Patricia Maxwell (Kristin Scott Thomas), the Prime Minister's publicist.

Director Lasse Hallstrom's film is an unassuming attempt at a romantic comedy, but there is little romance and not much comedy.  I'm not being overly critical as the film evolves into a complicated light drama.  We pretty much know up front that the two charming and attractive stars will eventually get romantically entangled, but both appear to be in solid relationships.  Dr. Alfred Jones (McGregor) is married to a woman (Catherine Steadman) with her own career and who travels regularly.  Harriet is in a relatively new relationship with a British soldier (Tom Mison) with a new assignment in Afghanistan.

The heart of the movie is the slow appreciation for each other as working partners.  Harriet and Alfred after a contentious beginning find common ground with each other and the project.  Sheik Muhammed is the wise catalyst.  McGregor and Blunt have wonderful chemistry and we certainly want to see them together.  But this is a chaste relationship and their current partners are not unlikeable.  A difficult acting assignment no matter how well the story is written.

While I enjoyed this film very much, a couple subplots emerge that are unnecessary.  We are in the Middle East, so I guess that means a potential for terrorist activity.  While brief, this injection just didn't feel right with this film and doesn't help the already dilatory pacing.

The Blu ray transfer is excellent.  Shot on film, it looks wonderful in 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ration.  Colors are wonderful, the look is crisp and sharp.  The beautiful photography comes across with no issues that I could see.  The audio, likewise is crystal clear using the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option.  Sounds of the river music and a thunderous helocopter are well disbursed.  The extras are minimal with two film-specific supplements and the usual array of Sony previews.",1358640000,,2403,5.0688775510204085

From beginning to end this movie was very predictable and provided few surprises.  The characters never really developed to a point that you care deeply about them or their plight.  The subject matter is a bit droll as well.  We all know that if you dump enough money into something you can make it happen, and this movie tries to make salmon fishing in Yemen inspiring, but its not.  Its a caricature of what the mideast has come to symbolize: extravagance of the super-rich.  This film makes a caricature out of the media industry and politics as well showcasing how people manipulate events to their advantage for short term selfish gain.

4969962,3,B0067EKY7M,"What do you expect from a film titled ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen""? Nature documentary, or quirky comedy like ""The Men Who Stare at Goats""? With stars Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt, ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" is a romantic comedy with an unusual storyline - storyline that could have been more interesting.

Ewan McGregor plays Dr. Alfred Jones, a British fisheries expert, who is approached by Emily Blunt's investment consultant Harriet to help realize the incredible plans of her client Sheikh Muhammed (Amr Waked): salmon fishing in the Yemen. The doctor thinks the sheik's plan is ""fundamentally unfeasible"" and declines politely, but Prime Minister's press secretary Patricia Maxwell (Kristin Scott Thomas), believing this is a great chance to improve the UK-Yemeni relationship, would not take no for an answer.

""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" greatly benefits from the chemistry between the stars Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt, and the comedic turn from overzealous press secretary by Kristin Scott Thomas, but curiously director Lasse Hallstrm seems to have ignored the film's potential for a more involving storyline. Based on a bestselling novel in UK by Paul Torday and adapted by Simon Beaufoy of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" fame, the film could have been something more than a pleasant if formulaic romance.

After all, we don't know why the story must be about ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen."" Who is Sheikh Muhammed and what does he want? We are told he is a ""visionary"" person, but even a visionary person would do something when he knows his life is in danger. Also, we are not allowed to know much about Captain Robert Mayers (Tom Mison), Harriet's boyfriend. Alfred's wife Mary Jones (Rachael Stirling) fares slightly better, though little attention seems to have been paid to her character.

For all the beautifully shot locations (in England, Scotland and Morocco, not Yemen), ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" works most when the two stars share the screen, both deservedly nominated for Golden Globe. But don't expect much from the rest of the film.",1356480000,2,2064,5.115727002967359
4969963,4,B0067EKY7M,"I like how the movie does a brief intellectual teaching of being a visionary and the requirement of faith that needs to be applied to become a full-blown visionary. It may be brief, but the writer is perfect in getting the message across about how to complete that visionary path. Sometimes it takes just a brief message to tell a whole story through the eyes of the believer.",1356393600,,376,4.544117647058823
4969964,5,B0067EKY7M,An enjoyable story with interesting characters and good performances by McGregor (who really gets onto his Scottish accent!) and the delightful Emily Blunt. A feel-good movie that's not sentimental or lightweight.,1356393600,,213,5.903225806451613
4969965,1,B0067EKY7M,"I watched this on a flight to Portland. I was excited because I love fish, and it takes place in a foreign country, Yemen. That said, this story has a lot of problems. The pacing is slow, the romantic relationships and hardships seem forced, predictable, and dull (no fireworks or chemistry or compelling needs here--these people just happen to be near each other during life changes so the audience can see their kissing scenes coming from miles away). Potentially the most interesting character, the sheik, has been turned into a ""Magical Black Man"" who facilitates this romance in between mystical quasi-religious quips pertaining to Life, Fish, and God. There are some Bad Guys who are angry with him for building a dam for his fish, and they make many attempts on the sheik's life worthy of Wile E. Coyote, succeeding or failing as the plot requires. This means out everyman Ewan gets to save the Sheik's life and tragedy can befall when the plot demands a climax so viewers can walk away feeling like SOMETHING happened in this movie.

Ewan plays a curmudgeonly wildlife steward who loves fish. He's that guy at work where whenever you have a cool new project or want to try a different methodology, he starts whining like an old combustion engine. ""No no no, we can't do that because I fear change!"" His love interest seems like an elegant, ambitious young woman with many prospects ahead of her, which makes me wonder: WHY DOES THIS GUY APPEAL TO HER? Oh, right, the writers needed something to put some meat on the plot.

In the end there is just too much woo-woo and the real interesting parts of this movie are not explored:
-The life cycle and history of salmon, the collapse of their wild stock
-Why the Bad Guys were so upset with the Sheik--I still have no idea why they were upset, and I never got the impression the sheik did either.
-Why our hero's love life fell apart--other than ""because.""
-How that disaster helped him stop being such a curmudgeon and grow into a better person.

I suppose this movie is supposed to his journey to a less curmudgeonly state, but I never got that impression. He's just being kicked from one life change to a new project and, oh, hey, hot chick and spiritual solace. In that sense, the other characters aren't real characters at all so much as magical archetypes on his life journey, and I absolutely detest this sort of storytelling.

4970011,2,B0067EKY7M,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

 The interesting thing about 'Salmon Fishing in Yemen' is that the title represents the film's sub-plot and not the main plot. A wealthy Yemeni Sheikh, Muhammed, seeks to introduce salmon fishing to Yemen. His handler in Great Britain, Harriet Chetwode-Talbot (Emily Blunt), can't convince Alfred ""Fred"" Jones (Ewan McGregor), a government fisheries expert, to support the project since he believes that Yemen doesn't have the necessary cold temperatures and water to sustain salmon. But when the Prime Minister's cynical press secretary, Patricia Maxwell (Kristen Scott Thomas), needs a feel-good story to counter all the bad news coming out of Afghanistan, suddenly Fred is forced to make nice to Harriet and actually attempt to make the project work.

'Fishing in Yemen' works well when it concentrates on all the machinations involving the push to make the Sheikh's project succeed. Various obstacles crop up, including the fishing industry's objection to depleting UK's stock of fresh water salmon. In Fred's estimation, farm raised salmon still can be utilized, and he predicts that those kind of salmon will also swim upstream. There are also local obstacles to the Sheikh's project in Yemen itself. In a rather unlikely scene, Fred's thwarts the assassination of the Sheikh by a bumbling militant, through the intervention of his fishing reel.

But the bulk of 'Fishing' has to do with a love triangle between Fred, Harriet and Harriet's new boyfriend, Robert, who is suddenly missing in action during a secret military mission in Afghanistan. Rather predictably, Fred is on the outs with his workaholic wife, Mary, which opens up the possibility that he can start things up with Harriet. Before you know it, Robert is no longer missing, and Harriet must choose between the two men at film's end.

Instead of directly murdering the Sheikh and his friendly UK supporters, the local militants end up destroying his project by letting a dam open, flooding the whole area. Fair enough. But what about the resolution of the love triangle? Well, it's utterly predictable and sentimental--at the last moment, guess who Harriet chooses? And after the whole project is wiped out, the two lovebirds decide to remain in order to reignite the ruined experiment, ignoring the fact that they might be eventually murdered by the same militants who attempted to wipe the Sheikh out earlier as well as destroying his dream.

Time Out's David Fear couldn't have said it better when he describes the Sheikh as an ""Arabic version of the Magical Negro'. The Sheikh reminds one more of an expert motivational speaker at a New Age Enlightenment convention, than a real Middle Eastern potentate from that part of the world. Amr Waked is fine in that role as are the other principals, Blunt, McGregor and Thomas.

I'm told that the original book the film was based on was much more satirical than the rom-com we find here. Salmon Fishing is mildly entertaining, but eventually devolves into some real gooey, sentimental stuff. One viewing really is enough.",1354665600,,3081,5.113320079522863

4970013,3,B0067EKY7M,"Amazon's changed their stars, so 3 means ""It's okay"" which this film was, but I would have given it 2 stars in the old wordless system.

This is a fairly run of the mill bait-and-switch romance, of a formula popular when Fred and Ginger were dancing in black in white:  Married man meets woman with love interest and falls in love, previous commitments conveniently fall away, then come back, then, well that would be a spoiler.  To spice it up, the story is set partly in Yemen, where a very wealthy Yemeni sheik wants to build a water project to create an agricultural base for his people, with a side benefit of salmon fishing for him.  The British government is at first an enthusiastic backer, what with 2,000,000 British anglers who vote and who are presumed to also like the idea; and for it's Middle Eastern theme with no explosions or death.  Unfortunately, it's going to take 10,000 salmon hatchlings and the fishermen go up in arms, so the only alternative is farmed salmon.  But will they run?  Will they migrate and establish a fishery?

It turns out that, in the real world, farmed salmon do run.  A bit later as they first return to where they escaped or were released, then they miss the anglers who show up earlier to get the native fish, and then they screw up the spawning grounds by trying to lay their own eggs, so there's lots of emerging reasons not to farm salmon as we currently do, but that's not this film.  The point is, the fish DO run, they swim upstream and over the damn (and they swam and they swam right over the dam!).

But this is a Western film, with Brits abroad, and it's set in Yemen and all we know about the Middle East is that there's a whole lot of terrorists over there, so that's the way the movie presents the Yemenis.  If they're not just standing around providing local color with their antiquated dress and weather sculpted faces, they're ordering assassinations, and trying to destroy things.  Don't ask why.  Don't consider whether it's our policies that might be causing this animosity, our treatment of the Arab on the street.  That isn't this movie, either.  Worse, the two British characters wander around in casual western wear, no more than one layer, nothing covering their arms or her head, just as if Yemen is a branch of Hyde park.  When she can't sleep, she comes out of  her tent in her pjs, then he comes out in his, and they sit next to each other.  No matter how this might outrage the locals in the real world, or get the Brits killed (it doesn't, the plot won't allow it).

The movie is a rather simple romantic adventure, a boy and a girl join a rich sheik in his dream to bring salmon fishing to Yemen.  A few cranky old Arab terrorists and some cynical British politicians get in the way, but in the end ""Faith"" and Love triumph, and the salmon run.

4970035,3,B0067EKY7M,"At core, this flick is simply a multi-million dollar format to display Emily Blunt's screen appeal, just as films used to be made just to get Audrey Hepburn in front of a willing audience. Men fall all over themselves in this film to be part of Blunt's life, as if her beauty is all any man needs. She says and does nothing in this production to warrant a man's fancy - no fantastic song and dance routine (Barbara Streisand in ""Funny Girl""; no sterling comedic talent (Goldie Hawn in ""Foul Play""). According to this film's producers, Blunt just has to be. What bologna. The only extraordinary thing about Blunt's character, Harriet, in this film is she represents a Yemeni sheikh who has an extraordinary idea, and somehow Harriet is supposed to share credit for that. As if I had been present when Edison invented the light bulb, I get credit for that achievement.

The hypocrisy I refer to in title of my review is CBS Films producing a movie in which a ""big oil"" man, and a religious one, is portrayed favorably. CBS Films is a subsidiary of CBS Corp. which willingly allows it's identity to be shaped by it's news organization. That news organization has, for a generation or more, been extremely hostile to ""big oil"" and Christian faith. Yet CBS Corp. has no problem portraying a deeply religious ""big oil"" man from Yemeni as wise, compassionate, and visionary. This, of course, because it's only big American oil that's evil, and only Christianity that's a farce, not sacred (and politically correct) Islam.",1353283200,,1514,4.756653992395437

4970058,4,B0067EKY7M,"When I first heard the title of this film I was curious. After learning what the plot was I thought it was ridiculous. After watching the movie I found it was a wonderful film that I knew I could go back and watch again and still be entertained.

The premise of the film is that a sheik in Yemen loves fly fishing. He finds it a relaxing way to spend time and dreams of having his own fishing stream in Yemen. The only problem is that there are no salmon in Yemen. It's also not just the fishing that he wants to bring to his country. The sheik is a visionary, wanting to have peace in his country and hoping to change it for the better. To do so he will spare no expense to make it happen.

The sheik contacts his investment consultant in London, Harriet Chetwode-Talbot (Emily Blunt) and tells her to get things started. For Harriet and the group she works for nothing is impossible when it comes to the sheik. She contacts the British government and the PR person in charge thinks it will give them some good press in the hopes of building relations between the two countries.  She doesn't think it will work but that doesn't matter as long as it looks good.

The program is passed down the line until it arrives at the desk of Dr. Fred Jones (Ewan McGregor), a bureaucrat who's comfortable in his cubicle doing little and being paid for it. A devout fly fisherman himself, he thinks there is no way possible this could work and tells Harriet so. Her reply is for him to find a way to make it work. Apparently working together will be nothing but a cause of friction between these two.

Jones gets things running with the hope that the obstacles he finds will prevent the project from moving forward. Instead the doors are opened for each one to be eliminated due to the involvement of the government. Eventually he finds himself meeting with the sheik himself to discuss the project. What he finds, the man he meets and talks with, changes his attitude toward not just the project but his life as well.

Against all odds the project does move forward. Salmon are found and a way to relocate them is made. The river that they intend to bring the salmon to is made and will not only be a place for the fish but will change the world of Yemen as well. Unfortunately not everyone in that country agrees with the sheik and problems are set in motion at the same time the project moves forward.

The nicest thing about this film is that it isn't just about the building of a river to be stocked with fish not natural to the location. It's about life and people and the effects they have on one another. The images of the salmon swimming upstream make for a wonderful metaphor to life lived in pursuit of a dream, constantly battling the flow of the river in the hopes of reaching a goal.

The story also revolves around not just the project but the characters played by Blunt and McGregor. While Blunt is engaged to an MIA soldier and McGregor is married, both are not in relationships they necessarily want. Blunts was short lived, having met the man she fell in love with shortly before he disappeared. McGregor is married to a woman more concerned with her status in life, her career and moving upward in social status than she is in him and his dreams. The pair come together to see the project become a reality and in so doing find one another as well. How that will play out between the return of the missing soldier and McGregor's marriage is resolved before the film ends.

The movie is visually attractive, making the area that is supposed to be Yemen attractive in its own way. The possibilities of making this area not just productive but attractive to tourists and the like becomes believable. It would be wonderful for something like this, something that would make this area of the world a beautiful place to be would happen. But as the story progresses the chances of that happening are less than hopeful due to the politics of the land.

The romance between the two leads is well played and more tender than one would expect. In a world where most movies find the main characters ready to forget their world and responsibilities and ready to jump into bed at the drop of a hat, these characters slowly find one another. The sexual chemistry between them is one that builds and simmers but never becomes physical. The resolution to their predicament isn't resolved until the end of the film.

As I said at the start here, trying to judge a film by title alone doesn't always turn out with the expected results. Don't let the title of this one make you walk by it on the shelf. Instead pick it up and watch it and you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1352764800,,4657,4.441451990632318

Salmon Fishing In Yemen is a delightful movie.  Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt have wonderful chemistry together and Ewan is wonderful as a staid government worker caught up in his every day life and a marriage where neither party is particularly happy or appreciated.  Then along comes a sheik with an improbably idea, to build a river in Yeman where salmon could live and provide a living for his people.  The title makes this sound like a comedy but it's really more of a tale of one man coming back to life and learning to dream once more.  The cinema photography is wonderful.  I loved the scene of the Scottish Highlands.  The character of the Yemeni sheik is charismatically played by Amy Waked, a man going against the tradition of his people to find a new path for economic survival.  Emily Blunt also gives us a wonderful portrait of a woman torn between two men, her fiance at war and the repressed man she is working with.  Terrific understated performances are the measure of this movie, directed by Lasse Hallstrom.

There is something for everyone to love here.  A very civilized and lovely romance, a movie about fly fishing and the needs of salmon to live and thrive, a bit of espionage against the project and so much more.  I think this is one you will find yourself watching over and over.",1352505600,5,1322,4.602564102564102
4970064,4,B0067EKY7M,"British writer Paul Torday has written a few best-selling and award winning novels.  His 2006 novel ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" was a winner of the 2007 Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Price for Comic Writing and a Waverton Good Read Award in 2008.

The story was so well loved in the UK that it would receive serialization on BBC Radio 4 and eventually receive a film adaptation in 2010 directed by Lasse Hallstrom (""Chocolate"", ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", ""The Cider House Rules"", ""Dear John"") and written by Simon Beaufoy (""Slumdog Millionaire"", ""The Full Monty"", ""127 Hours"").

VIDEO:

""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  The overall picture quality for this film is quite amazing.  Shot in London, Scottland and Morcco, Terry Stacey (""Adventureland"", ""50/50, ""P.S. I Love You"") manages to capture the lush greens and the barren desert with efficacy.  Colors are natural, vibrant when they need to be and black levels are nice and deep.  I didn't see any banding issues, nor did I see any artifacts and the detail, may it be during closeups or the clothing of an individual can be seen.  If anything, the film looks great on Blu-ray!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  As one can expect from a romantic comedy, the film is dialogue driven and is crystal clear, along with Dario Marianelli's (""Atonement"", ""V for Vendetta"", ""Pride & Prejudice"") musical score.  But there is also good use of surround and LFE, primarily during the fishing scenes and you hear the fish jumping in the water to sounds of splashing.  These really come through the surround channels and just the boom from those scenes, it was a nice touch.

There area few scenes with crowds and you do get ambiance but for the most part, the lossless soundtrack for ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" was quite appropriate and the added touch of the surround channel and LFE sequences were pretty cool to hear!

Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" comes with the following special features:

  Miracles Happen: Making Salmon Fishing in the Yemen - (13:07) The director and cast talk about the making of the film.  From interviews with the fly fishing adviser, shooting in Scotland and what happened when a flood devastated the set and more.
  The Fisherman in the Middle East: Novelist Paul Torday - (3:14) Novelist Paul Torday talks about how his novel became a film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have to admit that before I review a fishing-related film, I always wonder if it will be about another banal storyline of one trying to find their life through fishing.  Fortunately, this is not the case with ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"".

In fact, I found this film to be smart, delightful and quite moving!  While fishing is an important part of the film, what makes ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" so original is that it deals with political spin, as viewers get to see how politicians try to deflect a crisis by trying to find another story that people will follow.

In the case of this film, the Prime Minister's press secretary trying to deflect the crisis in Afghanistan and the death of soldiers by trying to build up British and Arab relations by a storyline of two sides working together to bring salmon fishing to the Yemen.  And the concept may seem like a bore when reading it, this film is definitely not boring, thanks to its characters and a wonderful performance by Emily Blunt, Ewan McGregor, Amr Waked and Kristin Scott Thomas.

You have one storyline revolving around Harriet (Blunt), who not only has to emotionally deal with her boyfriend having to go to Afghanistan on a mission and not long after, having to deal with the prikish Dr. Alfred Jones (McGregor).  But the delightful thing about Harriet is that she embraces her job and Dr. Alfred Jones with humor and just wanting to make sure that she comes through for her client, the Sheikh Muhammed (Waked).

And as for Dr. Alfred Jones, a man with Asperger's Syndrome but so qualified and knowledgeable when it comes to fish, talking with others who are not so familiar with fish and streams, he can be rather cold.  But what is interesting about Jones is that under that cold demeanor, he's actually a good guy.  He's just not good with his emotions but yet, Harriet manages to bring the best out of him.

And this is where the conundrum begins because Harriet hears of her boyfriend's possible demise (news reports of no survivors involving British soldiers in Afghanistan).  Emotionally withdrawn, Dr. Jones knows that he needs her to complete this Yemen project, so he gradually warms up by being there for her, helping her through this tough time.  And through that tough time of adjusting, not only does he enjoy her as as a colleague, he begins to feel attracted to her.  As she does with him.

And to add to the relationship between the two, you add the Sheikh Muhammed.  The Sheikh knows that there are people who will try to derail his plan to bring salmon fishing to Yemen (especially as there are groups who don't like the interaction with the British on working on a  project together).  But the Sheikh has a lot of faith, always positive and for Dr. Jones, he is unable to understand what faith is, but through being with the Sheikh throughout the project, he begins to change and possibly see where his life can be better used to help people.

And then you have Kristin Scott Thomas as the press secretary Patricia Maxwell.  A woman who is seen primarily talking on her phone or on chat with the Prime Minister, and she provides a comical look at how the politicians work.

As for the Blu-ray release, the picture quality is fantastic and the lossless soundtrack sounds great, especially for the salmon fishin scenes that tend to use the surround channels and LFE quite effectively.  While not special features heavy, you do get two of them.

Overall, ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" was indeed a treat.  Aside from the wonderful performances, the direction by Lasse Hallstrom is well-done, the cinematography of Terry Stacey is also fantastic and for the most part, Simon Beaufoy's screenplay of Paul Torday's novel manages to be delightful and makes the film quite enjoyable.  It's an original storyline which I don't think will ever be duplicated.

If you are looking for a different kind of romantic comedy that is fun and very entertaining, ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" is definitely recommended!",1352332800,,6494,4.794064748201439
4970065,4,B0067EKY7M,"Salmon Fishing In the Yemen is the movie based on the book of the same title by British author, Paul Torday. The movie is well acted: Ewan MacGregor is perfect as Dr Jones (although I thought he would be older) and Emily Blunt was well cast as Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.  Sheikh Muhammad was also well-played by Amr Waked (I imagined him smaller and fatter). I thought that Mary Jones, as played by Rachael Stirling, a little less acerbic that the character in the book, but Kristen Scott Thomas was perfect as the Prime Minister's spokesman. For those who have read the book, the ending comes as a complete surprise as the screenplay does not follow the book at all on many significant points at the end.

4970079,5,B0067EKY7M,"""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" is an entertaining and engaging film.  Overall, it is a movie about hope, faith, leadership and vision presented at four levels. It is a simple and predictable  love story.  It is about the importance of leadership and the ability of people to do the impossible once the barriers of their own preconceptions were removed.  It is about politicians' opportunism.  And finally is was about how the mean actions of just a few people can undo the good work of many.

As with many movies, it helps to ""suspend disbelief"" once the film starts.  And like the river in Yemen, at points the movie seem a bit shallow, but that doesn't matter.  It is still  thought provoking and entertaining.  It also passes my personal test for whether it was a good movie or not, and that is do I look forward to seeing it a second time.  I do.

I should add delightful as well. There are some thoughtful and undeveloped undercurrents of some serious topics here, but this is a movie to just sit back and enjoy.

The film was adapted for film by Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m, from British writer and author Paul Torday's 2006 debut novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Salmon-Fishing-in-the-Yemen/dp/B003K16P50/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Salmon Fishing in the Yemen</a>, which won the 2007 Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize for comic writing.

We have a plan dreamed up by a visionary sheik played by Amr Waked, and the sheik has the financial resources to turn a Middle Eastern desert into a recreational utopia for sport fishermen. Our sheik seems to be a New Age mystic of sorts, who is given to letting loose with a bit of inspirational gibberish at times... and for this viewer, this just adds to the story. Add in Kristin Scott Thomas's depiction of Patricia Maxwell, the British prime minister's press secretary, and she snaps her dialogue with a real tone of severe icy disdain.

The sheik is an avid fly fisherman who has an estate in Scotland, and he visualizes a prodigious water management project that involves the construction of a salmon run in which the salmon can swim upstream to spawn. He declares that this will bring his preferred leisure activity closer to home and will also help his people. The sheik's plan is proposed to the British government by his assistant, Harriet (Emily Blunt), and Patricia Maxwell sees this as a perfect opportunity to distract the public from the conflicts in the Middle Eastern conflicts, resulting in political points for her boss.

Dr. Alfred `Fred' Jones (played by Ewan McGregor) is a British fisheries expert is approached to assess the feasibility of the idea, which would involve importing thousands of North Atlantic salmon from Britain to Yemen. He believes this plan to be ridiculous and impossible to carry out, and he dismisses the idea. But Patricia has done her research and has found that two million British voters are fishing enthusiasts, so she pressures Fred's boss to force his participation in this scheme.

However there's an uproar that follows when British fishermen learn that their salmon stock will be depleted. The only solution to this dilemma is to use farmed salmon, which have absolutely no river experience. Then comes the big question as to whether farmed salmon will follow their wild brethren's instincts and head upstream.

Fred is an unhappily married bureaucrat whose cold wife of two decades leaves him for months at a time to conduct her business in other places. He develops an undeclared romantic attraction to Harriet, but her boyfriend Robert (Tom Mison) is fighting overseas. She receives news that Robert is missing in action, and she falls apart.

There's a perfunctory subplot where the sheik becomes the target of an assassination plot by Islamic extremists, but the biggest moment of suspense has nothing to do with terrorism: it comes when the farmed salmon are released into the waters of their new home. Will the farmed salmon follow their wild comrades' instincts and head upstream, or will they just swim around in complete confusion? And will Fred and Harriet and Fred get together? You'll have to see the film for those answers.

If anyone wonders about the impact of this movie, a May 2012 article in The Telegraph (UK) noted that the Yemen Tourism Promotion Board had been ""inundated"" with requests about the country following the film's release, and that salmon fishing isn't actually that popular in the Western Asian country, though there are sea fishing opportunities there.

4970127,4,B0067EKY7M,"Some movies are written off because of their titles and it takes a while for them to gain an audience. Few people knew what The Shawshank Redemption was before it was released on VHS. Another confusing title is The World's Fastest Indian? Is it about an athlete of some kind? While other movies, such as Freedom Writers and The Reader, simply sound boring. Salmon Fishing in the Yemen is in danger of being dismissed due to its title, but that would be a mistake.

Dr. Alfred Jones (Ewan McGregor) is a fisheries expert, and he seems like a boring man. His existence is dull and safe. His relationship with his wife is one of mutual tolerance, and they do not share the same passions. He only drinks alcohol on the weekend, and only after 7pm. Nobody takes him seriously at work either, so he has little to look forward to.

Sheikh Muhammed (Amr Waked) is a keen fisherman, but that's not an easy hobby to satisfy when you are surrounded by sand. He recruits a team to investigate the possibility of building a river in the desert, and populating it with salmon, so that he can pursue his passion for fishing. Harriet Chetwode-Talbot (Emily Blunt) is given the task of recruiting Jones and anyone or anything else that might be needed to complete the project. She's in a new relationship and loves a soldier, but that is put on hold when he is called up for duty.

The movie is heavily influenced by romance. Harriet is in a hopeful new relationship, Jones is in a tired marriage, and could there even be the possibility of romance between the two with them working so closely together? The other main element is humor. The largely British cast influences the tone, and the humor is more subtle and understated than in typical North American comedies. I found myself smiling often, rather than laughing out loud. Most of the laughs come at the expense of Jones, who is set in his routines and is a quirky individual.

Jones doesn't treat the project seriously because it sounds so ludicrous, but his outlook changes when he meets Sheikh Muhammed, who is one of the most likable characters in the movie.

Blunt is not a typical beauty, but she's a good actress. I was impressed with her performances in Sunshine Cleaning and The Adjustment Bureau, and she's just as effective in this movie. She has a certain warmth and vulnerability that works well for a romantic lead. McGregor most recently caught my attention in The Ghost Writer, and he plays Jones perfectly.

However, the movie is more than a romantic comedy. The two leads are required to pull off several emotional scenes, especially in the final act.

One character who elicits laughs in every scene in which she appears is Patricia Maxwell (Kristin Scott Thomas), who plays the British Prime Minister's aide. She's the main villain in the story and is always out to manipulate the situation in order to gain votes and positive mentions in the newspapers.

I'm not entirely sure who the movie is aimed at, but it worked for me. It won't change your life with a dramatic message that you've never seen before, but it's an enjoyable place to visit for a while.

The Blu-ray presentation is strong and the desert scenes look particularly impressive. Special features are sparse and total just over 16 minutes.

Ewan McGregor begins to resemble Alec Guiness more and more as he gets older, and I mean that as a compliment also.  The movie's enjoyable, colorful, and fun.",1350345600,,501,4.724137931034483

4970157,3,B0067EKY7M,"Can the English survive an outlandish plan to bring Western Civilization to Yemen, along the Sinai Peninsula?
It's Fishing for Islam in the Yemen, or ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen,"" the movie.
A sheik, played by Amr Waked, is in love with fishing in his posh estate in Scotland, and would like to bring it to more arid land down south.
It turns out to be something of a romantic comedy involving two empires - British and Islamic.
The movie stars Ewan McGregor as Dr. Afred Jones, Emily Blunt as Harriet Chetwood-Tolbert, and Kristin Scott Thomas as Patricia Maxwell, the prime minister's press secretary.
Blunt represents the sheik's financial interests through Fitzharris & Price International Investment Division, with a London office.
The breezy contrast between McGregor and the sophisticated Blunt, make the movie work.
Maxwell is on the hunt for some good news for His Majesty's Government Press Office and the prime minister to offset the bombing of a mosque in Afghanistan by British military.
McGregor is pressured into meeting with Blunt, who represents the sheiks assets in Britain, which includes an estate in Scotland.
Yemen gets more rain than Saudi Arabia, she points out to McGregor - up to 250 millimeters of rain per month during some months.
The long term plan is to irrigate thousands of acres of desert, she says.
McGregor projects the cost at approximately $50 million dollars or pounds.
""He's a very keen fisherman,"" she says of the sheik. ""I don't really think it's my place to explain the sheik's motivations. But I will say this. Of all our wealthy clients, he is different. I would go so far as to describe him as a visionary man.""
""A visionary,"" Jones repeats incredulously.
""Yes I know, it's not a very fashionable word,"" she says. ""But if you decide to take this project with us, then you can decide for yourself when you meet him.""
McGregor leaves, walking into a wall on the way out of her office, prompting a giggle from Blunt.

The two join the sheik at his favorite estate in Scotland, where he fishes with Jones.
Waked questions McGregor's reluctance to engage in the project.
Judged by this particular sheik's behavior, muslim men can act in an honorable and civilized manner.
He has benefited from a proper English education, and gained a proper English accent.
Can fishing bring a shot of civilization to a Muslim land?
It's a question that may be a tale of contrasts between the extreme belief of Islam, and little or no belief by the English, who have mostly given up on God.

""You're not a religious man?"" he says to McGregor.
""No, I'm not.""
""But you are a fisherman, Dr. Jones.""
""I'm sorry, I don't follow.""
""How many hours do you fish before you catch something? Dozens.""
""Hundreds sometimes.""
""Is that a good use of your time for a facts and figures man? But you persist, in the wind and the rain and the cold, with such poor odds of success. Why? Because you are a man of faith, Dr. Alfred.""
In the end, you are rewarded for your faith and constancy, with fish.""
""With due respect, fishing and religion are hardly the same thing, your excellency.""
""With equal respect, I have to disagree.""
""A toast. To faith and fish.""
""To faith and fish - and science.""

Does fishing demonstrate faith? Or is it simply a sporting way for many English fishermen to pass the time, whether they catch the fish or not?
It may be important to point out that is is not necessary to fish in the wind, rain or cold to enjoy fishing.
Nevertheless, not only is the sheik a man of great faith, he knows when a woman is unhappy and senses that Blunt is uneasy or unhappy.
I have put my feet in it, he says, describing his too sensitive observations.
He then violates traditional Muslim culture by shaking hands with Blunt.

The sheik gets resistance about the idea from the Muslim tribe in Yemen, who confront him.
""These men, they say that by bringing water, life to this dessert, I am bringing the Western ways to our land. They say I have insulted God himself. I say they are fools.""
The problem with their argument is that it is actually true.
He is bringing Western ways to the dessert, something that Muslims still struggle to accept, even if it means living a better life and saving lives.
And the West still has significant problems bringing modern ideas and methods to areas like Afghanistan.
Entities like the Taliban make it more difficult to educate young girls in traditional Muslim countries.
The Western ideal of helping developing countries to end suffering with modern technology is something that is still being rejected in largely Muslim areas.

The sheik has plenty of money to spend on creating an unnatural environment for the fish.
And so begins the somewhat wild journey or fantasy, led by an oil-rich sheik.
Before the water flows, he addresses the group gathered:
""Muslims, Christians - we are all gathered here in an act of faith - and why not.""
It's doubtful that there are any British citizens gathered who would claim Jesus Christ or being Christian.
It's not even a good idea for Muslims to acknowledge that there are Christians in a Muslim country.

Jones does seem to symbolize the British, who don't seem to know what to do with God or faith.
It's as though the British are willing to allow the Muslims to take the lead in the faith, since they have become mostly Godless.
Though Islam is an extreme religion, producing radical elements, at least the Muslims have more faith than the average British citizen, who believes in his football club more than God.
It is a little surprising that the writer included a traditional Islamic weaponry.
Though the sheik may be civilized, he still wears his dagger.
Traditionally, it isn't used for cleaning fish, but for dismembering infidels.

4970161,4,B0067EKY7M,"Now and then a film comes along with such an 'out of left field' premise, and the producers/director get what it's all about, that it just turns out as the most peasant surprise ever. This is one of those films.

Here's the scoop. Ewan McGregor gets an e-mail from Emily Blunt. She has an Arab client with more money than sense who is in love with salmon fishing. He wants McGregor to engineer a system whereby he can introduce salmon into the Yemen ecology. McGregor thinks it's undoable but, since his wife is headed to Geneva on business and Britain needs a public relations coup, (they force the project on him) he might as well see how far he can take it. The results are surprising. There are a couple of sub plots that add to the overall but why spoil?

This is a charming film. One of the reasons my wife liked it is because the strongest individuals here are all women. McGregor is very accomplished in his discipline but he's a bit of a milquetoast with little sense of humor. The guy in charge of securing the salmon, and pretty much every male above him in the government, are portrayed as wankers. Emily Blunt is a doll and seeing her and McGregor slowly and quietly grow closer is very satisfying. Something else I liked a lot was that, for the most part, the people here are good-hearted. Even Kristin Scott Thomas, though a bit tough and rough-edged, is not an evil queen. In one scene she's shown playing video games with her son. This is such a jolt, and so quick, it really underlined the type of person she is. There are a lot of nifty touches like that.

This is a good looking movie. Even the desert is lovingly photographed. Lasse Hallstrom is a seasoned director and very adept at taking smaller stories and giving them their own gravity. He doesn't disappoint here. You just fall in love with these people and root for them and their cause. The music is good and all the other production values are as good as they need to be to bring this one of a kind film to fruition.

Both movies are set in Scotland, and feature protagonists with emotional handicaps that are swept into a wild, mystical and technological quests, complete with stunning visuals of indigenous scenery.  And lots of quirky characters to boot.

If you are a fan of slightly daft movies that hold to the proposition that great ideas can span the divides of cultures and that inspired lunacy can triumph over class distinctions and corporate stodginess, then this movie might be the one for you.

But, whereas I would give ""Local Hero"" ( a movie that, if you are unaware of, you by all means should seek out) five big stars, I would give ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" only about 3 and 1/2.  This movie is more heavyhanded than ""Local Hero"".  The Scottish flavour is ladled on a bit too heavily with heavy brogues (Ewan McGregor's accent seems to verge on parody, as if he was parroting Dudley Moore), tam o' shanters, and kilts.

The eccentric Yemeni sheik seems to have been cast with an eye to ""getting someone who looks a bit like Antonio Banderas"".  And the greatest sin, ""Salmon Fishing"" is missing a brilliant, crazy good, beautiful musical score like the one Mark Knopfler supplied for ""Local Hero"".

Worth watching, I'd say, but please be aware that there is better stuff like this out there.",1348185600,,1415,4.7860082304526745
4970196,4,B0067EKY7M,Though this follows a predictable formula you won't mind that. It is a gentle fun Brit comedy in the old style of British comedies. Don't expect American style punchlines or pratfalls. Its the overall situation that will bring a smile to your face as a Yemen prince is determined to bring Salmon fishing to his country besides opposition from some of his people and skepticism from his British experts.

I force all our company to watch it again with me when they drop by for an evening. It is  so romantic, it makes me cry every time I see it. I fall in love with the Sheik who decides to build a salmon run in Yemen, and has the ultimate faith to allow Ewan MacGegor the opportunity  to build it in the desert. It is so believaable that I've heard Yemen is now frantic because so many tourists are trying to book salmon trips in their country, and of course they don'[t really have a salmon run. But  you'll believe they do when you see the river rushing through the desert. And you'll love the shy romance developing between Ewan and Emily Blunt! Buy this film...you can't go wrong with it.

4970233,5,B0067EKY7M,"Ewan McGregor is a wonderful actor.  He can do just about any role.  In MOULIN ROUGE we discovered he was an astonishingly good singer who had turned down a rock and roll career in favor of an acting career. In the STAR WARS franchise we saw him as an action hero.  In this film he plays an utterly endearing scientist with Asperger's Syndrome.  He is a civil servant in the UK working with fish who suddenly finds himself caught up in a madcap scheme to bring flycasting trout fishing to the country of Yemen at the behest of an incredibly wealthy shiek. Initially it is the UK government which forces him into this but the charismatic shiek himself and a female colleague in distress over her MIA soldier boyfriend totally enmesh him in the scheme. If you are looking for a feel good film after a stressful day, this is it.  It is utterly charming.  As a side note, I am really glad to see that Ewan McGregor has not enmeshed himself in total trash films.  This is often what happens when an actor hits it big.

4970260,4,B0067EKY7M,"SALMON FISHING IN THE YEMEN takes a very unlikely premise and makes it somewhat believable. The movie, based on Paul Torday's acclaimed book of the same title, takes us on a different and somewhat fantasical journey into another side of the Middle East and the mysterious and exotic country Yemen.
Egyptian actor Amr Waked stars as an incredibly wealthy sheik who has the dream of bringing salmon visiting to Yemen. Salmon need water and Yemen is not known for its abundance of water nor is it known for cooler temperatures that seem to be the preference of fish. The sheik is a kind-hearted, well-educated and enlighted man who seems to think spending $50 million on this project will bring joy and prosperity to his poor nation.
It's up to Alfred Jones (Ewan McGregor), a fisheries expert, to make it work along with the help of the sheik's consultant Harriet (Emily Blunt). The fantasy project comes together after Britain's Prime Minister's press secretary Bridget decides there needs to be a postive story coming out of the Middle East. Why not Salmon fishing in the Yemen. Kristin Scott Thomas is a chain-shoking, hyper-active Bridget who does not know the meaning of ""It can't be done.""
The sheik has lofty dreams while Jones is practical. When Harriet's sincere dedication is added to the mix, anything seems possible. There is great chemistry among this cast of talented British and Egyptian actors. They almost get us to believe in the project and its future for Yemen. Unfortunately, the story gets muddled in the waters. Alfred's marriage is falling apart. Harriet's soldier boyfriend who she has just met has disappeared in Afghanistan. Bridget has to deal with angry British fisherman anxious to protect their salmon from being shipped to Yemen. Above all, the sheik's life is in constant dangers from elements within his country who think his project will shame and ruin Yemen.
If you've gotten this far, you can probably guess the story and the familiar plot. A fun idea becomes another run of the mill story about boy meets girl under difficult circumstances and a dream brings them together.
SALMON FISHING IN THE YEMEN does have its charm along with beautiful scenery in Scotland and Morocco (who fills in for Yemen--probably not the safest place to film a movie at this time in history). Yemen is a lovely and exotic country and it is sad Morocco had to be the double. It's not a fulfilling movie but pleasant enough with a dream cast of great actors.",1347235200,,2471,4.85781990521327
4970261,4,B0067EKY7M,"The Sheikh of Yemen (Amr Waked) wants salmon fishing in his country which the British government is willing to do. Dr Alfred Jones (Ewan McGregor) and Harriet (Emily Blunt) are thrust together on the project. Both are stuck in relationships with other people and can't move on. The salmon becomes a metaphor for their lives as their DNA forces them to do the same thing, i.e. staying in their comfort zone. The fish movement to Yemen is symbolic that we can move on. We just have to have faith.

The production is a typical indie flavored with bits of humor and a warm fuzzy side of philosophy. It is in a way a romance, but not your typical romantic comedy. It is a good date movie, especially if you are dating a married man that is having trouble leaving his wife...or on second thought, maybe not.

4970353,2,B0067EKY7M,"I love Emily Blunt.  I think I'd pay to watch a movie where she did nothing but read from a newspaper.  I also think Yemen is a fascinating --albeit in a terrible way-- country.  So I was eager to see this movie that is billed more or less as a breezy romantic comedy set in Yemen.

The movie's basic plotting is pretty predictable with Emily Blunt's character worrying over the fate of her soldier boyfriend who is missing in action and slowly falling in love with Ewan McGregor.  But I could put up with a movie like that being predictable as long as it is cute and appealing.

But my ability to suspend disbelief and just enjoy the story can't stand up to my knowledge that no one in the modern era would ever consider introducing salmon and the sport of salmon fishing into Yemen, a country:

-that suffers from a horrific shortage of water
-is beset by terrible poverty that would make the idea of outlaying millions and millions of dollars for such a project almost obscene
-is beset by ongoing political turmoil over who will get to rule Yemen ever since the long-serving dictator (er...I mean president...departed from the scene).
-is host to the most virulent and vibrant affiliate of al-Qa'ida in the world
-also has a slow burning insurgency involving the Houthi tribesmen (Shi'as who hate and are hated by the Sunnis of the country)
-that has serious problems over southerners still angry over the forced merger of Yemen over 20 years ago

Another telltale about how implausible this movie is where it was filmed. It was not anywhere near Yemen but in Morocco.

Bottom line:  I read about the novel that this film is based on...that it's satirical account of the salmon fishing project.  If the movie had played it like a story out of the Onion, I think ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" would have been a good movie.  But playing it as a gentle, pleasant romantic comedy just doesn't work because Yemen is such a disaster area.  It seems almost in bad taste to set such a story there...the same way a light-hearted romantic comedy in Nazi-occupied Poland would be.

So my advice is that it should only be watched if you are a die-hard Emily Blunt fan and you're either ignorant of the reality of Yemen or are somehow able to ignore that reality.",1346371200,5,2254,4.58852867830424

Ms. Blunt is one of today's best young actresses and few can match her depth in romantic comedies. Ewan McGregor is equally adept and his character's transformation is the film's centerpiece. While Blunt and McGregor carry the movie, Kristin Scott Thomas provides the funniest moments.  She is hilarious as the hard driving press secretary for the British Prime Minister. Amr Waked plays his part to the tee as the mystical Sheik, though I wish there had been a little more development of his character and more depth to his back story.

4970381,1,B0067EKY7M,"Romance Negatives:
(1.) Acting was method, read-the-script unemotional, cutout characterizations. Just stand there and look pretty, not-so-challenging acting. I have seen more natural believable performances from then 9/10 year old actresses Morgana Davies & Garance Le Guillermic.
(2.) Formula script of love triangle (two good looking guys chasing one female) so we now know the target audience.
(3.) Ethically, a corrupt script. A girl falls into life long love with a soldier who suddenly has to go to Afghanistan. Supposedly a heartfelt and forever love which should survive the dangers that the soldier faces. Subsequently, he goes missing and even possibly killed. His girl's commitment suddenly has a change of heart. She starts falling for her co-worker who happens to be married. His marriage is a bit bland and it's mostly his fault. His solution is to fall in love with the aforementioned more attractive co-worker. The soldier survives and comes back to his love except she is now attracted to that co-worker cheating husband; the one who dissed his wife. Values? Soldier gets dumped while performing his dangerous military duty and cold husband dumps wife for something more attractive.

History Negatives:
(1.) Movies that pretend to have a real world backdrop should be, at the least, 50% accurate so that the audience has spent some time being more rather than less educated.
(2.) Yemen has had a conflict ridden democracy with a President and VP for decades. A Prince would be more accurate for Saudi Arabia - not Yemen. The British, as usual, messed things up in the Middle East after WWII with how they allocated lands and entitlements which is one reason why the area is in constant conflict.  Al-Qaeda and others now take advantage of that and made it into a safe haven war zone. The writer & director have minimized the wealth and religious disparities in that country by scripting a Prince with an ostentatious display of his wealth e.g. using it for a personal fishing stream (irrigation rationale for that geography fails miserably) is irresponsible greed. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie doesn't become a great propaganda tool for Al-Qaeda.
(3.) The movie also makes comedic the Yemeni shortage of water. In reality, brief episodes of heavy rain and subsequent ravine flooding makes agriculture there very difficult. This movie's solution is to use aquifer water to sustain the Princes' fishing river year round. A script from out-of-touch writers which makes wasteful misuse of scarce aquifer water a stupid idea and is demeaning to the Yemeni. In this country people are dying because of a lack of water.
(4.) The political killings over the decades in Yemen are made movie-comical with an incompetent single assassin who is foiled by our British fish expert by casting a fishing line at him. This was followed by a second assassination attempt created as a not believable river flooding scene meant to drown the Prince; yet again saved by our British fish expert.
(5.) It was filmed mostly in Morocco - wonder why. They didn't even bother to show the real Yemen and it's people? Well, they did bother to show fish. Serious out-of-touch writing in showing our British female character inappropriately dressed/behavior as an affront to Islam.
(6.) Since salmon occupied such a big part of the movie it would have been more realistic to get Portuguese, Chilean, Californian salmon or better still steelhead.

Working with a script by Simon Beaufoy (The Full Monty, Slumdog Millionaire, Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day, Yasmin, etc) adapted from Paul Torday's popular novel by the same name, and selecting a cast of some of our brightest and worthy character actors in the business, he has created a strange story that is at once full of political satire, relationship studies, fragile human frailties and hope, and in doing so has given us one of the surprise best films of the year.

Sheikh Muhammed (Amr Waked, a mesmerizingly fine actor) is a visionary sheik who believes that his passion for the peaceful pastime of salmon fishing can enrich the lives of his people, and he dreams of bringing the sport to the not so fish-friendly desert with the hope that he can make the desert green and a happy home for his people. He has an endless supply of money and instructs his representative Harriet (Emily Blunt) - a bright but relationship-anxious girl who has just started an affair with a soldier, Capt. Robert Mayers (Tom Mison, a dashingly handsome new face on the screen!) - to turn the dream into reality, an extraordinary feat that will require the involvement of Britain's leading fisheries expert Dr. Alfred Jones (Ewan McGregor) who happens to think the project both absurd and unachievable: the naive Alfred is an idealist whose marriage to his sold wife Mary (Rachael Stirling) is one rocky ground. That is, until the Prime Minister's overzealous press secretary Bridget (Kristin Scott Thomas in a brilliant character role) latches on to it as a 'good will' story. Now, this unlikely team will put it all on the line and embark on an upstream journey of faith and fish to prove the impossible, possible.

In addition to this extraordinary cast there are tasty cameo roles for Conleth Hill as Alfred's blustering Dickensonian boss Bernard Sugden among others.  The concept of taking unlikely colleagues into a life changing relationship on this adventure dreamed by Sheikh Muhammed is more than tender; it is also very intelligently written romance.

Metaphorically, the movie contains the message that we can find our oases no matter the desert.  Also resonating is that, with unlimited resources, the wildest, craziest dream can be pursued, if not fully realized.  McGregor and Blunt are the film's best ingredients.  Both have charm, and it's fun to watch the scientifically oriented Dr. Jones become immersed in politics as a romance with Harriet blossoms.

4970401,4,B0067EKY7M,"""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" is a romantic comedy-drama genre film.

The denotations and connotations of the narrative are guided around salmon fishing, yet there are micro and macro implications as a result of this. On one hand the idea of bringing salmon fishing to the Yemen presents as a wishful and near impossible task. On the other hand the viewer is presented with a situation where this same goal allows people of different circumstances and racial and cultural backgrounds to find unison working on the project.

The film characters are all unique and developing salmon fishing bonds them as a group, which helps them through their own personal challenges, and to find a spark that is missing in their lives.

4970402,3,B0067EKY7M,"The best thing about the film, ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"", is the imagery found in the title. The audacious idea of bringing a fishing industry to the desert evokes glorious ideas of rebirth and resurrection. But unfortunately, the soaring nature of this central theme is dragged down by dull, loathsome Hollywood clichs.

 Certainly, the film has an interesting pedigree. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom (who made one of the greatest of all coming of age films, ""My Life as a Dog"") and screenplay by Simon Beaufoy (who brings the work of a novelist to the screen as he did with ""Slumdog Millionaire"") gave reason for hope.

 Ewan McGregor plays Dr. Alfred Jones. (Sidenote - I kept being distracted when people called him Dr. Jones which made me think of another famous movie scientist. Between this and playing Obi-Wan in the prequels, is he trying to redo all of George Lucas' classic characters? Howard the Duck can't be far behind. End sidenote.) Dr. Jones is an ichthyologist / British government drone challenged to help a sheik bring salmon to Yemen.

 Emily Blunt plays Harriet, a western representative for the sheik who must persuade Jones that the project is not a boondoggle or a joke but a viable possibility. Pressure is also supplied by Kristen Scott Thomas who plays the Prime Minister's Press Secretary desperately seeking a positive story from the Middle East.

 Thomas as the foul mouthed, devious political schemer provides some of the film's funniest moments, especially in her texting conversations with the Prime Minister, but at times her moments come across as ""In the Loop"" lite.

 Another fine moment in the film comes when Jones meets with the sheik who ask if Jones is religious. Jones insists he just believes in facts and figures...He's a scientist! But the sheik counters that Jones is a fisherman and by definition that means he is a man of faith. Why else would he spend hundreds of hours waist deep in water with no assured outcome.

 There are several interesting conversations about religion. Alfred and Harriet both admit they don't know anyone who goes to church, Alfred saying he uses Sundays to go to Target. (This is a little puzzling as before we saw Alfred with his wife practicing in a musical quartet in a church. Whatever.)

 But as I mentioned before, tiresome clichs emerge and to discuss them I must stoop to spoilers.

 Though is it a spoiler to say that even though Jones is a married man and Harriet is in an affair with a soldier in Afghanistan, that the two will fall and love? For a while I thought that the message of the importance of patience and faith and fishing would be applied to the marriage of Dr. Jones. But no, because I more important rule is that in a Hollywood film the two names at the top of the bill, the pretty people, must come together. ""Casablanca"" is still fresh because lead characters doing what is right rather than what feels good is a rarity in films.

 There also is lazy characterization in the film. When Blunt's boyfriend becomes inconvenient to the plot, he is shown to be a raciest, as all soldiers seem to be in Hollywood. And the sheik, we are assured, is different, a visionary who believes in peace, romance and fishing. There is talk of the clich of ""the magic negro"", an African American figure whose sole purpose is to supply wisdom to the white hero. Amr Waked seems to be playing the Arab version of this role (as he did in ""Syriana""). All the other Arabs seem shady and are probably all terrorists.

 And the final annoying clich, was the talk of ""faith"". In films, it is important to have faith, it doesn't matter what you put your faith in. So it's good for Alfred to put faith in something new and different like a fish hatchery in the desert and a romantic fling, but nothing so drab as an established marriage.

 But it does, of course, matter what you put your faith in. The film has people who engage in terrorism and they certainly have faith, placed in a wrong and evil place.

 Paul in I Corinthians 15 argues that if Christians put their faith in the resurrection and it proves untrue, then Christians are fools.

 So faith in fishing in the Yemen, in peace and prosperity in the Middle East needs to be more than just a pretty thought one believes in, it must be possible. I wish those ideas would have been even more central in the film than another tired boy meets girl story.

(The film is rated PG-13 for brief violence and strong language.)",1335225600,4,4457,4.637404580152672
4970403,4,B0067EKY7M,"""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" is a nicely-done British romantic comedy, built around a preposterous premise and the charm of two unlikely people falling in love.  Its very British humor won't appeal to everyone, but a strong cast sells the movie.

When a wealthy Yemeni Sheik (an excellent Amr Waked) decides to build his own salmon fly-fishing stream in his desert homeland, government media expert Paula Maxwell (Kristen Scott Thomas) sees an opportunity for favorable publicity and pushes the project on skeptical Fisheries scientist Dr. Fred Jones (Ewan McGregor).  The reluctant Jones and hyper-efficient business consultant Harriet Chetwode-Tobin (Emily Blunt)begin to put flesh on the whimsical project, which takes on a life of its own, far up a narrow wadi in the Yemeni mountains.

This is a fun movie with several narrative threads.  Maxwell's ruthless and hilarious quest for favorable publicity is one.  A second involves the troubled marriage of Dr. Jones and his careerist wife, and Harriet's stressful quickie wartime romance with a deployed British Army officer.  The main thread is the slow, uneven blossoming of a relationship between Fred and Harriet, as verbal sparring over a seemingly impossible project turns into a shared committment to something that might just work out.  A key scene comes early in the movie, over dinner in a Scottish castle, when the Sheik challenges the scientist's claimed lack of faith, using fishing as a telling metaphor.

The movie has some jarring moments of excitement (the sheik has enemies) and some beautiful location shooting, including London, Scotland and Morocco (a stand-in for war-torn Yemen).  Best of all is the superb acting of McGregor and Blunt, putting their understated best into a touching romance.

4970406,4,B0067EKY7M,"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen is a hard film to categorize.  Directed by Lasse Hallstrm, with a screenplay by Simon Beaufoy adapted from the novel of the same name by Paul Torday, you could nominally call it a romantic comedy, but it's actually far more than that.  A character-driven human comedy about faith, passion and fishing comes closer.  Add in an absolutely scene-stealing performance by Kristin Scott Thomas as the Prime Minister's take-no-prisoners get-it-done-yesterday! press secretary and you've got Salmon Fishing in the Yemen.

The film begins with Dr. Fred Jones (Ewan McGregor), the British government's leading expert on fisheries, receiving an inquiry about the feasibility of introducing salmon fishing to the Yemen. Jones quickly dismisses the possibility, responding that it is simply impossible for salmon - a fish that thrives in cold fresh-water streams found in northern latitudes - to survive in a hot and arid environment like the Yemen.  The inquiry, it turns out, came from Harriet Chetwood-Talbot (Emily Blunt), a consultant for a company that manages properties for a very wealthy client, Sheikh Muhammad (Amr Waked) from the Yemen. The Sheikh has a vision of salmon fishing, which he became familiar with due to his having an estate in Scotland, as not only a way to create much needed jobs for his people, but also as a way of bringing people together. Undeterred by Jones' initial rejection and buoyed by the persuasive Sheikh's belief in his vision, Harriet persists in pushing for a feasibility study, which Jones continues to dismiss.  Until, that is, the project comes to the attention of the Prime Minister's press secretary, the highly formidable and relentless Patricia Maxwell (Kristin Scott Thomas).

A series of recent news items about bombings and other setbacks in the war in Afghanistan, already highly unpopular, has left the government desperately in need of ""Anglo-Arabian news that isn't about something exploding.""  After tasking her staff with ""We need a good news story from the Middle East, a big one, and we need it now. You've got an hour. Get on with it!"" Maxwell seizes on the salmon fishing project as ideal for the government's needs and pushes it forward, riding rough-shod over any and all objections as to the project's chances of actually working.  Which in turn sets everything in motion and brings all of the main characters face to face.

Ewan McGregor's Fred Jones is a man who muses ""I was wondering if I was genetically programed to dull pedestrian life.""  He's comfortable in his government job where his biggest challenge is picking out pictures of fish to spice up his annual report; he's married but it's a passionless marriage, as becomes poignantly clear when his wife (Rachel Stirling) takes a several-months assignment in Switzerland, only bothering to tell him as she's packing for the trip.  Emily Blunt's Harriet Chetwood-Talbot, on the other hand, is Fred's exact opposite, passionate in her job and in her private life where she's had a whirlwind romance with a hunk of an army officer (Tom Mison) who's just been deployed to Afghanistan.  And Amr Waked's Sheikh rounds out the trio, a philosophical, quietly charismatic man who has a vision that he pursues all the more passionately because it is so impossible.  A chemistry develops among the three as Fred finds himself - much to his surprise - responding to Harriet's optimistic vivacity and to the Sheikh's belief that the more impossible a thing is, the more it is worth pursuing, even when - or rather especially when - all you have to go on is faith.  In addition to becoming not only engaged by but increasingly  optimistic about the salmon project, Fred also finds himself coming to believe that other things are also possible as his working relationship with Harriet blossoms into something else.  Between the two, Fred ends up making his own leaps of faith, with regard to the Sheikh's fantastical project and to the prospect of finding real love with Harriet.

But it is Kristin Scott  Thomas' over-the-top press secretary Patricia Maxwell with her take-no-prisoners  approach to everything who supplies the comedy.  A powerhouse on high heels, Maxwell dominates everyone else around her, up to and including the Prime Minister himself, and she has far and away the best lines in the film which she delivers with acerbic glee -  ""Is that the best you cocked-up, Oxford-educated, moronic buffoons can come up with?""  She also has the best scenes, like ones showing her at home where she's kicking her kids' butts at computer games or ordering them off to school, and you realize that she treats the government ministers above and around her exactly the same way as she handles her kids.  And the scenes showing the IM exchanges between her icon and that of the rather hapless Prime Minister are absolutely priceless.

In addition to an engaging script and fine performances by the actors, the cinematography is also quite well done, taking you from highly diverse settings of urban London, rural Scotland and the desert wadis of the Yemen (actually shot in Morocco), all beautifully shot.  The scene where the Sheikh discusses his dream project with Jones while the two are fly-fishing is imbued with a grace and tranquility gives added feeling to the Sheikh's vision and you begin to see exactly what he is talking about.

My only quibbles about the film are fairly minor.  The way in which Harriet's boyfriend's ill-timed reappearance is handled is dealt with a bit too neatly and ends up feeling out of place.  And the reactions on the part of the Sheikh and Jones when some disgruntled Yemenis attempt to sabotage the project seems more ""message"" oriented than how real people would actually react.  But those aside, the rest of the film flows quite smoothly, leaving you both entertained and with more than a bit of its quietly infectious optimism.

Recommended as a quirky but highly enjoyable film and for Kristin Scott Thomas' riotously over-the-top performance.",1333584000,58,6016,5.022132796780684

8494285,3,B0067EKY7M,"I've seldom been more torn by a film. On one hand, the concept is novel, the visuals sumptuous, the music score affecting, and much of the dialogue crackles. There were times when the movie swept me away. But the soldier boy subplot is horribly manipulative and the ending ridiculously contrived. Ewan McGregor's character should not have been married; his ache for Emily Blunt would have been more powerful if he was a lonely single man. And as appealing as they are, he did after all make a vow to his wife in the film something along the lines of staying together for better or worse. I doubt there was an opt out where ""If fate should happen to throw you together with Emily Blunt, then by all means moon over her instead."" The soldier boy character should have been junked too. His character makes little sense and seems shoehorned in. At one point he says something to Blunt that indicates he intends to fight for her. Then in the very next breath, without any motivation, he does a complete 180 which is jarring and untruthful. There's too much obvious ""raising the stakes"" in the formulaic screenplay, trying to make it all ""big"" and tying it in with world events. This is most exemplified in the Kristin Scott Thomas character. She proves she's a dynamic actress and that she is able to dominate a scene, but I found her overly broad, one-note and cartoonish. The movie would have worked better if it had been quieter, more intimate and indie. As it is, it's merely an excuse to pair McGregor and Blunt in a romantic setting and watch the sparks fly. And they do and that's enjoyable. There are many good films with contrived story lines, but very few great ones. Alas, Salmon Fishing in the Yemen is content to fall well short of greatness.",1527897600,,1750,4.594249201277956
