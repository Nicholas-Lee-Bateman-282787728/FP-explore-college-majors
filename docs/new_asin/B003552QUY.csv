They're young and have never come in contact with too many movies like this. The title is not that well known, for sure . . . but as far as this viewer is concerned . . . this is one my 20 best. I saw it in the theater when it first came out and never forgot it. GREAT MOVIE!",1293494400,16,425,3.953488372093023

4069959,4,B003552QUY,"It was years ago that I first saw the Iron Mistress and have wanted to add it to my video collection ever since. Although Historically inaccurate, the film is entertaining and the knife fighting scenes are worth watching. I don't know if the real Bowie Knife was forged from part of a meteorite but it adds a aura of mystery to the film. Anyone who likes Alan Ladd should enjoy this film for the action, Drama and the ending.",1270512000,2,425,4.3924050632911396
4069960,4,B003552QUY,"[[ASIN:B001XUSZHQ The Iron Mistress - Movie Poster - 11 x 17]

  Of course the Alamo is missing from The Iron Mistress.  To include it would nullify the theme of the movie.

  Who/what is the iron mistress should not be hard to determine.  A prerequisite to determining the answer is to know what Jim Bowie was running from in the Iron Mistress movie and knowing what eventually happened to him.

  Have the answer yet?  The reviewers that I have read to date obviously missed the obvious.

  I am tempted to give you the answer.  Hint:  It  is not  the knife.  Even though one reviewer describes the knife as Bowie's ""iron mistress,"" how can that be the answer, when by the end of the movie Bowie has rejected the knife and what it represents?  Think beyond Bowie's control.",1269820800,3,775,4.551470588235294

I remember seeing the movie when I was a youngster in the early 50's
and I became fascinated with it then.  Finally after all these years I have my own copy to watch as often as I choose......LOVE THE KNIFE>>>>>",1268956800,,424,4.134146341463414
4069962,4,B003552QUY,"Action-packed, lavish fun. Heavily fictionalized story of Jim Bowie's early years. Virginia Mayo is great  as a femme fatale. Transfer is excellent.",1268611200,,148,5.7272727272727275
4069963,4,B003552QUY,"1952's ""The Iron Mistress"", while certainly a 'B' movie, is romantic, violent, and wonderful entertainment, particularly if you're a fan of Alan Ladd. Based on Paul Wellman's novel of the life of legendary entrepreneur/adventurer Jim Bowie (of knife and Alamo fame), the film limits the story to Bowie's early life, from his impoverished days on the bayou with his brothers and mother, to his marriage to the Mexican Governor of San Antonio's daughter (the beautiful Phyllis Kirk). Along the way, he befriends famed artist/naturalist John James Audubon (George Voskovec), and falls for a petty, but beautiful New Orleans belle (Virginia Mayo), whose high station in society inspires him earn a fortune, to win her hand. Despite his success amassing riches in real estate speculation, his hopes are dashed, and he's the target of the dueling, aristocratic elite, ultimately inspiring him to design a revolutionary, deadly knife, forged from the steel of a falling star (""a bit of heaven...and of hell"").

The film bears little resemblance to the historic Bowie's life (the famous knife was actually designed by his brother, Rezin), and ignores his slave-running, embezzling, and other less-savory pursuits. Still, Ladd (whose career was waning, before ""Shane"") gives an excellent performance, both as a man of action, and as the victim of Mayo's whims. Veteran director Gordon Douglas succeeds in making a modestly-budgeted film look opulent, aided by Max Steiner's wonderful, period-flavored score.

If you are looking for a film about Jim Bowie's life in Texas, and his death at the Alamo, Republic Pictures' 1955 release, ""The Last Command"", while not a sequel to ""The Iron Mistress"" in any way, does cover this period (with giant Sterling Hayden in the Bowie role). It is even more inaccurate (particularly relating to the famous siege), but is also a quite entertaining film.

Finally, this film is available from other vendors for far less; I prefer, Amazon, in general, however, as their reliability is unmatched!",1259366400,18,2019,5.263975155279503
4069964,4,B003552QUY,"It's a great movie about the early life of James Bowie. We see the historical Sandbar Fight where Bowie was almost killed. The Sandbar Fight also gave rise to the famous Bowie knife. In the movie we see Bowie (Alan Ladd) design the knife and getting a blacksmith to forge it.
There's also romance in the movie, where the female part is played by the gorgeous Virginia Mayo.

We don't see anything of Bowie's life in Texas nor his death at the Alamo. The movie ends with Bowie going to Texas, but another movie picks up where Iron Mistress ends. It's called, ""The Last Command"", and it deals with Bowie's life and death in Texas, starring Sterling Hayden as Bowie.

But why pay $39.93 from an Amazon seller when you can get it for $19.95 from Warner Brothers?
The Iron Mistress is available on DVD through the WB web site. It's part of the Warner Archive

4069965,5,B003552QUY,"Excellent film on Bowie. While best known for his part and death at The Alamo, this film follows closely to actual events with the exception of the Natchez Sand Bar fight. A realistic but failed romance with Mayo brings Bowie to his real love in Texas.",1478304000,,252,4.5

4069971,4,B003552QUY,"This movie is often referred to as a 'B' movie...Well....perhaps..but I would say it is more of a 'B+' or even an 'A-'  Historical?  Ehh...not so much..there was man named James Bowie, he did have brother named Rezin, and one of them, (evidence is almost overwhelming that is was Rezin) designed a knife that James made famous. And James did move to Texas.  Other than that though....  More evidence suggests that it was the not the design of the knife that was so radical; it was Bowie's method of fighting with it that made the 'Bowie knife' a household word(s). And this is touched on in this movie. (One note of interest: the Bowie knife made for this movie had a long 'career;'  Besides this movie,it would be carried by Walt Disney's Jim Bowie (Ken Tobey) in ""Davy Crockett at the Alamo, (and also of course, in Alamo segment in movie made from the three Davy Crockett TV shows...), Sterling Hayden, in his turn as Jim Bowie,  would carry it in 'The Last Command Bowie,' it would used filming the ""Jim Bowie' TV series starring Scott Forbes that would run a couple of years in the 1950s, and be carried by Richard Widmark, when he was Bowie in John Waynes's spectacular 'The Alamo.""  But to return to 'The Iron Mistress'...)  Alan Ladd, (a bit small for the role but doing a pretty fair job even so) defeats an accomplishe duellist armed with a sword..(one assumes a rapier) though a dark room evens the odds a bit... And the famous Sand Bar fight is here too..more than a little modified of course..this IS Hollywood in the early 1950s of course...But the movie also features Virginia Mayo which is big plus.  After Mayo made her mark in comedies, the studio decided to take advantage of her looks and use her in 'temptress' roles, a natural for her looks and sensuality...though oddly no breath of scandal ever affixed itself to Mayo, and she was married to the same man for almost 30 years...(until his death )  And of course, history is santized as well...No hint of the land swindles or slave dealing that Bowie indulged in are hinted at..But the movie is beautifully photographed and is pretty fast paced, and drags in very few places if any...",1449273600,4,2156,4.591145833333333

4069987,3,B003552QUY,"Loosely based on Paul Wellman's novel of the same name. Alan Ladd is good, as usual; a little small for Jim Bowie though. Virginia Mayo is the perfect bitch; never cared for her- in my opinion any movie with her loses. The story has some exciting parts; knife fights etc, but fails with Bowie throwing his knife into the Mississippi River. Seems as though they ran out of money and had to end the movie quickly.

The only real difference is the casting of Virginia Mayo.  Her character is described in the book as tiny and incredibly delicate.  Virginia Mayo was many things, but delicate she ain't (and I mean that in a good way--she was one of my first childhood crushes).  In fact, she looks like she could teach Alan Ladd a thing or two.

The plot focuses on Ladd (Jim Bowie) falling in love with Mayo and she taking advantage of his feelings. As a result, eight people die. It also focuses on Bowie having a knife made for him from a meteor and using it in several fights. He becomes so attached to his knife that people call it his iron mistress. Bowie is depicted as a man who does not want to kill people, but is forced to do it.

4070014,2,B003552QUY,"Jim Bowie (1796-1836) was a famous 19th Century pioneer and soldier, famous for his enormous knife, sometimes referred to affectionately as an ""Arkansas Toothpick"". He has been portrayed in films by Jason Patric (2004), James Arness (1987), Richard Widmark (1960), Sterling Hayden (1955), Stuart Randall (1953), and Robert Armstrong (1939). Scott Forbes played him in the TV series (1956-8). In this film he is played by Alan Ladd.

Time - 1820s. Location - New Orleans.

Think Alan Ladd (1913-64) and you think ""Shane"", a film he made one year after this film. He originally was propelled into fame as a result of ""This Gun for Hire"" (1942) and followed it with memorable performances in ""Two Years Before the Mast"" and ""the Blue Dahlia"", both in 1946. ""Shane"" cemented his A list credentials and he remained a top star until his death in 1964.

FWIW - This was Ladd's first film for Warner Brothers, after 10+ years with Paramount where he did his best work, including ""Shane"" which, though released after ""The Iron Mistress"" was actually made prior.

Ladd's co-star is the beautiful Virginia Mayo (1920-2005). She's best remembered for her role opposite Jimmy Cagney in ""White Heat"" (1949), one of more than 50 films she starred in. Mayo had an interesting career, often playing ""not the girl next door"", although I liked her best in comedies like ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" (1947) and ""The Princess and the Pirate"" (1944). She said that Ladd was her favorite leading man.

Joseph Calleia (1897-1975) appeared in more than 50 films, but is probably best known for playing Buldeo in ""Jungle Book"" (1942) and Orson Welles's sidekick in ""Touch of Evil"" (1958). I liked him best as the Italian lothario in ""Riff raff"" (1935).

Tough Anthony Caruso (1916-2003) plays ""Black Jack"", a crooked saloon owner. Caruso appeared in more than 100 films and an equal number of TV programs, almost always as the bad guy. He could play an Indian (""Saskatchewan"", ""Drum Beat""), a Mexican (""Passion"", ""Santa Fe Passage""), a gangster (""City of Shadows""), or a cowboy ""(""The Big Land""). Interestingly enough Caruso appeared in the TV series ""Adventures of Jim Bowie"" (1956).

Director Gordon Douglas (1907-93) was a studio director and as such had a varied career. His films range from comedies like Laurel and Hardy's ""Saps at Sea"" (1940) and Sinatra's ""Robin and the 7 Hoods"" (1967), to the sci fi classic ""Them"" (1954) and westerns like ""The Great Missouri Raid"" (1951) and ""Yellowstone Kelly"" (1959).

Austrian composer Max Steiner (1888-1971) does a great job. Between 1935 and 1956 he was nominated for an Oscar 19 times, and won for ""Since You Went Away"" (1944), ""Now Voyager"" (1942), and ""The Informer"" (1935). He was so well known that he appeared on a 33 cent stamp (1999) along with Dimitri Tiomkin and Alfred Newman.

The film is notoriously ahistorical, but nobody really expects this to be a history lesson. As a film per se it's pretty standard stuff, and at times a little boring. Virginia Mayo is the scene stealer as a scheming wench, and the Technicolor is spectacular as is the musical score for Max Steiner.

Fans of Alan Ladd can find much better films to watch, and fans of Jim Bowie can find much better film portrayals. The only real treat here is Virginia Mayo's performance, but even here she has so many better performances elsewhere it's hardly worth the time to wade through this film.",1307577600,2,3404,4.883882149046793

Jim Bowie and others joined the revolt against the military dictator who overthrew the government. The Texicans wanted their rights under the 1824 Constitution, which was modeled on the US Constitution. The Alamo movies tell about their last stand. If Bowie wasn't at the Alamo he would be little-known. Note how Alan Ladds short height is adjusted in this movie. In some scenes his belt line is higher than the other mans. This movie is slow moving at times.",1517875200,,2218,4.404878048780488
