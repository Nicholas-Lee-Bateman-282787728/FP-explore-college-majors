8094700,1,B000BZ8MU4,The ONE routine taught in this DVD is cute but it's not for youth 5-10 squads. There is so much talk and kidding around and hem haw before they actually get to the routine and show you what it looks like. I can't use it and it takes to long to get through all the documentary stuff to the dance stuff....,1244073600,2,304,4.0
8094701,1,B000BZ8MU4,I didn't even put the DVD in to play it.  When it arrived it was scratched ALL over! There was no way I was going to keep it so I ended up returning it.  Perhaps other purchasers will have better luck but I'd suggest just making up your own routines.,1195603200,,250,3.98
8094702,3,B000BZ8MU4,"The video has two dance routines. This video was not a help for teaching/learning cheering nor cheer-dancing. It's basic Hip-Hop. And the girls are too young for the skimpy outfits and all the gyrating and shaking going on in the dances. I know I wouldn't want my 14 year old out there like that. Other than that, if you have NO talent for choreography or dance at all, and would like to borrow a routine, this DVD is a good starting point. I purchased ""Cheer!"". Although very,very basic, you would at least have the basic movements for cheerleading. I've been dancing for over 10 years now. Those of you that have any dance or choreographic skills, ""Cheer!"" would be the perfect DVD to get you started. From that point on, you can hit the ground running making up your own cheers and dance routines. Urban Cheer and Dance, I could have saved myself some money.",1189555200,4,861,4.561290322580645
8094703,4,B000BZ8MU4,"I bought this DVD due to,  I'm having Shoulder surgery in weeks and my cheer squad really needed new material. I coach [...] girls with little to no experience in dance or cheerleading.  This product states it can be used for beginners however,  to be Very honest my girls had a very difficult time with the dance moves!
The routines are put together well,  I'd maybe use it for a older squad with dance exp.",1184803200,3,408,4.4
8094704,4,B000BZ8MU4,"the moves are fun.  choreography well done.  but, i was expecting and desiring more instruction.  i found this dvd to be more entertaining than helpful in learning.  the insider view of getting ready for competition and stuff was interesting, and they definitely plugged themselves as choreographers, but, if you are looking to actually learn the routines, be ready for a lot of work analyzing, rewinding, etc.  but, if you are a quick study and you can see a move and duplicate it easily - you'll love the unique and energized routines.",1169251200,,537,4.857142857142857
8094705,5,B000BZ8MU4,"This is a very well done DVD that is worth your money. It has the latest moves and awesome hip hop music and beats. The routines are shown in real time, slow motion, front and back and sides. It's executed at a good pace. Not too fast, not too slow, just perfect to learn it while watching it.  The teaching is of excellent quality. The names of the steps, like the A-Town stomp and the Chicken Head, the Heel Toe, Freezes and breakdance steps are shown at the bottom of the screen to let you know what they are. This is a good video to show your squad and improve your dancing skills. It is entertaining and of high professional quality. You should have no problem learning it.",1160956800,5,678,4.296875
