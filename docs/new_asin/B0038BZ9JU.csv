4084450,5,B0038BZ9JU,"Of course comparisons can be drawn, content-wise, to ""Precious"" and ""An Education,"" all released 2009, and I'm convinced that because of the successes of those two films this gem got somewhat lost in the shuffle.  ""Fish Tank"" deserves to be seen (won the BAFTA for Outstanding British Film, was nominated for the Palm D'or and won the Jury Prize at Cannes) and can fully stand on its own two feet--it is a great film with great performances and cinematography.  There are a couple reviews on here and more on IMDb.com that can do the film more justice than I can.  I would however like to take the opportunity to share my experience with the Blu-Ray version of this film.

There is currently no Blu-ray version of ""Fish Tank"" available on amazon.com but I did find it available on amazon.co.uk.  The Blu-ray I received was the Artificial Eye release (011BD).  I have had good results with Artificial Eye in the past when I ordered an international version of ""Hidden"" (Cach)--the difference though, ""Hidden"" was region-free, it had A, B & C on the case.  ""Fish Tank"" on the other hand is clearly region coded ""B.""  I'll admit I was a bit worried about it working in my Blu-ray player, but I am excited to announce that it did indeed work (I am using a Panasonic DMP-BD55).  Movie played fine and looked great--curiously though in 4:3 (the old standard TV frame rather than the current 16:9 or any other cinematic aspect ratio) which is stated as the Director's Approved Ratio.  Special features on this version include: Andrea Arnold's Oscar winning short film ""Wasp""; trailers for ""Fish Tank"" & ""Red Road""; and a photo gallery of Holly Horner's stills from the set of ""Fish Tank.""  Despite the film playing perfectly, a few of the special features did not.  Neither the trailers nor the short film played correctly--no image, I did hear the audio.  I have to attribute this to some sort of post-authoring.  It's safe to say that although this version of ""Fish Tank"" originated in the UK they didn't block its playability in other regions.  I am guessing that the short and the trailers were not authored to disc in the same way or from similar source materials that the film was, thus the standard PAL playback issues.  Sad.  After ""Fish Tank"" I was very curious to see more of Andrea Arnold's work, especially an early short--I will do some web-searching...  The photo gallery did work.  The final plus to this purchase was that I ended up paying 14.12 (under $22) which included shipping!

Be adventurous and track down the films that you miss in the theater.",1271894400,3,2562,4.714606741573034
4084451,5,B0038BZ9JU,"""Fish Tank"" was written and directed by Andrea Arnold. It is a gritty, disturbing coming-of-age story for Mia played by Katie Jarvis, a fifteen year old girl who wishes to be a dancer but lacks raw talent and makes up for it with raw attitude against everyone in her life until the introduction of her mother's new boyfriend, Connor played by Michael Fassbender makes a major impact on her life.

First off, I never deciphered the title. Why Fish Tank? There is a fish in it and some swimming in the water but at no point did I feel this girl was trapped in her life and while she maintained a bit of routine aka swimming in circles, I felt she went through a great deal of journey and changing up of her habits due to new circumstances introduced into her environment so....why?

Next, the main character Mia is almost impossible to like. The biggest problem is that she is difficult to understand when she is speaking and at least 25% of her lines were lost. She is hostile and spews bile out of her mouth at anyone who even glances at her the wrong way. The littlest thing sets her off and even when someone takes a chance on her and shows her attention, tries to get her to smile and encourages her to pursue her goals, she'll turn on them in a heartbeat. Granted, not everyone here is deserving of good behavior, in fact all the characters have a dark streak in them and rub each other the wrong way, but her temper is so explosive that it becomes difficult to make excuses for her purely based on environment and genetics. She has a few fleeting moments of happiness and has a very pretty smile in those rare moments but she never holds on to it and pushes it away as if it makes her vulnerable. This is one tough cookies, almost inaccessible to anyone who speaks to her until a particularly hot older man breaks her down.

All that being said, Katie Jarvis' first movie role as Mia was pretty amazing. The unsentimental presence that she stays guarded with throughout is consistent and compelling for a new performer. Her own dream is to be able to dance but her stiff movements and lack of a gift for rhythm makes all of her moves, no matter how rehearsed seem forced and unnatural. She is extremely defensive and secretive about her dream until she lets another character deeper into her life. The peeling away of the layers and slowly exposing the depths of her character also reveals ulterior motivations of the others in her family. Jarvis' talent is proven in how unsettling the movie feels until the eventual mild, calm ending.

The most enjoyable (if there is something to enjoy here) part of the movie was Michael Fassbender as Connor. Obviously he is an attractive man shirtless but he has an effortless charm and walks the line perfectly between responsible adult and possible lech for a minor. You can't tell what side he is leaning towards because all of his actions and remarks can be seen in both lights and it really keeps you guessing throughout. Either way, the impression is given that he cares about Mia for some reason and encourages her to help her succeed and perhaps the factor that he might be the only person to do that for her wrapped up in a sexy package feeds Mia's hidden desire for him.

The story was riveting and difficult to look away from. It ties your insides up into a knot and stays that way for the two hour duration and is so disturbing that it sticks with you and I have a stomach ache sitting here immediately afterward. The acts were well set up gradually increasing the stakes and suspense and a few scenes I couldn't look away even if I wanted to! The shaky cam was only occasionally distracting and overall served the movie well for realism. The lighting was not always lit in such a way that you could see the characters and the experimentation with light and shadow and focus made the reality take on a different feel adding suspense and confusion. Using these techniques, the film takes on the feel of a waking nightmare while displaying a window into British lower-class.",1270944000,9,4028,4.519890260631001
4084452,5,B0038BZ9JU,"Tilbury Town railroad station, Tilbury, Essex, England - a common event unfolds on the train platform. A young woman is arguing with her boyfriend. But what seems like a natural occurrence to the naked eye is a turning point in nineteen-year-old Katie Jarvis's life, as an Oscar-winning director, Andrea Arnold, was watching the argument unfold from across the train platform. And thus begins the story of Fish Tank, a gritty and gripping 2009 drama, set in England, directed by Andrea Arnold. Katie Jarvis, the volatile and angry girlfriend on the platform, stars as Mia Williams, a fifteen-year-old binge drinking high-school dropout, living in a small tenement with her single mother Joanne, played by the British Independent Film Award nominee Kierston Waering, and her younger sister Tyler, played by Rebecca Griffiths. Mia is an expelled student, a volatile adolescent, and a passionate street dancer. After a day of picking fights with fellow street-dancing females, illegally purchasing alcohol from street dealers, avoiding a conference with a secondary school representative and trying to rescue a white horse from a seemingly abandoned lot, the teenager returns home to find that her mother has brought home a young man, Connor, played by Hunger's Michael Fassbender. Connor is a seemingly nice man, who takes Mia, Joanne and Tyler on a family drive to go fishing at a secluded pond. But Connor is sheltered beneath a shell that hides the man's true colors, as his eyes are not focused on Mia's drinking, smoking, abusive mother - they are focused on Mia.

The style in which Fish Tank is filmed resembles that of Christian Mungiu's 4 luni, 3 sptmni i 2 zile (known in English by 4 months, 3 weeks and 2 days), in that what is being filmed is almost a documentary. The camera shakes when Mia is attacked by three tough boys when trying to rescue the white horse. The camera shakes when Mia chases after Connor's car after he walks out on her mother, and as Mia flees from the clutches of the three thugs in the lot. A handheld camera is used for scenes when Mia is in the abandoned apartment, practicing her hip-hop dancing to Ja Rule and Nas. The brilliant and engaging ""new"" camera style enables the audience to engage more sufficiently in Mia's life as she lives it.

Rarely do I ever close my eyes in films, and rarely do I have to reach over and hold the hand of whomever is sitting next to me in the theatre, whether it be my mother, father, sister, or that woman sitting next to me who keeps chatting with her girlfriend, but Fish Tank and Katie Jarvis's exhilarating, awe-inspiring, heartbreaking performance made me do both. Her role pins you to your seat from the very first scene to the very last moments, which has been seen once before this year in a young newcomer's performance in a motion picture - Gabourey ""Gabby"" Sidibe in Precious: Based on the Novel ""Push"" by Sapphire. In fact, Fish Tank has been referred to as Britain's Precious, two motion pictures with hauntingly similar yet eerily different plotlines - a high-school dropout, living in a bad area, with an abusive parent and troubled lives. Like Sidibe, the debutante Katie Jarvis outshines and upstages veteran actors such as Michael Fassbender and Kierston Waering, and offers an authentic and breathtaking role in an unfortunately relatable part.

Fish Tank: Directed by Andrea Arnold. Starring Katie Jarvis, Michael Fassbender, Kierston Waering, Rebecca Griffiths and Harry Treadaway.",1269648000,64,3477,4.950342465753424

""A mother and daughter find themselves locked in an ugly battle over the same man in this drama from writer and director Andrea Arnold. Mia Williams (Katie Jarvis) is 15 years old and lives in a shabby apartment block with her mother, Joanne (Kierston Wareing), and younger sister, Tyler (Rebecca Griffiths). Mia is a reckless and rebellious teenager who frequently argues with her mother and sister and has run afoul of the authorities at school, leading to her being suspended. With plenty of time on her hands, Mia spends her days drinking when she can find alcohol and partying in a empty flat near her apartment. Joanne is a single mother, and she's begun dating a new man, Connor (Michael Fassbender); when Joanne brings him home to meet the girls, Mia is immediately attracted to him, and it's soon clear Connor feels the same way about her. Mia attempts to seduce Connor to take him away from her mother, and when she succeeds, Joanne's greatest anger is not with the man who has slept with her underaged daughter, but the girl who is now a rival for the affections of her lover.""

The film won the Jury Prize at Cannes in 2009, and Andrea Arnold has followed it up with 2 other outstanding movies. This is a must have for your movie collection, and bluray is absolutely beautiful.",1435881600,2,1465,4.674418604651163

4084481,5,B0038BZ9JU,"I saw Andrea Arnold's ""Fish Tank"" the day after seeing ""Cedar Rapids,"" and it restored my faith in movie-making.  This is a very good movie, one in which the casting, the acting, the photography, the music, and the narrative all work together very satisfyingly to show you something humanly interesting -- ""to make you see,"" as Conrad said a good story should do.  What we see here is an unexceptional life, and the story has its generic elements (""coming of age story,"" let's say), but the young woman, Mia (Katie Jarvis), whose story it is, is revealed with great clarity and great compassion by a film-maker who understands how particular family circumstances, education (or lack of it), as well as economic and social contexts can all work, along with an individual's personal aspirations at a particular stage of development to make her the person that she is -- and the movie is just sentimental (or open-hearted) enough to let us nourish the hope that as her circumstances and self-awareness change she may not always be under the kinds of pressures that she is under at fifteen, her age in the movie.

The story is pretty simple -- Mia lives with her single mother, Joanne (Kierston Wareing), and younger sister, Tyler (Rebecca Griffiths) in the Mardyke Estate in Essex, across the Thames estuary from London, in a low-rent apartment, about which I will only say that the decor and the surroundings tell you almost all you need to know, and Arnold's camera takes its time in capturing it throughout the movie.  It isn't a slum by any means, but we are a long way here from Mike Leigh's middle-class (even lower middle-class) settings.  Joanne must be in her thirties, but she seems to be trying to keep up a youthful look -- and she has the faded prettiness of some southern rural beauties in some American movies.  She doesn't seem to work -- is she on public assistance? -- and spends a lot of time dancing with herself in a kind of alcohol-induced haze.  Is it her dancing that makes Mia aspire to be a dancer, albeit to a hip-hop beat?  But that IS Mia's aspiration, although it becomes clear very early that she's not that good -- no ""Billy Elliott"" uplift in this movie, I'm afraid.  Into the lives of this family comes Connor (Michael Fassbender), her mother's latest boyfriend, and Mia is of an age where Connor's masculine attractiveness and his sexual relation with her mother (it's a small apartment) are unavoidably brought to her consciousness.  Some fairly predictable things follow that I won't go into to avoid ""spoilers,"" but what isn't so predictable is what's revealed about the characters of all concerned as the narrative develops -- so there is a sense in which we do have the familiar elements of a coming-of-age story, but made fresh by the attention to and respect for the individual qualities of the characters.

Mia is certainly ""neglected,"" from any social-work perspective, but she isn't treated badly in an obvious way, and her feistiness and the specificity that Katie Jarvis brings to the character make it clear that she isn't a standard victim.  She has compassion, and finds an outlet for it -- the white horse: enough said -- and that compassion makes understandable some elements of the movie's later sections that could otherwise have been either sentimentalized or sensationalized.  It's amazing that Jarvis -- like Agata Trzebuchowska in Pavel Pawlikowski's ""Ida"" -- had no acting experience prior to this movie, but where Trzebuchowska couldn't bring Ida to life, Jarvis succeeds marvelously.  The ""big name"" in the movie is Fassbender, and his Connor is very fine here.  For all his flaws, and they are many, he's not really a sexual predator and he's not altogether undomestic.  He's not even sleazy, but there are a mixture of elements in the characterization of Connor, as there are in Jarvis's representation of Mia, that are made to seem totally plausibly human.  Arnold's sense of these characters and the actors' abilities to execute her vision of them are large parts of what makes this film so compelling.  Add to that, the eye for this particular urban landscape, the touch of the rural environs, and the hip-hop soundtrack, and it all adds up to a very rewarding, if sometimes uncomfortable, experience.",1423872000,2,4264,4.866022099447513

4084496,3,B0038BZ9JU,"First of all, let me just say that this film is absolute eye-candy. Superbly shot and achingly beautiful at times. The actors are very, very good at making you forget they're acting.
Perhaps that's why some people are captivated by it, despite the fact that it features a plot that covers no new ground whatsoever. It's great to make films that feel like a slice of reality, but if that reality is one that's been portrayed ad nauseam in British film, then what's the point really? I literally anticipated the latter 3/4's of the film 1/4 of the way in. It's that predictable. When people say 'reality is stranger than fiction', it's because real life is rarely predictable, especially for the lower economic classes.

The underage sex thing was also off putting. I couldn't help but feel the confusion, & hostility with the 15 YO main  character as she grappled with issues of neglect, low income, infatuation and ultimately rejection. The movie was well put for seeing life in the eyes of a young woman dealing with all those issues living in the lower streets of London.

I don't know who Katie Jarvis is, but her acting is brilliant. Her anger, fear, hope, first love with an older man...it's heartbreaking to watch.

She sleeps with her moms man-friend even though she's underage and he's evidently married and has a kid elsewhere. She tracks him down when he leaves, and nearly kills his kid. He hits her.
She is threatened with being shipped off to a reform school, and runs away with her would-be rapist. Leaving her mother and little sister to whatever fate has in store.

4084509,5,B0038BZ9JU,"The coming of age of Mia a fifteen year old working class school drop out. Mia lives in a council flat in Essex, England with her single mother and a younger sister. All the characters are coarse in their language, their manners, and especially in their sexual relations, but the director manage to capture moments of moral delicacy and complexity of feeling alongside actions that are brutal, heedless, perverse or spiteful. The surroundings are squalid and depressing, but there's a vitality, and unexpected pastoral interludes. All of it is recorded with powerful, dispassionate accuracy as well as a kind of sympathetic inwardness. The girl, played with fierce conviction by Katie Jarvis, has to contend, among much else, with the advent of an attractive male (Michael Fassbender) a deceptively paternal boyfriend of her angry, somewhat infantile mother. Her conflicted feelings about him are conveyed largely non verbally and through intimately subjective, really astonishingly effective camera work and direction that is both tough minded and sensitive. There is wonderful music, much of it presented as proceeding from a source that is visible on screen rather than as unseen accompaniment. The music, mostly old school hip hop, comes from CDs that Jarvis' character practices her dance moves to. Critics have compared Fish Tank to Truffaut's The 400 Blows.

Fassbender was good, as always, always sticks to those somewhat risky roles like this one. I think maybe this once scene towards the end is what really confused me and just seemed a little out of character and just odd in a way.

If you haven't seen the film, do so. This is the sort of film that will be studied in film courses.
This is how it's done. This isn't a film to see with popcorn and friends.
This is art.
This is Art without being in danger of pretension or the self service of trying too hard to be 'Art'.
There's a reason it was inducted into the Criterion collection the same year it came out.
Great photography, acting, pacing, directing, restraint, writing, editing, music - and heart.
The film is about truth and bleakness and love - and the struggle to be free.
And when light does finally come through, it's made all the more powerful because of the darkness.
The ending with the three women together is understated, powerful and masterful.
It reminds me of the ending in City Lights, although not on the same level I suppose,
but with the same sentiment and grace and artistry.
This film may not be for everybody.

Living with in a housing project with her foul mouthed little sister and young mom (who sees her as competition) is a trying experience to say the least. she does have something going for her... dance(kinda). Mia is real into hip hop culture and wants to become a dancer(see the movie for the result)the films soundtrack go's great with every scene and certain plot points prove that ""life's a bitch"". This film is so great in that it captures the broken spirit of the characters and you feel like your watching real people deal with real issues. As a American it was refreshing to see another side of London (The ghetto)and that's one of the things I loved about the film. So in closing a round of applause for Andrea Arnold and the cast for a terrific movie and the criterion collection for bringing it stateside. Go see this asap",1345248000,,1077,4.5
4084515,5,B0038BZ9JU,"This movie is about a young girl, Mia, living in the slums of England with her dysfunctional family. She has a bad habit of getting into trouble and starting fights when a handsome man Connor (Michael Fassbender) finds his way into her mother's life. A tension exists between Connor and Mia but it is unclear at first what kind of tension this is. They strike up an unlikely relationship and Mia finds someone who will tell her she's worth more than the trouble she's so fond of causing. This movie really grabs you from the start, and isn't afraid to thrust the reality of the England slums in your face. Gritty sexuality and dysfunctional relationships abound, this movie is NOT afraid to be raw.

It isn't so gritty that it is distasteful though, and I think anyone who's in the mood for an unconventional story will love this film. Nothing is expected and everything seems so realistic in this story. You'll really forget what's going on around you as you get wrapped up in the world of Mia.",1344902400,,995,4.589887640449438

4084517,4,B0038BZ9JU,"Independent films have gotten less......independent over the years. The casts and budgets have gotten more expensive making them more like Hollywood versions of heir distant cousins. Not the case here.

Here's the scoop. Mia lives in some low rent housing with no father and a mother who won't grow up. She has a little sister but the two don't communicate on any meaningful level. Mom gets a new boyfriend who seems really cool and might be someone who might help her break the chain. No such luck.

Kate Jarvis plays Mia. She's 15 years old. Doesn't attend school and only seems to care about dancing, which she does mostly to the accompaniment of gangster rap. She's mean to people. Swears a lot. Drinks and generally gets into trouble. But she can't abide cruelty to animals. She feels trapped. Mom's new guy is fun but he also eggs her on to excel. Gets her to try dancing to other kinds of music. He gets the whole family out to the country where he teaches her to fish with her hands. He seems to genuinely care for her and can be good for her. She sees the possibilities. It all comes crashing down when certain things come to light. But whatever happens, she's getting out.

This is real indy stuff. A lot of hand held camera and natural lighting. Jarvis does a great job as Mia. You see how she gets to realize that where she's at is nowhere, but there has only been a glimpse of a beacon (in mom's boyfriend) as to where she can go. Michael Fassbender, the only name I recognized, does a great job as the boyfriend. He seems, at first, like a decent sort. It hurts when you see his true colors. The music is mostly Gangster Rap and Hip-Hop. Good attention is paid to location. It's shot in such a way as to show the world happening around her. It's a world she's not part of.

This is pretty hard edged stuff. It's not a ""Juno"" kind of flick. It's much tougher than that, filled with people who live outside society. If you're at all into this sort of thing this is about as good as it gets.",1334275200,5,2002,4.359249329758713
4084518,4,B0038BZ9JU,"15-year-old Mia (Katie Jarvis) lives on an ""estate"" on the outskirts of London.  If estate sounds fancy, it actually is the British equivalent of the projects.  A tall, drab, run-down apartment building.  She lives there with her mother Joanne and younger sister Tyler.  Skinny and carrying some heavy acne, Mia spends her days wandering around the neighborhood and sneaking into an empty apartment so she can listen to music and work on her dancing.  She's moody, foul-mouthed to the extreme, and deeply misses a kind presence in her life.  Her mom makes no secret of the fact that her two children are nothing but a bother and interference in her social life.  Mia apparently has no interest in school and quite frankly, doesn't seem to have much to offer the world.

This is the basic set up for the much -praised film from up-and-coming filmmaker Andrea Arnold.  Shot in a hand-held style on a shoe-string budget, FISH TANK is interested in exploring the life (and inner-life) of this one specific teenager.  She comes from poverty and neglect.  She's not experienced much affection in her life.  She's angry but also has impulses that draw her to beauty, whether towards a horse kept in a nearby deserted lot or for the simple pleasures of a drive into the country.  Our initial reaction to Mia, whom we meet as the camera follows her wandering around the estate (Arnold spends A LOT of time literally following the jogging-suit-wearing Mia as she walks around), is not positive.  ""What a horrible brat!"" is the first reaction, followed by a feeling that this young lady is a hopeless waste of anyone's time and energy.

Then her mother meets a guy, Connor (Michael Fassbender).  Connor is handsome, charming, has a decent job and makes mom happy, which makes mom nicer.  Connor also provides Mia with some much needed positive attention.  He compliments her dancing.  He takes the family to the country and shows them beautiful sights.  We are shown how his simple attention awakens something in Mia.  He is awakening hope.  He is reminding Mia that gentle human contact is desirable.  And he also appears to be stirring a physical response from Mia.  The viewer can see that what Mia NEEDS is a father figure...but she is mistaking that need as a need for physical attention...for sex, perhaps.

The tension of this film (which is actually pretty palpable at times) is in the wondering where the relationship between these two is headed.  Will they find their ways into appropriate roles?  Or will the chemistry between them pollute what started out so well?  And suddenly, we are rooting for Mia...because we see how the right choices could really turn things around.

The story-telling style, as I said, is to pretty much just follow Mia around, whether she is doing important things or mundane things.  Young Katie Jarvis is a natural and even though she seems to be a typical sullen teenager, she lets us see enough on her face to understand that her inner-life is a bit richer and more complex than her exterior.  It's one of the most convincing portrayals of a teenager I've seen.  However, Director Arnold does spend just a bit too much time photographing Mia walking.  Of two hour running time, I think we spend 20 minutes just watching Mia stroll around.  That's 10 minutes too much.  The filmmaker is perhaps just a bit too much in love with her naturalistic filming style and forgets that she's also making a piece of entertainment.

All the acting is good.  Fassbender, before he became a rising star, is virile and charming.  All the minor performers come across well.  This is a tiny little story, but told with great conviction and commitment...resulting in a surprisingly gripping movie.

The Criterion Blu-ray is excellent as always.  The filming uses natural light, and the blu ray captures that well, for better and worse.  The bonus materials are decent but uninspired.  However, the essay included in the booklet is great...it puts the film into perspective into the larger genre of ""exploring British lower-class life via naturalistic filming"" that folks like Ken Loach made so resonant.  But it also deeply explores the film and illuminates what makes it unique and what makes it work so well.",1327622400,8,4223,4.862552594670407

Well maybe it's the subject matter or maybe no one can understand these blue collar Brits!  Anyway, the movie finally arrived thanks to a new Criterion edition.  They almost always do an excellent job with their product, but what's with the 4:3 aspect ratio?  Was this movie shot this way for British TV or something?  I had to turn on the subtitles to understand these Cockneys as well.  They are for the hearing impaired however, telling us every little dog bark or car passing as well as translating the language. I'm all for that but there is no English only subtitle option.  Now that's out of the way...I have no idea what the title refers to.  I don't recall any fish tanks in the movie.  Katie Jarvis gives a break out performance playing a 15 year old (she was actually 18) girl living in a tenement apartment complex in Essex.  She's a young tough who takes no crap and usually dishes out her own.  Obviously it doesn't help if you're the shy type with these teens.  She takes a fancy to her still young mum's (Kierston Wareing) new boyfriend (Michael Fassbender, 32 by the way). He flirts a little but is clearly more interested in mum.  One night that changes when mum passes out drunk.  Yeah, a little creepy now.  In any case young Mia (Jarvis) becomes upset when Fassbender's character bolts.  She tracks him down only to find out he has a family of his own.  More tension ensues as Mia kidnaps his young daughter.  We don't know what's going to happen.  The elements of the story are unsettling but there is no denying the quality of the film and its director Andrea Arnold.

(Luis Buuel)

Andrea Arnold made a couaregous and even challenging film respect the  hopelessness projects of a voiceless youth who intends to search a beacon in the dark to give meaning to their lives.

A mother -dismissed about the world and inmersed in an eternal mist of alcohol and frivolity- and her two daughters. The eldest (Katie Jarvis) prone to break all the rules, fighting against everything she considers deprived of freedom (The obsessive idea of freeing the mare) endowed with a marvelous quality - dance spirit - willing to prove the whole world she has talent to spare and even more to tantalize her lover's mother , carves in relief a desoltae scene in the heart of a soulless city.

The finale sequence would seem to send us to that escape to anywhere of The four hundred blows' protagonist.

Touching, disturbing, taering and compelling film that must be seen.",1315612800,2,959,4.753012048192771
4084524,2,B0038BZ9JU,"When I was 12, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie The Tracey Fragments (even though it has received a good amount of bad reviews). It was like I had been waiting all my life to see it - to know that someone else in the world could be having the same crazy things I had experienced..and to know it's sometimes alright to feel hateful, ungrateful, and depressed. This was because I found the situations, characters, and emotions GENUINE. My point is that Fish Tank failed to live up to my expectations.

I cannot remember all the reasons why Fish Tank doesn't appeal to me, so I will simply refute its laudatory reviews and anything else I find overrated.
-Just because a teenager lives in a not-so-nice building, enjoys drinking, and dropped out of schools does NOT mean that she is a ""victim."" To be honest, I was upset/jealous at how nice her room looked, how casual her mom was, how she owned so much money to buy booze all the time (plus her clothes and music player), and mostly how she could practically do whatever without her parent calling the police on her or nagging 24/7.
-Mia is definitely not a ""passionate street dancer."" She just sways around unsynchronized with the music and doesn't seem to work hard on anything. I thought it was hypocritical that she messed with those other dancing girls and kept on chuckling whenever her mom's boyfriend kept on saying ""I think you're great."" Watch Take the Lead if you like lower-class, teenage dancers.
-What was she thinking when she tried to ""rescue"" the white horse? Let it run away and either get captured again or starve to death?
-It is uncertain that Mia had a ""rough"" childhood because she seems to frequently roughen her little sister's childhood. If she really knew how arduous it was to grow up and cared for her sister like at the end of the movie, there would not be a detached attitude between them.
-Why does Mia keep on messing with others? She seems to have never been slapped, robbed, or threatened with a weapon.

To finish for now, I cannot sympathize with Mia or the lack of depth in the storyline. Viewers are left without understanding why each character acted the way he or she did.",1313884800,4,2159,4.590673575129534
4084525,1,B0038BZ9JU,"I suppose if you just looked at the acting, this movie would be worthy of being in the Criterion Collection of films but I don't watch a movie merely for the acting. I watch it for a cohesive story and plot line, which this film sorely lacks. You keep watching because you hope something is going to happen but nothing really does. You're just following around this troubled girl around in her daily (albeit screwed up) English life. I got to the end like, ""That's it?"" No real ending, no real point to the story itself. Not sure what people saw in this movie. If this were a book, I would never have finished it out of frustration.",1309824000,8,632,4.364406779661017
4084526,5,B0038BZ9JU,"15-year old Mia lives with her single Mom and foul-mouthed little sister in some seamy housing project in the UK.  Alienated from most aspects of life, she knocks heads with girls her own age.  She has a tempestuous relationship with her Mom.  She has no boyfriend.  School is not going well.  Her sole outlet and solace is dancing.  She uses a vacant tenement to practice her hip-hop dance moves and routines with her iPod blaring.  Life is bleak.

Life starts to change when her Mom takes a lover, the charming Irish Connor.  Connor befriends Mia, compliments her, shows kindness and encourages her to pursue her dancing dream.  Mia spots a local ad seeking ""adult female dancers"" and sends in a home-made audition film.  Her relationship with her mother's boyfriend takes a sharp turn, setting in motion a surprising sequence of events.

Eventually, Mia packs her bags and decides to move out.  On her way out of the flat, she spots her mother dancing, undulating to Nas and ""Life's a Bitch.""  Her mother barely registers the fact that Mia is moving out.
Mia starts dancing with her mother.  The little sister joins in, dancing in time with the others.  The pet pit-bull Tennant lies on the floor, rapt in attention, looking puzzled.  Great scene!

This story kept my attention for a full two hours.  It is gritty and powerful.  In the final scene, a heart-shaped nylon helium balloon floats ascends high above the grimy public housing project as Mia and her new boyfriend motor off to Cardiff.

FISH TANK blew me away.  Maybe the best film I've seen in 2011.

Tip:  Watch it with subtitles on; the Brit accents are so thick it may be otherwise hard to understand the dialogue.",1309564800,6,1680,4.713793103448276
4084527,5,B0038BZ9JU,"""Fish Tank"" (2009) is an odd blend of ""Wasp"" (Andrea Arnold's 2003 short film) and ""A Tree Grows In Brooklyn"".  The closing scene where Mia (Katie Jarvis) is saying goodbye to her little sister was especially evocative of the last words in Betty Smith's ""A Tree Grows In Brooklyn""; when Francie is about to leave and takes one last look over at the fire escape where 10-year-old Florry Wendy is reading a book, then whispers ""Good-bye, Francie"".

The film is not for everyone but if you like naturalistic acting and a gritty (often dreary) story you would be well served to track down this film.  It is a film of in-your-face close-ups and the 4:3 aspect ratio was a perfect choice for this style.  A wider frame would have diminished the intensity while adding nothing.

What Arnold does better than any director I can think of is her acting-for-the-camera direction of young actresses.  This was certainly true with the three children in ""Wasp"", who seemed to effortlessly give Arnold just the underplayed performances she needed.  In ""Fish Tank"" she gently guides Jarvis toward a performance full of gritty authenticity.  And she scores again with Rebecca Griffith's tragicomic portrayal of little sister Tyler (with lines as funny as they are poignant).

Griffith's character is especially important because at its core this is a  story of free will vs destiny.  And Mia must recognize her destiny if she is to change it.  This recognition comes with the death of the Irish Traveler horse (symbolized by the chain and concrete block that once constrained it) and with the realization that she and her ""chip-off-the-same-block"" younger sister are the same person at different stages; traveling the same road to an inevitable nothing.  This motivates her to break out of the rut into which she was born, a track where one is distracted by superficial false hopes from seeking real opportunity. Her new road may end badly but she has nothing to lose.

Another nicely directed naturalistic performance is turned in by Sydney Mary Nash as Keira.  Her scenes are probably the best in the film, they certainly were the most difficult.

4084530,5,B0038BZ9JU,"Since lots of people have already pointed out many of the worthy aspects of Andrea Arnold's Fish Tank, I'll just mention a couple of other things that struck me. First of all: When you get this film I recommend watching the three short films first. These films cue you into Arnold's style and make your first dive into the Fish Tank an even more unsettling experience. The short films, Wasp, Dog and Milk, are each rooted in a very grim reality, and yet they are also filled with a shocking sort of poetry. Both Dog and Wasp have moments as dark as any horror film, made even darker through the images erupting out of such a well observed reality. They will begin to prepare you for the kinds of imagery that Andrea Arnold can pull out of the most mundane realities. For me the extraordinarily dark poetry of the near drowning scene is an artistic image of the highest order. After seeing what she did to the dog and the baby in the shorts I truly feared for the child's life at that moment. Andrea Arnold is simply fearless in building up a real situation into a true nightmare. I'll be waiting for her next film.",1305504000,3,1114,4.412621359223301
4084531,5,B0038BZ9JU,"I'm still recovering after watching this movie last night. What stays with me is the imagery of urban poverty, decay and disappointment set against a persistent, seemingly unsullied natural world that intrudes at every opportunity:  birds and trees and sky, fields and rain, bodies of water and, coupled with this, the main characters' intense sexuality: the well-spring of a hope as fragile as the life of this world.

4084532,4,B0038BZ9JU,"While I didn't respond quite as strongly to this as to Ms. Arnold's amazing first feature `Red Road',
this is still very strong film making. Unlike `Red Road', the subject has been covered before - a damaged,
angry neglected teenager, acting out against the world, getting in over her head sexually, behaving in ways that
even she would be hard pressed to explain. But if the general terrain is a familiar, the sense of rage and
power is one we rarely see given to a young female character, and - for the most part - there's a sense of raw
honesty and truth that eludes the vast majority of films about teens.

Mild spoilers ahead.

For every moment that the film flirts with clich (e.g. the good boyfriend/bad boyfriend choice - more subtle than
usual here, but still a little too neat), there are others that are original, complex and unique. I just wish the
ending didn't feel like a forced hopeful note, that a few of the symbols along the way (e.g. the White Horse)
weren't so on the nose, and that Katie Jarvis, marvelous most of the time in the lead, but a non-pro, had a
couple more colors and nuances in her performance. But none of those drawbacks, while substantive, keep

4084533,5,B0038BZ9JU,"Adolescence is a difficult time for most everybody, even people lucky enough to grow up in stable homes with loving parents. ""Fish Tank"" is an unflinching portrait of female adolescence, featuring a character stuck in a situation that is anything but favorable.

Mia is an angry 15 year old girl living in a housing project with her mother and little sister. Her mother is more interested in drinking and partying than she is in being a parent, and throughout the film it's clear that she just wants to get rid of Mia, who she is beginning to see as sexual competition. Mia seems to have no real friends in the neighborhood, and with her quick temper, is constantly scuffling with the other local kids. For the most part, she seems completely neglected and alone.

One day, a handsome, shirtless man named Connor appears in the kitchen in the morning; a ""friend"" of Mia's Mother. Mia is immediately attracted to Connor, although she also feels the need to antagonize him since he's invading her territory. Connor appears, for a while, to only have a playful, paternal interest in Mia. However, when he gets drunk one night and finds himself alone with Mia, his true lecherous intentions are revealed.

Mia's relationship with Connor reveals a sad truth ... that often troubled young girls are targeted by older men, who use their vulnerability as a way to exploit them sexually. Mia, an aspiring dancer, also finds herself in a similar situation when she thinks she wins a ""dancing"" audition that turns out to be nothing more than a casting call for strippers. And when Connor betrays Mia after their ill-advised sexual encounter, Mia goes off the deep end, with near disastrous consequences.

The film ends on an ambiguous note: Mia is neglected and damaged for sure, but she's also a scrappy survivor. Mia will survive and maybe even thrive ... despite the failure and irresponsibility of the ""adults"" in her life.

""Fish Tank"" is sort of a companion piece to another film I've seen, ""Towelhead"" that also explores issues of adolescent trauma, confusion, isolation, and sexual exploitation. However, in my opinion (sorry, Alan Ball, love ya!) ""Fish Tank"" is the superior film.",1302048000,2,2178,4.89159891598916
4084534,5,B0038BZ9JU,"Andrea Arnold's ""Fish Tank"" is as startlng as it is realistic. Winner of many BAFTA Awards in '09, we finally have it here in the US. Kids aren't much different there as here, inasmuch as they know everything and rebel against authority. The amazing Katie Jarvis has a sense of grit and independence, that belies her 15 young years. I understand this is her first film, and she succeeds brilliantly. Michael Fassbender is handsome as ever, providing a profound catalyst for the goings-on. I won't give away any plot points, but it's a story about a kid who wants to grow up before her time, who's had no real childhood, who makes some bad choices. It's bleak and often unpleasant, and the ending is left to the viewer's concept of all that's gone before. The DVD has some great extras, especially Ms Arnold's Oscar-winning short, ""Wasp"", which is about concerned parenting, as ""Fish Tank"" is about bad parenting. All involved should be commended, especially Andrea Arnold. BAFTA has a separate category for Best BRITISH film, for which this was the winner. A few years ago they also awarded ""This is England"", also about rebellious youth, but not nearly as compelling. Much is due to Ms Jarvis' magnificent portrayal. It's hard to say I enjoyed it, but I have great admiration for the talents involved. This is a very low-budget film, so don't expect widescreen; it's like a personal odyssey, with little flash, generous close-ups, and a very personal narrative, almost like a family video.

Dancing is Mia's only means of expression and way to escape from her ""family"". Mia's mother finds her a inconvenience and a disappointment and doesn't mind expressing it every chance she gets while her little sister has the mouth or a drunken sailor and hates her guts. For Mia, growing up is hard. Though things seem hopeless some rays of hope break though in her life.

As Conor slowly establishes himself has the new man of the house, you get the feeling that the he's not everything he seems to be and the stability that he brings into their life maybe just too good to be true.

  Fish Tank unravels slowly, but it does so in way that feels natural for the film. It's shot in a way that feels like you're watching a documentary or somehow in the room with the characters as events are unfolding. Fish Tank is beautiful in its simplicity and is a touching tale of a young woman who's every chance of happiness is taken from her.

4084536,5,B0038BZ9JU,"I know what you're thinking, because I was thinking it too: why oh why did they make another movie about a young white girl who wants to dance hip hop?  Believe me, this film is so much richer than that subtext would suggest.  In fact, the `dancing' theme is only a small part, a segue to deeper and more complex realizations that lie buried beneath the surface of this uniquely insightful film billowing at the surface with sharp texture and undeniable presence.

This movie is superb.

The film focuses on a young fifteen-year-old girl named Mia.  Mia lives with her promiscuous drunk of a mother and her filthy mouthed spoiled brat sister in a crummy apartment complex.  Her life is consumed with fisticuffs and confrontation, whether at home or not.  She is filled with dreams of being a dancer, but her insecurities hold her back; reducing her to holing away in an abandoned apartment in order to practice in privacy.  A sharp knife is thrust in her reality when her mother's new boyfriend, Connor, spends the night.  Enflamed with an obvious curiosity, Mia takes a strange liking to Connor, who shows her tender attention she lacks from everyone else around her.  As Connor makes his imprint on the family dynamic, you can see Mia's perspective shifting, but she is constantly derailed by her own emotional inhibitions and the stark jealousy of her mother, which bears down on Mia in waves of aggressive remarks and actions.

The film is an astute character study that sets down on the viewer and sinks into them, allowing the blood from the film's core to soak into us.  It's upon reflection that the film's themes grow deeper and the execution can be seen so vividly as authentic and enriching.  Each frame is a character all its own, creating lush moments within photographic sequences of trashy apartment's and grassy reeds.

And then there are the performances, which totally embody the film's objective and elevate every scene.  Katie Jarvis is such a find.  She looks like a weathered Emma Stone and she wisps in and out of each scene with a reckless sense of ease and comfort.  You can feel her itching in her own skin, yet it breathes a normalcy needed to sell her character.  Kierston Wareing slums it lustfully as Mia's self absorbed mother, careening each scene with a charismatic sense of loathing.  She hates everything her daughter represents and yet you never feel as though she truly hates her, even when she commands her to eff-off.

For me, the film is all about Michael Fassbender and his flawless portrayal of Connor.  Honestly, Connor is the most important character in the film because he serves as a true turning point for the characters in the film, mainly Mia.  Fassbender plays the role effortlessly, layering Connor with enough mystery to make the audience as cautious as they are trusting with him.  You never know what is true intentions are, and yet you feel as though you would give him the world, and visa-versa.  From the tinge of arrogance he exhibits upon his first meeting with Mia, allowing the knowledge of his night with her mother to slide from his shirtless back, to the tender stare he expresses while watching Mia dance; Fassbender is just enigmatic yet totally breathtaking.

The film's focus, that of Mia's emotional growth and striving towards freedom from her apparent imprisonment, is expertly crafted in this very moving drama.  The ending is rewarding in that it gives her an out that feels refreshingly appropriate, playing to her fantasies while slashing her down to reality with a glimmer of hope; hope that tomorrow, while not quite what she had initially hoped for, will be far better than today.",1300924800,,3658,4.822115384615385
4084537,5,B0038BZ9JU,"Fish Tank is a remarkable 2009 film that announces what could be promising careers for both writer/director Andrea Arnold and actress Katie Jarvis, whom Arnold discovered after witnessing Jarvis arguing with her boyfriend. This is not Arnold's first film, but it's the one that has thrust her into the spotlight after winning the Jury Prize at Cannes and the BAFTA for Best British Film. Due to the distribution deal between IFC Films and the Criterion Collection, the film has made its U.S. debut under the Criterion label and it richly deserves it. Following low-class characters, Fish Tank wisely diverges from the path Hollywood would take with this material and doesn't preoccupy itself with a happy ending. It introduces these characters, shows them as they are, and doesn't make excuses for their actions. It's unapologetic, but also sympathetic without being sappy.

Jarvis plays 15-year-old Mia, who resides on an Essex council estate (or public housing unit) with her party-girl mother Joanne (Kierston Wareing) and her younger sister Tyler (Rebecca Griffiths). Mia is a foul-mouthed, unrestrained girl with a bad attitude and it's no secret how she may have come to develop these personality traits. Joanne is a single woman with two children, but is personified proof of why having a kid doesn't make you a parent and her young age and appearance suggests that she may have had Mia around Mia's own age. Mia doesn't go to school, doesn't seem to have any friends, and her only outlet/escape seems to be drinking whatever alcoholic beverage she can acquire and, more importantly, her love of dancing which she practices in an empty flat alone. At home, her mother has brought in a new boyfriend named Connor (Michael Fassbender), a charming Irishman, whose presence and attitude seem to provide Mia and Tyler with the first hint of stability they may have ever seen. Mia is initially cold towards Connor, but you can feel the sizzling tension beneath the surface.

Fish Tank is a slow-build and may require patience from the viewer, although that's not to say it's a slow-moving film. Arnold establishes her characters as realistic and flawed people, then develops them as plausibly as cinema allows. She plays the story straight and avoids unnecessary, contrived theatrics but her film is not without style. I've seen some describe the camera-work as ""documentary-style"" and while it's true that a handheld camera is utilized frequently and the film follows Mia in close, tight shots; I don't think it's comparable to a documentary. What effect it does have is give the film a much more personal feel and place the viewer firmly in Mia's shoes. Cinematographer Robbie Ryan has an eye for capturing beautiful and atmospheric shots when the opportunity presents itself, but shoots much of the film in a familiar style...However, there are certain shots throughout the film in which the characters appear to be walking underwater; as if moving in a fish tank. Ryan is definitely hugely responsible for some of the film's impact.

The two leads Jarvis and Fassbender give stunning, powerful performances that were unjustly overlooked in the U.S. With the film being released when Jarvis was 18, it's safe to assume she filmed her role between the ages of 16-17. Here is a girl that has never acted before and whose real life may not differ much from the life of her Mia character, yet she gives an unusually strong, dynamic performance and shows remarkable talent and promise. It's a sympathetic and believable performance that is basically the heart of the film and she pulls it off with an ease that suggests a natural skill for acting. Jarvis will be an actress to watch for and her performance in Fish Tank has lead her to contracts with talent agencies and various film offers so we may be seeing more of her soon. Fassbender continues to impress as an actor that possesses immense talent and charm, as well as a significant capacity of depth. Connor is a character that many will view as morally reprehensible (among other things) and yet Fassbender makes him despicably likeable. The instant chemistry between Connor and Mia that slowly morphs into sexual tension doesn't seem like the invention of a writer, but feels like a true development between the characters. Of course it's clear where it's leading early on and yet one scene still seems shocking, although far from unexpected. There's not a bad performance here and all deserve mention, especially Griffiths (who had to be close to thirteen or so when the film was shot) as Mia's charming, foul-mouthed sister Tyler. Well, I found such a young character with such a vulgar, colorful vocabulary charming but you may disagree. It's worth nothing that you may find subtitles necessary to assist you in deciphering the thick, cockney accents in the film as they're quite heavy here.

Andrea Arnold is a writer/director I look forward to seeing more of, as she's made a film that switches gears between poignant, hopeful, heartbreaking, and (in one sequence) nail-bitingly intense with ease. The way her story flows so freely is the sign that she's a gifted screenwriter and her directing has enhanced the dramatic power of the film from what was on the page. It's not afraid to be poetic and symbolic, but Arnold keeps a firm grasp on reality throughout. Even the sex scenes are impressively directed, as they show only what is necessary and feel more personal and realistic. Her story takes some interesting turns, but there are no good or bad characters in Fish Tank. Arnold's characters are just people, good and bad in equal measure and Arnold never takes a side or voices an opinion. She just wants us to watch them as they are, like fish in a tank and it's a marvelously effective way to tell the story. This is a film that toyed with my emotions and had a deeply affecting emotional impact upon me. This is not a happy film, but it is a great one that moves with a beautiful sense of grace and pathos emphasized by Arnold's elegant direction and Jarvis' mesmerizing performance. Fish Tank is well-acted, well-written, well-paced, well-made, and makes a very large impact for such a small film. I close my review with the best, most easily understandable summary of my thoughts I am capable of providing; I loved it.

4084538,4,B0038BZ9JU,"The hard, gritty life of fifteen-year old wanna-be hip hop dancer Mia (newcomer Kate Jarvis) is tested to the limit when her mom moves a new boyfriend into their apartment.  This terrific film won the Cannes Jury Prize and is perhaps the best recent example of British social realism, a genre that persists from the 50s. Writer director Andrea Arnold has forged a nearly flawless character-driven film that is not quickly forgotten, especially young Jarvis.",1299715200,,457,5.093333333333334
4084539,5,B0038BZ9JU,"This film is a rare gem that follows none of the conventional movie tropes.  The characters are 3-dimensional; dialog rings true; the story progresses without artifice or resolution or plot holes; and nobody looks or acts like a movie star.  [perfect neon white teeth are thankfully absent, which I always find terribly distracting.  If there were a nuclear war today, all that would survive would be roaches, and movie star teeth.]  The acting is beautifully understated, and there are no histrionics.  For example, the relationship between the eldest daughter and the mother is elucidated with small, realistic actions and words.  And because of the authenticity of the film, I could give myself over to the film maker and get emotionally involved in the characters.

In most movies, everything is cranked up to the maximum and shoehorned into a contrived plot that strictly follows conventions so as not to upset the audience.  Music, emotions, conflicts, events...everything is calculated to manipulate the viewer and bash them over the heard.  Stories follow predictable lines with easily identifiable character archetypes.  They are written to please audiences.  Infact many releases go through a process of test screening to determine which ending is the best one at pleasing audiences, for example the travesty that was I Am Legend.  And, of course, frames are populated only by capital 'a' Actors.  And as a result, they have all the metaphorical nutrition and satiety of a bag of Doritoes.  Of course I like me a bag of cool ranch every now and again, but they don't satisfy like real food.

Fish Tank also avoids what I call the James Joyce syndrome, wherein a work is buried in a mass of symbolism and metaphor, and you have to have a pHd in codebreaking to understand what is being communicated.  I am not saying that those types of works are worthless etc, or that it is not worthwhile in watching and thinking about films Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain.  But, for me, I cannot get emotionally involved with the characters or engrossed in the story when it is heavily abstracted and symbolic.  Moreover, I don't have the educational background in literature and film to be able to do that kind of analysis.

Imo, this is one of the best character driven movies I've seen.  I really cannot find fault with anything the director/writer has done in Fish Tank.

As far as the criterion edition goes, it is fantastic.  The movie was shot on 35mm film and the blu ray transfer retains much of that wonderful film look. The video portion is an h264/AVC stream that averages 37 Mbps, and so suffers from no visible compression artifacting or degradation.  The audio is 5.1 dts-hd.  The majority of the audio is dialog or music that is being played on a portable player etc within the story, so most of the audio is in the centre channel.  This also lends to the realism as there are no unnatural 5.1 audio effects.  All in all a wonderful job by the Criterion people.",1299542400,22,2974,4.82806324110672

What is this, 1985?  I would never have even considered ordering this if someone (like me) had bothered to mention this MAJOR detail regarding the presentation.

It would be like ordering a Compact Disc of some highly regarded musical group and discovering it is recorded in MONO!

I don't care how good or poignant or well acted or whatever glowing review a film gets, FULL SCREEN is UNACCEPTABLE.",1298505600,3,563,5.076086956521739
4084542,4,B0038BZ9JU,"i agree with all reviewers that loved this movie. It is great and complex, with various levels of meanings and addressing several (not entirely comfortable) issues. Her director is a talent to watch. Wasp, her previous short included in the DVD is as good as the movie itself, and in widescreen, unlike the movie. Which brings me to the issue that really made me drop a star. I don't know how it was released theatrically, because I didn't see it, but I don't think it could have been in the old Academy aspect ratio (4:3) as it's been transferred to the DVD, despite the wrong listing on Amazon UK (widescreen anamorphic). It says on the DVD, 4:3 is the ratio aproved by the director, but to my mind it doesn't serve the movie well. The picture is in many occasions just too constrained and limited, with essential visual information at times lef out. I don't understand this choice. I loved watching this film, but I felt I was missing part of the picture.",1275955200,2,958,4.543352601156069
