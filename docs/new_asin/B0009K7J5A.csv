2296314,4,B0009K7J5A,"Gianni Schicchi and the Dark Knight are at first sight an unlikely couple but the booklet explains why they have been linked. Schicchi is now a very popular black comedy but the knight's tale is really grim. The music however is pure Rachmaninov and well worth repeat listening. Both operas are very well staged and the Opus Arte presentation is excellent apart from the cover art. One would hardly know the Miserly Knight was included! This is silly as what appears to be a one opera disc is so much more attractive when one discovers it combines the previous two DVD release in a superb blu ray disc. Get it! A wonderful Christmas disc to match the joy of Schicchi, with the Knight more in tune with current economic times!",1226102400,5,725,4.584615384615384
2296315,5,B0009K7J5A,"This is a truly brilliant production of Puccini's comic masterpiece. Although this one-acter, the third in Puccini's ""Il Trittico"" (trilogy) of one-act operas dealing with the subject of death, is less than an hour long, it packs a more than satisfying punch in the way of great music, well-drawn characters, and entertaining plot.

Annabel Arden has done a marvelous job in drawing out the dark side of  humanity in the story, which keeps this production from veering into caricature and slapstick; yet humor is still here in abundance. Vladimir Jurowski leads the London Philharmonic in a brilliant, well-paced reading of Puccini's motif-packed score.

In the title role, Alessandro Corbelli once more shows us why he is considered one of today's most sought-after singing artists. His expressive face, a marvel of muscular mobility, mirrors every fleeting thought and emotion his character is experiencing, and his every gesture is real and telling; yet one never feels that any of this is manipulated or contrived, but is simply a natural outcome of Corbelli's total identification with his character. He uses his considerable abundance of vocal resources intelligently, always in service of the music and dramatic situation, and never for the sake of pure ""vocalism"". Corbelli is a Schicchi for the ages.

The supporting cast are all top drawer. One could not ask for a better Zita than Felicity Palmer; Sally Matthews and Massimo Giordano (not to be confused with another tenor, Marcello Giordani!) are touching and ardent-voiced as the young lovers.

Included on the disc is an interesting interview with conductor, director, and Corbelli.

This DVD is an excellent introduction for those who are thinking of taking the plunge into the glorious and complex artform that is opera. For those of us already in the deep end, it is an absolute must-have.",1211500800,3,1856,5.190635451505017
2296316,5,B0009K7J5A,"I can't think of a worse concept than moving an opera that turns on a point of Medieval law to the early 20th century.  Nevertheless, this production is so well sung and acted that the legal absurdity is completely forgotten.

2296317,5,B0009K7J5A,"""Gianni Schicchi"" is an opera perhaps best known for one or two arias taken out of context, but recent productions, like this one here from Glyndebourne or the more recent one at the Met, have made it clear that the opera itself is nothing less than a comic masterpiece. A sort of operatic version of Ben Jonson's gimlet-eyed ""Volpone,"" it presents various forces of greed in conflict with one another in pursuit of a dead man's legacy. Older ""blocking"" characters, too, have to be outwitted here so young lovers, as classic comedy requires, may finally be united.
It's hard to imagine a better ensemble, conductor, or production than the forces at Glyndebourne have brought together. ""Gianni Schicchi"" deserves to be more frequently staged, joining its older brother, the long neglected Donizetti work ""Don Pasquale,"" in being more widely recognized as the work of musical and comic genius it is.",1182643200,4,897,5.026845637583893

2296319,5,B0009K7J5A,"I suppose you shoppers for ""the next opera to add to my collection"" noticed all the five star ratings for this production?  I add another five stars. It is one of those operas that gets played again and again. The one you would select to play for your guests who heretofore have avoided opera, always saying the cliche, "" I like all kinds of music , except opera and _ _ _ "" This mind set is from the fifties, when all there seemed to be were audio vinyl albums ( back when records were indeed albums of 4 records or more ). ""Get with it, people; we have a new invention called television, with subtitles""...actually big improvements over old television sets now,  both in clarity of picture and magnificent sound.

This is precisely what is drawing unprecedented attention to opera - which can be/shoud be one of the most sensually stimulating experiences one can have outside of the bedroom.

Puccini here deals with one of the most compelling studies in flawed human behaviour  in man's history...the business of gut wrenching envy and lust and skulduggerous, years -long- scheming over who gets what in the inheritance. I personally have seen horrible examples of it in my own family more than once! I bet you have too. We can all act like goody two shoes in church on Sunday, til it comes to the inheritance, then we turn sinister !

Whole families no longer speak to each other decades after the reading of the will. For this reason I personally wish everyone was required to see this mirror of human failing, and in so doing stand some chinaman's chance of saving ourselves from ruin. The astounding thing is how it is accomplished with such soaring, triumphant music , tension building recitative, and guffawing, jaw dropping humor.  A beyond superlative cast and directing was/is a great help. My hat is off to the director who so subtly choreographed the action for the entire performance without there ever being glimpsed the slightest overacting. Wonderful set, and wonderful singing. I am certain none of you will ever forget, nor will ever stop comparing Sally Mathews'portrayal of the adorable Lauretta - nor will her hauntingly beautiful ""O mio bambino caro"" ever leave your mind. Wow! Sung with such spine tingling beauty and great passion, without a trace of ""overdone'. Magnificent!

The cast is so very superb. I wish I could go on about each one; albeit, I single out Allesandro Corbelli for now, who carried the title role in a way that NO one will ever be able to match it! Allesandro's performance has caused me to seek him out wherever I can find him in other operas. He appears in Rossini's ""La Scala di Seta"", the Silk Ladder , as a mere blue collar worker in the opulent mason of the romantic triangle sitcom...yet, honestly, without Allesandro, the entire show would have collapsed of its own schmaltziness. He saved that production...yet barely gets the applause at the end.

This little one act Buffo might seem a trifle and not one to take seriously as an addition to your collection; yet I assure you that you will make a serious mistake  NOT to have this one. Moreover, I would wager that you would not part with it either! This is a real treasure.

Glyndbourne, whose casting has not always been stellar, nor directing for that matter.... would do well to reassemble this design and direction team/orchestra, set designer,cast,  etc. This one rings the bell.",1161648000,31,3393,4.741935483870968
2296320,5,B0009K7J5A,"I could not agree more with the previous reviewers.  The production, singing, and acting are magnificent and the sound is equal to super-audio!",1122854400,14,143,5.217391304347826
2296321,5,B0009K7J5A,"This Glyndebourne production of 'Gianni Schicchi' is a success of the highest kind. Sets, costumes, especially the almost choreographed stage action, the marvelous playing of the London Philharmonic under Vladimir Jurowski (a conductor I am growing to admire more and more) and particularly the marvelous singing actors portraying all ten major characters in this Falstaff-inspired ensemble opera are all simply wonderful. The big numbers - Rinuccio's 'Firenze &egrave; come un albero fiorito' sung by tenor Massimo Giordano and Lauretta's 'O mio babbino caro' sung by soprano Sally Matthews - are woven into the fabric of the action rather than being staged as numbers per se. And they are sung beautifully. But most important is the fabulous ensemble work that includes such Glyndebourne stalwarts as Felicity Palmer and Marie McLaughlin as Zita and La Ciesca, and the other singers are just as good.

This production was given just a year ago - in July 2004 - and was part of an oddly appropriate double bill. The other opera, Rachmaninov's 'The Miserly Knight' (sometimes called 'The Covetous Knight') was not only composed in roughly the same time period (early 20th century) but has greed as a common theme. I will be reviewing the just-released DVD of that release a shortly. But if it's anything like this production it will be a winner.

This is easily the best overall production of 'Gianni Schicchi' I've ever seen and I recommend it enthusiastically.

TT=74 minutes; includes extras: interviews with stage director Annabel Arden, conductor Jurowski, baritone Alessandro Corbelli (the wonderful Schicchi); a narrated and illustrated synopsis; a gallery of pictures of the cast. Sound: Stereo or DTS surround sound (and the sound is quite good). Subtitles in English, German, French, Spanish and Italian.

2296322,5,B0009K7J5A,"Gianni Schicchi is the third and final part of Il trittico, Puccini's trilogy of one-act operas. It is a masterpiece of Italian comedy.

The performance on the new DVD is sheer delight from every point of view. It was filmed live at the Glyndebourne Opera House in 2004. The director Annabel Arden adapted the plot from the Middle Ages to somewhere in the 19th centaury. Sets and costumed are beautiful, and Arden is doing an inspired job, full of surprises.

Vladimir Jurowski conducts the London Philharmonic Orchestra with excellent results. Puccini brilliant orchestration is heard with great transparency due to the excellence of the recorded sound (True Surround Sound).

The singers are all excellent. The extremely funny Alessandro Corbelli takes the title role; Massimo Giordano and Sally Matthews are the young lovers with fresh voices. Felicity Palmer, Marie McLaughlin and Luigi Roni are some of the relatives.

Opus Arte should get a very high mark for the technical quality and presentation. Picture is crystal clear and the sound is warm and brilliant. Highly recommended!!",1119398400,33,1088,5.235632183908046
2296353,5,B0009K7J5A,"When the Blu-Ray arrived, I put it in my player (a Samsung) and about 5 minutes into the performance, the audio suddenly went out, and the picture started skipping.  Thinking it was a defective disk, I returned it and ordered a replacement.  When the replacement arrived it did the same thing!  My player has had no difficulties with any other disks.  Kudos to Amazon for their speedy and painless processing of returns.  Has anybody else had any problem with the blu-ray?

UPDATE
======
Turns out that the problem was not with the disk - it with my Blu-Ray player! This was the only disk that my player would choke on, so I naturally enough had assumed that the problem was with the disk rather than with the player.  But when I took it to a friend's house, it played flawlessly on their Blu-Ray player.  So I exchanged my 2-year old Samsung player for a new Sony, which handled the Schicchi disk with no probems.

Now that I've been able to watch it, I have to echo the many positive reviews that have been posted here.  If you know somebody who thinks that they ""don't like opera"", be sure to get this disk in front of them.  Unlike most operas, this one is short enough to take in at a single sitting (the 162 minute run time that Amazon lists is for TWO operas that are packaged on this disk - Schicchi & the Miserley Knight).  Schicchi is a one-act, tightly scripted comedy that's only about an hour long.  And it's very funny.  (One of the characters even resembles Sacha Baron Cohen's character in the Sweeney Todd movie).  And the singing is wonderful.",1386806400,,1561,4.48581560283688
2296354,5,B0009K7J5A,"It's clear that Puccini had a thing about Dante - evidenced in this one act opera based on a character in the Inferno (Canto XXX, 32 & 42-45). Also note the bust of the 'somma poeta' in the background of the set. Tosca also has subtle Dante reflections (Acts 1 & 3 end with the word 'dio', and the pantomime at end of Act 2 are about God and Tosca's sin - does this mimic Dante's ending each Cantiche with the word 'stelle'?).
To this version - well it's really excellent with Alessandro Corbelli in the lead role using all his facial and body gestures to enliven the principal character. Sally Matthews as the daughter and Massimo Giordano as the young lover from the wealthy side of the tracks both great performances.  There are no poor performances from any of the players and the bonus interviews are well worth watching. As the director points out in her interview, it's really quite a dark story that Puccini has focused on as a theatre piece - and very successfully.
So Puccini takes a character who in the Commedia is quite frightful (""..in his rabid rage he mauls the others.."") and works on a storyline that gives a more gentle reason for Schicchi's ruse.
Corbelli finishes by turning to the audience and saying in character:
(TAKING HIS LEAVE, WITHOUT SINGING)
  Ditemi voi, signori,
  se i quattrini di Buoso
  potevan finir meglio di cos?
  Per questa bizzarria
  m'han cacciato all'inferno... e cos sia;
  ma con licenza del gran padre Dante,
  se stasera v siete divertiti,
  concedetemi voi...
(makes a gesture of applause)
  l'attenuante!
He bows gracefully to the audience.
""So tell me folks if Buoso's wealth could not finish better? And for this oddity they sent me to hell - and so be it; but with the permission of great father Dante, if tonight you have enjoyed yourselves; concede me 'extenuating circumstances'!""
It's also interesting that when the Notary starts drawing up the will .. he announces the date as being in the year 1299! Another Dante/Commedia connection.",1381708800,,1995,4.747093023255814

2296357,5,B0009K7J5A,"This short opera by Puccini was originally intended to be performed as the final part of a trilogy known as Il Tritico. The first of the three, called The Cloak, concerns a murder and is set on a barge and is both powerful and reasonably frequently performed. The middle opera is set in a convent and is the least popular. For these reasons it is not unusual for the trilogy to be split up and for the outer two operas to be differently paired for an evening's production. That is what happened here at Glyndebourne when Gianni Schicchi was coupled with Rachmaninov's fine, but rarely performed, Miserly Knight.

Both operas have greed as the linking theme. In the case of Gianni, greed manifests itself in the machinations surrounding the will of a recently deceased elderly man and his grasping relatives. In the case of the Miserly Knight, greed manifests itself in the miser's relationship with his hoard of gold and the repercussions upon himself and his impoverished son. Both operas are full of marvellous music, the Puccini being an example of comedy and the Rachmaninov an example of tragedy.

Gianni Schicchi is produced in a totally traditional setting of fastidious historical accuracy and complexity. The drama is provided by the interactions between the characters and the situation rather than through changes of scene as there is just one scene throughout. The cast are perfectly matched and are all outstanding in both their singing abilities and their acting abilities. This priceless combination makes this by far the most effective and enjoyable production that I have ever seen of this opera.

One must mention a few particularly outstanding roles however. Alessandro Corbelli in the title role matchlessly demonstrates his wonderful sense of comic timing throughout. In this he is matched by Felicity Palmer as the grasping socialite, Zita. Her nephew, passionately wishing to marry Schicchi's daughter and equally believing in Schicchi's abilities to solve the problem of the disinheritance, is sung with equal passion by Massimo Giordano. He is well matched by the sincere simplicity of Sally Matthews as Schicchi's daughter who gains special applause for her touching rendition of `O mio babbino caro'.

This is a dream team and a dream production. The camera work is beyond reproach as is the sound, presented in PCM 5.1 and stereo. This is clearly a 5 star issue and was loved by the Glyndebourne audience.

The Miserly Knight was composed by Rachmaninov in 1904 when he was only 30. The original tale was written by Pushkin as one of an intended series of poems depicting the 7 deadly sins. In the event only 4 were completed and none of them were intended for performance. For this rarely-performed work Rachmaninov set the story almost word for word from the original and thus dispensed with a librettist. It is told in three scenes with 5 principals and no chorus.

To quote the sleeve notes: `The narrative is so bald, it can be compressed into two sentences. The Baron keeps his son Albert in penury, compelling him to rely on moneylenders for finance and finally to throw himself on the mercy of the local feudal duke. When the duke confronts the Baron with his miserly greed, the Baron slanders Albert, is challenged to a duel, and in a state of shock, collapses and dies'.

There is a central 20 minute monologue where the Baron broods on his accumulated wealth during which nothing dramatic happens. This situation seems unpromising but omits the extraordinarily effective and vital role of Rachmaninov's orchestration. Those who are familiar with his `Isle of the Dead' symphonic work will be aware of his considerable abilities in painting such atmospheric scenes by way of orchestral colouring. This grim tale therefore fits the composer's psyche and musical imagination and skills perfectly and the result is a compressed tale of gripping dramatic effect.

The Glyndebourne setting of this tale is fittingly dark and forbidding, lacking in any civilising softness. Jurowski is able to conjure up powerfully dark textures and sounds from the fine London Philharmonic which is on top form. The roles of the Baron (Sergei Leiferkus), his son Albert (Richard Berkeley-Steele), Albert's servant (Maxim Mikhailov), the moneylender (Viacheslav Voynarovskiy) and the Duke (AlbertSchagidullin) are all sung and acted superlatively additionally benefitting from several authentic Eastern European vocal textures.

In summary therefore, this claustrophobic tale is given a reading that for many, including myself, would be considered near definitive. The camera work of Opus Arte is ideal as is the sound, presented in PCM 5.1 and stereo. This was enthusiastically received by the Glyndebourne audience even though, for many, it would have been a very dark d&eacute;but experience.

This is an outstanding release therefore and clearly of outstanding quality in every way. It should give great pleasure to purchasers on all counts while probably being an invaluable extension of their knowledge and understanding of Rachmaninov's musical world as well as being of enormously rewarding to lovers of the Puccini.",1343520000,,5140,5.1670673076923075
2296358,5,B0009K7J5A,"This production of Gianni Schicchi (Blu-ray) is outstanding music, voices, staging, costumes, acting and everything else. What a delight to watch. Not as fond of the second production, but Gianni Schicchi makes the DVD fabulous entertainment.",1326326400,,242,5.75
2296359,5,B0009K7J5A,"Yes dear Friends... there is a real treasure hidden within this Blu Ray disc. Not Gianni Schicchi.. That was good, ... However, I am referring to the 'other' opera within this disc, one that has been given such a step-motherly treatment by the producers of this BD, that it would make Cinderella's stepmother look inadequate in terms of ill-treatment.

I did not know this was included when I ordered for Gianni Schicci. Just look at the Amazon page and the cover of the BD. The fact of the Rachmaninoff 'Miserly Knight' being included in this BD is written in such a small print that it could be mistaken for the 'small-print' in a dubious insurance policy document. I did not notice it. At that time, there was no other review either on the page, pointing this out. I think they treated this inclusion like the Miserly Knight wanting to guard his treasure from others even after his death....

For those who enjoy Operas of Wagner, Debussy, Janacek and their ilk, the Miserly Knight, although it lasts for just around 70 minutes, is a thoroughly enjoyable fare. In fact, it is just wonderful. The singers, the directors and of course Jurowsky have made it into a fabulous production. The Music that Rachmaninoff composed for this is just out of this world...even out of his world... There are no great arias (in fact none), no hum-able tunes that pop out or for that matter, no 'action' either. The work seduces you in its entirety just by the dominance of the Orchestral portion with all the treatment Rachmaninoff is famous for. The singers have difficult parts that blend so well with the drama and the music, and is an 'All-Male' affair...

I would suggest you buy this disc for the Rachmaninoff rather than Schicchi, which you may already possess in another production.

Not that the Schicci is in any way performed inadequately. In fact, it is one of the best Schicchi's that I have seen, with Allessandro Corbelli in the title role along with absolutely all the others doing a fabulous job of it.

This disc was worth every penny I paid, and I do hope one is as pleasantly surprised by the Rachmaninoff as I have been.

2296360,5,B0009K7J5A,"Just like the director said on the bonus feature, this well known 'comedy' is also contain with 'dark' feelings. So, if you just laugh through this production and nothing left afterwards, you probably missed some important point from this production, or, they trying to express under the surface. Make sure you watch the interviews on the bonus part to understand what am I talking about.

For the credit, the Orchestra is 'London Philharmonic Orchestra' which is less well-know as London Symphony Orchestra. But, they have done a brilliant work, no less than the bigger names.

You will probably hear 'Stravinsky' at the very end and other 20th century music elements here and there. And I did feel the production is shorter than usually opera. Perhaps, at the merging of 'Cinema' period, Puccini had to adjust the old fashion in past. Puccini's music is probably most 'romantic' compare to his forerunners in Italy, I feel that. 'O mio babbino caro' -- did this bring you tears, the libretto, the passion of love?

Highly recommend for opera beginners (like me).
