8636799,5,B00HW2PS5G,"Let's Go on an Adventure! features 5 educational episodes in the Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That series. In this newest release, we join the Cat, Nick and Sally on their outdoor excursions where they learn about the world around them. Children will learn how to use a map when they observe the characters pretending to be pirates searching for treasure. In another episode, they discover the various ways that trees send out their seeds to create new plants. Kids will also learn how salmon swim up stream to lay their eggs, and they will discover how skunks and snails protect themselves. My boys, whose ages range from 2 to 7, all enjoyed this DVD because of the Cat's crazy antics and the fun facts presented to them in each of the episodes. The DVD has a running time of approximately 60 minutes. However, my boys have already watched it in it's entirety twice this week, so you can count on getting many hours of enjoyment out of this release! The stories included on this DVD are Maps!, Incredible Journey, I See Seeds, Sniff and Seek & Go Snails Go!

My 5 year old son just adores the Cat in the Hat Knows A  lot About That. So to no surprise, this DVD was an instant hit in our house! He loves learning all about the animal kingdom, and the snails episode definitely was his favorite. I love that there's 5 short episodes for geared for his attention span. Filled with bright colors and songs, he's ready to go go go go on an adventure!",1405900800,,468,4.131868131868132
8636801,5,B00HW2PS5G,"In each episode, The Cat always takes Sally and Nick on a discovery adventure. Their adventures consist of learning facts about animals, plants, and their environment. Just before Sally and Nick tag along with The Cat, The Cat will say that they should ask their moms first. My daughter once said They don't need to ask their mom because she will always say yes. Then I told her, that they still need to let her know where they are going.

I love the cats dialogue since it rhymes like Dr. Seuss books and he has a cool ride that provides them whatever they need. My daughters enjoy watching The Cat and The Hat. They would sing along to its theme song and laugh at the silliness of Thing 1 & 2 like when they were trying to climb up the water fall. I also enjoyed watching the DVD with the kids and we cant wait for the next DVD release.

My 8 yr old has always been a big fan of Cat in the Hat, she has watched him for as long as I can remember she knows all the words to the song and loves seeing where Nick & Sally go next. She is a nature lover and loves learning new things so she loves Cat!!

My 1 yr old was excited as soon as the DVD came he loved the picture on the box, he wasn't sure what it was but he was drawn to it.",1405382400,,1237,3.9757085020242915

This past weekend my husband got to experience ""The Cat in the Hat"" for the first time.  I was surprised when he asked who the Cat was after seeing it packed in Savannah's bag for our car ride to visit family over the holiday weekend.  Then, I realized he was being serious and had no idea who this classic Dr. Seuss character was.  We had to fix that...and, that we did, by having him watch this new DVD from NCircle Entertainment, which released on July 1st, when we arrived at my parents' home.

My husband is from El Salvador and said that they never aired Cat in the Hat shows on television when he was a child, nor did he read the many books by the same title.  He had seen books I had picked up, as well as other ""Cat in the Hat"" DVDs around the house, but he never thought to sit down and enjoy them with the girls, until now!

After the catchy theme song and the first few minutes of the first episode, my husband was hooked.  He recognized Martin Short, who lends his voice to the Cat, and loved his crazy demeanor.  You had to do a double take when looking at my husband with the girls, as it looked like three kids watching the DVD...they were all getting into it, and loved every second of it!

Recently, we introduced geocaching to the girls, and have spent a few weekend afternoons taking the girls to local parks to find hidden treasures using a geocaching app we downloaded as well as maps for certain hunts.  They get a kick out of hunting for hidden treasures, so the episode about the pirates and using a treasure map to find the secret treasure was a favorite among my two girls.  They couldn't wait until our new geocaching trip, so that they could practice more with reading and using a treasure map. :-)

Even though the episodes that make up this new DVD release have already aired on television, fans of this hit animated series, which airs daily on PBS Kids, will still love watching them over and over again.  We have only owned the DVD since last Thursday, but have already watched it a handful of times, including this AM. :-)

If you have a ""Cat in the Hat"" fan in your house, or are looking to add to your family's growing collection of educational DVDs to watch on rainy days or days when it is too hot to be outside, this new release is one to pick up.  Each episode is action packed and filled with fun adventures that only the Cat can provide.  Kids will go crazy pretending to be pirates, learning about snails and their shells, and so much more.  So, don't delay in picking up a copy of this DVD and sharing it with your child(ren).  My girls...and, husband...can't get enough of it! :-)",1404950400,,2762,4.324271844660194
