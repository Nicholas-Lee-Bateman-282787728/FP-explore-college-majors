8401597,5,B003ODIUVQ,"This video is part of my 9th grade high school unit on China.  While my students are a bit older than Rebeka, they can easily identify with her efforts to fit in with her peers in the process of adjusting to a new school environment - all the more dramatically so in the context of a very different culture.  While the events in the video happened a decade ago, the themes and visual content of the video are current.  Schools look much the same; the cross cultural human warmth and ever present possibility of a government crack down remain.  I highly recommend this video for students grade 9 and younger - this gem provides a great way to put a human (though realistic) face on modern China.",1305676800,,694,4.440944881889764
8401598,5,B003ODIUVQ,Rebeka  Goes To China is a remarkable film.  Young Rebeka quickly integrates herself into another culture - as only a child can - and her experience and insight is revelatory.,1289865600,,175,4.8
