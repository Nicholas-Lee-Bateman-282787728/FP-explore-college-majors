8379498,3,B002SQJFVE,"We've been purchasing the entire Fantastic Movie Trailers disc library following up the 42nd Street Forever discs, and have really gone crazy with our interested because one of our upcoming podcast episodes will feature a discussion of classic trailers.

While disc 3 isn't as good as the first two, it's still a lot of fun, even though I've never heard of most of the films and some of them are in other languages with no subtitles. Another thing I don't care about these discs is that they have no chapter listing and no listing of the trailers - you have to watch the whole disc and can't pick and choose the trailers you want to see.

And because no one has done it yet, here's the list of trailers included on this disc (best guess on some of them):

GMRX MPAA plug
An Italian horror film that we weren't sure of the title because there were no subtitles
Black Bunch
Return Of The Alien: The Deadly Spawn (aka Deadly Spawn)
Mutant (trailer in German)
Psycho-Circus

The Sinister Urge
a French Zombie movie, title not clear
The Curse Of the Living Corpse
The Blob
Beware the Blob (aka Son Of Blob)
Invasion Of The Bee Girls
The Day Of The Triffids
another French horror film, ""Something of Death"" (we think)
Castle Of Blood

Drive In Masacre (their spelling, they forgot the second ""s"")
Girls Night Out
The Beach Girls And The Monster

INTERMISSION - two minutes of an 8  minute countdown

Like I said, a lot of these are nausea inducing if you have a weak stomach, and also some nightmare fodder, but isn't that the fun of it all? :-)

Can't wait to catch volume four!",1343260800,,2241,4.632241813602015
