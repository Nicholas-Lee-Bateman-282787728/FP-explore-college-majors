5020654,3,B006VJ1AAI,This movie is not a major Hollywood production! It's more like watching a weekly television serious! It reminds me of ABC's Once Upon a Time! Children will not relate to this film and adults may be amused! The Wizard of Oz (1939) is just one movie that can not be messed with!,1333238400,,276,4.326923076923077
5020655,1,B006VJ1AAI,"I saw the movie thinking it was a good twist on the Oz storyline. This was so bad on so many levels. This is not the worse movie I have ever seen but it is way down there on the list. I didn't even finish watching it, and I don't do that often. Don't waste your money or your time. Even if you can see it for free, don't.",1332633600,5,321,3.6666666666666665
5020656,1,B006VJ1AAI,"I had high hopes for this miniseries, After all, ""Tin Man"" is one of my favorite miniseries ever, and this one stars Billy Boyd, Sean Astin, Jeffrey Combs and Christopher Lloyd.

Sadly, ""The Witches of Oz"" is a massive misfire right from the beginning -- it tries to be both an epic, intense adventure story and a kid-friendly all-you-need-is-love fairy tale at the same time. Lloyd, Boyd and a handful of other actors do what little they can to salvage the story, but the hammy acting, bad CGI and slapworthy ending make it impossible.

Budding writer Dorothy Gale (Paulie Rojas) is stunned when prominent agent Billie Westbrook (Eliza Swenson) develops an interest in the Oz books she's been writing with her friend Allen (Ari Zagaris). Dorothy and Allen move to New York City, unaware that the Wicked Witch of the West and her head-swapping minion Princess Langwidere (Mia Sara) are plotting against her.

Specifically, they want a key to a magic book which Dorothy had when she returned from Oz many years ago. But Dorothy has forgotten about her time in Oz,  so she can't remember where she put the key. Along with Allen, her new buddy Bryan (Barry J. Ratcliffe) and love interest Nick (Boyd), she must find the key before the Witch has a chance to take over all worlds.

""The Witches of Oz"" is a schizophrenic mess of a story. It wants to be a big, dark save-the-world story, but it also wants to be a kiddie-friendly family film.  Even worse, it seems to have been made up as it went -- foreshadowing comes to naught (Nick's identity), important items go unmentioned until they're needed, and random characters pop out of the woodwork without warning.

It also feels like the budget was somebody allowance -- the costumes are silly (Glinda looks like a cut-rate Valkyrie) and the special effects are simply embarrassing. I will admit that there are some really moving moments, such as Jeffrey Combs as a grieving father whose child has been swept away to Oz.

But the rest of the movie is just so cheesy and campy, and riddled with gaping plot holes that you could fly a taxi through. It all climaxes in a truly horrendous battle through a magically-ravaged NYC, where the Evil Minions of the Evil Witch... lightly annoy the New York residents. Apparently flying monkeys, dragons and evil gnomes don't kill people -- they just sort of whack them with sticks.

Oh, and the ending? It completely negates everything that has gone on before it, by revealing that everything both the heroes and villains did was TOTALLY POINTLESS. And its ""all you need is love/friendship"" message is completely negated by what happens at the climax.

Some of the actors are really, really good. Boyd is charming, low-key and resolutely normal, Combs is heartbreakingly good, Astin and Ethan Embry are fun, and Christopher Walken is slyly clever in his brief role. Sadly, Rojas seems to be stuck in ""wide-eyed ingenue"" mode, and that's how she plays every emotion that Dorothy is supposed to experience.

And the actors playing the villains are just awful, especially since they're all played for bad comic relief. None of them are even slightly scary! Swenson is particularly tragic -- she gives a very good performance when she looks human, but transforms into a hissing growling parody of Margaret Hamilton buried under bad green makeup as the Witch. She's less frightening than the Kardashians.

""The Witches of Oz"" tries to be too many things, and ends up as nothing -- a whimsically candy-sweet mess that makes absolutely no sense by the end. Just watch ""Tin Man.""",1330041600,58,3555,4.819376026272578
5020657,5,B006VJ1AAI,"This movie is like Marvel's ""Avengers"", but for Wizard of OZ. It's split into two parts, first a journey of discovery, then the war. Christopher Loyd plays the Wizard. If you were a fan of Frank L. Baum's series as a kid, you'll get more refferences than the casual viewer. This is deffinately for OZ fans everywhere!!!!",1469750400,,320,4.631578947368421

5020660,1,B006VJ1AAI,"This film is almost an exercise in how to make a bad movie, but this isn't the kind of bad movie that's enjoyable.  Needlessly time-consuming, it borrows from every cliche in popular fantasy (particularly the ""something we know as a story is actually another universe"").  While there's some knowledge of the extensive Baum works at play, it's such an unbelievably disjointed movie.  Rarely have I seen a film where literally everything was so bad.  The editing, for one, would be bothersome to even audiences who don't really notice that sort of thing so much.  We are constantly reminded of the plot, but these reminders change things in a convoluted way so that there's no sense of continuity.  The ""surprise revelations"" are either so obvious that it's understandable to become impatient and angry with the film's persistent ignorance that the viewer is still in the dark regarding so many obvious attempts foreshadowing that are in no way subtle.  It also makes the huge mistake of many post-LOTR fantasy films by trying to force in an epic fantasy battle...repeatedly.  There is little to no understanding of tone or scene transition ever established.  Money is spent on the strangest things: larger special effects that don't really contribute to any element of the story run rampant (establishing no sense of wonder) while tiny prop details, costuming, and practical effects are so uneven that it's hard to take them seriously as fantastical, realistic, or even important.

I think one of the film's cardinal sins is how is loses sight of its already ill-defined and amorphous intent.  You'll find a good deal of material stolen from the Tin Man mini-series, Tim Burton's awful version of Alice in Wonderland (don't ask; I don't know why), and when all is said and done--if you can make it to the end (though I don't blame you if you turn it off way before then)--you'll see that a huge portion of the film poorly steals from the wonderful 2007 film Stardust.  I don't know which is worse: ""re-envisioning"" The Wizard of Oz in such a cheap way or blatantly lifting so much from a great movie like Stardust (which the writer and director watched in a very poor way so as to forget that the 2007 film from which they so shameless steal from had logical plot structure).  I can't really overstate the great Stardust theft at work in this clunky film: the score, ""composed"" by one of the lead actresses/writers/director's bff is just the shameless changing of a few notes and key signatures from Stardust's breathtaking original music.  Speaking of the actors...

Don't be fooled because the film features Lance Henriksen, Christopher Lloyd, Sean Astin, Billy Boyd, Jeffrey Combs, and Mia Sara.  Literally all of their parts are poorly written, easily forgotten, and re-appear for convenience rather than being integral.  Boyd and Sara are the only actors of that pretty good list of actors who have notable degrees of screen time.  The focus is unfortunately placed on Paulie Reddings's absolutely atrocious Dorothy, a character whom I dare you to try and connect with, and Eliza Swenson's very odd (and not at all endearing) performance as Billy Westbrook (I won't ""spoil"" that surprise, but guess what Wizard of Oz character she is?).  Billy Boyd is shoe-horned in as a love-interest for Dorothy.  Sara is wasted as an nonthreatening antagonist drawn from the Baum books named Princess Langwidere.  While they actually do appropriately assign the character with the right name from the books, she essentially occupies the place of a substitute Wicked Witch of the East and is an obvious cash-in on the disturbing Mombi character from Return to Oz.  Though Langwidere is actually the name of the princess who steals heads, her inclusion is without a doubt a poor attempt to recapture the legitimate horror of the aforementioned headless princess plot from the effectively disturbing 1985 film.  There's very little homage to the 1939 film that isn't trite or forced.  The acting is just so terrible, almost as though there was a rule set to avoid believably appropriate reactions to situations.  The rendition of Glinda is godawful both visually and acted.
It's a digressive film to say the least, boiling over with so many flashbacks and dream sequences that the "" secret truth of the plot"" is consistently obscured.

I'm finding it hard to think of a movie that has so desperately--at times often aggressively towards its viewers--tries to force chemistry between actors like it does with Reddings and Swenson.  The film's sense of time is terrible for both the story content and the actual pacing, and one of the desperate attempts to trick viewers into believing that relationships have developed while avoiding showing any of this supposed development are small bits of dialog like ""Well, it's been four weeks.""  Out of these little ""reminders,"" the film with some degree of hostility quietly screams at its audience ""LOOK, THESE RELATIONSHIPS HAVE FLOURISHED!  TRUST ME!""  There's just so much incongruity that it begs the question how a film/series was ever green-lit. It's release has also been terribly confusing, being sold as both a movie and a mini-series (failing in both forms).  I think that last little insight is telling of the film as a whole: the creators want it to be everything and don't believe in making any creative decisions.",1462492800,,5356,4.991001124859393

The special effects were really good and a lot of money was obviously spent on making this movie. Too bad that they didn't spend more on getting better actors and editors to work on the lines to make the dialogue flow more smoothly. The story jumps around a lot and it presupposes that you have some knowledge of the story from either the original movie or have read the books. I was on vacation and recovering from Thanksgiving guests, plus I paid for the movie, so rather than turn it off one third of the way through it, I stuck with it. By the half way point, it was more interesting and made more sense. Two thirds of the way through, it all came together and had a lot more action and special effects and began to make sense. I don't feel that the actress (Paulie Rojas) was the right one for the role nor did I think that the dog that played Toto was believable as Toto.

5020695,5,B006VJ1AAI,"I am a rabid Wiz of Oz fan and have been so since I was tiny.  I have almost the entire library of the Oz books, both from Baum and
many other later authors (quality varies with authors).  This is an extremely well made movie (unexpected by me) and very enjoyable with standout visuals and special effects.  I thought this was better than that Disney tripe about the Wizard; this is a bit more faithful
to the original stories.  There are oddities in this film, especially with much of the action taking place in NY, not Oz.  They do, however revisit part of the original story, including the mashing of the evil Witch of the East by Dorothy's house; OUCH!  The nasty Witch
of the West wants revenge on Dorothy and also a key she has to unlock a book of magic which will give the evil green face monsterous powers.  The Wizard who is still around tricks her.  Dorothy is sent back to Kansas and the story goes on from there.
The regulars are there, though I thought the Tin man was ridiculous; he looked like something from TRANSFORMERS.  But the
action is good and Fun and Evil is trumped at the end.  If these paragraphs or sentences are out of line it is this crummy keybd
I am typing on.  Though there are a few weird things here, I give it 5 stars for production quality, cast, costumes and high
production values.  And no Dr Sweets or Martha.  Oh yes, there are the flying Monkeys too..very neat!! This too from Amazon.

5020705,1,B006VJ1AAI,"To begin with, I have read all the 14 original Oz books by L. Frank Baum.  I also have as many of the subsequent (30 or so) books written by other authors that are still available in print.  So it comes as no surprise that I'm an Oz purist.  The creator of this monstrosity is also familiar with the works, because some characters most people won't recognize make an appearance.

This doesn't begin to describe what I will graciously call ""acting.""  Or in this case, the lack thereof.  Some of the actors are so incredibly bad that I literally snorted and laughed out loud.  To call it ""emoting"" doesn't even come close to the eye-rollingly bad acting in this movie, which I have added to the top 5 all-time worst movies I have seen.

The ""special effects"" give new meaning to the word ""cheesy.""  The 1939 film classic was light-years ahead of this version of Oz.  The nylon stocking that gave us the cyclone in the original has been replaced with I don't know what, but what I DO know is that the buildings being destroyed looked better in the train set under my Christmas tree.

There are some obvious rip-offs.  The Tin Woodsman looks amazingly like C3PO in Star Wars, and if you remember that scene in Harry Potter where he is dueling with Voldemort and the energy stream connects their wands, well, you'll see it again here, only not done as well.

There was one saving grace: it also had one of the most memorable movie lines in history.  Upon learning his true identity from a previous life, the Scarecrow says ""I always knew I was different - I just thought I was gay.""

A scene of the flying monkey's attacking New York, that could have been the hilight of the movie, got ruined with a dragon flying around.  A dragon?  In OZ?  Oh and TOTO is a german shepard. Hello?

5020745,4,B006VJ1AAI,"Let me say, I had not read any of the books before seeing this.  I had only seen The wizard of Oz original and Return to Oz movies.

The best part for me was the character of Dorothy's friend/scarecrow.  I felt he captured the scarecrow of The Wizard Of OZ.  The wicked witch of the west was also a fairly well done character.  Dorothy could have been better. Her fake hair was soo annoying.. They did try to include way too much in the plot and ended up with a toss-up  of tid-bits of everything--This could be made into a television series, I think.  I wish it would be!

I had seen Return to Oz so I understood who Ozma was from the beginning (lady with interchangeable heads) and the Gnome King and Tic-Toc, but if you'd only seen Wizard of Oz, I can understand how you'd be confused from the beginning and in some parts.  They made the Wizard all good in this in contrast to being a fraud in the Wizard of Oz.

It actually started getting good when Uncle Henry told the story of who Dorothy really was--it was almost like 2 different people created the movie before and after when Henry began his story--before that it kind of drug(dragged?) lol. If you sit out till this part you won't be disappointed.

I don't agree with some other reviews that the soundtrack made the language inaudible.  I don't think it did this at all and wouldn't even comment on it if I hadn't read other reviews first.  The soundtrack may be the best part of the movie.

Glenda really captured the character I remember as well (in an older form).  The flying monkeys were a disappointed (special effects could have been better). But I really think today we expect too much and have forgotten how to use our imaginations, which is much of what the wizard of oz means to me; Just like the original Wizard of Oz didn't have today's special effects--not sure this correlation was intentional rather than low budget but it worked for me to connect the 2.

I don't know if the butterfly was part of the books but I liked how it came back at key moments to remind Dorothy who she was. I gave this 4 stars after watching the last half of it.  The first half I would rate 3stars but the ending made up for it. Overall entertaining and enjoyable.  Makes me want to read the books!",1343347200,2,2252,4.34688995215311
5020746,2,B006VJ1AAI,"My twelve year old daughter and I watched this one rainy afternoon. Yes, I agree with many reviews; it was a giant campy, cheese-fest. Often I couldn't understand the dialogue due to the blaring soundtrack  ""Muzak"", but it was watchable if you aren't expecting a primo multimillion dollar blockbuster. I would describe it as mixture  of ABC's Once Upon a Time and Disney Channels Wizards of Waverly Place. A little bit of dark drama with a bit of whimsy and a very  low budget.
 The story twists about how Dorothy ended up in present day were intriguing and I appreciated the effort to include characters from several of the Oz books. My daughter & I have our own theory as to the true identity of Nick Chopper. Which many viewers were led to believe that he was Dorothy's tin man but were confused when it seemed that he wasn't. We believe that Nick is Dorothy's tin man, but he still doesn't have a memory of it or how and why he is there, The tin man that fought the Gnome King was probably Captain Fyter, a second tin man introduced in a later book in L. Frank Baum's Oz series. Nick Chopper is the human name of The original tin man in the first book, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. So of course this is left as a mystery In The Witches of Oz, to be explained in a sequel. Yes, there is probably a sequel planned to answer all of those pesky unanswered  plot holes & twists that everyone has been talking about. Although it's not the greatest miniseries ever, I will probably watch the sequel because I'm a sucker for anything OZ.",1342137600,8,1532,4.380281690140845
5020747,1,B006VJ1AAI,"Please don't waste your time or money on this movie!  It is a dreadful embarrassment to the name OZ!  The acting is horrid, the make up and costumes looks like someone went and got cheap halloween costumes at a bargain center, and ""Dorothy"" had a lack of emotion, a bad wig, and a make-up job that looked like a 6 year old did it.  There was no real plot, except everyone hunting for a key.  It had the same flashback over and over and over and over again.  Nothing was explained until 2/3 through the movie, so not much made sense.  There was no good foreshadowing which made certain reveals confusing and like a last minute decision.  The special effects are dreadful and a joke.  Out of 2 hours and 45 minutes of actual playtime, about 10 minutes worth took place in OZ which was badly computer generated.  It mainly takes place in New York City...so that is a disappointment right there. How they EVER talked Christopher Lloyd, Sean Astin, and Ethan Embry to be in this movie is beyond me.  I think the fact that their roles were so short, it must have convinced them of some easy and quick money.  Lloyd was in it for all of five minutes, and Astin and Embry were brilliantly funny, but in it about ten to fifteen minutes total as little elf-like characters with bad limericks.  The movie dragged and dragged and you kept waiting for it to get good...and it never does.  If you are a fan of OZ, stay away!!!!  AVOID at all costs!!  Watch the original Wizard of Oz, Return to Oz, or Tin Man.  Now Tin Man was a mini-series that was brilliant and a praise to the series!  DO NOT waste your time here!!",1339718400,2,1604,4.346801346801347

5020749,2,B006VJ1AAI,"I caught a few minutes of the second part of The Witches of Oz on an Encore channel the other day, where I saw a taxi floating in the air inside of a bubble while the wicked witch and her monkeys are causing chaos in the streets of New York. The scene caught my interest, but I had to leave at the time and the movie wasn't going to be on again. Luckily, I happened to stumble upon it for under ten dollars and of course I had to buy it. Little did I know that the movie was 164 minutes! After a little googling, I found out it was original intended as a mini-series, but ended up being cut down to 100 minutes with 15 minutes of new special effects added and released to a limited (very limited) run in theaters earlier this year. Why in the world would they send the longer version to DVD and to Encore?

The Witches of Oz is set in our time and involves twenty-something Dorothy Gale getting a publishing contract for her OZ children stories; therefore she leaves her family farm and heads to New York. As strange situations occur, Dorothy's memory slowly returns and so do the evil Wicked Witch and her followers (Princess Langwidere, Nome King, an army of Winked Monkeys and a powerful dragon.). Soon Dorothy's friends from Oz return too, including Scarecrow, Tin Man, Cowardly Lion, Frick & Frack, the good witches, and Oz himself, as they try to help her defeat the wicked witch once and for all.

The plot sounds interesting and with such talented actors as Billy Boyd, Jeffery Combs, Sean Austin, Ethan Embry, Mia Sara, Lance Henriksen and Christopher Lloyd, one would think this movie had a chance of being good. But after watching nearly three hours I was left with mixed feelings and some confusion. At times the movie would go dark more toward an adult theme, and then suddenly, with horrible dialogue, it would change into a campy kid's movie. The actors tried to do their best with a confusing script, all except Dorothy played by Paulie Rojas who couldn't act and was widely miscasted. The special effects were your typical low-budget, but I could see the director Leigh Scott tried to do his best with what little he had to work with.

Younger kids will probably enjoy watching this new take, and somewhat of a sequel, to The Wizard of Oz, but most adults might find it painful to watch. The movie is not completely awful, there are moments, here and there, that are intriguing. In my opinion the Wicked Witch was the best part, and I liked the makeup that they used on her, I even liked the eye patch. The Witches of Oz is not a great movie, as I have seen far worse like the Syfy's Tin Man that aired a few years ago. It's a forgettable fluff, with cheesy 80's special effects, dreadful dialogue, but with a few scenes of imagination.",1337644800,2,2753,4.458333333333333

I was glued to the set the entire time.....I'm not sure why it received such bad reviews.  Some of the acting was slightly cheesy, but it is a children's story, so what do people expect?  Though it was a tv mini series, I found a lot of the special effects pretty intense and I'm glad to see characters in costume rather than CGI (reminded me of the original Star Wars...very refreshing).  I think the director and actors did a GREAT JOB with the 5 million budget they had.  Can't wait to see the sequel!  WELL DONE!!!",1337040000,3,606,4.31858407079646

5020754,1,B006VJ1AAI,"JoyceAlliene in Florida - ABOUT DOROTHY AND THE WITCHES OF OZ --  What a mess of a film !  The screenwriters of this broke a cardinal sin in rewriting classic novels --- KEEP THE ORIGINAL STORY UNDERSTANDABLE.  Readers are readers first and then viewers.  They will know when the story veers so far from the original that it cannot make sense or come to a logical climax and ending.  We get ""touchy"" when our favorite novels and books are destroyed in the retelling, as this televised version was.  I have copies of many of the old ""Oz"" books and find them so very colorful and fun and intertaining. I've viewed many other film adaptations. This version which I just saw on television tonight is SO DISAPPOINTING!  Do not buy it -- I struggled and muddled through this version on TV and must say it just confused my mind.  The production tried to be EPIC and gooey- childlike at the same time with way too many characters and plots and obvious re-writes -- the plots seemed to pop up from now where and sometimes characters dropped in and out of scenes without any understanding why there were there...it was way over the top!  Not good Sci-Fi or fiction or children's story or anything...they tried to put in comedy which didn't work and inside jokes which didn't work and drama which didn't work...Background noise overwhelms the dialog to the point no one can hear what they are saying, just see their lips move in an odd sort of way.  Under all that phony make-up, its very obvious that what they are saying (and it is repeated over and over again) is just superulous ""white sound"" not dialog at all...BAD...Strange things happen in this version which do not reflect any other version I've ever read or seen...For example, come to find out, Dorothy was not the daughter of her father in Kansas but really his Aunt born in 1898 and he was just bringing her up. How Dorothy got to the Kansas farm is not explained until the second half of the film. The whole first half of the film could have been left off!  By the end of the film, its revealed that all of the action in the film was a figment of Dorothy Gale's imagination...never happened at all...or as the second half of the film hints, perhaps Dorothy just can't remember any of her Oz experiences until she writes them down in a book...but the screenwriters didn't set the viewers up for that at all...Suddenly there's the destruction of New York City by the evil witch and her gang of flying monkeys and weird women who are able to exchange their heads like they change clothes...Much of New York is destroyed while Dorothy and her pals are spinning around in a bubble above New York in safety...Finally Dorothy lands on tera firma and she is suddenly up in an apartment where she again comes face to face with the green evil Witch (her make up is awful). The green Witch's life is at first spared by Dorothy's kindness and they destroyed by the Green Witch's own tears.  The make-up and sets are just ""cheesy"" to say the least.  Bad guys are just bad.  Over the top acting with great actors just can't save this film.  At the end, I detested this Dorothy for not being able to at least be brave enough to stick up for her friends.  No she walks away many times and says weakly, ""I can't do it...I'm not Dorothy.""  At the end the evil Witch is finally destroyed not by water or a team effort but by a very long scene where Dorothy and the evil Witch stare each other down...Dorothy muttering something like ""Be at peace.""  Then no one but Dorothy and the Scarecrow will remember any of it...why the Scarecrow??  We never are sure who the Tin Man is -- The viewer finally is told that the whole thing was dreamed of or part of Dorothy Gale's imagination so she could sell her books.  (After two hours of viewing, what a lousy ending!) And she walks away with her love interest down the streets of New York.  You don't know what happens to many of the characters, or her father in Kansas, or her life there.  The many odd plots of this version were not worth my time watching it...but being an Oz fan, I wanted to give this version a shot.  This version is a lot of noise and the dialog and plot just baffles the viewers.  Even the color on television wasn't very good...way too dark to show the contrasts...when Dorothy arrived in Oz, all you see is two women, not the Munchkins, not the beautiful gardens, nothing much to make you believe that she was at a Utopia. Even Chrisopher Lloyd (as good as he always is) is only a shadow in this version...his character is shown as violent in the first half and then he disappears until the second half comes back in the second half as a magician and street musician -- WHEW!  The original versions and many other versions are wonderful, this one does not cut the mustard.  PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS --IT IS SOOO BADLY DONE.",1336608000,3,4823,4.452272727272727

5020757,5,B006VJ1AAI,I am a huge fan of anything Oz related so I may be a little biased from the start but I can also be objective in my review.  After waiting more than 6 months to see this I was very pleased with the movie.  I read a lot about this movie online and watched the trailer many times before I actually saw it.  Going into it I knew that it was made as a tv mini-series and was not big budget Hollywood movie. I felt it was very well made and I was very entertained throughout the whole movie.  It was an interesting twist and very different from Tin Man (which I loved). This movie may not be for everyone but for me it was well worth the wait! I would love to see the full length mini-series and compare the two.  In the end I gave it 5 stars not because it's an Oscar worthy movie but because I felt it lived up to my expectations and because I was genuinely entertained.,1336176000,3,867,3.9884393063583814

5020759,1,B006VJ1AAI,"This movie had potential, until you watch it.  The story line has too many holes, the acting is B rated at best, all of the large named actors have small parts. There are terrible action sequences, and the make up or special effects are not great.  The Wicked Witch of course had the best make up, and the Tin Man was the best special effect, but that left a lot to be desired on the rest of this film.  It seemed like a hodge podge of a production.  Do yourself a favor and walk away before you spend your money.",1334966400,7,513,4.1
5020760,3,B006VJ1AAI,"This film, based off the books by L. Frank Baum, represents a new telling of the Wizard of Oz, just like Tin Man made its own version, and how Wicked was created to tell the story of the Wicked Witch of the West. In my opinion, a great part of this film was when Dorothy learned that Uncle Henry and Auntie Em were not her Uncle and Aunt, but her nephew and niece. When Uncle Henry revealed that she was indeed born in the late 1800s, I was not surprised, because her time in Oz would've taken the greater part of a century to complete. I enjoyed how the creators made her true family as L. Frank Baum, and his wife, and the fact that they were able to watch her journeys and essentially create the entire series of the Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Most people may not like this film, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1334966400,,808,4.185897435897436

It appealed to the kid in me that still finds a dream in Oz...and also to my 23-year-old self, who still keeps Oz close to my heart!

I've been an Oz fan ALL of my life (so I must admit I'm a tiny bit biased) but I really did wholeheartedly *appreciate* this movie. Everything you'd expect to be there is there. The quintessential foursome: CHECK. Good witch(es): CHECK. Bad witch(es): CHECK. Magical items: CHECK. And so much more! So much more is brought to the table, and it's fun getting to explore the ins and outs of the characters and the world of this film.

The Witches of Oz may get a lot of flack, as far as reviews I've read on the internet and message boards, but I'm really opposed to looking at films simply as surface-pieces. I try to really appreciate time and effort, as well as the passion of actors and crew. The creative minds behind this cared enough to give nods to the books that I've never seen done in film before, so that was a delight to see. It warmed my heart, as a reader, that Baum's creations--however wackily or faithfully they may have been portrayed in this film--were alluded to, and given credit. The audience sees the Oz they thought they knew taken to a place that they may have subconsciously wanted to go, but films or other media just haven't gone before. Oz and its inhabitants were really portrayed in a new light, and I applaud them for such decisions...as well as the guts to go there!

Paulie Rojas is undeniably adorable as Dorothy Gale. She personifies the innocence that is essential in Dorothy, but also shows a lot of strength.

Ari Zagaris definitely deserves credit, as he brought a lot of quirkiness to Allen, while acting as a real anchor for Rojas's Dorothy. Their pairing was definitely believable, as a creative team, the minds behind the stories and images of Oz.

It was good to see Mia Sara take on an evil role, and she added a certain bubbliness to hercharacter that was refreshing.

Christopher Lloyd was perfect for this. He brought with him every ounce of his usual gusto and whimsy, and acted accordingly as The Wizard.

I was really happy to see Billy Boyd as a normal guy--and with his natural accent, yay!

Sean Astin and Ethan Embry were cute as Muckadoos, and it was good to see them both taking on more family-friendly roles, nonsensical though they were at times. I can't imagine the film without their mischievous little Muckadoos!

Eliza Swenson gave a delightful performance as Billie (and her nefarious alter-ego--I'll let that be a surprise!). She was deliciously devilish in both turns, and she also deserves praise for her score-work! Brava, Eliza! Beautiful work.

I have to praise the practical effects as well; rarely do you see such lengths gone to when CGI could compensate. It was refreshing to see old-fashioned makeup and costume take place of what could have easily been bad CGI-work. On that note, the CGI and computer work is pretty well done.. It's not shoddy, it's consistent. It's bright, beautiful and unflinchingly magical. The effects only help add to the illusion, and the suspension of disbelief that these events really could happen in our world.

Leigh Scott is criticized quite a lot for his films, from my understanding, but this little film deserves more PRAISE. What I saw in The Witches of Oz was an attempt to achieve a very vivid, very important vision, and the success of working to create that vision. This film seemed to have a lot of heart in it. Clearly, the cast and crew cared a lot about the project. Everyone just seemed to lose themselves in it, and really have a lot of fun, cast and crew alike. In that respect, as an audience member, I couldn't have enjoyed it more.

It may come across to some as campy or stupid to some, but I definitely enjoyed it. If you're looking for a story with a lot of fun, heart, all the magic of Oz and more, look no further!",1334793600,3,4117,4.541160593792172
5020762,4,B006VJ1AAI,"Disclaimer: This is a review of the director's cut entitled ""Dorothy and the Witches of Oz,"" which isn't available for purchase yet on Amazon. It was just out in select theaters. I received a screener for review.

The story follows Dorothy Gale (Paulie Rojas), a children's author continuing the Oz series. After her uncles death back in Kansas, Dorothy discovers that her stories were not from her imagination but from her own experiences in Oz. Now, the evil witches are in New York and looking for a key that Dorothy hid as a child. Only Dorothy and her friends can stop the Wicked Witch of the West from destroying both Oz and this reality.

Based on L. Frank Baum's books not the popular film starring Judy Garland, fans will notice the additional characters right away.  And Dorothy's slippers are silver not Garland's ruby red. Christopher Lloyd as the Wizard was my biggest reason for seeing the film. He was fantastic. But I was happy to see other known faces as well such as Sean Astin and Ethan Embry as the cute, funny, and miniature Frick and Frack. And Jeffrey Combs has a brief but memorable performance as Dorothy's heartbroken father. Paulie Rojas as Dorothy is a bit wooden, but her sweetness and innocence is believable. And Eliza Swenson as Billie Westbrook was pure fun to watch in her complex role.

At first I was confused about the target audience. The mood seemed darker and suddenly violent, until I realized all of the action and fight scenes were stylized. Some of the monstrous creatures might be a bit scary for young children, but it's still only rated PG and is certainly a family movie. The (director's cut) special effects are clever and most of the evil creatures look like something out of a campy 70's or 80's film, which I think adds to the charming storybook feel. At times the movie reminded me of a favorite show ABC's Once Upon a Time - with the campy feel meets the real world. Yet Dorothy and the Witches of Oz is much more family friendly and light-hearted.  Full of adventure, magic, mystery, and colorful characters - this film was unexpectedly heartwarming and a bright homage to the classic Oz books.",1334793600,19,2149,4.689655172413793
5020763,1,B006VJ1AAI,"This is possibly one of the worst movies I have ever encountered. Having high hopes for the odd amount of A to B- List Celebs I was horribly wrong. This movie is one of the worst written, directed, and even acted movies ever produced and all involved should be shot. It is a disgrace for the Oz franchise, for Amazon to even host, and even for the poor souls that have wasted the 2 hours it takes to watch this pile of decrepit cinema.

WHAT EVER YOU DO, DO NOT BUY/RENT OR EVEN WATCH THIS HORRIBLE MOVIE!",1334620800,2,505,4.206185567010309
5020764,1,B006VJ1AAI,"I was surprised at how bad this movie was. Choose your criteria and they will all come up bad.
Really poor acting consistent with the junky TV series, shorts and D-level movies that fill out the actors other film credits.
Disjointed, jump around editing and directing producing a story that seemed like a bunch of half hour TV series patched together.
Writing and script of a modern day Dorothy showing up at a farm house with a magical key to save Oz from the bad witches was a boring and too frequently copied plot line found in many fantasy movies. Dialogue was written by the students in a high school drama class.
A couple of cheap CGI effects of swirling air to represent Dorothy escaping Oz and of a tornado and some '60s era zapping effect from the witch's wand - that's it.",1334448000,3,782,4.475524475524476
5020765,2,B006VJ1AAI,"One of the fun facts they used was that they changed the slippers back to the original sliver slippers in the book, while retaining the ruby slippers in the film. The movie is confused and disjointed. Eventually all the major plot holes are filled in, leaving just plot continuity problems common to most kid films. The part I enjoyed most of this kid's film was when Dorothy tries to pick up Billy Boyd at a bar and when Billie Westbrook (Eliza Swenson) gropes Dorothy (Paulie Rojas) in an attempt to give her more up top. Noel Thurman plays Glinda the good witch of the north who is dressed up like Brumhilda.

Dorothy writes books based on her suppressed memories. The whole plot centers around a magic book that contains a magic word that can only be opened by a magic key which Dorothy stole and hid but can't remember. The bad witches want it back. This we get in the opening of the film which tells a long drawn out story of good vs. evil similar to Lord of the Rings background. The character of Dorothy was a bit sickening as was the dorky Allen (Ari Zagaris) who appears to have been a poorly developed scarecrow.

The best characters were gnomes played by Sean Astin and Ethan Embry. The spoke in limericks. Christopher Lloyd attempted to bring life to the role of the Wizard with his Madhatter garb, but couldn't do so for the lack of decent lines. There is also a good amount of violence and some killing in this kid's film too. I am not sure who the target audience is supposed to be.",1334448000,,1498,4.423913043478261
