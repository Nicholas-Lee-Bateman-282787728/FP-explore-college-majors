811547,5,6304185901,Profoundly written and choriorghrphed.  Detailed and very specific in content.  I would recommend this movie highly to anyone reading or learning Revelation in the Bible.,1154995200,15,170,5.76
811548,3,6304185901,"I purchased this after viewing the first two videos of the Left Behind series. This is a good video, but I was hoping it would point to the return of Christ 'sooner.' From '7 Signs of Christ's Return' I got the feeling we are not as close as many of us would desire. I strongly reccommend the Left Behind series books and videos. Though they are fiction they follow the Book of Revelations closely outside of the 'what could happen' when The Rapture occurs, plot.",1095811200,4,463,4.458823529411765

Anything that takes itself this seriously is just begging to be ridiculed-and brother, does it deliver!  The Unholy Trinity in particular is comic gold.  Pure entertainment from start to finish.",1085097600,7,321,4.696428571428571
811550,5,6304185901,"I highly, highly recommend this video for those who want an accurate and quality documentary on Bible Prophecy for the Latter Days.  Graphics, Biblical context, archived historical footage and sequencing are superbly presented.
There are a few things that should be noted. Though mentioned in the film, it may not be emphasized enough that the ""watch"" which occurred at the end of 999 A.D. failed because Israel had not returned to her land, as necessitated by Zechariah 12/14, Ezekiel 36/37, Isaiah 66 and Revelation 11/13.  Also, Herod's work on the Second Temple to God was actually a renovation of the Second Temple built after the Jews returned from Babylonian Captivity, having been liberated around 534 B.C.  In addition the film shows footage of an idol which is strictly forbidden by God as an object of worship or reverance in Exodus 20:4 KJV and Leviticus 26:1 KJV (use the KJV as certain versions have ""edited"" these passages).
Whether the European Union will become the feet of iron and clay from Nebuchadnezzar's dream in Daniel 2 remains to be seen. But it certainly seems well on its way. Nonetheless, the footage of European armies shows that a new economic power is on the rise. However, most of the aircraft shown are American-made, not European.
The film appears to have potentially focused on the year 2000 rather than overtly stating that it is the ""Signs of the Times"" that are significant in prophecy, not any particular date.  And in relation to the ""Signs of the Times"" the film does an excellent job, starting with the reborn nation of Israel; miraculously founded on May 14, 1948 in a striking fulfillment of Isaiah 66:8 and Ezekiel 36:24.  The most recent foreshadowing of the coming son of perdition (2nd Thess. 2:3; cf. John 17:12 KJV), Adolph Hitler, and his Axis-power buddy, Benito Mussolini, are well-documented with prime footage.  Even though it may have been movie footage, the schoolchildren singing an homage to Adolph Hitler is beyond frightening and definitely accurate.
If you're a church pastor who is looking for teaching materials or just want a quality product for a presentation on Bible Prophecy, this is a great video.  DVD has chapter access and, like the VHS, has excellent viewing quality.
I'm glad they made this available on DVD.  Amazon. Com also carries ""End Times in the Words of Jesus"", probably the best prophecy video on End-Times Bible Prophecy.  Buy both ""7 Signs of Christ's Return"" and ""End Times in the Words of Jesus"" for study!",1062288000,105,2495,4.935560859188544
811551,5,6304185901,"I have viewed ""7 Signs Of Christ's Return"" several times and have enjoyed it each time.  It presents the doctrine of the Second Coming Of Jesus Christ in an entertaining and informative, educational format.  This video, which looks as if it may have been a TV special, presents the main points of end-times theology (such as the Tribulation, the Antichrist, the False Prophet, Armageddon,etc.) in a fashion that just about anyone could understand.  I highly recommend it.",1043625600,33,471,5.090909090909091

811553,5,6304185901,"The scriptures foretell of seven events that will herald the second coming of Jesus Christ. One is already part of history and that makes these signs all the more compelling. We are watching prophesy being fulfilled right before our very eyes. 25 % of the Bible is prophesy.

The seven signs are:

1. The Return of the Jewish people to the Holy Land and the Restoration of Israel.

2. The rise of the European Union. This is the integration of member nations into one European Union (EU). This will be the new Rome. A Political superpower with a multinational army.

3. The Rise of a dictator who will speak with great authority and is a master of intrigue. The people of the world will follow his promise of peace as he establishes world order in order to stabilize a shaky economy. People will be tired of the seeming unimportance of life and will be looking for a reason to live and to die. This ""stern-faced king"" will unite his followers in a New World Order. He is in fact the Antichrist who is sent to our earth by Satan himself. It is assumed that he will use vast media networks to mesmerize the masses. All destructive weapons will be at his disposal.

4. World Wide Religion - The assassination of the Antichrist and his ability to overcome death will astound the world. This demonic dictator will promote pagan pageantry. A second ""beast"" who is the false prophet will rally all people of the world to worship him. He will bring down fire from heaven and will make lies sound like the truth in order to seduce mankind away from God. This will be the unholy trinity: False Prophet/Satan/Antichrist. All who refuse to worship will be killed.

5. The Building of a new Temple - Christ will not return until a third Temple is built. The Temple Mount is the most fought over piece of land on earth and is only 35 acres. The first Solomon's Temple was destroyed by Babylon in 586 BC. The second Temple was built by King Herod the Great in 26BC. In 70 AD the Temple was burnt to the ground by Rome. The only retaining wall which remained is the Western wall and is the Holiest Place to the Jews. The Temple Priesthood is now training priests for the new temple. The 10 nation dictator will settle the conflict of the Temple Mount and this will signal the 7 years of the Tribulation.

6. The Invasion of Israel - A cloud will cover the land of Israel. An invasion will come from the North. God and Israel's allies will attack and defeat Israel's enemies.

7. Armageddon - Satan's efforts to destroy God's chosen people will culminate in the last battle human beings will ever fight. Christ will then return and his Kingdom will be eternal. Satan will be banished forever. Jesus Christ will then rule the earth unchallenged.

This video really has it all. There is a great representation of the dream of the statue with a golden head, silver chest and arms, bronze midsection, iron legs and feet of iron and clay. We are at the point in history where we are dealing with the ""New Rome"" or the 10 toes/10 nations which yield their sovereignty to Rome. The dream of the four beasts rising out of the sea also represent Babylon, Persia, Alexander the Great and then the Beast with 10 horns. Edmund Purdom is excellent as the host.

This is the best film ever on the End Days. If you are at all interested in finding out where the earth is headed, you will want to watch this movie. One day the earth will know peace, but according to Biblical prophecy, it will not come until Christ rules the earth. Those who are Christians will not have to wait until Christ returns. The Rapture (watch the movie ""Left Behind"" or read the book series) will take those who believe in Jesus Christ out of the world before the 7 years of Tribulation and war.

For Christians this prophesy is filled with hope. For those that don't believe, it is certain doom for the earth and its inhabitants. Which side will you be on? I hope you choose wisely. To research these issues further, I highly recommend The New Open Bible, King James Version, Study Edition sold here at Amazon. It has great references so you can look up specific information. The Bible can also tell you how to get out of the world alive. It reveals all mysteries, you just have to read to find them :). I have found that all the answers to my life here and in my life after this life on the earth are contained in one book. The Bible will guide you on the road to true enlightenment.

811941,2,6304185901,"I decided to be generous and give this video a two because I do admit it was entertaining.  It is sad that so many people believe such utter nonsense.  More concerning, is that some of these events may actually occur because people believe them.  That is why I fight against such harmful beliefs such as these as I fear they will lead to the destruction of our civilization in a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy.  This did remind me why I abandoned organized religion years ago.  I thought it was hilarious how the documentary basically said that other forms of belief were stupid, but Christian beliefs made absolute sense.  It was also hilarious, if scary, how they were able to turn the nonsense written in the Bible into some coherent narrative of the supposed ""end times"".

811942,5,6304185901,"Being this program is a few years and many of the news events covered are ""old news"" now I was curious to see how it fits today and to see more about how what they said has worked out years later.  I found that this program to be especially meaningful to me now looking at it that way, that the information they presented is indeed accurate and it was not a phony push of someone else's ideas, but truly looking at events in the light of God's word and past events with some indication of where the future is going, as per reliable prophecy.

The film was clearly not intended to be a highly detailed study as it is at a needed quick review/high level pace. It can at least get all of us back in touch with this message quickly and easily. Yet I felt this film does a great job at it's goals and does encourage further study for those interested to see more into these important prophecies and events, and to retain hope!  Great job.  I want to see more of these, as we all too often ""get locked into"" our ""normal daily routines and responsibilities and its all too easy to lose sight of the real future and where God's prophecy and all these factors in world history are taking us to.",1400457600,3,1185,4.230088495575221

811981,2,6304185901,"Before doing any prophecy study some of the biggest stumbling blocks must be REMOVED. The biggest is the definition of the word  ""jew"". Most people do not know that the word jew did not exist until 1775 AD! It has three definitions 1: Of the tribe of Judah, 2: Of the land of Judeah; 3; of the religion of Judaism. You will have a tough time finding a unrevised 1611 King James, but for example it read ""Salvation is of the tribe of Judah""  Joseph was of the line of David who was the king of the tribe of Judah.  Another stubling block is that  NEVER ONCE in the bible are jews called ""Israel"". There NEVER was a country called ""Israel"". Jacob was surnamed Israel like Smith or Johnson. Tell me, when you run into a hispanic man named ""Jesus"", do you kiss his feet? Ofcourse not!  YET a group of Zionists name a chunk of Palestine ""Israel"" and all of a sudden ""Israel is reborn!"" Talk about the traditions of men over the words of God..SHAME!  In II Kings 17:24-27 King Ashur of Assyria conquers the 10 tribes and moves them NORTH. This was around 700BC. 16 MILLION Israelites just ""disappear"". Oh and don't  forget he gave the land of Israel to the Samaritans, who brought their worship of Molech and their Babylonian TALMUD, which  is still considered OVER the Torah by jews today. In the new testament this was known as ""the Tradition of the Elders"". YEP the very book Jesus fought!  Back to 700 BC. Somehow the European nations went from caves and clubs to Beautiful architecture around 500 BC..coincidence? Even our great Thomas Jefferson knew the Anglo saxon, Lombards, swedes and Teutons were Israels remnants. One of the most simple things Christ said so we wouldnt be confused by the history of men was ""By their fruits you shall know them."" Who brought the Bible to all ends of the Earth? What people dropped their paganism for Christianity without force or free food? Read John 8:44 Christ said to the jews that they are the children of the devil and that ""My sheep hear my voice, and you are not of My sheep""  So what is it? Is Christ a liar and the jews are ""Gods Chosen""?  Where people confuse prophecy is the restoration of JERUSALEM, not ""Israel"". God told his people that they would not be able to enter Jerusalem again until they followed the ways of YHWH. Odd enough, during the Crusades, what was the ONE city that the Anglos could not conquer form the Sultan? JERUSALEM!  IF you think the current residents of ""Israel"" are following his ways you must be jewish yourself and not believe Christ is Savior and the Son of God! If you study the gifts bestowed upon Israel and the identification marks of them, only one people match, and the jews match NOT ONE. Furthermore 90% of the jews in Israel have no bloodline to the middle east, They are Khazars (what is Georgia now) which the king back in Crusade times made Judaism the state religion so they could trade with both the Christians and Muslim. ""Israel to be a lender and never borrow"" YET ""israel""  is in debt to USA OVER 240 BILLION! ""You are my battleaxe, and my weapons of war"" I hate to be the bringers of bad news but only the Anglo has conquered  every corner of the world they wanted, ""Israel"" would be nothing without our donations of militia. These are FACTS. When you consider that the USA brought all the tribes back together under one roof, (British, Irish, French, Swede, German, etc.) one must look at what a bountiful land was given as promised, just as Europe was to these 16 million refugees.  WE even shed our own peoples blood so that slavery of what was considered then a lesser people cease to exist. On that note, TODAY in ""Israel"" white slavery prostitution of non jewish russians is rampant and LEGAL.  If you read the short book of Obadiah the prophet in the OT there will be NO DOUBT that the jewish state is Edom.

Now for  ""the beast"". The victor writes history so all you hear is ""bad evil Hitler"".  Last I knew what is mentioned of the beast which is a nation or SYSTEM, is that ""no man can buy or sell save he...""  We know that money is evil. We also know that God spoke against usury(interest). Almost every country is run by the IMF fiat currency, and those that are not(goldbacked) are somehow remived from power. After Khadafi was killed, in fact, the first building to go up was an IMF bank! (Chase if Im right) I could go on and on about the banking system, but I will keep it to relation. Little do people know today, but during the time of our great depression, two countries FLOURISHED, and unlike propoganda saying it was military construction based. the truth was these two countries kicked out the international bankers and based thier money on  a unit per hour of labor, therefore money was the trading tool it was meant to be. The citizens of these countries made about $60hr in todays buying power standards..who? GERMANY and JAPAN! Funny how we went to war with these two. SO while the misconception of Hitler being the 1st beast is held, the REALITY is that Hitler was the one who deliverd a ""fatal blow that was miraculouly healed"". Think about it if you were starving and working just above slave wages yet your neighbors got rid of international banking scum and were able to live a fruitful life, wouldnt you follow them? National socailism was based on least trade as possible and everyone working for the common whole. You can say what you want about facism or Imperialism,but if you has ONE leader that is unfair,you can overthrow him. In democracy, one guy makes a mess and leaves his term a free man to pass the mess to the next guy. Not to sound antisemtic, but it is a fact that most of the international bankers were jewish, and wil make all kinds of exaggerations and outright lies so that thier system of easy money is not disturbed. fact is Hitler followed Abe Lincolns money plan after the bankers in NY wanted to charge him 28% interest to fule his war on slavery. It also got him killed when he wants planning on going back to central banks after the war. Google ""red cross records holocaust"" to get an idea of the propoganda  by the victor. This is what got that bishop in trouble for holocaust revisionism.
You want to know what the new religion is? Holocaustianity.  Today you can deny Christ out in public, say the most outright blasphmemic twisted statements but even say ""I don't think it was quite six million"" you will be a social pariah, possible lose your job, be called a ""holocaust denier"" which for someis worse than pedophile, and in some countries, like Germany you can spend 5 yrs in prison!  It is the one point in history that cannot be debated even though world census and demographics don't add up!
Most people don't know that over 30 million Christians were killed in the Bolshevik revolution before WWII. IF fact Lazar Kognovich was known for saying as they burned the villages and slaughter the people ""leave nothing but the synagogues standing""  Hitler did use an iron fist but after losing thier houses because a special few knew when the mark would collapse and cashed infor gold. these people were asked to leave in 1933 unless they wanted to WORK. Those that refused to leave by the time FRANCE DECLARED war had to be put in camps to protect soldiers form geurilla warfare (remember ""inglorious basterds"") THey wanted morality, the jewish homosexual/trans theatres was filth they didn't want in their country. The USA is a melting pot, and we forget countries has a right to be their people, their culture. If a GUEST cant act properly then can be asked to leave.

We also have our ""false Christ"" his name is ""Jesus the Jew"". Secular roman records, in the Vatican now, include a letter by a roman soldier who described Christ as having ""golden hair straight to the nap of his neck,then curly with blue eyes that seem to look right through your soul"".  Yes all those old depictions were based on fact, not ""European view"".  Christ was NEVER a rabbi of Judaism. Judaism is based on the TALMUD which he spoke against. ""Rabbi"" simply translates to ""teacher"" The Pharasees and scribes are the rabbis and lawyers of today.  Christ knew there would be much confusion, which satan thrives off and therefore is why in Rev. 2 and 3 when is speaks of the CHURCHES, the last verse is ""the jews that say they are jews but are not, they are the SYNAGOGUE of Satan. You don't think that Christ knew ahead that ""yehudi"" Judah and Judeah would be combined into one word to cause confusion amongst his sheep.  Its not a secret that powerful jews bought up all the media, and publishing companies. Thats why you see this ""Jesus the jew"" all over  JCTV, and you cant find anything other than Destiny publishers on the TRUE tribes of Israel. It was written in the Old testament how we would ""forget who we are""  ""your hidden inheritance"" is a great book to get back on the true track. Anything on Christian Identity is talked as ""anyone not white is an animal"" and other ridiculous stuff as being racist if you see the white race as the true tribes of Israel. These jews who created the state of ""israel' need to keep up this facade so that well meaning Christians will support them in their slaughter of Palestinans as bieng ""their right""to the holy land. Once again, ""by their fruits you shall know them"" this applies to the children of God as well as his enemies. Canada is a socalist state which is truning more away from God jsut as communism did. ""the enemy coming from the north"" could well be how we are turning more like Canada as in Obama saying that ""America is no longer a Christian nation""  legalizing homosexual marriage. Read Leviticus 18 on how gifts were bestowed upon Israel and then removed. We have had more thing go wrong in this country since we joined the UN and lowered our knee to say we have the same vote as any pagan country and the creation of the State of Israel. When you strip away the beliefs you are force fed by state churches of today and actually READ the Bible, there will be no doubt in your mind who is who.",1388707200,2,9995,4.510508849557522

812015,4,6304185901,"Being an observer of a variety of end time books, movies, and teachers I have noticed that each of them follow a similar pattern. They take Biblical prophecy and marry them to current events. This is not just a recent phenomenon but others throughout history have done the same thing. This film did not rely so heavily on current events as others but the film makers definitely lean on them. So I think a word of caution is in order for those whose may focus too much on the end times.  There is a reason why Jesus said no one would know the day or the hour but to simply be ready. The Bible does give us signs but realistically many of those signs have always taken place, plagues, earthquakes, wars, etc.  History is not on the side of those who set dates, sold their goods and waited. Neither is it on the side of those who today attempt to make similar predictions.  In fact they may contribute to the skepticism of the world with the so called delay in Christs return. Im thinking of second Peter Above all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires. 4 They will say, Where is this coming he promised?

Jesus does say the sun will be darkened, and the moon will lose its light and the stars will fall from the heavens before the last day.  Jesus says He will pour out His Grace upon the world, and the time of suffering will be shortened or no one would survive.  The proof of that is [...] so investgate that.
The early church fathers kenw the book of revelation was about the Eurcharist, and The Roman Catholic Mass. Read Dr. Scott Hahn's, ""The Supper of The Lamb"" to understand that.
There will be no 3rd temple because the Messiah has come, the Lord Jesus Christ, and He gave us the only sacrifice God will accept, so no more animal sacrifices.  besides the only tribe of Israel left is the tribe of Juda, so there can be no priests.  The old testament is clear that the priests can only be from the Tribe of Levites, which no longer exists, so No Levite priests, no sacrifices.  The new covenant, and new Passover has replaced the old.  The Lamb of God has come, and been sacrificed by the High Priest, Jesus who is both High Priest, and The Lamb of God.  The Arc of the Covenant is ( see the Book of Revelation) seen in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, and a crown of twelve stars upon her head, Mary the foretold virgin mother of Jesus held within her both the Word of God, and The Bread of Life ( Jesus said, If you do not eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life within you.) He is the Lamb of God, the New Passover Lamb, and just as you must have eaten the Passover Lamb in Exodus to save the first born from Death, We now must Eat the Passover Lamb of God, The Holy Eurcharist, the Body & Blood, soul & divinity that is Jesus Himself, present in Every Catholic Mass around the world, or you have no life in you and cannot be saved.

The manufacturers of this DVD does not mention anything about microchipping. They are either totally ignorant or taking you intentionally for a ride.
