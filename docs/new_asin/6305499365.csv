1039671,5,6305499365,With the opening scene in a commuter traffic jam you know you are in for a treat. This is comedy with a deft touch...not the mindless gross humor you see everywhere today. Any office worker who has lived under the thumb of  the organization will see their life painfully recreated.,931132800,,281,4.62
1039672,5,6305499365,"This movie has to be my favorite movie of all time.  When I saw this movie I was falling out of my seat laughing as I saw similarities between this movie and my feelings about school.  A great movie by Mike Judge and great  performances by all the actors, some of which orginal MADTV fans will  recognize.  A must see for comedy lovers or anybody who has to work.",930787200,,363,4.202898550724638
1039673,5,6305499365,"(this movie is by Mike Judge, the creator of Beavis and Butthead, so you know it's good) If you hate your job, or don't have a job and think you're missing something, you'll want to see this. Also most kids can relate to  how the main character (Livingston) hates his job (like school) and all the  annoying things that happen every single day, and all those annoying bosses  and co-workers you just want to punch. He does what most dream of but never  dare to do... he says screw it and quits, and makes the company that has  been useing him all these years and never promoting him and expect all his  time, to work for him for a change... But I don't want to give it all away,  so let me just say, GIVE YOUR HEART A WORK OUT AND WATCH (and buy) THIS  MOVIE FOR NON-STOP LAUGHTER!!!!!",929750400,,785,4.221476510067114

I have a large blu ray collection and tons of other movies play on this unit, but have had a few movies that will not play and therefore have had to return them.

All of the extras would play fine. But the movie would not, jumping to a specific scene would not. Same at the other movies that would not play, once an attempt is made to play the movie (or any part of it), the unit locks up. I have to unplug power from the DVD player, power it back up and open the door to get it out. Have not figured out the pattern but some blu ray discs have some feature/format that makes them unplayable on some players. (The player is up to date with latest firmware, so it's not that.)

1040656,2,6305499365,"Review of Office Space
Hot Toasty Rag, June 11, 2017

For the depressed depressives out there, this movie will become your new best friend. For everyone else, well, itll be slightly funny the first time you see it, and then every subsequent time your depressed friend makes you watch it with him, youll cringe and start counting down the minutes until its over.

A man hates his job. His boss is a pain. Tale as old as time, right? The man goes to a hypnotist to help his depression, but he never snaps out of his trance. All of a sudden, hes free to speak his mind! He can stop going to work, talk back to his boss, and ask out that hottie waitress hes been eyeballing all week.

This is definitely a guy movie. The premise, the characters, the music, everything about it is geared towards men. The one female character is played by none other than the darling of the 1990s, Jennifer Aniston. Naturally, she stands by her grungy, callous, loafing boyfriend no matter what. I think a better title for this film might have been Every Mans Fantasy.

Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to some language and adult themes, I wouldnt let my kids watch it.",1497225600,,1194,4.513888888888889

I don't know what it is, but something just draws me to this office comedy sub-genre of dysfunctional workplaces/awkward and quirky but human people struggling in office environments.  I guess because I relate so much.  Like I related so much to Peter here.  And, like him, was lucky to get out while I still had my (relative) sanity intact before I became another Milton, haha.  Be it this movie, The Office series (both versions), Clerks,...really anything like that just compels me to watch it and relate/sympathize/empathize.

1040934,5,6305499365,"OFFICE SPACE is a color film from 1999 taking place in the present era.  The film was written and directed by Mike Judge, famed for creating the cartoon series BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD.  Mike Judge is also notable for his movie IDIOCRACY, which arguably predicted the disastrous  outcome of the election of November 2016 and the consequent chaos and decline in the federal government of the United States of America.

Most of the film takes place in an office space consisting of dozens of cubicles, in a company called INITECH.  Small parts of the film occur in the apartment of the protagonist, played by Ron Livingston, and in a nearby restaurant called, Chotchkie's, where actress Jennifer Aniston (love interest) works as a waitress.  In a nutshell, the film provides a highly accurate portrayal of the bizarre and irrational nature of the employment situation in companies that make use of cubicles.  In my opinion, this film should be considered to be a national treasure, because of its accurate portrayal of the human condition.  Of course, there exist other theatrical portrayals of the typical office situation, though not as accurate as OFFICE SPACE, and these include the 2002 color Twilight Zone episode MR. MOTIVATION, and the earlier black and white Twilight Zone episodes, THE MIND AND THE MATTER from 1961, and MR. BEVIS, also from 1961.

The characters include:

RON LIVINGSTON.  Mr. Livingston, who resembles actor Greg Kinnear, plays the protagonist.  He is constantly subjected to little annoying things taking the form of mind-numbingly repeated telephone information, provided by a squeaky-voiced fat lady in the next cubical, trivial self-centered pig-headed comments from a meek character in another nearby cubicle.  The meek character, played by actor Stephen Root, has an obsession for his favorite red-colored stapler, and his character is given a blotchy rash on his face and wears thick glasses.  Yet another source of annoyance is the repeated verbal reminders given to Livingston about complying with a memo and filling out a routine form correctly.  We learn at the mid-point of the film that the repeated verbal reminders are due to the fact that the Livingston character has eight different supervisors.

JENNIFER ANISTON.  Ms. Aniston plays a waitress in a nearby chain restaurant, where all the waiters and waitresses are required to wear a green sash with at least seventeen novelty buttons pinned on it.  These buttons are called ""flair.""  The fact that the buttons are called ""flair"" in itself, is used as a running joke that is repeated in various scenes taking place in this restaurant -- but this running joke wears well, and it cleverly and skillfully illustrates yet another absurd aspects of many employment situation.  The slight absurdities in Aniston's waitress job are a foil and counterpoint for the grosser absurdities that must be endured by Livingston.

GARY COLE.  Gary Cole plays the antagonist.  He is often on the screen, and he plays the smarmy and arrogant vice president of Initech.  Gary Cole's character is the man that most viewers will love to hate.  His character is very much like the boss in the Twilight Zone episode, MR. MOTIVATION.

CONSULTANTS.  One of the prominent themes in OFFICE SPACE are two consultants, who were hired to enhance efficiency in the company, though all of the characters know that they were hired to make decisions for layoffs.  Both are named ""Bob"" and one is Bob Slydell and Bob Procter.  They are played by actors John McGinley who often has a comical and weird grimacing expression, and by actor Paul Wilson, who is grossly obese and has a lovable personality.  The rapport between the two Bobs is absolutely perfect.  The chubby character ""Bob Porter"" reminds me of Jonathan Winters.

TRIO OF COMRADES.  Ron Livingston has two friends in OFFICE SPACE, namely those played by Ajay Naidu and David Herman.  David Herman seems to resemble a young Bill Gates.  Both of them are software engineers.

ORLANDO JONES.  This actor plays a magazine salesman who materializes at Livingston's apartment door, where Livingston (for reasons I do not disclose here) requests names of drug dealers so that he can do needed money-laundering.  I was delighted to see Orlando Jones, because of his fine role in TIME MACHINE starring Guy Pearce.

THE PLOT. As you can see, I have not really disclosed the plot.  But what I will say, is that in my opinion this one very best comedy films in existence.  My most favorite comedy film is NORTH starring Elijah Wood and Bruce Willis, while my other favorite comedy films are MEANING OF LIFE and HOLY GRAIL by Monty Python.  I am able, from my own work experiences, to disclose situations that are more bizarre and irrational than those depicted in OFFICE SPACE.  But I will spare you this information right now.",1487462400,,4831,5.016331658291457

If you don't agree that this is one of the funniest movies you've ever seen, then I am very sorry, but my opinion is that you will laugh hard and you will also rank this movie as one of the all time greats!

1041779,4,6305499365,"Great satire on the cubicle life, and really a kind of modern take on 'Modern Times.'  I can't help but think that the traffic jam at the beginning, and the close up of the watch at the start of Peter's work day were homages to Charlie Chaplin's opening scenes in 'Modern Times.'  Even if they weren't, this movie really captures the helplessness of this kind of work and the emptiness of the kind of fake business ""culture"" that so many companies try to create.  Gary Cole is spot on as the passive aggressive manager, and the two consultants are hilarious.  My only complaint is Mike Judge's occasional leap into his Beavis and Butthead period when ""corn-hole"" jokes and other kind of teenage potty humor ruled the day.  Fortunately, most of the jokes in this movie are clever, and it's depiction of modern alienation holds up after 16 years.",1473292800,3,844,4.675675675675675

1041950,5,6305499365,"Ask 20- or 30-somethings about this hilarious comedy and you will be deluged by movie quotes, references, and the term ""a cubicle classic."" Most people who have worked in an office will agree that individual scenes in this movie are among the most humorous expos&eacute;s of cubicle life ever put on screen. While teens will certainly get the jokes, they probably won't identify with the situations as much as a young adult who has experienced office life.

There is no doubt that creator/director Mike Judge has an uncanny eye for revealing the humorous realities and hypocrisies of office life. The banal and often inexplicable tasks that people do as well as the defeating weight of bureaucracy are mocked with dead-pan humor in a series of interviews between employees and the consultants. While some parents might find the end scenes problematic, the sketches that comprise the bulk of the movie are painfully funny observations on office life that will leave many saying ""too true, too true"".

1042124,4,6305499365,"What makes this 1999 film so iconic and memorable isn't the main character, but Milton, the employee at the bottom of the social pecking order in the office who lacks confidence and is the bullied victim by most employees in the workplace.  He is brilliantly played by Stephen Root.  Jennifer Aniston is the most prominent name on the DVD cover versions these days, but like Milton, her character doesn't have much screen time, she's more of less the love interest of the main character who initially is too scared to do things like ask out his waitress. She's a waitress whose main joke of the film is her clash with her boss who keeps hassling her to wear more bling rather than the 13 or so minimum she reluctantly wears to show she is a more dedicated team player and loyal employee, and she rightfully keeps replying if you want me to wear 37 bits of bling, just make that the rule.

Your main actor in this one is Ron Livingston who plays Peter, an employee who doesn't like his job, and doesn't have the backbone to stand up to his boss, brilliantly played by Gary Cole.  Nor his girlfriend, who makes him attend a hypnotist relationship fixer, who dies while putting him under.  So suddenly Peter doesn't care about consequences, he's not afraid to speak his mind and he's taking that attitude to the office (when he can be bothered to show up).  You've also got John C. McGinley (Scrubs) as one of two Bobs who have been hired to make the business more efficient by firing those who aren't really necessary.  Diedrich Bader (Drew Carey Show) as Peter's neighbour and some other regognisable faces.

Office Space isn't the greatest movie ever made, but most people will relate to the frustrations with the photocopier fax machine and way people are treated in the workplace.",1468108800,,1782,4.634920634920635

1042292,5,6305499365,"If you have ever worked in corporate cube-farm America, especially in Information Technology; you owe it to yourself to see this movie.
Scott Adams / Dilbert kneel down and worship at the alter of Mike Judge... That's just how accurate this movie is - certainly for 1990s-mid-2000s IT juxtaposition.

Truly a masterpiece that, if given the thought is just as introspective and revealing of societal flaws as it is overtly hilarious.
That being said, if you've NEVER worked in corporate cube-farm America (too young; always been an independent, or family owned small-to-mid sized business, etc.) - don't bother.  You'll have a puzzled or bored look on your face more than a smile/laugh.  Don't spend your $ on something you won't get or enjoy.  Unless you want to know how the other 3/4s lives. ;-)",1465862400,3,797,4.925373134328358

I'm not sure why they needed to cover the original bar code that sits on the original glossy, color DVD insert beneath the plastic that wraps around the DVD case, but for some reason they did, and the stickers they used are sticky! They aren't the kind that simply peel off without leaving residue behind. The leftover bar code sticky bits mar the appearance of the DVD, and for someone like me, who is a bit of a collector, and likes to take care of her things and have them look mint, this is bothersome.

This is a humorous film which could have easily been ranked at four or five stars, but the profanity and sexual overtones greatly detract from what otherwise would have been a classic comedy movie. Nevertheless, it is easy to understand why it has reached cult-level status, and is a must-see if you're ever worked as a cubie.

The opening scene is truly hilarious, especially for anyone who has had to suffer the daily grind of commuting into the big city. If that scene doesnt get you laughing, then you probably won't get the rest of the movie.

The cube farm contains various dysfunctional characters, and Ron Livingston plays the lead as Peter Gibbons perfectly. He cant stand his job or his smarmy boss, and dreams of ways to get-rich-quick so he can escape the cube farm forever. The character ""Milton"" is just great, as doesnt everyone have a favorite dysfunctional co-worker who richly deserves a kick me sign on his/her back?

One Monday morning, Peter has had it (its not even 10 am!) and asks his two co-workers if theyd like to get a mid-morning coffee at the nearby caf. After he complains and laments about his cube life, one of them says hey, whats this I hear youve been having trouble with putting cover sheets on your TPS reports?  As Peter rolls his eyes, the other guy chimes in with, Yeah, didn't you get that memo??  HILARIOUS!  One mystery is why the producers chose to refer to a memo when it would have been many times funnier and relevant if it was instead Didnt you get that e-mail?

Perhaps the funniest scene is with the Two Bobs, the consultants whove been hired to help in restructuring (downsizing) the company. The interview with Michael Bolton is truly sidesplitting. Then Peter is interviewed, and he admits that he is a time-waster, and lacks motivation. After he reveals to The Bobs that he probably only does 15 minutes of real work per week, the two consultants talk to themselves afterword about how Peter is a perfect candidate for promotion to a management position! ahahahHAHAHAHAHAHH!!!!!! Simply CLASSIC!

Anyone whos worked in an office has no doubt experienced printer problems. Michael Bolton gets really irritated with office printer jams, and has had enough. So the three of them take the confounded thing out to an open field where Michael can release all his pent-up anger at the persnickety machine. After smashing it with a baseball bat, they start to walk back to the car, but Michael turns and makes another run at the printer! His two co-workers grab him and drag him back to the car, as Michael holds onto few cables and wires (the entrails from his kill) back with him as a souvenir just hysterical!

I happen to be a Boomer who cannot stand rap/hip hop music, although the producers do a fair job of making it work here with the various scenes. The major negative is the poor choice of black rap music, what with profanity and F-bombs laced throughout. None of the main characters are black, so it is inexplicable that the producers would have even chosen that genre for the mostly-white cube-dwellers. The movie would have been raised several notches without rap music to begin with, but at least they could have selected some cuts without profanity (is that possible?!?), giving it more universal appeal. One star subtracted for using rap-crap hip hop music when there were plenty of great compositions available and more appropriate for the theme of office cubes. For example, the scene where Peter and Michael Bolton are slipping a virus into the mainframe would have been classic if they had rolled in Take This Job and Shove It! by Johnny Paycheck!

The dream scene where Peter is having a nightmare of his boss screwing his girlfriend could have also been left on the cutting room floor; another star knocked off just for that sequence. But I will admit that  the blond haired co-worker telling Peter hes going to invite that chick from logistics to a work party and that hes going to show her his O-Face IS pretty funny!

In summary, three stars for a movie that has a great theme about the absurdities and frustrations of working on Cube Farms, but dilutes the message with too much profanity, rap-crap, and sexual innuendo.

Also the music is very fun to listen. Rap song totally matched with each situation and they rock!

1043225,5,6305499365,"Set during the time of the Y2K computer programming crisis that was ultimately a non-event, this movie offers the ultimate caricature of the typical office environment and software engineering profession.

I give this movie 5-stars because although the humor is dry and eccentric and may not tickle the average funny bone, I laughed out loud as I could identify with many of the situations depicted. I particularly liked the following scenes --

o  Opening credit sequence in which the old man with the squeaky walker is making faster progress than Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) in his commute to work.

o  Yes, I did get the memo for the TPS reports, again and again and again.

o  Peter and Joanne (Jennifer Aniston) finding romance in reruns of ""Kung Fu"". My wife and I spent Saturday afteroons on our sofa enjoying ""Black Belt Theater"" on local independent stations.

o  Peter changes his mind about his written confession for the dastardly cents-rounding deed gone awry (and $300,000 worth of traveler cheques to return the stolen money) that he has just slipped under his boss's (Bill Lumbergh's) door, but cannot reach deep enough underneath the door to retrieve it. But the next day, when Milton wants to retrieve his red stapler from Lumbergh's office, he simply turns the unlocked door handle to go into Lumbergh's office. (It was unlocked the whole time.)

o  With the traveler's cheques that he has retrieved from Peter's letter, muttering Milton still cannot get any respect at the tropical resort.

I could certainly use those traveler's cheques myself, but I guess I'll just settle for a red stapler.",1447545600,,1616,4.966542750929368

1043357,4,6305499365,"so i watched this movie, as i really liked the director and came across this one when researching other titles Mike Judge has directed. i knew nothing prior to watching it, apart from that Jennifer Aniston starred in it. i really only bought it so i could qualify for free shipping, as a space filler, so wasn't really too phased or worried about not liking it. after watching it, it completely exceeded my expectations. i thought it would be like the UK, US television series ""the office"" - not a show i really ever enjoyed. i just never saw the attraction to a television series based on the shenanigans that people get up to at a 9 to 5 desk job. but this movie...like it was cool man. it was. characters had personality and they had likability. and last but not least, without giving too much away, it also had an ending where the little guy wins and is able to overthrow a corporation run by tyrannical employers.

so look, it's a nice little mix and match of ""the office"" meets ""horrible bosses"" but better than both of them. it has the humour that ""the office"" lacked, without the tomfoolery of ""horrible bosses"".
not a laugh every minute comedy, but i'd 100% recommend it to anyone looking for an easy watch that doesn't fail to entertain.",1444780800,3,1247,4.517699115044247

It shows the boring life of data entry in an office where there are tons of cubicals, making you feel like a mouse in a maze, being frustrated with machinery that never works, bosses who are condescending, and co-workers who are annoying. Pokes fun at being a responsible person, by doing the opposite of what any employee should do.  The fact of not paying bills anymore just because you ""don't feel like it"" is totally not a way to live your life, which is what makes it so funny! Cast is great.",1437436800,,601,4.564814814814815

Hollywood never seems to get everyday things quite right, like its chronic habit of putting ordinary people into million-dollar houses, or sending them to church in Westminster Abbey. In this case, it builds a fake office. It seems never to have seen a real one, where real people with real skills work at real jobs, however dull. Instead of a single frustrated middle-aged fat man, we get two, plus a repellent boss. And Jennifer Aniston, while nice to look at, really contributes nothing to the action; she seems written in just to give some gender balance to three boys, the main characters.. They (and their target audience?) seem just out of their junior year at Elmwood High and demonstrate no salable skills at all. We never even know what they do: computers? accounting? legal? No; the situations are funny and the office rules are reliably boneheaded, but the satire stays grounded because everything is transparently artificial.",1430438400,,1004,4.87719298245614

I don't work in a cubicle but pass by a place just like this on my way to work everyday.  There are big windows and you can see inside.  All cubicles.  I could never do it.  There were quite a few laughs in this movie.  A brief synopsis without giving anything away: There's this guy who writes/fixes computer code and he works for the type of company where you can just go out of your mind from the nonsense.  The kind of place where you really are wasting your life.  He basically reaches the point where he just gives up.  Ironically, that's when good things start to come his way.  But of course, the good times can't last.  The only thing I didn't like was the soundtrack, a bit too much with the rap music.  Just not my thing.  But a good movie anyway.

1044349,5,6305499365,"A brilliant comedy about work and the mind-numbing, soul-crushing environment of working. This story captures all of the mindless aggravations of a daily job and turns them into mind-melting eruptions that take our characters into a series of ""don't go there"" scenarios and ends up the only logical way it could--with total destruction!

1044350,5,6305499365,"Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) has a job as a desk worker at Initech. Peter hates his job. Peter hates his boss, Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole). Peter hates most of his coworkers. Peter hates his cheating girlfriend. Peter hates his life. One day, Peter visits a hypnotherapist hoping some mental treatment might improve his outlook on life. He leaves the doctor in a new, relaxed state and decides that he is no longer going to let his job or adult responsibilities stop him from enjoying the life he wants.

To be sure, this movie is absolutely hilarious. The movie pokes fun at and satirizes various idiosyncrasies of the modern American office workplace. The characters in this movie are very funny and memorable with a script that is endlessly quotable. What makes this movie truly memorable is not just the obvious jokes but also the wittiness it uses in its depictions of office life. The movie is also a funny product of its time such as the dated technology, discussion of the Year 2000 problem, and the music.

In conclusion, this is a hilarious film that I would recommend to anyone that likes comedy movies.",1425081600,,1114,4.766839378238342

The lead characters, Ron Livingston and Jennifer Anniston, do their best work in this film, or at least I have not seem them do better work.

This is one of my fav comedies of all time. It is funny from beginning to end and it has some timeless messages to share too:

Follow your heart, don't give up when the going gets tough, the good guys DO win sometimes, revenge is oh so sweet, it's always darkest just before the dawn, the hare can win the race (MILTON!!!) and so on and so on.

Ron Livingston is perfection in this movie, I can't imagine anyone playing his part better. Everyone was great in the supporting cast too.

If you've ever had a bad day at the office or years of them, this is a classic you won't want to miss.

One more thing, the soundtrack was kind of crude (lyrics) at times, if you happen to be watching this with young children it might not be appropriate. But it did fit with the theme of the movie. Damn it feels good to be a gansta!!! ;-) Uh, yeaaaah....",1417478400,,1050,4.178217821782178

1045196,5,6305499365,"Office Space NEVER gets old! It almost seems as if it becomes more poignant over time. And this quote from the main character Peter Gibbons should be tweeted/shared always and forever:

""Michael, we don't have a lot of time on this earth! We weren't meant to spend it this way. Human beings were not meant to sit in little cubicles staring at computer screens all day, filling out useless forms and listening to eight different bosses drone on about about mission statements.""

This movie has so many ah-ha moments it's scary -- I mean for a comedy it ends up showing you so much about real humanity and the inner struggle of the common working man/woman (especially those who work in the office farms).

I think we all should have our ""Peter Gibbons"" moment every now and then, that time when we say ""you know what? I don't want to do this anymore."" or that moment when you realize your wasting your life and you take action -- just once, walk past the boss or come to work without the jacket and tie/skirt and heels.

The other thing I appreciate about this movie and all movies of this era (90's and before) is there's no cell phones, no internet, no iPads, etc.  Interesting to go back and see that we actually lived lives and communicated with people without the tech we cling to today.",1415318400,24,1291,4.5

Stuttering stop and start for the entire video (motion stops while sound continues until images catch up) with a spinning wheel.  By contrast, I have had that issue maybe once with Netflix in years of service.  I am no Netflix fanboy  -- their streaming selection is limited.  I would definitely rent more Amazon, but not when the quality is terrible in terms of Amazon streaming.  It's not my speed at home.  It's fine and I have no problem with  Netflix, YouTube, etc. on the same Mac at home.  If this is a perk of Prime, I have to rethink that expense.  Fast shipping alone is not worth the annual price for Prime. I commented about this before to Amazon and got no reply.  I also had to rent a video twice because it would not stream the first time.

Office space is one of the absolutely worse movies my wife and I have ever seen. It is so bad that I decided to report it so others are warned.  How a movie with Jennifer Aniston in it could be bad is beyond me but the director did accomplish that.  I am not going into the story because honestly there wasn't one. When I sit for 15 minutes with a comedy movie and am waiting for something funny, I know I am in trouble and worse yet, I know the movie is also. This movie we would rate right along with ""About Schmidt"" which was the absolute low point for Jack Nicholson.  Sorry, I know there were some who liked this movie.

In my humble opinion, they really didn't need to get so outlandish (SPOILER ALERT)... such as grand theft and burning down the entire office.

1046211,5,6305499365,"I really think this movie will hold up in any era.  Really as long as corporations exist this movie will be hilarious.  To the extent there is a plot it almost takes a back seat to making fun of the corporate culture.  And lets be honest, for those of us who work in the corporate world some of the things they are making fun of (albeit in over the top ways in some instances) still very much exist.  It was made from an animated short by Mike Judge the creator of Bevis and Butthead and King of the Hill.

The movie centers around three guys who have crappy jobs at a corporation called Initech.  Ron Livingston plays Peter, who is the lead character.  He becomes completely apathetic toward his job after a botched hypnotherapy session, and basically tries to get fired.  He ends up hatching a plan to rip the company off that goes haywire.  Like I said, that is almost ancillary to the real purpose of the movie, which is to poke fun at office life, and the various characters.

The movie has a truly ensemble cast, which was made up of relative unknowns.  They made a pretty big casting coup in landing Jennifer Aniston when Friends was immensely popular.  She really did not dominate the movie though and really fit in well with the ensemble cast.  The two most memorable characters in my opinion were Milton, played by Stephen Root and Lumberg played by Gary Cole.  All the actors did a wonderful job however, even those with the smallest roles.  It really seemed like they were all having fun with it, which along with the well written script (which has tons of quotable lines) really make the movie.

It is really a ""cult classic"" kind of movie.  The brand of humor is probably not for everyone, but it holds up as well or better as any of the more modern day comedies do.  I think anyone who likes any of Judge's other work will find this enjoyable.  There is a lot of swearing in the movie, and in that respect it earns its R rating, but it is really nothing more than you get in any R rated comedy.  As far as extras go on the DVD there is an approximately half hour retrospective that was made in 2005.  There are also about 10 min worth of deleted scenes and the trailer.  Definitely enough to make those who like going through the extras happy.",1389657600,,2258,4.377403846153846

All of us (friends and coworkers) saw it together in the theater when it was released and we all had a great time.
Since then this has really taken off and has become a cult classic!!
Funny, FUNNY film. I don't know why (correction) Mike Judge never did another one... not necessarily a sequel, because more often than not they suck, but another comedy film in this same, unique and honestly funny style?
So many people can relate to how the reality of this film mirrors real life. Then there is the sub-story (Milton) that parallels the main story which is much more surreal.
Funny, and sadly often true.
More than once I have found myself in traffic feeling like I'm in the opening credits of this film, or wanted to smash a difficult piece of hardware.

Before he can be snapped out of it, the hypnotist keels over from a heart attack.  To say the least, Peter only goes in the office when he feels like it and many very funny events arise from this.

There was potential for Office Space to be a great comedy but it just never got off the ground.  The characters never developed and Jennifer Anniston's part was terrible.  Wasn't her fault she was just given a bad script (and other actors)to work with.  I think they just used her name to sell more tickets as this was during her run on Friends.

After the main character (I can't remember his name as there was nothing to remember) gets hypnotized and starts to not care at all about working at Initech it was about to get interesting and then it just fell flat.  The producers could have gone in different directions to make it a good movie and they dropped the ball.

Mike Judge seemed to do the same thing with Beavis and Butthead in his MTV days.  His shows just always seem to lack something and finish way to early with a workable story line that could have ended much better.",1375833600,,976,4.438202247191011

What I mean by that is the comedic moments are eerily similar to real life Corporate America, which makes it even more hilarious.  I know higher-ups in Corporate America must have seen this movie and yet they don't think they are like it.

The cast was great and I will be interested to see where this movies stands 10 years from now in the ranks of comedies (and maybe even documentaries).  Join the discussion on funniest real life moments like TPS reports from ADP.

That said, if you're looking for a great drama or the funniest comedy out there, this is not what you want.  The acting is mediocre and the premise is unrealistic.  But the movie just makes the daily grind not seem so bad.  That's why I gave it 5 stars.

Did you ever feel that if you ran the company it would make sense? This Independent film exposes what we all know. The company you work for must be run by morons.

It is also a great love story without any gratuitous sex or violence. In fact, it doesn't have any. If your child is 14 years-old or older he or she can enjoy it with you. (Some occasional minor profanity) You might as well prepare them now for what they will only learn when he or she enters the work force. Just because someone is their boss does not make them any smarter than anyone else. In fact, it makes you wonder how they ever obtained that position.

This was one of those small-time movies that just popped up out of nowhere and has managed to climb the cult movie ranks.

Based on the comic strip Milton by Mike Judge (creator of Beavis and Butthead) Office Space goes the extra length to take pretty much every stereotype in the book and magnify it to the umpteenth degree. Imagine every weird coworker you've ever encountered...every cubical you've ever worked in...every boss you've wanted to strangle, put them in a company called Initech, and then move them all to The Far Side and you might just have an idea of what this movie is all about.

The main character in the film isn't Milton, however, as the comic strip title would suggest. Instead it's a guy named Peter (played by Ron Livingston). Milton is in the film and adds a really humorous (but also sad) dimension to the movie (there is a certain level of morbid humor throughout). Stephen Root (who up until this movie, had been best known for his character Jimmy James on News Radio) plays Milton and really gave the best performance overall.

There is an underlying plot line, in case you were wondering. The company (Initech) calls for a couple of consultants, known as ""Efficiency Experts"" to come in and do a little--shall we say (with air quotes)--`housecleaning'. As one insane plot builds on another, the Efficiency Experts promote Peter, but fire two of his fellow cubical-mates so they all begin scheming together to find a way to rip off their evil and incredibly patronizing boss, Lumburgh (played by Gary Cole).

When it first came out I loved it and now I use words like genius to describe it. Captures both the cooperate culture and chain restaurant industry so well it's almost scary.

The story follows a group of people working at the lower corporate level a tech firm in the 90's. I just so happened to work for tech firms in the 90's and although all of them weren't like this, the majority were. But as long as you have worked at any business in the corporate office level you will get a kick out of this film. It covers all the normal office politics, annoying office mates, type A personalities, horrible upper management, worker bees and everyone else you will find in this environment.

The main characters are a low lever programmer and his work mates. The main antagonist is of course the boss and his minions but its more a statement of a man exploring his place in life and where he really would like to be. And surprisingly his desire is not to be rich and powerful but just in a position to enjoy life at his own pace.

There is also a peripheral character who works as a waitress at a chain restaurant similar to TGI Friday's or Applebee's. Anyone who has ever worked in the restaurant industry will really appreciate this story line and the truths it reveals through her tormentuous struggle.  Just brilliant!

Also, I have to comment briefly on this version the Bluray, ""with Flair"" edition. Even a film of this calibre benefits from such a beautiful picture. They did a very nice transfer.

I am not one of those people who like the commentary on most of these types of things but Mike Judge and the rest of the cast did a nice modern update for this edition and it was neither too long or self promoting. I really enjoyed it.

And lastly, the deleted scenes were really funny!

The office in the movie could have been filmed at our office! The cubes, the walls, the carpet...exactly the same.

That having been said, this is a hilarious movie that I definitely recommend to everyone. It is generally about an office environment, the horrors of poor management and consultants, and work depression. This movie presents these themes in a humorous way, and as such I know it is used in some actual workplaces to prelude mental health and depression discussions.

However for the rest of us non-office dwellers, it is still a great comedy.

The only real problem I have though with this cult classic is Jennifer Aniston, the film is about office drones being miserable and eventually planning revenge, what did some hackneyed love story have to do with it? Did anyone feel ANYthing for that relationship? It wasn't really funny when they talked together, it didn't really end on a romantically satisfying note, the whole point of that sub-plot seemed to be to market Office Space to the vast number of Friends fans at the time.

I felt rather ragged afterwards. The character of Milton left perhaps the biggest impression on me - he looked and sounded and acted like a Muppet, particularly Beaker. That was a very trying element in this film. I felt like I was watching a strange permutation of James Thurber's The Catbird Seat, told in a backwards way from some unimportant background characters.

The protagonist didn't feel like a protagonist. The only really wonderful piece of acting was that of Mr. Lumberg, whose dry, grueling ""that would be great,"" stole the show. It was grotesque and hilarious.

1047231,5,6305499365,"Mike Judge is a comedic genius. Yes, Idiocracy and Extract, are NO WHERE near as funny, as Office Space, but that's totally ok. Beavis and Butthead and King of the Hill have\had excellent writing and as Judge's first live action feature, Office Space has become one of the top comedies\cult favorites of all time.

ALL of the actors\characters are fantastic, especially, ""Bill Lumbergh"" and Stephen Root's ""Milton"". SO MANY memorable lines and scenes. You just have to watch and enjoy.

And of course, the famous, copier smashing scene.

Ron Livingston plays ""Peter"", a man who is tired of his job. Being constantly, hounded about TPS reports and dealing with his cheating wife, as well as watching his co-worker friends being treated unfairly by his company, Peter decides to come-up with a scheme to leave his job in a BIG way. Along the way, he meets\dates a cute waitress (Jennifer Aniston), who is also having problems at her work of showing ""flair"" to her boss (Mike Judge).

Comedies and humor, really depend on a person. Not everyone is going to laugh at the samething, so if somehow, the humor of Office Space doesn't make you chuckle, that's fine. It's not your kind of comedy.",1335052800,,1187,4.832512315270936

1047313,5,6305499365,"OFFICE SPACE is a film from 1999 believe it or not but it is from the comedy legend Mike Judge.  Written and directed by Judge with wit, realism and spot on observations this film about the everyday work place truly stands the test of time.  It inded deserves the cult following it has acquired and reigns in a class all its own as it satirizes the American worker so perfectly.  The story has a purpose but also provides laughs from beginning to end that often turn into side splitting belly laughs.  The entire cast is excellent with Ron Livingston, Stephen Root and Gary Cole in particular reigning supreme.  Livingston shines and makes the whole story line seem very plausible and helps the viewer care for all the characters.  And it is so much fun to see an early Jennifer Anniston and you will never forget her dealing with her flair after this film.

Blu ray is indeed a magic worker and this film looks excellent on blu ray.  The video is crisp, clear, bright with colors that pop and realistic flesh tones.  Black/white ratio is superb and it is the added clarity that tuly brings this film to a new dimension.  The audio is also excellent.  This is a dialogue driven film and it is always crisp and clear.  When music is present it comes out of the surround speakers pefectly never overshadowing the dialogue.  The entire film comes to new life on blu ray.  If you love this film and own the dvd double dipping for the blu ray is a must.  The viewing experience is truly superior to the dvd.  And if you are an OFFICE SPACE virgin the excellent blu ray at this great price makes it a no brainer.  Its story and humor truly stand the test of time.

1047407,5,6305499365,"1 Blu-ray disc, released February 2009

Some comedy classics stay fresh forever. This one still wins after eleven years.

""Office Space"" is a Mike Judge comedy about the cubicle life. There are so many memorable characters! Lumbergh played by Gary Cole who drags out all his sentences and Milton played by Stephen Root who is the squirrelly guy with management issues and a red Swingline stapler.

It embodies a fantasy of what many office workers feel their life is like and what they would love to do about it working up to the beat down of the fax machine.

Bonus Features:

There is a new trivia track called ""Post-It Pandemonium"" where post-its appear on the screen in random places with facts you probably didn't know or ever need to know necessarily...I thought it would be cool but after a while it gets a little annoying since they cover up faces and other stuff on the screen.

If you like games, this has a bunch. You can play Grab the Stapler, Printer Beat-Down, Whack-a-Drone, and Jump to Conclusions 2.0. The ""Out of the Office"" Office Space Retrospective with Writer/Director Mike Judge allows you to see the animation and voices in the cartoon where Milton and Lumbergh originated. It goes over the casting process of how they found each actor and how that actor interpreted their characters and motivations. There are also eight deleted scenes where Peter is being caught in a lie about his whereabouts, Happy hour at the restaurant where Peter talks about the hypothetical no job scenario, Peter goes off on Nina, Peter grandstanding about life and revelations which doesn't make a lot of sense at that moment in his new carefree zen state, etc. As with almost all deleted scenes, the movie is better without them.",1292025600,5,1732,4.795302013422819

Further, ""Office Space"", despite its outrageous plot, is just close enough to the truth of modern corporate America to hit home. Companies do promote incompetents and lay off their most skilled workers, all in the name of short-term quarterly profits.

His waking life is spent on a mind-numbing job in an office cubicle, reporting to eight bosses.  He has two geeky friends that hope to raise in ranks at Initech, the company they all work for.  Initech wants to downsize and increase profits by sending some jobs overseas, and eliminate others.

Peter has a girlfriend that insists he go to therapy before they marry.  He agrees and is hypnotized at a group therapy session.

However, Peter is reminded that his appointment with efficiency experts is now and he should go.  Because he could care less if he has his job; his leisurely new attitude and total honesty about his work habits, the efficiency experts are impressed.

Office Space is a 1999 American comedy film written and directed by Mike Judge. It satirizes work life in a typical 1990s software company, focusing on a handful of individuals who are fed up with their jobs. The film's sympathetic portrayal of ordinary IT workers garnered it a cult following among those in that profession, but the film also addresses themes familiar to office workers and white collar employees in general. It was filmed in Dallas and Austin, Texas.

Office Space is based on the Milton series of cartoons created by Mike Judge. Office Space was Mike Judge's foray into live action film and his second full length motion picture release (the first being the animated Beavis and Butt-head Do America). The promotional campaign for Office Space often associated it with Beavis and Butt-head, leading audiences to expect the brand of humor of the creator's previous animated efforts rather than the relatively low-key ironic humor of the film.

While not a box office success, the film has become a cult classic; it has since sold very well on VHS and DVD.

Plot
Peter Gibbons is a disgruntled programmer working for Initech, a company plagued by excessive management. Peter spends his days ""staring at his desk"" instead of reprogramming bank software for the then-expected Y2K disaster. His co-workers include highly strung Samir Nagheenanajar, who is annoyed by the fact that nobody can pronounce his last name correctly; Michael Bolton, who detests having the same name as the famous singer, whom he hates; and Milton Waddams, a meek, fixated collator who constantly mumbles to himself (most notably about his workmates borrowing his favorite red Swingline stapler). All four are repeatedly bullied and harassed by management, especially Initech's callous vice president, Bill Lumbergh. The staff are further agitated by the arrival of two consultants, informally known as ""The Bobs,"" since they share the same first name, who are brought in to help with cutting expenses, mainly through downsizing.

Peter is depressed, bored, and pushed around at work. He attends an occupational hypnotherapy session urged upon him by his girlfriend Anne. The obese occupational hypnotherapist, Dr. Swanson, suddenly dies of a heart attack before he can snap Peter out of a state of complete relaxation. The newly relaxed and still half-hypnotized Peter wakes up the next morning and ignores continued calls from Anne (who confesses to cheating and leaves him) and Lumbergh (who was expecting Peter to work over the weekend). Peter announces that he will simply not go to work anymore, instead pursuing his lifelong dream of ""doing nothing,"" and asks out Joanna, a waitress who shares Peter's loathing of idiotic management and love of the television program Kung Fu. Joanna works at Chotchkie's, a restaurant that plays on TGI Friday's interior decoration and uniform standards (Joanna's hatred for her occupation eventually culminates in an argument with her boss and her being fired after she gives him the finger).

Peter then begins removing items at work that exemplify his unhappiness (inspirational banners, a wall of his cubicle that blocks his view, and a printer that is prone to constant errors) and takes Lumbergh's parking spot. Despite Peter's poor attendance record, laziness and insubordination at work, he is promoted by the Bobs because of the positive impression he leaves upon them with his earnestness. Meanwhile, Michael and Samir are fired, seemingly a symptom of the disposability with which the consultants view most Initech employees. To exact revenge on Initech, the three friends decide to infect the accounting system with a computer virus, designed to divert fractions of pennies into a bank account they control. A misplaced decimal point causes the virus to steal over $300,000 in the first few days, a far more conspicuous loss to Initech. After a crisis of conscience and an argument with Joanna, Peter writes a letter in which he takes all the blame for the crime, then slips an envelope containing the letter and the money (in unsigned traveler's checks) under the door of Lumbergh's office late one night.

He fully expects to be arrested the next morning, but his problem solves itself: Milton, after getting his stapler taken away by Lumbergh, being increasingly ignored, having to move to the cockroach-infested basement, and not receiving any more paychecks, finally snaps and sets fire to the Initech office building, having warned several times throughout the film that he would do so (Milton had actually been laid off years earlier; nobody told him, and he continued to come in to work and get paid due to a system glitch). Peter finally finds a job that he likes: doing construction work with his next door neighbor, Lawrence. Samir and Michael get jobs at Intertrode, a rival company. While helping haul away the rubble from the fire, Peter finds Milton's stapler and keeps it, saying ""I think I know someone who might want this"".

The last scene of the movie shows that Milton has made his way to a resort in Mexico with the money Peter left in Lumbergh's office.

Production
Filmed primarily in Austin, Texas, the origins for Office Space lie in a series of four animated short films about an office drone named Milton that Mike Judge created, which first aired on Liquid Television and Night After Night with Allan Havey, and later aired on Saturday Night Live. The inspiration came from a temp job he once had that involved alphabetizing purchase orders and a job he had as an engineer for three months in the Bay Area during the 1980s, ""just in the heart of Silicon Valley and in the middle of that overachiever yuppie thing, it was just awful"". The setting of the film reflected a prevailing trend that Judge observed in the United States. ""It seems like every city now has these identical office parks with identical adjoining chain restaurants"", he said in an interview. He remembers, ""There were a lot of people who wanted me to set this movie in Wall Street, or like the movie Brazil, but I wanted it very unglamorous, the kind of bleak work situation like I was in"".

Judge sold the film to 20th Century Fox based on his script and a cast that included Jennifer Aniston, Ron Livingston, and David Herman. Originally, the studio wanted to make a movie out of the Milton character but Judge was not interested, opting instead to make more of an ensemble cast-based film. The studio suggested he make a movie like Car Wash but ""just set in an office"". Judge made the relatively painless transition from animation to live-action with the help of the film's director of photography who taught him about lenses and where to put the camera. Judge says, ""I had a great crew, and it's good going into it not pretending you're an expert"". Studio executives were not happy with the footage Judge was getting. He remembers them telling him, ""More energy! More energy! We gotta reshoot it! You're failing! You're failing!"" In addition, Fox did not like the gangsta rap music used in the film until a focus group approved of it. Judge hated the ending and felt that a complete rewrite of the third act was necessary.

Judge also hated the poster that the studio created for Office Space. He said, ""People were like, 'What is this? A big bird? A mummy? A beekeeper?' And the tagline 'Work Sucks'? It looked like an Office Depot ad. I just hated it. I hated the trailers, too and the TV ads especially"". Fox Filmed Entertainment chairman Tom Rothman conceded that the marketing campaign did not work and said, ""Office Space isn't like American Pie. It doesn't have the kind of jokes you put in a 15-second television spot of somebody getting hit on the head with a frying pan. It's sly. And let me tell you, sly is hard to sell"".

[edit] Reception
Office Space was released on February 19, 1999 in 1,740 theatres, grossing USD $4.2 million on its opening weekend. It went on to make $10.8 million in North America, barely recouping its production costs. On the Monday after the opening weekend, Judge received a phone call from Jim Carrey's agent. The comedian loved the film and wanted to meet him. Chris Rock called two weeks later.

The film received mixed to positive reviews with a 79% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and 68 metascore on Metacritic. In his review in the New York Times, Stephen Holden wrote, ""It has the loose-jointed feel of a bunch of sketches packed together into a narrative that doesn't gather much momentum"". Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and wrote that Judge, ""treats his characters a little like cartoon creatures. That works. Nuances of behavior are not necessary, because in the cubicle world every personality trait is magnified, and the captives stagger forth like grotesques"". In his review for the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle writes, ""Livingston is nicely cast as Peter, a young guy whose imagination and capacity for happiness are the very things making him miserable"". In the USA Today, Susan Wloszczyna wrote, ""If you've ever had a job, you'll be amused by this paean to peons"".

However, Owen Gleiberman in Entertainment Weekly gave the film a ""C"" rating and criticized it for feeling ""cramped and underimagined"". In his review for the Globe and Mail, Rick Groen wrote, ""Perhaps his TV background makes him unaccustomed to the demands of a feature-length script (the ending seems almost panicky in its abruptness); or maybe he just succumbs to the lure of the easy yuk . . . what began as discomfiting satire soon devolves into silly farce"".

In 2008, Entertainment Weekly named Office Space one of the ""The 100 best films from 1983 to 2008"", ranking it at #73.

[edit] Legacy
Office Space has become a cult classic, selling very well on home video. As of 2003, it had sold 2.6 million copies on VHS and DVD. In the same year, it was in the top 20 best-selling Fox DVDs along with There's Something About Mary. The movie is also available on Blu-ray.

Comedy Central premiered Office Space on August 5, 2001 and 1.4 million viewers tuned in. By 2003, the channel had broadcast the film another 33 times. These broadcasts helped develop the film's cult following and Ron Livingston remembers being approached by college students and office workers. He said, ""I get a lot of people who say, 'I quit my job because of you.' That's kind of a heavy load to carry"". People approached Stephen Root asking him to sign their staplers. The Red Swingline stapler featured prominently in the film was not available until April 2002 when the company released it in response to repeated requests by fans of Office Space. Entertainment Weekly ranked it fifth on its list ""25 Great Comedies From the Past 25 Years"", despite having originally given the film a poor review. On February 8, 2009, a reunion of the cast took place at the Paramount Theatre in Austin to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the movie, which included the destruction of a fax machine on the sidewalk.

He is extremely funny as a somewhat pathetic and alienated office worker (computer programmer) who is used and abused by the computer software company he works for as is his two friends.

After a botches hypnosis session that is supposed to make Peter content with his life as a computer programmer but instead emboldens him to live his life completely disregarding any consequences regarding his work (like fishing instead of working, sleeping in until 11:00 am then showing up for work for a few hours and then leaving), ""consultants"" advise him that his two buddies, fellow programmers Michael Botton (David Herman) and Samir (Ajay Naidu), two of the best programmers and most senior employees will be fired to save money by outsourcing their programming to India. Peter convinces his two friends help him defraud the company they work for at the rate of few pennies a day using a computer virus designed by David so that after several years they will have a tidy nest egg in savings.

Peter, thanks to the hypnosis session, finds the boldness he previously lacked and begins dating Joanna (Jennifer Aniston); quickly they fall in love. Unfortunately, his romance is interrupted when he checks how Michael's virus is working. In one day, the computer program that should have collected a couple pennies collects over a $100,000.

Faced with certain discovery, Peter's friendship with Samir and Michael as well as his romance with Joanna are shattered, and Peter plans to turn himself in while taking all the blame for the crime so that his friends will remain free.

While on the way to the police and jail, Peter notices a fire (set by a different disgruntled employee) that burns down the computer company he works for, thus destroying all the incriminating accounting documents that might trace him to the crime; BTW, the money is also destroyed by the fire.

This intended act of self-sacrifice regains the friendship of Samir and Michael, as well as the respect of Joanna. Thus, Peter is saved from jail, is reunited with his love, and regains the friendship of his two closest friends.

There's a lot of the same bitter surreality infused in this hysterically funny office film by Mike Judge (of ""Beavis & Butthead"" fame), all about three rebellious office employees who have finally had enough. Filled with quirky characters and a hilarious employee rebellion, this is a movie for anyone who ever felt trapped in a soul-destroying job. Which is just about everybody.

Peter (Ron Livingston) spends every day in a cubicle, doing pointless work under the thumb of his smarmy boss Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole). His life is boring, and he doesn't even have the confidence to tell a waitress (Jennifer Aniston) that he likes her.

Because layoffs are impending, Peter accompanies his controlling girlfriend to a hypnosis session, and is instructed to relax. Unfortunately, the hypnotist dies of a heart attack... while Peter is still under his hypnotic influence. And nobody snaps him out of it. The next morning, Peter wakes up happy and laid-back -- and determined to get out of his rotten job, and live fat and happy.

He conspires with fiery Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and the ill-named Michael Bolton (David Herman) -- two coworkers who are about to be axed -- to skim money off the company's assets with a secret computer virus. Only problem is, their scene is rapidly spinning out of control when the virus goes glitchy haywire -- and their scheme is threatened with exposure.

""Office Space"" started off as an early 90s animated skit, featuring the character of Milton. You know, that increasingly deranged employee who complains that ""you took my stapler."" This time, Milton is a minor character, although a pivotal one. The focus is mainly on the mellowed-out Peter and his wild scheme to profit the downtrodden employees of Initech -- sort of like a crazier version of ""The Office.""

And Judge knows how to wring all the bitter comedy from this scenario. He creates a hysterical tangle of cubicle workers, layoffs and the most annoying boss in the history of film (""Yeeeeeeaaaahhhh... uhhhhhhh...""). There's a less interesting subplot about Peter's unstable relationship with the equally POed-about-her-job waitress, but the real draw here is all the corporate cheating and craziness.

This brand of humor is twisted, down to the slow-motion, ghetto-style beating of the copier in the middle of a field, and Peter receiving a raise because he no longer cares if he gets fired. And of course, the dialogue is quietly insane (""Oh, and next Friday... is Hawaiian shirt day..."") as the plot grows grows more and more tense... until you know someone has to snap. You can see who it is way in advance, but it's no less hilarious when it happens -- with disastrous consequences.

The trio of lead characters are a riot -- there's Peter, whose newfound perspective about what is important in life is immensely entertaining. There's Samir, who can barely restrain his simmering rage at his rotten job, or his deep hatred for the copier. And there's Michael, who has a seething resentment that he has the same name as THAT sappy singer. As for Cole, he's utterly brilliant as a boss who is as endearing and appealing as a rake on a chalkboard.

""Office Space"" has become something of a deserving cult classic -- funny, strange, and sympathetic to the ants that toil in their cubicles. When you aren't laughing your butt off, you'll be cheering on the disgruntled salami-slicers.",1249084800,,3486,4.965694682675815

Decades from now, this film will be remembered as a symbol of late 20th-century life, and of our general willingness to sell out. As a cubicle slave myself, I'm not sure whether to be disgusted or amused. Certainly I am not proud of this life.",1235433600,4,735,4.682170542635659

This movie is about a guy who hates work so much and does something about it. He just quits going. No worries or cares in the world. His friends, however, are still busting their butt to keep their jobs during ""house clean up"", while trying to get him to be more motivated during these times.

I'm sure you've all seen Office Space anyway, so you know the comedy is terrific, the cast has great chemistry, and Milton is missing pay checks. Now onto the difference between Blu-Ray and DVD, since this is a review for the Blu-Ray edition of the film.

I'd say two years ago, when I bought a PS3 and a few Blu-rays, I never thought I'd buy an older comedy. I made a rule I'd only buy action-type movies on Blu-ray. Comedy can stay on DVD. This film really is one of the best examples of a good transfer. The picture is really, really clear. You can see so much more detail in the little things, that help you feel like you're at work (ugh) with the guys.

The setting for Office Space is an Information Technology company that processes transactions for Credit Unions, with a collection of employees that are all either bored, angry, aloof, incompetent, anxious or suffer from one of a hundred other maladies or neurotic manifestations.  No doubt this sort of work environment will be familiar to most.

It would be convenient to say that this is just another movie about how the corporate work environment drains us of our humanity, but Office Space offers us much more. The mindless bureaucracy, doing work solely to satisfy some inane process (PTS Reports), the sense of detachment from reality is eerily reminiscent of a Kafka novel.  Lundberg, the boss, who is completely unaware of what his employees do and how they feel, endlessly repeats his mantra of ok, ok , while his employees become more and more stressed and unfulfilled.

Peter, the lead character, undergoes a profound Peter Pan like psychological transformation after which he is no longer motivated to do his job.  He comes and goes as he pleases and begins to openly express his true feelings about the job and the environment.  His new relaxed attitude impresses the clueless consultants, with their prepackaged prescription for transforming the organization (i.e. reducing headcount), who have been brought in to fine tune the organization.

Naturally, no story of this genre would be complete without a love connection between the main character and yet another troubled, trapped soul.  Peter's love interest comes by way of a waitress at a nearby restaurant who fights conformity by wearing only the minimum pieces of flair on her uniform.  She endures the endless questioning from her manager about why she wears only the minimum pieces of flair, when she is so clearly and simply trying to preserve some part of her humanity.

The dam of self-control that held the employees in check finally begins to crack when Peter and two of his co-workers hatch a plot of revenge against the company.  Of course their plot like everything else goes badly wrong, but in the end it seems that justice is served.

You will laugh out loud, you may cry at times, but if this dark comedy does not send your mind and heart in search of your humanity, sadly you have missed the point.",1226880000,2,2481,4.949397590361446

Although many recent college graduates dream of working in a corporate job with their own corner desk and a front row parking place, that fantasy is not always realized. Instead, many are thrown into a life of dull, repetitive work, and made to work in a cubicle with no windows. Mike Judge satirizes this mediocre life in his movie Office Space, the story of Peter Gibbons, a man so bored with his day to day routine that he finally snaps. In this parody of ""Corporate America,"" Judge earns laughs with witty dialogue, but also breaches a deeper meaning through his uncannily realistic view of work in a dysfunctional company. I really enjoy this movie, not only because of the comedic aspects like the extreme characters and sarcastic banter, but also because of its relevance to the modern workplace.
 Generally, critics love Office Space as much as its cult followers. However, there are some movie critics that disagree. Rick Groen claims that the writer and director, Mike Judge, cannot follow through to the end of the feature length film because of his background primarily in short TV cartoons. Instead, Groen sees the film as starting off strong, but losing steam towards the end. But overwhelmingly, reviewers of the movie praise the ""good-natured comedy about the suppressed rage and paranoia of unappreciated employees"" (Elias). Although professional critics see the movie as cunning, witty, and uproarious, Office Space did not generate a large crowd at the theaters (Box Office Mojo), and even a smaller fan base. I like to think that I am a part of the cult culture surrounding the movie, much like the groups that are so fanatic about movies like Fight Club or Donnie Darko.
  The issues brought up in Office Space still apply to many people, even though there is a relatively small fan base. Contrary to the movie Clockwatchers, in which jokes about an office environment quickly go away, ""revealing a surprising, almost surreal core of unhappiness and mistrust among its central characters,"" all of the serious issues brought up in Office Space are hidden subtly behind parody and satire (Davis). Of course, most Americans' lives are not quite as dull as Peter Gibbon's, since the movie Office Space is a parody of corporate culture in America. Not only does Peter Gibbons have a dull and repetitive job--updating bank software for ""the 2000 switch""--but he is also stuck in a cubicle, depriving him of all natural light. Just to the other side of his cubicle wall is a huge window, with a great view of a tree and some rolling hills. In one scene, after Peter snaps, he unscrews the outside wall of the cubicle and knocks it down, letting all the papers and memos fall everywhere. Aside from his cramped and unnatural workplace, Peter is under several middle-management level executives who all seem to have overlapping responsibilities. Each one stops by to remind Peter that he failed to put a cover sheet on his TPS report. The vice president of the company where Peter works, Initech, is Bill Lumbergh, represents the stereotype of corporate bosses and the antagonist of the movie. Lumbergh repeatedly asks his employees to come into work on Saturdays while he roams around the office aimlessly with a cup of coffee, instead of actively managing his employees.
 Perhaps Office Space pokes the most fun at the way companies hire ""efficiency consultants"" to help with productivity, but in the process of streamlining the consultants completely halt all work. The two consultants hired by Initech in the movie are known as ""The Bobs"" and meet Peter after his snap. In this sudden change, Peter takes on an attitude of complete apathy after his therapist suffers a heart attack in the midst of hypnotization, leaving Peter in an unrealistic state of deep relaxation. Ironically, The Bobs are completely taken with Peter, even after he openly admits that he really ""does nothing"" all day. Other employees in the company do much more work, like Peter's friends Michael and Samir, but they are fired for reasons clear only to the consultants. Instead of keeping workers that are efficient, The Bobs keep Peter, who is disrespectful to his boss and plays Tetris all day.  These kinds of consultants are a parody of the type of corporate planning and strategizing that became so popular in the 1990s. Lumbergh, the VP of Initech, is also seen in front of a whiteboard reading ""Planning to Plan,"" another stab at new ideas and attempts to streamline corporate offices that really defeat their own purpose.
  One of the most praised aspects of the movie is its larger than life characters. Because of his background in animation, Mike Judge exaggerates the characters' personalities so that ""every personality trait is magnified"" (Ebert). Characters like Bill Lumbergh, written to be the stereotype of a corporate boss in the 1990s, wears ""gold-rimmed aviator glasses, a ski-resort tan and a contrasting-collar dress shirt,"" and Tom, a 50ish functionary who lives in constant -- and justified -- terror of being downsized,"" are played out to the extreme by the actors. Peter's two friends, Michael Bolton, who resents the famous singer with his same name, and Samir Nagheenanajar, whose last name no one can pronounce, both dislike their jobs, but appreciate the security. After they are both fired, they take out their anger at the company by taking their misbehaving copy machine to an empty field and destroy it with baseball bats. The most animated character and my personal favorite is Milton, an employee who was ""let go"" years ago, but through a glitch in the payroll continues to be paid every week. Instead of deciding to take on a lifestyle of apathy, like Peter, Milton combats the stresses of corporate life by being overly protective of his possessions, especially his stapler.
 Not only does the movie Office Space poke fun at corporate businesses, but it also satirizes the mediocre lives of the people that work in those jobs. Mike Judge expresses the impatience of many Americans through his subtle and witty humor in a satire about life in Corporate America. Everyone who has worked in an office can pick out at least a few foibles from some of the extreme characters that remind them of past or present coworkers. The issues brought up comically in the movie resonate with its audience long after the final credits.

1047627,5,6305499365,"If they ever decided to make a live-action ""Dilbert"" movie, it might resemble ""Office Space.""

There's a lot of the same bitter surreality infused in this hysterically funny office film by Mike Judge (of ""Beavis & Butthead"" fame), all about three rebellious office employees who have finally had enough. Filled with quirky characters and a hilarious employee rebellion, this is a movie for anyone who ever felt trapped in a soul-destroying job. Which is just about everybody.

Peter (Ron Livingston) spends every day in a cubicle, doing pointless work under the thumb of his smarmy boss Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole). His life is boring, and he doesn't even have the confidence to tell a waitress (Jennifer Aniston) that he likes her.

Because layoffs are impending, Peter accompanies his controlling girlfriend to a hypnosis session, and is instructed to relax. Unfortunately, the hypnotist dies of a heart attack... while Peter is still under his hypnotic influence. And nobody snaps him out of it. The next morning, Peter wakes up happy and laid-back -- and determined to get out of his rotten job, and live fat and happy.

He conspires with fiery Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and the ill-named Michael Bolton (David Herman) -- two coworkers who are about to be axed -- to skim money off the company's assets with a secret computer virus. Only problem is, their scene is rapidly spinning out of control when the virus goes glitchy haywire -- and their scheme is threatened with exposure.

""Office Space"" started off as an early 90s animated skit, featuring the character of Milton. You know, that increasingly deranged employee who complains that ""you took my stapler."" This time, Milton is a minor character, although a pivotal one. The focus is mainly on the mellowed-out Peter and his wild scheme to profit the downtrodden employees of Initech -- sort of like a crazier version of ""The Office.""

And Judge knows how to wring all the bitter comedy from this scenario. He creates a hysterical tangle of cubicle workers, layoffs and the most annoying boss in the history of film (""Yeeeeeeaaaahhhh... uhhhhhhh...""). There's a less interesting subplot about Peter's unstable relationship with the equally POed-about-her-job waitress, but the real draw here is all the corporate cheating and craziness.

This brand of humor is twisted, down to the slow-motion, ghetto-style beating of the copier in the middle of a field, and Peter receiving a raise because he no longer cares if he gets fired. And of course, the dialogue is quietly insane (""Oh, and next Friday... is Hawaiian shirt day..."") as the plot grows grows more and more tense... until you know someone has to snap. You can see who it is way in advance, but it's no less hilarious when it happens -- with disastrous consequences.

The trio of lead characters are a riot -- there's Peter, whose newfound perspective about what is important in life is immensely entertaining. There's Samir, who can barely restrain his simmering rage at his rotten job, or his deep hatred for the copier. And there's Michael, who has a seething resentment that he has the same name as THAT sappy singer. As for Cole, he's utterly brilliant as a boss who is as endearing and appealing as a rake on a chalkboard.

This edition is apparently just a blu-ray edition of the previously-released ""with flair!"" edition, so those who already have it might want to wait for something a bit more deluxe. Some brilliant deleted scenes, interactive games like ""Whack-A-Drone,"" and a featurette with Mike Judge called ""Out of the Office.""

""Office Space"" has become something of a deserving cult classic -- funny, strange, and sympathetic to the ants that toil in their cubicles. When you aren't laughing your butt off, you'll be cheering on the disgruntled salami-slicers.",1225756800,3,3800,4.9984177215189876

1047661,4,6305499365,"1999's ""Office Space"" has become something of a cult classic, with office workers everywhere able to recite their favorite lines from this spot-on comedy.  Ron Livingston stars as Peter, a computer software worker locked into a dreary cubical existance, suffering a condescending and exploitative boss and a meaningless life away from the job.

Desperate for a change, Peter tries hypnotherapy.  When the session goes awry, Peter is left locked into a relaxed mode that allows him to cheerfully skip work, chase the girl of his dreams, and subvert the routine of his office.  A consulting team brought in to downside the company becomes the trigger for a fraud scheme hatched by Peter and two disgruntled office mates.  They spring the scheme, only to suffer an attack of conscience (and a fear of jail).  Their ham-handed  attempts to fix things lead to a fateful decision by Peter.

The comedy of ""Office Space"" is in the knowing details, such as Peter's wearisome commute, in which the other lane always moves faster; the office gnome, laid off five years ago but still shuttling from desk to desk because no one told him; and a perpetually malfunctioning printer.  Jennifer Anniston has a nice role as Peter's spunky new girlfriend, while Gary Cole is superbly hateful as Peter's unctious boss.

The irony is the employee worried about where his office moves and stapler will end up is the one that truly gets even with the boss and company in one fell swoop.

Last week I was reminiscing with an engineer friend about seeing ""Office Space"" during its 1999 theatrical run.  He remembers me laughing constantly throughout the movie, and that flashback to a simpler time in my IT career caused me to finally get this DVD just so I could see it again and check out the extras.  Of course, ""Office Space"" is still awesome, but unfortunately the included ""flair"" is little more than the bare minimum.

""Office Space"" centers on Peter Gibbons, a twenty-something programmer entombed at Initech working on the Y2K software update project (the only dated aspect of the film, but it could represent any office work scenario).  He's fed up with his mindless job, the lousy commute, uptight girlfriend Anne, and especially passive-aggressive boss Bill Lumbergh.  Cohorts in programming Michael and Samir have similar workplace issues, and all three commiserate while trapped in their cubes or over mid-morning coffee at T.G.I. Friday's clone Chotchkie's.

One night, at the insistence of said girlfriend Peter sees a hypnotherapist to try and work through his malaise.  Things don't go quite as planned, and Peter emerges in a Zen-like state that enables him to step out and act without fear of failure, or really any fear at all.  Our hero quickly gets dumped by Anne, but winds up snagging a promotion and dating Joanna, the Chotchkie's waitress he had pined for from afar.  However, just as his Peter 2.0 life is going great he resolves to get back at Initech for its indignities, and that's when events begin to spin out of control.  To say much more would spoil the fun, but trust me when I apply the ""comedy classic"" label.

All the actors from main roles to supporting players do a great job, and the jarring gangsta rap soundtrack fits like a pocket protector (after all, don't most of us want to bust out of our bland shells and live the glamorous thug life once in awhile?).  Case in point: Over time this flick spread through the corporate underbelly like a computer virus, and  it's hard to find any cubicle farm where the drones aren't tossing around lines such as: ""Yyyyeahhh...not a half-day...did you get that memo?...someone's got a case of the Mondays...I wouldn't say I've been MISSING work...""  ""Office Space"" captures the white-collar world in all its soul-crushing splendor, from incompetent management and inane company rules to office politics and oddball co-workers.  Indeed, we can count both ""The Office"" television series as its demented twin progeny.

As for the extras?  Wwwweeellll, there aren't many buttons in this jar.  The ones included aren't bad, but I wanted more than a short retrospective hosted by creator/director Mike Judge, some deleted scenes, the theatrical trailer, and media for your PC.

Thanks to the only partially intentional assistance from a therapist using hypnosis in the single funniest scene in the film, Peter relaxes and reaps the rewards of sloth. The films makes a legitimate point about promotion up the corporate ladder in the most humorous manner possible.

The characters in the film are all caricatures of idealized cubicle dwellers, and remind me of a cross between ""Dilbert"" and the cast of ""The Office."" The film is well acted, and you will see favorite actors from several favorite sitcoms: John C. McGinley from ""Scrubs"" is brilliant as Bob the consultant; Diedrich Bader from ""The Drew Carey Show"" is brilliant as a blue collar neighbor, and Jennifer Aniston shines as Joanna, a waitress with flair!

The film deserves five stars save for one misstep in postproduction: the soundtrack. The soundtrack is filled with extremely violent rap music, which not only fails to enhance the film, it actually detracts markedly from it.

The movie starts off with Peter on his way to work. He is in slow moving traffic, which in turn causes him to be late. While he is in traffic the camera goes to the right of him and shows an elderly gentleman with a walker walking faster than the vehicles are moving. This is one of the many funny things that stand out. Make sure to keep an eye out for Milton. He plays sort of a hero to the main character Peter and the rest of his co-workers.

Peter (Ron Livingston) gets stuck in traffic, gets told he didn't file his TPS reports correctly by 3 different bosses, and gets hassled by the boss of his office; Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole). Faced with massive job cuts, the workers of Inotech are on edge. Even the copy machine stops working. Sadly the copy machine meets its demise in Michael Bolton (David Herman).

After going to a therapist with his girlfriend, Peter takes a deep breath, and simply doesn't care anymore. He sleeps till noon and walks in late on a daily basis. Peter, Michael Bolton, and Samir voice their anger, complaints and hassles from their job during lunch. While at lunch he meets the lovely Jennifer Anniston at a TGIF type of restaurant during his lunch break. The company hires the 2 Bobs which weed out the dead wood within the office. Many are let go. Bob Slydell (John C. McGinley) comes upon Peter's file and meet with him. Peter tells it like it is even without thinking he could be fired. The Bobs love him and even tell Lumbergh to promote him.

All in all Peter, Michael Bolton, and Samir, who all are fed up with the company, cook up a scheme to embezzle company funds and pocket it; to get even. Will they have the last word? Will there scheme work?

1047742,5,6305499365,"In my circle of friends there is no film quoted, referenced or talked about as much as `Office Space'.  It is the collective favorite; the one film we can all agree on to have entertained us in every way possible.  Not a week goes by that this film is not mentioned among us and not once do we pass up an opportunity to watch this movie, even if only in part.  For instance, this film has been in rotation on Comedy Central for the past few months and in those past few months my best friend and I have watched this movie, in whole or in part, at least twelve times.

Why?

It's that good.

`Office Space' is truly one of the richest comedies I've ever seen.  From the very start to the very end it delivers laugh after laugh, each as genuine as the one preceding.  That I think is the kicker.  Each joke, each gag, each laugh is just as purely entertaining as the last one, none of them fall south or feeling forced.  Each scenario is so real and so relatable that it all becomes all the more hilarious because we feel as though we've been here before.  Who hasn't had the condescending and overbearing boss who just can't seem to take a hint?  Who hasn't had the obsessive compulsive co-working who can't seem to get out of your way?  Who hasn't had that one pesky piece of office equipment that just won't seem to work right?  Who hasn't had that overachieving co-working that just won't seem to get out from under your skin?

The point is that `Office Space' could be re-titled `Your Life' in the essence that it is so real and down to earth.  Sure, parts are exaggerated, but are they really?

The story revolves around Peter Gibbons, a man who loathes his little cubicle of an office space at his horror show of a job and only wants to be free of the responsibilities of adulthood.  His girlfriend is obviously cheating on him and wants for him to grow up.  His friends all hate their jobs as much as he does but like Peter are too chicken to take any action about it.  This is all until Bob Slydell is hired to evaluate who is really pulling their weight within the company and start making some cut-backs.  This all happens just about the time that Peter is hypnotized and placed under a spell of serenity.  While his friends Samir and Michael are fretting over losing their job Peter is slacking off, showing up late (if at all) and doing his best to upset his boss Mr. Lumbergh.  Then the three friends concoct a plan to end their worrying forever, but of course it's going to backfire.

Ron Livingston is brilliantly cast as Peter.  His laid back portrayal of Peter is marvelous.  Ajay Naidu does wonderful things with Samir, but it's David Herman that steals this entire film with his neurotic and aggressive portrayal of Michael Bolton (yup, you heard me right).  Supporting parts played by Jennifer Aniston, Diedrich Bader and Gary Cole are sure to entertain and leave an impression and of course Stephen Roots portrayal of Milton is sure to elicit plenty of laughs.

What is really great about `Office Space' is that it's not just out there to bash corporate America but in actuality it attacks the work environment in general.  Sure Peter and his corporate business woes are prominent here but we are introduced to Joanna, Peters love interest, and her struggle with her waitressing job at Chotchkie's, a restaurant chain in the vein of TGI Fridays.  As she battles with her boss obsessed with `flair' and being compared to her co-worker obsessed with kissing up and being teachers-pet so-to-speak we see the ugly side of the workplace from a whole different perspective.  It's such a well rounded comedy that you can't help but appreciate the irony.

I can't think of enough good things to say about this hilarious satire.  All I can say is see this movie again and again for optimum enjoyment and laugh your butt off.  You deserve it.  You work all week long and have little to show for it.  It's about time you embrace your own misery and find all the humor there is to find in your puppet dance for the man.",1201219200,,4027,4.483516483516484

There are probably better examples of the , ""I hate my job"", movie out there to be enjoyed. Take some time out of your boring day at work and find `em.

My wife got this for me because my job currently sucks BIG TIME so I got a vicarious thrill out of the conclusion. Even with that haze of sarcasm blurring my vision I must admit that the characters left me not really caring for ANY of them. They are rather cartoonish. Sorry Mike Judge, stick with the animation. It suits you better. The perplexing part of the plot is the main character's dream is to not have work, yet he keeps showing up there!!! It kind of makes you think this guy REALLY doesn't have a life beyond his dreary job. In other words, why would we care for a ""hero"" who is this much of a loser?!?!? This is where, for even the vicarious viewer, it gets stupid. If you hate your job, and don't want to go- (and the plot line says our man is hypnotized to be free of any employment worries)- why the heck do you keep coming back to this mundane garbage hole of place?!?!? I just want to smack this shmoe and tell him to actually start looking for a life.

If you really want the deeper meaning to this movie it's that in so many businesses it tanks. America won't be beaten from other countries' ingenuity but rather its own internal stupidity. If you give people their freedom and independence they cling to the safe, secure and complacent places they feel comfortable existing. Outwardly they revel in their fantasy of being cowboys roaming the range; tough-minded mavericks who can take on any challenge. But really, where is the true independent, self-reliant, rebel in this movie, (or today's world)? If this guy was from the America of old, he would have blazed new trails, explored new things or at least set an example of living his OWN life. Instead he haunts the boring existence he wishes to be free of!  Go figure?!?!?!? We are left with a movie that shows how many people are reflected: scared, child-like and needing a paternal figure to guide their lives. But, I diverse.

Have you been downsized? You'll love Office Space for its brilliant take on consultants. Have you lived in Dallas, Texas, the capital city of Generica?

The director, Mike Judge, came from TV, and it has a TV feel to it, as opposed to a cinematic feel.  The film doesn't flow at all.  The scenes go awkardly from one to the next.  However, there are some priceless moments (the conversation about ""flair"", Ron Livingston's great line about work (ain't exactly missing it), the destruction of the copy machine), but all these moments are actually in the trailer.  A lot of times between gags the film seems to be killing time, and the film ends up being very boring.  Some might argue that office work is boring (it is), but still, a realistic portrayal doesn't always translate into great filmmaking.  The performances here are first rate, with the underrated Gary Cole giving a hilarious one as Ron Livingston's boss.  Livingston himself makes a great sad sack and Jennifer Aniston is nice as the waitress who is Ron's love interest.  It's not the deepest romance ever, but it passes the time.

1047796,4,6305499365,"As long as corporate America insists on treating people like farm animals or widgits, Office Space is going to hit home on several levels: It is a wickedly funny parody of life as a Cube Farm inhabitant; it is dead-on in all the silly and ultimately pointless exercises that upper management goes through to justify itself; and it caters to every worker's fantasy of some day Stickin' it to The Man.

There are numerous weirdly comical moments, as when the lead character, Peter Gibbons, is reclaiming his life and his sanity at the office while a rap song about ""it's good to be a gangster"" booms in the background; and the hysterical juxtaposition of white, straight-arrow geek programmer Michael Bolton swaying in his car to some truly off-color rap lyrics. The mumbling, goggle-eyed character Milton Waddams (EVERY office has one, you know it does) almost steals the whole show with his obsessiveness about his red Swingline stapler.

I have worked with many of the characters in this movie, and only wish that, like Peter, I had recognized far earlier in my ""career"" that people are not meant to live in fabric-lined enclosures and fret over things like mission statements and TPS reports.

Although the movie is a bit dated now in terms of how people dress, etc., and the rap songs in the soundtrack might be offensive to some, Office Space is a movie you will want to watch several times, so you can absorb all of the lessons it has to offer.",1187740800,,1449,4.719367588932807
1047797,3,6305499365,"Based on the enthusiastic reviews from my co-workers, I had high expectations for this movie. And sure enough, the movie started off pretty well, highlighting the petty nonsense that makes office work wretched: daily traffic jams, cutesy co-workers, malfunctioning machines, smarmy bosses and pointless work. And many of the film's catch phrases have made it into office usage -- the infamous ""TPS"" report and ""'Sounds like someone has a case of the Mondays!""

The film deals with Peter Gibbons, a young programmer who hates his big corporate job. At the instigation of his overbearing girlfriend, he attends a hypnosis session that ends prematurely, leaving him in a blissful state of nonchalance. At work the next day, Gibbons blithely ignores all rules of office and social etiquette. He arrives in casual clothing, plays Tetris all day, removes his cubical walls and asks a cute waitress out to lunch. His newfound lack of caring is perceived as freshness and candor by a couple of efficiency experts bent on reducing headcount.

Yet at this point, halfway through the movie, ""Office Space"" lost its charm and gains lots of loosely-connected subplots. The hypnosis gimmick that drove the first half is suddenly and inexplicably dropped. The film morphs into comic romance between Gibbons and a waitress played by Jennifer Aniston. Gibbons and a couple of coworkers hatch a harebrained scam to revenge themselves on the company, and that threatens to land them all in the pokey. Aniston argues with her boss, a restaurant manager who expects his staff to be perpetually peppy, with lots of ""flair"" decorating their uniforms. All of this activity adds up to very little in the end.

For its hits and magic moments, ""Office Space"" had plenty of misses. Richard Riehle's ""Tom Smykowski"" is a google-eyed, acne-scarred old timer whose panicked mumbling and emotional attachment to office supplies came across as kind of sad. I guess I've known too many real people like him who were marginalized and then forced out of corporations. The soundtrack consists (pointlessly) of quite foul rap music. A subplot about a malfunctioning office machine manages only to be confusing. The satire of peppy theme restaurants lacks punch. As an office worker myself, I was disappointed by the missed opportunities to lampoon office life. Only one character -- Gibbons' blue-collar neighbor Lawrence (Diedrich Bader) is memorable, consistent and likable.

""Office Space"" has contributed more than its share of catch phrases and characters. But its inconsistent characterizations, sloppy plotting, unrelenting vulgarity, gratuitous female nudity and misfiring satire made it as annoying is it was funny. It's a 2-star movie that gains a star (I hate to say it) for pervasive cultural relevance.

I've watched Office Space at least half a dozen times, and it still manages to make me cringe and laugh at the same time. Very funny, very pertinent. I figure that those who chose better career paths, ones that didn't relegate them to cube farms, will probably not ""get"" the movie.

While I have no qualms about R-rated movies and strong language, I feel this is one of those movies that would probably been better off had it gotten a PG or PG-13 rating.

Anyone in corporate America can identify with pretty much everyone in the movie.  In fact a few weeks ago, I had to interview someone that had the same name as a famous singer and as soon as I saw the name I immediately thought of the ""Michael......Bolton?"" scene from this movie.

If you work or have worked in the typical corporate environment then you pretty much know what this movie is about, from the early morning commute, lunch hour, leaving early on Fridays and department take over by consulting firms.  Even the office printer that is always screwing up shows up in the movie.  As accurate as the movie is, it does have an interesting twist in that the main character being fed up with his job gets caught in permanent trance after therapy session goes horribly wrong, and he ends up ""not caring"" anymore.  But instead of getting canned, he is actually given a promotion much to the chagrin of two of his co-workers who work their a***s off and don't get anything for it.

You're eagerly anticipating putting your education to good use in an important, meaningful job; having an inspiring boss who will help you reach the full limits of your potential; mingling with interesting, supportive coworkers; and, of course, bringing home a big paycheck.

Get real. As the tagline for the hilarious ""Office Space"" so aptly puts it, ""Work sucks."" The live-action writing and directing debut of Mike Judge (creator of the ""Beavis & Butthead"" MTV series) is a hilarious tale of office doldrums that showcases what life is, sadly, often like in the workplace.

Ron Livingston (Mikey's friend Rob in ""Swingers"") plays down-on-his-luck Peter Gibbons, a 20-something who hates his job and is on the outs with his girlfriend. In a highly amusing opening sequence, Peter unsuccessfully battles some horrendous traffic on the way to work, and then arrives to his cubicle just in time to be lectured by his superiors for a tiny, inconsequential error he made.

It's a brutal day in the life of Peter, but unfortunately it's become the norm. However, when Peter goes to a counseling session with his girlfriend, an unexpected turn of events leads him to a new life philosophy: He doesn't give a s---. He disregards his boss' request that he work during the weekend, hangs up the phone on his (soon-to-be ex) girlfriend, and successfully asks out an attractive waitress he's had his eye on (""Friends'"" Jennifer Aniston). Most significantly, he teams up with two of his coworkers, Samir (Ajay Naidu) and the unfortunately named Michael Bolton (David Herman), in a scam that will potentially screw the company out of thousands of dollars.

With the sharply written ""Office Space,"" Mike Judge proves he's more than a one-note wonder by doing a superb job of capturing the malaise of the typical office environment. His most impressive directorial touch is an instantly classic scene in which Peter, Samir and Michael carry the office copying machine to a deserted field and literally kick the crap out of it. Shot in slo-mo and set to a gangsta rap tune, this scene is pure comic genius.

Livingston is a good comedic actor who has the talent to become a star in the mold of Matthew Broderick. He gets solid support from Naidu, Herman and Aniston (who deserves credit for taking a small role in this low-budget pic), as well as Gary Cole, who gives a top-notch performance as Peter's super-anal, monotone-voiced boss.

Whether you're a student looking for an amusing preview of what's in store for you on the job scene, or an unfortunate sap who's currently experiencing the hell of working in an office, you should get plenty of laughs from the excellent ""Office Space.""",1179705600,3,2761,4.952483801295896

I believe the reason being - majority of us have to work and many are not very happy with their jobs or job environment. If asked, everyone may recall to having a boss from hell, to be annoyed by changing every week TES (Time Entering System), by the printer or copy machine that seem to hate you and break on you every time you need to print or copy something. Well, with all recognizable funny and sad details of the modern office environment that show Judge's observant eye and wicked sense of humor, the movie is not a great one and not always a good one. It is an average comedy that had interesting potentials but is too long for its length and loses its steam somewhere after first thirty minutes. It's got too many subplots and supporting characters that were neither interesting, nor necessary, for example, the romance between Peter and a local waitress (Jennifer Aniston). A moneymaking scheme that Peter and his friends devise belongs to the different movie and Peter's transformation in the end does not seem to be plausible. I was happy for Milton though. :)

...in DVD/home video-land, 'Office Space' became a cultural phenomenon.  As one reviewer notes, Mike Judge's workplace masterpiece ""promptly broke every video record in Fox history.""  And eight years after its release it continues to be a phenomenon.  In retrospect, the big screen release was terribly mis-marketed.  Count me among the many who bypassed it in the theater because I couldn't make heads or tails out of the ads.

Judge's film is set in a 'nameless Texas city,"" but this is clearly Dallas.  For those of us that have lived in that city - the corporate home of TGI Friday's and its flair-bedazzled employees - there are inside laughs by the bucketful, including the back-to-back apartments with paper-thin walls, the massive traffic pile-ups on 635 (LBJ), Initech's classic Dallas office space, etc.

Great performances here:  Mike Judge's (uncredited) cameo as Jennifer Aniston's flair-obsessed manager; David Herman's fantastic turn as Michael Bolton (no relation); and John C.

I've worked in a corporate environment for seven years now and this movie is just as funny now as it was when I first saw it back in the day.  Its scary how little the work place has changed.

Mike Judge assembled a great crew to pull this movie off.  The sets are great, from Initech's cubicle mazes, to Chotchkie's all to familiar decor, to Peter's apartment.  He's got a great cast with Ron Livingston playing our everyman main character.  Perhaps it is Gary Cole as Bill Lumbergh that makes the best impression as the oh-so-subtle manager without a clue.  Or maybe its John C. McGinley as Bob the efficiency expert that steals the vote for best supporting actor in this comedy.  But how can you forget Stephen Root as Milton, the inspiration for this comedic adventure.  And I can't leave out David Herman or Ajay Naidu as the poor dopes that get roped into Peter's clever scheme.  Oh yeah and Jennifer Aniston is in it too.

The script is great, especially when it flings its barbed humor at the corporate world.  Things falter a bit when Peter scheme kicks into action, but there are plenty of good bits after as well (my favorite being the fate of the office printer).  The use of gangster rap music is appropriate, but I know some viewers won't appreciate it or the use of colorful language throughout the movie.

This is a great piece of entertainment, and proves that Mike Judge is as good with live action films as he is with animation.  He would go on to confirm this with his satirically stupid look at an incredibly dumb future in Idiocracy.

Unless you're self-employed and work at home, you can't help but draw your own similarities to the Office Space work environment and your own. I've worked with a Lumberg, a Joanna, and a Michael... and a guy who didn't have an Arabic name, but he wanted to beat up every piece of office machinery which didn't work right. We even had a Milton-like guy once... he ended up going berserk and being escorted out by the police, but that's another story.

All in all, I highly recommend this movie to everyone who has a job and knows what it's like to suffer from the aggravation of office politics. This movie delivers a figurative eye-gouging to all the politics and backstabbing that goes on every day in America's corporate workplaces. It shows one of the things that can happen when big corporate CEOs think they're making some really smart move, and end up shooting themselves in the foot instead.

1047934,3,6305499365,"Office Space (Mike Judge, 1999)

It has seemed that over the years since this relatively obscure little movie came out, it's enjoyed a growing popularity simply on word of mouth. Pretty much everyone I know makes multiple references to it in just about every work-related conversation I've had. One it started showing up in commercials, I figured it was time to get around to seeing it. And while I didn't think it was awful, I have to wonder what those who say ""if you've worked in this environment, you'll think this is the funniest movie ever"" were smoking when they saw it. It's mildly amusing, but nothing special.

In case you've been living under a rock for seven years, the plot: Peter Gibbons (Standoff's Ron Livingston), a drone at a large corporation, is just living day to day, doing nothing but working, obsessed with Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), a waitress at the local sports bar, with his only social interaction outside the workplace being with his somewhat psychotic neighbor Lawrence (well-known voice actor Diedrich Bader) when they talk through the thin walls of their condos. The company brings in a pair of efficiency experts, Bob (John C. McGinley) and Bob (Paul Wilson), and something snaps; Gibbons decides to simply neglect his job. Needless to say, the second he does this, his supervisor, Bill (Gary Cole) calls for his head, and the efficiency experts decide he needs to be promoted to upper management. And things just get weirder from there.

It's not a bad film, really-- I just don't think it lives up to the incredible hype that it's now almost impossible to see this movie without experiencing. You will likely be told that it's the best thing since sliced bread, and that if you don't find it the funniest movie you've ever seen, you just don't get it. Not true. Remember, Mike Judge is the guy behind Beavis and Butt-Head and King of the Hill; if you were never a fan, this probably isn't going to change your mind. Still, it is true that if you work in an office environment, you'll either identify with or recognize a lot of these people, and that goes a long way towards redeeming some of the jokes that don't quite cut it. ** ",1167782400,4,2166,4.7071240105540895

I won't say it's a fantastic film, but I sure as heck wasn't bored and found a lot of true, funny events to ponder.  If this film is worth anything at all, it's the character, ""Milton"", an overweight, coke-bottled glass wearing, wimpy do-nothing that cannot find his stapler.

1047971,5,6305499365,"Office Space highlights the absurdities of the modern day workplace, and the high tech workplace specifically. Everyone at computer software company ""Initech"" hates their jobs, especially Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) who feels trapped in a treadmill of nonrewarding monotonous work as he rewrites and tests other people's software to insure it is Y2K compliant. Simultaneously, he feels equally trapped in a relationship with a woman who treats him like an unsatisfactory employee. Peter represents all of the 25-35 year old white collar workers who know they are not doing what they want to with their lives but simply find initiating a complete career change as too scary, as if anything could be worse than what they are putting up with already.

I'm positive that someone involved with this movie has a deep understanding of working in software, because I easily recognized each of the various types of people represented in the cast - even the psychotic coworker, Milton, who keeps coming to work when they move his desk to the basement and stop paying him. Gary Cole's performance of Bill Lundburg hits the bullseye as the boss that understates in a calm voice everything that he wants, but then has no problem firing people if they don't meet his understated demands. What seems like a post-it note is actually a subpoena, in Lundburg's eyes. One of my favorite scenes is when he is having everyone come in and basically beg for their jobs by justifying their positions. One older worker only seems to have one function - to carry the requirements from the requirements writers to the software engineers. When the bosses try to probe more deeply into his skills he gets angry and bellows ""Are you blind! Can't you people see I have valuable people skills!"".

Ultimately, Peter and his coworkers bungle a scheme to embezzle from the company by writing a program that extracts fractions of pennies per iteration. Instead of producing many very small checks, the program winds up producing one huge check that is bound to attract attention. Thus Peter goes to Initech to return the check. His return of the money coincides with psychotic coworker Milton finally making good on his mumblings of ""burn down the building"". The end result is that, with no Initech to return to, Peter takes a job in construction and realizes he enjoys working outside and with his hands and is thus finally happy in his work. As for Milton, in spite of being without a paycheck for weeks, he seems to mysteriously have found the money to have taken up residence in a tropical resort.",1165017600,4,2568,4.887614678899083

In fact, all he really wants to do is watch Kung Fu with his super hot girlfriend played by Jennifer Aniston. So after being somewhat hypnotized during a therapy session, Peter decides to just stop going to work or going on his own terms which leads to hilarious results. Peter's cadre of co-workers include his underappreciated buddies Samir and Michael Bolton. When Peter learns that Initech plans to fire Samir and Michael, they hatch a scheme to rip off the company. If you've ever hated your job or felt trapped in a terrible company then you will definitely relate to Office Space. You may also recognize Milton (the office psycho) as the nerdy fat guy from dodgeball. Milton loves his red swingline stapler and playing his music at a reasonable volume.

1047976,5,6305499365,"Office Space was clearly a movie produced for individuals who have ever either worked in an office and those that never have.  Either way, you picked up a paycheck from some scummy employer that probably robbed you each paycheck and you didn't know how to get back at them.  This includes every working adult.
If you ever went to work and wanted to impose serious bodily injury on your boss or just wanted to tell them to shove it, this movie is for you.  If you ever drove away from your employer hoping that one day the building you worked in would burn down, this movie is for you.  If you ever wished death on that woman that every single day pissed you for some reason or other, but basically just no reason at all, this movie is for you.  If you ever wanted to just quit your crappy job, but kept on going and then got promoted because of it, this movie is surely for you.
Ron Livingston (who plays Peter) performance in this movie was OSCAR worthy.  It transcends the feeling of every working American from the time period that this movie was produced at, set in the 1980's until today (2006).  This movie transcended time and space and I believe will become as important to the fabric of America as the Sound of Music and the Star Wars movies one thru three.  Livingston's simply lays out what every single American office worker has every felt in the history of office work, F the establishment and do it with pride.
Having seen this movie numerous times I know where the jokes, but I have yet not to laugh with gusto and amazement how this film portrays the exact feeling of what it is too work in America, both in the 1980's and today.  Regardless of your age, 18 to 88 years old I believe that this movie will bond generations of American workers throughout the centuries for the rest of all our lives.

In fact, Office Space has reached cult status for a reason. It's funny, witty, and always makes you laugh. The cast includes Jennifer Aniston in a supporting role as the waitress/girlfriend of Ron Livingston's character who has an epiphany during a group therapy session. Alex Wentworth plays his girlfriend in her shorter role. Anyway, I don't remember the man who plays the Arab employee and friend of Ron's character but he should be applauded for his role. Newsradio Stephen Root should have his own sitcom for his performance as Milton, the poor picked on employee who reaches a breaking point in the film. Diedrich Bader plays the neighbor next door who offers wisdom to Ron's character in the film. Mad TV's alum Gregory Herman plays another colleague and computer geek. Another Mad TV alum Orlando Jones plays a guy selling magazines door to door. HE turns out not to be the person you think he is. Gary Cole has a memorable performance as the boss who thinks he knows it all but doesn't know anything. Movies like Office Space make me understand what we have become for those of us in the office.

One thing I've never seen mentioned is how ironic and funny this movie was, as a statement of the 80's.  The 80's are generally overlooked. But this movie, casually shows many instances of reference to this often overlooked decade.  For instance:

1) Did you notice they go for coffee in a restaurant coffee shop?  Not a stand in line, barrista style Starbucks coffee shop.  Very indicative of the office workers in the Silicone Valley offices.  I worked at a restaurant very similar to the one in the movie, and the office workers often came for coffee in the mornings, at the Peninsula, California city I worked in.  And no, they did not require us to wear ""fringe.""

2) Did you notice the boss, as he walked around from desk to desk, he carried a ceramic coffee mug, not a papercup?  Another indication of the 80's.

3) The fact that this movie was centered around the Silicone Valley, and computer companies, again was an indication of the 80's computer rush.

4) Many other 80's nostalgia references, can you think of any?

Highly recommended.

1047980,5,6305499365,"Ah, Office Space, one of the greatest comedies of all-time. How can you not laugh at this movie? It insults and exposes the isolation of working in a cubical in some multi-million dollar corporation, with obnoxious co-workers and a boss that overuses the word ""Yeah"". The red stapler scene is ALONE worth the price of the enitire movie. Of course, in the end we learn that everything will work out as long as you have that one co-worker who's a stuttering fat guy who can't stand up for himself who torches the entire building so he can get his stapler back.... *sarcasm*. But whatever. What can I say? It's classic humour. If you haven't seen this movie, get off your couch, stop watching that re-run of some WB drama, and rent - no, BUY this movie NOW! You'll never be able to stop watching Office Space. And for the record, this gets my vote for the best comedy of the entire 90s.

1048012,5,6305499365,"I only worked in one office for a month and I can relate to a lot of things in this movie: the printer that barely worked at times, the overdemanding boss, the rules and regulations and that feeling that any kind of profit and you're not going to see a dime from it. Unlike certain comedy movies which are based primarily on being disgusting, rude or people getting smacked by things, Office Space gets its laughs by moments where you go ""I know someone exactly like that"".

Peter and 2 friends work at Initech, a computer company that prides itself on making workers do what they've been told to do. After a hypnotherapy session, Peter becomes carefree and uninhibited but he gets a promotion. How to get back at them? Put a virus in the computer system that takes the remainders of transactions and puts them in a separate account. Will they get caught?

One of the great things about this movie is that it seems to take itself seriously while having fun at the same time. While there's no big comedy punchlines, the film is quite funny at certain personas we've met such as that slooow tallllking guy...mmkay? Or bosses in restaurants making demands while saying it's up to you if you want to do it but I'm gonna whine if you don't.

Acting-wise the film's straight across the board. While I only know 3 cast members(obviously Jennifer Aniston and the others being Dave Herman, voice actor on Futurama and John C. McGinley), everyone's perfect in their roles and even spout some great one-liners too. My favorite: a neighbor, overhearing about Peter's plan gone awry, declines an offer to visit Peter saying ""that's ok, don't want you to **** up my life too."" The only thing I didn't like is that the character you're going to love to hate never gets a comeuppance, like somebody losing it and punching him. Kind of disappointing.

How skimpy on the extras. This ""Special Edition"" practically has one making-of and deleted scenes and DVD-ROM stuff. No commentary?

1048014,4,6305499365,"Office Space is a brilliant parody of life in corporate America.  While funny, the movie conveys the soullessness of commuting to work, putting in 8-10 hour days doing tasks you hate for a boss you hate even more, only to have to wake up the next day -- sometimes on weekends -- and do it all over again.  Even though it's clearly a comedy, Office Space has caused me to stop and consider (more than once) how I want to spend my work days.

The comedy is brilliant.  There aren't too many movie scenes funnier than Peter, Michael and Samir exacting their revenge on a bothersome piece of office equipment.  The rest of the movie hums along at a great clip, lampooning the sameness of office and service industry job environments.

The humor is a bit raw in spots.  If you are concerned about language, Office Space has its fair share of ""F-bombs"". Unlike some movies that need raunch to carry them, Office Space would be funny as a PG flick.

1048016,5,6305499365,"If they made a live-action ""Dilbert"" movie, it might resemble ""Office Space"" -- a hysterically funny office film by Mike Judge (of ""Beavis & Butthead"" fame). Filled with quirky characters and a hilarious employee rebellion, this is a movie for anyone who ever felt trapped in a soul-destroying job.

Peter (Ron Livingston) spends every day in a cubicle, doing pointless work under the thumb of his smarmy boss. His life is boring, and he doesn't even have the confidence to tell the pretty waitress (Jennifer Aniston) that he likes her. In an effort to relax, he accompanies his controlling girlfriend to a hypnosis session. Unfortunately, the hypnotist dies of a heart attack... while Peter is still under.

The next morning, Peter wakes up happy and laid-back -- and determined to get out of his rotten job, and live fat and happy. He conspires with Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and ill-named Michael Bolton (David Herman) -- two coworkers who are about to be axed -- to skim money off the company's assets with no one the wiser. Only problem is, their scene is rapidly spinning out of control.

""Office Space"" started off as an early 90s animated skit, featuring the character of Milton. You know, that increasingly deranged employee who complains that ""you took my stapler."" This time, Milton is a minor character, although a pivotal one. The focus is mainly on the mellowed-out Peter and his wild scheme to profit the downtrodden employees of Initech.

Judge creates a hysterical tangle of cubicle workers, layoffs and the most annoying boss in the history of film (""Yeeeeeeaaaahhhh... uhhhhhhh...""). This brand of humor is twisted, down to the slow-motion, ghetto-style beating of the copier in the middle of a field. And of course, the dialogue is quietly insane (""Oh, and next Friday... is Hawaiian shirt day..."") as the plot grows grows more and more tense... until you know someone has to snap.

The trio of lead characters are a riot -- there's Peter, whose newfound perspective is immensely entertaining. There's Samir, who can barely restrain his simmering rage at his rotten job. And there's Michael, who has a seething resentment that he has the same name as THAT sappy singer. Jennifer Aniston does a pretty good job as a love interest for Peter -- a waittress who hates her job as much as he hates his.

""Office Space"" has become something of a deserving cult classic -- funny, strange, and sympathetic to the ants that toil in their cubicles. Make more movies, Mike Judge -- especially if they're as good as ""Office Space.""",1153353600,,2545,4.906976744186046

""I'm not going to go there anymore.""

""Are you quitting?""

Naturally, as in Being There, the simple truth leads to tremendous professional success.  This could have been developed into a funny theme where the simpleton rises through the company viewing the disfunctional working world through a simpleton's eyes.  But the screenwriter has different ideas.

In the third part of the movie Peter decides that he and two co-workers will rip off the company with a computer fix.  Naturally this goes poorly and he is no longer the simple man of Act 2, but now a typical comic lead character.

I like ""quirky"" films like Little Shop of Horrors (musical version), Serial Mom, Chasing Amy, etc, but this movie fell short in so many ways. I have worked in ""the office"" for over 10 years. I spend my 8, or 9, or 10, or more hours a day in a cubicle with no view to speak of. I know all about crappy office equipment, the difficulty getting office supplies, the stereotypical annoying people, the feeling that any day someone will come by and tell me that I'm no longer needed, etc. But, this movie just didn't capitalize enough on the humor that is found in everyday work. I think I could take a video camera to my job for a week and come away with two hours worth of funnier material.

I was truly disappointed in the path that the storyline took - what was that whole program to steal less than a penny from hundreds of ""accounts"" so the characters could come away with a few hundred thousand dollars at the end of 3 or 4 years? That part of the movie was so ridiculous, it wasn't even slightly funny. In all honesty, the best characters in the movie were the next door neighbor to the main character, and the waitress (Jennifer Aniston). If not for them, I don't think I would have even smiled once throughout the whole movie.

The movie has since grown on me, and I think it's one of the best comedies out there.

I think what really gives Office Space's it's sheer staying power is that every character is twisted. This is not your normal story with fully fleshed out, dynamic characters who seamlessly fit together. Oh, no. This is stereotypes at their best and brightest. If you've ever worked anywhere with more than 5 people, you're going to associate these stereotypes with your current and former co-workers. There's the woman who never varies from her routine, down to saying the same thing the same way EVERY time; the manager that doesn't actually listen, has the annoying facial tick/movement/phrase; the squirrelly looking mumbling guy that no one pays attention to; the stoner chick with no real life plan, and the young obnoxious guy who's sole goal is to get luck. Not every place I've worked has had everyone one of these stereotypes, but I'm sure I can place at least a couple of them at any job I've ever had.

It took me a few viewings to really realize that the movie has two equally entertaining plotlines. The first is Peter, who hates his job, has a girlfriend who's cheating on him, and is always suckered into working on the weekends. We see the movie through his eyes, which has it's ups and downs, including hypnosis, slacking off work, and the new girlfriend that flips off her boss. However, the equally funny, and almost non-sequitor counter story is of Milton, office drone that's stepped on, ignored, made fun of, and worst of all, has his beloved red Swingline stapler stolen. He says so many funny things that it's worth watching the movie a couple times to really get what he's saying. And if you own the More Flair copy, it gets better.

This copy was a Christmas present from the same person who gave me a red stapler for my birthday last year. While it's not loaded full of hours upon hours of special features, I did enjoy the making of featurette, where they interview the cast.  You get a wider, more in-depth view of all the characters. My favorite sheds new light on Milton's line and I could see the squirrels, and they were married,"" which is apparently a euphemism for what he actually saw the squirrels doing.  I know it's a funny thing to really gain appreciation for, but it's the bits like that line that make Office Space one of the comedy gems.

Not everyone is going to like this movie. If you're one of those people who saw it once and thought it was stupid, humorless, or pointless, watch it again. You might it's not as bad as you thought it was.",1140912000,2,2794,4.544731610337972

'Office Space' is one of those few movies that really brings the average day in office to true life. Eventhough there are some overly exageratted scenes in this movie (oh and they are extremly funny), there are so many things I myself pointed at the screen saying 'That happened to me!'

This movie is not one to be missed it IS the movie you need to watch when you come home from work. The characters are great, Mike Judge even got the stereotypes correct in the software field. There is always a huge woman sitting at the front desk directing calls, there is always an Indian guy (if you have called Dell computers for assistance you know I am right.) And yes there is always a geekey looking guy who acts like a hot shot, whom you have to lick the scum off of his shoes everyday just to prevent yourself from getting fired.

To Mike Judge and the cast of 'Office Space', thank you for showing us all how to stick it to the man because we are all too big of whimps to do it ourselves.",1138492800,2,1164,4.257918552036199
1048147,5,6305499365,"Now, Office Space might look like a movie about this young guy whose whole viewpoint on cubicle hell is changed when his occupational hypnotherapist dies in the middle of a hypnosis session, leaving him with a wonderfully carefree attitude toward the job he despises - but it's not.  The real star of this movie is Milton Waddams (Stephen Root), the mumbling, thoroughly mistreated oddball who is pushed beyond his limits after the boss, among other things, steals his stapler.  He really loved that stapler, which is why he continued to use it after the company went with a completely different stapler manufacturer.  When you're stuck in a cubicle for forty hours a week and forced to watch all sorts of Who Stole My Cheese nonsense taking place all around you, when you're always the odd man out when the boss' yearly birthday cake gets handed out, when you're forced to change cubicles over and over again for no good reason whatsoever, you become Milton.  With no control over your life's direction, you cling to any little thing you can find in your three-walled domain - a favorite stapler, your chair (which you really should put your name on, if you want to make sure someone doesn't pull the old switcheroo on you), and the all-consuming importance of locks for your shelves (which the movie completely leaves out, for some reason).  Your bosses make fun of you behind your back and think of ways to make your life even more miserable, and you start mumbling all the time.  Yes, Milton truly represents those unfortunate enough to be trapped inside cubicle farms.

However, since the movie does give young Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) and his buddies most of the screen time, I'll talk about them as well.  That Pete's really got his head on straight as the movie begins; he has already learned that work is a form of torture that makes every day worse than the one before until you get old and die.  His buddies at work are pretty spot-on as well, knowing that the hiring of a consultant means a labor reduction is imminent.  Then Peter sees this hypnotherapist who gets him nice and relaxed, with all of his work-related worries washed away - and keels over dead, leaving Peter in a state that can only be described as carefree.  He just stops going to work for awhile, but when he does pop in (just to pick up his address book), he goes ahead and talks to the two Bobs (the consultants).  His straight-shooting, incredibly honest answers about how little he actually does at the company convince the Bobs that he is upper management material.  While Peter's being promoted, though, his buddies Michael Bolton (David Herman) - no, he's not related to that dreadful singer - and Samir  Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) are being laid off.  That's when Peter comes up with a plan - well, actually, the whole idea was Michael's, but Peter talks him and Samir into actually doing it.  They plant a virus-type routine, designed to skim off a fraction of a cent from every transaction, inside the computer system.  The plan ends up working too well, though, putting Peter and the guys into quite a potential pickle.

I think the film sort of loses its focus during the final half hour.  Up until that point, it's a dead-on parody of cubicle life.  You've got your fax machine designed to jam as often as possible, your boss who speaks to you as if you're intellectually challenged and never hears a word you say, a  whole range of annoying co-workers, etc..  The whole ""Didn't you get the memo?"" routine captures the very essence of life in the cubicle jungle.  A great supporting cast, including Jennifer Aniston as Joanna, a waitress who just says no to ""flair,"" and Diedrich Bader as Peter's next-door-neighbor, really round out the film remarkably well.  Even the genius behind the whole film, Mike Judge, joins the fun as Joanna's flair-obsessed manager.

I just bought 2 of the gift sets online at Bestbuy.com for 21.99 each, although perhaps stock is based on regional availability ?

Anyway, here's the scoop:  The new edition of the movie ""Special Edition with Flair"" (which you can buy solo for about 12.99) is worth it - even if only for all the computer stuff: sound effect files, and a small computer game.  The gift set, however, is not really worth it, especially for a die hard fan.

The extras are really cheesy.  They are all stamped with an ""Office Space Special Edition with Flair"" logo as well as one for Twentieth Century Fox.  The red stapler is not a Swingline - it is a VERY cheap little plastic number which will probably break after a few uses.  The plastic pen and pencil are crappier than the cheapest giveaway pens I have ever seen.  The mug has the logos as mentioned, and a really low-res picture of Lumburg on it.  The magnet frame is similarly cheap - perhaps suitable for the office fridge (if you can sneak it in when no one is looking).  The mouse pad is OK, but with phrases like ""revenge to the fax on it"" (when clearly it should say ""revenge to the printer"") you can tell the extras weren't put together by fans of the movie - more likely marketing weasels from Dilbert world.  Lastly, the TPS report memo sheets are kind of cool, with the Initech logo and the image of the fish innards on them - but then the movie logo kind of ruins the effect.

That said, this would make the perfect gift for an office party, although I am going to buy just the movie and a real Swingline for a gift instead.",1135641600,35,1617,4.279605263157895

When I initially opened up the box my first impressions was: just another movie with Jeniffer Aniston from Friends..possibly boring. After watching it my worries have been completely lifted. This movie tells you about all the things in corporate America they never teach you about in business school: it teaches you how to not work and get promoted, how skipping work is ok, how to outpromote your boss and how to retire stinkin rich even if you are mildly retarded. It's a comedy that brings up front a bunch of guys from a 2000 bank software changeover company, the dreaded 99 going to 00 issue that was happening at the time, and their meaningless day to day jobs. The plot picks up as soon as Jennifer Aniston comes into the scene, a waitress in a dead-end restaurant where everyone is expected to do more than minimum but still receive minimum job satisfaction and respect. The main characther-programmer is so desilusioned with his job that he undergoes work therapy hypnosis with a guy that focuses on getting rid of work worries and inhibitions. Problem is that as the guy was bringing the main characther back the hypnotherapist dies of a heart attack.

In Office Space, Milton is seldom ever taken seriously. He is constantly being taken advantage of. First of all, Lumberg never returned the stapler that he had asked for several times. Not to mention, he asked to keep his desk where it was so he didn't have to move it again, but instead, he was pushed into the dark basement. So, in return, Milton took advantage of Initech, the company where he worked.

My brother, George, bought Office Space, a few years ago. He really gets a kick out of it because he, too, wishes that he could get paid for doing nothing. There are several parts in that movie that he finds humorous. One day, he and I even mimicked the movie by smashing a computer monitor with a baseball bat. And for him, that was pure fun. But while George liked Office Space from the start, I had to watch it two or three times before I really started to admire the film. Now, every time I watch it, I find something new to laugh about.

Near the beginning of the film, Lumberg took Milton's red stapler- Milton's favorite stapler because it didn't back up. And Milton automatically started to panic as his eyes widened and he started mumbling about how the last time someone took his stapler, they didn't return it. But even with the shock on Milton's face, Lumberg ignored him; he would simply override Milton's voice and say his famous, ""yeahhh."" When

Milton realized that Lumberg wasn't going to return the stapler, he even confronted the receptionist. She also ignored him.

Taking Milton's stapler wasn't enough for Lumberg though. When Lumberg told Milton that he'd have to get ready to move his desk, Milton pleaded not to because he had already moved his desk several times. In fact, he once had his desk near a window, but was eventually moved to a smaller cubicle surrounded florescent lights. But Lumberg didn't even consider listening to Milton. Instead, he told Milton that he needed to move his desk into the basement as soon as possible because there wasn't enough room for him upstairs. Milton tried, again, to explain that he had already moved his desk so many times, and he didn't want to do it again. And once again, he was ignored, while Lumberg said, ""yeah, if you could move it that'd be great."" When Milton found himself sitting in the dark basement, that's when he decided that ""that was the last straw."" Milton was getting so angry lately that he even threatened under his breath that he'd burn the building down.

So in return, Milton decided to give Initech a little taste of what he was really capable of. He was going to tell Lumberg that he was taking his stapler back. When he charged into Lumberg's office to retrieve his stolen property, the audience were led to believe that he discovered the money stolen by Peter, Michael and Samir, because he walked into the office in the scene right after the scene where Peter puts an envelope with the money under Lumberg's door. Then, I can only assume that he burns the building down as promised earlier in the movie because the building is burnt right after the scene

where Milton stumbles upon the envelope. Milton then vacationed on a hot, sunny beach without a care in the world. And he was living Peters dream - Milton was doing nothing.

So throughout the whole movie, we were led to believe Milton was just an unattractive man who could be stepped on by anyone. We watched other people judge him, and we began to judge him too. But we were proved to be wrong about him; he's not as stupid as he seemed. He was bright enough to take the money without any remorse and simply go on vacation. And now, he had the power to boss other people around; now he could get what he wanted. He, the one who had been taken advantage of, was now taking advantage of others. He was the one who prevailed.",1134691200,3,3792,4.541727672035139
1048265,5,6305499365,"In Office Space, everybody hates their jobs because they aren't even worried about getting fired and Peter, Michael and Samir all think that everyday they work is the worst day of their lives. Furthermore, all three of them will risk going to jail to sabotage the company with a computer virus.

 I remember watching this movie when it first came out. That was 6 years ago and I didn't understand a lot of the crude and inappropriate jokes. It was a lot more funny watching it the second time and there was parts of the movie that I didn't remember.

 Everybody hates their jobs in the movie Office Space and they aren't even worried about getting fired. They take their anger out on printers and copy machines. When Peter sleeps at night all he thinks about is how much his life sucks and that he wishes he could lay around and do nothing all day. Some employees even day dream of burning down the building. Working at Inotech, Makes the lives of the employees a living hell. Anybody who works there would rather get laid off then to stand another day working for Mr. Lumberg.

 For Peter, Michael and Samir everyday is the worst day of their lives. Peter even goes to a psychologist to discuss his life and how much he hates it. The psychologist helps him, however, with hypnosis. He isn't the only one that thinks his life sucks. His girlfriend Joanna works at a local diner and hates her job so she freaks out and quits. They need to find a way to get even.

 Furthermore, all three of them will risk going to jail to sabotage the company with a computer virus. The virus rounds off small amounts of money and transacts money from the company into a neutral bank account. They figured little by little money would be transferred so no one would notice the small amounts missing. The three believed that even if they got caught they would not even have to serve time, however, when $305,000 was transferred to their account they thought different.

Actually I called in sick to work to go see it, because I was a huge fan of Mike Judge's work-- and I loved idea of Office Space.

After seeing the movie, I was hooked.  I told everyone at my then place of employment about it-- I didn't mention I was there during working hours.  Office Space was VERY descriptive of my then-current occupation.

Regardless of your personal situtation, you will find a lot to like with this movie.  The laughs are non-stop, from the opening sequence of the commute to work on through.

The bits with Milton, are a little disjointed from the main story-- but fans of Judge's Milton cartoon shorts will be pleased with their inclusion, and the expansion of Milton's boss into divisional VP Bill Lumburgh, the principal antagonist of Peter Gibbons and his friends.

With numerous hilarious scenes, in which any white collar worker will see bit of their own job, Office Space is a great movie.

1048268,4,6305499365,"After being pestered my many people for years to see this movie, I have finally gotten around to it.  The thing I guess I should say first is that while this is definitely a very funny movie, I think that it is somewhat overhyped.  I don't want people to think that it doesn't deserve most of the praise it receives, for it is very enjoyable and very accurate.  However, it isn't as groundbreaking/defining as many people make it out to be.  Still, it's a fun movie that everyone should see at least once.

Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) is a mid-level corporate drone working for a generic software company, and it doesn't look like he's going anywhere in life.  His best friends Michael Bolton (David Herman), who has no relation to the singer, and Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu), who is tired of Americans being unable to pronounce his name, are also employed at Initech, and have similar outlooks for the future.  The three spend their days hitting the printer that always jams and going to Chotchkie's, a TGIFridays-type restaurant that employs the beautiful Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), who Peter constantly pines for.  The other people in Peter's life include Anne (Alexandra Wentworth), his girlfriend whom he believes is cheating on him, Lawrence (the underused Diedrich Bader), his construction worker neighbor, Milton (Stephen Root), a mumbling coworker whose only loves in life are his radio and his red Swingline stapler, and Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole), his evil, soulless boss who makes him work on the weekends and always starts sentences with ""Uh, yeah, what's happening?"".

When Peter is brought to see an occupational hypnotherapist, the doc does wonders for him.  He is able to get Peter completely relaxed, but before he can wake Peter up, he keels over from a heart attack.  Now, Peter hasn't a care in the world.  He skips work, breaks up with Ann, and asks out Joanna.  And amazingly, just when Lumbergh is going to fire him, two ""efficiency consultants"" (played by John C. McGinley and Paul Willson) observe Peter's behavior and believe that he just isn't being challenged enough at work, and they reccomend him for a promotion!

Eventually, using his newfound apathy, Peter decides that they should make good on Michael's constant quips about how he could write a virus that could scam Initech for millions.  Of course, things don't go as planned, and the results are of coures hilarious.

This movie has often been lauded as being one of the greatest corporate satires ever made.  While I believe that it does get many things right, I don't think that this is anything new.  That doesn't prevent the movie from being funny, though.  Lumbergh's whole schtick about his personality and mannerisms is one of the greatest characterizations I've seen in years.  Furthermore, the whole Milton subplot where he is constantly being relocated by Lumbergh is fun just to see what Milton will mumble next.  I also now understand a lot of the things that I've heard people say in regards to this film (the case of the Mondays things is the most prominent).

Overall, this is a film that most people, especially those who work for corporations like Initech, should see at least once.  My biggest gripe was the use of a lot of rap music, which I don't particularly care for, so if that's the biggest problem, that's not bad at all.  While it may not deserve all the hype it receives, there is still a lot of good to be said for Office Space.",1134172800,,3452,4.8217317487266556
1048269,5,6305499365,"I have never seen this movie in the theaters.  Neither has anyone else, as far as I know.

My first viewing of this film came in early 2002.  I was fed up with my job, and my employer (a large high-tech firm whose name I will not mention here) was announcing upcoming layoffs.  I'd heard about Office Space from several friends of mine, and so I finally decided to rent it.  By the time I returned it, I had watched it eight times.

I've now seen it a total of twelve times, and it still makes me laugh.  There is something in this movie for anyone who's endured a job in corporate America.  I could strongly identify with Peter, the main character of the film, who is apparently trying to find himself.  But really every character in this movie is worth remembering.

I got the Special Edition with Flair as a recent Netflix rental.  While I don't think the deleted scenes would have really added to the movie, there are a couple good ones, and the documentary about the making of the film is worth seeing.

1048270,5,6305499365,"We've owned the original Office Space DVD since it first came out, but it came out early in the days of DVD's when production companies has not yet grasped the value of ""Special Features"" - deleted scenes, commentary tracks, outtakes, interviews with the cast, etc. - all of those features which we have come to expect from a DVD.  The lack of ANY of these features on the original DVD always made me a little bit sad; I knew they could do better.

1048327,5,6305499365,"Today we like to think of the modern-day office environment as the embodiment of all that is soulless about the corporate world. But in truth, the cubicle was designed to actually make life better for the average worker. It was designed to give them privacy and some degree of independence, as opposed to the previous custom of having rows and rows of desk next to each other in orderly fashion. So what went wrong?

""Office Space"" is a light comedy, but it gives a lot of answers to the question of why the modern corporate office has become such an alienating place. It is because everyone is in their own world. We see it in the opening scene, even while the characters are driving to work in their cars. They each have their own way of dealing with traffic. They arrive at work already alienated. Furthermore, the cast of quirky characters in the film suggests that each person is in their own world: Milton sits in his cubicle whining about his stapler, Mike Bolton sits around wondering how to bring down the company, Peter worries about avoiding his boss, Drew probably thinks up elaborate sexual fantasies, etc.

In other words, even though we might like to think of the modern office as being an annoying place where we have to deal with annoying people, I think ""Office Space"" suggests that the real problem is that we are so alienated from each other in the office. (Check out the hilarious scene where Peter is talking on the phone to somebody, and the camera pans over to reveal that it's Milton, in the cubicle next to him.) This kind of alienation increases the impersonal nature of the place and heightens the paranoia -- which is really what ""Office Space"" is about.",1132963200,10,1683,4.625418060200669

The film is very funny (a lot of it is subtle humor and it's charming). Ron Livingston plays Peter, a typical working man who works at Initech but hates his job which he views as merely sitting in a cubicle. He works along with two very funny co-workers;

Michael Bolton (David Herman), no relation to the pop star and Samir (Ajay Naidu). After a strange experience with a hypnotist Peter decides he's just not going to go to work and stay at home. Then he gets a sexy girlfriend Joanna (Jennifer Aniston) and gets promoted. The film also includes the character that inspired the movie Milton (Stephen Root, Dodgeball) who is a mumbling idiot who was laid off from Initech months ago but continues to recieve a paycheck due to a glitch in the system...As I said it's subtle humor. One part that I found hilarious was when Michael is sitting in his car rapping along to this hardcore gangster rap, really getting into it and when a black man walks past his car he locks the door.

I love what they've done with the music, and many of the less visible characters, such as Lawrence the neighbor, are hilarious.  I absolutely love all the characters in this movie, with the exception of the stapler guy, whose meek and mumbly humor I still haven't managed to appreciate yet.  I think what makes this movie really extaordinary though is that it does such a great job of parodying the ridiculous aspects of the office environment.

1048333,5,6305499365,"I first watched ""Office Space"" on a laptop in a Tuscaloosa hotel with my future wife. We were on our way to a conference, and she suggested that we watch this movie. It wasn't too late in the evening, and the running time seemed reasonably short at approximately 90 minutes. I also figured that it would be pretty good, especially with Mike Judge as the writer and director. After having watched it several times since then, I am convinced that ""Office Space"" is one of the very best cinematic comedies made in recent years.

Watching ""Office Space"" seems especially therapeutic after dealing with craziness at work. This probably explains the film's broad appeal; it resonates with people who have needed to suffer bureaucratic B.S., the latest manifestations of ""office speak,"" and arbitrary rules at some point in their working lives. Of course, Judge himself drew upon his own memories of work in an office, which he finally escaped after hitting upon the idea for ""Beavis and B*tt-head."" Although some people have criticized ""Office Space"" for not having enough ""funny stuff,"" they don't seem to understand the subtlety of Judge's humor, which leans towards the dry and sardonic. One could almost imagine Billy Wilder feeling at home with the plot, though he might have needed a little extra nudging to include the gangsta rap songs.

With a cast that includes no ""big-name stars"" (except Jennifer Aniston), no central performer clamors for attention with cloying ""hilarity."" In fact, the quotidian nature of the characters actually enhances the humor. The characters in subordinate positions try to deal with inanities at work by stewing, fretting, and venting in private. Meanwhile, those with more power are content to reinforce the craziness because it guarantees their power, or because they are so entrenched in their positions that they don't recognize the arbitrary nature of the rules they enforce.

The characters are also funny because they remind me of people I have encountered throughout my life. Granted, they come across as caricatures to a degree, but the characters still seem more real than those conjured up for overly facile yuck-fests. In our own lives, many of us probably think that we are ""normal,"" like the main character Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) or his girlfriend Joanna (Aniston). However, not everyone can be like Peter or Joanna... or at least our perceptions of them as ""normal."" Peter's sudden ""transformation"" into a quasi-Zen warrior, as well as Joanna's semi-stoner attitude, might just put them way outside the mainstream. In any case, I've seen enough people who share similarities with one, or even several, of these characters:

- Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole), Peter's passive-aggressive, narcissistic, and clueless Yuppie boss (complete with aviator glasses, power tie, and coffee mug) at Initech

- Michael Bolton (David Herman), Peter's nerdy coworker who just itches to unleash his internal Navy SEAL and gangsta

- Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu), Peter's resourceful coworker who wants to ""make it"" in America

- Lawrence (Diedrich Bader), Peter's no-nonsense, no-collar neighbor and de facto confidant at the thin-walled Morningwood Apartments

- ""The Bobs"" (John C. McGinley and Paul Willson), coldly congenial external consultants hired by Initech to figure out how the company can ""cut costs""

- Tom Smykowski (Richard Riehle), the older Initech employee whose forced joviality barely disguises his anxiety about falling victim to The Bobs

- Stan (a well-disguised cameo by Judge himself), Joanna's flair-obsessed boss at the T.G.I. Friday's-like restaurant Chotchkies, which provides a non-office doppelg&auml;nger for Peter's work environment

And yes, I've seen a few people who remind me of Milton Waddams (Stephen Root), the put-upon office gnome with his barely audible stream-of-consciousness mumbling, coke-bottle glasses, outdated sense of non-fashion, and a passive-aggressive attitude matching that of Lumbergh (and that Lumbergh ultimately underestimates). Peter may be the story's main protagonist, but one could see Milton as an odd sort of antihero as well. His almost incoherent mumbling, mainly consisting of requests to clarify matters regarding his salary, his desk, and his red Swingline stapler, acts as a more personalized counterpoint to the double-talk and nonsensical policies that drive Initech. Albeit in extreme fashion, Milton also demonstrates that greed can only propel a business so far, and that an ultimate moral obligation to one's shareholders doesn't always pay off.

For ""Office Space"" aficianados, the ""Special Edition with Flair"" includes a 30 minute documentary that provides some insights into the making of the movie. Some of it might not seem like news to hardcore fans, but I learned a few new things: how Gary Cole came up with Lumbergh's voice; the ""bons mots"" Diedrich Bader improvised as Lawrence; how Stephen Root got around in thick glasses; where Ajay Naidu learned his dance moves; and the origin of the word a**clown. It also includes eight deleted scenes (some of which you might miss if you blink) and computer downloads. Alas, it does not include the animated ""Milton"" shorts created by Mike Judge in 1991, which provided the original inspiration for ""Office Space."" That's about as disappointing as excluding ""Hearts of Darkness"" from the ""Apocalypse Now Redux.""

Whether one gets ""Office Space"" with or without flair, I can guarantee a good laugh to anyone who has had to deal with any kind of work-related nonsense at some point in their lives. It might not change the world, but ""Office Space"" will probably remain an effective purgative for anyone who has encountered such situations. If nothing else, one can at least hope that the insights of ""Office Space"" will inform the ethics of up-and-coming managers, and make them prioritize the things that really should matter at work.",1131840000,85,5901,5.291666666666667
1048334,4,6305499365,"After the hype that has been given to this release for months and months I am pretty dissapointed.

The title of this release is slightly misleading. What they should really call it released slightly updated edition. If you have seen or own the original DVD release of Office Space you aren't missing much.

What we have here is the same transfer and audio mix as in the first DVD, no commentaries or any other extras here. I would have liked to see a slightly better transfer done for this flick. Although this is not bad, there are some issues with it, mainly in the colors. The 5.1 track is still very nice by today's standards and if one of the best mixed soundtracks I have heard on DVD.

Now on to the ""flair"". What we have is a crappy documentary that is sorely lacking. So much more could have be done there and more information given. It seems like a waste. Instead of spending the money on that lets get everyone in the room and give us a commentary. I'd love to hear all these guys together just joking around, I read a magazine article a few months ago with them all talking about this release and that was better than what we got here.

The deleted scenes are nice to see, and a few give some more insight into the story. Although they mention scenes in the documentary that are not included here, which again makes little sense.

And that is it. Where are the Milton shorts that were supposed to be included? You see 5 second clips in the documntary but I want to see them all.

1048397,5,6305499365,"""Office Space"" isn't the funniest movie ever made, but it's certainly one of my favorites. Like zillions of other people, I was introduced to this movie while trapped in a miserable soul-sucking job in a dysfunctional office environment. The kind of job where I'd spend Sundays curled up on the couch in a fetal position dreading Monday ... the kind of job where I'd dread Friday nights because I knew they weren't going to last long.

I wore out my VHS copy of this film years ago, so the DVD special edition got snapped up in a hurry. Some of the deleted scenes are hilarious, although the best new footage -- John C. McGinley's extended riffs on the wonder that is Michael Bolton -- is only to be found in the Mike Judge-hosted retrospective making-of feature.

In your darkest moments, ""Office Space"" is that shining jewel that makes life bearable again. It is indeed chicken soup for the cubicled soul. It's all ""about"" the workplace in America in the 1990s -- the cubicle-bound middle-management culture is so brilliantly dissected. From the traffic jam in the opening scene to the soulless birthday party held for the ""division VP"" towards the end, to the blinding white rage of the gangsta rap soundtrack, it is so funny that you will hurt.

The cast is outstanding, of course. It was shocking to find out that long-time ""Cheers"" barstool occupant Paul Willson was cast at the last minute; he's exactly the kind of actor you'd expect to find on the fringes of a movie like this one, so you wonder why it took so long to find him. Everyone has their personal favorites among the supporting players (McGinley & Willson, Ajay Naidu and Gary Cole all rob blind every scene they're in) but David Herman, playing ""Michael Bolton"", is my personal favorite. Maybe it's the short-sleeve-shirt with tie ensemble, or the printer scene, or, at long last, ""Call me Mike"", but there are times when I've watched ""Office Space"" just to identify with him and his plight.

In the end, ""Office Space"" went from just funny to truly life-changing the moment Peter Gibbsons said that he dreamed of doing ""nothing"". That's it! That's the moment! That's what we all really want, deep down, after years of crushing middle-management rules, memos, and coffee cups held chest-high. Yeah. Great.

Anyhoo, anyone who sees this comedy will be able to relate, ESPECIALLY if they have ever worked in a dead-end office job...sure, some of it goes over the top, but it's done in such an original and witty way, that it only adds to it's hilariousness, with memorable characters like poor Milton, LOL!!!

1048403,5,6305499365,"Mundane trivialities have a significant importance in many people's lives, as they have sunk into an existence where an income is more important than happiness.  The unhappiness often begins with everyday routines such as getting back and forth from work while spending the majority of their time at a job where they are miserable.  This suburban look on existentialism might be something that many can connect with, as everyday begins with the apprehension of the annoying alarm clock's sound and the irritating traffic congestions.  Meanwhile, the people tend to complain about the mind-numbing dreadfulness of their existence, as they do nothing to create a change for themselves.  A resulting factor is that they have entrapped themselves in the corporate establishment where their desire of objects is larger than the yearning for happiness. Mike Judge's film Office Space takes on the corporate induced melancholy through the eyes of a worn-out office worker Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) who takes matters in his own hands.

The comical humor in the initial scene presents the notion of the large number of people who commute back and forth to work.  Coming from Chicago, I can relate to the long and difficult ventures through the crammed highways, which also gets to Peter and his coworkers.  This sequence also suggests how many people actually undergo the everyday torment of making a living, maybe with a job that they hate.  Whether people hate their job, or not, the film encapsulates the essence of the frustration that comes with the occupational travel.  In addition, Judge shows that he understands the accumulation of frustration, as the journey to work spills over into the working day when the workers vent their anger on uncooperative fax machines and annoyance of repetitive sound.  If the problems were not enough with frustration and boredom, the bosses, here Bill Lundberg (Gary Cole), breathes down necks with overtime and better quality production.  One of the frequent behaviors that helps Peter and his friends manage their frustration is to wish their lives away by desiring for time to move faster, which could hasten time to the returning commute home.

The negative professional life that Peter possesses influences his personal and social life, as he returns home depleted after the emotional and psychological stress of his job.  It even affects his sleeping pattern, as nightmares about work haunt him.  The stress continues to increase as Initech, the company that he works for, has decided to downsize and his girlfriend has arranged for them to see a hypnotherapist to help deal with their relationship.  However, amidst the hypnosis of Peter, that is supposed to help him feel more blissful, the therapist suffers from a heart attack.  Peter remains within the peaceful ignorance of what is happening in his life, as he decides to sleep through the weekend and not go to work without feeling guilt, anguish, or any other kind of negative emotional response that would cause stress.

The aftermath of not showing up at work for the weekend overtime begins to mount, and with the notion of the downsizing in the back of the mind, his future might seem dark in regards to employment and economy.  However, in his mental state of happiness he finds strength to take control of his own life, which takes his life on a number of unexpected turns.  If the corporate America experienced an overwhelming number of people undergoing hypnosis similar to Peter's, it would drastically affect the national economy.  With this in mind, the film provides an interesting thought in regards to personal happiness and the commercial industry's desire to control people's pleasure with what people need for financial profits.

Office Space presents a truly remarkable societal comedy that reflects on the average person's place in society in the shadow of socioeconomic status.  It does so with a heavy dose of comic relief, as it portrays a wide range of interesting characters such as the flair wearing waitress Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), the closet tough guy Michael Bolton (David Herman), and the enterprising Samir (Ajay Naidu).  Then there is the muttering Milton (Stephen Root) who the company has laid off, but never informed.  These characters all provide an essential part of the story, as they help mirror different elements of the society.  The film also provides an empowering perspective of how some people find a way to dig themselves out of their own miserable existence when things look awful.  Altogether, every aspect of the story such as the score, cast, and story accentuates the terrific comedy that blends societal issues with dry everyday humor in a bellyaching manner.",1130457600,4,4716,5.13202614379085

Nothing here disturbs the serienity of our hero, and his quest to do absolutely nothing, in the hopes that it wiil be everything he thought it would be.....

Watching this movie, about engineers in their mid-20's, brings back so many memories  of how it was for me being an engineer in my mid-20's, trying my best to adapt myself to corporate lifestyle, clumsily chasing women, and trying desperatly to enjoy the last shreds of my fast-fading youth.

There are so many priceless scenes in this movie--Ron Livingston is on a date with Jenifer Anniston, when she askes him the dreaded question ""what do you do for a living?""  What software engineer can't help but cringe along with our hero?  Just exactly how are software engineers supposed to answer that question?  Heck, our bosses can't even comprehend what we're doing.  Any attempt to explain will inevitably make us appear geeky and then boring, but we can't just lie,  can we?

On the topic of lying--my wife (who works in P.R.) claims that engineers are incapable of lying--and  that is what is holding them back :-)  This movie of course has to document the inevitable doom which falls upon our hero when he boldly tries to lie like no engineer has lied before...

But the best metaphor of the movie, IMHO, is poor Milton, who, at a corporate birthday party for the boss,  has to keep passing along slices of birthday cake to everybody else--the cake, symbolising the rewards gotten from submitting yourself to corporate life--the cake passing right under his nose.  He can see it--he can almost taste it--and he has earned it, by submitted to the endless humilliations, both large and small, of corporate life.  But the cake keeps going, going, right under his nose, passing him by, untill its all gone.  Just like my lousy stock options.

Peter (Ron Livingston) spends every day in a cubicle, doing pointless work under the thumb of his smarmy boss. His life is boring, and he doesn't even have the confidence to tell the pretty waitress (Jennifer Aniston) that he likes her. In an effort to relax, he accompanies his controlling girlfriend to a hypnosis session. Unfortunately, the hypnotist dies of a heart attack... while Peter is still under.

The next morning, Peter wakes up happy and laid-back -- and determined to get out of his rotten job, and live fat and happy. He conspires with Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and ill-named Michael Bolton (David Herman) -- two coworkers who are about to be axed -- to skim money off the company's assets with no one the wiser. Only problem is, their scene is rapidly spinning out of control.

""Office Space"" started off as an early 90s animated skit, featuring the character of Milton. You know, that increasingly deranged employee who complains that ""you took my stapler."" This time, Milton is a minor character, although a pivotal one. The focus is mainly on the mellowed-out Peter and his wild scheme to profit the downtrodden employees of Initech.

Judge creates a hysterical tangle of cubicle workers, layoffs and the most annoying boss in the history of film (""Yeeeeeeaaaahhhh... uhhh...""). This brand of humor is twisted, down to the slow-motion, ghetto-style beating of the copier in the middle of a field. And of course, the dialogue is quietly insane (""Oh, and next Friday... is Hawaiian shirt day..."") as the plot grows ever tenser.

The trio of lead characters are a riot -- there's Peter, whose newfound perspective is immensely entertaining. There's Samir, who can barely restrain his rage at his rotten job. And there's Michael, who has a seething resentment that he has the same name as THAT singer. Jennifer Aniston does a pretty good job as a love interest for Peter -- a waittress who hates her job as much as he hates his.

""Office Space"" has become something of a deserving cult classic -- funny, strange, and sympathetic to the ants that toil in their cubicles. Make more movies, Mike Judge -- especially if they're as good as ""Office Space.""",1128729600,3,2473,4.904306220095694

There are also fine performances by David Herman and Ajay Naidu as Livingston's co-workers.

He's an enormous talent and this movie is dead on target.  Virtually anyone who has work in an office can identify with out of control birthday celebrations, the joy of working in a cubicle, the big bosses creeping around, and the unGodly threat of consultants.

I remember my own meeting with a consultant.  Talk about bubble-brained.  I'd love to get paid for a job like that.  And oh..the timesheet thing and multiple job codes.  I swear Judge must have visited the place where I USED to work!  Anyway we've got Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) working to update Y2K software for the company he works for.  He hates it...he's bored with it...and his bosses keep hounding him for TPS reports.  One day he just decides to not show up for work.  He's not quitting..he just isn't going to go anymore.  He comes in finally to pickup his address book and has his meetings with the consultants played marvelously by John C. McGinley and Paul Stewart as the ""Bobs"".

Peter explains how he comes in late and only does about 15 minutes of real work in a week.  The Consultants immediately see him as management material and want to promote him!  Classic!  Richard Riehle as Tom Smykowski has a classic meltdown when he meets with the consultants screaming, ""I HAVE PEOPLE SKILLS...I'M GOOD WITH PEOPLE!!!  WHAT THE HELL'S THE MATTER WITH YOU PEOPLE!""  Gary Cole steals the show as smarmy, do-nothing boss Bill Lumbergh whose shallow politeness makes you just want to poke his eyes out.  When Peter finds out two of his buddies are going to be laid off they hatch a plot to infect the accounting software with a virus and move money into an account they've opened.

Jennifer Aniston is Joanna who has her own work problems working for one of those generic bar & grill type restaurants and Steven Root is tremendous as the sheepish, squirrely Milton who was supposed to have been laid off five years earlier but was never told.

Judge obviously has a great grasp of the office environment and his biting satire of dealing with the firing of employees ought to serve as a swift kick in the butt for all greedy corporate upper management.

It is perfect in that so many people can relate to it.  It also has a brilliant, understated edge to it that grows on you as the movie keeps going.

It is the story of a vastly overworked, inefficient office that is bursting with problems right under the surface.  Our main protagonist takes some advice and visits a hyponist, whereupon all sorts of trouble ensues.  Eventually, things culminate in one of the workers getting some gasoline and burning the whole building down to the ground.

Sharim has problems with the copier which he wants to throw out the window, Michael has problems because his name is the smae as a singer (Michael Bolton), and Peter has ""a case of the mondays"" and just wants to stop working.

It is obvious that Mike Judge has talent with satire, and this film makes me hope that he plans on producing more in this area in the future.

Eventually, the movie pushes the satire to the back-burner and concentrates on telling a romance story with Jennifer Aniston. When it does, the movie loses a little steam as their relationship is simply not as interesting as watching characters like Lumbergh, the receptionist or the waiter with the perma-smile on his face.

1048563,5,6305499365,"What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said?

I wasn't particularly interested in ""Office Space"" when it first came out, and I assume that it was a sleeper hit upon theatrical release, but when I checked it out much later, I was on the floor laughing. Not only does ""Office Space"" stand out as a great comedy for those starved of great comedy, but manages to hit closer with those actually victimized by white-collar occupations. It's suprising how this evolved from a series of cheaply-made animated shorts, starring the squirrely stapler-obsessed Milton, and into an underestimated masterpiece.

Some would say that a comedy doesn't really require top-notch acting to get its hilarity across, but ""Office Space"" is a grand exception. Ron Livingston is perfect in the role of Peter, who learns that by doing nothing you can find the ultimate happiness and confidence you seek (thanks to unreversed hypnosis). Gary Cole's portrayal of the boring yet frightening Lumbergh should be added to the pantheon of best screen villains ever, and Stephen Root was simply born to play Milton.

Mike Judge obviously felt compelled to split open the unexplored injustice of white-collar slavery and definitely makes it work. This isn't a gross-out comedy full of outrageous behavior (I don't know if the bludgeoning of the copy machine counts), but if you want to unwind after a tough day of school or work and enjoy a downright funny-as-hell movie, you're making the right decision to owe this one a few bucks.",1115769600,,1515,4.980237154150197
1048564,5,6305499365,"If Seinfeld is a show about nothing, then Office Space is the hit comedy about one man's ""dream of doing nothing""... Arguably the best work-related comedy ever written, Office Space follows the life of Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston), a computer programmer in his late-20's who hates his mind-numbing job at Initech Corporation where he updates bank software for the year 2000 switch.

Peter is joined by fellow computer programmers Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and Michael Bolton (David Herman). All four men are plagued by the condescending, soul-killing management techniques of their boss, Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole) who begins every utterance with a protracted ""Yeah..."" Completely unhappy with his job and his romantic relationship, Peter whines about his life with his co-workers while drinking coffee at local restaurant, Chotchkie's, where he's infatuated with a beautiful waitress, Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), who is forced by her boss to wear ""pieces of flair"". Samir and Michael encourage Peter to ask her out, but Peter is too paralyzed by life to do anything about it.

All that changes, however, when Peter visits a hypnotherapist with his girlfriend. In the act of sending Peter into a state of total relaxation, the hypnotherapist suffers a heart attack. His untimely death leaves Peter in a perpetual state of relaxation, providing his life with a much needed injection of enjoyment. The next morning, Peter sleeps through work, dumps his girlfriend, then goes and asks Joanna out to lunch. Peter and Joanna hit it off, and he reveals to her that he's simply going to stop going to work.

After a good week or so of neglecting his job, two independent consultants - Bob Slydell (John McGinley) and Bob Porter (Paul Willson) - reveal to Peter that he's being promoted to the upper ranks of management. Meanwhile, his studious co-workers Samir and Michael are slated to be canned. Armed with this insider information, Peter approaches Michael about concocting a previously mentioned computer program to take the remainders of every bank transaction at Initech and funnel them into a private account owed by Peter, Samir, and Michael. Michael is reluctant until he finds out that he's going to be fired.

As the two set out to convince Samir that their plan will work, resident office weirdo Milton Waddams (Stephen Root) is in the process of having his paycheck stopped by the consultants who uncover the fact that Milton was fired several years earlier but is still being paid. When Bill Lumbergh moves Milton's desk into the basement, he whispers that he will set the place on fire.

Meanwhile, long-time corporate cog Tom Smykowski (Richard Riehle) experiences the dream of a lifetime when he's badly injured by a drunk driver. Fresh off a seven-figure settlement, and in possession of his prototype ""jump to conclusions mat,"" Tom tells Peter to hang in there, that life has a lot of good things in store for those who wait. While attending a party for Tom, Samir and Michael grow nervous when Tom's lawyer reveals that white collar criminals go to federal ""pound-me-in-the-ass"" prison where they better ""beat someone up or become someone's bitch"" on the first day.

Office Space is one laugh after another, and the heroes' nefarious plan works surprisingly well until it hits a glitch. When the scheme devised by Peter, Michael, and Samir goes up in smoke, Milton decides to create some smoke of his own...

The brainchild of King of the Hill and Beavis & Butthead creator Mike Judge, Office Space will leave you in absolute stitches. Funny from beginning to end, with a plot mysteriously similar to Superman 3, this is one movie that anyone who's ever worked a job from hell (and haven't we all?) needs to see at least once. But if you've ever spent a day trapped in the confines of an office cubicle, you need to see this movie at least twelve times...

1048582,5,6305499365,"When I was twenty four I had the most awful job and the most horrible boss in the world. I used to come home every night and weep tears of rage and frustration that my life had shoved me into this hideous corner ruled by an unpredictable, illiterate control freak .  She (sorry - this feels good - maybe I should let it all out) was one of those horrific people who is appalling at communicating and yet believes themselves to be a ""people person"". With a slight grasp of management speak  she would jumble metaphors and clichs ""You've got to be on board about this"" whilst gesticulating in a strange half-knowledge of body language intended  both to put me at my ease and to communicate her assertive demeanour. The  result was a stream of gibberish accompanied by contortions. It would have been amusing if it wasn't actually my life.

""Office space"" was a source of enormous comfort. I mean- I was really bad at my job. What my boss lacked in communication skills I could match with poor organization and sadly this prevented me from feeling too hard done by. Peter, ,  - the main character in the film -is perfectly alright at his job. However  he is constantly chided by his eight bosses for putting the wrong cover on a set of reports. Attention to detail was never my forte. I'm with Peter all the way.

He works in  a cubicle surrounded by ghastly people. A woman with a really annoying voice. A strange sociophobe who has a weird attachment to his stapler. A dreadful boss who begins each sentence with ""Hey, what's happening"". American for ""can we have a chat"". Christ I'm glad I don't work in an office any more. His job is made tolerable (just) by  two fantastic mates - Samir a foul-mouthed Muslim who taught me some new ways to swear and a marvellous geek lumbered with the name Michael Bolton.. There's a love interest too: Joanna - the waitress at the local them ed restaurant (played by Jennifer Anniston). Just in case we wondered whether working in a restaurant were any better than in an office, Joanna shows us that she too is hostage to a moron boss, shoved into a hideous uniform and forced to wear stupid braces with badges on and supposed to charm the customers with non stop driveling banter to give them the ""experience"" they expect along with their burger. She's got a vile colleague as well-  brown nosing, back stabbing and irritating.

In a road to Damascus moment Peter decides that all he wants from life is to ""sit on his ass"". He starts to skive work, be rude to his boss and do flap all. But, the management consultants - brought in to do some routine ""cutting out of dead wood"" decide to promote Peter and sack his two friends. The boys create a computer programme to rip off the company in revenge and I shan't tell you any more in case I spoil the ending. It's great.

If only the characters were less believable. Even the cultural differences couldn't stop me recognizing a previous co-worker in every single scene. Apart from the one I would definitely have copped off with  -a blond, sex-obsessed frat-boy, from whom I learned the phrases ""take a ride on the bone rollercoaster"" and ""I'm gonna show her my O face"".

1048586,5,6305499365,"If you dig the works of creator Mike Judge, there is no reason why you should hate Office Space. This is possibly one of the greatest comedies to come out during the turn of centuries.

Basically, the scene of this movie is in the everyday workspace, with a small cubicle and pure boredom. Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) is getting really tired of it, so with the help of buddy Samir and Michael Bolton (no, not the no talent assclown Michael Bolton), they basically try to do whatever it takes to screw Initech over. From Peter removing a wall from his cubicle to transmitting a virus throughout Initech's network, they want to cause their boss Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole) trouble.

Another important character to this movie is Milton Waddams (Stephen Root). He has had his desk moved 4 times and his red Swingline stapler taken, plus he never receives any more paychecks. When he doesn't receive any of Lumbergh's birthday cake and he is moved downstairs to storage B, he threatens to set the building on fire.

Other important qualities to this classic movie include Peter dating waitress Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), who hates her job because she ""doesn't wear enough flair"", and Peter's blue-collar nextdoor apartment mate, Lawrence.

Oh yeah, also, you have the unforgettable fax machine destruction sequence, when Michael Bolton is just furious and wants to destroy that thing. (""PC Load Letter? What the f**k does that mean?"")

Ron Livingstone is perfect, Jennifer Anison makes up for the travesty that was ""Friends"", and Stephen Root provides more laughs than you can shake a TPS report at.

One of the most-quotable movies ever, ""Office Space"" had an inauspicious run in theatres, only to absolutely explode on home video. Now with an enormous cult following, the film is still not receiving the accolades it deserves. In ten years, this movie will be looked upon as we look upon the all-time classics of comedy today.

The movie shows waht happens when consultants are hired to ""aid"" the company: all the company wants them to do is to fire employees.

But this movie is not funny. It's low budget, of course, but that's not the point. Livingston is not a very brilliant actor, and his performance is boring.

1048660,4,6305499365,"If they made a live-action ""Dilbert"" movie, it might resemble ""Office Space"" -- a hysterically funny office film by Mike Judge (of ""Beavis & Butthead"" fame). Filled with quirky characters and a hilarious employee rebellion, this is a movie for anyone who ever felt trapped in a soul-destroying job.

Peter (Ron Livingston) spends every day in a cubicle, doing pointless work under the thumb of his smarmy boss. His life is boring, and he doesn't even have the confidence to tell the pretty waitress (Jennifer Aniston) that he likes her. In an effort to relax, he accompanies his controlling girlfriend to a hypnosis session. Unfortunately, the hypnotist dies of a heart attack... while Peter is still under.

The next morning, Peter wakes up happy and laid-back -- and determined to get out of his rotten job, and live fat and happy. He conspires with Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and ill-named Michael Bolton (David Herman) -- two coworkers who are about to be axed -- to skim money off the company's assets with no one the wiser. Only problem is, their scene is rapidly spinning out of control.

""Office Space"" started off as an early 90s animated skit, featuring the character of Milton. You know, that increasingly crazed employee who complains that ""you took my stapler."" This time, Milton is a minor character, but a pivotal one. The focus is mainly on the mellowed-out Peter and his wild scheme to profit the downtrodden employees of Initech.

Judge creates a hysterical tangle of cubicle workers, layoffs and the most annoying boss in the history of film (""Yeeeeeeaaaahhhh... uhhh...""). This brand of humor is twisted, down to the slow-motion, ghetto-style beating of the copier in the middle of a field. And let's not even get into the dialogue (""Oh, and next Friday... is Hawaiian shirt day..."")

The trio of lead characters are a riot -- there's Peter, whose newfound perspective is immensely entertaining. There's Samir, who can barely restrain his rage at his rotten job. And there's Michael, who has a seething resentment of the same-named singer. Jennifer Aniston does a pretty good job as a love interest for Peter -- a waittress who hates her job as much as he hates his.

""Office Space"" has become something of a deserving cult classic -- funny, strange, and sympathetic to the ants that toil in their cubicles. Make more movies, Mike Judge -- especially if they're as good as ""Office Space.""",1107043200,2,2414,4.918918918918919
1048661,4,6305499365,"A few years ago, monster.com instantly became famous with a Super Bowl commercial that featured a group of little children dreaming about growing up to hold unrewarding, miserable jobs.  The kids said things like, ""When I grow up, I wanna file all day...I wanna claw my way up to middle-management...I wanna be a Yes-Man.""  ""Office Space"" tells the story of a group of workers who hold such jobs.

Peter, the film's lead character, suffers with the realization that his work has no meaning.  To his company, the workers are simply cogs in the machine, interchangeable and unnecessary.  Their salaries and benefits convince them that they cannot live without their jobs, so they pretend to love their work, constantly justifying and rationalizing employment that numbs the spirit.

Peter describes his life as a never-ending string of days that continue to trump the previous with degrees of misery and angst.  He comes to work late, avoids his boss and tries to do as little work as possible, taking pride in the hours each week he spends ""spacing out"" in front of his computer.  He works with equally miserable employees who spend their days dreaming about destroying the copying machine and longing for the former model of stapler that the company once used.

After a Jerry Maguire-esque epiphany, Peter decides office cubicle life is not for him and the action of the film is set in place.  His rebellion against his place of employment creates an ironic twist, as his forthright disdain for the procedures and protocols of the company earns him a reputation for honesty and outside-the-box thinking.

A subplot grows from Peter's infatuation with a local waitress who finds herself in an equally unrewarding job.  Her boss paradoxically pressures her to seek individuality that conforms to other employees.  She has no problem finding common ground with cubicle slaves who spend their days doing just enough to keep from getting fired.

Politically, the film lashes out against jobs that force workers to constantly repeat tasks and procedures until they can do their jobs without thought.  The duties drain workers of creativity and uniqueness, building a graveyard of zombie-like beings who spout out acronyms and lingo in robot-like monotones.  Those familiar with this type of work environment will find the film to be painfully funny.",1106438400,3,2343,5.0942408376963355

All of the usual office politics, personnel clashes, annoying bureaucracy, ever-present red tape, silly rules / policies and the fixation of management on meaningless matters.

While watching this movie I sometimes almost felt like I was AT work myself.  A few of the incidents brought back vivid memories of instances that I've experienced.  I'm sure that most people who work in an office will find a whole lot in this story that they can relate to, just as I did.

The one big name in the cast is Jennifer Anniston (big hair and all!) who portrays a fed-up waitress.  She doesn't have too many lines but she is the one bona-fide celebrity who appears on the screen.  I don't recall seeing any of the other actors in anything else.

If you're a white color worker (and perhaps even if you're not a white color worker) then this film is certainly worth a look.

I didn't see the movie until this past year and that was when I started to appreciate this movie. I work for a huge mortgage company which basically I would not recommend taking out a loan with given the way they treat their customers which is horrible, not to mention their employees too. What I see in ""Office Space"" is basically a mirror image of the BS I have to suffer at the office on a daily basis.

Ron Livingston is hilarious as Peter Gibbons who begins out in the movie stressing out about everything that is going on at his job but after he is hypnotized (which eventually goes awry), Peter stops giving a darn about his job and starts slouching off. Yet that lazy, sloth mentality of Peter's manages to get him far ahead in the company while other people are being screwed over by the company (which I can definitely relate to). Gary Cole is hilarious as the patronizing, condescending jerk of a boss. His line deliveries cracks me up because they come off sounding pleasant yet the message is not so nice, like coming into the office on the weekends. That I can also relate at my job to which scares me. Stephen Root as Milton was even more hysterical. If anything should be learned from Milton is that be careful of who you push around because you never know what could happen. LOL! I love the pieces of flare that Jennifer Aniston has to wear at a TGI-like restaurant. I cracked up when her boss implied that good employees wears lots of pieces of flare (which are basically cheesy buttons).

Peter(Livingston) hates his job. He has the most annoying boss anybody could ask for and he  drives Peter nuts. Peter can't stand his job and his goal is to do absolutely nothing. He wants to do nothing and so he goes to a hypnotherapist to tell him about his problem. After an accident during the session Peter quickly finds himself stuck in his new dream of euphoria.

Layoffs are happening at Peters place of employment Intec. He is expecting to finally get laid off, but ends up with a promotion while his two best friends at work are scheduled to get fired. The three refuse to take it and come up with a stratedy to get back at Intec. They come up with a computer program that steals the extra cents from checks when they round down on the numbers in writing them. It's similar to the plot of Superman III. The plan backfires in Peters face and he is also struggling with his relationship with Joanna. He now must fix everything or wind up in jail.

The movie is great. A lot of people won't enjoy that much, but for those who work daily office jobs this is one of the greatest movies you'll ever see.

If you enjoy a good comedy (with an edge to it) and want something a little different from your run of the mill funny movies, give Office Space a try.

1048723,4,6305499365,"""Office Space"" gives a hilarious point of view of a cubical office job where one day you just get sick of working all together. After working over time, getting less respect and less recognition, Peter Gibbons decides he will take no more of it. This movie really will make anyone laugh their socks off let alone those who actually have cubical jobs that they go to everyday.

 Ron Livingston and Jennifer Aniston make a great couple in the movie and even add a short love story to the plot, although never really hinting at even loving each other. Stephen Root and Gary Cole bring out your stereotypical roles of the ""nerd"" and the ""foreign co-worker"" which adds more comedy to the everyday workplace. Peter (Ron Livingston) does a great job of portraying what many cubical workers really want to do, just stop working and caring about their job. This movie does a terrific job of creating a comical view of an everyday office job and anyone that has ever worked any job can relate and have a ball watching it.

 This movie is definitely one that can not really be compared to any other movie. You have to go out and see it for yourself. This type of ""office comedy"" can be extremely funny when used as it is in ""Office Space"" and no movie duplicates it.

A movie like this could be compared somewhat to the comic ""Dilbert"" since one of the characters in the movie is actually based of the comic. The character Milton plays the role of the nerd in the office and does a good job of being the one who is always overlooked and criticized. Milton, although he doesn't play a very important role in the movie adds a great sense of office comedy to the plot.

""Office Space"" is a great movie and although it is for a mature audience many families can still enjoy it together. I can watch this movie over and over again and I think it will really stand the test of time. You will love ""Office Space"" and every hint of office comedy that people see everyday.",1097452800,3,1952,4.43854748603352

1048757,5,6305499365,"The satire in this movie is brilliant. There are a ton of people out there that experience the things parodied in this movie everyday. I for one, have fallen victim to the soulless corporations that bring in so called ""efficiency"" experts to ""clean house"".

""Office Space"" depicts characters so accurately that it's scary. It starts off with everyone trying to make it to work on time on a Monday; first getting stuck in rush hour, then dealing with several self-righteous bosses, then having a chipper red head remind them that it's Monday before they settle into their cubicles for the day. Their is almost a deja vu effect for the people that have experienced these things. Ah yes, it's a depressing feeling knowing your wasting your life away in a cubicle updating bank records for the year 2000 switch; which is also a hilarious scenario in the film, since nothing happened to computer systems when the year 2000 hit. The characters in this movie make it great. Milton mumbling ""Have you seen my stapler?"" to Bill Lumbergh's manipulative soft spoken a-hole-of-a-boss character.

Another thing that makes this movie hilarious is all the rap music that's played. It's not softcore rap at all. It is very explicit hardcore gangster rap in many cases. One scene in the film where they are smashing a printer that they have always hated in the middle of a field with a rap song chanting ""Die Mother Fu**a, Die Mother Fu**a, Die"" is one of the funniest ideas I've ever seen a in a film.

The only part that was a bit uncomfortable was the foul language, which makes it a bit tough to view with your kids and family.

The best part was Steven Root, who played the role of the hapless Milton.  He played the part so well that I thought this guy Steven Root must really be like that until I saw him again in the movie ""Dodge Ball"" - he was totally different in that movie!

Anyway, I went through the whole movie and transcribed everything that I could hear Milton say from the movie:

But I...I said I...I don't care if they lay me off either because I told...I told Bill that if they move my desk one more time, then...then I...I'm quitting, I'm going to quit.  And I...I told Dom, too, because they've moved my desk four times already this year, and I used to be over by the window, and I could see the squirrels, and they were married, but then they switched from the Swingline to the Boston stapler, but I kept my Swingline stapler because it didn't bind up as much, and I kept the staples for the Swingline stapler.....oh,  no it's not OK because if they make me, if they take my stapler, then I'll... I'll have to... I'll  set the building on fire.......

But, no... I was told that I no longer had to move... there's no room....but ...what...but OK... I could set the building on fire.

I... I  didn't receive my paycheck this week....I did... and they said,  no,...I was told they could no....but... no.... but there's no space.....but...no.... I was told that I could stay...uh....excuse me....eh.... I believe you have my stapler....

OK, but last time I didn't receive a piece.... And I was told that I could...OK... if...but this .... If ...if  there's...there's ....I can't see....the cake.....there's lots of cake....but so many people... the ratio of people to cake is ...too many.... too many people....the cake is moving...there's a piece of cake........I could set the building on fire....

No, that's really not my job, and I...I haven't received my paycheck this week......[lights are turned off]...  Excuse me...excuse me...  OK, but that's the last straw.....

Mr. Lunberg told me to talk to Payroll, and then Payroll told me to talk to Mr. Lunberg, and I...I still haven't received my paycheck, and he took my stapler...and he never brought it back, and then they moved my desk to Storage Room B, and there was garbage on it....and I don't appreciate....I can to talk to Mr. Lunberg...OK...but....but...  I'm just going to have to take my stapler back, because it is my stapler ....and I told...it's my stapler the Swingline...that I've been using for a long time...

Excuse me, excuse me, senor , may I speak to you Please!  I asked for a Mai Tai, and they brought me a Pina Colada...and I said no salt, NO SALT for the margarita, but it had salt on it....it had big grains of salt...if I see it on top again, I won't be leaving a tip....cuz I could... I could...shut this whole resort down...Sir!  I could take my traveler's checks to a competing resort....

The reason why many people have liked this film is because it touches upon an issue that is very common amongst people: hating work!
Peter Gibbons, played by Livingston, is our hero who is hassled by more than one manager about some memo that he says he recieved but forgot to implement, and hates the fact that his manager always picks on him to come in on Saturdays to finish some leftover work. One day, Gibbons goes to a shrink who hypnotizes him into a complete state of relaxation right before he, the shrink, has a heart attack. Peter becomes carefree. He goes to work when he feels like it wearing jeans and sandals. He even decides to stop going to work, stop paying his bills, and gets the courage to speak out calmly like everything is cool.
What happens next is up to you to find out.
If you seriously are being hassled at work by your employers, annoyed by everybody and everything from your obnoxious co-workers to that stupid printer that always jams, I really recommend you watch Office Space.

1048869,5,6305499365,"It's very abnormal for a movie made by Mike Judge with Jennifer Aniston as a co-star to be so profound, but this movie manages to define and brilliantly satirize day to day life for all of us who don't really get any satisfaction from our work.  From buzzword-dropping tech yuppies, to waitresses, to construction workers, Office Space captures the dull, clock-watching doldrums of work for millions of us.
The movie portrays Peter, a software engineer who couldn't care less about his job (it takes place in 1999 and he's updating bank software for Y-2k) and considers himself a wimp because he always just takes things-from his cheating girlfriend coercing him into skipping poker night to his condescending jerk of a boss asking him to ""go ahead and come in on Sunday too"".  He undergoes ""occupational hypnotherapy"" to help him cope with work, and in a twist of events, Peter is permanently caught in a trance in which he loses all inhibitions about his job-and everything else.  This is where the movie begins to express its brilliance in satire.  Peter is in a trance, but this ""altered state"" really makes him just be himself and to be assertive instead of just conforming and caving in.  He soon abondons his Kafka-esque existence and stops going to work, dumps his nagging b**tch of a girlfriend, and gets the courage to ask out a disgruntled waitress (Aniston).  Peter inspires everyone around him through his own form of civil disobedience-skipping work, dissing his corporate douche of a boss Lumburg (yeaaaahh...that'd be greaeet), and gets promoted for it, while his conforming buddies lose their jobs in a downsize.  They also come up with a scheme to rip off the company which goes wrong-but the plot of this film is rather arbitrary.  The great thing about the film is that it sums up our lives for millions of people who crank out their 8 hour days and dread the next, living for the weekend and hoping they don't have to work extra.  It captures all characters from the various workplaces, from the condescendingp buzz-word uttering corporate boss, to the patronizing restaurant manager, to the overly enthusiastic sleazy waiter, the office gossip, the weird guy, and the sugary sweet cheery girl who says things like ""a case of the Mondays"", the movie has them all.
Throughout the film, comic relief is offered by Peter's mullet-haired, beer drinkin' construction worker of a neighbor, who seems to be the only person in the movie who really has things figured out.  He loves his life, because he gets to work outside and feels no real obligation to his ""career"".  This is another brilliant satirical point of the movie-the one character who is happy with his life is the one that most white collar people are quick to ridicule-the ""uneducated manual laborer"".  Lawrence is absolutely hillarious and makes the movie for me.  ""Hey Peter man!  Check out channel 9, it's the breast exam!  Whhoo hooo!""
In the end, Peter realizes that his dreams in life have absolutely nothing to do with what he does for a job, or what his ""social status"" is.  As far as work goes-he dreams of doing nothing (or as close to it as he can so long as the bills get paid).  He ends up working with Lawrence and hitching up with Aniston-and a happy man.
In America too many people are obsessed with their careers, their houses, their cars, and all the other crap that really doesn't matter if you have a miserable existence.  Office Space reminds us that there is an alternative-and that is what makes it so great.",1088294400,4,3509,4.781456953642384

Not exactly for the younger set (the movie has lots of profanity, drug, sex, and crime humor -- and quite a bit of cynicism), but OH SO FUNNY!  Kind of like a Python movie, with so many hilarious moments and quotes.
All the other reviews describe the movie pretty well.  Others have mentioned Fight Club as a better movie to see, but there are simply no comparisions.  They're both about how the workplace affects the main character, and that's about it.  Both are good movies -- but this is a comedy, and Fight Club is a darker suspenseful drama -- they're just so different, so it's not really fair to compare them in any way.

1048874,5,6305499365,"Mike Judge's profound comedy ""Office Space"" has a surprisingly large amount of layers to its foundation. Perhaps one of my personal favorites, ""Office Space"" explores the daily struggle of Peter Gibbons, played brilliantly by Ron Livingston, a computer programmer at Inatech Corporation. Day in and day out, Peter and his co-workers Michael Bolton (David Hermann), and Samir Naenanagadd (Ajay Naidu) are subjected to the same treatment, with tedious requests from those in upper management, mainly Bill Lumbergh, played to perfection by Gary Cole.  Peter longs for a life other than his own, where he is not confined to a cubical, following the same time consuming, miniscule procedures from 9-5.
  Finding he can take little or no more of this abuse, Peter enlists in the help of a hypnotherapist. Peter is put under a spell that allows him to relax and forget about his problems or his unsatisfying career. While still in the transe, the hypnotherapist collapses and dies, leaving Peter in a state of utter contemptment. As a result he does not show up for work the next day, and does not convey any emotion when his girlfriend reveals that she has been cheating on him. He shows up to work in sandals, asks his dreamgirl (Jennifer Aniston) on a date, and shows the upmost disrespect for management. Still, somehow, after a meeting with the efficiency experts, the ""Two Bobs"", including another typical enthusiastic performance by Al McGinley, Peter is offered a promotion due to his honesty, ""It's not that I'm lazy. It's that I just don't care"". On a side note, amazingly enough, this is the message I had been trying to convey, but could not find the words to do so.
  Upon learning of his promotion, he is informed that his two friends, Michael Bolton, who made a drastic mistake when asking to simply be referred to as Mike, and Samir, whose unfortunate last name can not be pronounced by anyone, are to be fired. When brought to the attention of his pals, they form a plan to steal a large amount of money from the company through a computer program. But when Michael makes a severe mistake on a ""Monday detail"", their plan falls apart.
  Peter's journey on self reflection continues with the subplot focusing on his relationship with Joanna, a pretty waitress played by Jennifer Aniston, who also revolts against her demanding employer (a cameo by Judge) and his fixation with ""flare"". Perhaps the highlight of the film occurs in which Peter completely rebels against authority, as he steals Lumbergh's parking spot, knocks over the walls to his cubicle, and places fish guts on top of the dreaded ""TPS Reports"", all while ""Damn it Feels Good to be a Gansta"" by the Getto Boys is playing.
  In the end Peter avoids jail time, and begins a job working construction, thanks to an unsuspecting Milton, the abused co-worker played by Stephen Root. This movie is much more than a comedy, although it can be viewed as only such. However, I feel that this film has an inspiring message for the average man. Though we can't all be millionaires and have careers we enjoy, it is still possible to make the best out of a potentially bad situation. For Peter, it was Joanna. ""I may never be happy with my job. But I think I could be happy with you"". This is a great film with standout performances and inspired dialogue.

1048875,5,6305499365,"Anyone who has ever worked in a corporate environment, an environment necessitating the need for cubicles, needs to go out right away and pick up a copy of ""Office Space."" Created, written, and directed by Mike Judge-the same guy responsible for ""Beavis and Butthead""-this 1999 movie perfectly captures the innumerable torments of the modern white-collar worker. The film did poor box office during its theatrical run, but has since become a massive cult classic on video and DVD. It's no wonder. The movie is funny, cynical, and is the only film in my opinion to adequately use rap music to great effect. To give you an idea of how popular this movie has become-my own mother has heard about the movie and made me rent it so she could watch it. Yep, when your own aging mom knows about a movie, you just know it has jumped the boundaries of a narrow audience and become a pop culture phenomenon. For those poor souls who waste the days of their lives imprisoned in a small box in some generic looking office building out in the suburbs, ""Office Space"" is the best way to channel your rage. It sure beats going postal, at least.
Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingstone) is the moral and physical center of ""Office Space."" This young guy works at Initech, one of those late '90's computer tech firms that sprang up across the country like weeds. Peter hates his job, hates his bosses, and hates sitting in his cubicle listening to annoying co-workers. He especially despises Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole), a vice-president of the company who takes great pleasure in asking Gibbons to work on the weekends even as he hassles him endlessly about those ""TPS"" reports. The problems don't stop there, though. Peter's girlfriend is a controlling personality with a decidedly loose sexual reputation. Gibbons trudges through his days, finding solace only in two sympathetic co-workers named Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and Michael Bolton (David Herman). His neighbor in the apartment next to his, a construction worker named Lawrence (Diedrich Bader), provides an occasional breath of fresh air as well. Peter Gibbons's life is a complete disappointment, an endless march of days doing nothing more than updating computer programs for Y2K and sitting around in his generic apartment watching Kung Fu. Something has to change before Peter goes off his rocker, and after he visits an occupational hypnotist, it does.
After Dr. Swanson (Mike McShane) dies suddenly in the midst of hypnotizing Peter, Gibbons is a changed man. He saunters into work whenever he feels like it, wearing casual clothes and ignoring his bosses. He finally asks out Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), a cute waitress working at a restaurant called Chotchkie's, after months of indecision. After a midday fishing trip, Peter guts his catch on a huge stack of TPS reports. Something is definitely wrong with this guy. His friends worry about his reckless behavior, especially with a couple of consultants-the two Bobs-hired by Lumbergh to pare down the company lurking in the background, and try to shake him out of his malaise. Peter is undeterred and, when he learns his antics have actually garnered him a promotion while the consultants consign his two pals to the unemployment line, hatches a plot to bilk Initech out of a boatload of money. Predictably, the plans go horribly long, leaving Peter, Samir, and Michael in a desperate situation. Will the three survive to work another day? Will Peter find the fulfillment he's been seeking for so long? Will Bill Lumbergh ever quit saying ""mmkay""? These questions, and many others, will find resolution at the conclusion of ""Office Space.""
I'm not even going to waste time describing in detail the huge number of characters, all of them brilliant, who populate the universe of ""Office Space."" Obviously, Milton Waddams (Stephen Root) deserves special mention since he constitutes an entire subplot of the movie. Based on a series of short cartoons Judge made for ""Saturday Night Live"" in the early 1990s, Milton is quite a character. You'll either love him or hate him; I liked some of his shtick (the stapler, the cake), but thought he detracted somewhat from the main plot involving Peter Gibbons. What really stands out in the movie is the immensely quotable dialogue, some of it arguably the best lines in motion picture history (paraphrasing here):
""Somebody has a case of the Mondays!""
""He [Lumbergh] represents everything that is soulless and wrong.""
""Ha Ha-he's not related to Bill, is he?""
I could go on and on. For instance, the sound Peter makes when he learns from Joanna that she did indeed have a relationship with Lumbergh is priceless: it's the sound a person makes when the very essence of their being is wounded. The fantastic dialogue and horrifically true aphorisms virtually demand repeated viewings of this movie. Everyone who works should own a copy of ""Office Space.""
I've never met anybody who doesn't like this movie. Even my mom got a chuckle out of it. I drop anything I'm doing to watch it whenever it shows up on cable television. It's quite sad the film did poorly at the box office since a sequel, while it probably wouldn't have been as good as the original, could still have been great fun. Unfortunately, the DVD version of the movie is poor, with almost no extras worth mentioning. I'm praying the studio will release a special edition DVD at some point in the future with commentary tracks by Judge, Livingstone, Cole, Herman, Root, and other critical cast members. No other film in recent history deserves such a release more than ""Office Space."" Yes, it's that good.",1086652800,,5605,4.938559322033898

1048938,3,6305499365,"A pleasant and witty surprise, ""Office Space"" is an offbeat and enticing comedy that presents a glimpse into the boring, dull and predictable corporate world. This movie wisely focuses the tedious and mundane situations that occur in multiple offices today, delivering an amusing and realistic cast of characters.
Ron Livingston plays the average mid-twenties guy who suddently gets terribly bored with his job and decides it`s time to call it it quits. This event will lead to some funny and interesting situations, making for an entertaining and true-to-life (even if a bit cartoonish) cinematic experience. Director Mike Judge, whose previous work includes MTV`s ""Beavis and Butthead"", knows how to create a clever and intelligent movie with a lot of dead-on observations about the daily and mundane routines.
Although ""Office Space"" displays a certain low-budget feel, the acting is very convincing and the characters are quite an achievement. Sure, this film hasn`t great camera tricks, a stunning photography or a superb soundrack, still it works well and stands as an above-average comedy. The comical approach is low-key, delivering subtle and ironic observations and avoiding the typical and predictable slapstick tendencies that are presented in most comedies today. It also shares a couple of similarities with the famous comic strip (and TV series) ""Dilbert"", where one`s job is boring as hell.

Milton is a hilarious character with his constant mumbling and you do start to feel bad for him.  Peter's job is to update the computer software for the Y2K switch.  That's funny because now we have an even better feel to how meaningless is job actually was.  This is one of those movies that I can watch everytime its on TV, no matter where I catch it from.

1048942,4,6305499365,"Well, I've heard about this cult classic film since I began working in corporate America.  It seemed that everyone quoted this movie, from the ""Didn't you get the memo?"" to the famous fax machine scene.
I finally got my turn with it last night and was in tears with laughter.  The opening scene with gridlock traffic voiced the pain of millions of commuters and showed the promise of more venting to come in the movie.  With my recent move to cubicle land, I was ready and waiting.
To my surprise, this movie actually had a plot.  They developed very humorous office parody in the opening scenes, but I expected that parody to go on for a long time.  Instead, the movie introduces the 3 parallel storylines:
 - anticipated lay-offs at work with consultants being brought in
 - Peter's experience with a career hypnotherapist (he's the main character)
 - Milton's being pushed to the brink of insanity
As the story unwinds, the characters show what ordinary people can do when put in almost inhuman conditions - working on top of people, boring work that doesn't really contribute to anything, inane bosses, an absence of any incentive to work harder, having 8 different bosses, lay-offs not based on merit, being asked to move cubicles continually, etc.
More than anything, I appreciated the films ability to continually laugh at itself.  When the 3 main computer science guys consider money laundering, they have to look it up in the dictionary...and they ask how smart guys like them can be so bad at crime when so many stupid people in the mafia are so good at it.  These guys are who we would be if we were stuck in that situation.  Sure, we've heard all about money laundering and such, but who knows how to actually do it?
While the movie winds down to a predictable and satisfying ending, I think it works well for this film.  I don't think the magic of the film is its proposing an answer for the white collar worker.  (Ditch digging anyone?)  Instead, I think the genius of it was to express and magnify to humorous proportions the lives of many Americans.  It does this well, and thus earns four stars (especially when all the swears are bleeped out).",1076976000,7,2161,4.65

Peter Gibbons (Livingston) works at Initech, a software company like thousands others, in a thankless job checking lines of code for the Y2K glitch. He's numb from all the stupid, meaningless work he and his co-workers, Michael Bolton (no, he's not related to the singer) and Samir Nagheenanajar (""No one in this country can ever pronounce my name right!""), have to do. He has the ber boss, Lumbergh (Cole) who makes him work saturdays and who pays very little attention to what Peter says or does. There's also Joanna (Aniston), the waitress from Chotchkie's, the restaurant next door who Peter secretly likes, but has never had the guts to talk to. There's even the consultants, Bob and Bob, who are downsizing the company.
Office space is a really fun movie and has gained a little bit of a cult following (especially Gary Cole's character). It also has a great soundtrack, with very clever use of some rap songs.

1049077,5,6305499365,"Despite its status as a modern ""cult classic"" and its frequent replays on cable TV, many people have still not seen Office Space, one of the funniest movies of the 1990s.  Written by Mike Judge (best known for his television work on Beavis & Butthead and King of the Hill), Office Space is a spot-on spoof of what it is like to work in corporate America at the end of the twentieth century.  Ron Livingston plays a Peter Gibboons, a young professional at a software company who is utterly drained by his Dilbert-like existence.  During a hypnotherapy session, he expresses a phrase which crystallizes the work-life of hundreds of thousands of Americans: ""ever since I started working, every single day of my life has been worse than the day before it. So that means that every single day that you see me, that's on the worst day of my life.""
In notable supporting roles are: Jennifer Aniston as Peter Gibbons' girlfriend who works as a waitress in a vaguely familiar restaurant where ""flair"" is more important than service; Stephen Root as Milton, the useless, overlooked, middle-aged employee who no one has the guts to fire; Gary Cole as passive-aggressive VP Bill Lumbergh, whom Livingston's Gibbons rightly declares ""represents all that is soulless and wrong;"" Diedrich Bader as Lawrence, Livingston's crude, simple next door neighbor that ultimately shows Gibbons the path to self-fulfillment; and John C. McGinley as one of the Bobs, consultants who have been called in to put a band-aid on the company's problems by doing a time and labor study.
Some of the film's cruder moments with Lawrence & office colleague Drew hearken back to Judge's B&B days, but overall, this is an insightful & wildly entertaining movie that manages to crystallize into 89 minutes the dehumanizing effect corporate America has had on American culture around the turn of the millennium.  Not only does the film speak satirical volumes about corporate America, but it also has great insight into the way human beings respond when they are marginalized and subjugated, particularly the liberation that retaliation brings.
As for the DVD itself, one can only hope that Fox will someday release this masterpiece in a better edition.  The opening menu pops up with an error message that your computer has a virus, a joke that is not funny under any circumstances.  The only special feature on the disc is the theatrical trailer.  Most blatantly absent is a commentary track from the mastermind, director, and uncredited actor in this comedic tour de force.

And we've done a wonderful job of creating ornate illusions to make us think that we're doing something important, or at least worthwhile.
Office Space takes a nice poke at this illusion of meaning, as a modern day hero, with the help of a dying hypnotist, suddenly decides he just doesn't want to do anything.  And that he's thrilled to do nothing.  It makes him whole.  Complete.  Satisfied.  Of course, the last thing our culture wants is for someone to discover the joy of not keeping busy.

1049083,5,6305499365,"Mike Judge's ""Office Space"" is a sharp, satirical film comedy, which takes dead aim at white collar, corporate life and hits the bull's eye. The film is about a young guy named Peter (Ron Livingston), who works in a soulless, high-tech, corporation. He hates everything about his pencil pushing, paper shuffling, numbers crunching job and feels trapped. He hates it so much, that he goes to a 'Occupational Hypnotist' for therapy. But through a tragically, bizarre (and darkly funny) accident he gets a hypnotic suggestion in his brain to no longer give a dam about his job or financial security. With his new found attitude, he basically turns his office upside down.(I love the scene where he guts a fish on his desk!) Along the way, Peter and a pair of frustrated downsized, software engineers (David Herman & Ajay Naidu), conspire to release a computer virus, that will slowly defraud the company of huge sums of money. Unfortunately something goes horribly wrong with the program and the guys must figure out a way to keep the corporate bosses from discovering their crime. When this movie was originally released in 1999 it bombed and quickly left the theatres. But through DVD/video sales & rentals, constant airings on cable television and good 'word of mouth', it became a cult film with a following. I think the reason this comedy resonates within people is because it gets all the details of corporate life... so right. Director-Writer, Mike Judge (Creator of both ""Beavis & Butthead"" and ""King of the Hill"") includes everything from the well manicured but dull corporate parks to the mind numbing fluorescent lighting and the earth toned, cage-like cubicals, that you would love to bang your head against. Judge gives us all the characters you almost always find in the corporate hierarchy including the inhuman boss, the evil consultants,the penny-pinching bean counters, the gossips, the worriers, even the engineers, who think they know everything. This movie totally gets it's topic of 'office hell' and just runs with it! The cast is great all around. Standouts include Gary Cole as Lumbergh,the passive-aggresive, boss you'd love to kill and Stephen Root as Milton, a mumbling, put upon employee with a stapler obsession. Even Jennifer Aniston gives a good performance as a flair-impaired, waitress, who hates her job in a 'Fridays' style restaurant. If you work in an office, you will either laugh or cringe... or do both, while you watch this gut-busting, hilarious movie. Highly recommended!",1072137600,10,2512,5.084745762711864
1049084,5,6305499365,"If you've read most of my reviews, lists, and ""So-You'd-Like-To"" things,, you know that i REALLY, REAAALLLY like this movie... yes sir, this is my FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME! If you've never seen it and you're wondering what my hype towards it is all about, let me give you a little tour of the plot:
Peter Gibbins is an I would assume around the age of 25 year-old office worker who couldn't possibly hate his job more than he hates it now... From the traffic jam in the morning where an old man in a walker makes better forward progress than him, to getting a shock when he touches the door to walk in, to listening to that fat red-haired lady say ""JUUUST A MOOMMEEENNNT"" non-stop, and of course, hearing those 4 favorite words of his: ""Hello Peter,, what's happening?"" from his boss, Bill Lumbergh, played hillariously by Gary Cole, and of course there's also that printer that always says ""Paper jam"" when there IS no paper jam. Then one day, Peter realizes that ""humans were not meant to spend their short lives sitting in a cubicle staring at computer screens all day, listening to 8 different bosses moan on about mission statements"", and just decides, ""I'm not gonna go anymore"", and it all goes downhill from there....... (That's all I'll tell, don't wanna ruin it :)
Other great characters include his 2 friends/coworkers, Michael Bolton (just a coincidence, no relation)- a computer nerd who loves rap music and states that ""I shouldn't change my name, HE'S the one who sucks!"", and Samir, an Arabian who really doesn't like that printer..., and then of course there's the great Milton Waddams, who just wants his stapler back, his paycheck, not to move his desk again, and a piece of cake.. and Tom Smikowski, the old guy who constantly worries about getting laid off, and Drew, the young laid-back guy who just wants to show a girl his OHH face (the ""HOW LUMBERGH F*CKED HER"" thing cracks me up every time :)  But of course my favorite character would probably be Peter's next door neighbor Lawrence, who just wants Peter to ""Check out channel 9!""
This will be a comedy you will easily love and relate to if you have a job or class you really don't like to get up every morning to go to.. trust me, I'VE had plenty of em....
This movie also has some great tunes to go with it- ""I Got This Killer Up Inside of Me"", the song that Michael sings in his car in the morning, that is until a black guy walks by... ""Die Motherf*ckers Die"", the ultimate printer-smashing song, ""Damn It Feels Good to Be A Gangster"", the perfect ""I-don't-care-and-I-feel-great-about-it"" song, and of course, the ""Take This Job and Shove It(I Aint Workin Here No More)"" song played in the end credits is priceless...
If you want a good comedy, you WILL NOT be dissapointed AT ALL! Trust me, this movie has lines that you will leave as quotes for your AIM away messages for years and years to come :)
You can go watch that 'Lizzie McGuire' movie if you want, but,,
in conclusion, I have 6 final words: TAKE THIS JOB AND SHOVE IT!!!!!!
GREATEST
MOVIE
EVER :)",1071100800,10,3041,4.549270072992701

1049136,5,6305499365,"I'm not sure it is essential to have worked in an office to enjoy this film, but I'm certain it will hit home for those who have.  The movie was a complete bust at the box office, which utterly mystifies me, because it is hysterically funny and reflects the experience of millions of people across the United States (and I assume elsewhere).  In an age where companies are seeking to lay off workers at any possible opportunity, this film has perhaps even more relevance now than it did when it came out in 1999.
The humor of the film works on multiple levels, but for me so much of it is funny with a twist of the knife, for much of the humor hints at a much more serious fact:  modern work is genuinely dreadful and alienating.  Perhaps many office workers love their job, but I hate mine, and I assume that I am merely one of millions.  No one in this film has a meaningful job.  Even Lumbergh, though the boss, has an absurd position.  Peter Gibbons is at least able to be honest about the ridiculousness of his plight during the incredibly funny sequence in which he is hypnotized.
The film is a collection of many, many wonderful moments.  I started laughing from the second that Peter Gibbons gets trapped in the traffic jam and is passed by an old man on a walker, and didn't stop until the very end.  The film is a parade of very funny bits, from Michael Bolton and his passion for gangsta rap to Joanna's boss urging her to wear more flair (played by director Mike Judge) to Peter's neighbor who would yell at him through the walls to Peter's bizarre fantasy in which Lumbergh is making love to Joanna holding a cup of coffee in one hand and her ankle in the other to virtually any conversation involving Lumbergh and Milton.  Some of the humor is a bit too broad.  For instance, although I defy anyone not to find Milton's sequences funny as heck, they don't fit in quite as neatly with the satire of the rest of the film.  I wouldn't, however, want to trade them in for a tighter movie.
In a way, this movie has made my life easier to live.  I suspected my job was absurd before seeing this film.  Now I know it is.  But somehow knowing the truth makes it easier to get through the day.",1069804800,389,2198,4.313868613138686
1049137,5,6305499365,"In less stressful times during and immediately after college, I was a huge ""Office Space"" fan.  I bought it on video, watched it a bunch of times, quoted it relentlessly (and still do) with my roommate, and generally considered it to be a funny, intelligent comedy.  I had never actually worked in an office, but I imagined the movie to be a fairly accurate depiction of what the experience is like and what it does to the typical cubicle slave.  In other words, I liked the movie, but in much the same way I liked lots of other movies.
Then, a few months ago, I got an office job with an enormous corporation, and I now see the world of ""Office Space"" in a whole new light.  It's still funny, but there's also a major undercurrent of depression beneath the humor.  The movie's fictional Initech Corp. is a sterile suburban hell, where the bosses have become patronizing phonies and the workers are bitter and frustrated over their precarious, unfulfilling existence.  My job isn't quite as bad, but few hours go by where I don't think of some line from the movie and realize just how accurately it describes what I go through on a daily basis.  Human beings really aren't supposed to sit around at desks staring at computer screens all day, and ""Office Space"" perfectly captures the quiet despair that corporate lemmingdom can produce.  At one point protagonist Peter Gibbons flatly states, ""I don't like my job.  I don't think I'm gonna go anymore.""  I'm sure many would like to say the same thing, but unfortunately in real life it doesn't prove to be that easy.
Viewed in this light, ""Office Space"" could only have worked as a comedy.  For one thing it requires a razor-sharp satire, which this movie very much is, to truly highlight the absurdity of the situations faced on a daily basis in offices nationwide.  For another, if the movie's examination of life on the lower rungs of corporate America weren't lightened with some laughs, viewers would be reaching for arsenic and razorblades in record time.  Ron Livingston brings a definite everyman appeal to the role of Peter: you can sympathize with Peter's plight because you've probably been there, and even if you haven't you'll still be able to feel his pain because Livingston communicates it so well.  Not to mention, Gary Cole gives one of THE most underappreciated performances in cinematic history as Bill Lumbergh, Peter's ""evil, disgusting pig of a boss.""  Sure, Lumbergh's a caricature, but Cole delivers his condescending lines with such perfect tone and expression that they still haven't stopped being funny after about ten viewings.  Plus, in case you need any more reason to watch, the cast also includes the always-hilarious Diedrich Bader and the always-smoking Jennifer Aniston.
As the plot progresses, ""Office Space"" brings in an element of wish fulfillment when Peter decides he has nothing left to lose and he might as well see what it takes to get fired.  For most of its hilarious middle third the movie plays on this strain of insubordination, becoming the ultimate workplace fantasy as Peter disrespects his higher-ups and generally acts destructive around the office.  There's also a scheme to rip off the company thrown in, but that's not really important.  ""Office Space"" is so good the plot is rendered more or less secondary.  Watch it, and drop out for an hour and a half.",1068854400,8,3362,4.82404181184669
1049138,4,6305499365,that would be great! What a classic line! The movie rocks from the initial traffic jam scence to the red stapler to kicking the printer in the open field. There are a couple of cliches though. But the movie is great overall.,1068336000,,224,4.357142857142857
1049139,5,6305499365,"Office Space is the ultimate comedy for bored, middle class, gen Xers (the kind of folk who frequent amazon.com for example...).  Guilty as charged - I love it!  While office comedies in the past typically revolved around the protagonist trying desperately not to lose their job (The Apartment springs to mind...), the everyman in this movie refreshingly doesn't care.  I think this touches a nerve in the heart of everyone who watches it knowing that their life does, or someday will, revolve around a clock, a computer and socializing with a group of people you would otherwise avoid like the plague...
Mike Judge creates a fantastic bunch of characters, largely unsympathetic and weaves a plot around them that, while reminiscent of Superman 3, ends up playing second fiddle to the sharp dialogue, the set-piece sketches and the ironic, but perfectly captured interpersonal relationships that will resonate so intensely with the right viewer.
The only people I've ever heard of who didn't like this film were a bunch of management consultants from London who didn't find it at all funny... It's too close to home and it's too near the bone...
It's also amusing to see how ""Office Space"" has crept into the cultural vernacular - pick up any issue of FHM, Maxim and the like and you'll find plenty of sly references to TPS reports, staplers and ""Ummm....Yeah...What's Happening?"".

He even gets promoted for his ideas while his hardworking friends are being fired.  Jennifer Aniston even ends up being his new girlfriend and she is much better than the first.  This movie is hilarious especially with Peter's two friends from the office and their knack for screwing up royally or just watching them get upset and explode.  Even though it is based on a job done in a cubicle, Office Space, actually makes the job seem fun.  Definitely, this movie is one of those that you will watch once and then eventually find yourself going back for over and over when you stay in for a night.  Not a very good party movie but a definite choice when you want to laugh hard with your buddies or a certain special someone.

1049142,5,6305499365,"This film is probably one of the top ten funniest films I have ever seen. If you work in one of the millions of cubicals in America doing meaningless paperwork for a stupid boss and dealing with idiots for co-workers, you will find this movie hilarious.
Each character will remind you of someone you have worked with in your life (or maybe remind you of yourself). Peter (Ron Livingston) is a computer programmer who puts in endless hours at a job he doesn't like. He is asked by his many bosses to remember the TPS reports need to be done a certain way. What these reports are, no one seems to care. They just have to include a cover letter. His 2 best friends at work struggle with a copymachine that eats their papers. Some of his other collegues dream of making it big and leaving the company. Some have been beaten down so long by corporate culture that they go a bit nuts. Milton is a freakish little man who keeps getting moved to a worse desk. Milton mumbles and slowly plots his revenge. Will he have the guts to do it?
The boss, Lumbergh (Gary Cole) is a total jerk played with an uncany resemblance to every idiotic ""manager"" I've ever had. He swills coffee, talks about 'mission statements', and basically cannot manage anything. His ""M-Kay"" response to everyone is about all he can say coherently.
There is a nice subplot with Jennifer Annison as Peter's girlfriend who labors unhappily at her job as a waitress. Even in the service industry, the workers are subjected to their own moronic co-workers and judgemental bosses. The only one happy with his job seems to be Peter's neighbor who works outside in the fresh air as a construction worker.
The movie has many themes. I know some will dismiss this as a light comedy, but I feel you can read into things. Peter's lapse from good employee mindlessly droning on to a man who does his best to be fired, yet becomes promoted is very ironic. ""The consultants"" in the film remind me of other corporate types who really haven't a clue how to fix a darn thing.
This is a funny film. You will be quoting it for days after!
But, I urge you, if you have seen it on tv in its edited form, you have not seen the full story. Every time I caught it on tv, major scenes were cut off and I didn't quite get it. You have to see it on DVD or video. It is worth every penny.",1063929600,2,2322,4.352534562211981
1049143,5,6305499365,"Peter Gibbons ( Ron Livingston)is fed up with his life and wants to make a change. He decides to try hypnotism, to put him in a better mood. However, the hypnotist suffers a heart attack and dies right before he can snap Peter out of the trance. Now Peter doesn't have a care in the world, and is determined to get fired from his boring cubicle existence at Initech Corporation. Armed with a leisurely new attitude, and a sexy new girlfriend (Jennifer Anniston), he goes out of his way to neglect his job. However, this is where the story gets interesting, because it quickly gets Peter promoted into upper management. His two friends Samir Nayeenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and Michael Bolton (David Herman) always play by the rules. Unfortunately, they are fired due to cutbacks. So to get even, Peter and his two friends devise a plan to rip off the company.
This is one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen. Everyone can relate to the story, because at one time or another, you have hated your job and wanted to do something about it. The characters in this movie, actually get to live out that fantasy. The acting is great all around. Ron Livingston is hilarious as Peter. Everything he does to upset his bosses and neglect his job is outstanding. David Herman and Ajay Naidu are extremely good as well. However Gary Cole gives the film's best performance as Bill Lumberg. ""Uh Yeahh Peter...What's Happening."" He goes out of his way to make the employees miserable, from having them work on the weekend, to stealing poor Milton's stapeler, and moving him into the basement. Jennifer Aniston does a nice job as well. Watching her fight with her boss over the pieces of ""flair"" is priceless. The two Bob's played by John C. McGinley and Paul Wilson are hilarious! Last but not least is Stephen Root as Milton. His obsessions with his stapeler and his overall personality will make you laugh and feel sorry for the guy.
""Office Space"" is a comedic masterpiece. We can all relate to the story, the laughs are non-stop, and all of the actors are fantastic. My only question is - Why couldn't FOX put out a better DVD? With how funny the movie was, you know there had to be tons of outtakes, and plenty of deleted scenes. So where are they? There are absolutely no special features whatsoever. To make things even worse, the presentation of the film itself was barely above average.

Although seemingly aimed at Gen-Xers, Office Space resonates with us older folks too. The characters and situations are hilarious, the dialogue wittily unexpected (""during these conjugal visits.... can you have sex with a woman?""), and the only people who seem content with life are those who don't do too much thinking--like Peter's neighbor, a happy-go-lucky construction worker whose sole concerns are naked women and beer.

Ron Livingston is Peter, one such cube dweller at Initech, a corporation we never learn much about (I think they develop banking software).  It's not important, of course, because Initech looks and feels like so many offices in so many industries all across America.  Bored to tears at his job Peter undergoes hypnosis at a therapist and suddenly snapping out of his routine, breaking up with his corporate girlfriend.

The trio of friends, tired of being the little guys, hatch a scheme to funnell money slowly and secretly from Initech.

Office Space is a must for anyone who has ever worked in an office.  Sat at a cubicle.  Wanted to take a fax machine into an open field and beat it with a bat while blasting Ice Cube.  It captures American corporate microculture perfectly, laughing in the face of being micromanaged to death.  But it touches on unversal elements and the laughs are steady, captured in the details like the boss everyone hates, or rap music in suburbia.

I think the main reason why it is so funny is that the characters are completely the opposite of the stereotypical ""office nerd"" who works in a cubicle every day and has no life or sense of humor (much less friends...)  Also, I love how they listen to rap music-- the usage of the rap throughout the movie, again, is against the stereotype (light jazz, anyone?).
Another aspect of the film that is hilarious is how the situation is perfect for the main character to be defiant to his superiors.  The plot is set up so perfectly that you just can't help thinking during moments of brilliance ""this is so awesome!"" like when he's gutting the fish on his desk or parking in his boss's parking space.
It's these little details and things that really make you laugh the hardest-- I am so glad I rented this movie-- check it out as soon as possible!",1054771200,3,1023,4.373684210526315

The only people I can conceive of disliking Office Space are company presidents, CEO's and complete morons. But, being part of America's office-working automata (and not being a moron), I can relate. I could go on all day about the great jokes, great soundtrack and great characters, but these aren't what make this movie truly great. As paradoxical as it may seem, Mike Judge's true stroke of genius was making a movie that speaks to the majority. Most movies are either fantasies, portrayals of the ultra-elite, or simply gross exaggerations by studio execs of the audience's point of view. For example, movies like The Lord of the Rings are fantasies, where any connection to the viewers' lives is purely metaphorical. Most romantic comedies involve the super-rich and/or the super-attractive, and any romantic struggles these people encounter come off insincere. Finally there are movies like 40 Days and 40 Nights, where some jaded producer thought he could play to the audience's own sexual longings by portraying a protagonist who goes a whole month without intercourse. Right. How many of us can't relate to the anguish of going a month without sex? Call it 40 Score Days and 40 Score Nights and I might begin to take interest. But back to Office Space. This movie appeals to most of us: lazy, underappreciated, unattractive people who hate their jobs and curse at office machines. All of us have felt like Peter Gibbons at one time or another. And this somehow makes our jobs slightly more tolerable, knowing that we're not alone in the corporate dirge. Peter is our hero, our messiah. We all wish we could come to work late, leave early, ignore our boss, dress down, and rip the company off big time...big time. Before this movie, there was no model, no one to show us the way. And, even though few of us will ever reach the level of enlightenment that Peter has, at least we can dream.... Pass out at our cubicles and dream.",1054684800,3,2106,4.741144414168938

It is low key as opposed to slapstick comedy. I think the movie was well cast about a cube dweller who had enough and basically quits working and gets a promotion to upper management while his hard working and dedicated buddies get slated for layoffs by ""The Bob's"" two management consultants.
Ron Livingston does a great job as Pete Gibbons, and Ajay Naidu as ""Samir Nu, ne, nunu, uh nnn ,not work here anymore"" David Herman as Micheal-why should I change - Bolton.
The boss Lundbergh is played perfectly deadpan by Gary Cole, and I think there is a Tom Smykowski and Milton Waddams in every organization. Lets not forget the ""Bob's"" I knew two idiot consultants just like them.

But everything goes wrong, of course.
Office Space is definitively a hilariously funny comedy, from which it is difficult to extract boring or flat scenes. It is also a refreshing satire of anti-social views about the workplace, in a movie world where hatred of all things corporate is commonplace (which is to be expected, I suppose, given that no one in Hollywood needs to work in cubicles for a living, so they can badmouth it all they want).

You have to pay attention to the film and really be interested in what's going on. My third - and final - reason for being why this film is really good is simple: it's clever.

That's what makes the movie so delightfully funny: seeing characters on screen act out (without much exaggeration) the trials and tribulations of today's desk-bound workforce.
The plot of the movie itself is somewhat secondary to its entertainment value.  Basically, the main character (Ron Livingston) isn't happy with his job; having been asked once by his high school guidance counselor to picture what he'd do without being paid and consider that his ideal job, he responded that he's like to sit around and do nothing.  The rest of the main plot centers on his attempt to get his life back on track, from discovering a love interest in a local waitress (Jennifer Anniston) also unhappy with her job to plotting revenge on his company for firing his friends.
Quickly one sees exactly why the characters are so unhappy with their jobs: a clueless, paper-shuffling boss who speaks in total monotone; inane office regulations requiring more time spent on reports than on real work; faulty office equipment; and so on.  Carefully crafted to represent archetypes we all know from our own office experiences, the characters and their attempts to break free of the 9-to-5 drudgery are absolutely hilarious.
You don't have to be a computer programmer or engineer to enjoy this film--all you need is to have worked somewhere once in your life that was far from the ideal environment.

Pretty much everyone who has had to work in a cubicle will find something they can identify with in this film. Office Space uncannily recreates and satirizes situations most of us have had on the job, whether it is the ominous threat of a reduction in force, listening to corporate gobbledygook or dealing with a smarmy jerk of a boss.
The difference between those of us in the real world and Ron Livingston's character is that he loses all cares about his hated job and actually strikes back at the corporate powers that be. As such, the first half of this film is absolutely hilarious. We vicariously live out our dreams to smash the jam-prone printer, knock out a cubicle wall, and skip work for a day of fishing. Fortifying the movie are quirky supporting characters - a white computer geek who listens to gangsta rap, a perpetually cheery temp, a mumbling weirdo, and so forth.
The movie does begin to drag a bit during the second half, as the story moves away from office rebellion, to a floundering embezzlement scheme. Nevertheless, this movie has something for almost everybody who has worked in the rat race, and is just the right thing to watch after a bad day at work.

My favorite performance is Gary Cole as the boss, Lundberg.  He has the corporate clone down to a T, and he perfectly embodies the boss who knows nothing but how to navigate corporate politics.  And Stephen Root is a scene steeler as Milton.
The DVD, on the other hand, is just a DVD.  No extras to make it worth your while.  I recommend renting until it's re-released. (And films this popular generally are).

Plain and simple Office Space should be lot sharper and funnier than it is.
The subject of office life is loaded with opportunities for truly funny comedy, but this movie only generated a few laughs (usually of the wry, snickering, `who-does-that-remind-you-of' kind).  Most of the stuff you've seen before, and even 9-to-5 did a better job of it.
Stephen Root, a truly superb comic actor from `NewsRadio', is unrecognizable here in both physical appearance and talent.
Jennifer Aniston is equally wasted, so badly that I thought surely this film must have been made before she became a star (wrong, OfficeSpace was made AFTER her success on Friends; can't understand why she agreed to be in such a mediocre flick).
The only saving grace was the always excellent Deitrich Bader (from The Drew Carey Show), but even he couldn't save the worn jokes or the meandering plot.
I saw this movie when it was shown at work (yeah, some companies have a sense of humor about themselves), so I can say it's better than working, but I sure wouldn't pay to see it or rent it.  You'll get more laughs out of a week of Dilbert cartoons.",1038528000,2,1313,4.8053097345132745

Whether you are seeing the consultants, or efficiency experts, interview people before the lay-off; listening to the sing-song voice of the customer service representative, or watching the employees get mad at the fax machine; this will all seem eerily familiar.
Quite a few of the scenes nod to other movies of popular culture, as well as sate our thirst for revenge against work.  This mixture makes from some memorable images.  The camera work used as the conspirators initiate their plan or ""celebrate"" their lay-off is hilarious.
My problem with the film is that it feels great as a series of short films, but as a whole movie, it doesn't hold up as well.  Although Mike Judge (who wrote, directed, and acted here) forecasts what would happen in the end, it still feels like ""deus ex machina.""  It feels like he couldn't think of how to end it, so he just threw this in.  It does take some suspension of disbelief.  The argument between Peter and his girlfriend also seems a little contrived.

I worked in the software industry for just one year and I am still able to relate whatever happens in this movie to my daily routine. The ""PC-Load Letter"" printer, the efficiency experts, the manager with the coffee mug.. man ! everything has been so accuratly portrayed ! Yes.. life as a software engineer does become monotonous so quickly that you will start searching for an psychiatrist, as Peter does.
I did not like the ending of the movie and the little ""techno-heist"" that these people plan. The movie was funny and hilarious till the last few scenes and somehow became a little dull and boring at the end. Maybe the directors thought that it is compulsory to have some sort of a story in the movie... just for the sake of having it. (Not a good idea at all...)
Gary Cole (Bill Lumbergh), Ron Livingston (Peter), Ajay Naidu (Sameer) and David Herman (Micheal Bolton !) have done an excellent job, while Jennifer Aniston doesn't impress much.. Maybe that's because of her script or something.

1049768,4,6305499365,"Office Space, starring Ron Livingston and Jennifer Aniston and directed by Mike Judge (the creator of Beavis and Butthead), is indeed a very funny comedy about work and how boring it could be. For a straight hour and a half you'll be treated to a pure helping of jokes, each which will succeed in making you laugh. With pure Beavis and Butthead humor, Mike Judge's comedy is a winner and deserves to be seen by all comedy fans. Featuring a good cast that includes Stephen Root and John C. McGinley, Office Space is a comedy that you must go out and rent now! Satisfaction guaranteed.
Ron Livingston plays a character named Peter Gibbons, a computer guy who works at a company called Initech. He has eight bosses so every time he makes the smallest mistake, he is commented eight times. After several incidents, Peter becomes stressed and decides to go for therapy. When he comes out he decides not to go to work and start enjoying his life.  He tries to spend more time with his girlfriend (Aniston, The Good Girl) and only comes to work to wreck stuff and play games on his computer. However, this attitude lands him a promotion and some of his partners get fired. Anxious for revenge, Peter and his partners decide to perform a scam to steal money from this computer company. Every time the company transfers money, they will get a fraction of every penny. However, instead of the fraction of a cent they're supposed to get, they wind up with over 350,000 dollars. Now, they must figure out away to get themselves out of this situation and not get Gibbons fired.
I won't wreck the ending for you but this truly is a great comedy.  The performances are satisying.  Ron Livingston, who we don't see much these days, gives a very good performance as Peter and Jennifer Aniston provides us with a good performance as a waitress and Peter's girlfriend.  John C. McGinley (starring now in the TV show Scrubs) gives a star-making performance as one of Peter's bosses and there are several cameos by people such as Orlando Jones.  The movie is destined to become a comedy classic if people would just not miss it when passing the comedy section at the video store.  Maybe it is a bit over-rated but you still got to see it. Mike Judge is simply a comedic genius. The only bad part about it is that it didn't go on. Comedy fans, this is a must for you.
A satifying and hilarious comedy!

To be a bit cruel, the concept for this movie came from a short animated clip done by Mike Judge (of Beavis and Butthead and King of the Hill fame).  It was well received, and converted into a full length film.  Because of those beginnings, some times this movie feels a bit like 3 stories pasted together and they made up one continuous 'thread' to tie the plots together.
Notice that this doesn't hurt my rating of the video at all!
I find I associate with Peter Gibbon's hatred of working in a cubicle, the need to just 'get away' from it all.  Of wanting to do things for yourself in life.  This movie, unwittingly, ends up describing ME and how I feel about my life!
There's one line in the movie, after Peter skips work all weekend, he wanders into work late on Monday to get his address book.  His best friend explains that he's in a lot of hot water, and what has he been doing?
Peter replies ""I did absolutely nothing, and it was everything I imagined it could be"".

The movie is actually ingenious with a great story, plot, and a terrific cast of characters.
Peter Gibbons is living through Hell twenty-four-seven.  He works for a corporation that has eight bosses barking orders at him everyday.  It seems like it just gets worse everyday.  Well, that all changes when his eyes are open and his mind is at ease.  He realizes that the answer to his solution is to not care anymore.  And that's exactly what he does.
I loved everything about this movie.  All of the characters are unique in each way.  But I must say, Milton steals the show.  The mumbling man is played by the very hillarious Stephen Root.  He really is the show-stopper.  Keep a close eye on him.
This movie is so realistic, it hurts.  Especially if you work at that kind of an environment.  Come on, how many times have you been stuck in traffic and it seems like everyone is moving except for the people in your lane?  This movie takes all of the elements that take place at a work place and magnifies it a hundred times over.  It's so funny....it's painful to watch at times.
The DVD could've been better.  No eye-popping special features.  It's a shame, since this is such a great movie, and is loved by a lot of people.  Still, it's the CONTENT that counts.  The picture and sound quality was really good.
""Office Space"" is a hillarious laugh-riot that will hook you from the start.  Check it out as soon as you can.

1049831,4,6305499365,"When I first saw ""Office Space"" in theatres  I was more than happy with the results.  The word funny can't really help you grasp the hilarity of this movie, and if you haven't had the chance to catch it yet don't delay any longer.  It often escapes me why this movie didn't bring in millions at theatres, instead it ended up becoming a cult classic among teenagers and adults alike.  Mike Judge did an excellent job with a movie that never ceases to have me in stitches, while Ron Livngston's portrayal of Peter is picture perfect.
The DVD however is another story, it lacks many features that are deserving of such a classic movie.  Besides a scene selection screen, theatrical trailer, Dolby Surround sound and Language selection this is a lacking DVD.  The least they could of done is thrown in the ""Milton"" shorts created by Mike Judge that the movie was loosely based around.  I'll admit it's refreshing to see such a clear presentation, my VHS copy has become old and worn after many viewings.
Like I've said the movie is great, the DVD is a little rough around the edges and could of used more features.  But if you have the choice between this and VHS format, spring for the DVD version, the quality is noticeable, and hey at least you'll have scene selection.",1025222400,12,1268,4.579646017699115
1049832,5,6305499365,"Every few minutes, I kept saying, ""I have LIVED this movie. I have WORKED with those people. I have SUFFERED in that cube farm."" And I laughed. I laughed harder than I've laughed at a movie in years. I laughed because it's dark and raw and cynically funny, not because it's what passes for comedy these days (raunchy sex and language that would make a sailor blush--though that can be funny too; see JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK for a great example).
Mike Judge (of BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD and KING OF THE HILL fame) brings to life a Dilbert-esque fantasy through the eyes of everyman Peter Gibbons, cube farm dot-com slave working on fixing the Y2K problem and hating every moment of his miserable work existence. He's got eight bosses (one of whom is played by Gary Cole in a performance so magnificent that you will wonder if he shadowed your boss for a few days to get acting tips--he's that realistic), all of whom jump his case whenever he makes mistakes. He's surrounded by the lady with the annoying voice, co-workers cursing at a broken fax machine, the old timer who sees layoffs around every corner...and Milton, the weird guy we've all seen in our offices, the mumbler, the nervous wreck, the guy we all take bets on when he'll snap and go postal. A visit to a hypnotherapist turns Peter's life around, and he stops caring about his job...just as two efficiency consultants arrive to review company practices and procedures. But instead of getting fired, Peter gets a promotion while his two best friends get fired, and the three of them plot to take their revenge on the nameless, faceless corporation making their lives miserable.
Look for Jennifer Aniston in a very nice small role as a waitress at a TGIFriday-esque restaurant who becomes Peter's girlfriend and learns to stand up for herself at her job. Look fast or you'll miss Orlando (7-Up) Jones in a bit part that is so funny and so real that you'll wonder how long he studied those guys who go door-to-door with the magazine subscriptions. But most of all, look at the atmosphere of this film and marvel at how eerily accurate it is. They say you know your job stinks when you think of Dilbert as more autobiographical than funny; your job is really terrible when you can spot your office in OFFICE SPACE.

Yes, this movie is an overexaggerated look at the corporate world and it does a fine job of really making you feel that the characters in the movie have it pretty bad. All of the stereotypical office people are present, from the annoying operator (""please hold, please hold, please hold"") to the degrading boss. But when people are telling you that's you're going to laugh for hours upon hours, then they obviously have not seen classic comedies like ""Caddyshack"" or ""Animal House"". This movie has many funny moments, but to rank it in the top 10 of all-time comedies is a complete joke.
So do yourself a favor and rent it. You'll laugh intermittently, and for an hour-and-a-half, it's a nice ride. But don't go thinking you're watching the greatest movie of all time.

I feel so strongly about the healing nature of this film, I will often purchase a copy and send it to a friend when they describe a particularly brain fryingly stupid day in corporate America.
And it's also a great quote movie. Watch it and the next day you'll be walking around saying, ""Why should I? He's the one that sucks.""

1049837,5,6305499365,"""Office Space"" is, quite suprisingly, one of the top 3 comedies of the last 20 years in my opinion. It ranks right up with ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Back to the Future"", but is a completely different type of movie.
It is frankly brilliant. It's humor lies in the satirical realism in its portrayal of white-collar borgeois ennui (I was dying to use those words). Peter Gibbons is you and I: a bored and frustrated cubical drone who is surrounded by the most insane yet realistic office envoronment ever shown on film. Every office has these workers in it:
1. The annoying phone-answering voice person. (Mina in Corporate Accounts Payable)
2. The total nerd who thinks he's a tough-guy. (Michael ""Mike"" Bolton, look at his gangsta rap and Navy Seals posters in his cube)
3. The annoying younger guy who is a sexual harassment case waiting to happen. (Drew, the ""oh"" face guy)
4. The annoying older person who is eternally convinced they're going to get laid off (Tom Smigmikowski, the ""Jump to Conclusions"" guy).
5. The easily irritable engineer type guy who can't figure out the copier / fax machine (Samir Naninagaja)
6. The disgustingly happy and content person. (The ""case of the Mondays"" mail lady)
7. The snide, ""method management"" boss who speaks to everyone like they're in 5th grade. (Lumberg)
and of course...
8. The twitchy postal case (Milton)
All of these characters are people we know in our everyday dealings at work. That, combined with the cubical-farm of an office building that is Initech (direct competitor with Penetrode and Initrode) make this film almost frightening. The office is laden with Swingline staplers, walls adorned with lame ""Employee of the Month"" plaques, and ceilings with motivating corporate slogans like ""Is this good for THE COMPANY???"" We have all worked here before!!
The humor is subtle and not at all goofy or in-your-face. Some may not find it as funny (probably corporate stuffed shirts and managers like Bill Lumberg) as those type of films,  but this is an intellegent and hysterical comedy nonetheless. Ron Livingston is a great actor who is just now becoming recognized after his role on ""The Pracice"" and in HBO's ""Band of Brothers"". He plays another great roll in the direct to video ""Body Shots"". The guy who plays Lumberg was also Mike Brady from the ""Brady Bunch"" movies and he is also brilliant.

1049898,5,6305499365,"""Office Space"" is a brilliant and totally spot-on satire of life in an office.  Mike Judge wrote and directed a quirky and unlikely story of office vengance.  The jokes are often subtle...but even the disguised jokes are belly laugh funny.
Using a cast of largely-unknown actors, Judge keeps the laughs coming.  Dietrich Bader (hilariously disguised in a mullet wig and biker mustache) provides a great white trash accent as Peter's goofy neighbor.  Our hero Peter is played by Ron Livingston.  Peter turns into an unlikely hero, doing what all of us wish we had the guts to do in our sterile office environments.  Peter's work buddies, Zamir Naginnajar and Michael Bolton (no relation) are perfect, played as everyday joes just trying to get by.

The opening seen is hilarious. Peter (played by Ron Livingston), who is stuck in a traffic jam finds himself making less forward progress than an old man with a walker. That's the kind of day Peter's day seems to begin every day with something going wrong.
From there Peter goes to his job as a computer technological company where he always has issues with the boss and the damn copying machine which never seems to work.
When Peter and his friends are frustrated and upset about work their boss says they must have ""a case of the Mondays."" Then they go to the shop next door and order coffee and ask the waitress (played by Diedrich Bader), what she would say if someone told you ""I think I have the case of the Mondays?"" The waitresses reply: HILARIOUS!!!
Michael Bolton, a friend of Peter's, comes up with a ""genius"" plan to make them millionaires in a matter of a few years while screwing their company.
Overall this is a great hilarious and humorous movie with great acting (especially Peter and Milton) that will make you laugh.

Anyone who has ever sat in a flourescent-lit cubicle listening to easy-listening music for hours at a stretch, week after week, with nothing to look forward to but more of the same until retirment (assuming you don't get downsized first) can relate to ""Office Space"" -- a surprisingly good first effort from Mike Judge, the guy who produced the lowest of the lowbrow, Beavis & Butt-Head, and later the more subtle ""King of the Hill."" The performances are really good all around: Livingston is perfecto as office-shmoe Gibbons, a passive nice-guy programmer stuck in a boring, dead-end office job who has a revelation that sooner or later comes to everyone in a cube: we only have so much time on this earth, and we weren't meant to spend it this way. Shedding his passive ways, Gibbons rebels against evil boss Lumbergh (great performance by Gary Cole) and recruits two pals, the unfortunately named Michael Bolton (David Herman -- ""Why should I change my name, he's the one that sucks!"") and Samir, to help him loot his place of work of a few hundred grand in cash, and sets out to win the girl of his dreams (Jennifer Aniston). The soundtrack, mostly gangsta rap hits by the Geto Boys, is hilariously inappropriate for the setting -- but then again maybe not, since everyone that works at Initech is swallowing a lot of rage (there is a classic scene of skinny computer-nerd Bolton expertly rapping out the lyrics to ""The Diary"" by Scarface in his car). ""Office Space"" is a great commentary on the modern workplace, but it is also a (non-violent) revenge fantasy that will speak to anyone who has ever fantasized about smashing a copier with a baseball bat or telling the boss: ""It's not that I'm lazy, it's just that I don't care.""",1019606400,5,1975,4.744186046511628

It follows Peter, a bored software engineer, as he deals with corporate downsizing, self-important management and bonehead corporate consultants.  Although this movie is set at a software company in Texas, it could have easily been set in any state in most any office.
I actually saw this movie in the theater when I was still in college.  I thought it was funny, but I couldn't fully appreciate the office humor.  That's what makes this movie so funny.  It's not the great American movie, it's not deep and it's not trying to be anything it's not.  It's just a very funny and smart look at common situations and charactatures of people we all seem to have in our workplaces.  I think everyone's gotten to the point where we just don't want to go back to work the next day, and we just don't care enough to tell the boss that we're not showing up anymore.
You definitely won't catch everything the first time you see this movie.  You won't catch all of Milton's (played by the same guy who was the station owner on NBC's News Radio) mumblings about his Swingline stapler and about the squirrels he used to watch outside his window.  One of the corporate consultants is played by the same guy who plays Dr. Cox on NBC's Scrubs, and he has some of my favorite lines as he interviews Peter's friend, Michael Bolton (no need to say more!).  Jennifer Aniston has a minor role, and she simply comes across as a ditzy waitress.

When the company bring in efficiency experts, he starts telling the truth about his deadend job (and TPS reports) and actually gets promoted, while his friends, who are busting their humps, get laid off. Good eventually triumphs over evil and it's all good.

I absolutely love this film, but the DVD itself is pretty bland. There are hardly any extras (trailers don't count), and the DVD edition sorely needs some outtakes. No cast interviews, no director's commentary, nothing.... To make matters worse, I believe the DVD encoding is flawed. I've played it numerous times on my brand new Toshiba DVD player, and sometimes the screen will distort or colors will wash at certain spots in the movie, particularly in the beginning.

1049988,4,6305499365,"After a breif run at the theaters, Office Space has found a renewed and vibrant life on video tape.  It seems that everyone I talk to -- no matter what their age, background, or current job -- considers this film to be a personal favorite, a film that they can especially relate to.  The reasons are pretty obvious.  Everyone hates their job.  Everyone feels that they're working for idiots who fail to understand just how special and unique their neglected employees truly are.  This is something that we all have in common, whether we work for a retail chain or a fortune 500 company.  This is also a feeling that Office Space manages to perfectly capture.
Taking place in Houston in waning days of the 20th Century, Office Space stars Ron Livingston as an affable computer programmer who has found himself stuck in a dead end job that requires him to spend countless hours looking over a code to make sure that various computers are Y2K compliant.  Its a job that makes little sense to him but one that he's expected to devote his life to.  His coworkers are all incredibly (and realistically) annoying.  Who hasn't had to deal with someone like the ""Look's Like Somebody's Got a Case of the Mondays!"" woman?  His boss's (a hilarious Gary Cole) blandly friendly manner brings new meaning to the term ""corporate evil,"" while over in the next cubicle, pasty-faced Milton (Stephen Root, also hilarious) mutters about burning down the building.  Finally fed up, Livington first seeks help from a hypnotherapist, pursues a relationship with a waitress (Jennifer Anniston who is sweetly likeable here but doesn't have much to do) at a generic Chili's-like establishment, and finally engages in a plan to embezzle money from the company.
Obviously, the plot is a little bit ragged and at times, it seems as if director Mike Judge and his actors made up the plot as they went along.  But no matter, the film's quality is not to be found in the plot as much as in how it captures the small, realistic details that makes everyone hate their job.  From the pointless memos to the corporate stooges, Office Space captures them all and sends them up in such a savagely hilarious way that the film serves as a wonderful catharsis for anyone whose just finished a hard day at work.  Office workers will especially appreciate the scene in which Livingston and two recently laid off co-workers take revenge on an irksome xerox machine.  (If not for the fact that children might be reading this review, I'd quote the rap song that plays over this scene but let's just say that its impossible not to cheer as our workers get their revenge.)
Judge, best known as the creator of Beavis and Butthead, directs in an offhand, almost casual manner.  There's a relaxed air about the whole affair and you get the feeling that everyone involved in the film was having a good time.  Luckily, the feeling is infectous.  The film is also well-acted by everyone involved.  Along with Cole, Aniston, and Root, good supporting work is given by Deidrich Bader who plays Livingston's redneck neighbor.  Ron Livingston is the perfect everyman lead for this film and gives a totally winning and likeable performance.
With its portrait of mindless office jobs, Ikea-furnished apartments, and overly intelligent people struggling to find some way to establish some sort of individual identity in a corporate culture, Office Space at times plays like the gentler, slightly more juvenile cousin of Fight Club.  Whereas Fight Club battled modern culture through violence, Office Space battles modern culture through practical jokes and whoppee cushions.  Both films are must sees for anyone who has ever hated having to make a living.",1015891200,16,3694,4.86741214057508
1049989,5,6305499365,"Yeah... Murderously funny movie. So many very strong characters that it just couldn't fail. No surprise, with Mike (Beavis and Butthead) Judge at the helm.
Office Space brilliantly captures the mind-numbing tedium of repetitive code debugging projects in the run up to the December 31st, 1999 deadline. (The M Bug was a genuine problem, in that ANY computer code based on the concept that tomorrow's date must be numerically larger than any previous date WOULD fall over.)
While the superb Gary Cole steals the show as the intensely irritating boss Bill Lumburgh, whose coffee mug never leaves his hand (even when he is making love to Jennifer Aniston in a fantasy sequence), every member of the cast gives 1000%.
Rather than give away any specific details of the plot, I will just add that OS contains many sharp and witty insights into the ritual dance of modern office life, played out by the craziest collection of characters ever assembled in one movie. For that reason, it is scarily close to reality.

Mike Judge(King Of The Hill), wrote and directed this hilarious look at the mundane life of office workers. Peter(Ron Livingston) has a boring life. He lives in a plain, by the numbers apartment with an odd neighbor(Diedrich Bader from ""The Drew Carey Show""), and works in front of a computer all day in a small cubicle. It's the same rut day in and day out. He has a smarmy boss with an very slow, annoying way of speech named Bill Lumberg(Played by the awesome Gary Cole). This guy is pricelessly funny. Many points go to Mr. Cole. He also, in a very funny joke, has a friend that works there named Michael Bolton. Don't think there's not many jokes there!. The company then begins to downsize and Peter's two best friends are on that list, while he is to be promoted. The three guys then set out for revenge and devise a plan to launder funds from company accounts. All seems to be golden, when something goes horribly wrong and the guys scramble to find a solution to save their butts!. Jennifer Aniston also co-stars(and looking cute as ever) as Peter's waitress girlfriend. Stephen Root from ""NewsRadio"" co-stars as Milton, a highly geeky loser who never gets the attention or respect at work. Like Cole, his comedic performance is incredibly funny. The ending kinda just happens real quickly, and one wishes it was a bit longer and more fleshed out. We've come this far!. The movie has many laugh out loud moments that are both hysterical and oh so true!. Who doesn't hate their job, right?. The film hits the bullseye on that front. It's a shame this intelligent film didn't get the recognition it deserved. It is definitley finding a voice on cable and video. Good.

Disclaimer:  This movie is NOT for everyone.  There is a certain level of crude humor, sarcasm, negativity, and irreverence about the whole thing, but if you can relate to the subject matter, that is precisely what makes it a GEM.
Having worked for the real-life equivalent of this movie's evil corporate conglomerate, I was able to relate to this movie in a particularly strong way, which made it a much-needed outlet for me.  From the humorous depictions of corporate ""motivation"" attempts, to the ""evil boss"" who tortures the main characters (even in their dreams), to the sudden lay-offs that send them over the edge, this movie is tailor-made for the white collar working stiffs who live it every day (especially anyone in a technical/computer/programming field).
If you have experienced the forest of gray cubicle walls, the droning, boring corporate meetings, the logic-lacking company policies, the inhuman treatment from management, you will LOVE this movie.  It will serve as an anchor for you to see that you aren't the only one who sees the BS for what it is, and I must say it is a refreshing feeling!

The characters in this movie are VERY memorable.  Samir is probably the funniest side character in the history of cinema.  I've never met an Indian (you know, from India) that was as tempermental as he is, but I hope I do someday.  Michael Bolton is awesome.  The guy is just totally down on life.  The whole cast really shines.  Diedrich Bader has a range to his talent that is just amazing (I didn't even recognize him the first two times I saw the film).
There really isn't a dull moment to the film.  It was cut so well that it just flows from beginning to end.  It's almost too short, but that's what makes it so easy to watch again.  This is truly a movie that gets funnier the more you watch it.  There are little nuances that you tend to notice after repeated viewings.
The only real drawback to the film, and the reason it loses a star, is the fact that the extras are really weak.  There's nothing here that really heightens your appreciation of the film.  I wanted to see deleted scenes (there had to be SOMETHING). I really want to give it five stars, but there are so many other great movies that package equally good extra features.

All the characters and the plot line integrate seamlessly into one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Mike Judge is a genius, and one can see why both of his full-length animated shows were complete hits (Beavis & Butthead and King of the Hill). Another thing that I really thought was great is that this is set in Texas rather than your run-of-the-mill California tech company. Adds a little cultural flair to it, in my opinion.

By taking the insanity of office life to it's logical, but absurd, conclusion ""Office Space"" has created an instant classic for those of us subjected to the ""attack of the MBA's"" on a daily basis.  At its core the movie asks the question we have all asked, ""how much attention is anyone really paying to me?""  As the hero repeatedly does and says what we would all like to, he comes to be perceived as a ""straight shooter"" with ""management potential"".  Likewise, his co-workers represent the gamut of corporate personalities: the inane VP who spews corporate jargon to hide his gross ignorance, the weird guy who seems to operate outside any corporate hierarchy, the useless consultants, the idiotic support staff, they're all there.
The plot of the movie revolves around an attempt exact revenge on this corporation by ripping it off.  But you can take it or leave it, I would have been content just to watch the actors bash corporate sacred cows for two hours.  It's actually almost uplifting because it reassures the viewer that they are not alone in confronting stupidity on the job.
In the end, this is a shallow movie, and the DVD has no interesting extra features.  That doesn't matter though, because it is also a hysterically funny, dead on satire of office life.

But I must say, Mike Judge must know what it's like to be trapped in cubicle-ville.  Truly captures that stilted, HR-arbitrated atmosphere.

The comedy is very subtle and clever - the ""bobs"" are hysterical - I mean - who ""celebrates a guy's entire catalogue""?

There's kind of an early Kevin Smith feel to the whole thing.  Like, Clerks or Mallrats.  By that I mean the characterization isn't super deep and the acting isn't Oscar material, but they don't have to be because the dialogue and situations are on target.  Obviously I don't mean most of us are embezzling, but the set-up and the fantasy are realistic.  It's funny and close to a lot of people's lives, and it's kind of nice to see normalish lives in a movie.  Jennifer Aniston is good, as she generally is, but underused.

In both movies, an average guy one day decides to turn against his mundane and hopeless life to win the day.  It even shares the element of a hilarious goofball whose character is slowly developed in little transitional scenes to receive the butt of some joke.  In Better Off Dead, it was Ricky; and in Office Space, Milton (the character whose short sketches by Mike Judge gave birth to this movie).  David Herman was sort-of ok as Michael Bolton, but I wish they'd cast John Cusack for his part.
The movie focuses on a trio of software developers who do some really stupid things in the face of a company layoff.  The plot isn't great, but what carries the movie is that every scene is darned funny -- most of it is achingly so.
I work at a fairly large software company, and everyone on the technical side there is hip to this movie.  The phrase: ""Did you get the memo about those new TPS report covers?"" has become a pretty standard response.

(Okay, you might not file it next to ""The Godfather,"" but you would definitely put it somewhere between the Marx Brothers and Wes Anderson/Owen Wilson's ""Bottle Rocket"")  Make that comedic masterpiece.  For my money, it doesn't get much better than when John C. McGinley gives his monologue about Michael Bolton, or when Diedrich Bader comes over as the friendly neighbor, or when Mike Judge cameos and talks about ""flair,"" or when vengeance is taken on a certain office appliance... you get the idea.  (As I was making that list, about eight other favorite scenes popped into my head).
If you haven't seen it, give it a try.  If you have seen it and rented it more than twice (or recommended it to all your friends) then do yourself a favor and get it on DVD before it's no longer being sold.  Movies this classic don't come along very often...",1000857600,7,1444,4.649606299212598
1050277,5,6305499365,"I have a theory about upward mobility as it exists in a corporate workplace (actually, I've been relaying this theory for so long that I no longer remember if it is my own, or if I've stolen it from someone smarter than I; If it's the latter, I apologize for my thievery).  If one is ambitious enough, and good enough at their job, they will get promoted.  If they are still ambitious, and good enough at this new job, they will get promoted again.  This process continues until said person reaches the limits of their abilities.  Then they are promoted one last time, into a job that they can't possibly handle.  This is where they stay for the rest of their working lives.  I've seen it happen time and time again at my place of work, and it's this kind of sophistic reasoning that gets spoofed so mercilessly -- and so perfectly -- in ""Office Space"".
Writer/Director Mike Judge has crafted a spot on depiction of office life in the latter part of the twentieth century.  Technology has advanced to such a degree that those who fail to understand it are either relegated to being its slaves (a running joke here has a nefarious fax machine tormenting two programmers) or promoted to management.  Those in the latter category, made obsolete by technological advancements and having no real duties themselves, are relegated to becoming bothersome micromanagers, in the hopes that their stock rises a quarter of a point.  Everyone is worried about job security, and rightly so, for the average worker is about as interchangeable as the coffee machine, and respected less.  And anyone with any semblance of a soul is constantly involved in bemoaning the wastefulness of their lives.
Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingstone) is one such troubled soul.  He's involved in his company's Y2K readiness project (with the benefit of hindsight, the pointlessness of this task is made even more pointed).  But he despises his job.  Tormented by ennui but hampered by lethargy, he sees no way out.  A fateful visit to a career-counseling hypnotist frees him from his shackles, by allowing him to relax into his job.  His newfound candidness is, of course, rewarded with a promotion.  Livingstone imbues Peter with a bland everymaness that is at once appealing and relatable.  He is surrounded by a madcap menagerie of accurately depicted office drones.
David Herman (as the unfortunately named Michael Bolton) and Ajay Naidu play Peter's clueless programmer buddies, rebellious enough to constantly plot against the company, but too scared to do anything about it.  The three of them share my favourite scene in the movie, when the aforementioned fax machine is smuggled out of the office, and beaten mercilessly with a baseball bat.  Judge handles the scene like a hit in a mob movie, or a drive-by shooting, adding aggressive hip-hop music to the soundtrack, to play up the ridiculousness of the situation.  The scene is played as horrific, but turns out truly hilarious.  Other office citizens include John C. McGinley and Paul Willson, who play gleefully insipid consultants, brought in to give the company an excuse to downsize, and Richard Riehle as a paranoid lifer, whose job may or may not be redundant.
The biggest cheers in the cast go to Gary Cole and Stephen Root.  The former plays VP Bill Lumbergh.  He's every employee's worst nightmare: a lifeless, endlessly droning, boring, malicious, and unimaginative manager.  Brought to life through a costume that includes unfashionable glasses, shirts that match collar to cuffs, and an ever-present coffee mug, Lumbergh subtly terrorizes all who serve him with salutations that make him appear interested, but in fact amplifies the apathy he has for his employees.  Cole nails Lumbergh perfectly, allowing the man's slime to ooze from every pore.  Stephen Root, in the film's showiest role, plays Milton, a milquetoast, asocial, ""squirrelly looking guy"".  Saddled with coke bottle thick glasses and an inflamed complexion, Milton is the ultimate social outcast.  Root gives Milton an under-his-breath lispy voice, easy to overlook.  So much so that his repeated threats to ""burn the building down"" if not granted any respect go unnoticed.  The passive aggressive cat and mouse game fought between Lumbergh and Milton over a stapler (!) provide for some of the film's best and most telling moments.
Jennifer Aniston, who plays Livingstone's love interest, does fine work with an underwritten role.  She brings a kind of quirky restlessness to Joanna the waitress (tormented by a witless boss of her own, played by Mike Judge himself), although her desperation shines through as well (otherwise, why would she torture herself working at a classless establishment as ""Chotchkie's""?).
""Office Space"" will touch a nerve with anyone whose ever worked in a large office.  In fact, if you've ever encountered schizophrenic traffic (the film's opening scene follows Peter on his morning commute; he's caught in a hilarious catch-22, as any lane he changes to slows to a stop, just as the lane he's just come from starts to move), been bothered by door-to-door magazine salesmen, gotten zinged by static electricity, or been maligned by any of a dozen other inconveniences of modern urban life, you'll find something here to relate to.

1050376,5,6305499365,"From the standpoint of one who's worked in software for thirty years it is dismaying to see the effect on the younger generation of the real computerized office, for it is either dystopian or perceived as such.
In Office Space, the worklives of TwentySomethings have been  structured by Baby Boomer technical obsessions and Romanticism.  The offices which the Baby Boomers manage are computerized by unrelievedly bad software: the restaurants in which they eat lunch demand of the invisible ""help"" that the ""help"" cater to a commodified freedom and ""flair.""
Of course, this dystopia is dystopia in part because of perceptions.  Certainly, Java or HTML experts fleeing Kosovo in 1999, the year of the film's release, would be delighted to work in air conditioned offices not subject to artillery barrages.
However, Herman Melville's 1850s short story, Bartelby the Scrivener compels us to take seriously the complaint that work is boring and unfair.  In the short story, Bartelby, after years of clerical work (that was brutally boring, owing to the lack of office automation: Bartelby was a human Xerox machine, and even in the 1940s, Microsoft exec Charles Szymonyi was grateful to be hired as a human ""computer""), ""prefers not to"", like the hero of Office Space, do any more fair copies.
Office Space notes the unnoted ability of computer technology to generate absurd work at its margins, for its hero is engaged in manually scanning code for Year 2000 problems.  Now, I'd ask why this fictional character did not write a Perl script (a computer program) to do his job for him, but only to be a smartass: for in the type of organization portrayed in Office Space, ideological control prohibits such vernacular creativity.
Unfortunately, had this movie been resolved at all realistically, there'd be, as they say, no movie.  For in fact very few people seem to ideologically rebel as our hero, who gets a job in construction (as if modern construction itself has not been Taylorized so as to render the construction worker equally subordinate as the computer programmer.)
Here in the Research Triangle Park, it still seems the case that when most people are laid-off or otherwise maltreated by companies like Nortel, they respond by stronger adhesion to individualist narratives and at best form their own firms, wherein they replicate, in the small, the failure to address needs and narratives higher than the individual.
Note that the hero of Office Space does not transform into someone who becomes a team player because he is informed by a mystical vision of the necessity of absolute care-for-others, to name one possibility.  He is at first transformed into the type that our system says it desires: the whats-in-it-for-me individualist.  The consultants like him precisely because he so perfectly ""does"" the entrepreneural spirit: but note that in reality, employment specialists have found that in the actual job market, the person who has in the past formed his own company or in other ways foolishly tried to act out a capitalist scenario is less desired than the long-term corporate type.
Mike Judge does not, in other words, question some core assumptions of the business movie narrative.  Our narcissistic question throughout Office Space is how the hero will fare.
Like Herman Melville, Mike Judge sees no way out and has none of Hamlet's good sense: ""I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself king of infinite space.""
Perhaps this is an important limitation of the way the American Transcendentalists narrated the money-mad lives of their fellow man when in the 1820s it became clear that we were not about to become a country on their model, where instead of working in sordid offices, or on the farm driving the slaves, we'd sit about listening to blue-stockings recite poetry, and Think Uplifting Thoughts.
The real story is not escape from the counting-house or the modern office it is the ability of most real people to be bounded in a nutshell and count themselves kings of infinite space.  Some Americans do this through religion, others through drugs, still others by posting reviews on Amazon.  Redemption consists in the final realization that hegemony for good or ill is here to stay and there really is no way outa this place.

But it's not really a film about people; per se (sp?). It's really a bunch of funny situations with one liners you always wanted to say.

I feel like giving this video to every upper level executive so they can look in the mirror at what phony squareheads their jobs have turned them into.  Humans WEREN'T meant to do the same thing day in and day out until they reach their sixties.  So why do we do it?  Bills, that's why.  I feel depressed after watching this movie, not elated.

1050439,4,6305499365,"There's something about a study of life in a ""cubicle"" to which just about everyone can relate; at least everyone who has ever had to get up every day, go to work and punch a time clock, then go home and wait to do it all over again the next day.  In ""Office Space,"" writer/director Mike Judge (the guy who gave us ""Beavis and Butthead"") captures the essence of the work-a-day world, in this case in an office setting, though it could be on any job anywhere, from the largest conglomerate to the smallest business concern; anywhere a ""corporate structure"" is in place and employed.  The subtle humor of Judge's vision is funny, and often downright hilarious, and all with very little exaggeration of the way things really are, from the weekly ""motivational"" talks from the boss, to staff meetings, corporate ""mission statements"" and the protocol of cover sheets and memos, all of which-- as portrayed here-- have a sterling ring of truth to them.  The central character of Judge's story is a guy named Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston), a software analyst for ""Initech,"" who after working with a therapist finds himself in something of a transcendental state of mind, whereupon he divulges to a pair of consultants-- ""efficiency experts"" sent in to streamline the company's operation-- that he does only about ""fifteen minutes of real work"" a week, due to the very structure (or lack thereof) of the company itself.  And his refreshingly honest candor in outlining his job description soon has quite an unexpected effect on his life, as well as that of a couple of co-workers.  Judge perceptively expands the satire to encompass facets of Peter's life outside the office, as well, which gives the audience even more with which to identify, like driving to work in bumper to bumper freeway traffic that has slowed to a stop-- in Peter's lane-- while the cars in the next lane going flying by; and when he changes into THAT lane, IT comes to a standstill while the cars in the lane he just left start to whiz on by.  It's an application of Murphy's Law that -- while certainly nothing new-- works well within the context of this particular story, in which the humor is derived from emphasizing the annoying, mundane things that happen to us all on a daily basis.  Like getting in the shortest line at the supermarket and taking longer than anyone else to get checked out.  Livingston gives a notable performance, giving Peter that sense of the ""everyman"" who'd like nothing better than to break free of the rigors of the 8 to 5 existence.  He brings an affable presence to the screen that perfectly communicates what Judge is attempting to say, and does it in such a way that it validates Peter's being selected as ""Champion of the Cause"" as it were.  Also turning in memorable performances are Stephen Root (a terrific character actor), as Milton, a guy whose very existence seems to be a study in suffering abuse and degradation; and Gary Cole, as Peter's boss, Bill Lumbergh, whose impudent, laconic methods of intimidation, delivered in such a droll manner, make him the boss everybody loves to hate.  The supporting cast includes Jennifer Aniston as Joanna, the waitress with a minimum of ""flare"" who has trouble ""expressing"" herself, according to her boss; Ajay Naidu (Samir); David Herman (Michael Bolton); Richard Riehle (Tom); Joe Bays (Dom); John C. McGinley (Bob Slydell); Paul Wilson (Bob Porter) and Diedrich Bader (Lawrence).  Reminiscent of the world portrayed in the ""Dilbert"" comic strip, ""Office Space"" works because it effectively puts real people in real situations, and brings you into contact with some characters you're going to recognize; I guarantee that no matter what you do to live, thrive and survive, you've run into these people, worked for them, and alongside them.  It's a case of art reflecting reality, and to Judge's credit he's succeeded in making a funny movie that really hits close to home, without resorting to any gross or infantile humor to do it.  It's a film that simply puts the ""corporate experience"" in the spotlight and gives you a chance to laugh at ""the boss,"" and maybe even a little bit at yourself along the way.",983664000,,4161,4.834036568213784
1050440,5,6305499365,"I don't know what sorts of jobs Mike Judge's work history includes, but if none of them were low-level (re: peon) white-collar jobs in large corporations, I'd be truly surprised. Office Space does nothing less than epitomize the life that anyone who has every worked in 'cubeville' can more than relate too.
Peter, our hero, is the everyman: five years (or so) out of college, a software engineer at the heartless Initech corporation. Every day, he trudges to work to battle with cliche-loving co-workers, eight different bosses (none of whom listen to a word he says), grey cubicle walls as far as the eye can see, and absolute apathy for his work. His friends Samir and Michael Bolton (yes, the name is just a coincidence) live in much the same world of bland mediocrity. What does Peter _really_ want out of life? To do nothing...to relax, sit, and not have a care in the world.
Help for Peter's malaise comes from an unexpected source: his nasty soon-to-be-ex-girlfriend who takes him to a hypnotherapist to help him get a bit more satisfaction out of his life and employment. Instead, Peter leaves the session cured a little _too_ well--Peter now intends to fully live out his dream of doing nothing!
Thus, Peter begins his assault on corporate America, skipping work, pursuing a new flame, and cleaning fish at his desk. Samir and Michael, pushed around by Initech for the last time, join him in his glory with a 'fool-proof' plan for funding their life of laziness.
This movie is much like the 'Dilbert' cartoon strip brought to life. Anyone who has ever worked as a nameless paper-pusher (as I did for three years out of college) behind those grey cubicles will find _Office Space_ an absolute hoot. While the DVD doesn't have many extras, the movie alone (and sitting back, doing nothing, and enjoying it) is worth the purchase.",983059200,,1837,4.798107255520505

Good, restrained performances all around, although the Jennifer Aniston subplot either didn't belong, or wasn't developed beyond the point of giving Peter a way of expressing his thoughts to the audience.
Still, an enjoyable, and sometimes all too familiar parody of office politics and opression.  Let's hope the lackluster box-office success doesn't keep Mike Judge from another attempt.",981849600,,496,5.6

1050509,5,6305499365,"For anyone whose had to deal with a robotic manager who repeates pointless phrases regardless of your response - this is the movie for you. For those of you who trudge to work everyday dreading encounters with chipper co-workers who make mind-numbing conversation - this is the movie for you. For anyone who wakes up every morning with only thoughts of escape on their minds as they get ready to join the commuting masses - this is defintely the movie for you.
The characters are very well developed, hitting the nail on the head as far as office types go. There is a relatable type there for eveyone who's ever worked in the typical ""cubicle environment."" From the opening sequence, where each main character is shown reacting to the daily traffic jam, to the last scene - this movie is hilarious. It ""hits the spot."" It is a cathartically funny look at what life is like for most people in this type of setting.
The dialogue is precious. Almost everything out of each character's mouth is quotable. You'll find yourself repeating these phrases like mantras. After the third or fourth viewing (and you will want to see it more than once or twice), you'll find yourself quoting each phrase along with the movie. You'll bond in brother/sisterhood with whomever sees it with you. It will become ""your"" movie.
Did I mention the soundtrack? It couldn't be more perfect. It gives the movie unity and cohesion in the most comic sense, in that it takes otherwise serious moments and highlights their absurdity through the sheer ridiculousness of the music choice. It points to one character's desire to be someone else; to escape his station in a small way and become another stronger, more willful type.
And, it simply rocks.
The direction is also quite good. There are many nicely shot sequences which run like videos encompassing univeral moments. Particularly memorable is the ""printer scene."" You'll need to see the movie to know what I'm talking about. Also, the focus on character expressions and camera angles which highlight and enhance responses to certain situations are very well done, putting the focus on how the character feels in an exaggerated and caricature-like way.
All in all, a must see. Quite possibly one of the funniest movies ever because of it's honesty and ability to encapsulate the moment.",981331200,9,2312,4.870558375634518
1050510,4,6305499365,"If you have ever worked in a cubicle farm for a technology company, or ROFL after reading Dilbert cartoons, and know what ROFL means, you will love this movie.  Mike Judge (creator of Beavis and Butthead) digs into and makes fun of the things that people hate most about their jobs, with such accuracy that he must have consulted Scott Adams himself while developing the screenplay.
With company names like ""Penetrode"", this movie takes numerous humorous stabs at the idiocy foisted upon the modern working class by the ""management class"", those highly-compensated stuffed-shirts with no more qualifications than an MBA hanging on their wall.  These are the people who abuse you every time you make a mistake, and try to convince you that they are really your buddy in a thinly veiled attempt to keep you submissive and cooperative.  Office Space tears into the very heart of the manipulative phony friendship ploy that so many managers think of as their ""brilliant"" management technique.
So if you're tired of being shocked every time you touch a door knob, and sick of having half a dozen different ""bosses"" giving you conflicting work assignments, then I highly recommend that you buy this movie and blow off some steam, before it's too late!
This film is a lot of fun to watch, but if you're looking for an intellectually challenging work of art, this is not the film for you.  The story is quite simple; it is a single-layer story that conveys the same information on subsequent viewing as it conveyed during the first viewing.  The visual and audio elements are interesting and entertaining, but not artistic.  This is a fun comedy that a lot of people can identify with, not deep social commentary.  However, the social commentary that IS in the film couldn't be more timely.
The DVD itself is mediocre.  No extras to speak of, other than cast bios and one trailer.  Transitions from one menu to another are slightly animated, and the way the DVD starts up is cute, but overall the power of the DVD medium is not utilized.

The idea of a hardcore rap soundtrack for a film about a bunch of white people working in an office would seem ridiculous, but I've rarely seen a better use of songs during a movie.  Right from the start, with Michael Bolton singing along to gangsta rap in his car, the soundtrack was an integral part of the film, rather than a few songs heard in the background during street scenes so they could be included on an album.  I actually was so impressed with the use of music in the film that I didn't catch some of the subtler humor until I watched it a second time.  I'll never get over the perfect joining of the slow motion action on screen during the execution of the scam, with the song 'it feels good to be a gangsta' being played over it.

1050514,3,6305499365,"It could be argued Mike Judge (of Beavis and Butthead fame) may have nothing new to offer since his toon characters have seemingly run out of comedic puff.  Unfortunately, anyone offering this argument in conversation could be well trumped by their opponent whipping out a copy of OFFICE SPACE and dropping it into the DVD player.
You see, this is a comedy for a moment, for a very short time in our history when lots of young educated folk where making some really good money doing ridiculously boring work and reporting to morons.  This movie captures that moment in all it's glorious dullness and then pulls it apart one side-splitting joke at a time.
The lens of the camera is wider than corporate computer jobs though.  Mr. Judge has captured the lifestyle of that time extremely well.  From the ever increasing abundance of TGI Fridays type restaurants, to the painstaking 45 minute, 3 mile commute.  This is a comedy that reeks of 1990's mainstream life.
In terms of quality; acting, direction, and photography are all average but are helped immensely by a sound-track that also captures the musical tastes of the late 90's.  Jennifer Aniston's role as a go-nowhere waitress is passable.  It is the  comedy that makes OFFICE SPACE a great pick.  Clever use (and destruction) of corporate icons combine with cartoon-like characterizations and splendid one-liners to satisfy the humor glands.",979603200,3,1397,4.987068965517241
1050515,4,6305499365,"The Film:
Mike Judge is a genius.  Using a number of relative unknowns he spends 2 hours skewering the people and situations all of us cubicle-dwellers hate at work.  While sometimes slightly uneven in composition, it remains a bravura comedy that'll keep you laughing through to the end.
Peter Gibbons (Livingston) hates his job at Initech, so much so that each day there feels worse than the day before.  But when a botched-up hypnotism session leaves him unworried about his job and other cares Peter feels free to throw caution to the wind, deciding to stop coming in to work.  He's amazed to find that instead of getting fired he's getting promoted while his hard-working friends (Ajay Naidu & David Herman, in the best buddy-buddy supporting actor performances of 1999) are getting downsized.  They together decide to rip off the company, and hilarity insues.  While the idea of playing into all of our hate of the foibles of the office workplace seems like a 1-note tune, Judge's writing and directing keeps a brisk pace and provides enough insight and analysis of why we despise these things and how they could be better that it never feels that way.
Look for Stephen Root as Milton, by far the most hilarious character, stealing every scene he's in.  Close behind is Gary Cole as Bill Lumbergh, about the slimiest weasel of a boss I could have imagined.  Jennifer Aniston, while not bad, could have been replaced by virtually anyone else in the part who would have done as well with Judge's writing.
The DVD & Technical aspects:
While the sound seems a little harsh and the color tones and cinematography may be a little inconsistent, these look like problems related to the movie's production, not the printing of the DVD itself.  Chalk it up to the fact that it's a low, low-budget comedy - if you've seen enough films you'll see this has slightly sub-par production values in general.  The menu is interestingly designed, the only real extra is the preview trailer.  The movie may be in Dolby 5.1, but it's a dialogue-based office comedy so as you imagine it doesn't use much of its capabilities to provide sense of place.",979171200,8,2134,4.771739130434782

You will be hooked from the opening sequence (featuring Mambo #8) where Peter switches from lane to lane in rush hour traffic only to prove Murphy's Law - The other line ALWAYS moves faster, to Samir swearing up a storm in his car, to Michael Bolton rapping in his car, to the old guy on the sidewalk passing everybody with his walker. Flash forward to the final scene where Milton (the film's true hero) is berading a resort waiter over cocktails, this movie funny from start to finish.

The adorable main lead and his two cohorts-in-crime are funny, witty, and, in some cases, sleepy!

He is deliciously despicable, especially in one scene (ew!), which turns out to be fictional, but I won't get into that. Jennifer Aniston is sweet in her role as a waitress whose boss challenges her to wear more buttons on her uniform suspenders. Seriously! See, this film is *funny*!

1050638,5,6305499365,"I recently bought this comedy at the store just due to its low price.  A comedy about working kind of sounded interesting coming from the maker of ""Beavis And Butthead"" and ""King Of The Hill""  sounded  like a good idea.  I expected to laugh out loud and did, but not because of  the plight of hero Peter, but rather the antics of Milton, the mumbling  officer worker that never stands up for himself.
The story actually  focuses on Peter (played by Ron Livingston), who is an office worker  struggling through his cubicle-encompassing job at Initech.  His life is a  mess with a girlfirend that cheats on him, the woman of his dreams (played  by Jennifer Anistion) not noticing him and having to put up with a monotone  boss.  After being hypnotized, he realizes he's had enough.  He starts  showing up less at work and when he does he just goofs off.  He also makes  a successful relationship with the girl of his dreams.  Peter also manages  to move up in the ranks with his new neglect for work.  Even with all this  Peter is unhappy because to of his hard working friends get laid off.  They  hatch a plan to rip off Initech and make a few bucks in the process. Of  course, chaos follows.
This main story is good for many jokes, but  Peter as the normal guy that goes out of control isn't as funny as the  characters that are thrown in for even more comic relief.  One example is  the construction worker friend of Peter that lives next door.  Deitrich  Bader (from ""Drew Carey"") is to funny as Peter's loud fishing  buddy Lawrence.  Joanna (Jennifer) is the best female presence in this  mostly male cast and her ""minimal requirement"" waitress is so  real and funny.  But the best is by fair Milton, who stutters stammers  through the film as the forgotten worker that is always being pushed in a  corner and treated like garbage.  While the film's story gets kind of slow  as Peter tries to heal things over with his girlfriend and restore the  stolen money, keep your eye on Milton whose abuse is taken to new heights  (""But I didn't get a piece of cake last time."").  He really makes  me laugh out loud and takes over the movie.  Just to see him in action is  magic.  See the movie for the incredible performance from Stephen Root as  Milton.

For those of you thinking about renting or buying this  piece of trash, let me clue you in. Here's the plot (unbelievable and  stupid as it is) in a nutshell:  A guy and his pals get fed up with their  redundant jobs. (Who hasn't felt that way?) The company decides to  downsize, and calls the employees into the office one by one to  (SUPPOSEDLY) evaluate their value to the company. So our hero goes in,  admits that he does NOTHING, and (hold onto your hats) gets A PROMOTION.  And his father-in-law isn't the big boss (note sarcasm.) Is there such a  company on the face of the entire PLANET?  If so, let me know, I want to  work (or not work, rather) for them!  There is a scene in this movie  where he has went to see a hypnotherapist to instill some confidence in  himself, and the therapist dies right there in the office, BEFORE HE CAN  EVEN PLANT ANY SUBLIMINAL POSITVES INTO THE GUY""S THICK SKULL!  This  ""Session"" supposedly gave him confidence in himself!  Then our  hero hardly ever comes into work anymore, and isn't even reprimanded, not  to mention fired.  Our heroes (3 of them) decide to embezzle money from  their (very generous) company. The thing backfires as they have stolen way  too much money too soon, and most of the rest of the movie consists of  these three idiots running around in a panic.  The ending (I'll not give it  away, some poor entertainment- starved people might actually get one  chuckle from this total waste) is stupid, thrown together, an afterthought.  Moronic. No, it's beyond moronic, it's Sub-Moronic.  I bought this  phlegm-wad of a tape based soley on the rave reviews I read about it.  PLEASE don't make the same mistake.  Funniest movie ever made?

1050690,4,6305499365,"This movie is a funny, sarcastic look at the 9 to 5 existence and what it does to all those working drones out there.  Peter works at Initech, a generic company whose purpose is never really revealed, though we know it  has something to do with cubicles and computers.  His smug boss is asking  him to come in on his weekend, his jumpy coworker Milton mumbles about  keeping an eye on his Swingline stapler and threatens weakly to burn the  building down if they move his desk just one more time, and to make  everything worse, word is that the company is bringing in a consultant to  make things more efficient (i.e. fire people).  Understandably, Peter's  feeling a little tense and burned out. His soon-to-be-ex-girlfriend urges  him to see a hypnotherapist, who drops dead in the middle of the session,  leaving Peter wrapped up in a much calmer attitude.  Ironically, instead of  getting him fired, this attitude impresses certain higher-ups in the  company and Peter is promoted just as his buddies are about to get canned.  Stuck between moving up and losing his friends, Peter and the guys hatch a  scheme to embezzle company funds in such a gradual way that no one is  supposed to find out.  Things go a little wrong, but just as Peter is ready  to give up and turn himself in, fate steps in and changes things in a way  nobody expected.
Anyone has ever held a job can relate to the humor in  this movie, even if the job is not office-related (Peter's new girlfriend  Joanna, for example, works as a waitress in a restaurant but also hates her  irritating boss).  The first few minutes of the movie show various  characters braving rush hour to get to work.  Who hasn't changed lanes in  traffic, only to have that lane stop moving while cars in the old lane  suddenly roar ahead?

First time I saw it, I had hit play on the VCR not knowing this movie (Office Space) was in the machine. (it was my daughter's rental - I'd never heard of it)
The opening scene is a traffic jam where an old man  on a walker (beside the roadway) is making more forward progress than Peter  (Ron Livingston) in his little Toyota. You *feel* his pain...
That is  how Peter's day begins.
From there, we go to problems with ""The  Memo"" and the cover page for the inter-office report and of course,  some copy machine issues and on and on. (the copy machine does finally get  what it *richly* deserves)
The whole scene about ""the red  stapler"" is just classic comedy. One of the top 10 funniest scenes in  cinematic history.
However, the drywall installer (played by Diedrich  Bader) steals the show. Peter asks him ""What would you do if somebody  told you 'I think someone has a case of the Mondays?'"" to which the  drywaller gives a fair, honest and accurate answer. HILARIOUS!
This is  comedy.
There are many wordy-dirds throughout the flick, but if you can  get past those, you have a hilarious movie.
In our own family, the  classic lines of ""Office Space"" have become part of our own  vernacular...such as ""What's Happening?"" and ""I was told I  could play my radio...""
We *loved* this movie. This is too good to  rent. You'll need your own copy to watch again and again.

I don't even  remember when this movie hit the theaters, but one day at the video store I  heard a skateboard carrying teenager say to a fellow teen, ""Dude, this  movie is the funniest EVER! ""  Based on that ringing endorsement (and  even more based on the fact that there were only about 3 DVD available that  night) I grabbed it off the shelf.  I had very low expectations.

Maybe it was the  unknown cast (other than Jennifer Aniston), or the lack of faith the studio  had in Mike Judge's ability to direct a live action movie, but this movie  got very little publicity.  What a mistake.  Although low brow at times, I  can't think of one person who will not laugh out loud at least five times  during this movie.  The cast is great and very funny.  There are a few  ""big"" names, like Aniston, Stephen Root, Steve Girardot and  Diedrich Bader, but it is the ""unknowns"" who make this flick  great.  Ron Livingston is great as the dissatisfied employee who decides he  is just not going to go to work anymore.  Every player seems to have a  funny line.

I am glad I didn't, because we eventually had a lot of fun with the dialogs and situations, a long discussion after the film was finished, and I saw lots of things that have to do with my management courses...

I rented it and watched it 4 times, then skipped to some of the really funny parts and watched them a few more times.  It almost gets funnier every time you watch  it.

1050839,5,6305499365,"Office Space succeeds where Amercian Beauty and Fight Club fail. It captures the moribound existence of late '90's office life in the suburbs without the overdrawn artsy pretentiousness of American Beauty and without  the crazed plot twist of Fight Club. American Beauty tried to treat Kevin  Spacey's situations as comical and it came across as awkward. Not here.  Director Mike Judge, of Beavis and Butthead fame, shows why he is the  Hunter S. Thompson/Tom Wolfe of the '90's. Throught his work, especially in  Office Space, Judge reveals the ugly truth behind society's facade of  economic good times in an irreverant manner.  Office Space should soon  be a cult favorite thanks to its classic scenes that warrant repeated  viewing. The slow motion death-by-baseball bat-beating of a fax machine is  both hilarious and profound.  Some deride the movie for its ending, but  the film's conclusion should not seem far-fetched to anyone who has read  Voltaire's Candide.  So if you're looking for a movie that captures  what it means to be a young working adult without pompousness or art-house  flavour, Office Space is perfect.",949622400,11,1129,5.154696132596685
1050840,3,6305499365,"The previous reviewer said it better: it was good until the plot kicked in.
Many opportunities were lost in this movie. The multiple bosses, the consultants who are evaluating who to lay off, the silly procedures - all  could've been portrayed as more political, more futile or evil. Instead  these people are portrayed as cartoonish little characters that you would  see in a silly musical about office life.
The white collar crime part was  the majority of the story and scotched the fun we were having so far.
The ending was a bummer, too. I won't spoil it for you, but the  screenwriters must not have held jobs outside the office environment if  they think that other non-office professions are so ideal.",947635200,2,709,4.770491803278689
1050883,4,6305499365,"What a funny movie!  And I mean funny in the sense of clever dialogue, witty characters, humorous jabs at work life, that kind of funny.  Unlike a lot of the gross-out comedies of late, (Austin Powers 2, Big Daddy,  American Pie, There's Something About Mary, etc.), this movie relied on a  humorous situation we could all relate to.  That boss or manager we all  HATE.  Those confusing mindboggling printer and computer programs.  When  your finger gets shocked by the metal doorknob.  These are honest laughs  that are cleverly constructed.
Of course, I would like to say that a few  of those gross-out comedies I DID LIKE.  I'm just saying that it's  refreshing when a comedy film comes out that doesn't use toilet humor or  sex jokes.
I wish there could have been more features on this DVD,  though.  Aside from the trailer for the film, there isn't anything else.  By the way, I LOVE THE TRAILER!  Last January when I saw the trailer for  the first time, it was the first time I had heard Fatboy Slim's ""The  Rockafeller Skank"".  It took me forever to find out what that song was  in the commercial.  Now it's my current fave.
Getting back to the flick,  I love Ron Livingston's everyman performance.  Gary Cole is continuing his  reign of comic hilarity as the boss ""Lumbergh"".  I thought  ""Michael Bolton"" and his gangsta' rap was hilarious!  The only  underwritten cheesy role was Jennifer Aniston as the  ""girlfriend"".
I would totally give this FIVE stars had they  developed Jennifer Aniston's character and if they had put ""The  Rockafeller Skank"" in the actual movie.  Love that song!",947548800,,1596,4.742647058823529
1050884,3,6305499365,"This film starts out in a very promising way, offering broadly stereotypical characters in a comically banal work environment.  The protagonist's situation resembles that of Ed Norton's character in the  brilliant Fight Club; both men occupy boring, empty existences framed by  IKEA furniture and jobs of mind-numbing tedium.  However, while Fight Club  quickly veers into new and exciting cinematic territory, Office Space  settles into a formulaic, predictable and utterly inoffensive story about  inept white-collar crime.
This isn't a terrible movie and, depite  relying too much on the single most overused comedic topic of prison life,  it does have some funny moments.  I'm usually a big Mike Judge fan, but his  brand of laziness works far more successfully in a short Beavis and  Butthead episode than in this cautious and unambitious first foray into  live-action filmmaking.",947289600,,885,5.466666666666667

Sure to acheive cult status - like ""The Big Lebowski"" - this is a pleasantly funny film whose skewering of all things office-related just  seems to get better with each viewing.  Too many great bits -you'll be  repeating many of them amongst yourselves- to list.  Let down only by a  rather abrupt and all too pat ending, it's good-natured satire nevertheless  projects an underlying bleakness that underscores its relevance.

The Bill Lundberg (the  boss) character is a hysterical characature; I've been exchanging Lundberg  quotes with a friend I work with for over a month. Get a six pack and a big  bag of chips, call some of the people from your office and kick back and  enjoy.

1050887,4,6305499365,"Having been, in my more desperate days, a server for the oppressively corporate T.G.I. Friday's restaurant chain, I can say with some authority that Mike Judge based Chotchkie's more on Friday's than on Chili's or  Applebee's or any of those other horrible chains. The ""flair""  rules to which Jennifer Anniston's character is forced to adhere are  absolutely dead-on correct. In fact, about the only difference between  Chotchkie's and Friday's is that the vertical stripes on the servers'  shirts are green, not red. ""Office Space"" is a cult film in that  it really speaks to a certain segment of society to the point of leaving  those outside that segment in the dark. Of course, the number of Americans  who work in cubicles in suburban technology parks (and also in corporate  theme restaurants) number in the millions, so the ""Office Space""  cult could be a very large one. Basically, if you work or have worked in  one of these environments, you'll probably love this film. If you haven't,  then it probably won't be so compelling. As far as the plot goes, it's very  wicked and cutting and easy to follow, until Peter's fraud scheme kicks in;  then ""Office Space"" becomes a rather pedestrian heist flick. But  the first 80% of the film is incredibly funny, with lots of memorable  characters and unforgettable lines. My favorite exchange: ""What would  you do if you had a million dollars?"" ""2 chicks at the same time,  man.""",945302400,12,1431,4.867219917012448

The second time  I saw it on video it was even better, by then everyone I was seeing it with  could quote the lines and for some reason the movie was well, better.

So he doesn't-literally.  Leads to a promotion.
