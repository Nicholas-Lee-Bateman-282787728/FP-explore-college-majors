8342214,5,B001TOOHE6,"This is one of those rare films where the beauty of it just overwhelms you. The photography, the music, the whole atmosphere, it's just spellbinding. And you're never quite sure, are you looking at a fairytale or is this real. Be aware, though, that there are some scenes - well, one in particular - where you'd rather not look. No, it's not sex. Someone does something out of pure jealousy and revenge that is very, VERY cruel and you might just want to look away. Especially if you love animals. Still, it does not take away any of the beauty of this film.
I must confess that I would have liked a different actor in the leading role of the Argentinian. Pierre Vaneck does not seem to me to be the ideal choice. Fortunately I am also the proud owner of the German version, which was filmed simultaneously with the French one. In the German version Horst Buchholz has the lead and he is head and shoulders above Vaneck. Other than that most of the actors - with the exception of some of the boys - kept their original parts. Buchholz also does his own singing and can be seen briefly in a shot of the French version as one of the boys. His singing voice is used in the French version as well. Also there is a picture of him and Marianne Hold on the back of the box containing the French film.
All this said, here comes the downside: The subtitles are absolutely atrocious! You've never seen anything so idiotic. Whoever did them had a very limited knowledge of English [or French, for that matter, I suppose]. The subtitles strongly resemble an Oriental speaking in Pidgin English. Just one example: ""Excuse me"" [""Excuse moi""] becomes ""Excuse myself"" in the subs. You either laugh yourself silly or cry with frustration. Or: ""There were three crows on the road"" becomes ""There were three HORNS [??] on the road"". If you only speak a little bit of French, your best bet is to watch it sans subitles and use your imagination. You'll still love the film.",1410566400,,1952,4.501408450704226
8342215,4,B001TOOHE6,"I just watched the Korean DVD.  Marianne de ma Jeunesse is a lovely film comparable to Marcel Camus' Black Orpheus (1959) and Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast (1946), and great to look at.  There are two castles in the film with apparently real interiors that are a marvel of architecture (and if they are not real, a marvel of art direction and architecture).  The younger girl in the film looks a little like the American actress Lizabeth Scott.

The subtitles are highly legible in black-bordered yellow, but the translation is rather poor, full of spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, and frequently glaring unfamiliarity with English idioms. I don't speak nor read French (I only got up to French II in high school 40 years ago), but I recognize mangled English when I see it. Also rather unfortunate is the lack of subtitles for the several acoustic guitar-accompanied songs that the protagonist plays in the film.  Poor translation or not, it would have been nice to have some idea of what they were about.  Given the rarity of this film, however, beggars can't be choosers, so if you don't know French but want to see it, here it is.",1379116800,,1146,4.762626262626263

8342217,5,B001TOOHE6,"Oh, what a fairy-tale this romance unfolds.  A student in a private boarding school in a castle by the lake investigates whether an old mansion is haunted, and discovers a beautiful young women imprisoned in the house.  They both fall in love, and he vows to protect her.

The charm of the movie is based on the haunting folk-songs the man sings that reverberate through the woods, the fact that the young man has a magical relationship to animals where they trust him implicitly, and the undying love he has for this young mysterious woman, across the lake.

We never know whether it is a vision, a dream, or reality, but the other students eventually come to believe that the young man's love for ""Marianne"" is their love also.  The movie captures that other worldly quality of romance and true love that is all too quickly being forgotten.in this machine driven age.

It is a lovely film - lovely to look at - lovely to listen to.",1356739200,2,933,4.5568862275449105
8342218,5,B001TOOHE6,"wonderful old film,full of atmosphere,in dream like surrounding,for the pure and romantic at heart. I saw it when i was very young,it remained in my memory as a beautiful dream,seeing it 30 years after i still feel the same about it.",1293062400,,233,4.7073170731707314
8342219,5,B001TOOHE6,Haunting movie based on a haunting novel from 1935.  Written between the wars and set in a dreamy world of longing and melancholy.  Will never tire of either the movie or the book.  Saw the movie for the first time over 40 years ago; the English dubbed version of the German version with Horst Bucholtz in the role of Vincent.  Have been looking for it ever since.,1285459200,,364,4.388059701492537
8342220,5,B001TOOHE6,"Dear Friends,
I saw this film in France in the 60s and have no hesitation to say that there are people, admittedly idealist people of the 60s, who consider this the best French film ever made.
It has lots of questionable parts: too idealistic, too inchoate, too metaphysical.... But let me put it this way: I have been studying France for 4 decades or more, and there is no French film I admire more than this one.
Note: the film has not been available in my lifetime in the USA, before this DVD issuance. You are darned lucky to get it.
Also note: it would appear that this is from a novel in French that was from a novel in German. Just what is the ultimate ""provenance"" of this is a helluva confusion. Somebody was lifting something from some other authors. Plagiarism or confusion or interbreeding of ideas? Perhaps the last. Who knows, cares?
Question: just how did it evolve that the Koreans gave this to us? I have lived in Korea and don't know the Koreans as interpreters of French culture. Perhaps I underestimate them? They are among the most underestimated people on the globe...
Peace. Contact me if you have questions.

8342221,5,B001TOOHE6,"Marianne de ma jeunesse is the most beautiful movie I've seen.  It could be said that it is a ""coming of age"" movie, but absolutely not that ""coming of age' that we know in the present times, but of another generation when the fairy tales of chilhood were still present at the transicion. I read the book by Felix Mendelshon in which the movie is based, and the movie is better.  I watched it at the theater when I was very young and I did not know if the DVD was going to have the same effect on me.  It does. Everything remains a dream.",1240012800,3,538,4.104761904761904
