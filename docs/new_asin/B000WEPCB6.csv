8223025,4,B000WEPCB6,"the product was a gift from me to my husband.  It was interesting to learn of the history of the brigade he had been in while in Viet Nam.  I just wish they had put in a lot more material about the brigade's later days....key to the conflict, of which my husband was part.  There was a whole un-narrated, and with out sound section which we eagerly watched hoping to catch a glimpse of LZ North English, where my husband was deployed.
In the end, we both enjoyed watching it, but wish it could have included more 1968 - 1972 material.",1294704000,,534,4.267326732673268
