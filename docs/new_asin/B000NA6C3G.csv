8176315,5,B000NA6C3G,This is just an enjoyable film. I love Silvia Derbez in this- Pedro is put in a very uncomfortable and unnatural position in having to choose to continue being a mujeriego - or Silvia. Silvia is perfectly cast in this part. Sara Garcia does what she does best here- and we get to see a more intimate side of her character.,1236038400,2,322,4.295081967213115
8176316,3,B000NA6C3G,"I like Pedro Infante movies, despite my best efforts to the contrary. They're funny and fairly easy to understand for those speaking Spanish as a second language.

The only fault I had with this movie is the female lead--I just didn't like her at all. The female ""villain"" was a much better actress, and far more beautiful. I swear there's a point in the movie where you can see the female lead's very faint upper lip hair; faint but definitely dark. If you're a fan of Pedro's movies, this definitely has to be a part of your collection. But if you're trying him out for the first time, I would go with Cartas Marcadas or Los Hijos de Maria Morales.",1200009600,3,650,4.416666666666667
