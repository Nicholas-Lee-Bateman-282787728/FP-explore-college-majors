6494991,5,B00LO3BXK8,Great movie. You have to have faith in Jesus after seeing this one.,1416355200,,67,4.230769230769231

6494993,5,B00LO3BXK8,Awesome movie,1415577600,,13,6.0
6494994,1,B00LO3BXK8,"Bought this movie because of the promotion and the reviews.
I just love wholesome Christian movies, but this one was
sorely lacking.  I buy them to pass them on to unsaved, but
I will not pass this one on.  It has a good message, but lacked
so much.  Sorry to review it this way, but it might save someone
their money.",1415145600,,318,4.180327868852459
6494995,5,B00LO3BXK8,Great story!,1414800000,,12,5.5
6494996,5,B00LO3BXK8,"I am so thrilled at all the Christian Movies, 2014 has brought us.  Praise Pictures has done it again with this amazing new movie, Love Covers All.  I've watched it 2x and am sure I will be watching, again.  I can go on and on about this movie, but you need to see it for yourself.  You won't be disappointed.  Great job Kyle Prohaska!!!  We want and need more of this kind of movie. then we NEED to support Kyle and Praise Pictures.  As well as others who bring us AMAZING CHRISTIAN MOVIES!!  I am happily building a great Christian Movie library.",1412035200,4,548,4.303921568627451
6494997,5,B00LO3BXK8,"Kyle Prohaska hits a cinematic home run with a believable story and characters you'll be rooting for all the way through the film. Solid acting and plot surprises add to the multiple dimensions of the film. Although it's not an action flick, the movie's emotional arc is one that's definitely worth following, taking the ""Christian film"" formula and approaching it in unexpected ways.",1409788800,4,384,5.111111111111111
6494998,4,B00LO3BXK8,"A well made and redeeming family film. Starring Jason Burkey (October Baby), Michael Joiner (The Grace Card), Shannen Fields (Facing the Giants) and Rusty Martin Sr. and Rusty Martin Jr. (Courageous). You're going to want to make this film the next one you watch at family movie night!",1405555200,3,285,4.958333333333333
6494999,5,B00LO3BXK8,"If you're looking for a fantastic Christian movie that will cheer your heart and challenge your thinking, then Love Covers All is one you'll absolutely want to get!  Writer/Director Kyle Prohaska, who first touched audiences hearts with his gripping drama Standing Firm, delivers another well crafted story that affirms the powerful place of faith and love in our lives.

We set out with Michael (played admirably by fresh face Jared Young) on a routine business trip, but it quickly turns into a race against time as his pregnant wife Sarah (Jennifer Mercurio) goes into labor. Stranded and frustrated, Michael meets up with a reclusive gas station attendant named Bob (brought delightfully to life by Rusty Whitener) and it is here things begin to get really interesting as Michael's faith is put to the test as he tries to figure out a way back to his wife and soon-to-be newborn.

Starring turns from veteran Christian actors such as Jason Burkey (October Baby), Michael Joiner (The Grace Card), Shannen Fields (Facing the Giants) and Rusty Martin Sr. and Jr. (Courageous) keep the plot lively and entertaining. Throw in some great plot twists, excellent cinematography, and stirring music by award-winning composer Jurgen Beck and you have another winner.  You won't be disappointed, check it out!",1405036800,8,1302,5.127358490566038
6495000,5,B00LO3BXK8,Great movie for the entire family.  Teaches Christians that we must show ourselves as true Christians because others are watching our lives and we can have a good or bad influence on them.,1485820800,,188,4.696969696969697
6495001,5,B00LO3BXK8,"Great job all the way around!! We all need reminders that our lives reflect our God to those around us. May God give us grace to always be His hands and feet to the lost and needy,a light shining in this dark and lost world. Thank you for this film.",1485648000,2,249,4.0
6495002,5,B00LO3BXK8,This is a very nice movie that is certain to please Christian audiences.,1476835200,,72,4.615384615384615
6495003,5,B00LO3BXK8,this is a great movie loved it what can say it has a strong message of love and love does certainly cover all,1469923200,,109,3.782608695652174
6495004,3,B00LO3BXK8,"I was disappointed in this movie. While the circumstances are ones that each can easily identify with, the characters were not really nice people and yet professed to be Christians. The star of this movie was the non-believer who really was searching and it shows that God can move in a person's life despite the behavior of those who profess His name.",1465776000,,352,4.693548387096774

6495007,1,B00LO3BXK8,"Where do I begin?  When I saw that when they dropped a ""driving scene"" early in the movie, I was getting ready for a real dud.  Typically movies with a driving scene (music, no talking, and a lot of scene shifting while the character drives) turn out to be total duds...and this cinematic offering was absolutely horrible.

The best part of the movie was when it was finally over.  If you want to feel like you've been robbed of 2 hours of your life...then this is the stinker for you!  Watch at your own peril.",1443916800,,511,4.336842105263158

6495011,4,B00LO3BXK8,This was a good movie to teach us how people watch our lives and they judge God's Character based on the confession of our life and the actions we live out. Be sure to Sanctify the name of God with what you believe and how you act. The world is watching in silence to see who this God you represent really is. Thank you for producing movies like this.,1436659200,4,351,4.101449275362318
6495012,5,B00LO3BXK8,Excellent movie about forgiveness and what it means to love one another with compassion,1435363200,,87,5.285714285714286
6495013,4,B00LO3BXK8,Another great movie. America needs more movies like this.,1432857600,,57,5.444444444444445
6495014,3,B00LO3BXK8,"I wasn't as invested  in this movie as other reviewers seem to have been. To me the actors/acting was really just average, and the plot very predictable. Now...the message was a good one, but unfortunately the delivery was not so good. It wasn't horrible, but it should have come with a $0.00 Price Tag.",1431993600,,303,4.611111111111111

6495023,5,B00LO3BXK8,"Kyle Prohaska delivers another fine, thoughtful movie. Love Covers All is well executed and doesn't stick to the typical christian movie types and tropes. His characters are believable and as deeply human as they are devout. Its refreshing to see an honest portrayal of a person of faith rather than preachy or didactic stereotypes. I strongly recommend this fine movie.",1424044800,,370,5.183333333333334

8667140,4,B00LO3BXK8,"Very unlikeable characters with the exception of ""Bob"".  Poor acting with the exception of actor who plays ""Bob"".  BUT excellent and encouraging message.  It reminds us that as Christians we must have a living faith which gives us the strength and courage needed to endure trials and difficulties and allows others to see Jesus Christ within us.  We are called to be ""lights"".",1525219200,,376,4.920634920634921

8667147,1,B00LO3BXK8,"Fellow Christians, we can't be lowering ourselves and give bad movies a great rating just because they are Christian based films. This was a horrible movie. It opens with Michael yelling at his father on the phone because his father won't drive six hours to sit in a hospital waiting room for the birth of Michael's first child. Then Michael's company wants him to drive six hours to their headquarters just three days before the child's expected birth date. They have Michael come in order to fire him. No company does this! Then Michael decides to drive home in the middle of the night, but takes back roads home. His car breaks down. Even though Michael has a smart phone, he walks to a gas station to find a phone book. He acts ugly towards the gas station's owner when the owner offers to check Michael's car (he owns a gas station, let him look!). Michael is ugly towards two people that visit the gas station demanding that they help him. He gives the last of his money, $40, to one person, then magically has another $20 to give to another. None of this makes any sense! Wife Sarah goes into labor, but doesn't want to go to the hospital. Michael doesn't want to tell her that his car broke down. This goes on and on and on and on. I guess the only thing worst that the script is the acting. If it wasn't for Bob, the gas station owner, the movie would be a total waste. Bob is agnostic but gives the best Christian performance. His acting was also very good. Basically, save yourself two hours and DON'T watch this movie! So many GREAT Christian films that should be supported. This is not one of them.",1501718400,,1611,4.409395973154362
