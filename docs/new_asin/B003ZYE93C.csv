8411291,5,B003ZYE93C,Seeing Sir David Jason in 1981 before 'Granville' is fun & this series is quite good! His 'Del' is quite the wheeler-dealer & buying/selling goods out of his van - let's just say that what 'Del' deals in will never have a warranty & are of often dubious origin... A fine supporting cast helps make this series a great ride!!,1470441600,2,324,4.416666666666667
