8038708,5,B00064YTMA,"Get this movie! We have watched it hundreds of times. My son can recognize types of planes now, and he is two. I asked him where he wanted to fly me to and he said ""New Zealand"".  The mammoth series are great and fun learning videos for kids, and I like watching and learning too. We have so much to talk about now.",1344211200,,315,4.0
8038709,5,B00064YTMA,"You can't beat the Little Mammoth Media people for their ""The Big ........"" series.  All of the videos are interesting, full of useful knowledge, narrated by kids and not overly stimulating with special effects.  We wore these videos out.",1327708800,,238,5.076923076923077
8038710,5,B00064YTMA,"I bought this through our local air museum for my toddler who LOVES airplanes (voos) and helicopters (hocters). This film on the Oshkosh airshow is fun for adults and children. Narrated nicely by a little girl,the diversity of aircraft covered is great. Beautiful footage of formation and stunt flying, warbirds, seaplanes, etc., as well as interesting facts. We've watched this video many times and still love it.",1170547200,3,414,5.1940298507462686
8038711,5,B00064YTMA,"We have 6 of ""The Big.."" series and my kids thoroughly enjoy them. They are educational and entertaining--even for adults. I will continue to buy this series until I own them all. I also highly recommend the ""Popular Mechanics for Kids"" series.",1138492800,2,244,4.833333333333333
