3659026,2,B001JP647S,"This Man Can't Die is one of those westerns that had a decent premise, but wasn't fully realized. The acting is poor and so is the direction. It's a wannabe spaghetti western that leaves everyone wanting for more than they were delivered.

A rancher's family is terrorized by a band of goons and what appears to be one of the gang is shot and near death. Turns out he's working for the oldest son, a bounty hunter who has made more than a few enemies in his time. The goons are, predictably, made to pay in western justice fashion.

There are a few good moments in the film including the over the top finale that we all saw on the horizon at the BEGINNING of the film, but ultimately, you're going to be disappointed overall with this one.",1408665600,,739,4.3478260869565215

3659031,3,B001JP647S,"Writer & director Gianfranco Baldanello's ""This Man Can't Die!""  (**1/2 out of ****) with Guy Madison qualifies as an above-average spaghetti western.  Baldanello penned the screenplay with ""Three Dollars of Lead"" writer Luigi Emmanuele and ""Atlas against the Cyclops"" scribe Gino Mangini.  Actually, Baldanello, Emmanuele, and Mangini have written a rather formulaic but entertaining oater that relies on the literary use of foreshadowing to tell its tale of greed, redemption, and justice.  Watch the box of guns & gun belts that are given to the hero in the first scene and you'll see what I mean.

Baldanello, Emmanuele, and Mangini provide d0 a good job of establishing the action in the first scene at a cavalry fort.  The army captain (Giovanni Ivan Scratuglia of ""Kill and Pray"") tells our hero, Martin Benson (Guy Madison), ""So far you've done a good job, Martin.  But obviously you won't be able to continue undercover any longer, their friends will be after you like a swarm of bees.""  Benson gauges his payoff, ""Instead of ten pieces of silver, I get paid in gold.""  Martin Benson is a lean, mean, tall, unshaven, cigarette smoking specimen of humanity.  In other words, he is a standard Spaghetti western protagonist.

Three felons that Benson brought in swing from the gallows outside the captain's office.  The captain complains, ""Damnit, even with death staring them in the face, they won't talk.  The smuggling of firearms certainly won't end with a rope around the necks of those devils outside.  I don't care how you do it but we've got to find out who's in charge of this operation and where the new hide0ut is.  Washington is never going to get off my back until rifles and rotgut are off the reservation.  You know, Martin, I'm up for promotion.""

Benson refuses to take the assignment.  ""If I keep fooling around with those gun runners my hide isn't going to be worth a damn.""  The captain demands that Benson handle the job and he manages to convince him with more money that he --rather than Tony Guy (Steve Merrick) -- isn't appropriate for the mission.  ""I've just been bought,"" Benson agrees as he accepts the money.  Before Benson leaves, an army sergeant enters headquarters with the guns and gun belts of the three outlaws that were hanged outside.  Benson tells the captain to sent the hardware to his father and he rides out.  No sooner does Benson hit the trail that two horsemen and a couple of riflemen lay an ambush for him in the sagebrush.  Benson blows the two horsemen away while on horseback him wielding his Winchester repeating rifle with one hand.  This doesn't keep the bad guys from pursuing Benson.  Meanwhile, at the Benson ranch, Martin's father has disowned his oldest son because of his criminal record.  This is one plot point that the scenarists never resolve.  Earlier, the army captain told Martin that he could have his record wiped clean by discovering the identity of the man behind the contraband whiskey and rifle trade.  Anyway, the same gang that are tracking Martin strike his parents ranch while his two brothers and oldest sister are gone to town.  The gunslingers kill Martin's mother and father; one outlaw rapes his youngest sister, Jenny (Rosalba Neri of ""Lion of Thebes""), and traumatizes her so that she cannot talk.

When Daniel Benson (Pietro Martellanza), his older sister Susy (Lucienne Bridou of ""Black Jack"") and their youngest brother arrive at the ranch, they find their horses have been stampeded and a wounded man is lying on their property.  Initially, Daniel believes that the wounded man is one of the brigands that killed his parents.  He takes the man to a cave and brings the doctor to attend to him.
Meanwhile, Vic Graham (Rik Battaglia) lusts after Susy, even though she refuses to have anything to do with him.  The action shifts back to Martin who discovers the rendezvous point between the Indians and the gun runners.  He uses his skill with a Winchester to blow up two wagons filled with rifles.  The bad guys wound him, a mere flesh wound, but he escapes and rides to the ranch to learn about the massacre of his family.  The bad guys never give Martin a moment of respite.  Eventually, they capture him as well as Daniel and trap them in their ranch house while they pile trees outside before they torch the structure.  In the wagon that Susy drove to town to fetch the mail is the box of guns from the gun runners that were hanged at the fort in the first scene.  Not only does Martin discover the ring leader of the rotgut and rifles outfit, but he also kills him during a fight in the upper story of a building.

Although this horse opera has been clearly dubbed, especially Guy Madison, the words do match the mouths even though the voices seem incongruous.  The scenery isn't as spectacular as the terrain in most Euro westerns.  The dialogue isn't as clever or catchy nor are the gunfights staged with the ostentation of those in either a Sergio Leone or Sergio Corbucci oater.  On the other hand, ""This Man Can't Die!"" is largely believable and pretty straightforward with its linear narrative and shuns the use of flashbacks.  The performances, especially ""Since You Went Away"" actor Guy Madison, who earlier rode the range in 112 episodes of ""The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok,"" are credible.  Rik Battaglia of ""The Mysterious Island of Captain Nemo"" makes a suitable nemesis, while Pietro Martellanza of ""Kill Them All and Come Back Alone"" is good as Guy Madison's younger brother.  Composer Amedeo Tommasi contributes a good orchestral score and a James Bond style theme song, but often Baldanello borrows (or steals depending on your point of view) cues from Ennio Morricone's ""Fistful of Dollars.""  The use of mixed soundtracks with a number of themes from other movies without the composer's permission is standard operating procedure for most low-budget kung fu movies, but this is the first time that I've heard of this done in a Continental western.  ""This Man Can't Die"" draws its title not from its tough guy protagonist but from its second string hero, Tony Guy, who is mistaken for one of the marauders that murder Benson's parents.",1228780800,7,6151,4.812380952380952

8313282,4,B001JP647S,"THIS MAN CAN'T DIE

Released in 1968 and directed by Gianfranco Baldanello, ""This Man Can't Die"" (aka ""The Long Days of Hate"") stars Guy Madison as a government-hired agent looking for the ringleader of a group of gunrunner/bootleggers. Meanwhile his parents are murdered and youngest sister raped (Anna Liotti). Will he and his younger brother & other sister (Steve Merrick & Susy Benson) find the killers and their ringleader? Rik Battaglia and Rosalba Neri are also on hand.

This is a serious spaghetti Western more akin to Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" (1968) than his comic booky (and sometimes goofy) Man with No Name trilogy. But it's half as long as ""Once Upon a Time"" and therefore leaner, which is better in my book (although ""Once Upon a Time"" is technically the better movie). While not great, it's a solid Western with a lousy English-speaking title. Too bad Anna Liotti's role wasn't bigger because she's an ultra-cutie.

The film runs 90 minutes and shot in Spain.

THE DESPERATE MISSION

Released theatrically in Mexico in 1969 (and on TV in America in 1971) and directed by Earl Bellamy, The Desperate Mission is an American Western released to TV starring Ricardo Montalban as Joaquin Murrieta, the real-life Mexican Robin Hood who was the inspiration for Johnston McCulleys Zorro. The movie focuses on Murrieta just after losing his land, his wife and everything else. Disillusioned, he joins a dubious band of Americans hired by a wealthy man (Anthony Caruso) to escort his beautiful wife (Ina Balin) away from the lawless countryside to safety in San Francisco, but mores going on than meets the eye. Earl Holliman, Jim McMullan, Slim Pickens and Roosevelt Grier play members of the gang whereas Miriam Colon plays a spiritual senorita whos along for the ride.

Depending on ones point of view, Murrieta was either an infamous bandit or a Mexican hero. So many tales have been birthed around him that it is hard to disentangle the fantastical from the factual. Some evidence suggests that he wasn't one man, but rather three to five, whose exploits were combined. Coinciding with The Desperate Mission, theres a general consensus that gringos drove Murrieta from a lucrative California mining claim in the mid-1800s and, in succession, his wife was ravished, his sibling lynched, and Juaquin himself horsewhipped. From there, the story that the movie conveys is pretty much fictional or, at best, speculative.

The history of The Desperate Missionshot in Mexico and released theatrically thereshows that its not some ordinary TV Western. It may not be a big-budget Western like the contemporaneous The Wild Bunch, but it aint no cheapo TV flick either. In any case, Ricardo shines as the protagonist and easily carries the movie. Despite Murrietas embittered disillusionment you can tell hes a noble man underneath and definitely doesnt fit in with trash like Shad Clay (Holliman). Speaking of Clay, you know hes a snake from the get-go, albeit a snake with charm. Theyre easy to spot if you know what to look for. Likable Rosey Grier has an interesting peripheral role. In fact, the supporting characters in general are well-defined and performed adeptly by the actors. The story is engaging because its about finding yourself after being momentarily lost, not to mention the courage to stand up for whats right, and then follow through.

The movie runs 96 minutes and was shot in Durango, Mexico.
