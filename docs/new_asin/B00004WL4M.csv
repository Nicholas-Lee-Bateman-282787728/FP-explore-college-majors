8453357,4,B00004WL4M,"The second volume of Lost Universe brings us more adventures from our interplanetary animated crew. Crossing the galaxy in their ship 'The  Swordbreaker', the action follows our heroes Kane, the resident fighting  type guy, and his female companion Milli, the number one cook in the  universe who's also pretty handy with the ship's sizeable defence systems.  The Swordbreaker comes with the services of Canal, a female hologram who's  on hand to help out when things get tight - which they do, all the  time.
Lost Universe is an enjoyable anime with likeable characters, good  humour and a story that will swiftly draw you in. Come for the eye candy,  stay for the story - make no mistake, there is no escape from the Lost  Universe.",965174400,3,734,4.808
