8416156,5,B0044LYRJG,i liked the movie and planning on getting volume 3  too,1486857600,,55,4.0
8416157,2,B0044LYRJG,"This is an oldie and pretty tame compared to some of this era.  Quality is what you would expect for a black and white. If you are looking for Michael Landon in this one as described in IMBD, he's not in it.",1390694400,,207,3.9285714285714284
8416158,4,B0044LYRJG,"Sheriff of Cochise won't win any awards and had a limited television run (4 years in both the Sheriff of Cochise and U.S. Marshal titles), but this is a fun contemporary western.  Filmed in B&W in the late 50's.  This is one of the shows my father watched as a teenager.  It has been fun to watch the episodes with him now and try to see how they looked to him all those many years ago.  I love the cars, costuming and the tight story lines. John Bromfield is serviceable as he navigates Cochise County crime and politics. It is clearly not healthy, though, to be one of his Deputies..... (let's say Star Trek Red Shirt)..... Some of the episodes showcase a young Michael Landon or Jack Lord.  These old shows are fiction, but fun film noir.  My only complaint is that the series is not available in its entirety.  I would like to see other entries in this and the U.S. Marshal series.",1379116800,,885,4.359756097560975
8416159,5,B0044LYRJG,Purchased this DVD because my favourite actor Robert Horton was acting in it.  But did enjoy the other shows on the DVD also.,1373587200,,125,4.434782608695652
8416160,5,B0044LYRJG,"This disc offers four great episodes of a classic western, set in contemporary (1950's) times. Best of all, these episodes have not been previously released, so one can order without duplicating a previous order.

I especially liked the episode called ""Human Bomb"" about an escaped mental patient who stole dynamite. I thought I recognized the actor playing the criminal as former heavyweight champion Primo Carnera, and sure enough it was!

Sheriff of Cochise and its successor, ""U.S. Marshal"" was a great series which still plays well. The entire series should be produced in a boxed set, as is Sky King.",1288310400,2,606,5.05
