The Killer Likes Candy: A by the books potboiler set in Italy. Not to lurid at all.
Molly and the Ghost: Not very scary. one nude scene. The final twist is so dumb that I tried returning this video to Blockbuster only to snap out of my dimetia and realize that this DVD wasn't M. Night Shalmalan's ""Signs"" or Blockbuster's been closed for over a month now.....
Run Like Hell: It looks like it was shot on a DV Camera. The most impressive scene was Robert Z'dar sitting on the filmmakers sofa; saying things like ""It's armagedden NOW!"" or something like that. Look for one of the female escapees with short blond hair who really relishes her cheesy lines.

All-in-all, a nice box-set at the right price. Mediablasters should do more of this.",1392508800,2,790,4.602836879432624
8305245,4,B001GF8WSU,"I bought this set anticipating a typical b-movie collection, but my expectations were exceeded. Despite some below average acting, there was a certain entertainment value to this rareflix triple feature. Killer likes candy & molly and the ghost make this set worth the money. There are times the plot runs a little thin, but each film manages to pull together a coherent storyline to make the overall viewing experience worth the time and effort. Run like hell is the least entertaining and needs a better wrap up in the overall plot. The acting is definitely b-grade, but that is expected. Only collectors of b-movie fare should purchase this collection. It is a nice addition to my dvd library.",1369526400,5,696,4.906779661016949
