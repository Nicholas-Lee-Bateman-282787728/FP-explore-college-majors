When I was a kid they were things that I would watch over and over, and even as I grew up they're still some of my favorites. I don't know about you but I love Casper and Mighty Mouse. Sure, there are things like ""Uncle Tom's Cabana"" -- but in the era of these cartoons not everything had to be so politically correct, and frankly I think a little stepping on toes isn't necessarily a bad thing. If you can enjoy these cartoons as they are without overthinking them, you'll be very happy with this collection.",1353196800,,583,4.457943925233645
8079932,3,B000AV71CO,"This is a great video for a rainy day and you want your kids to feel sorry for you and your childhood...""That's what you *had* to watch when you were our age?""  You can tell your kids, ""They never closed school for only 5 or 6 inches of snow"" and they will roll their eyes thinking, ""Yeah right, Mom.""  But when you tell your kids you only had a handful of cartoon characters in your days...You can always pull out this video and prove it.  When they see the poor quality...all that scratchy snow and jerking, they realize [albeit only for the moment] what horrible Saturday mornings you had as a child.  I would actually give this video 2.5 stars...2 for nostalgia and 1/2 for quality.",1163548800,,686,4.420634920634921
8079933,1,B000AV71CO,"The Emson ""50 Cartoon Classics"" DVD is truly a mess and rightfully so. Apparently,the producers of this disc took fifty unrestored public-domain cartoon classics that truly do look like they were copied off of first generation video,some look very bad with extreme color fading and contrast boost and a LOT of extended disc compression to round out the release while others are taken from poor television/theatrical reissue prints. Some of the cartoons included here in this collection feature the nine Max Fleischer ""Superman"" Cartoons (interestingly,they have their original release date included at the opening of each cartoon,possibly taken from an another release without permission !),a few Bugs Bunny/Porky Pig/Elmer Fudd/Daffy Duck shorts that have definitely appeared elsewhere on DVD,one Felix The Cat/Woody Woodpecker cartoon each,two Casper's,and some rare and hard to find Tom & Jerry shorts from RKO/Van Beuren Studios (note that they are NOT the Tom & Jerry of the later years that we all know and love !) to name quite a few. Whenever you fast forward this disc,it freezes to go the next chapter and the menu design looks definitely homemade,cheap,and definitely recalls looking like a pirated-at-home DVD !!  Don't go wasting your money with this piece of trash as there are better DVD releases of public domain cartoons elsewhere (definitely checkout Digiview's remastered and better-looking ""Cartoon Craze"" series which cost only a buck at Wal-Mart !) and if you're wanting to have six hours of fifty entertaining cartoons,stick to buying the VHS releases of the collection with much better quality such as Starmaker's award-winning collection and United American Video. Would've definitely worked on two three-hour discs on one collection,but they don't care for customers,only looking for robbing your hard-earned money to buy this !!  Avoid this and the ""As Seen On TV"" approval at all costs !",1133568000,5,1915,5.358803986710964
8079934,2,B000AV71CO,"My copy of ""50 Cartoon Classics"" says ""Family Approved"" on the back. Don't you believe it! I suspect whoever compiled this grabbed all the public domain cartoons s/he could find and put them in order by studio without ever having watched them. I lost track of how many blackface caricatures I saw. Some cartoons, like ""All This and Rabbit Stew"" and ""Uncle Tom's Cabana"" are so offensive in their entirety that they can't be shown on TV. Others, like ""Fresh Hare,"" are often aired with the offending material cut out. It's not cut here. There are many collectors out there who want to see these works in their original form, and that's fine. However, I can't imagine how hurtful it would be for an African-American to purchase this ""Family Approved"" DVD for his or her kids without realizing what is on it.

Other beefs: The scene selections won't let you jump to a particular cartoon but only to big batches. If you didn't know better, you might think the Tom and Jerry shorts were about a cat and mouse, but these are the (earlier) Van Buren Studios characters. (They're nowhere near as funny.)

The DVD contains some great cartoons viewers of any age can enjoy  (9 of the Fleischer Superman shorts, for example). If you buy this DVD, be sure to preview it yourself before taking the advice of the back matter to ""treat yourself and the kids"" to ""the gift of fun and laughter.""",1130630400,3,1378,4.616326530612245
