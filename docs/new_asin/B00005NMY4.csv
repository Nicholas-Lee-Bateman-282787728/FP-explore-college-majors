7947465,4,B00005NMY4,"Undoubtedly one of the funniest Hindi films of all time, giving a nostalgic look at young and urbane 70s Bombay. Palekar is brilliant as the quintessential idiot in love with Vidya Sinha, but unable to express his love for her. Asrani is an excellent rival, sliming his way into the girl's heart. But there's a trump card - up in the hills is a learned oldie Ashok Kumar who has a devious plan of action in mind - to give Palekar the one-up on Asrani. Few have seen this film, and I'm yet to come across anyone who disputes that this rates as one of the best comedies to ever come out on the Indian silver screen.",1304467200,2,613,4.247863247863248
7947466,5,B00005NMY4,"Directed by Basu Chatterjee . A simple Comedy Movie released in 1975 . A tension free and relaxing movie to watch

A simple Comedy Movie with Great acting from Amol Palekar , Asrani , Vidhya Sinha and Ashok Kumar .

Amol Palekar is an ordinary looking man who lacks confidence when it come to socializing . He his afraid to start a conversation with others especially women . This is a very realist situation were out actor in the movie lacks confidence , unsure of himself and gets fooled by other because of his attitude. He likes the next door girl in the movie ( Vidhya Sinha ) and is afraid to start a conversation . On the other side ,a different character who has confidence in himself ( Asrani) , is a guy who can socialize easily with anyone .

Atlast our hero finds an ad in the newspaper and gets in touch with Ashok Kumar who gives him that confidence and how Amol Palekar returns wins the girlfriend heart.

One Song which especially touches everyone's heart is the ""Janeman Janeman"" . This song is very realistic in the sense that our hero like any other guy watches in the theater and gets into the song and dreams about it .

I gave 5 Stars because of the Song and the Movie Content.

Song : ""Janeman Janeman tere do nayan""  is Awesome and is also picturized well.  Salil Chowdhary composed the music.",1256688000,,1317,4.390946502057613
