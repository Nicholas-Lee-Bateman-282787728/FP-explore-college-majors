8190627,5,B000PDZIXQ,I got this about 4 and 1/2 yrs. ago for my then 3 yr. old daughter who loved watching cooking shows. She still to this day loves watching them and encourages me to make some of the recipes. As well as trying to make up her own concoctions. Good investment in letting her explore her creativity. Thanks,1430092800,,301,4.298245614035087
8190628,4,B000PDZIXQ,"Robin Miller presents ideas on this DVD that will help you get dinner on the table faster during the work week. She makes five meals that are comfort food favorites. Who doesn't like macaroni and cheese, chocolate cake, pizza and chicken pot pie? Now there are a few things I thought she did differently than most people. Like she put tomatoes in her pot pie instead of making a creamy gravy. She also didn't use any tomato sauce on her pizza. It was mostly cheese, pineapple and chicken. She also didn't bake her macaroni and cheese. She does use a lot of convenience foods like a refrigerated pie crust and a premade pizza crust. By following her advice you will learn to make dinner fast. I'd recommend this DVD to busy moms.
