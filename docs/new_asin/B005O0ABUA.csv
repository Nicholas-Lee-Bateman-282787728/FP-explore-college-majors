4850891,5,B005O0ABUA,"Lisa takes what some may consider a complicated or esoteric practice and brings it to level that is easy understand, fun to practice and that actually works.  Kudos for that simplicity. Yet this simplicity is not without a solid understanding by the author of the true nature of Qigong and traditional Chinese medicine. I highly recommend this book to those who want to understand the principles and feel the effects of Qigong. Bravo.....................",1321401600,,454,5.219178082191781
4850892,5,B005O0ABUA,"THIS IS THE QIGONG DVD I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR... and boy, am I glad I found it.

Lisa B. O'Shea is phenomenal.  Her knowledge of, experience in and ability to teach Qigong are outstanding.  You will learn from this gifted woman... you will easily comprehend the knowledge she conveys and you will quickly be comfortable and competent in the practice of Qigong meditation and healing.

Lisa is at ease with the subject matter because she is so very much dedicated to the subject matter, and her desire for you to learn comes thru in every chapter.

... and, speaking of chapters; they are well divided and easily understood as well as easily referenced.  I find myself returning over and again to a particular subject, only to find that I got it right the first time (thanks, mostly to Lisa's style of instruction).

I have no doubt that this DVD contains instructions that can change your life for the positive.",1320624000,2,914,4.675
4850893,5,B005O0ABUA,"I don't think I need to list the many ways we stress our minds and bodies in today's world. This dis-ease can result in aches, pains, temporary and even chronic illness. If you are looking for something that can help. This is it. Lisa is passionate about her subject, patient and thorough in her explanations, and even teaches a beginner how to do it right on the DVD. You can learn how to calm and heal yourself and share your skill with others. Maybe you are a practitioner in another discipline but not familiar with qigong. I think you will be pleasantly surprised how effective it can be. I definitely recommend you expand you skill set with these techniques.",1320105600,3,664,4.588235294117647
4850894,5,B005O0ABUA,"The instructions on this video are simple to understand and practice. The camera work and verbal cues make it easy to see exactly how to do the healing treatments on yourself or a partner. There are several times in the sequence when we are reminded not to do too much. Keep the treatments simple and clear. For instance, we are told generally not to touch the head when working from the back of a seated patient. It is okay to lay a hand on the back, but if we touch the head, even gently, the patient tends to press into the touch and put a strain on their neck. When working on a person who has heart issues you should never send energy directly into the front of the heart, but rather work from the back. Simple instructions with an eye for safe energy work are shown on the self, a partner, seated and prone.

There is a very nice, easy to learn qigong routine that is filmed in a beautiful field with a evergreen background. It is pleasant to follow along with this DVD if you are just learning the sequence. Very detailed indoor instruction is given about each move in the set.

I am a tai chi instructor and have practiced qigong for many years. I am just now getting to the point of using it on other people. I liked the very clear instructions and explanations that Ms. O'Shea provided. People with many years of practice and people brand new to qigong will find some useful information in the DVD. It is simple and safe to learn, just trust your intuition.",1319846400,2,1467,4.350364963503649
4850895,5,B005O0ABUA,Qi Gong for Healing is a must have for anyone interested in the healing arts. Lisa O'Shea explains qi gong in a comprehensible manner for all to understand. The energy flow and energy blockages explanations are very clear and concise. This DVD walks you through step-by-step on how to feel your own energy as well as how to feel (scan) another's energy in a safe manner. The exercises are not only graceful and beautiful but they feel awesome. Thank you Lisa for sharing your expertise with us!!,1319760000,5,495,4.7011494252873565
4850896,5,B005O0ABUA,"This video has met my expectations and more.  I have been studying qigong for a few years but I have not been able to learn really directed healing qigong until I discovered this video. Lisa is a talented teacher who kept me engaged even in the material I am familiar with.  The directions are clear and easy to follow. It seemed as if Lisa was right there in my living room as she was instructing. I am a YMAA student and so it is satisfying to me to know that she had Dr. Yang's support and approval in this.
Even a rank beginner should be able to follow the instructions and begin to benefit from it. I am going to have my daughter watch this with me so that we can help each other. Thank you Lisa!",1319673600,2,701,4.109489051094891
4850897,5,B005O0ABUA,"I met Lisa at YMAA Headquarters in Boston in 2009 during a Qigong seminar with Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming. After an informal discussion with her I was quite impressed. I could tell right away that she was speaking with a sufficiency and confidence that can only emanate from experience. Not your average qigong classmate. I remember thinking that she may had been teaching just as well alongside Master Yang, but still she was there as a student like the rest of us.

At that time, I was focused on my martial arts training so I took note of the Qigong Institute of  Rochester (which she founded), and continued my way, mostly concerned with rigorous martial qigong and meditation. Of course, martial arts are only so much fun when you have a healthy body. When I started to develop a rare digestive illness, Lisa was one of the first persons I thought about. At that time, she was preparing this DVD, so I wrote down in my calendar the release date to be sure to check it out.

The one thing about health is that you don't miss it until you don't have it. If you are reading this, chances are that you have health troubles yourself or somebody close to you has. That's the way we are. Luckily, there are people like Lisa who take the trouble to help us and try to spread the knowledge so that more and more people can benefit. This DVD is the result of such generosity.

If you have not practiced qigong before, then you'll find that, in this DVD, Lisa breaks down the basic principles in a very understandable way so that you know what you are dealing with without confusion and mysticism. Then, this DVD will be valuable to you as you start to take responsibility of your own wellbeing and start to discover the abilities that you knew you had since you were born, but forgot about them. In this case, I'd say the DVD is recommendable, but it's more important that you find a good teacher.

If however you have practiced qigong before, I'd say this is a DVD you cannot miss. One step that every serious qigong practitioner encounters is doubt. Your practice inevitably comes to a point where things start to lose flavor. It just does not feel like it used to feel at the beginning. I think of it as a love relationship. At the beginning everything's new and exciting, then things calm down, and that is where some people start looking for someone new... but the best is yet to come, when you start to develop a deep connection with the other person that nothing can compare to! Have you experienced that with your practice? That feeling that you want to look for another qigong series, for another qigong teacher, for another discipline altogether, just to renew the spark of interest? Well, this is where Lisa comes in, because she teaches you in this DVD, with just a handful of simple procedures, to trust in yourself, to guide your practice by your intuition, to be consistent in your practice, and do what you always knew you should do but forgot after the first lesson: to guide the practice by feeling rather than by a set of predefined instructions.",1319587200,16,3054,4.535390199637024
4850898,5,B005O0ABUA,"I am new to qi gong and didn't know what to expect from a DVD. I am impressed with this video. It is very comprehensive. Lisa O'Shea is a natural teacher in front of the camera. She is clear, comfortable and engaging. She brings to her students every day examples that make the workings of something heretofore mystical, easily understandable. i feel like I am in the room with her as she explains and demonstrates the practice.",1319587200,,428,4.571428571428571
4850899,5,B005O0ABUA,"Lisa B O'Shea is a knowledgeable and inspiring teacher in person. This DVD totally captures that same energy. She really demystifies Qi Healing and gives you plenty of useful tools you can use right away.  You learn how to scan yourself or someone else, feel a blockage and actually pull it out of the body. Then she teaches you safe ways to put energy back in.  She talks a lot about the nature of qi/energy in ways you can really understand. I think Lisa B O'Shea's clear and straightforward approach to this dense topic of ""Qi Healing"" makes it a wonderful ""How To"" DVD for anyone at any level of experience.",1319587200,,611,4.495495495495495
4850900,5,B005O0ABUA,I bought this DVD after having several Qigong Healing sessions with Lisa and wanted to learn more about Qigong.  Lisa explains Qigong energy healing in an easy to understand manner that allows a novice like myself to follow along and begin to learn some of the basic Qigong movements.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone with an interest in Qigong whether they are a beginner or advanced student.  Lisa's relaxed style and thorough explanations make this an enjoyable and educational experience.,1319241600,,497,5.036585365853658
4850901,3,B005O0ABUA,"I still need to sit down and watch it start to finish, since I do appreciate all the knowledge and behind the scenes info on Qigong Healing. However, I am a bit disappointed to find that there is very little standing floor exercise to watch a follow---as if you were in a class following an instructor, doing a several qi exercises and then a routine or two. This is not a video to pop in for your daily routine. This seems more like a solid intro to qigong, which is awesome, but you still will want to buy another DVD for regular practice of any length.",1333152000,34,555,4.245283018867925
4850902,4,B005O0ABUA,"Lisa O'Shea has used her 24 years experience of Reiki and 18 years of Qigong and Tai Chi, to develop and present a regimen of coordinated breathing and movement that will benefit practitioners.  She is a certified qigong therapist from Chinese Healing Arts Center, certified qigong instructor from YMAA.

Lisa O'Shea presents 180 minutes of easy-to-follow qigong exercises promote increasing and/or sustaining good health and healing.  The ""no"" impact nature of the exercises offers a great regimen to practitioners with physical restrictions and therefore may be a suitable program for wellness and health programs at businesses and assisted care facilities.

As an martial arts school manager, I believe that Qigong classes can be marketed as a supplement to the standard martial arts program, targeting a clientele who may be interested in an alternative to joining a fitness facility, or more physically demanding health and fitness activities such as running, lifting weights, etc., or maybe just have a hesitancy or aversion to tai chi. This YMAA DVD serves as a great starting place to explore the possibilities of adding qigong to your school curriculum.  Viewers who enjoy this DVD may also be interested in White Crane Hard/Soft Qigong DVD by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming and YMAA.",1332201600,5,1283,5.269607843137255
4850903,5,B005O0ABUA,"Qigong for Healing is an excellent way for the beginner to learn of the benefits that the art of Qigong offers to a practitioner. Lisa O'Shea has broken down the lessons to an excellent introduction to the meaning of Qi and the basic healing theory of Qigong. The instructor explains how energy can be blocked in the body which then interferes with the free flow of Qi.

Ms. O'Shea then goes on to demonstrate that these blockages can be reopened by Qigong movements,  meditation and  massage. She expounds upon how blockages to Qi may be formed by physical, emotional or spiritual problems. The idea behind clearing these detriments to letting energy flow through the body can be accomplished by the practise of Qigong.

The instructor is also very clear in her comparison of Western and Eastern healing techniques and how one can complement the other without taking away from either one. She tells of the main difference between the two is that Western style treats one aspect of an illness while the Eastern way is to treat the whole body in order to treat a specifc illness.

There are very clear and easy to follow demonstrations of meditation technique, Qigong exercises and how to restore energy to the Dan Tien through massage to the body.

All in all, I learned a lot through this DVD instruction and I found it to be an enjoyable and easy to follow demonstration of Qigong Healing to the self and others. I hope that Lisa O'Shea will follow through with more instructional DVDs in the future.  Highly recommended.",1330214400,5,1523,4.746212121212121
4850904,3,B005O0ABUA,"I found this program to be a lot more like Reiki than QiGong.  Lisa O'Shea's voice was like fingernails on a chalk board (soft & squeaky)that didn't allow a relaxed or calming effect.  She has an assistant that tries to demonstrate her 'healing others' techniques using hand healing and when she asks the assistant to describe what she feels while doing the techniques, the assistant has the deer in headlights look and you get the feeling this DVD was not thought out too well and the assistant was looking to Ms. O'Shea for the answer she wanted to hear versus what she was actually feeling.  I do realize these techniques and the feelings obtained are hard to describe but at least have an assistant on your DVD that can at least look like they know what they are doing so people watching the DVD has confidence that they are getting something out of it.  The actual session on healing yourself was not too bad but could have been also better.  If you're looking for QiGong DVDs I'd recommend others before this one.",1328918400,16,1019,4.576923076923077
4850905,5,B005O0ABUA,I have been studying Qigong for some time and would very much have liked to have this DVD as my starting point. Ms. O'Shea is very knowledgeable and yet able to share her depth of understanding in a very accessible manner. This is an excellent introduction to Qigong both academically and from a practical hands-on approach. As a more advanced student of Qigong I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the partner-healing instruction. I agree with other reviewers that it is best to watch this DVD through in its entirety at least once before going back and tackling each section.,1327881600,3,585,4.801980198019802
4850906,5,B005O0ABUA,Qigong for Healing was exactly what I needed when the DVD came into my life.  It is easy to understand and easy to put into practice.  I know I will be spending many hours with this DVD. In just a few sessions I'm already aware of the benefits to my well-being.,1327363200,2,261,4.098039215686274
4850907,5,B005O0ABUA,Qigong for Healing is a very good video for someone who is interested in learning what energy is how it relates to us and how to start using it to better their life. O'Shea does a vary good job at walking people thru what is going on so you can get started.,1325376000,,257,3.9615384615384617
4850908,5,B005O0ABUA,"Everything is Energy, and Energy is "" Chi "".
  This is a must DVD for anyone who truly desires to
  learn this Ancient, Time-Tested and Proven Art for Healing, Meditation,
  Regeneration and Well-Being.
  Lisa's presentation here is very Professional as well as Articulate.
  She gets right down to the "" Nuts & Bolts "" and makes it easy for the average
  lay-person to not only comprehend and understand, but also to apply this Art
  with or without a person. As a Martial Arts practitioner for over 40 years,
  I have to say that Lisa knows her craft!!!
  I've had the opportunity to attend one of Lisa's Work-Shops and what she did
  there is what you will get in this DVD and more. I "" Highly "" recommend this
  DVD and for those of you who are in the Rochester, N.Y. area, I also recommend
  to visit this Highly Skilled Martial Artist at the Rochester Qi-Gong Institute.

4850909,4,B005O0ABUA,"Qi or chi or xi is an as-of-yet-to-be-described-or-measured energy which exists in all living things.  Another way of thinking about it is from the Star Wars universe called the Force.  While all of the Eastern cultures have accepted this fact for several hundred to over a thousand years, but because Western science has not been able to identify, test, measure and quantify qi, it's existence has been ignored and dismissed much like magnetism, radio waves, sun spots, gravity, etc. until there was a way to measure and test the existence and/or relative strengths of them.

Unlike some explorations into this subject I've been exposed to, Ms. O'Shea provides a well-planned, detailed, and methodical explanation of the subject. I found this DVD to be extremely beginner-friendly and easy to integrate into my busy life.  I have yet to be able to fully integrate all of the techniques and precepts, but the changes I have made have definitely made an improvement in my well-being and health.",1323216000,2,993,5.036585365853658

8480860,3,B005O0ABUA,It is certainly a good video for beginners. Too much talking and very little practical movements. Nevertheless good for those that does not know anything about Qigong. Since I have been in Qigong for years this video does not help me much. But it could be useful for starters.,1421280000,3,276,4.653061224489796
8480861,5,B005O0ABUA,"This is a great instructional dvd for the beginner who wants to use the powers of Qigong for self-healing and healing of others.  Lisa O'Shea makes use of a beginner for an assistant, whom she guides through the healing processes.  An advantage of using a beginner for an assistant for this dvd is that the assistant asked a lot of questions that any of us, as beginners, might also likely ask.  Also, Lisa has occasions to repeat some guidance to help it ""sink in"" for those of us that might have forgot along with her assistant....but when this occurs, it is a helpful repetition.  Using a beginner also forces the instructor to offer clear instructions to the assistant,  which is very helpful for the viewer.  The dvd offers what I feel is great information and instruction, all presented in a clear manner that the viewer and student will appreciate and enjoy.",1419033600,2,865,4.695364238410596

8480863,5,B005O0ABUA,Qigong for Healing by Lisa B. O'Shea is a wonderful way to learn the concepts of Qi healing. I have taken Lisa's beginning Qigong workshop and this video covers some of what she teaches in the workshop. The video is easy to follow and you can choose which part you want to review once you have watched the entire video or you can choose what you prefer to learn first. She is a wonderful teacher and her knowledge of Qigong and Qi healing is very diverse. A must have video for anyone wanting to do Qi healing work.,1374537600,3,515,4.26530612244898
8480864,5,B005O0ABUA,I was really impressed with this video. The teacher is very knowledgeable. First time purchasing this type of video. Really impressed would defintely recommend this video to others.,1368057600,2,181,5.5
8480865,1,B005O0ABUA,"I have practiced qigong healing for many years and the information in this video is basic belief but there are a lot of things she says that are simply not true and I feel by spreading these ideas she is putting thoughts in peoples head that does not need to be there.

For example, there is one section where Lisa instructs a student that the heart should feel warm rather then neutral with the rest of the body [this is not true the whole body should feel neutral] and the student seems to get confused and keeps saying no it feels the same. Lisa then keeps saying ""feel it again and see"" like she won't give up even though the student is doing it right.",1356134400,12,656,4.248
8480866,5,B005O0ABUA,"""Qigong for Healing"" is an excellent introductory video to Qigong. I have been practicing and teaching Qigong for several years. I found Lisa's explanations clear, concise and well designed for a beginner viewer. She keeps her focus on key issues and leads you step by step through a set, helping to develop the mind, body, breathing connection that is so vital to successful Qigong practice. I have had the opportunity to meet Lisa in person and I know she is a warm, genuine and highly skilled practitioner. I find her voice soothing and clear like a bell.

I found the ""Self healing"" section of the video fascinating. Lisa provides simple instructions for energetically assessing the body and taking action to clear out blockages. Using an assistant, she creates a teacher-student environment that allows the material to be covered just as she would cover it in one of her seminars. Having an assistant also recognizes that different people experience Qi differently; this opens the door for the beginner to have their own experience within a well defined context. As for Lisa's assistant, I have personally spent hundreds of hours doing Pushing Hands with her in the YMAA Boston studio.  I can state with some certainty that Lisa's assistant's sensitivity to Qi is highly developed. While she may be new to Qigong healing, she has no problem feeling, building, moving and delivering Qi to a partner. Knowing her as I do, I found Lisa's assistant's comments and the assessments of her experience to be genuine and thoughtful.

I look forward to watching the DVD again; integrating parts of it into my classes and deepening my own self healing skills.  GREAT JOB!",1333497600,7,1665,4.956989247311828
