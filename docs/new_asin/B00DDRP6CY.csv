We even developed a liking for Tig even though he was guilty of something horrific. Tara the doctor torn between her love for Jax and the prospect of a life away from crime, is an intriguing character. We watch this series after ""Breaking Bad"" and well it seems a tough call to match the drama of that series, but hey Sons of Anarchy has got everything that literally keeps one spellbound.

5793060,5,B00DDRP6CY,"One of my top ten favorites for a miniseries.  It's full of action that men will enjoy, while working through endless twisted sub-plots that women will appreciate.  The women are strong characters and the motorcycle gang can't shoot straight!  Once you get into it, you realize there isn't any glamorization of motorcycle gangs, as these misfits fail again and again.  They fun is the unpredictable results of their most desperate acts - it will keep you guessing the whole time.  And, then the guest stars keep show up - lots of surprises, cameos and fun, sprinkled into an otherwise dark and morbid under-world.  It's good writing, although the dialog gets stiff and predictable at some points, the plots are delightful.  it's a soap opera with all the spin-off themes that could launch a dozen new lines, but at the end of the day, the motorcycles are very real and they roar so good in HD.  Kudos to Katie Segal, who really steals the show again and again.",1417392000,3,960,4.706586826347305

5793075,5,B00DDRP6CY,"After completing the 5th Season, I'm interested in how the excellent series ""Sons of Anarchy"" mirrors the ""Godfather"" saga. The idealistic son of a crime family decides he wants to get away from the violent actions of his clan, only to find himself dragged in deeper. As he takes over leadership, he becomes more ruthless and murderous, harming the ones he loves and becoming the man he never wanted to be. In the course of this transformation, young Jackson, ""Jax"" Teller (Charles Hunnam) makes you care for him even as you shake your head in dismay.
  That said, it is an original and adventurous ride. What makes SAMCRO work is that it explodes the myth of bikers being a pack of beer-swilling redneck clods. The members are true individuals ranging from Bobby (Mark Boone Junior), the conscience of the club to Tig (Kim Coates), one of the craziest (and oddly endearing) characters ever seen on television. These men can be by turns vicious and tender, compassionate and cold-blooded. But they are never fake. They are amply complimented by the superb Katey Sagal who as Gemma, Jax's mother, controls the action as thoroughly as she controls the men in the club. She describes herself as a fierce ""Mama Bear"" defending her family but she is also Mama Tarantula, spinning webs of intrigue and manipulation that Lady Macbeth could learn from. It's impossible to imagine the show without her.
  The show also works because it grows organically and doesn't play to sentiment. Expect your favorite characters to die. Expect to feel sad when they do because they have become a family that we care about, despite their often criminal and odious actions.",1403222400,9,1650,4.882142857142857
5793076,5,B00DDRP6CY,SAMCRO was up to their own style of living life to the fullest... an eventful series to say the least.  extended cuts in several episodes.,1402272000,5,138,4.52
5793077,5,B00DDRP6CY,"My son told me he watched this series and since it is set in the area of California I am very familiar with I decided to buy it. I am hooked. It is a raw, wild, and addicting. I am in the 3rd season and so far all the discs play perfectly. They were new when bought but you sometimes wonder since they were such a good deal.",1401926400,,324,3.7794117647058822
5793078,5,B00DDRP6CY,I don't have to rent movies that suck anymore because now I have a great series my husband and I can watch instead!  It is so much better than running out and getting some movie that just ends up being a waste of two hours to watch.  Thank you!,1401321600,,244,3.9591836734693877
5793079,5,B00DDRP6CY,These dvd's worked great.  No problems at all with the dvds.  The only time they skipped was due to the dvd player.,1400457600,,115,4.181818181818182

The exterior of the box set was slightly damaged, but most importantly; the plastic binders holding the discs in place on this inside were broken. I sent it back immediately. I'm skeptical if I should reorder and see if I get an undamaged copy, or try to find it in a store.",1519603200,,531,4.648936170212766
