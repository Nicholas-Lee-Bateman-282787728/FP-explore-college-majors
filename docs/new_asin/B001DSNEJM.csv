3537765,4,B001DSNEJM,"""For I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:""

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Ben Garvey (Paul Walker) is an ex-con who has done his crime, his time and his parole, and has just become a free man
2. He has a wife (Piper Perabo) and a daughter to support
3. He loses his job
4. Before the ink on his termination papers is dry, he proves that he's not so reformed after all
5. Big mistake - huge
6. In defiance of several books written by John Grisham, his trial and sentence are over in a jiffy
7. He dies
8. Or does he?
9. He wakes up to find that he has a job as a caretaker at a hospital, a second chance, a guardian angel (Lambert Wilson) and the shadow of Death on his shoulder.
10.  Or does he?

This is a fairly good psychological thriller if you can skirt around the plot holes and stop yourself from screaming at Garvey when he fails to do things that are blatantly obvious to everyone else, or does things that are incredibly dumb.

Walker does a good job in the lead role, and Perabo deserves a medal for tolerance.  Bob Gunton (Rendition, The Shawshank Redemption) is especially effective as Father Ezra, the administrator of the hospital, and Wilson shows some of his Matrix mettle even though his is a relatively small part.

A good one to rent, if only to watch Paul Walker come forth

Rated: 3.5 stars

3537766,4,B001DSNEJM,"A trip of a film...I thought about how to title this film the whole time I was watching it...the best I could come up with is; What a Trip..a truly psychological ride of (in the end) an anti-smoking film.

Films like these can be debated for a long time as to when reality blurs into fiction and if the film actually ever occurs at certain points. I saw this as an approachable film with little recognition that can be attained by the masses. Bob Gunton. Piper Perabo and Brooklynn Proulx all perform in a film that I fear will be forgotten in the mass of subpar indie films coming out this quarter.

Nothing should be explained much beyond a man experiencing a strange life of getting second chances, numerology, psychiatric misappropriation, innocent family love, and a beautiful filming location character of Canada. This is the second film in as many days (coming out this week) that shows what a splendor our Northern neighbor has.

I was pleasantly surprised by the score, content and sublime symbolism that permeates this piece. Many critics have afforded their worthless opinions of how this film failed because of PW, but I would say give this film a chance and maybe you will be entertained by a solid psychological thriller worth watching more than once. Two deleted scenes are included to add some character content, but nothing else to speak of for the DVD. The film quality is good, and between this and Bobby Z, PW has proven he has range.",1224201600,18,1454,4.694117647058824
3537767,5,B001DSNEJM,"Please note that the actor you are listing as Pierbo should be PERABO, as in Piper Perabo not Pierbo.
The rating is only based on the fact that Piper Perabo is in this film. I have not yet seen the movie as it hasn't been released yet.",1218499200,4,235,4.0212765957446805

3537792,3,B001DSNEJM,"This movie i picked up because i thought it was Lazarus Effect,however i found myself intrigued by the story. The movie starts off with Paul Walker with his family,then he gets fired(because of his prior police record) & his brother gets out of jail convieniently to offer his brother(Walker) to a great heist of 30 pounds of untraceable gold dust. When he picks up the offer he finds his brother is in debt and if the job does not get done Walkers brother will be killed. So needless to say they attempt the heist,a girl working flips the silent alarm & the cops come and shoot his brother as well as the debtor and an innocent worker. Then he is sent to prison to be executed,next thing you know he wakes up in Oregon(he was living in Texas with the wife and daughter) as the caretaker for a sanitarium. He keeps trying to leave and is told by strangers on the ground not to leave or he will die. He gets on a bus,then gets off and it crashes. So it is somewhat of a warning,or so he thinks. He talks to a troubled patient telling him that there are eyes on him at all times,he starts to dig up clues. He keeps finding a stick man picture etched into skin,and inbetween logs and stuff. He sees a dog and takes him in then next thing you know he wakes up with the head of this ""sanitarium"" tells him his wife never existed,he is a patient and not a caretaker. So it is a mind trip(sorta like Shutter Island) but he keeps scratching his arm, which has an implanted computer chip in him which monitors his every move. At the end he realizes that he is part of an elaborate scheme to take troubled people and brainwash them  into believing a different reality. Walker freaks  out and then decides too leave the sanitarium that reprograms brains to make them better. The way that the film ends is he just goes home to his wife and kids. To me the film was anticlimactic,i was hoping there would be more to it. All in all if you like psychological thrillers go get it or watch it. 3 stars in my opinion.",1442707200,,1999,4.271767810026385

3537818,3,B001DSNEJM,"I always enjoy Paul Walker's work outside of the Fast and Furious brand (although I do enjoy his work in the fast and furious brand as well). I have to say that his acting in this movie was excellent, but the movie itself had strange pacing. Some scenes seemed to drag on while others seemed move too quickly. The overall concept of the movie was easy to follow, but some of the finer details were a little fuzzy.
I'm not sure if this is because of editing or certain things were just not fully explained in the story in general. Either way, I would recommend watching this especially if you are a fan of Paul Walker and want to see some of his other work.",1430697600,,656,4.256

3537837,4,B001DSNEJM,"I'll start this review off saying that I am a huge Paul Walker fan - they are a few movies of his that are flat out bad, but this isn't one of them (I would stay away from Running Scared). I usually pretty easy to entertain as well - this movie is a little predictable, but I still enjoyed it - and it has me wanting to see The Lazarus Effect coming out this week (the two movies are not related, but similar storyline I would imagine - bringing someone back to life).",1424736000,,468,4.043010752688172

3537841,3,B001DSNEJM,"This movie was alright. It was an interesting story about the life of an excon named Ben. The story took its time to build a strong base, but once things began to get very intriguing, the story just sped by. It hadn't given enough time to be confused or to be stunned by the twist. After the twist, the movie ended quite soon. They should've taken more time to let the story sink in. The leading actor, Paul Walker is the reason i watched this, and the reason the movie got 3 stars, great actor.",1423094400,,495,4.221052631578948

I admit I was surprised by the twists in the storyline.  This was a really good psychological thriller, and Mr. Walker's performance was (I believe) somewhat low-key and unpretentious as a guy who has no choice but to go with the flow of events around him.

3537949,4,B001DSNEJM,"The Lazarus Project is a highly imaginative film and a refreshingly original concept by writer/producer John Glenn. The story follows Ben Garvey (Paul Walker), a family man with a troubled past. When his family hits hard times, the only thing left for him to do, is turn to what he is good at, committing crime. Unfortunately for him, this time someone dies during the crime and he is given a death sentence. As he's in the execution chamber, the drugs pump into him, and that should be the end of the story, but it's not. Garvey awakes seemingly unharmed and reborn in a small Oregon town, in the middle of nowhere. He's told that he's been given a second chance, but quickly figures out that all is not as it seems. The Lazarus Project is full of twists and turns and is kind of similar to Shutter Island. We see a lot of things and changes that we're not sure are real or in Garvey's imagination, that's why I loved this movie. The film makes you think and actually figure things out for yourself. Unlike many similar films, Glenn doesn't just assume we're a bunch of idiots and puts us right alongside Ben Garvey as we figure out what's going on. The story is pure genius, but if this way my project I would have chosen a different star. Sure, Paul Walker is nice to look at, and does an adequate job, but this is a highly emotional story that doesn't play to his strengths as an actor. Walker didn't convincingly portray the emotions of the given situations and made their effect less dramatic. This film is also painfully slow at times, but the good most definitely out weighs the bad. The Lazarus Project is original and will keep you guessing, which sadly, is something most films today can't claim.",1361491200,2,1707,4.509677419354839

It is not an easy movie to watch, some of it is quite disturbing and yet he lets his character flow so smoothly.  The cast that plays with him works well and the story has a happy ending.  Paul should be given more opportunities to show his acting talent in more serious roles (Oscar winning type of roles).

3537952,4,B001DSNEJM,"Very strange indeed. I was reminded of a Johnny Depp movie, something about a mental hospital on an island, but I can't find it on IMDB. Maybe it wasn't Depp but some other hunk I love.

Anyway, Ben (Paul Walker) had just been released from parole when his brother showed up with an idea for a robbery that went terribly wrong, and three people were killed, including his brother. Ben is sentenced to die by lethal injection. (This is Texas; they are really into capital punishment.)

But after they shoot him full of drugs on a cruciform gurney, he wakes up elsewhere. On a road on the way to an out-of-the-way mental hospital run by a Catholic order, where he has been offered the job of groundskeeper.

And then it REALLY gets weird. What's real and what is not? Ben doesn't know, and the audience certainly doesn't either. But in the end, Ben sorts it out and we do, too. It's a very dark and stormy movie (including literally, as the hospital is in the Willamette Valley in Oregon), but it has a happy ending.

Paul Walker looks really familiar. *Back to the IDMB* Right. He's done a lot of TV, and several other movies, but nothing I remember. Was he the hunk in the Dove for Men commercial?",1336694400,,1197,4.4520547945205475

How one likes & rates this Movie is so very subjective to how one looks at life, how one understands Psychology and how one can relate. I've given it 5 Stars because it definitely captured me and gave me to think.",1327017600,2,523,4.24
3537955,2,B001DSNEJM,"*Possible spoilers*

""The Lazarus Project"" is a movie with an intriguing premise, but a not so intriguing execution. It is about Ben Garvey (Paul Walker), an ex con, who tries to live a straight life after his probation has finally ended, but who gets laid off from his job because of his criminal background and, desperate for money to support his family, agrees to go on a heist with his brother and steal gold in dust from a laboratory. The mission goes awfully wrong, however, and three people end up dead, except for Ben - who survived only because he was in the back packing up the stuff. Somehow the jury convicts him for being responsible for the deaths of those three people and he is sentenced to death. When he wakes up, he finds himself in the town of Dundee, Oregon, working as groundskeepers and being told that he needs to leave his past life behind and move forward. Strange things start happening and that is where the story unfolds.

As mentioned above, while this was an interesting story with a truly titillating premise, it was poorly executed and Ben wasn't the the only one for whom things didn't quite add up. There were just a lot of inconsistencies in there and huge plot holes that ultimately resulted in making this a totally unbelievable story.

First and foremost, no one acts like you'd expect them. I mean who gets executed, even in the state of Texass, for accessory to second degree murder and fails ALL appeals? Ben Garvey didn't even pull the trigger, he didn't even have a gun, yet he gets _executed_ and everyone talks about what a horrible criminal he is who needs rehabilitation - like he was some serial killer or rapist or some other demented violent offender, even though clearly he went stealing out of necessity and not because he is a psycho. Speaking of which: who turns to a life of crime and risks serious incarceration and losing his family because he lost his job. Why didn't he just collect unemployment and went talking to his parole officer to find him a job? That just didn't make sense. Maybe that wasn't an option but if that is the case, the writers should have somehow put that in there instead of just ignoring it and hoping it will go unnoticed.

It is a sign of bad acting and bad writing when characters in movies don't behave like you would expect a person in real life to behave. Yes we all know this is a movie but some resemblance to reality helps increasing the credibility and quality of said movie. I mean, who greets a person they believe dead and whose funeral they attended, like he just came back from vacation? If someone I believed dead stood at my door, I would pass out, not give them a tender hug.

If this is a rehabilitation facility, does that mean an entire town has been dedicated to it? Since there were no guards and everyone could roam around freely and had internet access etc., how did they imagine to shield people from their old lives? Since the the mother and daughter at the cafe are the same mother and daughter in the second set up video about real estate, then the whole town must have been in on this. But, how is all this funded? It seems like a huge undertaking and you do wonder who would fund such a thing,  especially in a state that is notorious for harsh incarcerations and where people are apparently executed for robbery.

There seem to be hidden cameras everywhere but if they had a camera in there filming him, wouldnt they have found the picture that slipped under the cabinet? How is it rehabilitation to brainwash and manipulate a person into believing they are insane and imagined it all? How is that helping anyone? The exchange Garvey has with the project leader in the end was unintelligent and touched the issue of rehabilitation of criminals only superficially. In fact, it was done so poorly, it made people advocating for rehabilitation of criminals versus execution appear to be nothing but insane, deluded nut jobs themselves. That certainly didn't help the cause or accurately outline the debate. And what's up with the ""demon"" we see in the shadows? Arr you telling me that people in the business of rehabilitating criminals put on costumes and lurk on dark corners to scare the ""inmates"" from leaving by making them believe some demon will go after them if they leave town?

This movie is full of such inconsistencies and a lot of it just didn't make sense. Suspending disbelief is ok, but not to this degree. This was an interesting and suspenseful movie but I think it didn't do a good job at creating an even semi-solid, coherent and believable movie without gaping plot holes. I don't get why anyone would give this 4 or 5 stars as the immense plot holes and inconsistencies were staggering.",1325894400,7,4719,4.602853745541022

Will he be able to put his finger on it? Will he be dispatched again? Or incarcerated in the very Institute that he is the groundskeeper of? Watch and see is been in his trusty dog discover the secret of the Lazarus Project.

3537958,3,B001DSNEJM,"Paul Walker did a good job in this movie, but the movie itself was lacking a little something more.  The build up to the resolution was good, but it just seemed that once you find out what was going on, it ended.  The resolution could've had a little more meat to its bones.  There was so much potential there.  Better writers would've made this movie great!

SPOILER ALERT:  The one aspect that I just can't come to terms with, is Ben's ability to ""hack"" into the computer without using a password.  I'm sorry, but that was just NOT believable.  There's no way that he had to break into a building or a room, then have full access to the computer WITHOUT password protection.  Yeah, that's completely BS, especially with the information that was on that computer.  They could've ended the movie better as well.  There's NO WAY that those guys would let Ben just ""walk"" without some sort of exciting pursuit, changing of identity, moving or running...something.  Maybe they are setting up for a sequel?

Ben refuses the invitation but he is fired from his job because of his record; he decides to join Ricky and his partner Phelps in the robbery. However things go wrong and Ricky, Phelps and a security guard die in the heist and Ben is sentenced to death for the murders. After his execution through lethal injection, Ben awakes working as housekeeper of the Monte Angel community in Dundee, Oregon, for Father Ezra, who explains to him that his past life is gone and now he is having a second chance. However he should never cross the boundaries of the location, otherwise he would die. Ben feels confused with the weird situation but he can not forget Lisa and Katie and forces Ezra to give a plausible explanation to him. But while working in the garden, Ben finds a frisby on the grass; he investigates and discloses the secret of the facility. A psychological thriller that will make you think from the the beginning to the end.

What they didn't prevent is how the last human specimen would be far to react according the theory. A man of dark background who once was released understood and assimilated the value of the family as life's project. That feeling will be the key liberator that will break the impossed laws.

So let me get this figured out.  The State of Texas Justice Department and Corrections Department have conspired with this ""Lazurus Project"" to do what again?  Not carry out justice as required by the state or the jury of his peers.  Give him another chance?  Bizaare!

All that aside the film is very interesting.  It's different for sure.  But the question is what do they tell all those who thought he was executed?  What happens when he goes for employment?  ""Sir, we did a background check and we would love to give you this job, but you have been executed for murder.""

3537966,3,B001DSNEJM,"I was surprised how good this movie was.  A bit of a shame it wasn't released in theaters while other worse films were.  The Lazarus Project isn't amazing, but it nails it's goal as a psychological thriller.  Definitely worth seeing, and if you're just looking for a psychological thriller you haven't seen, and won't be disappointed by, get this.

The plot twists are managed very well; you don't know what is really going on until near the end.  I thought the final scene was a bit over the top, but the overall experience of watching the movie was suspensful and kept me engaged to want to see what was going to happen next, and care for the main character, Ben.  I was hoping he'd remember this or that, etc.  Other than that very last scene, I can't think of any other faults with the movie at all...it doesn't bite off more than it can chew. It isn't Se7en, and it doesn't try to be.  A lot of movies ruin themselves like that.

Anyway, this is a good movie.  Check it out.",1229990400,7,979,4.359116022099448

Those who are expecting some fast paced, action oriented flick with creatures galore are bound to be disappointed. This one is more of a character based, thoughtful, slow but usually interesting story.  Paul Walker is great as the main character, who thought he was dying by lethal injection but who turns out to be a subject of a rehab experiment spearheaded by Bob Gunton.  Linda Cardellini is a sympathetic associate, while Piper Perabo plays the saddened wife very well, with a lovely daughter portrayed by Brooklynn Proulx.
Worth a look.",1225929600,,559,5.054347826086956
3537968,4,B001DSNEJM,"I bought this video being that I am Paul Walker fan. The movie was ok by the end, but real slow to start. The movie points don't really start until about 40minutes in, which can make you lose interest. But, if you are willing to wait it out, the ending is worth it!!!",1225756800,3,267,4.056603773584905
3537969,3,B001DSNEJM,"""The Lazarus Project"" aka ""The Heaven Project"" is one of those straight-to-DVD releases, which was okay i guess, though after viewing it, I felt this was a lot better than some other actual cinematic releases that were pure drivel.

Paul Walker [of The Fast and the Furious] plays Ben Garvey, an ex-con who is just getting his life back on track with a beautiful, supportive wife [Piper Perabo] and young daughter. But his past catches up with him and his no-gooder brother comes back into his life with a solution - robbery - well, things go terribly awry resulting in fatalities, and Ben is left to shoulder the guilt and blame. He is sentenced to die by lethal injection and that is when the movie actually begins.

Ben finds himself getting a sort of 'reprieve' from death and is whisked away to an psychiatric facility somewhere out in the boondocks and is given the job of groundskeeper - the people that he comes into contact are all either strange or sinister or both - the priest Ezra [Bob Gunton]who runs the facility, Robbie [Malcolm Goodwin] a mentally challenged patient, William [Tony Curran] a violent inmate, psychiatrist Julie [Linda Cardellini] who warms up to Ben very quickly, and a stranger [Lambert Wilson] who pops up at the most inopportune times to warn Ben that something's afoot.

The movie takes its time to unfold, but what carries this movie through is not just the storytelling, with its unique premise, but Paul Walker's performance - I know, he's not exactly known for his acting chops, but he does a pretty decent job here of lending credibility to his character. I actually came to care about what happened to Ben in this movie. All in all, this was a decent thriller with a good premise.",1225065600,58,1723,4.717607973421927
3537970,5,B001DSNEJM,"I rented this movie on Netflix, so got it the day it released.  I'm a Walker fan, but had prepared myself for a less-than-wonderful performance given it went straight to video, but I was delighted with what I saw.

Bottom line?  I really enjoyed this picture.  I'll be buying a copy of the DVD and will definitely be watching it again..  but mostly I JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT WENT STRAIGHT TO DVD!!
I found myself sitting on the edge of my seat during the movie, I went through a range of emotions.  There were no gratuitous sections (violence, love scenes or any other).  There was no fluff, the acting was very good - it was easy to forget these are actors and I got into the characters.
Weak points - the part of brother wasn't acted terribly well, a couple of parts of the story (but not the plot) were a bit weak, esp the premise around why he went back to a life of crime felt a bit ""thin"" to me - probably a result of rushing just a bit to get to the ""real"" story - post the lethal injection.

I hope others enjoy this movie as much as I did and talk about it - spread the word.",1224806400,4,1089,4.10377358490566

8294717,3,B001DSNEJM,"It's ok. Paul Walker does a great job as does the rest of the cast and the filmography is done very well. However, the plot is a little too overwrought and feels much longer than it's 1:40 run time. The comparisons to Shutter Island are pretty valid and where The Lazarus Project differs in premise and plot, it still mostly feels like you've seen this before.",1507161600,,360,4.46969696969697

8294720,3,B001DSNEJM,"Anything with Paul Walker will fly, and without being disrespectful, after his tragic early death, this interesting showcase for his acting talents as a man reborn into a rehabilitated second life he doesn't want has an additional dimension.

It is clearly a low budget offering which works efficiently through various cinematic codes which one has seen countless times before: the constant rain, the half lit forest and shadowy figures, the minimalist wood cabin, the view of the outside world and horizon from a peak, the old-fashioned sanatorium with its dark spooky corridors and easy to break through wooden doors, the strange inmates, the weird scrpbook/diary with its symbols and drawings; the beguiling helpful staff, the camera hidden behind a wall mirror, the electronic implant under the skin ad nauseum.

There's a lot for the main character to deal with - though I must say, as with his role in the Fast and Furious movies, I found myself having little sympathy for him. Whether this is a function of the reason why he was in this situation - basically he was a criminal. Or whether as an actor he just doesn't spark any empathy or connection with me I don't know. Probably both.

The rest of the movie despite a fine performance in particular from Bob Gunton as ""Father Ezra"" a sort of spiritual guide in a soulless environment (I feel it's like that in post-Brexit Britain) as well as (rather oddly I thought) Lambert Wilson as an orderly/hospital tech and a couple of female actors who's only function in the movie is to look deep into Paul Walker's blue eyes and sigh wistfully, is hobbled by lack of pace and rather limited plot development after we get the basic idea of what is going on half way through.

I also thought that the two performances of the other ""re-habs"" Tony Curran and Malcolm Goodwin were very well acted. So from the point of view of acting this film is well worth watching. In fact this is what KEPT me watching.

I would like to give it four stars but I can't because it falls into that category of highly watchable, strangely attractive movie (I have a list of them...like for example Danny Boyle's odd ""Sunshine"") even compelling and addictive films, which I know I will watch again but for what reason I don't know.

Because they are full of holes.",1493337600,,2292,4.7175

8294722,2,B001DSNEJM,"I'm a little flabbergasted by the good reviews for this film.  Paul Walker plays a man with a wife and child who loses his job and in desperation gets involved with a robbery that goes bad.  He is executed in Texas by lethal injection and inexplicably wakes up in a new life as a groundskeeper for a Christian insane asylum in Oregon.

The Lazarus Project is boring nonsense that feels like a Twilight Zone episode directed by Andrei Tarkovsky--it's slow-moving and pretentious and boring.  It also doesn't help that Paul Walker wasn't a resourceful enough dramatic actor to carry a film like this.  He just isn't very interesting to watch and seems to have virtually no dramatic range.  He tended to be most effective in movies like Running Scared; The Death and Life of Bobby Z and The Fast & Furious films because they didn't force him to stand around for long stretches and act.

This one did nothing for me--the story made little logical sense in the end and getting there wasn't very entertaining anyway.  This is one DVD, unfortunately, that's going straight in the garbage bin.",1483315200,,1085,4.73404255319149
