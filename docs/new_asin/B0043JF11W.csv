8415002,1,B0043JF11W,"Played tracks 1-8 perfect.
Started to play track 9 and stoped. Could not play 10, 11, 12.
Returned the disc and received another; which had exactly the same problem.
I have two high quality Blue-ray Players; both had exactly the same results with both discs.

The first 8 tracks were outstanding. Would like to have a disc with all the tracks.

Was refunded for the disc.",1301702400,,371,4.606060606060606
