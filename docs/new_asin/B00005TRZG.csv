7954068,1,B00005TRZG,"Non-anamorphic presentation is dead by 2008 yet Vanguard Cinema again flogs a dead horse and releases a letter boxed version.  The cover says 1.85:1 Widescreen but buyer beware, it IS NOT anamorphic so be prepared to have the zoom handy and get used to low resolution.",1496448000,,268,4.826086956521739
7954069,4,B00005TRZG,"This is an interesting portrayal of Germany in the 1930's.  While Levi, the Jewish cattle trader is the focus of the movie, it is really just a frame around a bigger picture.  While Levi sees life long friendships and business relationships severed in a short span, it's the motivation of those severing these ties that is the most telling part of the movie.  As it is often the case, putting the right pressure on economic interests can lead to remarkable ""change or heart"" of those in opposition.

Mostly placid rural community gets disrupted by a railroad maintenance crew from Berlin who arrived to repair collapsed tunnel.  The Berliners are vocal Nazi followers and clash with some of the villagers who have very low opinions of Hitler.  But by and by, many of the villagers come around and try to please Berliners -- mostly due to fear of losing out economically.  For example, a local farmer refuses to sell a cow to Levi, Jewish middle man who used to buys his cows for many years.  This is despite the fact that Levi offers a very good price.  Instead the farmer sells his cow to the Berliners at a loss, hoping it earns him some respect with the Nazis and more business in the future.  Farmer's wife also starts to come around, although she's still upset for losing the money they could have made had they sold their cow to Levi.  But at last she's convinced by her husband that they need to sail with the new wind blowing out of Berlin.  So she takes a lipstick away from her daughter, Lisbeth given to her by Levi and forbids her to associate with a Jew.  Then secretly the mother puts the lipstick on, enjoys looking at herself in a mirror for a moment, only to wipe it off with disgust for giving in to vanity.  Being, good, obedient German wife, going along with whatever may seem good and official is more important than long standing relationships or her daughter's welfare.

Another example is a local ""good-for-nothing,"" jobless pest who even offends the Berliners at first, but later turns into a Nazi followers to earn some respect from them.  Jointly the Berliners and some of the locals find new ways to enjoy themselves, destroying Levi's property.  However, the fun isn't just to impoverish a successful business man, but more importantly to humiliate him and trample on anything he holds dear.  In the end, it's Lisbeth the farmer's daughter who alone shows any character and stands up to the Nazis.  She is the only one in the village who can see what is happening to their community in disbelief and shocked at the behavior of everyone she knows, including her parents.  When Levi's life is threatened Lisbeth take a radical action to save him, regardless of the potentially grave consequences for her.",1364601600,,2731,4.673640167364017

7954071,4,B00005TRZG,"I have seen Rodkin's work from film school and was very happy to hear of his feature, ""Big Heart City.""  I was also happy to see how Andrews' character tries to make things right after a long absence.  It's a great story and a must-see.",1271721600,2,236,4.222222222222222
7954072,4,B00005TRZG,"This is a well-acted, poignant film, though I'm not convinced that it is an authentic portrayal. It seems to say that the vulnerable country folk are manipulated by the intrusive Nazi menace, destroying the formerly pleasant relations they had with the Jew, Levi. But Germany, like most of Europe has a savage and repetitive history of anti-semitism that preceded the Nazis by hundreds of years. Ostracism and violence against Jews were not unusual, they were only more overt at some times than others. So, would Levi have felt so apparently confident in his dealings with the villagers? The director perhaps assumes that viewers will have a familiarity with European anti-semitism that most do not.",1143331200,4,699,5.140350877192983
7954073,5,B00005TRZG,"This is a fantastic film and fantastic writing. Everything is both simple and complicated at the same time. The story may seem straightforward, but the emotions take you on a wild roller-coaster ride. Everything makes sense at the end, but it's not a very pretty picture. This film shows how there are so many little, and big ways we indulge in hatred and violence. It's also tastefully shot and lays off heavily editing or techniques to drive home the point - something Hollywood could learn a lot from.
Like No Man's Land, Focus, Indochine, and Kippur; we get a real glimpse of the way that war creeps up on us and brings out the worst in people. Unlike the rash of sentimental crappy Hollywood soldier stories this one comes closer to what I would think the truth really is - that the lovely bonding that happens between soldiers is the ugly faade of the fact that civilians caught in war don't need it in order to bond together; they would bond together just fine without it.",1072396800,3,979,4.568181818181818
