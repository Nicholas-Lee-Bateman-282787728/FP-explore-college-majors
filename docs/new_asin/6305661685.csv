1059337,5,6305661685,"I have done yoga off and on for over 20 years and this is one of the best videos I have found--good for beginning-intermediate yoga practitioners or someone like me who is restarting yoga after some time off. Alan Finger does a wonderful job of patiently guiding you through the poses. But the best thing about this videotape is that by the time you are finished with the 55-minute program, most all the muscles in your body feel stretched and loose and you feel great both physically and mentally. It's a very well-rounded set of poses. I would recommend it highly.",979344000,18,566,4.6138613861386135
1059338,3,6305661685,"this is ok if you don't have much time and can't make it to group practise in a real yoga studio.  the good thing is that they go through a very  thorough set of postures and alan finger does an excellent job of  communicating how the proper expression of that posture should feel, even  though he's not there to critique you. the bad thing is that they only do  each posture once so you don't get a real good stretch or strengthening in  any one position or muscle group. the girls demonstrating seem a little  uncomfortable and camera shy at times but finger remains calm, cool and  relaxed and in complete command of the subject. will help if you use a real  yoga mat. i tried with a traditional exercise mat and slid around a few  times reducing the effectiveness of the posture.",967507200,15,783,4.4125874125874125
1059427,3,6305661685,"Too basic at the beginning and too much emphasis on breathing. I don't like the teacher's voice.

1059428,5,6305661685,"Yoga Zone - Flexibility and Tone (Beginners) does not disappoint.  While it has several poses from the other Yoga Zone videos it incorporates them in a different series of moves.  I am a true yoga beginner, I just started 3 weeks ago.  If you have done yoga this may not be the right video for you.  It is for beginners per the title.  The music, vocal tone, lack of trying to rush you through a series of poses and a noncompetative feel make this a great place to start.",1317859200,3,471,4.247191011235955
1059429,5,6305661685,Yoga zone fan. Forever and always. I have learned more from yoga zone videos than I ever did in a yoga class!,1317600000,2,109,4.0
1059430,4,6305661685,"This is one of the longer Yoga Zone practices led by founder Alan Finger.  It's labeled as being for beginners, and although Alan does offer a good deal of form pointers, I think the practice would be most appropriate for experienced beginner to intermediate practitioners.  The setting is an indoor studio, and Alan leads Yoga Zone instructors Lisa and Michelle; Michelle shows more modified versions of the postures, sometimes using props.

The practice begins on the floor, where Alan leads you through ujayyi breath while in a seated postured and then moves into a potted palm series.  Kneeling poses follow, including cat, active cat, and lunge, and you finish with down dog and standing forward bend before moving to a standing position.  Once standing, Alan moves through two series of sun breath and then two series of sun worship (aka sun salutations).  Next comes a sequence of standing postures:  triangle, standing quad stretch, side angle pose, and warrior 2, performed all on one side before switching to the other side.  The standing work finishes with wide-angle standing forward bend and squat.

Returning to the floor, Alan first has you practice sitting in staff pose, then balance in scale (boat) posture.  Next comes cow-face pose to open up both the hips and the shoulders, and finally, full seated forward bend.  At this point, Alan has you roll down to the floor for savasana, and my one complaint is that he doesn't do any twists to release the spine before having you lie full on your back.  He does lead you through a nice savasana where he has you tense and release various parts of the body, and he concludes the practice in a seated position for a total time of about 51 minutes.

Overall, this was a nice practice.  I didn't enjoy it quite as much as my favorite Yoga Zone, Flexibility and Stress Release, which I find both more challenging than this one and more relaxing, but still, this is another solid Yoga Zone offering, especially for those newer to yoga.",1217203200,5,1993,4.806451612903226
1059431,4,6305661685,"I like this tape.  I would like it more if it included more backbend poses.  I don't like speeding through poses because I also do aerobic dance and step for heart health.  I do yoga for flexibility and strength.  I do one hour of yoga a day and I alternate hour-long Alan Finger tapes with Yoga Journal (Rodney Yee, Suzanne Deason, and Patricia Walden) tapes.",1187827200,,360,4.492307692307692
1059432,3,6305661685,"This is a great dvd for those new to yoga as Alan Finger directs 2 women while they do the poses while he speaks.
Other reviewers wrote the poses, so I'll just add, if you like lengthy instruction above & beyond the basics & no silence, this is for you. If you like less talking, try Gaiam's or other beginner yoga dvds.
Yoga Zone relies heavily on using mats, straps (you can use a belt instead), blocks & blankets. Don't feel you have to go bankrupt & buy these in order to do the poses correctly. Just do the best you can & through practice you'll get better.. it's doing it that feels wonderful, being aware of your body & getting the circulation going, not concentrating on being perfect, just don't do anything that is painful.

1059433,5,6305661685,We are in our mid-50's just trying yoga for the first time. We loved this video. We could actually do it and felt great afterwards.,1151884800,6,131,4.28
1059434,5,6305661685,"I just recently bought this video and can't believe the difference it's made! I'm more flexible than I've ever been, and my legs are firm and strong again.

While this is a good beginner's video in terms of learning the postures effectively, I don't recommend buying this as a 'first-time' video, as some of the postures may be a bit tricky or confusing. However, if you're in the process of learning, this tape is for you.

This routine doesn't do much for abs or upper body toning, but your legs will get worked. And, it definitely delivers on the flexiblity. A great program!",1143417600,7,578,4.601941747572815
1059435,5,6305661685,"After not practising yoga for 20+ years, I have recently returned to practicing yoga.  Although I was an intermediate yoga practitioner back then, I knew I needed to start at the beginning so I bought the Premiere Collection from Yoga Zone.  What a gem it is!

This is the perfect program to follow Introduction to Yoga.  It has the right balance between exercises to tone and exercises to increase flexibility for beginners.  Alan Finger is a very low key instructor who does not get into the viewer's face, but at the same time suceeds in giving clear and thorough instruction for each pose.

Anyone who finds this program boring just doesn't understand the nature of this style of yoga.  If you have never done yoga before, or if you are accustomed to power yoga, you need to understand that there are different styles of yoga.  This style of yoga is done is a slow, almost contemplative style that concentrates on correct form and on breathing.  If you do the postures correctly, you can spend a lifetime doing them and still find small adjustments to make every time you do the posture.  The object of this type of yoga is to assume the posture, and make small corrections to your posture while also concentrating on your breathing.  The goal is to occupy the mind with the minutiae of correct posture and breathing so that the mind is stilled and the practitioner is immersed in the present, rather than letting your mind run on about other things.  This is not a simple exercise, even for the simplest posture.  If you are bored, it's because you are not doing it right, plain and simple.",1142553600,11,1595,4.633451957295374
1059436,5,6305661685,"I recently got the four tape Yoga Zone Beginners Set. So far I've done three of them (Introduction to Yoga, Conditioning and Stress Release and this morning Flexibility and Tone).

 By way of background, I've been doing Yoga every day for the past 9 years, both with an extensive collection of programs (over 90 VHS/DVD) and many years with an amazing teacher!

  I can't express enough how great a teacher Alan Finger is and how great Yoga Zone programs are in general. From these longer programs to the shorter ones (which usually have 2-20 minute programs) they are masterfully sequenced and lend an incredible amount of variety to enable one to keep their practice interesting, to fit them into one's schedule and to choose one that best fits one's needs on any given day.

 This program in particular is about an hour long,which allows the pace to be very relaxed and the poses to be held nice and long. Of the three I've done from this set it is the most physically challenging while still being very doable. For someone who is a stone beginner I would recommend starting with either Yoga Zone ""Basics"" or ""Introduction To Yoga"" to get a feel for what Yoga is about. Still, it wouldn't take long before they'd be ready for this program.

 This particular practice session has Alan Finger leading Michelle Carillo (who shows modified postures) and Lisa Bennett (Matkin) through the practice. They both have a beautiful practice and I find them inspiring to work with along w/ Yogiraj Finger.

 It starts with seated (""Potted Palm"") movements to gently warm you up into the practice. After that you move into all fours for cat stretches, lunges, dog pose etc. eventually leading to Sun Breaths and Sun Salutes (he calls them Sun Worship on this program) and then standing poses (Triangle, Intense forward bend (Parsvottanasana), Side angle pose and Warrior 2 pose). You then work back down to the floor and end in Cow Face pose, seated Forward bending and end with a nice guided Savasana. I'm sure I left quite a bit out, this is merely an overview of the structure of the practice.

 I find Alan Finger to be a true master teacher and a true Yogi (as opposed to a fitness person doing a Yoga program, though some, such as Kathy Smith and Janis Saffell, have excellent programs).

 If you have an hour to spare and want to take yourself on a wonderful Yoga Journey then I highly recommend this program.

 Namaste",1138406400,11,2416,4.687203791469194
1059469,5,6305661685,"I read about how yoga is supposed to relax you and help you become more toned and flexible. I picked this video up at my local library and immediately popped it into my VCR. I fell in love with it! The master, Alan, is a genius..to put it mildly. He walks you through the yoga exercises and makes you feel so relaxed. The soft background music is the perfect addition to help you relax. Some of those reviewers who said the video was too ""boring"", I dunno what they were thinking about. Yoga is about the breathing and rejuvenation of mind and body...not some bouncy, high energy workout with fast paced music..this isn't aerobics.

I did the entire workout...roughly 55 minutes. I have to say afterwards, I felt like a new person. My body was more energetic, I was a lot more flexible...and my emotional health was better too. I wasn't cranky or irritable. This video is wonderful. If you have an hour a day to do it, I strongly suggest doing the whole workout. But even 15 minutes a day can help too.

I would STRONGLY recommend this video/dvd to anyone...beginners, intermediate, masters. If you're a yoga practicer, don't miss it!",1137628800,6,1134,4.608910891089109
1059470,5,6305661685,"I am a total beginner when it comes to Yoga. I bought a DVD a few months back for beginners and I did not like it. I tried a beginners yoga class at the fitness center at my office and I felt that I could've gotten into it. Unfortunatley it was the only beginners class they offered and I am not good enough or confident enough to go to the ""real"" class. I was searching online for another beginnger's yoga DVD and I came across this one. After reading other reviews that raved about it, I thought ""Why not?""  I tried it this past weekend and I thought it was wonderful! The instruction was great.  I didn't have a problem doing any of the poses and I liked how he described the breathing technique.  When I was done I actually had to check the DVD case to see how long the video was. Imagine my surprise when it said ""about 55 minutes.""  Not sure if that's wrong or not because it most certainly did not feel that long!!

I encourage any one who is a newbie to Yoga to try this video.  It helps to have a slight knowledge of how to do some of the poses, but it's not really necessary, as the instructor suggested watching the video first, then doing it.",1119830400,6,1154,4.1524663677130045
1059471,5,6305661685,"I really like the pace and instruction in this video. Alan stands or sits in the back and tells how to get in the pose, etc and has a very calming voice. 2 ladies demo..I think one is Lisa Bennet and not sure of the other, but the modifies (except on the one pose I needed a modification!). there are some seated stretches (ahh!) then the more vigorous standing ones. one called cow's head there is absolutely no way I can do the legs like they do..they bend the knees with feet on the floor and then pull on under with heel near the hip an the other on top with the heel near the hip...maybe I just have too much fat in the way! anyways, I felt nice after doing this workout...he talks a lot with the instructions but no needless chit chat. this was also filmed indoors, not outdoors like their tv series20 minute dvds. I really like this one and will do it when I have an hour or so to spend on yoga.",1090713600,8,902,4.101694915254237
1059472,4,6305661685,"A friend of mine started Yoga classes about a year ago and has suggested I try it. I thought it was for women and hippies so I resisted and besides I didn't have time for the classes. So my friend suggested I try a DVD and recommended Flexibility and Tone. Well I guess he got his revenge. I no longer think Yoga is for women and wimps. The workout looks fairly easy on first viewing but when performed it is quite strenuous. Maybe I am stiffer than I thought. Anyways I stuck to it and although I would not recommend this as a Yoga instruction for beginners, I would recommend it to people who are somewhat athletic but who wish to increase their flexibility. The instructor provides a good steady pace and the female assistants will certainly help keep the attention of the male viewers (especially the brunette - worth the price alone). It is my first Yoga video so I don't have much to compare with but I thought it was very well done and I plan to continue with my Yoga and probably purchase more DVDs.",1082246400,5,1007,4.361702127659575
1059473,5,6305661685,"I'd been doing yoga for a year and a half when I decided to switch to Pilates.  Previously I did a steady routine using the Yoga Zone home videos in combination with a local weekly yoga class and, though I saw results (legs were stronger, I was much more flexible and my arms looked great), I was impatient and wanted those long, lean muscles NOW.  So, for two months I put away my yoga tapes and worked on those muscles and soon realized exactly what yoga had done for my emotional well-being.  Without yoga I became irritable, headachy and slightly overwhelmed by my busy life.  So, last week out came my trusty old friend ""Yoga Zone: Flexibility & Tone"".  This review is a love letter to my all-time favorite yoga tape (and I've tried quite a few).
Everything about the video, the spartan studio, the low-key music, the slightly pudgy, sweet faced, pleasant voiced instructor Alan Finger, his two beautiful silent assistants, is soothing to me. Not to imply that this tape is a snooze-fest!  In fact, it's quite strenuous as my aching muscles can attest after returning to this tape after my two month hiatus.  When I finish this routine my mind and body feel refreshed and de-stressed and I always feel like I've done something incredibly good for myself.
The instructor and his assistants lead you through a (roughly) 50 minute routine that stretches and strengthens nearly every muscle in your body using seated stretches, downward dog, cat pose, sun salutations, proud warrior and many other challenging (but not overly difficult) poses.  The tape ends with ""corpse pose"", where I must admit, I usually fall asleep because I'm so relaxed at that point.  However, I don't think beginners should start out with this tape without first trying one of the Yoga Zone videos made specifically for the beginner.  This tape sometimes flows rather quickly from one pose to the next and it may be confusing and possibly slightly discouraging for the new yoga student especially when you're in a sideways (or upside down) pose and can't get a gander at the tv.  But once you've mastered the basics it is very easy to keep up with the instructor's voice cues.
While you may not see overly drastic physical results with this video the emotional results and the flexibility you'll attain can't be beat!  I highly recommend my beloved video!",1039132800,62,2332,4.788029925187033

1059475,4,6305661685,"Could be my preferences, but this isn't the best of the YZ tapes I own. It seems to flow less well, the poses aren't held long enough, and though the instruction from Alan Finger is great (as always), I just always feel like I want more after doing it. I want to do sun salutations more than twice, for instance. For strength, the Power Yoga for Strength and Endurance is much better. For relaxation, Conditioning and Stress Release leaves this one in the dust. I'm a high-level beginner in yoga, and I only do this one occasionally, and only for the poses that aren't included in my more-favored tapes (cow's head, seated spinal twist).",1010448000,17,637,4.5964912280701755
1059476,1,6305661685,"This yoga was very boring to do.  I returned the vedio because the instructions are slow and boring.  The instructor's voice was irratating and his's instructions not clear. I kept the  Flexibility tape that the ""Yoga Zone"" has because it is an ok stretching tape, although I have a better one, but for a change of pace it's ok.  I would not recommend buying it though.  A much better and uplifting and fun yoga tape I brought is called ""Fat Burning Yoga Crunch workout"".  Now the instructress, Sara Ivanhoe, a certified yoga instructor is great.  Very pleasant and clear on her instructions and she does it with you.  It is a great yoga tape for beginners and intermediate students.  Try it.",1009065600,,692,4.652892561983471

I own a lot of yoga tapes and this is is one of my favorites. Alan Finger is a great instructor. He is very detailed with the postures and reminds you throughout the practice to breathe correctly. It covers the fundamental yoga poses and breathing techniques. I have noticed increased flexibility esp. in my hips and back since starting this tape. Some may complain it's a little slow once you've done it a few times but I find it a great reference tape and am never bored with it. It's a great supplement to Power Yoga.
