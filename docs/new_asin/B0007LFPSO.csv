8048138,5,B0007LFPSO,Benji Brown is a very funny comedian and this dvd showcases his talent to the fullest. It is worth its purchase price indeed. I'm sure that anyone who's seen this video is wondering when his next one is coming out.,1284768000,,214,4.375
8048139,5,B0007LFPSO,"i saw benji brown in touch with reality on bootleg copy. My auntie had it from the bootleg man, anyway i thought it was so good and so funny i knew i had to get me an original copy. It took me like 2years to get it but i found it on amazon and Im very satisfied with my selection. Also the coolest thing about it is that i ordered it while in korea and sent it home to my wife. she recieved it in less then 4days... thats wussup.",1279584000,,429,3.7777777777777777

In Touch With Reality is filled with stand up, skits and Benji's own take on talk shows and reality dating shows. There is alot of Ke-Ke which is my favorite charater.",1214092800,,243,4.304347826086956
