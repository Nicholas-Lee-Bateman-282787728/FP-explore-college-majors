201807,3,1578482224,"Pretty pedestrian really. You learn that a professional dominatrix is just another person, often just another employee. Nothing empowering in the job. Plenty of tedium.

And the maker of the documentary was unwilling to participate in very light BDSM play making himself seem fairly impotent and weak.  It was made he wouldn't be harmed in any way.

If you are familiar with Femdom or BDSM you will find no revelations here. Should this be a new area to you then it might be a surprising catalog of desires that some men have.

While there are no `better' DVDs to have someone wishing to explore would be better off investigating the Claudia Varrin and Greenery Press books that Amazon sells than this movie.",1115596800,3,708,4.778688524590164
201808,4,1578482224,"The lovely Ms Kathleen reviewed ""Fetishes"" in the March edition of the e-zine ""Predominant"". Here is a little from her review:

""In my opinion, Nick Broomfield stayed as impartial as one could when approaching this subject matter and his eventual acceptance of what he had witnessed is not unlike what many of us have experienced in our own journey into the world D&S.  Shock gives way to curiosity, curiosity stirs genuine inquiry, inquiry leads to knowledge and knowledge leads to understanding (and ultimately acceptance).""

After reading her review, I purchased this DVD and was not disappointed. Thank you Nick Broomfield for having the courage to make this documentary. I only wish you had agreed to be dominated by the lovely Mistress Raven.",1110844800,5,748,5.114754098360656
201809,5,1578482224,"A British male documentarian does a work on Pandora's Box, an SM service in NYC.  Like many African Americans, I find the idea of whipping and ""owning slaves"" highly problematic.  However, to each his or her own.  This film does show powerful women in sexy leather and shapely corsets giving much attitude and representing.  This film will put you in a mood to swish your hips and yell, ""Do what you're told!""  Still, the main dominatrix was bothered by the filmmaker's refusal to try bondage and I don't blame her.  He does come off as a pest and a snoop.  I especially hated the way he had to drag opinions out of interviewees' mouths.  Though this movie is mostly about male submissives and female dominatrices, the first images are of same-sex, female, SM scenes.  I think this was designed to attract the heterosexual male viewer who enjoys lesboeroticism and thinks of it as exotic.  Still, it's somewhat misrepresentative.  There is one dominatrix of color and though you see her in a race-laced scene, she is never interviewed.  I bet she would have been a fascinating subject and I wonder if the filmmaker was being Eurocentric by excluding her.  This film is not a history of SM; it focuses solely on one club.  I was also worried that this British documentary was meant to act as just another project to make Americans look crazy.  However, one dominatrix speaks with a thick, natural French accent and one submissive is English-born.  I am glad that some submissives spoke openly to the camera because folk should be proud of what they  do sexually as long as it's adult and consensual.  I don't think I'd try this, but I will admit that this was a sexy documentary.  I have to give credit where it is due.",1079740800,26,1718,4.647840531561462
201810,5,1578482224,"Not a great movie to show folks what the average person into BDSM does or has but a good doctumentary on one particular pro dom house in NYC.  The director/cameraman is clearly not particularly comfortable with SM but he tries to show the variety of kinks that both customers and pros offer. There are many fetishes and role playing scenarios that are looked at ranging from basics of clothing to the very intense use of needles or the very humiliating use of human ashtrays.  It may not be for the newbie to watch without a good guide to question some questions.  My only real disappointment was at the end when the pros chase him around breaking the basic guidelines of SM today: safe, sane and consensual.",1031011200,6,708,4.603174603174603
201811,5,1578482224,"When I bought this tape, I thought it would be about fetishes that people have, like feet but I found out that this is a particular fetish...the  fetish of Bondage & Discipline.  I thought that this documentary on  dungeon play was very exciting and all the Mistresses who were interviewed  were different as far as personality and style.  If S&M makes you  squimish, then you might not want to purchase this tape, but if you want to  see a little bit about what goes on when a man or woman goes to a  Dominatrix, then this tape is for you.  Some of the scenes might be a  little shocking, but it's worth every penny.  I've seen this tape 4 times  already and still not tired of it.",965347200,7,682,4.283464566929134
201812,4,1578482224,"VERY interesting documentary about the goings-ons at an establishment in New York (Pandora's Box) that cater's to mostly male clients into bondage, rubber, infantilism, etc.  The movie is very similar in style and subject  to ""Chicken Ranch"", a documentary about a legal brothel in Nevada  (also, a good documentary).
The film is quite shocking/disturbing (i.e.,  the male human ashtray), although no sexual acts are allowed in this  totally legal establishment.  Nudity is minimal (and, of course, most male  genetalia is blurred out), but that doesn't matter because the most  interesting parts of the movie are the interviews with the employees and  clients in the film, many of which agreed to be interviewed without  concealing their identities.
Overall, a fascinating document of  sexuality's dark side.",947462400,9,809,5.443548387096774
201813,5,1578482224,"Nick Bloomfield who did the great Heidi Fleiss documentary, takes you to ""Pandora's,"" an S&M studio in New York.  It shows the viewer that it ""takes all kinds"", who get into this alternative  lifesyle:  Grandfathers, record/magazine producers, librarians etc; and the  dominatrixes aren't as sadistic as one might imagine. It also goes into the  different types of fetishes, that may seem really bizarre: infantilism (men  who want to be babies), amazon wrestling, shoe fetish, human ashtrays, and  one man who likes to lick toilets instead of acting out on his genocidal  urges. This film is really informative, and entertaining.",926899200,3,630,5.292929292929293
7800442,5,1578482224,"Good introduction to limited aspects of BDSM and fetishes for neophytes, although focused on only FemDom (the domination of people of any gender expression by females*), and does not fully delve into explaining all the fetishes that are shown.

For example, the man who dresses up as a maid and performs household chores, and the ""stinky sneakers fetish"" phone call man: while their behavior is documented, their mindsets are not explained. That disappointed me, but the thing that disappointed me most about the documentary is that there is not an exploration of the Male Dominant dynamic. I mention this because femdom feels completely different to me than being dominated by a male.

Femdom is, from a certain perspective, a counterculture of a counterculture, in that, traditionally in most societies, females are submissive to males.

In fact, at more than one dungeon I know, There are specific nights set aside as FemDom only nights, and other are set apart as Male dominant/ Female submissive-only dynamics.

The client who struck me the most was the man who occupies a very powerful position in business and was wearing a gas mask with a small tube to restrict his breathing. He described the way that he first got into it as having been buried alive, by his friends on purpose during a childhood game, smothered point that he feared he would die.

Several other reviewers have expressed scorn for various persons in the documentary; after reading all the reviews, I don't think anybody was left out.

I do admit that I am not into licking toilets either. However, ""Your kink is not my kink, and we are both okay.""

As of the time of this review, it has been about three years since I have watched the film, so my review may have some inaccuracies.

One of the reviewers here, who identifies as an African-American woman, indicated that she finds the concept of whipping (physical punishment) and slavery to be disturbing, and I can understand why she would say that. As a (white) person, I (too) find *nonconsensual* whipping, flogging, humiliation, and degradation, as well as *nonconsensual* slavery to be abhorrent.

(I am a practitioner of BDSM. I am a white woman who is the slave of an African-American male Master. I am sure that the terms used in the preceding sentence are shocking to many people.

However, I would describe our relationship simply as an intense form of the mentor/mentee relationship combined with romantic love.)

*In this review, I am going to use the word ""female"" to refer to people who self identify their gender expression as female, regardless of the genitalia with which they were born.

*Likewise, I am going to use the word mail to refer to anyone who self identifies and expresses gender as male, without regard to the genitalia with which they were born.",1509321600,,2817,4.892857142857143

7800444,3,1578482224,There was nothing erotic about this documentary for me.  I mostly felt squeamish and sorry for some of the people going to Pandora's Box to get their rocks off.  Nipple clamps?  Um no thanks but if that's your gig go for it.  Licking the sweat off a leather jacket?  Not really my thing for sure.  Licking a dirty toilet? Um no thanks and you should go get some penicillin stat.  Also why does everyone have an accent?  Is it a requirement for the job?,1445385600,,452,4.2976190476190474

7800446,5,1578482224,"As someone with personal knowledge of Pandora's & who opted out of being in it; I really think it was a pretty fair portrayal.
Almost all those girls moved on long ago also & Maria Beatty is doing fantastic at her filmmaking & living in Paris.
I thought the film had humor, which you rarely see w/ the subject matter.
I love that the women they chose to focus on came off as truly lovable, quirky, yet intelligent.
Hope they are doing great.",1440115200,,441,4.325301204819277

Kinda Documentary-ish with a lot of wining from the gals.  Certainly NO entertainment value, and as for insight to the scene, very shallow and superficial.  Highly disappointed.",1433116800,,186,5.607142857142857

7800449,2,1578482224,"Firstly, this movie was shot sometime around 1995-1996. The boom of the internet has probably made the audience for this a little jaded.

But who was the audience it was intended for? It seems that the filmmaker was aiming to make a movie for the most sheltered and ""scene clueless"" people on the planet, who probably wouldn't buy the movie or pay to see it in the first place. No one ""in the scene"" would find this material engaging, rather the opposite in my opinion.

Anyone who has explored their ""dark side"" for themselves will find nothing new here, and what is revealed is too vanilla to be titillating - again, I can't fathom the audience the film maker was speaking to.

The interesting story would have been the one about how a dominatrix got started in the business, made a good enough living at it to open her own House of Correction (my own term), how she found working with other dominant women and how that business faired in the long term. What we get is a motorcycle tour of the various strange drives the men interviewed (all but two of the subjects who agreed to speak on camera were men) need to decompress from their high-powered Manhattan jobs.

Well, one guy was a retiree from such a job, and one guy was from out-of-town, but he stormed out of his wrestling session due to a misunderstanding of what he had paid for. It would have been interesting to interview him and get a contrasting view of the mistake but all we saw was the blow up and the whining dominatrix bleating ""not my fault"".

The women try and get the film maker to undertake a session - which in my opinion would have given him some much-needed perspective and perhaps have made for a better product even if that session was off-camera - but he whined about not wanting to be slapped. He did not believe the dominatrices' claims that pain was not always involved, and neither do we because every single session filmed had that element in it. In one particular scene it was the whole point.

The viewer has to keep in mind that the film maker will only show you what he wants you to see at this point. I have no idea if the Dominatrices were being mendacious or that the demand for painful sessions was such that no other material was available. The film maker was out of his depth, firmly in the ""Oooh, isn't that nasty"" mode with nil connection to what he was doing. It is little wonder his work fails to engage this viewer.

From the boring, monotone introduction that has the viewer fearing the worst from the get-go, to the insight-free commentary of what we are watching, the movie staggers from one rather sad image to the next.

The fact of the matter is that no ""normal"" sexual behavior occurs in such a place because in New York that would get it closed down fast and - here's an insight that the film maker missed - there is no need to provide any since the punters will pay high prices for something else, something almost entirely internalized so why would the Dominatrices run the risk?

I found the posturing of the staff and the owner to be overblown at first, they were all trying too hard to shock. Later they stopped acting and became more interesting. Luckily the film maker avoided the trap of getting too involved with that and was able to continue the tedium unabated.

At the end of the film we get to meet a professional masochist and see her being caned. She is then interviewed, but the clueless and boring film maker cannot seem to connect with the woman enough to even make a description of her way of life remotely interesting.

Oh well.

The disc itself is a burn-on-demand DVD. This may give some players problems. Those that cannot play the disc should consider themselves to have had a lucky escape.

The DVD has no chapters so you can't even jump to whatever ""good bits"" you identify with from your own bag of kinks.

I'd save your money. There's nastier stuff on the web for those looking for titillation, and it is hard to believe there are worse attempts to explore the world of professional dominatrices than this bag of meh. HBO ran an episode of Real Sex that covered the subject better, in more depth and did it in less time for example.",1397520000,,4169,4.468421052631579
7800450,5,1578482224,"I like documentary movies broadening general knowledge, and this Nick Broomfield's work is really it in its area of fetish.

Perhaps, a final scene of practicing him some s&m is a sure remainder that with all broad tolerance to an issue, one is aware dominatrix are dangerous creatures anyway.

Highly recommended.",1219449600,,314,5.137254901960785

Fetishes provides interviews with the dominatrices and clients in and out of the dungeon and real sessions with plenty of real fetishes including slaves, S&M/Bondage, rubber, wrestling, infantilism and a few other's.
