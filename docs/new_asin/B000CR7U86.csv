8101012,5,B000CR7U86,"I am not a couch potato, but this is a great video to learn the basics of yoga at your own beginning pace. This is an excellent video for people that need to get into an exercise program but have some physical limitations, weather you are over weight, under weight, or have other physical disabilities - this video will take you step by step, learning at your own pace. This is also excellent for cancer survivors who need a program to help them balance and regenerate their body after chemotherapy. Highly recommended!",1406332800,,519,4.6521739130434785
8101013,5,B000CR7U86,"It makes me mad that more people don't know about this DVD.  I was pleasantly surprised in the diversity of the group of ""couch potatoes"" that Yogi Marlon mentored during this program. This is really valuable for large or plus size beginners interested in benefiting from yoga.  She addresses:  breathing, household chemicals, yoga terminology, and adapting yoga postures to the individual.  Her manner is gentle yet firm.  When there is background music, it is soothing and low.  I AM SO VERY, VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE!",1195776000,9,527,5.069767441860465
8101014,5,B000CR7U86,"I've been happily practicing with Yogi Marlon for a couple of years with ""Yoga For Absolute Beginners"" and ""Yoga For Getting Well"". I bought and opened up Yogi Marlon's new ""Couch Potato"" DVD to make sure what I was about to pass on would not be too difficult for my aunt, whose obesity is fast becoming a serious health risk for her. My aunt is so sensitive about her weight and I thought she might get upset if I gave her something she could not do. I'm really amazed at how fun and light-hearted this DVD is, all while patiently teaching unique yoga moves that even my aunt actually looks forward to doing. Her confidence is building and she's starting to make some changes in lifestyle that are explained in a separate ""Healthy Living Tips"" section. It is refreshing to see how Yogi Marlon treats the large people on this DVD with such respect, in world that is all too often dismissive of obese people.

This DVD is a really good value. There's 9 chapters on it so I can skip around and just do the parts I want to do that day.  I like that way Yogi Marlon taught just one exercise and one other technique to each ""Big Beauty, as she calls them, then strung them all together in the next chapter.  That gave me a chance to learn one thing at a time before I needed to try and get through a whole practice. I can't do everything yet, but at least now I have a sense of hope. Two thumbs up for Yoga For Couch Potatoes!",1184716800,5,1421,4.2555555555555555

8101016,4,B000CR7U86,Yogi Marlon continues her quest to spread the word of Yoga in a way that urges you off the couch and on to the floor.  After just one week notice the little things that change for you... I noticed it's easier to reach the higher closet shelf and my balance is better.  And I can twist my upper body further to look behind me when backing up in my car!  Thanks Yogi Marlon.,1145059200,8,372,4.068493150684931
8101017,5,B000CR7U86,"I have viewed other DVD's from Yogi Marlon's collection, and consider myself a step or two above novice in the world of Yoga,and by no means a ""couch potatoe"" but I'm glad to see she's created one for the ""less fit"" amongst us. This proves anyone can do it.

 I love Yogi Marlon's insights into fitness and healthy living.

You can do it! Tell a friend.",1143590400,6,353,4.318181818181818
8101018,5,B000CR7U86,"I'm not a couch potato but I had never done yoga before and was pretty intimidated by the classes I'd see while at the gym. This DVD introduced yoga to me in a way that was easy and non-threatening but not watered down like most intros. It is real yoga and Yogi Marlon obviously knows her stuff.

The segments on nutrition were also excellent and an unexpected bonus. Following her suggestions on eating and drinking have probably helped me just as much as the exercises!

And I loved that she worked with real people. Their stories were great!",1143504000,7,544,4.540816326530612
