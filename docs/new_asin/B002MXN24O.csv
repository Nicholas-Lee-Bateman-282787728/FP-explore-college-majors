3952899,5,B002MXN24O,I went on a bus trip to Gettysburg and Lancaster PA and found Much interest in the trip. This 11 Hour series which I purchased from Amazon.com is one of the Best Documentary Productions I've ever seen. Thank You Amazon. I'm Very Well Pleased.,1309824000,11,242,4.5227272727272725
3952900,5,B002MXN24O,"I thoroughly enjoyed the narration, the expert commentaries, and the computer graphics (which give a clear view of the battlefield and dispositions). It provides a good overall understanding of the battle---would be good to watch before visiting Gettysburg. I would also recommend ""Greatest Battles of the Civil War"", which is a similar production.",1306454400,5,348,5.584905660377358
3952901,5,B002MXN24O,"What a great find!  This wonderful series will please both those new to the subject of Gettysburg, as well as those who have an advanced knowledge already.  Interesting and engaging segments about civilians Jenny Wade and Tillie Pierce, and those engaged in the battles Joshua Chamberlain, John Buford, and Robert E. Lee.  Another disc covers the three days of battles on July 1st-3rd.  Historians Round Table is an added nice touch too. Whether you are planning on visiting Gettysburg, have already been there, or just interested in knowing more about what has been noted as the turning point of the American Civil War, this series will not disappoint.  Great production at a good price.",1298160000,13,688,5.0
3952902,5,B002MXN24O,"This DVD is an excellent source of information on the Battle of Gettysburg, everything from who participated and some in-depth backgrounds of some of the commanders who fought there.

Told by historians, park guides, and re-created scenes gives you an eerie insight on the men and women who were there on those 3 fateful days at Gettysburg. The DVD is of high quality, and about the only flaw in the series that I could see was maybe the repeating of certain information. However, if you take the discs in perspective ... many scenes at the battle were told by different people. Each gives their version of the regiments, commanders, etc. who fought there.

I was very impressed and would highly recommend anyone as a Civil War buff to add this to their library.",1296604800,5,762,4.7218045112781954
3952903,5,B002MXN24O,"For an upcoming Boy Scout trip to Gettysburg, I wanted my 11-year-old son to have a slightly better understanding of the battle so that he would have a greater appreciation for the site. Hence our purchase of this DVD.

Disc #3, of this three disk set, covers the battle, itself, and is a thoroughly engrossing documentary of the battle with, what appears to me, very little editorialization or over-dramatization.  None the less, it still manages to entertain young and old alike.  As such, it fits the bill, so to speak, for what I was looking for -- a documentary that entertains and silently educates.

I'll update further after our trip; but for now, 5 stars.",1289260800,18,664,4.747826086956522
3952904,5,B002MXN24O,"Thought I had every worthwhile Civil War video and bought this on a whim.
GOOD DECISION!

This production really gives you a more defined view of the battle of Gettysburg.
The round table discussion has only one flaw; its too short. I could listen to these great Civil War historians talk for hours.

I just wish there were a lot more videos of this quality.

To the producers... Great Work guys!",1288396800,26,396,4.549295774647887
3952905,5,B002MXN24O,I am a lifelong student of the Civil War and have visited Gettysburg battlefield numerous times in order to get a full understanding of what could be described as one of the three most significant battles of that conflict. While a widely known subject it is also one of the most confusing and least understood battles until recent research and writings have shed more light on the subject. Whether you are an newbie or a hardcore buff this is the work well worth watching. I highly recommend this work for any and all.,1285027200,47,518,4.580645161290323
3952906,5,B002MXN24O,"This series is very well done and is a great value for the price.  Each segment includes interviews, pictures and some well done reenactments.  The segments tell about some of the lesser known people and moments at Gettysburg, and include programs on Jennie Wade, Joshua Chamberlain, Tillie Pierce, John Buford, and many others who engaged in the battle from both sides.  The last disc includes a full segment on each of the three days.  Highly recommended!",1271894400,124,457,4.973684210526316
3952907,5,B002MXN24O,"Outstanding coverage of the battle of Gettysburg, from various commanders (North & South), civilians & heroes, as well as a day-by-day analysis of each of the 3 days of the battle.

3952930,5,B002MXN24O,"I have seen a lot of Civil War documentaries on various battles. Reading the military history of the Civil War is difficult because the mind has to juggle so many factors at once. These factors include a grasp of military rank and file, geography, troop movement, and names of personnel. Gettysburg: The Unknown Civil War leads the uninitiated viewer into understanding without bogging down in these complexities. Where troop movement needs attention, maps are provided in a form that lends basic understanding. The generals and their personalities are very aptly described. An excellent understanding is provided in showing the overview of Lee's campaign strategy tracing troop movements via maps as both armies move north out of Virginia. The panel of historians are outstanding as they speak in a tone as if sitting in your living room. This is one of the best documentaries I have seen on this complex and multifaceted battle. If you are new or uninitiated to the Civil War this set is not a bad place to begin. If you are already a student of the war you will appreciate the layout and general way the battle is presented. These three DVDs are very much worth the investment of money and time.",1421366400,,1198,4.848780487804878

The effort bring into human relief the heroes and actions on both sides that explain the devotion of both those on the Southern side and those on the Union side who faced off here. It is a broad expanse of coverage that attempts to convey the sense of horror of the war as well as the bravery of those who fought.

Each day of the battle has its own episode, and there are segments on the officers in both armies, the commanders, and the civilians who were present during the battle.

It's entertaining, and the narrative moves fairly briskly between commentary, reenactment, animated maps, and voice-over battlefield views. Nothing controversial here, the stories stick to the ""mainstream"" history of the battle. It's a good addition to your library, especially for schools.",1385510400,3,573,5.438202247191011

I wish more people knew what others had gone through and sacrificed to provide them the liberties and freedoms they are so casually throwing away today.",1351382400,4,484,4.511363636363637
3952959,5,B002MXN24O,"A couple of episodes were, I thought, not as relevant as the others, but they were still informative.  What did a nice young lady who was a resident of the little college town go through during the battle?  You'll find out here.

Gettysburg is the most famous battle of the Civil War for a number of reasons.  One is that it lends itself to a narrative structure that is comforting and familiar.  It begins with free-floating anxiety, becomes tense, leads to violence, and there is a denouement.

(1)  Lee tries to invade the North, hoping to take Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and threaten Philadelphia and Washington, figuring that all the fighting in Virginia has made the land barren of forage and caused the South enough suffering.  His army encounters a Northern force while approaching Gettysburg in a ""search for shoes.""

(2)  Day One.  Lee chases the Union forces through Gettysburg and they must hole up on Cemetery Ridge.  A victory for the South.  Tragic death:  Reynolds.  Unacknowledged bungler:  Stuart.

(3)  Day Two.  Lee assault both flanks of the Union line and is repulsed.  Everyone is back where he started.  A tie.  Hero: Chamberlain.

(4)  Day Three.  Lee launches an heroic attack on the center of the Union line.  The attackers are demolished.  Lee, defeated, packs up his men preparatoy to trundling painfully off to Virginia again.  A Union victory.  Human interest:  Armistad and Hancock.  Hero:  Pickett.

(5)  Day Four.  Both the Confederate and Union Armies are exhausted.  General Mead, commanding the Northern force, fails to pursue Lee with enough vigor and Lincoln fires him.  Properly ambiguous.  Politically correct.

You can find the battle covered in the companion series -- Unknown Battles of the Civil War -- although I don't know that any of them are so ""unknown.""  But you won't see the battle of Gettysburg covered in nearly so much detail, including some fascinating biographies of the leaders of both sides.

It's a marvelous collection and the transfer to DVD is crisp and colorful, and the narration is on point and candid.  There are some apt quotes from both sides, a few talking heads, and just enough reenactments.  You'll get more about the battle per se from this series than you will from Turner's epic ""Gettysburg,"" although both are fine films.",1350604800,4,2298,4.952506596306069

3952961,5,B002MXN24O,"Although it had been sitting on my wish list for a while I finally gave in after seeing a seller offering it for a good price. If you think that it's suspicious that it has so many good reviews you needn't worry. Everyone is pretty much on the mark.
 This program series offers a lot of information and education concerning the greatest, costliest and most fascinating battle fought on the North American continent. Unlike many other reviewers I hadn't seen this on television before so I wasn't familiar with it. I guess I didn't know what I was missing. Episodes cover some of the important leaders and the decisions they made, the civilians caught up in the battle and a day by day coverage of the battle itself. Using narration, photographs, reenactments and written excerpts from the participants themselves as well as input from some modern historians makes this series both interesting and entertaining.
 I saw very few mistakes (Barksdale was lost near the Round tops...huh?). The most annoying feature I found was the atrocious subtitling. Granted most people don't use it but in the few instances where I did it was quite obvious whoever did it has no background in this subject. There were so many misspellings of places and names that I luckily still had the audio on. If anyone has to use this feature I hope they are somewhat familiar with the battle to enjoy this series despite this minor flaw. All in all this is a great item to add to your collection and you won't be disappointed.",1348358400,4,1499,4.717557251908397

If you thought you had exhausted the subject, look at these videos and think again. They are actually better than the videos from the same series --and those were very good indeed-- on the eight major Civil War battles (which also include a Gettysburg segment). The Dutch writer Huizinga memorably said that nothing substitutes for the pure taste of history. The Unknown Civil War videos make that statement spring to life on the Gettysburg battlefield.",1325203200,3,624,4.89622641509434

The individual programs in the series (see other reviews) examine individuals, days, and events of the Gettysburg battle in a clear and easily understood fashion. A blending of historian interviews with reenactments make the series informative, without overwhelming the viewer with statistics, making them especially appealing to the ""casual"" historian.

After some time, I ordered the movie 'Gettysburg' which my husband and I enjoy very much.",1486166400,,265,4.541666666666667

8374155,5,B002MXN24O,"I recently purchased the ""Battlefield"" WWII series and admired its in-depth analysis of various battles, and thought I'd love to see this done for the American Civil War. This isn't quite it, but it's close enough to satisfy me. This 3-disk set covers each of the 3 days of battle, as well as some of the people, both military and civilian who fought or were affected by this huge and complex battle. I've studied the Civil War for decades and was aware of Jenny Wade, the only civilian death, and of Tillie Pierce, a Gettysburg resident whose writings have been featured on several books and disks about Gettysburg, including Ken Burns' honored series, but I never knew anything about her or of her amazing (and horrifying) experiences.
My wife, who isn't exactly a history buff, was mesmerized with this series as we marathoned the entire series.

Including closed captioning, my only beef with the disks is that it doesn't have a play all feature, which isn't much of a beef for an 11+ hours series. I highly recommend it.",1478304000,3,1025,4.726256983240224
