8567857,5,B00BFZCVCE,"I just finished watching this production of Pellas at Mlisande and couldn't wait to get on Amazon to write this review.  Robert Wilson (frequent Phillip Glass collaborator and designer for the now iconic ""Einstein on the Beach"") achieves maximum effect with minimal materials in this high-concept, high-style production.  With only a few colours, almost no props or sets, a few highly stylised motions and hand gestures, and a few striking geometric elements Wilson manages to create one strikingly memorable tableau after another, keeping you visually mesmerized for the full length of the opera.  Simple yet striking visual elements highlight the symbolist elements Maeterlinck's rich libretto: the circle of the well in the first scene becomes the sun in a later scene and the wedding ring Mlisande looses still later. I should also mention that the costumes are equally amazing.  It's simply one of the most visually stylised and striking productions of this or any other opera I have ever seen.

Not to lag behind the visual elements in any way is the fantastic performance with each singer extremely well-suited to their role in both vocal quality/characteristics and temperament.  Elena Tsallagova as Mlisande is a stand out.  She has the perfect Mlisande voice, delicate enough to sound young and waif-ish, big enough to sound like it belongs in an opera.  The role of Pellas can be difficult to cast because, although a tenor, the role calls for a fair bit of singing in the lower range of the voice type, almost baritone-ish in some passages.  Stephane Dagout as Pellas has both good solid low notes that sound effortlessly produced and ringing high notes.  The other case members are equally as superb, some really remarkable singing.  My only criticism of the performance might be that the opening of the opera, the ""forrest music"" seemed a bit slow and heavy for my taste.  Others may justly disagree.

Pellas at Mlisande has long been one of my favourite operas.  This production brought the visual elements to the same stylish and stylised heights that the score has always occupied.  It's a real treat.",1392681600,5,2118,5.045977011494253
8567858,2,B00BFZCVCE,"I purchased this disc last June (2013) at the Opra Bastille shop. What you get here is a 2012 revival of a show originally mounted in 1997. You also get vintage Wilson: clever usage of video taking place of dcors, minimal stage movements and whatever stage movement there is is a stylised, ancient dance-like one, as a whole very appealing visually but rather cold, and in a work such as this, with so little action going on stage, it may be a dangerous game to bet on. And yet Wilson mostly gets away with it and succeeds, aided no doubt by the superior vocal and orchestral forces he had at his disposal, that follow their young and outstanding conductor with zeal, relishing what they are accomplishing.

But there is a significant drawback in this release and it is the sound. I want to believe there was a mastering problem undetected by a poor quality control procedure, for it appears as if the dics's soundtrack fails to decode properly: the sound is inexplicably constricted for a modern recording and it even distorts noticeably throughout the almost three hours the performance lasts in many of the instances the singers sing beyond mezzo forte. It also stubbornly stays compactly in the centre, as if it were a crude and claustrophobic mono recording dating from 60 or more years ago, with practically no spatial image nor depth; if you have your player wired through a high quality music system, as I have, matters will only become ever more noticeable. I wrote an email to Nave reporting the problem and asking for their feedback; the email remains without reply from them, which might suggest they are perfectly aware of it and prefer to keep mum, who knows.

But it seriously mars an otherwise very enjoyable, beautifully played, sung and expertly conducted rendition of one of this  Debussyian true masterpiece that really deserved better.

At the Opra Bastille shop they had only DVD copies, and didn't know whether Nave had released it (or would release it) in Blu-ray format. Who knows, perhaps the problem affects a particular production batch of which the disc I bought belongs to, and they correct it in future batches or the Blu-ray release brings along a better mastered soundtrack for otherwise it would be an unforgivable flop and lack of seriousness from Nave, who by the way have made a significant effort in the disc's graphics and packaging.

So I'd say that you stay put for now until more news come along and we learn whether Nave fix this very serious drawback or if indeed the problem is beyond repair.",1374105600,11,2537,4.769931662870159
