1386915,5,B000051S4R,"My favorite film in the ""Apocalypse"" series, ""Revelation"" combines great action and suspense with a powerful message that makes it an instant classic. Even some of the big critics from Entertainment Weekly and the National Post loved this film. The DVD is good too, with a production featurette, theatrical trailers, the movie's theme song, and a great digital transfer for the film. Buy it! As I always say, I think you'll love it!

1386916,5,B000051S4R,"The events take place after ""Apocalypse"" which is after the Rapture.  Helen Hannah is now part of an underground Christian movement trying to thwart the antichrist and tell people about the Bible.  The main focus of this movie is on a counter-terrorism expert, Theorold Stone, who is trying to understand the loss of his wife and child to the Rapture.
As a police officer, he has to have proof before he will believe what is happening.  This movie is about his search for truth.  In this movie, part of that search touches on alien intervention, whereas in the first movie of the series, the characters focused on visual proof.  Each movie in the series seems to take on a different theory.
Although many of the judgments are not covered, this movie has many taking the mark of the beast.  It is a departure from scripture, but it does not detract from the movie.  I would recommend watching this.",1023926400,3,897,4.639240506329114
1386917,3,B000051S4R,"I tend to be a bit harsh when reviewing videos--it has something to do with spending [money] for barely two hours time. Movies with religious content in the past have been predictably boring and second-rate but I am happy to see this trend changing and I actually watched this movie more than once thanks to Tony Nappo's performance--the computer [guy] in the wheelchair. The main character was a bit dull and some of the scenes were excruciating to watch (the antichrist's henchman is the worst culprit) but there is more here to recommend than to pan. The main thrust of the movie deals with the idea that the antichrist is going to force people to choose between following Jesus or buying into the lie that he can offer them their heart's desire (sight to a blind woman, mobility to a man confined to a wheelchair). Not bad overall but a few rought spots. -- Moza",1016755200,,866,4.593548387096774
1386918,4,B000051S4R,"I am a fan of ""End Times"" prophecy.  This movie contines the story begun with Apocalypse.
Cloud Ten Productions has really made improvements since Apocalypse in production quality.  You can still tell that this company doesn't have the deep pockets that the typical Hollywood film company has, but they do a good job with what they have.
If you like end-time stories, based on Biblical fact, you will enjoy this movie.  Hopefully this movie can re-enforce your faith, or help plant seeds for faith.",1013212800,2,498,4.904761904761905
1386919,3,B000051S4R,"The final book of the Christian New Testament is called the ""Book of Revelation"". It relates prophecies, which deal with the end of the world and the second coming of Jesus Christ.  Worthy true believers will be taken en mass in to heaven during a period called ""The Rapture"" after this time confusion and turmoil reigns for those left on Earth.  There will be false gods with false promises of peace and salvation.  Many people will be beguiled by Satan and lose their souls while others will discover the true God and suffer for their new found faith.
""Revelation"" continues in the tradition of the popular ""Left Behind"" series.  It is a science fiction/adventure movie that takes place in modern times showing how those prophecies could come to life.  The world has been thrown into chaos by the sudden disappearance of millions of people. For some this is a mysterious event for others it is the realization that the Christian way of life is the correct path to salvation.  However, most people have been seduced by an evil dictator who has set himself up as a messiah brining peace to the world.  Some people are in between; too cynical to believe totally in God or in the new leader.
Thorld Stone is one of the latter group. He desperately misses his wife and daughter, but he is not ready to embrace the new regime or the old religion.  At times he is considered an enemy by both groups. Eventually Stone goes on the run and, along with some other agnostics, ends up hiding out with a group of Christians who are attempting to crack the Dictator's latest scheme for total control of the world.  When those plans are discovered each person will face a choice that decides the fate of their soul and the world's existence.
This is a great idea for a movie, but I think that it comes off somewhat flat.  The acting was a little too glib at points and a little too hammy and melodramatic at others.  However the characters are painted so black and so white that it often seemed absurd that people could be so easily swayed. I thought that the best acting came from the charming relationship between Cindy and Willi.  They had a refreshing and tender series of exchanges showing how life goes in even in troubled times.  They were the only characters that I felt for and it made their tragedy even sadder than was written.
I thought that the script did a nice job of providing background for people unfamiliar with the book in the Bible.  While this movie would not intimidate people who are not up on the Bible, at this level of quality, I am not sure how much interest they would have in it either.",1011139200,21,2602,4.532051282051282
1386920,5,B000051S4R,"This film should appeal to non-Christians (if they watch it with an open mind) as well as Christians. It tells the story of a time in the not to distant future when the Antichrist reigns on the earth. Christians who refuse to worship him are brutally executed. The acting is excellent. The Antichrist's right-hand man, (played by David Roddis) is really menacing! The scenes of the abuse of Christians and the heroes desperate search for his wife and child, taken in the ""rapture"" are also harrowing. A previous reviewer showed his prejudice against Christians when he described their views as ""twisted"". Given the all too common hatred of the Christian faith it's not too farfetched to picture a day when mass persecution of believers (as depicted in the film) will be par for the course!",1006819200,3,789,4.851851851851852
1386921,3,B000051S4R,"This movie has a good cast in it; however, it was rather disappointing.  It was too much like every other movie about the apocalypse.  It was flat and did not project that certain charisma that makes you want to watch.  Don't waste your time buying or renting this movie.  If you want something of this genre, watch ""Left Behind"".  You will get your money's worth.",1006560000,,364,4.538461538461538
1386922,1,B000051S4R,"I am a great fan of the biblical/supernatural thriller, but quite frankly I found this film boring and tedious. The plot was poorly developed and some of the dialogue excruciatingly awful. Much better to read Revelations in the New Testament.
This genre has been done so much better, Polanski's 'The Ninth Gate' is a superb movie, edge of the seat stuff. I also enjoyed very much 'Stigmata' and 'End of Days'. I had really hoped 'Revelation' would be an excellent movie but it is now clear to see why it went straight to video. Such a wasted opportunity.",997228800,4,554,4.663265306122449
1386923,1,B000051S4R,"This is a horrible movie. The special effects are only special in that they are lousy. The acting is atrocious. The characters run around like puppets on a wire... at times I had the feeling I was seeing ""Thunderbirds"" all over again. The difference is though, that Thunderbirds had a much better plot most of the time.
For non-religious people (like me), the movie is good for a few laughs. It gives a good insight into the twisted view some religious groups have of reality. On the other hand, it is actually a sad to see how the makers of this ""movie"" ridiculize their own belief by presenting it in such a dumbed-down fashion. Sometimes I thought I was seeing ""Armageddon for Dummies"" ... 6-year old dummies that is. The makers of ""Revelation"" did nobody a favor, believers and non-believers alike.",996883200,5,802,4.695035460992908

1386936,3,B000051S4R,It is okay. I watched this with my family members. I personally found it hard to follow. But they enjoyed it. For me it probably has more to do with the fact that I tend to not be much interested in futuristic sci-fi type movies.

1386982,4,B000051S4R,What causes two people to see the same things and yet one person believes one thing while another believes something totally different. This film about the end times events has enough action and suspense to hold your attention. The acting is better than most films of this kind but you won't find any Marlon Brando or Elizabeth Taylor like performances. This film deals with the violent portions of the post rapture events and forces us to chose a side. Made by the producers of the Left Behind Series. This film also switches between one family's situation and the next very smoothly. This is strictly a dramatization of what could happen. 100 minutes,1408665600,2,652,4.830357142857143

1386989,1,B000051S4R,Strange story. Lost the thread of it. The subject matter is interesting but it is poorly executed which led myself to give up on the story and not finish watching this film.

1387005,3,B000051S4R,"I've wanted to review this film for years, but until recently, I wasn't sure how to word it. That having been said, I'm expecting some backlash due to some of my other reviews, but honestly, after all the fanaticism I've dealt with over the years, I don't care! I'll start with the acting-which overall, was fairly decent. Jeff Fahey was very good as a husband and father left behind after the rapture, but his reasons for not having faith aren't without merit, I've been through stages like that myself. Nick Mancuso, who I knew best from Under Siege, does an excellent job as the anti-christ, considering he's a Christian himself. His minion played by unknown actor David Roddis, is a little too creepy and merciless for my taste-beating someone to a pulp due to refusing to renounce their faith, not to mention saying ""God's Lost!) Doesn't sound like a good way of winning believers to me! The music was brilliant and the director did a good job as well. The script in this chapter, at least, to me, was the primary problem with the film. Here's why, this chapter felt like a scare tactic to me, either become a Christian or perish, but it's the way the message was portrayed here, it was too intense for new believers.",1373760000,,1222,4.610091743119266
1387006,1,B000051S4R,"Considering the bible tells us not to anticipate the judgement day as ""even the angels don't know"" it never ceases to amaze me how the spiritually phony will get all excited and worked up over end-of-days-plotlines.  Considering that folks who actually study the bible understand that revelations was written describing not our world today or in the future but the Roman Empire and the anti-christ who was Nero.  This is not a matter of debate.  Still, those who want to profit off this kind of vengeful-spiritual-porn are very successful businessmen if not entirely successful at their ""christian"" practices.  They are successful at writing popular misconceptions of revelations and apocalyptic themes which are fun but one must ask if you believe these films have value for ""opening"" the eyes of non believers it seems a bit like false advertising and not necessarily the proper way to bring sincere people into the fold.  Living in Jesus' way is much more simple than going to church and helping a pastor build his summer home.  Today's christians are actually not so into the reality of Jesus' message as they are into finding those passages which support their own personal narrative regardless of whether that narrative is actually christian.  So a fun movie maybe, but something useful for spiritual development?  Not so much.",1371772800,2,1333,5.08256880733945

This movie is indeed very exciting, however, it does not come across like an ""A"" rated film, hence, it was never sent for a full theatrical release. That aside the plot development is satisfactory, and the Virtual Reality element is quite interesting although a bit far fetched.

This is a Christian film so those of other believe systems may be offended by some of the themes presented, but the most significant message here is that not being fully committed to the Lord Jesus Christ will have its consequences in time to come. The real big question is, are you getting prepared for the Rapture, or will you be one of those with remorse and regret because of the hardness of the heart?",1291075200,2,1281,5.666666666666667

Fahey Face on its cover.  I was very surprised that Jeff Fahey would be
in a Christian movie.  I also have to wonder if the actors in these movies are affected by the truth they are exposed to?  Or is it just another ""acting"" job?

The average viewer who does not know the truth will not recognize that what this movie portrays COULD come to pass.  There is science out there that 99% of us are not aware of.  The rest of the story will come to pass, science or no science.

I do wish Christian movies could pack a better punch.  They might get a bigger audience.  Take ""The Passion"", for example.  It IS possible to portray truth as well as fill the seats.  As for The Passion, I wish Mel Gibson hadn't sullied his own work with his behavior, but that's another review.

Fahey seemed flat.  Probably because the story involved some of those same emotions he is unable to convincingly portray.  Actually, everyone seemed flat.  Can't we get a little quality and pizzazz in Christian movies?  The Christian life is NOT a dull one, why are the movies?",1233273600,3,1122,4.426470588235294

Jeff Fahey plays a distraught husband/father whose family was raptured, leaving him confused and sad, but still not believing in Jesus Christ.  The story is creative and interesting and moves quickly.  It shows the persecution post-rapture Christians must endure and provides an interesting theory on how the antichrist will convince people to take the mark, although it leaves out the part about needing the mark to be able to buy or sell.  Jack Van Impe and John Hagee appear in the movie and present the gospel.  I recommend this.",1232150400,3,703,4.8655462184873945

It is of much higher production value then the original and the acting has improved to that of what you would expect on T.V. It even has some special effects. It is close to B movie quality.

This movie starts up three months after 'Apocalypse' ends. Jeff Fahey plays a counter-terrorist expert looking for Christians, whom are called Haters in this series. He does not believe in God, but he also does not believe in the Anti-Christ. So we follow his journey as he decides what is transpiring and which side he will join. We also learn in this movie the writers vision on how the Anti-Christ plans to administer the Mark of the Beast onto his followers.

The movie actually takes us into the world of the Internet and virtual Reality, which adds a nice touch of science fiction to this thriller. This movie is actually fun to watch. Be advice that there is some violence in the movie.  Of course this is a message movie that is teaching its ministries interpretation of the Bible.",1190937600,,1106,4.492537313432836

1387031,5,B000051S4R,"Lots of drama & a really cool sci-fi/virtual reality angle with a dash of horror ... FX not up to Hollywood standards, but the story is pretty solid & most of the acting excellent. Best one in the series, IMO.

I really got sucked into this one early on & the sci-fi thing simply blew me away -- I wasn't expecting that from a Christian movie. Hugs, kisses & lots of pats on the back to whoever thought of it.

I've seen them all now & I think this one is by far the best in the series, (although it is interesting to me how each movie approaches the endtimes from a COMPLETELY different angle -- which is bad in terms of continuity & yet good in terms of entertainment, because you never know what you're going to get when you start watching one of these flicks; the story is always a surprise).",1166745600,3,796,4.196078431372549

I had the VCR tape already, and in a move to a DVD library, this was a must, and at an excellent price. This movie, as many recent Christian-produced movies, are finally showing the potential of A-rated quality movies. Christian film-making has had a lot of catching up to do, and this movie proves that this is not only happening, but the Lord is bringing His Word to the media in a way that will capture what He is after the most, not only by excellence in quality, but by His Spirit using that excellence.

As a computer programmer, I was fascinated by the way the Antichrist character used computer technology to sway people to his side.  If you think about how the world of technology has given us ""virtual reality"" as a first step toward their ultimate goal of creating a direct computer interface to the human mind, you soon realize this plot is very relevant to our times.  This is the only movie of this genre that I find compelling enough to feel comfortable recommending to a non-Christian friend.",1131926400,,659,4.559322033898305
1387034,4,B000051S4R,"Hi!

Just saw the movie and I liked it allot. The story is perfect and the actors where brilliant. The only bad thing to this movie is that it is very easy to see that it is a low budget project. But I did not expect to see a ""Lord of the Rings"" production so it is not anoing after all.

I can warmly recomend this film to everyone interested in the last days to come. If this movie can be used to evangelise or make people come to Jesus is another question. I look at this film as firstly christian entertainment and maybe a wake up call for lazyheads.

Good luck and God bless",1125100800,11,579,4.017391304347826
1387035,2,B000051S4R,"The end of time has often been the subject of movies, rarely are the movies any good.  Most of the time the Hollywood studio producing the film, along with the screenwriter and director, have very little knowledge regarding the end of time as recorded in the Book of Revelation.  There have been some attempts made to adapt this subject that haven't been altogether horrible, such as, ""The Omega Code"" and ""Megiddo: The Omega Code 2"".  Due to an unfulfilled need for an actual Christian approach to the subject matter, Paul and Peter Lalonde formed a production company known as Cloud Ten Pictures.  Cloud Ten Pictures in the beginning set out to produce Hollywood caliber movies that were Christian in nature, and apparently focused on the Book of Revelation.  However, desiring to produce movies on a level with Hollywood and succeeding in doing so are two totally different things.  The first attempt made by Cloud Ten Pictures was the pathetic and boring, not to mention stupid, ""Apocalypse"".  This movie was absolutely horrible as I stated in the review for that movie, but it apparently whet some Christian moviegoers' thirst enough to want to see more, so Cloud Ten Pictures obliged by making it into their first franchise.

""Apocalypse 2: Revelation"" follows an atheist (Jeff Fahey) who witnessed the rapture of all the Christians, without it really phasing him by the way, and just continues with his life.  That is until he comes into contact with some post-rapture Christians who are being hunted by the forces of the Antichrist.  When the atheist sees that Christians are being forced to either bow to the Antichrist or lose their head (literally), he chooses to help the Christian `rebels' as they were.  In the process he begins to understand God, but will he come to know God before it's too late.

It appears that Cloud Ten Pictures realized how terrible their first film ""Apocalypse"" was that they chose to essentially remake it with the sequel.  ""Apocalypse 2: Revelation"" is much better than ""Apocalypse"" in every aspect of filmmaking.  The script is better (still corny and wooden), there are better actors (though it appears Jeff Fahey and Carol Alt are on the downswing of their careers otherwise why do this film), and better directing.  However, all of these improvements still do not make for an entertaining movie that could hold a candle to even one of the Direct-to-DVD B-movies that Hollywood produces.

As I said it's an improvement, so at least Cloud Ten is trying to head in the right direction, but for a sequel in a franchise, this movie doesn't propel the overall story any further than the first film did.  Now I understand that this was pretty much a remake of the original film in the franchise, but I would have expected the story to go a little bit farther into the 7-10 year long Tribulation, instead of stopping where ""Apocalypse"" did.

I don't really recommend this movie, unless you happen to like ""Apocalypse"" or are at least wanting to see if they improved at all with the sequel, otherwise this franchise is a slap in the face to moviegoers both Christian and non-Christian and really should be avoided.  By avoiding this series, maybe the producers will realize that they should put more time and effort into making better movies and not just trying to flood the starved Christian movie market.

""Apocalypse 2: Revelation"" is rated PG-13 for violence.",1121990400,4,3399,4.878260869565217
1387036,5,B000051S4R,"THE PROS OF THIS FILM:

Once relegated to a class of grade B movies that preached predictible sermons, Christian films are growing up.

In a good film the audience cares about the characters.  In this film you do.

In good drama the audience isn't quite sure what will happen and sits on the edge of their seats until the end.  This film also passes that test.

In good religious films I like to see a message that is not too heavy handed, but appeals to reason with at least a touch of dimension.  This film does that.  Others might argue with me, but I think it carries a conservative Christian message in a thoughful way.

In good sci-fi the author creates a coherent world.  The authors do that with this film.

In the best sci-fi the world created is not exactly believable, but plausible enough to make the audience wonder if it could happen.  This film comes close to that point.

This film also delivers the added bonus of using Larry Norman's song, ""I Wish We'd All Been Ready"" to create a nostalgic link with the old ""Thief in the Night"" series that frightened hundreds of people into religious faith back in the 70's.

This film is a good ""sleeper"", much better than I expected.  I am glad I watched it and recommend it to anyone.

THE CONS OF THIS FILM:

Losely based on the biblical book of Revelation the story might be a little hard to follow for viewers who are not immersed in conservative Christian escatology.  The film shows video clips from popular ""end time"" preachers that might not be recognizable to those outside of the host culture.

The photography is a little dark.

It is a little claustrophobic, which works better on the small screen than on the big screen.

Unfortunately its Christian background could cause it to be prejudged by many, thus potentially limiting the size of its audience.",1101081600,4,1821,4.575851393188855
1387037,5,B000051S4R,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!  It was entertaining and thought provoking.,1087948800,2,76,5.909090909090909
1387038,5,B000051S4R,"This film will have you screaming at the screen from beginning to end. The events of the Bible after the rapture begin to unwravel as the Day Of Wonders draws closer and the Antichrist takes his seat in the temple of God. Helen Hannah and her christian crew are joined by athest Thorough Stone after he loses his wife and child in the rapture. Night and day their at work undercover trying to descover what the Day Of Wonders is all about. As the storyline continues Helen's athiest brother helps out by working to crack the codes that block the information about the Day of Wonders but as the codes begin to unwravel, Mancuso's (the devil)intentions become more than clear. Trapped in a virtually reality world with no one but Mancuso in sight, every man and woman that enters the Day of Wonders is tempted by Mancuso and his temporary gifts into recieving the mark of the beast on their right hand.
This film will leave you clinging to the edge of your seat as the shocking realism of the devil and his lies comes into a new focus on your very TV screen. By the end of the credits you'll find youself scared, a little wiser, worried and desperate for a sequel. See 'Tribulation' Part 3 in the Apocalypse trilogy.",1086307200,4,1214,4.497737556561086
1387039,5,B000051S4R,"Cloud Ten Pictures is pretty good at doing end times films. I'd say Revelation is probably better than Left Behind, but not as good as A Thief in the Night. I really think that if Cloud Ten Pictures wants to finish the Left Behind series, they should stick with it, but I really like this one along with Left Behind. It starts out a little slow in the beginning, but picks up right away about 1/3 of the way there. You'll enjoy it thoroughly, Christian, or non-Christian.

Thorold Stone (Jeff Fahey) is still wallowing in self-pity and denial after the sudden disappearance of his wife, daughter, and people all over the globe one seemingly normal afternoon. It is now three months after the occurance, and the world is in total chaos. The people still on the world trust in the new government organization called O.N.E. (one nation earth) but there is something strange with the leader, President Franco Macallusso, and his sadist henchman, Len Parker. An event called the Day of Wonders that people say will change the world has got people spellbound. With a simple virtual reality helmet, people can go anywhere, and do anything in their own homes, but Macallusso is planning to do more with this device, much more, and Thorold and a band of newfound christians, including newscaster Helen Hannah (Leigh Lewis from the first Apocalypse) are bound to find out.

I was so happy to see they carried the character of Helen Hannah into the next film in the series. Out of all the end times series, she's the one who is so impeccable in her characters actions, and Leigh Lewis's acting, I'm glad to know that there are two more in the series after this continuing with her. And of course there are new characters that are also very good actors and actresses.

This movie will surprise you considering the people you never though would turn to the antichrist do! If I was ever caught in the rapture (which I'm not) I would never take the mark of the beast even if they did try to cut my head off with the guillotine. Sure, it would be morbid, and spine chilling, but would you rather burn in hell or live forever with God in heaven?

I thought the movie itself was great for such an underrated film. The soundtrack was copied right off the Thief in the Night, but that's okay. I liked it with this movie too. People don't realize it, but this may be our future. It could happen at anytime. I'm ready for it, but the question is, are you?",1082764800,2,2433,4.5353075170842825
1387040,5,B000051S4R,"Revelation, being the second of 4 movies on the apocolypse by cloud ten pictures, tells the story of a cop (Thorold Stone - played by Jeff Fahey), who has recently lost his wife in the rapture and is trying to find out what the heck happened. His search leads him to Helen Hannah, (Leigh Lewis) and her collegues whom are all Christians or at least sympathetic to the cause and the battle against the anti-christ Franco Macalousso, (Nick Mancuso).
This film is very well done by cloud ten. The story is fast-paced and the charecters are well fleshed out. There is alot of witty dialougue in this one and the virtual reality side of the story is very interesting. Watching the anti-christ doing his deals for human souls is quite unsettling, and very realistically done. It's amazing what we humans are willing to trade for their own souls these days.
For a christian made film, Revelation stands way higher from bigger budget hollywood movies on the same subject, i.e. the dreadful ""end of days."" It also is one of the best christian movies I've seen.
Thanks for reading and enjoy the film.",1081728000,2,1090,4.682291666666667
1387041,4,B000051S4R,"""You've been left behind""...or so the little ditty that drones on in the background. Nope, it's not a typo, this movie has the EXACT SAME theme song as A Thief In the Night from 1972!
Revelation is the second in the Apocalypse series. The story centers around the rounding up, killing, and torture of the ""Haters"" by government and citizens faithful to ""the messiah"", who, of course we all know, is the Antichrist. Who are the ""Haters?"" Christians of course! Yes, those awful people that ""Hate"" gays, dancing, drinking and other varieties of sin. In this film we find that the Rapture has taken place and those left behind that turn to Christ must suffer the consequences. My favorite character was the little, maniacal, swishy gay guy in charge of rounding up and torturing the Christians. Girl, he never missed a beat!
Ah, but the ""Haters"" are well organized in little rebellious cells preaching the word everywhere! But their main job is to crack the computer codes that hold the key to the awesome ""Day of Wonders"" planned by the Antichrist. That, and watching old re-runs of Jack and Rexella Van Impe and John Hagee. I'm not joking. My guess, is that the Van Impe's and Hagee dumped some $$$ into the film, they wanted their faces on it, so the producers worked them into the story. Blargh.
Call me crazy, but I actually liked this film and thought the story moved along nicely and held some exciting moments. I give it WHEAT and recommend it.

1387042,4,B000051S4R,"One fault of many end times stories is that everyone--good, bad, and confused, is so earnest.  These characters are more realistic.  There is still time for some romantic flirtation.  Additionally, characters we come to like can make wrong choices--even deadly ones.
The protaganist is a police detective who recently lost his wife and children in a freek mass vanishing of millions of people.  He continues his work, but is tormented, torn and confused.  When the government targets ""Haters"" (aka Christians) for a series of domestic terrorism incidents, the detective is skeptical.
Two humorous characters are a blind sister of one of the hater leaders, and a wheelchair-bound computer geek.  Both are torn between a government line that seems promising, yet suspicious, and the Christian view, which is frightening, but compelling.
There is solid suspense here, and some provocative dialogue.  The story is talk-driven, and the acting is good for a film with such a low budget.
