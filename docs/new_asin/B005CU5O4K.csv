8465865,5,B005CU5O4K,"If you're a fan of American history, especially the Kennedy Administration, and like some dramatic influence in the form of a television miniseries, than this DVD series is for you. I really like Greg Kinnear(JFK), and Katie Holmes(Jackie Kennedy), as well as the character of RFK. It paints a realistic, yet dramatic picture of the back life of the Kennedy family behind the power and fame. Good entertainment for a Friday night or a weekend.",1403568000,,443,4.92
