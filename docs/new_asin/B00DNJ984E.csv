8595036,1,B00DNJ984E,A complete rip-off America's strong and money down the toilet,1490486400,,61,5.2
8595037,1,B00DNJ984E,It was not formatted for United States....I reordered it twice with the same result.,1461628800,,84,5.071428571428571
8595038,1,B00DNJ984E,"This is a collection of other concert, possibly assembled by Amazon. Terrible quality. DON'T BUY IT.
If I had known that this was a steal from other sources, I would probably skip it.",1458345600,,183,4.575757575757576
8595039,5,B00DNJ984E,She had and continues to have a spellbinding effect on my ears and heart. What a singer!,1430438400,,88,4.235294117647059
8595040,3,B00DNJ984E,Not what I expected.  The songs are outakes gathered from wherever.  Back when she was totally unprofessional.,1427587200,2,110,5.411764705882353
8595041,1,B00DNJ984E,"This looks to be a bootleg DVD, not the actual.  Second part is not a later concert, but a poorly edited (out of sync) 1970 concert (maybe in Spain?) and looks like someone's home movie.  No ""Diamonds and Rust,"" nor decades later concert as the description states.  First part most likely is jumbled clips from the 1965 UK BBC concert, however hard to know as with no titles, no credits and poorly edited together.",1407283200,4,414,4.5675675675675675
8595042,4,B00DNJ984E,"Two-thirds of the DVD content is just a duplicate of what ""Freedom: Live in London"" has, which I bought from another seller just a few days earlier.  The price I paid for this DVD (more that twice the price I paid for ""Freedom""), therefore, is outrageously high since only a third of its content was actually usable to me.  I don't blame the seller for this since they were totally stranger to the other (Freedom)purchase.  In fact, I thank them for taking care of my order immediately.  I got it quickly and in great shape.

I wish Amazon lists all the songs in each CD/DVD they sell on their site to avoid things of this kind happening again.  I've got burned time and again because of lack of information needed to make a sensible decision before buying an item on their site.  The great majority of the CDs/DVDs on their site do not have the songs listed. It's like a gamble dealing with them on items not familiar to the customer. To return the item costs time and money.",1401321600,8,976,4.418994413407821
8595043,5,B00DNJ984E,"The DVD I received from a market seller is far better than the Amazon description.  It's nearly 2 hours long, with a pair of concerts, separated by about 4 decades.  Very different from a 48 minutes listing.  Screen aspect ratio listing of 1.33:1 isn't correct either for this DVD.  It played at greater than 1.85:1, letterboxed with black lines at the top and bottom.  No idea what caused such contradictions.

Great audio and video.  A must for everyone who appreciates Joan Baez.",1390348800,10,482,4.804878048780488
8595044,5,B00DNJ984E,"This DVD complements that DVD. Here she sings 30 of her best songs and her voice is still as impressive as it was when she first sang them. My favorites  are Copper Kettle, Mary Hamilton, Plaisir D'Amour, El Preso Numero Nueve, Diamonds & Rust, Gracias A La Vida, Suzanne (Leonard Cohen), Joe Hill and Imagine (John Lennon). I hope she keeps singing (she is an American Treasure).",1382745600,9,380,4.6716417910447765
