457720,1,6302313880,"The DVD cover artwork clearly says, ""Doris Day and Cinemascope never had it so good!"", and what do Warner Bros give us? A pan-and-scan version of the film, which means we lose exactly HALF (!!!) the film. (Cinemascope is 2.66:1, pan-and-scan is 1.33:1). Shame on you, Warners, shame!",1177545600,9,283,4.916666666666667
457721,4,6302313880,Doris Day stars as Phil Silvers partner in his Broadway show that is a flop called Parisian Pretties a long with 2 other people. Phil is a down and out person who is a looser and a free loader who depends on Doris for the rent and a lot of other things. Doris meets a famous screen wright while working at a HOTEL to pay off their big debt and when Phil finds out he tries to convince her to tell them about him and to try to get him to help them out and get them a chance in the big life. But Doris teaches Phil that the best way to get anywhere is to work for it! So they get into the play and turn from sad people to happy people and Doris finds love.,1083024000,4,654,3.781021897810219

457723,4,6302313880,"""Lucky Me"" was the next to last film under Doris Day's Warner Brothers contract. Although she has stated that she didn't believe in the project to the same extent that she'd believed in some of her prior films, you'd not know it while watching her performance.
While far from the best film made during her seven years on the Burbank lot, Miss Day is a delight.  In technicolor and wide screen (The first musical to be so filmed), she looks a treat. Her performance is filled with spunk, vitality, exuberance and that unmistakable ""Doris Day"" glow that never seems forced or contrived. From the first moment we see her bouncing down the street letting loose with ""The Superstition Song"", we are sold. There's not a false moment in her performance. Her comic skills are given a chance to delight us, even if the script might not be as fresh as we might like. Vocally, she runs the gamut from the lovely ""I Speak to the Stars"" to ""The Bluebells of Broadway"". She gives every song the full treatment, again dispelling any displeasure she might have personally felt about this picture.
The cast work well together. Bob Cummings gives the same kind of smooth performance he gave opposite another blonde star, Betty Grable, a decade or so earlier.  He seems ageless. Phil Silvers shows he can play more than Sgt. Bilko, and Nancy Walker, years before she started selling paper towels, reminds us of her musical-comedy roots. Eddie Foy, Jr., is amusing and Martha Hyer, who later married famed producer Hal Wallis and wrote (uncredited) the screenplay for the 1975 teaming of John Wayne and Katharine Hepburn, ""Rooster Cogburn"" is pretty window dressing.
The plot about a troupe of ""down on their luck"" performers, is not new.  Since the inception of talkies it has been done by virtually every performer - male and female. This version doesn't add a lot of new twists. However, the cast play their roles with such conviction, you find yourself smiling at their antics and tapping your feet to the catchy songs.
""Lucky Me"" didn't break box-office records when it was released but it deserves a better reputation than it has earned through the years. Thanks to Doris and company, the film is a lucky break for viewers!",1062979200,22,2209,4.777486910994765
457724,5,6302313880,I READ IN HER BIOGRAPHY SHE REALLY WASN'T UP FOR THIS FILM - IT IS A RATHER KOOKY FILM FOR HER BUT I JUST ENJOY ANYTHING SHE IS IN.  HER SINGING  IS MARVELOUS.  I JUST WISH WE HAD MORE.,967507200,5,185,3.6923076923076925
457725,4,6302313880,"LUCKY ME is one of the lesser musicals which Doris Day lent her talents to.  It was also one of the last films she made under her Warners contract.  The score reunited her with ""Calamity Jane"" tunesmiths Sammy Fain and Paul Francis Webster.

Day plays a young actress called Candy Williams, stuck in a second-string touring revue, 'Parisian Pretties'.  When the troupe is stranded in Miami after failing to pay a restaurant bill, Candy catches the attention of Broadway composer Dick Carson (Bob Cummings).  With the usual premise of mixed identities and comic hijinks, the story bubbles away to the delight of audiences.

The score includes several gems including ""The Superstition Song"" (a gangbusters opening number for Doris), ""High Hopes"", ""The Bluebells of Broadway"", and ""I Speak to the Stars"".  Day shares the screen with some of the most talented musical comedy vets (Nancy Walker, Phil Silvers and Eddie Foy Jr.).  A pure joy.

The new DVD includes the vintage short ""When the Talkies Were Young"", the Oscar-nominated cartoon ""Sandy Claws"", plus the requisite trailer.",960422400,24,1078,5.114285714285714
457726,4,6302313880,"Even though when Doris Day marched into Jack Warner's office to protest the script of ""Lucky Me"", little did she know that her fans would love this picture and cherish it for decades.
I can understand her  concern.  She had just come off the great success of ""Calamity  Jane"" which had been an Oscar winner and Day had had a tremendous hit  record with ""Secret Love"".
After being convinced that she  should do the picture, she decided to give her performance 110% even though  she was in ill health.  And, what a performance it is!  With able support  from Phil Silvers, Nancy Walker, Martha Hyer and Eddie Foy, Jr. and a  terrific co-star in Robert Cummings, she was delightful as ""Candy  Williams"" a stranded-in-Florida showgirl with dreams of Broadway  stardom.
Miss Day performed , or was involved in all of the musical  numbers in the film, most notably, ""Love You Dearly"",  ""Bluebells of Broadway"", ""I Speak to the Stars"" (a Day  record hit) and the showstopping, ""I Wanna Sing Like an  Angel"".
Phil Silvers was ""Sgt. Bilko"" and Nancy Walker was  ""Ida Morgenstern"" and Eddie Foy, Jr. was ""Hindsey"" from  ""Pajama Game"".  In short, they were playing their most famous  roles.
Doris Day's opening number was a true star performance.  Only she  could get away with singing her head off, bouncing down the Miama streets  singing ""The Supersitition Song"".  Truly great.
The film moves  along nicely and has no lags, thanks to the director, Jack Donahue, who  kept things bouncy.  The color is bright and the actors work well  together.
See this one and don't forget the popcorn.",958521600,32,1578,4.787313432835821
457727,5,6302313880,"Doris Day best effort, second only to Calamity Jane.  She really shines in this!  I could see this again and again.",952646400,4,115,4.428571428571429
457768,2,6302313880,"Doris Day did not want to make this film complaining that she was exhausted and that the script was weak.  She was forced to do it by her contract and, though she shows no sign of being anything less than the Doris we all love, the movie is one of the worst I have ever seen.  All the actors do the best they can but the script does nothing for them and the result is, in polite terms, a train wreck.  There are no really strong songs though Doris does her best with ""The Bluebells Of Broadway"" and ""I Sing To The Stars"".  This is one of the few musicals without a single song that you feel like humming or whistling.  This is one of those films you may sit through once but rarely more than that.",1368662400,2,697,4.0583941605839415
457769,4,6302313880,"If you can't take standard musical comedy fare, if you are turned off by schtick, if the name Doris Day means nothing to you, if the singing style of the big band day when DD was girl singer (as they were called, Sinatra was a boy singer) for Les Brown (after a stint with Harry Rapp's band, a regional one centered in Cincinnati), and if the songs of one of the most reliable of Broadway/Hollywood composers, Sammy Fain (Samuel E. Feinberg, 1902 - 1989)are blah to you, then, pass this one right by. The picture does what it was intended to do: for 90 or so minutes, it gives you nothing to think about, bright colors, swinging music and vocals, Doris Day-turning everything into gold dust, and assorted talented supporting players. Bob Cummings, was his customary not quite credible romantic interest, Bill Goodwin (who played well in the great 1946 hit, The Jolson Story), has a few minutes to add to his resume, while the very much Star trio of Phil Silvers, Nancy Walker and Eddie Foy, do the best they can with modest material, earning a pat on the back for making it modestly entertaining.
At any rate, I had fun with it, and really enjoyed watching the still youthful DD sing and be effervescent.
Not one of her best, by a long shot, but still sparkling.",1350950400,,1262,4.5394736842105265
457770,3,6302313880,"This is not a noteworthy musical. Indeed, it is saved only by the singing and dancing of Doris Day. Phil Silvers is on hand with his loud and zany humour. Robert Cummings is his suave sophisticated self. But the plot, such as it is, about a theatrical group stranded in Miami, is feeble and the only real entertainment here are the songs: 'Lucky me', and the 'Superstition song' which opens the film, the jolly comedy dance number 'Bluebells of Broadway',the lovely 'I speak to the stars', and several others, rather less memorable. They were composed by Sammy Fain (music) and Paul Francis Webster (lyrics). This is one for DD fans only.",1345507200,2,638,4.756756756756757
457771,3,6302313880,"Well, there's a reason ""Lucky Me"" is one of Doris' least-remembered pictures; it's a featherweight comedy that is pretty much instantly forgettable apart from the presence of Doris herself.  However, I do greatly enjoy her work, and despite the fact that this isn't one of her great films it's a pleasure seeing her here in her prime.

I suppose this is most notable simply because it was the very first musical to be released in Cinemascope. Also, for trivia-minded viewers, it features a bit of well-known set design, a curving staircase that was a standing set at the studio and which found its way into many Warners pictures of the period (most famously Auntie Mame).

The score for Lucky Me is pleasant enough but unfortunately also rather forgettable. The one exception is the very lovely ""I Speak to the Stars,"" which was a big hit at the time, and covered by a number of different singers. It's a beautiful song, no doubt.

I'll also make note of the first number in the picture--- it's not a classic, but the film opens with a fun little tune titled the ""Superstition Song,"" and it's fun to watch Doris energetically bounce all around the back lot while avoiding bad luck.",1341964800,,1181,4.690821256038648
457772,1,6302313880,"This film was out of date when it was made and released. Bad comedy, below average musical score, it falls totally flat. Doris Day as usual looks great, as does the 'red headed' under-rated Martha Hyer, but really it is just a nothing film.",1306195200,4,240,4.4772727272727275
457773,4,6302313880,"This is so classically fun Doris Day.  She's surrounded by some of the best performers in the business all doing what they do best, puttin' on a good show while Doris Day hits comic highs and lows finding romance.",1305072000,,213,4.461538461538462
457774,4,6302313880,"So, okay, this isn't the best Doris Day film ever. But Doris Day always had a certain quality about her, a sense of warmth and that girl-next-door cool, that I never felt my time was wasted whenever I sat down to watch her pictures. I liked LUCKY ME, even if the songs aren't classic stuff, the supporting cast not exactly top draw, even if the plot elements are beaten to death, and the humor... well, some of it is by Phil Silvers, reliably insufferable. And why do I like this movie? Two words: Doris Day. Her perkiness always was indomitable. And we all know about her singing.

LUCKY ME is another one of those back-stage musicals revolving around down-and-out stage performers trying to make it big in showbiz. Candy Williams (Day) is a talented but ridiculously superstitious singer eking out a living as part of a less than thriving musical troupe (their latest show is a skunker called ""Parisian Pretties"" - it draws in an audience of 13 people, which freaks Candy out). When a scheme to get out of paying for dinner backfires, the troupe gets stuck in Miami, forced to work off the bill as part of the restaurant's kitchen staff. But Candy's big break may just be around the corner when she catches the eye of a famous songwriter (Robert Cummings). But then cue all the usual misunderstandings and plot obstacles, starting with Candy's believing that the songwriter's name is actually ""Eddie Szczepanski,"" and that Eddie is an auto mechanic.

Word is that Doris Day only did this film because of her contractual obligations, and checking out the film's hackneyed material, one can see why Doris wasn't feeling this one. The always affable Robert Cummings, whom I normally like, isn't really given much to do as the leading man and I don't think he really clicks with Doris. Meanwhile, fellow vaudevillian-type sidekicks Eddie Foy, Jr. and Nancy Walker can't overcome Phil Silver's strident schtick. And yet, despite the film's second-rate vibe, Doris Day - with her trademark vitality and spunk and warmth - makes this one an entertaining watch. If she was faking it, she fooled the heck out of me. And while none of the songs quite became standards, her vocals are a treat on ""The Superstition Song,"" ""The Blue Bells of Broadway,"" and my favorite song here, ""I Wanna Sing Like An Angel, Dance Like The Devil."" There's just something neat about how Doris presents this song and how the lyrics start out just so: ""Now did you ever stop to think what happens to those freckle-faced Tom Sawyers? They grow up lawyers...""

The DVD's bonus stuff has the 20-minute nostalgia short ""When the Talkies Were Young,"" the Oscar-nominated Looney Tunes cartoon ""Sandy Claws"" (featuring Tweety Bird & Sylvester the Cat), and the theatrical trailer. Also, if you look fast you might even catch Angie Dickinson making her feature-film debut (she's a brunette at the big birthday bash). So, you see, there are some things about this 1954 musical comedy that make it more than just strictly for Doris Day completists. I say, 3.5 stars out of 5.",1267056000,2,3035,4.7992351816443595
457775,5,6302313880,"This is one of those lesser known Doris Day movies, but one that is exceptionally well put together with a stellar cast.  It is nicely shot and scripted and worth adding to your Doris Day or any comedy collection.  I miss films with the subtle innuendo rather than the ""in your face"" unrealistic and unbecoming ""potty humor"" in far too many films today.",1238112000,3,353,4.587301587301587
457776,5,6302313880,"ONE OF DORIS DAY'S BEST ROLES.  GOOD STORY, EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE FROM DORIS DAY, AS USUAL, GREAT ENTERTAINMENT FROM WARNER BROS.",1231632000,,129,5.45
457777,2,6302313880,"My wife and I are fans of Doris Day's and usually find that most of her movies are quality affairs. However, we found this movie to be a complete misfire and unworthy of Doris' talents. It seemed like a rush job in order to get the first cinemascope movie musical into release. The songwriting team that contributed a fine score for Calamity Jane for Doris came up empty in the inspiration department when they penned the tunes for Lucky Me.

The movie plays more like a circa early 1940's musical than a mid 1950's one, and is not nearly as sophisticated as other musicals of the period. All but a few jokes fall flat. The movie starts out quite well with a particularly cute, well-dressed and perky Doris singing the ""Superstition Song"" as she bops down the sidewalk of a beautiful city street in beautiful color while trying to avoid the things (sidewalk cracks, ladders, etc) that will cause bad luck, all the while creating disasters in her wake. But, after a promising start, it is downhill from there. As we neared the scene of the party near the end, the movie became like a train wreck. We were appalled by what we were seeing, but could not stop until we saw how it worked out.

It is a tribute to Doris, that, as bad as this film is, she remains delightful throughout and tries to sell every song and dance, no matter how banal. Phil Silvers got very few laughs out of me, Nancy Walker was wasted and Eddie Foy, Jr was mildly amusing. Understand that my wife and I mainly watch classic films, so we are not approaching this from a modern ""all old films are boring"" point of view.

We might never have seen this film if it had not been part of the otherwise excellent Doris day Collection vol. 2. I almost wonder if Warners' would have sold any copies had it not been included in the set. I would avoid this one, unless you are a Doris Day completist or want to see what an early cinemascope musical was like.",1216339200,4,1919,4.4

Doris is absolutely beautiful in this looking like how the American woman looked in the 1950s as shown in magazines with the hairstyle she has and the dresses she wears.  The movie opens beautifully with Doris singing ""The Superstition Song"" while trying to avoid walking over cracks on the sidewalk among other superstitions.  And her song, I Speak to the Stars, is a really good and memorable song that is sung brilliantly by her.  Her romantic lead, Robert Cummings, seems well-matched for her in the film.  When the slams the pastry in his face in one scene while at a restaurant, it is quite funny!  I do recommend this film for fans of her, with knowing that it's not her best but also not her worst.
