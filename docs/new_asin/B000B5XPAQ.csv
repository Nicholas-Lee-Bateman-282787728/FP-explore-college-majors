8081672,3,B000B5XPAQ,some good basics and a couple of key pointers.  A lot of info in the 1/2 hour video but could have been longer,1270684800,,110,3.782608695652174

8081674,2,B000B5XPAQ,"The cover implies you're going to get tips and secrets from Daniel Negraneau and Lee Watkinson.  We're talking about 10-15 second sound bites, folks!  There were also short clips from Chris Moneymaker and others...  Most of this is just Vince Van Patten reading from a script.  And sometimes he reads too quick (he seems to be reading from a teleprompter).

You'd be better off with the Caro book and videos.  However, the production quality is great, and if you don't have access to anything else, the information is decent.  That's why I rated this two stars instead of one.  I'm still ticked off by the false advertising, however.  If you have the Caro book or videos, this video will just tick you off too.",1164672000,4,710,4.661290322580645
