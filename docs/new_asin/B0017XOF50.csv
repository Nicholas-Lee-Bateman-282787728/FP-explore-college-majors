3176171,5,B0017XOF50,"It's a very funny movie. It's satire and it makes fun of everything. I think it will occasionally ""cross the line"" and ""go too far"" for some people though.

It's mainly a bunch of skits tied around a loose and central plot. A news station with an older and more respectable staff has been sold to a new company run by a younger generation that aim to make the news more fun and entertaining. The main news reporter is trying to maintain some level of respectability as his job and world fall apart around him.

If you like the old Saturday Night Live, SCTV, etc. you'll surely like this. I bought a copy because I'll be re-watching it.

Cheers!

If you like the Onion news website, this movie is for you. It's the website, in video. Dumb, fake news stories galore. Some sketches go on a bit long, but overall this movie is a riot.

3176204,1,B0017XOF50,"This film is a collection of short skits, in the tradition of 70s offerings like ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" and ""The Groove Tube.""  The skits dramatize the kind of serious nonsense the web site has become known for - a news crew ignores a burning house to cover an ""area man"" who has misplaced a pair of socks; a man who appears to be robbing a bank instead demands a job there; a blatantly provocative singer denies that her performance contains any sexual elements when in fact it would be considered too risqu for the Bada Bing lounge.  The problem is that the Onion's brand of humor - ironic, wry, and either minimization of the grand or elevation of the trivial, works in print - at least for some people - but transposed to live action, comes across as flat and tedious.  And that's not to say its antecedents were much better.  I enjoyed ""The Groove Tube"" when I was twelve, but seeing it a few years ago was struck by how empty and dated it was.  ""The Onion Movie"" won't even age that well.  I wouldn't even recommend it to someone committed to seeing every movie ever made, although they will probably watch it anyway.",1403395200,,1123,4.453658536585366
3176205,2,B0017XOF50,"the play quality, as usual with Amazon Cloud, was flawless. The movie, on the other hand, left a lot to be desired. I am a long time fan of both The Onion's print publications as well as their website and short video broadcast for many years and this movie was a disappointment. There were some classic Onion short skits tha were true to form and are good for a laught but the overarching plot about corporate greed and the absurd and incoherent grand finale left me disappointed. Also, the presence of Steven Segall and his inane ""movie"" adverts almost ruined the entire experience for me. I hope that if Onion decides to mke another movie (which I doubt will happen given the common response to this one) they stick with what they're good at.

For instance, a framed copy of an article by the Onion Staff has a headline stating in 76-type print ""Holt &*$@, Man Walks on Moon!"" From Dungeons and Dragons (perhaps my favorite being a gamer myself) to anti-smoking laws, the legal inequality between rape and murder in the justice system, hyper-sexed-up pop stars who instantly become teen icons, racial prejudice... there are lines drawn somewhere, but the makers of this film apparently never bothered to notice them.

This is not for the easily offended. And whatever you do, don't take it seriously.

Oh, and Steven Segal is the star. Can't say much more than that.",1308355200,2,758,4.868217054263566
3176247,3,B0017XOF50,"""The Onion Movie"" follows the footsteps of comedy shorts dating back to the 1974 ""The Groove Tube"".  The latter is quite dated and flat for current standards but the former is not much better.  Aside from about 3 shorts, ""The Onion Movie"" is actually a disaster because of its generally ponderous nature.  The duration of most of the shorts outlast their usefulness.  The ""Cockpuncher"" skit, for example, gets very old and repetitive but the movie's executives are apparently trying to give Steven Seagal his fair exposure...bad decision.  The result is the consistently dampened punchlines.

If you are wondering which movie of this genre can give you the most laughs, it falls in this order: ""Kentucky Fried Movie"", ""The Onion Movie"", and ""The Groove Tube"".  Make no mistake.  At least half of the ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" shorts are dated and fall flat but provided that you are old enough to understand some of the references in its parodies or you're pretty good with 70s trivia, you'll feel that your time was not completely wasted in vain.",1292630400,3,1044,4.925714285714286
3176248,1,B0017XOF50,"I first caught this movie in its cut, censored television viewing. I laughed so hard that tears came to my eyes. ""How did I miss this movie?"" I asked myself. ""This is great!"" So of course, I ordered the thing.

But to my shock, I discovered that the televised version is actually superior to the ""Raw and Uncut"" version. Not only was the televised version funnier, it appeared to be an entirely different movie! The scenes are arranged in different orders, some of the skits are longer, or the shots are different--all to the film's detriment.

Please don't get me wrong. Several of the skits are absolutely hilarious and made me laugh until my stomach ached. Just check out Proteus the Invincible, the racial stereotypes skit, and the skit where overcrowded prisons send prisoners to live with law-abiding American families. Much of what I love about the Onion--its irreverent humor, which lampoons everyone, regardless of belief, race, gender, what have you--remains on the mark.

The thing that ends up crippling this movie is the sex. It's everywhere, and it's not funny--it's solely offensive. Let me add that sex humor can most certainly work, and that the problem is that a scriptwriter mistook shocking material for humor. The only place where including it made sense to me was the ""Britney Spears"" gag, and that was overdone to the point of nausea.

By ""shocking,"" let me just give one example: there is a cartoon of a terrorist engaging in a variety of sexual acts with his 72 virgins, where very little is left to the imagination. This isn't humor. This is the equivalent of a child leaping up and screaming the ""F"" word in a crowded school bus. Said child's not doing it to be funny; he's doing it to show how very edgy and mature he is. But of course, we know this child is not edgy or mature, he's just disgusting and needs to be kicked. And the same is true of The Onion Movie. It takes no skill to be pointlessly crude. If I wanted this kind of humor I could read YouTube comments.

If this kind of humor were limited to one or two places, or were tamer, or were even shared in smaller doses, it would be tolerable. But it isn't any of these things. It appears often and randomly, sometimes in the middle of otherwise laugh-out-loud skits. For example, the cartoon I just mentioned occurs in the middle of an instructional video for terrorists. The skit itself is hilarious. The erotic cartoon ends up destroying it. How on earth can I watch this with my friends and family? I can't! And that's half the fun of humor--sharing it with someone else, starting in-jokes, and the like!

At the end of the movie, I felt disgusting. The parts of the movie that were worth watching were hopelessly entangled with the smutty parts. Now I greatly regret spending anything on this DVD. It is simply unwatchable.",1290988800,6,2816,4.644578313253012

It all builds and connects nicely at the end, even if it doesn't durring the movie itself. Its satire about news, music videos, and commercials. Because these are sketches / skits, its a mixed bag. Mostly involving either stereotypes, swerves or uncomfortable moments. Such as the r*pe mystery party or the handicap hockey player. Stereotypes like... well... use your imagination and typical Onion swerves like having a news story about a man's missing sock instead of the explosion outside.

3176250,1,B0017XOF50,"The Onion Movie was just terrible.  Skit after skit of utterly unfunny, unimpressive crap.  Don't waste your time and/or money.  I agree with a previous reviewer--it might appeal to the Date Movie-Scary Movie-Epic Movie-Meet The Spartans crowd; but for anyone with even a hint of taste for cinema, it's an absolute joke (and, as I've said, not a funny one).  I'll cite an example:

Pretty early on there is a preview for a faux action movie-within-a-movie called ""Cockpuncher"" (starring Steven Segal).  The fake preview begins with the main character getting punched in the crotch several times before cutting to a scene with an Asian martial arts trainer.  The main character asks, ""How did they defeat me?""

If you're unable to predict what happens next, well then maybe this IS a movie for you; and if you find this perhaps a little bit funny, like I do, try to imagine whether or not it would STILL be funny after the same pretend film is crammed down your throat for the full remaining length of the production.

Horrible acting, terrible comedic timing, hideous writing, atrociously racist, low-brow humor, and why-oh-why did they feel the need to wrap it all up by bringing all the sketches together in the end?!

As others have said: go to the website, read the books and articles, but do not watch, rent, buy, or even download or stream this movie.  Just watch the preview, that's pretty funny (and exhibits better editing than the actual film!).",1269820800,3,1455,4.826612903225806

In print and online, THE ONION is generally funnier.  And most of the more recent clips from the Onion News Network (ONN) that you can see on the website pack a harder satirical punch.  But then again, nothing punches quite as hard as Steven Seagal in ""Cockpuncher,"" the movie that the corporate bigwigs at Global Tetrahedron are repeatedly asking ONN anchor Norm Archer to promote on his nightly newscasts.  Norm is getting mad as hell about the situation, but will he get the chance to announce on-air that he's not going to take it any more?  The answer's not important, but that's as much suspense as the movie contains.  Most viewers will likely get a few laughs along the way (along with ""Cockpuncher,"" another recurring joke is based on the Britney-like character of Melissa Cherry, who claims that her innuendo-filled songs are really all about ""friendship"").  David Zucker was one of the producers, which is maybe why THE ONION MOVIE is more likely to appeal to fans of KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE than THE DAILY SHOW.

3176256,3,B0017XOF50,"A lot of people are familiar with The Onion News. The Onion News is a news service that parodies modern news right down to the Horoscopes. Spoofing modern news with spoof news filled with humor and scatological references, The Onion News has been offering a scathing satire on the modern news experience for years. In 2003, they opted to make a movie filled with the same satire of the modern world you'd find in the newspapers. Apparently, though, due to poor test screenings the movie was shelved and finally released on DVD in 2008 rather than theatrically. So how does it stack up?

The Onion Movie is mainly a group of skits, working as news stories, commercials, movie spots, etc. Behind the skits there's a working TV news report: The Onion News ""The World's Greatest News Source"". The Onion News has just been bought out by a global conglomerate who requires the news to plug their movies on the air. News anchor, Norm Archer, thinks this compromises the integrity of the news, and this leads to an interesting, and funny, confrontation at the end of the movie.

The Onion Movie is a really funny movie with a few unfortunate down spots. It does a fairly good job of mixing the politically incorrect (Little Known Racial Stereotypes, Terrorist Training Video, etc.), with satire of celebrities (Melissa Cherry, a Britney Spears knock off who sings songs like: ""Take Me From Behind,"" and lyrics like, ""So, let me give you some affection - just below your waist"" which are apparently just about friendship because she's a virgin), and satire of society (News report: ""The internet went down for three hours this morning, plunging the nation into productivity. The outage, which caused major work startages from New York to California, prevented an estimated 120 million American employees from messing around on the web at work""). Also, there are some funny cameos including a spoof commercial hosted by Michael Bolton for a children's charity organization, but the best is Steven Segal as the Cockpuncher.

While those skits work very well, and the majority of the rest do, some skits fall flat on their face. Skits like the Dean Martin Celebrity Roast spoof and the majority of a skit dealing with teenagers playing D&D are just not funny. Also the plot, while inherently harmless and flimsy, adds quite a few deadspots to the movie taking away from the fun of many of the skits.

The Onion Movie is definitely worth a watch though. While not as funny as I hoped it was funnier than I expected. Naturally, for those of you who know of The Onion, know to expect nudity and cursing, so this is not a movie to watch with your kids. Check it out, and hope you enjoy!

Still, the filmic version of ""America's finest news source"" proves that it is extremely hard to make a successful feature-length sketch comedy. David Zucker is credited as one of the producers of ""The Onion Movie,"" but the film somehow lacks the abundance of creativity of ""Airplane!""

This is not to say the comedy skits in ""The Onion Movie"" are all unfunny. Some jokes are funny (with hilariously wooden Steven Seagal and his self-parody as the star of one stupidly titled action movie). The loosely connected story about the anchorman Norm Archer (Len Cariou), who is not happy about the company's new policies, goes nowhere, and some jokes of the film (a Britney Spears parody, for instance) are dated, but they can be overlooked. The film was made in 2003 and subsequently shelved for five years.

But you know the film's delayed straight-to-DVD release is not a good sign and actually ""The Onion Movie"" does not work as a whole. The film tends to draw out the sketches, some of which are still underwritten. I know some jokes are meant to be rude and offensive, but some of them are just offensive, not very funny (like the ""who's the rapist"" game""). Maybe with someone like John Cleese these flat and unfunny skits could have been something different.

funny about what he's doing to America.

Sadly, there is not much funny about The Onion movie, either.
It goes off like a string of wet firecrackers (unlit); there
is no structure, there is much lameness.  It goes nowhere with ex-
crutiating slowness.  Films like The Groove Tube and Kentucky
Fried Movie, cheesy, frequently stupid and uneven as they
were, at least had some energy.  The Onion Movie is dead in
the water. It looks like the kind of inane and sodden mess that
its writers and ""director"" might make fifty years from now in
the Old Satirist's home when they hearken back to how funny they
were.

Whole sections are shockingly tired and trite:  a TV ad for a gay-
themed cruise line; a news report on an Alzheimer victims rally;
and others so pointless and dumb you might you wish you had
Alzheimer's to forget them.

Then there's the endless repetition of The Onion logo which makes
the sad enterprise seem like nothing more than shameless
commercial for the REAL Onion (or was that some species of
irony lost on this viewer?)

generis as all of its many and dreadful imitators have shown.

But somehow the same crew needed five years to get a loosely-strung collection of MadTV-style sketches to the big (make that small) screen. This movie actually has a bit of useful plot, as veteran news anchor Norm Archer (Len Cariou) tries to stand up to corporate tie-ins during his newscasts, forced on him by young integrity-deficient hucksters in the home office.

The state of the news business in the real world, exemplified by Norm's lonely struggle here, is a ripe source of social and political commentary, and it's already been done in major movie productions like ""The Insider."" Here, this little plotline does get some room to roam, though most of the movie is built on short sketch segments starring little-known actors (except Steven Seagal and Michael Bolton playing themselves and badly in need of real gigs). The sketches are mostly based on Onion headlines mentioned by Norm during his newscasts, and most are straight from old editions of the online newspaper.

Reviewers seem to be arguing about the merits of the humor found in this film's comedy sketches, with disagreement over whether the incisive political satire blends well with the concurrent lowest-common-denominator perversity and cheesy pop culture references. Well that's the Onion for you, and the arguments over smarts vs. smut sure won't be resolved here. So the way to judge this film is on whether Norm's plotline and the various sketches are FUNNY. Some are hilarious but some just aren't. Some drive tired gags into the ground and a few are in really poor taste even for the Onion (e.g. the Alzheimer's march).

The opening of ""The Onion Movie,"" leads viewers to believe that it's simply going to be a series of sketches strung together. But there is a plot of sorts. Longtime anchorman Norm Archer (played by Len Cariou) is forced to wage a lonely battle against the corporate sponsors who insist on plugging their products (with a cute electronic penguin), while he is trying to cover Important Issues. The young 'uns at the station find his position rather quaint, if not downright idiotic. Among the plugs is one for a Steven Seagal movie parody, featuring the actor himself. Meanwhile Archer covers more hard-hitting news stories such as the college student who attempts to mediate international peace talks with the help of weed; a Britney Spears-like diva who insists that her R-rated videos have nothing to do with sex; one man's doomed quest to buy the most up-to-date computer; and little known ethnic stereotypes.

Some of the sketches may make you cringe - there's one about a rape role playing game and one about Alzheimer's sufferers marching on Washington. I did like the one about the over-eager gamer who eventually gets transported to a fantasy world, and the athlete who overcomes both the loss of his legs and wrists to play professional ice hockey. Just don't expect nonstop laughs, but some parts are extremely clever. Again, I think it depends on your mood and tolerance for tastelessness.",1214697600,3,1588,4.85239852398524
3176289,4,B0017XOF50,"The Good Things
*A great, varied assortment of comedic sketches that makes fun of many different aspects of modern-day society, culture, and politics.  Topics include such issues as terrorism, sexuality in pop music, corporate greed, and so on.
*A few good parodies (most prominently, Steven Segal parodying himself!).
*Also a good number of original sketches.
*A few funny pieces of self-parody (ie, the scenes where film critics gather around and rate the movie).
*There is a very slight story arc that ties in many of the sktis together into a bizzare finale, and ultimately presents some major themes about journalistic ethics and corporate greed (although these themes are not very strongly developed).

The Bad Things
*No characters to develop, no story to tell (but hey, it's sketch comedy, so who cares?).

The Questionable Things
*A fair amount of perversity.  Expect a lot of swear words and a little bit of graphicness.  Some may find it too crude, but I think it's just right.
*Quite a bit of racey humor.

This eighty-minute collection of skits is probably the funniest thing I have seen in a while.  The comedy is great, and presents enough satire to make it somewhat thoughtful.  There is some sickness to some of it, but it's nowhere near as bad as some other comedies out there (like ""Meet the Spartans"" or the ""Scary Movie"" series).  It may not be as funny as the Onion website, but I would say that this is comparable to ""Saturday Night Live,"" ""Robot Chicken,"" or Monty Python's ""Meaning of Life.""

The disc has okay video and sound quality.  It has ten minutes of deleted scenes (which are really good) and outtakes.",1214697600,16,1636,4.848920863309353
3176290,2,B0017XOF50,"The Onion is a web site that took over, being at the right place at the right time offering the right quotient of humor and commentary about the world. So doesn't it make sense that it would broaden its interest and invade the world of film?

I love movies that offer glimpse into the world of TV and movies. Movies that spoof the whole gamut of trailers, ads, shows and features. Two of the best of these were THE GROOVE TUBE and KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE. They used a combination of each genre they spoofed to make it seem as if you were watching the real thing only in some distorted universe. THE ONION MOVIE tries to do the same thing.

Most of the film revolves around a news program hosted by the honorable anchorman Norm Archer (Len Cariou) who delivers all sorts of news items that make up a number of the onscreen jokes. News items like a recall on new safety harness equipment in cars that go around passenger's necks that instead decapitate the wearer upon impact. Yes, the humor here IS irreverent.

Mixed in with the news is a series of commercials and clips, most notable for the newest Steven Seagal movie coming out, C**KPUNCHER. If only I hadn't seen the previews for this movie it would have been so much funnier. Segal plays this trailer with a straight face, taking a humorous look at himself in the process. Congrats to him for the willingness to do so.

The second most prevalent story here involves an interview with teen pop sensation Melissa Cherry (Sarah McElligott) who keeps saying that there is nothing suggestive about any of her song lyrics or videos. This pretend innocence mimics that of pop stars like Britney Spears as Melissa's song ""Take Me From Behind"" that features a life sized stuffed teddy bear doing just that while she's on her hands and knees in bed proves she either has no clue what she's singing about or a plan to play innocent while doing the opposite.

A storyline that runs through the news behind the news is seen from beginning to end. Having been bought out by a conglomerate called Global Tetrahedron, product placements are all over the news broadcast. Penguins walking at lower screen level while world news is reported to blatant placements of company products get the best of our intrepid anchorman who complains without success.

One of the worst things about this film is its use of parts of the movie over and over and over again. The Seagal film and portions involving Melissa Cherry are seen from beginning to literally the end of the film. If you don't have enough original material to use why keep playing the same thing over and over to fill in time?

The film offers a few laughs, many of which are seen in the trailer you may have caught on other Fox releases. But for the most part it seems pretty lame. With the Onion as popular as it is, you would expect more from a movie that its name is attached to. I read somewhere that this movie was made several years back and that they had been trying to keep it from seeing the light of day. Someone must have needed a few bucks.",1214524800,2,3041,4.508166969147005

If you have ever seen Kentucky Fried movie this will seem like an updated companion piece. You really need to go into watching this movie with these things in mind. It's just a good ride. The movie isn't high-brow humour that's meant to be the best in the world but you'll get a chuckle out of it. I've been waiting for this for a while since I saw a preview on another DVD I rented.

This film cannot be anything further than that. Most bits typically run well after the novelty has worn off, such as the racist film gags or the pop star spots. The humor is well under the bar the weekly paper sets and attacks issues more commonly found on sketch comedy shows instead of a usual smarter, more biting social commentary. It was not only disappointing, but it was just a tremendously bad movie. It has train wreck appeal, but if you are an avid Onion reader, avoid this movie like the plague.",1213142400,5,681,4.544715447154472
3176294,1,B0017XOF50,"I bought this movie without researching it first, fully expecting it to live up to the high standard set by the printed edition of the Onion.  Boy, was I in for a disappointment.  The movie was tedious, repetitive, poorly written, and woodenly acted, and even with a short 80-minute run time, it felt like it had been padded out with filler.  Many of the sketches started off with a good setup, but then dragged on far too long and just sort of...petered out at the end, without delivering a good punchline.  The sketches were very predictable, and even many of the funnier lines were telegraphed so far in advance that I almost wanted to shout ""Get to it, already!"".

I'm a huge fan of the Onion newspaper and the Onion online, especially when I rushed out to rent this movie the first day it was available (good thing I didn't buy it). The trailer that has been circulating the internet for some time is hilarious, but captures the only good scenes from the entire feature. Most segments are long, redundant, and unfunny, and although they are tied together in the end, the movie is missing the charm that I have come to expect from the Onion's caliber of work. Overall, rent this DVD if you have to, but it's something that should remain on the shelves.",1212451200,22,717,4.4393939393939394
3176297,2,B0017XOF50,"You're better off just reading the paper

""The Onion Movie"", shelved for 5 years - and now I see for relatively good reason - is finally on DVD, and I for one was happy to hear it was finally going to be released.  I find the paper humorous enough in its topical satire and nonsequiter parodies.  I also think their film and music critics are as balanced, informative, to the point and well-written, if not better than, many major media critics.  The fake-news, culure-skewing paper has a rabid following, too large to be considered a cult following, but still specialized enough that the community of readers make up something of an insiders-joke.  It is equal parts SNL style sketch comedy, National Lampoon political satire and Zucker Bothers pop culture parody; and surely at least part of the blueprint when Comedy Central was building ""The Daily Show"".

Its fan base had reason to rejoice at the news that the creators of paper as fearless, biting and pointed as ""the Onion"" would turn their satire and dry-witted brand of comedy into a feature film.  After all, The Onion skewers crappy movies, lame comedies, and Hollywood horses*#t in general on a regular basis.  If any writers could rise above the mediocre in writing a script for a slapstick satire, surely it's these guys, right?

Well, not so fast.  ""The Onion Movie"" is basically a riff on the ZAZ Team films of the 80s.  It is constructed like their ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" as a series of skits, loosely hung together by a unifying thread.  That thread here is a news journalist who reads off Onion headlines, which give way to various skits.  Some are parody movie trailers, some are faux pop star interviews, some are twisted human interest pieces, commercial parodies and political/world news jabs.  The joke is that corporate sponsors and Hollywood gossip-obsessed viewing audiences are ruining the news.

This is a fairly decent jumping off point for a film of this type, but just like many of the skits and parodies within the film, the writers have come up with a decent thesis, but their execution is most often weak.  For instance, early on there is a bit about a bank robber holding up a bank not for money, but for a job.  That is a funny idea, and would even make for some decent satirical jabs at the economy, but the writers can only come up with predictable gags from there and the skit just limps to a ho-hum conclusion.  ""Cockpuncher"", the reoccurring Steven Seagal film trailer, is funny enough, but they don't really ""go for it"".  Its humor is pretty obvious and safe.  It seems there had to be more there with a title like that and the real Steven Seagal at your disposal.  There is a Britney Spears parody that falls victim to the same problem.  It's funny initially, but the writers just seem to have nowhere else to go with it.  It's funny enough as is (love the `teddy bear'), but not as funny as it could, or should, be.  None of this is any better than what you can catch on any given weekend on say SNL or any show of that nature, and there has been much sharper satire of similar themes on shows like ""South Park"" over the years.

And some of it is downright bad.  There are some long, unfunny skits that go nowhere; like the 'rape game' or the white kid who acts black and then is mistaken for a black criminal.  The joke in these skits are clear, but the execution of those jokes are poor and unfunny.  It's too obvious where they are going from the get go and it takes them forever to get there.  Some of the race stuff is particularly disappointing because it seems thrown in, rather than developed into actual satirical commentary.

All the gags and skits come full circle at the end in a sequence, that like the movie, is alternately funny, lame and disappointing (though a Rodney Dangerfield cameo is welcome, if only because he has been gone for a while now, its nice to see him in something new, filmed before he died).

I was expecting much more from this movie.  I suppose if I were 12 again and was hanging out with some friends and we just happened to catch this on late night TV some night, we'd think it was a pretty great find.  It has the absurdity of the ZAZ films like ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" (a film I did initially see as a kid late one night not knowing what the heck it was), but none of that film's inspired wit.  If they were aiming at kids, then I suppose this move is a success, but for the Onion's core audience, and with their probably-high expectations to deliver something along the lines of the paper in terms of quality writing and social commentary, this film is a big misfire.  Plus, it's just not that funny.

The next time the Onion's critics trash some drek like ""Meet the Spartans"" for being tired, uninspired and pointless, you know they have to feel a little dirty inside knowing this then is the film the paper they are writing such reviews in, begging for quality comedies from Hollywood, made as a testimate to what film comedy, apparently by their standards, should be.

""The Onion Movie"" isn't awful, its juts incredibly mediocre It falls so far short of even the most minimalist of expectations Onion fans may have had for it, that it seems all the worse.  I found it funny that it is suggested this film be purchased with ""Meet the Spartans,"" a film the Onion (rightly) hated.

The skits dramatize the kind of serious nonsense the web site has become known for - a news crew ignores a burning house to cover an ""area man"" who has misplaced a pair of socks; a man who appears to be robbing a bank instead demands a job there; a blatantly provocative singer denies that her performance contains any sexual elements when in fact it would be considered too risqu for the Bada Bing lounge.  The problem is that the Onion's brand of humor - ironic, wry, and either minimization of the grand or elevation of the trivial, works in print - at least for some people - but transposed to live action, comes across as flat and tedious.  And that's not to say its antecedents were much better.  I enjoyed ""The Groove Tube"" when I was twelve, but seeing it a few years ago was struck by how empty and dated it was.  ""The Onion Movie"" won't even age that well.

There were some classic Onion short skits tha were true to form and are good for a laught but the overarching plot about corporate greed and the absurd and incoherent grand finale left me disappointed. Also, the presence of Steven Segall and his inane ""movie"" adverts almost ruined the entire experience for me.

From Dungeons and Dragons (perhaps my favorite being a gamer myself) to anti-smoking laws, the legal inequality between rape and murder in the justice system, hyper-sexed-up pop stars who instantly become teen icons, racial prejudice... there are lines drawn somewhere, but the makers of this film apparently never bothered to notice them.

3410744,3,B0017XOF50,"""The Onion Movie"" follows the footsteps of comedy shorts dating back to the 1974 ""The Groove Tube"".  The latter is quite dated and flat for current standards but the former is not much better.  Aside from about 3 shorts, ""The Onion Movie"" is actually a disaster because of its generally ponderous nature.  The duration of most of the shorts outlast their usefulness.  The ""Cockpuncher"" skit, for example, gets very old and repetitive but the movie's executives are apparently trying to give Steven Seagal his fair exposure...bad decision.  The result is the consistently dampened punchlines.

If you are wondering which movie of this genre can give you the most laughs, it falls in this order: ""Kentucky Fried Movie"", ""The Onion Movie"", and ""The Groove Tube"".  Make no mistake.  At least half of the ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" shorts are dated and fall flat but provided that you are old enough to understand some of the references in its parodies or you're pretty good with 70s trivia, you'll feel that your time was not completely wasted in vain.",1292630400,3,1044,4.925714285714286
3410745,1,B0017XOF50,"I first caught this movie in its cut, censored television viewing. I laughed so hard that tears came to my eyes. ""How did I miss this movie?"" I asked myself. ""This is great!"" So of course, I ordered the thing.

But to my shock, I discovered that the televised version is actually superior to the ""Raw and Uncut"" version. Not only was the televised version funnier, it appeared to be an entirely different movie! The scenes are arranged in different orders, some of the skits are longer, or the shots are different--all to the film's detriment.

Please don't get me wrong. Several of the skits are absolutely hilarious and made me laugh until my stomach ached. Just check out Proteus the Invincible, the racial stereotypes skit, and the skit where overcrowded prisons send prisoners to live with law-abiding American families. Much of what I love about the Onion--its irreverent humor, which lampoons everyone, regardless of belief, race, gender, what have you--remains on the mark.

The thing that ends up crippling this movie is the sex. It's everywhere, and it's not funny--it's solely offensive. Let me add that sex humor can most certainly work, and that the problem is that a scriptwriter mistook shocking material for humor. The only place where including it made sense to me was the ""Britney Spears"" gag, and that was overdone to the point of nausea.

By ""shocking,"" let me just give one example: there is a cartoon of a terrorist engaging in a variety of sexual acts with his 72 virgins, where very little is left to the imagination. This isn't humor. This is the equivalent of a child leaping up and screaming the ""F"" word in a crowded school bus. Said child's not doing it to be funny; he's doing it to show how very edgy and mature he is. But of course, we know this child is not edgy or mature, he's just disgusting and needs to be kicked. And the same is true of The Onion Movie. It takes no skill to be pointlessly crude. If I wanted this kind of humor I could read YouTube comments.

If this kind of humor were limited to one or two places, or were tamer, or were even shared in smaller doses, it would be tolerable. But it isn't any of these things. It appears often and randomly, sometimes in the middle of otherwise laugh-out-loud skits. For example, the cartoon I just mentioned occurs in the middle of an instructional video for terrorists. The skit itself is hilarious. The erotic cartoon ends up destroying it. How on earth can I watch this with my friends and family? I can't! And that's half the fun of humor--sharing it with someone else, starting in-jokes, and the like!

At the end of the movie, I felt disgusting. The parts of the movie that were worth watching were hopelessly entangled with the smutty parts. Now I greatly regret spending anything on this DVD. It is simply unwatchable.",1290988800,6,2816,4.644578313253012

It all builds and connects nicely at the end, even if it doesn't durring the movie itself. Its satire about news, music videos, and commercials. Because these are sketches / skits, its a mixed bag. Mostly involving either stereotypes, swerves or uncomfortable moments. Such as the r*pe mystery party or the handicap hockey player. Stereotypes like... well... use your imagination and typical Onion swerves like having a news story about a man's missing sock instead of the explosion outside.

3410747,1,B0017XOF50,"The Onion Movie was just terrible.  Skit after skit of utterly unfunny, unimpressive crap.  Don't waste your time and/or money.  I agree with a previous reviewer--it might appeal to the Date Movie-Scary Movie-Epic Movie-Meet The Spartans crowd; but for anyone with even a hint of taste for cinema, it's an absolute joke (and, as I've said, not a funny one).  I'll cite an example:

Pretty early on there is a preview for a faux action movie-within-a-movie called ""Cockpuncher"" (starring Steven Segal).  The fake preview begins with the main character getting punched in the crotch several times before cutting to a scene with an Asian martial arts trainer.  The main character asks, ""How did they defeat me?""

If you're unable to predict what happens next, well then maybe this IS a movie for you; and if you find this perhaps a little bit funny, like I do, try to imagine whether or not it would STILL be funny after the same pretend film is crammed down your throat for the full remaining length of the production.

Horrible acting, terrible comedic timing, hideous writing, atrociously racist, low-brow humor, and why-oh-why did they feel the need to wrap it all up by bringing all the sketches together in the end?!

As others have said: go to the website, read the books and articles, but do not watch, rent, buy, or even download or stream this movie.  Just watch the preview, that's pretty funny (and exhibits better editing than the actual film!).",1269820800,3,1455,4.826612903225806

In print and online, THE ONION is generally funnier.  And most of the more recent clips from the Onion News Network (ONN) that you can see on the website pack a harder satirical punch.  But then again, nothing punches quite as hard as Steven Seagal in ""Cockpuncher,"" the movie that the corporate bigwigs at Global Tetrahedron are repeatedly asking ONN anchor Norm Archer to promote on his nightly newscasts.  Norm is getting mad as hell about the situation, but will he get the chance to announce on-air that he's not going to take it any more?  The answer's not important, but that's as much suspense as the movie contains.  Most viewers will likely get a few laughs along the way (along with ""Cockpuncher,"" another recurring joke is based on the Britney-like character of Melissa Cherry, who claims that her innuendo-filled songs are really all about ""friendship"").  David Zucker was one of the producers, which is maybe why THE ONION MOVIE is more likely to appeal to fans of KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE than THE DAILY SHOW.

3410753,3,B0017XOF50,"A lot of people are familiar with The Onion News. The Onion News is a news service that parodies modern news right down to the Horoscopes. Spoofing modern news with spoof news filled with humor and scatological references, The Onion News has been offering a scathing satire on the modern news experience for years. In 2003, they opted to make a movie filled with the same satire of the modern world you'd find in the newspapers. Apparently, though, due to poor test screenings the movie was shelved and finally released on DVD in 2008 rather than theatrically. So how does it stack up?

The Onion Movie is mainly a group of skits, working as news stories, commercials, movie spots, etc. Behind the skits there's a working TV news report: The Onion News ""The World's Greatest News Source"". The Onion News has just been bought out by a global conglomerate who requires the news to plug their movies on the air. News anchor, Norm Archer, thinks this compromises the integrity of the news, and this leads to an interesting, and funny, confrontation at the end of the movie.

The Onion Movie is a really funny movie with a few unfortunate down spots. It does a fairly good job of mixing the politically incorrect (Little Known Racial Stereotypes, Terrorist Training Video, etc.), with satire of celebrities (Melissa Cherry, a Britney Spears knock off who sings songs like: ""Take Me From Behind,"" and lyrics like, ""So, let me give you some affection - just below your waist"" which are apparently just about friendship because she's a virgin), and satire of society (News report: ""The internet went down for three hours this morning, plunging the nation into productivity. The outage, which caused major work startages from New York to California, prevented an estimated 120 million American employees from messing around on the web at work""). Also, there are some funny cameos including a spoof commercial hosted by Michael Bolton for a children's charity organization, but the best is Steven Segal as the Cockpuncher.

While those skits work very well, and the majority of the rest do, some skits fall flat on their face. Skits like the Dean Martin Celebrity Roast spoof and the majority of a skit dealing with teenagers playing D&D are just not funny. Also the plot, while inherently harmless and flimsy, adds quite a few deadspots to the movie taking away from the fun of many of the skits.

The Onion Movie is definitely worth a watch though. While not as funny as I hoped it was funnier than I expected. Naturally, for those of you who know of The Onion, know to expect nudity and cursing, so this is not a movie to watch with your kids. Check it out, and hope you enjoy!

3410756,3,B0017XOF50,"Obviously ""The Onion Movie"" is by far better than such incredibly unfunny parody films as ""Date Movie"" or ""Disaster Movie."" Still, the filmic version of ""America's finest news source"" proves that it is extremely hard to make a successful feature-length sketch comedy. David Zucker is credited as one of the producers of ""The Onion Movie,"" but the film somehow lacks the abundance of creativity of ""Airplane!""

This is not to say the comedy skits in ""The Onion Movie"" are all unfunny. Some jokes are funny (with hilariously wooden Steven Seagal and his self-parody as the star of one stupidly titled action movie). The loosely connected story about the anchorman Norm Archer (Len Cariou), who is not happy about the company's new policies, goes nowhere, and some jokes of the film (a Britney Spears parody, for instance) are dated, but they can be overlooked. The film was made in 2003 and subsequently shelved for five years.

But you know the film's delayed straight-to-DVD release is not a good sign and actually ""The Onion Movie"" does not work as a whole. The film tends to draw out the sketches, some of which are still underwritten. I know some jokes are meant to be rude and offensive, but some of them are just offensive, not very funny (like the ""who's the rapist"" game""). Maybe with someone like John Cleese these flat and unfunny skits could have been something different.

The movie contains a whole bunch of skits that loosely connect to the main story: an established Onion news anchor gets angry over the crass commercialism of the  parent company.

I will provide sample skits for your review: a Catholic Irish teenager thinks it's cool to act like a gangsta rapper and while hanging out with friends, he is arrested since a black man was identified as the perpetrator of a nearby crime; and Steven Seagal mocks himself as the star of a new movie entitled, C*ck Fighter (something along those lines) where he punches everyone in the sack.

I love The Onion, but this production was terrible.  Whereas Amazon Women on the Moon spawned Arsenio's famous line, ""Look, the b*tch don't live here, man!"", and The Kentucky Fried movie famously featured Henry Gibson telling us that ""Death took more lives in America last year than any other cause,"" there are no such memorable moments in this movie.  None.  Most of the setups were unfunny from the word go, and while other skits looked promising, they went on far, far too long.

3410764,1,B0017XOF50,"Despite the brain-dead liberalism of The Onion writers
and editors, I've thoroughly enjoyed the satire that they
have produced over the years.

I can only suppose that The O hasn't done more with (and to)
Obama because (a) they share an initial or (b) there is nothing
funny about what he's doing to America.

Sadly, there is not much funny about The Onion movie, either.
It goes off like a string of wet firecrackers (unlit); there
is no structure, there is much lameness.  It goes nowhere with ex-
crutiating slowness.  Films like The Groove Tube and Kentucky
Fried Movie, cheesy, frequently stupid and uneven as they
were, at least had some energy.  The Onion Movie is dead in
the water. It looks like the kind of inane and sodden mess that
its writers and ""director"" might make fifty years from now in
the Old Satirist's home when they hearken back to how funny they
were.

Whole sections are shockingly tired and trite:  a TV ad for a gay-
themed cruise line; a news report on an Alzheimer victims rally;
and others so pointless and dumb you might you wish you had
Alzheimer's to forget them.

Then there's the endless repetition of The Onion logo which makes
the sad enterprise seem like nothing more than shameless
commercial for the REAL Onion (or was that some species of
irony lost on this viewer?)

The movie never should have been made. The Onion itself is sui
generis as all of its many and dreadful imitators have shown.

But The Onion editors like to preen themselves on how much smarter
they are than everyone else. (To which claim the best answer
is a familiar two-word oath).

to be to make a movie this thoroughly rotten?",1243555200,4,1702,4.602649006622516

The attempts to parody American culture and the news industry completely backfire, coming off as a childish imitation of biting satire (isn't that what all the cool kids are doing?

Not even fans of the Onion should watch this movie; to the contrary, if you're used to the usually high quality of the articles and internet videos then you will find ""The Onion Movie"" to be one of the most painful viewing experiences of your entire life.

Firstly, the movie doesn't seem to know what it is. It begins in the form of an evening news broadcast, but soon evolves into a series of unrelated sketches. The two formats transition between one another laboriously and pointlessly. Every joke fizzles. Every punchline is either entirely without comedic merit or so poorly delivered that it falls painfully and awkwardly flat.

The Onion works best when it parodies the news media. If they had gone all in with the news-broadcast-parody theme, they could have had something.

Some of the segments were very funny. I thought Sarah McElligott was quite vibrant as Melissa Cherry, a Britney Spears clone. The skit about the ""reformed"" bank robber was great. Steven Seagal's martial arts spoof had its moments. But many of the routines fell flat, and some were so tasteless that they were actually...tasteless.

3410781,3,B0017XOF50,"Week after week after week, the writers at the Onion are able to unleash voluminous quantities of sharp political satire and biting social commentary in their online and print newspaper. But somehow the same crew needed five years to get a loosely-strung collection of MadTV-style sketches to the big (make that small) screen. This movie actually has a bit of useful plot, as veteran news anchor Norm Archer (Len Cariou) tries to stand up to corporate tie-ins during his newscasts, forced on him by young integrity-deficient hucksters in the home office.

The state of the news business in the real world, exemplified by Norm's lonely struggle here, is a ripe source of social and political commentary, and it's already been done in major movie productions like ""The Insider."" Here, this little plotline does get some room to roam, though most of the movie is built on short sketch segments starring little-known actors (except Steven Seagal and Michael Bolton playing themselves and badly in need of real gigs). The sketches are mostly based on Onion headlines mentioned by Norm during his newscasts, and most are straight from old editions of the online newspaper.

Reviewers seem to be arguing about the merits of the humor found in this film's comedy sketches, with disagreement over whether the incisive political satire blends well with the concurrent lowest-common-denominator perversity and cheesy pop culture references. Well that's the Onion for you, and the arguments over smarts vs. smut sure won't be resolved here. So the way to judge this film is on whether Norm's plotline and the various sketches are FUNNY. Some are hilarious but some just aren't. Some drive tired gags into the ground and a few are in really poor taste even for the Onion (e.g. the Alzheimer's march).

The opening of ""The Onion Movie,"" leads viewers to believe that it's simply going to be a series of sketches strung together. But there is a plot of sorts. Longtime anchorman Norm Archer (played by Len Cariou) is forced to wage a lonely battle against the corporate sponsors who insist on plugging their products (with a cute electronic penguin), while he is trying to cover Important Issues. The young 'uns at the station find his position rather quaint, if not downright idiotic. Among the plugs is one for a Steven Seagal movie parody, featuring the actor himself. Meanwhile Archer covers more hard-hitting news stories such as the college student who attempts to mediate international peace talks with the help of weed; a Britney Spears-like diva who insists that her R-rated videos have nothing to do with sex; one man's doomed quest to buy the most up-to-date computer; and little known ethnic stereotypes.

Some of the sketches may make you cringe - there's one about a rape role playing game and one about Alzheimer's sufferers marching on Washington. I did like the one about the over-eager gamer who eventually gets transported to a fantasy world, and the athlete who overcomes both the loss of his legs and wrists to play professional ice hockey.

*A great, varied assortment of comedic sketches that makes fun of many different aspects of modern-day society, culture, and politics.  Topics include such issues as terrorism, sexuality in pop music, corporate greed, and so on.
*A few good parodies (most prominently, Steven Segal parodying himself!).
*Also a good number of original sketches.
*A few funny pieces of self-parody (ie, the scenes where film critics gather around and rate the movie).
*There is a very slight story arc that ties in many of the sktis together into a bizzare finale, and ultimately presents some major themes about journalistic ethics and corporate greed (although these themes are not very strongly developed).

The Bad Things
*No characters to develop, no story to tell (but hey, it's sketch comedy, so who cares?).

The Questionable Things
*A fair amount of perversity.  Expect a lot of swear words and a little bit of graphicness.  Some may find it too crude, but I think it's just right.
*Quite a bit of racey humor.

This eighty-minute collection of skits is probably the funniest thing I have seen in a while.  The comedy is great, and presents enough satire to make it somewhat thoughtful.  There is some sickness to some of it, but it's nowhere near as bad as some other comedies out there (like ""Meet the Spartans"" or the ""Scary Movie"" series).  It may not be as funny as the Onion website, but I would say that this is comparable to ""Saturday Night Live,"" ""Robot Chicken,"" or Monty Python's ""Meaning of Life.""

I love movies that offer glimpse into the world of TV and movies. Movies that spoof the whole gamut of trailers, ads, shows and features. Two of the best of these were THE GROOVE TUBE and KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE. They used a combination of each genre they spoofed to make it seem as if you were watching the real thing only in some distorted universe. THE ONION MOVIE tries to do the same thing.

Most of the film revolves around a news program hosted by the honorable anchorman Norm Archer (Len Cariou) who delivers all sorts of news items that make up a number of the onscreen jokes. News items like a recall on new safety harness equipment in cars that go around passenger's necks that instead decapitate the wearer upon impact. Yes, the humor here IS irreverent.

Mixed in with the news is a series of commercials and clips, most notable for the newest Steven Seagal movie coming out, C**KPUNCHER. If only I hadn't seen the previews for this movie it would have been so much funnier. Segal plays this trailer with a straight face, taking a humorous look at himself in the process. Congrats to him for the willingness to do so.

The second most prevalent story here involves an interview with teen pop sensation Melissa Cherry (Sarah McElligott) who keeps saying that there is nothing suggestive about any of her song lyrics or videos. This pretend innocence mimics that of pop stars like Britney Spears as Melissa's song ""Take Me From Behind"" that features a life sized stuffed teddy bear doing just that while she's on her hands and knees in bed proves she either has no clue what she's singing about or a plan to play innocent while doing the opposite.

A storyline that runs through the news behind the news is seen from beginning to end. Having been bought out by a conglomerate called Global Tetrahedron, product placements are all over the news broadcast. Penguins walking at lower screen level while world news is reported to blatant placements of company products get the best of our intrepid anchorman who complains without success.

One of the worst things about this film is its use of parts of the movie over and over and over again. The Seagal film and portions involving Melissa Cherry are seen from beginning to literally the end of the film. If you don't have enough original material to use why keep playing the same thing over and over to fill in time?

The film offers a few laughs, many of which are seen in the trailer you may have caught on other Fox releases. But for the most part it seems pretty lame.

3410794,2,B0017XOF50,"You're better off just reading the paper

""The Onion Movie"", shelved for 5 years - and now I see for relatively good reason - is finally on DVD, and I for one was happy to hear it was finally going to be released.  I find the paper humorous enough in its topical satire and nonsequiter parodies.  I also think their film and music critics are as balanced, informative, to the point and well-written, if not better than, many major media critics.  The fake-news, culure-skewing paper has a rabid following, too large to be considered a cult following, but still specialized enough that the community of readers make up something of an insiders-joke.  It is equal parts SNL style sketch comedy, National Lampoon political satire and Zucker Bothers pop culture parody; and surely at least part of the blueprint when Comedy Central was building ""The Daily Show"".

Its fan base had reason to rejoice at the news that the creators of paper as fearless, biting and pointed as ""the Onion"" would turn their satire and dry-witted brand of comedy into a feature film.  After all, The Onion skewers crappy movies, lame comedies, and Hollywood horses*#t in general on a regular basis.  If any writers could rise above the mediocre in writing a script for a slapstick satire, surely it's these guys, right?

Well, not so fast.  ""The Onion Movie"" is basically a riff on the ZAZ Team films of the 80s.  It is constructed like their ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" as a series of skits, loosely hung together by a unifying thread.  That thread here is a news journalist who reads off Onion headlines, which give way to various skits.  Some are parody movie trailers, some are faux pop star interviews, some are twisted human interest pieces, commercial parodies and political/world news jabs.  The joke is that corporate sponsors and Hollywood gossip-obsessed viewing audiences are ruining the news.

This is a fairly decent jumping off point for a film of this type, but just like many of the skits and parodies within the film, the writers have come up with a decent thesis, but their execution is most often weak.  For instance, early on there is a bit about a bank robber holding up a bank not for money, but for a job.  That is a funny idea, and would even make for some decent satirical jabs at the economy, but the writers can only come up with predictable gags from there and the skit just limps to a ho-hum conclusion.  ""Cockpuncher"", the reoccurring Steven Seagal film trailer, is funny enough, but they don't really ""go for it"".  Its humor is pretty obvious and safe.  It seems there had to be more there with a title like that and the real Steven Seagal at your disposal.  There is a Britney Spears parody that falls victim to the same problem.  It's funny initially, but the writers just seem to have nowhere else to go with it.  It's funny enough as is (love the `teddy bear'), but not as funny as it could, or should, be.  None of this is any better than what you can catch on any given weekend on say SNL or any show of that nature, and there has been much sharper satire of similar themes on shows like ""South Park"" over the years.

And some of it is downright bad.  There are some long, unfunny skits that go nowhere; like the 'rape game' or the white kid who acts black and then is mistaken for a black criminal.  The joke in these skits are clear, but the execution of those jokes are poor and unfunny.  It's too obvious where they are going from the get go and it takes them forever to get there.  Some of the race stuff is particularly disappointing because it seems thrown in, rather than developed into actual satirical commentary.

All the gags and skits come full circle at the end in a sequence, that like the movie, is alternately funny, lame and disappointing (though a Rodney Dangerfield cameo is welcome, if only because he has been gone for a while now, its nice to see him in something new, filmed before he died).

I was expecting much more from this movie.  I suppose if I were 12 again and was hanging out with some friends and we just happened to catch this on late night TV some night, we'd think it was a pretty great find.  It has the absurdity of the ZAZ films like ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" (a film I did initially see as a kid late one night not knowing what the heck it was), but none of that film's inspired wit.  If they were aiming at kids, then I suppose this move is a success, but for the Onion's core audience, and with their probably-high expectations to deliver something along the lines of the paper in terms of quality writing and social commentary, this film is a big misfire.  Plus, it's just not that funny.

The next time the Onion's critics trash some drek like ""Meet the Spartans"" for being tired, uninspired and pointless, you know they have to feel a little dirty inside knowing this then is the film the paper they are writing such reviews in, begging for quality comedies from Hollywood, made as a testimate to what film comedy, apparently by their standards, should be.

""The Onion Movie"" isn't awful, its juts incredibly mediocre It falls so far short of even the most minimalist of expectations Onion fans may have had for it, that it seems all the worse.  I found it funny that it is suggested this film be purchased with ""Meet the Spartans,"" a film the Onion (rightly) hated.  Having seen it now though, it all makes sense.",1212451200,21,5364,4.536382536382536

The DVD will need to be removed from its case and inserted into some kind of intermediate decoding / playback device that in turn needs to be connected to a television set.

*Note that the image size on a TV set will be much, much larger than the image presented on your computer screen. You will need to adjust your seating position accordingly. You can also invite both your friends over to watch the DVD with you, making it a social event as was common before the Internet fad changed everything.",1212192000,14,626,4.491228070175438
