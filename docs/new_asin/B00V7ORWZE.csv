7077145,5,B00V7ORWZE,I AM SO GLAD I FINALLY HAVE IT. EVERYTHING IS PERFECT. THIS IS MY FAVORITE ANIME OF ALL TIME. THANK YOU SENTAI FILMWORKS!!!!,1450310400,2,124,4.434782608695652
7077146,5,B00V7ORWZE,"This series is what you'd expect. It's a show with a lot of cute brought to the table, but that isn't a bad thing.

It's a series you can just watch and relax with. Something that can bring a smile when you really need one.

The extras and such are pretty bare bones, but the show itself is good. You do get all the episodes on one disc so you can burn through the show without having to change anything.

If you want a fun series that isn't involving the fate of the world being on the line this is a good choice.",1448236800,3,514,3.970873786407767

7077148,5,B00V7ORWZE,"Slice of Life, HS Girls, MS Girls, Funny Situations & Very Mild Fan Service, if that is what you want ""Is the Order a Rabbit"" has it.  It also has a good story with a young girl learning how to relate to people, with their all their eccentricities, and even a bit of mystery - what happened to Chino's mom, what was it exactly that caused her Grandfather to return as a rabbit after he passed away.  A fun show that entertains and leaves you thinking at times.  Oh, and there is a second season airing right now (Oct 2015).",1446076800,,523,4.21
7077149,5,B00V7ORWZE,"Solid contender in the ""slice of life"" or ""cute girls doing cute things"" de facto subcategories of anime. Not much of a deeper meaning or storyline, but that could be said of any sitcom-style show. If you don't mind that, and you haven't put yourself above enjoying slightly childish things, then this show will put more than a few smiles on your face with its cute characters, silly situations, and a frequent showing of rabbits.

This series is very inoffensive, so it might even be good for getting slightly older and well-read kids into foreign language material, as there's only a single Japanese audio track and English subtitles, unless I'm mistaken. It's also nice that this entire first season of episodes comes on one disc, and comes at a very reasonable price. My only real complaint is perhaps that the case is a bit flimsy, but I don't own many Blu-Ray discs, so maybe it's a common thing.

If you enjoy this show, keep an eye out for season 2!",1441929600,2,957,4.623529411764705
7077150,5,B00V7ORWZE,one of the best slice of life series of all time,1441065600,,48,3.4545454545454546
7077151,4,B00V7ORWZE,"Cocoa Hoto is a typical high school girl transferring to the city to attend a local high school. While attending school she stays at the Rabbit House cafe, a rabbit-themed coffee shop, and helps out by working as a barista, alongside Chino Kafu, the daughter of the Rabbit House owner, and Rize Tedeza, another high school girl working part time there. She also spends time with other friends, Chiya Ujimatsu, and Sharo Kirima, who work at other coffee and tea shops around the city.

This show focuses on the girls and things they do together, from working at the coffee house, visiting friends in their respective workplaces, and  especially hanging out as well as goofing around in between all that. All of the girl's names are based on drinks, which is more obvious if you say their surname/last name first.

The comedy is a bit hit and miss, but it's fairly consistent such as anytime Tippy talks, and the various character's reactions to hearing it. Or a lot of the things Cocoa does, such as when she gets pumped for the first day of school, only to later realize she went the day before the opening ceremony starts. And Rize's obsession with all things military, even going so far as to make tanks and fighter jets in the latte art.

Overall it was an enjoyable show, and one you could catch an episode on every now and then, especially with it's extremely catchy opening title song.",1432080000,6,1391,4.642276422764228
8709499,1,B00V7ORWZE,"I give 5 stars to the anime itself, but -4 stars to the publisher:
-1 star for the advertisements at the beginning. I paid full for a BD and you include ads? I can even remove ads in web streaming videos with much lower subscription price.
-1 star for the ugly subtitles. Terrible color and not changeable.
-2 stars for not letting me TURN OFF the subtitles. This is the first time I see a non-removable subtitle in a BD! Plus the font is so ugly!

So, I paid full to buy this BD, what did I get? An anime with ugly non-removable subtitles, plus ads at the beginning. I even once thought someone downloaded a web video and burned into this disc.
What's the difference with those web streaming anime? It's physical disc that needs a DB player to play, non-removable ads even though you paid more. NO video quality boost, NO multi language subtitles, NO removable subtitles, NO additional contents.

This US market publisher does not understand BD at all. They treat BD simply as a physical format of those web streaming videos. I believe BD buyers are expecting more than this, otherwise the web videos are cheaper, faster, and also have similar video quality and non-removable subtitles (many websites provide legal service, don't worry), it's enough for normal audiences.
If you are an anime collector, don't look at this. The original Japanese version is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than this.",1529366400,,1395,4.784232365145228

8709501,4,B00V7ORWZE,"This is an excellent series, and Sentai put together a pretty solid package. The show itself is just a super comfy SoL/comedy about cute girls who live in a French-decor-inspired town and run a cafe. It's a joy to watch and definitely worth repeat viewings.

This particular BD set is modest but effective. It has all 13 episodes on one disc plus the no credit OP and ED. For the low price, it's a perfectly acceptable value (and props for fitting the whole series on one disc).

The only complaint is that Sentai is still using outdated, ugly yellow subtitles that look like some miserable font rendered on a Windows ME computer. Other companies (especially Aniplex) have moved past this, as have fan subbers. There's no reason to use such an ugly font for subtitles. White text with black borders is just as readable but far more elegant looking. This is why I docked a star; otherwise it's a totally worthwhile purchase.",1476921600,,923,4.691358024691358
8709502,5,B00V7ORWZE,"This show is one of my all-time favorite feel good shows. This is one of those ""cute girls doing cute things"" shows that are sometimes plentiful, sometimes sprinkles throughout many other more action-packed shows of the season. The art direction is beautiful, the characters are likable, funny, and cute.

I definitely recommend this to anyone who has had a hard day and just wants to unwind and relax.

If ever I had the chance to live in an anime world, it would be this one hands-down.",1475107200,,488,4.662790697674419
8709503,5,B00V7ORWZE,"This show is one of the best slice of life anime out there with likable and well-written characters. Like many newer slice of life anime, it doesn't focus on school life of the characters, instead their lives as baristas becomes the main focus. There is a little amount of fanservice but it doesn't deter the show becoming family friendly. Like other slice of life shows, this anime focuses on cute interactions of the characters to create a fuzzy feeling on the viewer and brighten their day. This show's humour doesn't make the viewer laugh out loud but it usually puts a smile on the viewer face.",1474761600,,599,4.660377358490566

8709506,3,B00V7ORWZE,"""Cute girls doing cute things"" only with more fan service than I expected. Don't get me wrong; the funny parts are funny but it can be a bit hard to watch if you notice how the frequent clothes changing just seems to happen gratuitously. If you don't mind, don't notice, don't care, or just like that then you will probably like this series.",1457395200,,341,4.428571428571429
8709507,5,B00V7ORWZE,"Most hesitate to spend more than thirty dollars on an anime with only 12 episodes.
And no English dub at that (imo it doesn't need one).
Still, i guess in a show where nothing significant happens you'd have to rely on the characters to make or keep the show appealing.
