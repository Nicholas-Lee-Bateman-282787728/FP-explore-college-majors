5079522,1,B007EQQL6K,"I love a good documentary especially about an interesting figure. Thank goodness this was included in my prime membership. I would have been disappointed had I paid for this. The contributors obviously have read about Whitney Houston, just as we all have. That doesn't make them intimates qualified for this. In fact, Josh? obviously had no idea what he is taking about. Almost everything he says contradicts Cissy Houston's book. Read it if you want details about Whitney's life.",1384819200,8,480,5.0886075949367084
5079523,2,B007EQQL6K,"Lots of clips and stats re: how well all her albums did, awards she won, etc.  But have to give this only 2 stars because there were absolutely NO music clips included.  I mean how can you have a Whitney bio and not include any of her music?  If you're a Whitney trivia buff, perhaps there might be some factoid that would make this worthwhile for you.  But for those of us who were mezmerized by that unparalleled voice and charisma, this bio simply does not do her or her gift justice!",1359849600,10,487,4.260869565217392

5079529,5,B007EQQL6K,"It gave a lot more info about how Whitney started and a peek into the musical family she comes from.

5079553,1,B007EQQL6K,"Well, it is an UNAUTHORIZED  documentary.  From what I can see, it is merely the opinions of random individuals.  However it's more colorful and interesting coming from patrons of beauty salons and barber shops than what's presented in this video.",1467504000,,247,5.125
5079558,4,B007EQQL6K,Whitney was so beautiful and talented before drugs wrecked her life.  Hers is such a sad story because we all wanted her to turn her life around and felt helpless as she continued her downward spiral.  This is a painful story to watch.,1466640000,2,235,4.441860465116279

5079625,4,B007EQQL6K,Whitney Houston's life is a lesson for those who live and depend on drugs to hold them up when they are down - in any way.  A prop can't last.  I'd like to see the documentary redone to serve a greater purpose.  She had it all and lost it to drugs.  Well done as far as the documentary and its intended purpose - to show her life and death.  Excellent display of surrender to moral turpitude.,1453766400,,392,4.105263157894737

Whitney grew up in East Orange NJ  The school that was named after her is also located in East Orange NJ.  I grew up in East Orange NJ. We are proud of our heritage so people should get it right. West Orange NJ  was the Caucasian city while East Orange NJ  was a very good mix of African American and Caucasian. I lived down the St. from Dionne Warwick and was in high school with her brother.

8515302,2,B007EQQL6K,"I am no WH connoisseur; however, I do remember that my father, an 83 year old, loved her voice immensely, and reveled every time he was blessed to hear her sing. He truly enjoyed her, and made certain everyone in the room appreciated her voice the way he did. I remember her in the 1980s, as she was climbing through what I though was the peak of her career. She was ""magnificent,"" in every way. I remember her in, ""The Bodyguard,"" and how that on screen relationship between her on Kevin Costner sparked the best in a lot of young men at the time. I was in  the Ranger battalion, and some of my Lieutenants remarked about having seen her in concert, or heard her latest hit single. I mention this because these are not emotions one normally hears from personnel in the Ranger Battalion. What lit that fuse was the film, ""The Bodyguard."" Young warriors originating from virtually anyplace on the planet saw themselves in Costner's role. They wanted to protect that kind of innocence from evil. They wanted to be the hero, to fall in love with the damsel in distress. It was classic to see unfold, and fortunately I was young enough to appreciate it, yet old enough to understand what I was witnessing.

Throughout the 1990's as she (my opinion) began falling apart, it was troubling to watch my father become devastated by the negative news. While he still loved her voice, purchased her music and never missed a performance, local or otherwise; he was conflicted by the stories of drug use and abuse, of the ""bad girl"" image she seemed to be wittingly fostering. He was troubled most by her aggressive counter attacks directed toward any and all fans, as well as colleagues and other industry professionals who remarked about her descending image. It was as if she felt she had no need to deny bad behavior; to the contrary, it seemed she defended her right to behave anyway that she wanted to, and damn anyone who attempts to deny her that reality by criticizing her for who she dated, how she lived and whatever direction her life was taking. For so many of her fans it was highly destructive. What a tragedy, this stunning, God given voice being wasted.

This film does very little to address this aspect of her life. In fact, it glosses over it very quickly. It takes the approach of, ""Yeah it happened, but not as bad or severe as you all think that it did, and so what anyway, and if you pay attention to that--then you are neglecting all the great things she did in her life."" Actually, that is not how fans see it. They paid attention to it not because it diminished the good she did in life; rather, they paid attention to it because ""WH"" was no longer the WH everyone came to know and love. Fans worried about her as a person, and were shattered by the decisions and influences in her life that ultimately shortened her life. This is what they were afraid would happen, and it did, just as if it were written on a wall. Fans were very hurt by this self destructive behavior that suddenly appeared after certain ""personalities"" entered the picture.

I'm sorry she is no longer with us. Watching this video, I thought how tragic it is that we missed out on what may well have been the better half of her life. As I watched, I thought of how many films we missed after her early passing, how many more hit singles, and albums filled with them did we miss. There is nothing fair or calming in her ending, and unfortunately this documentary did not tell at least one-half of the story that is her life.",1497484800,,3508,4.485133020344288
8515303,1,B007EQQL6K,"This is a low-budget, slanted view of Whitney Houston.  It is a tick-off-the-main-events production with cheap graphics and interviews of friends who rightfully laud her voice and wrongfully try to downplay the seriousness of her addiction issues.  Her marriage with Bobby Brown is almost treated like an afterthought, and there is no mention whatsoever of the domestic abuse.  As much, if not more, of her life in the spotlight was spent in decline, but that was treated more like a brief blip here.  But viewing the interviews of friends does give a peek at classic enabling and co-dependence cover-up/downplay dynamics.  There was not a single music sound clip, and way too much talk.  The biggest detractor was the pseudo-host Josh ""Sparkle"" Johnson, a man who needs to work on his pervasive ""uh"" and ""um"" habit.  If there was a Cliffs Notes on Whitney Houston, it would be more informative and charming than this slap-dash piece.",1486425600,2,934,4.987096774193549

8515309,1,B007EQQL6K,"What a stupid documentary!  A boring list of Whitney Houston's awards and publication dates with static, mechanical recitations of various people who knew her or knew of her and precious little insight into Houston, the human being.  The monotonous verbiage which might as well have been delivered by computer synthesis or a child learning to read completely fail to bring Houston to life as a person.  I find nothing redeeming in this film, and resent the loss of my time.  Don't waste yours on this piece of garbage.  If there is no other documentary on Houston, do yourself the favor and wait for the publication of a better attempt to chronicle her life.",1480464000,4,658,4.787610619469026
