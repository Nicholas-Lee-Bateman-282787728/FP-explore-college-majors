3167327,4,B00175GAI8,"Little Alejandro (""Ale"") is an enterprising little scrapper and orphan lives by his wits in a down at the heels section of Queens.  Living by his wits - earning and saving money by ways legal and shady - he hoards his dollars to buy a truck that he envisions will become a mobile food cart business for himself and his older sister, Isamar.

Ale's vision of the future is jarred by some looming financial realities that surface only after he has negotiated the purchase of the beat-up van.  Plus, he is shattered to discover his sister's method of earning extra cash.

This gritty film has a documentary-like feel to it, set in Queens within sight of Shea Stadium.  Alejandro Polanco is brilliant as the industrious ""Ale"" of the movie.  The film's ending may be abrupt to some and offers little resolution.

A tree may grow in Brooklyn but a chop shop thrives in Queens.  ""Chop Shop"" is a good film, a gritty slice of a tough life.",1219449600,3,931,4.532934131736527
3167328,5,B00175GAI8,"The film's protagonist, Alejandro, a preteen orphan, lives and works in a chop shop, an auto parts dealer that specializes in breaking down whole cars into parts; cars that, usually, are stolen.

The shop is owned by Rob, an actual chop shop owner, who generously provides Ale with shelter and money but exploits him for his hard, cheap labor. This is the landscape of Bahrani's film: a vicious, ugly stasis between abject poverty and comfortable living, a place where life is defined by the fruits of a day's labor--a place devoid of hope and dreams. Yet, Ale dares to dream.

Two words sum up this movie for me: sincere and touching.

At the heart of ""Chop Shop"" is the relationship between Alejandro and his slightly older sister, Isamar. We see them struggle through the trials of life, amid a wasteland section of Queens, New York, with each hardship enforcing a necessity to persevere, the constant struggle becoming their reason to exist. The specifics don't even matter--this is a film about people and life, the harsh background being merely that: a habitat for humans to act and react. There is not much else to provoke the inexplicably orphaned children, as the landscape and all prospects for the youths are bleak. Yet, they possess love and an undying will, a hope, to succeed, a richness paradoxically provided them by poverty. And for this they are willing to suffer themselves. They live for the day, for what will come of their suffering, with hopes of something else a seemingly distant yet powerful reason to live in the now. To make things happen.

So, at the film's end, there is no sadness. No anti-climax. And, also, no sentimental, Hollywood-ending to undermine all that's come before. There is as much hope here as we're allotted in the brilliant closing shot of De Sica's ""Bicycle Thief"", a movie undoubtedly having its imprint on Chop Shop and filmmaker Ramin Bahran's previous film, 2005's ""Man Push Cart"". A message that, though, life may not be all right, it will continue. That the film's closing shot is, apparently, mundane, proves that much more is going on in these last seconds; life goes on, yes, and though trying, the struggle against one's circumstance can be enough to validate existence. Ale and Isamar ARE because they struggle. It becomes what informs their habits and routines. It is no sin to live in dream, Bahrani tells us through his film, but a travesty to rely on its potential to transform. A brilliant work of art.

Extremely recommended for fans of his previous film ""Man Push Cart"".

3167331,4,B00175GAI8,"Writer/director Ramin Bahrani turns his attention to Willets Point, or the ""Iron Triangle"" area, on the outskirts of Queens in ""Chop Shop"", a cinema verite-style drama of youthful hope and frustration in this industrial desert. Ale (Alejandro Polanco) is an orphaned but industrious pubescent Latino boy who makes a living helping out at an auto body shop, whose owner Rob (Rob Sowulski) lets him live in the room above the shop. Determined to accumulate some savings, he earns extra cash as a day laborer and peddling odds and ends. When his older sister Isamar (Isamar Gonzales) returns to the neighborhood, Ale proudly shows off his little apartment and tries everything he can think of to make her happy and hopeful.

""Chop Shop"" was cast with non-professional actors who are certainly convincing in their roles, though I didn't find them natural in every scene. This is a loose narrative, and the miles of concrete, junk, and auto shops a stone's throw from Shea Stadium is a strong character in itself. I don't think that anyone actually lives in Willet's Point, and Ale and Isamar seem to be the only people who do in the movie. ""Chop Shop"" is an ambiguous sort of coming of age story, a slice of life of two capable young people on their own and without any means of support beyond their own hard work. Though Ale's plight is gut-wrenching at times, the optimism and dreams of this 12-year-old suffuse the film with hopefulness.

The DVD (Koch Lorber 2008): Bonus features include a theatrical trailer (3 min), 8 segments of rehearsals, training, and actors interacting, and a feature commentary by writer/director Ramin Bahrani, cinematographer Michael Simmonds, and actor Alejandro Polanco. The commentary is constant and eclectic.

Even in watching the rehearsal extras on the DVD, he appears to have the makings of a promising actor. This is his only film but I hope he continues.

This is not a film to watch if you are looking for something light with child actors, this is quite the opposite. I have never seen such adult themes and scenes in a film with actors this age.

3167333,4,B00175GAI8,"Chop Shop is a long way from Times Square, but, though well hidden from the New York of tourism and most films, it is as real or more so than those more camera-ready locations.  Primarily the story of 12 year old Ale, a street orphan in Queens, trying to make a life for himself and his older sister, the plot is neither surprising nor complicated.  It's about life for most of the eight million in New York, getting through day by day and, with luck and pluck (the latter Ale has in spades, the former not so much) sometimes getting a little bit ahead.  So Chop Shop plays like a documentary of hand-to-mouth days as Ale and his sister dream of buying and refitting an old truck for a mobile food business.  What happens to that modest dream and to their relationship, including a graceful and quiet reconciliation at the film's end, makes Chop Shop an engaging evening -- all the more so as you realize that the majority of the cast are not trained actors but, instead, denizens of the landscape they inhabit.",1308355200,,1011,4.478260869565218

3167335,4,B00175GAI8,"I love gritty drama films.  Especially those that include a coming of age story.  This poignant film by director Ramin Bahrani and writer Bahareh Azimi showcases the struggle of a Latino street orphan to make life better for himself and his sister.  Ale, played wonderfully by Alejandro Polanco in his first staring role, finds a job working for a local mechanic doing odd jobs.  He finds out that his sister is doing some things on the side for money that aren't, well, ""respectable"".  His portrayal was very realistic and at times it seemed like I was watching a documentary.

There isn't much of a plot here, but you can't help but to appreciate the performances.  The two leads, Polanco and Isamar Gonzales (Ale's Sister) were found at a local school with no prior acting experience or study.  Finding that out post viewing made me appreciate their ""chops"" even more so.  Also, most of the extra's were just people milling around their normal lives in Queens.  This is why this type of film is labeled as ""neo-realism"" and why it was such a successful production.

The setting of the film by itself is a character of the movie.  Shot in Willets Point, Queens in New York, this IS the real deal.  Bahrani mentions in an interview with Alt Film Guide that ""...I am making films about how the majority of people in this world live, and we must also accept that this majority is utterly ignored by Hollywood and Independent film...""  So true he is.  The gritty real background of Chop Shop pulls the audience even more into the performances of the actors.  Allowing the director to ""...direct without directing."" as he mentions in the same interview.

Being that there is not much of a plot in this movie, one has to ask why?  Was there a reason the writers chose to concentrate on a ""section"" of time in this boys life?  Yes, it was to show that in real life things happen, secrets are revealed and life goes on.  I appreciated the fact that this was just a snippet of what Ale's existence is really like.  We don't know if he gets out of the slums or if his sister succeeds in a more productive endeavor.  What we do know is that life is hard, and sometimes you have to do what you have to do to survive.  The situations presented in this film were shown without a filter so to speak.  Ramin Bahrani did a wonderful job giving us a glimpse into the street life so many children are part of today.

Cinematographer Michael Simmons, who also worked on ""Man Push Cart"" the directors first film, was outstanding.  He moved the camera a lot, but it was to the benefit of the viewer in my opinion.  We weren't concentrated on one central character, we were distracted by the goings on around the dialog on screen, much like it would be in real life.  The production team filmed using the High Definition Sony F900 then blew up the final product to 35mm.  It was a good decision and gave the film that gritty, documentary feel the director was going for.

I really enjoyed this little slice of life from Queens.  It was something I haven't really seen before so that was refreshing.  I've bumped this up to a 4/5 due to the striking performances of the actors.  Initially I would have given a 3/5 due to the fact that with all of the films positive points, it was still a little boring.  If you are looking for a stylized extravagant production with a happy ending, you may want to look elsewhere.  For those looking for an experience unlike many out there, this one is for you.

3167336,5,B00175GAI8,"Chop Shop is an incredibly well done film that manages to be vivid, gritty, and moving all at once as it paints a portrait of two young people, a young Latino lad named Ale and his older teenage sister Isamar. The film clearly has a documentary flavor to it and the hand-held camera footage works wonders for this film. Indeed, Alejandro Polanco and Isamar Gonzalez perform so well you'd swear they simply weren't acting and that this was a look at the lives of real two people, pure and simple. The action move along at a fine pace; you really get to know Ale, Isamar and the people in their lives and the filmmakers never once rush things nor do they let things drag on; and I like that a lot. The script and casting were very well done; Alejandro Polanco had no prior acting experience but wow, how he gives a convincing performance! He is destined to become a bright star if that's what he wants to do with his life. Isamar Gonzalez turns out an equally brilliant performance.

When the action begins, we quickly meet Ale, an orphaned young lad of perhaps eleven or twelve; Ale works like a dog in a chop shop in a part of Queens, New York City, where crime and poverty are facts of life. He knows how to remove parts from cars and how to add parts to cars; and his boss is teaching him how to prime and part cars as well. Ale certainly doesn't have the best relationship with his boss; Ale wants to count his payday money as soon as his boss gives it to him which makes the boss angry, to say the least. At this point Ale's older teenage sister, Isamar, comes to live with him in a small, makeshift apartment above the chop shop. As Ale essentially takes the lead in terms of trying to care for himself and Isamar, he is stunned and very upset when he discovers how Isamar makes extra money in addition to her day job; but he internalizes his angst and frustration, never once confronting her. In addition, Ale and Isamar are saving up money as fast as they can to buy an old truck from which they can sell food and become their own bosses.

Unfortunately, life being what it is, not everything goes well for Ale and Isamar; some events are heartbreaking while others are full of feeling, including the brief scene in which a man shows Ale how to feed the pigeons and make ""friends"" with them. It's also interesting to note that while Ale and Isamar are presumably orphans, there isn't even a single reference to their parents--or any other family members at all.

The DVD comes with an optional running commentary and there is another featurette simply entitled ""Rehearsals.""

Chop Shop is a delight for fans of director Ramin Bahrani and people everywhere who enjoy very high quality independent dramas with unknown actors performing brilliantly.",1268438400,,2753,4.511022044088176
3167337,2,B00175GAI8,"While I can respect that some people loved this movie, I considered it average at best.  Being a Spanish speaker, I appreciate movies (especially gritty ones) that involve Latin characters.  So it was with great disappointment that I found this oft-praised movie to be plain and uninspiring.

If there's a trend amongst the five-star reviews here and on other sites, it's that most of those viewers were fans of director Ramin Bahrani's previous work, mentioning ""Man Push Cart"" in particular.  There have been plenty of movies involving the struggles of youth living in impoverished inner-city conditions (Fresh, South Central), this movie does nothing to raise the bar nor offer a new perspective.  While Ebert and other critics may praise the directing and cinematography, the movie doesn't bring much else to the table.

I had genuinely hoped to enjoy this movie after reading all of the positive reviews.  Unfortunately, I was left greatly unsatisfied.  If you are already familiar with movies like City of God, Sin Nombre and Juice, give this one a rent before you consider buying the DVD.",1264636800,3,1095,5.078212290502793

3167339,5,B00175GAI8,"This is only my second Amazon movie review, and I was compelled to write it because this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  That of course means that all the usual elements of movie making (writing, acting, directing, etc.) are handled with excellence but, more importantly, this movie can deeply touch and move you in ways that you can't even fully grasp, and the effect can be long lasting (it has been for me).  To be sure, this isn't a feel-good movie, but something subtly positive can still be found in it (see below).

I won't get into the details of the plot or characters, since I think it's really better that you come to the movie with minimal preconceptions and let things unfold and connect naturally.  Let me instead just mention some of the general themes and lessons I drew from the movie, and that will hopefully tell you something useful without saying too much.

Most obviously, the movie shows, in a vivid yet nuanced way, just how difficult life can be in the poorer parts of urban America, to the point where even basic survival is a daily challenge and utter despair would be an understandable response.  Yet we find that the human instinct is to push on and persevere, and we see that part of this instinct involves an ability to find a space for moments of simple and genuine happiness, sustained friendship and love, and even hope against all odds.  In other words, we humans can often prove to be fairly resilient and even humane in circumstances that seemingly should reduce us to brutes.  And therein lies the capacity of the movie to subtly uplift us: we learn, by example, about both empathy and facing the challenges in our own lives.

If the above observations don't seem so special, please blame me, not the movie, since I really can't do justice to this masterpiece.  And, in a way, I don't quite blame myself either, since any truly great movie should accomplish something which goes well beyond what a reviewer can describe, summarize, or even critique.  This is just such a movie, so I would urge you to experience it without hesitation.  The only prerequisites are a perceptive eye, an open mind, and a sensitive heart.",1243296000,2,2166,4.641361256544503
3167340,3,B00175GAI8,"Chop Shop will not be to everyone's taste.  Meticulously and beautifully shot, it (as the English teachers say) lacks steady advance.  It has a beginning, but not really much of a middle and end.  A slice-of-life, apparent-but-not-real documentary, it concerns a 12 year-old boy who works in an  auto repair shop in the shadow of Shea Stadium.  His sole intention at this point in his life is to support himself and his older sister and keep their family together.  This hope is briefly threatened but then resolved, favorably.  If you enjoy watching a human relationship under trying circumstances, you will enjoy Chop Shop.  If you like a more conventional narrative with standard plot arcs you will find it very slow.  Nearly each shot is the result of 30-50 takes and even though the sets are limited and somewhat claustrophobic, the attention to cinematic detail is clear.",1240531200,4,877,4.9520547945205475

3167342,5,B00175GAI8,"As with his previous film, ""Man Push Cart,"" director Ramin Bahrani paints a bracingly honest portrait of immigrant life on the economic edges of New York City. In ""Chop Shop"" we meet two orphaned children, energetic, enterprising Alejandro, and his older sister Isi, who he takes care of more than she takes care of him. At the start of the film, Ale is out on the streets, working any angles he can think of to find food or small change. When an opportunity for work (and a place to stay) arises, he seizes it instantly, and swiftly settles into a position as an assistant in a low-rent auto garage in New York's ""Iron Triangle"", where dozens of so-called ""chop shops"" compete for business with an endless stream of beat-up old cars. Alejandro winds up in one of the more honest shops, living in a cramped space above the garage floor, learning the tools of the trade and using his considerable charisma and self-confidence to steer potential customers into the front door.

""Chop Shop"" shares several themes with Bahrani's earlier masterpiece, ""Man Push Cart,"" but differs from that film in that no back story is presented to explain why or how these kids would up homeless -- they just are, and they simply deal with the situation as best they can. Like ""Man Push Cart,"" the movie is full of tension and dread, but often defies viewer expectations, which are generally shaped by decades of cliched storytelling. Bahrani's films, however, are anything but cliched -- his cinema verite style creates an earthy, palpable reality, one that draws you in completely and rivets your attention. The dramas he presents are both so humble and so dire that they are utterly compelling, and make this a very fine film.

Great acting from his cast, particularly from Alejandro Polanco, a natural actor with as much charm and inner wit as his character, and Ahmad Razvi, who plays one of the neighboring garage owners. The cast features many actual chop-shop workers, adding an extra layer of reality and authenticity to this remarkable film.  Definitely worth checking out!

3401830,4,B00175GAI8,"Chop Shop is a long way from Times Square, but, though well hidden from the New York of tourism and most films, it is as real or more so than those more camera-ready locations.  Primarily the story of 12 year old Ale, a street orphan in Queens, trying to make a life for himself and his older sister, the plot is neither surprising nor complicated.  It's about life for most of the eight million in New York, getting through day by day and, with luck and pluck (the latter Ale has in spades, the former not so much) sometimes getting a little bit ahead.  So Chop Shop plays like a documentary of hand-to-mouth days as Ale and his sister dream of buying and refitting an old truck for a mobile food business.  What happens to that modest dream and to their relationship, including a graceful and quiet reconciliation at the film's end, makes Chop Shop an engaging evening -- all the more so as you realize that the majority of the cast are not trained actors but, instead, denizens of the landscape they inhabit.",1308355200,,1011,4.478260869565218

3401832,4,B00175GAI8,"I love gritty drama films.  Especially those that include a coming of age story.  This poignant film by director Ramin Bahrani and writer Bahareh Azimi showcases the struggle of a Latino street orphan to make life better for himself and his sister.  Ale, played wonderfully by Alejandro Polanco in his first staring role, finds a job working for a local mechanic doing odd jobs.  He finds out that his sister is doing some things on the side for money that aren't, well, ""respectable"".  His portrayal was very realistic and at times it seemed like I was watching a documentary.

There isn't much of a plot here, but you can't help but to appreciate the performances.  The two leads, Polanco and Isamar Gonzales (Ale's Sister) were found at a local school with no prior acting experience or study.  Finding that out post viewing made me appreciate their ""chops"" even more so.  Also, most of the extra's were just people milling around their normal lives in Queens.  This is why this type of film is labeled as ""neo-realism"" and why it was such a successful production.

The setting of the film by itself is a character of the movie.  Shot in Willets Point, Queens in New York, this IS the real deal.  Bahrani mentions in an interview with Alt Film Guide that ""...I am making films about how the majority of people in this world live, and we must also accept that this majority is utterly ignored by Hollywood and Independent film...""  So true he is.  The gritty real background of Chop Shop pulls the audience even more into the performances of the actors.  Allowing the director to ""...direct without directing."" as he mentions in the same interview.

Being that there is not much of a plot in this movie, one has to ask why?  Was there a reason the writers chose to concentrate on a ""section"" of time in this boys life?  Yes, it was to show that in real life things happen, secrets are revealed and life goes on.  I appreciated the fact that this was just a snippet of what Ale's existence is really like.  We don't know if he gets out of the slums or if his sister succeeds in a more productive endeavor.  What we do know is that life is hard, and sometimes you have to do what you have to do to survive.  The situations presented in this film were shown without a filter so to speak.  Ramin Bahrani did a wonderful job giving us a glimpse into the street life so many children are part of today.

Cinematographer Michael Simmons, who also worked on ""Man Push Cart"" the directors first film, was outstanding.  He moved the camera a lot, but it was to the benefit of the viewer in my opinion.  We weren't concentrated on one central character, we were distracted by the goings on around the dialog on screen, much like it would be in real life.  The production team filmed using the High Definition Sony F900 then blew up the final product to 35mm.  It was a good decision and gave the film that gritty, documentary feel the director was going for.

I really enjoyed this little slice of life from Queens.  It was something I haven't really seen before so that was refreshing.  I've bumped this up to a 4/5 due to the striking performances of the actors.  Initially I would have given a 3/5 due to the fact that with all of the films positive points, it was still a little boring.  If you are looking for a stylized extravagant production with a happy ending, you may want to look elsewhere.  For those looking for an experience unlike many out there, this one is for you.

3401833,5,B00175GAI8,"Chop Shop is an incredibly well done film that manages to be vivid, gritty, and moving all at once as it paints a portrait of two young people, a young Latino lad named Ale and his older teenage sister Isamar. The film clearly has a documentary flavor to it and the hand-held camera footage works wonders for this film. Indeed, Alejandro Polanco and Isamar Gonzalez perform so well you'd swear they simply weren't acting and that this was a look at the lives of real two people, pure and simple. The action move along at a fine pace; you really get to know Ale, Isamar and the people in their lives and the filmmakers never once rush things nor do they let things drag on; and I like that a lot. The script and casting were very well done; Alejandro Polanco had no prior acting experience but wow, how he gives a convincing performance! He is destined to become a bright star if that's what he wants to do with his life. Isamar Gonzalez turns out an equally brilliant performance.

When the action begins, we quickly meet Ale, an orphaned young lad of perhaps eleven or twelve; Ale works like a dog in a chop shop in a part of Queens, New York City, where crime and poverty are facts of life. He knows how to remove parts from cars and how to add parts to cars; and his boss is teaching him how to prime and part cars as well. Ale certainly doesn't have the best relationship with his boss; Ale wants to count his payday money as soon as his boss gives it to him which makes the boss angry, to say the least. At this point Ale's older teenage sister, Isamar, comes to live with him in a small, makeshift apartment above the chop shop. As Ale essentially takes the lead in terms of trying to care for himself and Isamar, he is stunned and very upset when he discovers how Isamar makes extra money in addition to her day job; but he internalizes his angst and frustration, never once confronting her. In addition, Ale and Isamar are saving up money as fast as they can to buy an old truck from which they can sell food and become their own bosses.

Unfortunately, life being what it is, not everything goes well for Ale and Isamar; some events are heartbreaking while others are full of feeling, including the brief scene in which a man shows Ale how to feed the pigeons and make ""friends"" with them. It's also interesting to note that while Ale and Isamar are presumably orphans, there isn't even a single reference to their parents--or any other family members at all.

The DVD comes with an optional running commentary and there is another featurette simply entitled ""Rehearsals.""

Chop Shop is a delight for fans of director Ramin Bahrani and people everywhere who enjoy very high quality independent dramas with unknown actors performing brilliantly.",1268438400,,2753,4.511022044088176
3401834,2,B00175GAI8,"While I can respect that some people loved this movie, I considered it average at best.  Being a Spanish speaker, I appreciate movies (especially gritty ones) that involve Latin characters.  So it was with great disappointment that I found this oft-praised movie to be plain and uninspiring.

If there's a trend amongst the five-star reviews here and on other sites, it's that most of those viewers were fans of director Ramin Bahrani's previous work, mentioning ""Man Push Cart"" in particular.  There have been plenty of movies involving the struggles of youth living in impoverished inner-city conditions (Fresh, South Central), this movie does nothing to raise the bar nor offer a new perspective.  While Ebert and other critics may praise the directing and cinematography, the movie doesn't bring much else to the table.

I had genuinely hoped to enjoy this movie after reading all of the positive reviews.  Unfortunately, I was left greatly unsatisfied.  If you are already familiar with movies like City of God, Sin Nombre and Juice, give this one a rent before you consider buying the DVD.",1264636800,3,1095,5.078212290502793

3401836,5,B00175GAI8,"This is only my second Amazon movie review, and I was compelled to write it because this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  That of course means that all the usual elements of movie making (writing, acting, directing, etc.) are handled with excellence but, more importantly, this movie can deeply touch and move you in ways that you can't even fully grasp, and the effect can be long lasting (it has been for me).  To be sure, this isn't a feel-good movie, but something subtly positive can still be found in it (see below).

I won't get into the details of the plot or characters, since I think it's really better that you come to the movie with minimal preconceptions and let things unfold and connect naturally.  Let me instead just mention some of the general themes and lessons I drew from the movie, and that will hopefully tell you something useful without saying too much.

Most obviously, the movie shows, in a vivid yet nuanced way, just how difficult life can be in the poorer parts of urban America, to the point where even basic survival is a daily challenge and utter despair would be an understandable response.  Yet we find that the human instinct is to push on and persevere, and we see that part of this instinct involves an ability to find a space for moments of simple and genuine happiness, sustained friendship and love, and even hope against all odds.  In other words, we humans can often prove to be fairly resilient and even humane in circumstances that seemingly should reduce us to brutes.  And therein lies the capacity of the movie to subtly uplift us: we learn, by example, about both empathy and facing the challenges in our own lives.

If the above observations don't seem so special, please blame me, not the movie, since I really can't do justice to this masterpiece.  And, in a way, I don't quite blame myself either, since any truly great movie should accomplish something which goes well beyond what a reviewer can describe, summarize, or even critique.  This is just such a movie, so I would urge you to experience it without hesitation.  The only prerequisites are a perceptive eye, an open mind, and a sensitive heart.",1243296000,2,2166,4.641361256544503
3401837,3,B00175GAI8,"Chop Shop will not be to everyone's taste.  Meticulously and beautifully shot, it (as the English teachers say) lacks steady advance.  It has a beginning, but not really much of a middle and end.  A slice-of-life, apparent-but-not-real documentary, it concerns a 12 year-old boy who works in an  auto repair shop in the shadow of Shea Stadium.  His sole intention at this point in his life is to support himself and his older sister and keep their family together.  This hope is briefly threatened but then resolved, favorably.  If you enjoy watching a human relationship under trying circumstances, you will enjoy Chop Shop.  If you like a more conventional narrative with standard plot arcs you will find it very slow.  Nearly each shot is the result of 30-50 takes and even though the sets are limited and somewhat claustrophobic, the attention to cinematic detail is clear.",1240531200,4,877,4.9520547945205475

3401839,5,B00175GAI8,"As with his previous film, ""Man Push Cart,"" director Ramin Bahrani paints a bracingly honest portrait of immigrant life on the economic edges of New York City. In ""Chop Shop"" we meet two orphaned children, energetic, enterprising Alejandro, and his older sister Isi, who he takes care of more than she takes care of him. At the start of the film, Ale is out on the streets, working any angles he can think of to find food or small change. When an opportunity for work (and a place to stay) arises, he seizes it instantly, and swiftly settles into a position as an assistant in a low-rent auto garage in New York's ""Iron Triangle"", where dozens of so-called ""chop shops"" compete for business with an endless stream of beat-up old cars. Alejandro winds up in one of the more honest shops, living in a cramped space above the garage floor, learning the tools of the trade and using his considerable charisma and self-confidence to steer potential customers into the front door.

""Chop Shop"" shares several themes with Bahrani's earlier masterpiece, ""Man Push Cart,"" but differs from that film in that no back story is presented to explain why or how these kids would up homeless -- they just are, and they simply deal with the situation as best they can. Like ""Man Push Cart,"" the movie is full of tension and dread, but often defies viewer expectations, which are generally shaped by decades of cliched storytelling. Bahrani's films, however, are anything but cliched -- his cinema verite style creates an earthy, palpable reality, one that draws you in completely and rivets your attention. The dramas he presents are both so humble and so dire that they are utterly compelling, and make this a very fine film.

Great acting from his cast, particularly from Alejandro Polanco, a natural actor with as much charm and inner wit as his character, and Ahmad Razvi, who plays one of the neighboring garage owners. The cast features many actual chop-shop workers, adding an extra layer of reality and authenticity to this remarkable film.  Definitely worth checking out!

We are back to Sisyphus again, and still maintaining that the routine can get you through.
I'd say the big challenge here was working with a preteen.  Preconceived notions of what a 12 year old boy is like might adjust when processed through a chop shop.  This goes beyond the 'life is hard and then you die' framework. 'Put your dreams away for another day'; not even.
One commenter, not reviewer, here questioned why someone characterized this as an important film.  I imagine people come to it primed to find or fail to find their own personal meaning.

8264898,5,B00175GAI8,"Before I purchased this movie, I used to rent it at my local library on a bi-weekly basis until someone stole it(I guess someone liked it more than me). This movie shows what a person can do when they possess determination, courage, and street smarts. This is the story of Alejandro,(Ally) and his sister Isamar. They are two displaced kids who live in a garage in Queens, NY. The film does not explain where their parents are, the only thing we get to know about them is that the sister Isamar has been staying in ""safe homes, has learned to cook good meals,and has finished 10th grade. The only thing we find out about Ally's past is that he didn't go to school.
 The plot of the movie centers around Ally and Isamar's desire to own and operate a liunch truck. Ally is the more serious of the two even though he is younger than Isamar ,who we find out is prostituting herself inside the trucks parked around the area(think lot lizard). Ally looks the other way as his sister prostitutes, and is trying hard to change their lives. Ally and his sister are very close, but Isamar wants to do things most teens do like hang out with her friend Lila and go on dates. Ally is more enterprising than most adults, he and his friend Carlos sell candy to people on the subway, and bootleg dvd's to the men that work in the garage.
This is a great movie and I would recommend it, because it shows what you can do if you are determined, even if it doesn't always turn out as planned",1324080000,,1472,4.333333333333333
8264899,4,B00175GAI8,"Solid, well made, beautifully shot neo-realist film.  A 12 year old boy, living on his own, works in an auto repair place, in the midst of Queens (New York) surreal iron triangle of low rent car shops.  His 16 year old sister joins him, and they dream of bigger things, while she works part time as a hooker, and he works at the shop, runs scams, and steals.  It all feels very real, the sense of detail of a strange world is terrific,

That said, the film doesn't have quite the emotional punch for me of the films Bahrani made on either side of it; ""Man Push Cart"" and ""Goodbye Solo"", both of which I found very powerful. This somehow feels film feels just a bit disconnected, objective.  Maybe thats in part because tI felt aware that the young lead he was saying lines and following directions. He didn't (for me) have quite that magic realism that you see in certain performances by little kids (e.g. ""Pixote"" or ""Forbidden Games"") And in turn that kept me from getting quite as emotionally invested as I did with, say, Pixote.  The film is always interesting, just never quite transcended into greatness for me.  That said, I know many people who flat out loved it, so I would suggest seeing for yourself.  Even with my quibbles, it's still a very good film by a first rate film-maker.

A side note; if you are at all impressed by director Bahrani's work, I'd strongly suggest you search out his wonderful short film ""Plastic Bag"" which is viewable on YouTube, and other sites on the web (a quick Google will find it). He teamed up with the great Werner Herzog (who narrates) to tell the first person story of the life of an unwanted plastic bag in a film that is visually beautiful, very funny, and very sad. One of the best, non-preachy films on ecology I've ever seen, it feels like this generation's answer to the classic short ""The Red Balloon""",1314489600,,1855,4.497023809523809
