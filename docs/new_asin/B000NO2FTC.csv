8179646,4,B000NO2FTC,"If you ever were a competitive wrestler in high school or college... if you are now a high school or college wrestling coach looking for a video to instruct and inspire your wrestlers... if you *are* a wrestler... the performances captured on this 2-DVD set will thrill you.

The championship match in every weight class is shown, with some matches edited one presumes to remove their slower moments.

The camerawork is very good, but overall video and production quality is at best average, which explains the 4-star instead of 5-star rating.",1189728000,2,543,4.956043956043956
