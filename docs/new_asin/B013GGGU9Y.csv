8727583,5,B013GGGU9Y,"Peccadillo Pictures (the folks behind Weekend, I am Divine, and Keep the Lights on) has done another fantastic job showcasing world queer cinema in this Boys on Film installment. Aptly titled Worlds Collide, the stories here are mostly poignant, sometimes painful, but also pensive and passionate. Yes, in much of the world, people still experience homophobia, LGBT persecution, AIDS, and self-hatred. But, there is also that over-empowering human spirit that gives you inner strength to confront not only social demons but personal fears as well. Look within You Must! Yoda might say.
Nine short films in PAL, over 2 hours long, 7 were finalists at the Iris Prize (the annual Intl gay shorts festival in Cardiff), 3 are from US, and 2 are from UK (hard to hear British accent-no subtitles), and one is an animation. My personal favorite, Aban and Khorshid, is based on a true story of two Persian gay soulmates from a decade ago that lived under constant terror (The religiously-barbaric politically-fascistic juggernaut of a regime in Iran continues to terrorize its own citizens to this day). Kudos to Darwin Serink for his directorial debut, and with such a style of cinematography.",1481068800,,1186,5.087179487179487
