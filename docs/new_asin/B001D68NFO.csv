3526185,5,B001D68NFO,"The phrase ""shape up or ship out"" holds a lot of water this season for Lt. Commander Quinton McHale and his fun-lovin' PT 73 crew of goof-offs and gamblers who  were transferred to Italy for the show's final 30 episodes in McHale's Navy - Season Four!

After 3 seasons set on the South Pacific island of Taratupa, ""McHale and his pirates"" are reassigned to duty near the town of Voltafiore where they run afoul the shady Mayor Lugatto (Jay Novello) while continuing to oppose blustery Captain Binghamton and his jittery aide Lt. Carpenter, who are joined this season by Colonel Harrigan (Henry Beckham) and General Bronson (Simon Scott).

Also joining in on Season Four's capers, schemes and hijinks is local Dino Barone (Dick Wilson). As with co-star Tim Conway in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-Three/dp/B0012680AS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season Three</a>, star Ernest Borgnine also gets to pull double duty this season in a [recurring] dual role as Guiseppe, McHale's Italian lookalike cousin in ""Guiseppe McHale"" and ""The Return of Guiseppe"".

Guest stars include Jackie Joseph (The Little Shop of Horrors, Josie and the Pussycats), Pat Harrington Jr. (One Day At a Time, The Inspector) and legendary Don Knotts (The Andy Griffith Show, Three's Company).

3526186,4,B001D68NFO,"Season 4 of McHale's Navy says ""Ciao"" to television. PT 73 makes a big move from the South Pacific to the not-as-warm-waters of the Mediterranean when the vessel gets PCS (permanent change of station) to Italia. While this changes the scenery the crew stays intact.

This is still funny stuff and the team of Borgnine and Conway make this show worth watching. Tim Conway once said he not only considered Ernest Borgnine his mentor but his friend. This is quite evident in the interactions between the two even as characters. There is genuine concern.

McHale's Navy will still be one of those series that will make you smile regardless of which episode might be seen. The writing is good and acting better than most anything else at the time. I wish today's ""comedians"" could take note of how comedy can be. Conway could be clean and still funny.",1471478400,,846,4.70945945945946

Whoever produced these had access to pristine copies of the film this was shot on, and that comes through in the transfers. Clean, good contract and brightness balance and clear details even in distant objects.

I also like that they use thin profile cases so this is only a little more than an inch thick.

AS tot he stories, the move from Tarratupa to Italy wasn't one of the best things they might have done, but the change or scenery gave the show more life. The Italian accents from a few actors can been a bit over the top, but it is all just in good fun.",1447804800,,702,4.3106060606060606

I think I enjoyed the first three seasons much more than I did the last (season four), where McHale and company (including Fuji),  were relocated to Voltafiore, Italy...  I suppose I simply enjoyed the interaction with the crew members in those seasons considerably more than this last season.

For whatever the reason, I simply didn't warm up to the roles of Henry Beckman (as an Army Colonel) or Jay Novello (as the town mayor) in season four and would have been content had everyone simply remained on Taratupa Island... Guess I simply didn't care much for moving everyone to Italy.

I went with only four stars on this season but would definitely give a high five for the other three.  Overall I'm happy with having purchased all four seasons.  No problems whatsoever with playback, video or audio quality.  Shout did a great job.",1425081600,,1108,4.8201058201058204

3526237,3,B001D68NFO,"After three seasons operating out of Taratupa in the Pacific theater, the crew of PT 73 was reassigned to Italy for the final season of McHale's Navy (1965-66).  Relocating the entire cast to the Italian village of Voltafiore, was a big change that gave the program a fresh new look.  Far from the front lines, even more so than in the Pacific, military life in Italy is mostly about profiteering, and the outrageous disregard for military duty.

Under Commander Quinton McHale (Ernest Borgnine), the PT-73 and her crew spend very little time at sea on patrol.  Mostly onshore kicking back, they occupy their spare time in their customary manner, goldbricking and running scams.  As the military governor of Voltafiore, Captain Wallace `Leadbottom' Binghamton (Joe Flynn) and his aide Lt. Elroy Carpenter (Bob Hastings) occupy their time keeping an eye on McHale, and feathering Binghamton's cushy nest.  Hanky panky is the status quo, as the Navy personnel have to contend with crooked government officials, as well as opportunistic Army Colonel Douglas Harrigan (Henry Beckman), who is constantly looking to pilfer whatever he can for personal gain.  More than ever before, the war is just a big joke that no one takes seriously, where the primary activities of US military personnel are to have a good time, and profit from the situation.  Even Japanese prisoner of war Fuji (Yoshio Yoda), has made the journey to Italy.  While there are a few instances where the Allies encounter real German soldiers, more often those in Wehrmacht uniforms are McHale's men in disguise.

Fans of the previous seasons will probably enjoy season four, as almost nothing is directly related fighting the war.  Acquiring military souvenirs, antique furniture, a cache of wine, a fancy bathtub, a golf course, a German staff car, and beachfront property, are just some of the spoils of war up for grabs.  Early on, McHale's crew secures a secret hideout, where they can unwind and store their booty.  There is some fraternization with women, but regular romantic interludes are one of the few things that remains off limits, in this wartime free for all.  Trying to keep McHale and his pirates in line, and also contending with the crooked Colonel Harrigan, keeps Captain Binghamton very busy.  In the role that defined his career, Joe Flynn's talents really shine in this season.  Featuring army personnel, and people from the village, the supporting cast in season four is large, which reduces the screen time of most of the regular cast.  Even McHale and Ensign Parker (Tim Conway) have their roles scaled back a bit.  Notable guest stars include Don Knotts as an army psychologist, Joan Staley as a lovesick WAC, and Maura McGiveney as an ensign that is an expert on navy regulations.

Some sixty years after WW II it may not matter to many, but looking back it seems quite remarkable that less than twenty years after the conclusion of World War II, McHale's Navy would be so readily accepted by the American public.  There was a mystique connected with PT boats, because President Kennedy had served on one, but McHale's Navy makes a mockery of the US Navy in both the Pacific and European theaters.

Beetle Bailey in the comics, the film No Time for Sergeants (1958) and TV's The Phil Silvers Show (1955-59) and Gomer Pyle (1964-69), are part of the post WWII tradition of satirizing military life.  Military men goofing off was certainly nothing new, but McHale's Navy features frontline troops at war, not soldiers training at a base during peacetime.

Image quality of the single-sided five DVD set is pretty flat, just slightly sharper than VHS.  There are no bonus materials, and the episodes are not subtitled.",1307232000,6,3706,4.959546925566343

3526239,3,B001D68NFO,"I think McHale's Navy is a great series! The first three seasons with McHale and the boys in the Pacific are so good, unfortunately, when the stories were relocated to Italy, the show lost a lot. It wasn't just the atmosphere that changed, but the format of the show as well. More of the stories revolved around the people of Volta Fiore and frankly they were uninteresting. McHale and his crew were given less and less to do and the crew became just one character and did a lot of standing around. It is really disappointing that for the last season so much of what worked with the show was removed from it. Tim Conway, Ernest Borgnine, Joe Flynn and Bob Hastings were still excellent and fun to watch, but this season did not live up to the earlier seasons of the show.",1275782400,5,771,4.398601398601398

3526241,5,B001D68NFO,"McHale's Navy has always been one of my favourites since the show was first released on television. It was to return for many years as a 'repeat' however always managed to hold prime time viewing slots in Australia.

This last thirty episodes of the final season sees the PT-73 and crew move to the town of Voltafiore, in Italy. Along with Captain Binghamton, Lieutenant Carpenter and, of course, Fuji, who hides on the 73 boat as it is shipped to its new theatre of operations.

With the shift to the Italian front brings a new cast of characters who enter the McHale-Binghamton conflict; Mayor Mario Lugatto and Colonel Harrigan are the two main adversaries of both McHale and Binghamton and seem to side with whoever is more beneficial to their cause. Colonel Harrigan is always trying to get one over on Captain Binghamton, especially when General Bronson is present. Meanwhile, Mayor Lugatto, has a number of schemes he trys out when the time is seemingly right to pull a fast one on the US Navy. A great episode is the one with guest star Don Knotts, as an Army psychiatrist, who is conned by Captain Binghamton into believing the crew of the 73 are all kooks so they can be shipped out.

The move to Italy was not really explained but was supposed to give the writers new ideas for the show, so the notes to Season Four explain; however it didn't seem quite the same show. Another strange part of this final series was how the show just finished with no real dramatic ending, like the end of the war in Italy, for example...It just stopped with a final episode-'Wally for Congress'.

Despite these shortfalls, I still enjoyed every episode in this final season and commend it to anyone who is a fan of McHale's Navy.

Now, if we can just get the people responsible to put both the movies on DVD, that will see all of our McHale's Navy entertainment on the one format and keep us contented for many hours and many years to come.",1250553600,3,1934,4.545977011494253

3526248,3,B001D68NFO,"""McHale's Navy must be saved!"" was the battle cry that emanated from ABC executives in 1965. ABC was perennially the doormat of network television in the sixties. They had few successful shows & McHale's Navy was one of them. Plummeting ratings for the show (a natural occurrence) had executives in a pensive mood; they had Ernest Borgnine, an Academy Award winner, % they wanted to keep him. So the producers of McHale's Navy decided that changes were necessary in order to bolster ratings.

They decided they would move the entire PT squadron from Taratupa in the Pacific to Voltafiore, Italy. This would allow Borgnine to use his Italian speaking skills also. Even Fuji moved with them as a stowaway which was very lamely explained. Since everyone loved to see Binghamton get it in the end more connivers were added to the cast so that Wally would get it from all ends. Added to the cast were Mayor Mario Lugatto (Jay Novello) & Col. Harrigan (Henry Beckman) who would cause more grief for Binghamton, one from the local population & the other from the U.S.Army. The problem with these additions was that the crew of the PT 73 became less featured & that had to hurt. By mid-season Jay Novello was gone. The producers did retain most, if not all, the writers that penned the scripts. Hollingsworth Morse was brought back to direct all 30 episodes of season 4.

Alas, McHale's Navy could not be saved. How many different ways can you run a con on the same bumbling C.O.? Even Borgnine was given an alter ego for two episodes in which he portrayed his ""twin"" Italian cousin, Giuseppe. It was all to no avail as McHale's Navy sailed away into the sunset of canceled television series. But the good news is, we fans, now have all four seasons of a classic, funny series. Shout Factory has done an excellent job in restoring these episodes so that they can be enjoyed once again by we old fans & show them off to a younger generation who will never experience a more innocent time than we did nor television cluttered with the graphic violence & innuendos (the ""s"" word).",1230336000,14,2069,4.6348773841961854
3526249,5,B001D68NFO,We waited for years to see McHale's Navy again.  It has been such a thrill to see all those famous faces before they were so famous.  This is a great series.  We would recommend it to everyone.,1230336000,5,193,4.162162162162162
3526250,5,B001D68NFO,"While I'm saddened that this will be the last set released of this classic show I'm also glad that we got the entire series, and that it was handled well by Shout! Factory. No editing, no missing episodes, no replaced musical scores, no altering of the original format to ruin the buyer's experience. Just a classic TV show presented here as it originally aired over 40 years ago - the way DVD sets should be done!
This was always my favorite show as a kid growing up and seeing it again after all these years has been alot of fun. It holds up well too. Good nostalgic memories, good laughs, and good clean fun for the whole family. Young and old alike can sit down together and enjoy this show.
As others on here have stated the only disappointment for me was the two McHale's Navy feature films  were not a part of this final set as a bonus feature. I too had hoped they would be. When the entire series is released in one boxed set it would be nice if they could include them as well. Just to make it all complete.
On a more personal note it's nice that Ernest Borgnine, now in his 90's and the oldest living recipient of The Oscar award, has lived to see his show successfully released and preserved for future generations to enjoy. God bless him and Tim Conway and the rest of the crew who've entertained us and made us laugh all these years.",1229904000,21,1347,4.303149606299213
3526251,5,B001D68NFO,"This is one of my all time favorite T.V. shows from the sixties. I remember watching this as a kid. I never missed an episode. Now to see all 4 seasons preserved on DVD is like a dream come true. No matter how many times I watch the shows, I never grow tired of them. I am glad Shout Factory put this timeless show on DVD. My only regret is that the show only had 4 seasons.",1229731200,4,374,3.8701298701298703

But all the characters except Pappy (Gavin MacLeod) survive the trip. Even Fuji! Jay Novello (as the mayor and major conman of the small Italian village) provides another foil, and sometimes ally for the boys and he's very funny.",1476662400,,340,4.779661016949152
