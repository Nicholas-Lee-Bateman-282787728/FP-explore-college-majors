7909965,1,B00000IC85,"When I purchased my DVD player this Bruce Lee film set was one of my first DVD purchases. What a disappointing waste! I am glad this DVD set wasn't my first exposure to Bruce Lee or his films. If it were, I never would have  become as big a fan as I feel that I am. The sound is ludicrous -I mean it  is insulting. The picture quality was so bad that at first viewing, I kept  cleaning my glasses in dis-belief. I simply couldn't watch this #@*`! Don't  waste your money like I did; then again it is your money. And some people  don't believe #@*` stinks until they smell it. If you wish to see these  truly exciting films I would suggest you try some other format or producer  (which ever comes first). I threw this set away -after I vented my  disappointment on it with a pair of scissors.",961372800,5,791,4.157894736842105

7909967,1,B00000IC85,"The sound quality, especially noticable on Chinese Connection, is terrible.  ""Original"" VHS version is much better.  Collectors looking for digital release to add to their collections would be better  served elsewhere.",933465600,6,218,5.967741935483871
