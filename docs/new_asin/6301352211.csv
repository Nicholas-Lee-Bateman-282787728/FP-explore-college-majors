331045,2,6301352211,"Ok...the 80's get a bad rap sometimes. But they were the decade of my youth and it was a great time to be young. A lot of cool music, a lot of good films a real genuine identity to that time.

This movie however is spastically lame. From the opening sequence but you see the skateboarders on the runway at John Wayne Airport you know this film is going to be remarkably stupid. Very much like Point Break with Keanu Reeves this film is so detached from reality that it's insulting to the viewer. Hey, I can appreciate that skate culture has its fans. Especially back then seeing your little niche made into a major film could be exciting. But this film is so stupid it deserves to never be shown again. In addition, the film is terribly out of sync. I guess it just shows even the filmmakers and the studios don't give a rat's patootie about this turkey.

331084,4,6301352211,"Back in the day, Gleaming the Cube and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thrashin/dp/B0007XBKMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thrashin'</a>&nbsp;were the holy grails of skateboarding, hard as it was, at the time, to find movie material on the subject. Christian Slater's heyday was during the late 1980s, early '90s. Gleaming the Cube came out in 1989, a period in time when life was about chilling with your homies, shredding, and perhaps solving a crime and avenging a brother's death. I wouldn't rank this movie as tops in the man's acting r&eacute;sum&eacute;. Not when he's churned out classics or cult classics like Heathers (1988), Pump Up the Volume (1990), True Romance (1993), and my own guilty pleasure, Kuffs (1992). Gleaming the Cube is a good watch, most especially for the skateboardheads. Slater used to do that angsty, alienated, disenfranchised teen role really well.

Accordingly, he plays angry Orange County teen Brian Kelly, and maybe I'll spoiler why he's so persistently angry. Eleven years ago, his parents adopted a Vietnamese boy as Mark's sudden new brother. Thing is, Vinh Xuan Kelly (Art Chudabala) is a hard act to follow. Vinh is polite, helpful, a straight A student - really, the perfect son. And Brian the screw-up couldn't keep up, and, so, cue the resentment and the deep pangs of inadequacy.

Thing is, eleven years later, Vinh and Mark actually get on pretty well. It's his parents that Brian has stayed furious at. So he's rebelled. He's acted out. Brian is a skateboard fiend. He and his crew make a habit of sneaking onto other people's property and skateboarding in empty pools. Relatively speaking, it's a fairly mellow sort of acting out.

Ironically, it's Vinh who lands in hot water. Vinh is a shipping clerk for the Vietnamese Anti-Communist Relief Fund (VACRF), an agency of which stated objective is to send medical supplies to Vietnam. When Vinh notes a discrepancy in the invoices, his good guy instincts kick in and he goes to the boss (whose daughter he's dating, by the way).

If you thought Brian was angry before, imagine his rage when he learns that his brother had checked into a cheap motel room and hung himself. It doesn't take much for him to suspect that Vinh hadn't committed suicide. The rest of the movie tracks Brian's poking around and getting in way over his head.

If I got it right, ""gleaming the cube"" translates to pushing yourself to the edge. It's what Brian does to solve a murder and expose a cover-up. He goes all out. He even morphs into a preppie and dates his brother's girlfriend (Min Luong) just so he could have an in with her super-strict dad, who, if you remember, was Vinh's boss.

Christian Slater and extreme sports don't normally share a sentence. In prepping for the movie, Slater had to learn how to stay on a skateboard. And while the movie does show him coasting along on a skateboard, slo-mo makes it clear that it's a double who steps in to perform the more complex tricks and stunts. Not a big deal. Slater does what he does best, which is rebel on screen and pout and generate that Jack Nicholson cool. Christian Slater in his early days was an arresting presence. No wonder the teenybopper girls swooned over him. Gleaming the Cube features vapid rock & roll music and Steven Bauer as a police detective who dresses like Crockett and Tubbs. And yet it's a must-see for the skateboard society. Movie stars one of its own as he tries his durndest to apprehend a stone-cold killer. I speak, of course, of Tony Hawk who has a bit part as Buddy, one of Brian's skateboarding friends who also works as a pizza delivery guy and drives a red Pizza Hut pickup truck. 3.5 out of 5 stars.",1506297600,,3715,4.879556259904913

Christian Slater was new to being a ""star"" at the time of filming; for Slater fans, this is definitely worth watching to measure his growth as an actor.

I wish the company would re-release this DVD again so that more people can buy it.  C'mon! You get to see Tony Hawke when he was this gangly young teenager!!",1120348800,14,635,3.8091603053435112
331253,5,6301352211,"Ok, so this movie is utter crap...who cares? When I was 9 years old, Christian Slater was quite possibly the coolest person on the planet. Every bit of that coolness came from this movie. When you go back and watch it again you remember how much of a dork you really were with half of your head shaved and the other half covered with partly bleached hair that completely obscured the vision of one eye. God it was great. So complain if you will about the movie lacking plot or any number of other qualities that are so desirable in classic and modern cinema, but this was the 80's preteen guide to all that was cool. If all this wasn't enough, the skaters in THIS movie actually skated...you know...what skaters do sometimes in between destroying cars and jumping off the roof into bushes in the new skate videos.",1118534400,5,813,4.5
331254,3,6301352211,"Still the only ""skateboarding movie"" worth watching, Gleaming the Cube has as many strong points as it has weaknesses.

On one side of the coin, Gleaming the Cube is just filled with late 80s skateboarding, and that's a good thing.  Utilizing Stacey Peralta's as skateboard choreographer and Rodney Mullen and Mike McGill as look-alikes for Slater's character Brian, the skateboarding is truly amazing.  Just as good, the skateboarding begins with the opening scene, and it doesn't end until the credits roll.

On the other side of the coin, however, the plot never really matches the skateboarding used in the film.  I'm no film snob by any measure, but I think that the plot is too linear to capture the viewers attention.  For a PG-13 movie, you wouldn't expect to figure out who the villains of the story are so quickly.  Hence, you wouldn't expect to see Mr. Londale and his minions kill Brian's brother within 30 minutes, wasting the last 60 minutes with police work, phone tag, and other trivial matters.  Meanwhile, you wouldn't expect to hear some ""coming of age"" type of rhetoric that never really works.

Despite the great skateboarding, this movie leaves much to be desired.",1115251200,2,1186,4.919597989949748
331255,1,6301352211,"introduction:

How DO you gleam the cube? some unfamiliar with the skateboarding world might just think it's a technical industry term.  to think this would be incorrect, as no one-- skateboarder or not --knows what gleaming the cube means, even after watching this movie.  the absurdities of this film only begin there.

plot synopsis:

christian slater and professional skateboarding company, et al, skating their way through the underbelly of the san diego vietnamese mafia, trying to avenge the death of slater's adopted vietnamese brother while, by-and-by, slater begins to fall for said deceased brother's girlfriend, whose father is the kingpin, or godfather, of said crime syndicate.

who comes up with this crap?

today:

the success of this movie can only be accredited to the mainstream popularity of ""X-treme sports"" at the time of the film's original release (mid-eighties), and their unprecedented resurgence in the late nineties, failing to mention the decade in between, which, littered with bankruptcy and drugs, skaters and christian slater alike would like to pretend never happened.

advisory:

we suggest you rent it at the video store, then laugh about the stupid movie you watched as a kid, while hanging out really late with your college friends.

331270,3,6301352211,"Not the best skater movie, but it actually has a plot. The skateboarding action is above average. It has both Ramp and flatland tricks. My 13 yr. old Brother loves this movie. Mainly because of the skating. Good performance by C. Slater.",1038614400,,237,4.666666666666667
331271,5,6301352211,"Gleaming the Cube is a great action flick if you're a fan of the typical 80's high flying intense action with weak plots. If you were a skateboarder around the time this film was released like myself, or a skater period. You will uphold this movie with high regard. This movie inspired so many people in the late 80's to start skateboarding. It introduces the intriguing and exciting culture of skateboarding paralleled to an action/mystery plot. The skateboarding scenes were shot well...due to the skateflick cinematography guru, Stacy Peralta. There were plenty of scenes with monumental tricks such as Natas Kaupas's famous ollie into the bed of the pickup truck. If you watch the movie today you can pinpoint certain mistakes that should have been edited. Like the poor stunt double shots ( you can tell that one stunt double is Mike McGill and the other guys on the streets are Rodney Mullen and Natas Kaupas). You also can't even forget about how they tried to actually make us believe that the Mike McGill skateboard and the skinny freestyle board with the same graphic were the same board...yeah right! Also, it's pretty funny, that whenever you see Christian Slater trying to skate he pushes goofy footed mongo. But all of his stunt doubles pushed regular footed. It's funny in a sarcastic sort of way, and its something that we all can identify and find humorous. But that's what makes this movie a classic amongst the skate population. It's something that all of us can immediately relate to. This is a must have for any real skate heads out there. It will immediately cause you to reminisce about a time when skating was genuinely all about having fun.",1030406400,27,1665,4.804878048780488

331274,5,6301352211,"Anyone who wishes to dis this film should remember some things:
RAD, RAD and damn, yeah,... RAD. I am not propping this film with the absolute fact that the other skate-boarding films were an insulting waste of time, NOOOO. This film was no Bergman, but the combination of average to better than average elements such as plot, stunts, FX, and music elevate this film to just shy of cult status. We now have Tony Hawk Playstation games and Thrasher best of videos, but they exist in their own media and genre. This was a FEATURE film.
  Christian Slater is not Laurence Olivier, but he was great in his catagory, the teen-angst poster-boy. His positions in Heathers and True Romance bear this out. This film was a launching pad. Anyway, onto the meat. The final chase scene rivals the big-budget SPEED (1994) just by sheer inventiveness, not to mention the fact that after all the stunts performed, we end up with a nice dose of reality; A shredded skateboard, and C.S. in the hospital. His Concrete barrier velocity ramp off through the air, smack the gun out of the bad guys hand final move gets a Come ONNNN rating of 2 out of 10. Which is good. Highly unlikely, but cinematically well done. And he goes to the hospital. The balance warrants the rating. I love Tony Hawk, but he should have had a little time and a real speaking part. Not the Gratuitous head on shot in the pizza truck. Otherwise, this film has a special place in my stolen milk crate. Via con Dios, Amigos.  The Basher",1005350400,,1488,4.544776119402985

I recently bought this movie for my younger brother because he's into the skating thing and there aren't many movies like this being made.  As I was watching I noticed the acting to be very mediocre but the plot was pretty solid.
The best thing about this movie is the skateboarding celebrities doing a little acting.  Tony Hawk being one of them.  There's a lot of ""old school"" skate tricks going on and just looking at the huge boards they used shows how much stuff has evolved.
Overall I think this will appeal to the younger teen audience.  If you're interested in that genre though, this is a must have classic.",1002585600,4,675,4.411290322580645
