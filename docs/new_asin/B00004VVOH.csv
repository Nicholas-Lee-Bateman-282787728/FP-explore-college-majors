1357676,5,B00004VVOH,"I just received this DVD in the mail and I was so impressed with the  picture quality, I had to write a review.  I have several other DVD's of  older movies that do not come close to the picture clarity that  Voyage/Fantastic do.  I almost expected to see a grainy picture with a few  flakes of snow now and then.  But to see the picture in this clarity is  great.  Not to mention that the movies are two of the best all time  classics.

1358054,4,B00004VVOH,"These two Irwin Allen classics are a great compliment to any collection of sci-fi adventure flicks.  Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea was such a popular film that it spawned at successful 1960s vintage TV show.  The submarine Seaview must race to the southwest Pacific for a missile launch to prevent the earth from being roasted by the burning Van Allen radiation belts.  Walter Pidgeon, Barbara Eden (before Jeannie) and the final film appearance of the great Peter Lorre all compliment this film.  There is lots of gadgetry and underwater scenery, but a glaring scientific error: the burning Van Allen belts cause the polar ice caps to melt, and the Seaview is struck by the sinking chunks of ice...except that ice doesn't sink; it floats!  Look for actor Howard McNear, (Mayberry's Floyd the barber) as a visiting congressman early in the movie.

Fantastic Voyage is another wild sci-fi ride, this time through INNER space.  A defecting eastern bloc scientist with the secret for miniaturization in his head is nearly assassinated, and a medical team must be shrunk down to microscopic size to operate to save his life.  Stephen Boyd (Roman tribune Messala from ""Ben Hur"") is the hero who must both keep the mission on track, and find out who is sabotaging it.  Donald Pleasance and Raquel Welch are on the team as well.  This novel idea for an ""inner space"" adventure gave filmmakers a great chance to show the imagined workings of the body, up close and personal.  The heart stopping (literally) scene when the Proteus (the miniaturized sub) goes through the patient's heart is particularly suspenseful.  Gear heads will notice a very minor continuity glitch at the beginning of the film; Boyd's character is being driven to the secret lab/hospital where the operation will take place.  At first, he's riding in a mid-60s Lincoln Continental; when he arrives, he steps out of a Chrysler Imperial...oops.  Isaac Asimov wrote the paper back book based on the screenplay, but since the book was released before the film, many think the original idea was Asimov's; it wasn't.  These two films are a great addition to any sci-fi fan's collection.",1363910400,8,2146,4.938718662952646

1358162,5,B00004VVOH,"Irwin Allen may never be recognized as one of the USA's greatest film directors a la Kazan, Welles, Stevens, Coppola, or Kubrick, but he has given us some fine and truly imaginative science fiction over the 60's-70's.  ""Fantastic Voyage"" is a case in point.

A trip thru ""inner-space""--the human body--this film's premise, although strictly fantasy, was an absorbing and fascinating glimpse into the the true potential of science fiction.  Despite these limitations, and the lack of drama to sustain a viable narrative, one reponds to ""Fantastic Voyage"" both visually and aesthetically.

While the plot is rather thin and somewhat silly, reflecting the era's cold war overtones, the film works magnificently on a purely visual level with special effects that are convincing and awe-inspiring.  Richard Fleischer, a well-established director for TV at the time, bathed the sets with pulsating and multi-colored lights, giving the giant reproductions of the heart, lungs, and brain a greater sense of reality, fluidity, and movement.

As a production note, MD's inspected the sets and were consultants during the filming of the picture.  Perhaps the most impressive set was that of the human heart--40 by 30 feet--with the actors suspended by ""invisible wires"" as they make their journey thru the human body.
As for ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea,"" lacking both the imagination and the creativity of the former, was the inspiration for the long-running series starring Richard Basehart and David Hedison.  Walter Pidgeon offers a commanding presence in the film, Frankie Avalon sings, and supporting actors (including a young and lovely Barbara Eden)also manage to keep the plot moving along nicely.

Despite a wordy and rather mundane script, there is enough action to sustain most audiences. Like in ""Fantastic Voyage,"" the special effects--especially the $400,000 (yes, it was that expensive!) model of the submarine Seaview--are both noteworthy and impressive.",1155340800,2,1964,5.413114754098361
1358163,5,B00004VVOH,"Fantastic Voyage and Voyage To The Bottom of the Sea are two masterpieces of early science fiction that are just full of adventure and excitement; the kind of movies that you would sit down with your popcorn and happily kill a Saturday afternoon with.

I was especially impressed with the Fantastic Voyage. Younger folks would now consider the special effects of this movie to be ""cheesey"" but for 1968 they were cutting edge and you can see the influence they had in other movies of that era such as the Andromeda Strain and the Forbin Project. Whereas Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea was another one of Irwin Allen's great creations loaded with action and suspense; from the movie later came the TV show and you can easily see why the television show is almost unchanged from the movie; only the lead actors are different becuse you can't improve on perfection.

I only wonder why do they always have to have such great movies in the letterbox format for DVDs. They don't do it to the videotape versions, so why do it here?",1149552000,2,1025,4.565217391304348
1358164,5,B00004VVOH,"When it was released, most viewers found Fantastic Voyage, written by Isaac Asimov, compelling and visionary. In retrospect, I don't think the sets hold up very well. So why the five stars? What does hold up very well is the pilot film of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (here packaged with FV on a double sided disc). It's beautifully filmed in '60s Technicolor (which is basically four color), with wonderful lighting and sets (later used in the VTBOS series). Barbara Eden is excellent as the nurse. Walter Pidgeon is memorable in the role although I very much liked the TV show's personnel roster. Often dismissed, I find this film eminently watchable and a wonderful example of '60s sci-fi fare.",1139011200,3,700,4.793388429752066

1358258,5,B00004VVOH,"The difference?  They may have looked fake, but you knew they were real-ie: had mass-they were models of varying sizes;-todays CGI often looks 'fake' ie: too perfect- and you know whatever being shown only exists on a hard drive!

Would YOU put up with a CGI USS Enterprise?-I think not.

No, LB Abbott was THE MAN at 20th Fox in the day-if he was given a good budget.

I love the shots of the larger, detailed Seaview-it was 20 feet long-and SUPER detailed-though some of the bubbles trailing after the smaller models gtve the scale away-today they would have used condensed milk to stand in for massive small bubbles/foam for prop-wash..

---

I still think FANTASTIC VOYAGE stands out over much of todays SPFX-and the design of the Proteus is divine;

One glaring error of continuity-in the novel, the crew COAXED the antibodies containing the wreckage to follow them out through the eye, where, while still small, were put on the floor of the chamber to grow-

in the film, they simply ASSUME that the antibodies have digested it, and thus it is of no danger to Benes.

NOT SO-

even if it were ground to jelly, that blob of jelly would have grown, after 60 minutes-to the size of the former sub inside or outside of Benes-thus killing him (Death by exploding internal sub wreckage!)",1115596800,,1287,4.654867256637168
1358259,3,B00004VVOH,"Just a correction to a common misconception repeated in the review by orionca-- Isaac Asimov's book version of FANTASTIC VOYAGE was based on the movie screenplay, not vice versa.",1100736000,2,178,5.172413793103448
1358260,4,B00004VVOH,"Many people will vigorously disagree with this review. For one thing, the special effects ARE dated. There are some places where it is painfully obvious that the ""Proteus"" is on a set rather than  in a human body. Stephen  Boyd (who made such a dynamic villain in ""Ben Hur"") is extremely bland and Raquel Welch's acting leaves much to be desired. (She is supposed to be a laser expert, but on screen it seems the only reason that she is on the sub at all is to be a ""damsel in distress"".) Furthermore, there are plot holes bigger than the ""Proteus"" if you actually think hard enough. Even if a spoiler development (which I will not reveal) does not take place at the very end, the reader may wonder what happens to the huge amount of water that is miniaturized and injected into the comotose Jan Benes' body. The fact that the story in this film has become a clich and repeated in many different versions (most notably on the Simpsons) hasn't helped. I can't blame anybody for rating this film 3 stars or lower.

And yet....and yet...this film still works. It's a terrific story idea, and director Richard Fleischer does a very good job of maintaining the tension. Even if Welch and Boyd leave much to be desired as actors, Donald Pleasance does a terrific job as the blood expert who acts as navigator. Edmund O'Brien (best known as the doomed protagonist of the original ""D.O.A."") is very good as the general in charge of the operation. And while the special effects in some places look cheesy, in others it is still breathtakingly gorgeous. (The credit to this has much to do with the terrific matte paintings used as backgrounds.) I would recommend watching the movie before reading Isaac Asimov's famous novelization of the script. Asimov's book (which I have also reviewed) takes liberties with the screenplay, and makes a more exciting story than the film. I hope that one day somebody at 20th Century Fox decides to remake this film and use Asimov's book as the starting point for a much smarter movie. But for anybody else who still can remember seeing this film on TV as a young kid and being amazed, this DVD is more than worth the price at Amazon.com

Incidentally, I did not buy this film for ""Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea"" and have not watched that at all. If you want to see what type of movie that is, please read the other reviews.",1100390400,,2351,4.550827423167848
1358261,5,B00004VVOH,"The screenplay for VTTBS was redone in the TV series, and a little better IMHO, and Issac Asimov was a little upset that the screen writers didn't follow the story he wrote for the book more closely.  Still, no SF DVD set is complete without these two classics from the '60s.",1097539200,2,275,4.392156862745098

They are sent through the blood current and they will have to minimize and destroy a serious damage in the brain of an eminent personality.
This film sooner or later will be remade . I don't have any doubt about.
But the challenge to win this original film is hard to reach. The script , the dramatic tension along this tour de force , the amazing inside locations around the lungs , heart brain and optycal nervous are first rate! plus the incredible cast: Artur O Donell , Edmund O'brien , Stephen Boyd , Donald Pleasence and the unforgettable and seductive beauty Raquel Welch give this film of Richard Fleisher two thumbs up about the top ten gem sci fi pictures , because he would make five years after Soylent Green another must in your collection.

1358263,5,B00004VVOH,"Let's give this movie the props it deserves. Considering the fact that the SPFX were done over 40 years ago, they are still very impressive. No CGI back then- 4 different sized Seaview models had to be used! L.B. Abbott did wonders with them, and they still look cool! The plot- ok, Irwin Allen always stretched scientific credibility, and characterization was never his strongpoint.

1358265,4,B00004VVOH,"If you grew up during the early '60's and were fascinated by the real-life adventure and technology of the time you will find this film interesting.  Most remarkable is the focus on both the use of the new atomic submarine and the newly discovered Van Allen radiation belt.  Most modern viewers don't seem to know that the press of the time was abuzz with articles about the Van Allen belt of radiation, the high altitude nuclear testing we were conducting, known as shots Teak and Orange (to find a way to impede a Soviet missile attack) and the effect of this naturally occuring band of radioactivity on the man in space.  There were unjustified and now disproved fears that a nuclear shot might  affect the belt, hence the plot line about it ""catching fire"" and hurting the earth.  These were real news items of the time and I have heard tapes of Kennedy discussing such with scientists at the White House.  The Navy declined to help or make comment about the design of the Seaview for national security reasons, which means they took it seriously.  It is unique as a commissioned research vessel (the glass nose) and a missle platform (SSBN).  Of course the interiors could have been more realistic and we all know the deficiencies there, but if you've ever seen inside a real sub you will understand why Seaview was made to look so big!  The cast was of the best, though Lorre looked ill.  The movie was no doubt created with a view toward becoming a commercially feasible TV series, which explains many of the deficiencies fans nit-pick.  The design of this Seaview always pleases me more than the later TV version (the design is more balanced).  Sub officers tell me that they can make the boat pop up out of the water like it does in the opening credits, but they catch hell if they do because everything  goes flying off the tables etc..Remember too, that the Nautilus had only just sailed across the top of the world under the ice, which was a remarkable feat of which we were all very proud.  It was only fitting, and very realistic, that Seaview do the same thing!  Voyage and it's Seaview help us all remember the courage and dedication of the men who patrol the seas in boats as incredible as the ficticious one.  Veterans tell me that it was our nuclear missile boats (not unlike Seaview), undetectable and vigilant, which contributed MOST to the collapse of Communist Russia, not the Star-Wars program.  In the film, Seaview carries the (then) new Polaris missile which you will see a real launch of.  I would not, however want to be next to the hatch when it is shot.  They are fired by steam catapult and the rocket does not ignite until it clears the surface, so you might become an instant boiled lobster if you tried to do what Captain Crane did!  Fantastic Voyage offers us an equally pleasing vessel, very realistic and sadly destroyed by future owners in making it into a different prop.  I'm sure you will enjoy both of these films and encourage you to explore the science which they focused on in those years.
I am both a film maker and a volunteer First Responder for Nuclear Civil Defense, allowing my viewpoint to cover both areas in the film Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.",1073520000,7,3204,4.576182136602452
1358266,5,B00004VVOH,"Irwin Allen (Poseiden Adventure / Towering Inferno) was definitely one of the most over-the-top directors ever. His ability to turn horrible disasters into movie gold was unrivaled. VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA is his most exhaustive effort. Admiral Nelson (Walter Pidgeon) and the rest of the crew of the ultra-mod submarine ""Seaview"", are called upon to save the world after the ""Van Alan"" radiation belt catches fire. On their way to launch a missile into the flaming belt, they must battle the UN, sabotage, a religious nut, underwater mines, an enemy sub, a giant squid, a giant octopus, and the clock. All this and we get to see Barbara Eden dance too! Throw in Peter Lorre and Franky Avalon, and you've got quite a popcorn fiesta! FANTASTIC VOYAGE is about a tiny submarine and it's crew of scientists who are miniaturized to the size of microbes, in order to perform a delicate brain operation. There's lots of cold war paranoia to go around too. The man they're trying to save is a famous scientist whose secrets (about the very miniaturization process itself) could either help us, or the ""other side"". After a rather long shrinking sequence, our team of aquanauts are finally injected into the man's bloodstream and the fun begins! They are immediately introduced to glowing, bubbly blood cells that make it look like they've accidently wandered into a lava lamp. Our heroes must race against time and navigate the labyrinth within their host. Can they save his life? Or will time run out, causing them to grow back to normal size? Donald Pleasance is excellent as the claustrophobic head of the mission. Racquel Welch is not in it enough in my opinion, as she would be the only reason I'd get in the sub in the first place!

1358267,5,B00004VVOH,"A bit of a mixed bag here. Both movies have Cold War overtones.  Fantastic Voyage is a good yarn.  Though full of plot holes (how many SciFi movies aren't?) it's fun to think ""what if?""  The
FX are quite good for the late 60's.  Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea is a bit more realistic perhaps, but less entertaining.",1049673600,,316,4.216666666666667
1358345,3,B00004VVOH,"As is often the case with double-feature DVDs, there is usually one decent movie and one lousy one, the B-side being a movie which probably would not sell well on its own.  In this case, Fantastic Voyage is the good movie and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea the weak flip side.
In Fantastic Voyage, several people are reduced to cellular size to heal a man from the inside.  The science may be flimsy (Isaac Asimov had enough problems with the ending to rewrite it in his novelization), but the tale itself is good and the special effects are nice.  The human body comes off as a surrealistic dreamworld, far from reality but neat to look at.
Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, however, is a seriously flawed movie.  The science is below par even for a movie like this (in one scene, we see ice sinking in water!), and the story and characters are nothing very spectacular either.  Even the effects are not very great, although there are a couple scenes that do look nice.
Fantastic Voyage is a four star flick, VTTBOTS just two stars.  As a pair of movies, this is okay, but if you only watch the former film, you will still get your money's worth.",1048896000,11,1147,4.386792452830188
1358346,5,B00004VVOH,"If you love sci-fi even a little bit, and especially if you came of age in the 60's and 70's, how could you possibly go wrong getting both of these movies in widescreen format for the price of a few espresso beverages?
Sure, the science is nutty, and the effects are dated, but it's about being entertained!  The effects are enjoyable and pleasing in their own retro kind of way.
My one complaint regarding ""Voyage..."" is that there is no ambient ""ship noise"", like the deep, barely perceptable humming of engines.  That would have made it seem much more like a submarine than a bunch of sets.
To me, the greating single reason to watch ""Voyage.."" is to see Walter Pidgeon play a character so very similar to the mad scientist he played on Forbidden Planet.  This time he's a ""mad admiral"", and he drives most everyone else mad too.
And that's only half the DVD!  You also get Fantastic Voyage.  I remember when this movie was first released.  It made quite an impact, and it spawned a Saturday morning animated series of the same name that was one of my favorite morning cartoons.
This DVD has more ""bang for the buck"" than most any other single DVD I know of.",1046995200,2,1161,4.478672985781991
1358347,4,B00004VVOH,"First you must remember both of these productions were done 40 years ago when SCI FI was far less special effects driven. The average computer was some huge iron main frame monstrosity hidden in frigid cold back rooms of insurance companies, fortune 500 companies or government offices. The was no CGI for sure. Also the average person was not as sophisticated regards science as most people growing up now. In the early to mid 1960's a few florescent tubes casting a red glow that slid into an impressive looking stainless steel or chrome wall panel was all that was needed to create a proper hollywood nuclear reactor. Anything with a point on it could become a laser gun. Raw Electrical sparks usually blue made for a great weapon. Spash liberal doses of red paint around and make lots of beams with holes in them as structural supports. Place lots of shiny metal about. Finally last but not least lights scads and scads of lights blinking flashing changing color and hue and position everywhere everywhere to accompany lots of sound and motion. The best reactors or atmosphere management devices in sci fi had movement along with lights and sounds.. Load of on sparklers to enhance the danger factor when electical explosions are needed and you had all the makings of a pretty good 60's sci fi show or movie. Remember in the 1960's the computer power used to land men on the moon you could likely find in a cheap watch today.

Also today many people know enough about basic science to be harder to fool than we were growing up with Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea and Fantastic Voyage. We had no internet and computers in our home. Growing up in the 1960's most peoples idea of technological wonder was self service elevators where the numbers lit up because of the heat of your finger like MAGIC.

All that said when you look at Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea yoou must remember when it was made IF you want to be fair. If you look at Fantastic Voyage you must remember that it dared take kids into the human body to show and explain all its wonders as if they were actually there. I was a kid at the time and I remember being totally amazed by what I saw represented in the movie when the ship was placed inside a living body. In the case of Fantastic Voyage the film was won an Oscar for its visual effects (by Art Cruikschank). In their time the effects that gave life to Fantastic Voyage was state of the art. In the case of Fantastic Voyage they obviously cared as all the doctors that consulted in the making of the movie shows they wanted to protray the bodies functioning correctly. Fantastic Voyage was a daring awesome accomplishment that I feel stimulated many 1960's kids to become scientist's.

TV experiences can have a profoundly positive impact on children and adults. I am a black man. I remember way back in the 1960's ""The Olden Days according to my neices"", when their were painfully few positive black male role models on TV a Star Trek episode called, ""The Ultimate Computer showcased the M-5 Multi-Tronic Unit and the proud if flawed black man Richard Daystrom who created it. Yes Richard Daystrom was portrayed as a flawed Genius but he planted within me the idea that black people could have within them creative genius with computers and other things. In time Star Trek built on and embellished the Daystrom Thread in future storylines naming a fictional institute in his honor. I know these seem like little things but sometimes good little things are seeds that grow into awesome rewards for all society. Richard Daystrom a fictional character on Star Trek was enough to encourage me to develop an interest in computer science and enter computer career.

Sure by today's standards is Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea with its rubber monsters inaccurate science and slow plots are looking plenty weak next to Star Wars for example you betcha. Are what were state of the art oscar caliber special effects in 1960's era Fantastic Voyage movie stuff a computer imaging geek like me could out do on my home computer today with the right software yes indeedy.

Note however the enduring power of these movies is not in their special effects, their true power dwells in an ability to awaken the imagination of a child to the wonders of science while offering them a laugh in the process. The dumbest most inane things can sometimes spur the furtile imagination to unknown heights of greatness. The core message of these movies is that human kind live in eternal hope and our science is the tool we use with great effect to bring the best things hoped for into our reality. Who knows maybe a kid watching Fantastic Voyage today will be so inspired by his peek revealing how the human body works that in adulthood he will be inspired to cure some deadly disease or watching Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea will inspire another person to address some huge marine challege we face on Earth.

Yes the movies are old the special effects are tired but maybe I am stupid because I still see the message of boundless hope humanity placed in these movies when they were crafted and it burns as bright today as it did 40 or so years ago when I was not a the old gray Wolf I am today. I look at these movies and still see them with the childlike eyes of wonder I had as a wee cub. ""smiles"" Buy these DVD's to share humanities legacy of hope with a new generation who knows what good they might inspire in our future. I live in hope which is why I brought this DVD and hope you do likewise.",1040342400,3,5503,4.531187122736418
1358348,3,B00004VVOH,"I suppose you could contrast one as trash vs. treasure. This double bill features Irwin Allen's version of science fiction. The story is suspensful if you're 8-12 years old but most folks would recognize the story is improable. Voyage has more in common with Star Wars than with science fiction.
The effects work by L. B. Abbott are standard for the time. The most difficult part about working water is that you can't miniaturize water droplets. The cast isn't really given a heck of a lot to do. Again,if you've seen Lost in Space or even the television series of Voyage (which I thought was better--it had no pretentions about being anything other than a 60's version of the serials).
Fantastic Voyage is another matter. Although far from flawless, it has a cold war era story that's memorable. It's a melding of James Bond and sf. There are story flaws (although the oxygen molecules in the ship were miniaturized with the sub, those coming from the patient's lungs would be too large for them to breath)and the characters aren't very well developed, but it's a fun journey. The effects (again by L. B. Abbott and his crew)are more effective because we're dealing with a ""landscape"" we've never seen from a bacteria's point of view.
There aren't any extras to speak of but this is a fun double feature. One person's trash is another person's treasure. In this case you get both for the price of one. Voyage is trashy fun while Fantastic is a fairly well constructed piece of 60's science fiction. Although not as well written as Planet of the Apes (which would follow two years later), 2001 or even Soylent Green, FV is still fun.

1358349,4,B00004VVOH,"This DVD contains two science fiction adventures from the 60""s. One is a true classic, and the other is perhaps more significant for the TV series it spawned.
Fantastic Voyage (1966) (4 Stars)

Fantastic Voyage is well-done science fiction of high caliber. Even today, over thirty years later, the Academy Award winning special effects stand up reasonably well. Couple this, with an original story, and a tight screenplay, and you have the elements in place for a top-notch adventure. The cast is also excellent, headed by the underrated Steven Boyd, and also featuring the distinguished Donald Pleasance, Arthur Kennedy, Raquel Welch, Edmond O'Brien and Arthur O'Connor.
Like many adventures of the time, this one has a Cold War connection. Benes, a scientist has been injured in an attempt on his life by the other side. With a blood clot located in an inoperable part of his brain, Benes is doomed, unless extreme measures are taken. Enter the Combined Military Deterrent Forces (CMDF), a top-secret government agency.
The mission involves the miniaturization of a small nuclear powered sub (the Proteus), that will then be injected into the Benes's body. The team of five, will then proceed to the site of the clot, and dissolve it, using a laser gun. The miniaturization process lasts only for an hour, after which the sub and crew will begin to return to normal size. Sounds completely impossible? Maybe so, but the presentation is most compelling. After witnessing the miniaturization, and entry of the Proteus, via injection into the victim's neck, most viewers are right there with the crew, engrossed in the marvels of the human body.
A chain of events, both accidental and deliberate, makes the journey to the brain, a most exciting and circuitous one. The ""detours"" provide opportunities to view various systems and organs within the body, which include the lungs, heart, ear and lymphatic system. The time factor goes from comfortable, to critical, as the crew, which initially had ample time to accomplish their mission, find themselves up against the one-hour deadline, after experiencing various delays. The sets and special effects, are still impressive even after all this time, partly because there have not been many films in the subsequent years, covering similar subject matter. Among the most interesting of the phenomena shown, are the oxygenation of blood cells, antibodies attacking, and the interior of the lungs. With their time almost up, the Proteus finally reaches the clot. The crew accomplishes their mission, and manages to escape from the body just in time, via the optic nerve, and out through the eye.
Fantastic Voyage is a classic, and will remain so for the foreseeable future. With ""remake fever"" being prevalent, and with modern special effects available, one would think that it would have been at least a candidate for ""updating"". Should it ever come to pass, let us hope that the filmmakers are able to capture even half of the wonder of this fine film. Later, Isaac Asimov would novelize the movie, and a cartoon based on the film was also produced.
Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1960) (2 Stars)
On to the second feature, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. Many may be more familiar with the TV series of the same name, which producer Irwin Allen later brought to the small screen. The movie introduces the nuclear submarine ""Seaview"", the brainchild of Admiral Nelson (Walter Pidegon), commanded by Captain Crane (Robert Sterling). The first nuclear subs were a ""big deal"" because of their ability to remain underwater for extended periods of time. Difficult to detect, they could be very effective at various types of covert operations. A crucial piece, in the global Cold War chess game. The Seaview, with its flared nose, headlight, body fins and observation windows, was one neat looking craft. In the 60's, many toys and models were based on this famous sub. As would later develop in the TV series, the Seaview became almost like another character.
Unfortunately, the big screen version of ""Voyage"", is just not very good. The plot is silly, and the ""science"" is mostly fiction. The characters are not compelling at all, and no matter what gimmick is attempted, there is little or no real suspense. The newly commissioned Seaview, is cruising underwater in arctic waters, when the sub encounters falling ice. Upon surfacing, the crew discovers that the sky is glowing red. The cause, the Van Allen belt is on ""fire"", causing the Earth's temperature to rise, and melting the polar ice cap. From this ridiculous premise, things only get worse. Admiral Nelson heads to New York, for a meeting at the United Nations. He presents a plan to put out the fire, by firing missiles into the Van Allen belt, from a location in the South Pacific. Unable to convince the world's leaders he is right, he orders the Seaview to set off for the Marianas.
Radio communication no longer functions, and Nelson can't contact Washington for approval of his scheme. With a long journey ahead, the sub proceeds at full speed, as internal conflict and unrest fester within his crew. Irwin Allen pulls out all the stops, in an attempt to create tension and excitement. These include arson, an underwater mine field, sabotage, a giant squid, threat of mutiny, shark attack, forcible removal from command, torpedo attack, a giant octopus, implosion due to extreme depth, and religious fanaticism. All that commotion, and the story is still flat, with an ending that is pitifully weak.
The screenplay is bad, and relying on special effects is not enough. The concept and the presentation of the Seaview is strong, but the others effects are not impressive at all. The cast muddles through, and no one really impresses. Walter Pidgeon makes a weak Admiral, inspiring his men to mutiny. Robert Sterling, as Captain Crane, is not much better. Could you imagine the TV series starring these same actors? Peter Lorre is also in the film, but has almost nothing to do. Barbara Eden and Joan Fontaine seem to be on board just to keep it from being an all-male cast. Except for providing the source material for the TV series, the movie has very little to recommend it. If you buy this DVD, get it for mainly for Fantastic Voyage and not the disappointing Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.",1029024000,,6304,4.941564561734213
1358350,5,B00004VVOH,"This double feature works both ends of the Sci-fi spectrum, from the overly simplified but eyecatching special effects of Irwin Allen's ""Voyage"" to the more sophisticated storytelling of ""Fantastic"".

1358351,3,B00004VVOH,"""Come with me on a voyage to the bottom of the sea"". I declined the offer, on the grounds that the Lotharian singing suggested an expection of one's swimming trunks being removed on the way down. I try to rule that sort of thing out of my life, I don't know about you. Elsewhere, a shark in a pool exudes all the menace of a floating grey toothbrush in a sink full of water. This excludes those with a phobia of floating toothbrushes in which case I apologise for any distress caused by inadvertent exposure to this review.
As for the sister feature, any voyage for a bright young lady in which she is expected to put up with the culinary enquiries of a borish sexist, can hardly be described as 'fantastic', even if travelling in a sub by it's very nature precludes any dipping in of oars.
In one amusing shot, we see two military generals lighting up and puffing cigars behind a scientist who is engaged in delivering what must have been a less than edifying lecture on personal shrinkage. One assumes the alarming lack of concern over the consequences of their actions may be due to the expectation that a subsequent crew will be injected into their chest to burn away any cancer cells. The flaw they may have overlooked is whether or not the government would be willing to fund such a mission, seeing as it is a result of personal irresponsibility, as opposed to the exigencies of foreign intervention. Your military types are expendable, you know. But I digress (and somewhat verbosely too, I might add.)
The film has some philosophical moments. There are some big bits in the universe and some little bits and if you happen to grasp that fact at any given moment, especially while floating in a submarine around someone's blood stream, then it can be, in the parlance of the sixties, 'far out, man'. Or far in, if one wishes to be pedantic. Or wearing a kaftan. Mysteriously, there are suggestions that a soul may inhabit the human body and that it is green and fuzzy. It goes in endless circles around roads doing nothing in particular. Just like the bodies it inhabits, then.",1021334400,,2083,4.572192513368984

Fantastic Voyage rates a solid 5 stars for its imagination and spectacle, and also for a story that I found absolutely riveting after a couple hits. My only slam is that you could occasionally see the wires in plain view in some of the miniature shots -- but hey, this was the Sixties! On the flip-side (literally), Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea was so intellectually insulting that even my kids wouldn't watch it after the first few minutes.

1358353,5,B00004VVOH,"This is my favourite movie, so do not expect me to write an unbiassed review: Ernest Laszlo's CinemaScope cinematography is simply breathtaking; each single take is beautifully composed. Leonard Rosenman's atonal yet harmonic score featuring countless variations of the four-note leitmotiv (the ""Proteus""-theme) is definitely one of the best film scores ever written and - moreover - an excellent example of modern orchestra music (I listen to it least once a day). The DVD picture transfer is gorgeous and a vast improvement over that fuzzy (though letterboxed)laserdisc. The anamorphically encoded picture makes full use of any widescreen TV set. The ""newly created surround track"" is nice, with beautiful separations especially during the airfield scene. And yet the DVD contains at least two major flaws having to be mentioned: 1. The title card is incorrect; the filmmakers' reference to the ""many doctors and scientists whose knowledge and insight helped guide this production"" has to appear at the end of the movie. The correct title card following the Fox logo reads: ""This film will take you where no man has gone before. No eyewitness has actually seen what you are about to see. But in this world of ours where going to the moon will soon be upon us and where the most incredible things are happening all around us, someday, perhaps tomorrow, the fantastic events you are about to see can and will take place."" 2. Watch the scene from 85:49 to 86:26 with the sub travelling through the subarachnoid cavity. The background is red and in the middle of that dramatic scene the color turns blue (or green). This flaw is apparent in some of the movies prints obviously due to careless treatment during the printig process; the entire scene is meant to be tinted blue (or green). The laserdisc, though technically far inferior, presented correct title card and green tinted scene; I wonder why Fox used a different print for the DVD release.",998438400,,1946,5.0092592592592595
