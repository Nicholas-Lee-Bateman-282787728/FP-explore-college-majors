8234917,5,B000Z6GT7C,"3 films, 3 dvds, and 3 discs. From Shriek Show/Media Blasters comes a delightful box set of madness. The box set includes, Cop Killers (1973), Don't Go In the House (1980), and Tenement (1985).

Cop Killers (1973):

Plot-Two  brothers are trying to smuggle drugs across the border. One is crazier than the other, and in their path-a trail of blood.

My Thoughts- Delightfully mad and a little cheesy. Cop Killers is a terrific crime-drama that dwells slightly into horror and action as well. It's gritty, sleazy, yet cool like the 70s. Check it out.

Fun Facts- Producer Bill Osco would later work on films such as The Being (1983), and Blood Diner (1987). The effects were done by Rick Baker.

Don't Go in the House (1980)

Plot- Abused by his mother, who'd punish him by burning his arms. The young man struggles to retain his sanity, but is closer to the edge.

My Thoughts- This is my personal favorite of the collection. It's a character study, and remains to be both dramatic, and ""scary"". The film contains atmosphere and dread all throughout. The film retains an abundance of creepiness, and an eerie mood all throughout its running time. It's gritty, dark, and relentless, a must see for slasher/horror fans.

Fun Facts- Dan Grimaldi would later star on the Sopranos. The film was Selected by Quentin Tarantino for the First Quentin Tarantino Film Fest in Austin, Texas, 1996. Dan Grimaldi kept the asbestos suit he wears in the movie. The film's original soundtrack turned out to be unusable, having been recorded on what actor Dan Grimaldi termed ""less than up-to-date equipment"". The soundtrack, in its entirety, had to be re-recorded and re-dubbed. The actresses who played the burns victims were dancers chosen because they were the same height as the actresses playing the victims, but significantly slimmer in build. This is because when the human body is subjected to burns, it shrinks due to a loss of fluid. Star Dan Grimaldi didn't have to audition for the part of Donny Kohler. At the time, he was the lead in an Off Broadway play titled ""Mama's Little Angels"". The director and producers came to see it several times and ended up asking him if he was interested in doing their picture.

Tenement:

Plot- A gang of thugs plot revenge by taking hold of a tenement, and attacking its inhabitants.

My Thoughts- Tenement was okay, it was my least favorite of the 3. I can't say it's a must see for everybody, but it is a must see for exploitation fans.

DVD/DISC CONTENT:

Cop Killers- Jason Williams interview, Audio commentary, image gallery, original trailer, & Shriek Show trailers.

Don't Go in the House- Dan Grimaldi interview, audio commentary, promo gallery, trailers, and shriek show trailers.

8234918,5,B000Z6GT7C,"I've not watched Cop Killers (I didn't get this set for that film), but both Don't Go in the House and Tenement are fantastic. Don't Go in the House is more well-known, and by no means obscure, but I've never heard of Tenement before I bought this. When I first watched it, it seemed an average film to me. After multiple viewings, though, I really happen to dig it.

All three films are in good quality - decent extras, and it's well-worth the price. For any horror fan, I would recommend this.",1406505600,,495,4.380434782608695
