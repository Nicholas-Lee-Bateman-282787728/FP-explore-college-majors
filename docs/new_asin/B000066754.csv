7961704,4,B000066754,"The director and cast of ""7 Grandmasters"" try and tackle Drunken Boxing in this amazingly dumb, yet dumbly amazing movie.  The film begins with a voice-over prologue that sees Simon Yuen practicing on the beach as Beggar Su, the character he made famous in ""Drunken Master"".  Then, off he goes, never to be seen again.

After some pretty sweet opening credits, we forward to Jack Long as Fan Ta Pei, and a couple of challengers for HIS drunken style.  Then, in a flashback that takes up the bulk of the film's length:  Fan Ta Pei (Mr. Long again, sans beard) is a young hooligan, in cahoots with Li Yi Min as the young Beggar Su.  They get into some trouble, and somehow end up learning the drunken style from some cool dude that beats people up with his pipe; then both of the young men fall for the master's niece.  Then we forward again to their reunion, a revelation, and the finale, featuring Mark ""Ghostface Killer"" Long.

Now for the one thing I neglected to mention in the previous paragraph...  the fights:  There are lots of 'em.  LOTS of 'em.  They start well and keep getting better. I debated on the rating, because it's so silly, but I really enjoyed watching this.  With this many fights at this high a level, some great acrobatics and sound-effects, it's an old-school fan's dream.

Part of Ground Zero's ""Eastern Heroes"" collection, the full-screen presentation is a bit of a disappointment, but it doesn't lose a lot of picture, and the quality is quite good for not being remastered.  Night shots leave something to be desired, but there's not a lot of them.  All in all, I'd have to recommend it.  In fact, I can't wait to watch it again.  English dubbed.

7961706,5,B000066754,"The cast of The Mystery Of Chess Boxing and Seven Grandmasters (Jack Long, Lee Yi Min, Mark Long) returns for another great non-stop kung fu flick.  If you have seen the two previously mentioned films then you know that this movie will be nothing short of awesome.  It is one fight after the next displaying many different styles, but mostly the mastery of drunken boxing.  It also ranks side by side with both of Yuen Woo Ping's films, Drunken Master and Dance of the Drunk Mantis.  Briefly, the story is of the northern and southern masters of drunken boxing, Beggar Su(Lee Yi Min) and Fan Ta Pei(Jack Long), being reunited after 30 years and recalling their meeting and training of the drunken style.  Most of the film is a flashback of when they were young.

Jack Long and Lee Yi Min are amazing as always, performing with great style and speed.  Throw in a final fight scene with Mark Long, the Ghostface Killer in The Mystery of Chess Boxing, and this movie could not get much better.  There is as much, if not more, drunken style performed here than in any other film I've seen.  Although, it does lack a little of the style that is in Yuen Woo Ping's directed performances(Jackie Chan, Hwang Jang Lee).

As for the DVD itself, the picture is full screen but filmed well enough to not cut off much of what is in the scene.  The film quality is average for an old school kung fu movie that is not digitally remastered.  At least it doesn't claim to be remastered like nearly all others that really are not.  The audio is english dubbed only and again is average.

I recommend this movie to any martial arts collection, and also The Mystery Of Chess Boxing and Seven Grandmasters.  If you like one, you'll like the others.",1105920000,2,1727,4.508038585209003
7961707,2,B000066754,"This is another version of the popular ""Drunken Master"" tale of Beggar Su, an old drunkard who perfected ""Drunken kung fu,"" so memorably portrayed by Simon Yuen in Yuen Wo Ping's DRUNKEN MASTER (1978), one of the two films that propelled Jackie Chan to his early stardom. The DVD case for WORLD OF DRUNKEN MASTER (1979) is somewhat misleading in that it promotes Simon Yuen, old ""Drunken Master"" himself, as the star. However, Simon appears only in a prologue sequence doing kung fu moves on a beach as the narrator tells us the story of the friendship of Fang Ta Rei and Beggar Su. Then, as the story begins, a completely different actor plays Beggar Su in a framing sequence that leads to a lengthy flashback detailing how the two men met. In the flashback, yet another actor, Lee Yi Min, plays Beggar Su while Jack Long plays Fang Ta Rei in both flashback and the framing sequence. Chan Wai Lau, an underrated supporting player in kung fu films, plays Chang 7th, the instructor who trains the two young men in ""the 18 Falls of the Drunken Immortals."" As a result, they're able to fight off attacks by Tiger Yeh (Lung Fei), a local landlord who, after losing a fight with Chang 7th, closes the winery where all the main characters work and then leads his men in an attack on the place. This response is quite baffling since it makes absolutely no sense for a businessman to destroy his own property and disrupt the manufacture of a product he profited from. (But it makes for a lively fight scene.)
The film is not terribly well written or edited. Fight scenes are often broken up to cut to other action, a tack usually avoided in these films so that fans can enjoy a rousing fight in one place from start to finish. However, the film does offer four extremely good kung fu players, including Jack Long (7 GRANDMASTERS), Lee Yi Min (NINJA CHECKMATE), Lung Fei (ONE-ARMED BOXER), and Chan Wai Lau (WU TANG SACRED FIST). The fight and training choreography is at least well shot and staged (by Yuen Cheung-Yan, who later did similar chores for the two CHARLIE'S ANGELS films) and presented in the proper widescreen dimensions on this DVD which comes in the Mandarin language with English subtitles.
The first hour of the film is, for the most part, pretty exciting, but after the big fight with Tiger Yeh the action cuts back to Fang and Su reminiscing, 30 years later, and then the film continues pouring on fight scenes with new characters whose presence has no real dramatic purpose other than to extend the running time (to roughly 90 minutes). One of the new fighters is Mark Long (also seen in 7 GRANDMASTERS and NINJA CHECKMATE), who seems somewhat wasted here (he'd have been better served playing Tiger Yeh).",1066435200,5,2717,4.639004149377594
