8393926,4,B003BV8HZK,"Okay, I bought this movie having seen only one review at a 1 star, but I figure at eleven bucks for the Blu-Ray from Fry's, it's worth it just to see how bad it could be.  I figure if I expected it to be awful, I'd be pleasantly surprised.  I wasn't disappointed.

Okay, so the main character is an incredibly twisted pervert of a nerd (and, really, almost all the major characters are perverts), but the story is pretty funny, assuming you're a geek or a nerd.  That said, I'd caution that this is a very adult movie, and it might be a little too creepy for non-geek, non-nerd people.  If the concept of someone engaging in... adult activity... with a computer grosses you out, don't watch this one.",1297728000,7,700,4.395348837209302
8393927,1,B003BV8HZK,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen.  Don't waste your time nor money.  This is nothing but a computer geek's bonk-fest with his hard drive (pardon the pun.)  There's no real plot, no character development, no character arc, and very poor acting.",1279670400,,252,4.681818181818182
