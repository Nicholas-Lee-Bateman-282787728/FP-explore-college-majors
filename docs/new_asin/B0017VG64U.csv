3175853,5,B0017VG64U,"I watched this movie on Netflix and absolutely loved it. It sort of reminds me of ""Hard Candy"" in that it's a psychological flick and a struggle between a man and woman, but with enough romance and tenderness to have you rooting for both the good and bad guy.

Both characters are wounded in some way and they both take turns caring for each other. Plus, I'm the kinda girl that gets weak in the knees for the ""manly man"" type that's tough to the world but all mushy and soft when it comes to the one he loves.

I love how there is such tension between them that eventually turns into a timid friendship, then love.

The only thing that I was confused about is why the film is called ""Puppy"". Once in the entire movie, the anti-hero's ex-wife calls him ""Puppy"" but that was so insignificant and at the end of the story, so I don't see the rationale behind naming an entire movie for it.

Loved the ending of the movie. It was like a warm hug and a realistic ""true love"" story.",1293580800,4,976,4.231182795698925

8267495,3,B0017VG64U,It seems like an Australian made for TV movie. Nothing especially good or bad about it. It stretches credibility that the killings would not be discovered.,1495929600,,155,5.0
