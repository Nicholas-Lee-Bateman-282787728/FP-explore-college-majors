8474814,4,B003NVA080,"I could attend live operas for the rest of my life without ever having an opportunity to hear this one, so I'm very glad for this DVD issue. Although the singers are even less well-known than the opera, they all perform well; however, there are no great voices to be heard. The production (thank heaven) is set in 19th century Italy where it belongs, and is remarkably detailed and realistic considering how rarely it is likely to be used. The casting of Japanese singers in the roles of the bride and her mother gives rise to the only questionable production decision: making these CHARACTERS Japanese, which is not credible in this setting, especially since they are supposed to be blood relatives of Italians. (When Leontyne Price sang in ""Il Trovatore"" or ""La Forza del Destino,"" nobody thought her character needed to be black.) The opera is an amusing trifle with a silly plot, with a libretto (by the composer) that provides no occasion for deep engagement in the drama. But it is an hour of good fun and I wouldn't have missed it.",1278892800,7,1038,4.6775956284153
8474815,1,B003NVA080,"First of all the opera is only 61 minutes.
4:3 production
Singing not too bad. Picture not too bad
But there are very small subtitles and some of them are even scrambled, so that they cannot be read.
Another KICCO poor product",1277856000,4,226,4.404761904761905
