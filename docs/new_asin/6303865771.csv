7854205,4,6303865771,"This may be the best ""Die Fledermaus"" available. Everything is delightfully performed, and the production includes a ""gala"" section where guest stars perform at the party. Hermann Prey manages to have fun with the role of a deceitful husband although he had been performing it for years. Kiri te Kanawa shines as his doubting wife. As conductor, Placido Domingo brings out a lightness and prettiness that keeps the champagne bubbling.",1269648000,,434,5.214285714285714
7854206,5,6303865771,"This the very best video available of ""The Bat"" from Covent Garden with Hermann Prey and Kiri, conducted by Placido Domingo performing at their very best with a wonderful supporting cast.  The jailer pulled a great surprise in rehearsal and it stayed in the production, but I'll leave that for your viewing pleasure.  I have a German production with Wolfgang Brendel that is quite good but this production is the best of the video versions I've ever seen.  A truly amusing opera with great fun to be had by both the cast and the audience.  It is a tradition among my opera loving friends to watch this New Year's and always such a delight.  Costumes, production and cast are first rate!  If you like this opera or have never seen it - Buy this version and sit back and enjoy!  You will love seeing it again and again!  Highly recommended!",998006400,19,838,4.54
