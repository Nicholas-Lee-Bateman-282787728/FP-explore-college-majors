8375864,5,B002O1INXO,"This episode concerned a Kansan, middle-aged, white woman and a California, Latino, 37 year-old man, both of whom are addicted to meth.  Usually ""Intervention"" focuses on younger people, but this is the first time where I saw older subjects and thought, ""Grow up already!""  These two people were downright crazy!  The woman would walk around in bathing suits and gawdy Stevie Nicks-like rags.  She thought the camera crew were spies for the FBI.  The guy's eyebrow pierces looked like devil's horns.  His hair was dyed wild colors, even though he was balding.  He took photographs of nothing and made doodoo, subpar paintings.  Both subjects were very close to homelessness.  This made me think of when Lisa Simpson opened her towel and yelled out, ""I am the Lizard Queen!""  Some joked that maybe Madonna's daughter would grow up to be plain compared to her mother.  I thought of that as I saw the female subject's adults sons be far more mature and realistic than their mother.  It was sad seeing the male subject cry.  He brought up suicidal ideation: a topic that I fear ""Intervention"" doesn't reveal enough.  These two should be very grateful that they weren't institutionalized.  Watching them was just jaw-dropping.",1293580800,,1221,4.975247524752476
