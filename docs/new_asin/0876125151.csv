7793311,2,0876125151,"This DVD is about 30 minutes in length, and is more of a commercial or promo for the book--while the interview with 2 of PY's disciples is an obvious hit--it is short and for the price, could've be at least full length--it would've been great if this expounded on the teachings in the book, or presented them, but it's just a couple blinks about PY writing it. My suggestion would be to skip this and go for one that has teachings.",1489104000,,431,4.333333333333333

7793316,4,0876125151,"This DVD is different from the other ""older adult"" DVDs I own.  It seems more rigorous, which makes for a nice change (I switch up the DVDs every day).  The exercises move quickly, so your heart is pumping, but not so much that you can't keep up.  At least, it's that way for me.
Curtis is pleasant, but he repeats everything he says several times.  No matter, I still like using this DVD.",1464912000,3,389,4.287671232876712
