2491605,5,B000E5LEVA,"This film is a cat's cradle of relationships in which some strings touch and others don't. Jeanne Moreau's Florence is never seen with her lover Julien, played by Maurice Ronet, except in photographs at the very end. A German couple on holiday crosses paths with two reckless teenage lovers and end up dead. Although this film, directed by a 24-year-old Louis Malle, is generally considered a precursor to the French New Wave, it has all the elements, in particular a mysterious, emotionally tortured femme fatale played with quiet elegance by Jeanne Moreau. Her penetrating eyes are haunting as she walks through the rain searching for her lover. She has one of those faces you either adore or are annoyed by. I go back and forth myself. But my own opinion of this film is that Malle was showing off his tremendous talent just a bit too much and it comes across sometimes that he's trying too hard to be cool. But most of the time his film really is cool. And it's nice to be reminded how cool a film can be.",1146441600,,1009,4.549450549450549
2491606,4,B000E5LEVA,"Louis Malle is one of the best film directors to ever work in the field. He is perhaps best known for his semi-autobiographical films ""Murmur of the Heart"" and ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"", both of which depict fictionalized periods of his life growing up in France. All of his films have a magical quality about them telling compelling stories about believable characters. My first exposure to Malle was ""Atlantic City"", the story of an aging wannabee gangster (Burt Lancaster) who falls in love with a younger woman working in the oyster bar at a casino. Each has dreams they are pursuing, trying to escape the grind of working on the boardwalk. ""Atlantic City"" cemented Sarandon's growing reputation and helped to preserve Lancaster's film legacy. The popularity of ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"", about Malle's days at a boarding school and the friendship he made there, warranted the re-release of ""Murmur of the Heart"" allowing more people to experience his films. Malle quickly became on of ""those"" directors whose every new film I eagerly await.

One of Malle's earliest films, ""Elevator to the Gallows"" has just been re-released. Shot in black and white, featuring Jeanne Moreau's first film role, and highlighted by a Miles Davis soundtrack, the film is a great example of Film Noir.

Florence (Jeanne Moreau) and Julien (Maurice Ronet) share a phone conversation that only two lovers in Paris can have; they make arrangements to meet later that evening. Julien, the second-in-command at a shady French corporation, asks the receptionist if she can stay a little late. They are working on a Saturday so Julien can finish a report for their boss, Carala to take with him to Geneva. The boss calls down and says he will be leaving to catch his train shortly. Julien reenters his office, grabs his gloves, a gun, the report and a grappling hook and walks out on to his balcony. He throws the grappling hook around the balcony above and climbs up to his boss' office. Entering through the front, Julien presents the report and then kills his boss, making the death appear to be a suicide. He locks all of the doors from the inside and then climbs back to his office and leaves with the receptionist and a security guard. Walking them out, the guard returns to the building to finish his rounds. Julien hops into his convertible, attracting the eye of the flower shop girl nearby, who is meeting her boyfriend, a wannabe hood. As Julien starts the car, he realizes that he forgot to remove the rope from the balcony and rushes back inside, leaving the car running. Julien makes it up three floors in the elevator before the security guard cuts the power and leaves for the weekend, stranding him in the elevator. The flower shop girl and her boyfriend steal the car for a joyride, riding Florence who is waiting for Julien. Florence recognizes the car, but only sees the girl in the passenger seat, assuming the worse.

It may seem like I have described the entire film, but really I have just covered the set-up, all of which is intriguing and extremely well done. The film continues from here making twists and turns along the way that will delight Noir enthusiasts.

Taking place over the course of one day, the film has a stark look, almost a sort of enhanced black and white. Figures pop out with little definition or detail against backgrounds which are fairly monochromatic. This is more a result of the technique of the day and age when the film was made, Jean- Luc Godard's early films are similar, but it aids the mood of the story well.

Jeanne Moreau is beautiful and intriguing as Florence, Carala's wife. Destined to become an international star, this is a good opportunity to watch her first film, to watch how she commands your attention in every frame.

""Elevator"" is not a timeless film, peppered with dated elements and references. The story following the two young lovers as they joyride through the countryside is very grounded in the late 50s. Their speech patterns, mannerisms, actions, all scream James Dean and Elvis.

But these brief moments are counteracted by other brilliant touches throughout. The story contains twists and turns which are surprising and well-done. And the Miles Davis soundtrack is, understandably, great. Thankfully, it doesn't accompany every scene, only punctuating brief interludes of the story, highlighting particular scenes.

Also, there is a light dose of political consciousness in the film. There are many mentions of arms dealers, wars, etc., as the business Julien and Carala are involved in, giving the film a little more heft, more resonance. None of these elements really serve the story, except to make Carala a well-known figure. Malle was clearly interested in making a statement. The effort is very subtle. I'm not sure he achieved his goal, but it adds to the dimensions of these characters, making them more real.

""Elevator to the Gallows"" is a great film, an early effort from a master filmmaker.",1122940800,14,4960,4.881235154394299
2491607,4,B000E5LEVA,"Released originally in 1957, newly restored this year, Louis Malle's (""Pretty Baby"") gorgeous ""Elevator to the Gallows"" (""Ascenseur pour l'Echafaud"") is ultimately more flash than substance: many scenes were filmed with natural light (shades of Dogma95?) and Jeanne Moreau's penultimate scene walking down the Champs Elysees light only from the glare of the shop windows that she passes is stunning in its simple, shadowy beauty. Paris, in many ways has never looked more beautiful or more sinister.

The plot revolves around two couples: Florence Carala (Moreau), her paramour Julien (Maurice Ronet) and two juvenile delinquents, Veronique (Yori Bertin) and Louis (Georges Poujouly)...who steal Julien's car. The quartet meet only at the conclusion of the film though their actions definitely affect each other earlier.

There is also intrigue involving Julien and Florence's husband Simon Carala (Jean Wall) and their participation in war profiteering in the Indochina War (it is 1957, after all). But the plot takes a back seat to the mise en scene as Malle's camera and the mood take precedence over plot development and plot logic.

""Elevator to the Gallows"" (a very witty title, by-the-way) is at times breathtakingly beautiful to behold: Decae's moody camerawork and Miles Davis' score and trumpet work are brilliant. And as a precursor to the emotional depth, flash and profundity of what was soon to arrive, ""Elevator to the Gallows"" is an important piece of the wonderful puzzle that was to become the French New Wave a few years hence.",1122854400,37,1546,5.276422764227642
2491608,5,B000E5LEVA,"The opening shot with Jeanne Moreau saying I love you to his lover: Maurice Ronet is the real spark which will initiate a macabre plan ; adultery, betray, greed and above all black humor - in a very original feature film, the Opus one of Louis Malle visibly influenced by Hitchcock but under this touch of genius - will be the main ingredients of this chilling story, Miles Davis will be the guest star in which soundtrack concerns , accenting the drama in Paris streets.

Eventually the sarcastic irony reminds us immediately with later episodes of the famous TV series: The twilight zone. The claustrophobic situation and the obsessive search of both lovers will lead to a suspense level almost unbearable. I must confess I watch this film once by year since 1995 and I really enjoy it every time: that's is a very smart indicator of the  interweaved status legend about this extraordinary work.

One of the giant movies in any age and one of the top ten French New Wave films.",1111104000,2,979,4.6473988439306355
2491609,4,B000E5LEVA,"French New Wave at it's best? Louis Malle's first film has been considered one of the first if not the first film of the French New Wave and either way is certainly one of the best. The story has Hitchcockian undertones to it; A man kills his lover's husband and then gets trapped in the elevator while fleeing the scene. The tension mounts as the man's lover, Jeanne Moreau and the audience wait to see if he will escape or get caught. Like the early films of the new wave there are many shots of and around Paris. However Malle made one of the best decisions in cinematic history by having Miles Davis do the soundtrack. Miles gives those scenes in Paris and the entire film a quality that is indescribable.  For those who admire the films of Godard, Truffaut or Varda will love this unbelievable piece of cinema. However this film is not available on DVD. Cannot for the life of me imagine why. Criterion please help!!! The soundtrack on its own is amazing and for jazz fans should be purchased immediately. I looked for it forever and it has finally been released on CD.",1073260800,26,1074,4.479591836734694
2491610,5,B000E5LEVA,"With the much-heralded score by Miles Davis, this film is a superb example of both French New Wave cinema (purportedly the first, if not one of the first) and great French crime cinema.  Starting with the tried and true plot of a pair of lovers who agree to do away with the woman's rich husband so they can be free of the encumbrance of marriage and simultaneously reap the financial benefits, the story takes some unexpected turns.  Throw in a pair of younger lovers, an effusive German couple, a Mercedes Benz 300 SL gullwing, and a dangling rope, and you have the makings of a first-rate suspense film that was, for its time, light years ahead of a whole lot of other stuff.
The jazzy score does exactly what's needed at all the right moments. The title refers to a situation experienced by one of the lovers.  Jeanne Moreau is great as the rich husband's wife, and the other cast memebers are just as good.  Malle has a perfect sense of pacing as well, and a flair for infusing his black-and-white photography with just the right noir lines and shadows.
The New Wave feeling is conveyed by the occasional self-reflective voiceover, emotional aloofness linked to violence, and the up-to-that-time (in French cinema) never-before linking of individual-based scenes with expressive, non-classically based music (Davis' score).
Highly recommended for those interested in French cinema, film noir, and film in general.",1061856000,5,1418,4.945378151260504
2491611,4,B000E5LEVA,"This film can be considered one of the earliest, and in my opinion, one of the best New Wave films. It is by far my favorite of the early Malle works. The mood is set by the soundtrack which was done by Miles Davis. The  chaotic feel of the music is perfectly fitted to the pace of the film, made  all the more amazing considering that Davis and company improvised the  entire score while watching the movie in a studio. The story itself is a  pretty straight-forward murder plot, but its quirks and twists serve to  make it haunting and beautiful. The shots of Paris, the drives into the  Banlieu...Malle makes the most of what little there was. Dialogue is not  even an issue here; if you don't understand a word of French, it won't hurt  you at all when watching... Well worthwhile.",935366400,9,785,4.440559440559441

2491660,5,B000E5LEVA,"This title existed (in its original French) in my consciousness for over half a century only because it was the flip side of the Miles Davis album on Columbia entitled ""Jazz Track.""  The title in itself suggests that Miles Davis' soundtrack for the French film noir was originally intended as the A side of the album and that the B side, opening with the exquisite introduction by pianist Bill Evans to another movie song, Bronislaw Kaper's ""On Green Dolphin Street,"" was seen as secondary by the Columbia execs. In the immediately following years, then, it was the B side that ""took off,"" a seminal recording by the Miles Davis Sextet that soon became a jazz standard as well as one of the most popular instrumental tunes of all time.

More than half a century after the release of the album ""Jazz Track,"" it's clear that whereas ""On Green Dolphin Street"" is superior movie music,  ""Elevator"" (""Ascenseur Pour L'echafaud"") is the better movie.  It's both an example of ""film noir""--the murky, high anxiety, atmospheric Hollywood product admired and emulated by the French--and of ""decoupage classique""-- the smooth, seamless Hollywood style of editing and shot selection.  The plot can be taken seriously or, if the spectator chooses, seen as a send-up of the genre--a dark comedy version of the prototype investigating motives and results of human greed and passion, violence and treachery.

As tempting as it is to retell the chain of events that lead to the convictions of the ""wrong kilers"" (who are killers all the same), any such summary would spoil the fun for a new viewer.  Suffice it to say that the film, from the very first frame establishess a fast pace that's guaranteed to engage the most hostile viewer to films that are : 1. foreign (perhaps, above all, French); 2. photographed in black and white; 3. require the use of sub-titles (for the non-French spectator).

In response to the above objections, ""Elevator"" is definitely NOT like the cerebral, subtle satire of French film classics such as Renoir's ""Grand Illusion"" and ""Rules of the Game.""  By comparison, ""Elevator"" is an ""action movie"" that tells its story viscerally, or cinematically, with minimal use of subtitles.  It reduces film to its essence--sight and sound--with little reliance on ""literary"" devices such as dialogue.  Moreover, Miles Davis' score is simplistic yet representative of the trumpet player's emergent brilliance. The limited mid-register, generic sound of his horn on the late '40s Charlie Parker recordings has been replaced by a technically accomplished musician whose range, power, and expressive control of individual notes--bending, shaping, half-valving, ""sculpturing"" of pitches--will arguably make his the most identifiable, respected instrumental voice in modern jazz.  He uses two phrases--a minor scale in D with occasional relief from a  suspended C7sus chord--played slow or fast, depending upon action and characterization.  But it's Miles' steely, ""lonely"" sound, especially in the upper register of the horn, that prove sa perfect complement to story, theme, and characterization.  No other trumpet player could have fallen into character as perfectly, as inimitably as Miles.

As a 1958 film (not 1968, as reported in the Amazon description) ""Elevator"" compares favorably with the more acclaimed, contemporaneous French ""new wave"" films of Godard, Truffaut and Resnais.  In many respects it's a better-made, more satisfying movie than the usual films used in the classroom to illustrate French contributions to the history of cinema--""Breathless,"" ""Shoot the Piano Player,"" ""Last Year at Marienbad.""  I confess I enjoyed ""Elevator"" more than any of the these proclaimed classics. Unlike the comparatively neglected ""Elevator to the Gallows,"" all of these familiar, iconic French titles have stretches that are tedious and confusing.

And none of them has Miles Davis, whose very sound is like a 5th leading character in the film, guiding us from the emotions of one character to the next..  So why does this film remain so anonymous?  Many reasons, one being the last five minutes of the movie, which present audience-pleasing closure that is tight, tidy and moral.  That part of the film is so unoriginal and unlike real life, that neither followers of French movies nor cineastes can forgive the director for ""selling out"" with an unnecessary, unwanted moral sermon..  (Hitchcock could get away with it at the end of ""Psycho"" because of his well-established reputation.)

Regardless, I maintain that ""Ascenseur"" deserves admittance to the same cinematic halls of glory as the aforementioned French films.  Why?  Because it's not only a well-made, perfectly balanced mix of film noir and black comedy, but it's also a mirror of America!  More specifically, the film reflects how America is seen by foreigners and how they respond to our movies--in and outside of their own films.  For a fast 90 mintues we're allowed to see ourselves through the revelations of the French lens.

Malle knows that America is defined by two objects--the automatic handgun and the stylish, full-powered automobile, the symbol of status and of speed.  Just as F. Scott Fitzgerald took those two symbols and showed us their effect on a misguided American dreamer by the name of Jay Gatsby, Louis Malle does the same in ""Ascenseur""--but with a difference.  The person who dreams the most and who has the most to lose is French! and she's a woman!  (Our consolation: Jeanne Moreau's character does, in fact, lose more than any of the other hapless characters in the movie.  But Jeanne Moreau the actress would, largely on the strength of her performance in this film, be propelled to the front stage of female actors in world cinema.  At the age of 88 she is today one of the true shining stars of the cosmopolitan silver screen.)",1466121600,7,5825,5.155154091392136
2491661,4,B000E5LEVA,"ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS is the first feature movie by Director Louis Malle.  He was only 25.  It was during the making of this movie Malle approached Miles Davis to improvise a music score while 'watching' ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS - literally.  The result was an almost immediate Birth Of Cool 'sound' that came to epitomize modern film noir and, certainly, it seems most agree, inspired Miles Davis to make the ultimate Birth Of Cool album Kind Of Blue, composed in 1959, just one year later.
ELEVATOR To The GALLOWS is also amazing in the fact it could be (maybe should be) given credit as the beginning (the birth?) of the French New Wave of film inspired by the look and feel of Hollywood's black-and-white, 1940's and 50's classics.  It is not surprising the French coined the phrase ""film noir"" not long after 1958 (the year of THE GALLOWS).
I kept reminding myself Godard's Breathless was filmed 2 years AFTER ELEVATOR To The Gallows.  Breathless is often sighted as the groundbreaking start of the New Wave of film making.  I do believe the realism and art of ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS make it a better movie; and more memorable (the Miles Davis score an obvious plus) than Breathless.
But, check out Louis Malle's film starring Jeanne Moreau who is deserving of praise she receives (every but as much if not more than Jean Seberg, Breathless fame); and nighttime Paris is given a visually stunning black-and-white look by cinematographer Henri Decae.  Honestly, I can see the nighttime Paris 'car racing' scene on the highway in my head clear as day (er, nighttime Paris).
This Criterion Collection is also worth checking out for interview with (Moreau, quite likeable, think she's in her 60's...); and the must see black-and-white 1958 interview with Louis Malle talking about making the movie; and then seeing Davis performing in front of a 'big screen' improvising the score for the movie as he is watching ... !
Watching the birth of The Birth of Cool like that just about rendered me speechless, man.
If worried about the 'possible' slow 'foreign' pace of ELEVATOR to the Gallows it runs 90 minutes as the lover's (Jeanne Moreau) famed slow, 'lost'  walk drags only slightly.  Again, nighttime Paris is worth a close (closer) look (at one point Moreau walks across neon, lamp lit Paris street ... like a ghost ... the cars don't seem to slow down as they pass her ... it's somehow haunting and beautiful ... it's a simple but pretty amazing choreography of a walk by Moreau.  Over analyzing, maybe, but somehow movies like this can cause this 'art' perception, 'symbol' perception.  Also, keep in mind, no CGI in 1958).
The 3 intertwining stories - resembling a thriller - connect and dissect the characters well enough as police investigate false eyewitness testimony and one too many coincidences.
ELEVATOR To The GALLOWS is a must see (and listen) for film buffs.",1465948800,,2877,4.8272357723577235

2491695,4,B000E5LEVA,"This 1958 thriller by Louis Malle opens as Julien Tavernier (Maurice Ronet) is reviewing his plans to murder M. Carala, his boss and the husband of his illicit lover Florence (Jeanne Moreau). They agree to meet later at a restaurant and he goes off to carry out the crime. He creates an alibi by locking himself in his own office, telling the receptionist he is not to be disturbed, and climbs down to Caralas office on the floor below via a rope hooked over the balcony. He shoots Carala and leaves the gun in the dead mans hand to suggest suicide.

As he is about to drive off, he notices that he has forgotten the rope, which still remains hanging from the balconya piece of damning evidence. As he is riding in the elevator to his floor to retrieve the rope, the night watchman cuts the power and the elevator stops mid-floor with Julien trapped inside.

From this point the action cuts back and forth between Julien attempting to escape the elevator, and events on the outside. By the time the film ends another murder has taken place. The loose ends of the plot are tied together when the police investigate the murder scene and happen upon evidence connecting Julien with Caralas death.

A tight, crisp black and white film with no wasted footage. An early indication of Malles artistry. Though this film is credited with launching Jeanne Moreaus career, I found her performance uninspired. She has since gone on to distinguish herself in countless films (Les Amants, Jules et Jim, Les Liaisons Dangereuses, La Notte, A Woman is a Woman, Le Feu Follet and Viva Maria, to name a few) and enjoyed success as a director and vocalist.",1450396800,,1637,4.657439446366782

At the same time, a close Parisian friend of mine says that for her, the movie captures the beauty and the somewhat threatening flavor of Paris in the night. On watching it a second time, Jeanne Moreau walking down the Champs Elysees lit by the shop windows is simple, direct, worth the entire movie.

The plot is well described in other reviews here; for me the photography and the wonderful Miles Davis score and trumpet playing stole the show.

By any yardstick, this would have to be considered an impressive achievement, heightened by the film's memorable improvisational score composed by jazz legend Miles Davis.

People sometimes say Malle, (AU REVOIR LES INFANTS) made Moreaus film career with this film, and the one that followed it shortly, THE LOVERS, (1958).  However, both Malle and Moreau deny this: she was already considered Frances leading stage actress at the time, and had appeared in several B pictures.  But the film industry considered her too plain to carry starring roles.  Guess they must have been stunned at 1962s Nouvelle Vague (New Wave) French classic JULES AND JIM, which Moreau carried memorably and immortally.  At any rate, Moreau certainly carries ELEVATOR as a wealthy housewife who has fallen out of love with her older, arms dealing husband.  So she has taken his employee Tavernier, a handsome valorous former paratrooper, as her lover.  Maurice Ronet, (PURPLE NOON), was a genuinely handsome man, who did not quite have the career he might have for whatever the reasons.  Elga Andersen plays the pretty Frieda Bencker, German tourist; Lino Ventura, (ARMY OF SHADOWS), plays one of his accustomed roles as the cop investigating the mess.

Mind you, this is quite the melodrama, in the French way, but photography, melancholy, moodiness, lighting, jazz score certainly qualify it for the film noir tag. Malle both had a hand in the adaptation, from a novel by Noel Calef, and directed.  The thriller also seems to me to be a precursor to New Wave Cinema.  The character Louis, boyfriend of Veronique, a florists clerk who works next door to the Carala skyscraper and is acquainted with all the main characters, seems to me a precursor to Jean-Paul Belmondos gripping turn in BREATHLESS, 1960, a Jean-Luc Godard film considered the birth of the New Wave.  And Louis certainly shows the influence of Jimmy Dean.  The film also  quite likely accurately shows an older Paris and an older world than the one we know today.  The German tourists who enter the story do so in a Mercedes whose doors open like racing car doors.  At the motel where some characters stay, a man is squashed into a tiny office, developing, onsite, the negatives the travelers drop through his door.  And Moreaus character, clearly a wealthy woman, is able to walk by herself, unmolested, all over the city of Paris all night, looking for her lover, as everything goes wrong around her.  (Unfortunately, I have been unable to discover the designer of Moreaus elegant wardrobe for the picture.)

The acting in the movie is uniformly fine, and seamless; the plot is original, with a lot of twists and turns, and the suspense never lets up. The novice director Malles hand is assured.  Mind you, the plot is complicated, and there isn't a lot of action.  The film requires full attention and probably isn't for everyone.

2491774,5,B000E5LEVA,"One of the finest films of the 50's, and one of the greatest film debuts of all time, Louis Malle's `Elevator to the Gallows' is a stunning piece of cinema that is sure to rise to the top of your favorites list soon after devouring it.  I doesn't hurt that I'm already a huge fan of both Malle and Moreau based on their other work, but honestly this was such a big stepping stone for the both of them and it proves to stand on its own two feet quite sturdily.

The film follows a married woman named Florence who convinces her lover, Julien (who happens to work for her husband) to kill her husband.  After the job is done, they are to rendezvous together.  When Julien winds up trapped in the elevator, the rest of the evening spirals out into a sea of consequences including an emotionally scarred Florence, a panicked Julien and a careless couple who wind up with their hands deep in murder when they decide to steal Julien's car.

Above all else, `Elevator to the Gallows' is a stunning film.  The beautiful cinematography cloaks each scene with a thick density; an emotional heft that was unexpected.  The sharp editing keeps tension high and helps propel the film through each interwoven storyline so as to keep our attention glued and our anticipation high.  The flawless score, written and composed by the legendary Miles Davis, is such a beautiful companion piece, a jazz score rich with detail.  Malle directs this film to perfection, especially when it comes to coaxing out of Moreau a stunning performance that delves deep into the heart and soul of this woman.  Her stare alone just drips with emotional complexity.

Some have baulked at this film (two people here at least) and to them I feel sorry.  This film is such a cinematic landmark.  French films in general always skew towards the implausible (just grab a handful of Jean-Luc Godard to see what I mean) but they are possibly the most enlightened, entertaining and original films ever made.",1339459200,,1962,4.6686046511627906

2491777,5,B000E5LEVA,"Though more of a melodrama from the underlying love story, the whole film ends up as a perfect film noir, where, rather the exception for French films policiers, the police ""wins"", though its investigation techniques include the ""usual"" brutalities. Lino Ventura, normally on the gangster side, is this time with the law, and very much at the end of increasingly intricate developments.

Jeanne Moreau, wife of a crooked industrialist, and her husband's senior advisor, a former parachute officer of the Indochinan and Algerian wars (Maurice Ronet), have fallen in love and try to get rid of the husband. The plan goes as intended except for a rope left dangling outside the top floor, which Ronet has to remove, going up in the elevator once more, where he gets stuck when the power is turned off for the weekend.

They can not communicate, so Moreau thinks, seeing his car with a young woman looking out, that Ronet left her for a young girl; actually, the girl's no-good  boyfriend stole the car with Ronet's papers, mini pictures ""spy"" camera, and a pistol. They race with a sporty Mercedes, belonging to a elder German Nazi and industrialist and his young wife, and get to meet them when both drive into a motel, then a novelty, where the young couple checks in using Ronet's papers.

While Moreau is walking trough the rain looking for Ronet, she has no more make-up and wet hair - the technicians first refused to shoot her like that ""because she looked ugly"", but Malle explained. This walk through nocturnal Paris, like all movie, is supported by musical variations of Miles Davis and an ad hoc quartet, comment-ing and underlining the action. Davis' jazz remains as attractive as when it was first recorded, and helped the success of the film.

After a drinking party at the motel, the no-good youth tries to steal the Mercedes, is caught, and shoots owner and wife in the process. All points to Ronet, who is still caught in the elevator. In the end, earlier photos on the ""spy"" camera show pictures of the Moreau/Ronet pair and disentangle the false identity of the young couple. Justice will take its course.

For Jeanne Moreau, while already an actress of the Comdie franaise at 20, and a supporting actress in many, mostly unremarkable movies, this film was a breakthrough: She eventually became muse and icon of the Nouvelle Vague, after Malle, Truffaut, Antonioni and many others. Malle made his next film - Les Amants - again with her, this time an all wine and roses love story, only slightly melodramatic, but with a happy end.",1315785600,,2547,4.80365296803653

2491812,5,B000E5LEVA,"French auteur Louis Malle made his 1958 feature film debut with ""Elevator to the Gallows,"" when he was just 24 years old.  The film features Jeanne Moreau as the unhappy wife of an older, successful industrialist (Jean Wall).  She's been having an affair with one of his employees, the dashing Julien Tavernier (Maurice Ronet), and the two plan to murder her husband so that they can be together.  Their plan seems to be going perfectly until one detail goes awry, resulting in a cascading disaster that touches the lives of many people.

""Elevator to the Gallows"" is terrific, stylish cinema.  Much of the filming was done on the streets of Paris, giving the movie an almost documentary-like feature (Malle actually started his career in documentaries).  Although the film is noir-ish in style, it also has elements of the French New Wave, albeit with a straight-forward, easy-to-understand plot!  The movie also does an interesting job of interweaving some of the issues of the day (e.g., Vietnam, Algeria, military industrialism) into its thriller plotline.  The plot definitely has some major holes in it, but then most film noir does, and the film's jazzy score by Miles Davis, beautiful leading lady, and gorgeous Paris locales will make you forget about any minor plot glitches.",1262476800,,1285,5.056872037914692
2491813,4,B000E5LEVA,"The perfect murder....is there another basic theme that has been done so often in film? And in particular in American or French films in the immediate post-war era? Here's a French example, Malle's first, released in that same great year as VERTIGO and TOUCH OF EVIL, certainly owing a debt to Hitchock particularly in the opening sequences, though not for my money quite on a par with either of the American masterpieces. Julien Tavernier (Maurice Ronet) plots to kill the wealthy husband of his mistress, Florence Carala (Jeanne Moreau) but leaves one crucial tool in the accomplishment of his plot behind; upon going to retrieve it he becomes stuck in the elevator as the electricity for the building is turned off for the weekend. He races desperately to escape, as his girlfriend becomes desperate with jealousy and paranoia when he doesn't meet her at the appointed hour, and a younger couple becomes embroiled in their own equally violent plot that all stems from their theft of his car.

Meanwhile, the music of Miles Davis plays coolly throughout, and we get an early look at Parisian suburbs and a 50s motel, with endless stretches of open road....this is an international Paris, with an innocent German couple eventually and fatally caught up in the mess, and many evocations of American genre films alongside the great music. If the film ultimately is more an exercise in style than anything else, it's a powerfully successful one and it manages to do as much in spinning its spidery webs of crime in an hour and a half as any American B-noir of the period. The performances are generally good, though they don't necessarily resonate except perhaps for Moreau -- there's little in the way of showboating here, the players are as cool as the music -- and the Criterion DVD is top-notch in quality, both sound and picture, and the extras look enticing.",1254528000,,1862,4.855345911949685

A pre-New Wave crime film from French director Louis Malle that features three interesting and interconnected stories set in motion by a criminal who gets stuck in an elevator after committing an otherwise perfect murder, Elevator to the Gallows is a fine genre film that helps dispel the notion that all French films are talky and pretentious.

3.5/4",1250467200,,369,5.032786885245901
2491815,4,B000E5LEVA,"Like Faulkner's 'As I Lay Dying', 'Elevator to the Gallows' has that morbidly entrancing sort of title impossible for me to resist.  Something unhealthy there, I suppose, but no matter - I only mention it as that's what initially drew me to the feature.  Actually, the Miles Davis soundtrack of the same name did the trick - but what's surprising is that I'd never heard of either until only a year or so ago.  Considering their quality, that makes them entirely too obscure.

Obscure, but likely to remain that way, as what may have been fantastically ultra-cool in 1950's French cinema has a way of dissipating like 4 A.M nicotine clouds in the brightly lit morning of an ADD-addled new century.  It isn't that flaws to the film have appeared over the years, but that even its imitators have imitators now.  This kind of generational influence once removed might be tedious for the majority nowadays - in the fifty years since the release of 'Elevator to the Gallows', we've seen similar enough storylines resuscitated again and again, dressed up, cosmetically enhanced, and trotted out along with a cast of thousands.  What may once have been a taut thriller is now deliberate, and, if not predictable exactly, at the very least seems a bit contrived.

Julien Tavernier (Maurice Ronet) and Florence Carala (Jeanne Moreau) have conspired to kill Florence's husband.  In a nod to unpopular foreign policy, Mr. Carala is a shady businessman profiting from the Algerian conflict, and Julien, who works for him, is a highly decorated veteran from both Indochina and Algeria.  Though it's never fully stated, it seems implicit that Mr. Carala uses Julien in the business expressly because his military skills make him an effective arm-twister, but the only thing Julien is interested in now is Mrs. Carala.

A dysfunctional elevator keeps them from getting away with murder, and while Julien is trapped inside and left to enjoy his preview of a prison cell, a young punk (who's intent on channeling James Dean's unjustified rebel) and his girlfriend go joyriding in Julien's car.  On their own, the two youngsters' get into murder trouble of their own, and leave evidence pointing to Julien.  Meanwhile, the beautiful Jeanne Moreau as Florence walks the streets of Paris, searching for her lover even as she has convinced herself that he has abandoned her.

As a noir thriller (complete with post-war contemplation of life's value and existential monologue at film's end), 'Elevator to the Gallows' may seem to have been imitated and parodied into insignificance by now, but that's if the viewer concentrates only on the story.  The truly original and never quite duplicated aspects of the film are the cinematography and the musical interaction with the performers on the screen.  Both make this film a must see for people who care about the medium, as director Louis Malle's mise en scne and Henri Deca's camera work are stunning, and the music is matched to the mood of the film perfectly.

Complementing my feelings about this film are the two trailers included on the Criterion edition's first disc.  The original accurately reflects the film's tempo, and would attract those most likely still interested.  The second highlights the story, but its modern style of jump cuts and dramatic music insinuate unbearable tension and frenetic pacing, giving the impression that the film is something it's not.  Of the two, I would have liked to watch the film implied by the newer trailer - except it doesn't exist.  Nor is it possible to create it now.  Everything that made this film enjoyable would be destroyed attempting to modernize it - gone would be the authentic Paris nights of the late 1950's in lush black and white, gone would be the originality of the music, and gone too would be the haunted face of Jeanne Moreau, searching for Julien.  To be clear, Criterion did not make this second trailer, and I doubt it's included in any DVD title other than its own.  However, if that were someone's only hint of what the film is about, it misleads by maximizing a questionable appeal to mainstream audiences.

Those who generally favor Criterion's picks will enjoy 'Elevator to the Gallows', but even though I highly recommend it, I'd also suggest previewing before buying.  Once will be enough for some viewers.  However, even if there are elements that are obsolete, some people, like me, will see an elegant mixture of music and film that retains an un-imitated individuality that's still worth possessing.",1244678400,,4510,4.962765957446808

As such, it is quite original for its time:  there are events, but also accidents that lead to pretty serious consequences, to say the least.  I don't want to reveal the plot - but the elevator scene has to be seen to be believed.

The actors, esp., Jeanne Moreau, are very good.  It also evokes late 1950s Paris very well.  But the best thing is the sound track, by Miles Davis, who happened to be in Paris for a failed tour, so he just came up with the music.

""Elevator to the Gallows"" is a deliberately paced outstanding example of fifties-style French film noir.  Accompanied by a desolate tenor sax in the score, this film does not have the jackhammer drive and breathtaking momentum of contemporary thrillers.  What it lacks in nail-biting suspense, however, it more than compensates for with character and story line.

A motley collection of well-limned intriguing characters become ensnared in an intricate web of malevolence that is spun by an unhappy, alienated woman who decides to use her lover as a cat's-paw to do away with her wealthy corporate husband.

In the process, two joyriding teenagers are caught in the web after they rob the murderer's expensive car while he is stuck in the company elevator during his botched attempt to flee from the scene of his recently perpetrated crime.  Trapped by circumstances beyond his control and desperate to escape, like all typical film-noir antiheroes, he can do nothing--no matter how hard he struggles--but meet his miserable fate when the elevator finally starts up again.

If you like Jean-Pierre Melville noir films like ""Le Samourai,"" you should savor watching the various characters of ""Elevator"" succumb to their fates.

2491840,4,B000E5LEVA,"I refer to the Twilight Zone, not because there are any fantastical elements in ""Elevator to the Gallows,"" but because every shot, indeed every word of dialogue is for the specific purpose of tying all the loose strings of a mean-spirited little fable into a neatly knotted bow in the final scene.  Not one of the major roles as written displays any slightest hint of character beyond that demanded by the plot.

If you question that assertion, then explain why the two German characters behave as they do.  And what rationale does the self-destructive young street lout, car thief, lunatic driver, incompetent liar and homicidal jerk have for any of his decisions during the whole length of the film, if it is not simply a means to allow the plot to progress?

Returning to The Twilight Zone connection, ""Elevator to the Gallows"" attains feature length, running about an hour and a half, but there are long sequences that could be greatly shortened, recast into just a couple of shots while still hitting every plot point.  This would reduce the whole to something that could easily be accommodated in a network time slot.

The whole sequence with the Germans is one of them.  Hollywood directors of the 1940s would have encompassed it all in just a few moments by using a couple of wipe cuts.  The single most famous scene in the movie, Jeanne Moreau fruitlessly seeking her lover throughout Paris for the length of a night, is at bottom no more than simple padding.  The scene does not even exist, we are informed, in the novel on which the film is based.

And as long as we are dealing with that sequence, exactly what crime has Moreau committed that led to her arrest at the end of it?  Could it really have been illegal for a well-dressed, affluent-looking, stone-sober woman to be a pedestrian in Paris at 5:00 am?

On the positive side, Moreau does occasionally manage to create the illusion of independent life, in spite of the incessant ticking of the plot and some of the flattest dialogue imaginable.  That illusion, of course, is dissolved late in the film by her one ringing declaration, ""I'll save you!"" That's a thing, alas, more appropriate for Jeanne d'Arc than for Jeanne Moreau.

Some nice, crisp, contrasty visuals appear regularly, although they are woefully self-conscious when compared with their obvious American models.

The film has an impressive jazz score contributed by Miles Davis.  Since everyone involved states this was fortuitous, it can only be regarded as a lucky break, not a basic building block of the movie or an example of the director's foresight.

This is an occasionally handsome-looking, entirely plot-driven little fable for which I would normally assign three stars.  It's lucky enough, however, to have an excellent musical score, so ... four stars.",1190419200,3,2798,4.879492600422833

Julien's efforts to escape the crime scene are intercut with shots of the car thieves's dark exploits and Florence's aimless walks along the Champs-Elyses looking for Julien--a bold technique, in that the film's protagonists remain isolated for most of the picture. Moreau, who cemented her career on the strength of this performance, is a vision of distressed beauty, woefully illuminated by the glare of nighttime Paris. Lean direction, vivid camerawork, and a moody, soul-stirring jazz soundtrack by Miles Davis further emphasize the air of grim fatalism.

2491843,5,B000E5LEVA,"This was Louis Malle's first.  Previously he had worked with Jacques Cousteau on ""The Silent World"" (interestingly enough) and now tried his hand at film noir.  Several things fell into place to make this debut a memorable one.

First, he was able to get Jeanne Moreau to play Florence Carala.  She had previously been mostly a stage and B-movie player who was obviously very talented, but as Malle put it, not considered really photogenic.  What she becomes after her performance here is a premier star of the French cinema partially because of the way she is photographed, and partly because she was so perfectly suited to the character, which I suspect she helped to create.  She does a lot silently or with just a few words in the scenes where she walks the streets of Paris, frantic because her lover and fellow murder conspirator, Julien Tavernier (Maurice Ronet) has stood her up and she cannot understand what has happened.

Second, Malle's collaboration with screenwriter and novelist Roger Nimier adapting a roman thriller by Noel Calef to the screen turned out to be exactly right for the material, especially because they used mostly just the plot of the novel and expanded Moreau's role.

The third factor was the fortuitous jazz score by Miles Davis.  Davis happened to be in Paris as the movie was being edited and Malle was able to talk him into doing a trumpet-centered original score, said to have been composed on the fly late one night and early the next morning as Moreau drank champagne and listened.

""Ascenseur pour l'echafaud,"" like so many American film noirs that it frankly resembles, is a murder done for love and money gone wrong.  It is both a mistake by the murderer and fate itself that traps Julien Tavernier.  But there is an intriguing complication in the person of young Louis (Georges Poujouly) who steals Julien's car and takes the flower girl (who admired the dashing Tavernier from afar) on an ill-fated joy ride.  Unlike most of Malle's work to come, this is clearly a plot-driven, commercial flick (but oh, so exquisitely done!) without a hint of the usual autobiographical elements for which Malle is so well-known.

The Criterion Collection two disc set features interviews with Moreau, Malle and others, and includes Malle's student film, ""Crazeologie,"" (after a Charlie Parker tune) a ""theater of the absurd"" little ditty about which I can only say I would never have guessed that Louis Malle was the auteur.  ""Elevator to the Gallows"" itself is a beautifully restored high-definition black and white transfer with new and excellent subtitles.  There is a booklet with an insightful review by Terrence Rafferty and part of a very interesting interview with Malle conducted by Philip French.

By the way, Malle was 24-years-old when he made this film and commented that he was very worried about his ability to work with actors since he had ""spent four years"" previously ""filming fish""! (quoting from the Philip French interview).  He gives Jeanne Moreau credit for being ""incredibly helpful"" until he lost his fear of actors.

So, see this for Jeanne Moreau, one of the legends of the French cinema, who displays here a kind of magnetic sexuality that had me thoroughly intrigued.",1175472000,5,3227,4.942592592592592
2491844,4,B000E5LEVA,"Amid war, espionage and social oppression, wealthy Florence Carala (Jeanne Moreau), fed up with her corrupt husband, becomes enamored with one of his most trusted employees, Julien Travernier (Maurice Ronet). Together, they plot a way for their hearts to belong exclusively to one another. Separated in a manner neither could imagine, forlorn Florence is silently consumed by jealousy, blame, fear, and desperation as she searches all night, warmed only by the passion of her desire. By chance, young lovers Louis (Georges Poujouly) and Veronique (Yori Bertin), intersect paths with Julien and Florence in ways that forever alters the future of all four.

With skillful direction and co-authorship, Louis Malle depicts indifferent anti-social behavior capitulating 10 years after this directorial debut. Optimizing a minimal budget, the film-noir ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS employs stark natural lighting, shadows, and alternating depth-of-field, punctuated with just enough dialogue to make reading English subtitles a necessity but not a chore. ELEVATOR conveys the feeling that one is witnessing the genesis of something big. Indeed, the synergism of creative expression combined in roughly 90 minutes helped define future roles of Louis Malle, Jeanne Moreau, and Miles Davis.

The Criterion Collection of DVD extras makes this a true collector's item. With the silent film projected in front of him from a light booth over his shoulder, watch Miles Davis interpret the emotions of Moreau as she wanders along the Champs-Elysees under Paris streetlights. Listen to ambitious director Malle confidently discuss his yet-to-be-released film. Then sit down with him 18 years later as he reveals its impact on cinema. Hear Moreau in the 21st century convey how ELEVATOR was a catalyst for similar emotional attachment between her and the director nearly 50 years ago. At the 1993 Caines Festival, Moreau and Malle sit down together to share when they first met; Malle reveals that Moreau's prominent ""Have you seen Julien?"" introspective role was absent from the original novel but crafted just for her to give the film its enduring impact. Such footage is spectacular.

Like Hitchcock, Malle makes a brief cameo appearance. A lighthearted reference to his prior experience with Jacques Cousteau is made when a woman tells Veronique, ""You ought to try underwater photography."" It is amazing to think that prior to ELEVATOR, the only thing Malle directed was fish.

The spatial void of physical contact, melancholy music, and to American audiences, lack of English dialogue may leave some wanting more action. But such desire turns out to be a platform for power in the movie -- the sense of an unsatiated night of emotional turmoil transmigrates to the viewer. If I were were fluent in French, I would likely rate this movie with 5 stars. Feeling that some of the natural dialogue is lost in the translation, I subtract one when recommending to fellow English speaking viewers.

Movie quote: ""I lost you in the night Julien. I shouldn't have kissed you or caressed your face. If you didn't kill Simon, never mind. If you were afraid, so much better. But you must come back.""",1173225600,7,3169,5.242603550295858
2491845,4,B000E5LEVA,"Louis Malle's classic French film noir ""Elevator to the Gallows"" is accompanied by a smooth musical score courtesy of legendary jazz musician Miles Davis.  Pouty lipped femme fatale Jeanne Moreau, in a pivotal early role, playing Mme. Carala, young wife of wealthy arms merchant Simon Carala played by Jean Wall is an accomplice in a murder plot.  She and her husband's business associate Julien Tavernier played by Maurice Ronet, an ex-paratrooper in Indochina and Algeria plot to kill Moreau's husband by faking a suicide.

Everything goes as planned until Ronet spots a rope he used to rapel up to Mr. Carala's office as he's departing in his convertible.  When returning to the office, he gets trapped in the elevator as the company's security guard turns off the electricity for the weekend.

Meanwhile, a young flower shop girl and her delinquent boyfriend steal Tavernier's car and go on an escapade which results in the shooting of a German couple at a motel. The young man, Louis is posing as Tavernier and uses his revolver to commit the murder.

Moreau while waiting at a cafe for her beloved Tavernier, spots his stolen car with the young flower shop girl hanging out of the window.  Thinking she's been jilted, she roams the rainswept Paris streets in a state of bewilderment mourning the loss of her lover.

Tavernier finally released from his entombment in the elevator quickly gets picked up for the murder of the German couple.  In a twisted conclusion, justice is aptly served to the whole array of criminals involved in the respective murders.",1160524800,6,1562,4.931297709923665
2491846,5,B000E5LEVA,"Louis Malle's first film Elevator To The Gallows (1957, released 1958), his homage to US pulp, is out for the first time ever on DVD.  Jazz-buffs know it for its spare, haunting score by Miles Davis.  Malle himself is better known these days for his US films - think Pretty Baby and Atlantic City.  Those featured his then-partner Susan Sarandon.  In Elevator To The Gallows he introduced the young, jolie-laide  Jeanne Moreau as the wife of a wealthy businessman who has arranged for her ex-Foreign Legion lover to murder her husband and run off with her.

 What seems a perfect plan goes awry and Moreau (looking oddly like '60s UK actress Hayley ""Pollyanna"" Mills - how different little Hayley's career might have been if she'd been born in France) spends much of the film wandering the Paris streets alone at night.  Her lover has not only failed to turn up at their rendezvous; she has seen him drive by with another woman in his car.

 In fact, the lover/murderer - played by Maurice Ronet as the epitome of cool ten years before Belmondo in Breathless - is trapped in the elevator of the building where he has killed Moreau's husband.  His car has been stolen by a punk who is joyriding with his girlfriend.  What the joyriders get embroiled in during the night ensures that what seemed a perfect murder plot has unravelled by the time the sun comes up again.

 Elevator To The Gallows is pacy and tense, luminescently  photographed and superbly acted by all the leads.  The score is sublime, of course.  The DVD is packed with great extras. Indispensable.",1154044800,9,1563,4.6875
2491847,4,B000E5LEVA,"Louis Malle was all of 25 when he made his directorial debut with this 1958 noirish thriller that also serves as a morality play. Using the elevator of the title as a vehicle for his leitmotif, he does an admirable job of capturing the smoky gray atmosphere of Paris in the 1950's and using it to great cinematic effect on a chain-link story of deception and murder. In fact, the whole movie plays like a Francophile version of a James M. Cain novel times two with plot twists coming in quick and sometimes contrived succession. To its credit, the brief 92-minute running time trots by quickly given the multiple storylines.

The labyrinth story focuses first on illicit lovers Florence Carala, the restless wife of a corrupt arms dealer, and Julien Tavernier, a former war hero working for Florence's husband. There is not a wasted moment as they plot her husband's murder, but of course, things go awry with a forgotten piece of evidence and a running car ready to be taken. An amoral young couple, sullen and resentful Louis and free-spirited Veronique, enter the scene tangentially and get caught up in their own deceptions with a boisterous German couple whom they meet through a fender bender. The plot strands meander somewhat and eventually come together in a climax that has all the characters confronting the harsh reality of their past actions. There is a particular poignancy in the photos Florence sees at the end since we have no indication of the depth of emotion between the lovers otherwise.

Malle, along with co-screenwriter Roger Nimier, presents an interesting puzzle full of irony and chance events, but there is a periodic slackness to the suspense, for instance, Florence's endlessly despondent walk though nocturnal Paris. Jazz great Miles Davis contributes a fitting hipster score, though the music is not as big an element as I expected in setting the mood. With her sorrowful eyes and pouting intelligence, Jeanne Moreau makes a vivid impression as Florence and gives her obsessed character the necessary gravitas to make her journey worthy of our interest. Maurice Ronet effectively plays Julien like a coiled spring throughout, and it's intriguing to note how most of his performance takes place in an immobilized elevator. As Louis and Veronique, Georges Poujuloy and the especially pixyish Yori Bertin are the forerunners for the runaway pair in Jean-Luc Godard's ""Breathless"" replete with youthful angst and mercenary cool.

The print transfer on the 2006 Criterion Collection DVD package is wonderfully pristine. The first disc also contains the original and 2005 re-release trailers, though there is surprisingly no scholarly audio commentary track (the usual bonus for a Criterion release). The second disc, however, makes up for it with a bevy of extras starting with an extensive 1975 early career retrospective interview with Malle, a 2005 interview with an aged but still haunting Moreau, and a joint interview with the two icons and one-time lovers at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival.

Three shorts on the second disc focus on Davis's contribution - the six-minute ""The Record Session"" shot the night Davis and his musicians recorded the score; a remembrance piece with pianist Rene Utreger, the only surviving member of Davis's ensemble; and the celebratory ""Miles Goes Modal: The Breakthrough Score to Elevator to the Gallows"" where jazz trumpeter Jon Faddis and music critic Gary Giddins discuss Davis's influence over the generation of musicians to come. There is also a short by Malle set to Charlie Parker's ""Crazeology"" and an informative 25-page photo essay booklet.",1147824000,31,3613,5.139455782312925
2491848,4,B000E5LEVA,"The actress Jeanne Moreau, now almost 80, pauses from talking about her film career, as if something urgent has occurred to her. She looks dead at you, the viewer, her eyes dark and instantly hypnotic. ""You think you know a lot,"" she says. ""And you don't.""

Moreau then casually returns you to the story of how she made the groundbreaking ""Elevator to the Gallows"" (1958) with young Louis Malle, her director and lover. ""It was the decisive moment for the rest of my life,"" the storied French actress says.

Moreau's talk is one of several compelling extra features on Criterion's release of ""Gallows"" (Ascenseur pour l'echafaud). The movie itself, somewhere between noir and new wave, is remembered mostly for its innovations in camerawork and for its soundtrack, a work of improvisation by Miles Davis that pushed jazz in new directions.

The French director made quite a few better films. But ""Gallows,"" his first, certainly will be of interest to jazz fans and the new wave hardcore.

The ""Gallows"" set devotes three short films to the all-night session that produced the Davis soundtrack. ""Malle had nerves of steel to put something as important as the score in the hands of an improvising musician,"" the critic Gary Giddons says in the 24-minute interview piece ""Miles Goes Modal."" Davis recorded in Paris with the expatriate drummer Kenny Clarke and three Europeans. Each worked in front of a screen displaying a rough cut of the movie.

Davis seems to duet with Moreau's character, who walks wraithlike through the streets of Paris as he plays. ""It was a flow,"" says the actress, a witness to the session. Also on hand was a French TV crew, which came away with severely hip footage of Davis improvising (it runs about 4 minutes).

The one-channel audio, taken from the 35mm print's optical track, benefits from significant restoration. Davis' horn sounds silky yet distinct. In action scenes, the cymbals and bass pounce out of the speakers. Henri Decae's black-and-white images are works of art, casting nighttime Paris and Moreau in natural light. The free-moving camera and low lighting were innovations that inspired France's emerging new wave. (""Gallows"" is presented widescreen with the 16:9 enhancement.)

Extras also include a fun chat with Malle and Moreau at 1993's Cannes festival; an interview with the (somewhat disgruntled) pianist who played on the soundtrack; and Malle's absurdist student film ""Crazeologie,"" which bops along to the titular Charlie Parker song.",1147564800,5,2487,5.110837438423645
