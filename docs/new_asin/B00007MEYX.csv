8637021,4,B00007MEYX,"This was my first video of martial arts weapons, and I think didn't was wrong; these guy shows you a Kama kata, at first this kata looks very simple, but during the video master was going explaining real applications of kama combat, and was very amazed what you can do with these beatiful weapons.

I could see there are other dvd's of this same master, now I met him, I wouldn't have doubts to buy others dvd's.

By the way some defects (but you can omit), poor quality sound & image, minimum effective time (about 35 mins).",1130976000,,525,4.402061855670103
