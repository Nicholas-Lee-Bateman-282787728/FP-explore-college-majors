8524877,5,B0083WYBKW,I'm very glad I purchased this video set.  My daughter gets so sucked into it I love it.  This should be on the Nick Jr. channel. Great find.  I recommend it to anyone with small children.,1338854400,,188,4.166666666666667
8524878,5,B0083WYBKW,"The complete set of this series is definitely well worth the price.  I wouldn't necessarily think that if my kids had watched through it once and been done with it, but they've gone through it twice already and they show no signs of slowing down.  Be Alert Bert conveys its safety tips in a medium that is well received by children (mine are 4), so when you couple the fact that my kids are learning how to be safe while being entertained for hours on end (giving me a few spare minutes here and there :)), I can't recommend it highly enough.",1337817600,,542,4.303921568627451
8524879,5,B0083WYBKW,Excellent shows and wonderful characters! My kids love this show and are already singing along.  This is definitely a winner in my books.  Good content for children.  Thanks Be Alert Bert!!  Hope to see more!,1337731200,,208,4.857142857142857
8524880,5,B0083WYBKW,Good content and characters keep my kids interested and gets them active.  Can't wait till it becomes back available for order. I wish this show was on tv more but I haven't seen it for awhile.,1337558400,2,193,4.361111111111111
