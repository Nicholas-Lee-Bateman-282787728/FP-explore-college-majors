8080104,5,B000AXQ33A,It has several dances on it and it is easy to figure out the moves and with practice you will look pretty hot dancing.,1364083200,,118,3.9583333333333335
8080105,4,B000AXQ33A,"Nick Felix's new videos may be slow but he details each steps meticulously.  He differentiates Mambo and Salsa quite well.  The steps in
Salsa and Mambo may not reflect the real latin flavor that you see when you attend latin parties though.  But he did a good job in the Samba
and Merengue dance lessons.  He simplified learning Samba and he showed new steps in Merengue that you do not see in other Merengue
dance lesson videos.  For the affordable price of this video, it is worthwhile to have this set to add to your dance steps.",1347580800,,533,4.453608247422681
8080106,4,B000AXQ33A,"Although his style is very informal, it's also non-intimidating.  It's easy to follow for very beginners, yet there's some interesting arm movements that will make you look more advanced.  I enjoyed it, despite it being a little too talky.",1230854400,,239,5.102564102564102
8080107,1,B000AXQ33A,This video was horrible.  Very cheesy production - more a video of a marginal beginning dance class than a professionally produced video production with any pre-planning.  Don't buy it - you will not be happy.,1211673600,,209,4.942857142857143
