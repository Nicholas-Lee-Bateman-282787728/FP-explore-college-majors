8657647,4,B00KCSJPS8,Movie is wonderful (5 stars) the httyd2 flyers are not worth the additional cost.,1420588800,,81,4.857142857142857
8657648,1,B00KCSJPS8,"My son bought this for me for Christmas. I have not told him that How To Train Your Dragon 2 was NOT included, as he thought. The package comes with a copy of HTTYDragon one and STICKERS!!!! Read the fine print, 'Racing Game'. Please, please, do not buy this blatant marketing campaign to steal our money and crush simple expectations of viewing a film. Packaging looks like it would contain two side by side disks. It does not. I can't reiterate enough how disappointing this purchase has been. I don't know how I'm going to tell my son. He will be crushed. It was a gift he picked out to share with me.",1420416000,9,604,4.353982300884955
8657649,4,B00KCSJPS8,"My daughter was thrilled with this set and that's what matters.
The racing guide and dragons weren't quite what I expected though. The guide was a simple little book that didn't see to interest my daughter much and the dragons were simply ""paper airplanes"" made on stronger paper and looked like dragons. It made her smile though and that was worth it.",1419811200,2,352,4.693548387096774
8657650,1,B00KCSJPS8,"Packaging Scam. Carfulfully read this isn't both movies. Rip off, 50 dollars for one older movie...",1419292800,7,99,5.25
