8651264,5,B00JJC2JF4,"This goes right up there with ""Boondock Saints"" as far as a Boston crime Epic, the directing and editing are done masterfully and Mike displays experience both in front of and behind the camera. A must watch for any independent film supporter. Original story, and creative plot. Can't wait to see the Equalizer!",1401926400,2,311,4.886792452830188
8651265,5,B00JJC2JF4,"Did you ever try to make a BIG BOX OFFICE FILM with a $300 dollar camera & close to NO budget? Well, Mike O'Dea did just that, and he succeeded!!! This movie is for everyone, especially inspiring independent film makers! Please, keep in mind that Mike wrote, produced, directed, edited, & starred in this film!!! So, with that being said, there are a few minor flaws with the audio/videography quality (in a few scene's), but this can easily be overlooked. Mike, did not have a 100 people working for him on this film, (like most BIG BUDGET film's do), but he made you think he did!!! The music in this film was outstanding as well!!!! Get yourself a copy of ""GHOSTMAN"" and support Mike O'Dea on his new film that he is working on called ""No Signs of injury"" ""!!! -Billy Lydon",1400371200,3,776,4.471830985915493

8651269,5,B00JJC2JF4,"i've seen this movie twice already and like it even better the second time! great indy filmmaking that had a big budget feel.i'd put it high on my list of the best independent films i've ever seen! the overall pace was good,and never drags, with solid writing& acting performances,and it showed the beauty of boston which i know quite well.this is a movie that proves bigger budgets are not what they appear to be and are mostly ego&fluff.the two leads had chemistry,the irish gangsters were believable&entertaining.you have corrupt fbi agents for good measure,moody original soundtrack by composer cory j. adams, and there's a cool 128 min. in-depth director's commentary which should be an inspiration for any fledging filmmaker,and a movie trailer of director mike o'dea's first film ""townies"".you see talent,ambition and a great finished product with this dvd! why it isn't in film festivals yet is beyond me?!!i now own a copy and i'd highly recommend!!!",1398297600,,959,5.153846153846154
