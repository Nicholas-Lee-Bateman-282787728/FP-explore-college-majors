8008395,4,B000198C0U,I am enjoying using it,1439424000,,22,3.6
8008396,4,B000198C0U,Not a bad video for some small basics. Could have used a little less playing and more teaching probably.,1437696000,,104,4.526315789473684
8008397,5,B000198C0U,Easy to learn form.  Great video.  I highly recommend it!,1424390400,,57,4.6
8008398,4,B000198C0U,I like the way Jim takes it slow for us beginners.  I am able to follow along with him.  I had checked him out on You Tube first to see if I could understand and be able to follow him as well as if I like his music.  He is well organized and his lessons are easy to flow.  I will learn a lot from him.  I also like his collection of Ukuleles and his friends showing their strumming techniques.  I have 4 Ukuleles all Concert and am thinking of getting a Tenor Ukulele with low G string (instead of the high G string) for Jazz Ukulele playing. I am working on Hawaiian Ukulele music and a little Jazz and Blues.  I did not know that their is endless different styles of music for the Ukulele.  I have been communicating with Jazz Ukulele players from all over.  All of them are great Jazz Ukulele players.  I am just learning.,1378857600,,825,4.132075471698113
8008399,4,B000198C0U,"Just got a soprano ukelele a few months ago. I learned a lot from watching this video. It is fun playing along with the music presented here and you'll learn some tips and tricks for improving your play. If you're thinking of getting a ukulele, I would say this is a good purchase to go along with it. (Now, just be sure you get a GOOD ukelele - there is a difference!)",1356307200,,369,4.138888888888889
8008400,2,B000198C0U,"I did not like this video.  Too many played songs and not enough instruction.  Very disappointed in it because it gave very little instructions on how to play.  It is mostly Mr. Beloff playing the ukulele like he is in concert.  I was looking for a video that gave me specific instructions.  This was not instructional.  If you are looking to hear someone play the uke, then this is for you.  If you are looking for a ""How To Play"" video this not the one.",1305676800,4,455,4.2823529411764705
8008401,5,B000198C0U,"This video starts with simple strums and chords and then adds more onto what you have previously learned. For a complete beginner,the booklet and the ""Pause"" button will come in handy. If a beginner takes a little time to learn each strum and chord,you'll end up with several songs you can play and sing to. With the techniques Jim teaches and the extensive chord chart in the back of the booklet,you can play most any song from a fakebook. The guest artists that are near the end of the video will inspire you when they show how much you can do with just four strings. Guests are Travis Harrelson-best strummer I""ve ever seen,Ian Whitcomb-great showman and Uke player,and Ponci Ponce-from the old ""Hawiian Eye"" TV show playing a fantastic chord melody of ""Stars and Stripes"".There is a vol 2 ""Joy of Uke"" and it is also a great learning tool for the intermediate player. The guest on vol 2 is the jazz Uke player Lyle Ritz. Lyle reveals how he plays and why he uses certain tunings. Well worth getting with vol 1. Jim Beloff has a line of song books that are really good for any level to learn some songs from. All of his products are high quality and well worth their price. He also sells ""The Fluke"" ukulele from his website. I bought one and am very happy with its tone and playability. It has a very unique shape and construction and you'll get comments about it anywhere you take it.",1249776000,5,1389,4.47244094488189
