7958386,5,B0000633VJ,"I am glad to see that the 4:3 or original version of DBZ is still sold.
Here the english voices are not re-dubbed ( they re-dubbed the voices of majin buu in the orange brick version which is cropped, etc), and the disc offers the original japanese cast.",1392940800,,254,4.3125
7958387,5,B0000633VJ,"After Gohan breaks the Zi sword, an old Kai emerges from the broken weapon. He has some new ideas that may help win the battle. Goten and Trunks have mastered the fusion technique and are ready to fight Buu. Meanwhile, the champ finally grows a pair and goes to fight Buu alone. When he realizes that defeating him is impossible, he resorts to making friends, and it actually works!",1355702400,,382,4.550724637681159
7958388,4,B0000633VJ,"Piccolo has rarely been as funny as during this whole Gotenks thing(down to calling Gotenks Trunten, backing off when the moms insist on nap-time over training). Warning--per the subtitle in Japanese it is not a kiss the 15-generation back Kaioshin wants from Bulma(Vegeta should get to punch Goku over this. Bulma should slap him for the middle-aged bit--after all she's done for the fool!). I prefer watching the subtitles, but my daughter likes the English dub since it's easier, so we often watch the dub with the Japanese subtitles & there are some interesting differences--like the bit where the boys are talking to Piccolo about their fathers in the sub--didn't make it into the dub. Funimation seems intent on keeping the characters less complicated in English than the original Japanese versions if the subs are any indication. Interesting Gotenks has his own personality(cocky as Vegeta & Trunks, but purely Gotenks).",1024099200,2,927,5.1866666666666665
7958389,5,B0000633VJ,"This a great buy, probably the best video of Dragon Ball Z that Funimation has released so far.  It starts with the breaking of the Z Sword and the appearance of Old Kai, who will awaken Gohan's powers in exchange for a kiss from Bulma!  This then leads to the meat and potatoes of the video... The Fusion of Goten and Trunks.  After messing up a few times, Gotenks is formed, perfectly, for the first time!  His voice, Goten and Trunks both speaking at once, sounds very great.  Funimation did a great job on the dub.  This will leave you wanting more and more!",1021161600,2,562,4.355769230769231
7958390,5,B0000633VJ,"Emergence is the 7th and last tape in the Majin Buu saga....I just finished watching my advanced copy. Awesome is a good word to describe it. Awesome simply because Gotenks was in it. The long awaited fusion of Goten and Trunks was successful......after 2 goof ups that created a fat one and a frail one. Now while Elder Kai tries to raise Gohan's power level on World Of The Kais as Goku, Kibito, and Supreme kai look on-Gotenks is unleashed upon Earth and he goes straight for Majin Buu....and gets his head handed to him. Gotenks' enormous ego forces him to rush out before he is ready but one he is back at Kami's Palace...Piccolo is determined to get him ready. Meanwhile the strangest freindship of all time begins as Majin Buu gets a new buddy....MR. SATAN?! After this tape comes the Fusion Saga-Evil Buu, Play For Time, and Losing Battle. So how can you miss the last tape in the Buu Sage and the emergence of Gotenks. Any kid whose attacks include Shine Shine Missile, Hyper Plasma Shortcake, Galactica Donut, and the Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack is alright in my book!",1013731200,9,1078,4.619791666666667
