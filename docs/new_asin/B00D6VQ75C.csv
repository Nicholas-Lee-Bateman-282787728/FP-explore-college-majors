8590142,5,B00D6VQ75C,"Dorothy Dandridge was an beautiful and talented actress that Hollywood doesn't give the respect she richly deserves.  She was the first black sex symbol , very glamorous and beautiful African American woman with nothing but talent.  In this movie she plays a very progressive character that helps James Mason fight the mutineers on the boat they are on. I love Dorothy Dandridge she was Oscar-worthy in Carmen Jones and she is strong and progressive in this role , even today African American women aren't given roles this rich and progressive, this was not a stereotypical role for a white female actress let alone a black female actress.  This has become one of my favorite Dorothy Dandridge roles , Carmen Jones being number one and this is a close second, James Mason is another favorite actor I follow and he and Dorothy Dandridge did at least 3 other movies together.  This is a good movie I highly recommend it.",1444521600,2,918,4.791139240506329

8590144,4,B00D6VQ75C,Certainly held my attention. That was some adrenalin driven climb up the rope by the captain played by James Mason.,1430611200,,115,4.8
8590145,4,B00D6VQ75C,"I liked it only because Ms. Dandridge.  I had none of her work and thought it about time if possible, I start collecting some of it. Ms. Dandridge was such a beautiful lady and and a good actress (ahead of her time) seemed to have had a somewhat rough,life when growing up, and I'm sure as a black actress in Hollywood had it pretty rough time also.  This movie is not upscale as movies go today, not sophisticated.  It is not smart and polished but then you have to take in to account WHEN THE MOVIE WAS MADE,  It was a  good movie and worth watching  .  At any rate if you like Ms. Dandrige and want to support her work buy it.  It will hold you interest. Her untimely death is so sad.  Other stars in this movie was Stuart Whitman and Broderick Crawford.  Try it.",1422662400,3,766,4.149659863945578
8590146,4,B00D6VQ75C,"It takes place aboard an old tramp steamer. Murder, conspiracy and the will to survive. Broderick Crawford usually remembered for rolls as a police officer but in the film its interesting to watch him as the bad guy. He pulls it off wonderfully the true mark of a real actor. James Mason is equally great in this must see movie.",1419033600,,328,4.483333333333333
8590147,4,B00D6VQ75C,"While I can't , in good conscience , write that this is a great , taut thriller , i'll readily acknowledge that I enjoyed it and had no difficulty sticking it out . First off , the cast is swell . James (Mandingo) Mason , Stuart (Shatter) Whitman and Broderick , bellowing , thrice married Crawford are several of the folks you'll recognize from stuff .
A couple of the fellas on a commercial ship full of things are malcontents (you know , like some of your co-workers) and try to persuade the rest of the crew to do naughty things . Sabotage and mutiny and so forth . One fella in particular is a really bad apple who appears to be a shiny piece of fruit on the outside .
Jim's character is transferred to said ship and given it Captaincy (his first) after the boat's first Captain dies under mysterious circumstances .
The ship needs a cook too as the old cook bails after that nefarious death and does so before James is tapped to helm .
It's a sour crew with poor moral and the aforementioned dirt bags .
Anyway , things get weird and smarmy and the new cook's wife is super hot and there's knife throwing , etc . Will the new Cap and his officers save the day ? Find out . They say it's true too . Warner Archive Instant .",1411689600,4,1228,4.163865546218488

8590149,3,B00D6VQ75C,"Obviously, this was an MGM ""B"" movie at the time, but it's an exciting movie with a very good cast. Dorothy Dandridge was always wonderful but overlooked as an actress. Her ""Carmen Jones"" is a triumph. Crawford is his typical bad guy with an assist from Stuart Whitman. Good movie, but not great.",1387065600,2,296,4.60377358490566
8590150,5,B00D6VQ75C,"It was gratifying to watch this great movie again after some 40 years. What a crying shame that such classics have been ignored by the home movie distributors for so long. More of this quality, please, instead of the usual rubbish released today.
Many thanks, Alan G. Clark",1374192000,2,273,4.708333333333333
8590151,2,B00D6VQ75C,"It's a shame Dorothy Dandridge couldn't do better than this cheap ""B"" movie after her Oscar nomination for ""Carmen Jones"" but Hollywood had no starring roles for a beautiful colored girl in the 50's. (Actually, Halle Berry hasn't fared much better in the 21lst century!)

Dorothy is beautiful and ever and has a a couple of scenes that focus more on her dramatic skills than her bust and booty, but non-Dandridge fans will probably will probably pass on this b & w shipwrecked sea farce.

This is the second film Dorothy Dandridge and James Mason were cast in the same film.  However, unlike the ""Island in the Sun"" (1957) interracial fiasco the two stars appear in the same scenes and actually talk to each other in ""The Decks Ran Red"".  I love it when he tells her to wear something ""less revealing"" yet she comes back with a new blouse left unbuttoned to enhance sex appeal for an unappealing movie that should have washed overboard.",1372636800,2,936,4.654545454545454
