7866862,4,6304197241,"The first film, ""Death in Venice, Ca"" is well-done and sexy to watch, but it is also boring and pretentious. ""Achillies"" is a major, accomplished work. ""My Polish Waiter"" is a really dry, funny, understated comedy, that's pretty sophisticated for a gay film.",972432000,3,258,5.023255813953488
7866863,1,6304197241,"Low art. Just because you feel something vague about your vague life, doesn't mean you can start the camera running and create satisfying art. (1) Death in Venice Beach, CA seems just a knock-off re-telling of Thomas  Mann's novella without inspiration, just with carbon-copy-catting. (2) My  Polish Waiter: the waiter is inarticulate and static, his infatuated  would-be lover flies awry all around him, what does this become except a  true portrait of--unreal romantic obsession? True but blah. (3) Miguel:  this does show the character moving from clinging dependency, toward mature  self-respect--but not artistically with foreshadowing, just at the end  after unrelated plot. (4) The puppet-drama about Achilles and Patroclus was  scenic, anyhow. See instead Boys Life I and II, even Boys Shorts, Boys  Briefs? I was so unimpressed by Boys in Love (1) that I returned Boys in  Love (2) to the rental store unwatched.....",952387200,16,925,5.317241379310345
7866864,2,6304197241,"I usually like this films that no one else likes, but this collection just sucked. All the acting was terrible. The only short that was worth it was that last one. It actually had a story and some cute characters. The others  were just stupid. They were the kind of stories that only happen to people  in short films like these.
Also, they didn't have very cute actors. I  mean, if you're gonna have bad acting and stupid stories you should at  least have some cute guys without that much clothing on to hold some  attention from the audience. The cover of the video is very misleading.
I  was very disappointed with this collection of short films, except the last  one, it was cute. I say get ""Boys' Life"" 1 & 2. Those are far  better than this series.",951091200,16,753,4.366906474820144
