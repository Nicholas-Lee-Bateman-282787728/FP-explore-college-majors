8241900,5,B0011MPHTU,"I used to watch this on public television when I was first married & bought my first VCR for the sole purpose of taping it off TV ... and those bums never showed it again.  I spent years hunting for it & finally did, paying $35 for a video tape over 30 years ago.  Then DVD came along & I copied it to DVD, but that died.  Bless my step mom, she bought me a brand new copy.  I estimate that I have seen this movie over 500 times (I watch it at least twice a month) and it's still as fresh & funny as the first time.  A classic from the golden age of British comedy, even better than Peter Sellers et al in ""the Lady Killers""

The primary cast is Mrs. Cragg (Peggy Mount),  Colonel Whitforth (Robert Morley),  Harry H. Corbett as James Ryder.  Mrs. Craig (a cleaning lady) & her friends who with Col. Whitforth's knowledge form a group to do insider trading (long before this term was coined)  The information comes from the trash from the cleaning ladies.  A secondary plot is about Mrs. Craig & her friends completely thwarting Jim Ryder from tearing down their homes & building  high rise office space.  My favorite line is at the very end when Jim Ryder discovers just WHO these women are & he explodes ""why you old b.......""  Mrs. Craig smiles & says ""Mr. Ryder. flattery will get you nowhere"".  I have used this line effectively in a few arguments myself  .... shuts people up IMMEDATELY.

I have even loaned this out to some commodities traders that I know & they loved it, saying much of this was true!!! --couldn't believe that when I heard it.  This is on You Tube for you to check it out to see if you really like it.",1430352000,2,1627,4.244299674267101
8241901,5,B0011MPHTU,"I saw this movie, for the first and only time, as a child - on one of those rare Saturday nights when Mom and Dad let me stay up late.  So, with many promises that I would not complain in the morning and get up and do all my chores, I settled my 11-year old self down and laughed at those strange English accents and at a cast of character actors that you don't see together in movies anymore.  I have always carried that movie around in my memories and before the advent of computer stores like Amazon, I could only hope it appeared on TV, once again.  Unfortunately, that never happened. So flash ahead 40-some years and you find me looking for this movie and other old favorites, every year or so, on Amazon and other sites.  You can't imagine how thrilled I was when I typed in the title yet again and POOF! - there it was - my childhood memory on DVD.  Five days later it arrives - like time machine magic - and I settle myself down to watch, hoping the years haven't distorted this treasure of my past.  It was wonderful!  Although the years had rewritten the story in my mind - it was better than I remembered.  For now, I could really appreciate the humor and that unknown element of childhood called satire.  Now I just have to find that British comedy/spy movie about women code-breakers during WWII.  I have flashes of memory about interviewing candidates with anagrams and word games at a bus stop and an unforgettable scene involving break times in a padded room - but alas, my childhood memories do not furnish me with the title.  Who knows? - someday it could happen. My old friend ""Ladies Who Do"" seemed like a dream and that came true.  Thank you, Amazon.",1287446400,4,1672,4.375404530744337
