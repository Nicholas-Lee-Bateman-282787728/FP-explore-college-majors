8623394,4,B00GHUFABQ,"Charlie Chan at Treasure Island, 1939 film

A four-engine Clipper flying boat flies through a storm. Jimmy Chan walks the aisle. One traveler wrote a mystery novel. Paul Essex gets a Radiogram. There is a Worlds Fair at Treasure Island (by San Francisco). Something is wrong with Paul Essex! Where is Pauls briefcase with his novel? Pauls wife Stella is there to meet him, Charlie tells her the bad news. Charlie is pushed into a taxicab with two men; this is a joke. The SFPD greets him. A magician is there, he exposes fake mystics. Chan hears about a Dr. Zodiac, a mystic. Chan is given a warning message! Chan goes to see Dr. Zodiac with two men, a reporter and a magician. Chan asks Dr. Zodiac to communicate with a departed friend. Objects float in the air! Then a voice answers Chan. The reporter asks questions about a girl, and is given an answer. The autopsy of Paul Essex showed poison in his stomach; murder or suicide?

Jimmy Chan found Gregory, a passenger on that Clipper, who then disappeared. They visit the Hawaiian Village at Treasure Island and meet people. Mr. Gregory arrives. Rhadini the magician introduces Eve Cairo, the mind reader. She cant predict the future. Someone there is thinking murder! A thrown knife narrowly misses Charlie! Charlie goes to Dr. Zodiacs house. Two men join him; so does Jimmy Chan. Charlie shows how the special effects work. A man enters with a pistol, he is disarmed. Charlie found a mask and robe from Dr. Zodiacs disguise. There is a hidden room with a safe. It has files with information on people. There is a file on Paul Essexs past. Charlie destroys the files with scandalous information. Back at their hotel they get a visit from Mr. Gregory; he is a detective from an Insurance Company investigation suicides.

Charlie is one step ahead. He then reads from a manual on psychiatry and has a plan to expose Dr. Zodiac. They find the missing last page of Paul Essexs manuscript. There is a crowd at the Theater of Magic. The police guard the entrance. Rhadini performs his magic tricks. He calls for witnesses. Dr. Zodiac arrives at the theater. A magician can duplicate any trick of a psychic. An arrow hit Dr. Zodiac in his heart and killed him! Charlie wants to know where people were on the stage. The trick is repeated, but Rhadini is wounded by a knife. Jimmy wears the magicians coat and finds objects that generate laughter from the audience. Miss Cairo will read minds. She says Dr. Zodiac is there in the theater! They catch Dr. Zodiac! Did you suspect the solution? What a surprise! Obvious clues are often deceptive says Charlie Chan.

This is an interesting story as long as you don't question its premises. The limited scenery tells of a lower budget production. One comment at the beginning is a clue to the solution but you won't understand it until the story ends. It is a warning about trusting mystics who look into a persons background for a source of blackmail. The story keeps your interest until the end. It has its quota of comedy for entertainment.",1484092800,,3033,4.663551401869159
8623395,4,B00GHUFABQ,"Please purchase this as part of' Charlie Chan Volume 4'.
With that 4 movie box set you get fantastic commentary and old period footage on each of the 4 movies.
'Honolulu' , 'City of Darkness', 'Reno', and 'Treasure Island'.
I feel the extras are worth the price!
Learn about the making of 'City' right before we got into WWII. And then learn about 'Reno'. What one
had to do to get a divorce there. Something I did not think of Reno for. I think - Reno/Gambling.
But my favorite commentary was on 'Treasure Island'!
My goodness, the great commentary on the worlds fair there in '39/'40. And the film footage!! Superb. What nostalgia.
BUT the commentaries again are on the the 4 disc set - ""Charlie Chan Vol 4"". So add $20 to your price for this film and get the box set.
That I would give 5 stars!!!",1445385600,,799,4.369127516778524
8623396,3,B00GHUFABQ,"I found the quality of this DVD to be quite good, very clear translation to disc.  Good sound.  The movie is also decent for what it is---A white guy playing a Chinese detective, because there weren't enough Chinese actors in Hollywood.  That must be the explanation...  The story is well told, it's funny in parts.  And it certainly has a sense of period.  Those hoping for Hollywood quality filmed images of the Golden Gate Exposition on Treasure Island though will be mostly disappointed, on two counts:  Aside from the fly-over at the beginning, supposedly in a China Clipper, you don't really see much of the fair at all---the movie is all done on a backlot (unlike its predecessor, which was most unusually shot in Honolulu).  And, while the black and white is gorgeous, the fair was noted for its colored light show at night.  I never expected to see even a glimpse of Sally Rand's Nude Ranch, so I wasn't disappointed there either.  Still, it's a fun film.",1435536000,,964,4.684523809523809

8623400,5,B00GHUFABQ,"I saw SO many Chan movies growing up, but this is the one I remember most of all and what made me purchase the DVD set.  I have pleasant memories of watching these when I was a child---even though they are far from political correctness---so now they make me flinch a bit with the inherent racism in regard to Asians and African Americans.  However, I do like the Confucian principles that Chan adheres to and how he detects rings around the police who slight him.
I think they're fairly good mysteries and find it fascinating how the movies riff off of the six Earl Derr Biggers novels.  They are also an interesting and educational look at the times in which they were filmed.",1396828800,,678,4.495934959349594
