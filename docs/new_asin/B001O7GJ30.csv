I purchased this for a friend  so don't really know the quality or content of the DVD.  This is the 1st time I have purchased anything through Amazon and was quite pleased with the process.

But it is a great  film to review, especially if you just want to be reminded of the fabulous gardens that you once visited.  The price is very low & a fairly good value.",1359158400,,258,4.03921568627451
8329858,5,B001O7GJ30,This video made my mother's 80th birthday very special.  She has wanted to go to Butchart Gardens for a long time but is just not feasible for her now.  This video not only gave her an opportunity to see the gardens but also gave some great history of the gardens.  She loved it and now she can go back any time and see these most interesting and beautiful gardens.,1343088000,,365,4.260869565217392
8329859,5,B001O7GJ30,"The really is a wonderful video of Butchart Gardens.  The garden is telling it, and it is presented well.  I bought the video when I visited the gardens and since have shown it at my house, before a tea I had for my aunts, and I hope to show it to my woman's group at church.....",1251504000,,279,3.9642857142857144
