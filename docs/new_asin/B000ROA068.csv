2871431,5,B000ROA068,"I consider myself at an intermediate-advanced level of fitness.

Another good weights workout by this instructor with same non-annoying ""backup dancers"" as other workouts.  Camera work good, music decent.  I always find the backdrop rather strange and ""let's put on a play"" like or something but minor con.

Step is used to up intensity for basic moves like squats, repeater knees, tricep pushup (great) and to use as a weights bench (also great.)

Mostly just free weight work with a little ab work at the end.

Tough but good.",1314230400,5,528,4.876404494382022
2871432,5,B000ROA068,"This is one of the best all body workout videos I have ever bought.  I have a rotation of about 8-10 full body workout videos, and I have done this one over and over for about 2 weeks now since I got it.  It hits every body part, and hits it hard!!  All in one hour.",1280707200,6,266,3.7142857142857144
2871433,5,B000ROA068,"I was addicted to the Firm, but the newer workouts include so many compound exercises that I keep injuring myself. This is a great workout with some new moves. You need a step, mat and 2 sets of lighter weights (I use 5 & 8). It is well paced and challenging enough that doing it once every week or two gets me sore every time and I workout 3-4 times per week. I also think this workout goes by really fast, which keeps it in the rotation.",1275868800,7,439,4.057471264367816
2871434,5,B000ROA068,"This is an interval workout for intermediate-advanced.  Kelly uses a step, light and heavy weights, and a floor mat. During the sculpting, she picks up the tempo, so at times it can be fast-paced, which can make you work harder!  In this DVD, Kelly uses athletic moves for the lower body during the interval sets, which is a major reason why I like her strength & cardio/interval DVDs so much.  She also has new, interesting moves that I look forward to.  Although, I enjoy many of her DVDs, I sometimes find her speed, posture, certain execution of her moves with weights questionable!  Especially with her DVDs, I go on my own pace and move according to my safety concerns when lifting weights.  On a more creative note, check out the options in the menu, especially the ""Coffey Mixes""--I'll take an expresso, please (no warm-up! straight to work...)",1262131200,5,852,4.761904761904762
2871435,5,B000ROA068,"Kelly Coffey-Meyer is a high-energy instructor who offers fun workouts which blend more traditional exercises with unique, interesting twists. NYC is a 54-minute full body strength workout which uses two sets of dumbbells (light and heavy) plus an optional step; Kelly works out in a bright studio with two background exercisers. For the most part, the workout follows a specific pattern: Kelly targets a single upper body muscle group with several exercises using weights, moves on to an unweighted lower body interval, repeats a second set of the upper body moves, and concludes the series with slightly different lower body exercise. Overall, Kelly moves very quickly through the workout--the lower body exercises in particular are performed quickly enough to keep your heart rate in an aerobic zone.

Kelly begins with a 4-minute warm-up that includes basic aerobic moves and ends with dynamic stretches. The first muscle group is back, starting with traditional 1-arm rows. More unique are the alternating shoulder blade pulls (palm up, thumb moves to the rear) and the back raises with slow lowers. For lower body, Kelly does a side squat and rear lunge off the step; after repeating the back work, she does just the rear lunge, moving into a double-time count. The next exercise group biceps, starting with hammer curls that lower to the side. Kelly then does half bicep curls high and low, adding a 1-arm move to both. The leg series is a side step with a curtsy dip, adding a knee raise to work the obliques. The biceps are repeated, and then it's a side-to-side step with a rear lunge.

Moving to lighter dumbbells, Kelly starts the shoulder work, beginning with a circling lift overhead. She then combines shrugs with an upright row and finishes with a butterfly elbow lift and overhead press. The leg move is a wide squat with a knee lift to the side and then the back; after another set of shoulders, the leg move changes slightly to an around the world leg lift with rear lung. Next comes triceps: French press, elbow touches, and dips with pulses. Then, straddling the step, you do a plie squat, this time keeping the weights in your hand; to finish, you repeat the triceps and then perform the plie squat with the opposite leg forward. Kelly concludes the standing work with an additional move for the legs, a bent-over squat with hands on the step.

The workout then moves to the floor (lying on the step/bench) for chest work, which includes pullovers, wide grip bench presses, flyes, and close grip bench presses. Kelly next performs a series of abs work with basic crunches before repeating the chest moves. She finishes this series by moving the dumbbells to hips for pelvic raises to target the glutes/hamstrings. She then moves to the floor for additional abs work. These moves were more Pilates-like and thus more challenging: Kelly starts with a 4-count crunch but then does knee tuck-ins (adding rotation), roll-ups, and half roll-downs with a twist on the end. Moving to side-lying position, she performs a short but tough series of hip/outer thigh work on both sides, then repeats the floor abs series. Finally, Kelly concludes the workout with a very short (about 3 minutes) stretch on the floor, first lying for the lower body and then seated for the upper body.

The Main Menu of the DVD offers the following options: Introduction, Start Workout, Workout Options, Coffey Mixes, and Credits. The Workout Options is basically a chapter list (Warm-up, Standing Exercises, Chest to Lower Ab's [sic], Chest to Glutes, Abdominals to Outer Thighs, More Ab's [sic] and Stretch). The Coffey Mixes menu offers several shorter premix options:

Expresso [sic] Mix (no warm-up, 1 set of all exercises, stretch)
Latte Mix (warm-up, 1 set of all exercises, stretch)
Mocha Mix (warm-up, upper body, abs, stretch)
Capucchino [sic] (warm-up, all legs, abs, stretch)

Overall, I enjoyed this workout very much. I did have a few minor issues with it--eg, I thought that the triceps were overworked, and I didn't like the first abs series of basic crunches--but in general, I found the moves to be enjoyable, and I felt thoroughly worked out by the end. Kelly is a fun yet no-nonsense instructor; I give this workout a final rating of 4 1/2 stars, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it--it is especially well-suited for intermediate-level exercisers.",1238544000,4,4362,4.952185792349726
2871436,5,B000ROA068,"I typically lift heavier. Yet this workout challenges me. It is an enjoyable, never waste a minute, interesting low-weight strength training workout. Nothing goes on for what seems like too long (no repping to death dread) and yet you muscles are pushed to their endurance limit. Kelly is the queen of getting it done without needing to drag out a ton of equipment and yet her workouts are so effective. She also has the most original and fun ways of working the abs and sides of the waist.",1236988800,17,490,4.579545454545454
2871437,5,B000ROA068,I'm a big Kelly fan. This one is an excellent cross train/interval workout moving between upper and lower body leaving you with a great overall worked-out feeling including getting your heart rate up. I own several of her DVDs and I love them all.,1224115200,9,247,4.636363636363637

2871469,4,B000ROA068,"This workout is great for toning.  It combines some light cardio with leg, arm, and ab exercises.  It is a tough workout for the arms!

2871471,5,B000ROA068,I really do enjoy this workout-Kelly includes some moves that I had never seen before and I couldn't wait to do this dvd again! Some of her cardio moves in other dvds make me feel like an uncoordinated gorilla(Boot Camp&Cardio Quick Fix)but her strength workouts I really do enjoy. The only 2 I did find dull were Split Sessions and Your Best Body.,1393286400,2,348,4.5396825396825395

2871473,5,B000ROA068,"This is a great, well balanced workout that includes upper body strength training with higher weights, but also some cardio and a challenging abs routine.

2871474,3,B000ROA068,i have another of kelly's weight training dvds which i adore.  this one gives you a great workout but is rather boring.  didn't find it as interesting or varied as the other one i have but suffice it to say for a good workout i will continue to do it.,1356912000,2,251,4.0
2871475,4,B000ROA068,"I have found this DVD to be a tough workout that makes me sweat.  There are a couple of moves that I can't sustain for the whole time, but if something gets to be too much I just stretch until they complete the section.  I am 57, but used to exercising.  Kelly Coffey-Meyer is pretty good with cuing, and she is motivating.  On the menu you can choose different workouts for parts of the body. The sections are cut from the main workout which makes them kind of odd and abrupt. The exercises seem pretty safe if people use common sense. One problem for me is that Kelly jumps into the moves without much preparation for the viewer.  Hopefully after awhile I'll be able to anticipate the moves better. Another complaint I have is that the background is kind of low-budget looking. Instead of a barn door look, it would have been better, in my opinion, to have something simpler.  The Xs look cheap and they are distracting for me.  Overall, though, the DVD is good and I hope to use it many times in the future. I really like the fast-paced music! I might check out another of her workouts because she is very likeable.",1333756800,3,1118,4.398058252427185

2871477,5,B000ROA068,I have had this dvd for over 6 months and it is very good.  Daily use is the norm.  My favorites are the legs premix and the total remix. Superb for getting the heart rate up. Use it instead of elliptical trainer. It will slim down the thighs with daily use.,1328832000,3,258,4.03921568627451
2871478,5,B000ROA068,"Sculpt your total body in about 53 minutes, with circuit training and aerobics.

In this well-paced and fast moving workout, Kelly Coffey-Meyer moves efficiently from one exercise to another .  In general, she alternates between weights and aerobics, and ends in ab work.  It's challenging, without being too intense.

Light, moderate, or medium dumbbells are used, along with a step.  I skipped the step and one may use whatever weight is appropriate for your fitness level and goal.  This is a sculpting workout designed to burn calories, and not a body building workout.
