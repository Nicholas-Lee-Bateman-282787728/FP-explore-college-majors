8125711,3,B000FQW1CE,"I was a bit disappointed with this as I expected more harder teaching from John Paul Jackson.  It was less than an hour, maybe about 40 min. or so.  He stuck too much on on Adam & Eve and the serpent.  I get the point that he was laying the foundation for why this happened and how our authority got taken away and how we can get it back, but maybe I was looking for something deeper and that you do this and this and that to get your spiritual authority back, like certain types of prayers.

This basically seemed like it was a sermon put on DVD with a big price tag.  The props were so simple, basically him using 2 music stands and a microphone stand with cloths draped over them.

I expected maybe a 2-3 hr teaching that spells out this and the 40 min. or so was just too short.  I'm hoping the other DVDs that I've gotten of his aren't in this same line and have a lengthier & deeper look at things.

This really could've just been a podcast except there was a price tag to it.",1308441600,,982,4.051813471502591
8125712,1,B000FQW1CE,"When I am looking for studies into spiritual authority or spiritual warfare I am expecting to have a lot of scripture references - examples in scripture and life examples -

I am not expecting a lecture to explain how the authority was taken away and how God got it back -

This sermon should be more appropriately titled

""How Christ recaptured your spiritual authority"".

You sit and listen for 30 plus minutes to filler verbiage just to conclude.

Jesus took our authority back on the cross; you have authority just live in it!

This is VERY dangerous teaching -

Jesus explains the need for fasting, serious prayer and other actions that need to be taken when dealing in spiritual battles.

Even Jesus himself had to fast and fervently pray when he dealt with powers, principalities and evil like the angry crowds, authorities & demonic forces like legion.

Yes in Christ we have authority but there is definitely more to accessing

& yielding this authority than just ""knowing you have it"".

This title is misleading. There is little substance and no instruction from scripture reference.

Frankly as a Christian I expect more - I challenge John Paul to correct this title. I feel cheated and concerned of his intentions. I DO NOT recommend this CD as a instructional on ""Recapturing your authority""",1173312000,4,1304,4.850678733031674
