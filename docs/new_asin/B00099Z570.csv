8058542,3,B00099Z570,"Colorful and campy, this fifties ""novelty"" is surprisingly accurate on a number of levels. Caesarion is depicted, as well as Cleopatra's obsession with making him succeed to Caesar's mantle. Where Colbert played off the modern women icon and Taylor laid on the sex goddess, Fleming is working her best with what she has. The side line story of her romance with a small time Roman officer, although possible, is distracting and some what silly. The worst aspect of this movie attempt at history is undoubtedly Raymond Burr as Antony whose leaden performance is deplorable.

The technicolor process is at it's finest and Rhonda Fleming is at the very peak of her beauty. The overall budget is slim at best, so the spectacle aspect of this film is marginal, including the poor, yet very creative costuming. One special detail is the ubiquitous dancing girl routine which features a very young and stunningly beautiful Julie Newmar in her first role who appears covered in gold paint during the famous feast for Antony on Cleopatra's barge at Tarsus.

If you are a fan of this period of history, and the many Hollywood takes that have been done upon it, don't miss this one. Little known, little remembered, but little wrong with it either......",1126224000,8,1241,4.904761904761905
