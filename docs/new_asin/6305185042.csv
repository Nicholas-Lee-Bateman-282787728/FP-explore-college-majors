7886096,1,6305185042,"I wasn't pleased with this video. I found it had a very lowbudget, which meant distant shots, unknown actors who really couldn'tact, and lighting that was atrocious. In addition, staging was bad,and you had trouble seeing who was talking. It also had nothing to dowith the Mark of the Beast, 666. It's about aleged conspiracy by thegovernment in UFO's. It's hard to follow and understand. I eventhought the video would be good since it's about alleged gov'tconspiracy, but the moderator whined a lot and spoke in a monotone andwhen scenes would show about something, they would only last a secondand then back to the moderator. Don't waste your money or time on thisvideo. YOU WILL REGRET IT if U do.  END",972345600,4,705,4.8264462809917354
