8526057,1,B0087WU3Z0,"Ugh. The first sword and the sorcerer is great B Movie fare so I was expecting the same from this but in truth this is unwatchable.

It starts with what should be a decent overview of what happened before with a rather well done illustrated prologue. However, they took these cheesy actors and superimposed them over this prologue and it was all just bad. I found the prologue on youtube without the actors and it works MUCH better.

The movie vacillates between cheesy ""good"" and ""just plain bad'. At times the actors clearly look like they are standing in front of a green screen. The story does not flow well at all. Kevin Sorbo actually does a decent job but the writing hampers all the actors.

Acting is all over the place. Some of the actors ""over act"" a bit much.

I think with a better script and maybe even a better director this could have been more fun than it turned out to be.",1486080000,,890,4.375757575757576
8526058,1,B0087WU3Z0,"well to start with the title of the movie is not the sword and the sorcerer 2 It is tales of an ancient empire which I had already purchased now I have two copies of the same movie each with a different title
 when the movie starts playing it doesn't give the title sword and the sorcerer 2 it says tales of an ancient empire  the other thing is the actors that are listed Val Kilmer etc. are not in the movie
the outside of the cassette has the sword and the sorcerer 2 title but that's not what you're getting
if there actually is a sword and the sorceress 2 movie out there than I would like to know where it is.",1469491200,2,615,3.991869918699187

8526060,1,B0087WU3Z0,"I purchased this hoping it to be a continuation of the first Sword and the Sorcerer movie.  Strictly speaking, I suppose it does, however it is not an enjoyable movie to watch.  At the start you have to sit through a lot of dialog of people in front of a green screen.  Once the movie actually gets started (sort of) any rhythm you get is broken up by more dialog.  Many of the scenes you would expect to maybe be interesting are immediately cut short and replaced again, with dialog.  ""boring... boring... oh this might be a cool fight scene.. dialog cuts in... dialog cuts out... fight scene skipped... boring..."" and repeat.

Be satisfied with the first movie and pretend that was all that was ever created, you'll be happier.",1392681600,13,729,4.569230769230769
