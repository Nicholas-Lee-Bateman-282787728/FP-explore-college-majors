8089214,5,B000BN7M98,"""The Lords of Magick"" really needs a proper DVD release with commentaries and interviews. Better yet, it would be perfect for the MST3K revival. Rarely have I see a movie so bad that's this good. It is a cheese lover's dream. Despite being also released in Italy, Brazil, and Poland (where it's known as ""Czarnoksieznicy""), the film is an extreme obscurity today, which is a shame. If you want to own a copy, VHS is your only option.

The premise is simple: two brothers (who just happen to be wizards) from 10th Century England, are transported to modern Los Angeles. Why? It doesn't matter. Just sit back and enjoy the antics of Michael and Ulric Redglen (Jarrett Parker and Mark Gauthier, respectively), which never cease to amuse. When they get to LA, they immediately stumble into a terrible theatrical production of ""The Princess and the Pea"", and misunderstanding the concept of acting, ""rescue"" the princess. This goes well. Between the most hilarious gangland violence ever filmed, the cheesiest spells ever cast, and the worst swordfight choreography ever, this is gold. There's even a broom fight, and you don't see enough of those in today's films! The two manage to befriend a Renaissance fair type, Thomas (David Snow) and his girlfriend, and crash at his place by promising to make Thomas a wizard. (Side note: how tall is the door to Thomas' apartment? Is this a clown house?) Michael, the smart brother, and Ulric, the stubborn, dimwitted brother (who looks somewhat like Lowell George), have many adventures with Thomas, my favorite of which may be the trip to a haunted house. This is less scary than anything MTV aired in the 1980s, with a particularly laughable skeleton with glowing eyes. All this leads us to the identification of the real princess, and you will not believe how the ID is made (hint: it involves a very well concealed scar).

The bad guy in the film is an evil wizard named Salatin (Brendan Dillon, Jr.) who shows up in LA in a Ford sedan. Thomas drives a Ford LTD with white vinyl top, leading me to hope that Ford didn't pay for product placement in this of all movies. There's a swordfight that does not dazzle the senses and everyone retreats to Thomas' place to regroup, where they find an evil demon on television (the most believable plot thread to be sure). After the televised demonic scowlery, they bring the princess to the apartment with magic (chalk, salt, and candles are involved), and since they're at it with the spells, do some paperwork reduction magic while they're at it. (Don't ask.) Ulric gets distracted from business and visits a ""strumpet"". The two of them retire to her room, but hilarity ensues when Ulric goes to the bathroom and doesn't grasp the difference between the sink and the toilet. This actually made me laugh, but not as much as when he became extremely entertained by a toilet plunger and began to wield it like a sword! While Ulric is playing with the plunger in the bathroom, he's possessed by the evil wizard, turning brother against brother, etc., etc.

The plot speeds up quickly from this point: there's a comical squirrel observation scene in a park (!), Michael mistakes a train for an iron dragon, the best skull with glowing eyes effect ever results from requesting Salatin's location from Esmerelda, the fortune teller (Dolores Nascar), and through some rationale that's a bit challenging to follow, the princess agrees to marry Salatin due to Ulric's dalliance on the dark side. The easily thwarted good guys in their yellow Ford (There's no place to park!) find Salatin in a black skullcap with a silver stripe via the power of laughably bad special effects. The film ends in a tag team match in a box-filled warehouse; it's Salatin and Ulric versus Thomas and Michael. There is a lot of cheesy and delicious action, a special guest appearance by a tiger (which I adored), an unexpected death, but intervention from the king that allows it to work out exactly like you knew it was going to as soon as you found out it was magical good guys versus a magical bad guy with a beautiful princess in play an hour and a half earlier.

I absolutely love ""The Lords of Magick"". It has all the qualities that make a great bad movie: it takes itself way too seriously, has a hackneyed premise that's been done a zillion times before in some form or fashion, has subpar acting and direction, and especially in this case has terrible special effects. It's a shame it isn't more commonly available, as I think it's one of the genuinely funniest B-movies from the '80s that I've seen (and that's saying something).

Any film featuring plunger fencing has got to be good, but this one is downright great...for all the wrong reasons.",1489968000,2,4710,4.7530562347188265
8089215,3,B000BN7M98,"Mostly I bought this for its historical value. Nooo, not because it has any relationship to actual history. Nope, I got it just because I'm the guard who gets his heart torn out by the evil wizard in the first two minutes of the film. It's taken me more than 20 years to find a copy of this movie (not that I've been looking all that hard). Beyond that, this is classic 80's late night cheesy movie. I just wish MST3K was still around to lampoon it. Oh well.",1272499200,3,458,4.157303370786517
