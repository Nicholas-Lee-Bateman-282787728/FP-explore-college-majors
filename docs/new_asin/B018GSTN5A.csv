7548337,5,B018GSTN5A,"Columbia's ""The Shadow,"" released in 1940, was the first serial directed ""solo"" by James W. Horne, who with Ray Taylor had co-directed ""The Spider's Web"" two years earlier.  There are many similarities between The Shadow and The Spider, also common to The Green Hornet and Batman, including a ""wealthy young man about town"" whose crime-fighting secret identity might not be appreciated by the police.  In the serial, Lamont Cranston (Victor Jory) is a ""scientist and criminologist"" though still apparently without any dire need to work to support his activities.  He is aided by his ""secretary and lab assistant"" Margot Lane (Veda Ann Borg), and by his chauffeur, Harry Vincent (Roger Moore).

The plot has a mysterious criminal, ""The Black Tiger,"" trying to gain financial control of the city through a campaign of terror against the leading industrialists.  He has a way to make himself invisible to his underlings, and an easier to explain knack for finding out what the business leaders are planning with Cranston and Police Commissioner Weston (Frank LaRue) at the Cobalt Club, since he is in fact one of its members.

Even in the radio serial Cranston's ""invisibility"" was not physical, but neither here nor in the pulp fiction stories upon which the serial is based does he use ""hypnotic powers to cloud mens' minds so that they cannot see him,"" instead relying on disguises.  His ""Chinese"" disguise as Lin Chang, used to infiltrate the criminal underworld, is absurdly stereotypical, but this is done for theatrical purposes so the audience knows it is Cranston; only the characters in the plot are supposed to be fooled.  Lin Chang operates from the ""Oriental Bazaar,"" where his assistant Wu Yung (Philip Ahn) is always ready to open the hidden garage door allowing the Shadow to escape his pursuers.  Credibiliy is stretched by the abilities of The Shadow to survive explosions and collapsing ceilings, though nothing unusual for serial movie heroes.  While the low budget shows, and some of the cliffhangers are repetitive, this is one of the better Columbia efforts.  Victor Jory is well-suited to the title role, played with a subtle humor not typically seen in serials.  The usual comic approach of director James W. Horne is also evident but less extreme than in his later serials, mostly involving the Black Tiger's bungling henchmen, who include Eddie Fetherston, Jack Ingram, Constantine Romanoff, Charles King, Dick Botiller and Kit Guard.  The music by Lee Zahler is, like the comedy, not always the best fit for the action, but it usually serves the purpose well enough and is a distinct improvement over what was used in ""Mandrake the Magician"" a year earlier.

The serial was released by Columbia/TriStar on VHS in 1997, their number 72693, with sharp image and good gray scale, having only a few places showing film deterioration.  The sound, on the Hi-Fi track, is clear with little noise and low distortion.

Update, 12 May 2016: This review was originally written for the DVD from Hodgepodge/ATI (see below), apparently no longer available.  The new one from Mill Creek is much better, from Columbia's video source, without a videotape head-switch glitch, and with Columbia's copyright present.  It is highly recommended.  While still having all 15 chapters on a single disc, it is double-layer and compression artifacts are not obvious; none of the jerky action seen in the earlier DVD.  Picture and sound are both very good, given the minor issues with the source print.  Chapter 8 ends with the newer ""Sony Pictures Television"" logo, in color, a little jarring but the other chapters have the older one with ""Columbia Pictures Television"" as did the VHS tape.  The release even has some DVD ""chapter marks"" within the serial's chapters, making it easier for the ""last week"" intros to be skipped, if desired.

I retain the following for ""historical"" purposes:

The DVD edition sold by Hodgpodge is identified as being distributed by ATI, AudioTape Inc., of Longbranch, New Jersey.  There is a note on the cover that the ""Works presented on this DVD are in Public Domain"" and the source appears to be Columbia's VHS edition, minus the chapter end credits for ""Columbia Pictures Television, a SONY Pictures Entertainment company.""  Legal or not, the transfer leaves a lot to be desired, mostly from cramming nearly five hours of video onto a single-layer DVD-R, confirmed by the 4.5 G-byte size of the ""VIDEO_TS"" directory.  This results in a number of digital compression artifacts, including jerky motion, ""checkerboard"" transistion between scenes and splotchy areas especially in darker parts of the picture, though the sharpness and contrast aren't too bad.  The sound is adequate, and reasonably synchronized with the picture, but it has more noise than the Hi-Fi track of the Columbia tape.  The menu works properly, and the price is not unreasonable for a small-volume distributor, so I'll resist the temptation to rate the DVD at less than the 3-star ""OK"" level.

Fortunately, Mill Creek has come to the rescue, with a good, and honestly-sourced DVD release.",1386374400,29,5093,5.07923169267707
7548338,5,B018GSTN5A,An excellent Columbia serial with Victor Jory playing  the Shadow quite well. Plenty of action and very campy. One of my favorite serials.,1386115200,3,138,5.0
7548339,4,B018GSTN5A,As a kid I used to listen to the Shadow on the radio and was one of my favorites.  Now I find an actor Victor Jory was The Shadow.  This man is indeed great.  This 15 Chapter play is packed with a lot of action and mystery.  Jory's laugh is perfect in this roll.  This is the only entry in this genre that was done as the Shadow.  I found the price to be very reasonable and would buy from this Seller in the future.,1369612800,3,416,3.835294117647059
7548340,3,B018GSTN5A,Story was great but video quality was rough. Did watch entire series  and enjoyed the way special effects were employed in thise days.,1367539200,14,134,4.826086956521739
7548341,5,B018GSTN5A,"OK, this is the Shadow, but without the capability to ""Cloud Men's Minds"".  Instead, he is an action hero, running around in a black cape, and getting physical with the bad guys (often fighting 5-6 at a time.).  This features a fairly young Victor Jory as the Shadow.  Prior to watching this chapter play, most of my memories of Jory were of an older man, usually the villain.  I believe he was still acting into his late 80s, or even 90s. Anyway, this one is a lot of fun, and well worth watching.  This is also a pretty good copy, considering the serial is over 70 years old.",1366761600,3,577,4.305555555555555
7548342,5,B018GSTN5A,"If it weren't for the budget and story line limits holding back this production, this could have been the best Shadow ever seen on the screen.

As it is, Victor Jory looks and sounds like the real thing and the costume is pretty good as well. However, writing is poor and he doesn't get much to work with. Almost all of the key characters from the Shadow team show up, but not many of them get to do anything. The cliff hangers are repetitive and not very clever. How many times can a ceiling cave in on you without your getting even a scratch?
Unfortunately the typically racist oriental disguise should and does take away from the enjoyment for a modern audience. Hopefully, everyone will be embarrassed by that.

Still, for fans of the old serials, this is fun to watch and even more fun to speculate on what may have been.",1362441600,2,826,4.427631578947368

7548345,4,B018GSTN5A,"when you get right down to it, it's enough fun to justify the purchase, but you should be prepared for a few imperfections...
we begin with the most obvious, the one it's most surprising and/or impressive that they managed to rise above. for some bizarre reason, the Shadow's trademark ability, the feature that made him unique, was always overlooked by filmmakers at the time. one of the abundant charms of that woefully underappreciated Shadow film from 1994 is that it was the very first time The Shadow's ""hypnotic power to cloud men's minds so they cannot see him"" was depicted on film, or indeed anywhere but the radio series. (yes, it was absent from the accompanying ""pulp"" novel series as well.) i suppose you could argue that since that power was meant as a sly nod to the fact that radio listeners couldn't see him either, it was somehow less ""apropriate"" on film. but that's meadow muffins, and you know it! being invisible is to The Shadow what flying is to Superman, and something will always be missing without it.
(just to drive the perversity of the logic home, here it's the villain, known as The Black Tiger, who is able to render himself unseen.)
another thing to consider is it's treatment of the familiar characters. in this case Lamont Cranston has been transferred from ""wealthy young man about town"" to scientific criminologist, and Margot Lane is his lab assistant. curiosly, it also features Harry Vincent. in the novels, Vincent was The Shadow's sidekick until the radio series displaced him with Margot. so someone is redundant here.
(intriguingly, Vincent is played by one Roger Moore. not to be confused with the actor who, malicious gossip notwithstanding, is the definitive James Bond, James Bond as God, and more to the point, Ian Fleming, intended. (i wasn't gonna stoop to that, but somebody had to say it.))
another odd departure from the norm is that Cranston has another alter ego as well, in this case an Oriental named Lin Chang. ""Chang"" serves as a sort of spy amongst The Black Tiger's thugs every so often. again, it's not clear what this angle is necessary for, but there's still fun to be had with the character.
the principle criticism seem to be that there are a few scenes of The Shadow in broad daylight, which is at odds with the inherent mystery of the character. but fortunately there are only a few such scenes.
but enough beefing. as i've stated, just enough about it works. our star, Victor Jory, has a field day with his triple role. he somehow manages to transcend the limitations of this numbed version of The Shadow, and he demonstrates apt character actor skills with Chang. (even if he is about two feet taller than any Oriental i've ever seen.) most intriguingly, he somehow manages to make Cranston's change of profession seem completely fitting. having the same profile as the customary illustration(s) of The Shadow doesn't hurt, either. i've heard that Jory's is genrally considered to be the single finest film portrayal of The Shadow.
the anonymous villain with his army of followers has become a bit of a cliche' (already had by 1940, i suspect), to say nothing of the goal of conquering the city being frankly generic, but somehow the person calling himself The Black Tiger manages to transcend that limitation. there's actually something that stays with you in his mystique, and the voice used for the role is quite foreboding as well as marvelously cheesy.
does this Shadow know what evil lurks in the hearts of men? it's hard to say, since the subject never comes up. (seriously, that catchprase question is never spoken.) sufficed to say he knows enough to meet, if not necessarily exceed, Saturday matinee standards.",1341792000,28,3692,4.834123222748815

7548349,5,B018GSTN5A,"After several black market dupes I have finally acquired a legit copy of The Shadow serial. The picture and sound are of extremely good quality.

I read several reviews that complained that there was no clouding of men's minds. That didn't concern me as it was not part of the original pulp novel lore.
I would, however, have loved to hear the ""Who knows what evil......"" tagline.

Hawk-nosed Victor Jory was well suited as The Shadow and although not entirely PC quite entertaining as Lin Chang, his Asian alter ego.

7548352,4,B018GSTN5A,"Only reason for not 5 star is I was surprised that this Shadow version didn't have the ability to cloud men's minds & so be invisible. Instead it goes to the villain: The Black Tiger. I recall in the original series Cranston, as the Shadow, would say: ""Who knows what evil lurks in the mind's of men. The Shadow knows"", followed by the laugh. In this Victor Jory version, he only laughs and appears in a black mask & cape. Not really a ""Shadow"".",1491436800,2,445,4.309523809523809

7548355,4,B018GSTN5A,"Radio's ""Lamont Cranston"" had a fine sense of justice, a sly sense of humor, and ""the power to cloud men's minds."" This posed a problem for the screen adaptation, because the movie audience couldn't see the fistfights and headlong action if the hero was supposed to be invisible! So Columbia Pictures decided to pattern THE SHADOW after its smash-hit serial of 1938, THE SPIDER'S WEB. The similarities are striking: in the older serial, hero Richard Wentworth terrorized the underworld as The Spider, vigilante in black hat, mask, and cloak, and infiltrated gangland under a third identity, underworld lowlife Blinky McQuade. The Spider's three assistants were 1) his girlfriend, 2) a stalwart Hindu, and 3) a ready-for-anything driver. The hero must work independently of the police, who think the masked man is himself a criminal. In THE SHADOW, hero Lamont Cranston fights crime as The Shadow, vigilante in black hat, mask, and, cloak, and makes underworld contacts as the shady Chinese character Lin Chang. The Shadow's three assistants are 1) his girlfriend, 2) an Oriental confederate, and 3) a ready-for-anything chauffeur. The hero must carry on his crusade independently of the police, who... you get the idea!

You might be sorely tempted to switch the DVD off after the first couple of chapters, because director James Horne -- formerly one of Laurel & Hardy's top directors -- indulges his fondness for tongue-in-cheek humor (the hammy villain speaks his lines with an overdone sneer; henchman Charles King staggers around after a brawl and collapses; The Shadow sneaks up on some gangsters DISGUISED AS A TREE). You will indeed see a few silly sequences a la Horne, and you may get good and sick of some of the repetitious music cues and the villain's over-the-top ranting (think Truman Capote in ""Murder by Death"" on steroids). Stay with it, because THE SHADOW turns out to be the best of James Horne's solo serials. The pace is fast, the action is exciting, the script has some clever touches and surprises, and Victor Jory is superb in the title role: he has The Shadow's trademark laugh down cold! Fans of Columbia's serials and comedy shorts will recognize many of the locations and backgrounds, and maybe even some of the incidental stock footage! Jory's assistant, Roger Moore, is really Joe Young, Robert Young's look-alike brother.

Serial fans will enjoy this most, and Victor Jory's enthusiastic performance is easily the best part of the show: he really seems to be enjoying himself. This Mill Creek DVD is a big improvement on the Columbia VHS release of 20 years ago; all 15 chapters fit onto a single disc without any loss of visual quality, although you do hear some hash on the soundtrack during moments of silence. Serial fans should grab this while it's still available; it is no longer shown on the manufacturer's website.",1488412800,,2855,4.995798319327731

It detracts from the feel of the episodes.
OK, enough ranting.
Some of these serials from the late 30's to the 50's are a great way to lose yourself from today's busy lifestyle.
I find them relaxing and very enjoyable.
You might even see some familiar faces that went on to star in other shows and movies, like, Philip Ahn from China Sky who also played Master Kan in the television show Kung Fu.
There are many serials on Amazon. Just search ""Cliffhanger Serials"", ""Movie Serials"" or ""Serials"" and you'll come up with many choices.
Don't forget the original Superman with Kirk Alyn and Noel Neil from 1948 and 50. Dynamite stuff.

7548370,4,B018GSTN5A,"""The Shadow"" (1940) bears little relation to the classic radio series. Instead, this 15-chapter Columbia serial wavers between noir atmospherics and delirious physical humor. It makes sense when the director is James W. Horne   the man responsible for some of Laurel and Hardy's best films. Horne stages each chapter like a two-reel comedy, even though Victor Jory keeps a straight face in the title role. Despite its obvious padding and repetition (not to mention several lame cliffhangers), ""The Shadow"" moves at a good clip thanks to Horne's bizarre stylistics.

Still glad I bought it. Will not buy the old Rod La Roque movies.",1390694400,,203,4.230769230769231
7548395,3,B018GSTN5A,"I suppose any disappointment I experienced when I watched this stemmed from my introduction to The Shadow on radio back in the 1940s. Then, each episode opened with ""who knows ... what evil ... lurks in the hearts of men? ... The Shadow knows (followed by maniacal laughter). THAT Shadow could ""cloud men's minds"" and appear to be invisible when it suited him.

This Columbia Saturday serial version (which I don't ever recall seeing in theaters back then) never utters those words and came across more like a black-clad Roy Rogers complete with endless fist-fights and gun battles. Fun, in a campy sense, but not The Shadow that stuck in my mind all these years.",1388448000,9,663,4.765217391304348

8742301,5,B018GSTN5A,"I've always loved the Shadow radio show tapes while driving at night listening to that on a blackened road at night is a unique experience that's for sure, ( try the old Halls of Fantasy's The Shadow People radio show driving at night ). And watching the cleaned up DVD version of the serials is great. the black and white is crisp and the sound is perfect yea the old serials are again fun to watch even on big screen TV's Victor Jory was great as the Shadow as are all the cast members plenty of chases and good old fist fights I think that the whole idea was to destroy everything standing in the room just great fun.",1527206400,,620,4.218487394957983

8742303,4,B018GSTN5A,"Definitely a 5 star serial. Not as good as Captain Marvel, but that's just my opinion. Acting is decent, plot is typical of most serials, but still entertaining. I would have preferred it be on 2 discs with less compression, but the picture is still decent.

The reason I removed a star is a direct result of the Margot Lane character. Her nonsensical, blood curdling screams in response to situations that didn't warrant screams of any sort, really made me cringe. Her scenes really adversely affected the show. These were truly situations where even movie screams made no sense.

One other thing that annoyed me was the cliffhanger repetition. More than half the chapters ended the same way. An explosion and The Shadow being buried in some sort of rubble.",1520899200,3,758,4.823076923076923
