8251660,3,B0013KWT9Q,"I'm a huge Richard Lewis fan and was very excited to get this.  I was hoping for an in depth documentary and a better insight into Richard's life and this DVD didn't really delivery.  The ""documentary"" for lack of a better word was shot several years ago by Richard's manager/agent with her small video camera.  The shots are sometimes shaky and uninspired.  The material they're working with is hardly worth extending into a 60 minute piece.  Had a professional team actually followed Lewis around--we would've gotten a better DVD to enjoy.",1211846400,4,541,4.9010989010989015
