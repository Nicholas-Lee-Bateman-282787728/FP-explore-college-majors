7844356,5,6303365086,"THE PASSERSBY always impressed me. It is an interesting Civil War tale as an endless line of soldiers pass by an onlooker. What battle are they coming from? What is their destination? This thought provoking episode was written by Rod Serling and directed by Eliot Silverstein. James Gregory's performance was most memorable. NICK OF TIME from the Second season aired on November 18, 1960 and was written by Richard Matheson. Traveling newlyweds William Shatner and Patricia Breslin stop in a luncheonette while their car is being repaired. While in a booth an ever-confident Shatner puts a coin into a fortune-telling machine adorned with the bobbling head of a smiling plastic devil. Each question and answer begins to make Shatner question his fate to the point that he becomes unraveled about his future. Thematically this is similar to THE FEVER where just one more coin in the machine may give you solace. This is a fascinating episode that bears repeated viewing just to observe the ease at which one can be drawn in. However, the denouement makes the morality of the story clear.",1380412800,,1086,4.972527472527473
7844357,4,6303365086,"This videotape has one classic episode of ""The Twilight Zone,""

marking the first of William Shatner's appearance on Rod Serling's classic television anthology series.  The other one is a lesser ""Zone"" but with a nice touch at the end that makes it worth watching, but the first one is clearly the biggie here:

Episode 43, ""Nick of Time"" (Written by Richard Matheson, First aired November 18, 1960) stars Shatner and Patricia Breslin as newly weds Don and Pat Carter. The honeymooners are waiting for their car to be repaired in Ridgeview, Ohio when the superstitious Don becomes obsessed with a table top fortune-telling machine that dispense little cards answering yes or no questions (I have seen a web site that gives you step-by-step instructions for making the machine).  Will Don be able to break free from the machine or will he obey its ever ""whim""?  A classic ""Twilight Zone"" episode with a wonderful performance from a rather restrained Shatner (you can even get a t-shirt for this episode with the Mystic Seer and much, much more).

Episode 69, ""The Passerby"" (Written by Rod Serling, First aired October 6, 1961) is a minor tale in which a woman named Lavinia (Joanne Linville) is waiting for her husband to return form the Civil War, but fears he might be dead. James Gregory plays a sergeant who stops to rest and who figures out ahead of Lavinia, but not ahead of the audience, what the twist is to this one. Then again, any story in which Abraham Lincoln shows up has some redeeming quality.",1115856000,3,1509,4.762452107279693
7844358,3,6303365086,"Twilight Zone enthusiasts will enjoy this tale of fortune cookie wisdon gone arye.  A newlywed couple, in the fifties, stop at a small diner and enter the Twilight Zone.  William Shatner stars as the husband, obsessed with the fortune dispensing machine, much to his brides' dismay. Who will triumph, Shatner, or "" Ole Nick "".  A must see episode for Shatner fans.  A frail southern woman, during the Civil War, desparately awaits her husbands return from the battlefield as she watches the ""Passers-By"", on the road at the edge of her property.  The constant dabbing at her brow, with her handkercheif, and her anxious demeanor, arouse suspision.  Through her conversations, with several travellers, she comes to a startling realization.  A predictable, yet worthwhile selection.",989798400,3,780,5.241935483870968
