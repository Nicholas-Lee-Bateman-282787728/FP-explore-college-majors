7983098,3,B00008G8NO,"Of the few films that star ""Dale Apollo Cook"" (real-life kickboxing world champion), most are almost unwatchable except for the action.  Of his films that I have seen, Raw Target actually displays Cook's best overall performance, which isn't saying much.  His acting is usually so bad, but he does ok here, and actually providing a little charcater to the film.  But the biggest reason I bought this movie is for Ron Hall (Bloodsport 2, Triple Impact) who seriously is one of a kind, always displaying an array of impressive acrobatics within his fight scenes.

The story in Raw Target isn't too bad, and digs a little deeper than most martial arts films.  The action is a bit above par, with Nicholas Hill (Bloodsport 2, Fist of Iron, Death Match) providing some good skills as the movie's villain.  Again, Ron Hall breaks out in the end of the film with some good stuff, and Dale Cook does a bit more than his usual self as well.  The villains underground gym is a pretty good setting, where most of the fights take place.

Overall, this is a very average B movie.  At first the picture quailty and sound are horrible, but you get used to it fast.  A lot of cheesiness too, and still bad acting, but compared to lets say ""Blood Ring"" this is much much more watchable.  Get it for the fights if nothing else...and Ron Hall.",1176940800,2,1324,4.544303797468355
7983099,3,B00008G8NO,"This is another very very B-Grade martial arts film but still manages to show some good fights and action with a plot. Johnny Rider (Dale 'apollo' Cook) is a kickboxing champion and accidently kills his opponent in a slug match and is constantly haunted by the death of the other fighter. He is set up and robbed by some criminals while roaming the country side as a drifter and turns to the police. One cop in the department (Ron Hall) was the brother of the fighter that Johnny had killed in the ring match. Johnny is eventually coerced into playing a decoy for a gang of vicious drug dealers and murders who show no mercy to whoever crosses them in an unordely fasion. When he finds out that the kingpin (Nick Hill) is responsible for his brothers murder he only has one thing on his mind...REVENGE! If you like B-Grade martial art movies, I suggest you get this one. Ron Hall is a top martial artist who always shows off his speed, flexibilty and aerial displays all in one motion.",1131321600,,985,4.477777777777778
