3796629,4,B001U3YNMW,"This is a very thorough and well thought-out yoga program.  Even though this video is titled as a Core Power dvd (which it is) it does provide a good overall workout as well.  My only hesitation is the speed with which he runs through the sun salutions in the middle of the workout.  Due to a minor knee disability I cannot move through the sequence quite that fast, and I have never had this issue before with other dvds or in person classes.  I typically can keep up, but for anyone with an injury, disability, or for someone new to the dvd and not quite sure what the next pose will be, it is rather fast moving.",1246924800,3,615,4.230769230769231
3796630,3,B001U3YNMW,"Starter info: I am in my mid-20's, active, flexible from a lifetime of gymnastics and have practiced yoga/pilates at health clubs numerous times...if that helps you to compare what you might get out of this video.

I feel like an idiot, but either I did not notice this DVD advertised as being in Japanese, or it wasn't labeled as such when I ordered it, or who knows maybe I thought it meant ""Japanese-styled Yoga"". Not even subtitles or language options offered, just Japanese. Of course due to a busy work-travel schedule, it was a couple months before I got around to testing it out to realize the mistake and I'm sure that was long after the return-by date.

Anyway - I think it probably would have been a good video in English, it keeps up a good pace and music/setting is peaceful, but it was  hard for me to enjoy it due to craning my neck to watch what they were doing instead of being able to listen and go through the movements I know properly. The people are just in a gray, serene studio: not beautiful beach shots or anything. I personally like a bit of a challenge and don't feel very ""worked"", but again I am active and flexible so it takes a bit more sometimes.

There is an instructional option on the menu too that seems to explain the poses one by one, which is nice for beginners but I did not bother sitting through it.

Also, through the main part of the lesson, there are 3 people to each demonstrate beginners, intermediate, and skilled options with all of the poses which is really nice.",1245715200,3,1513,4.428057553956834
3796631,5,B001U3YNMW,I just finished doing the dvd and it's an excellent buy. The pace is smooth and the explanations are detailed enough that I don't need to look up to the screen often. Plus there is also the option of less detailed workout so that once you know the moves you can just follow the cues.,1244160000,2,283,4.163636363636364
3796632,5,B001U3YNMW,"One of the clearest, easiest-to-follow, user-friendly instructional yoga dvds I've seen.  I like the 3-level approach.  I've given several of these dvds to yoga practicioner friends, and have received nothing but great feedback.",1239926400,,228,5.878787878787879
3796633,5,B001U3YNMW,"Honestly, I am kind of against yoga videos. I've never liked them, never practiced to them, and never connected to them. Until now. Oliver Reinsch is fun! This feels like taking a great yoga class in a studio, not like you're at home being motivated by a stranger. The speed is perfect. The music is soothing. The flow is designed to allow you to practice as intensively as you are feeling that day.

What I also like about this practice is how inventive it is. Oliver does poses that aren't run-of-the-mill poses from your standard yoga practice. And it's an intuitive flow: just when you're thinking, ""Hey, I could really go for a twist right now"" - bam! Twist. He takes care of you, too, by stretching out your wrists and shoulders after working them.

I can't recommend this video highly enough. I could practice to it each and every day, and get something new from it every time.",1239148800,15,884,4.553459119496855
3796634,5,B001U3YNMW,"What you can't really tell in the trailers and reviews for Feel Good Yoga : Core Power is that besides being well thought out with animations and beautiful settings, the DVD is so lighthearted and humorous.  You can practice at an advanced level and follow the level 3 person or take it easy if you want.

But the best thing about it is Oliver's voice which with humor and openness makes you want to do better.  His spirit and voice are very special and great motivators.  He's extremely uplifting.

I also like how it's exactly one hour.

The pose animations will help a lot of people avoid yoga injury.

3796635,5,B001U3YNMW,"simply the best quality yoga dvd i have seen (and i have seen them all!)
high quality for a low price. you can finder cheaper yoga dvd's, but they do not compare to the content, high def images and graphics, and easy on the ears sounds of feel good yoga.

i like having the option of the levels to choose from, as well as being able to choose from detailed instruction (very helpful) and less detailed (nice feature when you are familiar with the class and don't need to hear everything...which gets tedious in other dvd's that don't have this option)

the graphics section is also super helpful for understanding proper alignment in poses and is something i haven't seen in any other dvd out there. i thought i knew some of the basic yoga poses pretty well, but i was able to learn a lot from this unique section.

all in all, this dvd does what it says....it makes you feel good!",1236729600,9,881,4.392638036809816
3796636,5,B001U3YNMW,"Finding a yoga class, paying for it, and then finding the time to actually go can all keep you from the most important aspect: DOING IT!

We've all seen the super cheesy exercise videos advertised on TV. This is not one of them. The presentation is fantastic, the graphics are extremely well done and helpful, and there's lots of good info throughout. You won't get that horrible canned music in the background either, but a very minimalist, lovely score.

There's no ""gimmick"" like trying to combine boxing with yoga or some other idiocy. It's just very pure, very well done, and less than the price of a single class.

Highly recommended!",1236556800,5,640,4.747747747747748
3796637,4,B001U3YNMW,"I consider myself an intermediate level yogi and the flow of this practice was really nice.  I felt I worked hard and felt the benefits of the practice.  I did find myself not knowing which individual to look at...the one on the left is a level 3 (higher difficulty), the lady on the right was level 1 (beginner) and the instructor was level 2 (intermediate).  I found myself looking at all of them to see which level I should be doing according to what my body could do.  It was very helpful but then I found that my breathing would falter since I wasn't sure which pose to do.  I think the more I do this yoga workout, this will become more of a second thought, but thought I'd mention it",1364428800,,690,4.236641221374046
3796638,5,B001U3YNMW,"I wouldn't recommend for an absolute beginner, but I loved it. You definitely know you've done some work with a nice yoga afterglow. The poses were just challenging enough. Definitely will do again and again.",1361491200,2,208,4.9714285714285715
3796639,4,B001U3YNMW,"I would give this five stars - the guided instruction is easy to follow, and it is a good core workout.  The only thing holding it back is that it is a little too easy.  There are pose modifications being demonstrated by one of the other people on stage, but what is really needed are a few more sequences, and the inclusion of more challenging poses.  I have only been doing yoga about a year, but I am athletic and was in good shape when I started.  I still recommend this DVD, and keep it in rotation with several others.",1360540800,,524,4.21
3796640,5,B001U3YNMW,"I love this yoga sequence.  I do a bunch of other power yoga videos each week, but I enjoy this video especially since it is a workout- but it actually DOES feel good.  So many yoga videos don't include any poses that actually feel good.  I hope the producer makes more ""feel good yoga"" videos- not just core power but perhaps a video on upper body strength, back flexibility, hip openers etc.  I would buy them all!",1359417600,,416,4.363636363636363

3796642,5,B001U3YNMW,"this has to be one of my favorite yoga videos! i don't have time to go to a studio on a regular basis so finding good videos to do at home is really important for me. if you like this one you'll definitely like YogaWorks Body Slim. I had been looking for a video with quick transitions to get my heart rate up like the YogaWorks Body Slim video and finally found it when I found this Feel Good Yoga video. This video is on the pricey side but I suppose it is still cheaper than going to a studio, and it's a good video.",1348099200,,519,3.9523809523809526
3796643,5,B001U3YNMW,"Worst bit...feeeel it yeeeaaaa...buy it, you'll see what I mean. When you've controlled your english sniggering and made sure your husband is out as he will snigger this is an amazing yoga dvd.

I really like it and is one I practice with at least twice a week.  There are 3 teachers, from the basic to the more advanced. Oliver is in the middle doing the intermediate. You can have lots of instruction or not much at all which I think is a great idea once you get to grips with the dvd. It's very thorough and really focuses on the breath and the correct alignment. It helps that Oliver's a bit of a hottie too!",1337558400,,612,4.267241379310345
3796644,4,B001U3YNMW,"I have had over 50 yoga DVDs in my collection, and this is one I return to again and again when I truly need a ""feel good"" session.  I bought my second copy a few months ago, after having worn the first one out.  The pace is wonderful, with one of the best warm up and cooldown sequences I've ever seen.  The narration is smooth and soothing, even humorous at times without being smarmy, and having three levels of each pose being demonstrated is inspiring as well as instructional.

I would give this DVDs five stars save for a quality issue that has already been mentioned in several other reviews:  both of my DVDs have had skip problems, in the same section (a brief blip going into cat-cow sequence).  Very minor, but persistant.",1329436800,,734,4.481203007518797
3796645,5,B001U3YNMW,"Very nicely choreographed and fun DVD. If you enjoy Ashtanga yoga you'll like this DVD. The beginner, intermediate, and advanced level options allow you to improve your yoga practice at home.",1329091200,,191,5.193548387096774
3796646,3,B001U3YNMW,"I purchased this video from Amazon Instant Video - very good for someone who is experienced in Yoga.  That said, the writeup indicates there are ""animated pose diagrams"" included.  There exists no such diagrams (at least for the Instant Video version).  Without knowledge of the various stretch positions beforehand, this becomes an exceedingly frustrating video to follow.

1 star for Beginners, and (I'm being generous by guessing) 5 stars for advanced users.  As such, I give it a 3-stars overall.

Caveat Emptor",1321056000,,515,5.219512195121951
3796647,3,B001U3YNMW,"I got this dvd and it wasn't really what I thought it was going to be. I don't understand some reviewers who say it is a power yoga, it is not. There is one section that goes very fast but I didn't seem to build up 'heat', but that is me. Also, in spite of it being labelled 'Core Power', it is *not* a core-focused practice. Sadie Nardini's dvds WILL leave you gasping and humble you if you think that you have core strength, this practice will not. This is not a bad dvd, in fact the production values are head-and-shoulders above 99% of the other yoga dvds out there, but I just found it un-inspiring.",1306022400,,604,4.2155172413793105
3796648,5,B001U3YNMW,"I don't have a lot of time to go to a yoga class, so I depend a lot on videos. This video does not disappoint. While it gives instructions and demonstrations for every level (1,2 or 3) its probably not a good intro video. you should know the names and be at least sort of familiar with basic yoga poses before buying this video. Its not for beginners, but if you know the basics, its easy to follow along, and its a really great workout.",1296345600,,437,4.152941176470589
3796649,4,B001U3YNMW,My recommendation is to buy this DVD. It may not be one you reach for all the time but it is worth having on the shelf. The title is pretty accurate in that it is power yoga and it does make you feel good. So it is not a hard workout but it isn't easy either (I'm talking both stamina and pose difficulty here). Some days it is good to have a routine that isn't too hard on the body or brain but that makes you still feel like you have actually done something - this is it!,1282176000,,473,3.836734693877551
3796650,2,B001U3YNMW,"Content was OK but was hard to focus on due to the poor quality of the ""new"" product shipped to me.  The DVD looked flawless (no scratches or visible imperfections).  When played, there were numerous skips and audio dead spots.  During the final relaxation pose, the DVD skipped back into the middle of the routine, jerking me out of my calm state.  The cover art mirrored the production quality - the colors didn't line up giving the photos a double-vision quality.",1262995200,,466,4.716049382716049
3796651,3,B001U3YNMW,"I have bought quite a few yoga dvds in the last few months, and I bought this one after reading all of the good reviews. The video was good quality,the instructions clear, but that was not enough for me. The practice starts with some stretching on the floor. Personally, I like to start out with some sun salutations to warm my body as I practice first thing in the am. The sun salutations were about 15 minutes into the dvd. They didn't last long and at one point were a little faster than I would have liked. There didn't seem to be a good flow to the workout. Maybe this just wasn't my style. It wasn't as smooth and challenging as I would have liked. I consider myself an advanced beginner as I still have so much to learn. I wish that I could send this one back.",1258934400,3,767,4.1891891891891895
3796652,4,B001U3YNMW,"I am new at yoga, and bought this on a whim after reading the reviews because I wanted a yoga video that was harder work than the dvd I currently have. Feel Good Yoga is great! The middle part really gets me breathing hard so I feel like I am working out (I like to run, and I wanted something to supplement running on cold/rainy days). I also think this instructor does a great job of explaining the breathing techniques throughout the video.

The best part is that there are 3 people doing each of the poses so you can see what each level looks like (also the instructor explains what each level should be doing during each pose) and you can move along at your pace. So you may be level 1 on some poses, level 2 on others, etc. and you can move through the entire video switching back and forth instead of having to switch segments. Also it's nice that there are all 3 levels demonstrated at once so you know what you're working towards.

I don't know a lot about the long-term benefits of yoga exercise because I'm a novice, but I think this video seems to embody the spirit of yoga and I definitely think that I will feel more strength as I continue to use it.",1258156800,3,1164,4.238738738738738
3796653,5,B001U3YNMW,"This is simply one of the best yoga practices I have found in a long long time. I use nearly all of Shiva Rea's DVDs, Maral Hadidi, Core Rhythms, The Firm, Rodney Yee, Jillian Michaels, etc. and FEEL GOOD YOGA by Oliver Reinsch is one of the very best. His pacing and calmness, the music, the simplicity and absence of new age chatter, the focus and discipline and intelligence promoted here is exactly what I was searching for. I hope he continues to produce more practice videos in the near future! -NJ from NYC",1250035200,6,513,4.468085106382978
3796654,4,B001U3YNMW,"Mostly I think I responded to the teacher's sincerity, and the philosopy part was inspiring.  I really went along with it all and never felt over pushed but instead brought along. Its also interesting and complete enough to use over and over.",1249948800,2,242,4.761904761904762
3796655,5,B001U3YNMW,"I like the Feel Good Yoga Core Power DVD.

Pluses:
* Instructor/narrator is in excellent shape, which is very motivating
* There are 3 levels demonstrated, so it's appropriate for beginners through advanced
* There is the option to view poses in detail if you're new or newish to yoga
* There is the option to listen to detailed instruction throughout, or just simplified verbal cues
* The instructor's voice is very soothing and also friendly
* The production quality is very good
* The background music is nice; calming and not cheesy or obnoxious
* The DVD is true to its title; after the pleasant warm-up, there is a faster-paced power segment (although I did not find it too fast-paced, but it would be somewhat intense for a beginner.  This is how we progress.)
* The session concludes with a soothing stretching segment, and a nice, long-enough restorative pose segment

All in all, this DVD would be a great way to energize to start the day, or to unwind after a day at work.  The instructor will from time to time make sort of ""aahhhh"" or ""mmmmm"" noises, which would typically bug me, but during the workout I found that they served to keep me ""in the moment"", realizing that yes, that stretch does feel good, so go ahead and enjoy it.  It worked for me.  This DVD will increase your flexibility and help strengthen not only the core but also the leg muscles (warrior poses +) and arms (down dog, up dog, plank).  Excellent on its own, and an excellent adjunct to other forms of exercise.",1249862400,7,1497,4.563432835820896
3796656,4,B001U3YNMW,This power yoga class is excellent! It is very similar to a power vinyasa flow yoga class that I usually go to. The only thing that sort of bugs me is his moans throughout the dvd when he gets into a pose he likes....a little funny. However even with the moans this is a very challenging and satisfying power yoga session!,1248912000,,322,4.295081967213115
8342853,2,B001U3YNMW,"I am glad I decided to rent this video before buying it. I practice yoga since 2008 and mostly do hatha and vinyasa. I find Oliver Reinsch unconvincing as a yoga instructor as there should be no such things as yoga crunches, yoga bicycle and yoga cardio.

This video is probably good for people who do aggressive fitness and bodybuilding as a stretch program while making them feel they are still getting some exercise out of it but I would not recommend it to yoga practitioners.",1479859200,,480,4.5813953488372094
8342854,5,B001U3YNMW,This is my go-to yoga practice. Challenging and rewarding with good video demonstration. I have this downloaded to all my devices so I can keep up with practice while traveling.  Highly recommended,1467849600,,197,5.15625

The first selection (more instruction) is very similar to the second selection (basic instruction).  It is just a bit slower which I liked.  I still built heat and was sweating.  This DVD is very similar to going to a class (if you go to classes).  I have now added this to my week in addition to going to class.  Finally, I sat down and watched the pose guide.  How informative.  Even if you have done yoga, it never hurts to review the basics to install proper technique.  He goes over the basics poses, first showing the incorrect way and then the correct way.  He also illustrates how the proper technique benefits certain parts of the body.  There is no matrix.  You won't have a bunch of choices.  But if you want to do yoga at home similar to going to a class, this DVD is a must!",1414108800,2,942,4.132596685082873

Most of them leave me shaking my head because they're run by personal trainers who don't really seem to get yoga. Or, they're classes with extremely talented yogis who have been practising for ages. This video is a good balance of advanced and newbie levels. If you do a flow vinyasa style, this will feel very familiar. There are some pilates/gym type elements (""yoga crunches"" -- lolwhut), but overall this is worthwhile.",1388534400,2,593,4.823529411764706
8342860,5,B001U3YNMW,I love this video! I have been searching for a video that would resemble the core focused vinyasa class I take at my local studio and I have finally found it! I'd say its not for true beginners but not so complicated that a semi flexible semi athletic person can't do it. There aren't any hand stands or difficult back bends. It has a great flow and a good focus on breathing without making you feel silly. It's a good workout if you're not a gym goer. It might not be enough of a burn for someone that works out regularly. Still has that nice relaxing yoga feel and my abs still felt a burn. You can choose two different ways of listening. A detail description of the moves or a quicker one. I've only done the detailed so that I don't have to constantly look up at the tv to follow along. A definate feel good video. Not for advanced yogis.,1385164800,,842,4.203703703703703
