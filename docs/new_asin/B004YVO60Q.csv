4503692,5,B004YVO60Q,My husband's list of 'want to own' is getting smaller. He is a huge Elvis fan so I was so glad to see this collection with all these movies he didn't own already. He loved the collection needless to say :-)!!!!,1360368000,,210,4.146341463414634

I'm not a fan of all the movies he ever made but more than a few I really do love which are Fun In Acapulco, Blue Hawaii, Viva Las Vegas to name a few.  This is a great collection of a few of my favs so I really love this collection and was very pleased with it.",1358726400,,400,3.75

4503697,5,B004YVO60Q,"My Mom Crazy for Elvis!!! I bought my mom 9 DVDs, all of Elvis. They were movies like ""Love Me Tender"", ""Flaming Star"" and ""Wild in the Country"" with a live on tour DVD. She see these DVDs all night and Day, 24/7 it seems. I go for a visit and she watching one of his movies. I'm getting a bit tired of it but she is just crazy over heel for him even after nearly 40 years after he died. Thank You Amazon for having all of his movies and the other DVDs on him to complete my mother's collections!!!!",1346889600,,499,3.9504950495049505
4503698,5,B004YVO60Q,I am a huge Elvis fan and have all but 7 of his movies. I am trying to get them all on DVD. Eventually I will get them all. I have seen all of them several times.,1346198400,,162,3.4054054054054053
4503699,4,B004YVO60Q,"Elvis Presley's movies should have been released as sets of multiple films from the outset, particularly since most, like the 4 in this set, have few bonus features on them. In sets of 4 like this they're a great deal! In my opinion, the 4 films in this set are part of the ""second tier"" of Elvis's movies, i.e., these are NOT among the best half dozen or so movies that Elvis appeared in (""King Creole,"" ""Flaming Star,"" ""Follow That Dream,"" ""Jailhouse Rock,"" ""Wild in the Country,"" ""Speedway,"" etc.) but as part of the ""second tier"" in quality the ones in this set are still quite enjoyable and worthwhile, although uneven. My personal favorites of these 4 are ""Fun in Acapulco"" and ""Roustabout."" Some features that enhance ""Fun in Acapulco"" are the good Mexican-flavored songs and beautiful scenery, while ""Roustabout"" casts Elvis again as an edgy and rebellious character that he played so well. However, even though ""Girls Girls Girls"" and ""G.I. Blues"" have weak scripts, they also have redeeming qualities, including several good songs between them. Important to note is that ALL the films in this set benefit from good production values that were typical of Elvis's films produced by Hal Wallis. Fortunately, NONE of these 4 were produced by Sam Katzman, the ultra low budget producer known as ""King of the Quickies"" who produced several shoddy and cheaply-made films with Elvis in the mid-60s.

There are 4 DVDs in the case, so that's one movie per disc. There's nothing on the discs or case that tells whether these movies have been restored, but from the good picture quality with their sharp images and vivid colors, it appears to me that most or all have been. I wonder if ""Roustabout"" has been restored, particularly because of film scratches, but still it has a good picture too. All are presented only in widescreen, and all state that they are ""enhanced for 16:9 TVs."" All give the audio option of either ""restored English mono"" or Dolby Digital English 5.1 surround sound, but since I don't have a surround sound system I can't assess that. All have optional English subtitles. ""Girls Girls Girls"" and ""Fun in Acapulco"" also have the option of French mono sound. ""Roustabout"" and ""G.I. Blues"" include trailers.

So, for those who already own the best of Elvis's movies on DVD or Blu-ray, this ELVIS COLLECTION VOLUME ONE is a good set of 4 other Elvis movies that are also quite worthwhile and enjoyable.
