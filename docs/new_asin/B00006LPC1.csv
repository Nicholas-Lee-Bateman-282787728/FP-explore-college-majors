8197773,5,B00006LPC1,"This is a combination of 2 DVDs.

The first is a cardio DVD. It is ~6 intervals, each followed by an active recovery in which you work your butt and thighs. Kathy is great at cueing and the moves are fairly easy to pick up after you start. It will get you sweating and burning calories!

The second DVD is a toning for the butt/thighs. You will see (and feel) results ASAP. She is good about making sure you are in the proper position. This DVD has two 10 min sections, the first for beginners which does all the moves alternating legs and the second 10 minutes is for ""Advanced"" meaning you spend 5 minutes on one leg then do it on the other side. (the first time I did the DVD I only got through 8 minutes of the beginner section and couldn't sit properly for 3 days... and I am in shape although apparently I didn't work out my butt like I should have!)

This is my favorite workout!",1109289600,21,886,4.169590643274854

are the two included videos.  tons of reviews on those two are there.  I would buy it just for the second one, both are great for beginner to intermediate, very motivating like all of Kathy's videos, and great results when you combine them.",1039996800,14,298,4.711538461538462
