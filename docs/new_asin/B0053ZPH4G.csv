4553969,4,B0053ZPH4G,Alan does a nice job guiding the newbie drummer through simple rhythms and exercises. I enjoy going back to this DVD to review.,1376006400,5,127,4.565217391304348
4553970,2,B0053ZPH4G,Save your money and time.  Too simple and too little. Better books are avallable.  Look for instructional videos on Youtube.  Try the Salloum book from Mel Bay.,1374278400,3,160,4.851851851851852
4553971,5,B0053ZPH4G,I recommend this product for anyone who is interested in learning to play the bongos.  The lessons are easy to understand with play-along tracks and easy to read charts that even the first time beginner can comprehend.  I loved it.,1373068800,5,231,4.75
4553972,4,B0053ZPH4G,Really well done and easy to follow. The author builds each new chapter on the ideas of the previous one. He has a very friendly demeanor and a very effective method. I also bought his cajon grooves dvd. Reccomend that as well,1372032000,4,226,4.404761904761905
4553973,5,B0053ZPH4G,"I am pleased with this DVD. It is better than expected. I am retired and my wife suggested that I learn to play a musical instrument. Now she wishes she had kept silent. Me, I'm having a ball.",1368489600,30,192,4.078947368421052
4553974,5,B0053ZPH4G,"Fun, is the best way to describe it. Laid back and cool. Inspires you to enjoy playing the Bongos. Makes it easy to learn. Great techniques and wonderful play along sections. I enjoy it and look forward to practice after a long day. Dworksky makes it fun.",1365206400,13,255,4.446808510638298
4553975,5,B0053ZPH4G,"This is the right place to start for a beginner like me. Started with the Kalani Bongo (and Conga) Jam videos, but glad to have this one now.
Another of Dworsky's titles is Gentle Djembe and that would fit this one, too. It feels comfortable from the start, like he's just out to show you the basics rather than smoke you with his chops. And it's also free from embedded manufacturer endorsements.
I love Latin music and when I'm ready I'll probably go back to Kalani et al. But I want to really get a solid foundation here first. For a beginner like me this is a fine introduction to the bongos without macho bluster.",1363392000,30,618,4.3826086956521735
4553976,5,B0053ZPH4G,I bought my fifteen year old daughter bongos and this dvd for her birthday.  She has been really enjoying the bongos and this dvd makes learning the different bongo rhythms easy.  Good purchase.,1353801600,20,194,4.848484848484849

4554001,3,B0053ZPH4G,Although I  liked the segment on the bongos I felt Mr. Dworsky could've developed more time and creativity into his instructional presentation of the bongos in the form of exercises and possibly even homework.,1488758400,,209,5.147058823529412

4554038,5,B0053ZPH4G,As a total beginner this was an excellent place to start.  You get a half dozen rhythms to play with that you can master and get some confidence going.  Doesn't blow you away with high speed or various syncopations or strange timing...very straightforward.  Having no percussion experience myself I spent a couple hours a day for a week and feel very good about what I accomplished.,1447632000,10,382,4.757575757575758

4554070,3,B0053ZPH4G,I expected there will be more songs but there are only 11 repetitive 4 to 7 beat songs in it.  It's just too easy even for beginners.,1398211200,,133,3.925925925925926
4554071,5,B0053ZPH4G,He makes it simple to follow and easy for beginners to learn. He makes it fun with the different rhythms and excellent instruction.,1391817600,,131,4.739130434782608

4554073,5,B0053ZPH4G,"Excellent basic demonstrations of 9 common rhythms.  Alan goes slowly so you get the pattern and then plays with with another rhythmist so you really get the idea.  You can then go to the section called play along where Alan just plays each rhythm without speaking, just watch and follow along with him.  You really get the rhythm ingrained and can practice on your own, increasing speed if need be. There is a section on reading the charts of the rhythms if you prefer that.  The camera work is very good so you always have a ""bird's eye view"" both in the instruction and play along sections....no fancy camera work...just show me what you are doing.  Yes the end of the DVD advertises his other products and DVDs but if you don't want to watch them, don't.
This is an excellent basic, easy instruction on playing basic bongo rhythms for beginners.  I highly recommend.",1385856000,12,870,4.616883116883117

4554075,5,B0053ZPH4G,Great DVD to learn to play the Bongos it has great lessons and shows you how to read music charts and the play long is fun I would recommend if you buy the Bongo Drums to buy them together.,1384041600,,189,3.871794871794872
4554076,5,B0053ZPH4G,Instructor is very pleasant.  Good camera angles and several enjoyable rhythms with play along tracks also.  Does not waste your time with a lot of talking baloney just nicely instructed.  This will get any age group going on bongos and give you a foundation to build on.,1378512000,15,271,4.723404255319149

8456037,2,B0053ZPH4G,Not better than watching youtube videos. Charts are non-standard and it's hard to read for those who get used to musical notation. Very little attention is paid to different hand techniques.,1504742400,,190,5.161290322580645
