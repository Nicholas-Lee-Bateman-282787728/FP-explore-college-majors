7915286,2,B000021Y6X,"This is indeed a lovely story and beautiful interpretation...but simply lacks the ""pizzazz"" and ""sizzle""  necessary to capture the attention of today's electronically charged child...too slow moving... such is our digital, electronic world. We need to slow it down, but ""The Nightingale"" is not a part of the solution. The translation of this story from the book to the screen, in this case, does not work as the pages are too similar in  artistic content and graphics, they do not add to the story, unfortunately.  Glenn Close's narration is soft and soothing, but ultimately becomes ""just words"" as the pace, tempo is too languid.
 One  classroom teacher's opinion only, take it for what it is ... or is not!!",1269734400,,711,4.9411764705882355
