First of all I was only ten when the original series came. Loved it along with my Grandmother who would terminate phone calls just saying ""Have to go Hobo is on.""  I have had two German Sheppards in my time. Raised in the Eisenmann method they garner praise from other dog owners. But onto the series, even in these times of computer FX my three grandsons will gladly sit down and watch an episode of Hobo with me. I only wish that Sabu Cat that produced Vol # 1 will follow through with the rest of the 60's series. The one with Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy is my all time fav",1203638400,,789,5.414634146341464
2200247,4,B00075146C,"I've waited 40 years to see these shows again. I always thought the concept was excellent -- an existential, solitary dog solves human problems (with a different cast of characters every week) -- and that London put Lassie to shame. Unlike the latter series, this is not solely a kids' show.

A couple of clever touches are that London doesn't bark very much -- he ""emotes"" instead -- and he is essentially a supporting player who usually has less screen time than the human actors. As others have noted, the themes of this anthology series are sometimes almost dark -- illustrating some negative aspects of human behavior -- and for this reason I believe the show was intended for adults as well as kids.

While most of the episodes now seem low budget, predictable and written at a high-school level, they still do not disappoint, and they're far better, overall, than the garbage on TV today.",1194393600,7,895,4.730769230769231
2200248,5,B00075146C,"I saw this and was wondering if it was the same show that I watched back in the 80's... I didn't think so because it looked a bit ""too old"" and then I saw another reviewer state that they *had* done a remake of it from the late 70's to mid 80's.  That is the version that I saw, which made it a bit more modern I'm sure, but I am guessing that this old version has the same charm as the newer remake of it (I have not seen any episodes of this old version), so I can't really say too much about it.

I did love the remake as I was growing up in Canada, I still remember the theme song and actually found a clip of it on some random website last year (using Stumble Upon) which made me go ""awww"" and wish that I could see just one episode again.

How does that theme go again? ""Maybe tomorrow, I'll go and settle down. Maybe tomorrow, I'll just keep moving on..."" Something like that, hee.",1180396800,5,888,3.9775280898876404
2200249,5,B00075146C,"I spent the entire afternoon watching these 2 dvds. What a wonderful trip down memory lane for me, I loved the series and was so glad to see that these dvds came out! The black and white version on some of the episodes were wonderful, brought me back to a very special time in my childhood, I loved this series 40 years ago and still do today. Best gift I could have ever bought myself!!! If you are a fan of this series, I highly recommend you invest in this rare treasure!",1174262400,5,474,4.163043478260869
2200250,5,B00075146C,"It's great to have The Littlest Hobo on DVD. I really enjoyed the TV series back in the early 60's the first time I saw it. I can hardly wait for the rest of the episodes from this excellent TV series to be released on DVD. VCI did an excellent job in restoring this classic TV series, the color episodes are great considering their age.",1172188800,6,337,4.2
2200251,5,B00075146C,"This series played on Australian TV in the late 60S and then sometime later in the 70s and to my knowledge hasn't been to air since. What a great opportunity to watch these classics once again.

For those who are familiar to the series it will bring back memories from an era when life was a little less rushed and life was much simpler.

Would recommend this to any prospective purchaser,minimal parts of the reproduction are a little dark-possibly due the age of the originals otherwise its has been great to sit back and once again enjoy the adventures of 'The Littlest Hobo'.",1171756800,7,579,4.611650485436893
2200252,5,B00075146C,"I am purchasing this DVD as a Christmas present for myself. ""The

Littlest Hobo"" was my childhood favorite. It was one of the

best syndicated series of the era. Sometimes the stories were so moving that I would cry during the show. Acting was always well-done and London was a loveable dog ""Thanks to DVD's and digital restoration this along with many othew fine programs have been preserved. I can agree with the other reviewer mentioning how this show caught his child's attention. This is one of the programs that has a ""timeles"" quality to it. Whether you remember this show or not. Buy the DVD and in turn you will receive many hours of enjoyable viewing with good heartwarming stories filled with the kind of entertainment and family values that are not as

easy to find today.",1132790400,22,784,4.666666666666667
2200253,5,B00075146C,"this dvd is great for anyone who grew up in the 60's. i never saw the show in the original timeslot, but i watched it every week in syndication a few years later in 1967. it brings back many fine memories to see this show again after 40 years, even though there was a newer version of the littlest hobo from 1979 - 1985. the quality is fine,except for some audio noise on the 3 color episodes, but after 40 years of absence, it is not a problem. i just hope that the original 1958 littlest hobo movie will come out on dvd too one day and that future volumes of this set will be available too.",1111881600,20,592,4.068376068376068
2200254,5,B00075146C,"I remember seeing this show as a child in the mid 1960s, but hadn't seen it since.  It was great to get this DVD and revisit a fond childhood memory.  The show doesn't have the panache of a CSI, or the action of 24, and is about as far from trendy as you'll get.  But it has a quiet mesmerizing charm about it.  When I started to play this DVD, my wife and son and I sat through over 2 episodes without hardly moving a muscle.  And my son isn't usually interested in anything from the past.  So this show obviously has something.  It was produced with a lot of thoughtfulness, and the stories are interesting.  It was produced in Canada starting in 1963, and I beleive it ran for three seasons.  The first three episodes on this DVD are in color, even though they were presented in black & white when initially shown on TV.  The rest of the episodes are black and white.  To me, it looks better in black and white.  Anyway, the DVD transfers look excellent, and the episodes appear to be complete.  The color portions are a little washed out in places, but not bad.  I'm sure they did the best with what they had to work with.  Overall, I highly recommend this DVD.  It would be great to watch with the whole family.",1110499200,38,1216,4.244541484716157

2200278,5,B00075146C,I remember watching this on television when I was a youngster especially the first episode where the dog is trying to rescue the little lamb. It was heart-warming and wholesome entertainment and I remember crying at the end as a child.,1366156800,,235,4.7560975609756095

2200283,5,B00075146C,"i loved the show as a kid back in 1965. i got to see london at the pacific national exhibition in vancouver in about 1966, and it was just amazing what that dog could do. i later met the younger london in person at our local mall in surrey, british columbia. i got to shake paws. these dogs are a tribute to the training techniques of charles eisenmann. i enjoyed every episode of both incarnations of the series, and i thank you for the discs.

2200284,4,B00075146C,"As a boy I watched this series on television, and, it is one of the catylists of my learning to love animals. This story on both sets of dvd's tells of the story of a tramp dog riding the rails, going from town to town, city to city, you follow the adventures of this very loving dog who rescues, and, helps people, then, heads off again to visit another town.

2200295,3,B00075146C,"Low budget Canadian version of a Hobo-like Rin Tin Tin.  Acting is cheesy and very low budget. The Actor talks to the dog throughout the episodes, but the dog doesn't answer. Interesting to see the lineup of newbie actors who eventually made it in the states.  A good purchase, especially for Family Night TV.  What sucks about Volume 1 and 2, as far as collecting the series, is that they not only DON'T list the NAMES of the episodes in the Amazon description, or on the box, or on the DVD's. You select Play at the start of the DVD, and roll right into episodes with no Titles. The first box states you get 12 episodes, the description of the second box won't say.  Where are the Episodes individual titles?  Why the con?  Because there were 8 seasons of this show on TV. 1963-1965 in Black and White, with Randy Sparks singing the more popular theme song ""Stop Over-(on the Road without end)"", and 1979-1985 in color with Terry Bush singing the theme song ""Maybe Tomorrow"". The seller of this DVD collection does not want you to know which episodes you are getting, or have bought in case they release some other compilation of episodes, in a different box, so you will buy them too, and later discover you already have some of the episodes. To NOT list the episodes in the Amazon description is crooked. You don't know what you got, until you watch, and you STILL don't know the title after seeing the episode. If the seller is reading this, list the episodes in the Amazon Description, on the box, AND on the DVD. By the way, the famous Randy Sparks version song to the intro of the 1963-1965 episodes is dubbed by someone else. Sounds wimpy.  Another big ripoff.",1310083200,6,1669,4.506622516556291

2200297,5,B00075146C,For those old enough to remember this show was a favourite. I loved the song and was sad that in later years it was changed because the origianl song was the best. I always had such a soft spot for the dog. I was sad when bad things happened to him and happy that he made such a difference in peoples lives.

2200300,4,B00075146C,"Marvellous to be able to get these DVDs some 45 years after seeing this original series. To watch them and actually recall some of the stories after so long is testament to their quality and how they burned into a child's memory.

It comes from that great tradition of rather gritty entertainment showing ordinary lives with fairly believable story lines.

I remember seeing the series as a kid in California when it first aired back in the early 60s & still enjoy it. The sound & picture quality, on my tv/dvdplayer, was excellent & the only gripe I have is that the word ""scenes"" is used in the menu instead of ""episodes"". A ""Canadian thing"" perhaps?
