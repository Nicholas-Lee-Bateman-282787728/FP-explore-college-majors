989965,4,6305159297,A good show about life styles that are the normal in other places and gives persons some interesting questions to answer. Is nude bad? Are there still prunds here? What would your kids do if they saw a nude person in  public? What would you do if you saw a nude person in public? Opens up alot  of doors to the mind. What is normal in other places is not normal here?  Who is wrong? Only time will tell...........,911433600,2,413,4.2025316455696204

7885315,4,6305159297,"When this originally aired, I recorded it to vhs. I still have it and transfered it to dvd. The good parts were blurred out, but at least the show showed the women standing and facing the cameras. This VHS has been edited to remove any chance of seeing a full frontal on Adara Michaels or her friend. Rather disappointing when you expect an unrated version to show it all. Still, to find any video with Adara Michaels these days is pretty difficult. This is a must have for the softcore junkies like me and receives only 4 stars due to editing the good parts out.",1234396800,,563,4.371428571428571

7885318,4,6305159297,"Well...  This typical television trash is Springer at his classic best which features two strippers that think being nude in public is acceptable while their family looks on in frustration.  Of course the usual fighting between boyfriend and boyfriend erupts as one thinks his stripper girlfriend shouldn't go out in public wearing nothing at all.  This demented and often lacking intelligent conversation program offers very little in the thought process but the view is excellent!  This is just crazy, mindless entertainment and a classic Springer episode!  Enjoy!!",1033516800,,567,5.471264367816092
