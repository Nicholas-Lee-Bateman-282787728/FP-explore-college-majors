Would love to exchange it for a new dvd, would like to show again to more people.  Outstanding movie!",1531785600,,244,4.377777777777778
8634453,5,B00HQRYIQ2,"A great video that every American should watch. I must warn every Christian that it is also sad. It is sad because we once was a Christian nation that God poured His blessings on but we allowed the A.C.L.U., planned parenthood and the Supreme Court to take away from America our birth right. Watching our beginnings though I felt like standing up and shouting. Even though we have lost God in our public places no one can take Him from our private places and our churches. This film has beautiful scenes. Truthfully told. I'm glad I found and watched it.",1529971200,,554,4.55
