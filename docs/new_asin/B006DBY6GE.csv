4983903,5,B006DBY6GE,"I remember the first time I held a chimp's hand. The first touch between human and ape fingers establishes a connection, and you never forget the soft leathery feel of a chimpanzee's palm. What should be an ordinary sensation is not. It is unforgettable and forever.

The problem arises when the chimp-human connection becomes subject to human arrogance, sometimes cloaked in love, other times defined by science, and often supported by stupidity.

Project Nim is the true story of a chimpanzee who was taken from his mother to participate in a 1970s university research project on communications. The movie has all three components: love, science, and stupidity, all adding up to a level of human arrogance that is almost incomprehensible.

Nim's story begins at an Oklahoma primate research project, when the mother chimpanzee, Carolyn, is shot with a tranquilizer so the research director can grab Carolyn's sixth newborn, Nim, as they stole all the others. Nim goes from his mother's arms, to adored and beloved ""child"" of a human mother, to precocious subject of young college students' attention, to an independent young male actually starting to act like a chimpanzee. All along the way, we hear directly from the people who played the supporting roles in Nim's young life. As I listened to them tell their stories, from their perspectives, I could identify with their good intentions.

And arrogance. A university researcher who doesn't believe the ""science"" was compromised when he seduced the project's sweet teenage ""education director."" A college graduate who lets a chimpanzee nurse from her breast for months, and then years later thinks she can walk into the (by now) adult chimp's cage, when he is screaming and ""displaying,"" and thinks the chimpanzee won't hurt her. So much arrogance.

Fortunately, Nim also had people who related to him as a chimpanzee, who cared deeply and personally for his welfare.

After Herb, the university researcher, realizes that the adult Nim is a chimp (d'oh!), with all a chimpanzee's strength and unpredictability, he sends Nim back to the Oklahoma facility where Nim has to be in a dark cage for the first time in his life. When the facility runs out of money, Nim is sold to LEMSIP, an infamous experimental research facility, and he is subject to conditions and protocols that are deeply disturbing for any chimpanzee, but are unspeakable for a chimpanzee raised as a human.

Enter Robert Ingersoll, who met and befriended Nim in Oklahoma. Thanks to Robert, and a good lawyer who brought public attention to Nim's situation, LEMSIP decides to sell Nim to a horse sanctuary. From there, Nim's life starts to improve again - not to a standard we would wish for, but at least one that is better.

Project Nim shows us, in a totally engrossing - almost haunting - movie, how keeping a chimpanzee, essentially as some kind of sub-human in costume, is grossly unfair to the chimpanzee, besides being just plain stupid and dangerous. I'm not sure if most of the audience realizes that decades of human arrogance has hurt innumerable chimpanzees, before and after Nim. The unforgiveable thing is that, in the U.S., it still happens. And we let it continue.",1325030400,58,3201,5.003759398496241
4983904,5,B006DBY6GE,"Project Nim is a fascinating video comprised from wonderfully logged archives of videos, along with more recent interviews from his caretakers: past and present. It's a great documentary that you don't need to be a naturalist or linguist to enjoy. I enjoyed the ""science"" from the film, my 9 year old daughter felt the story, and my wife felt so bad for Nim she could barely watch - but did so with great interest. A couple of days later we still find ourselves discussing Nim in the household.

This resource would be a great one for a range of classes, in various educational settings, from kindergarten to graduate school.

The story of Nim, as revealed here, will engaged the viewer with questions: from the nature of language, to the linguistic capacities of ""other animals"", along with the humane treatment of subjects used in clinical and experimental research. I appreciate the honesty put forth in the documentary as there are aspects of Nim's treatment that will certainly irk you. At the same time as being irked by what had been done to Nim, I feel that many of the decisions made are understandable in the light of events that arose (i.e. Nim badly injuring his volunteer caretakers). One could have simple reported the cute and cuddly successful sides to this story - but thankfully the rougher edges were presented giving us what feels like a complete picture of Nim's life. Nim is an animal and had violent instinctive behavior from time to time. Behavior that made coexistence with its human animal compatriot difficult. I am not suggesting in any negative way that this is Nim's fault, the experimental design was new and did not anticipate such catastrophic encounters. Had Nim taken on language as Columbia University had anticipated, the world would have gained a lot of knowledge from this trial. He didn't do as expected. Lessons were learned at his expense. The video documents this trial, honestly, I believe.

Nowadays I think that research-ethics-committees and protests groups would curve and influence the treatment of ""modern"" Nim-like cases, and this is a good development, although I am not nave enough to think that science and research today is 100% animal-friendly.

Understanding that this is not a Hollywood blockbuster (thankfully so) I can see how it could easily be turned into one. I like the vintage film. I like the direct approach here. If you enjoyed books and/or literature that have dealt with Nim and want to know more I think you will really like this educational film. The case is presented here in a fascinating and thoughtful way.",1323388800,22,2582,4.915137614678899

About a researcher who wants to see if a baby chimpanzee named Nim, torn from the arms of its natural mom, and placed in a human family with a human surrogate mother who even breastfeeds it, will grow up to understand human language and communicate through by signing, since chimpanzees physically cannot make the sounds of human speech. In short the researcher loses interest after he has exhausted his project (sleeping with some of the bright young research assistants along the way) realizing that Nim  is actually NOT human and has has own set of needs and perceptions that do not always sync up with his research. So Nim continues a heartbreaking journey from being a research subject rockstar to being shoved into a cage and used for medical research projects.

4983915,4,B006DBY6GE,"Watching this film as an assignment in a college-level Environmental Ethics class, I of course realized that ethics had a large role in the criticism of this project.

Knowing nothing of the initial scientific project beforehand, I believe truly does a good job of informing the viewers about the overall purpose and timeline of the whole process. What bothers me is how much the film goes into depth about the issues that do not pertain to Nim; like the sexual affairs between the caretakers and their drama. I do not see those matters as important when explaining the scientific project at hand. It made me want to turn the film off and go read about it instead; at least that way I could be informed about the actual project and nothing else.

The film did seem a little biased, as well. After watching it, I had distinct opinions about every subject in the film. I believe the film makers subconsciously - although perhaps consciously - portrayed each matter and character in the film in a negative or positive light. It was more like an opinion piece than like an unbiased (or neutral) scientific documentary. The music, interviews, and scenes shown really help display the filmmakers' standpoints on the project and everyone involved.",1450310400,3,1240,4.84433962264151

4983917,5,B006DBY6GE,"This documentary left me quite horrified. I did not fully grasp what the documentary was about before watching it -- just that it was depicting an experiment to see if a chimp could be raised as a human in a human household, nature vs. nurture, etc. The ""experiment"" started in 1974, when I was in my sophomore year as an experimental psychology student. We, of course, in the academic world of psychology, did not know of this ""project"" -- I am unclear if anyone outside of Columbia University (where this ""project"" took place) had knowledge of it at the time. But, at that time, I was fully aware (thanks to my courses) of controversial experiments taking place in the world of social psychology and also in controversy over animal experimentation ( both in psychology and in biology). I chose, for my own moral reasons, not to experiment on rats. And I also chose not to experiment on chimps (which we had available to us in a lab course on primate behavior), using human subjects instead.

So, this film really hit home with me -- as I see reflected in the film  the early-mid 1970s ""wild west"" of experimentation and ethical misjudgement -- topics that were just starting to be examined in the literature I do believe that the ethical climate for experimentation with humans and with animals has vastly improved since that time -- but, I know there is still need for much improvement today. The film stunned me, though, with its portrayal of the whole scenario of Professor Hubert Terrace conducting such an experiment without any apparent supervision or oversight by Columbia University. (I presume that this could not happen today.)

One major thing lacking in the film is the absence of  background information and the scientific context which allowed this project to proceed as it did. I would have liked to hear other contemporaneous psychology professors discuss the whole ethical issue that this project presents. Were ethics considered at the time? Did Columbia have any review panels to oversee experimentation and ethical boundaries? Did any other Columbia professors question the ethics of the project? Prof. Terrace's dalliance with his student-workers is another ethical issue that is not examined in the film -- tho it is brushed off by the professor as not impacting his science.

The project, in fact, seemed quite unscientific. It was an abomination-- not even close to representing ""science"". It was carried out, in my estimation, as merely a hobby by an arrogant, ethically-challanged scientific poseur -- with no methodology set forth, no measurements collected, no meaningful data, no plan of any sort. Just wingin' it!  How did this project ever get funded? I would have liked to see what Columbia University had to say about it, today, in retrospect. And, what would psychologists or other researchers say about this project, today? We are not presented with any ""outsiders"" to give any commentary or contemporaneous observations. I think it is clear that it would be condemned today, but the professor himself does not condemn his own behavior in reflecting on the past. Amazing!

This film certainly depicts ""How not to conduct an experiment"", and should be required viewing for all current and future psychology students and animal experimenters in any discipline. (I would like to see a revised follow-up version of the film that would cover the issues I raised, to see where, on the scale, does this project fit in the context of the scientific community values of the time. Was it an outlaw experiment? Or, did it pass the ""sniff test"" of the times?)",1445385600,,3584,4.953410981697171

4983926,3,B006DBY6GE,"Fair but the actual project at least during the years at Columbia U is overlook in favor of the outrageous behavior of some of Nim's teachers.  The interviews are limited to those who were the ""selected"" few and did not include many of the others who were more objective (I was the 1st male live-in caretaker for years at Delafield - seen in the breakfast scene).  Does cover Nim's last years fairly well and of course does not have a happy ending.  Glad much of the mis-information in Hess' book was omitted, but like her book there is more focus on the sexual exploits of Herb than Nim in the early years.",1417737600,6,607,4.401785714285714
4983927,5,B006DBY6GE,"Nim was raised as a human, breast fed by his human ""mother"", given clothing, a human family, a house, bed and toys. In this loving environment he naturally developed a facility for language, was toilet trained, learning dozens of sign language words, and the ability to make sentences. He formed lasting friendships with some student teachers that tried throughout their lives, with the limited power they had, to protect him. Once grown, as part of a natural adolescence that included a period of danger to his teachers as he learned his own strength and looked for a mate, he was relegated to dirty cages, and had a near escape from the animal laboratories of nightmares in which conscious live chimps are immobilized in painful brain experiments. The emotional brutality shown towards Nim, particularly by Columbia Professor Hubert Terrace, is breathtaking. Terrace's propensity to sleep with Nim's female caretakers and act out rather strange family dynamics - first with a former lover who just married someone else, and later with the ""next hot new thing"" - could keep Freud busy for a long time. The most human character in the movie- loving, caring, expressive, communicative, and playful - was, ironically, Nim. I'm ashamed to be part of a culture that treated such a precious soul to such cruelty over so many years. The twisted power structures that enabled men like Terrace to use Nim as a tool to seek fame, and discard him without a thought like his student amours, rankle to the core. Late in his life, Nim kept trying to escape his cold cage to the house on the property - where he still felt he belonged. One wonders what Jane Goodall would think of our brutality towards Nim. I will never forget the interview in which his loving caretaker brought him to the brutal cages where he was met with a cattle prod by yet another heartless professor. I would like to put the cattle prod right back on him. Nim, on behalf of all feeling human beings, I'm sorry.",1414627200,2,1971,4.766081871345029

4983935,5,B006DBY6GE,"'Nim' is the story of a chimpanzee that is raised from infancy with humans, with the goal being to teach him sign language and see if humans can communicate with chimpanzees.  It follows his life from his first days with humans to his later life when he is put in captivity.  It is arranged as a series of interviews with those who took care of, taught, and lived with Nim.  The visuals and format is very appealing.

The story is heart wrenching.  Nim is very attached to his human friends, but ultimately becomes to large and dangerous to live with them.  The scenes early on are very cute, since Nim is a baby.  Later on, you get sadder as he is sent to a facility with other chimpanzees and this causes him obvious distress.  The scenes where he is first left there are very hard to watch.

The movie left me with one message - we have no business keeping these magnificent creatures, who are the closest animals genetically to humans, in captivity.  While the experiment conducted was interesting, it was evident after a while that the degree of communication between Nim and the humans who cared for him was going to be limited.  Even when Nim apparently used a 16 word sentence, it was not any sentence in the traditional form that one would think of - rather, it was a repetitive group of signs which said very little.  All the more reason to leave these creatures alone now that we know it is difficult to communicate with them.

I can't fault others for being curious about chimpanzees, but as 'Nim' shows, we can only go so far with animals.  We've learned a lot from them and we should stop our intrusion into their lives.  Leave them to live in nature and stop using them.  Nim shows us what happens when we continue beyond the time that we should.",1373846400,2,1761,4.45625

4983939,5,B006DBY6GE,"This is a painful, powerful documentary to watch and, frankly, kind of a must-see for that very reason.  It's about the life of a chimpanzee purchased as a newborn by a researcher and bounced around from lab to lab most of his life.

It all started in the 1970s, when a psychology professor at Columbia University, Herbert Terrace, bought the chimp for a research project focused on ye olde ""nature vs. nurture"" question.  Named Nim Chimpsky, after linguist Noam Chompsky, Nim was placed with a human family and raised as if he were a human baby, in an attempt to see if chimps, who have DNA almost identical to ours, could learn to ""speak"" English fluently (via sign language, obviously, but using grammatical sentence structure and expressing their emotional states and thoughts, etc.).  Nurtured and loved deeply by his human mother -- who, weirdly, also breast-fed him -- Nim seemed to have the perfect life.  As he grew, he learned many things, including how to dress himself and sign well enough to make simple requests and express some emotional states.

When Nim became a strong and strong-willed teenager, however, everything changed.  Nim was increasingly jealous of his human mother's husband, and would lash out at him regularly.  Events escalated until, finally, the family had had enough and Nim was suddenly taken away and moved to a huge estate, where another young woman, Laura-Ann, took over his care and education, eventually teaching him over 125 signs.

The bigger Nim got, though, the more confused he seemed to get by the dichotomy between how he was being raised (as a human) and what his insides were telling him (as a chimp).  He would do incongruous things, like caress a cat lovingly one moment and try to violently hump it the next, and he became more and more dangerous to the humans around him.  At one point, he bit Laura-Ann's arm wide open.  In another incident, as one researcher passed him to another, Nim turned to the new person and viciously ripped open the man's face, then began to sign the word ""Sorry"" over and over, clearly startled and distraught by his own behavior.

After the two serious injuries, Terrace decided he'd had enough and called the experiment a failure.  Nim was just a wild animal after all, and even though he could clearly communicate, was smart and loving, and had only ever known life as a human being, Terrace dumped him like he meant nothing to him, selling him to another research facility.

After that, Nim was bounced from lab to lab, with little concern for his happiness or recognition of his unique abilities.  Having never seen other chimps before, Nim didn't know how to communicate with or relate to them, and the chimps around him in the labs would frequently intimidate and scare him.  Withdrawing into himself,  Nim tried to reach out for human contact, and did make a lifelong friend in one keeper, Bob Ingersoll.  But despite Ingersoll's love and care (he would take Nim for long walks in the woods, and even let him try out beer and marijuana -- oh, you know, it was the 80s!), the best he was finally able to do for Nim was to have him transferred to a sanctuary at last, where Nim lived out the rest of his life alone in a concrete cage with bars along one side.

Though Ingersoll continued to visit Nim after he was transferred to the sanctuary, Nim died there at the young age of 26 (chimps usually live to be 55-60).  Ingersoll's explanation for Nim's early death:  1 part stress, 2 parts broken heart.

This film is a wonderful, touching, and gut-wrenching story about a truly amazing creature who was wounded indelibly by the hubris of human beings.  Terrace and his students never bothered to think about the ramifications of failure -- of nature taking over as Nim grew -- or what they would do with Nim when the study was over and funding disappeared.  Years later, his first human mother came to the sanctuary to visit Nim, and he nearly killed her, still so hurt and confused about her abrupt, heartless rejection of him.

Since Nim's death in 2000, the National Institute of Health has found the most invasive research using chimps unnecessary and pulled funding from several primate centers.  Nevertheless, over a thousand chimps are still out there in government custody, with only a small number of those sent to sanctuaries each year, most of which are desperately underfunded in the first place.  I'm not actually against research on animals, but I am against thoughtlessness and cruelty.  We have to do better.  Watching this film would be a really good start.

The story is heartbreaking, but it is also an important reminder of how far we have come in our understanding and appreciation of our closest relatives. Keep in mind that when project Nim was launched the human genome was decades in the future. We did not yet know that we share over 95% of our genes with chimps.

Some were naive; some were heroes in their own way, and one or two were just plain jerks.

It also had the appearance that the researchers knew nothing of gorilla behavior and what to expect and were simply not equipped to conduct a study like this. It was really sad to see this opportunity squandered by people that attempt to conduct an experiment of this sort when they don't have the necessary background.

4983942,4,B006DBY6GE,"I saw the trailer for ""Project NIM"" when it was about to come out in the theatre and thought to myself ""I really want to see this"", but then somehow I missed the movie in the theatre, but now I finally had a chance to catch up on it, and perhaps it was better this way, as I now also got to enjouy the DVD bonus materials (more on that later).

""Porject NIM"" (2011 release; 93 min.) brings the story of the chimp Nim, who is taken away from his chimp mom in 1974 when he's only 2 weeks old, to be placed with a family in New York, and being brought up as if he is a human. The scientific project behind it (run by Columbia Universoty) is whether a chimp can learn to communicate with humans in sign language. After about 4-5 years, as Nim now is getting towards young adulthood in chimp years and hence becoming more aggressive (several incidents involving the people around him are documented), Columbia stops the project and Nim is returned to the primate colony in Oklahoma where he was born. Keep in mind, Nim has never interacted with another chimp by then. I don't want to spoil how it all plays out, you'll just have to see it for yourself.

Several comments: this movie is rated PG-13 for a reason and indeed is not suitable material for young children, despite the ""cute"" subject matter. Second, this movie is produced and directed by the same team that brought us ""Man on Wire"", another top notch documentary. Third, check out the DVD bonus materials: there is a 15 min. segment called ""Bob's Journey"", in which we see how the life of Bob Ingersoll, one of Nim's original caretakers, takes a completely different turn upon the release of the movie. Check out also the 30 min. ""Making of"" feature, in which we get great insights from the director, the producer and many others. In fact, it wasn't until seeing the ""Making of"" feature that I realized quite a few scenes in the documentary are re-enactments after the facts. That aside, ""Project NIM"" is highly recommended!",1352505600,3,1980,4.497222222222222

NIM is based on a true story; however, I found it lacking a few of the basic ingredients that makes people want to watch movies.  There was little action, suspense, or drama, and what very little bit it did have, it was way too predictable.  Basically, this flick is more of a documentary than a movie.  Half way through it, I found myself looking at the clock, hoping it would soon end. I'm sure the chimp in the research experiment wanted it to end soon, too.  I kind of wish I had saved my money on this one, and waited as I think it is now out on the premium movie channels like HBO or Showtime.",1349308800,2,689,4.229007633587786
4983945,5,B006DBY6GE,"Project Nim is a fascinating documentary. The story is primarily a sad one in which we see many, many people over the course of a chimpanzee's life trying to treat him right but often falling victim to the fallacy that a chimp (names Nim Chimpsky) can be treated just like a human. The film is very well made even though some of the re-enactments are indeed a little bit clunky as others have noted; the plot moves along a very good pace with lots of archival footage and still photos while people discuss that part of the chimp's life. Moreover, the cinematography on locations like the ranch where animals can live without fear from human abuse, neglect or exploitation is excellent. The musical score enhances the film, too; and I really like the insightful interviews of the people involved with Nim.

Nim's story begins in Oklahoma in 1974. Nim is taken from his mother as she lay shot by a tranquilizer gun; even though Nim's mother was tranquilized she put up an admirable fight to keep her baby. Nim comes into the hands of Columbia University researcher Herb Terrace who doesn't hesitate to show his arrogance and chauvinistic attitudes; he thinks it's OK for him to sleep with his young, pretty female research assistants and that it won't interfere with their scientific experiments to see if Nim can be taught language just like a little child can be taught language. (And believe me, if you think Terrace is arrogant, you should have met the other professors--but that's another story.)

Initially, Terrace places Nim in a household where he can learn language but instead of learning language Nim becomes part of a family of free form hippies who give Nim love despite some problems and power struggles along the way. However, when Terrace discovers that no research is taking place he and one of his research assistants take Nim to a beautiful, somewhat secluded estate in Riverdale, New York for formal experimentation. They want to determine how much language Nim could learn and, very importantly, if a chimp could be taught to put together a coherent sentence. We see Terrace's assistants compiling huge amounts of data. Terrace eventually decides that Nim is just a chimp after all (!!!) and sends him back to the facility in Oklahoma where Nim has to live in a dark cage--and then after a while Nim is carted off to a medical experimental research laboratory --and from there Nim is eventually transferred to a horse ranch where he is treated with at least a modicum of kindness.

In addition, we learn the sad truth that Nim was capable of harming people and other animals when he wanted to.

There is a lot more to Nim's story; but I will leave other things out because I don't want to spoil it all for you!

The DVD comes with some nice bonus features. There is an optional commentary by director James Marsh; and we get ""Bob's Journey;"" ""Making Nim"" and the theatrical trailer.

I recommend Project Nim for people who enjoy documentaries that explore the relationship between mankind and the animal world. People who are concerned with animal rights should get this and people who appreciate science and nature documentaries would do well to add this to their collections.",1343865600,5,3197,4.793103448275862

If there's one thing that stands out, it's that Herbert Terrace is a rotten character - just using NIM to try and achieve personal glory and not caring about him, except as an opportunity to get into the news or photo ops.

It seems NIM was able to understand and use sign language effectively...I doubt an experiment like he went through would be undertaken today (being brought up in a human household).

I can't help thinking of how much better Koko the gorilla has fared with love and affection.

Btw, shame on Herbert Terrace! Shame on him for not caring, and for those who did not have empathy for NIM.

I was very disturbed knowing that a college professor could take a wild animal and raise it as a human in the ""name of science."" After seeing this documentary, I am truly horrified! An infant chimpanzee is taken from his mother and raised in a home with seven human children. He is taught to communicate in sign language. Many years later, when Nim is an adult and too difficult to handle, he is sent back to the facility where he was born. The transfer amounted to a blindsided kidnapping and Nim was drugged the entire time. Terrace, the researcher who wanted Nim to be raised as a child in a human family,  left him in a cage with bars and a cement floor, but was ""kind"" enough to leave him with one of his stuffed toys, a teddy bear. Eventually, the facility fell into financial problems and sold him to a medical lab for experimentation. God bless Cleveland Amory for trying to right such an injustice and purchase Nim from the medical researchers. While the documentary ends on a positive note, it reminds us that wild animals are just that... not pawns that can be manipulated into pseudo-human beings. Wild animals need to be living in their own world, not in the human world. This film is such a sad commentary on human arrogance and entitlement",1336867200,3,1349,4.506122448979592

4983953,5,B006DBY6GE,"In 1973 Nim was taken from his mother shortly after birth from a primate facility in Oklahoma. He was to be a university project where he was to be raised as a human child in a home with children and taught to use sign language. The project is managed by a professor from Columbia University as a project on teaching language to a chimpanzee.

The entire premise is wrong as Nim is put into a home without discipline or scientific practice being followed. The people in the home don't even know sign language so how are they going to teach it to Nim? The highlight of the mother's statements is how she breast fed the baby chimp and as he got a little older she let him drink alcohol and smoke pot. The professor is at strained relations with the test family as he had an affair with the mother while she was a student at Columbia.

The professor inserts another young research assistant, which he also seduces, into the home to systematically teach Nim sign language. While they make great progress they decide to move Nim to a remote estate under the care of several additional research assistants. Nim attacks one of the research assistants as she is leaving because her relationship with the professor is strained. They hire more research assistants who work with Nim.

As Nim gets older (5 years) he begins to exert his alpha male status and he is so physically strong that he is a danger to the research assistants and he attacks one of them. They drug him and take him to Oklahoma where he is caged. He is terrified to be around other chimpanzees as his only relationships have been with humans for 5 years. While at the Oklahoma facility he is sold to a medical lab for experimentation by a drug company for Hepatitis and AIDS vaccines....

This true story is extremely sad and nauseating at the same time. The arrogance of the professor and the mother who first had Nim is sickening. They disrupt a chimpanzee's life for their personal enjoyments and experimentation. Nim is moved from mother, to a home, to an estate, to a cage to a drug experimentation laboratory, to recue with total isolation..... The lack of respect for Nim is astounding! What did they think they were going to do with a chimpanzee that lived to the age of 26 years after they tossed him aside because their plans didn't go well?

You can always tell when a movie makes me mad as I expose too much of the story and rant. In the end, the human cruelty to animals and our complete indifference to other life is the sad part of the movie. Poor Nim and the others like him are abused and mistreated while some college professor writes a paper on a failed experiment and gets on national TV. Sadly the people involved with Nim not only mistreated him but giving him pot and the selling him into the medical experimentation labs to me was just too much.

4983955,5,B006DBY6GE,"From the folks who brought the dynamic documentary MAN ON WIRE comes a new tale. This one revolves around a chimp made famous when he began speaking to people. No this isn't a PLANET OF THE APES sequel and I don't mean he speaks, but he does communicate through sign language.

Nim, as he is named, becomes part of an experiment begun at Columbia University by Prof. Herbert Terrace. What Terrace wanted to do was show that a baby chimp raised as a human being would be able to learn to communicate as we humans do. Taken from his mother within weeks of being born, Nim is given to a grad student with a family and is indeed raised as if he were one of her children.

Interviews with those involved as well as stock footage and photographs give us the chance to witness what went on. Nim becomes the focus of the family and does learn sign language, something which the family in question hadn't made a part of their life until this experiment. Nim also shows jealousy and rage with the male head of the household while being protective of the female in charge.

More students are brought in to help teach Nim sign language and the mother in question demonstrates her own bits of jealousy during interviews when she says that one was attempting to take over as mother. It feels as if she's lost the idea that this is an experiment and actually adopted the chimp.

Different teachers are brought in throughout the experiment but eventually Nim's chimpanzee nature takes hold and he displays signs of violence, biting through the cheek of one teacher. While he has grown fond of two students who are the last to teach him (and who fell in love while doing so) the end is in sight. Fearing a lawsuit should he attack again, Terrace brings the project to an end and ships Nim back to his original home, a gathering of cells for chimps run by another professor who just studies chimp behavior.

This is not the world Nim was raised in. This is a world where chimps behave like chimps, never putting on clothes or asking for things they want. As the days progress, Nim falls into a sorry state.

Terrace on the other hand becomes a celebrity of sorts. When Nim was still part of the project he wrote a book on the research and was a guest on several talk shows discussing Nim's ability to communicate. The reality was that it was the students who had contact almost daily with Nim and Terrace's contact was very limited. When he called the project to a halt it was a cold moment but easily done since he had no clue what Nim was really like.

Another student becomes involved in working with Nim at his new home and eventually begins communicating with the chimp once again. They become friends of sort with Nim almost always wanting to play. But fate steps in once more and with decreased funding the professor in charge ships out the chimps on hand, including Nim, to medical research facilities. Here chimps are caged, drugged and have test run on them to see their reactions to various items from medicine to cosmetics. One professor here who seems to take on the role of villain eventually comes to the aid of these animals. But can Nim ever truly be saved?

The movie takes a straight forward approach not just trying to paint a portrait of an animal as a near human but showing that it does indeed possess the animal traits it was born with. Nim may have learned to communicate (which Terrace writes off as just asking for things it wants...watch and you decide if Nim can communicate) but he still has the strength of a wild chimp and the possibility of doing damage is there. But in watching as Nim learns, as he ""talks"" and as he shows the ability to understand those around him the question of using animals for testing is raised.

I've not taken a firm stance on the issue in the past, but after watching this film it makes me wonder if it's worth it to put animals through what we do in testing. I've never thought it was a good idea to do so for such things as cosmetics. Now I find myself questioning if it should be done for medical research as well. It's easy to say that cures have been found and formulated that have helped humans, but do we truly have the right to treat animals this way? And knowing that they can indeed have emotions and communicative abilities how human is it to do so?

I've seen films that are completely propagandistic take on the subjects they claim to be open minded about. This film doesn't feel that way. This film feels like its looking at all sides of the issue. It is interesting from start to finish and will lead you many a discussion on the topic of test animals. But more importantly it will tell people of the story of Nim and that's a story worth telling.",1332201600,4,4705,4.435185185185185

The parts of the movie that seemed filled with love and laughter always had an underlying selfishishness of the many researchers involved in this chimps life, accept one wonderful man who appreciated that a chimp is a chimp and should live its life as such. Perhaps their intentions were good, but the results were not. Much like Grizzly Man, we should let animals be animals and not impose our human ways on them or our sick desire to study their behavior.

4983961,4,B006DBY6GE,"About half way through the fascinating, absorbing and unsettling PROJECT NIM, a tear-stained former female caretaker of the chimp looks right into the camera and states ""Shame on us.""  That sense of shame at humanity's awesome hubris is just one of several very strong emotions that filmmaker James Marsh effectively evokes in a film that asks some very big questions, even as it moves and breaks your heart.

Poor Nim.  From the day he was torn from his mother's devastated arms, he was unwittingly entwined with human machinations he could never understand nor hope to escape.  For an animal lover, it's hard to watch his tragedy unfold, yet also impossible not to watch its moments of sheer joy and revelation; and impossible not to want to comprehend what happened and what it all meant . . . for us, for science and for Nim.

Some might take issue with Marsh's playful directing, which fuses some rather graphic and overtly dramatic recreations with real documentary footage.  But I felt he did a great job of allowing the audience to feel what Nim's caretakers appear to have felt -- charmed, seduced, amused, uncertain, sometimes frightened, and often too caught up in their amazing relationship with a wild animal to perceive the moral dangers or eventual consequences.

The film brings up many intriguing issues -- questions about the nature and purpose of language (did scientists really believe that intelligent animals who for millions of years experienced the world without language were going to learn a few signs and suddenly express to us everything they are thinking?); questions about academic and sexual power (the skeevy Herb and his phalanx of fresh-faced, sexy girls is really something!); questions about the shaky moral ground of animal experimentation of all kinds.  But it seems the most disturbing question of all is just why of all the smart, sensitive, searching people who worked with Nim over the years  . . . only one was willing to fight for his life.

If there is a hero of PROJECT NIM, it is Bob Ingersoll, the young primatology student who befriends Nim like so many others -- but, unlike all the rest, does not abandon him when circumstances bring the highly social chimp first to a gruesome medical lab and then to an even more gruesome refuge, where he nearly fades away of loneliness.  Only Ingersoll seems to have Nim's best interests iin mind.

PROJECT NIM is never simplistic.  The persons involved, including Nim, are all highly complex and deeply flawed.  But at least Bob Ingersoll leaves us with some hope for our own species.",1329436800,24,2573,4.8986175115207375

The film documents a fascinating project undertaken during the early 1970s to determine whether or not a chimpanzee raised from birth in a human family could learn enough sign language to indicate some form of syntactic comprehension. Following the chimp subject, Nim Chimpsky, from the time he was taken away from his mother all the way through the end of the project, and several years after, the film intersperses archival footage and contemporary interviews with the various caretakers, handlers, and teachers that passed in and out of Nim's life.

4983963,5,B006DBY6GE,"This fabulous film is from James Marsh who also gave us MAN ON WIRE.

What makes Nim's story so powerful is the wealth of amateur film footage that was shot during the misguided 1970s language experiment that literally ripped a baby chimp from his mother's breast and placed him in a human home to see if the primate could learn human language if it was raised like a human child.  What's especially distressing in this always gripping, sometimes funny and finally heartbreaking documentary is the unbridled arrogance of the experiment's originator, one Dr. Herb Terrace.

Contemporary interviews with those who interacted with Nim (last name Chimsky) in various ways are jaw dropping or tear jerking.  The compassion or lack-of for our fellow, sentient, emotional creatures is the real subject of this extraordinary film that exposes the self-serving cruelty we impose in the name of fame and greed.  The horrors Nim was subjected to were extreme, and even though he could sign and apparently understood and could communicate rudimentary feelings and desires, no human ever tried to communicate ""I'm sorry"" even though some attempts were made to alleviate the horrible isolation and loneliness of his long, sad life.

No question the experiment was a failure.  What Nim learned from us is the worst of human traits.  But what we could have learned from him remains locked behind his knowing but inscrutable eyes.

8496682,5,B006DBY6GE,"This was a really good documentary. Please note, this documentary isn't about this bright, adorable chimp and his amazing achievements (although he was and they were) that closed the communication gap between humans and chimps but rather the ignorance and arrogance of the humans he was bound to trust, who ultimately failed him.  (SPOILER ALERT) I was appalled at how little a Columbia University professor researched chimps prior to taking on this type of study (the study to see if a chimp, if raised from birth as essentially a human baby, could learn to sign in sentences and understand, for instance, the difference between dog bites man and man bites dog).  The professor essentially tears Nim from his mother to be given in the care of a wealthy hippy family, who knew nothing about chimps, knew very little sign language, which was kind of the whole point of the research and since Stephanie,  the ""mother"" didn't believe in any sort of discipline for her children or Nim, she, of course, does not know what to do with him when he acts out and becomes aggressive. It was shocking that the use of proper, researched discipline (that the chimp mother would have performed on Nim in the wild for his best interest to acclimate with other chimps) never occurred to the professor or anyone else (except Joyce, a later carer, who bit Nim back and he never acted out toward her again).  Stephanie had so little understanding that after he had been taken away from her, and after a decade of just being passed around because there was never a plan b for his future, she decides to visit him at the animal sanctuary and thought she could just walk into his cage and act like nothing happened... well he showed her, ironically, disciplining her for abandoning him.  I agree with another review...Bob Ingersoll was the only hero in this film.  He fought to get him out of the animal testing plant, he fought to get him a companion in the animal sanctuary and he was the only one to visit Nim. (Other than the insolent professor, who did not deserve that welcome from Nimany of the other carers, yes, but not Herb).  Bob was the only one who did not wipe his conscience clean and walk away.  Many of the carers loved Nim, and it is apparent they felt much remorse, but Bob was the only one who felt a moral inclination to fight for him and stick by him.  Also, some reviewers have stated they thought the mention of the sexual flings between the professor and Nims young, pretty teachers/carers were not necessary to the story, but I disagree, they wereit spoke volumes about Herb and his great lack of consideration towards this precious creature. This documentary was not so much about Nim, but about the recklessness of animal research that pretty much set this bright, adorable chimp up for a forlorn, caged life.  I saw this in an article about Nim in the Guardian and sums it up beautifully:

8496683,5,B006DBY6GE,"*Note; if you find yourself irritated by the hippy family in the first segment just hang in there. It doesn't stick with them for long.*

  An absolutely heart breaking story. Which rarely pulls any punches when looking at how horrible we were to these particular animals not too long ago. Including footage from inside a medical experimenting facility. I was on the brink of tears several times.
  Great production value. This being such a landmark case at the time there is plenty of video/photo on record, so the re enactments are super minimal. None containing actors in place of the actual people, etc. Great music as well.",1499644800,,628,4.831775700934579
8496684,5,B006DBY6GE,"Whatever your feelings, beliefs, or experiences with animals, this is must-see documentary. I disliked the way certain people involved with the project were portrayed more as villains than others, since everyone who taught or raised Nim were complicit. It made me uncomfortable, but the best documentaries do.",1496880000,,309,5.595744680851064
