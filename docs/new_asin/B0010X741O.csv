3053185,4,B0010X741O,"There is an audio commentary by Hong Kong cinema expert by Bey Logan. He points out that this film was made during the glory days of the Shaw Bros. At the time, Gordon Liu was doing Shaolin monk roles in films and had a shaved head so he is wearing a wig in this film. Logan identifies many of the actors that appear on-screen and lists off some of their other credits. For those not familiar, he points out various customs of Chinese and Japanese culture which really enhances what we are watching.

""Spotlight on a Legend: A Tribute to Celebrated Martial Arts Icon Lau Kar-Leung."" Bey Logan talks at length about the man interspersed with clips from several of his films.

""Hero of Shaolin"" is an interview with Gordon Liu. He says that his father wanted him to follow a more conventional career path but he had other ideas. Liu took martial arts classes and became very proficient and serious about it. He talks about the Hong Kong film industry in the 1970s and how Bruce Lee's death impacted it. Liu talks about the genesis of Heroes of the East and working on it, including how he communicated with the actors who only spoke Japanese.

Finally, there is ""Shaolin vs. Ninja"" which takes a look at the martial arts weapon forms of China and Japan and features experts demonstrating the proper way to handle these weapons used in the film mixed with clips from it. This is a really interesting and engaging primer.",1212969600,9,1417,4.570866141732283
3053186,5,B0010X741O,"This is one of the best martial arts movies of all time. Fun story with humorous moments and fights that will boggle the mind. The various match ups between different various weapons and the choreography involved is exciting to watch and a real treat for fans of weapons in general. This movie showcases plenty of cool martial arts styles and what they could look like if they were used in a battle against each other. Btw, if you love games like Soul Calibur then check out this film! It's like watching a live-action version of that game. :D",1212105600,2,543,4.551020408163265

3053188,5,B0010X741O,"Heroes of the East is a fantastic cinematic presentation of Chinese and Japanese fighting styles put up against each other to see which is the better one. Gordon Liu(36 Chambers of Shaolin) stars as Ah To in this movie and does a fantastic job. The fight scenes are really well done representing both the Japanese and Chinese styles of fighting without one necessarily being the dominant one. I hope Dragon Dynasty continues its great DVD releases of classic films like this one.

Special Features were excellent also. They included feature commentary with Bey Logan, 22 minute tribute to Martial Arts icon Lau Kar-Leung, 20 minute interview with Gordon Liu, and a 26 minute Shaolin vs Ninja Martial Arts Weapons presentation which was very interesting.",1212019200,21,753,5.07258064516129
3053189,5,B0010X741O,"Apples vs. oranges, Chevy vs. Ford, Yankees vs. Red Sox, vanilla vs. chocolate... all great debates to be sure, but they pale in comparison to the best debate of them all, Chinese Martial Arts vs. Japanese Martial Arts! This Lau Kar-Leung(who also appears as a drunken master!) film, that also goes by the far worse title, ""Shaolin Challenges Ninja,"" delivers this battle in fantastic fashion with tons of style and charm to spare. The plot has Gordon Liu in an arranged marriage to Japanese actress Yuko Mizuno and instantly their cultures and beliefs clash, most importantly when it comes to just who has the best fighting techniques the world over. In typical Kar-Leung film fashion the movie has a light playful tone, however; unlike some of his other attempts it's never corny and obnoxious and Gordon and Yuko in particular have fun with the situations while still keeping a serious tone about everything. The Japanese masters that are brought in to challenge Gordon are all great and bring personality and flavor with the small amount of screen time each is given (by actual Japanese actors). When these duels occur we get everything you could ever hope for including Kung Fu vs. Karate, Long Sword vs. Kitana, Butterfly Knives vs. Sais, 3 Section Staff vs. Nunchuku (in the closest we'll ever get to seeing Liu take on Bruce Lee... and this guy is an obvious clone), and more! One knock I do have with the movie is that Chinese master Liu tends to pawn the Japanese masters in exciting but fairly one-sided duels. Still, this is a Chinese film (if it was Japanese I'm sure things would be quite the opposite) and the Japanese masters are all treated respectfully even in defeat. This is a top 10 martial arts movie for myself and many other fans of Kung Fu cinema so if you haven't seen this yet then do yourself a favor and check it out ASAP!  For those that already own the DVD from bootleg hacks Red Sun, I implore you to do the right thing and purchase this version from Dragon Dynasty... not only will there be a nice selection of bonus material included BUT it will also show that martial arts fans are willing to pay for top-notch respectable releases of classic Kung Fu films(especially Shaw Bros movies).  Who out there wouldn't love to see other chop socky masterpieces like Five Deadly Venoms, 8 Diagram Pole Fighter, Enter The Fat Dragon, The Kid With The Golden Arm, Shaolin Vs Lama, and so many others get more than just a bootleg treatment?  Thank you Dragon Dynasty for taking a chance on this release and hopefully it's a step towards more quality genre titles in the near future(Come Drink With Me is coming soon too!).",1208563200,68,2645,4.683870967741935
3053190,5,B0010X741O,"Probably the most entertaining Shaw Bros. film ever! Possibly the most fun Liu and Lau had making a Shaw Bros. film ever!! Positively the most amazing demonstrations of various Chinese and Japanese weapons, styles, philosophies, and attitudes about Martial Arts in any ""Kung Fu vs Karate"" or ""Wuxia vs Ninja"" or ""China vs Japan"" film made at Shaw Bros. or any other studio in Hong Kong, Tokyo, or anywhere else in the world, ever!!! And no one dies, or gets beat to a bloody pulp because it was meant to be entertaining, and fun, and amazing... And it's all that and a bag of shurikan's!

3053194,3,B0010X741O,"Heroes of the East 6 out of 10. I am going to be nice here. I know this Shaw brothers picture is a favorite of some. If you like seeing different martial arts styles going against each other in interesting and colorful ways. You are in for a treat. If you like a story with your fighting you may be in for a long haul.

The basic plot is an arranged marriage between a nice Chinese martial artist (Yay) and a horrible Japanese bride (Boo.). And the bride is horrible. It turns out she doesnt follow any of the nice Chinese customs like a normal person but instead follows those weird Japanese customs  (Boo). To make matters worse she is a martial artist in her own right. But instead of doing good working class All-American Chinese martial arts (Yay) She does the sneaky, underhanded Japanese martial Arts (Boo).

As one might surmise from the paragraph above the movie is slightly weighted to the Chinese point of view. This proves problematic as the wife (played by Yuka Mizuno) is neither attractive enough nor has the personality to convince me that her husband would pursue her back to Japan after she beat him up and destroyed his family home.

Nevertheless, he sends a message asking her to come back to him and it is misinterpreted as a challenge to all of Japans top martial artists.  So we are then treated to some pretty good match-ups between Japanese and Chinese martial arts in everything from sword work to throwing stars.

I see Wikipedia gives the film credit for not making the Japanese the bad guys as was the norm in Hong Kong cinema. (I am assuming they are grading on a curve). They do note that the fights are all honorable and without fatalities and that I agree is a nice change of pace.  If the thought of seeing a Japanese Kusarigama vs. a Chinese Rope Dart or Japanese Crab-style vs. Chinese Fujian White Crane fills you with glee this is certainly a movie for you. If you are looking for an actual story the premise may come across as a little thin.",1493769600,,1980,4.483333333333333

Yes some of the fighting is definitely staged but the story negates this as a shortcoming. Yuko Mizuno is absolutely beautiful! One only movie known to her credit.
This is sort of a Kramer vs. Kramer martial arts style with Asian philosophy tying up the differences. How would have Bruce Lee managed humor in a martial arts film or such a marriage?

I was very impressed by the great choreography.

3053386,5,B0010X741O,"The story seems simple but the results are extraordinary: a Chinese Kung Fu expert marries a Japanese woman schooled in Japanese martial arts.  A simple cultural misunderstanding leads to her teacher and several of his senior students traveling from Japan to China to challenge him for the honor of their country.  He accepts and what follows is a one on one pairing of Chinese martial arts and its Japanese counterparts.  Sai vs Butterfly swords.  Chinese spear vs Japanese spear.  Karate vs Drunken style.  Nunchucks vs Three sectional staff (this is Gordon Liu, after all).

One tip - watch it with subtitles.  All Hong Kong movies display the acting talent better in subtitles.  But in this case, the subtitled version shows the actors speaking in Japanese and Chinese (a key part of the movie).  For some reason, when it was dubbed, everyone speaks the same language, which makes some parts confusing.

Somehow, the film is at least as exciting and fun as any of the kung-fu films catering to audience bloodlust, and for this reason I would highly recommend it. There is, in fact, not even any blood in it, and if you think something like this can't possibly exist and still be fun to watch, save that judgement until you see it.",1361664000,,603,4.541284403669724

3053389,5,B0010X741O,"There are roughly 1200 ""old school"" kung fu movies that were produced from the late 60's to the mid 80's. Shaw Brothers made 850 of them. Of that only 60 will be worth viewing for one reason or another. Of that, only 10 might considered excellent. But only maybe 5 would make the list for the most accurate, real usage of kung fu put to film.
This is simply because if you hold Gordon Lius movies side by side in the fight scenes of these 5, then everything else pales.
All real Hung Gar Gung Fu. All the weapons used by Gordon Liu were trained while studying Hung Gar as well as all the empty hand material.
The movie itself happens to be one of the most western mind-set movies. Husband and wife marry and quarrel over who's best. Only light comedic elements were used. No one is seriously hurt. No revenge. Just a great story that is easy to follow.
Heroes of the East also features quite simply the most beautifully choreograhed fight scenes put to the Jade Screen.
Filmed close enough to see every detail but far enough back to feel like you are standing there. Shots are centered and the camera only cuts when necessary. Each shot is held Seperate. No multiple cut angles.
Every practioner from Japan was a real martial artist in each art. Karate, Judo, Ninjintsu and the others were all experts in sai vs. butterfly knives, spear vs. tasseled spear, 3 sectional vs. nunchaku and tonfa, Samauri sword vs. straight sword and karate vs. monkey gung fu.
Every major combination of Chinese vs. Japanese weapon was matched. It all looked like real weighted weapons really clashing in the most beautifully filmed fights ever.
That puts Heroes of the East as simply THE #1 MOVIE OF ALL TIME. Even overshadowing 36th Chamber of Shaolin to the #2 spot because of the extensive fighting over training. And #3 is 8 Diagram Pole fighter, #4 Shaolin vs. Wutang (Gordon also directed this one) and #5 but perhaps the next one you should buy is Fists and Guts. Solely because the fight scene midway through is framed like Heroes of the East. Other than the first 4 movies... no other fight scenes, not even in Gordons other movies, are up to par with these 4",1340582400,6,2149,4.541237113402062
3053400,2,B0010X741O,"I can't believe I bought this video.  The underlying premise of the movie, a Chinese martial artist marries a Japanese women who exposes her breasts while practicing karate, knocks down walls and destroys objects in her husband's house, refuses to obey her husband and finally removes all of her husband's martial arts equipment and replaces it with her own.  Is this a joke?  In this time period a Japanese (or Chinese) women would do this?  Oh it get's better.  She leaves him and goes back to Japan for comfort from her long time Nina (male) friend.  The husband send a letter to purposes a contest with his wife to see which is better, Chinese or Japanese martial arts.  Her Ninja buddy takes this as a challenge, so he brings nine of his friends to fight the spurned husband.  He must be the first Japanese Ninja coward.  Nine on one.  One of the 'experts' he brings to China has a twitchy mustache, and behavs much like Charlie Chaplin.  It's definitely a ""what the hell is this?"" scene.

3053402,5,B0010X741O,"I waited a long time before I watched Heroes of the East. Often, I hear so many good things about a movie that I am afraid I won't like it because the movie may not live up to the hype. This one does! The story is about Ah To (pronounced like Ah-TOE, played by Gordon Liu), who is in an arranged marriage with a Japanese girl. Initially, he rejects her as he remembers her as being an ""ugly little girl"", but swiftly changes his mind when they meet as adults. Thankfully, she is quite beautiful and mannerable. They soon marry. Then not long after, Kuda, his wife immediately make her martial presence known.

She is very sweet, but loves to practice her Japanese martial arts. Ah To is very accepting at first, until he realizes her Karate fighting style exposes her female form a bit too much for his taste, before the leering eyes of household servants. He cautions her to stop, and tries to encourage her to try a Chinese martial arts as it is much more subdued and elegant, but Kuda is very much a ""Japanese girl"" and prefers her own style. She quickly learns her husband is a kung fu expert, and soon a contested rivalry between them begins.

Kuda sets out to prove that her martial arts is better, initiating several fights. In doing so, she is bested by her husband, becomes angry, and returns home to Japan, leaving him behind. Ah To tries to win her back, writing a letter. But the letter is intercepted by her Sensei, a handsome Japanese man. He takes offense to the letter, which happens to tease her that Chinese Martial arts is better, and challenges her to come back for more of their intimate sparrings. Instead, the Sensei and a group of Japanese fighters return, ready to fight Ah To.

Magnificient movie and display of martial arts on all sides. Lau Kar Leung director/action choreographer makes a cameo as a drunken master, which was pretty sweet. I don't think I've seen a plot so well executed in a long time.
It also reminded me a bit of movies later to come, like Martial Club, which pitted three rivaling kung fu schools against each other but more closely to the plot of this movie, is My Young Auntie, in which the two romantic leads also had a hotly contested rivalry in martial arts with the young aunt employing a more classic style and the young nephew (and love interest) embodying something a bit more modern. All of these are excellent films, as to be expected when Liu, or Lau Kar Leung are involved. Very well done and highly recommended by me.",1324166400,,2480,4.494456762749445
3053403,5,B0010X741O,"I reviewed an old bootleg of this and gave it 4-stars, which means I liked it immensely.  While the movie was immediately enjoyable to me and most fans of classic 70s kung fu, additional viewings have yielded tasty, unforeseen fruit!  This flick gets better every time I watch it! And there is no other film quite like it!  A unique story and a reasonable quantity of authentic styles & weapons.  Plus the always awesome Yasuaki Kurata (""Fist of Legend"")! Throw in Dragon Dynasty putting out this legitimate edition, loaded with special features and this flick has now been officially upgraded!

Gordon Liu (""The 36th Chamber of Shaolin"") is arranged to be married to a Japanese woman (Mizuno Yuko), which he's not the least bit thrilled about; until he sees how pretty and kind she is. So he goes through with it and all is well until she starts boasting about the superiority of Japanese fighting styles.  That's when he finds out how stubborn she is. Eventually they spar and Gordon is victorious.  He's the more tolerant of the two but really coulda handled it better and she stomps back to Japan. Hoping for her return he attempts to exploit her tenacity by issuing her a challenge. Unfortunately the letter is intercepted by some of her superiors thinking he is challenging them and insulting their martial arts.  A small group of 'em soon show up at Gordon's door for a one-fight-a-day reply!  Whoops!

As most of the characters are a tad bit biased toward their paritcular art, director Lau Kar Leung (""Legend of the Drunken Master"") kinda comes off the same.  HOWEVER, one should consider that when this was made, in films of this genre, the Japanese were rarely (if ever) portrayed as anything but cruel nationalists. Here they are anything BUT one-dimensional supporting players!  The two sides develop a mutual respect for one another's art, and it has an overall theme of tolerance.  For that it deserves a TON of credit!  Oh, and as an additional old-school rarity, some of the humor actually translates and the small amount that's painful is kept brief.

Dragon Dynasty gives us another stellar version of a Shaw Brothers classic with the gorgeous picture quality that Celestial has restored for the studio's repertoire.  Languages include Mandarin, Cantonese and English.  Optional subtitles in English or Spanish.  Special features include one of the more informative commentaries by Hong Kong Cinema Expert Bey Logan and the following mini-documentaries: SPOTLIGHT ON A LEGEND: a Tribute to Celebrated Martial Arts Icon Lau Kar-Leung with Bey Logan.  HERO OF SHAOLIN: An Exclusive Interview With Leading Man Gordon Liu.  SHAOLIN VS. NINJA: An Exploration of the Legendary Martial Arts Weapon Forms of China and Japan.  Oh, and a trailer gallery.

3053407,5,B0010X741O,"I am a self-admitted kung fu flix junkie. I became addicted to this from watching ""Kung Fu Theater"" on TV from the early 80s on. Much like many other genres or particular themed movies, there are good ones, there are bad ones, and some that outright suck.

This is one of the best I've ever gotten to watch. I'm surprized I've never even seen (or at least remember) snippets or clips before seeing this DVD. This was filmed just after ""36th Chamber of Shaolin"" (1978), probably the ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) of kung fu movies. This film also has the title of ""Shaolin vs Ninja""

Strengths: almost too many to list. First is Gordon Lui as Ah To, son of a well-to-do businessman who gets married. (If you've never seen him with hair, it's funny.) His chosen wife is Japanese who is adept at Japanese martial arts, and is practically wrecking the household with her constant practicing. Second is director Lau Kar-Leung, who is also one of the very best director / action direction / choreographers in the business. Lau also is one director who does not indulge in fights drenched in blood and death, so don't expect any. Lau puts on a brief demonstration of 'drunken boxing' style as a lighter moment during the second half. Third is the chief Japanese antagonist, Yasuaki Kurata, one of the greatest actors of the genre (and still going strong today at age 63). Fourth, the weapons action--in fact the multiple matches seen makes up the second half, and the varieties seen. Unique here is one gets to see the chinese weapon of choice (including my favorite, the 3-section staff) and the approximate Japanese version / equivalent. No other film will ever show so many in use or matched in such a way.

The plot is understandable and starts out more of a comedy starting out as a 'battle of the sexes' through the lens of cultural differences (Chinese vs Japanese) regarding their respective martial arts and the philosophies integrated into them. Typical for this type of film, don't expect great dramatic acting or dialogue, but this has very little campy acting, and does not get mired in bad stereotypes. Unusual aspect of this film is it isn't a 'bash the Japs' type of Hong Kong movie that were more common. Ah To's wife leaves in a pique back to Japan, and Ah To makes a tactical mistake by listening to his obsequious house servant and writing a letter that was interpreted as a challenge to his wife. The direction turns more to drama as his wife has a serious suitor (Kurata-san) in Japan who takes it as an affront to all Japanese martial arts, and goes to China to answer the challenge. And for extra measure, brings along a number of masters, each adept in a particular Japanese martial art or weapon. Each cannot back down because of the sense of honor.

Weakness: I could nitpick but overall Heroes of the East (title doesn't quite the action or plot) is well made, consistently interesting, isn't overly predictable (other than match outcomes) and really doesn't get bogged down like most movies will, however the ending scene was really weak. Was the challenge really resolved? Did Ah To win his wife back? What was that moral message again?

A more thorough review can be found at [...]. Description of the weapons can be found at: [...].

If you like good martial arts movies, this is a cornerstone film for any DVD library. So if you don't have it, then get it.",1290297600,,3374,4.652684563758389
3053408,5,B0010X741O,"HEROES OF THE EAST is also known by the more badasss title SHAOLIN CHALLENGES NINJA, but whatever you call this movie, doesn't alter the fact that it is one of the most entertaining vehicle for martial arts ever put to cinema. No one dies in this one, so there's none of that extra gratuitous thrill. Rather, the focus is on the remarkable exhibition of techniques encompassing various disciplines in the Japanese and Chinese martial arts. It's been a while since I saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-36th-Chamber-of-Shaolin/dp/B000MM0LEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 36th Chamber of Shaolin</a>, but HEROES OF THE EAST may be my favorite Gordon Liu flick.

The misunderstandings here get more blown out of proportion than in an episode of Three's Company. Cultural clashes and notions of impropriety quickly surface when an arranged marriage hooks up a proud Chinese man and a willful Japanese woman. It starts at the wedding ceremony when the Japanese bride Kung Zi unwittingly wears white, the color of death in Chinese culture. Ah To, himself a student of kung fu, then learns that Kung Zi is a practitioner of karate, and he promptly contends that her style is brash and unladylike. It doesn't help that Kung Zi while training breezily wrecks the family garden, demolishing those decorative little stone statues and such. When Ah To shows off his Chinese kung fu, Kung Zi scornfully taunts him: ""When you practice with it, it's like dancing."" When Kung Zi demonstrates her more forceful moves, Ah To lets her know: ""All that noise, it's like a beggar driving dogs away."" Marital bliss gets kicked to the curb.

Thanks to a pretty stupid scheme of Ah To's cringing tattletale servant, things escalate even further, and before you can say ""Can't we all just get along?"" seven of Japan's foremost martial artists, each a master of a particular discipline, storm Ah-To's home to challenge him in a series of one-on-one duels.

These challenges play out superbly. Another fun element is that no sooner does one fight end than we immediately learn Ah To's next challenger, and then we watch Ah To, in his allotted time of rest, try to come up with the proper counter. These skirmishes are wonderfully choreographed and hold up spectacularly well today. One outstanding sequence is Ah To versus the kendo master (or, more properly, iaido master) and what Ah To does here actually worsens things. Further highlights are the nunchuk and tonfa versus three-sectioned staff sequence and the sai versus butterfly sword sequence (and I got a kick out of the odd little sai master with his French mustache and his twitchy mouth). Ah To versus the judo master falls out more like a comedy routine, as Ah To bests him in a pretty underhanded (but clever) manner. I did think that the finale which is Ah To taking on the master ninja, while pretty decent, goes on a bit too long. Surprisingly, the ninja's employment of the ""Japanese crab fist"" isn't as cheesy as it sounds.

Director Lao Kar-Leung, himself an accomplished and highly respected martial artist, has a wonderful cameo as the drunken boxing master whose style Ah To must lift. Lao Kar-Leung also doubles Gordon Liu in some of the tricker moves with the three-sectioned staff.

Unlike films like FISTS OF FURY, HEROES OF THE EAST doesn't portray the Japanese martial artists as evil goons. Legendary director Lao Kar-Leung instills a sense of dignity in the Japanese contemporaries and even though the challengers lose, there's respect there. Gordon Liu was a superstar in the late '70s and '80s and you can see why. Liu not only has the requisite skills of a martial arts icon, but he's got presence and swagger and grace. Even if it's a wig he's got on for this picture (around this time, Gordon Liu was still shaving his head regularly because of his shaolin monk roles). Mizuno Yuko, who plays Kung Zi, is herself a skilled martial artist and she holds up very well when sparring with Liu. What's more, you do get the sense that the two lead characters are genuinely in love, and that lends a sweet emotional core to what otherwise would only have been a technical exercise in Chinese and Japanese martial arts. As it is, HEROES OF THE EAST is one of the finest films of its genre that I've ever seen. And the way it ends, not with bloodshed and gruesome deaths, but with mutual respect after an exhibition of prowess and skills, well, that's pretty much a philosophical linchpin of martial arts, isn't it? Makes me want to go in the garden and practice maneuvers like the ""Cripple Li Carrying Water"" and chop down innocent garden gnomes. Such an awesome movie.

The DVD from Dragon Dynasty offers up several nifty special features: feature commentary from Hong Kong Cinema Expert Bey Logan; ""Spotlight on a Legend"" - a tribute to celebrated martial arts icon and director Lao Kar-Leung, hosted by Bey Logan (00:36:08 minutes); ""Hero of a Shaolin"" - an interview with Gordon Liu as he talks about his career and, specifically, about this film (00:22:13); ""Shaolin vs. Ninja""  (00:26:10) - this is a really interesting segment with a Japanese Iaido master, a Hung Gar weapons master, and an Okinawan bo master breaking down techniques in their craft; and the original theatrical trailers for HEROES OF THE EAST and COME DRINK WITH ME.",1275696000,4,5338,4.944258639910814
3053409,3,B0010X741O,"I purchased this movie based upon the reviews here at Amazon and although I did enjoy the action scenes I felt more perplexed than (apparently) most other reviewers.

It was difficult for me to discern whether the female lead was actually that; a female. Only after the cleavage shot while sparring with her new husband did I allow myself to trust it was a woman, but only for the sake of creative license.
Although the fight scenes were entertaining it was difficult for me to believe that one ""student"" had mastered seven different disciplines to the degree where none of the Japanese ""masters"" were capable of defeating him. The Shaw Brothers are definitely from China which is evidenced in this somewhat one-sided film.  I'll hazard a guess but the same probably holds true here in the USA to our older cowboy and indian movies (pre 1979) where the indians did not fare well.  I've given this film a three star rating for the well choreographed action sequences, believing it must have been fun to direct.  If you are looking for examples of various fighting styles this movie may be for you, if you are looking for substance please continue your quest.

Admittedly, I am spoiled by films such as, The Shadowless Sword, The Warrior, Aragami, Legend of the Black Scorpion, The Restless, Seven Swords, Warriors of Heaven and Earth...(my list goes on and on).",1261872000,4,1360,4.794871794871795
3053420,5,B0010X741O,"I have already enjoyed ""HEROES OF THE EAST"" (aka ""SHAOLIN CHALLENGES NINJA"") for over 15 years, first having seen it on video tape, then on DVD and now on this excellent Dragon Dynasty edition DVD.

IMHO, this is one of their best yet, if not THE best, releases.  The movie is finally restored (thanks to Celestial Pictures), to its ShawScope glory, with both Mandarin and Cantonese soundtracks (as well as that good 'ol, clunky English dub, which I doubt I will ever listen to again!), and a bevy of cool special features.

There are so many reviews of both the film itself and the special features here (and elsewhere), I will only add that this movie is one of the great kung fu movies of all time. It is rare in that there are no deaths and not even any serious injuries (except perhaps to an ego here and there!).  It is a movie about sharing culture, about the challenges in any marriage, and especially in a marriage where there is a culture barrier.  It is a story about being patient and loving anyway (but that message is covert. This is not a romance, nor a ""chick-flick"" yet, I do believe that many women will enjoy it, even if they are not big martial art fans, and I also think it is good for kids).

The martial arts in this film, directed and choreographed by the great real and film martial arts master Lau Kar Leung (and he even makes a great cameo as the Drunken Master ""Beggar Su"", in addition to filling in for his adopted brother, student and lead actor Gordon Liu on some difficult moves, most especially with the weapon, Three Sectional Staff.  I always knew that the moves behind the back were NOT Gordon Liu, but I did not know, until the commentary by Bey Logan, that it was Lau Sifu) are some of the best ever.  It is mostly pretty realistic (and even the exceptions are still pretty cool to watch) kung fu choreography, with little wire work (almost none, if any), few special effects shots, and believable fights (again Bey Logan's commentary helped me, because the few fights that are not completely believable, I always had a little trouble with, and it is nice to hear confirmation about those.  E.g. A Chinese straight sword would not and could not stand up to full contact with a Samurai sword.  The Chinese sword would break. Period!). THe exceptions are few and as I say, still fun and work within the context of the story.

And the story is a good one.  A truly great martial arts movie or action movie of any kind, should have the action help tell the story.  And this one does.

The special features on this disc are generous and quality.  I loved Bey Logan's commentary and half hour tribute to Lau Sifu and the movie itself.  I really like Bey's commentaries.  I could almost see myself getting any and all DD releases just for those, even though I might not love the film.  But on this one, not only do I love the film, but it is one of his best commentaries.  His obvious love and respect for Lau Sifu and for the film itself, is both evident and enhances my enjoyment of the movie itself.

Gordon Liu's interview is also about a half hour (or at least 25 minutes) and also is very interesting. While he repeats some of what he has said in other interviews on other DD releases, there is plenty specific to this movie that makes it very special and interesting (e.g. how he and the Japanese actress who played his wife were able to ""bond"" a bit on a date before filming and also how they worked out a little code, so they could know when it was their cue, since neither spoke the other's language!).

And the feature about Japanese and Chinese weapons was also interesting and the woman who was the host for this was kinda cute!

This is my favorite DD release thus far by far.  It is tremendously entertaining with lots of repeatability for viewing pleasure and I also continue to learn a lot, both from the movie and from the special features.

""HEROES OF THE EAST"" was already one of my favorite kung fu movies of all time (and I admit, I am still missing having seen a few classics, such as ""THE PRODIGAL SON"", and have never seen all of Jet Li's ""FIST OF LEGEND""... not more than a few scenes in a video store in Times Square over 15 years ago!  I know, I know: I should be ashamed of myself.  It is next on my list!).  But I have seen a good deal of the Shaw Brothers 70's and early 80's classics and again, this has already ranked up with my favorites (most notably, ""THE 36th CHAMBER OF SHAOLIN"", aka ""THE MASTER KILLER"").

Now, with this DD release, I think ""HEROES OF THE EAST"" climbs up to tie with anything as number one.  For me, now, there may be those that are as good, but none better.

This combination of kung fu experts in different roles makes for a unique action movie from the perspective of martial artists.

3053428,5,B0010X741O,"It's a beautiful thing to see a Shaw Brothers film get the five star treatment, but it's even better when the movie itself is a five star film, like this classic from Liu Chia-liang (Lau Kar-leung).  His movies rarely disappoint, in fact, some of his failures are superior than other's successes.  My personal fave from him is ""36th Chamber of Shaolin"", but this is just a tiny notch below that one.  It's a totally unique take on the familiar topic of Chinese vs. Japanese.  Instead of it being down the line & doing a ""virtuous"" Chinese avenging themselves against ""wicked"" Japanese, Lau crafts a very subtle & realistic story.  The cause for the combat is over miscommunication & misunderstanding, not because somebody is a nefarious villain.  Get this, nobody gets injured in this film, much less killed; all the martial bouts are tests of skill, not duels to the death.  I like that aspect, and this is coming from a huge Chang Cheh fan.

Lau's half-brother, Gordon, does a great job (as usual) portraying the lead Ho Tao, as does Yuka Mizuno as his somewhat immature Japanese wife.  The culture clash seems absolutely authentic.  Lau made a very smart move employing real Japanese fighters to play Gordon's combatants, and the bouts are appropriately matched up; gim vs. katana, karate vs. kung fu, spear vs. yari, 3-sectioned staff vs. tonfa/nunchaku, butterfly knives vs. sai, culminating with the Japanese crab technique vs. Chinese crane style.  Gordon takes on everybody, Yasuaki Kurata gives an incredible performance as the ninjitsu expert leading his team.  Many familiar Shaw actors can be seen like Norman Chu, Wilson Tong, Ching Miao & Cheng Kang-yeh.  Director Lau also shapes up the awesome fu and even plays the Drunken God expert Gordon tries to learn from.  That character looks like a younger version of the drunk sifu Simon Yuen (who plays Gordon's sifu here) portrayed in ""Drunken Master"".  Not only did Dragon Dynasty remaster the picture with it's widescreen Shawscope ratio (Arthur Wong's cinematography is stunning), but you can watch the movie either in Chinese with remastered subtitles (which emphasizes the language barrier better) or in a decent English dub.  Don't miss the tribute to the man himself, Lau kar-leung or the awesome interview with Gordon Liu in the special features.",1215907200,,2316,5.023560209424084

At the time, Gordon Liu was doing Shaolin monk roles in films and had a shaved head so he is wearing a wig in this film. Logan identifies many of the actors that appear on-screen and lists off some of their other credits. For those not familiar, he points out various customs of Chinese and Japanese culture which really enhances what we are watching.

""Spotlight on a Legend: A Tribute to Celebrated Martial Arts Icon Lau Kar-Leung."" Bey Logan talks at length about the man interspersed with clips from several of his films.

""Hero of Shaolin"" is an interview with Gordon Liu. He says that his father wanted him to follow a more conventional career path but he had other ideas. Liu took martial arts classes and became very proficient and serious about it. He talks about the Hong Kong film industry in the 1970s and how Bruce Lee's death impacted it. Liu talks about the genesis of Heroes of the East and working on it, including how he communicated with the actors who only spoke Japanese.

Finally, there is ""Shaolin vs. Ninja"" which takes a look at the martial arts weapon forms of China and Japan and features experts demonstrating the proper way to handle these weapons used in the film mixed with clips from it.

This Lau Kar-Leung(who also appears as a drunken master!) film, that also goes by the far worse title, ""Shaolin Challenges Ninja,"" delivers this battle in fantastic fashion with tons of style and charm to spare. The plot has Gordon Liu in an arranged marriage to Japanese actress Yuko Mizuno and instantly their cultures and beliefs clash, most importantly when it comes to just who has the best fighting techniques the world over. In typical Kar-Leung film fashion the movie has a light playful tone, however; unlike some of his other attempts it's never corny and obnoxious and Gordon and Yuko in particular have fun with the situations while still keeping a serious tone about everything. The Japanese masters that are brought in to challenge Gordon are all great and bring personality and flavor with the small amount of screen time each is given (by actual Japanese actors). When these duels occur we get everything you could ever hope for including Kung Fu vs. Karate, Long Sword vs. Kitana, Butterfly Knives vs. Sais, 3 Section Staff vs. Nunchuku (in the closest we'll ever get to seeing Liu take on Bruce Lee... and this guy is an obvious clone), and more! One knock I do have with the movie is that Chinese master Liu tends to pawn the Japanese masters in exciting but fairly one-sided duels. Still, this is a Chinese film (if it was Japanese I'm sure things would be quite the opposite) and the Japanese masters are all treated respectfully even in defeat. This is a top 10 martial arts movie for myself and many other fans of Kung Fu cinema so if you haven't seen this yet then do yourself a favor and check it out ASAP!  For those that already own the DVD from bootleg hacks Red Sun, I implore you to do the right thing and purchase this version from Dragon Dynasty... not only will there be a nice selection of bonus material included BUT it will also show that martial arts fans are willing to pay for top-notch respectable releases of classic Kung Fu films(especially Shaw Bros movies).  Who out there wouldn't love to see other chop socky masterpieces like Five Deadly Venoms, 8 Diagram Pole Fighter, Enter The Fat Dragon, The Kid With The Golden Arm, Shaolin Vs Lama, and so many others get more than just a bootleg treatment?  Thank you Dragon Dynasty for taking a chance on this release and hopefully it's a step towards more quality genre titles in the near future(Come Drink With Me is coming soon too!).",1208563200,68,2645,4.683870967741935

If you like seeing different martial arts styles going against each other in interesting and colorful ways. You are in for a treat. If you like a story with your fighting you may be in for a long haul.

The basic plot is an arranged marriage between a nice Chinese martial artist (Yay) and a horrible Japanese bride (Boo.). And the bride is horrible. It turns out she doesnt follow any of the nice Chinese customs like a normal person but instead follows those weird Japanese customs  (Boo). To make matters worse she is a martial artist in her own right. But instead of doing good working class All-American Chinese martial arts (Yay) She does the sneaky, underhanded Japanese martial Arts (Boo).

As one might surmise from the paragraph above the movie is slightly weighted to the Chinese point of view. This proves problematic as the wife (played by Yuka Mizuno) is neither attractive enough nor has the personality to convince me that her husband would pursue her back to Japan after she beat him up and destroyed his family home.

Nevertheless, he sends a message asking her to come back to him and it is misinterpreted as a challenge to all of Japans top martial artists.  So we are then treated to some pretty good match-ups between Japanese and Chinese martial arts in everything from sword work to throwing stars.

I see Wikipedia gives the film credit for not making the Japanese the bad guys as was the norm in Hong Kong cinema. (I am assuming they are grading on a curve). They do note that the fights are all honorable and without fatalities and that I agree is a nice change of pace.  If the thought of seeing a Japanese Kusarigama vs. a Chinese Rope Dart or Japanese Crab-style vs. Chinese Fujian White Crane fills you with glee this is certainly a movie for you.

After Tao repeatedly proves his dominance, Yumiko decides to flee in anger back to Japan. What happens next results in Yumiko bringing back a whole gang of Japanese martial artists and day after day of excellent fighting match-ups.",1399161600,,733,4.817460317460317

The one thing that bothered me was the Chinese hero in this was kind of a immature jerk and was not even a master but a student of Kung Fu but he beat all of the Japanese masters.

Yes some of the fighting is definitely staged but the story negates this as a shortcoming. Yuko Mizuno is absolutely beautiful! One only movie known to her credit.
This is sort of a Kramer vs. Kramer martial arts style with Asian philosophy tying up the differences. How would have Bruce Lee managed humor in a martial arts film or such a marriage?

One tip - watch it with subtitles.  All Hong Kong movies display the acting talent better in subtitles.  But in this case, the subtitled version shows the actors speaking in Japanese and Chinese (a key part of the movie).

3287886,5,B0010X741O,"There are roughly 1200 ""old school"" kung fu movies that were produced from the late 60's to the mid 80's. Shaw Brothers made 850 of them. Of that only 60 will be worth viewing for one reason or another. Of that, only 10 might considered excellent. But only maybe 5 would make the list for the most accurate, real usage of kung fu put to film.
This is simply because if you hold Gordon Lius movies side by side in the fight scenes of these 5, then everything else pales.
All real Hung Gar Gung Fu. All the weapons used by Gordon Liu were trained while studying Hung Gar as well as all the empty hand material.
The movie itself happens to be one of the most western mind-set movies. Husband and wife marry and quarrel over who's best. Only light comedic elements were used. No one is seriously hurt. No revenge. Just a great story that is easy to follow.
Heroes of the East also features quite simply the most beautifully choreograhed fight scenes put to the Jade Screen.
Filmed close enough to see every detail but far enough back to feel like you are standing there. Shots are centered and the camera only cuts when necessary. Each shot is held Seperate. No multiple cut angles.
Every practioner from Japan was a real martial artist in each art. Karate, Judo, Ninjintsu and the others were all experts in sai vs. butterfly knives, spear vs. tasseled spear, 3 sectional vs. nunchaku and tonfa, Samauri sword vs. straight sword and karate vs. monkey gung fu.
Every major combination of Chinese vs. Japanese weapon was matched. It all looked like real weighted weapons really clashing in the most beautifully filmed fights ever.
That puts Heroes of the East as simply THE #1 MOVIE OF ALL TIME. Even overshadowing 36th Chamber of Shaolin to the #2 spot because of the extensive fighting over training. And #3 is 8 Diagram Pole fighter, #4 Shaolin vs. Wutang (Gordon also directed this one) and #5 but perhaps the next one you should buy is Fists and Guts. Solely because the fight scene midway through is framed like Heroes of the East. Other than the first 4 movies... no other fight scenes, not even in Gordons other movies, are up to par with these 4",1340582400,6,2149,4.541237113402062

Is this a joke?  In this time period a Japanese (or Chinese) women would do this?  Oh it get's better.  She leaves him and goes back to Japan for comfort from her long time Nina (male) friend.

3287899,5,B0010X741O,"I waited a long time before I watched Heroes of the East. Often, I hear so many good things about a movie that I am afraid I won't like it because the movie may not live up to the hype. This one does! The story is about Ah To (pronounced like Ah-TOE, played by Gordon Liu), who is in an arranged marriage with a Japanese girl. Initially, he rejects her as he remembers her as being an ""ugly little girl"", but swiftly changes his mind when they meet as adults. Thankfully, she is quite beautiful and mannerable. They soon marry. Then not long after, Kuda, his wife immediately make her martial presence known.

She is very sweet, but loves to practice her Japanese martial arts. Ah To is very accepting at first, until he realizes her Karate fighting style exposes her female form a bit too much for his taste, before the leering eyes of household servants. He cautions her to stop, and tries to encourage her to try a Chinese martial arts as it is much more subdued and elegant, but Kuda is very much a ""Japanese girl"" and prefers her own style. She quickly learns her husband is a kung fu expert, and soon a contested rivalry between them begins.

Kuda sets out to prove that her martial arts is better, initiating several fights. In doing so, she is bested by her husband, becomes angry, and returns home to Japan, leaving him behind. Ah To tries to win her back, writing a letter. But the letter is intercepted by her Sensei, a handsome Japanese man. He takes offense to the letter, which happens to tease her that Chinese Martial arts is better, and challenges her to come back for more of their intimate sparrings. Instead, the Sensei and a group of Japanese fighters return, ready to fight Ah To.

Magnificient movie and display of martial arts on all sides. Lau Kar Leung director/action choreographer makes a cameo as a drunken master, which was pretty sweet. I don't think I've seen a plot so well executed in a long time.
It also reminded me a bit of movies later to come, like Martial Club, which pitted three rivaling kung fu schools against each other but more closely to the plot of this movie, is My Young Auntie, in which the two romantic leads also had a hotly contested rivalry in martial arts with the young aunt employing a more classic style and the young nephew (and love interest) embodying something a bit more modern. All of these are excellent films, as to be expected when Liu, or Lau Kar Leung are involved. Very well done and highly recommended by me.",1324166400,,2480,4.494456762749445
3287900,5,B0010X741O,"I reviewed an old bootleg of this and gave it 4-stars, which means I liked it immensely.  While the movie was immediately enjoyable to me and most fans of classic 70s kung fu, additional viewings have yielded tasty, unforeseen fruit!  This flick gets better every time I watch it! And there is no other film quite like it!  A unique story and a reasonable quantity of authentic styles & weapons.  Plus the always awesome Yasuaki Kurata (""Fist of Legend"")! Throw in Dragon Dynasty putting out this legitimate edition, loaded with special features and this flick has now been officially upgraded!

Gordon Liu (""The 36th Chamber of Shaolin"") is arranged to be married to a Japanese woman (Mizuno Yuko), which he's not the least bit thrilled about; until he sees how pretty and kind she is. So he goes through with it and all is well until she starts boasting about the superiority of Japanese fighting styles.  That's when he finds out how stubborn she is. Eventually they spar and Gordon is victorious.  He's the more tolerant of the two but really coulda handled it better and she stomps back to Japan. Hoping for her return he attempts to exploit her tenacity by issuing her a challenge. Unfortunately the letter is intercepted by some of her superiors thinking he is challenging them and insulting their martial arts.  A small group of 'em soon show up at Gordon's door for a one-fight-a-day reply!  Whoops!

As most of the characters are a tad bit biased toward their paritcular art, director Lau Kar Leung (""Legend of the Drunken Master"") kinda comes off the same.  HOWEVER, one should consider that when this was made, in films of this genre, the Japanese were rarely (if ever) portrayed as anything but cruel nationalists. Here they are anything BUT one-dimensional supporting players!  The two sides develop a mutual respect for one another's art, and it has an overall theme of tolerance.  For that it deserves a TON of credit!  Oh, and as an additional old-school rarity, some of the humor actually translates and the small amount that's painful is kept brief.

Dragon Dynasty gives us another stellar version of a Shaw Brothers classic with the gorgeous picture quality that Celestial has restored for the studio's repertoire.  Languages include Mandarin, Cantonese and English.  Optional subtitles in English or Spanish.  Special features include one of the more informative commentaries by Hong Kong Cinema Expert Bey Logan and the following mini-documentaries: SPOTLIGHT ON A LEGEND: a Tribute to Celebrated Martial Arts Icon Lau Kar-Leung with Bey Logan.  HERO OF SHAOLIN: An Exclusive Interview With Leading Man Gordon Liu.  SHAOLIN VS. NINJA: An Exploration of the Legendary Martial Arts Weapon Forms of China and Japan.  Oh, and a trailer gallery.

3287904,5,B0010X741O,"I am a self-admitted kung fu flix junkie. I became addicted to this from watching ""Kung Fu Theater"" on TV from the early 80s on. Much like many other genres or particular themed movies, there are good ones, there are bad ones, and some that outright suck.

This is one of the best I've ever gotten to watch. I'm surprized I've never even seen (or at least remember) snippets or clips before seeing this DVD. This was filmed just after ""36th Chamber of Shaolin"" (1978), probably the ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) of kung fu movies. This film also has the title of ""Shaolin vs Ninja""

Strengths: almost too many to list. First is Gordon Lui as Ah To, son of a well-to-do businessman who gets married. (If you've never seen him with hair, it's funny.) His chosen wife is Japanese who is adept at Japanese martial arts, and is practically wrecking the household with her constant practicing. Second is director Lau Kar-Leung, who is also one of the very best director / action direction / choreographers in the business. Lau also is one director who does not indulge in fights drenched in blood and death, so don't expect any. Lau puts on a brief demonstration of 'drunken boxing' style as a lighter moment during the second half. Third is the chief Japanese antagonist, Yasuaki Kurata, one of the greatest actors of the genre (and still going strong today at age 63). Fourth, the weapons action--in fact the multiple matches seen makes up the second half, and the varieties seen. Unique here is one gets to see the chinese weapon of choice (including my favorite, the 3-section staff) and the approximate Japanese version / equivalent. No other film will ever show so many in use or matched in such a way.

The plot is understandable and starts out more of a comedy starting out as a 'battle of the sexes' through the lens of cultural differences (Chinese vs Japanese) regarding their respective martial arts and the philosophies integrated into them. Typical for this type of film, don't expect great dramatic acting or dialogue, but this has very little campy acting, and does not get mired in bad stereotypes. Unusual aspect of this film is it isn't a 'bash the Japs' type of Hong Kong movie that were more common. Ah To's wife leaves in a pique back to Japan, and Ah To makes a tactical mistake by listening to his obsequious house servant and writing a letter that was interpreted as a challenge to his wife. The direction turns more to drama as his wife has a serious suitor (Kurata-san) in Japan who takes it as an affront to all Japanese martial arts, and goes to China to answer the challenge. And for extra measure, brings along a number of masters, each adept in a particular Japanese martial art or weapon. Each cannot back down because of the sense of honor.

Weakness: I could nitpick but overall Heroes of the East (title doesn't quite the action or plot) is well made, consistently interesting, isn't overly predictable (other than match outcomes) and really doesn't get bogged down like most movies will, however the ending scene was really weak. Was the challenge really resolved? Did Ah To win his wife back? What was that moral message again?

A more thorough review can be found at [...]. Description of the weapons can be found at: [...].

If you like good martial arts movies, this is a cornerstone film for any DVD library. So if you don't have it, then get it.",1290297600,,3374,4.652684563758389
3287905,5,B0010X741O,"HEROES OF THE EAST is also known by the more badasss title SHAOLIN CHALLENGES NINJA, but whatever you call this movie, doesn't alter the fact that it is one of the most entertaining vehicle for martial arts ever put to cinema. No one dies in this one, so there's none of that extra gratuitous thrill. Rather, the focus is on the remarkable exhibition of techniques encompassing various disciplines in the Japanese and Chinese martial arts. It's been a while since I saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-36th-Chamber-of-Shaolin/dp/B000MM0LEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 36th Chamber of Shaolin</a>, but HEROES OF THE EAST may be my favorite Gordon Liu flick.

The misunderstandings here get more blown out of proportion than in an episode of Three's Company. Cultural clashes and notions of impropriety quickly surface when an arranged marriage hooks up a proud Chinese man and a willful Japanese woman. It starts at the wedding ceremony when the Japanese bride Kung Zi unwittingly wears white, the color of death in Chinese culture. Ah To, himself a student of kung fu, then learns that Kung Zi is a practitioner of karate, and he promptly contends that her style is brash and unladylike. It doesn't help that Kung Zi while training breezily wrecks the family garden, demolishing those decorative little stone statues and such. When Ah To shows off his Chinese kung fu, Kung Zi scornfully taunts him: ""When you practice with it, it's like dancing."" When Kung Zi demonstrates her more forceful moves, Ah To lets her know: ""All that noise, it's like a beggar driving dogs away."" Marital bliss gets kicked to the curb.

Thanks to a pretty stupid scheme of Ah To's cringing tattletale servant, things escalate even further, and before you can say ""Can't we all just get along?"" seven of Japan's foremost martial artists, each a master of a particular discipline, storm Ah-To's home to challenge him in a series of one-on-one duels.

These challenges play out superbly. Another fun element is that no sooner does one fight end than we immediately learn Ah To's next challenger, and then we watch Ah To, in his allotted time of rest, try to come up with the proper counter. These skirmishes are wonderfully choreographed and hold up spectacularly well today. One outstanding sequence is Ah To versus the kendo master (or, more properly, iaido master) and what Ah To does here actually worsens things. Further highlights are the nunchuk and tonfa versus three-sectioned staff sequence and the sai versus butterfly sword sequence (and I got a kick out of the odd little sai master with his French mustache and his twitchy mouth). Ah To versus the judo master falls out more like a comedy routine, as Ah To bests him in a pretty underhanded (but clever) manner. I did think that the finale which is Ah To taking on the master ninja, while pretty decent, goes on a bit too long. Surprisingly, the ninja's employment of the ""Japanese crab fist"" isn't as cheesy as it sounds.

Director Lao Kar-Leung, himself an accomplished and highly respected martial artist, has a wonderful cameo as the drunken boxing master whose style Ah To must lift. Lao Kar-Leung also doubles Gordon Liu in some of the tricker moves with the three-sectioned staff.

Unlike films like FISTS OF FURY, HEROES OF THE EAST doesn't portray the Japanese martial artists as evil goons. Legendary director Lao Kar-Leung instills a sense of dignity in the Japanese contemporaries and even though the challengers lose, there's respect there. Gordon Liu was a superstar in the late '70s and '80s and you can see why. Liu not only has the requisite skills of a martial arts icon, but he's got presence and swagger and grace. Even if it's a wig he's got on for this picture (around this time, Gordon Liu was still shaving his head regularly because of his shaolin monk roles). Mizuno Yuko, who plays Kung Zi, is herself a skilled martial artist and she holds up very well when sparring with Liu. What's more, you do get the sense that the two lead characters are genuinely in love, and that lends a sweet emotional core to what otherwise would only have been a technical exercise in Chinese and Japanese martial arts. As it is, HEROES OF THE EAST is one of the finest films of its genre that I've ever seen. And the way it ends, not with bloodshed and gruesome deaths, but with mutual respect after an exhibition of prowess and skills, well, that's pretty much a philosophical linchpin of martial arts, isn't it? Makes me want to go in the garden and practice maneuvers like the ""Cripple Li Carrying Water"" and chop down innocent garden gnomes. Such an awesome movie.

The DVD from Dragon Dynasty offers up several nifty special features: feature commentary from Hong Kong Cinema Expert Bey Logan; ""Spotlight on a Legend"" - a tribute to celebrated martial arts icon and director Lao Kar-Leung, hosted by Bey Logan (00:36:08 minutes); ""Hero of a Shaolin"" - an interview with Gordon Liu as he talks about his career and, specifically, about this film (00:22:13); ""Shaolin vs. Ninja""  (00:26:10) - this is a really interesting segment with a Japanese Iaido master, a Hung Gar weapons master, and an Okinawan bo master breaking down techniques in their craft; and the original theatrical trailers for HEROES OF THE EAST and COME DRINK WITH ME.",1275696000,4,5338,4.944258639910814
3287906,3,B0010X741O,"I purchased this movie based upon the reviews here at Amazon and although I did enjoy the action scenes I felt more perplexed than (apparently) most other reviewers.

It was difficult for me to discern whether the female lead was actually that; a female. Only after the cleavage shot while sparring with her new husband did I allow myself to trust it was a woman, but only for the sake of creative license.
Although the fight scenes were entertaining it was difficult for me to believe that one ""student"" had mastered seven different disciplines to the degree where none of the Japanese ""masters"" were capable of defeating him. The Shaw Brothers are definitely from China which is evidenced in this somewhat one-sided film.  I'll hazard a guess but the same probably holds true here in the USA to our older cowboy and indian movies (pre 1979) where the indians did not fare well.  I've given this film a three star rating for the well choreographed action sequences, believing it must have been fun to direct.  If you are looking for examples of various fighting styles this movie may be for you, if you are looking for substance please continue your quest.

Admittedly, I am spoiled by films such as, The Shadowless Sword, The Warrior, Aragami, Legend of the Black Scorpion, The Restless, Seven Swords, Warriors of Heaven and Earth...(my list goes on and on).",1261872000,4,1360,4.794871794871795
3287917,5,B0010X741O,"I have already enjoyed ""HEROES OF THE EAST"" (aka ""SHAOLIN CHALLENGES NINJA"") for over 15 years, first having seen it on video tape, then on DVD and now on this excellent Dragon Dynasty edition DVD.

IMHO, this is one of their best yet, if not THE best, releases.  The movie is finally restored (thanks to Celestial Pictures), to its ShawScope glory, with both Mandarin and Cantonese soundtracks (as well as that good 'ol, clunky English dub, which I doubt I will ever listen to again!), and a bevy of cool special features.

There are so many reviews of both the film itself and the special features here (and elsewhere), I will only add that this movie is one of the great kung fu movies of all time. It is rare in that there are no deaths and not even any serious injuries (except perhaps to an ego here and there!).  It is a movie about sharing culture, about the challenges in any marriage, and especially in a marriage where there is a culture barrier.  It is a story about being patient and loving anyway (but that message is covert. This is not a romance, nor a ""chick-flick"" yet, I do believe that many women will enjoy it, even if they are not big martial art fans, and I also think it is good for kids).

The martial arts in this film, directed and choreographed by the great real and film martial arts master Lau Kar Leung (and he even makes a great cameo as the Drunken Master ""Beggar Su"", in addition to filling in for his adopted brother, student and lead actor Gordon Liu on some difficult moves, most especially with the weapon, Three Sectional Staff.  I always knew that the moves behind the back were NOT Gordon Liu, but I did not know, until the commentary by Bey Logan, that it was Lau Sifu) are some of the best ever.  It is mostly pretty realistic (and even the exceptions are still pretty cool to watch) kung fu choreography, with little wire work (almost none, if any), few special effects shots, and believable fights (again Bey Logan's commentary helped me, because the few fights that are not completely believable, I always had a little trouble with, and it is nice to hear confirmation about those.  E.g. A Chinese straight sword would not and could not stand up to full contact with a Samurai sword.  The Chinese sword would break. Period!). THe exceptions are few and as I say, still fun and work within the context of the story.

And the story is a good one.  A truly great martial arts movie or action movie of any kind, should have the action help tell the story.  And this one does.

The special features on this disc are generous and quality.  I loved Bey Logan's commentary and half hour tribute to Lau Sifu and the movie itself.  I really like Bey's commentaries.  I could almost see myself getting any and all DD releases just for those, even though I might not love the film.  But on this one, not only do I love the film, but it is one of his best commentaries.  His obvious love and respect for Lau Sifu and for the film itself, is both evident and enhances my enjoyment of the movie itself.

Gordon Liu's interview is also about a half hour (or at least 25 minutes) and also is very interesting. While he repeats some of what he has said in other interviews on other DD releases, there is plenty specific to this movie that makes it very special and interesting (e.g. how he and the Japanese actress who played his wife were able to ""bond"" a bit on a date before filming and also how they worked out a little code, so they could know when it was their cue, since neither spoke the other's language!).

And the feature about Japanese and Chinese weapons was also interesting and the woman who was the host for this was kinda cute!

This is my favorite DD release thus far by far.  It is tremendously entertaining with lots of repeatability for viewing pleasure and I also continue to learn a lot, both from the movie and from the special features.

""HEROES OF THE EAST"" was already one of my favorite kung fu movies of all time (and I admit, I am still missing having seen a few classics, such as ""THE PRODIGAL SON"", and have never seen all of Jet Li's ""FIST OF LEGEND""... not more than a few scenes in a video store in Times Square over 15 years ago!  I know, I know: I should be ashamed of myself.  It is next on my list!).  But I have seen a good deal of the Shaw Brothers 70's and early 80's classics and again, this has already ranked up with my favorites (most notably, ""THE 36th CHAMBER OF SHAOLIN"", aka ""THE MASTER KILLER"").

Now, with this DD release, I think ""HEROES OF THE EAST"" climbs up to tie with anything as number one.  For me, now, there may be those that are as good, but none better.

I would definitely rate this one as a must buy (especially at the price! But even for twice the price, I would still get it).",1261008000,,4772,4.365384615384615

I am a Gordon Lui fan, and definitely a martial arts fan, with the movie being a dragon dynasty production, trust me that alone makes you want to see it. So far every movie with their production have been over the top.",1246665600,,389,4.402777777777778

My mate had this on an old VHS copy under the title ""Shaolin vs Ninja"" but lost it. He highly recommended it me so I got it off Amazon. (Recieved it only after about 10 days here in Australia from Amazon. Great service!).

The fighting in it is top notch as it fairly displays Chinese Gung Fu vs Japanese Martial arts with out too much bias. ( as opposed to say Bruce Lee's Fist of Fury, where the Japs are the baddies. still a top movie though!)

It has been restored beautifully and the dubbing (if you don't like subtitles) is the cool old school voices we've all grown up with. (as opposed to alot of the remastered Jackie Chan movies now have remastered dubbing too, which sounds silly.)

The movie was directed by a kung fu expert, the star was a kung fu expert, and the cinematographer was a kung fu expert as well.  This combination of kung fu experts in different roles makes for a unique action movie from the perspective of martial artists.  The action and moves are more authentic and many fight scenes are shot in a single take in real-time speed.  Many kung fu movies speed up the action to make the actors look like they're moving fast.  This movie lets you see real martial artists showing off their best skills when they were at the peak of their prowess.  It also has a good story and not just fighting for the sake of fighting.

What's interesting is how this all done but you'll need to see it for yourself.  He takes on many different master of Japanese martial arts and weapons.  All of this is brought about due to his marriage with a best friend that was pre-arranged and she's Japanese.  So they have fights about who's style is better and hold's more merit.

I would say more but it kind of gives away a good part of the movie itself.  I will say that for its price and considering all the legends in this movie.  Heroes of the East is another excellent one done by the Shaw Brothers and should watched by any fans of the martial arts.",1224288000,,725,4.286764705882353

3287925,5,B0010X741O,"It's a beautiful thing to see a Shaw Brothers film get the five star treatment, but it's even better when the movie itself is a five star film, like this classic from Liu Chia-liang (Lau Kar-leung).  His movies rarely disappoint, in fact, some of his failures are superior than other's successes.  My personal fave from him is ""36th Chamber of Shaolin"", but this is just a tiny notch below that one.  It's a totally unique take on the familiar topic of Chinese vs. Japanese.  Instead of it being down the line & doing a ""virtuous"" Chinese avenging themselves against ""wicked"" Japanese, Lau crafts a very subtle & realistic story.  The cause for the combat is over miscommunication & misunderstanding, not because somebody is a nefarious villain.  Get this, nobody gets injured in this film, much less killed; all the martial bouts are tests of skill, not duels to the death.  I like that aspect, and this is coming from a huge Chang Cheh fan.

Lau's half-brother, Gordon, does a great job (as usual) portraying the lead Ho Tao, as does Yuka Mizuno as his somewhat immature Japanese wife.  The culture clash seems absolutely authentic.  Lau made a very smart move employing real Japanese fighters to play Gordon's combatants, and the bouts are appropriately matched up; gim vs. katana, karate vs. kung fu, spear vs. yari, 3-sectioned staff vs. tonfa/nunchaku, butterfly knives vs. sai, culminating with the Japanese crab technique vs. Chinese crane style.  Gordon takes on everybody, Yasuaki Kurata gives an incredible performance as the ninjitsu expert leading his team.  Many familiar Shaw actors can be seen like Norman Chu, Wilson Tong, Ching Miao & Cheng Kang-yeh.  Director Lau also shapes up the awesome fu and even plays the Drunken God expert Gordon tries to learn from.  That character looks like a younger version of the drunk sifu Simon Yuen (who plays Gordon's sifu here) portrayed in ""Drunken Master"".  Not only did Dragon Dynasty remaster the picture with it's widescreen Shawscope ratio (Arthur Wong's cinematography is stunning), but you can watch the movie either in Chinese with remastered subtitles (which emphasizes the language barrier better) or in a decent English dub.  Don't miss the tribute to the man himself, Lau kar-leung or the awesome interview with Gordon Liu in the special features.",1215907200,,2316,5.023560209424084
3287926,5,B0010X741O,"Tell the truth; how long has it been since you kicked back and watched a martial arts film and said-""woooooow"",It's probably been a while. Well, heroes of the east has put that ooh-ah back into the martial arts films. For about 20 years,kung fu film buyers have been cheated by watching martial arts films that are either bootleged or improperly framed. Now celestial, which owns the rights of all the shaw brothers titles, have restored and remastered some of the most finest cinema I have ever seen. The fight scenes in this film is so carefully directed,and the best fighting scene i found to be good was the scene when gordon lui character had to go against a ninja doing a style called ""the crab stance"", the fight is nothing but amazing. We should get serious about kung fu films, computer genertated effects are not the real deal. In which gordon lui expressed in an interview.

8238966,5,B0010X741O,"There are perhaps 2 school of thought when it comes to Heroes of the East: either you absolutely love it or the film comes off as ""Chinese martial arts is good & honorable while the Japanese brand of martial arts is rather dishonorable, sneaky & quite evil."" This is directed by the legendary Liu Chia Liang of 36th Chamber of Shaolin (Master Killer) fame as well as classics such as 8 Diagram Pole Fighter, Mad Monkey Kung Fu, Dirty Ho & Legendary Weapons of China. The premise here is a young martial artist (Gordon Liu) is part of an arraigned marriage engineered by his father who has business dealings with the Japanese. The bride (Yuko Mizuno) is unlike what the Chinese accept as a suitable wife. She's a bit of a martial artist in her own right but in different forms of Japanese martial arts including ninjutsu. This obviously creates strife in the household as his husband tries to convince her to take up the Chinese female style of martial arts. After a few knockdown drag out fights, she heads back to Japan when she feels his husband has totally disrespected her art form. But when a letter sent by the husband is in turn intercepted by his Japanese martial arts instructor & close friend (Yasuaki Kurata), he takes it as an affront against all forms of Japanese martial arts. He & a small army of men head to China to let the husband know that they accept what they deem as a challenge so one by one they fight the husband which leads to an awesome display of weapons as well as hand-to-hand fights.

Gordon Liu in one of his 1st starring role turns in an awesome performance as the husband who must protect the honor of Chinese martial arts. Yuko Mizuno sells her part as the warring wife & performs well herself. The Japanese delegation represents a who's who in the martial art form for that country led by Yasuaki Kurata who rarely ever disappoints, particularly with his ninjutsu & the famous Japanese crab style. Also in this in bit parts is Norman Chu, Wilson Tong, Yuen Hsiao Tien (famously known for his Sam Seed character) as one of Gordon Liu's teachers & the director himself as a drunk who happens to be a master of...you guess it, the drunken style of kung fu.

Myself as a neutral party absolutely loved this film. It got its point across with an ounce of blood spilled. But again, someone of Japanese descent could very well find this to be condescending & rightfully so. You be the judge...",1496102400,2,2422,4.540045766590389

Watching all the actors perform was impressive.
