3683764,2,B001LJMAKC,"**MAJOR SPOILERS**

First off, the only reason I'm giving this movie 2 stars instead of one, is because of the subject that seems to rarely be discussed in or outside of church. I give credit to the creators and director of taking on this topic and making a movie where both sides can be seen objectively...YES objectively. While as a christian, it is almost obvious that I sympathize more with Bobby being that he loves Christ and desires to grow in him and in the ministry. However while starting the movie with high expectations and ending it with disappointment, I feel as if Lisa's issues and concerns are brushed off with a simple ""He's workin for the lord, oblige him, honey.""

In my humble opinion, this movie missed three major sub issues that naturally should be addressed with something of this nature:
1. Lisa should have been prompted by advisors to develop a closer relationship with Christ. If she continued to view Christ as ""competition"" within various relationships (family/romantic), perhaps the focus should have been making Him the central focus of HER life and letting the everything else fall after Him.

2. Just because Bobby recieved salvation doesn't instantly make him the *perfect* companion. God's word says 'Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers' 2 Corinthians 6:14, but just because individuals might be saved, doesn't give rights for any saved female and male to marry and mulitiply. There is no 'stereotypical' christian. We all have different personalities and preferences. Finding the right wife/husband is something God discerns, not us. I feel this option should have been addressed. Perhaps Lisa didn't belong with Bobby in the end at all.

3. Lastly...even though I cannot relate from personal experience, word is being a *Pastor's Kid* is NO JOKE. The movie breezed through this so lightly, it made me feel neglected on behalf of Lisa. Now I whole heartedly don't believe in such a thing as being ""too saved,"" but there IS truth in the matter of being neglected and isolated at home, while men who are pastors, are holding revivals and not able to manage household duties as a father. Even the word of God says, ""For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?"" 1 Timothy 3:5 (a scripture that should have definitely came in sometime during this movie).

Besides the novice filming techniques and less than impressive dialogue, I'd encourage viewing another christian movie before seeing this one.",1247788800,7,2497,4.907582938388626

know how to except it.",1245715200,,105,3.608695652173913
3683766,1,B001LJMAKC,"The acting was ok, so I'll start with that. The movie seemed like a good idea that never made it passed just that: a good idea. But hey, even though I think it was terrible, some ""churchy"" people like the main character will watch it, and the message will minister to them. I doubt this movie was meant for anyone outside the church anyway.

The ENTIRE movie was dialogue. Long, boring, completely uninspired dialogue. There are some quick short books on screenwriting that could have helped here tremendously. There are a ton of concepts that need to be communicated for anyone outside church culture to understand the story, but there was no creative attempt in conveying anything. With all the talking you had to listen to it didn't help that the sound wasn't that great, either too loud, soft, or heavy echoing at times.

Attempts in creative photography were utter flops, and the boom mic made a cameo appearance within the first 10 minutes. The ""fancy"" restaurant staging took away more production value than it was worth aiming for.  This film simply didn't have to look as low budget as it did. Black & white flashback scenes were cliche, and some shots just left me hoping they'll do MUCH better next time.

I rented this movie from the Redbox thinking if a faith-based movie made it into the Redbox it must be pretty good. I know better now. Not only am I a devoted Christ-follower and filmmaker, I also live in the area this film was shot in, so when I say it was hard to stomach it's for good reason. Hopefully I can get in touch with them and we can collab on something better.",1238371200,6,1590,4.548951048951049
3683767,5,B001LJMAKC,Too Saved was a wonderful adaptation of everyday problems that Christians face. I would recommend this for churches as a teaching tool for single ministries.,1236643200,3,157,5.32
3683768,5,B001LJMAKC,"Really a great movie. By the way this is a Christian movie, I wasn't sure if it really was based on the title. It was really funny, and the movie got better as it went along. Great film, would recomend",1235779200,,201,4.05
3683769,5,B001LJMAKC,"Too saved is a great movie. Lisa (Lolita Clayton) wants her boyfriend Bobby (James  J.J. Johnson) to be saved, or at least she thinks she does. When Bobby accepts the Lord and starts living a righteous life, she has the opportunity to look at her own salvation from a new perspective.

I first saw this movie in it's original release a few years ago, but it's one I own and go back to watch often.

The actors are not well known, but each of them is talented.

This would be a great choice for movie night at your local church.",1231804800,6,527,4.24
3683780,5,B001LJMAKC,Great movie with a great message!!,1409702400,,34,4.833333333333333

3683782,2,B001LJMAKC,"Got to about half an hour. Found the movie mostly boring. The reason is that the characters displayed are not for real. Like a girl in a christian setting like that doesn't know she is not to have sex before marriage. That one is in the Bible. Or like the guy can't drink one single alcoholic beverage when there is a celebration. That one is not in the Bible. Such confusement about what is right and wrong. She is not displaying enough knowledge. He is becoming legalistic.
Before you start thinking I'm not a Christian, I am for thirty years now and very thankful for God's loving grace. And I try to allow God to hallow me and live a life that is honouring Him. This film, though probably well intentioned, can cause more harm than good, confusing teens that becoming a christian means keeping a lot of man made rules too.",1390521600,,826,4.440789473684211

3683784,5,B001LJMAKC,should have been red flags to him that his girlfriend wasn't as saved as she and him thought she was. She wanted nothing to with christ outside the church. It let us examie ourselves and see if we are the same way. Good movie to tell if you really saved or not.,1366156800,,261,4.038461538461538
3683785,5,B001LJMAKC,The teachings in this movie are spot on!  May God bless the writers and actors.  This is a great lesson for young ladies all over.,1363564800,,130,4.16
3683786,5,B001LJMAKC,So many of us say that we are Christians but how many of us practice what we preach. This story is truly a story of salvation and a strive to be God like.,1352073600,,154,3.696969696969697
3683787,2,B001LJMAKC,"I put this in the dvd player for us to watch as a family.  Big mistake.  Not for children.  I came to a scene where they were sitting on a couch and they girl wanted to have sex.  He didn't.  She got mad.  I turned it off.  Later, by myself, I put the dvd back in to see where that scene was going.  It looked clean enough from there,  but I still chose to throw it away because of that one scene.  I am a prude and don't like my kids to watch anything with an element of ""casual sex"" to it.  I definitely think it gave the right message, but not good for younger kids if you are like me and try to only show your young children that sexual things are only between a husband and wife.  This movie pulls it together with the message, but I didn't want that one scene sticking in my young children's minds.",1312675200,4,804,3.95625
3683788,5,B001LJMAKC,This movie teaches you to be prepared for results before you ask God for anything. You need to know that you are ready for the desired thing.,1276646400,,141,4.2592592592592595
3683789,3,B001LJMAKC,"Lisa has prayed for years that God would save her boyfriend Bobby, but when he finally sees the light it's much more than Lisa bargained for. Is Bobby `Too Saved' to hold onto his relationship with Lisa?

This is a great spirtual film for Christian movie lovers. I thought it was really cute and addressed important issues within the Christian faith. I give this film major props for discussing certain issues that might not have been discussed in a movie. Overall, I think this is a good Christian indie film, so check it out.

8318257,5,B001LJMAKC,"I love this movie.  It was a very spiritual movie with real meaning of being saved.  Bobby was a true example of how a saint should live.  When God changed him he was for real.  He walked what he preached.  Now, is girlfriend, really wasn't where she supposed to been in Christ, and she was given Bobby a hard time.  But he really loved her, but he did not give in to her weakness.  She finally came around and began to see herself.  She had good advice from seasoned saints, and they really helped her see the light.  She eventually got herself together and married him.  I loved this movie and I would recommend it to ALL SAVED MEN AND WOMEN this movie will be a great inspiration in chosing your mate, and how SAVED COUPLES SHOULD CARRIED THEMSELVES IN THEIR COURTSHIP.",1433116800,,772,4.373239436619718
