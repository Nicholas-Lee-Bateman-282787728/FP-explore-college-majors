7879206,5,6304929927,"Here's your chance St. Louis and everywhere else to see the father of Rock n Roll Chuck Berry playing some classic hits with his most famous admirer John Lennon. Both seem excited to be in each other company and to have the chance to play music with each other. There are also some famous Lennon performances with the Elephant's Memory band and Yoko Ono. John and Yoko do a few songs just with each other and they sound great together. No screaming from Yoko , just good singing. This is a must collectible for John Lennon fans.",1395446400,,528,4.453608247422681
7879207,5,6304929927,"Mike Douglas was not the epitome of ""hip"". So it is kind of surprising he would want John and Yoko -- from their wildest early ""movement"" days -- to be on his show as co-hosts for an entire week. But this is what we have here. It is odd television, to say the least, from the moment Mike walks out on Day 1 and sings ""Michelle"" -- probably thinking he's paying homage to John Lennon, not knowing it was Paul McCartney's song. John saves the day, though, telling Mike that he wrote the middle eight, ""so it's all right"".

There are a lot of weird and fun moments here:
- John's childlike excitement that he gets to play with Chuck Berry
- the expression on Chuck Berry's face when Yoko, playing a drum in the backup band, starts ululating into the microphone during ""Memphis""
- Ralph Nader saying he's not interested in ever running for president (ha!)
- Jerry Rubin, leader of violent 1960s protests, saying he plans to support Nixon because the trip to China has done so much for the cause of communism in the U.S. (he was kidding)
- John and Yoko's first public performance with Elephant's Memory, the band with whom they would soon record the ""Sometime in New York City"" album
- Very interesting little daily interviews with John and Yoko about various aspects of their lives and careers
- A good comedy routine by a very young George Carlin
- Good musical acts including not only John and Yoko and Chuck Berry, but a number of other bands and performers that have since disappeared from sight
- ""Love calls"" -- they call people on the phone at random in various US cities to tell them they love them (this is mainly Yoko's thing)

This set of shows should be a must see for any Beatles or Lennon fan, although the material and the mindset can seem very, very dated today. According to the liner notes, it was shortly after the appearances on this show that John was classified as a left-wing threat to the US and served with deportation papers which he spent many more years fighting. So this is pre-witch hunt John Lennon, still flush with the optimism of America and starting out on a new life with Yoko in New York.

The price is unfortunate and clearly an exaggeration. These shows aren't worth $200, which is what they are asking for this two-DVD set right now on Amazon Marketplace. I found a Brazilian copy, for example (looks genuine enough...) through another major internet sales outlet for a reasonable price. If you look around, you can probably find options out there.",1297555200,,2485,4.542410714285714
7879208,1,6304929927,"To the best of my knowledge, this set of John & Yoko's appearance on The Mike Douglas Show was only ever officially released by Rhino on VHS. ""Factory sealed"" is a great way to ensure credible deniability. This is likely a DVD-R. A great week of shows, and well worth watching, but not worth nearly $1,300.00.",1263513600,9,309,4.535714285714286
7879209,5,6304929927,"This box set was excellent. It was in the condition in which the seller said it was. This series was recorded back in 1972 in phila. I had tickets to 2 of the 5 shows. And the show took photos during the whole week of all the guests that were on the shows. And in one of those photos im the guy who is shaking yokos hand. Totally Awsome.. 36 yrs.later but it seemed like yesterday. I never forgot how it felt seeing my rock idol god john lennon up close and personal shaking his hand and getting his autograph watching him perform his music with the likes of chuck berry, yea like i said it was Totally Awsome",1232150400,3,609,4.126050420168068
7879210,5,6304929927,"I think the first review about says it all, but I disagree slightly with some comments. I think that, considering the time period and the medium, Mike Douglas is a fantastic host. He's easy to watch, so he won't turn you off. Also, I found all of the shows to be completely interesting. Perhaps I'm just silly, but I found all of the guests to be facinating and had fun trying to think on which ideals being discussed then are now realities-- like recycling.
  I found viewing all of the tapes to be inspirational as, if it takes thirty years to make such-and-such happen, then in thirty years from now, we could expect such-and-so. For example, thirty years ago, we were just learning about the ill--effects of smoking. Discrimination meant demonstrations-- which have now become legal issues that have worked themselves through the courts. Granted there is a good deal more to do to make the world work better, but the tapes gave me a good perspective on how persistence can mean good changes.
  In any case, there is both a good history lesson as well as some good brain food in these tapes-- and some great music, art, and humor to keep it entertaining. I don't think that you need to be big John and Yoko fans to enjoy these. I think there is enough good content and variety to appeal to anyone simply interested in that period of time or issues regarding how mass media can be used to get out important information to people-- even if controversial.",1029196800,3,1455,4.584615384615384
7879211,5,6304929927,"My five-star rating requires some qualification.  If you love John and Yoko, identify with their truly human blend of idealism and realism, and  feel that the world has digressed politically since 1972, then you will  agree with all five stars.  For the more casual fan, there may be too many  breaks from the ""juicier"" segments with John and Yoko.  A good deal of time  is spent with the other guests, and Mike Douglas isn't exactly the ultimate  host (although he isn't bad).  But for the kindred spirit, the array of  radical guests chosen by John and Yoko (such as Black Panther leader Bobby  Seale, political activist Jerry Rubin, consumer activist Ralph Nader,  radical comedian George Carlin, and many other socially relevant people)  may be seen as an extension of their personalities and of the era, thus  providing valuable context to these two unique and precious people.  It's  the human message in a variety of forms, and these perspectives are, at  least to me, every bit as relevant now as they were then.  And John and  Yoko do interact with them all.  All in all, a real slice of life from the  era.
Not that there aren't several John-and-Yoko gems, too.  There are  two or three live performances or rare video clips per episode, good  questions from Mike Douglas (and, in episode 5, the audience), good banter,  and some offbeat surprises (such as a Japanese folk song and cup  reconstruction from Yoko).
So all in all, the amount of patience required  (as well as how much you will use the fast-forward button on your remote)  will be directly proportionate to how much of a die-hard fan you are of  these two people and the times to which these videos return us.",966556800,27,1683,4.706896551724138
