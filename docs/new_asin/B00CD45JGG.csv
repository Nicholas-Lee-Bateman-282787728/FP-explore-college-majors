5715649,5,B00CD45JGG,The women are lovely and the cliffhanger endings are legendary!  It doesn't get any better than Dynasty for exciting endings!  It is like going in a time machine back to the 1930's and 1940's and seeing the original cliffhanger serials!,1379030400,,236,4.875

5715651,5,B00CD45JGG,"In Volume 2 of ""Dynasty-Season 7"" the last 12 episodes are featured from the 1986-1987 TV season when the serial originally aired on ABC.

 The end of that particular year was somewhat of a crossroads for the series as the show dropped dramatically in popularity (""Dynasty"" ended the season at a paltry #24 in the U.S. Nielsens) thus resulting in a big cut in its budget. By 1987 the network no longer took out big ads in magazines or spent money on promoting the show in other ways, and even Oscar nominee Diahann Carroll was dropped because the producers couldn't afford her any more. ""Dynasty"" was declining.

 Despite what many have said season 7 was a good year in terms of story. Adam and his new bride Dana wanted a child desperately as Dana was barren so the couple hired a surrogate to carry their child; Steven was dealing with the loss of Claudia in the fire, Alexis was determined to ruin Blake forever and in the final episode of the season the Carrington's are held captive by a character long thought dead and Alexis life hangs in the air as her car goes off a bridge.",1367971200,3,1083,4.482233502538071
