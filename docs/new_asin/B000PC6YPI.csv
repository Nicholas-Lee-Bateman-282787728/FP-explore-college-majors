8190293,1,B000PC6YPI,"IMHO, the acting and filming seemed to be on par with a high school drama class. As a fan of Chinese History, I was really looking forward to this series.  I couldn't watch more than ten minutes of the first disc. Sorry!",1395446400,2,220,4.238095238095238

8190295,1,B000PC6YPI,"This series is has a couple of low points.  First, the battles.  They seem to have been set up and filmed as if the actors were on a theatre stage.  THat means no blood, no sweat, and very little effort.  Next, the sets leaves a great deal to be desired.  The sets seem to have been designed to be as uncostly as possible.  The bargain basement attitude runs all thorough the drama.

Dont waste your time with this drama.",1290384000,,421,4.253164556962025
8190296,1,B000PC6YPI,"Beware if you do not speak Mandarin...Although this serial was released by Image Entertainment, in the set that I received, the English subtitles are present only up to the third disc . The last three discs do not have any subtitles whatsoever... The pacing is also very slow; and the plot is drawn out and confusing.",1263600000,6,317,4.678571428571429
8190297,3,B000PC6YPI,"Guan Gong, the ""god of war,"" had more temples across China in 1900 than any other divinity, and he remains an object of popular veneration today. (His home town of Yuncheng is once again becoming a major pilgrimage center.) The novel ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" (available in the English translation of Moss Roberts), one of the best loved of China's great pre-modern novels, did much to popularize him, as did story tellers and theatrical companies for centuries. This video series is a modern contribution to that tradition. Celebrated as a brilliant warrior but more importantly as the personification of rectitude, Guan Gong remained loyal to his two sometimes frustrating sworn brothers against all odds, and despite the efforts of the brilliant but vicious lord Cao Cao to recruit him to what was in the end the winning side. It's been a long time since I read the novel, but this video series strikes me as remarkably true to it, and certainly to the tradition. The battles celebrated by Chinese story tellers are here. And so are the characters, big and small, that figure in Guan Gong's life. Don't look for silly kung-fu special effects here, but for a solid effort to represent the mortal life of the famous god of war with fair psychological depth. One cautionary note: There is unfortunately no dramatis personae list; however, with dozens of significant characters, you may need to pause and make some lists as you go along in order to keep track of exactly what's going on. I had fun with it, but it'll be a while before I go through all 22 hours a second time.",1232236800,8,1580,4.749090909090909
8190298,4,B000PC6YPI,"If you are a fan of Chinese culture and literature (think Outlaws Of The Marsh, etc...) you will like this.

This is not a Kung Fu epic. The fight scenes are more like what you would see in a Saturady Night Live skit than a Bruce Lee movie.

This gives a good glimpse into late Han dynasty China.",1191456000,3,296,4.086206896551724
8190299,1,B000PC6YPI,"I have really enjoyed watching several Chinese and Korean epics as many-episode extended stories.  This one has three middle-aged chubby guys decide to call each other ""First Brother"", etc., which makes it even harder to watch.  The writing is terrible and the actors seem to just go from one scene to the next without establishing any reasons.  They seem unhappy with everyone with any authority without doing any better themselves.
I stopped watching it after five episodes which I have never done before.  Find Jumong or Emperor of the Sea to see what this could have been.",1185235200,7,576,4.907216494845361
