5451078,3,B00AMHFMNQ,"I got this for my husband as he loves the 80s, but he wasn't as pleased with it as he could have been. I'd recommend it only for the most die-hard wrestling fan.",1387238400,,161,3.909090909090909
5451079,4,B00AMHFMNQ,Good old time wrestling. Saw wrestlers in their early days plus wrestlers who never made it to the WWE. Would buy other DVDs in the series.,1385856000,,139,4.384615384615385
5451080,2,B00AMHFMNQ,"Not like the WWE , No background , just two old wrestlers talking about the matches. I watch wrestling when I was younger. This not what thought it would be like. Not happy with this at all .",1385683200,2,191,4.052631578947368
5451081,4,B00AMHFMNQ,"Nice disk, some great matches from Texas in the 80's.  Looks like most, if not all, of the matches were from 1 month but was cool to see them.  Would like to have had better, announcing between matches as Ox Baker and the other guy come off as at least unprofessional.",1383004800,,268,4.235294117647059
5451082,5,B00AMHFMNQ,"A very good DVD, price is great and offers a lot for the money. Ox Baker and Rock Parsons did a great job hosting. Ox made one mistake about Big Bubba dying at a young age, but really meant his partner Earthquake, other than that they were very informative, and Parsons related stories from being a wrestler, promoter and commentator while Bake talked from in ring experience and some inside information. This is the first one of this series and with Scott Casey, Tommy Rich, Bruiser Brody, Jim Duggan, and a ton of others this was a very enjoyable DVD",1369440000,2,552,4.53
5451083,5,B00AMHFMNQ,"This is a great DVD well worth the low low price and then some.  Great selection of matches from Southwest Championship Wrestling and Texas All Star Wrestling from 1981 through 1985.  Matches are from the TV shows and the Hemisfair Arena as well.

DVD is hosted by Rock Parsons & Ox Baker who provide intros and outros to all of the matches.  Parsons is apparently an ex-wrestler as well but I don't remember him.  He provides some very good insight into each match.  Baker provides some interesting color but some of his facts are mistaken such as thinking Terminator aka Tugboat aka Fred Ottman was dead and Parsons never corrected him.

5451084,2,B00AMHFMNQ,"this video was horrible i  don't know which was worse ,the choices of matches put on this disc or the 2 bland ,confusing hosts,ox baker was terrible in reviewing the matches and his attempt at humor was accomplishing as the results of these boreing matches,south western chaMpionship wrestling had alot of good story lines and none were displayed in this video ,you would be more entertained by purchasing ox bakers cook book SMH",1367884800,2,429,4.876712328767123

5451107,2,B00AMHFMNQ,This was ok but I think they could have picked some better matches for this video.,1454630400,,82,4.1875
5451108,4,B00AMHFMNQ,"This is a pretty cool gem.  I love the two announcers being kind of awkward and camerashy, they're awesome.  Im only on the second match and Ive learned a LOT of stuff I didn't know and I consider myself a HUGE mark.  This is a great movie if your a wwe fan and want to branch out and see what old school wrestling was all about.

It's so fun watching these matches now, they are SO different than the wrestling today.  The",1451606400,,423,4.109756097560975

5451117,5,B00AMHFMNQ,My husband is a historian when it comes to wrestling and he LOVED this DVD. It has matches that he has never seen before and that's a huge find. Well worth the money!,1419638400,,166,4.0606060606060606
5451118,3,B00AMHFMNQ,Most matches are pre lim bum snore fests.  It is nice to see some of the future stars of wrestling when they first got started but most matches remind me of the early 70's Saturday afternoon wwwf matches pitting a bum getting squashed by a main eventer.  It is o.k. for the memories but not the matches.,1418083200,,303,4.298245614035087

5451123,4,B00AMHFMNQ,This DVD definitely is a must have for true wrestling fans. For those fortunate enough to see the late Bruiser Brody in action will really enjoy seeing him in action as well as the music video featuring him. It is a shame wrestling like this is no longer televised today.,1397433600,,271,4.44
5451124,4,B00AMHFMNQ,Matches are ok but to have history on DVD is awesome in my opinion. Ox Baker tells some stories what a character.,1395792000,,113,4.181818181818182
8553708,3,B00AMHFMNQ,"Good selection of matches. Horrible introductions/hosting by Ox Baker and the other guy.  Especially, when they repeatedly said that The Terminator/Big Bubba/Tugboat/Typhoon/Shockmaster(real name Fred Ottman) tragically died young.  Mr. Ottman is still alive today as I write this review.  Presumably, they were confused by the fact that Ottman was once known as Big Bubba and the wrestler formerly known as Big Bubba Rogers(and best known as the Big Boss Man) did die at a young age.  However, most wrestling fans(of that era) know the difference and even if these guys didn't, a few minutes of research would have prevented an unfortunate and unprofessional mistake.

4 stars for the matches. 2 stars for the presentation.",1525219200,,724,5.315789473684211

8553715,5,B00AMHFMNQ,Great promotion and a ton of action. If you are a Brody fan this is a great feature on him. Also gives you an idea of why SW wrestling was so popular on USA network.
