8086740,3,B000BH2U64,Pleasing foreign film; covers a taboo subject (at least in the US ) In other countries this is no big deal.  The ending could have been better if our hero was provided with a few samples from different women.  If there were some close-ups of the ladies offering (including different sizes and shapes) would really have better developed the film and put it over the top.  It would have also compounded the main character's interests in breasts and lactation.  If you are going to produce a film of this nature then let the viewer explore all aspects.  Would be nice to see more films of this nature.  Price seemed fair; would have been really fun to watch with English speaking actors.,1438300800,,684,4.6115702479338845

8086742,2,B000BH2U64,"I found this story so ridiculous, poor script and concept. Who writes this junk. If you are looking for this story to be a little erotic, pass on.",1377820800,,146,4.25
8086743,5,B000BH2U64,"I very much enjoyed the movie, about a boy looking for his own tit to have for his to comfort when he needs it. and don't have to share with any one else.",1344297600,,154,3.696969696969697
8086744,1,B000BH2U64,"Apparently I didn't read the fine print when I ordered the movie.  It does not appear to work in my equipment.  I am not sure what I will do, perhaps look for a dvd that works here.",1341619200,,181,3.864864864864865

'La Teta y la Luna' is a light-hearted and sensual story of a little nine year old boy named Tete (Biel Duran) who wants to be treated the same as his newborn baby brother. Unable to get his Mother's attention and affection away from her new bundle of joy, Tete decides to go in search of a surrogate Mother.

Tete asks the moon to provide him with a loving female. When a beautiful French dancer (Mathilda May) and her husband arrive in town Tete is certain she's the one he's been looking for. However convincing her won't be easy, not only does he have to deal with her husband, but another local teenager is also in hot pursuit of the enticing Estrellita.

This is definitely not for the prudish, or easily offended. There is quite a bit of frontal nudity in this film. However if you're open-minded and have a good understanding of European humor you will appreciate this erotic little comedy as much as I did. By the way, Mathilda May is absolutely ravishing, I don't know if I've ever seen a more beautiful woman in any film!",1197763200,8,1134,4.5763546798029555
