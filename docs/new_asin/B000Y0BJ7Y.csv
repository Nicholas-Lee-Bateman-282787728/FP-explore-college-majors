8323608,5,B000Y0BJ7Y,I love this DVD. It's a great workout mixing both yoga and pilates using the balance ball. It has a great flow to it. I also enjoy the music. Happy feeling! I especially apreciate the introduction course giving lots of advice on how to advance or work as a beginner with the ball.,1269734400,,280,4.30188679245283
