8317696,5,B001L9EXQQ,"~ This video contains two concerts recorded in Denmark; the first in 1965, the second in 1968. For the 1965 concert Sonny is accompanied by 19-year old bassist Niels-Henning Orsted Pederson, who was already regarded as a jazz veteran and Europe's most in-demand bassist, and by drummer Alan Dawson, who splendidly demonstrates why he has been so respected and even revered by fellow drummers around the world. For the 1968 concert he is again supported by Orsted Pedersen alongside Kenny Drew on piano and Albert (Tootie) Heath on drums.
~ In both concerts Sonny is at a creative peak, improvising with an astonishing flow of ideas. The 1965 performance is loose but invigorating while the 1968 concert feels a bit more settled and less surprising.
~ The 1965 concert offers excellent versions of ""There Will Never Be Another You"", ""Darn That Dream"", ""Oleo / Sonnymoon for Two"", ""Three Little Words"", and his signature tune ""St. Thomas"".
~ The 1968 concert reprises ""St. Thomas"" and adds outstanding versions of ""Four"" and ""On Green Dolphin Street"", in which Rollins starts with an a capella intro and closes with a 90 second. Heath is having a good time during this set, humming along ""St. Thomas"" as he snaps, crackles and pops through the tune.
~ Highly recommended for students of improvisation and Sonny's vast legion of admirers. This is classic Sonny Rollins from what people consider his classic period.",1356480000,2,1411,4.983050847457627
