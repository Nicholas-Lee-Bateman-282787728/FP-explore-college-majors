8758075,5,B01E8ZB2RC,"This is not your typical documentary on Rome, but one of the most entertaining, erudite windows into Roman history.  Mrs Beard takes you to many different countries to explore the remains of the Empire, which makes this so interesting and for me it was a travel adventure. The cinematography is excellent, and the insight is unique and brilliant.  You feel like you are traveling with a Roman scholar around the Med exploring Roman historical sites. If there were only one series on Rome out there, this would be the one.",1525651200,,521,4.777777777777778
