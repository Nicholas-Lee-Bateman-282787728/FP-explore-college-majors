6308188,4,B00J0BTF7Y,"I would have given this a five star if Love Me Tender hadn't been one of the movies as it is already on two other ""packaged"" sets of Elvis's movies, otherwise the movies are very entertaining and show a wide variety in his acting skills.  These movies are not to showcase Elvis's singing as much as acting but there is still a little bit thrown in.  You will appreciate the limitations put on him by the scripts yet Elvis still manages to keep one's attention no matter the plot!",1433289600,,479,4.370786516853933

8647017,4,B00J0BTF7Y,"Good standard Elvis movies.  Elvis made some very enjjoyable movies to watch.
He had a great sense of humor about him, and not bad acting as well.
When he is on the set he stands out from all the other men on the show.

Extremely charismatic man.  He was a lucky guy, who was given life qualities and used his good looks, and extreme vocal talent to bring joy and happiness to millions during his lifetime, rather than taking advantage of these qualities for selfish purposes.",1453939200,,476,4.511627906976744

8647019,5,B00J0BTF7Y,So far I have watched three of the movies except Flaming star. I purchased the DVD simply because I always admired Elvis I play the guitar and after watching Love Me Tender I can play Love me Tender on my guitar with my good voice(not trying to be Elvis) My wife and I enjoyed the acting his style and singing,1446076800,,309,4.166666666666667
