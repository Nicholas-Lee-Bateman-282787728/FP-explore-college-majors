2922249,5,B000UJCAKE,Received DVD  in timely manner. While I realized it was a used copy the DVD skipped in the middle. I e-mailed the vendor and promptly was advised that this was his last copy and I will be receiving a FULL REFUND. I received it on my next CC bill. I WOULD BUY from this vendor again if the need arrives.,1252281600,,302,4.033333333333333
2922250,1,B000UJCAKE,"This movie is so stupid, I almust shouldn't dignify it by reviewing it.  I loved seeing Donald Faizon's downstairs and seeing sexy Joey Fatone, period.  However, this has a dumb plot with lame jokes and stereotypes galore.  Donald Faizon, plays Renato, a baby found by an Italian couple who then move to New York.  They tell him, ""Well, many Italians have dark skin.""  Hello!  Race is not just about skin color!  How many Italians are as dark as we African Americans?  If the parents can explain Renato's dark skin, how do they explain his hair texture and full lips?  Surely, people all his life would have told him he's Black.  Surely, any person of relative intelligence would say, ""I look like Blacks and not like Italians.  Maybe that means something?""  Plus, do you really want to watch a whole movie where the guy from ""Scrubs"" fakes an Italian-American accent and mannerisms?!  I pray that both African-American and Italian-American actors can find better roles than this trash.  It boggles the mind that quality scripts can't find directors and producers but mental junk like this gets made.  Remember what Chris Rock said about ""Boat Trip"" during his Oscar standup?  The same thing applies here!",1200960000,5,1205,4.891089108910891
2922251,5,B000UJCAKE,"We bought this movie, because we knew we liked it. It starts off a barrel of laughs, some racial tensions without the seriousness of the real world. Then ends up trying to have some sort of message about love, and finding oneself. Give it a chance, definitely entertaining.",1419897600,,273,4.708333333333333
2922252,5,B000UJCAKE,The title got me at first. Very cleaver. The star is cute and very likable as we know from TV. He is perfectly cast-assuming we believe he could be Italian. And we do!!!Good supporting cast except Whoopi. She's an ok actress but not here. I like her in crazy roles. A very funny idea and a very funny movie.,1418256000,,307,4.220338983050848

2922254,1,B000UJCAKE,"WOW! I guess the political incorrectness that everyone was talking about is here, not because the filmmakers are trying to be ""edgy"", but because these talentless hacks (the script writers and director) didn't know any better and wouldn't know quality writing if it was given to them with a post it note reading ""quality writing"" attached.. This cheap and lame movie is so horrible, that I'm embarrassed for everyone involved.. except Joey Fatone, I expect Z grade garbage from that old boy band hack. I suspect that this movie was a tax shelter/egg shell ploy to .. recycle... money; it had to be, because I can't believe any sane individual would have invested money to make this bomb thinking it was going to make a bit of profit, know what I'm sayin', yo, fugitaboudit. This movie was even worse than 2004's The Cookout.",1406419200,,824,4.769230769230769

2922256,3,B000UJCAKE,"I was curious about the storyline, so sent for this movie because it involved Italians.  Funny in some scenes and not believable in others.  Watched it once; probably won't watch it again.  Has its ups and downs and fairy-tale ending.  Great acting by Whoopi, as always.",1388707200,,270,4.804347826086956
2922257,5,B000UJCAKE,this movie is about a black man raised by an Italian family. I am Italian so i thought it was very funny.,1330905600,,105,3.8181818181818183
2922258,1,B000UJCAKE,I purchased it as a used DVD for $1.99.  It looked like it was never used and I found out why; no one would want to watch it twice.  It was not worth .99,1283731200,3,153,3.4705882352941178
2922259,2,B000UJCAKE,"Liking this film depends on just how tolerant of political incorrectness you are and forgiving of such dumb storylines. The film gets a big boost from the actors who in most cases are way better than the likes of this film, but know how to laugh at themselves and just go with it. It's a short little ""dumb dumb"" of a movie only clocking in at about an hour and fifteen minutes, but I found enough here to keep me chuckling for the most part. I also applaud the political incorrectness, because I'm a little tired of filmmakers walking on eggshells all of the time. If you see it on cable take out your brain and just go with it, its really a pretty funny little movie.",1278374400,4,669,4.275590551181103
2922260,5,B000UJCAKE,"I caught the end of this movie on cable and just had to buy it because it is HILARIOUS. Politically incorrect in almost every way it could be in terms of race relations, if this doesn't have you laughing out loud, you're a stick in the mud with no sense of humor and it's not for you anyway.

Donald Faison took his acting to another level in this movie. Loved it. It's one you can watch again and again and again.",1267056000,3,414,4.111111111111111
