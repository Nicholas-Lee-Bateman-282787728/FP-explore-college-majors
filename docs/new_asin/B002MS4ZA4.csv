8374029,5,B002MS4ZA4,"It seems a mystery that silent comedian Larry Semon should be forgotten today; after all, he was just as popular at the box office than Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd & Langdon in his days. His physical appearance--ears that stuck out like an elephant's; wide, expressive eyes; a thin slot of a mouth; and a silly putty nose--made Semon a natural as a film clown. Just one look at Semon goofily ambling into frame was usually enough to get an audience laughing. So what happened? Upon examination of his work in Volume 1, here are some theories:
1) Semon's screen character. While he was likable, his characterization was never clearly defined; he was goofy & oafish one moment, quick & clever the next. His character had a penchant for creating trouble as much as he tried to solve it. And when a film ended, Semon either came out on top or found himself in the doghouse.
2) Semon's extravagance as filmmaker. It was one thing for Semon to collaborate with the likes of comedy pro Norman Taurog (a smart move on his part). But when Vitagraph granted him creative control over his films, it became a dangerous thing. Undoubtedly, Semon's trademark were comedy sequences or gags done on a grand, elaborate level. Trains would destroy other objects (like homes or vehicles); people would fall twice as far to the ground (in reality, this would easily kill an ordinary person); and extended flying scenes or buildings exploding would be both dazzling & startling. As a result, Semon's extravagance would constantly make his productions run way over budget--a real headache for studios in which money is everything. And while these moments create a sense of awe or even suspense, sometimes they were just TOO awesome to be funny. In all fairness, Buster Keaton staged some pretty harrowing moments in his films; so really, Semon's in good company. In short, Semon loved to do everything BIG, and it's probably both his strength AND weakness as an artist.
But the dozen comedies here demonstrate that Semon had flashes of true genius. While his style bordered on the surreal or absurd (some of the physical comedy moments are eye-popping), it was Semon's invaluable old job as a cartoonist/graphic artist that came in handy, as he created some of the wildest moments in silent comedy. ""The Show"" revolves not only around Semon, but has a long montage of slapstick involving audience members. The action shifts to a train chase(a gag involving a home stuck on the tracks fools us into believing the train will switch tracks at the last second, sparing the home; it doesn't, as the train demolishes its target into kindling spectacularly). ""The Sawmill"" accents authenticity as Semon clowns with huge tree trunks on wheels. ""The Bellhop"" uses some imaginative animation (a lizard on the loose runs all over Semon's sleeping face), while a huge man dreams about swimming, dives off his bed, and plunges clear through to the lobby floor. ""Kid Speed"" lives up to its name in a wild car race that has near-misses & dazzling stunts. ""Dunces & Dangers"" puts wide-eyed Larry in the cockpit of a plane, helplessly along for the ride with a ""dummy"" pilot.
As common with the times, there's some racial humor (one unusual gag can be only described as ""reverse blackface"") sprinkled throughout the shorts. Lurking behind heavy makeup was then stock player Oliver Hardy, far more gruff & violent here than as the lovable pompous bumbler he'd portray with Stan Laurel.
If you give Semon a chance, there's much to like about his wild, elaborate, offbeat humor. Thank you, Classic Streams Video, for bringing Semon's work to light!",1351209600,2,3601,4.895253682487725
8374030,5,B002MS4ZA4,"I hate the fact that Larry Semon today is completely forgotten and his art totally neglected (here in Italy he was known as Ridolini, in Italian ""ridere"" means ""to smile""). Everyone when talking about Semon points out that he was only slapstick, no art. I'm not of the same opinion, Semon was a great comedian and a very talented action man. He incarnated the real spirit of the 20's and his story is so sad... The DVD shorts are very good and very soon I shall buy all the other volumes.",1331337600,4,488,4.373626373626373
