8241159,3,6304675704,"A very dark and violent movie.  There is no Hollywood happy ending at the end of this one!  What is bad is still bad, and there wasn't much good to begin with.  The movie deals with the homophobia that a closeted cop faces while trying to find a deranged serial killer.  The story is complicated by the fact that he slept with the killer; who is now trying to frame him for the killings.
This movie isn't for the faint of heart or anyone who has the slightest problem with homosexuality.  The violence is graphic and disturbing, and there is a lot of male nudity (and not just NYPD Blue rear views either).  However, the characters are engaging and are the real focus of the movie!
Stereotypes (we have seen the killer before in movies like Cruising) and formulas (closeted cop is outed while trying to solve a murder) aside, this is a good movie worth owing - or at least watching!",1017964800,,882,4.41358024691358
