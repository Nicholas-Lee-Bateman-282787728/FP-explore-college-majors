4501582,4,B004YMATCY,"this is a good show.  this product had a real good picture and sound on it.  of course I keep my equipment cleaned and maintained well.  I use HDMI video and this up scaled to this format very well for what the DVD was able to do.  the DVD works well.  this is a good show, it is no Disney but if you are not offended by some R rated scenes, this  is a good show.",1383523200,,363,3.710526315789474
4501583,5,B004YMATCY,Enjoyed the story and the drama. The cinematography was quite interesting and enjoyable to view. Glad that I finally found it available for purchase.,1378857600,,149,5.25
4501584,3,B004YMATCY,"I saw this film when it irst came out. Although dated I wanted it as part of my collection. It was an okay film and I am glad I have it..
It is great to see the London locations and although the acting woulf not win any awards it wasan okay film.",1376006400,,246,3.75
4501585,4,B004YMATCY,"Secrets is an interesting story, has interesting characters, but less than perfect direction and screenplay. worth watching just for Jacquiline's presence on the screen.",1365811200,6,169,6.083333333333333
4501586,3,B004YMATCY,"The film is only 85:43 in length as opposed to the 92 minutes promised on the DVD-R case packaging. As another reviewer stated, Jacqueline Bisset was the drawing card. I first saw the film shortly after it was theatrically released and bits of it kept coming alive in my mind. What was in the 6 minutes I didn't get? All three family members have affairs of their own without the other's knowledge. Who was the gent that took Judy home after she helped him at the laundromat? I never heard his name mentioned at any time. I don't know if it was Raymond or Dominic. And by that reasoning, who was the other guy? I'm not really happy with this non-revelation. If their names were revealed somewhere in the film, at what point were they mentioned? In their way the separate affairs shed new light on the lives they were currently living in. And it being on DVD-R there were no features.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secrets/dp/B004YMATCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secrets</a>",1325030400,22,1013,5.1454545454545455
4501587,3,B004YMATCY,This was an okay movie. The only reason I got it was because of the main star. I'm going to have to watch it again to see what it was about.,1323648000,2,140,3.5483870967741935
4501588,3,B004YMATCY,The transfer is not the best. It is a little out of focus like it was transfered from a good vhs. I gave it three stars only because it shows ample good veiws of bissets big firm naked breasts. The main plot was not very believable. It is a boring drawn out drama set all in one afternoon meeting a guy who is a stranger & leading up to the act of adultery. It is a full screen version that cuts off more of the edges than a normal full screen dvd.,1317254400,46,448,3.880434782608696
4501589,3,B004YMATCY,"This movie version was obviously censored. Therefore it rates only 3
stars regardless of the star power of Jacqueline Bisset.",1312243200,24,125,5.3
4501600,4,B004YMATCY,Perfectly satisfactory.,1442534400,,23,11.0
4501601,3,B004YMATCY,"Something of a curio and a film that I only previously vaguely remember seeing on British TV some twenty years ago. In many ways it now feels very dated, featuring as it does a young Jacqueline Bisset and a equally young Robert Powell plus London as it was in 1971. A very dull film with an uninspired script for which even viewing the gorgeous Jacqueline Bisset  naked isn't really compensation. Definitely a curio that only dedicated fans will feel obliged to add to their collection. Transfer from VHS tape is of acceptable quality and played well on my multi-region DVD player.",1440028800,2,581,4.752475247524752
4501602,4,B004YMATCY,"I bought the movie because Jacqueline Bisset, who is my age, has always been my favorite actress since I have been an adult. It would be difficult for me to rate any movie that she starred in less than a 3. And when she is involved in a erotic love scene as she was in this movie, I have to give it a 4, even though I did not particularly like the two featured male actors and the other female actress. . I also thought the theme of the movie could have been developed better.",1438905600,4,476,4.021052631578947
4501603,5,B004YMATCY,Love it,1438560000,,7,3.0
4501604,3,B004YMATCY,This is one of the most boring movies I've seen. But thank you for sending it out right away.,1436140800,,93,3.9473684210526314
4501605,5,B004YMATCY,"Wow,...... what a sex scene!!!!!!!!",1435190400,,35,6.2
4501606,4,B004YMATCY,"Not wonderful but thoughtful and featuring a rare scene prized amongst fans of Jacqueline Bisset who, in my opinion, remains underrated.",1432512000,,136,5.523809523809524
4501607,5,B004YMATCY,Very Good,1427760000,,9,4.0
4501608,2,B004YMATCY,"Rather boring except for Bisset in a very early UK role.
In my view an under-rated actress though recognised in France with an award for services to cinema.",1426464000,,156,4.607142857142857
4501609,1,B004YMATCY,The quality of the movie is poor. I can't imagine that someone would not edit the old VHS footage to DVD quality. This was a waste of money.,1426464000,,140,4.035714285714286
4501630,4,B004YMATCY,"Old movie, re-captured this time on a DVD (back when the movie produced only in VHS). I still very much enjoyed the movie, even I watched it quite a few times. One never gets old watching Jacquline Bisset, especially her steamy actions in this movie. Only drawback on this movie is that the picture quality is only acceptable, with OK clarity. Guess reproduced from VHS to DVD will not improve the original VHS quality.",1424044800,,419,4.675675675675675
4501631,3,B004YMATCY,The plot is very silly. The acting is only so-so. The only bright spot is perhaps to see Jacqueline Bisset's beautiful naked body.,1419033600,,130,4.695652173913044

4501635,3,B004YMATCY,"Early movie of Jacquline Bisset (they forgot the ""e"" in her first name, above) that is something of a sexploitation flick which has a weak plot and theme, with a good deal of Ms. Bisset in one semi-pornographic scene.  It's a difficult movie to find, so Amazon's stock is a good find if you are either a collector of such fare, or a fan of Bisset's and want to see her oldest movies.  Otherwise, it's the kind of movie that you can live with or without.",1407369600,3,453,4.255813953488372

4501638,3,B004YMATCY,"For fans of Jackie Bisset, this film is a gem of a movie! Worth having for the 2-minute love scene.",1397952000,,99,4.0
4501639,1,B004YMATCY,"Per another reviewer, I decided to verity the length of the film (though as IMDB says it is 92 minutes long I would certainly accept that as I have only had to correct them twice and both were on films just slightly pre-sound) and the VHS/cable was indeed 92 minutes.  So, to only be 85 some, something had to be removed - and I do not plan to buy a poor copy to find out what..  The film is worth putting out a real (not DVD-R) DVD/BluRay of.",1393286400,16,443,4.0227272727272725

8448576,3,B004YMATCY,Jacqueline Bisset's famous nude scene is the only redeeming quality of this film,1485475200,2,80,5.230769230769231
