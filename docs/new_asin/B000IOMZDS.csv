8146673,4,B000IOMZDS,"I saw this DVD playing at a local fishing tackle store and immediately purchased the set.  I have only viewed volume four so far.  Excellent information and well done.  Like all fishing DVD how to, they could show the terminal tackle in better detail, and spend a little more time on the subject, since it is such a very important part of the instruction.

The second DVD included was pretty much a waste of my time.  It added practically nothing to the learning experience--just some video of some guys fishing.",1393891200,,512,4.644444444444445
8146674,5,B000IOMZDS,"The whole series (4) is excellent.  It is like learning years' worth of  secrets and tips of experienced fishermen in a viewable program.  Valuable insight, techniques and even Lat/Lon numbers for actual hot fishing spots!  Worth much more than you pay for.",1168646400,,257,5.0476190476190474
