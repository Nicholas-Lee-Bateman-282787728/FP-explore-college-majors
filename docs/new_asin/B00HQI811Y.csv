6197347,5,B00HQI811Y,"Flowers in the Attic is the first book of the Dollanganger family series , there are 5 more books after this one. This book is so good and well written. I recommend it to mature readers because it does talk about controversial topics and its pretty dark. Other than that its a great read, it's about a mother and her kids that have to move into their grandparents house because the father has died and they cant afford to live in there home anymore. Even though the kids grandparents a horrible, the grandfather is on his deathbed and Corrine (mother) wants to get back on his will because he is incredibly rich. The father can not know about the kids, for reasons why Corrine was kicked out of the will in the first place, so they are hidden away in a small room that leads to the attic. Days turned into months then years and Corrine stopped visiting the in the room. She would say shes doing this for them but the kids just want to be with there mother. The kids then need to learn to take care of themselves, the two oldest once turn into parent figures to the twins. Its a great story with unexpected plot twists. I hope you enjoy :)",1479427200,,1138,4.297674418604651

6197358,2,B00HQI811Y,"I watched the first version of Flowers in the Attic years and years ago when I'd read the book for the first time.  For some reason, these twisted books have been a guilty pleasure of mine (and probably millions of others) ever since I read them 14 years ago.  I was excited to hear that they were making another movie and hoped that it would be truer to the book.  The first version was pretty pitiful.

This movie was okay.  Everything was rushed.  I mean, when the dad died there was no tears or anything.  Just a shot of everyone standing there looking shocked, then it cut to four months later.  It wasn't ever implied that Chris wanted to be a doctor and barely implied that Cathy wanted to be a ballerina.  The kids were quickly shoved into the room and they seemed a lot more accepting in the movie than they had been in the book.  There was a gradual decline of the mother's visits in the book but it seemed to happen quickly in the movie.  Motives weren't very clearly explained.

Cory and Carrie were almost an afterthought - at times I forgot they were even in the movie because it showed Chris and Cathy so much.  A big thing in the book was how Cathy was a mother to the twins and they didn't grow and got sicker and sicker.  The kids in the movie didn't say much, Carrie was supposed to be the howler who threw temper tantrums and Cory was the quiet one who played music.

Foxworth Hall in the book was huge and impressive.  In the movie it looked like a small upper-middle class home with none of the splendor.  The events in the movie stay pretty true to the book, the kids attending the Christmas party, Cory getting locked in the trunk, the whippings, tar and poisoned doughnuts.  But it was all so anti-climatic and the acting so forced that it wasn't convincing.  The whole ""rape"" scene between Cathy and Chris was pretty messed up in the book, I mean it was messed up in the movie too, but it was so anti-climatic because there was no build up to it in the movie like there was in the book.  Chris basically looks at Cathy once, tells her she is pretty then rapes her and she doesn't seem to mind.  Okaaaay.  When the kids manage to escape it was somewhat different in the movie, but again, it was just not interesting and I didn't really care or cheer for the characters.

Overall, a pretty poor adaptation of the book.  Hopefully someday someone will want to take on this series and do an amazing job of it because it would be nice to see this series really brought to life.",1469318400,,2498,4.3111587982832615

Just bits and pieces of the book thrown together with no real cohesion, and the acting was so flat and unconvincing, even the most harrowing scenes didn't touch me.

6197374,2,B00HQI811Y,"I was disappointed in the acting (I blame the director) and the general tone of the film. It needed much more of an edge considering the material. It undermines itself by presenting this horrific situation and treating it with a sort of ho hum indifference that waters down any potential that it had. It could have been MUCH darker and much more moving and thus much more effective if it had been directed that way. But instead you get this kind of milktoast flat homogenized boring presentation of what should be truly horrific circumstances (underage incest, horrific child abuse, psychological torture, filicide, etc.). I definitely put this in the 'could have been SOOO much better' category.",1449187200,,696,5.008620689655173

6197383,3,B00HQI811Y,"I had read the book a long, long time ago and also a long time ago saw the original terrible 80's movie adaptation.  So we've now got this version, a made for TV movie and it's obvious straight away it has that sort of budget.  You've got your big name drawcards (well for a TV movie they're big names) Heather Graham as the mother, and also an actress who although not that big a name has won an Academy Award, with Ellen Burstyn who plays the evil grandmother.  But these are important to the plot roles yes, but amount screen time roles, not so much.  They both do an okay job, especially Burstyn, but the main characters we follow the story through are the two older children.  There's also two younger children but they are mostly in the background and don't do much.  The two older children were supposedly pre or early teens.  The girl (who we are told in the extras they wanted as she was in Mad Men), Kiernan Shipka does a fairly believable job as being around that age, but although there wasn't really anything wrong with his acting, Mason Dye looked way older than a teen, he had a muscular physic of an adult who works out at the gym, probably to make him more appealing to audiences with his shirt off scenes, but representing a young teen, especially one confined to a room with no weights, wouldn't look like that.  It also made the story less plausible as he should have been able to overpower his grandmother (and both would know it) at any time.  Yet the story needs him to be physically scared of her for her threats of the strap to have any impact.

On the punishment, being a made for a TV audience film we don't really go there.  All we have is both Heather Graham and Dye, with their shirts off and some red marks on their backs.  We hear Dye wincing in pain as he is beaten but that's it, we don't actually see the punishment being dealt out. This sort of movie needed the audience to understand the violence and why they were so scared of the old lady (and perhaps the grandfather if he ever discovered them).  Likewise we don't really go into what made the book controversial, the older siblings as they went through puberty becoming interested lust wise in each other, since obviously there was no one else.  They do kiss at one time and perhaps its implied they explored each other later that night a bit more, but the movie pretty much leaves that major part of the story alone.

Flowers in the Attic to work, really needed the viewer to be scared for the children, whenever they made noise in the room or the attic, back answered the grandmother or their mother, or snuck out of the room. Yet we're never really scared for them, influenced I think heavily by as I mentioned earlier the ease of which the older boy could leave and take his siblings with him from the situation.  There is also an electric fence being built around the mansion, yet the reason for this is never explained.  Also why if the threat of discovery would end the inheritance, why weren't the kids simply shipped off somewhere else off the property until the grandfather died?  That would have made more sense.  Plus how plausible is it that no one could hear these kids in the attic, especially when they have a gramophone and a TV?  Perhaps these things were answered in the book but I don't remember them and they aren't answered in the movie.

You can argue that at least this version is better than the original movie, but the problem is when a movie is remade and it doesn't do the book justice, viewers have to wait another couple of decades for someone else to have a go.",1440547200,,3583,4.406676783004553
6197384,1,B00HQI811Y,"I would give it less than one if I could. The acting was pretty bad, but it had a lot to do with the horrible script. I couldn't make it through the whole thing. I had to stop 3/4 of the way through. It was painful.",1440288000,,215,3.6956521739130435

6197386,5,B00HQI811Y,"This was a great movie who followed the storyline of the book plot satisfactorily. You can see the how character developments change greatly with the emotional behavior, physical behavior, physical appearance, and clothes. Each character was important and beneficial to the story, which this movie showed MORE THAN the 1984 movie. The attic is one of the most important factors within the plot and the movie does that JUSTICE. The movie featured the attic with the original frightening look and change it to the fake garden which gives the audience thoughts about the characters and how they're feeling and thinking. In the end the movie satisfies the audience from the beginning to the very end.",1437782400,,696,5.060869565217391

In this version, it looks like a suburban McMansion.  The casting for Cathy is very wrong.  Are there no natural blondes in Hollywood?  So much of the book describes their white-blonde hair.  And ""wooden"" does not even describe the acting, particularly by Heather Graham.  She's absolutely wretched and wrong for the part.

I read it again recently at 40 something and didn't feel the same way. No matter there are interesting and horrific things in the book. This movie is WAY better then the one made in the 1980s, but it still fails to create tension, dread, the full selfishness of the mother, etc. The movie does try to hit the important scenes in the book. Yet do to lack of decent writing and set up and trying to make the film PG it bombs. I found I did not care about the characters. The most annoying change was that they took Cathy's insight and mistrust from the book. Also taking the faith Christopher had for his mother and melding it into what Cathy is thinking. Thank you for taking a strong thinking female that sees things as they are and watering it down... NOT... Other reviews talk about bad acting and/or casting and they have a point. But I think the script was so horrible that they did their best. In closing, the people that made this movie seem to not really understand why the story it is creepy and subversive.

6197428,3,B00HQI811Y,"First, let be start by saying I was never a true fan of the books.  At some point I started reading them in the youth culture cannon that all girls start to read beginning in junior high school or so.  The subject matter was then and still is shocking, that will never change despite all the liberalization we have gone through, nor will it ever be accepted.  But, it happens.  According to myth and legend, when VC Andrews herself was hospitalized for her injuries or arthritic condition, she encountered a doctor who told her that he and his siblings were locked in the attic like the children in this book to preserve family wealth or reputation.  If there was any ""questionable behavior"" by those she would write about in her characters' lives, she would say that it was based on things that may or may not have happened to friends and families, her own thoughts, or things that were in popular fiction at the time.  True?  It may be, but like everything else there is little to nothing to go on in terms of factual information and is left to the possibility of some gossip being true or not.  But I digress ...

A family is living in an idealistic and seemingly happy family life (Mom, Dad and four children) in 1957 in a Pennsylvania suburb when it all comes crashing down.  After their father is killed in a car accident, the mother tells the children that they are moving to her family's home.  This surprises the children Cathy, Chris, Cory and Carrie as they had never heard of these grandparents nor were they under the impression that they had any family outside of their immediate.  They are swept away to a gothic mansion in Virginia, and are shocked to learn of a few things.  Their formidable grandmother immediately hates them and sees them as some kind of curse, and the four children are forced up into the attic of the spacious mansion while their mother becomes kind of a timid mouse at the mercy of their grandmother's wrath.  They must be kept in the attic of the mansion, as their grandfather is dying and must never know that the children are living there.  Their mother explains that she has been estranged from her parents for many years and in order to win back his love and their ties to the family fortune the four children are to be kept hidden until his death.  The cause of the estrangement is that their mother, Corrine, and their father were related (half uncle and niece), and their love for each other disgusted the family to such an extreme that they disowned them.  Yes, the kids were a product of incest.  Corrine starts to visit the kids less and less, and eventually the kids become estranged from them and the two older kids, Cathy and Chris, become parents to their younger siblings.  Cathy and Chris, isolated from other kids their own ages, begin to go through their pubescent changes and feel their budding wants and needs to be sexual with each other.  Soon Cathy and Chris begin to plot to escape their prison, stealing cash and storing it away, as well as trying to care for their two younger siblings as substitute parents.

Many said that this adaptation was better than the first film that came out thirtysome years ago.  Of this I agree, as this film adaptation is closer to that of the book and didn't take the liberties that the first film did (what was with that bride jumping off a ledge or something?)  It was also a bit of a shock to see Heather Graham as the mother rather than as Cathy, but since she's about my age and should I be in this casting then I too would be the mother and not in the teenage roles that shot her into the stratosphere.  It was disturbing to see Cathy and Chris actually do IT when they didn't before, but, like I said, it's closer to the book than the first movie did.  If you were a fan of the books and are of a certain age, you will enjoy this.  If you are a kid you might not and find this disturbing and creepy, but it was kind of a throwback to way back when for those who are 35+.",1424649600,,3975,4.403556771545827

6197447,4,B00HQI811Y,"A perfectly honest review...

I recently read the book for the first time and then watched the 2014 TV-movie (and FYI, I'll be blunt and to-the-point): I thought Heather Graham and Ellen Burstyn as well as the the actors who plays Christopher and Cory were absolutely dead-on. Whoever played Cathy was 1) not a bad actress but 2) not at ALL the knock-out-go-get-'em-girl that Cathy Dahl of the books was. However, that said, this film is extremely faithful to the series with very few (but noticeable) detours. Those detours, however, are justifiable for a made-for-TV-movie and perfectly forgivable.

Short-answer: this was very good for what it was. If you're expecting an absolute true-to-the-source interpretation then you'll be delighted. However please keep in mind that this is a made-for-TV interpretation and excludes the rape scene, and moves through the story at break-neck speed so as to provide the viewer with an accurate portrayal of the novel.

All-in-all this was excellent. My only real complaint is that Heather Graham and Ellen Burstyn seemed very rushed. I am familiar with their other work so I know they are MORE than capable of these excellent roles (and I'm not saying they did these roles poorly because they didn't). I'm just saying they seem like they were hurried through their characters which disallowed character development, plot development, and missed a lot of key points that really laid the groundwork for how controversial this story actually was, especially for its time of publishing.

Please do see it.",1416528000,,1543,5.135458167330677

For starters, the acting is terrible, but more importantly, there was no way that sweet Ellen Burstyn could pull off the cruel grandmother; it did not fit her at all.

The only thing I *did* like about this remake version is that they explored the incest far, far more than the original did, and I think that's important since it's a huge part of the book.

Heather Graham is beautiful, but she's got strange ""bug"" eyes that never show much emotion. Just a blank stare. (Just my opinion, as I say, she is beautiful). I thought the grandmother in this movie showed more compassion than the grandmother in the original movie. She is still a tyrant and unlikeable, and in the book showed no compassion what so ever. They didn't take out the incest angle of the story. However, those complaining about this need to realize that the whole book series, and as such, the movie series, is based off of the terrible family incest secret, and to take it out of the story line would be leaving out the reason the children ended up locked up in the attic to begin with after their father died.

6197521,3,B00HQI811Y,"This Lifetime version has a sequel, Petals on the Wind, which perhaps explains why its ending differs from what other reviewers were expecting.

Two basic ideas, incest and resultant cruelty as a pattern in the family, pervade.  Very difficult to watch, with Petals on the Wind being somehat lighter and more hackneyed, but a completion which alike begs for a third followup.

You can know the plot and still find the portrayals creepy.  So here's an important spoiler: it's not clear from the Lifetime movie why the children are 'abominations' or 'devil spawn'.  Answer, since the movie won't say, and you'll find it impossible to follow, if you don't know: they are children of incest themselves.  Ancient Egyptian and other culture's practice of deeming such unions 'holy', is thus invoked.  Movie basically explores the notion of incest producing mental illness.

Some reviewers complained about the sudden ability to leave the attic, as if that were a mistake in the story.  In fact, the obviousness of it makes their staying afterwards, demonstrate their psychological dependence, and lets the audience know that the father must have died; so their continuing to stay, means either the mother or the grandmother, secretly wants to allow them to escape; knowing that if they do, they will not alert the police.  Very clever direction, to keep all that silent, allowing the audience to figure it out merely by the sudden access, which was preceded by the last appearance by the grandfather, and their mother's allowing them to 'hide' in the bar, at their first 'Christmas' since incarceration in the attic.  So it seems like the mother loves them after all.. until they observe her kissing a man they learn is her new fiance.

So who's the enemy?  Grandmother, or mother?  So they don't leave when they get access outside, not wanting to leave mother behind.  So then more drastic measures must be employed, to get rid of them...

Finally, many have complained about Heather Graham's performance, but I found it convincing; a woman who snaps but is shallow at the same time, would act as she did.  Ms. Burstyn was consummate as the cruel grandmother with an undertone of empathy for the children.  She gave such a reality to the conflicted character that I often had to turn away from the screen when watching.",1401148800,2,2314,4.920103092783505

Anyone who has read the book will most likely be as disappointed with this film as they were with the first. With that said I still liked it as I did the first but this is the more faithful adaptation. When I first saw the advertisements on Lifetime about this [will explain why I was watching that in a minute] I was excited. I had to tell my lady as she loves the book and even the first flick. I had been over at my grandparents house visiting them when I saw this on their screen. Lifetime has had some good flicks from time to time so I thought this would be one.

The story follows a family just like any one else, parents and children living a happy life. That is until the father dies and leaves the mother with all the kids and all the bills. She cant afford them on her own so she does what she never thought she would do, go home. It turns out that she is from a wealthy family but left home for the man she loved and married. Once there her evil mother allows her and her children in but they have to stay locked in a room upstairs. Their mother promises that she will fix everything, but can she?

This is a more faithful adaptation of the book but there are things changed for the screen. But was left intact was the incest that made the book so infamous. With that said while more faithful it isn't a perfect film. I have read others say they didn't like the acting but I thought it was good here, especially Ellen Burstyn as the grandmother. She did an excellent job here was wonderfully evil but I thought Heather Graham was just as good. She did a great job because I believed her in the role. The kids were good as well and each did their job. The film was written by Kayla Alpert who is also the writer of the upcoming sequel. Her script may have been the problem here as it was not as dark as I had hoped but that may be because it was written for TV.

I thought this was a good flick and had a good time watching it on TV then again on DVD. You get a behind the scenes look and trailers as the special features. I honestly would have loved a commentary from director Deborah Chow or something. Still over all it was a good flick and I will be catching the next one on Lifetime.",1400025600,4,2221,4.087155963302752
6197531,3,B00HQI811Y,"This remake of Flowers In The Attic was much better than the first, but I believe it didn't even come close to how great the book is.",1399939200,2,133,3.962962962962963
6197532,4,B00HQI811Y,i saw the first movie made in the 80's and this movie had more details and better scripting so i would say i did enjoy this movie much more than the first.,1399852800,,155,3.875
6197533,2,B00HQI811Y,"This was very disappointing to me.  I loved that it was a 1950's period piece, the way it originally should have been (I always laugh at the 80s clothes and hair in the Kristy Swanson version).  I also enjoyed seeing things come to life from the book that were omitted from the original film (the swimming scene, the tar, the incest, etc.)  If only I could take some of the new improvements and mix them with the acting and overall gothic vibe of the 80s version (plus the ending from the book), I'd have the perfect movie.

What I did not enjoy:

- The horrendous acting from everyone involved.  I think the only one I ever believed in the slightest was Mason Dye as Christopher.  This is a story of passions and Cathy is hotheaded, irrational and emotional beyond belief.  Watching Kiernan Shipka was like watching a 2X4 attempt to break into showbiz.  Acting is difficult when you're just a piece of wood.  Well, another day and another dollar right?  I honestly have nothing to say about Heather Graham that I haven't already said about Shipka - which is sad, since she has decades more experience under her belt.  Worst performance of hers I've ever seen.  Also, I never once bought Ellen Burstyn as the psychotically cruel Grandmother.  In the original I was terrified of Louise Fletcher and never once doubted that she would hesitate to kill them all in their sleep.  Ellen Burstyn made me laugh rather than flip on all the lights.  No dice.

- That ending.  WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT???!!!  It was stupid to change it from the ending in the original book (I'm sure they only did it to add to the ""drama"" aspect of the plot).  The original ending was perfectly good, and would have served just as well to transition into the rest of the series.  Yet another stupid ending, for another FITA adaptation.

I guess I should probably steer clear of Petals when it airs on Memorial Day, especially after watching this hack job, full of wasted potential.  Yet, since almost everyone is recast, I will probably tune in and hope beyond all hope that things improve.  Just please Lifetime, don't screw up My Sweet Audrina.

Having Cathy give her ""promise"" ring to the grandmother did not sit well.  So she had a problem with the father, that does not mean she had to punish the kids.  It amazed me that they believed Corinne for so long, I would have left the time she said to go, even if it is without financial support. Better than living in that hellish situation.

6197537,3,B00HQI811Y,"...it still left a lot to be desired.  The book took place over a period of three years, and a lot happened in those three years.  It also dealt with very touchy subject matter that would not be easy to include in any film or TV show.  In the book, you could get inside Cathy's head and reach an understanding of why things were happening the way that they did.  Because that didn't happen in the movie, it was almost impossible to understand what motivated the relationship between Chris and Cathy to become so unhealthy and ultimately disturbing.  In the movie the way the characters reacted about the change in their relationship failed to show just how conflicted and confused Cathy was, as well as how and why she blamed her mother and grandmother for Chris' actions toward her.  And yet, at least this version did not pretend there was no incest in the book at all, as the first movie apparently did.

I was more upset about the almost total lack of focus on Cathy's dancing, something that was so intrinsically her that to leave it out, or barely touch on it, was almost sacrilegious.  Also glossed over was the jealousy that Corrine had clearly felt toward Cathy, both regarding her first husband (Cathy's father) and her second.

As for the casting and the acting, everyone seemed to do an adequate job with the material they were given.  The stand-out was, of course, ""The Grandmother"".  Ellen Burstyn did an amazing job as the grandmother.  She made it all worth watching.  Heather Graham, however, phoned-in her performance.  I was not impressed.  The children did the best they could, but they were all miscast, especially Cathy.  While I am unhappy the next movie jumps ahead a decade, I am glad it means they recast the children's parts.

Personally, I like both for their own merits, and the contrasts are numerous, though some rather subtle. Louise Fletcher and Ellen Burstyn put their own spin on their portrayal of the Bible thumping tyrant of the grandmother. Both child casts do a nice job, but Heather Graham as the mother is very hard to like or even care about, the original's wasn't much better. I was most impressed with Ellen's grandmother being subtly more vulnerable, esp.when she saw the kids stand up to her and their mother, that was very impressive to me, underneath that fanatic exterior, she definitely had a weakness or two. I also liked how the teenage siblings saw through their mother's deception a lot faster. Louise Fletcher was menacing yes, but she showed almost no emotion at all, I know most villians have little to no conscience, but Louise seemed so inhumane, I wasn't buying it, to me it was way too over the top.

6197547,4,B00HQI811Y,"Back in the late 80s, when I was in junior high, several of the girls in my class started reading FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC by V.C. Andrews.  I knew nothing about the book and honestly thought nothing of it at the time, having developed a healthy appetite for horror in the forms of Clive Barker, Stephen King, Dean Koontz and many others.  But when the teachers at our school forbid the girls to carry the book around with them, I became intrigued.  What was all the fuss?  Curious, I checked the book out from the city library and gave it a shot.  WOW.  Not what I was expecting at all, but very good nonetheless!  One might even say it has tinges of horror in it, which is partly why I liked it so much.  The underlying tones in the book have haunted me to this very day.

When I learned Lifetime was making a movie version, I jumped at the chance to watch it.  After all, the book was (and still is) deemed controversial because of some of its subject matter, so who wouldnt want to see a televised version of something like that?  Although the movie is toned down quite a bit from the book, this is a still a very faithful adaptation to the source material and one heck of a film.

There was another movie adaptation of this book that debuted in 1987, however it (in my opinion) is not nearly as good as this 2014 version.  It was well made for the most part, but it did not capture the dark tone of the book.  You cant have a decent movie adaptation of a book unless you can actually bring the depths of the book to the screen.

FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC is shot well and seems to have a pretty modest budget.  I particularly like the house they chose as the location; it fits what I saw in my head almost perfectly.  The acting, likewise, is solid.  I will admit I am surprised with the choice of Heather Graham as the childrens mother, however she does a good job with the role.  Ellen Burstyn, however, steals the show as the overbearing, self-righteous grandmother.  Her cold demeanor and rough exterior should be enough to garner an Oscar nod, in my opinion.

The actors who tackle the roles of the children do a superb job as well.  Kiernan Shipka is ideal as the films narrator, Cathy, and she plays off of co-star Mason Dye like a pro.  Dye, respectively, handles his man-of-the-house persona with ease.  Ava Telek and Maxwell Kovach are adorable as the twins, and I hope to see more of both onscreen.

The story follows the book very well, however Lifetime barely touches some of the more controversial aspects of the book.  I will not go into detail because you must read the book AND see this film, and I don't want to ruin either.  But I do understand this is a made-for-TV movie, so taboo topics cannot always be fleshed out.

FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC is a definite win for me and fans of thrillers and mysteries should have a blast with this film.  The film hits store shelves next Tuesday, so make a note to check it out.",1397174400,3,2928,4.321100917431193

6197558,5,B00HQI811Y,"I had never heard of flowers in the attic until I saw this movie on lifetime. this movie gave me brain and emotion's a run for it's money. it was thrilling and dark. the character's were dark and wonderful. from watching them movie and then reading the book, I have to say the movie did a wonderful job at taking the book to flim. their were of course a few things that they changed. but nothing huge. which is wonderful since most book when put to film end up nothing like the book.

like in the book, it is through the eyes of Cathy a young girl when her world is turned upside down by her father's death. her mother is forced to either get  ajob or get money. their mother Corinne takens them to her parents house, where dark and evil secrets lie waiting for the family of the dollanager or foxworth as they find out is their real name.  once they get to the home of their grandparents , the most wealthiest family in Viregina , they are brought up to the norther wing were they are locked in a room, with a bathroom and stairs to an attic. where they spend three years waiting for to come out. for if their grandfather knew they lived, their mother would never get any money and they'd die. but their mother leaves them up there visiting from time to time with gifts. and their grandmother leaves baskets of food in their one room.

as the story goes on we learn the dark secrets of Corinne and their own past. Corinne married her half uncle. which we later find out isn't totally true. Corinne is not the daughter of Oivlia (the gradmother ) and Malcume foxworth( grandfather) she is the daughter of Malcume and Alicia , the mother of Chris ( her husband) they are half brother and sister. but Corinne was never told this , she never knew. only ones who did where Malcume Oivlia and of course Alicia.

I feel that every detail in the Flowers in the attic book was made very clear in this lifetime movie. from someone who read the books after and not before,this was very very good! but veryone should reads all the books! that way you understand all the angles of this dark and thrilling tale of love, incest and dark secrets .",1394236800,6,2132,4.32

In a bizarre unbelievable situation, Heather Graham's four children must live quietly in an attic and pretend they are not there. As the teens become of age , the results are what is expected. There is apparently some kind of theme or message to all of this nonsense, but the inanity of the situation masks it.

Both Ellen Burstyn and Heather Graham did a great job in playing their roles---Ellen as the sadistic, punitive, and domineering grandmother and Heather as the secretive, superficial, delusional, borderline-like mother of the four children in the attic. The kids' acting was passable and average, but it is their condition and suffering that adds a painful theme to this movie. In spite of their having such a demented mother they all appear to be quite normal, so their extreme conditions in the attic makes the viewers feel empathy for them and revulsion at what they have to endure; then too we feel anger at their mother for being part of such dastardly plan to ""become rich.""  One interesting part of the film is that the plot and the kids' suffering are so disturbing that we viewers hang on for some explanation as to why it is so necessary for them to suffer so much indignity if the main goal is just to inherit some money. Is there a hidden agenda by the mother who on the surface expresses so much love for them? Why is the grandmother so sadistic towards the mother and the kids? Or is the kids' suffering simply an unfortunate consequence of having a grandmother and a mother with personality disorders?  The ending of the story is not quite satisfactory to me, but, then again, what other ending could this story possibly have?  Very well made movie.

But a 26 year old playing a 16 year old boy and an 18 year old playing the part of a 13 year old girl, just didn't work.  Also, Louise Fletcher's role of the Grandmother, appeared to me, to be one in the same of the nurse character she played in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.",1392249600,2,555,3.955357142857143

I also saw the original version of the movie, that version of it was terrible, but at least the actors could well...act. In this version, the only one who is even remotely passable as her character is Ellen Burstyn. And it's hard to say she was great, not necessarily due to her acting skills, as I think she's a terrific actress, but due to the fact it was hard ""believing"" she was mean, twisted, evil..as in most of her other roles she is so likeable.
Heather Graham' s acting was awful, just awful. She needs to stick to Austin Powers, baby. The actress playing Cathy was so not the right one for that role. I think she was too young. Many actors/actresses play parts that are younger than their ages, and they do it well. I think there was surely someone who could've played the part of Cathy and done her character justice. Miss Shipka's acting skills were ok, she just wasn't the right ""fit"". The actor portraying Christopher was ok, just ok. At least he appeared believable age wise.
This version was more true to the book. But I think there wasn't enough time to ""flesh out"" the story, everything was rushed. I suppose that may be a good thing, to get it all over quicker.
Lastly it's a sad thing that I enjoyed the haunting version of Guns n Roses Sweet Child O' Mine  better than this movie.",1391990400,15,1418,4.310861423220974

6197568,3,B00HQI811Y,"I never read V.C. Andrews infamous Best-Seller ""Flowers In The Attic."" But for years I've heard it was a ""dirty"" book because there is incest in the plot. Now, Lifetime TV unveiled a highly publicized TV movie that is faithful to the book. Well, nothing sells books and movies like controversy, so I decided to tune in and see what all the fuss was about. After watching this movie, nothing could induce me to read the book. But I will say that Lifetime Network and ""Attic"" are a perfect match.
  Lifetime Network specializes in lurid, usually sexually driven, tales featuring psychotic women and/or abuse victims.""Attic"" features two psychotic women and four abuse victims. There is the mother Corrine (Heather Graham) who has her kids locked up in a room upstairs until she can get herself back into Daddy's will.
Corrine was disinherited, you see, because she married her father's half-brother (her own Uncle). The children, Christopher, Cathy, and two younger twins, are left to the mercy of their sadistic Grandmother, who brings them daily food and dishes out punishments. The children are told they will be locked up for a few days. This turns into imprisonment that lasts two years.  The children receive  daily food baskets, an old-fashioned TV to watch, no school at all, and excessive  punishments from Grandmother. Corrine has no intention of letting the children out. She's having a high time living the good life without them. Is it any wonder, really, that Cathy and Christopher (Kiernan Shipka and Mason Dye) drift into an incestuous relationship as an emotional escape from prolonged abuse from Corrine and Grandmother?
  Everyone is so freaked out by the Cathy-Christopher incest that nobody mentions the fact that Grandmother has a whip and she LOVES to use it, or that Corrine tries to kill her children with poisoned dougnuts!! One of the younger twins does die, which doesn't bother Corrine for an instant. At least Ellen Burstyn effectively chews the scenery as Psycho Grandmother (""Your very conception is an ABOMINATION of God!). As emotionally manipulative Psycho Corrine, Heather Graham barely registers any emotion whatsoever.
  Mason Dye is especially nice, handsome and guilty ""eye candy""  for the audience. Somehow, Dye and Shipka manage to keep their heads above the increasingly disturbing mess of ""child abuse as a form of entertainment."" ""Attic"" is like a car wreck you can't bear to witness, but you don't dare look away, either. Watching the movie, you never wonder why Lifetime made it (Lifetime thrives on this stuff), but you do wonder what the hell was going on in V.C. Andrews' twisted mind when she wrote the original book! ""Attic"" is the worst kind of pulp fiction; deliberately designed to shock and disturb. When the viewer realizes how easily Psycho Grandmother is defeated, ""Attic"" comes into sharper focus as even more cruel, cold and manipulative. ""Attic"" spawned sequel books and, with sensational ratings, it's no surprise that Lifetime will produce sequel films. It's no surprise that, with Lifetime and ""Attic"", you get exactly what you expected; and you feel a bit sick and dirty after you watch it.",1391904000,2,3154,5.059730250481696
6197569,5,B00HQI811Y,"I have read all the books in the series by V.C Andrews  and I thought, they were great. ""Flowers in the attic"" was my favorite. This version of the movie, released in 2014 is more true to the book, which I liked. The movie was about a family, whose father died and left them with no money. The mother decided to go home and make amends with her angry father, in order to inherit his fortune. She and the grandmother hid her children, Cathy, Carrie, Corey and Chris in the attic, making sure the grandfather did not know of their existence. There was a lot of drama and suspense, which I loved. I could not wait for this movie to come to television and it did not disappoint. I loved it, so much in fact, I purchased the movie, as soon as it became available. The characters of Chris and Cathy made the movie come to life for me.  The young actors were passionate, wonderful and very talented. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat, waiting to see what would come next. if you loved the book, ""Flowers in the Attic"" as I did, you will love the movie.

6197570,2,B00HQI811Y,"I was so looking forward to watching this - I really loved the 80's version, but thought it punked out by not involving the incest material from the book, which was, after all, why everyone read it!  Lol...  With that said, the acting in this was so, just, BLAH - Kiernan Shipka seemed to be rehashing her Mad Men character, and was unbelievable as a blonde.  I'm sure they could have found ONE really blonde young actress who could have played the role.  She also had literally zero chemistry with the boy who played her brother - who was almost as blah as Kiernan.  They almost completely ignored Cathy's obsession with ballet - which was mentioned and alluded to, but not really clear.  Heather Graham seemed to have lost her acting ability for the entire film, and while Ellen Burstyn is a great actress, she was nowhere near as terrifying as Louise Fletcher in the 80's version.  And this is the real problem - the cast, story, and vibe of the 80's version was so much better - more suspenseful, believable, and terrifying - even WITHOUT the incest.  And unless Lifetime plans to make films of the entire series, the 80's version ended the film better as well.  In the 80's version, I think we all GOT why the kids didn't just kick grandma's rear end and walk out - but here?  There seemed to be little reason to remain prisoners.  Readers of the series know where this story eventually goes, but I kind of suspect Lifetime isn't planning this to be a series, so they should have allowed the same closure we saw in the 80's film.  As it is, there was virtually no real closure.

Overall, a big disappointment.  I waited 20 years for a good film adaptation of this book, and I guess I'll have to keep waiting.  Meh.",1391731200,7,1719,4.464743589743589

6197582,2,B00HQI811Y,"There were some good and bad things about this movie. However, the bad does outweigh the good, in my opinion.

The good things:
This movie was more true to the book than the first movie. The cutting of Cathy's hair at the hands of Chris, as well as the hanging of their mother in the wedding dress being left out because it was never a part of the ending in the book.
This movie was more controversial than the first movie because they were bold enough to tackle the subject that was taboo in the first film.
Heather Graham made a good ""mother.""
Ellen Burstyn made a good ""grandmother."" I just wish she would have done more.

The bad things:
All of the children were horribly miscast, and all were equally terrible actors.
The ""grandmother"" was way too soft. Louise Fletcher was scary, mean, heartless, and she absolutely killed her performance.
This movie was so rushed that we were deprived of the small details that made the first film so creepy. We barely got to know anything about the twins and how close they were. We didn't get to see the little things like the gravedigger digging the graves, or the mother poisoning the cookies, or in this case, doughnuts.
The incest was apart of the book, and I applaud the fact that they weren't afraid to go there, but those scenes before and after were still cringe-worthy. They seemed proud of what they had done.
It seemed crazy to me to watch those kids come in and out of that room like it had a revolving door, while at they same time we are supposed to believe they were still helpless to leave when the older kids were still coming and going as they felt like it.
Cathy sneaking around and kissing her mother's boyfriend on the lips was stupid.
These kids were not actually locked inside the attic like the first movie.
I hated the ending because there was no justice for the Dollanganger children, and yes I have read the book, but I still didn't like that. Sometimes trying to make a movie too much like the book doesn't work, and in this case, it didn't. Their mother literally got away with murder.

That being said, I already acknowledged that this movie was like the book. Now, whether that's a good thing or a bad thing, depends on who you ask. I know that the mother was absolutely not hanged by her own wedding dress in the book, but that provided a type of closure that I liked to the first movie being that there were no sequels made. That part being left out of this movie, for me, only made the ending seem unfinished. It left something to be desired. Don't get me wrong, the things that I found stupid about the book are the exact same things that I found stupid about the movie. You are welcomed to disagree all you like, but like I said, it was stupid. Cathy sneaking around kissing her mother's boyfriend, the key to the door, none of those scenes were in the first movie which made it more believable. Seriously...you and your siblings are being beaten and held captive, and all you can think about is what it's like to kiss a man on the mouth, so you do it...un-freaking-believable!

On top of that, I have a hard time believing that anyone is being held against their will when they have made a key to the damn door and they are going back and forth as they please. That's even more unbelievable now in 2014. In other words, despite what was in the first movie or the book, their captivity (if it could be considered that since they had a key) shouldn't have taken years, I don't give a flip about the mental as well as physical boundaries that kept them there, one of the twins died for no reason, and they could have left anytime they felt like it. Their mother actually let them out for the party, so it was clear she made no effort to conceal her true nature. Why would she let them out at her own engagement party so they could spy from an enclosed case inside the bar if they weren't even supposed to exist much less be seen? WTF! All of that was absurd!

It was just an okay Lifetime made for T.V. movie. I was disappointed really, and I couldn't wait to see it after I heard they were remaking it.",1390867200,3,4080,4.363157894736842

Flowers In The Attic (2014) is a TV remake of the original movie that came out in 1987.  I have not seen the original.  In fact, I'm watching this movie right now as I'm typing this review (on somebody's iPad, no less).  I'm not exactly impressed so far, and it's almost the end of the movie.  The best acting is coming from a veteran, Ellen Burstyn (of The Exorcist fame).  This movie just isn't doing it for me.  It's about kids who are locked in an attic for a couple of years.  The other actors seem to be phoning in their performances.  Anyway, the musical score is fair, the direction is sound, but this movie falls flat.  I've heard the original movie is much better.  I'll have to check that one out.

Effective movie-making, well-cast, Heather Graham nails her part, Ellen Burstyn brings surprising depth and humanity to a character who could have easily been a one-dimensional monster, and Kiernan Shipka and Mason Dye have great chemistry and are completely believable in their difficult roles.

As a huge V.C. Andrews fan, I was very pleased with this adaptation. Can't wait for Lifetime's production of its sequel Petals on the Wind.",1390521600,5,591,5.4945054945054945

6197594,2,B00HQI811Y,"Everyone said this one was better than the original. Different? Yes. Better? Not so sure.  I think Kiernan Shipka was wrong for the part of Cathy. She wasn't engaging. I didn't find myself rooting for her.  There was so little interaction between her and her mother, which was something pretty important in the book - as she grew up the mother got increasingly threatened by her beauty and her relationship with the twins and Christopher.

This movie rushed through (admittedly many) plot points and it was hard to tell what anyone's motivation was.  Why did the mom leave them up there so long? Yes she was enjoying her time as a free, single, wealthy woman, but it was never totally clear why she left them and (spoiler alert) tried to kill them.  Why was the grandmother so alternatingly mean and also sympathetic?  I think Ellyn Burstyn oversold the sympathetic parts.  Definitely chewed the scenery.

Heather Graham definitely looked more like the mother I pictured in the book but she was so clearly phoning it in. You signed up for a Lifetime remake of a terrible YA novel from the 70s. I get it. But at least make it interesting.

I watched it for the novelty of it but I hope some day someone makes a more interesting version of this story. This definitely didn't do anyone justice.",1390348800,35,1291,4.651982378854625

6197597,3,B00HQI811Y,"A longtime V.C. Andrews fan, I was definitely stoked when I heard about the remake in the works. I only watched part of the 1980s version and I quickly had to turn it off. This version I found far more bearable. Granted, it is a TV made movie , yet it does do a decent if not good job. Some details were left out and I would have loved for those details to be more incorporated. Other moments also seemed rushed, but understandable seeing as they had to be in a time constraint. I am glad they did include the more taboo subjects as opposed to the 1987 version.

As other have stated I would have loved for those details to be incorporated and some of the characters to be more developed as they are in the book (Christopher being a ""know it all,"" dreaming of becoming a doctor, etc), Cathy and Christopher's own relationship and their parental role they take on. Also, I felt I didn't get to see the twins' personalities either. In order for these details and the character's development to be captured, I am sure the movie would have had to be at least another hour long! Or at least a mini series.

None the less, Ellen Burstyn was amazing as the grandmother and for the most part everyone seemed to do a good job in their role.

I am glad the film follows the original story fairly well (though there are some inconsistencies, missing events). *SPOILER* In particular I was bothered by the scene between Cathy and Chris in the attic (the rape/sex scene). In the book, Cathy and Chris are both traumatized and upset after the incident. Understandably they are both freaking out in the book (unprotected sex with your sibling and all). In the movie, nope, let's smile and giggle and have some nice pillow talk. What??

I think the beauty of Foxworth Hall wasn't captured nor those small details from the book either (swan bed with curtains, emerald green Christmas dress, Cathy's waist length hair,etc.) I think everything being rushed bothered me because everything progresses slower in the book and allows for many of the incidents to sink in.

The book is way more intense and emotional as well as dense. I think having another hour or mini series could have easily made the film more amazing since Flowers in the Attic is a somewhat long book. Those missing details and development would have made the film more awesome. I still enjoyed the film and think it is an alright to good adaption for being a television movie.",1390089600,25,2425,4.552752293577981
6197598,2,B00HQI811Y,"The movie didn't do the book justice.
It was still alright, but the book is better. Even the original movie from back in late '80's was just a bit better for me.
Ellen Burstyn is what I liked about this movie. She could play anything and be amazing though. Heather Graham was alright too.
I just feel like a couple key moments in the book weren't in this film, or were changed that I didn't get the same effect as reading the book.
I get they had to make it made for tv, but those moments they left out were important to the story. It just fell short for me.
Would I recommend watching? No, read the book, any edition.

8634285,4,B00HQI811Y,"I would say that this is a straight TV movie adaptation of the classic V.C. Andrews novel as opposed to a remake of the 80s classic which is up there with Mommie dearest as a love to hate kind of film that lives in infamy. The newest version is enjoyable if not extremely hit or miss. The incest between the siblings is touched upon without ever getting graphic, and Heather Graham who is an inconsistent actress at best actually works as a selfish, trophy wife turned gold digging daughter. Adaptations are always a tricky thing. Inevitably things are going to be changed or omitted. There was definitely a better fear factor with the original film. Ellen Burstyn doesn't really terrify the way you want that character to. She plays the bitterness and religious fanaticm well, but you never really get scared that she's going to do something extreme which is the entire point of the grandmother. The kids are pretty if not a touch forgettable, but the performances are good overall. I would say that to enjoy this you have to be able to separate yourself from any feelings for the original film and accept the fact that the novel was lurid in ways that most filmmakers would not be willing to explore, especially for television. Well done film if you're in the mood for a night of decent trash tv.",1507507200,,1298,4.623376623376624
8634286,1,B00HQI811Y,". . . . . and when will they ever learn?

That was what was going through my mind as I watched this attempt by Lifetime. Some have raved about it because it included more of the incestuous relationship between the two oldest siblings (toned down though it was for television) but that alone does NOT make it a better film. With one exception, the acting was atrocious. Heather Graham has given some decent performances over the years, but this was not one of them. She seemed to be sleepwalking the entire time. Kiernan Shipka was monotonous and irritating as Cathy (her voice-over included); Mason Dye was stiff, and there was no chemistry between Christopher and Cathy. Cory (Maxwell Kovach) and Carrie (Ava Telek) were pretty much non-entities in this version. Ellen Burstyn, fine actress that she is, gives a good performance but she was completely miscast as the grandmother. Not menacing, dominant or intimidating and far too sympathetic. It's hard to imagine the older kids being scared of her; the twins, maybe.

CGI took the place of the family mansion, Foxworth Hall (doesn't anyone scout for locations anymore?), and the sets, frankly, looked like sets. The music was also nothing special. Worse, it feels extremely rushed; while it is mentioned that Cathy, Chris, Cory and Carrie were locked away for three years, no attempt was made to make them look sunlight-deprived or lacking for food. The bond between the two older siblings was downplayed, and their role as parenting the twins barely shown, making their closeness and growing romantic feelings for each other come out of nowhere. Cathy's love for dance is hardly mentioned, and they were not really locked away as they were in the book or the 1987 version. Corinne is such a blank slate and it's never explained why she left her kids there for so long. The attic seemed to have lost much of its significance as well.

While the 1987 film is flawed, V.C. Andrews did have script approval and the intent of the director (who also penned the screenplay) was to be as close to the book as possible. Unfortunately, a negative reaction at a test screening caused the studio to severely cut the film and add an ending that fans of the novel rightly despised. Even with those changes, it is still superior to the TV adaptation in terms of acting, chemistry, location, atmosphere and music. Louise Fletcher was terrifying as the grandmother, and Ellen Burstyn just wasn't, despite giving the best performance in the Lifetime presentation. The 1987 movie has a very haunting feeling that will stay with you after it is over (helped by Christopher Young's amazing score). Let's hope that the original director's cut will see the light of day and will hopefully obliterate this vapid, hollow Lifetime tripe from memory.",1505865600,,2777,4.879237288135593
