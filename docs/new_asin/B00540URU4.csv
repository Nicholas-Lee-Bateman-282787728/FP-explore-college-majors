4556225,5,B00540URU4,"I am an elderly veteran with service connected back injuries.  I am very cautious about following just any popular fitness ""guru.""
Over the years, I have studied a lot of fitness systems and reviewed a lot of clinical research - especially Dr Stuart McGill's outstanding research.

Dr Stuart McGill has performed extensive clinical research on the exercises that help the back, as well as the many popular exercises - espoused by muscle magazines, and pop gurus - which destabilize the back.

After months of trying and experimenting, I finally found the articulate, insightful and comprehensive instructions I needed to safely proceed with Kettle Bell Training.

I am amazed at your deep understanding of the principles which Dr Stuart McGill espouses. I am also impressed by the level of care and detail with which you convey these concepts to your students.

Thank you for producing such a needed product.",1358467200,10,908,5.108108108108108

KETTLEBELL BOOMER is a DVD designed to bring the power of kettlebell training to users of any age group.  Although marked specifically to older adults--the athletes featured range in age from 58 to 65, and there are various references to staying fit during the senior years--the workouts on this DVD are appropriate for all ages and all levels of fitness. The DVD is instructed by Andrea Du Cane, Master RKC.  Those who tried Du Cane's previous DVD,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Kettlebell-Goddess-Workout-How-to-Achieve-and-Maintain-a-Divine-Body-with-the-World-s-Most-Effective-Tool-for-Weight-Loss-Strength-Endurance-and-Flexibility/dp/B001CBFH0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Kettlebell Goddess Workout: How to Achieve and Maintain a Divine Body with the World's Most Effective Tool for Weight Loss, Strength, Endurance and Flexibility</a>, will be pleasantly surprised to discover that she is much more warm and engaging in this video.  She begins with a short (5.5 minute) Introduction that leads directly into the Main Menu, which appears as follows:

*Before You Begin (3.5 minutes; includes tips on selecting the correct size kettlebell and a ""self-screening"")
*Exercise Instruction (35 minutes total; offers detailed breakdowns of ALL exercises included in the program, with a particularly helpful, thorough review of the kettlebell swing)
*Workouts
*Athlete Interviews (short interviews--about 4 minutes average--with the four featured athletes)
*Special Thanks and Credits
*Resources (links to helpful web sites)
*Replay Introduction

""Workouts"" opens a submenu offering options for Strength, Cardio, Getup, and Balance Workouts.  I have described each of these in greater detail below.

STRENGTH WORKOUT

The 45-minute Strength Workout consists of a 10.5-minute joint mobility warm-up, a 6-5 minute cool-down stretch (note: the warm-up/cool-down are the same for the Strength and Cardio Workouts), and six strength-training rounds.  During each round, Du Cane coaches 30 minute intervals with rest periods in-between (about 2 minutes total); the four athletes display various modifications.  The rounds are as follows:

Round 1=Deadlift and Plank
Round 2=Suitcase Deadlift and Kettlebell Carry (Farmer's Walks)
Round 3=Presses
Round 4=Squats
Round 5=Single Leg Deadlift with Kettlebell Carry (overhead option)
Round 6=Russian Twists

CARDIO WORKOUT

As noted above, the 46.5-minute Cardio Workout includes the same joint mobility warm-up and cool-down stretch featured in the Strength Workout.  Again, the workout is performed in rounds, this time with eight total rounds and with a strong emphasis on kettlebell swings (the athletes vary in performing two-handed swings, one-armed swings, and hand-to-hand swings).  The rounds for the Cardio Workout are as follows:

Round 1=Deadlifts
Round 2=Swings (follows a pyramid pattern of 15-20-30 seconds, 30-20-15 seconds)
Round 3=Kettlebell Carry (overhead option)
Round 4=Swings (same pyramid pattern)
Round 5=Squats
Round 6=Swings (same pyramid pattern)
Round 7=Russian Twists
Round 8=Squats

SPECIAL GETUP SECTION

In this 11.5 minute segment, Du Cane thoroughly and completely breaks down the Turkish Getup move.  She provides extremely detailed instruction, beginning by performing the move without the kettlebell and then progressing to placing a shoe over the hand.  The short Getup Workout is 3 minutes long.

SPECIAL BALANCE SECTION

In this brief (2 minutes) segment, Du Cane has her athletes practice balancing on one leg, both with and without a kettlebell for increased challenge.

Given that I am in my early 40s, I am a bit younger than the intended ""Boomer"" audience for this DVD.  Also, I am an intermediate-to-advanced exerciser, although I am still fairly new to kettlebells (have been using them for about 3 months now).  Despite these factors, when I followed along with Richard--who generally showed the intermediate-to-advanced level modifications, sometimes even using two kettlebells--I was definitely challenged by the workouts on this DVD.  On the other hand, given both Du Cane's excellent instruction and the useful modifications shown by the athlete models, I think that Kettlebell Boomer would be completely appropriate for someone brand-new to kettlebells, young or old.  Du Cane has certainly created a program that is particularly well-suited to older adults, but I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone, regardless of age.",1324339200,40,4638,5.953242835595777
4556227,5,B00540URU4,This is a great product for every boomer.  As you age you need to work to keep muscle.  This product gives a safe way to gain strength no matter where you start.  Pick your own level to start at and gain strength for life.,1323475200,4,222,4.0
4556228,5,B00540URU4,"I purchased this video in order to begin working with kettlebells again after recovering from a back injury. I felt that, since this video was targeting the more mature audience, there might be more of a concern for using the kettlebell in a cautious and safe manner. I was absolutely right! After injuring my back 2 years ago, I thought I would never be able to use kettlebells again. All previous attempts to use them met with failure. By using this video and proceeding carefully, I have been able to resume regular kettlebell workouts. I have been extremely happy with this video, using it twice each week for the last 5 months, in addition to other kettlebell videos I have. It is never boring and is a vigorous workout that will make you sweat. I consider it an essential part of my back rehabilitation program and highly recommend it!",1321056000,26,841,4.651006711409396
4556229,1,B00540URU4,"At this exorbitant price I expected a lot more. This is the most boring exercise video I have ever seen, and I would never be able to watch it more than once. None of the kettlebell exercises that I was interested in were even used in this video. I got far more out of Jordan Rubin's ""Perfect Weight"" exercise DVD that I got free, and also various kettlebell videos on YouTube. I returned this DVD right away, but check out Amazon's return policy!! Once you open it to see what junk it is, they will only refund 50% of the price and also charge for shipping. My refund on the 39.95 total was only 16.99, so it cost me 22.96 to waste my time watching this once and sending it back.",1313539200,7,680,4.198473282442748
4556230,4,B00540URU4,This DVD is a good workout for the average person over fifty years of age to get started with kettlebell exercises.  The instructor provides as much instruction that is possible in a DVD.  She provides instruction to demonstrate good technique to keep one from injury.  Well worth the money.,1311033600,16,291,4.8979591836734695
8456069,5,B00540URU4,"As physical therapist with 22 years of experience and even more years of strength and conditioning experience, I highly recommend this DVD, especially for those who are new to kettlbells, regardless of their age.  This DVD covers basic warm up, kettlebell exercise technique instruction for strength, cardio, balance, and Turkish Get Up as well as cool down.  I really appreciate that four levels of difficulty are provided for each exercise, allowing people of all abilities to benefit from the workouts.

 I like this DVD well enough to recommend it to friends, family and patients.  The companion book ""The Ageless Body"" is also an excellent resource.",1489190400,2,654,5.190476190476191

8456072,5,B00540URU4,"I've been doing my Kettlebell Boomer cardio workout 3x week for the last 3 weeks with a 7 lb kettlebell. I can feel my jeans are looser, mostly in the thigh and butt area. My stomach is a bit flatter. I am 57 yrs old. This workout is made for those of us who are still active and want to try something new, to be more challenged you just go up on your weight. Watch the instructional parts, especially if  you have no experience with kettlebells.",1446768000,,446,4.186046511627907
8456073,5,B00540URU4,Love all the premixes. Play your own music though as there isn't any.,1435104000,,69,4.384615384615385
8456074,4,B00540URU4,"This is a great intro for anyone, but especially those of us older than average.  I'm only a few weeks into this work out, but that's further than any other workout lately.  After years of taking care of others and letting my own health deteriorate, I need to build back up.  This work out is common sense with practical strength-building as it relates to every day life--carrying groceries, controlled sitting and standing movements, picking-up and reaching for things.  All the sorts abilities that my mother slowly lost as she aged.

I started out going through the training/intros a couple times.  Then did just part of the strength building section, working up to the whole section.  Now I'm slowly adding in the cardio workout.  That core strength section is so important though, I can tell that is what my body really needs at this point to be able to move on to other activities.  I did get Du Cane's book too, and the DVD and book work nicely together.

I hate going to a gym and using focused machines and exercises.  It's boring and that's not how we move in real life. The efficiency of the kettlebell exercises just makes sense.  I also really like the athletes in the video--those are people and bodies that as a 50-something can relate to and they move in ways I can imagine doing myself some day!",1415923200,3,1312,4.607758620689655
8456075,5,B00540URU4,I was trying to do kettlebells by just checking online. This DVD gives good and detailed instructions. I use it every day.,1400544000,,122,4.590909090909091
8456076,2,B00540URU4,"I was very disappointed in this DVD.  When learning about kettlebells, I was excited to find what looked like an interesting and motivating way to exercise, and was looking for some instruction for seniors.  This is so repetitious and boring I don't have any interest in pursuing it.  It's a complete waste of a lot of money.",1373241600,,325,4.666666666666667
8456077,5,B00540URU4,"I am a baby boomer.  But this is a video for anyone just starting out with kettlebells.  It's very through starting with a method to do a self assessment so you can determine what level you should be at.  It then gives beginner, intermediate and advanced levels of exercise.  It does all the basic kettlebell exercises.  It's just a great place to start or to stop.  I haven't bothered to continue learning more because I found this is all I need.  The strength and cardio workouts are what I continue to use when I'm doing kettlebell work.",1369526400,3,540,4.505154639175258
8456078,5,B00540URU4,I just started doing kettlebell workouts and I love these workouts. I started by alternating between the strength building workout one day and the cardio workout the next. I am now doing both workouts together. I really like that there are different levels to choose from. You can start with beginner and work up or start with the more advanced if you are in better shape. I really reccommend this workout for older people who want to start a workout.,1366502400,2,451,4.65
