8160476,5,B000LAZE32,This video gives a brief but rich history of Mary in artwork throughout the ages along with some miraculous occurances associated with devotion to Her. Jesus does not violate the commandments so He honors his mother in a very special way! I highly reccomend this video!,1373328000,2,269,4.869565217391305
8160477,5,B000LAZE32,"This DVD is very well put together. The icons and other artwork are well displayed. There is a sense of ""how did they do that?"" on many items. The Pieta in St. Peters is seen behind the glass,etc. Well presented by Jane Seymore.",1356912000,2,228,4.325581395348837

8160480,5,B000LAZE32,"As the title suggest, Picturing Mary is a film about the depiction of the Virgin Mary in various art forms specially in paintings, frescoes, etchings, and sculptures.  While, the first half of the film is centered on European Cathedrals (Istanbul, Rome, Sienna, Venice, etc.), the later part takes you to Africa (Ethiopia) and Southern America, where the depiction of the Virgin Mother of God is just as exquisite and elaborate, if lesser seen and appreciated.  Major work by Duccio, Michelangelo, Rembrandt, and other named and unnamed masters are shown.

The narration by Jane Seymour is great, but the script can jump from one topic to another too quickly.  Its 57 minutes runtime seems too short, but the art shown is top notch and the filmmography great.  Every frame is sharp and flawless.

Unlike 'The Face', which covers the depiction of Jesus Christ in art with a much deeper perspective, 'Picturing Mary' is more content with just showing the exquisite depiction of the Virgin Mother of God alone (ie less commentary).

As stated, it a bit on the short side, but I feel the chance to see these great art is worth the price of admission.  This is a film on Catholic faith, and this review is written and rated by a Catholic.  So be guided accordingly...",1172793600,20,1262,4.805555555555555
