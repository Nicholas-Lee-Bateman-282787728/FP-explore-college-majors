4493874,5,B004XC5LO6,"I'm a big fan of outsider art.  For me, this outr genre is best defined as something made by an amateur that attempts to pass as art yet is widely recognized as primitive and unskilled in the normal definitions of what we deem ""art"" --yet still holds a strong fascination.

However it may be defined, Edward Davis Wood, Jr., (1924 - 1978) both personally and professionally, remains a giant in the outsider world.

Wood's unexpected back-story does not immediately resonate with his film career.  His father was a Poughkeepsie, NY, mailman and his mother so wanted a girl she dressed little Ed as such until he was 12 or so.  When he was 17, he enlisted in the Marines and claimed to be among the 300 survivors (from 4000 Marines) of the November 1943, massacre at Tarawa in the South Pacific Theater, one of the most brutal in US Marine history.  He said he fought while wearing a bra and panties beneath his uniform.

Wood was wounded in his leg and badly scarred.  By war's end, he was missing several teeth.  He joined a carnival and his injuries made him a perfect candidate to perform in the carnival freak show as a geek.

Wood was always drawn toward performance.  In a way, his life was his canvas.  For most of his adult life, he was a confident, creative, cross-dressing heterosexual.  In Hollywood of the 1950s, he became a producer, director, writer editor and actor by default.  At night he wrote quirky pulp fiction novels that were actually published!

Why five stars?  Because here we are still talking about Ed Wood and his unlikely films of little merit.  That's because this outsider made his mark and somehow it is more than an indelible stain on our ever morphing pop-culture landscape of ephemera.  It is a fitting epitaph -- or perhaps merely the residue? -- of our all too brief existence.

That this man loved movies is a given.  That he had no perceptible skill as a filmmaker was irrelevant.  But that didn't stop him from getting his films made and today his films remain fascinating for their consistently crude, ragged often laughably inept ""look.""

If there's a theme that ties all his work together, it is this:  Do what you love.  The message is the fact that the movies exist at all.  No doubt some university course offers a class in the ""Filmic Oeuvre of Edward Wood, Jr.""  Not convinced?  Check out Rudolph Grey's 1992 restorative, laudatory biography Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood, Jr.

S'more Entertainment has just put together a package of 13 of the master's films on six discs.  That's 17 hours of dubious yet strangely compelling entertainment.

Included of course is his signature, now certifiably iconic film, PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE with horror icon Bela Lugosi captured in all the sad, poignant glory of his declining years.  But on screen, he still weirdly mesmerizes.

Additional titles in the set include:  BRIDE OF THE MONSTER, JAIL BAIT, VIOLENT YEARS, SINISTER URGE, FUGITIVE GIRLS, DROP OUT WIFE, HOT ICE, SNOW BUNNIE, BEACH BUNNIES, ORGY OF THE DEAD, TRICK SHOOTING WITH KENNE DUNCAN and CROSSROADS AVENGER.  Be warned that many of the films are skewed toward a mature audience and contain nudity, violence and simulated sex.  Missing are the semi-autobiographical GLEN OR GLENDA from 1953 and NIGHT OF THE GHOULS, 1959.

For unknown reasons, I was especially taken by the short film TRICK SHOOTING WITH KENNE DUNCAN.  It stars the Canadian born B-movie villain showing off his revolver skills.

ORGY OF THE DEAD (only the screenplay by Wood) features professional psychic Criswell.  He was a staple of Hollywood the town and I recall seeing him standing bewildered in his underwear and a tattered robe in the front yard his neglected bungalow just off Hollywood Blvd.  His massive mound of disheveled hair blowing in the morning breeze like an undulating fog bank.  I thought he looked kind of like Einstein on a bad day.

Criswell was a perfect actor for Wood, as was the dying Lugosi because Wood's films at their best captured the ephemera of Hollywood as an imaginary but disturbingly seedy under the tinsel vortex in time and space.  Wood knew its soul was only a succession of dancing shadows that conjure fragments of the vast spectrum of story-telling skills that seduce and hold us captive.  Sometimes the disjointed images are remote and inaccessible -- ambiguous and devoid of meaning.  And other times their blunt crudity jolts with a visceral power to shock -- or invoke mockery.  Either way, these fleeting forms have done their job.  And like it or not, they remain shimmering at the edge of our collective awareness as a reminder how potent is the desire to be creative -- in spite of any discernible talent.

Johnny Depp's portrayal of Wood in Tim Burton's 1994 affectionate tribute beautifully captures the energy and enthusiasm of Wood, who it is said remained true to his weird inner vision up to the very end.  For Wood, the audience didn't really matter and certainly not the critics.  He did it for himself.  And he got away with it.  No irony, no tongue in cheek, no parody - just pure cinema.  It boggles the mind what Wood could have done with a cheap digital camera and iMovie.

The boxed set features terrific extras including an interview with Wood's widow, Bela Lugosi hyping his next Wood project on the day he's released from drug rehab, color home films from the set of ORGY OF THE DEAD, and more.

If you need more Wood, and you know you do, look for his lurid pulp fiction paperback thriller ""Killer in Drag.""",1311638400,30,5528,4.743966421825813

The nearly 17 hours on 6 DVDs in this set feature six of Eddie's later SCRIPTS, as he rarely directed after 1960, including two ""Bunnies"" films that make their DVD debut here. Of these 11 features, Wood wrote and directed only JAIL BAIT, BRIDE OF THE MONSTER, THE SINISTER URGE and PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.

""Trick Shooting with Kenne Duncan"" is a one-man short starring the Canadian-born 'B' western and movie serial bad guy, showing off his skills with a pistol. Duncan is also the other (nameless) sergeant in the sidewalk scene from the Abbott & Costello comedy, BUCK PRIVATES (1941).

Duncan has a bit role in Ed's unsold TV pilot for ""The Adventures of the Tucson Kid,"" a series that would've featured 1930s 'B' western stars Tom Keene and Tom Tyler. (Wood appears in this 25 minute film as a Pony Express rider.)

Apostolof claims Wood had literally nothing to do with the making of. This movie is also in the public domain so it wouldn't have cost much to include here. The movie's credits mistake this movie with Mad Doctor of Blood Island by Eddie Romero and starring John Ashley but neither had anything to do with the movie (actually it's directed by Norman Thomson and stars James Craig) and that might be why it gets blown off.

SO...as a MAJOR LEAGUE Ed Wood fan, given the current state of availability of his classic films, my recommendation is to buy the Big Box Of Wood, plus the Image Entertainment DVDs of ""Plan Nine"" and ""Glen Or Glenda,"" and...if you want everything in ""The Ed Wood Box,""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Haunted-World-of-Edward-D-Wood-Jr/dp/B0000648Y1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Haunted World of Edward D.

8446678,5,B004XC5LO6,"While most Edward D. Wood Jr. fans will already own several of the titles in this 6-disc, 13-title collection by S'more Entertainment, this release is the first career-spanning box set done on Ed Wood, and important for the three previously unissued (on dvd) films as well as the great bonus features. ""The Snow Bunnies"", ""The Beach Bunnies"" and the last film worked on by Ed - and, it should be noted, the final film directed by his frequent collaborator Steve Apostolof - ""Hot Ice"", are more than worth the price of the box and are essential for all serious fans of Wood, Apostolof and perhaps exploitation film in general. Wood's lesser-seen 1960 film ""The Sinister Urge"" is also included.

Among the bonus features are '90's-vintage interviews with Apostolof, director Joseph Robertson, Kathy Wood and Dolores Fuller, along with two excellent commentary tracks by Ted Newsom (who also introduces each film) and filmmaker David DeCoteau (""Puppet Master: Axis of Evil"", etc.) for ""Bride of The Monster"" and ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"".

8446680,2,B004XC5LO6,"bluntreview (dot) com says: A Big Box of Wood is not for kids...in case you missed the collection's disclaimer about simulated sex that shows on the sealed box's sticker; the art would not lead you to beware for those innocent kid eyes searching for more of director Ed Wood's wonders of celluloid.

Though, I read the warning and still went, ""Huh? Is that a joke?"" Um, no. The title is still great for this set. They've managed to make a platonic mnage  trois of word play: Wood the director, wood the standard erect penis reference, and wood the movement of the really bad films. Brilliant.

Many you of probably do not know (hell I didn't) Ed Wood, after that fluffy snapshot handed to us by Tim Burton showing a gosh-golly ne'er do well director and his heartfelt attempts at independent ultra-low-budget films, went into the world of porn for his moola. He wrote porn ""novels,"" and porn scripts - and some borderline sex infused hot messes. Here you'll get six discs worth - well and a couple askew family friendly bits.

This set is hilarious for all the wrong reasons again. For the later more basic porn releases, I picture Travis Bickle from Schrader and Scorsese's brilliant Taxi Driver watching these bad continuity ridden soft porns off Broadway in his would-be-if-he-had-been hey day.

There are a couple old known Wood films (the really famous one played up on the box art), and then the fore-mentioned heaping helping of bad porn and general wastes of film stock and light.

It's Ed Wood porn - that kind of says it all. Though he did not direct most of the ""work"" here...he could have! The collection would be a hoot if the sex wasn't so - well - wooden and the stories so so so bad. No one watches porn for the story...now think ""What if Ed Wood scripted the wookawookmowmow?"" And you'll get my point. It's fun to a point - right before your head starts to twist into its own very uncomfortable point and begins to wander towards anything else it could be engaged in.

One really clunky porn that sticks out is The Snow Bunnies. As expected the straight-off-the-casting-couch girls are pretty and can not act. But the men chosen as the protruding parts are mega-creepy. Now again, it's soft porn - not a belle-of-the-red-carpet chick flick material but could they not find even a semi-looker desperate for work? If to just look at while the up-and-down motion is happening would have made this gal more apt to watch all the way through instead of the FF button working double time. And, the sex you are privy to is like it is choreographed by a maybe had sex once on beer teenager who gets a camera and a few adults that are willing to be filmed, not that they themselves are very ""knowing"" in the field of fornicationary frolic. The edited in ski scenes look like they come from a resort elsewhere, and are used as filler film - a lot. The ""film"" is probably ten minutes if you cut the generic fun in the snow family resort sequences.

Eh. Honestly, the best part of the collection is the appropriately bad audio'd commentaries prior to each movie's start. It's another look at Ed Wood.

So, if you need your film history rounded, or you dig old bad porn? Yes. Get this. But do not buy for your younger family members who still think Ed Wood was Johnny Depp and his wacky gang of misfits...Let their little sugar plum dreams remain.

Snack recommendation: Nausea medicine, or stale week-old popcorn and a box of Kleenex.
