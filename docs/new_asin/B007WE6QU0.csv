8522530,5,B007WE6QU0,"John Coltrane performing, ""A Love Supreme"" with his band. What more needs to be said? As far as the audio and video quality goes, it's as good as can be expected, considering when it was captured. It's a piece of music history of the highest magnitude, and a must for any collector who appreciates instrumental jazz from this era.",1483056000,3,330,4.610169491525424
8522531,5,B007WE6QU0,Real good video and quality of sound. It makes a big difference between just hearing this great music on a record or CD and seeing and hearing the music at the same time.,1480032000,,170,4.181818181818182
8522532,5,B007WE6QU0,Any footage of John Coltrane is priceless. A true Master. The band is Fantastic.,1455580800,2,80,4.785714285714286
8522533,5,B007WE6QU0,"The Love Supreme suite was only played once live, and this DVD includes the surviving video segment of that performance (the complete performance can be found on the deluxe CD version of A Love Supreme, along with some outtakes). Only Part 1 and the beginning of Part 2 are on the video, but the quality is very good and as the credits roll the audio of Part 2 continues for a fair portion of Trane's solo. Also included is the full performance from the following day, again in good quality (much better than has previously been available from this show). Any performance of this quartet from 1965 is going to be exciting, and this is no exception. Thanks to the producers for making this available!",1373068800,6,699,4.6
8522534,5,B007WE6QU0,"As until recently only sections of these concerts were known to exist and circulated (and still do, some in quasi bootleg form with ""Ascension"" mislabelled as ""Blue Waltz"", avoid them, this is the real thing)its great to see as close to as much of the full concert (some is believed to have been permanently lost in a fire in the studio) that remains be remastered and officially released. The entirety of audio of the full concerts can be found at:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Love-Supreme/dp/B00006K06N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Love Supreme</a>&nbsp;and:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Complete-Concerts-Live-in-France-July-27-28-1965/dp/B001TCHETS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Complete Concerts Live in France July 27/28 1965</a>. Since these are only known recordings (and performances) of these historic albums, this is an essential purchase in regards to live Coltrane.
  The concert itself had a mixed reception from the audience because it was a turning point in the sound of John Coltrane. However ""Ascension"" has a far less radical sound than the studio version (which is in part because the full line up that was on the album is not present (Pharoah Sanders had not yet joined the band which was in transformation).
  The sound quality itself is excellent and also this is sourced from a televised broadcast not audience recording. Thankfully due to ""Jazz Icons"" as well as other labels more historic footage is being released. Depending on the source recording, the majority of Coltrane concerts are worthwhile listening. However, this is a vital recording capturing a change in the direction of jazz itself. Hopefully more like it will be found.",1343088000,12,1747,6.004016064257028
8522535,5,B007WE6QU0,To own a video of Mr. Coltrane is watching the greatest tenor-sax man ever. Live In France is another brilliant performance.,1342656000,5,124,4.9523809523809526
