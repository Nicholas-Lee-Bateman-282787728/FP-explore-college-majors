It does have a lot of information, but some of it was not accurate. Astronomy is a really interesting subject to study, but I decided not to use this to do it. If I want to engage kids, I need to show them amazing pictures and do activities that show just how vast our universe is. This DVD just didn't do any of that.",1428364800,,429,4.180722891566265
7923874,5,B00004UDS1,The cast in the Standard Deviants videos always look like they're having fun and I wonder if the viewer or the cast is enjoying themselves more. Lots of information is provided. My kids and I have enjoyed all of the videos we've watched.,1357689600,,237,4.534883720930233
7923875,5,B00004UDS1,"This subject is well covered in this second installment, going a little past the basic solar system info from before. The humor is just as zany, and the explanations easy to follow. I like this format for research since I write fiction and need to ""check my facts"" lest I commit some sin that will lose me reader credibility. It is also a fun way to expand my learning when PBS is monotonous. What I dislike is the DVD format having interruptions to take quizzes, and having to move fast to bypass the pesky things. the VHS did not have this ""feature"".",1175126400,4,552,4.421568627450981
7923876,5,B00004UDS1,This video is great for anyone who is just baffled by astronomy.  The Standard Deviants really have provided the viewers with great mnemonics and visual devices. These just make learning so much fun!,920678400,8,199,5.03030303030303
