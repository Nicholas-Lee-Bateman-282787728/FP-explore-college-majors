7881899,5,6305074429,"I love this film.  I am in one scene along with my dad who is ill.  I love the outcome of course, but I love even more seeing my dad healthy and yelling boo when Dallas scores.
Would love to see this in DVD",1069804800,2,206,3.659090909090909
7881900,4,6305074429,"Reliving the magic of the rise of my all-time favorite team was such a thrill. Especially when you never saw it before. We're not spoiled here in Holland as we only get to see the Euro league games and the Superbowl. And ""The Catch"" by Dwight Clark had caught my imagination for years. Broadcasting was very nostalgic (seventies sound) and the Montana magic was evident.",1021593600,3,370,4.707692307692308

awsome video.",1012089600,,104,4.526315789473684
7881902,5,6305074429,"Jack Buck does a great job on the radio calls. You get to see shots that they filmed, but that you never saw. Things like a five yard run during a drive. These help build up the tension and drama of the game. I hate the  Niners with a passion. But this is very entertaining and well produced  video. I've seen this on ESPN, but it had commercials, a sports ticker  below and a Espn logos on it. But this is nice copy which has high  rewatchablilty value.",956880000,6,454,4.125
7881903,5,6305074429,"NFL films has made an excellent tape which gives a nearly play by play recap (with accompanying actual CBS radio audio) of the 1981 NFC Championship at Candlestick Park in which the upstart San Francisco 49ers  defeated ""America's Team,"" the Dallas Cowboys 28-27.  This game  arguably was the birth of the San Francisco 49ers dynasty and the beginning  of the demise of the Cowboys.  The game itself was a tense struggle between  two evenly matched teams until Joe Montana capped an 11 play, 89 yard final  drive with the single most famous play in 49er history, the TD  ""Catch"" to Dwight Clark...The Cowboys responded by threatening to  score in the final minute of the game but the 49er defense stiffened and  forced a fumble by Cowboy QB Danny White which sealed the game...what a  great tape - a treasure for any 49er fan but a bane for any Cowboy fan!!!",912297600,21,858,4.653333333333333
