3421985,1,B0018ZOARK,"A friend suggested this one to me and after viewing around the first 15 minutes I found my finger on fast forward many times.

The film is shot sort of documentary like and if you deleted the wasted footage of falling snow and trees which has really nothing to do with anything in the film.... it will end up being maybe 40 minutes of what this director considers shock horror??
It has the worst effects I have ever seen  .. extremely fake. Also the worst acting ever.
I hope the team of people who made this piece of junk still have day jobs. Don't waste your time or money.",1254873600,5,575,4.26605504587156
3421986,4,B0018ZOARK,"If this depiction of the horrors placed upon civilians by the infamous unit 731 does not shock you, then nothing will.  The filmakers provide one of the most bizarre and brutal films showing the true horrors of a very upsetting event in history.  There were times in this film where I had a hard time watching the action(particularly the cockaroaches in the crotch scene)but I just could not turn off the film which is over 4 hours in legnth. The non-stop torture and brutality shown seems to be what was not shown in the film ---men behind the sun.  This is very extreme and not for the squemish but should be watched by those who want to see something different, gory and based on fact.",1249862400,,688,4.488
3421987,1,B0018ZOARK,"Sorry, but this movie just plain sucks.  Maybe if it were 90 minutes (or even less) it might have worked simply in a sensory overload kind of way.  But in its current 240+ minute state, it's lumbering, pretentious, mind-numbing bore.  That's because it's basically a 240+ minute student film, and most of those are pretentious and mind-numbing at just ten or fifteen minutes.  Terrible acting, sloppy and amateurish special effects, about a half hour of footage of snow falling (if I'm exaggerating it's not by much) and in the end absolutely no point other than an excuse to recreate these horrendous crimes against humanity as an aborted death metal music video.  A worthless pile self-importance and a complete waste of time.",1236816000,9,728,4.983471074380165

3421989,1,B0018ZOARK,"I love Unearthed Films, and I love this director's previous film ""Visions of Suffering"" (even though it's not a 'good' film, it is INSANE).... but really, this is one of the worst films I've ever seen.  Butt-numbingly boring, bumbling, pointless, and stupid. The mix of a decent documentary with a bunch of lame gore effects didn't go well at all and honestly made me question the filmmaker's intentions -- who, exactly, is this film supposed to appeal to? Most gorehounds won't want to watch the documentary part; most people who'd care about the doc won't want to see cockroaches being inserted into a girl's crotch.  There is plenty of gore here, and some of it is mildly effective but really the film's not even about that. I'm not sure what it's supposed to be about or trying to say; it's 4 hours in length (!) and really could've had 3 hours cut to be a lot more effective.  A decent waste of a LOT of time and not much more.  Disappointing.",1230681600,6,948,4.526315789473684
3421990,4,B0018ZOARK,"Just my opinions: First let me say I rate this film an 8.5 out of 10. Philosophy of a Knife is a film like no other. It has been said by other reviewers that it is like a giant music video. In some ways it is. That isn't a bad thing at all. Somebody really needs to contact Nine Inch Nails to get Andrey to do a video for them. The closest film I could even compare this to was the film ""Goodbye Uncle Tom"" (from the makers of Mondo Cane) only because it was part documentary, part reenactment, and part exploitation. Although Andrey probably didn't intend for this to be an modern day exploitation flick, it pretty much is. Although many people who made exploitation films probably weren't going for that at the time that they made their films. I found that the best way to watch this film is in 30 to 45 minute increments. I will admit at times it does drag on, but when you go away and come back it seems new, exciting, and fresh all over again. When I first heard rumors that the film might be cut down from 4 hours, I was passionate about letting the film remain in it's 4 hour entirety. Now after watching, I think it could have been knocked down to 3 and maybe even 2 hours. It would make it easier to recommend to people, because it takes quite a bit of dedication to get through the film. I don't have a short attention span, but let's just say Andrey has a exceptionally long attention span. Every scene should remain in the film, but many of the scenes contain many redundant shots. In some cases, the length of certain gore scenes make it lose it some of it's potency. However, I must say, the EFFECTS in this film are pretty much outstanding. Although, I wasn't a fan of the ""old vintage film"" effect used throughout the entire film (with the little lines and stuff). It wouldn't have been that big of deal if the effect wasn't still used on still-shots of photos or in the scenes with modern footage. It even used the effect on top of already ""old vintage footage"", making it ""double vintage footage"". I wish they had interviewed more people to give their opinions and views on Unit 731. For a documentary it's always nice to get many perspectives. Despite, the flaws I listed, this film is one of the best independent films to come out in years. The music done by Alexander Shevchenko in the film is top notch and can stand on it's own. It's good to buy the 2 Disc Special Edition so you can have all the music. Some of the most powerful scenes in my opinion were the ""frost bite testing"" when the guy is made to walk, and the scene towards the end with the Japanese solider letting the girl go. (very beautiful scene). It's a visual masterpiece. If you took all the best parts of this film, it would still be longer and better than all the ""extreme"" movies nowadays. If ""extreme"" was a genre, this would be one of it's crown jewels.",1218499200,4,2848,4.315298507462686

This Movie is going to Shock you,with everything that went on at Unit 731,The Director (Andrey Iskanov) did a Great job at Researching for this Project,Research that took him 4 years. Gaining Quite bit of Info of History to make a Succesful Movie. although the movie has a lot of History of what happend ect. the movie still doesnt (Tell ALL) of what happend. Movie could have been 30 minutes longer

USA did take the Info/documents from Unit 731.in exchange for amnesty to the (Doctors,soldiers) ect. i wish they could have gone into little more depth on that...

The way the director filmed the movie was great,with an old look,black/white,cigaret burns/lines ect.. really added to the viewing pleasure! The Actors did a good job at being believable,as well as the prisoners, The Music Score was Great! (the special Effects,Make-up,Sounds,Location's,) were all really Great as Well!!!

3421992,3,B0018ZOARK,"Philosophy of a Knife (Andrey Iskanov, 2008)

For twenty years, a debate has raged over the title of most extreme gore film. While you'll have your classicists arguing for Cannibal Ferox and the like, the real discussion boils down to two films: Hideshi Hino's sixty-minute masterpiece Flower of Flesh and Blood and T. F. Mous' infamous started-as-a-documentary-and-turned-into-a-gore-film Men Behind the Sun. Now, MbtS is twenty years old, FoFaB twenty-three; you'd think by now someone would have pushed the envelope a bit. But those two movies are like the Whitehouse and Sutcliffe Jugend of filmdom; sometimes people get close, but no one ever seems to spill over into unknown territory. There are some envelopes that are, seemingly, made of titanium. The latest chap to try is Andrey Iskanov, whose Nails made me think we might be seeing the first truly boundary-battering Russian director since Tarkovsky; with Philosophy of a Knife, he decided to take what Mous was originally going to do and integrate it with what Mous finally did, creating what the horror underground have been calling a ""goreumentary"" ever since buzz started flying about this movie a year or so ago. And with a projected running time of over four hours (the released version does, in fact, clock in at four hours and nine minutes, excluding the intermission), a bunch of us believed it was time for Mous and Hino to step aside and acknowledge the new master. Well, now I've seen it. Mous and Hino are resting safely on their laurels.

It's tough to talk about directorial style when you're reviewing a documentary, so I'm not even going to try, except to mention that in the gore-film bits, all the wonderful stylistic quirks that made Nails (and, to a lesser extent, Visions of Suffering) such a treat are absent; I assume that's to keep the film's documentary look-and-feel. I missed them greatly, especially as it seemed to me that some more personal touches from Iskanov might have invested us a great deal more in what was going on; Mous achieves the shock and nausea he does in Men Behind the Sun specifically because he's got himself a storyline and some pretty solid characters, while Iskanov is more interested in depicting the horrors of Unit 731 in a more impressionist style. (There is one undercurrent of a storyline, actually; it involves what seems to be the growing feelings of a male nurse for one of the maruta. And it should come as no surprise that the resolution of that storyline, despite being one of the quietest scenes in the film, is also the strongest.) As a result, while there can be no doubt whatsoever that when you use a metric of gallons of fake blood and innards per hour, Iskanov probably has, in fact, created one of the most violent films I've ever seen, but the gore sequences never get under that barrier of detachment. There's no real effect to them, other than saying ""hmm, interesting use of special effects."" Also, a number of scenes seem designed more for shock value than anything else (though the documentary half of the film assures us that yes, these things really did happen), which took away from the movie somewhat. It should be noted, again, that the scenes obviously designed for shock value in Men Behind the Sun did not have this effect; i.e., they actually did shock, despite being far less explicit in most cases. I should also point out the soundtrack, which worked very well for a film like Nails, but constantly feels out of place here.

Still, I don't want to give the impression that this is a bad film. It's certainly the most comprehensive treatment of Unit 731 we've seen on screen, thanks in no small part to its epic run time, and that alone makes it a valuable document. And while I know Iskanov and crew spent four years on the project, it does seem as if one more rewrite of the script, to further integrate the gore-film aspects and give us some characters with whom we could empathize, would have done a great service to the finished product. ***",1216339200,20,3997,4.773121387283237
3421993,5,B0018ZOARK,"let me start this review by stating i worked almost 5 years in a hospital emergency room and a medical university. everything in this artistic documentary is true... not one part of this movie lies in anyway! now, with that said... let me add that hospitals and medical schools do serve and train people to serve the wefare of all people, and the vast majority of people in the medical field enter the profession to be of service to others' in need. there were those few (and, i mean very, very few!) people in the profession who loved having and abusing their power over others. as a minister and psychotherapist i have spent my life studying this question: 'what makes people either act in evil ways and/or become evil and, still claim they are good, moral people?' i learned about this early in my life, seeing people around me abusing the authority they had over me. i enter the ministry and psychology to help find ways to help others' and make the world a better place for us all.i did not talk here about my early life just to talk about my early life. i wanted to show that i do know what i am talking about. philosophy of a knife is a jounery through hell! andrey iskanov and victor silkin more then deserve the highest praise for this fine educational  documentary. the historical guest  anatoliy protasov is most enlighting of russian/sovite history during the timeline of world war 2 and unit 731 since, he live in the area around unit 731 during the japanese occupation.debbie rochons interview of manoush (who narrated this documentary) was quite bad. ms. rochon is one fine actress, but interviewing like acting is a set of skills that need to be learned and, poor ms. rochon was out of her area as an interviewer. manoush was somewhat out of it herself, and not much into the interview which, made ms. rochons' job all the harder.alexander shevchenko did one great job of putting together one very, very fine soundtrack and, the bands that added to the soundtrack did one fine job too!

Some of the most horrific things you can not just make up. Unit 731 is one of them. Andrey Iskanov, Manoush, and I decided to collaborate on the music video for Dead Before born and when Andrey sent us some of the raw footage for Manoush to work on, I was so blown away and inspired.

3421995,5,B0018ZOARK,"Very few movies entertain in a highly original format. The director isn't scared to show true human nature. The modern world is often called desinsitized, if thats so why does war affect our soldiers. This movie portrays the pain and sufferring in a realistic fashion. Although, the effects could have been better most of them are 100 % believable. I often forgot I was watrching a reenactment. These types of experiments and tourture go on everyday in this world. We choose to watch our pretend horror movies with a happy ending. Happy Endings do not exsist, they are temporary moments of pleasure often followed by extreme pain.

This movie show the reality of man. man will do anything to climb the ladder of power and respect. If a bum tells you to hold the door for a lady you say ""no"", even though its in your value set. If you boss orders you to kill someone to become CEO of a fortune 500 company, you do so withput hisitation.

This films bears the two sides of the human soul, the predator and the prey prey, the weak versus the strong, the rich versus the poor, the powerful versus the powerless.

These types of acts happen everyday in the world on a mass scale and we do nothing to stop it, aren't we just as guilty as those whose hands commit the crime?",1293148800,2,1267,4.452586206896552

3421997,3,B0018ZOARK,"I bought this DVD knowing full well that it would not be easy to watch, but little did I know the real reason why. The film is several hours long, four hours to be exact. On the good side of things, the angles and lenses used are artistic and unsettling. I know that sounds like a pretty bland explanation, but the camera work is quite good. That is about the only good thing about the movie really. While watching it, I got that feeling that a lot of other movies had borrowed some of its better elements since its release in 08...or maybe it's the other way around. Who knows? Who cares? Gore porn gets boring to this desensitized soul after an hour or two so the film lost much of its appeal. Even the stark reality of the Unit 731 experiments on which the film is based cannot save it after the third hour of seeing a man ""microwaved"" on a micro film budget. The actors and effects are not good enough to convey such an atrocity but I commend the effort. My advice to those out there looking for something REALLY messed up, go watch ""Flower of Flesh and Blood.""

3421998,5,B0018ZOARK,"PHILOSOPHY OF A KNIFE is not simply a horror / splatter / gore movie. It's not meant to be enjoyed as entertainment, or viewed as exploitation. This is a documentary by Andrey Iskanov about the infamous UNIT 731, and the inhuman experiments conducted there during WW2. The horrific, insanely-extreme sequences in PHILOSOPHY are re-enactments, much like in any other documentary presentation. The major difference of course, is that Iskanov recreates the actual atrocities in as realistic, vicious, and detailed a fashion as possible. We are meant to go along w/ these prisoners / test subjects as they encounter their long, hideous deaths. We are supposed to experience the terror, the anguish, the torturous, mindless experimentation. We are there for the monotony of murder. We are witnesses to one of the world's darkest criminal endeavors. After seeing POAK, I am convinced, as never before, that human beings are capable of anything. Anything. One of the most chilling aspects of this film is the voice-over by Manoush, portraying a nurse at UNIT 731. She absolutely gets the idea across that in order to be a part of acts such as these, she had to forfeit her very soul.

3422001,5,B0018ZOARK,"So few films really leave a lasting impression.  Even rarer is the film that will snatch the breath from your lungs and leave you paralyzed in your seat.  If Philosophy of a Knife doesn't leave you shellshocked and numb, nothing will.  This is one of the boldest and most impressive achievements in the history of film.

Part documentary, part horror film, this nightmare inducing visual onslaught combines some gripping archival footage, candid interviews, and disturbing reenactments of chemical/radiation experiments performed by the Japanese Army Unit 731 in the 30's and 40's.

This is not a fun film to watch by any means.  Shot mainly in black and white, POTK is a grueling, 4&1/2 hour history lesson.  The vivid, deranged terror will strike you deeper than any fictional horror film ever could.  Besides the melting of flesh and ripping bodies in half, it also flashes dead fetuses and some torturous surgical procedures including some STD experiments.  Not for the faint of heart.

Much of this is backed by an industrial soundtrack.  Perhaps it feels like an extremely warped and lengthy Nine Inch Nails video.  Such a surreal experience.  Your eyes will be fixated on the set and you will not even notice the time go by.

One horrible realization to try to come to grips with is the fact that these inhumane experiments performed on the victims actually helped advance Japan's medical knowledge way beyond the rest of the world.  The end definitely doesn't justify the means, of course.  But it makes me wonder if instead of capital punishment, maybe forcing hardened criminals to become instruments of science would be a viable option.

Masterfully shot and crafted in 2008 by Russian director Andrey Iskanov, Philosophy of a Knife has to be the most overwhelming, bizarre, wicked, creative, horrific, educational, aesthetically beautiful and heartbreaking experimental projects ever committed to film.

3422004,5,B0018ZOARK,"Woodrow Wilson once said of D.W Griffith's ""Birth of a Nation"" as ""History written with lightning."" If that film is written with lightning then this film is history written with a buzz saw.
Andrey Iskanov has been known for surreal shocking visions in films like Nails and Visions of Suffering both of which I want to see after seeing this film and hope to receive for Christmas and in his latest Philosophy Of a Knife he pushes the viewer to extremes that will leave the viewer disturbed, shaken and most of all wondering how a thing like Unit 731 could have happened.

The Film is a pseudo documentary, footage of historical events and an interview with a military translator are interspersed with the reenactments of the experiments of Unit 731, a Japanese Military unit that specialized in medical experiments. These experiments range from biological warfare to frostbite and decompression experiments and all are shown in full detail. There are scenes in this film that will make you squirm, cover your eyes or maybe throw up. I watched this film in two installments over the course of a week due to this film's over four hour length(It is separated on the DVD so there is no thumbing through chapters to find where you left off) and found myself so shocked that I couldn't do anything for the rest of the nights I watched it. This film will test your limits of how much shock you can stand. If you are a fan of Hostel or the Saw series then do not watch this, their gore is tame compared to this film.
The fact that this unit actually existed is what surprised me and that Douglas MacArthur  let them go after getting their secrets. This film shows primarily Soviet victims but there were plenty of Chinese victims that were a part of these experiments. The blood and disgusting imagery flows like a river. From a woman getting a disease covered cockroach placed inside her vagina to several scenes of abortions and organs being removed.

If you are daring then try this movie and try to sit through it in one siting if you have the time. I also suggest buying the limited edition for the DVD ROM Extra of having the entire film score on your MP3 Player or computer.

8271456,2,B0018ZOARK,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Philosophy of a Knife""

1. Unit 731 is the notorious WWII prison camp run by the Japanese army, and which was responsible for some of the worst war crimes carried out by that nation. Most of the victims were Chinese. In 1988, China made a movie that graphically depicted the activities of that unit. It was called ""Men Behind the Sun"", and is one of the few movies that I may never watch again. History only needs one of these movies.

2. In 2008, Russian filmmaker Andrey Iskanov decided to make his own version of the events that happened an Unit 731. It's a mix of archival footage, ""interviews"", bad history recreated in black-and-white, and stupidly graphic, grotesquely pointless torture scenes.

3. In one of the most pretentious interviews I've ever seen, before the film Iskanov admits that he filmed his interpretation of the idea, but the movie isn't historically accurate. This is called ""stating the obvious.""

4. The version I saw was 4 hours and 20 minutes long. This is because almost every single scene was twice as long as it needed to be.

5. The only thing I can call this is an art film. Sometimes it feels like a 13-year-old tried to make their own Nine Inch Nails music video. Sometimes it uses camera techniques similar to ones in the cult film Tetsuo: The Iron Man. Almost every woman in the movie, whether prisoner or camp worker, looks like a model. Sometimes they would strike a pose, like they were in a Madonna video. None of them showed much emotion, no matter what was going on.

6. Iskanov dedicated so much camera time to every little detail of the various ""experiments"" that it became ridiculous. Eventually the light bulb came on, and I realized I was not watching some overblown art-horror movie. I was watching Iskanov explore his own bizarre fetishes. The movie made much more sense to me after that.

At least, that's the only explanation I have for the ""experiment"" where a doctor pushes a giant cockroach into a woman, watches it crawl under her skin, and then rips her face off, lets the cockroach crawl out of the skinless mouth, and then places the face back on the woman before taking a picture.

7. The torture scenes are truly nauseating and brutal. But there's a catch. While the ideas of the experiments were truly horrifying, the way they were depicted were so ""artsy"" and unrealistic, that they diluted their own power. The special effects were so amateur that they took you out of the movie. The human body parts were obviously rubber and chocolate syrup. And the sound effects were overloud and incongruous, or even out of sync; a shirt would be torn open, and the sound of tearing fabric kept going even after the tearing stopped.

8. I watched the first half one night, and the second half the next night. And still I was bludgeoned with so much art-trauma that I became completely numb to it all. And in the ultimate anti-climax, the camp is closed about a half hour before the film ends. The last 30 minutes is some dude in a yellow shirt who tells the most ridiculously boring stories where he makes up what happened in the aftermath of the war.

9. This movie wasn't a complete waste of time. I mean, watching rubber arms and faces get sliced with hatchets was not as unpleasant as watching my own arm get sliced with a hatchet would probably be.

But I also could have done something a lot more fun and valuable with those four hours than to watch this director tell us way too much about what goes on inside his perverted mind.",1460246400,,3518,4.577106518282989

Experimental films are usually more unusual and formless than something like lynchs Eraserhead. Its really not literal entertainment unless you happen to be a serial killer. This reminded me of the Rozz Williams short bootleg film called Pig, an experimental black and white 30 minute film about a serial killer who tortures his victim. Good luck getting a copy of it though. It was released some 16 years ago in limited addition VHS only. In fact I kept thinking of Rozz Williams through this entire film. He would have loved it if he were still alive. In fact the soundtrack for this film would have been better if they had used some of the experimental tracks from Rozzs music projects like Premature Ejaculation or Heltir. His music in this film would have been a better fit. That aside this is not really a documentary. its a visual attack on the senses. An experimental look into sickness done in an experimentally artistic manner with some attempt at serious documentary style film making added in. If you are familiar with people like Rozz, Diamanda Galas, Boyd Rice, Nurse with wound, or Current93- and like what they do, chances are youll probably over all enjoy this. Or if you are not into very avant garde and like weird strangeness like this, or are not familiar with some of the people I have mentioned and their works, chances are youll hate this film. I found it interesting in its sense of dark cyberpunk creationism, but its ultimately for people who are accustomed to experimental film. Others should avoid at all costs.",1367884800,,1652,4.7595818815331015

8271461,2,B0018ZOARK,"This film is a mess unless you mostly want to wallow in filth so that the indeed important message will stick with  you. I'll give it a star or two for that.

The problem for me was that it is an endless onslaught of terrible images and it is never clear which are from archival sources and which are contrived. I wanted to learn more in a good video production about the actual history of the Japanese experiments on human subjects -- Unit 731. I will keep looking for a good video. Right now it looks as though I will be confined to written materials. The Wiki article has a number of references. [...]

I will assume that the story that was narrated in the film was more or less true in its details. They seem to be consistent with other information I have been able to find. Yet the documentation was not for the most part at all clear and any actual photographic evidence was indistinguishable from the faked gore, and there was far to much of that in my opinion. I had to do a lot of fast forwarding because it was hard to stomach, and my stomach is by  no means delicate. It seemed gratuitous and that makes gore hard to stomach by contrast to documentary gore -- that I react to as merely factual.

Here is my suggestion. Fast forward through as much of the gore as you can. Try to catch the bits of narration that have some meat in them. There are long interviews with the Russian translator and it is easy to pick them out and watch them for they are interesting. However I did not think that they were well strung together. Again keep in mind that I was doing a lot of fast-forwarding and may have missed some of the important information about this man and what he actually saw and what he learned from gossip or from translating documents used in the quasi-war trials. My suspicion is that those who made the film were lucky to get their hands on this guy and tried to build a film around his information and wanted to minimize talking-heads and so used a lot of horrific filler. In any event I thought it was weak on contextualizing the Russian translator. Yet if you are scavenging around for information on these experiments you might find some valuable leads here if you have the patience to sift through them.

I confess I would have preferred something closer to a documentary or even a good docudrama. Probably other reviewers like to be emotionally overwhelmed and feel that makes a film highly educational because the message is burned into their memory. I can see that. But, different strokes for different folks.",1353283200,,2536,4.454741379310345
8271462,2,B0018ZOARK,This film is basically a gore film about a fictional Japanese military unit called the Unit 731. It could have been better but they cant all be great. The film Men Behind The Sun is a much better film about the same story. Try it instead.,1344556800,,238,4.195652173913044
8271463,4,B0018ZOARK,"PHILOSOPHY OF A KNIFE is a gruelling experience. It is NOT a factual film. If you are thinking of buying this, in order to gain a history lesson of what really went on at Unit 731, this isn't the film for you, as PHILOSOPHY... contains very little actual facts.

Neither is it a wholly fictional film. Thus, if you are looking for an epic horror film, then again, this is not for you.

What Iskanov offers up is a long, brutal and often disturbing mix of pseudo-documentary/Mondo film, alongside art cinema, complete with enough facts and evidence of some of what went on at Unit 731, and blends them together, into a discordant and powerfully angry one-of-a-kind film.

Yes, it's very, very long - running to just shy of four-and-a-half hours. But that epic, can be watched all in one go, or watched in two halves, as Unearthed Films have also offered the option to watch the film in two shorter segments instead, if you so wish.

The film is gory. It is violent. It is brutal, and disturbing, and unsettling, and tastless, and crass, and insensitive, and every other verb you could use to throw at a shocking film, that deals with one of mankind's worst historical episodes. I also believe that whatever Iskanov's intentions were, this is a film of which there is nothing else like it.

It is simply an experience. You will not enjoy this film. You may not even like this film. What you will do, however, is watch it, experience it, and then question everything you've just sat through.

Other reviewers have complained that it is too long. Maybe it is. I disagree. I don't see why all films should be a maximum of 90-minutes in length. (I get the impression that those that can't sit still for such a long time, are probably the same individuals who have the attention span of a gnat, and need contstant mental stimulation, to stop them from becoming bored. There's always the Pause botton on your DVD remote-control. But that's the ""MTV Generation"" for you, I guess! The same generation that raves over every single, sodding remake of classic horrors, and thinks that only plentiful gore makes a good horror film - they're all wrong!)

There have also been complaints about the scenes involving snowfalls. Well, they are there for a reason. It's to give viewers a moment to breathe. To pause and reflect. To take their mind away from much of the shocking depravity that Iskanov is offering up to you, to consume. Any film with such an extensive running time, and with such an intense theme, would wear out most audiences, if it were full-on and never gave people a break.

Some of PHILOSOPHY... is excellent. Some of it, is deeply pretentious. The acting is varied also - hovering between good and execrable. (Ironically, it is the younger, more modern cast members who are the least effective, and don't seem to care about their roles, or injecting any kind of ""talent"" into the film.)

But whether you believe what you are being fed, by Iskanov, or whether you think he's talking complete garbage, you will certainly come away with realising that what went on during World War 2 were the worst things that any humans have ever performed on other human beings. The film is filled with genuine attrocity footage: a few frames here, a few seconds there. But real footage it is, and that is what makes the whole thing a gruelling experience. Whilst your mind is telling you how some of the effects are done, the film will then jolt you back into reality, and devastate you with genuine, bona-fide footage, that will chill you to the core.

As it should.

As Iskanov and his crew say in the film's Introduction, this is not meant to be an entertaining film. It is not even meant to be a horror film, in the true meaning of the word. It is simply meant to be.

If you're looking for a gore film, then this may satiate you. However, I think those viewers do the film and Iskanov a great disservice. This film is a document. A testimony to how unbeareably cruel human beings can be to one another, if we think about it for long enough.

For that reason, I believe the film is a valid piece of cinema. Not every film has to have a point. Not every film has to justify its raison d'etre. Not every film has to fit in to what every hole we want it too.

Sometimes, like life itself, films can just be what you make of them.

An interesting oddity, but a one-of-a-kind experience that is worth your time and patience.",1344297600,5,4411,4.544766708701135
8271464,5,B0018ZOARK,"As a professional historian who has been researching war atrocities, including Unit 731, I find this film to be a worthless fraud. This is NOT repeat NOT a history of Unit 731 or an accurate portrayal of the atrocities committed there. It is a philosophical expression of the director-producer's artistic view of life, death and in humanity or humanity whichever way you choose to look at it. If I had known what a piece of trash this film was I could have invested my money in a film that would have been useful to me so as the DVD of the Late Iris Chang's The Rape of Nanking or one on Nazi atrocities. It is a lie to say that all of the records of Unit 731 were destroyed and that there is little proof in the way of actual testimony available..the records are in the possession of the Japanese and United States governments as Lt. Gen Dr. Ishii later worked for the United States as a paid advisor to Ft. Detrick, the US Army Chemical-Biological Warfare Center. During the Korean War, the U.S.government at the behest of Gen MacArthur as well as others requested Japan to reconstitute and reactivate Unit 731 combining it with U.S Army Chemical Warfare Service Unit 406 under Col. Mason. The mission of the joint unit was to experiment on North Korean, Chinese and some Russian POWs captured in Korea to enhance our Chemical-Biological Weapons Arsenal. The Russians and Chinese retaliated by using U.S. and U.N. POWs for a simalar purpose. In exchange for their cooperation, the previous amnesty granted to the unit was affirmed and most of the members including Ishii went onto distinguished careers in science, government, education, politics and even law. Because Ishii had sworn all members to absolute secrecy about the Unit's activities(read atrocities) fwew members talked about their experiences until after Emperor Hirohito's death from Cancer in 1989. After his death, a large group of former unit members broke their silence and wrote books or testified about what they knew. If you like LOTS of cute scenes where snow is flying and Russian recording artists are singing strange songs, then this DVD is the one for you:-)! But if you are a serious intellectual as I am, then my advice is to let it alone.",1296259200,5,2219,4.766233766233766
