8505970,1,B006WZ0A3O,"I bet you can't make it through this one. It's a witches brew concocted with a liberal amount of nudity, hard core sex, and scenes of torture. A number of young, slim, and always nude women are incarcerated in an old island fortress. In reality, they do not have cells; instead, they are caged like animals. The female warden is the sickest one of the jailers. She especially likes to drive a dagger through the skulls of what seems like an endless parade of innocents. Here's the thing: although it's unrated, don't kid yourself, this is x-rated fare, but it's not an ordinary sex movie. There is not one instance of tease, and there is no titillation; rather you are served up endless  scenes of unbridled torture and sexual degradation. How bad does this Danish film get? You'll look away if you have a shred of decency as the torture scenes are a little too real. Kudos to the special effects crew. When a sadistic card slices an inmate's breast off, it looks real and her screams of agony sound real enough. Of course, the dramatic tension comes with an attempt to escape the hellhole. Do they end up getting away? I'm afraid you'll  never find out as I guarantee you won't make it to the end of this disgusting flick.",1440374400,,1223,4.529411764705882
