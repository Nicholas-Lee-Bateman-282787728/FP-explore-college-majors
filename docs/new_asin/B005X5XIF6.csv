4900378,5,B005X5XIF6,"""If we win with this team we will have changed the game for good.""  After losing to the Yankees in the 2001 playoffs the Oakland A's begin to get picked apart.  After three of thier best players leave from free agency it is up to GM Billy Bean (Pitt) to field a competitive team.  After meeting Peter Brand (Hill) he sees a new way to field a team.  Using modern technology and math instead of scouting to rate players he signs of team of ""nobodys"".  Being a huge baseball fan I was very much looking forward to this movie, this movie was even better then I was hoping for.  Written by the writers of ""Social Network"" it has roughly the same feel. Watching what a GM goes through on a day by day basis gave me new appreciation for what they do, and to watch Bean struggle with making a team with the lowest payroll in the league to try and compete with teams like the Yankees who have almost 100,000,000 dollars a year more is impressive. The only bad thing I have to say about this movie has nothing to do with the movie itself. Going in I knew enough history about what happened with this team and Beane himself that the tense moments and hard decisions lost some of the effect on me.  But that in no way hurt my enjoyment of the movie, and for those that don't know as much about this it will have the effect it went for.  On a side note Pitt and Hill have the same chemistry that Cloony and Pitt had in the ""Oceans 11"" movies and that makes it more fun to watch.  Overall, one of the best movies about sports (not just baseball) I have ever seen.  There is also enough in this that even if you are not a baseball fan you will still really enjoy this. I give it an A.

Would I watch again? - Absolutly, I want to buy this.

4900379,4,B005X5XIF6,"Brad Pitt (one of the producers, as well as lead actor) and company do a more than adequate job of bringing the story in the book ""Moneyball"" to the silver screen.  But aspects of the story, namely the technical analysis of baseball players and the game of baseball that constitute ""Sabermetrics"", do not necessarily translate well to the action-oriented visual medium of cinema.  ""Moneyball"" the movie is at its best when it shows the impact these somewhat arcane numbers have on people and the action on the field.  But in the final judgment, ""Moneyball"" doesn't quite measure up to the all-time great popular baseball movies of the past couple of decades, a group that includes ""Bull Durham"", ""Field of Dreams"", and ""The Natural"".

Disclaimer:  I read the book ""Moneyball"", and as is the case about 90% of the time for me when I read the book before seeing the movie, I enjoyed the book more than the movie.  Other people I saw the film with had a higher opinion of the movie than I did.

""Sabermetrics"" relies upon statistical analysis of past player performance and game situations to determine the best players to put on the team's roster and the field, and what actions they should do in a game.  The first quarter of the movie, which is when the filmmakers have to explain roughly what ""Sabermetrics"" is and how it works, is slow-paced and mostly consists of conversations, with computer-generated pages of numbers rolling across the screen providing the only action at times.  But what makes ""Moneyball"" compelling is when it focuses on the impact the Sabermetrics philosophy has on the many characters in the film: the players, the team's management and ownership, people outside the game, and ultimately the game of baseball itself.  The film does build to a climatic moment on the field, and does a wonderful job portraying the drama involved in one of the key games played that season.

You don't have to be a serious baseball fan to enjoy ""Moneyball"".  A casual acquaintance with the game is all that is required, since at its core ""Moneyball"" is about human beings and relationships and how they are changed when a new way of thinking comes along.  ""Moneyball"" also illustrates some important lessons of business management, in particular how people react to change.  I recommend it for most, but wouldn't rank it among the all-time great baseball movies.

One other interesting (non-spoiler) aspect of the film: Brad Pitt is now old enough that they had to find a younger, similar-looking actor to portray the early-twenties version of Pitt's character. Evidently the miracles of Hollywood makeup artistry are not enough to make Brad Pitt look like a 20 year-old any more.",1316995200,3,2688,4.889867841409692
4900380,5,B005X5XIF6,"WOW...What a movie!
Brad Pitt and Jonah hill are amazing!

Go watch it!",1316908800,,132,5.285714285714286
4900381,5,B005X5XIF6,"I am not a follower of baseball, although I followed last seasons home town events with interest with the Giants, even watching the final of the World Series for the first time.  Despite my rudimentary knowledge of the game, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

Moneyball tells of how Billy Beane, the Oakland A's general manager played by Brad Pitt, faced with limited resources, and losing some of his star players to the Yankees hires a Yale economics graduate and statistician played by Jonah Hill, and devises a system for buying undervalued players to replace the likes of Giambi, by looking at players in new ways.

It's a calculated risk that flies in the face of conventional wisdom, and met with much resistance on the field, within the club, and from the media.  Suffice to say that previous methods of picking though amusing were highly dubious.

""He has an ugly girlfriend.""

""What does that mean?""

""Ugly girlfriend means he has no confidence.""

Memorable movie lines:

""The problem we're trying to solve is that there are rich teams, and there are poor teams. Then there's 50 feet of crap. And then there's us. It's an unfair game.""

""I hate losing.  I hate losing more than  I love winning.""

The screenplay was written by Aaron Sorkin who created West Wing and won the Best Screenplay Oscar for The Social Network,and slides comfortably home with this effort.

Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the unhappy team coach with whom Beane bumps heads. Robin Wright Penn plays his ex wife, now with a new man who does not follow baseball.

The character of Beane as depicted by Pitt seems somewhat oddball, so one wonders if Beane is really this odd, or if the screenwriter is imposing his own don't  explain philosophy on the character. Brad loves to play with the eccentricites of his characters, whether it's outright craziness as in Twelve Monkeys or a thick accent as in Snatch.  This really makes the movie, as Brad gives one of his best performances.

Even though I don't follow baseball, I do love a great story, and I can relate as a soccer follower, because we share a passion for a game, and can understand the frustration of supporting a team that has to make sacrifices of favorite players, and has less money than the big teams to compete for the same trophies.

So, if you're like me and don't usually follow baseball, I think you will like the movie because it's a good story, and you will love the quirkiness of the characters and their relationships.  In the movie Beane has to make a very big decision, so there was an emotional bit where Beane is in the car by himself at the end, which I liked.  I loved the relationhip with his daughter, and the overall shenanigans as he bumps heads with the other characters.

If you do follow baseball, you will probably enjoy it even more than I did, and I gave it five stars.  I think you will enjoy it, and I hope this was helpful.",1316736000,3,2895,4.6223091976516635

Interesting unfolding of how baseball recruits are underestimated and underpaid, to the detriment of the overpaid baseball club's players.  In comes a guy who is a shabby, looking economist (geek) who finds undiscovered talent.  He does it  by statistical analysis of their early playing, back to amateur playing.  Baseball scouts are looking for five types of talent in a player.  When that combination is found, they have a promising career player.  Statistical analysis uncovers those five talents of unrecognized aspiring players, to give his team a lot of talent for modest financial cost.  The story develops slowly, much like baseball, until we see the influence of statistical analysis (back during the early days of computers).",1511654400,,794,5.296

Nostalgia to the point of bittersweet goosebumps. I wish I could go back to those years of my life if just to experience them once more, and this movie inspires that.

This achievement by the A's was truly historic, and Hatteberg's crush to center/right field may be among the greatest home runs ever hit.  Yes, the A's did not get to the World Series, but a team like this should not be overlooked; it has become a role model in baseball.  This is a true story, chronicling a reinvention of how the game is played; it serves as a life lesson.  No matter how much you think you know something (whatever it is), there is always room to discover more, something that needs to be looked at.  That is why I love the cover picture on the video:  Brad Pitt is looking over his shoulder, very clever.  The movie was done very well; Brad Pitt's performance was excellent.  One of several Pitt performances that have been overlooked, I cannot believe he was not Oscar nominated for ""Moneyball"".

4900467,5,B005X5XIF6,"Moneyball is one of my favorite movies of all time. I've watched it at least 5 times so far and I love it more each time. This is probably my favorite Brad Pitt movie.
Brad Pitt is Billy Beane and Jonah Hill does an outstanding job as the geeky Yale Economics major who helps Billy reinvent the A/s. Together they make the movie.
This is so much more than a sports movie. This adaptation of Michael Lewis's book makes the seemingly dry statistics and ins and outs of major league baseball interesting and almost understandable for the average fan / movie viewer. It is also funny and touching. Don't miss the last scene...his daughter sings ""The Show"" and it will bring you to tears.

That said, the movie failed to mention several all-too-important pieces of the 2002 Oakland Athletics.

4900476,5,B005X5XIF6,"I unintentionally came across this Moneyball movie at the Family Dollar store near where my husband and I live. This film stars Brad Pitt (Rusty Ryan in Oceans Twelve, The Big Short) as Billy Beane, Jonah Hill as Peter Brand an assistant to Billy Beane (I remember Hill most recently from the War Dogs film and Wolf of Wall Street). I admit that I did not know that Chris Pratt (first Guardians of the Galaxy,upcoming Guardians of the Galaxy 2 film etc)played in the film as a baseball player by the name of Scott Hatteberg until after he is introduced as part of the new team that is being assembled. The character of Billy Beane is also shown juggling his professional life while trying to raise his daughter Casey Beane (played by Kerris Dorsey) who he co-parents with his ex-wife Sharon Beane (Robin Wright who also plays in the House of Cards with Kevin Spacey). Of course, there are more actors/actresses who feature in the film and the following are some of the bonus features of the dvd; Blooper-Brad Loses It, Deleted Scenes, Billy Bean Re-Inventing the Game, Moneyball Playing the Game. The end of the film lists that Billy Beane turned down the Red Sox Offer of $12,500,00 and chose to stay in Oakland California. Some of the credits list that Bennet Miller directed the film, Brad Pitt produced Moneyball, and this film is based on the book by Michael Lewis. I am thrilled to say that this is another film that my husband sat with me to watch and also liked.",1489968000,,1470,4.593155893536122

So that ""Moneyball"" must not have worked out too well for him.""  The movie takes it a step too far, I believe.  If he didn't win with it, and hasn't won with it since, what's the point?

4900869,5,B005X5XIF6,"I really enjoyed this movie.  Brad Pitt portrayed every characteristic of Billy Bean that the author of Moneyball talked about.

I didn't even recognize the manager was Phillip Seymour Hoffman until I read the credits (R.I.P.)

Jonah Hill is a great supporting actor.

4900872,4,B005X5XIF6,"The Oakland A's didn't have the financial resources to approach the game the way the Yankees, Red Sox, or Dodgers did. Oakland had a payroll of $39,722,687 to the Yankees $114,457,768 or one-third the budget. Oakland could not afford superstars like Alex Rodriguez, Ken Griffey Jr., and Barry Bonds, players with great athletic ability and tremendous skill. Instead, they found value in players where others didn't see it. They looked at baseball players who had been dismissed as not having enough talent. A mathematical formula, a set of metrics, an objective analysis, was derived to decide how much a man who gets on first base was worth. These guys didn't have the attitudes, pass the eye-candy test, or wasn't as pretty in uniform as some of the other players. But Oakland players such as Chad Bradford, Scott Hatteberg, and David Justice had the skills needed to produce results. In 2002, with the second lowest budget, Oakland won the same number of games the Yankees did with one-third of the resources. Oakland won 20 games in a roll which no American League team had ever done, and they made it into the playoffs.",1462665600,,1124,4.859375
4900873,5,B005X5XIF6,"Great movie, and I was not a huge baseball fan - always loved football, lOVed basketball since Michael Jordan and now the Spurs, and like ice hockey because of the Lightning.  This made me appreciate baseball and turned me into a big fan of it too. Brad Pitt is perfect, as are all the actors.  The story is so fascinating and educational, and true by the way. A movie you can sit down to watch with your children and not be embarrassed by tasteless, gratuitous scenes. It is about the game, with a touch of his relationship with his daughter, and NO love story--how refreshing! You'll learn a lot about what goes on behind the scenes and who really is responsible for the success or failure of a team.",1462492800,,702,4.434108527131783
4900884,4,B005X5XIF6,"It was a good movie.  I didn't like the outcome, but I know it's a true story.  I work with business analytics, so I understand the premise about using statistics to drive business decisions.",1462233600,,191,4.588235294117647

4900886,5,B005X5XIF6,"""Moneyball"" is a sophisticated baseball film about the new statistical methods of Bill James and his school. It is a passionate defense of the Jamesian followers of this century, focusing on Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) of the Oakland Athletics and their extraordinary experiment in low-budget player finance in the early years of this century, when the Athletics, with a budget one-third that of the Yankees, matched them in total victories in 2002 and won a record twenty consecutive games. The writing and acting are superlative, with a fully engaged Pitt playing a divorced father, general manager of the cash-strapped Athletics, who discovers the reticent, intelllectual Pete Brand (Jonah Hill) to mastermind a transition to inexpensive players who nevertheless get on base and score runs. The opposition is represented by manager Art Howe (the great Philip Seymour Hoffman), an old-school baseball man who scoffs at his bosses in the front office and wins in spite of himself with the roster they provide him with. Pitt's twelve-year-old daughter fears he will lose his job, but he proves himself in the end.  I loved it.",1462147200,,1122,5.164835164835165

4900926,5,B005X5XIF6,"This movie is not about baseball.  It is fun business strategy lessons.
Last Friday I completed a corporate ""Strategic Planning Baseline"" course.  This movie was recommended as the model of culture change in baseball where statistics and facts is how you win in business.  Not with emotional decision making.  Also, the upper management needs to know who there workers are and trust them.  weed out the negatives.

This movie was exceptionally entertaining after this course which I understood so much more than the baseball.",1460246400,,525,5.190476190476191

4900929,5,B005X5XIF6,"Let me start by saying that I am not a Baseball fan, in any way at all. I honestly can't stand the sport, and the BS politics & crooks that rule it. However, Moneyball is one of my favorite, all time, Sports-related films of all time. The acting & directing is superb for the pace of it, but the real-life story behind the scenes is the true winner here, and how that story is portrayed is done in such a timeless & meaningful way. The fact that I even remember who Paul Depodesta & Billy Beane are after all these years shocks me (considering I don't follow Baseball at all). The only thing that has bothered me all this time, is in my perception, that Billy Beane got all the accolades for Paul Depodesta's theory & actions of the Moneyball phenomenon. Maybe it's just because I don't follow the sport that I don't know more, but in the movie it seems Depodesta's character was shortchanged severely.",1459641600,,902,4.4397590361445785

Not sure how close to reality this truly was, but admire someone like Billy Beane who was handed an unrealistic budget, a personal expectation to compete, tremendous organizational controversy, and found a way to deliver.",1459468800,,424,4.861111111111111

This was an all-around well put together film. The story was interesting and different. It had a little bit of an intellectual side that I liked. It had a strong emotional content if you are affected by this kind of thing. And interestingly, the big action parts were all behind (or in front of) a desk (on the phone; in conference.)

It demonstrates how Billy Beane the GM of the A's and a few baseball statisticians buy and sell undervalued and over valued baseball players as if they were stocks on wall street.",1459209600,,562,4.466019417475728

But the movie is really about the torturous and painful process of changing an old system. It's full of heartache, ""thoughtful"" pauses, sad faces, losing, a broken family, and maybe like one or two jokes. The last two minutes of the movie give you some kind of reprieve, but it's already too late. Your mood is ruined. THE NIGHT IS LOST.",1458345600,2,497,4.461538461538462

4901059,3,B005X5XIF6,"""Moneyball"", based on the book by Michael Lewis, is a different kind of movie and that's one of the best parts of this movie that deserves points. Told from the front office instead of on the field, the movie uses real baseball names, real baseball footage, real baseball knowledge, and real and intricate baseball dealings, in which only true fans of the game have heard of. It's definitely a baseball guru's wet dream! The different perspective and the struggle to compete in a game where money is the supposed king of factors have also won numerous applause from viewers not so familiar with the game of baseball. However, there are a lot of flaws and excluded facts that have gone ignored that finally need to be addressed.
The opening scene shows footage from Game 5 of the 2001 ALDS between the A's and Yankees where the Yankees pounded the A's in New York to advance to the ALCS. Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) is seen listening to it in the empty stands back at Oakland via his radio in anguish, just like I did that night as a fellow Yankees hater. It's a good start to this movie's point in that Billy is going to need the money to combat with this very team and what they do best to win games and championships: spend! Three of his teams best players in first baseman Jason Giambi (confirmed PED user), speedy outfielder Johnny Damon, and closer Jason Isringhausen can't be kept and will go elsewhere, mostly due to the lack of money. Since the ability to spend money has been a notable factor to the success of former owner George Steinbrenner and the Yankees' 27 World Series titles (second closest is the St. Louis Cardinals with 11), Billy needs to find another way to compete and fast! The answer Billy uses is an unheralded form of statistical analysis called sabermetrics but I'll get to that later.
As good as the opening scene is, the movie never brings up the fact that the A's began the ALDS up 2 games to none on the Yankees, winning both games in New York before heading home to Oakland. From there, they proceeded to choke the series away! If this had been mentioned, this movie would not have been so much about a teams ability to stay competitive in a sport where money is a key factor, but more of a movie about a team needing to rebound from a wasted opportunity (which obviously wouldn't be as good). As a matter of fact, as so many people have pointed out, the A's were still a good ball club going into 2002 because of the pitching rich trio of Barry Zito (who won the Cy Young that year), Mark Mulder, and Tim Hudson, as well as MVP shortstop Miguel Tejada. Those names are never mentioned!
This movie is also very heavy-handedly negative in its portrayal of Billy's opposition, namely the scouts and manager Art Howe (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). I've noticed that Aaron Sorkin is a guest writer for this movie and I wouldn't be surprised if he handled these characters. Now, Aaron is perhaps the best writer in the entertainment industry today and can write dialogue like nobody's business--perhaps the only one left who can! However, Aaron is also a very politically and ideologically driven person and in his worst moments, he lets those things get in the way. For one, the scouts represent the kind of systems that Aaron is against: the old. When bringing up the potential 2002 roster, what does Aaron (or Steven Zaillian or Stan Chervin) have the scouts talking about ? Eye candy! However, when Billy asks them if the player can get on base, drive in runs, hit, or whatever, they try to talk about eye candy. When Billy asks the same question (for a third time in a row), they proceed to talk about eye candy (for a third time in a row)! I don't know about you, but that is lazy writing!
The movie also tries to bash Art Howe in an unfavorable light by having him go behind Billy's back during the teams' tough times and in how he doesn't believe in this new system. Now, I've seen footage and interviews of Art Howe from his playing days to his coaching days and he was a pretty good player and guy (I still remember him coming through big in the Astros 1980 NL West tiebreaker). In Oakland, he went 600-533 with a combined 193 wins in the two seasons before this movie takes place. Howe was released after the 2002 season! I recently learned Howe did indeed see the movie after someone recommended he shouldn't, as foxsports.com reports: ""Howe stated that he was unhappy with his portrayal in both the film and the Michael Lewis book it was based on, in which Howe was portrayed as a stubborn traditionalist who refused to follow Beane's plans and a figurehead who acquiesced while Beane ran the A's from the clubhouse. He said it was unfortunate that Beane's lack of regard for him was that obvious."" Again, the one-sidedness in this movie is showing.
So what was Billy's answer to the opposition and the establishment of Major League Baseball? Why, a new and more money-wise manner of statistics mentioned earlier as sabermetrics! Coined ""the search for objective knowledge about baseball"", sabermetrics is objective in using newly formed statistics to answer questions such as ""which player on the A's contributed the most to the offense?"" or ""How many home runs will David Justice hit next year?"" while disregarding the subjective stats and arguments. In using the system, Billy uses these new, objective statistics to determine the right player for his team at a more moderate price rather than trying to outpay the opposing teams for the bigger names.
However, this movie was very schizophrenic in its case for sabermetrics, mostly in how to apply it to the A's style of play. The players that Billy's and Peter's (Jonah Hill) system say give the best chance to compete are aging outfielder David Justice, pitcher Chad Bradford, and (most of all) catcher-turned-first baseman Scott Hatteburg. David Justice had already accomplished quite a bit before Oakland, but the latter two players had bad to mediocre careers! I also remember when Billy told some of the speedier players on the team to get on base (the most popular sabermetric stat) but advised them against stealing bases. When arguing with Billy that he pays for them to steal bases, Billy rebuts by saying that he pays them not to get thrown out stealing. Not only could this be argued as hypocritical and/or a lack of respect for his players, but it could also be argued that this is a style of play similar to the infamous ""playing not to lose"". The point is that maybe sabermetrics isn't all it's hyped up to be and if it is, this movie hasn't done a very good job of proving it!
Other miscellaneous parts that must be mentioned include the revelation that Billy was a failed MLB player in some very badly directed scenes. Billy's also divorced with an ex-wife and she has a new lover, both of whom we learn almost nothing else about. The scenes involving his daughter revolve around her being concerned for her dad's job and her wanting to be a singer. I know a lot of people have liked her character as well as her singing, but on the singing part I'll never understand!
The last fact about this movie and sabermetrics in general, is one thing I'm glad this movie didn't shy away from: the lack of a championship. As this movie confirms, the A's lost to the Twins in (again) five games in the ALDS. I know that we see Beane meeting with the owner of the Boston Red Sox afterwards, who expresses an interest in Billy's system which then lead to Boston winning it's first championship in 86 years--as the closing titles confirm. So hurray, right? The movie has proven its point by showing that despite the lack of a championship, the 2002 A's season proved to be a stepping stone for this sort of grand and revolutionary movement, right?
Not so fast!
Anyone who follows baseball will pretty much confirm that sabermetrics is not what won the Red Sox the 2004 championship. It didn't even GET them to the Fall Classic! They only got there because the Yankees committed the biggest choke job in the history of professional sports! Not only were quite a few of the players from years past already there, but the Red Sox--despite adding the godfather of sabermetrics, Bill James as part of their office--ended up turning their back on sabermetrics and became one of the biggest spenders in MLB soon after 2004! The point is that sabermetrics, despite its portrayal in the film, is still a flawed science that remains not well understood and its real-world applications towards MLB teams remain difficult to point out.
So the only thing to take away from this movie is that the 2002 A's won 103 regular season games while riding a major-league record 20 straight regular season wins...which was almost choked away thanks to Billy Beane showing up to watch an 11-0 lead! Ho-hum.",1449792000,,8772,4.641800643086817

4901098,4,B005X5XIF6,"I thought maybe this movie would be somewhat of a boring look at the business side of baseball. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it had some real heart and also involved an intimate look at the experiences of some of the characters. This movie is based on the true story of the Oakland Athletics of the early 2000s who found some success as a small-market, low-budget team through the use of statistical analysis and the signing of unconventional but affordable players. The main character is the general manager who is forced to try something different and happens to discover a number cruncher while visiting another team during the off season. Along the way we get to meet a few of the players for that season and experience some of the highs and lows of the team such as a poor start to the season which eventually transformed into a record-breaking string of victories and an unexpected but bittersweet trip to the post season. This movie was interesting enough to make me want to read up on the real-life characters in the movie and the statistical techniques that changed the world of baseball signings. If you have even the slightest interest in baseball, this is a movie you will like. It is well-written, well-acted and well-filmed.",1446854400,4,1253,4.778801843317972

4901201,5,B005X5XIF6,"I'm getting my butt kicked in fantasy baseball, but I still love this movie. It's about stats, predictions, player management in a major league baseball environment where the new rules using myriad forms of data start to take hold. Billy Beane did this in 2002 with the Oakland A's using data as predictions of player production. So many walks, runs, no bunting; things the players themselves had control of by getting on base. The ultimate in control was good pitching but the playing field between batter and pitcher was about to be leveled mathematically. Of course this new era of predictability curried no favor with the old time baseball scouts who procured the players for the team. Needless to say they were not on board and neither were the team managers or many in upper management. Now scouting in all pro sports consists of using data related to the game and the players to pick the new players who will help form championship teams. Scouting has become much more involved as to which players will be drafted and how they will fit into the general managers' view of usefulness to a winning team. So it's fun and educational and would make a great sports fan get together movie with a warning as to foul language as you might suspect.",1436400000,,1245,4.689497716894977

4901220,4,B005X5XIF6,"In most fields, particularly those which have been around for 100 years or more, the so-called ""conventional wisdom"" often dominates decision-making in business. And yet over and over again, business wants to adhere to conventional wisdom, until it's debunked when someone brilliant comes along and demonstrates different approaches to the ""tried and true"". These conventions are often misconceptions usually based on faulty logic and/or faulty information. ""Moneyball"" starring Brad Pitt is largely about challenging the conventional wisdom and ultimately the status quo of Major League Baseball, a sport with an approximate 170-year history.

In Major League Baseball, the conventional wisdom has been that big stars with big salaries make winning teams. Billie Beane (Brad Pitt in an Oscar-caliber performance), a little known GM of the Oakland Athletics, challenged that convention and made winning teams with a much smaller budget and no big star players, or at least former stars in the latter part of their careers. Most of his players were undervalued performers who would play for far less money than the big superstars. Moneyball, based on the book by Michael Lewis, chronicles Beane's new unconventional approach.

For help, he solicits a young economics wizard Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) who has been using techniques to analyze players at a much deeper level. Instead of scouting players in the usual way, by simply watching them at ball parks either at the high school or college level, Brand would look at all their statistics. Not just batting averages, but on-base percentage, runs scored, and even how well they do against other players. They also derive how many runs total the team will need to score in the course of a season to enter the playoffs, and they figure out how many base runners they will need to accomplish this goal.

The use of statistics to tell larger unseen stories was begun by baseball statistician innovator Bill James, which he calls Sabermetrics. Sabermetrics looks much deeper into players' performance in terms of their contribution to the team as a whole, rather than just looking at speed, batting average and on-field errors. The system also analyzes how well a team's offense bats as a whole, called base runs, not just team batting average. Before James, traditional scouting often relied on simply watching players in action a few times and determining speed and build, and even such things that have nothing to do with the game, such as how attractive they were as well their girlfriends!

Beane and Brand take these theories of using much deeper statistics to the management and their scouts to assemble a roster of undervalued talent and misfits at a fraction of the price of teams like the NY Yankees. At first there is much resistance in upper management and also then A's manager Art Howe. According to the film, Howe is resistant to play the players in the way they were designed. And the team suffers, losing many games. Commentators and even the A's' owners begin questioning Beane's methods. For example, Scott Hatteberg was recruited because of his high on-base percentage, but had been a catcher with the Red Sox who lost his throwing ability due to injury. Most scouts believed his career was over. But Beane and Brand believe he could contribute to the A's. Only, Hatteberg would have to play first base, but Howe was reluctant to play him. In a daring move, Beane trades their rookie first baseman and other players mid-season, forcing Howe to play Hatteberg at first base. Then, all of a sudden, something magical happens.

This is truly an inspiring film about a true-to-life baseball story. I have been an SF Giants fan all my life, but this film almost made me an A's fan. The SF Giants finally achieved a World Series win in 2010, also with a bunch of misfits and undervalued players. The Red Sox finally overcame the Bambino Curse with a World Series win 2004. I have to believe both the Red Sox and the Giants used Beane's methods to assemble unlikely teams of undervalued players to achieve success. Even though the A's and Beane did not quite win world series rings, they may have fundamentally changed the game which only about a half dozen people can claim in the history of baseball. It's one thing to make a great contribution as a player. It is even more significant to change how major league teams operate. Beane may have made the most significant contribution to professional baseball since Branch Rickey signed Jackie Robinson and broke the color barrier in 1946. It doesn't get much better than that.",1433808000,,4584,4.971316818774446

Moneyball is an enthralling baseball movie thats barely about baseball.

I love all baseball movies but i give it 4 stars only because they don't include barry zito, mark mulder and tim hudson in this movie besides showing their jerseys yet they include scott hatteberg and jeremy giambi? That just doesn't make sense to me. I think besides that it's a very good movie. Billy beene reinvented how teams evaluate talent and since the time where this film takes place a lot of small market teams has found success and made it to world series like the marlins, rays, and most recently royals. It's good that this movie was made. I haven't read the book but i bet it's just as good or even better than this movie. Brad pitt and jonah hill are great in this movie and i think they played a different style character than they normally play and think they did well with their new roles.

Scott Hatteberg started at Designated Hitter for much of the 2002 season, including the opening game.  He only moved to 1B after Carlos Pena was traded.  This movie completely fabricated the whole Hatteberg conflict and seemed to forget about the DH rule in the American League.

4901300,2,B005X5XIF6,"Jonah Hill was good, and the scenes of the inner workings of a baseball organization are interesting for a while, but then it all gets redundant as the Pitt character is portrayed heroically and in increasingly trying shots of him thinking . . . weighing the options . . . thinking . . . remembering . . . thinking (I assume).  The flashback sequences of him as a young phenom get old quickly, too; the filmmakers apparently were setting up the ""big decision"" at the end of the film, the other half of which plays out in a very treacly scene that (spoiler alert!) involves a compact disk.  Maybe if I hadn't read the book and always wanted to watch too-long shots of Brad Pitt I'd be wishing there was a six-star option?  Naaaah.",1425168000,,729,4.425373134328358

4901402,5,B005X5XIF6,"Moneyball is a sports drama film based on Michael Lewis's book of the same name which gives an account of the Oakland Athletics baseball team's 2002 season and their general manager's attempts to assemble a competitive team.

Based on a true story,it is a movie for anybody who has ever dreamed of taking on the system. Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland A's and the guy who assembles the team, who has an epiphany: all of baseball's conventional wisdom is wrong. Forced to reinvent his team on a tight budget, Beane will have to outsmart the richer clubs. The onetime jock teams with Ivy League grad Peter Brand in an unlikely partnership, recruiting bargain players that the scouts call flawed, but all of whom have an ability to get on base, score runs, and win games. The team's scouts are first dismissive of and then hostile towards Brand's non-traditional sabermetric approach to scouting players, most notably Grady Fuson  who is fired by Beane after insulting their approach, and takes to the radio airwaves and doubts the team's future. Rather than relying on the scouts' experience and intuition, Brand selects players based almost exclusively on their on base percentage (OBP). By finding players with a high OBP but with characteristics that lead scouts to dismiss them, Brand assembles a team of undervalued players with far more potential than the A's hamstrung finances would otherwise allow. Despite vehement objections from the scouts, Beane supports Brand's theory and hires the players he selected, such as unorthodox submarine pitcher Chad Bradford. Following the free agent signings, Beane finds that he also faces opposition from Art Howe, the Athletics' manager. With tensions already high between them because of a contract dispute, Howe disregards Beane and Brand's strategy and plays the team in a traditional style despite their unsuitability. Beane eventually trades away the lone traditional first baseman, Carlos Pea, to force Howe to use the new recruits. Early in the season, the Athletics fare poorly, leading critics within and outside the team to dismiss the new method as a dismal failure. Beane convinces the owner to stay the course, and eventually the team's record begins to improve. Ultimately, the Athletics win 20 consecutive games, setting the American League record. Their streak is capped with a victory over the Kansas City Royals.

The movie is not a traditional sports movie, and indeed should be just as gripping for non-sports fans. It's not a series of Big Games. When it goes to the field, it's for well-chosen crucial moments. Its essence is in terse, brainy dialogue by the two accomplished screenwriters Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian. As in ""The Social Network,"" abstract discussions reflect deep emotional conflicts. There are a lot of laughs, but only one or two are inspired by lines intended to be funny. Instead, our laughter comes from recognition, an awareness of irony, an appreciation of perfect zingers  and, best of all, insights into human nature.

This is really a movie about business. None of the individual players have major roles. The drama all happens in the mind of a general manager and his numbers guy. They bet against tradition and in favor of numerical analysis. That goes against a century of baseball history, although for all of those years, fans have thumbed through their baseball almanacs and issued mind-numbing statistical theories on talk shows. What the numbers crunchers demonstrated is that a computer can assemble a team better than human instinct.

Finally,what is surprising about this movie is that it has intelligence and depth as it presents a man who is about to redeem himself from his past failures and overcome the present challenges and obstacles that he is currently facing in the achievement of his goals.",1417132800,,3844,5.103338632750398

4901409,5,B005X5XIF6,"First.  I am not a sports fan.  I am a stadium junk food fan, but, according to my boyfriend, that is apparently not the same thing as being a sports fan.  Whatevers.

But then, I was going to iPic to see a movie, which was sold out, and I don't even remember what it was, and this movie was playing just at that time and frankly, i didn't even bother to see what movie it was, I just heard 'Brad Pitt' and I was like 'Yes, please.'  And really, 'Moneyball'?  How am I supposed to guess it's a sports movie, right?

So, I was there.  I watched it.  Hooked from the first few minutes, really.  Maybe it's because I like math and it's as much a math movie as it is a baseball movie.  Well, it's not, but let's pretend it is.  There is a line in the movie about baseball that I wouldn't have gotten before I saw this movie.  Billy Beane says, ""How can you not get romantic about baseball?""  If you had told me that this line was said in a sports movie in a non-self-mocking way, I would have snorted and dismissed the comment.  But now, I kinda get it.

Kinda.  Frankly, I still go to the games to watch the stretching and to eat garlic fries and Dippin' Dots.  Woohoo!  But now, I acknowledge the possibility that there might be other reasons why people might go.

As to the ""what about the movie?!?"" portion of this review -

Brief synopsis:
So, Billy Beane hires Peter, an economics wiz from Yale (and apparent Baseball Fanatic) to help him put together a team that doesn't completely suck on a shoestring budget.  And that's what they do. In a tremendous overkill type way.

Great points:
* I dislike Jonah Hill in virtually all of his movies.  When I saw him in this movie, I realized that I had been wrong.  It was the characters in his other movies that I hated.  Jonah Hill himself is (apparently) a fine actor and was brilliant in this role as a high-functioning geek (FYI: High-functioning geeks are much like high-functioning sociopaths but with fewer manners and with less of the complete lack of morality).

* Brad Pitt was also amazing.  He was not in anyway heart-throb-y, which made him all the more heart-throb-y in my book.  I mean, how can you not like a guy who turns down a bajillion dollars because he is loyal to his loser-ish team and because he doesn't want to leave the state that houses his daughter?  Nice, right?  Yah.  I thought so as well.

* Amazing acting by supporting roles, not the least of which being the greatly missed Philip Seymour Hoffman.

* Chris Pratt of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guardians-of-the-Galaxy/dp/B00N1JQ2UO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guardians of the Galaxy</a>&nbsp;fame also makes an appearance as Scott Hatteberg in one of the more touching scenes in the movies.  Here again, was an example where I was surprised by the depth of a performance by an actor I had pretty much written off as a character actor, mainly put in to movies for laughs.  My bad on that one, Chris. Oh, and Jonah.  You both rocked it in this movie.  In serious roles, yet.  Kudos.

Not-so-great:
* The amazingly talented Robin Wright has not had luck in finding movie or roles that best display her talents, and this was another one.  Brilliant movie but she was under-used as the ex-wife of Billy Beane.

* Music soundtrack not the best.  An amusing song (fictionally authored) by Billy Beane's daughter aside.  On the other hand, this wasn't a movie where the soundtrack was pivotal (unlike say, in any superhero movie made, ever), so I give it a pass.

*Not a lot of baseball players stretching on screen, which was kind of a let down for me since this was, in fact, a *baseball* movie.  And, as mentioned previously, one of the two reasons I go to games in the first place. Hmmm.....

Conclusion:
All-in-all an excellent film.  Great for sports-lovers and sports-meh-ers alike. As to the rating (for those who are sensitive to those things), there are some obscenities which is why this is PG13, but it was in keeping with the locker-room setting of the movie and so entirely appropriate.  At no point did I roll my eyes and say 'Ah!  The f-bomb.  That must indicate the character is tough / angry / hungry / under 25, etc.'  I have a pet peeve about gratuitous swearing being used in place of actual dialog.  That was not the case in this movie.",1416614400,11,4328,4.596858638743456
4901410,2,B005X5XIF6,"Pros: Brad Pitt is believable as Billy Beane. The scenes with Jonah Hill and Brad Pitt together are outstanding. The film is insightful about what it's like to confront a ""we've never done it that way before"" mentality. Cons: The film ignores the fact that the A's had been in the playoffs the previous year. The film almost totally ignores the roles that Miguel Tejada, Barry Zito, Mark Mulder and Tim Hudson played on the 2002 A's. The film suggests that Billy Beane used Peter Brand's statistical analysis to acquire undervalued players like Scott Hatteberg, David Justice and Chad Bradford and this resulted in the A's winning more than 100 games, but it doesn't prove how much those undervalued players contributed to the 2002 A's. The film plays fast and loose with the facts in a way that goes beyond the bounds of poetic license. For example, Scott Hatteberg has confirmed that the shameful portrayal of Art Howe is inaccurate. The film ignores the fact that Paul DePodesta (the real Peter Brand) was hired as the GM of the L.A. Dodgers, and his statistics-driven approach coincided with the Dodgers having their worst season in more than a decade. The film blows the 20-game winning streak out of proportion. The film is too long.
 ""Moneyball"" has been hyped and praised with an almost religious fervor. I am definitely swimming against the current (a la Billy Beane) by saying that it isn't terrible, but it just isn't that good. My favorite scene was Billy Beane's meeting with the scouts around the table.",1416441600,,1517,4.834615384615384

The power and magic of number just doesn't show enough in the movie. I also read the book. The movie tries to simplify the idea and the whole concept of this ""numbers"" experiment so that a non-baseball fan could understand. But I think the effort somehow falls in a no man's land between non-baseball people and genuine baseball fans.

To non-baseball people: This movie might be fun to watch, but I am not sure it could be your blockbuster.

4901423,5,B005X5XIF6,A great movie by the great Aaron Sorkin!!!!!!!,1414800000,,46,4.875
4901424,5,B005X5XIF6,"""Moneyball"". Who would have guessed? Because the film APPEARS to be about baseball- which is fine with me- it waited  unwatched on my shelf for many months. I purchased the film because of Aaron Sorkin- a writer for whom there is no equal today though for the past he is with Ibsen, Shaw, Shakespeare. Sorkinis responsible for so much but you all know him for writing the famous Nicholson line: "":You can't handle the truth!"" Now part of LAmerican vernacular, like Sophie's Choice and Are You Lookin' at me?  But I discovered a lot more. ""Moneyball"" is not about Baseball; it is about human beings who produce entertainment for America. After 32 years in the business of music and theatre, I spent 50% of my time with suits, agents, meetings and contracts, ownership of rights and a percent of the gross and box office and press and publicity and total lack of privacy- well, Theatre, film, music sports: America wants it and this film will show you the behind the scenes truth. Expertly, emotionally and with intense suspense.

It is impossible to cite specific indivduals for the excellence of this film because the collaborative efect is so spectacular that one almost fails to notice. This film is based on the book of the same name by Michael Lewis (Norton & C0) but then, in a moment of brilliance, by executive producer, Scott Rudin, the screenplay was as mentioned, written by Aaron Sorkin and the remarkable Steven Zaillan. The screenplay is flawless and one can tell that there was very little- if any- improvised lines in the filming. There is a musical fluidity to the speach and soundtrack that line up flawless;ly, almost as if the two playwrites and fim composer, Mychael Danna, were all in one brain with a clear view off the final edit. The score is spectacular and Danna is not the only one responsible. The entire music department- including and additional composer- has created a musical masterpiece to sync with all else.

Christopher Tellefsen's film editing is so beautiful, masterful and- yes, as the film teaches us- manipulative that even the most rugged 55 year old man will find a lump in his throat at times. But Bennett Miller, director, gets the credit for it all as the man with the final say and the man who, along with the written word, pulled these moving and remarkable performances out of some remarkable veteran actors. Brad Pitt has established himself as a serious actor here, though had he not been so remarkably attractive and half naked in ""Thelma and Louise"" the world would have seen it there. As a fourty-four year old man, divorced with a 13 year old daughter we see the sincere emotions that tug at the inside of his soul. He has a passion for baseball and at age 18 gave up a Scholarship at Stanord to sign with The New York Mets; a first draft pick that lasted only one season. Now he is the General Manager o the Oakland A's during the 2002 season and it is his intent to change baseball. He does this with the help of the very gifted actor, Jonah Hall by using statistical data to create a low budget baseball club, something for which everyone thinks is insane, particularly the team manager, played by the legend Phillip Seymour hofman in yet another dazling character performance. Pitt plays Billy Beane, a man pulled in many directions: baseball, his past, and his undying devotion to his daughter (expertly played by the miraculous Kerris Dorsey who twice in the film exhibts a singer-singwriter talent for her father perfformed by her without the use of studio fixing or embelishment- a true talent.) who, it turns out, delivers the most remarkable wisdom that the film offers. Her acting is something we haven;t sen from a 13 year old since Jpodie Foster did ""Taxi Driver."" This credit is indeed shared with Miller's direction, who clearly explained many adult and kid situations rather than the Hollywood tradition of cute, crying wide eyes children. In fact, the scenes between her and Pitt are some of the films most powerful. Still, I must mention Robin Wright, Chris Pratt, Brent Jennings and- in a small but powerful performance, Diane Behrens, first amazing us in 1989 wit the film adaptation of Bob Woodward's ""Wired."" Her time on screen is so short; she has few lines and all in flashback memory (she plays Beane's mother) but what this woman conveys with her face and eyes is on a par with Meryl Streep. Arliss Howard, as the owner of the Boston red Sox, gives a remarkable eight minute performance filmed on location at Fenway Park-doing character work unlike anything he's done before.

Most of us take the Director of Photography for granted, but, as with ""Out Of Africa"" this is one where we must pause. Wally Pfister has created a myriad of images that capture bnoth granduer and subtlety using angles, lighting, weather, composition in ways that are rarely seen on film.

All of these elements, and many many more, come together to create a masterpiece of film. It will entertain and move you with one watch. That won't satisfy you. You will return, as most people do with Sorkin's writing, and you will begin to notice details in every department that you had;t seen previously. In an era when most of what Hollywood is producing is mindless special effect fantasy and Comic Book dreck, this is more exciting, more moving and more artistic than any film I have seen this decade.

At this price, buy the thing. No matter what. For baseball fans this will be a vertible orgasmic event- better than the 86 world series.",1414713600,5,5492,4.7384937238493725

4901426,3,B005X5XIF6,"I'm giving this movie three stars. not because it sucked, but because it just kind of didn't pop. It didn't really jump out at you and really deliver the goods. It was kind of mundane. This may be unfair of me, but I'm also kind of bitter and disappointed that this wasn't a rollicking comedy. All of the previews for it on TV made it look like a hilarious comedy of errors, with people blowing up at each other, throwing chairs, entering into comical situations, and throwing out punchy one liners. I thought this movie would tap into Brad Pitt's cool sense of humor that we see in interviews. Instead, it was one of those mundane movies that really focused on chess maneuvers of the characters, who are trying to get their agenda done. Basically, this whole movie was about office politics. The most interesting things in this movie happen in your mind, not on the screen. And even that's not that exciting. That is probably owed to the fact that this was a book that Brad Pitt adapted to the screen. It was trying to explain things, but film is a visual medium. I don't mean to make it sound like this was the most boring movie ever, though, because it wasn't.

However, there was nothing juicy or adrenaline pumping about this movie. It looked like it could have been a more sophisticated ""Bad News Bears,"" or ""Major League,"" but it wasn't even in that genre. This movie could have been a pretty rocking comedy if it chose to go in that direction, but instead, it chose to tell the true to life story of the guy who first employed the tactic of money ball. For that reason, there was nothing bigger than life, and nothing that was that exciting in a dramatic or comedic way. The subject matter is interesting, I'm just not sure that it was told in an exciting way. With no malice in my heart or thinking that this is a horrible movie, I give it three stars.",1414368000,,1861,4.425655976676385

4901432,4,B005X5XIF6,"Brad Pitt stars as Billy Beane, the General Manager of the Oakland Athletics, in the film based on Michael Lewis's 2003 book. The story follows Beane's adoption of Sabermetrics, a hitherto approach of using unconventional statistics to scout and analyze players, to compete against wealthier big market teams such as the Yankees and Red Sox. This leads to Beane signing discarded or undiscovered players such as David Justice, Nick Swisher, Chad Bradford and Scott Hatteberg who helped the Athletics win 20 consecutive games, an American League record, and a berth in the playoffs.

The movie has several divergences from the book, which is now used in many money management courses as a primer on portfolio analysis, namely in fleshing out Billy Beane's brief career in professional baseball and his strained relationship with his daughter. This also movie takes liberties with some of the events that occurred during the 2002 season.

Then I found myself watching it again, and again, and again. It's a quiet movie; a talky movie, and nothing about it particularly jumps out of you. But once it ends, you will find it's left a lasting impact. You'll remember the scenes of Billy Beane trying his hardest to keep a distance between him and the unconventional team he's assembled, before finally diving right in with them. You'll remember hilarious, quippy, witty scenes of Billy Beane and Peter Brandt trading players and jabs. And most of all, you'll love seeing this lovable crew of misfits completely revolutionizing the way baseball is played.

""How can you not be romantic about baseball?"" asks Beane, his world changed as much as the world around him. The same way you'll wonder how you can not be romantic about this tiny, funny, brilliant film.",1410220800,,963,4.732142857142857

although underpaid, still millionaires) running around in the world of contemporary baseball? And,
well, for some (like Cape May resident Patricia C.), there was no getting over that feeling. I appreciated
the underdog factor and the character study of Oakland As General Manager, Billy Beane (played by
Brad Pitt, for which he is nominated for Best Actor). The tension was real, the inside look at Beanes
personal life was heartfelt and genuine, and ultimately the story was well told. Patricia did not put her
stamp of approval on the movie. They were trying to make Pitt out to be a young Robert Redford,

4901501,5,B005X5XIF6,"What's that? You say you don't like baseball, or you don't get it, or never understood it past striking out or a home run? Well that's perfectly fine because this movie is not about baseball. I mean it takes place within a baseball team's inner workings, and there are a lot of baseball things going on, but that just provides the backdrop within which the real story unfolds. And if you don't understand some things it doesn't matter because you will get the gist of what is going on, thanks to some pretty darn good writing which allows for that.
This is really a story about doing what you believe is right, even when the whole world says you are wrong, not giving up, and also not accepting success until it is completeon your very own terms. Now I'm a Brad Pitt fan from way back, and I've always believed he is a much better actor than he has ever been given credit for, and he is very good here as well, in an Oscar-nominated sort of way. This role was tougher than most, and could have easily gotten away from a less experienced actor, but Brad handles it well, never too over the top nor too somber. He plays Billy Bean as a man of vision, buty not a visionary, a true realist all the way, and someone you may not love or hate, but who should earn your respect.
This movie has its up and downs, lots of things to smile at, and even though not a real feel good movie, still I did feel pretty good afterwards. It is well worth seeing if you like any of what I mentioned.",1407542400,,1477,4.222614840989399

4901533,5,B005X5XIF6,"This is a great story about a real person who became an innovator in baseball. Hard to do that, in case you're wondering. Brad Pitt is terrific as Billy Beane. One of his best lines is delivered to David Justice who is the highest paid player on a team with the lowest payroll in baseball. The Yankees cut him loose and are paying part of his $7 million salary. Brad Pitt explains it this way to the aging star, who is a bit smug about his position on a team that has no other stars: ""You need to understand that the Yankees are paying you $4 million this year to play AGAINST them."" Many other great scenes. I've seen this several times and never get tired of it. The really Billy Beane is interviewed in the bonus scenes.

If you think Brad Pitt is cheesy and not worth your effort, put those doubts away and enjoy him in one of the two roles he was born to play (along with Fight Club).",1405382400,,889,4.1686046511627906

4901537,3,B005X5XIF6,"Not a bad film, at least it's good enough to inspire my 12-year-old to watch it again and again (!!!!), and to fall in love with the dialogue; Michael Lewis' book is imperfect - it's a collection of vignettes about people you only start to care about before he moves on to the next one, structured around a very simple concept, which is that Wall Street principles can be used to improve sports.

The film is similarly loosely-constructed, but we dwell much more on Brad Pitt, and we also get to see a lot of Jonah Hill, as a fat kid analyst. The film has few exciting moments, and just seem to be constantly wry and slow-paced. A lot of hanging around the clubhouse after hours, chatting, very little sweating or athletics. Some of the moments that I thought would be the most visually amazing from the book, such as the crazy pitching of Chad Bradford (probably the most interesting character in the book), were hardly shown. There are three locations in the film - the stadium diamond, the training camp, and the locker room, making it feel pretty claustrophobic; the lighting, though, is interesting, and the director of photography is clearly quite engaged.

The bonus features to the DVD are nothing special - a blooper of Brad getting the giggles as he tries to do a serious scene, and three deleted scenes that probably should have been in the movie: a longer scene with Philip Seymour Hoffman (over four minutes) about management matters, a dinner scene with Brad's character's ex-wife, played gorgeously by Robin Wright (who I don't remember seeing in the film at all!) of two minutes, and ""Peter offered GM job"" that goes on for five minutes and is very touching and silent. There's a 16-minute documentary on Billy Beane called ""Billy Beane: Re-inventing The Game"" that features Michael Lewis, director Bennet Miller, screenwriter Allen Sorkin, telling the story of the guy with scenes from the movie. Sort of a documentary for people who hadn't seen the film. And there's Billy Beane himself! And Alex Rodriguez!! Finally, there's a 19:30-minute documentary about the making of the film, ""Moneyball: Playing The Game."" Nothing special there either, actually... Bennett claims that they made the film as literal and factual as possible, although there's definitely still a fair amount of deviation from the book and the game. The locker room is a big set, took three months to build, paint and carpet, but they did film at Oakland Coliseum for two weeks. A really boring discussion over the recreation of the 2002 Oakland A's uniforms and how they were worn (slightly) different from each other. Billy Beane's wardrobe, the crowd extras, shooting on film rather than a digital format, ""without the brighter environments you can't have the darker environments, so it's really a balance of what you're doing narratively and where you're taking that visually, from the dark to the light"", found footage is mixed with re-created footage, stadium lights were shut off in order to make moodier lighting in the stadium, ""the Oakland coliseum is a character in the movie"", yawwwwnnnn...",1405036800,,3090,4.917624521072797

However, the movie adaptation provides something that the book doesn't have -- a plot. After all, the book is nonfiction and expository; it explains how Beane applied sabermetric theory to recruit players for the Oakland A's.

The movie ""Moneyball"" put baseball into the 21st Century through the use of computer-generated technology.
Billy Beane, played by Bratt Pitt, as general manager of the Oakland A's tried to put a baseball team together on a low budget. To accomplish this awesome task he utilized computers to assist him in getting baseball players.
In a time when conventional methods of running a baseball club were put aside and up-grating to computer technology makes this an exciting baseball story filled with lots of action, adventure, and suspense. Marvin P. Ferguson, author of BOYS ON THE GOLD COAST.",1397433600,,881,5.075862068965518
4901569,5,B005X5XIF6,"Is Moneyball the feel good baseball movie that puts a smile on your face because of how the protagonist was able to overcome adversity? No.
Moneyball is about a man and a baseball team, that man Billy Beane and that baseball team The Oakland Athletics.
The Oakland A's are a competitive team who are losing their top free agents and have no money to replace them. Billy Beane is a failed former baseball player who can trade a bag of chips for a star baseball player. I won't spoil anything but the premise is essentially about finding a way to compete with limited resources.

The acting by Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill and Philip Seymour Hoffman is top notch. BP and JH make a smart and witty duo, and at times the dialogue can be very funny between the two. Acting is definitely the bright spot of the movie along with a pretty straightforward storyline which is entertaining.

It's based on a true story and has a few inadequacies, but that's Hollywood for you.

So do you have to be an Oakland A's fan or even a baseball fan to like this movie? Yes and No. You definitely don't need to be an A's fan to like this movie though as a baseball fan you may need to approach this movie with an open mind. I can't say to many non baseball fans would like this unless your really fascinated with the sports world and business or just business in general. It's literally about putting together a broken baseball team so I just can't see to many people watching this unless they're a fan of the sport.

Overall Moneyball is a fun flick, has a little comedy here and there and the movie comes together very well with a strong and great dialogue.",1397347200,,1632,4.394039735099338
4901570,4,B005X5XIF6,"This movie had dramatic elements but was clever and funny as well. Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill had great on-screen chemistry and were convincing as well. It was kind of fun to watch Hill's character come out of his awkward shell and gain confidence with Beane's mentoring. Call me a cynic but I was glad it wasn't a total Cinderella story.

I could have done without the 'domestic' scenes but  they were probably put in to soften the intense depiction of  Beane going for his ultimate goal ... using today's technology to put together a Team that could win baseball games without draining the coffers.

4901611,4,B005X5XIF6,"Moneyball is about professional baseball, but its story is nothing like that of more upbeat Major League (my favorite movie). Directed by Bennett Miller (Capote) and written by two Oscar-winning writers Steven Zaillian (Schindler's List) and Aaron Sorkin (The Social Network), Moneyball looks more like a character study about a person with a unique personality and strong will.

The person is Billy Beane, real-life general manager of Oakland Athletics, who has to assemble a competitive team within a very limited budget. Brad Pitt is in top form as Billy Beane, who, with a help from a Yale graduate Peter Brand (Jonah Hill, equally good), introduces a new method, statistical analysis, to evaluate players.

You don't have to know much about baseball because the film is after all about business, or politics behind the professional baseball, and those who are involved, including Beane and old-school scouts with traditional methods. The film is also thought-provoking and funny in a subdued (maybe too subdued) way.

But the most intriguing part of the film is Billy Beane himself, superbly played by Brad Pitt. You may not like him and the new system he brings in the team, but his character (with his career as a MLB player told in flashbacks) is very interesting. As Billy Beane's daughter in the film sings, Just enjoy the show. (But does he?)",1389139200,,1353,5.03125

Loving baseball and having played some and still own the strikeout record (I struck out) in my neighborhood that had Rico Petrocelli to admire, I watched Moneyball with excited interest. Once baseball was just fun and a way to project a hidden angst. Being an adult means  baseball players get sent down, have children, have mortgages to pay and that typical concern to except reality is nicely fit into the mix, but all are secondary to the ruthlessness that is quietly business.. Lose the last game and your gone and for the ballplayers it's true; not for the general manager: winning season he stays on, and excellently played by Pitt, he realizes that his family and his job depends on forgetting about the charm about baseball and more about getting on base. As in any corporate culture, baseball teams have to win, make money. It is not a good way to treat people but then they don't care, and that is the rub. it was fun seeing how big movie, corporations with big money, movie stars use the metaphor to portray a similar scene.

4901633,4,B005X5XIF6,"The movie is on a true story basis. Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), the general manager of the Oakland Athletics seems frustrated with his team losing to the New York Yankees. This forces him to reinvent his team by trying to devise a new plan to formulate a competitive team. This strategy causes many challenges to the team. Beane has to work hard to beat the much richer clubs that keep purchasing the best players from the team. The movie is less about baseball and more about persistence. Essentially, one does not need any baseball background information to enjoy the movie. In fact, we do not get to meet the players in person, as they are not of importance. The individual victories of the team members are not vital. Beane meets a young economist Brand with great radical ideas and thinks he has the capability of helping with the implementation of his plan and makes him his assistant. With the combined efforts of Brand and Beane, the movie places emphasis on fighting for the things that an individual believes in. The movie is more than about baseball. It targets individuals that have their dreams locked in dark corners and are afraid to pursue the things that they believe in. The film aims at altering history (Lewis 1). According to the film, Carlos Pena remained Oaklands starting first baseman from opening day until Detroit signed him in July. In the real sense, although he started at first base between April and May, Scott Hatterberg replaced him in 1 June, and was playing for Oaklands AAA when the trading to Detroit took place. The movie is inspirational and inspires the target group to pursue their dream.",1386115200,,1627,4.752650176678445

Billy Beane may have helped bring hard, cold statistics and mathematical formulas to the world of sports, but we can see that he does it out of a genuine passion and reverence for the game. As someone who is generally uninterested in the history of baseball, I found that the film does an excellent job of bringing Billy Beane's story to life in a gripping and satisfying way.

Did we really have to see Beane's interactions with his daughter and twice suffer through her singing a Lenka song, a tune which is even irritating when sung by Lenka? His relationship with the child did NOTHING to advance the story.

The screenplay was dismal. There was absolutely no suspense and there should have been plenty. There was little explanation of Pitt's wheeling and dealing on the phone with club owners. Even the winning of 20 games in a row was not depicted in a thrilling way. It was not.

4901650,3,B005X5XIF6,"I'd recommend a viewing of this film, but I wouldn't spend good money on it.

One thing I have a question about is why the film hyped Carlos Pena so much. Perhaps Beane (Pitt) was calling him an All-Star or potential Rookie of the Year in order to gin up his trade value, but when Pena was traded he was hitting a lowly .218 with only 7 home runs. And while he later went on to have some high home run totals, through 2013 he had a lifetime batting average of a miniscule .233.

Not a big fan of Philip Seymour Hoffman and this film didn't help that. If the coach he played, Art Howe, is as boorish and lifeless as he was portrayed by Hoffman in this film, than I guess Hoffman nailed it and did a great acting job here. If Howe is/was not that way, than the acting was as bad as I thought.",1381968000,,790,4.025477707006369

4901657,4,B005X5XIF6,"Now that baseball's postseason is upon us, there's not a better time to take in a baseball movie.  I missed MONEYBALL when it made its theatrical run, even though I wanted to go see it, but I digress.  Thanks to the wonders of cable TV, I've seen it several times; this account of the 2002 Oakland A's is a keeper.  In particular, it's the story of Oakland's GM, Billy Beane, re-inventing the wheel.  Being the smallest market in all of baseball, Oakland constantly has its most talented players getting snatched up by franchises that can afford to pay them tens of millions.  While most GMs would take the leftovers and try to remain competitive, Beane wants to win.  He wants to win with second and third-tier players.  How?  Statistics.  Winning in baseball is all about getting on base, whether it be hitting or walking.  And winning is about chasing starting pitchers off the mound by the 5th inning, which entails every batter going deep into the pitch count with every at-bat.  So. . .which players on Beane's roster have the best on-base percentage--and the discipline to go deep into the pitch count at the plate?  It's all in the statistics.  And those that boast the numbers get to play, to the consternation of everyone else in the Oakland organization, from the manager to the scouts to the front office. . .to the players themselves.

Brad Pitt is solid as Billy Beane.  He's not pretentious or petulant or angry or bitter; he's just a soft-spoken former player with a passion for winning--and a no-nonsense approach to running an organization.  And Jonah Hill is superb as nerdy Peter Brand, a Harvard economist Beane hires to help him crunch the numbers; Hill plays off Pitt's quiet demeanor with ""aw, shucks"" gushiness.  Of the supporting cast, I especially liked Philip Seymour Hoffman as Oakland manager Art Howe; Hoffman depicts Howe as the overwhelmed skipper he must have been.  Naturally the team stinks as the season begins, yet Beane perseveres, and over the course of the summer the team comes together and goes on a remarkable run, culminating in winning the American League West.  (Which I readily remember.)  Although it meanders from time to time, MONEYBALL is a feel-good story that, yes, wins.  It's a solid triple, right in the gap.

1) It is hard to make a movie on this subject. Showing changes in the way one picks baseball players while using a new controversial method is bound to show many meetings and discussions as opposed to action. What do you do to avoid this to be a technical documentary? How do you make it so that it is not boring? So the writers decided to add a sentimental bit and to show the unhappy side of people who work too much. They show Billy Beane as a divorced dad. Some reviewers criticize it, but frankly, the movie needed ""something"".
2) It is a real story about a real club, but one of the principal heroes did not want to be represented in the movie. He was right: once you sell your image, you lose the control over it. It is why we have a little new guy strong in stats who does not know much about sports (the fictional Peter Brand from Yale) instead of the real life Paul DePodesta from Harvard who knew quite a lot.
3) Because it is a real life story, you cannot not end the movie the way we all want, with the little guy beating the big guys all the way. The A's last pennant was in 1990 and they lost their funding when owner Walter Haas died in 1995. From there comes the need to find underestimated (cheaper but still good) players. So how do you end the movie? I did not like the final choice, but then, I have nothing better to propose. Brad Pitt fills the screen and appears powerful without snobbery, as he should. The awkward Peter Brand adds a dimension to the film. It kept my interest and I know close to nothing in baseball. I love movies where people are at a disadvantage and crawl back.

4901689,4,B005X5XIF6,"Moneyball is about Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane's attempts to compete with MLB's teams who have higher payrolls. Moneyball is not a pure baseball film; it really is a business film that blends in aspects of baseball. And, I think it is less about the ""underdog"" taking on the big boys as it is coming up with a system of team's competing year in and year out with less money at their disposal. The divide between MLB's big market teams and small market teams has been an issue for years now, and so small market teams have had to be creative coming up with ways to compete. Without much money for ""big name"" stars, the Oakland A's have used a system, ""moneyball,"" to get undervalued players that will produce. The basic idea of moneyball is to use statistical analysis to understand the ""value"" of a player and use this as a means of getting high quality, underrated players. As technical and impersonal as this idea sounds, somehow the film handles it the right way.

To me, the film misses the mark by straying away from the ""moneyball"" premise sometimes. For one, they add in this whole subplot about Beane's relationship with his daughter, which is sort of distracting. Also, I think sometimes they don't go as deep into the moneyball concept as they could, and it becomes more of a focus on Beane being at odds with several Oakland A's scouts and Art Howe, the manager.

The casting was mostly good. I thought Brad Pitt did a pretty stellar job as the Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane; he seems to have his mannerisms down to a tee. (Although he is always eating; maybe being a general manager makes you very hungry). Jonah Hill does an excellent job as Peter Brand, who is the brains behind this entire moneyball system. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who has the look of Oakland A's manager Art Howe, isn't given much to work with from the script other than arguing with Beane most of the film or grimacing in pain (at Beane's ideas).

4901700,5,B005X5XIF6,"""Moneyball"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Billy Beane was once a would-be baseball superstar who, stung by the failure to live up to expectations on the field, turned his fiercely competitive nature to management. Heading into the 2002 season, Billy faces a dismal situation: his small-market Oakland A's have lost their star players (again) to big market clubs (and their enormous salaries) and is left to rebuild his team and compete with a third of their payroll. Driven to win, Billy takes on the system by challenging the fundamental tenants of the game. He looks outside of baseball, to the dismissed theories of Bill James, and hires Peter Brand, a brainy, number-crunching, Yale-educated economist. Together they take on conventional wisdom with a willingness to reexamine everything and armed with computer driven statistical analysis long ignored by the baseball establishment. They reach imagination-defying conclusions and go after players overlooked and dismissed by the rest of baseball for being too odd, too old, too injured or too much trouble, but who all have key skills that are universally undervalued. As Billy and Peter forge forward, their new methods and roster of misfits rile the old guard, the media, the fans, and their own field manager, who refuses to cooperate. Ultimately this experiment will lead not only to a change in the way the game is played, but to an outcome that would leave Billy with a new understanding that transcends the game and delivers him to a new place.

The cast led by Brad Pitt (terrific as Billy Beane, who also produced the film) & Jonah Hill (excellent as Peter Brand) is brilliant. The directing by Bennett Miller is brilliant. The story by Stan Chervin & the screenplay by Steven Zaillian & Aaron Sorkin is brilliant.

The music by Mychael Danna is brilliant. The cinematography by Wally Pfister is brilliant. The film editing by Christopher Tellefsen is brilliant. The casting by Francine Maisler is brilliant. The production design by Jess Gonchor is brilliant. The art direction by Brad Ricker & David Scott is brilliant. The set decoration by Nancy Haigh is brilliant.

4901732,4,B005X5XIF6,"Pros: I'm not going to say that I'm in love with Brad Pitt or anything, but... isn't he dreamy? Sadly, we aren't treated to any shirtless Brad, but he is shown working out a few times and is generally wearing form-fitting shirts. On the flip side, we are also not treated to any shirtless Jonah Hill, so... That's always appreciated. I don't really know anything about Billy Beane, but as far as I can tell, Pitt's character is how I would want Beane to be. He does a quality job of breaking out his dramatic chops of yesteryear while still including some of that boyish goofy charm that he has more recently developed. Speaking of acting, for all of you wondering what Jonah Hill's name is doing among the nominees for best supporting actor, please allay your fears. While I can't speak for every single supporting actor who appeared in a film in 2011, I can say that Hill's dramatic skills are indeed present, and I don't think he is misplaced with his nomination. He portrays the intellectual baseball nerd affably well (I didn't use ""affably"" correctly there, so don't bother looking it up to check me), and the only thing I would have liked more is if the movie had dived more deeply into the new age baseball metrics. But that's probably just the nerd side of me talking; I'm sure I don't speak for everyone.

Cons: Does Brad Pitt have a bet with someone about the number of times he can be seen eating on camera? Not just in this movie, but in all of his movies of late. And not just any food, but generally junk food that he's just shoveling into his mouth... Is he trying to brag about his metabolism or something? I don't really get it.

What I do get, however, is what a five tool player is. And I understood that after the first time those five tools were listed out. The next couple dozen listings weren't really necessary for me to grasp the concept. I suppose it's the point of the movie that baseball scouts and executives focus on the wrong things, but aren't there any other wrong things for them to focus on, other than fielding, running, throwing, hitting, and/or hitting with power?

And while we're at it, let's remember that we're talking about scouts who have been doing this thing for decades, and who have known those same five tools and been making the same assessments about kids for many years. Why do they need to stumble over their words? Shouldn't they know all this by now? I'm assuming there's a desire by some directors of ""true stories"" to have spoken lines be a little more clumsy and sputtered, because, you know, that's how real people talk. This makes me a little torn. Yes, I like realism. But at the same time, I go to the theaters in part to escape reality. If I want to listen to old men stumble over their words while they describe in broad, sweeping statements how good a ballplayer is, I'll go to the Polo Grounds. In the meantime, I'd like to watch these highly skilled actors deliver their lines with a greater degree of comfort (within their roles, of course), while I, as a responsible movie-goer, bear in mind that I am not, in fact, looking through a window on the real world.

While I'm not looking through a window at the real world, though, I am looking at a portrayal of it. And in this particular case, I'm looking at a portrayal of a baseball team that has been ""gutted."" Who did they lose again? Oh right, I should remember since they repeated the names Giambi, Damon, and Isringhausen even more often than the five tools mentioned previously. Even with this gutting, the A's still had the best starting rotation in baseball along with one of the elite shortstops in the game. And despite this flash back to reality, the screenwriters and director feel the need to hit you in the face with a dramatic 2x4 when you watch their movie.

Overall: That being said, the movie did suck me right in. It was well-made, with good pacing, compelling characters, an interesting enough story, and a thoroughly woven theme. And when some of the dialog wasn't awkwardly stuttered through, it was sharp and entertaining. Oh, did I mention the movie has Brad Pitt? I'm sheepishly giving it an 8 out of 10, while taking a step back to remind myself that I just saw a movie about generally managing a baseball team, not about curing cancer.",1362873600,,4281,4.525839793281654

4901741,4,B005X5XIF6,"If you're not a baseball fan, you're going to find Moneyball boring and a little bit confusing. I am an avid baseball fan and saw this film about the inner working of the front office to be extremely interesting and just plain awesome. The Oakland Athletics are a small market team and can't afford to put a hundred and fifty million dollar team of stars on the field every years, so how can they possibly compete? It's a problem faced by almost half the teams in Major League Baseball, while teams the Yankees and Red Sox win year after year, teams like Royals haven't made the playoffs in twenty-five years! In sports, if you can't win, you can't draw fans and make a profit, so when you can't afford a winning team, you were just screwed, until Moneyball. Based on the true story of Oakland Athletics General Manager, Billy Beane, the film follows his creation of a system to judge players on more than just the basic scouting and numbers that have been used for a hundred years. Using this system, Beane and others who followed, have been able to compete with much lower payrolls, changing the face of Baseball. Brad Pitt is terrific as Beane and most definitely earned his Oscar nominations, but where did Jonah Hill's come from? I love Jonah Hill, but his character was as generic and boring as they come. In Moneyball, Hill plays Brad Pitt's sidekick, and is nothing more than a boring statistician, I've seen B-Movie performances that upstaged his in this film! If you love sports and want to know more about the behind the scenes aspect of it, Moneyball is a terrific film to use, but if you're not much of a fan and don't really care about sports, that you will just find this film boring. It's geared to a very specific type of moviegoer and if you're not into sports, you won't be into Moneyball.",1361491200,,1808,4.549079754601227

4901749,5,B005X5XIF6,"If you didn't know already, this is a partial biopic of the real baseball general manager of the Oakland Athletics. As the manager of a small market franchise w/a comparatively modest budget, Billy Beane had to be creative and innovative in putting together a team...and he was. Brad Pitt is Billy Beane. I've seen Pitt perform superbly in some outstanding film roles and I've seen him perform only adequately in some mediocre films, but - and I know I'm going out on a limb here - I believe this is his penultimate role and his best performance. This film deserves all the hype and awards recognition it has garnered...it is a worthy competitor for the Best Picture Oscar and Pitt is a worthy nominee for Best Actor. Director Bennett Miller has been very selective about his work, but he has at least one other excellent film, ""Capote"", in his resume. With Miller's craftsmanship behind the camera; an intelligent screenplay by Steve Zallian and Aaron Sorkin; and Pit's outstanding work in front of the camera, this one had success written all over it before the first frame lit up the screen in the theater. Pitt also gets superb support from Jonah Hill, as the assistant general manager...a geekish Yale economics major who handles player research. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, also provides fine support as the team manager. I'm a baseball fan; but whether you're a fan or not, I think you'll enjoy this movie.

Rather than conform to the usual cliches that plague modern sports films, Moneyball is well-acted, smart, funny, sharp, and informative. It will almost certainly capture your interest, even if you aren't a baseball fan.

The cast is very strong, with Brad Pitt giving an exceptionally great, Oscar-nominated performance as out-of-the-box thinking baseball manager Billy Beane. I really couldn't take my eyes off him - it's definitely in the top 5 five performances in his illustrious career.
Critics also praise his performance saying: ""Pitt is mesmerizing - he's high-strung and laid-back all at once. It's an Oscar-worthy performance"", and, ""Pitt is terrific as the film's complex, driven protagonist.""

In the supporting cast Phillip Seymour Hoffman (Reuniting with director Bennett Miller after Capote) and Robin Wright (The Princess Bride) act as Art Howe and Casey Beane. Hoffman and Wright's performances are typically good and are generally beyond criticism, but the biggest surprise of the film is Jonah Hill, who plays a number-crunching Harvard graduate. Hill usually acts in comedies such as 21 Jump Street and Superbad, but after 2011 he has taken to more dramatic roles with Moneyball and Scorsese's upcoming The Wolf of Wall Street. He absolutely will blow you away in this film with his performance of surprising depth.

Equally surprising is how Moneyball appeals to both baseball fans and NON-baseball fans alike. I fall into the latter category, but I was just as riveted (and just as able to follow the baseball-related plot) as any fan of baseball.
Director Bennett Miller has achieved something quite extraordinary!

And although at it's core Moneyball IS a sports underdog story, it's one that's unpredictable and entertaining, not suffering from the usual cliched plot devices. Miller and screenwriters Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin have also woven in some fine human drama and sharp humour into the mix. It works effectively.

In conclusion, Moneyball is one of 2011's best films - an exceptionally well written, well acted, well filmed, well directed, informative, easy to watch, funny, dramatic baseball story, but one that concentrates more on the logistics of the game rather than the people who play it. It features a breakout role by Jonah Hill, and a damn good performance by Brad Pitt. This is must-watching for baseball fans and non baseball fans alike.

4901765,5,B005X5XIF6,"This is not a sports film. If anything, it reminds me more of ""Margin Call"" or ""Wall Street.""

This is a film about two people going against all odds. It's about their struggle to establish an identity and philosophy. We care more about what happens to them off the field than we do on the field.

This is probably Brad Pitt's finest performance. A lot of other well-deserving nominees were up that year, so I won't say he should have won the Oscar. But the nomination was earned.

If you are invested in characters and their story, then this film has a good amount of payoff. You will find the number crunching and negotiating ten times more interesting than what little baseball action there is. In fact, anyone going in expecting ""The Natural"" or ""A League of Their Own"" will be 1) disappointed and 2) missing out.

I couldn't quit watching this movie, I've seen it probably 5 times by now. Why? Was it because I love to sneak into the world of men and watch them negotiate and argue their way through? Yes, the negotiation scenes captivated me. Their arguments kept me on the edge of my seat. But, above all, the love for the game was finally real for me, in seeing the dogged determination it takes, along with intuitive gifts, to ""make it"" in ""the show"". Casting Brad Pitt as General Manager, as well as father of a young, gifted daughter was also a work of genius. The interactions as a parent were awe-inspiring. In the end, it is the protagonist's ethical view about what's wrong with the way the world of ""Moneyball"" works, that most impressed me.

This movie was nothing like them. Bradd Pitt plays a rather unfeeling human being who lives ,eats and breathes doing recruiting his way, regardless of whose feet get stepped on. He has the same schemer-con man personna that Tom Cruise had in Jerry Mucguire. No6t a likeable character in any way. His brainiac asst. was as boring as......well, most nerds who specialize in stats would figure to be. There was no zenith, no climax no ""feel good"" moment in this picture, and why was this movie so long? It felt like it was over 3 hrs to me. They say here its 233 minutes. Rhats 43 min too long. This film needed some editing very badly. Did they pay Bradd so much that they felt they had to get over 2 hrs from him for no other reason. The only thing I liked is that as a Forex trader, i liked how he showed that stats will beat feelings and intuition, every time.

The problem with this model, is that we would never follow our heart in making decisions. But either way, this was not really a role for Brad Pitt. It didn't fit him at all. Let me just say this, I took my girlfriend to this movie. The first movie we ever went to together. And when we left, she said nothing until we got in the car. That is not a good sign. Definitely not a womans picture! See it with the ""guys"" not with other couples. Bad acting, bad script, just too underwhelming for me. I would trade this whole movie for Kevin Costners movie where he is  saying ""God, I know you are busy, but if you would just make my shoulder stop hurting for 10 minutes I would really appreciate it.""

There's just enough of the later to make a point, but not enough to be boring. If you are nerdy enough, you can recognize things like the binomial distribution in his notes.

4901831,4,B005X5XIF6,"Moneyball is a great baseball movie that really isn't about baseball, sure it serves as the backdrop but it's more about Brat Pitt's character Billy Beane and what he had to do to stay competitive in the new era of huge-salary baseball. Based around the book by the same name, it follows Pitt and Jonah Hill (General Manager and Assistant General Manager, respectively) as they try to build a championship baseball team (the Oakland A's) with a payroll that is a fraction of what other big ball clubs are spending.

The biggest appeal of this film is the way Pitt and Hill interact. You believe the character's relationship as it goes from employer/employee to mentor/student to friends. It's not a buddy flick, but the two work well off each other, have some humorous moments and some deep conversations about life, risk, and their motives. They are likeable throughout and you begin to root for them without even realizing it, you want them to succeed. Both were nominated for Academy Awards for their performances.

Without going into the plot too much, it's interesting to watch the film and see how Pitt sticks to his guns despite massive initial scrutiny from his players, his head coach, and the media. Even Hill begins to question the path they are taking, but Pitt never wavers. Refusing to follow traditional baseball standards is what gets him in hot water...until he starts winning. This is when the film really takes off. The A's manage to start winning with a team of nobodies despite all reasonable expectations of what they would be able to accomplish.

The only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star review is the pacing and the sometimes muddled screenplay. I for one don't have a problem with the pacing of the film, but can see how some would think it a bit slow especially in the beginning. Also, like most things written by Aaron Sorkin, you are left occasionally saying ""Wait...what did they just say?"" Sometimes the dialog is hard to follow, most notably for me when Pitt is trading players in his office on the phone with other GM's. It's a scene where you know what just happened, but aren't sure how you got there.

All in all though, except for very minor gripes, this is a fantastic film. Solid acting and directing, a compelling true story, and no unnecessary film cliches like a tacked on love story or people fighting and making up in the last 15 minutes of the film in some grandiose final scene.

4901841,1,B005X5XIF6,"The story of MONEYBALL, the collision of quantitative information vs. the intuition of long-time baseball scouts, was interesting but Brad Pitt was absolutely flat in his performance as Billy Beane.  Who told the man he could act?  The extent of his acting was limited to tossing his too-long hair (a toupee?) around.  His lines were okay but would have been better if delivered by a decent actor.  And Jonah Hill was no better.  Was he actually told to show no emotion?  If so, he succeeded.  He didn't show nervousness (when he had to fire a person), joy (when his theory was validated) or surprise (when Billy hires him).  Frankly, he was a blivet.  A round face and glasses do not a character make.

I was shocked to read that Aaron Sorkin had co-written the script.  I've been a fan of his since SPORTS NITE and this was just not up to his usual standard.  WAAAY too many flashbacks to Billy's career, foolish use of Billy's 12 year old daughter and an irrelevant scene with his ex-wife and her husband......all of which lengthened the movie while adding nothing.

It may have seemed a good idea to use real people to play themselves but they couldn't act.  Every time such a ""real person"" appeared on screen, the movie stopped dead.  Plus, it made it all too obvious that this was a mish-mash of documentary and fiction - to neither's credit.

4901843,2,B005X5XIF6,"I am a big baseball fan and wanted to see this movie.  When I did, I was disappointed with it.  The set-up is great, a GM loses top-flight players and has to rebuild with virtually no money.  The movie had me for the first forty minutes or so and the scenes between Brad Pitt and Phillip-Seymour Hoffman were tense.  Unfortunately, the movie never picks up it stays at that same 'building up to something' speed. This movie never really leads to anything. The A's losing in the first round of the playoffs? And changing the way scouting is done in baseball is not a climax (a good story element though). Is it possible for a movie to be filled with more silence and characters reflecting than this one. Boorrring (good drama needs energy in order to validate the silences and reflection).  The movie also leaves out a couple of things: They make it out as if he was working with a AAA team, when in fact, the A's had the best starting staff in the AL at that time, they also fail to mention that they had the league MVP in Miguel Tejada. Despite the losses, they still had a good team.

One funny thing about this movie is when he says 'Defense is meaningless' and then they lose the playoffs because of an error. Defense is not meaningless in playoff baseball,Billy. That may explain why they've never won anything. The performances were good, but this movie could have used a lot more energy (and dialogue) that would kept me from wondering 'When is this over?'",1352073600,,1463,4.481203007518797

If you are an avid sports fan, you should enjoy this film. The story is about Billy Bean, general manager (and still is) of the Oakland A's. The story revolves around how a small market baseball team can ever compete with the big boys... ala New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox. An excellent story, it takes you through Billy's gamble to rethink and reinvent how baseball is done with respect to obtaining talent and value for it.

If you are a fan of baseball, this would be a must own. Since I am a fan of the Kansas City Royals, it also gives us ""poor folk"" a bit of sunshine and hope that we can again be competitive and not relegated to a glorified minor league franchise for the ""big boys"" to come and steal our talent away.

4901850,5,B005X5XIF6,"When I first saw that the run time of this movie was over two hours, I inwardly groaned. It seemed like a ridiculous indulgence to enlarge a movie to such a length, when its primary subjects are statistics and baseball (and I generally feel that two hours is too long for any movie). I'm delighted to report that I was wrong- this movie hums along at a brisk, invigorating pace that is incredibly engaging. When the movie approached its end, I mistakenly thought that it must have only been about halfway over- it's just that interesting.

They say that people who are not baseball fans can appreciate this movie. I can't confirm that opinion, since I'm a baseball fan myself, but I suspect that it's true. The reason being, the characters are fascinating, and the story is gripping. It's not just a typical sports movie, it's a study of economics, human beings, and one man's single-handed effort to transform the national pastime.

The acting is superb, with Pitt and Hill doing what they're paid to do (although each of them can come off as being a bit goofy at times). Even more impressive is Chris Pratt's role as an ailing Scott Hatteberg, in a performance that proves he can do more than just act the bumbling, lovable bufoon that he has so often been cast as. Finally, Arliss Howard does a freakishly good impression of John Henry.

4901865,5,B005X5XIF6,"Moneyball was a great movie about baseball, but from a fresh perspective. Really it was about money, and how money impacts the game and how you could use a different approach to picking players that would overcome the disadvantage of having less money then other clubs, like The Yankees.

Brad Pitt gave a great performance as General Manager of the under financed Oakland A's, Billy Beane. He passed up a full scholarship to Stanford for a career as a player in Major League Baseball, but it didn't work out and throughput the film pivotal moments are illuminated by flashbacks of his dashed hopes. Pitt conveys the frustrations and determination of Beane, a true maverick trying to cut against the grain of Major League Baseball. I rank this performance right up there with Fight Club for Mr. Pitt.

While trying to bag some players from the Cleveland Indians Billy Beane spots a talented analyst, a composite character named Peter Brand. The Cleveland management doesn't appreciate the young firebrand's ideas, but Beane knows talent when he sees it. He asks if perhaps he is someone's nephew, but finds that it is Brand's first job, not only in baseball, but his very first job of any sort since graduating from Yale with a degree in Economics. Jonah Hill was nominated for a well deserved supporting actor Oscar for his performance--an understated, dead pan performance that is still quite funny, but doesn't undercut the drama.

Phillip Seymour Hoffman blended into his role as A's coach Art Howe so well that I didn't even recognize him. Also notable was Kerris Dorsey as Billy's daughter Casey Beane. I recognized her from the TV drama Brothers  & Sisters. Finally, Chris Pratt, from TV comedy Parks & Recreation, was outstanding in his field as Scott Hatteberg, one of the underrated players, chosen for his ability to get on base--even if he has to walk to get there. All the supporting cast rang very true, like it was a documentary but with better lighting.

The movie grabbed me right from the beginning and wouldn't let go, even though I am not really much of a baseball fan. Like the people it depicts, this film was a real game changer. It was the first baseball film to be nominated for best picture since Field of Dreams 22 years ago.",1347926400,,2252,4.778920308483291

4901870,5,B005X5XIF6,"For anyone interested in acting as a craft, Philip Seymour Hoffman as coach Art Howe steals the show, with Jonah Hill as Peter Brand doing an amazing job of creating Brad Pitt's statistical analyst and assistant. Brad Pitt as the Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane gives an excellent performance but, like any Hollywood superstar, he never really stops being himself. Hoffman by comparison plays the Oakland A's coach to the point of losing himself in his character; we don't see Hoffman playing Howe, we see Art Howe. (Or at least a film character called Art Howe. The real life Howe doesn't like how he is portrayed in the film or the book.) The film offers a good example of the difference between excellent performing (Pitt) and excellent acting (Hoffman) and this would be enough to really like this film.

But for a film lover there's more. Most of the dialogue is natural with very few dramatic one-liners; for tension, the director relies more on understated exchanges filled with the empty words that make up the conversations all of us have in daily life. There isn't much incidental music to artificially create moods, again the director relies on natural effects. If French director Eric Rohmer had ever directed a commercial American film, this is what he would have done. But don't let this scare you-- Moneyball isn't an art house film, it's a commercial film made with a few techniques borrowed from minimalist avant-garde directors.

Another pleasant surprise is that I liked the movie better than I liked the book, even though I loved the book and read it years before seeing the movie. Maybe it's because I had no expectations this would ever be made into a movie, or if it did that it would be made into a documentary. Instead, director Bennett Miller did what Philip Kaufman did with Tom Wolfe's The Right Stuff: he took a factual book and turned it into a dramatic film.

One word of warning: sport fans might find themselves disappointed at seeing players and plays relegated to the background of a story focused on numbers, statistics, and economics. But that is the point of the movie; where traditionalists argue that baseball is a human game involving hunches, intuition, performance and tense dramatic field plays, the film argue that results come from more abstract considerations. Baseball is really about thinking.

4901882,5,B005X5XIF6,"While I knew Brad Pitt had plenty of fans, I had never understood why he had such a strong following until I sat down and watched this movie.  Having read the book and already familiar with the story the movie is based on, I just couldn't get over how convincing of a performance Pitt turned in.  He really adds a personal and emotional depth that even the best written books can't fully convey.  While Jonah Hill and Phillip Seymour Hoffman are also extremely well cast for their respective roles, Pitt is definitely the straw that stirs the drink in this one.  I can't imagine any other actor pulling off the part the way he did.  It helps if you like the game of baseball, but anybody who has experienced times in life where the desire to fulfill one's own goals intersects and/or collides with the pressure of meeting the demands and often carrying the burden of expectations of so many others one has to deal with on an everyday basis in life will relate well to the lead character's relentless pursuit to do it his way in the face of so much intense scrutiny and criticism from every direction.

From scenes ranging between being brutally honest in face to face confrontations with stubborn members of his staff, outmaneuvering others in his peer group in hastily arranged trade discussions, to trying to mask his anxieties and stress in an effort to make the most of what little time away from his job he could get with his young daughter who's sensing the strain he's dealing with, Pitt's portrayal of Billy Beane under siege is somebody nearly any viewer can have an understanding of and even empathy for.  While the film ends with Pitt's often embattled character left feeling he'd fallen short of what he'd hoped to achieve and unsure of what tough choices to make next, I couldn't help but continue to pull for him to keep trying as the screen went black and the credits began to roll.

While there's certainly going to be more movies made with one sport or another as a backdrop to the story's premise, there won't be many that explore how determined someone's will has to be to challenge the system while being trapped deep inside it as Moneyball has.  Brad Pitt really raised the bar here.  This was a tough one to get right, and he nailed it.  He should have gotten the best actor award for Moneyball because there won't be another performance that stays with people like his does for quite a long time.",1345334400,,2419,4.576388888888889

It is the story of Oakland Athletics' General Manager, Billy Beane, who employs a radical economics based system of player selection to lead his small market team in search of the Holy Grail of World Series glory.  The story is intriguing and, to a large extent, true.  The acting is superb.  Brad Pitt plays the role of Beane well and Jonah Hill is convincing as the Yale-educated economist who crunches the numbers to select the players that can bring wins to Oakland.

4901884,4,B005X5XIF6,"Professional sports in America (and more recently elsewhere as well) has always been about making money, making money for the owners, making money for the players, and making money for the inevitable ten-percenters that come around whenever the smell of money  is in the air. Professional big time sports, moreover is about big money, real big money as this slice of sports management film, Moneyball, amply demonstrates. But it is also, at some level, depending on the sport, the team, and the guys who put together such teams about winning, winning the brass ring. And that is what makes this film that I would probably pass over on other grounds so intriguing

Frankly it has been a while since I have even summoned the courage to watch sports on television much less attend some event in person. And that takes some doing in a city like Boston which over the past decade or so has won championships in all of the four major sports in America (baseball, football, basketball, hockey for the very clueless). And the main reason for that stance is the point I made above about the money pit. But it also about the obscene price of the winning that has distorted the legitimate role of sports in society way out of kilter. Winning and winning merely by overwhelming out-spending the other guys seems to have diminished my capacity to watch  guys who are mostly going through the motions.

But Moneyball, and the story behind it presents another story, a story that I could actually relate to. What if you just, strapped for cash and in a minor franchise market, used every available method, including technology to build a team not of hot shots (although they are nice to see) but of guys who could stand to be together in the same room for more than fifteen minutes. That seemed like a premise worth trying.

And that premise gets a tryout here as Billy Beane (played by Robert Redford, oops, Brad Pitts), as the general manager of the Oakland As (a team that back in the glory days, back in the Reggie, Catfish, Sal, Blue Moon, et. al days,  back in the early 1970s when I lived there, I followed like crazy), a wonk from Yale and a recalcitrant manger (played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman) work their magic, and work it almost to that final game of the year. The one that in the end is the only one that counts. But, except maybe in horseshoes, almost doesn't count doesn't mean a thing so it in the end is back to the drawing board to work out the missing links. Nice try though, nice premise, and nice sports film even for non-sports nuts.",1344902400,,2542,4.5758241758241756

4901886,3,B005X5XIF6,"Moneyball is an entertaining enough film about how Billy Beane, general manager of the Oakland Athletics (one of the poorest teams in baseball), decided to choose players based on their stats rather than scouts' opinions. The scouts are horrified by the players he selects, dismissing them as old or trouble makers or simply not good enough. After several false starts the team starts winning and ends the regular season on a triumphant note.

Pitt gives a great performance as Beane and the acting throughout is good. The first problem is that the film is very sluggish to get going and spends so much time setting the scene that when we get to the action, it's uncomfortably close to the end of the film and the viewer feels a tad cramped. I learned after watching the movie that the initial director was fired the day before shooting started, in part because of problems over the script. So a repair job had to be done and the end result isn't bad. The other problem is that the Athletics lost in the post-season and have not won a World Series since.

4901905,5,B005X5XIF6,"Billy Beane has a problem.  As general manager for the cash-strapped Oakland A's, Beane is having a hard time recruiting quality players, mainly because, with the limited budget the owner has given him to work with, he can't possibly compete with the multimillion dollar contracts being proffered by A-tier teams like the Yankees and the Red Sox.  To add insult to injury, those teams keep pilfering the few decent players Beane's already got.  Into the breach steps Peter Brand, a  23-year-old numbers-cruncher straight out of Yale who's devised a complex algorithm out of players' statistics that will allow recruiters to focus in on the less obviously flashy - and thereby far less expensive - players whom the Big Boy franchises have managed to overlook.  The skeptics question the wisdom and efficacy of reducing team-building to mere mathematic formulas and science, but Brand's method winds up working so well that it forever revolutionizes the way major league baseball teams recruit their players.

Based on the 2003 book by Michael Lewis, with screenplay by Steve Zaillion and Aaron Sorkin and direction by Bennett Miller, ""Moneyball"" provides a literal inside-baseball glimpse into the inside of baseball.  In many ways, ""Moneyball"" is a kind of grownup version of ""The Bad News Bears"" and every other tale of a coach who pulls together a motley crew of misfits and second-stringers and, against all odds, transforms them into a winning team. The difference is that this story has actual history behind it, recounting the 2002 season in which the A`s won a record 20 games in a row (yet still lost in the playoffs).  Plus, the movie finds its drama more in the behind-the-scenes wrangling among the highly skeptical managers, owners, coaches and staff than in the action on the field (indeed, most of the ballpark scenes appear as grainy clips from actual games).  The intelligent screenplay avoids most of the clichs inherent in the genre - and those it doesn't avoid it somehow manages to make seem fresh and vital again.  The writing also adds depth and dimension to Beane's character by occasionally flashing back to his own somewhat underwhelming career as a player in the big leagues, showing how that disappointment helped to mold him into the man he is today.

Despite the sterling quality of the writing and direction, ""Moneyball"" is clearly an actors' picture, and the filmmakers have recruited a first-rate cast to carry out the drama (I wonder if they used a similar algorithm for that). Brad Pitt has probably never been better than he is here as the Quixotic visionary who's such a bundle of nerves that he can't even bring himself to watch his own games.  A mixture of pragmatist and romantic when it comes to the game of baseball, Beane is the perfect person to serve as iconoclast for a game whose roots lie deep in the American psyche but a game that has lost its way in recent times with its huge salaries and uncompetitive money advantages among teams.  Jonah Hill is excellent as Brand, as is Philip Seymour Hoffman as Art Howe, the A's highly skeptical and understandably disgruntled manager, who initially balks at what he believes is the disastrous direction in which Beane is taking the team.  Chris Pratt (""Everwood,"" ""Parks and Recreation"") and Kerris Dorsey (""Parenthood"") also score in small but important roles.

There's drama and suspense aplenty in this film, with literal edge-of-the-seat excitement generated by its re-creation of the nail-biting 20th game that got the A`s into the record books.  But ""Moneyball"" never overplays its hand, never indulges in corny melodramatics or cheap sentiment to win us over to its side.  In fact, it is its very restraint and subtlety - both in performance and execution - that draws us so deeply into the tale it's telling.",1340668800,4,3807,4.97007874015748

(I think Pitt must have recognized the neurotic Hollywood mogul in Billy Beane.) Jonah Hill was very good in it, too.

I can't say enough about this movie - I highly recommend it. The movie shows how Beane was able to conquer his own MLB demons and turn them into something positive.",1339891200,,451,4.567901234567901

The film offers flashbacks to Beane's playing time, a kid with great potential but had failed to measure up to the big leagues.  This seemed to influence Beane's decision to play the percentages rather than become overly enamored with a ball player's swing or the crack of the bat.  Beaneball, as it would come to be called, worked predominantly with on-base percentages, driving scouts and manager Art Howe up the wall.  There are a lot of nice personal touches in the film, such as Beane's relationship to his 12-year-old daughter and his attempts to reach out to his players when the A's were in a big slump.

4901909,3,B005X5XIF6,"This movie was nowhere near as good as they said it was. Sure, it sounds good on paper, when you read the reviews, the preface, the plot, the 'synopsis', but the movie itself... it's, uh, good, but only good.

Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane (A lot of thought must have gone into that name), a failed baseball player who becomes a highly regarded manager. However his team, the Oaklands A's are at the bottom of the team ladder, and they are under threat for survival in the league. With a name like the A's they very much deserve to be out of the competition, but anyway.

There's a lot of scenes where old men (selectors) sit around a table talking about who had a good swing, commanding posture and all, and then Billy Beane just starts yelling at them like Brad Pitt is still in his 'Inglorious Bastards' character, or maybe he's trying to be Tom Cruise in 'A Few good men'. Then Jonah Hill's stereotypically nerdy character comes along with a way of determining who has good 'stats'. Billy then tries to put a team together based on the stats - much to the chagrin of the old selectors. It's like tradition versus the new way of doing things. Eventually Billy starts putting his team together. At first they lose, but after a while they win. All that stuff is interesting, worth the hype.

But about half-way through there's a diversion - an unheralded diversion that no critic warned you of - that delves into Billy Beane's private life. There's all these scenes where he drives around in his car looking sad and sometimes thumping the steering wheel. Then there's meeting his ex-wife's new man, who starts talking about what 'improvements' can be made to the daughter's up-bringing, which is when Billy recites the line, yes you guessed it 'She's MMYYY daughter' - which is all fine and good, except that it's a line that has been in every stinkin movie for the past ten years, like 'Thank you for smoking' and 'The Weatherman;. And watching him spending that 'quality time' with his (predictably 'troubled') daughter... whew! that's just cringe inducing.

Towards the end Billy is having all these emotional episodes, which seem forced. You get the impression he's 'had it' with baseball, he's over it. That's hardly a good sign, seeing this is a 'baseball' movie. But right at the end the manager of another team tells him some good news, and you realise 'it was all worth it in the end' - which is kind of like watching this movie, you get some brilliant moments, your bad bits, but it was all worth it in the end; although Pitt is intent on playing his characters neurosis to the end.",1338681600,,2591,4.6017316017316015

Otherwise, you will be confused and will likely miss out on a lot of the dialogue.

I enjoy movies that are based on true stories, and when I finished watching this movie, I immediately did a Google search for the main characters and events that were portrayed in the movie. I was happy to find lots of additional information related to the movie. However, as with most (or all) movies, it is not 100% accurate to what happened in real life.

All in all, I think the acting was very good, and the movie was entertaining. I have not read the book yet (although I plan to eventually), but I would recommend watching Moneyball to anyone that has been on the fence about it (as I was, after originally passing on it when it came out in theaters).",1338336000,,988,4.364130434782608
4901911,4,B005X5XIF6,"I watched Moneyball as a Liverpool FC follower. Having been over-run, sorry, taken over by the owners of the Boston Red Sox I could see far more clearly the mindset being introduced into UK soccer. Is the current Swansea manager Brad Pitt or is it the current Wigan manager? The Brad Pitt character stays with his small team.

I could also get a better sense of why Kenny Dalglish was sacked. The storyline about cutting players from the team could have been part of the Dalglish demise. Early on in the film player marketability is shown to be foolish. Facets of baseball playing technique or even his looks were overriding the key element of scoring more points than the other team. In some soccer conversations the way a team plays is more important than winning. Strange.

Okay I struggled with the implications behind playing on first base. I could only recall Abbott and Costello's brilliant `Who's on first base' routine. And it was only during the end of the credits that I realised the players names are real players. But the fundamental alteration in mindset in the dressing room and with the coaching staff was easy to follow. And after Man City's dramatic last minute capture of the Premiership, the Oakland Athletic rise and then nearly fall on the last hit of the bat thing was eerily pertinent.

I would also say that after seeing this film there is no chance of a new Anfield stadium being built. My preference, and I know this is controversial, would be for a ground share with Everton. It makes the most sense. It cuts out sentiment and romance. Funding much easier from Europe and UK government. It's daft having two passed their sell by date stadia so close together in the same city.

I must make it clear that Moneyball centres on winning. Million dollar baseball players who are unperturbed by losing a game were `traded' or let go. This I do like. Money and sport have always had a shy relationship. Unless you are a winner.",1338163200,,1948,4.65406976744186

The movie explains how ball players are overlooked by Major League Baseball for a variety of of biased reasons and perceived flaws, how other ball players (including Billy Beane) were made first round draft picks based on the same biased perceptions and unthinking prejudices rooted in baseball's traditions, and how Beane, as GM of the Oakland A's, was determined to not use the same old methodology to draft his players.

This is also a movie about how a guy (Beane) in a management position of a small-market business reframed a problem and then went about solving it.  Beane recognized that the amount of money you have is less important than how you spend it, and he figured out how to spend his money to maximize the efficiency of his dollars.

Moneyball is my favorite story.  I take the book on every airplane ride, I listen to the audiobook on my commute, and my boyfriend bought me the movie when it came out on DVD (we also saw it in the theater).  I never tire of this story.

The viewer might want to keep in mind that this movie is a fictionalized version of the book, and the book is also probably under the genre of literary nonfiction.  But I don't mind the movie's deviations from the book too much (e.g. Jonah Hill's chubby character Peter Brand in place of diet-conscious Paul De Podesta, Brad Pitt's maybe-overly-sympathetic portrayal of Beane as a genius in the clubhouse and a stand-up guy everywhere else, Philip Seymour Hoffman's unflattering portrayal of Art Howe, etc).  These deviations don't remove too much from the story, or, in the case of Hill's character, the deviation adds to the message of the story, and the story is really why I like this movie/book/audiobook.  I can see how the still-alive people involved in this story might be annoyed at the director, though.

The movie had a few moments of humor that my boyfriend and I laughed at in the theater (e.g. ""This is how we do business in Cleveland.""; Billy: ""Would you rather get a bullet to the head or five to the chest and bleed to death?"", Peter: ""Are those my only options?""; One scout: ""Who is Fabio?""  Other scout: ""He's a shortstop.  He's the shortstop from Seattle."").  Throughout the movie, the interactions and dialogue ring true (Billy: ""If he's such a good hitter, why don't he hit good?"").

Highly recommended.",1335830400,5,2511,4.753456221198157

4901930,5,B005X5XIF6,"Last season after 20 years in the doldroms the Pittsburgh Pirates with a collection of little knowns on their roster found themselves in first place in the National League Central Division shortly after the All Star Break.  I was rooting for them to succeed except at the expense of my beloved Phillies.  Alas the dream was not to be as the Bucs wilted in the heat of the pennant race.  While their success lasted it was good for baseball.  Whether you are a large market team or small you break from spring training with the intention of winning the whole ball of wax.  If you are a Kansas City Royals fan you don't want to be told that your team doesn't have a chance from Jump Street.  As the baseball adage goes a season is a marathon not a sprint.  ""Moneyball"" starts after the 2001 campaign where the Oakland A's fall short in the American League Championship Series.  The small market A's are losing their star players for greener pastures and paychecks.  General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) asks the owner of the A's for more money to attract suitable replacements.  The money is not forthcoming.  Beane, not willing to throw in the towel, decides to think outside the box.  With the assistance of Yale economist Peter Brandt (Jonah Hill) they reconstruct the team with modestly priced players who compliment each other.  Is this fluorish enough to win the World Series?  Baseball fans already know the answer and novices would be behooved to find out.  The thing I admire most about ""Moneyball"" is it's affinity for our national pastime.  Sure the film has it's share of aracana and statistics but it gets everything right from the crack of the bat to the calls to sportstalk radio.  Pitt is charismatic as the wheeler-dealer Beane.  You believe he can charm a decent utility player from another team for one of his skirt chasing headaches.  Hill is every geeks dream.  He gets to play fantasy baseball with the Real McCoy!  Philip Seymour Hoffman is effectively taciturn as manager Art Howe who has to sink or swim with the machinations of Beane.  There has been much debate whether this is the greatest baseball film of all time.  That would be unfair to ""Moneyball"" or ""Field of Dreams"" or ""Pride of the Yankees"".  They are all quite different films that have baseball as a subtext.  As a fan of forty years it's impossible for me to say if the movie is accessible to non-fans.

All the acting was great and as a true story it really hit home as I remember those years and the film showed us what many of us didn't know at that time.

The final part with his daughter singing was great and showed Billy cared more about just about everything except getting a huge paycheck which is very refreshing nowadays as most only care about how much money they make....Billy proved he cares more about family, ethics, morals and community then he did about money...

4901937,3,B005X5XIF6,"Being a lifelong A's fan I was fascinated exactly as to how Brad Pitt (oops, Brapi playing A's general manager Billy Beane) rebuilt the team in 2002 and got them back into the playoffs after losing three key players (including 2000 American League Most Valuable Player Jason Giambi) to free agency from the 2001 playoff team using a sabremetric (basically, a unique statistical method of evaluating player performance) strategy dubbed ""Moneyball"" by the author Michael Lewis who wrote the book of the same name that the movie is based on.

Now, if this sounds too much like fantasy baseball, it kind of is. So, if you're not a sports fan who is interested in the behind-the-scenes machinations of how players are drafted, how trades are made and the inner workings of a baseball franchise, this is probably not the movie for you. There are long stretches where it seems like a lot of talking is going on and not much game action.

The actual game footage spliced into the movie footage works great. It does capture the thrill of the A's record 20 consecutive win streak during that season. Yet, like the book, the movie overlooks two major factors that have nothing to do with this Moneyball approach. Firstly, is although ex-Giants shortstop Royce Clayton plays that season's AL MVP Miguel Tejada, a holdover from the 2001 team, he's barely a footnote in the story onscreen. Secondly, the A's starting pitching troika of Mike Mulder, Barry Zito and Tim Hudson were huge in the A's 2000-2003 playoff run. In fact, they were arguably one of the best starting pitching staffs in recent MLB history. You do see Hudson a bit in the movie, but the other two are not mentioned at all.

Also, there was a lot of artistic license as Jeremy Giambi and Carlos Pena end up being traded on the same day for dramatic effect. The reality was Giambi was traded on May 22, 2002, and Pena was dealt July 5. Also, when Pitt discusses picking up submarining relief pitcher Chad Bradford at his meeting with the team's scouts prior to the 2002, I half expected some scout to tell Pitt that Bradford was already on the team. The A's acquired him in 2001.

The fictional Ivy League educated stat wizard Peter Brand (played brilliantly low key by Jonah Hill) in the movies joins the A's in 2002 as Beane's righthand man. The real-life Paul DePodesta, whom the fictional Brand is based on, actually joined the A's in 1999.

Also, the movie seems a bit unfair to A's manager Art Howe (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman). Howe led the A's to three straight playoff appearances. He may have been old school but did he really butt heads that much with Beane over lineup choices? Maybe he did but how about giving Howe a bit of credit for that 20-game winning streak as well. I'm pretty sure some of his managerial moves helped that streak along.

OK, that's the nitpicking as an A's fan. Moneyball is still a terrific movie in showing how a small market team with a very low budget could compete with the likes of the deep pockets New York Yankees et al. The search for undervalued players was spot on and how Beane faced off against the old school style of scouting and evaluating players. The hero of the movie, Scott Hatteburg, a catcher turned first baseman, did prove to be of good value and a bargain to boot. Yet like the book, the movie makes too much of a case that the Moneyball way of finding undervalued assets led to the A's success in 2002. Moneyball was just part of the winning formula as having an MVP (Tejada) and those three great pitchers were major factors in the streak. Still it's pretty compelling to watch the streak unfold on the big screen.

The extras have a terrific behind-the-scenes look at how the movie was made with Major League Baseball's full cooperation in helping the baseball scenes in actual MLB ballparks look as real as possible right down to the era's uniforms. There's also a good discussion on the whole Moneyball theory with Billy Beane adding his own insight.

Lastly, for trivia buffs, you have got to love the framed Clash posters in Beane's office. Who wouldn't love a baseball GM into punk rock from his era?",1334102400,2,4130,4.632513661202186
4901938,5,B005X5XIF6,"I really fell in love with this one. With the advent of instant global communication and the wealth of information that's available at the speed of thought today, the focus of our collective interest in sports has shifted and deepened. While the contests will always be the main focus, rightly, there's also a sweeping undercurrent of interest in the games behind the games. Player swaps, contract negotiations, deep statistical analysis; these are as formidable an arsenal for the modern team as a bat and glove, and it's about time Hollywood made the effort to examine that fundamental shift. Moneyball does it exceptionally well, delving into the theories and risks behind this new way of thinking without going too far into the realm of obsessive over-explanation. As the team's roster and strategies begin to change shape and coalesce, the film shifts into something larger than a mere underdog sports story, interpersonal drama or heady mathematical essay. It's all of those things and more, with an ambitiously large toolbox and the confident knowledge of how to most efficiently use each implement: an evolution of sports-themed material on film. It's the rare film that non-fans can enjoy just as much as season ticket holders, and a justified candidate for the Oscars' top honor.",1334102400,,1289,5.142857142857143

The movie adapts Michael Lewis's 2003 book of the same name and is the story of how Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane took the team from the sound of losing to the roar of winning. Brad Pitt plays Beane and Jonah Hill plays assistant GM Peter Brand, and both were masterfully casted for the roles.

I've heard the endless criticism that Brad Pitt is successful only because he's a pretty boy, and I have to ask: what the heck is that all about? Pitt is excellent in Moneyball and at times I felt like I was watching a video documentary of the actual Oakland A's back-office for most of the movie. Pitt can act, and Hill seamlessly stepped away from comedy for this dramatic role. The rest of the cast was great too; I thought that Philip Seymour Hoffman really was A's Manager Art Howe.

The movie runs a little long at about 2 and a quarter hours, but the time went fast and it felt shorter than that. So that's a good thing. There's really not a lot more to say here other than to reiterate that what may seem like a boring movie on the surface is actually an uplifting, compelling movie that entertained me from start to finish.

4901949,4,B005X5XIF6,"As a confirmed baseball junkie, I really wanted to see this movie when in was in theaters, but had to wait for the DVD release. I was generally familiar with the back story (although as I watched it wondered how I had managed to forget the improbable winning streak that takes this film towards it climax), and I'm also familiar with some of the criticism for the liberties this movie may (or may not) have taken with actual facts.

Forget about all that. If you're a baseball fan, you will almost certainly love this movie...and you'll love it even more if you're the fan of a small-market team that's not the Yankees or the Red Sox (and are exhausted with the adoration of those franchises as staples of prime-time TV offerings). If you're not a baseball fan, you can still expect to enjoy this story of Billy Beane (Bradd Ptt), former big-leaguer and, in 2001, general manager of the cash-strapped Oakland A's. How cash-strapped are they? The players have to pay for sodas from a vending machine in the clubhouse (and during a later trade, Beane asks for soda supplies in partial compensation for a player).

After the A's lose in the playoffs to the Yankees and three major players leave, Beane must find a way to rebuild his roster. An encounter with a new Cleveland Indians employee and Bill James statistics disciple Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) sets the wheels in motion for Beane to adopt a stat-based approach to finding the best players.

The metrics create tension with his current scouting staff, most of whom are played by themselves and who are shown frequently including many other ""intangibles"" (including the attractiveness of a player or his girlfriend) in their calculations of player potential. It also creates tension with field manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman, whose range is rapidly making him one of my favorite actors).

Pitt as Beane shows us a man who is alternately cutthroat, competitive, calculating, superstitious...and then suddently contemplative as he gains buy-in and attention for the unlikely success of his low-budget approach to managing major league talent (and opportunities to to move on to other opportunities).

As the film closes and Brand and Beane are contemplating their system, Brand shows Beane footage of one one of their minor league players who is under-regarded because of his weight and apparently scared to death of running beyond first towards second base. If you watch this scene without a lump in in your throat: well, you might be a human being, but your are certainly NOT a baseball fan.

But to be paid millions of dollars to basically play a game? I'm more concerned that the guy cleaning out the septic tank gets paid better than an athlete. Which one would you rather depend on?

This brings us to the new release MONEYBALL. Brad Pitt stars in this real life story of Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics in 2001. The A's have just lost their three best players to teams that could afford to pay them higher salaries. The home office just doesn't have the money to compete with bigger cities that offer bigger paychecks. So how can a team that spends close to $30 million compete with a team that costs $130 million?

Billy finds the answer by sheer chance. While discussing possible trades in Cleveland he watches as the head men keep deferring to a fresh looking young guy named Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). Cornering him later on Brand explains to him that teams far too often look for players rather than points. They seek out and pay stars for their attraction quotient but never look to see if they can justify their salaries with their abilities. Brand believes that a great team could be made of semi-decent players, but players who score runs.

Beane embraces the idea much to the consternation of the talent scouts and the team's coach Art Howe (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). He bypasses their recommendations and instead puts together a team based on stats that Peter puts together for him. In so doing he believes the team may have no major stars but they will have a winning season. Too bad everyone attempts to stop him rather than go along.

Beane and Howe butt heads as to who will play where and when. Eventually Beane puts Howe into a position where he has no option but to place the players he wants where he wants them. That's when the team suddenly begins to win and win big going so far as to break previous records of consistent wins.

Based on the book of the same name, MONEYBALL is an interesting film about a subject that along with apple pie is near and dear to the hearts of most American's, baseball. We romanticize about the players; we celebrate the victories and losses of our favorite teams. But how many people actually consider what it takes to put together a winning team? That is the main subject behind this film.

But it's more than discussing the choice of winning versus the romantic notion of pure athleticism that makes us love the game. The movie is about a man pushed into a corner who needs to find a way to bring home a winning team without being able to spend the money that bigger cities can afford and who more or less succeeds in doing so. After Beane went on to create this format other teams followed with more success.

Brad Pitt is an actor that could easily fall back on his good looks and make movies that offer little depth but plenty of eye candy for the ladies. Instead he takes risks now and then with movies that show he is a better actor than many would give him credit for. The subtle style he offers here as Beane makes you believe you are watching the man instead of an actor portraying him and that's the sign of an actor worth watching.

Hill steps out of the comic foil he's played in nearly every movie he's ever made. Instead he's the straight man here, the character (based on several real life individuals) that comes up with the plan that just might save the A's. He never gives this performance the same old styling that he's used before, instead making this character as believable as Pitt's Beane.

You don't have to be a baseball fanatic to enjoy this movie but it wouldn't hurt. More action takes place off the field than on. In any event what you will end up with is an evening's entertainment that is worth the effort to take the movie home. Not only will you want to consider renting this one, it might actually be worth adding to your collection. I know I'll be watching it more than once.",1332201600,,4073,4.48582995951417

Rating: 2.5

  In many respects, 'Moneyball' is not any different from most 'baseball' movies that place the national pastime on its ubiquitous, saccharine pedestal. That can be expected. Where 'Moneyball' differs, is that it seeks to invite a new 'player' to the table--the computer geek. Now all the aspiring Bill Gates' of the world can take a seat with the battle-scarred, beer-swilling veterans, who've been analyzing the game for years, utilizing an intuition grounded in their 'gut' perceptions, instead of a set of statistics, organized by a computer program. This is the basic premise of Brad Pitt's overrated Academy Award nominated film, which is more about the business of baseball, than the game itself.

  For awhile, the story of Billy Beane, the former mediocre baseball player turned general manager of the Oakland A's baseball team, proves to be fairly interesting. After failing to beat the NY Yankees in the first round of the playoffs in 2001, the owner of the As gives Beane an ultimatum: win the World Series next year, but with a vastly reduced budget (as the A's principal players, such as Jason Giambi, have been traded away). Beane meets with his staff of scouts (played by former professional baseball players and scouts), who lend a real air of credibility to the proceedings. That group appears to be clueless and sends Beane in search of a new approach to resolve his quandary of finding underrated baseball talent, without the aid of the big bucks.

  While attempting to negotiate a trade with the Cleveland Indians, Beane discovers a low level Indian employee, statistician Peter Brand, a Yale graduate, who picks players by means of sophisticated computer analysis (Brand is a composite character based primarily on Beane's real-life top assistant, Paul DePodesta, who refused permission to use his name in the film). Geeky Jonah Hill plays Brand, and for half of Act 2, he advises Beane on which bargain basement players to trade for. Brand looks primarily at 'on base percentage' and Beane (with Brand in tow) makes a house call , on one occasion, to fading major league catcher, Scott Hatteberg, asking him whether he'd be interested in converting to playing first base (the answer is of course, affirmative!). Beane manages to pick up more bargains, including submarine hurler, Chad Bradford, with the aid of Brand, and by the time spring training rolls around, Beane is confident that his motley crew, can compete against the more financially endowed teams, including their ultimate nemesis: the Yanks!

  The drama (and one's interest), only lasts for a little while longer. There's an effective scene where Beane comes into conflict with his scouting crew, who resent the presence of Brand, and his disdain for their 'intuition'. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, manages to acquit himself nicely as A's manager, Art Howe, who doesn't like Beane telling him how to manage his team (but his part is all too brief). Sadly, the narrative eventually has nowhere to go, as there's virtually no additional interesting enough conflict, which propelled the characters so fitfully along, in the film's first half. The A's 20 game winning streak is attributed to Brand's highly questionable miracle system (it should be noted that the A's still had some 'big money' holdovers, such as pitchers Zito and Hudson, who were not selected as a result of Brand's machinations). Brand has little to do in the second half of the film, except act as Beane's glorified cheerleader, with Beane, now wheeling and dealing on his own, sometimes acting outside the purview of his brainiac assistant. Nonetheless, the film's scenarists afford the geeky Brand, with his own hagiography, now allowed to sit at the table with 'the big boys'.

  Without a doubt, 'Moneyball' has perhaps the most anti-climactic climax, in recent film history. Not only do the A's fail to make the first round of the Division playoffs but we're told that Beane is still trying to earn his first World Series ring. Even more embarrassing (and this is supposed to be impressive), we're told that the Red Sox, utilizing Beane and Brand's statistical approach, win their first World Series since 1918, a couple of years later. Beane's consolation prize is thus held up as some kind of great victory for humanity!

  'Moneyball' is one of the few baseball films, that refuses to fictionalize the characters they are portraying. Unfortunately, we learn next to nothing about any of them, except for the fact that they have hearts of gold (again, as to be expected). Some time is spent portraying the aging David Justice, as a surly, 'non-team' player. But after a pep talk from Beane, he agrees to 'step up to the plate', and provide guidance to the 'younger players', who soon come together and accomplish the miracle 20 game winning streak.

  All-Star writers Sorkin and Zaillian fall flat in attempting to infuse Beane's character, with a meaningful internal arc. Beane must not only overcome his past failure as a player (which we see in a series of flashbacks), but also must bond with his teenage daughter. Beane's nobility is undercut by such pretentious pronouncements as ""money is not important"", even though he's portrayed as a ruthless wheeler dealer, who uses shady tactics to gain an advantage over his rivals. According to Beane, introducing the new dry world of statistics, is what he wants to be remembered for, not earning a World Series ring.

  'Moneyball' must also contend with the additional deficit of another 'phone in' Brad Pitt performance. No matter how hard he tries, Pitt invariably cannot play anyone but Brad Pitt. Ultimately, Pitt should not be completely blamed for attempting to elevate Beane (and baseball) to mythic status. In the end, however, it's the general public, who, year after year, places the 'national pastime', on that saccharine pedestal. After all, baseball, is nothing more than a business and entertainment spectacle, and anyone who tells you otherwise, is, I believe, trying to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge.",1330819200,,6081,5.057

I saw an interview is which he stated that everyone thought the book couldn't be turned into a viable Hollywood script; everyone was right. His acting is good, though much of the same old Brad, so I guess I can see the actors being nominated, but the movie itself was so bad it shouldn't have ever been on even a long list of possibles.",1330819200,3,740,4.834645669291339
4902004,5,B005X5XIF6,"This is a very wonderful film.  Having bought the book when it was originally released in 2003, I wondered how well the adaptation would go to the big screen.

I found out right away:  I liked it immediately.

Brad Pitt shines as A's general manager Billy Beane.  While dealing with the realities facing the 2002 team, he also reaches back into his past, where he was arguably the most talented high school prospect in America coming out of high school--only to fail to pan out as a big league player.  Yet, as a general manger, he has clearly made his mark, as the A's, on his watch, went on to be a serious contender at the turn-of-the-century, contending for the World Series for nearly a decade.  Despite the team's recent struggles, Mr. Beane has never stopped trying to field a competitive team in light of the team's meager payroll, aged stadium, media market, etc.  Mr. Brad has come a long way as an actor and really showed me a lot in this role.

Another person who showed me a lot is Jonah Hill, who earned his Oscar nomination, amongst the many this film received and earned in addition, as A's assistant GM Peter Brand, who is based in part on Paul DePodesta, who actually held the position with the A's at the time.  Brand really brought a lot to his role as the assistant who helped opened Mr. Beane's--and baseball's--eyes and minds to the possibilities of saber metrics as a way and means of evaluating player talent as opposed to the time-and-true conventional methods of player evaluation and talent.  It is very hard to believe that one of the more foremost younger comedians in entertainment today would make this role so dramatically believable, but Jonah pulls this off with quiet passion and aplomb.

Even Phillip Seymour Hoffman does well as Art Howe, who was in what would be his final year as A's manager.  He is able to convey the frustrations he feels with a team he is handed to manage and keep together given all he is able to work with by the team's GM.  Even more understated by Mr. Hoffman's standards, the less-is-more approach for Howe plays well here.

I like the way this film unfolds.  Using some key players from this team as actual characters, namely David Justice, Scott Hatteberg, Miguel Tejada, John Mabry and Chad Bradford, amongst others, the season blends into one of curiosity and hopefulness in hoping the A's are able to work this plan of theirs out.  The film also blends actual game footage into the mix as well, using actual A's broadcasters of the time--and even now--throughout the game portions of the film.  Though knowing how the film will end, for those who followed the team as I did back in 2002, even bringing back such sweet memories, the journey is one which never grows old, tired, repetitive or boring.  This is a movie which begs to be seen--and can be seen again.  The Blu-ray Disc presentation is a solid one, with a fine, clear 1080p picture and a very strong DTS-HD MA 5.1 soundtrack.  Even the extras are worth viewing in comparing some of the actual characters vs. their film counterparts.

4902013,3,B005X5XIF6,"Shows the tale of Oakland A's General Manager Billy Bean. Nitch-market baseball info, it is watchable because Brad Pitt breaths a little life into the story, probably the most engaging storyline is his relationship with his daughter.

We see statistics flashed up on the screen, oh boy. Jonah Hill plays against character playing a straight-shooter numbers guy that Billy hires to find unknown ball players that fit a certain numbers-driven profile that can be successful on the ballfield.

We also see flash backs of Billy's life and his personal struggles to be sucessful himself when he was a player.

The A's do manage to start doing some winning after Billy trades Art Howe's favorite first baseman Carlos Pena (so Carlos eventually ends up with the Rays as an All-Star) so Scott Hattiburg can play firstbase. Carlos is STILL in the league, where  is Scott?

Its a feel-good story as the A's win a league record 20 games in a row, #20 being over the K.C. Royals after the A's were up by 10 runs, their lead slips away, we get to see the whole thing.  Why they did not just use file footage of the game and insert it between shots is beyond me, rather, we get to watch people who are supposedly the Royal players going through the motions.

At the end though, just like the book, of course.  All of Billy's prognostications don't work in the post-season. they work over 162 games, but not in a short series.

This is a character study, there are shots where we just see Billy/Brad just driving his truck, listening to the radio. Is THAT a movie? Or is that something a lonely person would put on as a UTUBE video?

Brad Pitt plays a retired baseball pro, turned general manager of the Oakland A's, who uses a new and unique method of player analysis to try and compete with the biggest spending teams.

Is it any good?

Are you always on sports forums making roster suggestions, or creating trades in ESPN trade machine? Chances are, like me, you've always wanted to be a sports general manager. If that's so, then you will love this movie. But even if you don't like sports, you'll love this movie. What makes this film so great is that it takes you into the inner sanctum of the sports general manager, and gives you almost a fly-on-the-wall look at the pressure of performance, making tough personnel decisions and the interactions with owners. Brad Pitt is great, as is Jonah Hill, however, the script by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin (based on the book Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game) is the true star of the film.

Best bit?

But it was BORING. Character develpment was nil. The players and managers are one-dimensional characters and I couldn't bring myself to give one iota of feces about them or the team. Players were moved around like chess pieces, or slaves bought and sold from one state to another.
And finally, <spoiler ahead> the ""ground breaking"" statistical method for making a winning team - for cheap and shorting the players - didn't ultimately work. The A's lost. There was some obligatory heart-warming nonsense right at the end, something to do with Brad Pitt's character and his daughter in the movie, but I shut it off by then because I couldn't bring myself to care.
I suspect Brad Pitt played the part very well - he seemed authentic. I just couldn't bring myself to care. If you think organized, big-money sports are a care-worthy topic, you'll probably enjoy this movie. I don't, so I didn't.",1330214400,4,1014,4.702247191011236

Instead, he takes a wholly new approach and as expected meets with opposition from just about everyone.  To those who are already familiar with the Oakland A's and the result of his experiment, I guess the movie was kinda slow. I had no idea, so for me it held my attention.

4902040,5,B005X5XIF6,"Sabermetrics is at the soul of this film, which has been adapted from Michael Lewis's book based on Oakland Athletics's remarkable 2002 season. The story begins with the bolting of three free agents. The dilemma for Billy Beane ( Brad Pitt) as the GM is how to compete with a team with a payroll like the New York Yankees. Guided by the ideas of Sabermetrics and a young assistant Peter Brand ( Jonah Hill) they come up with a list of players who are affordable but have been given a chance because of negative perceptions about them. This approach shakes up the team and upsets the scouts and the manager Art Howe ( Phillip Seymour Hoffman) Director Benett Miller takes us through the season all the way to their history making victory streak. This may sound like a documentary but the director and the screen writer have looked for stories within the team such as the arrogance of David Justice, the lack of interest in the game by Jeremy Giambi and the reluctant but ultimate hero Scott Hatteberg. It is however Billy Beane and his assistant Charles Brand who walk away with the accolades as their performance is amazing, understated and amazing.

4902041,5,B005X5XIF6,"Truth may be stranger than fiction, but when the sports world is shaken by a methodology that will revolutionize the business of baseball, it becomes an amazing story born out of need.  Adapted from the Michael Lewis' bestseller by Aaron Sorkin (The Social Network) and Steven Zaillian (Schindler's List) and directed by Bennett Miller (Capote), Moneyball is a fascinating look at how the sport of baseball was turned on its head and its implications that reverberate to this day. It's also about the bond a father has with his daughter that is stronger than any contract.

In 2001, Oakland Athletics general manager and former player Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) is trying to keep his star players from being bought by financially wealthier teams like the New York Yankees.  Desperate to field a winning team with a hopelessly limited budget, he happens upon an analyst for the Cleveland Indians named Peter Brand (a winning Jonah Hill) who has statistics to back up his theory that the best players are not necessarily the costliest ones.  Rather than compete with the big teams, Beane realizes that the underrated players who are statistically on base the most will translate into runs scored and ultimately wins.  The remarkable thing is that these players can be obtained at bargain basement salaries. The concept goes against conventional wisdom and immediately creates friction among the veteran scouts and even the A's manager (played to perfection by Philip Seymour Hoffman).  A former star recruit himself, Beane blew his chance for stardom at an early age and is now sharing custody of his teenage daughter with his ex-wife (Robin Wright). He loves his girl and fears that losing his job will force him to move farther away from her.  As the team begins to show signs of becoming a winning organization, a remarkable string of wins begins that will make history and have far reaching consequences for the game of baseball.

This is one of the best roles Pitt has ever had.  The dialogue is perfectly suited to him, and he delivers flawlessly.  It's the kind of role you could easily picture with a younger Robert Redford.  When he says things that stun his personnel staff by deviating from common practice and status quo, it is a hoot.  I mean he really shakes things up because he is willing to try just about anything to win games, and it also means changing a culture of losing into a winning attitude.  Just watching the negotiations and deal making behind the scenes is fascinating.  You also get a realistic perspective from the clubhouse as players come and go, but these are people too with families, and the film does not shortchange this point of view.

What elevates this film from its novel plotline is the genuine relationship between Billy and his daughter that influences his priorities.  He isn't just a general manager but a father, and the film never loses this perspective to its credit.  When the team's fortunes change dramatically by the end, an astonishing opportunity presents itself to Billy that puts him at a career crossroads, and the baseball world takes notice.

Even non-baseball enthusiasts may find this a fascinating story because it is character driven with strong performances by its cast.  (Sports movies get made with semi-regularity, but when did a studio make a film about personnel management of a major sports team?)  When you think about the recent championship success of teams like the Boston Red Sox and look at this film, the connections are mind boggling.  And while this new age in personnel management is a story onto itself, the one constant through it all is a father's love for his daughter.  Top notch all the way.",1330041600,,3675,4.893548387096774
4902042,2,B005X5XIF6,"I love the game of baseball, so I'll read/watch anything about it. I settled in with Moneyball eager to spend a few hours on the story of an underdog team that triumphs over the big bad money teams.

The thing is... at no point are you allowed to enjoy the movie. Every scene is darkened by failure and foreboding, especially when the general manager, Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), is on screen.

In flashbacks, scouts sign the young Billy Beane to a major league contract, but you don't see the celebration -- you see his failures at the plate. As Oakland A's manager, Beane applies a statistical model to form a rag-tag team that goes on to capture a mid-season triumph. Even at that moment, the camera focuses not on the celebration but on a glum Billy Beane, grousing that unless they win the last game of the season -- unless they take it all -- their mid-season feat is meaningless. This is what the entire movie is like -- dark, grim, humorless.

For an underdog story to work, you have to root for the underdogs. The problem for me is that Beane is not a likable character. He is angry and morose. He slams around the locker room swearing at the players, yelling at the scouts, arguing with the coaches, brooding in his car, brooding in the stands, brooding on the field, brooding in the weight room. His sidekick, Peter Brand, the statistical genius with an economics degree from Yale (Jonah Hill), does nothing to lighten the screen. He's perpetually solemn, grim-faced, blank, present only to lead the viewer's eyes to Pitt.

Who cares whether the strategy of these two Gloomy Guses works? I would have preferred a movie from the point of view of the players, with the back office a side note. The really big triumph is not the statistical model, but how the coaches turned this team of ""misfit toys"" into a credible major league team. For me, the players and coaches were the heroes of this story and their story remains untold.",1329868800,,1935,4.583815028901734

I will only touch briefly on the whole Moneyball myth.  True baseball fans know that it is a myth and is a style which was used by the Kansas City Royals in the 1970s was used by the Cleveland Indians in the 1990s to win several division titles and perfected by the Boston Red Sox to win in 2004.  Billy Beane copied the work of others and acted as though he invented it. The reason Jonah Hill's character is a composite is because the two characters he represents were fired by Billy Beane when he thought they were getting too much credit.

There's something about baseball. It just works on the silver screen. I'm not a big fan of watching baseball in person, or on TV, but it can really zing on a movie screen. Following last year's movie masterpiece The Social Network (2010), screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, and Moneyball co-screenwriter Steven Zaillian, have fashioned this year's crisply intelligent word game to where it almost felt like the sequel to the Facebook film. The same brilliance that brought the seemingly ""boring"" business of social media to epic Greek-Tragedy-life, now brings the business and statistics of baseball to that same place. While The Social Network is about invention, friendship, trust, and revenge, Moneyball is about ambition, courage, logic, and intuition. Both to a large extent are tales of underdogs, scrappily fighting their way to the top, reaching their goals however possible with limited resources.

Up-and-coming film director Bennett Miller did an amazing job pulling this movie together and telling a great new story in a genre that is extremely tough to compete in: the sports movie. Not only is that genre crowded, the baseball sports movie sub-genre can easily fill 9 innings or more with good films: Field of Dreams (1989), Bull Durham (1988), The Natural (1984), Eight Men Out (1988), A League of Their Own (1992), Major League (1989), The Bad News Bears (1976), The Rookie (2002), and 61* (2001). While Moneyball doesn't quite manage the extra greatness that I believe Field of Dreams, Hoosiers (1986), Days of Thunder (1990), and Rudy (1993) occupy as sports movies about underdogs, it does bring a lot to the table to trade with those films.

To begin with, actors Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, and Philip Seymour Hoffman really brought their A-games to the Oakland A's. Some might argue that Hoffman's performance as Art Howe is too subdued and that he has very little dialogue in the film. But the pure weight of his performance with his somber, quiet, old school heft really works for the character he's playing: a grizzled, set-in-his-ways baseball manager up against a younger fire-in-his-pants general manager. Pitt plays the GM, Billy Beane, who wants to shake things up and change the system that they've all worked in for years and years. Beane realizes that the system is broken and that the teams at the bottom with limited financial resources just can't compete against the teams at the top with much bigger budgets to spend on the best players in the game. It's this conceit that sets up the ""risk it all"" strategy that Pitt employs by hiring Jonah Hill's character Peter Brand, a Yale economics graduate whose never played a lick of baseball, to assist him in throwing the traditional baseball scouts on their asses by using logic and statistics instead of popularity, gut instincts, and experience to pick players and create the team with.

I think the strongest asset in this underdog story is the battle between logic and intuition. It's a classic philosophical debate in every ""game"" or endeavor in life. And while some might argue that Moneyball's Beane proves to a degree that logic rules over intuition, I think he's really just trying to bring logic back into the game to play alongside intuition. Babe Ruth, arguably the greatest baseball player of all time, doesn't exactly scream ""great athlete"" in terms of his physical prowess and athleticism by today's standards. You wouldn't see a scout pick a player that looks and acts like Ruth today. But his statistics don't lie. And Beane is simply trying to combine intuition, experience, and talent with statistics to show that sometimes a player might not look on the surface or by their book cover to be a good player, but if their statistics say otherwise, maybe they should be looked at more closely.

The production design and cinematography in Moneyball are right up there with most great films coming out of Hollywood today. Neither overly stood out as exceptional to me, but they definitely aren't average either. There's a realism and ""documentary"" style to the way Moneyball looks and feels. Pitt's hair and costumes are more average joe, helping portray his character as anything but the sexiest-man-alive movie star that Pitt normally plays. He's a father, an ex-husband, and a general manager. It's actually kind of refreshing to see no love interest or romance for the leading man in a movie. We tend to fantasize and dream that we can have it all in the movies: love, career, family, sex, etc. But in reality, lots of men and women who put so much of their passion into their careers, don't have the perfect personal lives we see on screen. I'm glad this movie didn't just stick in a sexy momma for Pitt's character to tango with. Pitt's love in Moneyball is the game of baseball. That's his mistress.

There are a number of great, memorable scenes in Moneyball that I keep playing over and over in my head as I think about the film. Scenes from the various games, the stadium, and the locker room. Scenes in the meeting room between Pitt and the scouts. Scenes in the offices between Pitt and Hill. And scenes with Pitt all by himself. Moneyball's editing, led by Christopher Tellefsen, keeps the film moving most of the time at a good pace, with a few 7th inning slumps. But overall, I felt the film was just right. Some critics and viewers have said that Moneyball is too long and that it drags at times, but I found it engaging nearly the whole time. I can't remember ever looking at my watch. I was vested in the story and felt the stakes, wanting to see how it all played out.

The score and music by Mychael Danna really worked for me, giving the film the deeper emotional connection that I wanted from it. And the sound department did an amazing job with their work, certainly challenged by some of the locations they had to record in. At some point I want to listen to Moneyball's score all on its own to really appreciate it. I have a feeling there's more to it than meets the eye.

You can't go wrong in watching Moneyball. The intelligence, wit, emotion, and craft in this film should appeal on some level with just about everyone. Just like The Social Network is not really a movie just about Facebook, Moneyball is not really a movie just about baseball.

I especially liked it because I live in Baltimore and the Orioles have fallen down to nothing because of poor management and the unwillingness of the rich owner to spend any money on better players.  Beyond that, he's not even a baseball fan and doesn't care what happens to the team as long as he doesn't have to spend much money.  The team has declined more and more since he bought it, and is in last place, all good players sold.

Everyone in town would be happy to see Moneyball happen here.  We could use a different approach.  If the manager ever leaves or retires or dies, his sons will take the money with them.  It won't go for the team.  I loved this movie, because it does show that if a team has a clever manager and the right know how, even a team with little money can bring back the fans.

4902092,3,B005X5XIF6,"This movie centers around Billy Beane, the GM of the Oakland A's, who tries to build a winning team despite a limited budget.  It goes back and forth between his efforts to find the adequate players using an economic model and his flashbacks of his days as a young man who was recruited into the majors.  Foregoing a full scholarship to Stanford to play pro ball, he ends up striking out both literally and figuratively. So he turns to scouting and he tries to implement this economic model that a Yale grad introduces him to and is based on a James model.  Eventually, despite initial trials and tribulations, they meet with success in the form of a twenty game winning streak.  But they aren't able to win in the postseason games.  Their efforts aren't in vain, however, as the movie makes a case that the Boston Red Sox used their economic model to break the curse of the Bambino and win the World Series.  The movie is pretty clean in the sense that it doesn't have nudity nor outrageous passion scenes.  It does feature a lot of cussing as men do in business meetings. But the main drawback of the film is that it could have been cut to about half the time that it takes to watch the show.  It is as if the directors thought they had an epic on their hands and while the story is interesting, it is a far cry from an epic.

4902115,5,B005X5XIF6,"It's Oct 15, 2001 and General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) has just watched his Oakland A's team lose in the American League Division finals. That defeat hurts but now he is losing his best team players, the stars, to teams like the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Socks at salaries that his cash poor team cannot begin to match!

The question is, ""How do you beat big money?""

While in meetings with his scouting agents, he listens to them about all of the prospects that they are recommending. While he hears about baseball skills he also hears about ""handsome faces"" and ""ugly girlfriends"". He realizes that baseball scouting is not the panacea to solve his biggest problem. How do you build a winning team with a limited budget?

While out trying to trade players he meets Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) who is a Yale economics graduate working for the Cleveland Indians. He learns that young Peter is a man who has no baseball experience but is listened to by the management of the Indians. He hires him and finds out that Pete has developed a mathematical relationship between baseball players and their skills and how to match those skills to a team to win games. Billy's goal is to win the last game of the season! The World Series!

What develops is that Billy and Pete rebuild the Oakland A's with a bunch of misfits that nobody else wants and tries to build a winning team. The team's field coach fights them every step of the way.

This is based on a true story about how these guys' vision of professional baseball reworked the model that is used today to build championship teams.",1328400000,,1595,4.562937062937063

4902118,5,B005X5XIF6,"There are well over 100 reviews of this film on Amazon now - most of them based on the theatrical release - so I won't bore you with many more details about the film itself. I'll concentrate more on the DVD release - especially the Blu-Ray disc which has a few more Special Features than the Standard DVD.

As for the film, I'm not a huge sports fan but I was engaged throughout the full two-hour-plus length. Though Brad Pitt will always look like Brad Pitt playing someone, the rest of the cast including Philip Seymour Hoffman and the amazing Jonah Hill (sooooooo low key that you almost overlook his performance, but cheer with him in the end) blend in well with the REAL sports players that Director Bennett Miller incorporated into his cast. And fans of ""The West Wing"" (I'm a huge one) will spot some of the well-crafted lines by the screenplay writer, Aaron Sorkin.

The Standard DVD bonus features include four deleted scenes (12 minutes), Blooper Rell (3 minutes), and  ""Moneyball - Playing The Game"" the standard ""behind the scenes"" featurette with lots of clips you have just seen(19 minutes).. The BD adds two more featurettes that are more interesting: ""Drafting the Team"" about casting (20 minutes) and ""Adapting Moneyball"" (about it's conversion into a film with discussions by the screenwriter. (16 minutes).

Sports fans of any sport will love this. Oakland As fans probably bought this the day it came out!

I hope you found this review helpful.

I enjoyed the story, as someone who lived in Oakland during this era, it was both nostalgic and enlightening. The faults lie in the performance that Brad Pitt gives. He eats pretty much the whole way through the entire film (as he tends to do in movies) and it's disgusting. It's hard to watch a scene when he's there chomping like a horse with a carrot. It's very distracting unless the sight of people eating with their mouthes open doesn't bother you. That being said, Pitt does have moment when you can see the decent actor in him shining through. There were moments of comedy and moments that were touching but more than anything, for a baseball fan, this movie can take you back to a moment in time when baseball changed for the underdogs.

4902122,4,B005X5XIF6,"I love movies, all kinds of movies, but sports genre movies aren't usually my first choice.  But I liked ""Moneyball"" very much.  It's loosely based on the true life story of General Manager Billy Beane and the Oakland A's baseball team.

I'm always a sucker for an underdog story and I like unusual, offbeat movies so this was a win-win for me.  Brad Pitt was low key in the role of Beane, playing the GM/ex-baseball player - a maverick, going against tradition and hiring players by numbers rather than an arcane convoluted instinctual system that had been used previously.

My favorite in the movie is Jonah Hill, playing Yale graduate, Peter Brand, who had majored in economics and uses a complex system of statistics to rank ball players.  He is hired to be Beane's assistant GM.  This is a much more serious role for Hill than I've seen him in before and in my opinion, it's his performance that makes the movie a success.

I also liked the Good Ole Boy scouts and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Art Howe, the team manager.

Good story, great casting, some unnecessary family moments - all-in-all a sports movie that I enjoyed and will probably watch again in the future.

(Oh - I did like Beane's daughter in the movie, Kerris Dorsey, singing ""The Show"" sung previously by Lenka.  Good song and Dorsey does an admirable job on it.)

4902123,5,B005X5XIF6,"A baseball movie that mostly eschews game sequences for scenes of guys sitting around and talking about obscure statistics -- sounds like a winner, right? Well, yes, in the case of Moneyball. Brad Pitt stars as Billy Beane, the general manager of the small market Oakland Athletics; his mission is to find a way to field a winning team with a fraction of the money that the Yankees and Red Sox have to snag big time players. With the help of stat geek Peter Brand, Beane acquires a ragtag group of castoffs and old timers who share a common trait: they have abilities that the entrenched scouting establishment has ignored. Based upon Michael Lewis' bestseller, Moneyball is an amazing film, and while baseball obsessives will find a couple things to quibble about -- the movie barely mentions the contributions of stars like Miguel Tejada, Tim Hudson, Barry Zito, or Eric Chavez -- this is an intelligent, witty piece of moviemaking.

But I'm still a sucker for a good baseball story and will happily suspend disbelief when it's entertainment, rather than documentary. The script is solid, as are the acting and directing, if not quite worthy of ""Best Picture."" My favorite baseball movie of all time, ""A League of Their Own,"" also was ""based"" on a true story, and those liberties with fact do not bother me. The Special Features with the real Billy Beane are good. One small complaint: ""Moneyball"" looks a little grainy, which I assume was a decision of the director or cinematographer.

What was wrong? The flashback scenes did not help make a connection to the character. I caught myself thinking, okay now is where I am suppose to feel sorry for Billy Beane. Nothing really happened in the flashbacks. There was never a sense that he loved baseball at all.  So why build a career in it after failing as a player?  Also, there was no sense that he loved being a GM.  They didn't really use what could have made it an awesome movie: the relationship between him and the assistant GM.  They wasted good chemistry between those two characters. There was no love for the game shown.

Neither do I. But this is the basis for the movie Moneyball. Brad Pitt stars as Athletic A's General Manager Billy Beane.

Back in the day, Beane was drafted into the Pros right out of High School on the promise that he was going to be one of the greatest ball players in the history of baseball. Alas, this prophecy did not pan out. Beane never grew into the athlete the scouts imagined he would become, and after multiple trades, he became a scout and then GM of the A's.

After losing three of their greatest players to the Yankees, Beane realizes they will never compete with the kind of money teams like New York or Boston are willing to throw around. He visits Cleveland for a possible trade and meets a fresh-from-Yale gradutate, played by Jonah Hill.

Hill's ideas about players and how the stats come into play for scouts intrigues Beane who hires him as his new Assistant.

Of course, their new ways of doing things upsets the veteran scouts and even the team's field manager. (Philip Seymour Hoffman)

How could a bunch of no-namers lead a team to victory?

I was impressed with Jonah Hill. I have grown tired of his kind of comedy so it was refreshing to see him in a semi-serious role next to the always-great Pitt. And Philip Seymour Hoffman can hit any role out of the park.

This is a decent baseball movie. It tacks on the added bonus of being based on actual events. So even though you may know how the movie will end, it's fun to see how things worked out behind the scenes.

The only downside was the length. There were many times I felt it could have ended or, at least, cut out a few scenes to make it not as long. Of course it could have been that I was tired and ready for bed but had to finish the film first...",1327881600,,1791,4.322388059701493

Honestly, how could anyone get all that emotionally involved in a movie that has only ""baseball team member selection"" at its core???? Intended audience?

I like that the movie doesn't make Brad Pitt's character perfect. It shows some flaws and it certainly doesn't make him right all the time but eventually it is his leadership and vision that change the team and in every minute it's clear (in the movie at least) that everything that's going on in his team is his responsibility.
The entire cast is brilliant including every actor and actress in every little role. Too bad Robin Wright (no more ""Penn"" there...) only gets a small part. She is very good.

Obviously the movie is based on real events so they cant just make it all up at the end, but it still feels like it was missing something.

Brad Pitt did a good job as Billy Beane. Jonah Hill did ok, but most people probably don't realize that his character is made up. The real person went by a different name, was in good shape, and refused to have himself in the movie so they pulled a handful of people together to create the one character played by Jonah Hill who is portrayed as some nerdy, overweight office worker.

Sabermetrics is the holy grail to some and something horrible evil to others depending on who is talking about it. The movie tries to stay out of that argument and stick with what specifically happended to Oakland.

It is unfortunate that Billy Beane still has yet to win with Oakland even up this day.

But, by way of metaphor, it takes a creative mind to look at a desert of what to most of us is a seemingly endless sand and see hidden beauty and then guide the rest of us in how to also find beauty in a desert. Thus, the back room machinations of baseball are not normally likely to wake even a snail from it's slumber (let alone most of us humans) yet Pitt crafted this tale so well that even the snails in my yard were unwaveringly intrigued by this story. Snails vote five stars.

On rather insignificant minor notes: First, ""The Show"" sung by Dorsey in the movie was around 2002 but wasn't written/released by Lenka until 2008/2009. My second minor note is the interpretation of the metaphor at the end of the movie. First, Beane says ""I made one decision in my life based on money. And, I swore I would never do it again."" Which is actually a form of rigid thinking that the premise of the movie argues against. One poor decision doesn't imprison you to all subsequent decisions of that type. Then the metaphor comes in, ""You're doing it for what the money says. That you're worth it."" ""He hit a home run and didn't even realize it."" All suggest to me that Beane's thinking out of the box worked and all that the money does is confirm it.

4902151,4,B005X5XIF6,"""Moneyball"" might just be the smartest sports movie ever made.  It takes the very complicated subject of using statistics to evaluate players and makes it simple enough that anyone, baseball fan or not, can follow along.

Brad Pitt is excellent as Billy Beane, a guy obsessed with winning in small-market Oakland.  He's working with a low payroll in an era when teams like the Yankees, Red Sox and Rangers are spending huge sums of money.  After a chance meeting with Jonah Hill in Cleveland, Pitt brings Hill out to Oakland and, together, they develop a new way of looking at baseball players.  They develop a formula that puts the A's in the playoffs (though not to the World Series).

As I said in the title, ""Moneyball"" isn't so much about baseball as it is about thinking differently.  Pitt and Hill have to deal with a lot of doubters, many of whom are in their own organization.  Yet they persevere and show that it works.  Granted, there are challenges to their formula along the way (one of whom is named ""Jeremy Giambi""), but they gradually gain more acceptance from those within and outside of the organization.  Being able to see the evolution of acceptance of this idea and to also see the results is especially gratifying, as it really makes you realize how outside-the-box thinking can make a huge difference.

There really is a lot in this movie for baseball die-hards as well.  The scouting meetings and especially the way trades are completed are fascinating to watch.  These are also where Pitt shines as a wheeler/dealer and Hill plays the naive baseball newbie perfectly.  Pitt also does an outstanding job showcasing how competitive Beane is and just how much he hates losing.  The wordless way he expresses himself when he actually sets foot into the stands during a game emotes an almost childlike wonderment at what is going on around him, almost like ""wait, we built this?"".

The movie does have a few slow points.  I thought the scenes with Pitt and his daughter were nice, but didn't really add anything.  And the movie does bog down occassionally in scenes where they sit in the film room and analyze tape.  A lot of the drama of the A's season is also lost, mostly since everyone knows how it ended.  But it would have been nice if they'd spent just a little more time on that part of the year.

Overall, though, this is an outstanding film.  It goes completely against type for a sports movie and makes it into almost more of a life lesson about the success you can have when you think different.",1327622400,,2527,4.6441441441441444
4902152,5,B005X5XIF6,"I hate sports.  Honestly, I don't care for them at all.  I find them boring and pointless and lacking all excitement that so many heap upon them.  But, I love movies, and I love the Oscars, and when a film (and especially a performance) is talked up as Oscar potential then I feel the necessity to indulge, to take a bite, to `see for myself'.

That is basically how `Moneyball' and I met.

On paper, this sounds awful.  The trailers looked simple and boring and kind of dumb.  I remember making that comment on an Oscar forum, because there was just no way that this movie was going to be remotely interesting.  Then the reviews started pouring in and the praise started to mount and Pitt got his career best mentions and I sat back in bewilderment because all of this praise meant that I really needed to see this movie.  My best friend was happy, because he's always pestering me about accompanying him to sports related events (yeah, better luck next time) and so we went to the movies and I fully expected to hate this and wound up being completely absorbed in every frame.

I have decided that if there is ever to be a movie made about my life, I want Aaron Sorkin to write the screenplay.  Seriously, between this and last year's epic `The Social Network', he is the master of spinning such detailed and rapturous webs out of seemingly mundane situations (baseball and facebook...seriously?).

`Moneyball' tells the story of Oakland A's manager, Billy Beane' and his determination to make the A's a winning team.  The terms refers to the fact that wealthier teams get an unfair advantage in creating winning teams because they can outbid and thus buy better players.  Oakland was not a wealthy team, and yet by hiring a numbers man with a big idea (that no one believed in), Beane was able to turn things around and start something big for himself and his team.  Pitt is wonderful here, fleshing out a man who is very lived in and weathered.  He understands Beane and helps the audience to relate to him.  But, as great as Pitt (and the rest of the cast) is, this film really lives and breathes at the hands of the men behind the camera.  Sorkin and Zaillian build a marvelous script here, and Bennett Miller (should have won that Oscar back in 05) has such depth within his directorial work here that he illuminates every frame and draws you in.

So, coming from a guy who wrote this off because of a genre, watch this...it truly is one of the best films of the year!",1327622400,,2475,4.496644295302014
4902153,4,B005X5XIF6,"Moneyball, a smart and entertaining drama directed by Bennett Miller, would appear at first glance to be a traditional underdog sports film in which a ragtag group of players come together as a team and against all odds become champions.  Except that's not what this movie is about.  Not remotely.  Moneyball is instead a fact based and ultimately honest depiction of the business of Major League Baseball, a sport where teams with deep pockets and endless resources are able to buy their way to championships while small market teams must struggle and scrap to compete.

The plot of Moneyball deals with Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), the general manager of the small market Oakland Athletics.  Following a successful 2001 season in which the A's lose in the playoffs to the big market New York Yankes, Beane faces the seemingly impossible task of rebuilding the team after the loss of star players Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon and Jason Isringhausen to richer teams.  Without the payroll he needs to replace these players, Beane embraces a radical approach to assessing talent that is promoted by his new assistant general manager, Peter Brand (Jonah Hill).  Brand, an economics graduate from Yale University, suggests that Beane should focus on buying ""runs"" instead of specific players.  Using a system based on statistical analysis of players tendency to get on base, Beane and Brand fill the gaps in the A's lineup with undervalued players who they believe will help the team produce more runs resulting in more wins.  Not surprisingly, the two men meet with fierce criticism and opposition from eveyone from the A's player scouts to the team's manager, Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman).  Things only get worse when the team gets off to a horrific start.

Yet as the season wears on, the system starts to work and the team eventaully goes on a 20 game winning streak and returns to the playoffs.  As I stated earlier however, this is not an underdog sports movie.  Beane's method does help the A's compete with the richer teams in baseball and changes the way that teams evaluate talent, but ultimately the same problem remains.  The wealthiest teams will always have an advantage over the small market teams.  Moneyball never resorts to preachiness to make this point thanks to an excellent screenpaly by Steven Zallian and Aaron Sorkin.  The performances are strong as well.  Brad Pitt, no longer able to rely solely on his good looks and charisma, does some of his best acting yet and Jonah Hill gives a nicely understated turn as the much maligned assistant general manager.  In the end the Oakland Athletics don't slay Goliath and become the stuff of baseball lore, but they help to change the way the game is evaluated and keep hope alive for underdogs everywhere to compete with the big boys.  And maybe, just every once in a while, to beat them too.",1327536000,,2856,4.875776397515528
4902164,3,B005X5XIF6,"The story and concept is interesting, but was how it was told was not as exciting. I kept asking my brother who read the book to help fill in the blanks for me.  The overall movie didn't keep my interest more than a typical made-for-TV film.  There are some glimpses of potentially great moviemaking, but it's inconsistent and sloppy.

Many critics also said you don't have to be a fan of Baseball to like this movie, but the only two out of five of us who watched this movie together that thought it was great were baseball fans.

I am also a hug fan of Aaron Sorkin and was excited and optimistic when I learned he co-wrote this movie, however was disapointed. It lacks that Sorkin style that was able to make ""The Social Network"", another story that could potentially be boring on film into a great movie.

I thought Brad Pitt's performance was great, one of his better and deserves the oscar nod.  However, Jonah Hill contributes nothing to this movie and even slows it down. I can't believe Jonah Hill recieved an Oscar Nom for this film!  Phillip Seymour Hoffman does a fantastic job with a very small part in this movie making me wish he had more screen time.

4902168,4,B005X5XIF6,"Let me start by saying I'm a big baseball fan and I think Brad Pitt is excellent in his performance as Oakland Athletics General Manager Billy Beane. I also think Jonah Hill is superb and earns his best supporting actor nomination as made-up Yale-educated baseball statistician ""Peter Brand"". It is worth noting that it is Brand's real-life ideas, embodied by on-field application of real-life statistician Bill James' Sabermetrics, that make up the heart and soul of ""Moneyball"" - both the film and the idea.

Beane's A's have had some success. In 2001 with a roster that cost a third of the high-ballin' Yankees the A's take the mighty Yanks down to the last game of the playoffs prior to losing, then losing stars Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi and Jason Isringhausen to teams that can afford their now high-price salaries. (From an even playing field standpoint, Major League Baseball is still miles behind any American ideal of ""fairness"".) Beane is ""rewarded"" with the task of rebuilding the A's with the available funds to attract... no one.

He goes to another organization to talk a trade and notices Brand in the corner whispering in the ear of a rival general manager. Beane, who was a professional player himself, knows that Jonah Hill doesn't look like anyone's idea of a sports guy. He tracks him down after the meeting and asks why the Indian's General Manager listens to him.

And thus is presented the whole idea of Moneyball: although home runs and batting averages are flashy and show up on Sportscenter highlights, the bottom line in baseball is wins. A walk, while not ostentatious, is pretty much exactly as valuable as a single, and players with good on-base percentages (judiciously mixing walks in with swings of the bat) are as valuable as players with a good batting average.

Beane buys into the idea and puts all his eggs into the Moneyball basket, upsetting pretty much everyone else in the organization.  He seems to have nothing to lose - his owner isn't going to provide one of those multi-million dollar contracts, so Beane and Brand have to find bargain players.

The drama comes in watching Beane coax and cajole the rest of the A's organization into buying the concept. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays field manager Art Howe, who frankly tells Beane that he thinks the whole experiment is going to get him fired. (My recollection of the real Howe is a thin, gaunt man physically almost completely dissimilar from the moon-faced Hoffman, but hey, it's a movie.)

The problem I have with the film is the manner in which they reduce the national pastime, the hope and dream of millions of boys and girls (and boys and girls at heart) to a cold, statistical business. I don't know the real Billy Beane. I suspect that they model many of his film idiosyncrasies on real life, such as the fact that he doesn't travel with the team or even go out to the field to watch the games. For the little boy in me this makes as much sense as changing the end of Willy Wonka to put the Chocolate Factory away in the closet and watch it occasionally on television.

As a ""renegade businessman upsetting the apple-cart"" story, Moneyball works. After all, the screenplay is by that double-dog genius of screenwriters, Aaron Sorkin. As a baseball movie - it's not even as fun as watching batting practice.",1327363200,,3315,4.773123909249564

4902172,2,B005X5XIF6,"Sitting with a cool beer in one hand, a hot dog in the other, a group of friends could easily argue the semantics of modern baseball until they were blue in the face.  With constant shut-outs, players pulling multi-million dollar deals and product-placement as the new American dream; it is not hard to see the modern athlete as being less skill-oriented and more pop-culture celebrity as they step up to the plate.  Who will sell more tickets?  Who will look good with an A-list actress on his arm?  Who can ensure Gatorade will always be sold in grocery stores?  These are tough questions facing baseball today, not who is the better player? Who can hit the ball further?  Who makes runs?  This change in one of America's most endearing past times is the topic of conversation in Bennett Miller's recent film, Moneyball, and his subject of choice - Oakland A's General Manager, Billy Beane - baseball's most notorious loser.

Beane has always been interested in sports.  Playing basketball, baseball, and football in high school, he dropped football to ensure an old injury wouldn't hurt his baseball dreams.  After declining admission into Stanford University to join with the New York Mets, Beane soon realized that he couldn't match the same skill set.  Unable to change his decision about Stanford, Beane found comfort behind the scenes as first a scout and later as General Manager of the A's.  In Moneyball, he is played with lacking simplicity by Brad Pitt.  While Pitt's performance is being romanticized as award season rolls out, one can easily see it is not his best performance.  That does not mean Moneyball is a lackluster film.  While many argue this is Pitt's Blind Side, one could easily argue that this is Miller's The Departed (the film that Scorsese finally won for).  Like Scorsese, this isn't the greatest character film - but the best directorial effort this cinematic year.  This is a movie about statistics, about how over-valued the game of baseball has become, and how large pools of dollars do not necessarily man pennants at home.  This, without someone strong behind the camera, would be either a very dull movie about numbers or just another bio-pic about a leader that fell short in the final moments.  Thankfully, with Miller's ease, this becomes a watchable film about the ""girth"" of baseball.  As he intermixes real moments in baseball coupled with our actors doing their part, he also races the screen with statistical numbers, computer logarithms, and as Hill says early in the film, ""...their own Island of Misfit Toys"".  Miller transforms this from an underdog sports film to a story about the human condition.  He lingers on scenes that show Pitt on the phone arguing contracts, he demonstrates the absurdity of draft picks by painting a table of geriatrics looking for ""Fabio"", the endearing close shot of Pitt's worked eyes, and lacking voice of humanity when it is time to trade someone.  Yet, despite Pitt receiving most of the praise, Miller demonstrates finesse by giving us a movie that doesn't paint baseball in the greatest light.  Miller's visual of baseball isn't pretty, and throughout this very well lit film, a trained eye can catch his jabs and insults at today's modern game.

To appease those who have read this far, we will discuss Brad Pitt, who meanders his way through this film by tossing chairs and snapping his fingers at Jonah Hill.  His character portrayal of Beane, to those who are unaware of Beane's life, will be confusing.  What is his relationship with his daughter?  Why is Spike Jonze with his wife?  Why does he work out so much during games?  Why did his mind suddenly flip statistically when he met Hill?  All of these questions will remain unanswered as you sit through the nearly two hours of Pitt attempting to grab at anything sports related.  I will give him that he is inspiring when he speaks, but as a majority of this film he is sitting, considering possibilities, and transforming into Zen Pitt - he just becomes pointless.  Perhaps it was Sorkin's writing that failed at developing anything secure, but Beane feels bland, like it is Pitt being Pitt on a lazy Sunday.  Sorkin's writing also creates further ailments as the film progresses - mismatched messages make us ask why we think Beane's daughter is creative, only to underscore the feeling by having her lip-sync a song about her Dad being a loser?  That immediately destroyed the emotion needed at that final moment by using a mere ""American Idol"" throwback.  It was instances like this that fumbled horribly in this film as well and felt like the film leftovers of Sorkin's other work, the greatly overpraised The Social Network.  Michael Lewis' work needed to have a stronger writer onboard to show value in the book that literally changed the face of baseball.  Pitt's performance will not even be remembered in a year's time.  Moneyball is Bennett Miller's film.  It is not a Brad Pitt movie.  It is about the broken nature of baseball.  It demands that we re-evaluate the grassroots of statistical analysis in the game and apply it to the valuation of the modern player (not just because he has an ugly girlfriend, he will be less confident).

Needless to say, Moneyball is not a film that will make you feel good about baseball.  It is a dirty picture (despite the gloss of the frame) about a rag-tag band of losers that remain losers by the end of the film, and Pitt tries - and fails - as our trout swimming against the current trying to find greener pastures.  Is this a movie about being a loser?  Plenty of questions are proposed and later forgotten as the film progresses, and the stand-out star becomes the statistics and Miller's direction.  Moneyball is the type of film that gets you excited for no reason, and in the end, shows a guy who believed in the technology, but didn't follow through.  This is a film about the passion of math, and how its technical applications can be used to burst a bloated game.  Baseball should fear Moneyball.",1327276800,2,6004,4.8050682261208575
4902173,4,B005X5XIF6,"I'm not a sports lover (yeah, yeah - I'm a girl), but I know a little bit about the business of baseball, and I really enjoyed this film.  From understanding how budgets were (are?!) traditionally managed to seeing an underdog team use their brains and savvy to get (close to) the top, it was a refreshing take on how things are in professional baseball.  With realistic humor, some tenderness (especially between Pitt and his daughter), some hard-line business (letting players go is remarkably unemotional, which is both admirable and heart-wrenching at the same time), and some interesting math/economic theory, I found this movie really grew on me.  I admit:  When it ended and I turned it off, I thought, ""Meh.  It was okay; it held my attention; it was entertaining.""  But as time went by, I found myself thinking about all of the components more and more, and they really added up to more than the sum of their parts.  It grew on me - and I even watched it a second time to see what I'd missed the first time through.

4902176,4,B005X5XIF6,"How do you build a championship team with smaller resources than other teams? ""Moneyball"" based on the book by Michael Lewis that documented how General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt)for the Oakland A's used an unconvetional approach to put together a team on a budget--using computer analysis to draft players that will fill their slots but still allow them to reach their goal of the play-offs and, perhaps, the World Series. Since Bean can't afford the team that the Yankees can he has to find a way to out play them by finding undervalued players.
Beane taps Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) to help him find those players that can provide them what they need--to get on base and make runs.

Pitt does a terrific job as Beane a former major league player who ""had it all"" but didn't end up living up to his potential. Pitt is ably supported by Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the team's manager who has an adversarial relationship

The Blu-ray looks magnificent on Blu-ray with a sharp, colorful transfer with great depth and textures (this, of course, is the case for the film itself not for the TV footage that shows up in the film).

Audio sounds terrific with an immersive DTS lossless 5.1 presentation that puts audio action all around your system. The film also features subtitles in English.

The special features for this set are quite good as well. ""Drafting The Team"" focuses on casting the movie while ""Adapting Moneyball"" focuses on the challanges of making the non-fiction book into a dramatic film and combining two different drafts of the script one written by Aaron Sorkin and the other written by Steven Zallian. ""Reinventing The Game"" focuses on how Beane's approach helped revolutionize the game having an impact that helped other smaller market teams to make it to the World Series. ""Playing The Game"" focuses on MLB's involvement in making the film.

Finally we get a couple of extended/alternate scenes as well as a brief gag reel.

The set also includes a standard DVD as well as the dreaded Ultra Violet copy that allows you to stream the film (but only while online and only if you have an account which really does suck for those who want to watch this on their portable device).

You don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy ""Moneyball"" which gives us the story of an underdog team and their GM's attempt to give them some parity withy the big city teams.

4902177,3,B005X5XIF6,"""Moneyball"", based on Michael Lewis' book of the same name, follows the 2002 season of baseball's Oakland Athletics, behind the scenes, as General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) meets a lot of resistance to his new strategy. In an effort to put together a winning team on a paltry budget, Beane has taken the advice of his new Assistant Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a Yale-educated statistician, and decided to choose players strictly by the numbers. He looks for players who have particular talents but whom other teams have undervalued, so he can pick them up cheap. The team's talent scouts take a dim view of the project, and the team's manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is downright uncooperative.

Michael Lewis was interested in Billy Beane's story, because it paralleled the shift from old-school experience and intuition to quantitatively-motivated decision-making that Lewis experienced on Wall Street in the 1980s and wrote about in his breakthrough book ""Liar's Poker"". Billy Beane taught baseball that it was choosing players the wrong way, and his ""sabermetric"", or quantitative, approach has gained considerable following since. The name of his assistant who crunched all the numbers in real life was Paul DePodesta, and he was educated at Harvard, not Yale. The methods they used were based on the work of Bill James, who pioneered the statistical approach to baseball in the 1980s.

Unfortunately, screenwriters Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin played it safe by including irrelevant, saccharine tidbits about Billy Beane's relationship with his 12-year-old daughter in order to ""connect"" with the audience or to ""humanize"" him or some such nonsense. This extraneous material only serves to make the movie too long. The writers use a classic underdog sports team structure, which is awkward, because the battle is not being waged by players on the baseball diamond, but rather between recruitment philosophies behind the scenes. Sorkin and Zaillian have plugged a story that is not about human relationships or underdogs into a paint-by-numbers plot that is.

""Moneyball"" would have done better to focus on the implications of the conflict between statistical analyses and the Old School, as this battle has been waged in many professions in recent decades. The fact that it reached professional sports, with its deeply entrenched traditions and market that thrives on nostalgia, shows how radically business culture has changed. But the filmmakers take a conventional approach, presumably to appeal to a wider audience. The writers sidestep the real conflict in favor of predictable filler. They dumb it down. It's an entertaining film but would have been a lot better had the writers done some writing instead of plugging the story into a pre-fab plot.",1327190400,25,2777,5.278280542986425
4902178,5,B005X5XIF6,"You don't have to be a fan of baseball to relish this film, no you don't. MONEYBALL can be enjoyed as a compelling underdog sports film, or as a terrifically-acted drama, or as a slice of Americana. This is the biopic of Billy Beane and how he changed the game of baseball, or the numbers crunching bits of it anyway. I confess that when Billy Beane first overhauled the Oakland A's system back in the early oughts, I was as skeptical as any guy watching from a distance and taking in his odd shenanigans. But then the Oakland Athletics made that historic run. Back then, I remained a skeptic. It took this film and its examination of the nuts and bolts of the moneyball process for me to fully appreciate what this man had done. This film injects a bit of soulfulness into a soulless system that is inherently calculating and is all about the gathering and analyzing of computer-generated statistical data to draft a team's players. You have to remember that Billy Beane had no choice but to go the sabermetric route.

Beane has an insider's perspective. He, after all, actually was in the show, having played in the professional league for some years... and abjectly failing. How must it have felt to be courted by baseball scouts and skipping college to go pro, only to realize that you don't belong? It painfully dawns on Beane that scouts don't really have any magic formula. Sometimes, the product is purchased based on its potential and it doesn't pan out, like Beane didn't pan out. He opted for a sudden career shift, becoming a scout himself. From there he rose up the career ladder and ended up General Manager of the Oakland A's. And yet his inner demons continue to haunt him.

Brad Pitt deserves all the award nominations he gets. He is so good here. As MONEYBALL opens with Oakland and its big guns getting eliminated in the playoffs, the camera shoots to a frustrated Billy Beane who prefers to listen to the game on the radio rather than actually watching it. With Oakland done for the season, Beane focuses on rebuilding the team, what with free agency threatening to take away Oakland's marquee players. Except that the A's are a small market team, and the owner just can't compete with the obscene salaries doled out by the big market teams (cough*damnyankees*cough). The owner directs Beane to make do with the budget he's got, which is a pittance.

""You don't put a team together with a computer, Billy,"" some naysayer remarks, but never mind that. The moneyball scheme was constructed by a desperate Beane and lowly Yale economics graduate and stats fiend Peter Brand (a shockingly effective Jonah Hill). Brand is based on Paul DePodesta who was Billy Beane's real-life assistant. The film goes on to chronicle how the 2002 Oakland A's became the laughingstock of the Major League Baseball with its dismal early losses and its no-name roster made up of players who are either too old or who throw funny or have unmanageable tempers. ""Island of misfit toys,"" is how someone describes it. But, somewhere along the way, Oakland began to surge up the rankings and then there was that phenomenal winning streak, another instance of fact being stranger than fiction. Nowadays what MLB team isn't using sabermetrics?

Pitt's performance fuels the film, but his outstanding rapport with Jonah Hill and with Kerris Dorsey, who plays his sensitive young daughter, cannot be overlooked. It's never as good as when Pitt is sharing a scene with either of them. But you have to credit Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian's sharp, lively, and emotionally satisfying screenplay. You'll laugh and cheer and maybe even get misty-eyed. I don't think it's a secret anymore that Brad Pitt really can act, but the man's suffered from the infamous pretty face syndrome. When he finally began to show wear and tear on his mug, I think that's when folks began to take him seriously as an actor. In MONEYBALL he commands the screen utterly.

4902196,4,B005X5XIF6,"This is why I like Brad Pitt.  This guy, for the longest time, has been making movies of real substance rather than letting his looks help him.  He would rather win Best Actor rather than Best Ass and has picked his roles accordingly.  The first time I realized what a good actor he was was in 12 Monkeys.  He has been impressing me ever since (with the occasional misfire-Legends of the Fall anyone?) with his roles that seem to do the opposite of capitalizing on his looks.  Well, here's another one.  He doesn't chew the scenery, but gives a nicely nuanced portrayal.  The story is interesting and if you don't know what appened with the As, it keeps your interest?  Will they win or not.  There are so many moments this film could have stumbled with schmaltzy, Hollywood conventions.  Indeed, there is a lot here that could degenerate into that, particularly in the scenes with his broken family.  But even these scenes ring true.  Jonah Hill is really good here too, showing once again that good comic actors make good regular actors.  He is perfect for the role without degenerating into the funny fat guy he normally plays.  He gives light comic relief without going overboard.  All told, it is a very good movie.  It is high time that Brad finally got an Oscar.  Maybe this movie will give him that chance.",1326844800,,1314,4.594827586206897

Jonah Hill also plays as Billy Beane's genius assistant Peter Brandt.

Baseball went from our national past-time to a game that is hard to love. With all the scandals and allegations, the crux of the issue is how the sport is run. Baseball, like all professional sports, is a business and, as such, decisions are made for profitability. Baseball unlike most major sports does not adhere to a salary cap and as a result, big market teams can (literally) buy up the major players. The evil empires (New York Yankees AND Boston Red Sox) have been attempting to purchase titles for years and the system pioneered by Billy Beane is the only legitimate obstacle (there is always chance). This movie examines where value lies in putting together a team and offers a real solution for small market clubs to compete with big market teams.

But there's still a lot of baseball talk and baseball footage, so being somewhat of a fan certainly helped me appreciate this movie. The main thing however, is that I really enjoyed Brad Pitt in this in a way I haven't in along time. He was perfect for his role as Billy Beane, General Manager for the Oakland A's in 2002 who revolutionized the way players are recruited and even the way the game is played by focusing on complex player statistics, as opposed to 'soft' factors. Pitt played the right combination of cockiness and desperation, and I thought it was one of his better career performances.

Jonah Hill was also great as the Yale educated economist/statistician he hires, and the entire supporting cast worked. It's a fascinating story. The only thing that kept it from 5-stars for me is that it did drag a bit at times. I felt it could have been shortened a little in the middle, to keep the momentum going.

Do not buy this movie if you're looking for stirring on-screen action, tense scenes of the pitcher on the mound staring down batters, and exciting scenes of come-from-behind victories etc. This isn't that movie, it's not Major League of even the Natural. The story of Moneyball is about what it takes to put together an organization that has a chance to win, and so the on-field action is ancillary to the film, and treated as such. We see it, but the action on the field is a result of the real drama happening behind the scenes.

Anyone who follows MLB knows that sabermetrics and the philosophies that Billy Beane took a flyer on, had lasting impact on the game of baseball. Even though his team hasn't been able to win using those theories, other teams have. What's more it kicked the game into the modern world, so the question is now no longer 'Why look at the game in new ways?' but instead 'Why NOT look at the game in new ways?' It doesn't always work out, but change has come to MLB, and there's no going back.

  Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt) is General Manager of the Oakland A's and after losing the last game of the season against the Yankees, three of his star players leave for more lucrative contracts. He'd hoped to match their offers, but the owner couldn't afford it. Then, while looking for a trade at the Cleveland Indians' headquarters, he noticed his counterpart appeared to be taking direction from someone he'd never seen before. After the meeting he approaches Peter Brand (played by Jonah Hill), the one person he didn't know in that meeting who seemed to be calling the shots. Brand and Beane soon have a rapport and before long Brand is Beane's second-in-command despite serious resistance from the rest of the staff in the Manager's office who feel Brand is a threat to the team and the game itself.

  Sabermetrics has had wide-reaching and long-lasting effects on the game of baseball from supposedly ending the Red Sox losing streak to posthumously exonerating fabled great ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson. The story is interesting and Jonah Hill acting way outside his comfort zone is, to say the least, adequate. Brad Pitt also plays his part well as he often does, regardless of the material.

4902241,4,B005X5XIF6,"I saw a review somewhere on Amazon that said, ""...you've got to LOVE baseball to like this movie."" I am still trying to figure out if that is true. Here is the deal. I went into watching this movie because:

1) Brad Pitt is in it and despite all the annoying attention he gets because he is Angelina's other half, he is one of the most under-rated actors out there.
2) I love a good drama, especially about underdogs.
3) Oscar Buzz (yes, it's that time of year)

Am I a fan of baseball? No. Actually, it's probably one of my least favorite sports and I know the bare minimum when it comes to the positions, rules, teams, players, etc. Other then watching a baseball school game or when my dad and brother have it turned on (they are big fans), I don't think I've ever watched a baseball game all the way through, from beginning to end.

That being said, here are my thoughts, starting with Brad. Do I think this was his best performance? No, but I think this was one of his BETTER performances. Pitt's character definitely had me convinced that he was Billy Beane, the stretched out GM of the Oakland Atlantics. I could feel his frustration with every sudden outburst he had on screen. One of the more tender moments had nothing to do with baseball-- it was when he was sitting in the music store with his daughter, watching her play the guitar and convincing her to sing out loud. The lyrics of the song comes full circle in the end. You'll see what I mean.

Now to the movie itself. I was worried first going into it because again, I don't know much about baseball. I was right to be worried because I will admit, there were some parts that I didn't understand. I would get the general idea, but not the full concept or importance of some of the business talk in the film. For example, when Billy and Peter (Jonah Hill's character) are trading players over the phone, it was a bit confusing. While it was supposed to be serious, I think it also was meant to be a bit comical, which I missed out on because of my lack of knowledge. My responses were prompted by their facial expressions or the air pumping of their fists.

That being said, I liked Moneyball because it leaned more towards a character driven drama then a classic baseball tale. And because of this, I can appreciate the film from that aspect. This is why some hardcore baseball fans found the movie boring. They were going into it expecting tons of baseball action. They were expecting the film to focus more on shots of the players in the locker room to the drama out on the field. Instead, the camera rarely leaves Billy Beane's world. Even when he and Peter finally get the players they think will change the game to sign on, we don't get to see the players actually play for quite awhile. And when the games ARE going on, the camera follows Billy around as he works out his anxiety in the gym room (apparently, Billy Beane did not actually watch most of the games for fear of bad luck).

I don't think you have to LOVE baseball to like the movie. I think you have to have a basic understanding of the sport to fully appreciate what it is trying to accomplish, and also go into it knowing that this is not your traditional baseball movie. The movie is not filled with 15-20 minute chunks of baseball in action. You're more likely to see a few 2 minutes clips of the real footage (the movie is based on a true story after all) throughout the film and then some short scenes of players actually playing the game.

Overall, Moneyball was a good, solid drama. While I had a little bit of trouble following the baseball politics, I did understand in general what Billy Beane was trying to do for his underdog team and change the way people look at the sport. Like Jonah Hill's character says in the beginning, GM goals shouldn't be about buying players. It should be about buying wins. Speaking of Jonah Hill, I was pleasantly surprised by his humble, serious performance. He normally plays in comedies, so I give him and whoever gave him a shot for the role major kudos. As a matter of fact, I think the acting is one of the biggest strengths of this movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman had a small part but hell, he is so good at being a chameleon that I didn't even realize it was him at first.

If there was one thing I would've added to give Moneyball a 5 star rating, instead of 4, it would be more scenes of the ""misfit"" players Billy Beane hires. Most of the people in Billy's tight circle absolutely detest his decisions for hiring these specific players, especially Philip Seymour Hoffman's character that refuses to even put them in the positions Billy hires them for. I just would have liked some more scenes maybe about their backgrounds, their frustrations, etc. It would have added a little more pull on the heartstrings.

Do I think the movie is Oscar worthy? For a nomination, definitely. For the win, not so sure. Do I think Brad should be nominated? Yes! Win? It was a solid, convincing performance. Until I view some of the other leads, I will just leave it at that!

January 1st at 12:01 they knocked on the door of former Catcher for the Boston Red Sox who was non-tendered and 12:01 was the 1st time they could sign him so obviously they feared other teams being interested, the point of signing him was to replace Giambi's, Damon's numbers...they replaced the OBP% almost but not the power, also don't forget Oakland had the studded rotation of Hudson, Mulder, Zito even a better trio than today's Halliday, Lee and Hamels...so this wasn't an improvished team that won 102 games based on misfits...true Bradford was a discovery but logical if you look at his stats, this was something overlooked or not trusted by the White Sox basically they sent him anticipating he wasn't good or would soon bomb but in actuality he never did bomb...believe me if you can put together a rotation like the 2002 A's had you can win high 90s low 100s in wins while having a middle of the pack offense...Justice made up for some of Giambi's power and more of the OBP%...also the A's were for the most part a good defensive team the Catcher turned 1st baseman actually superceded all expectations defensively and don't forget they had a gold calibar 1st baseman before trading him to Detroit in Carlos Pena...ultimately they lost to the Yankees because they didn't have the fire power offense in the playoffs but they didn't play that bad at all...this movie in a nutshell was really about belief in the system of numbers although if you can find players to fit the number system you have great players...eg finding pitchers with low whips, whips is a combo of hits, walks divided by innings pitched if you can find 10 pitchers with whips between 1.00 and 1.25 you'll win the division...same as OPS which is a combo of slugging average and on base percentage if you can find 9 starters with an average .800 OPS you'll score alot of runs...this was what the point was to believe in the numbers...versus evaluating a player by what you see or what you think will become of him...to be honest the talents will be the hitters who wait for their pitch, the best pitchers are the one's most efficient, the one's who can throw the highest percentage of pitches for strikes, walk the least, yield the least hits...duh, no baserunners no runs can score...so the system makes incredible sense...prior ERA's was used to evaluate a pitchers worth and/or strikeouts, wins now the thinking has changed to a degree...oh yeah velocity was everything, still is by most organizations but not all of them...alot of what is used was used but put away and then brought back...it's a complicated game not so simple and everyone thinks that teams with the most money win which really isn't true, there's a decent amount of teams with high payrolls that have losing records each year and teams with relatively low payrolls that win alot of games eg Tampa Bay and in recent years Minnesota.",1326412800,,2999,4.712380952380952
4902243,5,B005X5XIF6,"For those of us who love baseball, and even for those who don't, this is a wondeful 'feel good' film of statistics and brains versus intuition and brawn.

We find Billy Beane, played by Brad Pitt, GM of the Oakland Athletics, making it to the World Series but failing to win. In the process the team is losing three of its best players. The Athletics have a thirty million dollar cap on their players versus the Red Sox and New York Yanklees, who have hundreds of millions. Beane needs to replace these players, but the members of his scouting teams just give him the same old tired story of the players that will probably work out with practice. Beane wants another method to pick his players. At a meeting with another team he finds a young, short, chubby man, Peter Brand, played by Jonah Hill, who spouts statistics and crunched numbers to arrive at an algorithm for players who will do well. He hires Brand and changes his methods and that of his team.

Brand is a nerdy Yale graduate who looked at the  strict cost-benefit analysis of baseball players. He persuaded Beane that he should hire based on key performance statistics that pointed to undervalued players. They assembled a team that seemed foolhardy at first, but during the course of a season, proved itself the biggest bargain in baseball. Beane antagonized most of his scouts, but he was proved correct. At the end of the season he is invited to Boston to meet the Red Sox owner. When he returns to Oakland he talks with Brand, and tells him, ""I don't play for money, I play for the love of the game"". Oh, yes, the love of what you are doing. A lucky man and one who knows and is happy with himself. A loner, a divorced man with a daughter he loves, but all in all a man who is fine living alone.

This is not just a film for baseball lovers, but a film for all of us who can see that a new way, a change from the old ways is almost always a good thing.

4902244,4,B005X5XIF6,"MONEYBALL is gathering a lot of acclaim as an Oscar potential contender on several levels, so much so that for those who have little interest in baseball in general have overcome that inertia and have watched this film primarily out of devotion to the work of Brad Pitt.  For this viewer the film is long on tedium, lacking in excitement and character involvement and focusing on the financial background of a sport that is supposed to be for the pleasure of the public. Yes, there are moments of interest in the concept of building a team based on saving money by hiring players who by statistics realized on a computer program show potential for building a solid team (as opposed to scouting for popular 'names' with the public and the media). These moments are underlined by the strong performance of Jonah Hill as Peter Brand, the Yale Economics graduate who comes up with `the concept'.

The story is based on Michal Lewis' book `Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game' and adapted for the screen by Stan Chervin, Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian.  Bennett Miller directs.  The story is basically a docudrama about the Oakland Athletic's  General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) who is faced with the loss of the best payers of his team to scouts from other clubs with bigger dollars. If he ever wants to win the World Series, Billy must find a competitive advantage. Billy is about to turn baseball on its ear when he uses statistical data to analyze and place value on the players he picks for the team.

Oakland A's GM Billy Beane is handicapped with the lowest salary constraint in baseball. If he ever wants to win the World Series, Billy must find a competitive advantage. Billy is about to turn baseball on its ear when he uses statistical data to analyze and place value on the players he picks for the team. The rest of the film is a push pull game played in the boardroom, with the manager (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and with certain players (Chris Pratt, Stephen Bishop et al). Tossed in for some reality testing is Billy's daughter Casey (Kerris Dorsey), ex-wife (Robin Wright), and a few encounters with reappearing people.

The idea for the film is solid but it wears thin because it is so insular to Oakland.  The fact that it is a true story (with a less than satisfying ending) probably will attract some viewers.  It certainly is not Brad Pitt's best role to date, not does the film seem that it will have much holding power.  But, if you are a fan of baseball it just may ring your chimes.

4902272,5,B005X5XIF6,"Don't like sports movies?  Me neither.  They're predictable; even the best of them (I'm thinking of THE FIGHTER) ultimately succumb to genre convictions.  Have no fear, however: MONEYBALL never truly does.  Because it's not a sports movie; it's a movie about sports movies, which also happens to be based on a true story of an underdog team that came up from the depths to take the industry by storm.

Let me throw something out there, because it will become immediately transparent: with the exception of a hot girl in my high school geometry class, and Game 6 of the 2011 World Series, math and baseball are two of the most boring things in the world to me.  So when I tell you that I thoroughly enjoyed--and may even come to love--MONEYBALL, you'll get where I'm coming from.  Because it's a film about both.  It follows a general manager (Brad Pitt) who takes the advice of a novice scout (Jonah Hill) and decides to put together a team based not on money but on winning power, despite the resistance of his own scouts and managers.

The film has an impressive pedigree behind it.  Director Bennett Miller (CAPOTE) has a sure hand; he knows how to create a scene and keep a story moving along.  The script comes from the likes of Steve Zaillan (everything from SCHINDLER'S LIST to THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO) and Aaron Sorkin (""The West Wing,"" THE SOCIAL NETWORK), who both know how to craft character and story.  But this is really an actor's film, and the lead actor here is the film's anchor.  Brad Pitt gives an award-worthy performance: subtle, nuanced, not necessarily the thing that wins Oscars but that deserves to (and just might; let us hold our breath in anticipation...or not).  He's helped out with a tremendous supporting cast, most notably Jonah Hill, giving a surprisingly straight-laced (though still quietly humorous) performance, Kerris Dorsey (grossly underused as Beane's daughter), and Philip Seymour Hoffman as the resistant manager who tangles with Beane's forward-thinking policies.  They help flesh out a film that would have been an interesting story, but may have become a big of a drag.  Truly, watch this film for Pitt's performance; stay for Hill's; and relish in a true story that manages to defy genre stereotypes and is, ultimately, a refreshing ""behind the scenes"" sports film.",1326153600,2,2321,4.867684478371501
4902273,4,B005X5XIF6,"'Moneyball' underwent as many benching's and roster changes in the production stage as the Oakland A's did in their 2002 pursuit of a World Series as depicted in the film. In 2011, finally completed, `Moneyball' is a baseball movie that transcends just professional sports, but becomes a simile for determination, integrity, and life in general. This is a sports movie that elicits inspiration, not in the typical Rocky banality, but with reflective affinity that resonates with us all.

The film, based on true events, follows the small market Oakland Athletics' General Manager Billy Beane in his pursuit of a World Series with the lowest budget of any team in the league. When he is forced to gut his team after a successful season, he does so by hiring a new assistant to help him develop an entirely revolutionary concept of recruiting players based on number crunching methods. This new method derides classic scouting methods that were based on intuition and professional experience.

The film is unorthodox in that it uses the game of baseball and its players as a backdrop to what the general managers and scouts do behind the dugout in their little offices. While this film focuses on the cutthroat struggle of team management, its strength lies in the pitch perfect (pun intended) execution of the screenplay which resembles closely what 'The Social Network' did for all of its intricate computer vernacular and idioms. It is no coincidence that Aaron Sorkin was credited as a writer, making accessible all the dialogue involving player statistics and complex business transactions. This is a drama through and through, but the pacing is supplemented with understated humor, a subtle buddy complex between Jonah Hill and Brad Pitt, and some excellent shots of actual baseball (consisting of real game footage, and recreated scenes, equipped with slow motion and portrait like opaque backgrounds for epicness).

Inspiration is a key theme in most sports films because it is fundamentally inherent in the sporting world in general. Unfortunately for a lot idealistic films about (_insert sport here_), they tend to resort to clich's about larger than life golden boys who defeat insurmountable odds to the delight of everyone around them. `Moneyball' succeeds in lifting the spirits by defying this rule. Billy Beane is, of course, painted in a way that's easy to root for, he's the ultimate underdog - but he pisses a lot of people off along the way. He is human to us because he makes decisions that have consequences; this is a film that isn't afraid to see the protagonists' worst case scenario materialized. This film unearths greatness due to excellent performances, succinct execution, and an exceptionally grounded story.

If I may resort to clichs myself, Bennett Miller's `Moneyball' is a definite winner. No...it's a home run!",1326153600,,2846,5.127155172413793

The acting is sharp, the movie is fun, and the story is good.  As a movie itself, it is great.  I recommend this to anyone out there.

However...

I read the book before seeing the movie- after reading the book, the movie seems altogether a little brief, with many important details that are simply glossed over.  I am not a person who compares books vs. movies, but instead I am comparing the story of the book vs. the story of the movie.  For those who want a much more accurate account of the Oakland A's, read the book.  For those interested in a fun baseball movie, the movie should be sufficient.  For example, Jonah Hill's character in the movie isn't even a real person- he was a write-in character for the movie.  On the flip side, Paul DePodesta, a leading member of the A's front office in the time, is not portrayed in the film.  The film portrays Jonah Hill's character as introducing the team to the number crunching mentality that led to victory.  In reality, Billy Beane (portrayed by Brad Pitt) had been intrigued for awhile with sabermetrics for awhile and slowly built a front office that reflected his desire to implement this with the team.

Once again, if you want an accurate portrayal of the story, read the book.  If you want a fun, slightly rewritten account of the story, watch this movie.  I enjoyed the movie for what it was, but it isn't accurate to what really happened.",1326153600,4,1551,4.489285714285714

I want to see this teams competing in a fair fight. Teams like the Yankees, Red Sox, Phillies and yes, even my Angels have an unfair advantage.

Brad is amazing as Brad always is.  I am not sure why Philip Hoffman did the role.  He has very limited screen time and his character is very limited in range.  It does not take much to play the grumpy baseball manager.  I really like him as an actor and he does a fine job, I just felt his talent was a little wasted in this role.",1326153600,,549,4.0

The Film 4.5/5

Moneyball is a refreshing change from the usual type of sports movie. How many times have you watched the story of an underdog triumphing? How many movies introduce us to a controversial coach who is initially resented because of his methods and then revered by all when he succeeds? This story is certainly a celebration of success, but not in the typical sense. In fact, it asks us to define success.

It's based on the true story of how General Manager Billy Beane (Pitt) employed a new way of thinking in order to enable the Oakland Athletics to compete with the likes of the New York Yankees. He did this with just one third of the payroll of that available to the Yankees. The opening scenes show Beane negotiating with the team's owner. He knows that his payroll won't jump from $40 million to $120 million, but can he get a little more money to help the A's compete?

The first thing I was taught in my college marketing class was to define the problem. How you can analyze a problem if you don't know what it is? You won't solve anything until you know what you are trying to do. I find that I use the same technique in all areas of my life. If a friend needs help or advice, I ask a series of questions so that they can eventually define their own problem. It works. That's what Beane did at the start of Moneyball.

Beane's first move was to hire Peter Brand (Hill); an economics graduate from Yale. Instead of relying on traditional scouting methods, Brand used statistical analysis to determine the true value of baseball players. Instead of paying huge salaries based on a player's potential, he sought out value by considering players who were believed to have flaws. These might include injury or advancing age. Beane collaborated with Brand to assemble a team on a low budget. Departing stars were replaced with players who were a good fit for the team.

I have a strong connection with the film because the way Beane and Brand think reminds me of how I manage my Fantasy Football teams. Which players are good value because age or injury has changed people's perceptions of their true ability? How much are this year's top draft picks really going to be worth when compared to proven veterans? I make those determinations every year when I build my team. Beane and Brand think like I do, and we tend to like people who are similar to ourselves.

I rely on my own way of thinking rather than following conventional wisdom. That doesn't mean I will ignore everything, but I will question the opinions of others and decide whether I agree. It's something I have done my entire life and one reason I review movies. You might not agree with me, and that's absolutely fine, but at least you know that I'm not just repeating the opinions of others. Take a look at my thoughts on The Artist if you want an example.

Groupthink is a dangerous thing. I encounter it every year in my Fantasy Football leagues when the rankings of the ""experts"" all start to look the same. If you go against the grain, you'll have to be ready to defend your view. As a result, people are afraid to say what they really think or act on their true instincts. It also happens in the workplace. In fact, you can find examples of groupthink every day if you seek out opinions on the Internet on just about any topic.

Back to Moneyball.

Look at how Beane's scouts present their opinions. How many are really their opinions, and how many of them fail to think outside the established framework?

The dialogue is intelligent and full of humor. Some of the scenes, such as Beane pursuing trades with other teams, are quite exciting. Pitt and Hill work well together and are in most of the scenes. One source of conflict is Coach Art Howe (Hoffman). He's concerned about his own situation and future in the sport, and is reluctant to adopt Beane's desired strategy.

I enjoyed Moneyball because it was different and the story was told in an appealing way. I won't ruin the ending for those who don't remember whether the A's won the World Series, but I will say that the story doesn't show a huge amount of baseball action. This is about the people behind the scenes and the way in which they affected the sport.

Rarely has 133 minutes of Dialogue been so interesting. The time passes almost too quickly. I've seen Moneyball about six times since buying it in January, so there's no need to wonder about the replay value. From my ramblings in this review, you can see how thought-provoking the story can be.

***Spoiler Alert***

One final point I would like to consider is Beane's decision at the end of the film.

Most of us are trained at a very young age to chase success and be the best we can be. Success is usually defined as having a good job, a great salary, expensive and prestigious possessions, and a traditional family. If we reach any of our goals, we set new ones and want more. We always want more.

Beane's final decision mirrored his thoughts on baseball management. He considered what would truly make him happy. I don't see people thinking along those lines very often. We are trapped by the expectations of society. It's groupthink on a grand scale. Ask your friends what they dream of. How many mention money? That's the wrong answer. Money is a tool that helps you live the way you want to live, but it's not the overall goal. The goal is different for everyone and should be what makes you happy. Does your lifestyle actually allow you time to enjoy that happiness?

Would you have made the same choice as Beane?

Video Quality 4/5

Sony's presentation looks great for the most part. There's plenty of detail and depth. Colors appear accurate and well-defined. The only minor fault is the presence of noise in many of the scenes. It doesn't ruin the experience, but it's hard to dismiss it completely. The movie uses a few TV shots and some archive footage, and that's clearly of lesser quality than the majority of the presentation. That's purely intentional and no fault in the transfer.

Audio Quality 4/5

This is a story which relies more on dialog than anything else. It rises to the occasion when required, such as during baseball games, but it's fairly subtle overall.

4902314,3,B005X5XIF6,"I read ""Moneyball"" several times before seeing the movie.  In my opinion, the movie did not capture the entire story of what the Oakland A's had achieve when forming this low budget team.  The story is about Billy Beane, and how he built a team based on statistics, not on the established player evaluation system. The movie failed to mention the drafting process where Bean and Paul Depodesta (played by Jonah Hill) seen the value of college ballplayers compared to high school standouts.  Most teams were drafting high school star players while Oakland concentrated on the mature college athlete.  It also failed to mention their star pitchers like Zeto, Mulder and Hudson also drafted by the A's and instrumental in their success.
I thought Brad Pitt did not portray Bean in the same context as in the book. Pitt, comes across as a monotonous lack of character Oakland GM.  Pitt's dialogue in the movie was limited to his chewing tobacco and mumbling a few words. This role would be perfect for Matthew McConaughey (Lincoln Lawyers) as a smooth talking GM portrayed in the book.  There are other actors who would fit the part and portray Bean as a more stimulating character than Pitt.  I can't imagine anyone who has read the book would nominate Pitt for a best actor oscar.

The book was great the movie a reluctant good, Pitts acting leaves much to be desired.",1325980800,4,1366,4.758474576271187
4902315,5,B005X5XIF6,"The Cardinals and Yankees are the only 2 teams to win more championships than the A's. The A's have always played second fiddle to the Giants in the Bay Area, thanks to a biased media and bandwagon fans. Until 2010, the Giants didn't win any (in SF)...the A's have won 4 (in Oakland and 9 overall). The A's have been catagorized as a small market team. This movie was a great insight on how the A's must cope with an owner who may or may not have any money (Schott in the movie) and is as cheap as Charlie Finley was (Wolff is this now). The A's have had much more success than the Giants historically, though the Giants pour tons of money into new ballparks and players. This is the beauty of baseball and it is depicted well in this movie as the A's (as the ugly step-sister) have had success regardless of who has owned them. Back in 2002, Beane was doing the right thing as shown here in the movie. Unfortunately, it is as if nowadays he has grown a bit weary and trades players like it's a habit for him; much makes absolutely no sense at all. The movie is an excellent portrayal of Beane at his finest from about 1999-2003...GREAT movie!!!",1325894400,,1145,4.305555555555555

4902321,4,B005X5XIF6,"Moneyball is based on the true story of Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane and the revolutionary way he began to make personnel decisions in 2002. Adapted from the novel written by Michael Lewis, who also penned the highest grossing sports-themed movie of all time with The Blind Side, it has all the elements of a big hit except it is less reliant on making a powerful emotional attachment. Instead it trades that for a general theme of touting the underdogs and a reliance on statistics and analysis. That makes Moneyball an interesting film but one that will be more limited in its appeal.

Brad Pitt stars as Beane and does a fantastic job of portraying the day-to-day struggles of a man who is under pressure to put together a winner but doesn't have the funding that large market teams receive. His performance is subtle but very effective, as is Jonah Hill who plays understated well - an improvement on the hyper-active roles with which he has started to wear thin. Hill plays Peter Brand, a Yale economics graduate who helps implement the new system and way of thinking as Beane's assistant GM.

Taking on the idea of imperfect players and rounding them into a successful team works well in the sense that the audience roots for them. Beane also comes across as charismatic and being in the underdog role it is fun to watch him strive for success and painful to see the low moments that are experienced along the way.

One doesn't have to be a baseball fan or even a sports fan to appreciate and enjoy the film. While the baseball scenes are well shot - and interspersed with real life footage - the focus is instead on what is happening behind the scenes. For someone like myself that is fascinated by all of that it was really interesting to see. Everything from the analyzing of statistics and watching tape, to discussing player moves with scouts, notifying players of being cut or traded, attempting trades with other GMs, or talking about the state of the team with the owner - all were handled really well and allowed to play out without being rushed.

There is also the inclusion of flashbacks to Beane's past as a highly-touted prospect who busted in the majors. That gives good perspective into his current thinking and creates some conflict with the traditional scouting system - providing perspective on why he would be more likely to buck that system and try something new.

The 2002 A's are remembered for their impressive regular season run after a slow start - including a record-breaking win streak. Unfortunately they didn't advance out of the divisional round of the playoffs and to many that dampens the importance of the message and whether ""moneyball"" actually made the impact that some claim it has. Elements of it however have become the norm in evaluating players league wide so it has at least influenced the sport and that makes the drive to prove it successful in the film worthwhile to watch evolve.

For everything I appreciated in how Moneyball was made (script, acting, pacing, score) nothing really pushed it beyond just being a film with a number of elements that I admired. I really liked liked it but ultimately didn't love it. It's hard to pinpoint why that is exactly - maybe it was the more thin angle having to do with Beane's family or how the events of a lengthy baseball season are difficult to compress into a short period of time without making certain reactions seem more dramatic than they would be otherwise. Regardless I walked away from the movie thinking something was missing but that could just be because it doesn't take the traditional crowd-pleasing turn and instead has a few moments of more subdued success to rally around.

Moneyball is a great display of how to translate a story that wouldn't have been thought suitable to become a film and make it a compelling watch. The characters and events are interesting even if it doesn't take the typical arc - though in a sense that makes it all the more fascinating to see develop. It's a film appreciated for what it attempts and what it ultimately accomplishes though it may not fully connect on an emotional level.",1325548800,4,4136,4.728155339805825

4902323,5,B005X5XIF6,"""Moneyball""  is the story of the Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) and his then-unheard-of policy of relying on cold statistics to acquire players who could score runs.  With a budget that prevented the team from snagging acknowledged top talent and competing with the deep pockets of the Yankees and Red Sox, Beane teams up with the Harvard-educated economist Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) to rebuild the club and make it competitive.

This is an unusual baseball movie since most of it takes place off the field and images of actual play do not dominate.  Performances are terrific, from Pitt's rebellious Beane, bucking the accumulated wisdom of his scouts who rely on their instincts and the age and physical condition of players, to Jonah Hill, who departs from his goofy sidekick roles to take on an actual, believable character.  The scenes between Pitt and Hill are especially enjoyable.  They have great chemistry.  Philip Seymour Hoffman plays team manager Art Howe, a guy who clearly draws a line in the sand when it comes to game strategy and has little love or respect for Beane.

Sports films always face the problem of appealing to a wide audience, and casting Pitt in the lead role is certainly one way to lick the problem.  The script by Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin takes us into the offices of a mid-level major league baseball team, underscoring the tensions, resentments, disappointments, and resistance to new ideas.  Those who think baseball is only a game will see that it is big business predicated on taking chances on players who are undervalued, past their prime, or injured.

A few scenes show Billy with his daughter (Kerris Dorsey) and ex-wife (Robin Wright), but they are incidental.  The movie really percolates when we see Billy working the phone with another general manager, trying to make the most advantageous deal, or when he has to move ahead with a method of team building that is contrary to the status quo.

""Moneyball"" is available in a two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack.  Bonus extras include a blooper reel and featurettes on the real Billy Beane, drafting the team, playing the game, and adapting the original book into film.

4902324,5,B005X5XIF6,"I'll start this review by mentioning a small detail about me that I think is important to this review.  I am a huge baseball fan.  As I said in my Review title, if you aren't a baseball person in the least, you will most likely not enjoy this movie and you could stop reading here.  For all others, here goes..

Moneyball is based of of a book which explains how Baseball has become a business.  A business in which the richest teams always have the upper hand over teams that never had deep enough pockets to afford the best players on the market.  This is a true story, which to my surprise was extremely well-told through movie adaptation.

Quick Plot Rundown: This is the story of Billy Beane (Pitt), who is the GM of the Oakland Athletics, a team which is pretty self-explanatory for baseball fans (no offense, A's fans).  He takes Peter Brand (Hill) under his wing and goes a different route to create a winning team with very little money - by way of finding cheap players with specific stats that are the most important to winning baseball games.  Basically, its a team of average joe's, some not even average.

The movie in my opinion was fantastic, but I know for sure that it will not be for everyone.  Brad Pitt's performance was great, and Jonah Hill really surprised me with how awesome he played his character.  The movie is a bit long (133 min.) and does have it's slow moments, but it also has moments that had the whole theatre laughing when I had gone to see it.  It was a nice balance of serious and humorous.

My Bottom line is if you know about the politics of baseball, and want to know how some of the most unlikely teams became champions, you should check this movie out.  However, the bigger a baseball fan you are, the more you will appreciate this movie.",1325376000,,1782,4.423312883435583

4902327,5,B005X5XIF6,"Baseball is such a great American game and this movie really takes an interesting look at a behind the scenes scenario revolving around Billy Beane's Oakland Athletics during the 2002 season.

Brad Pitt, like all his movies, does a fantastic job in Money Ball.  He is funny, intense, and charismatic throughout the entire movie.  He really does a great job at depicting Billy Beane the general manager for a big league club, and Billy Beane the person.  He displays his renagade approach to dealing with authority and the adverse situation he was forced into.  Jonah Hill plays Peter Brand, Beane's right hand man and Yale economist who is good with numbers, especially pertaining to baseball statistics.  This is definitely the best role I have seen him in.

Basically, Pitts character and Jonah Hills character team up to find players who are cheap and who score runs.  The upcoming season features a roster where all the A's players leave to big market clubs and Beane has a small budget to work with.  Brand's keen mathmatical mind is what they rely on to choose their players.  They both team up to accomplish the ultimate goal: to win the World Series.

Obviously, most baseball fans know what happened on the field.  But this movies takes a different approach and examines what went on behind the closed doors.  It was fabulously acted and featured a great cast who all do an excellent job at telling this true story.  It is an inspirational movie with funny parts and rather dismal and serious scenes.  This movies has it all and is a must own for any sports fan or fan of sports movies.  In my opinion, this is right up there with ""For the Love of the Game"" and ""The Rookie.""  Definitely check out this truly original and classic film.",1325116800,3,1744,4.684210526315789

4902329,4,B005X5XIF6,"I know little about baseball, but I quite liked this movie. It is the true story about how Oaklands Athletics manager Billy Beane (a fine performance by Brad Pitt), facing the loss of some of his best players after the end of the season, and with very little budget to hire good replacements, decided to apply statistical methods to find good but undervalued (and therefore, cheap) players. By traveling this path, he gets the opposition of much of the official baseball establishment (though this should not be exaggerated). To help him in this endeavor, he hired a young university graduate (played by Jonah Hill) to whom he soon becomes a mentor, introducing him to the business side of baseball. With these methods, Beane assembled a team for the following season that, while was unable to win the championship, did make it to the playoffs, and generally did much better than expected initially.

The filmmakers are honest enough not to show Beane as a completely nice guy. He has a bad temper. He is cold and aloof with the players (he never travels with the team), refusing to become friends with them, in order to be easier to fire them. It is hinted that he wasn't that good as a husband. Despite these flaws, he is a compelling, generally sympathetic character.

The movie basically believes that human intuition (in the form of the aging scouts) is no match for the mathematical and statistical methods of young nerds. If one has the romantic notion that not everything in life can be quantified, and that in some fields the human brain can still do better than a computer, then one feels oneself to be on the other side of the argument proposed by this movie.

Also, although I'm not very knowledgeable about baseball, it seems to me that the changes proposed by Beane (no stolen bases, emphasis on reaching first base and not taking unnecessary risks) makes for a duller, if more standardized, game. So whether the end result of these changes he proposed made for a more entertaining game, it is debatable.

But despite the fact that I was a bit uncomfortable with its thesis, I did like and enjoy the film.",1325030400,,2119,4.718918918918919

4902331,4,B005X5XIF6,"I was pleasantly surprised that this movie lived up to the hype I had heard before seeing it. Well-acted, well directed and full of great information for casual fans.
HOWEVER, I think this could have been even better had the film started when the book did, in 1997 when Beane first took over the A's franchise. That was when Beane continued the sabermetric strategy (designed by his predecessor Sandy Alderson) to create a winning ballclub for an owner that refused to spend money (Not, as the film would have you believe, because he didn't have it, but because he wanted to keep it in his own pocket) to build the A's teams that made the postseason from 2000-2003.
  One problem in this movie is that while the A's had lost Giambi, Damon, and Isringhausen, they were hardly gutted after the 2001 season. They still had 3 of the best starters in baseball in Barry Zito (Cy Young 2002), Tim Hudson and Mark Mulder, they had probably the best offensive left side of the infield in the game with Eric Chavez and Miguel Tejada (MVP 2002), and a good outfield with Terrence Long and Jermaine Dye. The 2002 A's won 103 games and were tied for the best record in all of baseball.
  This film would have you believe that baseball is a game if Davids vs. Goliaths, and to an extent it is, but mostly because incredibly wealthy owners use the excuse of ""small market"" to avoid spending their own money or the free money teams like the Yankees and Red Sox give them due to luxury taxes on their high payrolls. Accountability is more the problem than lack of funds. So, watch this movie and enjoy the loads of information on the inner workings or baseball GMs and the new take on recognizing talent that Beane made famous, but realize that  it's a little biased toward a ""poor"" team like the A's, whose main problem was and is miserly ownership, not lack of funds to compete with the ""big boys"" of baseball.",1325030400,,1895,4.513119533527697
4902332,5,B005X5XIF6,"I admit that (as a non-sports fan) I don't typically enjoy sports-themed films. They tend to be uplifting or inspiring in some way, but they're ultimately just too generic for my taste. Moneyball, based on Michael Lewis' book of the same name and derived from a true story, isn't a run-of-the-mill baseball movie and successfully breaks from some of those generic conventions, while managing to be crowd-pleasing enough for the average viewer. Adapted by two Academy Award-winning screenwriters, Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin (coincidentally, the writers behind David Fincher's previous two films), it's an intelligent, well-structured film that moves quickly and hits all the right emotional cues.

`Based on a true story' is a relative term in Hollywood and I'm not sure how closely Moneyball sticks to the truth in its story, but that has little bearing on how well the story is told. Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane, a former Major League baseball player, working as the general manager of the Oakland Athletics. Upset with his underfunded team's recent loss and the impending departure of three star players, Billy attempts to overcome the financial restrictions that stand in his way of putting together a competitive. At a failed meeting, Billy meets Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a young man with an economics degree from Yale, who specializes in player analysis. Using a sabermetric approach, based on a theory by Bill James, Brand has formulated an unorthodox way to assess a player's value. Beane hires Peter as Assistant General Manager and begins to put his theories to the test, despite the opposition from the more traditional baseball scouts who don't see the theories assisting Billy's ramshackle team. Billy faces a particularly dismissive attitude from the Oakland A's manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who refuses to put some of Billy and Peter's ideas into motion due to his stress of working under a one-year contract. Baseball history buffs may know how everything pans out here, but I found it mostly unexpected.

Pitt is charismatic and quick-witted in his role. It's a gum-smacking, charming performance that is just subtle enough to score a potential Oscar win. He has some tough competition, but appearing in two of the best films of the year certainly won't hurt his chances. Hill has received some attention for playing against type and he shows a previously unseen dramatic depth playing Peter Brand. Hill has been written off in some circles as a one-note comedic actor, but with his performance here and in last year's Cyrus he proves that he may have quite the emotional well to tap from. I wouldn't call his performance Oscar-worthy (no reflection on him, it's just not written to be), but his character is such a departure from his typical sarcastic persona, as well as likable and meek enough, that he may be nominated for one of the big awards. The screen is populated with some fine actors, but with so much focus on Pitt and Hill most are relegated to the background. Hoffman, reuniting with director Bennett Miller, who directed Hoffman to Oscar glory in Capote, deserves some recognition for his role as the cynical manager. Also noteworthy is Robin Wright as Billy's ex-wife and director Spike Jonze, in a one-scene role, as Wright's awkward new husband.

Unheard of in a baseball movie, there is more focus on people behind the scenes rather than on the field. The statistics and those who used them are the focal point, with attention being given to the players and actual on-field games only when it's necessary for an emotional payoff or to further the plot. Like he did in his Oscar-winning script for The Social Network, Sorkin takes numbers and data that would be incomprehensible to the average person in life and dull/confusing onscreen and somehow makes these pass by in an accessible, compelling manner. Along with Zaillian, he has made the thinking-man's baseball movie that, ironically, does the thinking for you.

Moneyball is a strange version of the Hollywood, sports film that follows the traditional template enough to draw viewers in and breaks from it enough to please viewers looking for something a little different. With two of Hollywood's brightest screenwriters, a talented director, and an eclectic cast giving some terrific performances, it carries a rather anti-Hollywood message and is accessible enough to be enjoyed by sports fans and non-sports fans. Against the odds, it's an exceptional slice of Americana and extraordinarily crowd-pleasing entertainment.

This film has been in talks since quite a while, after watching it I can only say that this film is good no-doubt but nothing great about it.
Simple story, good screenplay and strong performance. I felt like I was watching a B-version of ""Miracle"". Wherein Miracle was a great story, with equally weighted screen space for all the actors, Moneyball talks about Brad Pitt and Brad Pitt alone. Not for one second does the camera go away from him, which is a treat for Pitt fans but nonetheless, if you consider the film as a whole it will be just good. I don't understand what is with the critics and Pitt, but they go all 'Gaga' when someone says his name. He is very good in the film, but mind you not great nor is it any groundbreaking performance. The film revolves around Brad Pitt and the film has no possible spoilers, the baseball matches aren't shown, just a quick transition from one match to another. Never in the film was I intrigued or totally involved as it has no substance. I'd rather buy a better film like ""Warrior"" (another highly underrated and neglected film which is a triumph for real) again than buy 'Moneyball' and waste my money on a stupid ball game (too cheesy? :P )",1324944000,5,1309,4.476987447698745

It's a good sign when you're two hours into a film and wishing it would go on another two. Pitt carries this one so well that it's just a pleasure watching him work, and the script is what lets him be this good.

Everything is measured yet compelling, and every bit role is cast and played perfectly. Some movies just feel good from front to back, and Moneyball is in that league. Then again, I love baseball, so maybe I'm biased, but I'd put this one up there with Bang The Drum Slowly and Bull Durham.

It was a great real-life story, and so many details are caught just right in this exemplary screenplay. The score has moments of real beauty, and the heavy drama during the 20th win is played to the hilt while the music says it all. It's a treat to see a movie round the bases this convincingly.

It was great in its understated script and execution.  Having been an A's season ticket holder for these very years, it was interesting to see how this maps onto ""reality"".  It seems pretty close -- as far as movies go -- although I feel that the A's manager, Art Howe, was needlessly thrown under the bus.  I'm not sure why they made him seem like such a malcontent.

My youngest son and I were extras in the crowd for one night of the filming in Oakland -- the final game 20. It was interesting to see, from row 2, how a whole night's worth of shooting turn into about 6-8 seconds of the final film.  Although we've seen the movie twice in the theaters, we'll have to wait for the blu-ray version to see if our faces are in the film at all.  It flashes by pretty quickly.

4902338,5,B005X5XIF6,"You've seen variations on this plot before: an established business is disturbed when the hotshot comes in with an emphasis on the bottom line and effectiveness statistics. The newcomer shakes things up, but soon learns that the old timers have a lot of wisdom and the most important element of any business really is heart.
In 1957's ""The Desk Set"", Spencer Tracy tries to bring these new fangled computers to the research department of a television network until Katherine Hepburn shows him that a machine can't match the heart of a librarian.
In 1986's slightly racist, ""Gung Ho"", Gedde Watanabe tries to turn around an American auto plant with the principles of Japanese efficiency until Michael Keaton shows him that those business models are no match for the heart of the American worker.
Even last year's ""The Company Men"" pitted the sinister bottom lined focused Craig T. Nelson in the world of shipping versus Tommy Lee Jones who, once again, values people as people, not as economic units that can be eliminated to help the stock prices. (Not a bad little film, this.)
This year's ""Moneyball"" takes some of these same themes into the world of professional baseball. Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt) comes to the Oakland A's and tries to turn around the fortunes of a small market team. The film pits Beane as a manager who values cost cutting, statistics and the bottom line vs. the coaching and scouting staff who value intuition, institutional wisdom and decisions made by the gut.
Except this time, the film gets the audience to root for the guy with the metaphorical slide rules. Beane comes saying he doesn't care whether a player looks good in a uniform or has ""heart"", he just wants to know the player's on base percentage.
And Beane is forced by the owner's budget to highly value the bottom line.
Yes, through the film, we see Beane honoring the dignity of players (as a former player himself) and making decisions not at all based on economic factors. But the importance of science, statistics and economics shines through.
One of the most amazing feats of the film is making what on its face is a very dry subject (baseball strategy and building a team) into a very entertaining, funny, and touching film. (A friend of mine, who hates sports, enjoyed the film.) A lot of the credit goes to the script writers, Steven Zaillian (""Schindler's List"") and Aaron Sorkin (who last year made a topic even more unlikely, the founding of Facebook, into a wonderful film, ""The Social Network"".)
Credit must also go to Pitt and Jonah Hill (as his assistant) presenting a highly unlikely partnership that blooms into a wonderful friendship. Readers of the fine book which this film is based on might be surprised by the addition of Beane's family life, which makes this one of the few father/daughter baseball films.",1324339200,,2825,4.82680412371134

They sign a catcher (Chris Pratt) who can't throw, an outfielder (Nick Porrazzo) with an iron glove, a ""has been"" with bad knees (Stephen Bishop), and a pitcher (Casey Bond) who throws underhand. The stat they use to obtain talent in the film is primarily ""On Base Percentage"" (OBP).

Philip Seymour Hoffman, nearly unrecognizable with his head shaved, plays Art Howe the field manager of the team. The movie is interrupted by flash backs in Billy Beane's baseball player career, and his present home life. Art Howe doesn't like the team he has been dealt and fails to manager the team according to the expectations of Billy Beane. This is primarily the fault of Billy Beane who failed to bring in Art Howe on the decision making process to obtain the new players. Howe looks at them as being defective and unusable.

I am, however, a long-time fan of Michael Lewis dating back to his debut with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Liar-s-Poker/dp/039333869X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Liar's Poker</a>.

Lewis' hard-won approval says a lot about the combined talents of director Bennett Miller, screenwriters Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin, producer/star Pitt and an inspired cast, most notably Jonah Hill (an unlikely but relevatory pick as composite character, Peter Brand) and Phil Hoffman (who nails the dyspeptic Art Howe and his Venus and Mars relationship with Beane).  They distilled the essence of the story, delicately nailing the balance that Lewis achieves in the book: the juxtaposition of the deep-dive into the statistical arcania of Sabermetrics hard alongside rich character studies of the fascinating, complex Beane (Lewis knew he hit a goldmine there) and intriguing cases like Scott Hatteberg, a player whose career both defined and vindicated this new approach to baseball.  That juxtaposition is the Lewis oeuvre in a nutshell: it's the same feat he pulled off in ""The Blind Side"" (unlike ""Moneyball,"" that film's makers gave only the briefest glimpse to the economics behind the fascination with Michael Oher's playing potential)

About the only headscratcher here: why Paul Depodesta (Bean's real-life Peter Brand) would pull his participation from the film.

4902344,3,B005X5XIF6,"I was somewhat underwhelmed by ""Moneyball"".  Perhaps my expectations were simply too high.  The film is based on a book by Michael Lewis.  I had previously read ""Liar's Poker"" and thought it to be a great piece of modern literature.  The film also had a top quality cast including Brad Pitt in the lead role.  What could have gone wrong?  I'm not really sure but the whole package didn't gel.

In brief, ""Moneyball"" covers a season in the life of the Oakland A's, an American major league baseball team.  The franchise is not rich as it is based in a comparatively small and not particularly wealthy region.  In fact, the team has only a third to spend in comparison with the New York Yankees.  On this basis alone, the team will always lose in the long run.

However, within this difficult environment, the viewer is introduced to Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) who is the manager of the team.  Billy understands his situation and knows he cannot compete on the basis of money alone.  He has to be creative.  He is assisted in this task by the chance discovery of Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) who is a nerdy baseball statistics geek.  It is Peter who convinces Billy to look deeper into the numbers to locate unwanted and, therefore, cheap, playing talent.

Although the film is based on a true baseball story, it fails to please.  Something is missing.  To baseball aficionados, my word may seem sacrilegious.  However, the fact remains that the film is based on a weak thread and the quality of the cast is unable to overcome this handicap.",1322092800,10,1532,4.607407407407408
4902345,5,B005X5XIF6,"this is a script that would make the all-star team in script heaven.  not without a few bumps though.  okay:  maybe i wasn't paying attention enough at first, because i missed the magic in the ""meet cute"" scene,  where brad pitt first spots jonah hill (perhaps because i was distracted by the los angeles county government buildings out the window in a scene that was supposedly happening in cleveland!)  and frankly, at first i had some doubts about the character of billy and his curve ball move.  it just seemed a bit perverse in a slightly too smart hollywood manner.  but the story grows.  not the plot, mind you:  this story works like a real yarn should-- a ball of yarn, slowly winding itself up in an organic way.  about an hour into the show, that ball of yarn becomes a fast ball.

along the way, there are some pitch perfect scenes that steal the spotlight, especially in the scout's room, where we're treated to the most hard boiled cast of vignettes since the news room scenes in ""his girl friday.""  another gem is the first scene with the daughter, where we hear her sing a little tune that becomes a cyber greek chorus later on.  it's affecting without being arch.

praise,  too,  to director bennett miller, who -- just as he did in capote-- reserves visual poetry for interludes.  but when he needs it, it's spare, pure, heroic.  mostly, though, he seems to be incapable of delivering a false moment.

as for brad pitt,  he delivers a serious performance.

that said, i do have some reservations about the winning strategy the jonah hill character devises.  yes, ""moneyball"" seems to give david a chance to slay goliath, but i do agree with some of the scouts who voice the conventional wisdom that numbers can never replace the right brain.  (and even if they could, i guess it would mostly mean that we humans are over and done with.)  but, in the end, this isn't a movie about a math genius or a business model.  it's a beautifully modulated entertainment/work of art about a man trying to give his life meaning.  and proof that-- and here's a wonderful irony--  despite the moneyball formulas that have mostly ruined the movies,  hollywood isn't dead yet!",1321574400,2,2177,4.628272251308901
4902346,5,B005X5XIF6,"I love baseball. Played 14 seasons growing up. Even helped win some championships. Batting was always my favorite. There's nothing more intense than standing there, staring down the pitcher, bat twisting between your palms, waiting for the ball to come whipping out of that hand at insane speeds. Fielding was good too. I mostly played pitcher, first, second, shortstop, third, left, right, and center. Plus, when my dad was the manager, every night he'd look over all of the players' stats with me and spend hours agonizing over how to arrange the team to create the perfect fun/success ratio.

What I'm saying is, I know a thing or two about baseball, so when I go to a movie on the subject, I expect a lot, and if they don't get it right, I'll tear into it with a passion.

They got it right.

But then again, it almost wasn't a baseball movie. Brad Pitt plays Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane at a time when the team's just lost its three star players. Faced with the difficulty of getting new hotshots on a bare bones budget, Beane turns to economy major Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). Brand convinces Beane that stars don't win games. Runs win games, and runs aren't scored with big hits and amazing plays in the field. They're scored by getting on base.

Beane takes this advice to heart and throws out all the conventional wisdom of baseball sages, willing to hire players who don't know anything about fielding as long as they can take pitches and end up with a walk. Most of the film is about people who think they know baseball not believing in this new system and Beane trying to stick with it in the face of early failure. Like I said, it's not a baseball movie.

But The Social Network was a movie about computer programming, and if they can make that exciting, I guess they can do it with anything. Brad Pitt helps with a great performance as the conflicted manager, and Jonah Hill is surprisingly good. The success of the film rests squarely on their shoulders, and while shots of endless statistics scrolling across a computer screen are a little cheesy, they're not that bad. As the film builds up the hopelessness of being such a monetarily poor team, you can't help but root for them. Right from the beginning, you'll be emotionally hooked, and it won't let up until the very end.

One of the cool differences about this underdog story is that the characters aren't stars. The power wasn't inside them all along. Instead, you're rooting for the players to get walks, to get hit by pitches, to hit scrappy singles, to allow runs to score on a bunt and take the easy out. The movie gets around this by making the climax not about a championship, but about the potential for a record-breaking winning streak, and man is it exciting.

Another key difference is that, for something advertised as a pure sports drama, it's surprisingly funny. I think I laughed harder at this than at The Hangover 2. In fact, I think it's the funniest movie I've been to this year.

This movie makes you believe. It's makes you believe on the same level as Remember the Titans or any of the great sports movies, except you believe not in the players, but in the power of statistics, and for some reason you care. When the other characters in the film refuse to believe, when they work at every opportunity to undermine and diminish our hero, Statistics, you want to punch them in their grubby little faces. I love when a film can really make me despise somebody, and Moneyball pulls it off.

If you love baseball or Brad Pitt or sports movies or economics or feeling emotions or laughing or good cinema in general, go see this movie. It's worth your time.",1321228800,62,3654,4.566412213740458
4902347,3,B005X5XIF6,"I guess this is a true story, or truly a story. The acting and production is excellent.  There is subtle humor and some interesting ideas, but the story is a cliche.  You know, hapless team, total underdog, makes good.  Well not quite, that's a bit of a new twist--that's a bow to the facts.

A couple of things I did not like about Moneyball:  I like baseball and this movie presents a cynical attitude toward the game at the major league level--it is all about money, sharp dealing, and wining wining wining.  I left the theatre feeling like I never wanted to watch another pro ballgame.  Actually the movie contains little about baseball as it is played, as a sport.  Also the father/daughter line was opaque to me, not developed, or made clear.  Why bring it in at all if it is not to be a meaningful part of the story?

I was entertained by the movie.  I felt that I got my money's worth.  That's it.  I will continue to enjoy baseball despite this movie.",1320278400,,960,4.386363636363637
4902348,5,B005X5XIF6,"Moneyball is a special kind of movie, because it sheds light on how unbalanced Major League clubs were following the advent of free agency, and players going to the teams with the highest bidding. Billy Beane (played  brilliantly by Brad Pitt) is a loyal person who tries in vain to find a way to win with a small payroll. With his 2001 team dismantling before his very eyes, he meets Peter Brand, who he quickly recruits for the A's front office (assistant general manager). Beane becomes a believer in Brand's perception of talent, and tries to sell it to skeptical front office personnel. In the middle of it all is a disagreeable Art Howe, who doesn't want much to do with the radical changes and certain on-field moves; this causes friction between he and Beane, and the stage is set for a disasterous season........or is it? What I liked the most about this movie was the fact that it had just the right amount of humor in it, and gives a feel for what it's like to be a general manager in MLB. Pitt plays  the busy businessman, and makes frequent trips to the clubhouse to try to inspire his players. The most touching part of the movie is when he turns down $12,500,000 to run the Boston Red Sox. Beane's heart lies with the Athletics, and as impressive and appealing as the Red Sox were, he stays in Oakland, because it's unfinished business. Watching this movie made me realize that there's still some loyalty left in the old game.",1320105600,,1441,4.538461538461538
4902349,5,B005X5XIF6,"At the 2011 Oscars, an unlikely movie about King George VI speech impediment won the night and surprised everybody with it's ability to turn what seemed to be really boring subject into a winner of a movie. The same may be the case with ""Moneyball"", a movie that may be one of the best sports movies of all time and even though it's about baseball, much of the movie takes place in the offices, watching game tapes, crunching stats, making deals and trying to figure out how the Oakland A's, with a budget of $38 million, can compete with the New York Yankees with a budget of 140 million.

Brad Pitt gives maybe the best performance of his career as real life Oakland A's General Manager Billy Beane, who's own major league fall from grace led him to the front office and to his unorthodox thinking on how to be a winner on a budget. ""Moneyball"" is full of talk of stats, jargon, lingo and never once did I think that somebody who could care less about this sort of stuff would not enjoy the movie. The movie, while portraying a real life baseball team trying to survive in a league where top teams can outbid everybody, is constantly hilarious and poignant.

While we follow the story of how Billy Beane rebuilds his team using players who have great OBP (on base percentage) the movie also mirrors the life of Billy Beane and how he was touted as a number one draft pick, but fell rapidly from grace, bouncing from team to team and down to the minors before disappearing. This story means a lot in the grand scheme of things and so does the movie as a whole. It's a true underdog story and it shows that the status quo way of thinking, isn't always the correct way of thinking.

Moneyball is without question the first movie of the season that will be talked about come oscar time. A brilliant screenplay that just as ""The King's Speech"" had to be in order to keep people riveted, Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin did the same with ""Moneyball"". You may think it isn't your kind of movie, but it is.",1320105600,,2000,4.414634146341464
4902350,5,B005X5XIF6,"They say that few things are as American as baseball. Maybe apple pie, but even that is a close decision. But in the early 2000s, and even today, that meant one thing: to succeed in America at baseball all you needed was the biggest bank account. The Red Sox and Yankees, and to some extent the entire East Coast, had budgets that dwarfed other ball clubs.

It had gotten to the point that under that system teams like the Oakland A's became nothing but farm teams for teams with the bigger payrolls to cherry-pick from come free-agency. Billy Beane, who remains the GM for the A's, and his assistant Paul DePodesta fought against the system, and revolutionized the way baseball is scouted today.  Moneyball, based on the book of the same name, tells the story of this revolution and the men who bucked the system.

Billy Beane was a five-star draftee (23rd overall pick by the Mets in 1980) who didn't pan out for the organization. Despite millions of dollars a year invested in scouting, Beane's case was not uncommon. Players hyped as future Hall of Famers routinely underperform in the Big Show, if they make it at all. Furthermore the only explanation scouts can point to for valuing one recruit higher than another, other than batting average or total runs batted in, was ""instinct"". But after the Beane-DePodesta revolution, as Beane has put it: ""It's all about evaluating skills and putting a price on them. Thirty years ago, stockbrokers used to buy stock strictly by feel. Let's put it this way: Anyone in the game with a 401(k  a retirement savings account) has a choice. They can choose a fund manager who manages their retirement by gut instinct, or one who chooses by research and analysis. I know which way I'd choose.""

What really makes this movie exceptional isn't that unique take on baseball, the direction, or even the acting, although both Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill are brilliant in their respective roles, it is the writing. Moneyball, the movie and book, both shine in their juxtaposition of Beane's life with his career and his beloved A's and their revolution that forever altered baseball.

Brad Pitt plays Beane perfectly, from the public swagger of a former ball player to the despair and somberness in his private moments. Some of the most memorable scenes in this film are scenes that have nothing to do with baseball. And for anyone who has ever been around baseball knows, the moments in this movie that are laugh out loud hilarious are exactly how humor on the diamond has always been: random, a little weird, but perfect in the moment.

This movie's failings, and truly there aren't many, exist in its pacing. At times it feels like the movie is roaring along, trying to fit Mr. Lewis' entire book into but two hours, and at others we are crawling along like a major league club in early July. If you love baseball, you may not even notice (I didn't notice the pacing until a friend of mine, a strictly football guy, mentioned it after), but if not it can seem tedious at times.

The film itself could easily stand alone, but for any true blue baseball fan this movie is destined to become required viewing. For anyone interested in what those mad scientists in Oakland were doing in '03, or the system that almost every major league club has now embraced, this movie is for you.",1319500800,,3313,4.680412371134021
4902351,5,B005X5XIF6,"Yes! The producer uses a baseball setting to deliver a very strong message, but this is not a movie about baseball. The story takes place around the game of baseball, or rather around the business of baseball. This is a movie about business, the business of any type of organization: private enterprise, government institution or NGO. It's a movie (a real life story actually) about thinking outside the box. It is also about making a buck, but mostly about making a difference. A true life story showing how corporations, government institutions and social organizations should behave today to take our society out of dead center, out of the current crisis and into a new stage of wellbeing.
It takes strong convictions and commitment to search for the root causes of a problem --any problem-- and then it takes guts to address those root causes. There are risks involved; you may lose your job, you may be ostracized from your social group and, in some circumstances, you may even get killed. The movie beautifully illustrates how an individual can make a difference by thinking outside the box, listening to others and changing his/her own ways as new events take place and opportunities come about. I highly recommend this movie to anybody whose goal in life is to make a difference; along the way you may also make a few more bucks.",1319241600,,1337,4.817391304347826
4902352,5,B005X5XIF6,"Moneyball is not a conventional sports movie that ends with a team winning the big game.  It is a film that shows the highs and lows of the game of baseball.  Brad Pitt stars as Billy Beane.  He is the general manager of the Oakland Athletics.  His task is to rebuild the team after three star players leave in 2002.  A statistics expert. named Peter Brand. helps him do this.  He is played by Jonah Hill.  Both actors give the best performance of their careers in this film.  The relationship between these two main characters is the main syrength of the film.  They work as a team to build the best team possible.  The method of selecting players is clever.  They look for players who possess certain baseball skills that can help the A's  win.  These are players who are either over looked or passed their prime playing years.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman has a supporting role as the coach of the team.  He has some good moments here, but this movie centers around the relationship between Beane and Brand.  I don't understand much about baseball.  However, that did not prevent me from enjoying this film.  The music is entirely instrumental in this film.  There is one piece of music that is particularly excellent.  An instrumental band called This Will Destroy You perform a instrumental piece entitled ""The Mighty Rio Grande"" .  It has a steady uplifting drum beat  This piece  has a quiet intensity that I love.  The rest of the music is provided by Mychael Danna.  His score is superb.  Moneyball is one of the best films of 2011.",1318982400,,1537,4.6
4902353,5,B005X5XIF6,"""Moneyball,"" directed by Bennett Miller with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin and Steve Zaillian, is based on the Michael Lewis bestseller of the same name.  Brad Pitt stars as Billy Beane, a once promising young ballplayer who never made it in the big leagues.  Now he is the general manager of the Oakland A's, a team that is about to lose its best players.  With a budget that will not allow Beane to compete financially with more prosperous teams, Beane hires a twenty-five year old Yale graduate named Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), an economics major who has come up with a unique computer program.  According to Brand, Beane can make the A's competitive in spite of their minuscule payroll.

Some critics have said that you don't need to love or understand baseball to appreciate ""Moneyball.""  This is true only to the extent that anyone can appreciate fine acting.  Pitt is relaxed and understated; he expresses emotional pain and frustration with facial expressions as much as with he does with words.  He is a divorced dad who cherishes the limited time he spends with his daughter.  Although Beane is in his forties, he has enough self-confidence and chutzpah to tell his grizzled scouts (all wonderful veteran character actors) that he is the one calling the shots.  Hoffman plays the A's manager, Art Howe, with his usual expertise.  Howe has thinly veiled contempt for what he considers to be a hare-brained scheme, but is professional enough to do what he is told.  Jonah Hill is terrific as Brand, a young, overweight man with a constant look of terror on his face, as if he expects to be thrown out of the office at any moment.  Why does Beane put it all on the line in this outrageous manner?  He says, ""I hate losing more than I love winning,"" and for some reason, Brand's ideas resonate with him.

The script is an unsentimental and straightforward account of what happened in the 2002 season, when the A's won an unprecedented twenty games in a row.  ""Moneyball"" does not leave us with the notion that Brand's method is foolproof, since if it were, the A's would have continued their winning ways indefinitely.  Instead, this film is a character study of a courageous man who risked not only his position but also the derision of his more experienced colleagues by making a series of unconventional moves.  Beane and Brand had the temerity to suggest that although money is certainly needed to buy first-rate talent, it is sometimes possible to field a winning team without breaking the bank.",1318377600,,2504,4.770301624129931
4902354,3,B005X5XIF6,"For a person with just a passing interest in baseball, this very long film is unlikely to make much of an impression.  From that perspective,  I would characterize it as ""fairly interesting"" at best, with a few laugh-out-loud moments to break the monotony.  The ""daughter"" had some very good moments as did the old grizzled baseball scouts  And the chubby guy was also fun to watch.  If you're very much into baseball, this one will probably have more meaning for you, and should should not go by this review.  All others, take note.",1318204800,4,533,4.67741935483871
4902355,5,B005X5XIF6,"Michael Lewis's book, Moneyball, is a fascinating depiction of the insertion of statistics into baseball, melding the worlds of brains and brawn into a hard-to-stop whole. The film version does this  wonderful  book justice.

Brad Pitt stars as Billy Beane, a once-promising baseball star whose career never took off. In 2002, he is general managing the Oakland A's, but with a budget that is a fraction of that of other ball teams. With the help of an economics major, he starts to put into  practice the arcane science of sabermetrics, hoping to find hidden ball-playing gems that can be obtaining or a song.

The casting and storytelling were nearly perfect. Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane with a desperate charm. Jonah Hill plays the inexperienced Econ grad who applies numerical analysis to the game. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays irascible A's manager Art Howe, who wants to manage his players the old-fashioned way. I was pleased that the film gave a nod to the brains behind the statistics, Bill James, whose groundbreaking, obsessive and counterintuitive work laid the ground work for the scientific study of baseball.

This is not a feel-good baseball movies where a fractious bunch of losers becomes superstars and win the Big Game. There's more subtlety at play. Big Money, family ties, love of the game and a desire to right old wrongs interweave throughout the plot to make Moneyball more complex than a simple moral tale. A fine film that does justice to the book on which it is based.",1318118400,,1496,4.916666666666667
4902356,4,B005X5XIF6,"Let me be clear: I think ""Moneyball"" is a very good movie. The screenplay by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin is very finely wrought, filled with scintillating dialogue and, at the end, all sorts of bittersweet irony. Bennett Miller translates the screenplay expertly to the screen, and the acting is exactly right for the story. But I was led by the advance reviews to expect a transcendent masterpiece, very probably the greatest sports movie ever made, and that is not what I found.

The advance word on ""Moneyball"" was that it's the baseball movie for people who don't follow baseball. On the contrary, I believe it is a movie for people who are obsessed with baseball. With its relentless focus on baseball statistics, scouts, trading players, etc., ""Moneyball"" has an attraction mostly for fans fascinated by the mechanics of the game, though Miller, Zaillian and Sorkin do a good job of making the process interesting. There is surprisingly little action on the diamond, and much of it is filtered through the main characters watching the games on TV.

The statement by Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) toward the middle of the movie--that he doesn't get too close to the players because that would make it hard to trade or fire them--seems toward the end like an excuse for the fact that Brad Pitt is pretty much the entire movie. Except for Jonah Hill and Philip Seymour Hoffman--the latter with only about ten minutes of screen time--Pitt is the only actor who registers strongly (though the young actress who plays Pitt's daughter also makes a good impression). Pitt has never been more effortlessly charming, or so thoroughly at home in his own body; he will almost certainly be nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for this, and he will probably win. But I can't help remembering that, several years ago, Kurt Russell gave an even better performance in ""Miracle"" as Olympic hockey coach Herb Brooks. It was a very similar role to Billy Beane, and Russell wasn't nominated for anything. Russell succeeded in giving a truthful, three-dimensional portrait of Brooks; Pitt succeeded in making you like Brad Pitt. Pitt gives a great star performance here; in ""Miracle,"" Russell gave a great performance, period.

""Moneyball"" may be the best movie ever about the business of baseball, and it deserves credit for that. But ""Bull Durham"" and ""Field of Dreams"" remain the baseball movies that will entertain fans and non-fans alike.",1318118400,,2423,4.948402948402949
4902357,4,B005X5XIF6,"This is the story of Billy Beane, the Oakland A's GM who built his team based on statistics rather the traditional player evaluation process.  The film is not just a baseball movie but is a drama about a man who bucks the usual way of doing business in his chosen industry, and juggles his professional life with his personal life. He is close to his daughter, and the time and pressure of Major League Baseball make it difficult to find time for her. The presence of Brad Pitt elevates this project and he is very good as the man who takes a unique way of putting together a team. Knowing the final outcome does not damper the viewer's enthusiasm in following the progress of the ballclub.",1318032000,,690,4.476190476190476
4902358,5,B005X5XIF6,"A debatable short list of those who have really in a substantial way changed the face of baseball. With the help of Bill James, baseball statistician guru, Beane, general manager of the Oakland Athletics, devised a new way of breaking down thru statistics those  hidden gem baseball players missed by other teams. Also, Oakland, being one of the poorer teams in the major leagues, moved to jettison high priced under achievers. I'm not a real big fan of this type of ""new"" tech style which seems to among many other things, advocate waiting out pitchers for walks. This movie did not lessen my love of the game. It would take more space than this review to explain what has become known as ""Billy Ball"". The Boston Red Sox used it to win a World Series in 2004. As for the movie itself, I now like Brad Pitt as Billy at bit more. Jonah Hill has finally graduated to a grown-up role as Peter Brand, Billy's invaluable advisor. Billy, had to, given the economics of baseball operate on a shoestring budget. He was ridiculed by all the old advisors, scouts & even the manager. He stood his ground & the staff meetings with these old geezers are some of the best scenes in this movie. One of the better baseball movies in many years, maybe since ""Bull Durham"". Then of course, there is always Brad Pitt.",1317686400,,1299,4.527659574468085
4902359,5,B005X5XIF6,"I love baseball. Played 14 seasons growing up. Even helped win some championships. Batting was always my favorite. There's nothing more intense than standing there, staring down that pitcher, bat twisting between your palms, waiting for the ball to come whipping out of that hand at insane speeds. Watching the pitch come flying toward the plate is the only way I've ever experienced bullet time, and the satisfaction of tracking a curveball in perceived slow motion until it smacks into the sweet spot of your bat can't be matched. Fielding was good too. I mostly played pitcher, first, second, shortstop, third, left, right, and center. Plus, when my dad was the manager, every night he'd look over all of the team's stats with me and spend hours agonizing over how to arrange the team to create the perfect fun/success ratio.

What I'm saying is, I know a thing or two about baseball, so when I go to a movie on the subject, I expect a lot, and if they don't get it right, I'll tear into it with a passion.

They got it right.

But then again, it almost wasn't a baseball movie. Brad Pitt plays Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane at a time when the team's just lost its three star players. Faced with the difficulty of getting new hotshots on a bare bones budget, Beane turns to economy major Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). Brand convinces Beane that stars don't win games. Runs win games, and runs aren't scored with big hits and amazing plays in the field. They're scored by getting on base.

Beane takes this advice to heart and throws out all the conventional wisdom of baseball sages, willing to hire players who don't know anything about fielding as long as they can take pitches and end up with a walk. Most of the film is about people who think they know baseball not believing in this new system and Beane trying to stick with it in the face of early failure. Like I said, it's not a baseball movie.

But The Social Network was a movie about computer programming, and if they can make that exciting, I guess they can do it with anything. Brad Pitt helps with a great performance as the conflicted manager, and Jonah Hill is surprisingly good. The success of the film rests squarely on their shoulders, and while shots of endless statistics scrolling across a computer screen are a little cheesy, they're not that bad. As the film builds up the hopelessness of being such a monetarily poor team, you can't help but root for them. Right from the beginning, you'll be emotionally hooked, and it won't let up until the very end.

The movie gets around this by making the climax not about a championship, but about the potential for a record-breaking winning streak, and man is it exciting.

Another key difference is that, for something advertised as a pure sports drama, it's surprisingly funny. I think I laughed harder at this than at The Hangover 2. In fact, I think it's the funniest movie I've been to this year.

4902362,5,B005X5XIF6,"Every once in awhile, there is a great sports movie that comes out that appeals to fans of the sport and non-fans alike.  I've never been a great baseball fan, but I was dragged to this movie with low expectations.  When I left, I realized just how blown away I was.  The cast displays great chemistry and the performances are excellent all around, with only a few missteps exhibited by the script.  Jonah Hill's performance here is probably the best of his career, augmented by Brad Pitt's stellar portrayal of Billy Beane.

Moneyball follows a true story of a horrible MLB team and the general manager who reinvents his team from scratch.  Putting together a ragtag assortment of players and personnel, Beane has to deal with challenges from those around him and observers who call his methods and his goals wrong and against what baseball is about.  It's a touching story complete with laughs and moments where you are rooting for the A's, fan or not.

The movie is like a love story to baseball and the things that make the sport so great.  Pitt's performance should hopefully score him a nomination in the Oscar races, pulling so much from his bag of tricks to give a winning performance.  Jonah Hill should be proud of himself for what he proved to the world in this movie, that he isn't just about juvenile jokes and high school humor - even if some does factor into Moneyball.  Some.  The writing and direction are superb.  I was a big fan of The Social Network and was immediately pulled in by the story in Moneyball.  Beane's story and the story of those around him is harrowing and pulling, and they did an excellent job of conveying how important heart and soul are in a world of tradition and rules.

If I have to nitpick one thing about the movie, it would be the length.  Cutting a few minutes off this 2+ hour film would have served to tighten it up, but I am not really complaining.  To convince a non-baseball fan like me that this was an excellent movie is hard, but Moneyball did this and then some.  This movie is definitely a must see.",1317340800,5,2057,4.498652291105121
4902363,5,B005X5XIF6,"I enjoyed this film thouroughly. The performances, especially by Pitt and Hill are perfect and the supporting players all fit in and support the world that has been created (or recreated to an extent as the case may be). The music was perfectly done and the directing felt very real and intimate, the film's execution kind of reminded me of Friday Night Lights (both the film and the first season of the series). It feels like a documentary that goes more in depth and shows personal moments that could not otherwise be obtained. The story is compelling, even moreso in that it is based on the known true story of the Oakland A's, and Pitt's character is likeable but a real person who seems tough enough to have made it as a GM in such a hard hitting business. Watching Pitt as Billy Beane execute player trades is simply pure cinematic entertainment at its best.

I must admit that this film isn't entirely what I expected. The previews had me thinking that the explanation of the statistics would be more fast paced and energetic (though it never drags it does take its time) and that a large portion of the film would be spent with the team and on the field. While we do get glimpses of the team (usually off field) the majority of the movie tells a sports story from a different angle, it was at first off putting as I didn't expect it but then it became compelling and even refreshing.

This film isn't focused on the field, other than when the field plays a part in Beane's story. This isn't a film about the Oakland A's, it is a film about Billy Beane and the experience of a General Manager trying to get by with low funds. So we find many games are seen on television screens or only in short glimpses.

I did miss the usual sports movie theme of following some of the players, the first half of the film set up several key players in more personal scenes but then their stories were never explored in any more depth and they are blended into the team as a whole. The coach, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, is the only character other than Billy who is really given a large personal development. He struggles with what Billy is doing and understandably has a hard time playing along when not only his job but his career could be on the line.

I was also, having not read the book, unaware that Billy Beane was divorced. Obviously this is true to life and so there can't be any arguments about it. It is refreshing in fact to see a different dynamic being played out as we see Beane having shared custody of his daughter. The reason I mention this is because my preconception was that this would be a film about a man and his family, I expected the usual scenes of him being reassured by his wife and kids and so on. We do get that but in a very real and nonromanticized way. Once again, different from the norm but executed so well that it is refreshing.

The entire film has a gritty and real feel to it, while there are some moments where it romanticizes the sport and situation of Beane, the rest feels very honest and to the point. We spend a great amount of time in the film with Beane, this is truly his story, and his life is not shown as picture perfect. These are the struggles we have yet to see in the glory shown here, this is the story of a general manager who is struggling to hit a home run.

This is a great film for anyone, not just baseball fans, it isn't a film about baseball as much as it is a film that explores what goes on behind the scenes and off the field. Let's hope this film will garner a return to sports themed movies, there have been so many comic book movies as of late I for one could use something different.",1317168000,2,3656,4.298984034833091
