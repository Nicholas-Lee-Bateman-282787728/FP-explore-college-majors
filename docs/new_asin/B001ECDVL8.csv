8297631,5,B001ECDVL8,"Having visited Jerusalem and Herodium in the last year, I found this video so interesting.  Herod the Great earned his name from his building projects and city planning abilities.  I wish this had included his fantastic city of Caesarea as well.",1499558400,,245,4.951219512195122
8297632,4,B001ECDVL8,Not as informative as I had hoped. Interesting but not much meat.,1429747200,,65,4.5

8297634,3,B001ECDVL8,"A well produced secular documentary on a selection of Herod's architectural wonders: Herodium, Masada, Caesarea Maritima and the Temple expansion. Investigation of Herod's tomb is secondary to his own history and works (which is to the production's advantage).

The viewer should keep in mind Herod was a murderous beast  killing his own wife and sons, also ordering the infanticide of Bethlehem to eliminate the child Jesus. This slaughter fulfilled the prophecy in Jeremiah 31.15 made over 600 years earlier.

My version included an equally good [50 min] bonus feature of Jerusalem's three main religious sites: Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and the Wailing Wall. The producers have tried hard to equalise what are three entirely different faiths. For a Bible-believer false premises are evident:

*The purported rock of Mt. Moriah under the Dome is not a 'gateway' to God (Christ is the only doorway).

*The Qur'an contains fatal contradictions and absurdities: Abraham took Ishmael for sacrifice rather than Isaac. Son of the Egyptian bondwoman Hagar, Ishmael had already been cast out; Muhammed (on a small winged creature) made an overnight return trip to Jerusalem from Mecca (1,200km away). He then ascended to heaven from the site of Herod's Temple (it had been demolished for 550 years).

*Christianity is conflated with Catholicism, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is referred to as the holiest shrine in Christendom (replete with a holy rock for people to touch). Christians do not believe in shrines, or that any piece of land is intrinsically 'holier' or closer to God than any other on the earth's surface.",1404604800,2,1661,5.225563909774436
8297635,3,B001ECDVL8,We're told that Herod was an architectural genius but paranoid ruthless ruler but given too few details of either.  Focuses more on archeologists and digs than Herod.  The backstory needed an extra hour.,1336694400,,203,5.121212121212121
8297636,5,B001ECDVL8,I had visited three of the four locations in this program and I found the background information provided here filled in some insight into these places.  Herod's Lost Tomb not only touches on the tomb itself but also on the architecture that Herod brought to this region of the world.  It is truly unbelievable that these great achievements could be built in the time shortly before Christ's birth.  This program was worth my time.,1311206400,,431,4.797297297297297
8297637,5,B001ECDVL8,"King Herod had impacted Judea just before Jesus Christ was said to have walked the earth.  His buildings and great works are still evident in much of modern day Palestine/Israel.  This video is an excellent documentary detailing much of the work that Herod did, from the Temple Mount to Masada, from Cesearea to Herodium we get a glimpse of his great works, a review of his life and most likely scenario of the location of his Tomb.

Rich with history, we see a quick view of why Herodium was eventually built, the Parthians, not well known in a Roman dominated world, took over Judea and Herod fled.  He vowed he would be buried at Herodium.  National Geographic does an incredible job of showing us how he did some of his great works.  I was fascinated by the research done to find out how Cesearea (on the sea) and its great sea port was first built and then how it was eventually destroyed. (You have to get the video, I will not give it away.)

I think this is recommended for anyone who has visited the Middle East, anyone studying ancient architecture, any schools with Middle Eastern or Religious history or archeology classes.  Having visited to three of the locations that he built, I was astounded by the graphics that they use in the video, wish there were more, actually.  And I think the conclusion that they come up with is accurate as well.",1265328000,3,1356,4.5473251028806585
