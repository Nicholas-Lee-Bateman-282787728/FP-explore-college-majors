1228827,5,B00000IPG4,"Bernie Laplante (Dustin Hoffman) is not necessarily the kind of man to be nominated 'Role Model of the Year'. He's divorced, a liar, a cheat, a thief, and headed for jail. On the way to pick his son to the movies, he is the lone witness of a plane crash and very unwillingly saves the lives of all those on the plane after a boy begs him to save his father. He leaves the scene complaining at the loss of his shoe and his car which is now a wreck. Driven home by a homeless guy named John Bubber (Andy Garcia), Bernie gives his one remaining shoe to the guy, saying he'll never stick his neck out for anybody again. Gale Gayley (Geena Davis), a tv news reporter who was saved from the crash, is bent on finding the mysterious man who saved everyone on the plane. The media builds the mystery man up, calling him 'the Angel of Flight 104'. Gale's tv station offers a $1 million reward and much to Bernie's consternation, the homeless guy he had spoken to claims to be the 'hero'! Since no one got a good look of the 'hero' and John has the other shoe which matches the one left at the wreckage, who's to claim otherwise? And anyway, who would believe Bernie to be the hero-type?

A very satirical story, ""Hero"" is not necessarily about 'real heroes'. Instead, I could say that this film should have been named ""The Ideal Hero"" (nods to the Oscar Wilde play, ""An Ideal Husband""). Both take the idea of the 'ideal', in this case the ideal hero: just how ideal is ideal? Is ideal just what we see on the surface? Because the surface can be deceiving... This film cleverly gives a very insightful look on how deceiving it is about what we 'want' to see and what the 'reality' is.

Dustin Hoffman is such an incredibly 'unlikable' fellow that we can't help but start to 'like' him, thus created more of an irony to the story. As the story progresses, you can't help but start sympathizing with him, at the same time just wanting to hit him over the head and tell him what to do to make things right! Geena Davis also gives a solid performance and she handles her role of the tv reporter with a hidden, soft heart professionally. Andy Garcia's character may seem 'too good to be true', but in fact I think that's what the whole point was. Is too good to be true real?

All in all, a delightfully ironic story with a subtle message. Rated PG-13 for strong language which is quite unfortunate since it may have been better received if the language had been toned down a bit. Highly recommended for older teens and adults.",1123632000,16,2512,4.363247863247863

1228829,4,B00000IPG4,"At first I wasn't sure if I was going to like it.

The whole concept of this film seemed a little

too unbelievable, and far-fetched.

But, by the end...I was enjoying it!

""Hero"" makes a few interesting points,

that we as the public- never think about

when it comes to the media.

- Are we ALWAYS watching the hero

or someone who just took the credit?

-Does the media focus too much on

certain icons while others are left behind?

-Aren't we all heros in some way?

Surprisingly, this was an enjoyable movie.

Some laughs, some tears & some good points!

An over-looked Hoffman flick..

1228830,5,B00000IPG4,"HERO is a film that wants to have it both ways, and succeeds in doing so.  What is heroism is perhaps shaded with sentimentality and mush, but even when it's spoken by Andy Garcia and Dustin Hoffman, it makes this movie work.

Hoffman plays Bernie Laplante, a down on his luck, selfish, and deceitful father and crook.  One night while on his way to take his 9 or 10 year old (Hoffman's never sure) to a movie, he witnesses a tragic plane crash, and in spite of his reluctance to help, he ends up rescuring everyone from the plane.  Since he is in trouble with the law, he doesn't come forth to accept any credit.  He tells his story and gives his one remaining shoe to a homeless man played with grace and sincerity by Andy Garcia.  Garcia comes forward to claim the honor of the hero, and the media makes him into a saintly miracle worker, and everyone loves John Bubber.  Hoffman ends up in jail and can't convince anyone that he is the real hero.  Smack dab in the middle of all this is Geena Davis as the news reporter who Hoffman saved on the plane, and she's falling madly in love with Garcia.

The movie's resolution comes while Garcia and Hoffman are perched on the ledge of a skyscraper, and this is where the movie serves both sides:  Garcia is a liar and deceitful, yet he has done so much good with his heroic aura that the audience doesn't really want to see him pay for his deceit; meanwhile Hoffman has been such a sleazeball for most of the movie, that you don't really want him to usurp Garcia, but at the same time, Hoffman's turn of heart makes you want to see him be recognized, especially for his ex-wife and son's benefit.  How it works out is a little forced, but it satisfies both sides.

Hoffman is brilliant in this role, bringing a touch of humanity to an otherwise scumbag role; Davis does a good job as Gale, her best performance in some time; Garcia is great as John Bubber, a man caught in his lie, but afraid to come forward; Chevy Chase has an uncredited turn as the news station's director, and Joan Cusack as always lends solid support in the role of Hoffman's ex-wife.

HERO isn't one of the greatest films, but it is pleasantly told and skillfully directed and acted.  One could do worse for a couple hours entertainment.",1091318400,12,2259,4.399038461538462

1228960,4,B00000IPG4,"This was an enjoyable feel good movie.  A decent film worth a look.  The main characters all did a good job. (and I am not a Hoffman fan, he will forever be Ratso in my mind.  I made the mistake of seeing his terrible attempt at a Inspector Clouseau roll right after Midnight Cowboy and have never been able to get it out of my head)  Hoffman did a fine Ratso job in this one as a low life thief who steps out of character to help survivors of a plane crash, complaining all the way.  When a homeless vet with a pure heart steps up to take the credit, the world welcomes him and poor Bernie, who is waiting sentencing in court to go to prison, can't get anyone to believe it was him.  Of course it has a Hollywood ending, it was made to be entertaining and it does the job.  Good performances by Geena Davis and Andy Garcia help make it a good movie.",1416787200,,850,4.053892215568863

1228963,5,B00000IPG4,"Dustin Hoffman does it again. An anti-hero hero.  He doesn't want to do it, he doesn't want attention, he just wants to fly under the radar at all times. This story takes many turns, and unlikely events ensue.  Geena Davis is good as an ambitious, driven reporter.  If I told you more, I would give too much away. Andy Garcia is fabulous in his part; the changes in his personna and attitude develop naturally.  Definitely worth seeing.",1405814400,,436,4.623376623376624
1228964,5,B00000IPG4,"This movie defines masterful cinema for me -  sweeping cinematography with dramatic shots, outstanding directing and editing, and a skillful cast of actors with lots of electrifying chemistry between them - just thought this movie deserved Oscar recognition because it is Hollywood at its very best - a perfect ratio of pathos, comedy, drama, and story-telling about misguided hero worship in contemporary society - a scruffy, fun tale that entertains from start to finish.  Not a single dull moment - and how often can you say that about any movie?",1405036800,,549,5.088888888888889

1228967,4,B00000IPG4,Dustin Hoffman is a understated person which fit in to this film perfectly. One third of comedy should be understated. It has more punch that way. Warning  you should not look away or you will miss the connections.,1396396800,,214,4.631578947368421

He's not happy about it but feels obligated to do something and helps everyone abort the plane. After helping, he continues on his way to see his son without taking credit for the heroism.

1228969,4,B00000IPG4,"I've always liked this movie. It's probably a bit corny for some and can come across as heavy-handed in its depiction of our hero-worshiping culture, but the acting is excellent and the story rings true. Dustin Hoffman does what he always does -- opens up a kind of shifty schmuck to let us see a decent, even good, core person. Geena Davis is excellent as the hard-bitten softie newscaster. I could believe Andy Garcia as the down-on-his luck philosophical type, caught up in something he never envisioned. And Chevy Chase (uncredited) is Chevy Chase -- snarky, over-the-top, and fun to watch. Not the greatest ever, but a treat to watch.",1391299200,,639,4.818181818181818

1228997,5,B00000IPG4,"This movie raises the question of who should be considered a hero, and how do we judge that person. Dustin Hoffman does his usual fine job of acting, playing the part of a rather shady and unlikeable character who makes a mistake and does something out of character. This results in a string of circumstances that ultimately involves several other individuals. Alls well that ends well, but it is the getting there that makes this movie so interesting.",1377129600,,452,4.8076923076923075

1228999,5,B00000IPG4,"This is a brilliant parody. I find it remarkable that so many people in Amazon reviews loved the goody-two-shoes sentiment in the film, because this clever movie from beginning to end is about the onion the reporter talks about in her speech--no story--no core--all, as Bernie says in the end and the news people say throughout, are layers of [a word from the movie, which Amazon will not let me publish because they are protecting the public from language that is universally used in the media, and probably by most of the priests and ministers in Chicago, and certainly in kindergartens everywhere]. Anyway, the film says, Choose one and that's your reality. There you get your perception of a hero. It is about perception, and the shaping of all of our realities. This is not in any way a cynical film, though God knows it has its cutting edges. It really is heartwarming, once you accept the premise. But it's farce, folks. It's a fairy tale. It is well acted--Hoffman as Ratso Rizzo II is superb--Geena Davis maybe a little overdone--Andy Garcia great. And it's a modern fairy tale. The little touches throughout, like the cameraman monologuing his takes, are terrific. It's not a knee slapper, but it delights the mind--lots of food for thought.",1374796800,,1251,4.823255813953488

1229023,4,B00000IPG4,"There's an old song which goes 'T'ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it'. This movie sets out to prove that, in the words of another song, it ain't necessarily so. Almost everything is wrong with the way Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) goes about his life. He becomes a hero, reluctantly and for mostly bad reasons, although far below the surface a tiny glint of altruism might be spotted. He hands off his actions to another person, but finds, much to his disgust, that the consequences of his good deed are hard to escape.

Dustin Hoffman plays this kind of character better than any other actor and his performance here is brilliant. In fact, he's almost too good, because he makes the character so downbeat and insignificant that it's easy to dismiss him. It's only after watching the movie a couple of times that the skill with which he creates the part becomes evident. Perhaps that is why this movie is not given the credit it deserves.

The supporting cast is solid and the script has flashes of understated humor. It's not the most original idea, but it's excellently realised. The real joy of this movie, however, is Hoffman's performance. Oscars have been awarded for less.",1340409600,,1185,4.6923076923076925

The movie itself takes its own cynical look at ""the media"", and how they can inflate a story - even if it isn't accurate.
Wikipedia says this movie's budget was $42 million, but it only pulled in $66.5 million at the box office.  That's too bad - it deserved a lot more success.  IMO.",1315526400,,466,4.458823529411765

1229027,5,B00000IPG4,"If you want to smile, laugh and forget about your problems for a while then HERO might just do the trick.

The cast is good and Hoffman exceptional in a throwback to the 1930's style film.  Hoffman does a wonderful job as Bernie LaPlant, a down on his luck, petty thief who incorrigibly uses people and is a reluctant hero who rescues an award-winning reporter, Geena Davis, and others from a burning, crashed airliner.

Bernie has been convicted of selling stolen goods and is trying to re-establish a relationship with his estranged son to make points with the sentencing judge.  The rescue caused him to be late and his ex-wife (Joan Cusack) refuses to let him see the boy and he lost an 'expensive' shoe to boot.

He gives the remaing shoe to homeless John Bubber (Andy Garcia) and has no interest in the public demand to know the identity of the mystery man who saved these people until a million dollar reward is offered by Davis' newspaper.  The other shoe was found at the crash site and the reward will be given to the person that has the matching shoe (now Garcia).

Hoffman never loses sight of what Bernie is as the plot winds through improbable but laugh inducing scenes.  It's worth the watch.",1293840000,,1207,4.5813953488372094
1229028,2,B00000IPG4,"If the Producer/Director/Writer had in mind a light tribute to Frank Capra, then I'll go for ***. Even with that, the opening scenes involving a televised suicide [was the writer referencing the movie ""Network"" here?] and its' cold-hearted coverage by an over-acheiving news station, are so pitifully poor, one wonders, initially, if they are really a dream sequence.

Dustin Hoffman has a Longfellow Deeds/Ratso Rizzo thing going...and any American movie fan can see where it's going - that feel-good, Hollywood finale!

Andy Garcia and Geena Davis act well, considering the juvenile dialogue they must deliver; Hoffman collects a check. Chevy Chase is not the Chevy Chase of the vacation and Fletch movies - he plays Davis' boss at the TV Station as if he's in just another forgettable sketch on SNL.

Chase has the ability to read lips but he does not engage this gift while the world watches Hoffman and Cage chat out on a ledge near the end of the picture.

The real standouts here are the performances from our principal actors: Dustin Hoffman, Geena Davis, and Andy Garcia. All three give wonderful performances as distinctive people who are connected to the troubles of the media and society's view of what makes a hero a real hero.

1229033,5,B00000IPG4,"Hero with Dustin Hoffman,is an excellent and highly entertaining film.
It is sad that I had to search high and low to find this film, as it is no longer at Blockbuster type stores to rent or available to purchase in Chain retailers, so I am thankful that Amazon had it available for me to purchase.
This movie's main characters are all very unlikely heros but turn out to be way more then we the viewer could ever imagine them to be. A plane crash sets a chain of events into motion that create the opportunity to teach many lessons in this film, some obvious and some very subtle, but all meaningful.
The outcome of the movie is not what I expected, it was bigger and better then I could have hoped for!
I feel like anyone who watches this Film, no matter what age, race , or gender will find something valuable (about themselves) buried in this Movie. Hopefully, this Film will help some of us to realize that there is a HERO in every one of us,  just waiting to come out!",1227139200,2,974,4.293478260869565
1229034,5,B00000IPG4,"The first time I have seen this film was over ten years ago, and recently it been nagging me out of nowhere. I have spent quite some time in getting this film on DVD, which is not available in an open market. Then, yesterday, I finally got a chance to see it once more.

Once again, it did not disappoint me as I really enjoyed watching this movie. It is both humorous and full of good drama. And, I enjoyed the acting on Dustin Hoffman's part as he was delirious, especially his use of ""pardon the vulgarity"" throughout the movie.

Also from this movie is an insight about the ""hero"" to which is the famous line as said by John Bubber (played by Andy Garcia): ""We're all heroes if you catch us at the right moment."" That is true when a certain situation calls for that aspect of ourselves to save others or be of great help to others.

Bernie LaPlante (played by Dustin Hoffman) is a man of low character and a thief and a liar, and when a certain moment came, he took a role of the hero. However, afterwards he did not stick around to claim his reward. Then, John Bubber became a new thief by claiming to be the hero while LaPlante spent time in jail.

I will not go further to spoil it except to say that it's very interesting twists and turns, and fun to watch.",1208908800,3,1265,4.214876033057851

Never heard of it when it came out and saw it for the first time about a year ago and knew it was a classic that would be watched over and over again in our house. Acting is over the top great.

is one of the best films of his entire career.  He was so down-to-earth

in his portrayal throughout the film.  He made you feel like ""one of the

1229039,5,B00000IPG4,"You would be surprised. There are moments of heroism in all of us. Being a hero does not necessarily mean putting your life in jeopardy for one fleeting moment. Sometimes the way we have conducted our lives and the good intentions in our hearts which we are not given the opportunity to bring to fruition can define a heroic person. Being put in the spotlight can misguide our better judgment and intentions. This film examines the complex notion of what heroism means in a rather unorthodox, humorous and ultimately touching story. This film has been so misunderstood but truly deserves some recognition of its insightful notions on being a genuinely well intentioned and often misunderstood person who just wants a little bit of understanding and just a little bit of recognition from being so misunderstood.

So you can see there is a lot of misunderstanding out there. We as individuals are pigeonholed and filed away in some memory bank never given the opportunity to reveal our true selves and never given the opportunity to rise to the occasion.  This film runs the gamut of emotions following the lowly down and out Dustin Hoffman and Andy Garcia each possessing individualistic heroic qualities in their own right but each having to face totally unpredictable twists of fate when being placed into the limelight justified or not. The results are mesmerizing.",1173052800,2,1367,4.991228070175438
1229040,5,B00000IPG4,"I suspect that few people have actually seen the movie, Hero, which stars Dustin Hoffman, Geena Davis and Andy Garcia.  This remarkable satirical comedy/drama came out in 1992.  I remember going to a multi-plex theater on a Saturday afternoon to see one movie, then sneaking in to see Hero afterwards.  Don't tell anybody!  I didn't know what to expect from this movie, nor did I care.  I was simply bored, and I wasn't ready to catch the bus back to my apartment.  By the time the film was over, I found myself sitting in the darkness of the theater with tears in my eyes because I'd just seen something very special that had caught me totally off guard.  This is perhaps when we have our greatest insights.  Let me just also add this for the record so that there's no confusion.  Though I found the movie to be extremely funny, all the actors play their roles straight and the humor evolves from their performances in a given situation.  So, even from a comedy, great insights can be had.

Bernie LaPlante (played by Dustin Hoffman) is having the worse week of his life.  He's lost his job, he's about to be sentenced to prison for dealing in stolen goods, his old beat-up car is on its last leg, and his ex-wife doesn't really want him seeing their ten-year-old son.  Things couldn't get any worse for him, could they?  Well, on his way over to pick up his son for a movie get together, a jet airliner crashes right in front of him.  The passengers in the burning plane are trapped because the door won't open, and they call to Bernie for help.  Making his way down an embankment of dirt, Bernie takes off his new shoes and then walks through a stream of water to get to the airplane.  He manages to get the door open, but is knocked down into the water and then trampled upon as fifty passengers rush to get out.  A little boy from the plane sees Bernie and begs him to get his unconscious father out of the plane before it explodes.  Now, Bernie isn't the type of person who would usually stick his neck out to save a stranger, but the little boy reminds him of his own son and he can't say no.  Against his better judgment, he enters the plane and ends up literally pulling out three more people who'd been left behind.  One of the people happens to be Gale Gayley (played by Geena Davis), who's a cynical television reporter for Channel 4 News.  Gale is at a point in her career where she now longs for a story that truly inspires and brings out the nobler side of man.  This will turn out to be just such a story.  Of course, while saving Gale, Bernie also steals her purse because he's just about out of money.  After the plane explodes, he quickly leaves the crash site with only one shoe (he couldn't find the other one) and a car that will barely run.  Because he's over three hours late to pick up his son, Bernie's ex-wife basically tells him to take a hike, refusing to listen to his excuses.  Then, while hitchhiking home, Bernie's picked up by John Bubber (played by Andy Garcia), a gentle homeless man who lives in his car and recycles cans for a living.  Bernie tells Bubber about the plane crash and then gives him his shoe as payment for the ride.  The next day Bernie's arrested for trying to sell Gale Gayley's credit cards to some uncover cops.  While this is happening, Gale and her TV station are trying to figure out who saved all the passengers on the airplane.  A million-dollar reward is offered to get the mysterious hero to come forth.  Not really expecting anything but maybe a free meal, John Bubber claims to be the hero.  He also has the shoe that matches the other one that was found at the crash site.  This is the inspiring story that Gale wanted, but she also finds herself falling in love with the handsome, soft-spoken Bubber.  Will the truth of who actually saved the passengers on the plane eventually come out?  What happens when Bernie is finally able to confront Bubber about the deception?  How will Gale react?  Ah, you have to see the film to find out.

It's the end of the movie, however, that really made it for me.  There's a scene when John Bubber is asked by Gale during a media interview, ""What does it mean to you to be a hero?""  John explains that ""everybody has something noble inside of them waiting to get out.  If you catch them at the right time, you'll see this to be true.  At other times, people are less noble and heroic.  When the media spotlights one individual over another as a hero, they're simply showing the goodness that's in all of us.  In other words, we're all heroes if you catch us at the right moment.""  I suppose this is popcorn psychology, but it touched something deep inside of me.  It made me realize that humanity is capable of such horrific things; yet, it's also capable of such unbelievable beauty and goodness.  That little speech helped to renew my faith in our planet.

Along with that, Hero also gives you a satirical look at the news and television reporting.  You can't always believe what you see on the news, not if you're smart.  The acting is excellent with stellar performances by not only the main cast, but also by Chevy Chase, Tom Arnold, Joan & Susie Cusack, Stephen Tobolowsky, and Kevin J. O'Connor, who played Benny in The Mummy.  This is a movie that will not only have you laughing out loud, but will also have you thinking and perhaps seeing the goodness that humanity is capable of when caught at the right moment.  As far as extras go, the DVD only has the basics.  No featurettes or commentary.  Still, this is definitely a movie that's worth owning.",1171065600,5,5564,4.433925049309665
1229041,5,B00000IPG4,"Gotta love poor old Bernie LaPlante..

Funny movie! I love Dustin Hoffman in this role. He is a lying scheming horrible father, low-life, con, that nothing goes right for. But, he's funny and loveable as heck. his views on life, that he wants to teach his son, are a hoot. he is grumpy and self-serving and when the opportunity to be a hero drops in his lap, he begrudgingly helps out, only to see what he can steal in the process.

I love Gena Davis in this movie. she is a star, with grace, beauty, and is just lovely. Andy Garcia is a dreamy cute, soft-spoken bum, that becomes the hero - he's so much better at public relations than poor anti-social Bernie.

The mom and the kid are great, and the judge saying, ""in anticipation of incarceration."" (you'll know what I mean when you see it!) I can not chop an onion with out thinking of Genna's speech at the media conference.

I keep this DVD on my shelf, and a few VHS copies too, to loan out to friends. As we speak, my Post Office has my video, I loaned to Bob, and he is passing it around. Stinkin funny movie. On my top 10 list.

5 stars, and more. Buy it, see it, love it. You'll root for Bernie like I do. thanks, SS",1148774400,4,1177,4.167400881057269
1229042,5,B00000IPG4,"Hero is terrific!!

It's mostly about our ratings- driven news media, which exploits whatever story ... they create some heroes, and they cut down other heroes...

It's about our shallow expectations. Handsome Garcia makes a ""better"" Hero to hype than foul mouthed and average Hoffman.

It's also uplifting... telling us that there is a ""hero"" inside each one of us.

While I disagree with the conclusion that ""everything is bull- s***, you just choose what bull-sh** is yours,"" (Otherwise known as cynicism... exemplified by the likes of George Carlin), this movie will make you laugh and think.

Even Bernie, in the movie, makes a remark about how the public doesn't want someone who looks or acts like him.  He would not be accepted as the ""hero.'  Do we want our heroes to have Marvel comic book characteristics?  How many times have you heard the statement during a presidential campaign ""does he or she 'look' presidential?'  Do you think the media would cover a story about a hero who is a shorty, nasty tempered jerk?
