8484247,5,B005RF12VO,This DVD is a 2-disk collectors edition.  The DVD quality is first rate.  Jean never looked better.  The second disk contains an extended set of deleted scenes that would have made this rate a very 'Hard-R' if included in the movie itself.  If you are a Jean Rollin fan you cannot do better than this.,1390089600,,301,4.418181818181818
