The first time I did it, I thought it was lame and hippie, but as my pregnancy progressed: during my 1st trimester, it was the one I picked because my body was tired all the time, so I still got my body moving, but didn't exhaust it further. 2nd trimester I did this when I wanted to take it easy (I had harder, more hard core prenatal videos for an actual workout). 3rd trimester this was the only one I could do. My baby's head was too big for my hips, so I had to get an unplanned C-section, but before I knew that, all I knew was that my hips were absolutely KILLING me, and I was huge, and didn't want to move much, but this video kept me moving, and stretching, and opened up my hips, and helped with shoulder and back pain, and it was quite the workout when I was that big with child. It was the video I wanted to do postpartum, but I lost it! (I took it to the hospital and did yoga during my 20 hour labor before my C-section). I'm gonna buy a new one if I don't find it soon. Thank you so much Katrina Waters Ray for making the video that got me through almost 10 months of pregnancy.",1454976000,,1127,4.013333333333334
8642025,5,B00IGL975Y,"Wow! I used the Yoga for Mommies for the first time at 14 weeks and it was great! I didn't even realize how tight my muscles had gotten until I got into the first stretch. It felt so good to get loose. I am pretty new to yoga and this was a great way to ease into it while being pregnant. Katrinas voice is very soothing and comforting. The pace at which she moves through the poses is nice. I could feel my muscle tension easing up. The whole session is long enough to get into it, but not so long that you need to take a pee break. ;)

I had been really trying to feel the connection with my baby, and anytime she would have me bring my hands to the 3rd eye and focus energy on the baby, I would immediately feel a wave of emotion come over me and could feel the connection.  Also, I love the affirmation at the end, it is beautiful.  I am really looking forward to doing the yoga series through out my pregnancy and delivering my child naturally, like Katrina.",1400025600,,963,4.084656084656085
8642026,5,B00IGL975Y,"Beautiful, restful and freeing yoga - really helped with centering myself again in the midst of a balancing a toddler and being heavily pregnant, and in finding a lot more space to move and breathe. love that it is only about 30 minutes required to complete but feels like it tackles all the major niggles I was feeling. Thanks Katrina!",1399939200,,336,4.616666666666666
8642027,5,B00IGL975Y,"Being a hot yoga lover and being unable to keep up my hot yoga practice during my pregnancy, I was looking for a video that would allow me to still practice yoga safely. I was excited to see some of the same poses that I used in my practice referenced in this video. I suffer from neck and back pain and after doing this video I felt more flexibility in my lower back and neck pain was gone. More importantly, I felt a calmness and connection with my growing baby. Katrina has a very soothing voice and loved the selection of music in the background, very relaxing. I would recommend this video to any woman interested in doing yoga during their pregnancy or anyone looking for a way to relax and release stress.",1396137600,,712,4.360902255639098
8642028,5,B00IGL975Y,"I used this video for my second and third pregnancies.  It helped me with flexibility, proper breathing and even my sleep improved!  The moves are not too advanced, so it's great for first time yoga people, but if you are a pro, it won't bore you.  Katrina knows her stuff!",1392422400,3,273,4.42
