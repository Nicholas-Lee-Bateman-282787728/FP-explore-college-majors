7874579,3,6304572778,"This anime was very peculiar. Its kinda like Panzer Dragoon, except no annoying CG to bother you. I noticed that there is an empire of cats in this one who in my opinion are kinda like Nazis (thats only because of the way the leader raised his hand, other than that, they're ok). The story follows along a high school boy who fell into a mysterious world full of creatures. Zolba, one of the many creature of the land, is going to attack earth soon and it is up to the boy to stop him. In order to do so, he must gain the love of a Yappie (female/dragon). The movie is very funny at times and has ok action. The music was very nice and that theme song is just stuck in my head. Granted, it might not be everyones cup of tea, but try renting it and see if this is the kinda anime you like.",979948800,,788,3.9936708860759493
