5458834,4,B00A6EZEOM,Just a great series that I enjoy watching every 18 months or so....never grows old and once it starts no matter which movie series...you become instantly drawn in. Just a great addition to any movie library.,1389398400,2,207,4.777777777777778
5458835,3,B00A6EZEOM,"You get the complete Bourne collection in this UK box set. It includes Bourne Identity, Bourne Supremacy, Bourne Ultimatum, and Bourne Legacy. US purchasers should know the UltraViolet codes do not work outside the UK. That's a big minus because you can't access the digital copies or the 2.5 hours of non-disc special features provided by Universal that are available in the US Blu-ray releases of these films (there is still 3 hours of bonus content on the discs themselves that are accessible). I would rate the films 4 stars and this release only 3 stars because it's not a deluxe collection since it only bundles the 4 stand-alone Blu-rays together in one package. Fans who own The Bourne Trilogy may opt to purchase Bourne Legacy separately (yet it remains the weakest of the franchise films). If you can buy this box set at a good price it does work well as a value pack. Ensure you get the region-free release since there is an identical Region 2/B release that does not work on US Blu-ray players.

5458838,3,B00A6EZEOM,all movies in one box. would given a 5 star since its in blu-ray but bourne identity disc was half way and no sound. i think the disc audio went bad or it was a manufacture bad. all of the other disc was very good so was the movie,1387843200,,230,3.7142857142857144

5458840,3,B00A6EZEOM,"I purchased this collection and while the DVD's are good, the flixster/uv redemption codes don't work.  It said something along the lines of being outside of the UK keeps you from redeeming the codes.  Pretty lame considering part of the reason I picked this up is to have access to the movies digitally.",1387065600,9,304,4.716981132075472

Ive watched all 4 play fine standard bd feautres work u control and such do not.
I won't blame them as may be a compatibility problem my bd player is older.
Picture and sound are basic bd not amazing or 4k but legit.
I would have rather a better upscale and extended movies but price was right.
I feel the low reviews based on dlc are bogus it says its uk half a star would be the most value possible.
Also this is far from a complete collection it has the damon trilogy and legacy not the new one or the 80s classic.
The lesson here is read the description it is accurate assume nothing.",1502755200,,661,4.131782945736434

They need to make it a lot more clear this is not Ultra Violet redeemable in the US.  It was the sole purpose I purchased this set.  I have the movies already, but the cost of conversion to Digital/Ultra Violet was too much.

5458892,1,B00A6EZEOM,"Update after watching 3 of 4 discs in the set.
Reduced ratings to 1 star.
- English subtitles do not work in part 1 and 3. Have to yet check part 4.
- pause for more than 10 min in between a movie and it hangs into the top menu by just displaying the screen with universal and no way to resume playback. Have to restart from the beginning and skip chapters.

Was not cheap so no excuse for the product to behave in the above manner.

Original review---
Quiet good. Played first two parts. Subtitles do not work in he first part even though it shows English as a choice.
Worked well otherwise for audio and video quality.",1483920000,6,620,4.201680672268908

I order from International providers ALL THE TIME & this is the first time something like this has occurred. Sadly, I discovered this after my gift recipient tried to open them on a cross-continent USA flight. Arghh! Should have read all the reviews prior to ordering.

If you're in USA, you need a Region Free player to watch these.  I didn't notice the 12s on the box instead of PG-13s before I bought this.  The description '
The Bourne Collection (Identity / Supremacy / Ultimatum / Legacy) [Blu-ray]' didn't really spell that out for me so I was surprised when I found out, but I have a PS4, which can play things from any region, so I didn't have to return it.

Other than that, this is great.  All four current Bourne movies at a great price.  The picture looks great and the menus on the discs are very cool.  Lots of care was put into these discs which I appreciate.  Too often you grab a collection of movies and they come stuffed in a single case with little to no box art/disc art.  That is not the case with these.  I'm pretty sure the UK covers for these movies are cooler than the USA ones.

""Were sorry, but you have entered a code that is only available for redemption in the following area(s): United Kingdom, Ireland. If you are currently in an area mentioned above, please contact your Internet Service Provider for assistance. ""

So apparently this pack is from the UK and won't allow US resident like me to download the digital copy. THE DVDs WORK HERE IN THE US. I want the readers of the review to know this.

5459051,4,B00A6EZEOM,"A great collection of spy movies. Fun to watch. The first 3 movie about Jason Bourne are the best. A government agency corrupt with power that loses control and struggles to cover-up what they have done while trying to kill off the first of many agents highly trained to be killers at all cost. Lots of people all trying to kill one man who cannot remember who he is or what he has done. As Jason's memory slowly returns he discovers fighting and survival skills he never knew he had. He automatically speaks several languages without even thinking about and takes down two policemen in the park without breaking a sweat. The fourth movie is sort of a spin-off, but not bad. All in all this is a great collection and I hope they continue where the third movie leaves off. Corruption, conspiracy, black ops, and an assassin on a mission to sort it all out and find out who he really is. Enjoy! I did.",1436918400,,899,4.421686746987952

5459073,5,B00A6EZEOM,This is a great movie series. We all know that this kind of action is best in high def. The only little downside is the whole big case thing. If your movies just go on a shelf it's no big deal but if you have a movie rack these things never fit and are a pain. At the same time you don't have to pay nearly as much as you would buying all the movies separately. So it is a give and take but at the end of the day you know you love these movies and want them on blu-ray.

It is the second worst disc case I have ever received (the worst being the vendors who put 4 discs on a single spindle case).  It's twice as thick as in needs to be and is really difficult to close once you've opened it.  I can personally assure you that a 4 disc case only needs to be slightly thicker than a single or double disc case.

The Bourne movies and the BD disc qualities of this collection are excellent albeit rather expensive - $50 for a set of movies way beyond first run.  You can buy the three Matt Damon BD movie set for $30 and the Legacy BD for another $10 - that's what I would recommend you do.",1421884800,,696,4.0510948905109485

5459092,4,B00A6EZEOM,"I am sure if you are reading this you are familiar with the films in this collection. This review will be based on the packaging and video/audio quality. To start off, this is some sort of combo of the first three films in a collection and the fourth film. You can purchase the same collection of the first three films separately from the fourth film on Amazon for about the same price. My main issue with this set is the fact that the discs aren't region 1 (USA). They work fine with region 1 players and look and sound great with the right setup. When first playing The Bourne Identity my PS 4 produced an error and then loaded on the second attempt. When the film started, the audio was only in stereo and I had to select English again in the audio menu to get the DTS-HD Master Audio track to play. Once everything was working as expected, the audio showed just how good a home theater can be. I was truly impressed with the sound mix on these films. The picture quality is solid but not nearly as good as the sound. I was able to pick this set up for just over $30 and would recommend it at that price.",1417910400,8,1107,4.2018779342723

5459103,5,B00A6EZEOM,"This isn't really a review, but as I found the product description lacking, I decided to compile this list of helpful information below. I hope this will be useful for prospective buyers to know what they're getting:

THE BOURNE IDENTITY (2002): 119 minutes - Director: Doug Liman - Starring: Matt Damon, Franke Potente, Chris Cooper- Genre: Action, Spy - Plot: A man is picked up by a fishing boat, bullet-riddled and suffering from amnesia, before racing to elude assassins and regain his memory. PG-13

THE BOURNE SUPREMACY (2004): 108 minutes - Director: Paul Greengrass - Starring: Matt Damon, Karl Urban, Joan Allen - Genre: Action, Spy - Plot: When Jason Bourne is framed for a CIA operation gone awry, he is forced to resume his former life as a trained assassin to survive. PG-13

THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM (2007): 115 minutes - Director: Paul Greengrass - Starring: Matt Damon, Joan Allen, David Strathairn - Genre: Action, Spy - Plot: Jason Bourne dodges a ruthless CIA official and his agents from a new assassination program while searching for the origins of his life as a trained killer. PG-13

THE BOURNE LEGACY (2012): 135 minutes - Director: Tony Gilroy - Starring: Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz, Edward Norton - Genre: Action, Spy - Plot: An expansion of the universe from Robert Ludlum's novels, centered on a new hero whose stakes have been triggered by the events of the previous three films. PG-13

Now let's crunch some numbers. This collection costs $28.86, and contains 4 films. To find the value of the individual film you're getting, we divide the price by the number of films to get an individual price of $7.21 per film, a middling price for this admittedly action-packed and riveting set of spy films. I hope this information is useful to you. Cheers!",1412467200,142,1775,4.883720930232558

I wonder sometimes if these Ludlum stories are biographical or autobiographical: was Ludlum in the military recruited and trained to assassinate?  At first, I could not find much biography of Mr. Ludlum to see if he had anything in common with Bourne?  Surly, the Bourne series raises many issues related to democracy in the United States, the Snoden affair has certainly given much to chew on and forced Americans to take a good look at how surveillance is taking away their freedoms.  The last movie on the Ludlum/Bourne legacy reveals how black ops continue to be used to cover for discovered black ops.(court proceedings combined with illegal spying on Pamela Landy).  These are areas most Americans would not be interested in on an ongoing basis but are absolutely necessary to take a close look at to preserve democratic institutions.
