7885683,5,6305198373,"OK...I confess...I like the Beatles like everyone else...I think Ringo's totally adorable...but...I bought the video to see Mark Hudson play.
Yes, yes, yes...I'm a shameless fan of Mark and his work as a writer, producer and singer...and...at one time...a TV star as well...
His production work and writing on this album/video doesn't disappoint!  He makes Ringo sound great...btw...no easy task!
OK...those who aren't interested in Mark will be thrilled to know that Ringo really has a great time during this ""Storytellers"" stint on MTV...he sings some of the old ones...a few new ones and is generally Ringo!
You'll also be surprised to find quite a few well known wonderful musicians backing him up...
Sigh...Mark...do more videos...maybe one of your own?",1030060800,,758,5.316666666666666
7885684,5,6305198373,"I agree with the other review, this show was a pleasant surprise.  Ringo  is definitely the Beatle with the sense of humor who had nothing to prove,  but he proves a lot by just being Ringo.  One forgets how many hits he had  on his own and also that he wrote a few of the Beatle songs that he sang  with them.  He does many of his solo hits here with his ALL STARR band and  they do a wonderful job.  It's a great performance and a fun,time for all.  Everybody loves Ringo.",962582400,,474,4.0
