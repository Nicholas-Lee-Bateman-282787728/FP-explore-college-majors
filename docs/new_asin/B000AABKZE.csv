2383492,4,B000AABKZE,"I have to disagree with the last reviewer.  I found this to be a superb overview.  The authors have an obvious love for the comic genre, and the result is a very consciencious and thorough review.

It proceeds at a fair pace but never feels rushed.  Tons of archival material are presented, as well as as some very interesting and unique input from Kevin Smith, Stan Lee, Will Eisner, Jim Steranko, Frank Miller (""I find my work kind of...jolly""), as well as execs from Marvel and DC.

The presentation is lavished with a variety of source-material, and it proceeds chronologically, giving a great deal of attention to the formative years of Superman, the role of comics during WWII, both on and off the page, and the mid-50s crisis engendered by Wertham and the Comics Code.  It covers up to about 2002, stopping to examine the industry slump of the 1990s as well as the reactions to the September 11th attacks (though this part gets a bit self-important and heavy-handed).

There are a few omissions.  The Watchmen gets a great deal of attention (""something like a bar-fight in the industry"" opines a DC executive), but nothing else on Alan Moore's work is discussed.  There's no mention of Grant Morrison's work, and it would have been interesting to see the industry's reactions to films that have appropriated comic book conventions, such as the Matrix.

Still, these are small concerns given the high quality of the DVD as a whole.  A must for even casual fans of the genre.",1144540800,33,1480,4.7421875

8076901,4,B000AABKZE,"A must see for any comic book lover, er for any lover of American and indeed world history for that matter. Could have used a little bit more exciting graphics however in the presentation. Also from the hallowed halls of dramatic voices is Keith David who in my opinion is in the pantheon along with James Earl Jones and John Facenda.",1384560000,,334,4.491803278688525
8076902,5,B000AABKZE,"While the History Channel only occasionally makes entertaining and factual documentaries, this one was great. This is a 100 minute documentary film that doesn't really cover the HISTORY of comics, it covers the HISTORY of the comics industry, focusing on superheroes. It leaves out a lot, but does manage to weave a rough narrative of the comic book industry from the beginnings of Superman until about the year 2001.

The reason I say that this does not cover the HISTORY of comics as a whole is that it ignores the comic strip almost entirely. These were important because they gave birth to the comic book industry. As a result, heroes who predated Superman such as The Phantom, Dick Tracy, The Clock, Flash Gordon and The Green Hornet are not mentioned. The documentary does take the viewer through all the major developments in the industry from the beginnings of the Golden Age to post WW2 to the Marvel age and the development of modern comics in the 1980's. Worth a watch and worth buying if you are a comic book fan!",1355097600,,1025,4.694444444444445
8076903,5,B000AABKZE,"What can I say? AWESOME FROM START TO FINISH! I don' t think you can get it right any better than this! The inception to the future of comics and the significant players (meaning heroes) who defined and re-defined the genre of comics was not in haste or without merit. If you are going to watch a documentary on the history of comic books? Look no further than this great resource and educational value of superheroes and villains galore!

8076904,4,B000AABKZE,"In short, the program is worth watching but might not be worth purchasing. It did provide an insightful overview of the history of comics in America. I was very pleased to see that it contained a varitey of artists and writers who were interviewed for their contributions towards comic art. Will Eisner, Stan Lee, Steranko, and Frank Miller are just a few of the people interviewed.  The only disappointing aspect of the program is that it includes little psychological background of superheroes and villans.",1232928000,,508,5.0476190476190474

8076906,5,B000AABKZE,"This DVD from the History Channel shows how how the superhero evolved from a two-dimensional character intended for kids reading the ""funny papers"" to character with real depth and problems, showing both resilience and relevance in the modern world. Comics are no longer for just kids anymore and this video reflects that point. Great for history buffs and comic lovers alike. The comic is a legitimate form of art. Buy this DVD and see for yourself.",1202947200,2,450,4.934210526315789
8076907,5,B000AABKZE,I have a newfound respect for Superheroes!  I had no idea there was such a historical/cultural connection.  I will always look at an action figure differently now as a result of this well done documentary.  Bravo!,1200787200,3,213,4.861111111111111
