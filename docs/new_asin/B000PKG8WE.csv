8192196,2,B000PKG8WE,"This is essentially a hard-core porn film within a historical setting.  Think Tinto Brass' Caligula with a B-movie budget and none of the talent.  In spite of the spurious claims on the dvd box that this film has been digitally remastered, the picture quality is absolutely terrible.  Recommended only for the curious.",1444435200,2,318,5.076923076923077
8192197,1,B000PKG8WE,"Rasputin is nothing more than an adults only production made specificaly for the Adult Film Circuit.
Its transfer from film to video and then onto DVD has resulted in a sub-standard end product of no historical accuracy.
The picture quality is poor and does not hold ones attention for very long.
I think that other versions of the story are superior to this one.
I can always say that I saw it once.

8192198,1,B000PKG8WE,"This movie definitely needs a warning for explicit sexual content.  It seems as if every other scene tries to outdo the one before it in terms of grossness and perverse activity.  In addition, one does not learn much about Rasputin and his interaction with the royal family.  If I would have had an inkling as to the way this period of time was presented, I would NEVER have purchased this movie.",1337644800,2,396,4.549295774647887

8192200,5,B000PKG8WE,"I do not own this film, but my history professor wisely showed it to my class in college. In Russian with English subtitles, I found this picture to be the most historically accurate, especially with the inclusion of Rasputin's most loyal women follower and conspiritor. This films shows Rasputin as an animal with unconquerable lusts. This is a must see for any person who wishes to know more about the myth from the man!",1135987200,4,422,4.716216216216216
