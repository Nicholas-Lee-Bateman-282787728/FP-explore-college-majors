8112619,5,B000EPTOP8,"Round the twist is extremely awesome for kids. Although the special effects might a bit crappy but it is very funny. Like there was this magic remote control that can pause, fast forward, rewind, forward and repeat. In that episode it made a bus go backwards exactly the same way, or like how a man's pants fell down accidentally so pulled it back up and a boy pressed repeat so the man pushed his pants back down and up and down and up, so that part was what I call very creative. There are few episodes that I like: Spaghetti pig out, Wunderpants, Skunkman, and there are still more to come. So the series are awesome for everyone. I highly recommend this product to anyone who likes good laughs.",1313884800,4,698,4.4186046511627906
