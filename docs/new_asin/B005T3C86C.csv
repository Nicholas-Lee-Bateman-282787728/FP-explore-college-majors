8485744,1,B005T3C86C,"This has to be, imho, the single worst concert DVD I've ever seen. First off, the venue in Poland looks like a gymnasium with the band crowded onto a mini stage. And some band....during one of his introductions Clive Nolan introduces Mick Pointer as having formed the band in a pub. Well sorry Clive but it looks like neither of you ever left. As for the rest of the band only guitarist John Mitchell looks reasonably comfortable. New singer in the ever revolving vocalist chair, Paul Manzi has a fairly decent voice but poor stage presence. He resembles the same discomfort that Ariel Pineda shows in the vacated Steve Perry role. Just doesn't fit. Worst of all is new member, bassist Kylan Amos. While his playing is decent though not very intricate, his prowling around the stage as if he was Robert Trujillo just looks ridiculous. And the last time I saw anyone wear a hat like that was because they were either covering up their baldness or trying to dress like Robin or Maurice Gibb. They got away with it in the disco era Kylan and that era is long dead.
The audio is muddy and compressed and the microphones covering Mick's cymbals were pointed straight up thus making the cymbals practically inaudible. NOTE: BUYER BEWARE !!!
At the same time that I ordered the XX DVD ( having heard a lot of the ""older"" Arena cds and ""older/other band"") I took a chance and ordered the cd from Amazon as well. I don't know if Amazon is aware but the copy I got was SO BAD audio wise that it sounds like a bootleg. What makes matters worse is that it's clearly in MONO not even remotely stereo. I was so angry with the quality of both items but I didn't return the items to Amazon as they don't manufacture the item Metal Mind does. I'm sure they're well aware of their shoddy merchandise and probably don't care as is evidenced by this awful product. I love prog as much as you all do but this one you need to steer clear from. Just AWFUL !!!",1492387200,,1936,4.410614525139665
8485745,5,B005T3C86C,"I have to disagree with the earlier reviewer. I enjoyed this DVD even more than the last. Paul Manzi seems much more relaxed and he is one hell of a singer. The band sounded tight, with a good mix. Sure, the stage was small, but Arena live are really good! Strong song structures with more ballad-like songs playing to the strength of the singer. There is a bit of Ronnie James Dio living in Mr Manzi I think. Pyle driving Drums, Ethereal Keys and John Mitchell's soaring guitar solos. It's too bad that this sort of heavy prog/rock is not more popular in America. I love the overall sound they present and appreciate the musicianship that brings it to life.... Keep it coming Clive!",1464652800,3,683,4.516129032258065
8485746,2,B005T3C86C,"This DVD was not recorded in the usual venue from the Metal Productions team. The stage and the
venue is a lot smaller. The light show doesn't have that same quality of the previous Arena's DVDS
which is a shame, Is the band less popular these days? I heard that this tour was not a success.
Maybe they could not fill the usual bigger venue. First thing that strike me watching this is how
the red light make everything blurry. You can think that this was filmed with standard definition
cameras. Also the camera work is questionable at times being late  focusing on solo playing. I will
be more positive with the audio and the performance in general. The sound and the playing are good
and the inclusion of the epic ""Moviedrome"" in the set is a welcome addition. The 4 tracks of the new
album didn't bring the same positive impression i had listening to the latest cd. The only others
real highlights of that show is the other epic ""Solomon"", the song ""Hanging Tree"" and the video
intro in the Hitchcock style of horror movie  Maybe the band wanted to imitate Rush with this old
venue that looks like made for a small band with no budget, but the difference is that here, you
have to watch this thing for two painful hours and that it's for real.  I don't recommend this for those who don't have
anything about this band in DVD, buy the previous or only the 2cd audio.",1459900800,2,1369,4.403162055335969
