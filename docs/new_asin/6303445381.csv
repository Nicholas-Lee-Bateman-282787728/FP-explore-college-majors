7847959,3,6303445381,"This review is for Love Bites, the 80's New Wave romantic Comedy/Drama with an all male cast.

The main character dedicated to tracking Vampries and exterminating them, stubles apon Damien the COunt of West Hollywood, (done in fun).

He meets his new found friend and sidekick as they set out to trap Damien and drive a stake through his heart. They did not count on Damien's watcher or falling in love. Like most vampire movies Count Damien falls in love at first site with the main character and love ensues.

About an hour and 10 minutes this lost wacky 80's gem is quite amusing.

This movie is mainly for gay men or B-movie or vampire lovers. There is no gore and no sex. This would be rated PG-13 by today's standards although there are several scenes of full frontal nudity be nearly the whole cast.

It's worth what it's selling price is, $4 or so.",1166832000,2,856,4.496774193548387

7847961,5,6303445381,"I didn't realize how rare this film is!  It is well worth the watch, and is definitely one of the best non-80s 80s movies ever!  LOL.  Technically, it is not an 80s film since it was released in 1992, but in its spirit it definitely fulfills all the qualities of some of the greatest 80s films!
Taking a hit on the traditional vampire genre, the film begins when Adam Ant's character, Zachary Sims, wakes up after having slept in his crypt for 100 years.  When he awakes, he meets Kendall, a woman both fiesty and filled with romantic notions of finding the ""perfect man.""  Kendall soon falls in love with the charming and handsome Zachary, quickly dumping her fiance for him.
Kendall then sets out on a mission to ""re-humanize"" Zachary, who had become a vampire in 1600s after falling in love with a woman who turned out to be a vampire herself.  They spent two hundred years together, after which she developed ""a taste for politics"" and left him, without a word.  Heartbroken, Zachary retreated to his tomb where he slept until 1992.
This film has the perfect blend of silliness, satire, and romance.  It may seem like a ridiculous movie at first, but Adam Ant plays the part of Zachary Sims so touchingly that it really adds depth to the movie.  Besides, it's really really funny!!
Here's just one sample of a line from the film...
Once Kendall begins ""rehumanizing"" Zachary, he gets an answering machine in his crypt which has the following message:
""I can't come to the phone right now, I'm dead.""
If you get an opportunity to see this great film, I highly recommend you sieze it!!",1061424000,2,1587,4.599290780141844
