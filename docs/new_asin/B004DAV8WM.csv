At last our revenge on the Aussie attacks. This film is the ultimate comeuppance for the Australians... those so-and-sos who have been maltreating our hapless students who go to the foreign land to garner education and come back black and blue.

Blue is the colour that director Mohit Suri favours for his lurid leery look at white babes in Melbourne. There's a white chick and a brown chick for the Chick-let hero to choose from. He sleeps with the former and falls in love with the latter. As simple as that.

In trying to do a ferocious flag-waving trick over the complex issue of racism and colour prejudice, ""Crook"" ends up making the Australian population look like a bunch of psychotic killers bashing and burning the good desi boys who have gone Under to gain gyan. Is this Australia or Chicago during the Prohibition?

But the acting was pretty good even though the politics were a little mangled, the movie manages to entertain the audiences, with good acting on the part of Emraan Hashmi. Worth Watching.",1300579200,,1163,4.686274509803922
