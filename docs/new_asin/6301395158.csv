8178161,4,6301395158,Kinda hokey but surprisingly enjoyable! Basic entertainment with some twists.,1507420800,,77,6.8
8178162,1,6301395158,Are they kidding - lots of good actors but the production values are just terrible - cliche upon cliche. If you like war movies DON'T watch this one. not even close.,1504828800,,165,4.354838709677419
8178163,3,6301395158,"Richard Conte stars and directs this WW2 action film.  Along with Rory Calhoun.  The rest of the actors are Yugoslavians with the occasional terrible acting.  It is about a plan to save a British officer who has plans for the Allied invasion of the Balkans.  Set in the salt fields along the Dalmatia coast.  It takes awhile to set up the two Americans with the local resistance.  A long, long scene of a plane strafing men who are trying to escape across the salt flats almost turned me off.  But there are some plot twists that moved this from a 2 start up to 3.  Richard Conte did have a lot of leading roles but always put in a good performance.",1503360000,,649,4.305785123966942

8178165,3,6301395158,"Actually this effort does have some redeeming factors. Fairly good acting, pretty good script, not too bad a story line, and moves along so as to keep you from falling asleep. Maybe not a stellar work, but good enough for an off night...",1055894400,,237,4.534883720930233
