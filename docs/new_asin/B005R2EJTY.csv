8484011,3,B005R2EJTY,"This DVD is obviously illegal, having been recorded off of TCM...complete with TCM logo superimposed periodically in the lower right-hand corner of the screen. One wonders why they bother with this anti-piracy gimmick when it obviously doesn't thwart the piracy. But I for one am grateful to the pirates, because that's the only way we'll ever see these films on DVD. Some of them are gems, some are turkeys. This one is both. I can't say I'm in love with the movie. (My three-star rating would be an indication.) But I'm glad I bought it and I'm glad I saw it. I'm a sucker for 30s movies in general, and this is, face it, a piece of cinema history, if not high art. So I say: More power to pirates! (I do wish the pirates in question would put in chapter breaks, though.)",1437868800,3,773,4.4125874125874125
8484012,3,B005R2EJTY,"This weird Whale film is a real um.. matter of taste. I love Whale but it tries so hard to be bubbly it comes off shrill. I think Whale's horror films are hilarious, but this one's--well. some love it, i've never been able to finish it...

The DVD is... well, from a third party interest, I'm surprised Amazon's even carrying it, but though the image is kind of waxy it's still a step up from most bootleg stuff. Packaging made with a lot of DVD-R color xerox love from some outfit called 'Pre-Code -- something or other' - way better than Alpha, though",1431302400,5,553,4.368932038834951
