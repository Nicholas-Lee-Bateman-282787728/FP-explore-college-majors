8570408,5,B00BLJ35LU,"Although I prefer Mondo Vision's 113 mins director's cut, NTSC DVD, my desire to see this amazing film on blu ray disc necessitated making some concessions. This German blu ray has a running time of 108 mins (director's cut, PAL). Also, there is an English dubbed version as one of the set up options, however no subtitles are available. I would have preferred to read them instead of listen to the hokey dubbing. Nevertheless, until there is a blu ray of the previously mentioned Mondo Vision DVD, this Zulawski fanatic will have to compromise. Of course, you will need a region free blu ray player to watch it.",1482796800,,612,4.675925925925926
