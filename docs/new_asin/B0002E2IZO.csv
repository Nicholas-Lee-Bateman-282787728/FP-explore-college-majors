The lady I care for is 96 her son is 62 and they both enjoy these time loved favorites.
I feel really grateful too for the price and for how quickly it arrived.",1316217600,2,431,4.180722891566265
8027076,5,B0002E2IZO,"I saw this on PBS when it first aired in the late 90's, and consider it far better than the later Precious Memories special.  The show features hosts Norma Zimmer, Mary Lou Metzger, Ralna English, Guy Hovis, Bob Ralston, and Tom Netherton both performing and introducing various Christian and inspirational songs.  The majority of the performances are clips from various Lawrence Welk shows taken from its nearly thirty year run on television, but all the hosts perform live during the broadcast.  This is an excellent show and well worth the money; my only gripe is that it isn't available on DVD.",1185840000,8,598,4.900990099009901
