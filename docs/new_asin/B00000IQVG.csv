7911334,5,B00000IQVG,"Just watched this again after a few years from my favorite-movie archives, and was mesmerized, kept on the end of my chair & tear-jerked again! Unfortunately this show seems to be rather rare these days and only on VHS, can't find on rerun lists anymore. Maybe due to its 3:2 aspect ratio, but you quickly overlook that due to its engrossing aura.  As another reviewer alluded to, it's what doesn't meet the eye that makes this movie stand out.  Even skeptics that don't believe in NDEs would probably identify with other aspects.

If you're tired of today's typical trash and looking for something with more substance, imho well worth 90 or so minutes on a cool evening. (Note: not for kids; there are several other movies with similar titles--add ""Randy Quaid"" or ""Quaid"" to your search string).",1423353600,,797,4.802919708029197

7911336,3,B00000IQVG,"I just watched Last Rites aaand liked Embeth and Quaid. I had seen it before and it was so good, I forgot what the ending was. It must have been good for me  to get scared when I didn't knnnow if Quaid was live or memorex.",1025222400,,222,3.8260869565217392
7911337,3,B00000IQVG,"I stayed up until 2 AM so I could finish watching Last Rites, a pretty good cabler starring Randy Quaid and Embeth Davidtz. The movie stars Quaid as Jeremy Dillon, a serial killer who is shown in the beginning preparing for his execution. He's strapped to the chair and the electricity is on when all of a sudden lightning strikes the chair, leaving him alive but with ""amnesia.""  A psychologist is brought in to evaluate him and pretty soon she begins to believe that he's changed, especially when he begins to have psychic powers that help the FBI in many ways.
Throughout this movie, I was wondering if Dillon's change of heart was real or a ploy to save himself. I thought Quaid did some of his best work to date portraying Dillon first as a cold blooded psychopath and then as someone repulsed by his crimes. Davidtz also was very good as the one woman who cares about him.
The ending was a surprise and actually was the best one they could have had.  I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a decent thriller that doesn't rely on gore. You can probably find it at Hollywood Video or Blockbuster.",1001808000,,1112,4.5
7911338,5,B00000IQVG,"A serial killer is apparently reborn, when lightning strikes as he is being electrocuted. He awakens with no memory of his crimes, and the gift of foreseeing. Is it for real? Or is it just the act of a brilliant, twisted mind, trying to stave off a rematch with the Chair? Randy Quaid will keep you guessing untill the final credits in this suspenseful drama.",1001808000,2,359,4.538461538461538
