This film was made by Sandoz which was the drug company that invented LSD. At the very start of the film there were two subjects apparently both psych majors though that is never really stated, but one of the subjects ""drops out"" and there is a subject who bears a resemblence to E.Fuller Torrey. What you see is how he reacts to LSD. It is pretty dry stuff but is an excellent film if you are a psych major or have an interest in this dark subject as I do.",1397433600,,699,4.343511450381679
