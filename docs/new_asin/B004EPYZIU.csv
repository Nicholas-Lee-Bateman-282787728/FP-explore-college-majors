4338439,5,B004EPYZIU,"At our house, the only time Christmas specials were allowed on TV was between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day.  The only exception was Prep & Landing.  Outstanding story, excellent animation, and characters you care about.  It lived on our DVR until the DVR gave up the ghost - can't wait to have it on DVD.",1317772800,,307,4.545454545454546
4338440,5,B004EPYZIU,"I do hope this comes out with the short sequels as well.  It is hilarious.  If you are a fan of shows like ""24"" or movies like ""Mission Impossible"" you will get a kick out this, that is the spin they put on the production of Santa's big night.  The elves are in ""prep and landing"" division with their job being to secure the scene for Santa's arrival.  Elf Wayne was passed up for a big promotion, it having been given to his old partner, and now he has a new, very green partner to train.  He is not thrilled about it, and hence, is not giving it his best this year, then pandemonium ensues.  The situation room always cracks me up- Magee with her many cups of cocoa,Tiny, and ""patching you through!"" office type humor there.  We loved this too, it was a fixture on our DVR as well for a long time until it was accidentally erased- so please hurry and release it!!",1316390400,12,865,4.206060606060606
4338441,5,B004EPYZIU,"Like so many others, my daughter and of course us parents fell in love with this show the first time it aired on TV.  We have had it recorded on our DVR and we watch the show weekly and sometimes daily.  My 2 year old daughter gets so engrossed with the show nothing can tear her attention away.  This has to be one of the most well made Christmas shows ever!  Excitement, adventure and of course a Great moral lesson!!  If you haven't seen this show for yourself I recommend that you do and promise you will be hooked from then on!",1315094400,,532,4.176470588235294
4338442,4,B004EPYZIU,"I wish I could give this Four Stars because the show (and the mini-sequels) itself are so awesome, but the fact that it's not coming out on Blu-ray after waiting all these years makes me cry in my cocoa.",1312502400,,203,4.230769230769231
4338443,5,B004EPYZIU,We've had this show on our DVR since 2009 and I am about to loose it due to new DRV boxes.  Very sad but very happy we will have it on DVD. They boys are watching the show right now and it's the middle of July.  This is the BEST Christmas show out there.,1310947200,,254,3.685185185185185
4338444,5,B004EPYZIU,"Prep and Landing premiered on ABC in 2009, with a short featuring Betty White (!) added in 2010, and is hands-down the BEST Christmas special in recent years.  Two elves, Wayne and Lanny from the elite Prep and Landing elf squad, go about working on the BIG night in this Christmas buddy movie.  This story is sweet, laugh out loud funny, and truly embodies the spirit of the season.  It is NOT an exaggeration that every single person in your family will enjoy this dvd.

We've had the original episode and the shorts saved on our DVR for years now, watching it all (and I mean ALL) year round, and I am overjoyed that Disney Studios is FINALLY putting out the dvd!  For those saying that this dvd is overpriced, it retails for $19.99, not taking into account the pre-order guarantee and various possible discounts offered by Amazon.  Yes, the 'feature' is super short, but it is absolutely worth buying!!  *** This is so tinsel!!! ***",1310256000,2,936,4.602409638554217
4338445,5,B004EPYZIU,"My infant son fell in love with this special this past Christmas.  We had it recorded on our DVR and whenever he was fussy, all I had to do was turn this on and he quieted right down mesmerized.  Well, it was deleted off our recorded list about a month ago.  TRAGEDY!  DISASTER!  Not happy we have to wait so long to get the DVD, but so glad it will finally be available for purchase.

Being that this was produced by the Pixar people (John Lasseter) it is so well done.  The characters are cute and fun and the animation is wonderful.  It's also very funny- adults will enjoy this too.  I especially like that the elf, Wayne, has ""a pension!""

Perfect for Christmas, perfect for families to watch together.  It will be part of our Christmas tradition from now on.",1308873600,3,764,4.347517730496454

4338447,5,B004EPYZIU,This was a really fun new show last Christmas which I am very happy to say that I was able to Tivo. I would definitely buy the DVD but I think for a 15 - 20 minute show $18 is way overpriced!,1307318400,2,191,3.5714285714285716
4338448,5,B004EPYZIU,I have been waiting for this to come out.  I can wait till November (right around my birthday too--sweet).  I tried to tape it off of television to have it because it wasn't being released on DVD but everytime it was on there was a stupid snow storm so they had the weather ticker at the bottom of the TV (Minnesota Oi!). I will now be able to add it to my impressive Christmas movie collection (over 100).,1306972800,,406,4.1923076923076925

Not one of our favorites, but a good one for when we want something a little different.  It might be even cuter for adults that get all the hidden details/jokes.",1403049600,,286,4.3584905660377355

4338655,2,B004EPYZIU,"I'm sure it will be cute to watch, but $17-18 for a 22 min film, not worth it. Save your money!",1385424000,,95,3.5714285714285716

4338657,3,B004EPYZIU,I must say that I was disappointed to realize that it's not a full length movie. Though it was very cute and had a lot of extra features. The DVD was in perfect condition and arrived a lot faster than expected.,1378857600,,210,4.146341463414634

4338761,5,B004EPYZIU,This is a GREAT Disney movie for the Christmas season! so cleverly made. the second one i did not care for but this is worth having. If there is a DVD with both #1 and #2 for the same price it would be a better deal i guess,1362700800,,223,3.6666666666666665

4338766,4,B004EPYZIU,"This was an entertaining and clever movie. Elves in stealth mode was a fun take on Santa's story. The details are ingenious. My kids love it. I love it. The only bad thing I have to say is it's less than a half hour and yet Disney charged 15-20 bucks for this movie, or should I say episode since it's so short? It's a great Christmas movie/episode to own but I think it is worth ten bucks. I still don't regret purchasing it. My son has watched it several times all year. If you want some good clean family fun gear up for some Prep and Landing.

P.S. We love you Disney but we hate your high prices and your vault that only opens every dang decade...",1338336000,,652,4.133858267716535
4338767,4,B004EPYZIU,"When ""Glago's Guest"" writer Chris Williams had an idea of an elf Christmas story and pitched to Walt Disney Animation studios shorts program, Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter felt the idea would make a great half-hour TV special for ABC.

As the idea which would later become ""Prep & Landing"" was greenlighted by the network, Chris Williams was then working and co-directing the animated film ""Bolt"" and so ""Brother Bear"" writer Kevin Deters and ""Brother Bear"", ""Tarzan"" writer Stevie Wermers were brought in to co-write and direct the 22-minute Christmas special which aired in Dec. 2009.

The special which was budgeted for $14 million would go on to to be nominated for five Emmy Awards (winning four for ""Outstanding Animated Program"", ""Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation"" for Art Director, Storyboard Artist and Background Key design) and nine Annie Awards (winning ""Best Animated Television Production"", ""Character Design in a Television Production and ""Production Design in a Television Production"").

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Prep & Landing"" is presented in widescreen (1:78:1 - enhanced for 169 televisions), English and French Dolby Digital 5.1, Spanish Dolby Digital 2.0 and subtitles in English SDH French and Spanish.

The CG animation for this TV special is fantastic!  In fact, the overall look of the film is what makes me enjoy this TV special so much is because there was a lot of production value put into it.  I'm not just talking about characters but also objects, scenery.  The CG for this special is absolutely wonderful!

Dialogue and music is clear and too bad this special won't be released on blu-ray (for now at least) because this is one special which would look even more wonderful in HD!

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Prep & Landing"" comes with the following special feature:

  Operation Secret Santa - (6:53) Mrs. Claus hires Wayne and Lanny to find a mystery box in Santa's office.
  Tiny's Big Adventure - (1:09) Tiny needs to make coffee but the coffee can is too high.
  Kringle Academy Training Videos: - Featuring three animated training videos: Welcome to Kringle Academy (1:27) , Equipment Training (1:50), Do's and Dont's (1:33).
  North Pole News - (1:28) Newsreel with big stories for the tiniest elf!
  North Pole Commercials - (1:40) 3 Hilarious Ads Straight from the North Pole

JUDGMENT CALL:

Wonderful CG animation, enjoyable holiday story...The award-winning Disney/ABC TV special ""Prep & Landing"" finally gets its release on DVD!

In Dec. 2009, ""Prep & Landing"" aired on television and I was blown away by the CG animation but also how entertaining the TV special and literally, me and my young son wanted more!  And while I was waiting for it to be released on DVD in 2010, it never was released.  But with the characters of ""Prep & Landing"" returning for a new TV special titled ""Prep & Landing: Naughty vs. Nice"" for Dec. 2011, the first Christmas special ""Prep & Landing"" has been released on DVD!

And I can only hope that ""Prep & Landing"" will be a recurring holiday special because the animation for this film really distinguishes itself among other holiday 3D animated specials.  And for the most part, the stories are so easy to follow, are very fun to watch and for this special, it's one holiday family film that will attract viewers of all ages.

In fact, for adults, there are a lot of in-jokes in this holiday special.  Magee has a Christmas Tree ala ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"", ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" is shown on Timmy's TV set at their house and also little Disney additions that fans may pick up on!

I know it's hard to recommend a holiday DVD if the episode is only 22-minutes long but fortunately, Walt Disney Home Entertainment includes two more ""Prep & Landing"" shorts, ""Operation Santa Claus"" (which features Betty White as the voice of Mrs. Claus) and ""Tiny's Big Adventure"".  In addition, there are other animated special features included on this DVD as well!

Overall, ""Prep & Landing"" is an enjoyable holiday special on DVD and if you are looking for an enjoyable holiday special for the children, that is safe, fun and very entertaining... I can easily recommend ""Prep & Landing""!",1335571200,,4166,4.963924963924964

4338979,4,B004EPYZIU,"I would rate this 5 stars if it were longer. For the price it should have been a full length movie. It was cute and with all the extras it made it not so bad. Both the kids were glued to the t.v. while watching this and they liked the extras as well. Although when it was over they both asked if that was it. I would recommend it, just know it's not a full length movie. It's a few shorts.",1326153600,,389,3.814814814814815

4338982,3,B004EPYZIU,"Have been eagerly anticipating watching this movie.  Little did I know that the trailer was almost as long as the movie.
$15 for a 30 minute movie just strikes me as being ridiculous.  $5-$7 would have been more appropriate.  Other than that,
the short movie was good.  I enjoyed it.",1325721600,,283,4.6

4338984,3,B004EPYZIU,"This movie is cute, but I didn't realize it was under a half hour long. I paid $14 for what I thought was a full length movie.

We have watched it over and over again and it has become our new favorite Christmas tradition! Watch and ENJOY!!!!,1324425600,,420,4.2625
4339012,5,B004EPYZIU,"One of our all time favorite Christmas movies! I had to own this for the future, because sometimes we can't wait for the one or two times a year that its played on TV.

The story is a new spin on the ol' Santa myth, explaining to the new generation of tech savvy kids how things are done. It helps explain those pesky questions that arise every year like ""how does Santa not get burned by the fire"" and ""How does Santa do it all in one night?""

For adults, the jokes are there just for you.

Highly recommended for everyone.",1324252800,,524,4.1683168316831685
4339013,2,B004EPYZIU,"Waste of money.  Seriously, the previews are longer than the show, including the 4 shorts (very short shorts) they add to the show.  I got this on sale and I still feel like I wasted my money.",1324166400,,192,4.162162162162162
4339014,5,B004EPYZIU,"I generally am weary of ""new"" Christmas specials but luckily, I am often surprised and sometimes find a new classic. Prep and Landing is definitely one of them. The animation is beautiful and more importantly, there is a very original story. It starts and ends quickly (under 30min) but it just leaving you wanting to see more. Highly recommended!",1323648000,,347,4.898305084745763
4339015,5,B004EPYZIU,"Every year, since this movie was released on TV we have made it a family tradition to watch this movie after we set up our tree with the kids (now 6yo and 3yo). And they look forward to it EVERY YEAR! I think next year we will have to add Naughty Vs Nice to the collection, since it was included in our tradition this year!",1323475200,,323,3.9846153846153847
4339016,3,B004EPYZIU,"The movie was great however because it was only 22 minutes short(I mean long), it should not be the same price as a full length movie. it would have been better if they had another short movie to fill the gap.

My 9yr loved the movie but she was shocked and disappointed when it ended so quickly.  Her exact words were
  ""What happened?  It done already, that sucks.""

The plus is that there are some bonus features, but some are not that impressive.

Therefore my suggestion is to rent the movie and save some money

4339017,4,B004EPYZIU,"This is a great movie.  I knew ahead of time it was short and while I think this is very overpriced for the lenght of the movie, I bought it anyway because I like it.  My complaint is that Disney didn't bother to take out where the commercial breaks were when this was a TV show.  Seriously, for this kind of money they really should have fixed it so it was a seamless DVD.  In one scene an elf is trying to open a door and the screen literally goes black for a second because that's where the commercial break was, and then it comes back on a second later.  Very disappointed they didn't clean that up before releasing the DVD.",1323302400,,628,4.1570247933884295
4339018,4,B004EPYZIU,"First, let me say that this movie is really cute. I loved the entire concept of it and wondered why they didn't make it last longer than 22 minutes.
Second, it is only 22 minutes. I misread it when I bought it at the toy store and thought it was 72 minutes long. Thankfully, it was on sale because I would have been more than irritated to spend $16.99 on such a short movie. Like I said before...it is great and my son loved it, but he was very disappointed when it ended so quickly.",1322870400,2,483,4.094736842105263
4339092,5,B004EPYZIU,"When I saw the previews for this several years ago, I KNEW this would be another hit from Disney...and it looks like a LOT of folks agree.

The story is wonderful and masterfully done using all the ""special ops"" protocol that makes it all the more exciting. It's one of the FASTEST half hours in TV history!

The characters are fantastic, and the actors chosen for them could not be better.
The CGI is outstanding.
This has fast become a new holiday ""tradition"" at our house.

Plus, you can also stop on by the Disney website and actually ""take part"" at the Kris Kringle Academy, and see if YOU have what it takes to be an Elf like Lanny or Wayne.

This is a must have DVD for Christmas...and it truly does help ""to make the season bright""...for ""children"" of EVERY age.
I give it TWO (cookie and milk-stained) thumbs UP!",1322784000,4,821,4.417218543046357
4339093,5,B004EPYZIU,"I bought this based on all the other great reviews because it looked like a fun stocking stuffer. Then I rationalized to myself that it would be fun to pop in while trimming the tree and opened it up early. That was last Saturday, and I think we've watched it about 12 times now. HOW did we not hear of this before? This is a truly funny and creative spin on the joy and magic of Christmas. My kids love it. They are both under 5, but if I can do, ""Again, mommy. Again"" for the third time in a row and not want to stab myself with something, it's pretty good. Some of the humor(especially in the ""extras"") is aimed straight at Mom and Dad--it will zoom right over the kids' heads, but is in no way inappropriate. It IS a short, and I do wish there was more of it, but the little extras make up for it, as far as we're concerned. The second one, a special mission for Mrs. Claus (voiced by Betty White, who totally rocked it) is almost better than the original one, in my opinion. I got a little teary on that one, after laughing so hard my kids looked at me funny, clearly wondering what could be wrong with mommy, the freak. Really, it is so worth $14. And we are really looking forward to the new one airing on Monday. (Sneaky Disney releasing it on DVD just before the new episode airs--there's no way we'd miss it now!) DVR is all set. If you're still on the fence, Disney has trailers, here: [...]",1322784000,,1402,4.158088235294118
4339094,1,B004EPYZIU,"This DVD costs just about what a full length movie costs, and it is only 22 minutes long.  The only reason we bought it was because we had just heard of this at some point in the past, and assumed it was a movie.

I would return this if I could.  What a rip off.",1322524800,6,262,3.727272727272727
4339095,5,B004EPYZIU,"I love holiday movies but with little ones at home it can be hard to find movies that both them and my husband and I like.  When Prep & Landing came out in 2009, we loved it!  I recorded it on our DVR but it got accidentally deleted - we were all devastated!  Well until now Prep & Landing was just a show we would watch each holiday season, but now we can watch Prep & Landing anytime we want, even in July!

Prep & Landing is an adorable movie that packs so much into its 22 minutes of running time.  The movie is about an elf who is awesome at his job at setting up homes for Santa's arrival, but he gets bored.  After some help he realizes how important his job is and scrambles to get the house ready or Santa may have to pass it up.  The movie is so cute and funny!  We all laughed and my boys (3 and 4) just want to watch it over and over!  It is one Christmas DVD that we will be watching over and over",1322265600,,910,3.849462365591398
4339096,5,B004EPYZIU,"This was by far one of the best cartoons to roll out of Disney in decades. And could have easily been a Christmas classic for years to come.  Such an absolute shame it was only 20minutes long :(  Easily could have entertained me for 2 hours!
I should also state that I am in my 30's and watched this with my wife!  We LOVED it!  Obviously, kids will love it, but it was also a great movie for any age.

DISNEY, TURN THIS INTO A MOVIE!!!!",1322179200,2,437,4.034883720930233
4339097,4,B004EPYZIU,"Prep and Landing premiered in 2009 and has become a modern, holiday classic. We received our review copy over the weekend and my youngest has watched it four times. The animated Christmas special clocks in at 22 minutes, but there are plenty of other featurettes that add to the fun. I enjoyed the new mythos that Walt Disney Animation brought to the holiday season. The idea of a hi-tech team that prepares for the Big Guy's arrival at each house was a great way to make the story resonate with kids that use gadgets every day.

Here is the review from my eight year-old son:
Kids that like spy movies will like it because it starts out with lots of action. You think the elves are spies! I liked the prep and landing parts the best. It was like they were playing a real video game. It is a great Christmas show and kids are going to love it. You should buy it now so you can watch it a lot before Santa comes.
So, after dictating his thoughts to me, he grabbed the copy of the show and started watching it for the fifth time.

This one is definitely a winner in our house.

Bonus Features:
Prep & Landing Stocking Stuffer Shorts:
Tiny's Big Adventure-The assistant to the North Pole Christmas Eve Command Center is trying to make a pot of coffee and in the process, accidentally ruins the elves' break room.

4339098,5,B004EPYZIU,"Quiet possibly one of the best Christmas movies ever made.  Great attention to details. We had it on our DVR for months and watched it dozens of times.  Each time I found a new detail. The DVD should arrive tomorrow and we are excited about seeing the new short and the four other extras.

This is truly wonderful movie for kids and adults of all ages. Thanks, John Lasiter and the team at pixar for creating a great movie.",1321833600,2,423,4.329113924050633
4339099,5,B004EPYZIU,"FINALLY it is coming out on dvd, because now I can take it off of my DVR where it has been for TWO YEARS.
The grandkids love this and so do we!  It is the most favorite show regardless of the time of year.
It is a real treat to have such a well told special, new for Christmas with a lesson on responsibility. The adult humor is cute too.
We love it!",1321660800,2,350,3.7945205479452055
4339100,4,B004EPYZIU,"There may be only one holiday special better than this one, but by Santas beard they did an incredible job with this show's production. A very original show with a few nods to other classics, the theme and designs are extremely well done.  Disney should get a lump of coal in their stockings though for only releasing this on DVD instead of Blu-ray as well not including the newest short sequel in the release this year.  Maybe could upgrade that to a coal powdered fruit cake if they still release such a Blu-ray a little later in the year.  But Disney showed that the commercialization of Christmas is still a factor with such a release, which means they need to re-watch this movie and the other best Christmas special to maybe get things right with a future release of the Prep and Landing franchise.",1321401600,4,804,4.569444444444445
4339101,5,B004EPYZIU,"We've had it on our DVR since it first came out. My son would watch it year-round.  Alas, somehow it got deleted not long after Christmas last year and GOD you would have thought someone killed his puppy dog.  We have STILL not lived it down.  I am pre-ordering so that I can have that thing in my hot little hands come December 1.  All will then be right with the world.

Mark my words...this show will around for a long time.  No doubt, it will BE. A. CLASSIC.",1320969600,,462,4.134831460674158
4339182,5,B004EPYZIU,"I love that they have added to this franchise every year since the original Prep & Landing came out.  I hope they continue to create new ones each year!  The first year this came out I watched it over and over all season long.  It is so clever and so adorable, young and old will love it!

4339183,5,B004EPYZIU,"My kids and I watched this over and over after it was on TV last year (2010)!  It is just really adorable and it will definitely be one we watch every year!  I wish it was a little longer, but no complaints here... it is really really cute.  Definitely buying this one!!!  So glad they are putting it out on DVD. :)",1320624000,,315,4.032258064516129
4339184,5,B004EPYZIU,"This is really the best new Christmas short to come out in a long time. We rank it right up there with ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" and ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas."" One of the directors is from my hometown and the movie is full of little homages to our community. Like other reviewers here, I know people who still have this film in their DVR because their kids just can't stop watching it. We had the good fortune to see the upcoming sequel while on a Disney cruise recently, introduced by the directors. It will be another hit! I plan on getting this DVD and including it in our list of must-watch Christmas videos.",1320364800,,621,4.408695652173913

In 2010 I bought a TIVO but couldn't get it programmed with my MAC system in time. I was crushed!!! SO I AM SO EXCITED TO SEE THIS ON DVD.  Just read online that it is supposed to be released on BLU-RAY 3D, BLUE RAY and regular DVD.  By the way there is a NEW HALF-HOUR Prep and Landing special this season (2011) ""Naughty and Nice"" Can't wait!...and Hallmark ornaments, too!",1320192000,,488,4.236559139784946
4339186,5,B004EPYZIU,"I've been waiting for this to come out on DVD! This original new holiday special is a must-see. We always see the elves that make presents, but never hear the stories of the other elves that work behind the scenes to make Christmas possible.  Big or small, each one has a purpose. ""Prep and landing"" covers the story of one elf who takes his job for granted and almost ruins Christmas for one child.  I can't wait to add it to my holiday collection!",1319932800,,449,4.333333333333333

4339190,5,B004EPYZIU,"Thank goodness it is coming out on dvd, because now I can take it out of my DVR where it has been for TWO YEARS.
My kids love this!  Before they could talk they would ""ask"" for it -- at any time of year.  It is the go-to show when they are overture, sick, etc.  And, thankfully, it is one of those kids programs that adults never get tired of watching.
It is just plain fun, well-paced, produced well...and tells a good moral story about responsibility.

I love Christmas and this is such a fun new take on it and very spirited. My only wish and disappointment is that it is so short, so I am very excited to see that there will be bonus shorts on the dvd.
This will make my Christmas season so much more enjoyable.",1318550400,12,429,4.0
