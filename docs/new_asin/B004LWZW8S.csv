4408524,1,B004LWZW8S,"Ye Gods, what have we here?

""All men's souls are immortal, but the souls of the righteous are immortal and divine"", declares the frontispiece of Tarsem Singh's new 3D movie, Immortals, quoting Socrates the same way the preface to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conan-the-Barbarian/dp/B00006420U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conan the Barbarian</a>&nbsp;quotes Nietzsche.

Immortality and divinity: I'm not altogether sure what the difference is, and a cursory visit to the Google to get an explanation of Socrates' quote didn't enlighten me. All the same I wonder what the father of philosophers would have made of this film. I doubt he would have thought it immortal, much less divine. He may have asked someone to pass the hemlock. In any case Singh's metaphysics seem to halt at the frontispiece and, so one is obliged to draw succour from other quarters.

By the law of unintended consequences there were some:  For example, there is the lesson ""it is all relative"". Until today, I thought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Airbender/dp/B003L772E6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Airbender</a>&nbsp;was an irredeemably poor film; I left this one asking my editor whether I could upgrade its rating so I could make room for this one at the bottom of the heap. At least Airbender was funny. OK; not intentionally, but if you've contracted to sit still in the dark for two hours, you must take you pleasures wherever you may find them. Pleasures were few and far between for the one hour, 50 minutes of Immortals.

Immortals isn't funny, accidentally or on purpose. Nor is it divine, and I doubt it will be immortal, whatever Socrates might have said. Interminable is more like it.

I have absolutely no idea who Singh thinks the target market is: it has enough gore, blood, guts and the odd silhouetted breast to vouchsafe itself an adult rating.  But its script, screenplay and acting would test the patience of a ten-year-old. Unless you count Minotaurs unexpectedly throwing axes at you in 3D as dramatic suspense, there is little in the way of drama or suspense. (Oh, for the horny Minotaur from Danny McBride's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Your-Highness/dp/B005BZQS1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Your Highness</a>). There is, on the other hand, lots of violence. Wet, bloody, gory violence. Well edited, perhaps,  but ultimately juvenile: the fight sequences just go on and on. When you've seen one slo-mo airborne, camera orbiting, blood-spurting warrior decapitation, you've seen them all. I've recently watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300/dp/B000VUVG3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300</a>, so I've seen plenty. Speaking of 300, that is another stylish but empty film rendered retrospectively outstanding by comparison to this one. Gerard Butler's Leonidas is a vastly superior hero to Henry Cavill's effete and heavily derived Theseus.

It is not only the cast of extras who are unceremoniously butchered. Greek mythology takes a rare old pasting too. Theseus is now a bastard son of a peasant, rather than being co-fathered by King Aegeus and Poseidon. Indeed, Poseidon, in this movie doesn't seem to be ""into"" girls at all, if you catch my drift - nor, for that matter, are any of the five (yes, five) Olympian Gods. Hyperion (an effectively nasty, if precariously type-cast, Mickey Rourke) isn't a Titan but an invading king seeking to free the Titans from their prison in Mount Tartarus with the aid of an entirely made-up ""bow of Epirus"" (but why? Search me). Theseus, en route to save the day, is chased by a minotauresque warrior, rather than the other way around. And so it goes on. Some clairvoyant virgin Sybils are also involved, who seem to owe as much to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Minority-Report/dp/B0000DK4QJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Minority Report</a>&nbsp;as they do to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robert-Graves/dp/0241952743/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robert Graves</a>, but really only to provide Theseus with a bit of skirt (Freida Pinto's Phaedra - whom in mythology tells us was in fact Theseus' bit of skirt, but wasn't a Sibyl).

Ahhhhh: there it is: There's a connection between Immortals and Airbender. To quote Rolf Harris: Can you see what it is yet? Clue:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Danny-Boyle/dp/B001JJBC5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Danny Boyle</a>.

Immortals, to this viewer, also had the misfortune to be screening just 48 hours after a genuinely intense, real-life battle of the titans, for the Rugby World Cup, screened on free-to-air on ITV. Some of the fight scenes seemed reminiscent, only not quite as intense as the contest between France and New Zealand at the breakdown. Piri Weepu: Now there would have been a good Theseus.

So where does this leave us? In a bad place. Looking desperately for flashes of gauche humour to propel this into Ed Woodian uplands of unintended greatness. There aren't many. The screenplay is largely woeful (credited to the appropriately Hellenic sounding Parlapanides brothers, one of whose industry experience to date seems to have peaked at ""assistant to [producer] Mr Scott Rudin"". Isn't that the one that gets sent out for twinkies at three in the morning on location in Reykjavik?).

Interestingly the cod heroics down on Tartarus are interspersed with ""back at the castle"" scenes amongst (five of) the Gods on Mount Olympus which may have been scripted and wardrobed by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sticky-Moments/dp/B00008T3FF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sticky Moments</a>-era Julian Clary - look, I realise ancient Athenian warrior clobber has its effeminate aspects but you have to at least try to be manly with it.

There is one tremendous Tableau: the titans (in their cage twelve in number but when they escape, multiplying to thirty or forty) are imprisoned in Mount Tartarus under a dome modelled on Rome's real Pantheon, mounted atop some heroic colossi, linking arms (rather, I thought, like an All Black front row). That was a nice bit of e-production design. But nowhere near enough to save this absolute stinker of a film.

The most worrisome aspect is the introduction, at the death, of Acamas, Theseus's son, meaning someone at Universal in the script vetting department failed to veto the idea that there should be a sequel.

God(s) forbid.

4408640,2,B004LWZW8S,"If you enjoyed Clash of the Titans (either the 1981 or 2010 version) or Wrath of the Titans, know that Immortals is a much darker take on a gods-and-men saga  both literally and figuratively. The dark sets certainly complement the grim plot, though the gray and black hues also make the sets look contrived and claustrophobic. Even the most sweeping scenes lack grandeur, even in 3D on a 60"" television. The equally bleak plot puts this movie next to 300 in tone, and while I don't judge a movie simply because it wasn't what I expected, Immortals is just not as enjoyable as its classmates. The 3D is well-done  certainly better than the 2010 Clash of the Titans  but realistic rather than dramatic. If you don't already own them, buy Clash and Wrath first, and only look toward Immortals if you don't mind a dark twist to your Greek mythology.",1522108800,2,845,4.62

According to the film, it is 1228 BCE (which not mentioned in the film was about the time of the exodus of the Israelites from Egyptian slavery). There were wars between the gods before humans and animals were created. The winners were gods. The losers were titans, who were imprisoned. Then humans were created. But a man was born who wanted to end the reign of the gods because the gods did not help his family in the past, when they needed help. His name was Hyperion. At the same time, another man was born, a peasant, whose name was Theseus. Theseus did not believe that gods exist. He is the hero, while Hyperion is the villain. Hyperion wants to get ahold of a magic bow that can cause all kinds of destruction.
There is a beautiful virgin oracle involved who loses all her power if she loses her virginity. She is attracted to Theseus and he to her.

4409059,1,B004LWZW8S,"Wow...what a waste of celluloid (or whatever they record it on...) -- I purchased this movie because it was ""said"" to be good but it was sheer torture. The script is just beyond bad -- seriously...did they develop anything in it except the bad guy (but only superficially). The script was stupid. It pains me to even review it but...if it STOPS you from wasting any time or money on this, then it has done its job.

With the lack of staging areas for the film, you wonder what the budget was. I can't think it was much. They relied on hype. You cannot even compare it to 300. That movie had heart, and depth, forethought, a good script, many good characters, and you found yourself ""in"" the film, rooting them on. You STILL recall the names of people from that film. And, you'd probably see it again. NONE of that can be said about this film.

OK....Mickey Rourke is the bad guy. I get it...he's bad. Did you have to rake us over the coals showing us time-after-time that he was cruel, evil, heartless...but really...WHAT motivated him except that he was bad? Why kill women? Why all the seemingly pointless violence? Oh yeah...you wanted to show that he was bad, right?

Now...here's what not paying attention to detail gets you. The bad guys slaughter the cliff-dwelling villagers. They go repeatedly even out of their way to show us the cliff-like stage. So, how are they slaughtered, not even seeing the bad guys approaching? And these guys come back to this area several times during the film. EACH time it is a surprise to the good guys. Finally, they are gone from the slaughter site for a little while -- like days, not hours. But when they come back, the bodies are ""pristine"", as in no vultures or crows have come by to feast.

There is so much more BAD to say about this...including ONE gratuitous rear nudity and sexual positioning. It could have been handled differently, and much more tastefully. But why have taste? This whole movie showed a LACK of it.

I didn't see ONE redeeming point for this movie. I am well aware that Mickey Rourke can play a villain. I wish he would have passed on this script.

And the immortals themselves...what a bunch of louses -- pretty boy wimps in many ways. Very little in character. But they can wear gold...",1489449600,,2258,4.5492610837438425

4409195,4,B004LWZW8S,"If there's one thing Mickey Roarke can play well, that's a sleaze.  As King Hyperion he is on a quest to destroy pretty much anything that gets in his way and that includes EVERYBODY.  Enter Theseus (Henry Cavill), a young man chosen by Zeus (Luke Evans) to take Hyperion on.

The movie revolves around the Epirus Bow, a bow which allows the wielder unlimited power.  Hyperion wants it in order to conquer the world.  Obviously the battle is there.  If you've watched any of the other ""ancient Greek"" movies, 300 (which I enjoyed), Troy (which went on far too long), Clash of the Titans (which this is sort of an ""after that movie""), you'll get the gist of what this is.

Special effects are all over the place as well as a boatload of CGI.  Luckily, none of that really gets in the way as it does with some movies.  If you're looking for ""Saturday afternoon entertainment"", look no more.  It's obvious you've read this much so you are interested in this type of flick.

4409305,3,B004LWZW8S,"I appreciate the acting of all the important characters in the movie and agree with other reviewrs that King Hyperion is a very impressive role.

Other than that, the movie leaves me a bouch of open quesitons, such as:

When Zeus and his troop (a troop of 5 by the way) finally come down to fight with the Titans, several questions come to my mind:

- Although not very familiar with the Greek mythology I'm pretty sure Titans are Giants, not goblins.  When the titans flushed to the immortals I felt I was watching the evil dwarfs in the underground city in Lord of the Ring.

- In my poor imagination immortals are born with strong super natural powers....but the gods in the movie fight with sword and spear, and, ur, chains.  When they were killed one by one I came up with the impulse to call Captain America and his crew for rescue.

Other questions about the movie include:

- Apolo is the god of Sun.  After his death (assuming he is one of the 5) , who's going to drive the Sun the next day?  Same quesitons with other gods sacrified in the battle.

- King Hyperion plans to use Titans to defeat his enemies.  Has he ever thought about how to control (or have deals with) the ferocious barbarians so that he and his men don't get attacked?  Has he prepared a translator for negotiation?  After all, chances are Titians speak Titian-ish not Greek/human language.

All in all, good actors & actress and good visual effects.  Costumes of the gods and goddess are outstanding.",1477008000,,1481,4.49063670411985

I even enjoyed the vision he had in Mirror Mirror, but somehow something was quite astray in this telling of the story of Theseus. I can't help but feel in the watching of this film that much of the story that would have made it better was left on the cutting room floor. With the richness of Singh's other offerings, and the decided plagiaristic visual feel (Snyder's 300) vying for competition, one is left to assume that there was a battle of visions between director and studio.

4409987,1,B004LWZW8S,"This is the most gratuitously violent movie I have ever seen; the military battles were not historic or in any sense realistic, but rather a senseless blood bath of pagan myth and deubachery.

I am a fan of history and military battles but I grosly misjudged this sick excuse of a narrative. It seems Satan himself was the producer of this film, hence all the dark symbolism.
May the Lord have mercy on all who make the grave error of enduring this bloody picture.
Thesius is not your savior. The Living God, the Lord Jesus Christ is your Saviour. He alone is the one who became a man and died for the sins of the world, rising from the dead to proclaim his perfect sacrifice and His eternal Lordship. We all need His mercy and Grace for eternal salvation. (John 3:16,36 John 14:6-9)

Since ancient Greece is the theme of this movie, I will present you with the oldest known creed of the Christian church which even atheist scholars agree was formulated within 6 months to a year after the cross of Christ and His resurrection.  This fact eliminates the formation of legend or myth which culminate over centuries. The New Testament boasts 5,800 Greek, 30,000+ total manuscript copies, the gospels being recorded while many witnesses still lived. In contrast Platos works and Socrates were recorded 1300+ years their deaths. The bible is the most reliable ancient book ever recorded.

This original Greek christian creed proclaims the death, deity and resurrection of Christ. God bless.

1 Corinthians 15:3-6 KJV
[3] For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; [4] And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: [5] And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: [6] After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.",1454284800,,1941,4.680351906158358

A ruthless King leads a giant army across the lands to release the mythical Titans from their bonds so they can destroy the gods. A mortal mentored by Zeus himself is the gods, and mankinds, last hope.

What did I think?

Not even nice special effects can save this bastardization of Greek mythology. The poor quality storyline fails to engage and its hard to care too much about most of the characters. If you just want a series of fight scenes interspersed with some cliched writing then this is fine. If you prefer quality storytelling with your mythology then look elsewhere.",1431043200,,596,4.711538461538462

4410931,1,B004LWZW8S,"I can honestly say this is by far the worst sword and sandal movie I have ever seen. This movie has characters named after famous mythological figures but they bear little resemblance to their mythic counterparts. The protagonist Theseus, is here a peasant whereas in myth he is the son of king Aegeus or in some traditions Poseidon. Ok so I can live with that, the story centers on a certain evil king named Hyperion (in mythology Hyperion is a Titan and is the father of Sun and Moon). He's basically trying to get his hands on a bow, the Epirus bow to be precise (this bow is an invention not taken from myth). Ok, it's clear by now this movie is only loosely based on Greek mythology. Now we all know Theseus is most known for killing the minotaur (part bull part man in myth), in this movie he's just a psycopath with a mask. I guess the minotaur is too fictional, and unrealistic... Oh wait, the movie also features a myriad of anthropomorphic gods, although I think the word god is not appropriate as many of them are dead by the end... not quite immortals after all. This is the worse depiction of the Olympic pantheon, heck, the animated gods in Disney's Hercules are far more likeable and far less pitiful, not to mention they are as mortal as you and me, they fight and die gruesome deaths in battle, which is all they do in this movie. And which is basically all there is to this movie. I didn't care for any of the characters by the end and was anxiously expecting the end credits. On a scale of 1-10 I'd have to give it a -7 unfortunately no negative ratings available. Please save yourself the time and money. Avoid this mindless travesty of a movie.",1427932800,,1665,4.391585760517799

On the other hand something seems to be amiss, but I can't put my finger on it, what it is. So I'm torn between three or five stars. I mean the cast tries it's best to flesh out the charachters, but maybe the reason why I love this film is also the reason why I couldn't give it a five star review.

The movie is based on Greek myth character Theseus (Henry Cavill) and his fight against a ruthless king named Hyperion (Mickey Rourke). Unlike 300 this movie is about men and how they forge their own destinies during the twilight of the Greek gods.

It is visually stunning and has great cinematography and the fight sequences are one of the best. This movie is grander in scale compared to 300 which features more settings giving each major scene a nice ambiance and impact.

The acting is third rate at times and much of the supporting characters are played well enough to keep the mood simple and consistent throughout.",1424131200,,882,4.5

4411445,4,B004LWZW8S,"Immortals
 I expected to see a bloody re-hash of 300, a recent film about the heroic defense of Thermopile by the Spartans done by this same production team but I was only half right.  Well, pretty good for me to have even that much right.  300 was nothing if not visually stunning, technically innovative and very very bloody.  Immortals is visually stunning, very bloody and instead of innovation in the science of movie making, we are pleased to receive a delicious eye and mind delight in the set production.  The sets are very stark, very modern seeming but simultaneously beautiful and thought provoking.  Smart people made this film to delight and dazzle us and they succeeded.
 The script is a mishmash of Greek myths.  We have the conflict between Theseus and the Minotaur even including the maze.  There is visual reference to the sad fate of Prometheus, who as you remember, ended life chained to a rock for eternity, waking every morning whole only to have his liver torn out each day by a hungry, savage eagle.  Nice tales the Greeks gave us.  And there is the main theme, the struggle between the Gods and the Titans, a battle we still celebrate in the names of our high school sports teams.  Oh, don't forget the Sibyl, the haunted woman who can commune with the eternal so long as she remains virgin.
 The gorgeous Freda Pinto is the Sibyl.  She played the love interest in Slum Dog Millionaire.  She is the love interest of the hero Theseus here and loses her powers when she succumbs to his romantic power in a tasteful if very realistic love scene.  The hero, and her lover, is played by Henry Cavill, soon to be our next screen Superman.  The heavy, a very mean homicidal maniac, is well and truly played by Mickey Rourke who seems to making a career of playing people so vile that he doesnt need to do any actual acting, just do vile things.  In this case, he is a wanton murderer who rules by terror.  He has one captive emasculated by means of a huge maul in a sequence that caused moans to be emitted by the male audience members.
 The Gods make periodic entrees into the story.  We usually think of them as being older and wiser versions of ourselves.  Zeus is usually shown as a white bearded elder statesman among middle aged, if well preserved, peers.  Here, Aries, Poseidon and
Athena are all played by attractive actors in their mid twenties.  This whim of director Tarsem Singh makes sense.  If one has the power to be immortal why not be immortal, youthful and beautiful at once?  Tarsem Singh is three times out with Immortals and will be in demand in the future.  Perhaps it is his Indian upbringing that gives him what seems to us to be a fresh and exciting vision of movie making.
 The film is rightly rated R and not just for the afore mentioned graphic love scene.  This is a very violent film.  People, Gods and Titans are stabbed, mashed and slaughtered with extravagance and in intense slow mo shots that leave us cringing.  If you can take that, this is a very interesting, well done film, sort of a Greek fantasy splatter fest with beautiful actors in a visually compelling landscape.  It is a fable, a tale in the grand Greek tradition.  It began to make sense to me only after I thought of it as a visualizing of some grand Greek epic tale.  And on that level, it works.  Three saw blades go to this $75 million bet on the blood lust of the viewing public.  With a solid $32 million in the first Friday to Sunday weekend, the producers should be pleased in their trust in director Tarsem Singh.",1416182400,,3539,4.5007849293563575

4411771,5,B004LWZW8S,"This an excellent movie if you are a fan of mythology or any of the previous movies about it. Neither my wife or I are fans of Mickey Rourke and yet we both enjoyed this movie a lot. What I really like about this film is its depiction of the separation of power between, men, gods and Zeus himself. The action is non-stop and there is no confusion or gray area between the good guys and the bad guys. This film also addresses the age old question that always comes up during wartime: At what point is negotiation no longer an acceptable recourse. Another point which this film addresses is two people born into the same circumstances can still chose different roads in life.  Even if you do not like mythology at all, but you are a fan of action movies. You will want to make this a part of your collection. Henry Cavill keeps showing up on my movie list, 2002 The Count of Monte Crisco, 2012 The Cold Light od Day, 2013 Superman and he has two more future projects that I hope to see (2015 The Man From UNCLE & 2016 Batman v. Superman). Frieda Pinto also does a good job and is a rising star having also appeared in Slumdog Millionaire and Rise of the Planet of the Apes.

4411977,5,B004LWZW8S,"This review concerns the 3D blu-ray, not the movie as a whole.

This film is a visual feast, with a highly-composed look that I felt served the story well.  The use of 3D was effective and not distracting.  Not much in the way of out-of-screen effects, which I think should be used sparingly.  Many shots featured sweeping vistas, the depth and scale of which was effectively enhanced.  I noticed minor double-images on only a couple occasions.  I had no issues with the way it was mastered, though I've not yet had my TV calibrated (I did use the THX mode).  I didn't use any post-processing, except for motion smoothing.

The style of this film caught my eye during previews of it I'd seen, and the 3D version exceeded my expectations.  This is one of a handful of titles I plan to use to showcase my home theater.

Mysterious oracle Phaedra [Freida Pinto] lends a supernatural helping hand in this colorful epic, narrated by a crusty John Hurt [isn't he always?]. Swordplay, cataclysmic earth movements, tsunamis....there's a little bit of everything going on here, including Cavill's incredible abs, which probably figured in his being picked to play the latest incarnation of Superman. An eyeful!",1396742400,,728,5.813084112149533
4412047,3,B004LWZW8S,"What would happen if ""Clash of the Titans"" had a baby with ""300""?

Well, it might be something like ""Immortals,"" a very loose retelling of the story of Theseus -- but with lots of godly angst from on high, and everything filmed in a bronzed sweaty style. Tarsem brings splashes of his own colorful, dramatic style to this tale, but he's hamstrung by a plodding, gruesome script.

The cruel king Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) wants to find the Epirus Bow, the only item which can slay the immortal gods and free the brutal Titans. To find it, he tortures priests and captures the virgin oracle Phaedra (Freida Pinto), in hopes that she can lead him to the bow.

A young man named Theseus (Henry Cavill) lives with his mother at an isolated village, being taught how to fight by a weird old man (John Hurt), who is quickly revealed to actually be Zeus in disguise (Luke Evans). The law of the gods demands that they not interfere in mortal affairs (how true to Greek mythology!), and Zeus is determined to keep it that way.

But when Theseus is captured and enslaved by Hyperion's army, he is able to escape with Phaedra -- and in short order, he conveniently finds the Epirus Bow. But Hyperion is clever enough to snatch the bow away from them, and unless Theseus can rally the Hellenic armies, the Titans will be unleashed to destroy the entire world...

Tarsem is probably the most visually arresting director of our times. He has a flawless sense for bright colors, exotic designs, and sweeping fantastical visuals that seem to be from another world. Sure, the entire movie has that bronzed metallic sheen that ""300"" made famous, but it also has the oddly modern Olympus, the scarlet robes of the oracle, the cliffside village... visually speaking, it's gorgeous.

But he seems to have a knack for choosing movies that simply don't live up to his visuals -- in every movie of his that I have seen, the writing is what lets the movie down. And that is the problem with ""Immortals"" -- the story just sort of lurches and plods along, tangled in never-answered questions (why can't the gods interfere? Why is Zeus allowed to rape mortal women if interference be bad?). It never builds up a sense of momentum until the climactic battle.

And there's really just a grimy sense of ugliness to the movie. Castration, tongues cut out, people being steamed alive, and the relentless vileness of Hyperion's army -- I'm not opposed to a little wanton violence, but the ugliness starts to wear on the nerves.

But the actors, overall, do excellent jobs -- Cavill has a powerful presence as a noble if embittered young hero, and Pinto gives a beautifully evanescent performance as a young girl cursed with terrible visions. Hurt and Evans give an excellent double performance as Zeus, showing him both as a kindly old mentor and as a vibrant young god-king.

As for Rourke, he is absolutely bloodcurdling as Hyperion, coldly and casually spreading chaos across Greece. He's suffered a personal tragedy, so now he spreads death and horror to everyone he touches, raping and torturing in a quiet, philosophical manner.

""Immortals"" is graced with exquisite visuals and some excellent acting, but the story just plods along and leaves you feeling dirty after awhile. At least it's better than ""Clash of the Titans.""",1396569600,11,3295,4.775043936731107

This movie  does have a great caste, with Mickey Rourke playing the vicious power hungry King Hyperion.  This mythological story is about the conflict between good and evil, which of course is an important part of any action movie.  King Hyperion is the insane and obviously totally evil person,  played perfectly by Rourke,  in this film. The mythic Gods have chosen Theseus (Henry Cavill) a common villager, but also a brave warrior, to lead the fight against the lunatic King Hyperion, whose desire is to rule the world.

Even though the Gods wanted to stay out of the battle and desire Theseus to beat the King; nevertheless, in the end they wind up helping Theseus finally destroy the evil King Hyperion and his followers.

In conclusion, this is a fair story and it does have some great action scenes, but in my opinion it does not compare to the great movie ""300.""

Henry Cavill was the reason I purchased this film. I thoroughly enjoyed his performance in ""Man of Steel"" and wanted to see more from this fine actor. I was not disappointed with his efforts. Mickey Rourke's character seemed to be a retread of his ""Ironman II"" performance as Whiplash. The film, in general, is a bit depressing. As I said, you might like it.

I loved the performances of Henry Cavill as Theseus, Stephen Dorff as Stavros, Luke Evans as Zeus, and Peter Stebbings as Helios. The visuals were interesting to look at, and I really like Greek mythology so the story concept interested me. But the story lacks great execution, character arcs feel incomplete, and some of the other actors were forgettable.

Frieda Pinto as the Oracle Phaedra was okay. The actors playing the other Greek gods were okay as well but felt and acted a bit too young to be taken seriously. But Mickey Rourke as King Hyperion did nothing for me; too much mumbling made him hard to understand at times.

It also felt like the film didn't really allow Theseus to earn the ending the film gave him. And his fight with the Minotaur was the one action piece that was a letdown for me.

With that in mind, I was not necessarily disappointed when I finally say the movie. Immortals is a simple, forgettable action flick that happens to be set in ancient Greece. With a weak, sometimes presumptuous storyline, and characters that are thrown in seemingly at random, it certainly won't win any awards for writing, nor for acting, though Henry Cavill and Mickey Rourke give convincing performances as the film's hero and villain. Visually, the movie is beautiful; the settings are epic, the CGI is very good, and all the actors and actresses are gorgeous. The action is corny, but well done. The film's style also deserves a nod; it's reminiscent of 300, but brighter and slicker. But its style can't make up for all its flaws. While watching it, I wondered if the producers chose the actors based on physical attractiveness alone.

4413064,3,B004LWZW8S,"Long ago, a battle raged in the heavens. The victors took the name of the gods, and cast the defeated titans down into an earthly prison for all eternity. Now, the vengeful King Hyperion looks to find the weapon of the gods in order to free the titans and wage war against all humanity! Our only hope lies in a young warrior, who must rise up to lead the Hellenes against the armies of Hyperion. Tarsem Singh delivers another stunning visual experience that owes as much to Zack Snyder's 300 as it does to the Neoclassical paintings of Jacques-Louis David, contrasting its vibrant colors and surreal landscapes against the bloody violence. For all of the incredible style seen in IMMORTALS, however, it is mostly devoid of character and emotion, streamlining the plot in a rush to reach the over-budgeted action sequences. As truly awesome as these scenes may be, they are spread far too thin, and the final battle lacks the epic scale promised by the opening act. Henry Cavill plays a competent hero alongside another wildly over-the-top performance by Mickey Rourke as the sinister Hyperion. IMMORTALS packs enough mind-blowing imagery and memorable movie moments to win over fans of 300.

4413065,1,B004LWZW8S,"Too dark on the visuals, plot holes, uninteresting characters and most of all . . The Titans!
If anyone has read anything about or seen movies that involved Mythology or even played God of War ( 1, 2 or 3 ) that had loose but considerably more accurate accounts of what Titans were. .  This was clearly some attempt to pass off some . . Well I have to be nice here.  To say that some of the battle scenes were ok is one thing but, the story as a whole just left me not really caring how this ended.  Clash of the Titans (Original) circa 1981- Medusa, Release the Kraken!  Again . . These original movies I may have to keep making reference to may be low tech as far as CG 2013 filmation goes but when movies like this drop the ball like this I have no choice.  It may be just me but I think Titans were more creature based and sometimes Giants . . Not Dirty Soldiers with bad skin rashes that looked like they were in need of soap an water.  Sad .. Just Sad.

If you're looking for something to watch with a lot of action, but not have to think too hard about story or characters, then `Immortals' checks all the right boxes; it's here to wow you with beautiful visuals, hot bodies and brutally visceral action, but becomes as clichd as it gets when slowing down for `character' moments. The details that went into designing the looks, costumes and sets are impressive, but the acting feels serviceable and dialogue a little wooden. I mean that speech Theseus gave, that was suppose to rouse the troops, felt flat in delivery and was nowhere near as inciting as King Leonidas's `We are Spartans' bellow in `300'. `Immortals' is still pretty good for a night-in of mindless violence, but I say watch it first before you decide to commit to having it on your shelf.

Special features include `It's No Myth', a short doco with mythology experts talking about the evolution of Greek mythology. Deleted scenes, one or two of which I felt could've given the film a bit more depth, and the Theatrical trailer.",1350691200,,1347,4.801724137931035
4413523,2,B004LWZW8S,"If you've skipped the movie description entirely, here's a quick rundown of Immortals:

King Hyperion, a bloodthirsty warlord, is on a quest to find the Epirus Bow, a mythical item that will allow one to ""wage war on Heaven and Earth"". He has set his sights on Tartarus, in order to free the imprisioned Titans and let them destroy the gods as punishment for them failing to save his family. Theseus, our young protagonist, holds a grudge against the king for killing his mother, and is thusly out for revenge. Along the way a ragtag group of heroes is formed, made up of Theseus, escaped slaves, and an Oracle who Hyperion seeks so he may find the location of the bow.

I, as a lover of mythology, thought it was going to be a wonderful adventerous romp that at least, y'know, made sense. The title itself is decieving; it had very little to do with the Immortals themselves. Within the first several minutes I was already scratching my head for the film being vague, and a bit...jumpy. Part of my confusion may lay in the fact I was ranting aloud during the film at certain things (for example, why do all of the gods wear ridiculous headgear and dress like they're going to a disco rave?) but I couldn't help myself. The characters go from one location to the next with minimal or no visual travel, and the costumes, which in pieces like this are generally stunning, are lackluster. Espcially disappointing (along with the aforementioned gods' costumes) are the costumes of the Oracle and her three ""sisters"" when they are held captive. They are almost perfect, and a gorgeous shade of crimson to boot. But each outfit is topped up with a ridiculous lampshade looking...thing that absolutely ruins them. This is just my opinion, however, so it doesn't necessarily take away from the overall film.

Another disappointing factor is the Minotaur, or what passes for it at least. When one imagines him, images of a massive, muscled, fearsome creature, part bull and part man come to mind. Here, he is simply a henchman of Hyperion clad in a barbed bull shaped helmet, who in my opinion makes a half assed attempt at killing Thesus before being struck down.

The two redeeming moments of this film (and hence why it gets two stars) are the battle scene between the Titans and the Immortals, and the obvious eye candy that is the constantly shirtless Henry Cavill, who aside from being good looking is also a fantastic actor (one need only to watch any season of The Tudors to know this.)

If you're still interested in seeing it, you'd be further ahead to rent it or watch it on Netflix rather than buy it, but keep your expectations low in doing so.",1350172800,2,2648,4.637526652452026
4413524,2,B004LWZW8S,"I see that the reviews on this one are split and I can see why.  I wouldn't give this bloated piece of cinema a 1 star because it is at least sometimes watchable.  But what a grave disappointment it is, especially to those who were hoping to see a movie in the similar vein of ""300"".  They do but it is such a lesser entry in every way...

First, would it hurt them to use daylight that actually looked like daylight or for the screenwriters to come up with more daytime scenes.  This movie was so dark that you just can't see enough of what's happening at times.  Granted, maybe that was a fault of my video quality as I noticed that on the main screen the movie looked better (!) than it did in the actual movie (I've seen this on a few different movies) largely because there was more light!  Please, people!  In an action movie let us see the action!

Second, the story overall is very simple but the execution seemed to try to make it confusing.  Story = evil man with a grudge against the gods is making war with Greece and conquering them and is set to loose the Titans so that they can kill the Olympians; hero, and a small band of unlikely allies, opposes and stops him.  With characters that you can't see clearly half the time trying to give you backstory to make the main story seem more significant, referencing people that you never see and history that is only tangentially related, and you wondering who is saying what leaves the viewer not really caring at some point.

Third, (a purely subjective point on my part) it took me out of the movie as I watched the hero use jiu jitsu on a ton of enemies.  I like watching this kind of stuff but I'm just saying...it took me out of it.

If there is a redeeming portion of the movie it was in the brutal, bloody, and slow-motion cool fight between the Olympians and Titans.  As another reviewer marked, there was a lot of style there.  The fey looking Olympians (Zeus looks like Orlando Bloom) didn't look a match for the burnt embers of hominid forms that were the Titans but they sure laid a smackdown on them.

My final word?  If you haven't already seen ""Immortals"" but are really interested in it then, for your own sake, go in with very low expectations.  That way you might kind of like it.",1349740800,,2258,4.320665083135392

4413530,2,B004LWZW8S,"Tarsem Singh is a filmmaker who honestly should have stayed a music video director. Seeing his finest work, the video for R.E.M's ""Losing My Religion"" and what a breathtaking visual work it is, it does seem like the next natural step for him would be breaking into feature filmmaking. He started out with THE CELL, the Jennifer Lopez ""psychic thriller"", that was very reliant on strange visuals and heavy use of color rather than the focus on the story or character or performances, all of which were totally forgettable. More recently, he did THE FALL, which was more acclaimed but still had similar complaints. Now Singh tackles Greek mythology with the same casual aplomb for character and momentum and performance and concentrates entirely on constructing visual beauty with IMMORTALS, which while being a feast for the eyes, totally forgets that we have other senses.

It's very telling that this is a film being marketed toward Zack Snyder's 300 crowd while totally side-stepping the brash fun and glorious bloodletting that made that film the hit it was. Basically you have the tale of Theseus (Henry Cavill, our future Superman), a Greek peasant who is destined by the gods to protect all of Greece from the brutal King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke, in some inspired casting) who looks to gain possession of the Maguffin... ahem... the Epirus Bow so that he can free The Titans (beings cast down from Mount Olympus when they rebelled against the gods) and destroy pretty much everything. Along the way, he falls in love with the virgin oracle Phaedra (Frieda Pinto) and makes a friend in the thief Stavros (Stephen Dorff) and along the way, he gains the respect and assistance of the gods. Yes, Theseus is THAT important.

Unfortunately, the gods are the most interesting part of the film but they're given the least attention. There are a few fast-slow-fast bloody battle moments, particularly a scene in which one of the gods (it's not clear who it is, but I'm guessing it's either Apollo or Icarus) comes to save Theseus and Stavros in a particularly brutal fashion and is an extremely well-constructed and designed set piece, and there's also the final battle between the good guys and the bad guys where many characters sacrifice themselves and become legendary heroes in the pantheon of Greek history and blah blah blah.

It's amazing really that most of the films based on or around the gods of Greek mythology have been so incredibly underwhelming. Both CLASH and WRATH OF THE TITANS were gigantic missteps, and IMMORTALS isn't any better. In fact, I haven't seen an action/adventure film recently that bored me to such an extent that I was literally falling asleep while watching it. And it wasn't that late and I wasn't tired. This film is just incredibly boring and the performances are just as wooden as the film. Someone must really see something that I don't see in Henry Cavill to cast him as Clark Kent/Superman in Zack Snyder's forthcoming MAN OF STEEL or really to cast him in anything other than a Calvin Klein ad. He's incredibly handsome, athletic, and chiseled, but nothing about his performance suggests that he's an actor or any considerable weight. Pinto, who has yet to show me anything of real worth, and has been relegated to playing second or third fiddle to better actors and even CG apes, is also nothing special here. Stephen Dorff is trying desperately to show that he can still be relevant, but his rogueish charm does elevate his performance somewhat. Rourke seems as though he's sleepwalking throughout this film until the gloves come off and the action requires his body to do something; his character always speaks in hushed, almost whispered tones that are supposed to indicate that he's a real Hannibal Lecter-type of villain, and it's a shame that such a talented actor is reigned in and not allowed to really sink his teeth into a role like this.

The script by Charles and Vlas Parlapanides (Charles is a former executive assistant to Scott Rudin, and is the only reason I see that he was able to get this script out there) is about as stale, wooden and trite as can be expected from a faux swords-and-sandals actioner. The dialogue is as clunky as anything I've heard lately, but it really doesn't matter because all of the scenes they write are designed to give a backdrop to the visual tapestry that Singh weaves throughout the film. With another film highly dependent of golds and reds, the most dominant colors in his palette, Singh creates some truly beautiful-looking scenes within this film and obviously takes great care in his character design (some of the ornamentation on the characters, particularly the gods, are very inspired), but once again, that's all he brings to it. He brings no real sense of storytelling, pacing or momentum. All he knows how to do is make what we're looking at on screen really pretty, and sadly that will never be enough. To be fair, though, I would rather sit through a film of Singh's than that of a similar quality Michael Bay film, because at least the only style that Singh apes is his own. Again, Singh is far better-suited to the shorter narrative of a music video rather than a feature film because he can show a lot of pretty pictures in a four-minute time frame and doesn't have to worry about a coherent plot or characters.

IMMORTALS is a film that is destined to be praised for its visual flair, reviled for its lack of anything substantial, and unlike the myths that populate this film, will be remembered by only a few.",1347148800,2,5521,4.801261829652997

It worked for me, but fortunately I just rented it. Visually it resembled 300, except the direction was terrible. It went into slow motion at completely ridiculous times, and then sped up and slowed back down like the director was trying to find a certain part of the movie he liked but forgot where it was so he kept fast forwarding it, then slowing it down, then fast forwarding it etc. Not a single actor in this movie came across as sincere, and most were just corny. The plot was really simple and not gripping at all. The action scenes were cool but the complete misuse of slow motion made it impossible to get into it. The gods were all apparently severely mentally retarded and couldn't figure out what was going on, or why they had powers or what they wanted to use them for. They could only use their powers when it didn't really matter, and then when anything of importance happened they had to stay out of it, but never did. Their entire dialogue was so ridiculous that it made everything else in the movie look intelligent and that's saying a lot.

4413635,2,B004LWZW8S,"Tarsem Singh's ""Immortals"" is a Greek mythology-inspired film that is beautiful to look at, but is slow-moving and even dull at times. Set in 1228 B.C., the story is about the ruthless King Hyperion (scenery-chewing Mickey Rourke), who intends to conquer the worlds of both gods and humans by unleashing the ""Titans."" The only person who can stop the brutal king's rampage is a stonemason Theseus (Henry Cavill), who is also a formidable warrior trained by an old man (John Hurt) since his childhood.

The story is pretty boring and full of plot holes. With its sluggish pace and several unnecessary episodes involving the virgin oracle Phaedra (Freida Pinto) and the ""Epirus Bow"" that only confuse the viewer, ""The Immortals"" is only sporadically entertaining.

""Immortals"" doesn't know its target audience. I don't have an issue with the film's violent content, but as an adventure tale the film takes itself too seriously. As a revenge tale, it lacks credible characters. Also, the film might have taken too much liberty with the Greek mythology. I know the film is not made as educational material, but the idea of Zeus (Luke Evans) strictly forbidding other gods to interfere is something very strange.

""Immortals"" is the third feature film directed by Tarsem Singh (following ""The Cell"" and ""The Fall""). He is generally known for his unique visual styles, which is again one of the assets of ""Immortals."" Oscar-winning designer Eiko Ishioka (who has worked for all the films Tarsem directed, including his latest ""Mirror, Mirror"") provides interesting costumes.

But let's face it. Despite his flair for visual sophistication and impact (see the brilliant scene of the imprisoned Titans, for instance), Tarsem Singh is not the greatest storyteller in the film industry. Combat sequences need better editing that would create a seamless and natural flow of action. As it is, ""Immortals"" is a collection of beautifully crafted bits of footage randomly assembled. ""Immortals"" is visually impressive, but its narrative needs improvement.",1345939200,4,2040,5.248466257668712

You see, this movie is BORING.  It appears that the screenwriters were so convinced of their writing abilities that they thought that we would want to see their characters standing around talking for a couple of hours and doing little else.

Having characters talking a lot is no problem if those characters are interesting and have interesting things to talk about, but that's just it: the storyline was not particularly interesting and the characters were one dimensional, soulless, and bland; combine a bunch of characters that fit that description in the same movie and you essentially have a sleep inducing experience. There was not one character in the whole movie worth caring about not even the main protagonist.  It was a pure case of viewer indifference on my part; didn't care if the good guy or the bad guy won or lost, lived or died.  I kept checking my clock as I waited. . . .and waited. . .and waited for something big to happen in this film and it never did.

The movie should have been about a half hour shorter, and instead of taking itself so seriously, it should have been a stylish, wall-to-wall action and visual extravaganza.

However, a movie cannot stand on art alone; it's a medium that requires a story.  (I do wish filmmakers would stop pouring all their funds into the look of a movie, leaving a nickel leftover for the screenplay.)  The story is simple and to the point: a bad guy wants a magical bow, said bow in easily found and just as quickly lost to the bad guy who uses the aforementioned bow to release a cage full of crazy little Titans.  A brawl ensues, the end.
Okay, a few other hardly worth mentioning things happen in between, but you get the picture (literally).  The story was as bare bones as it gets.  There was no depth, no delving into any aspect of the story, none of the relationships were examined; everything was treated as a set piece.  This was a magical place populated by stick figures made to order.  Few of the actors stood out, which can easily be blamed on the lack of light.  While it is commendable that the filmmakers stayed true to the light sources of the day (candles, oil lamps, and campfires), this method did not make for easy viewing.  Of the cast, only Mickey Rourke left a lasting impression, everyone else's work was cursory at best, and as such easily forgettable.  The problem with this movie is that it lacks heart and soul.

4413708,2,B004LWZW8S,"'""Immortals"" is one of those revisionist films where traditional Greek myth was not Hollywood enough to film as is; instead, because it comes from the same producers who brought us ""300,"" it uses saturated hues, comic book-style special effects, and a whole lot of toned stunt men to try to make up for the lack of plot.  It doesn't work.

Theseus (Henry Cavill) is a typical working class guy, a ferocious fighter who is uninterested in doing his civic duty as a guard.  Theseus' mom Aethra (Anne Day-Jones) is slaughtered by rampaging megalomaniac Hyperion (Mickey Rourke, chewing scenery). Hyperion is hell-bent on releasing the titans to punish the gods for allowing his wife to die, and he will stop at nothing to find the virgin oracle who can find the artifact of their destruction. Well, Theseus isn't the forgiving kind either and plots his own vengeance.  Nobody messes with Theseus' mom.

What ensues is a race first for the oracle Phaedra (Freida Pinto) and then for the Bow of Epirus, or something like that. Theseus is unwillingly dragged into the fight by the gods themselves, all sporting distinctive headdresses but rarely introduced by name (is that Hermes? Ares? Some guy with spiky headware?). The special effects are reserved for these interventions, which manifest primarily as slow-motion capture sequences: Poseidon launching a tidal wave, Ares killing people, etc. It's like ""The Matrix"" for Greek myth.

It turns out the Epirus Bow is pretty much just laying around, which is how Theseus manages to find it when he's burying his poor unavenged mother. Then a guy in a bull's head helmet shows up (Robert Maillett) called the Minotaur.  If you paid attention in class you'll remember that in Greek myth Theseus killed the Minotaur.  See what they did there?  ""Immortals"" is Greek myth with less special effects.

Hyperion eventually manages to get the Bow, which is a weapon of mass destruction. Theseus tries to warn the Hellenic King Cassander (Stephen McHattie) but of course he doesn't listen, instead relying on his massive wall to protect his people.  It's no match for the Bow, and it's not long before Hyperion stomps his way through the Hellenics on his way to assault Mount Tartarus where the titans are imprisoned.

SPOILER: The titans are released. The gods show up, led by Zeus (Luke Evans) to do battle.  The titans consist of Underwear Models # 1 through 25, covered in body paint, mugging for the camera, and acting more like a bunch of savages than the progenitors of the gods.  They're the equivalent of thugs and ninjas in action movies, there only to allow the gods to show off how awesome they are.

""Immortals"" is a low-budget film that hopes you don't remember your Greek mythology. For those of us who do, it's hard not to feel embarrassed for director Tarsem Singh.",1343174400,3,2815,4.8844537815126055

4413941,2,B004LWZW8S,"One year after Clash of the Titans and Hollywood is at full throttle cranking out action movies set in mythological Greece and before.  2011 saw the release of a remake of Conan, and this film by Indian director Tarsem Singh.  The movie follows the life of Theseus, a mortal man favored by the gods, as he leads the resistance against evil king Hyperion who is intent on freeing the Titans upon Earth.  First of, this movie bears no resemblance to the Greek myths surrounding the main character.  For those who don't know, the mythical Theseus was known for slaying the Minotaur.  No Minotaur in this movie.  However, there is a lot of bloody, gory action with swords, pikes, arrows and other weapons of hand-to-hand combat.  Some of it looks authentic but most of it looks overly choreographed.  Like just about every other Hollywood creation about ancient times, most of the key characters are played by actors and actresses from former colonies of Britain.  Is it too much to ask for Greek actors and actresses to play some of the roles?  Maybe it is.  The redeeming feature of the movie was its incredible use of colors to create an environment that looked both mythical yet fantastic at the same time.  Whether it was the grayish titans fighting the white-clothed gods amongst the brownish interior of Mount Tartarus, or the dresses of the Oracles, Tarsem Singh always delivers a visual spectacle regardless of what is happening on-screen.  For sure the cinematography looked much more realistic and plausible than in the film 300.

4414099,5,B004LWZW8S,"""300"" was quite a spectacle as it combined fantastic special effects with a Roman theme along with great action sequences. Continuing this trend is ""Immortals"" where King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke, ""The Wrestler"" & ""Iron Man 2"") wants to find a weapon called the Epirius Bow so he can wage a titanic war on both Heaven and Earth. The gods want to stop him and call upon a young man named Theseus (Henry Cavill TV's ""The Tudors"") to stop him and a beautiful woman named Phaedra (Freida Pinto, ""Slumdog Millionaire) helps him in his quest.

The story while basic is quite good, the acting is decent to good, Rourke is especially evil as Hyperion, Cavill is the typical young hero and Pinto is just stunning as the Oracle. However the main drawing point of this movie is the great fight sequences and visuals that make this film a joy to view especially in Blu-Ray. Its not quite as good as ""300"" as that was a joy from start to finish but Immortals does have a grand scope about it and is so so much better than the lousy remake of ""Clash of the Titans"". ***1/2 out of 4 stars.",1339891200,,1073,4.41919191919192

4414101,3,B004LWZW8S,"Vibrant visuals are the focus of this movie and like a lot of blockbuster films the story takes a back seat because who cares about plotting if you can bedazzle your audience? The cliff side settlements are something to behold and for those who want a feast for the eyes this is justifiably worth your money and time. Additionally, the costumes are noticeably impressive.

Mickey Rourke does an admirable job as a brutal yet sometimes poetic villain (Hyperion). Several of the supporting cast are barely mediocre. Other actors I recognized were Stephen Dorff (the sarcastic rogue), Freida Pinto (as the oracle), Henry Cavill (Theseus), Isabel Lucas (Athena), and, of course, John Hurt (the old mentor to Theseus).

When the Gods and Titans went at it I expected huge special effects which would make a 60th level World of Warcraft player feel jealous. Instead, I got a fight that was pretty basic which made me wonder if they just ran out of money. The Titans were wussbags and nothing like in the legends. Part of the reason they were entrapped was because it was impossible to kill them (well, most of the time) or they were kin and it was very bad to kill your family. In the movie they were just barbaric savages that were easily tossed aside (until the latter part of the fight when the movie creators figured they should make it challenging) and I wondered why the Greek Gods bothered entrapping them in the first place. Why not just kill them?

The fight between Theseus and the Minotaur started with promise and then it ended in a manner which made me feel the big bad Minotaur of legends was a total wussbag.

** SPOILERS BEGIN ***

GREEK MYTHOLOGY ERRORS/OR JUST OFF:

(1) There were actually 12 Titans, not 20, if we're talking about the first generation. If you include the second generation then it's okay, I suppose.; (2) There was no such thing as the Epirus Bow in Greek Mythology. Strange that they didn't just tap into the mythology and use the Bow of Hercules. Then again, I believe Theseus never was known for using a bow so much as a special blade; (3) Theseus and Hyperion never fought it out. Hyperion is hardly mentioned in the mythologies; (4) Theseus never fought any army unless you include the Amazons; (5) Theseus' mother was the daughter of a  king so she was never a peasant so all the ridicule would have never happened. I think the creators wanted to create this common man so that audiences would supposedly relate to him more but you have to remember that a lot of the Greek heroes were in the nobility.; (6) Athena never died in Greek Mythology from Titan blows; (7) The Titans never escaped after the first godly battle in great mass though some were released at times and a minority of them didn't participate in the Titanomachy.; (8) The Greek Gods had no problem showing themselves to mortals in their full form. I suppose they put this in to explain why mortals didn't always believe in them and to relate it to the growing atheist crowds in America perhaps?; and (9) Zeus never killed Ares but he probably thought about doing it once or twice in the legends.

GREEK MYTHOLOGY (PARTS THEY GOT RIGHT): (1) the Greek Gods and Titans fought in a ten year war called the Titanomachy; (2) Phaedra was the second wife of Theseus (though not an Oracle and I get they did that to try and make her cooler); (3) the fighting skills of Theseus were legendary. Probably more legendary than in this movie so the creators couldn't have mucked up that one; and (4) Theseus fought and prevailed against the Minotaur.

** SPOILERS END ***

The budget for this picture was estimated at $75M to $120M and it made over $226M at the Box Office. Like I said, sometimes the special effects and a decent to somewhat good story are enough to make it a blockbuster. But, let me say once again, the Minotaur and Titans were wussbags. Really.

4414219,3,B004LWZW8S,"The genre of film known as ""sword and sandal"" has gone up and down over the years. A staple of films in the late 50s and early 60s the genre lost favor when the age of the anti-hero and film student film makers took over. But in 2000 that changed when GLADIATOR hit the screens and planted Russell Crowe firmly in the position of movie star. More movies followed like TROY and 300. And so it is we now have the latest film based on Greek mythology, IMMORTALS.

The story opens by telling us the history of the Gods of Greece, having risen up against the Titans and imprisoning them in Mount Tartarus. The only weapon on Earth that could possibly free the Titans and thus open the world to a war among Gods once more is the Epirus bow, now being sought by King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke).

As the army of Hyperion moves forward in search of the bow, villages fall and inhabitants try to stay one step ahead avoiding capture. Young Theseus (Henry Cavill) is a highly skilled warrior trained by an old man in his village (John Hurt). But since his birth was the result of his mother being raped, both are looked down upon and when the time comes to leave they are left behind. This results in Theseus' mother's death when the village is attacked by Hyperion's men and Theseus is captured.

While this is going on Hyperion has captured the oracle Phaedra in hopes that she will lead him to the bow he seeks. But it is visions of Theseus that fill her head and she knows that he is the key to stopping Hyperion. When their paths cross Theseus helps leads a revolt against the few guards that hold them prisoner organized by Phaedra and with the help of a thief named Stavros (Stephen Dorff) they set out to bury his mother in his home village.

While in the village they discover that the Epirus bow was buried there all along. Theseus recovers the bow but is attacked by Hyperion's beast the Minotaur. Theseus survives and knows his destiny lies in stopping Hyperion. They travel to Phaedra's home only to be overtaken by Hyperion's men and losing the bow. Now it's up to Theseus to join the army that stands against Hyperion and prevent the release of the Titans. And this is just the main story going on here.

Along the way Theseus and Phaedra fall in love, politicians fall for Hyperion's tricks and nearly cause the downfall of the civilized world and the Gods speak to Theseus. It seems that the person who trained him was Zeus posing as the old man. Having already told the rest of the Gods that they are not to interfere, he tells Theseus that the Gods can not assist man; they must shine on their own. These were the rules written long ago when the Titans were first imprisoned.

Of course this all means that we're bound to see a major battle scene involving the good army against the bad one, a face off between Theseus and Hyperion and the possibility of the release of the Titans if Theseus doesn't quite take care of things. And should they be released, a battle among Gods will surely follow.

The movie offers the tale of a hero extremely well and perhaps it's time we told stories of heroes once again. It seems there we find few out there these days in the spotlight and so many are toppled from their pedestals by those who feel we need more truth and less heroes. Myself I'm glad we have heroes to inspire us even if they are in movies and stories only.

The special effects are dazzling to watch and fit nicely into the story rather than take it over. Battle scenes are bloody but they would have been since they involved more bludgeoning and blades than anything else. But at least those involved have that gritty look to them as opposed to the freshly starched togas seen in some films.

The acting done by all shines here, especially Cavill. That's great to see since he's been tapped to portray Superman in the new film being made. He has the presence to carry that role off which many were concerned about when he was named. If he can make you believe he's the Grecian hero seen here then Superman should be a breeze.

The movies being turned out in this genre have all been exceptional and well worth our time as a viewing audience. Many have been worth adding to our collections, including this one. Let's just hope they continue to make them and then discover that the past treasures deserve blu-ray treatment as well. For now we'll have to be content watching releases like IMMORTALS which offer tremendous entertainment.",1336953600,2,4445,4.476543209876543
4414220,2,B004LWZW8S,"This movie has a lot of attractive guys in it, but seriously... It seems way too stagey and costumey, and like the actors are obviously acting, and not very well, either.

Lame movie, overall. If you're looking for something like Kingdom of Heaven or Braveheart or the recent Robin Hood, this movie is all wrong.

The plot is basically the story of Thesius and King Hyperion.  Hyperion is destroying all of Greece looking to capture the bow of the gods, and the gods refuse to intervene since they claim this is a human affair.

Lets start with the plot.  The plot had so many plotholes in it and the movement of the story just simply went absolutely nowhere.  The movie and the story line were so unbelievably boring that I can not even express how bad it was.  The movie was portrayed to be a fast paced action movie and this was clearly not the case.  There was some fighting in the beginning, nothing too spectacular, a little bit of blood and a cut throat here or there, but that was about the extent of the fun.

As the movie drags along you finally get a pretty good scene where Thesius fights a large berserker type soldier of Hyperions, ultimately it was nothing more than a mediocre fight scene that you could see in any movie.

Finally the end of the movie and yet another supposidly epic fight scene gone terribly wrong.  It was so slow moving and boring, Thesius spending ten minutes running around looking for Hyperion, than a 20 mintute fight scene between  the two which was so slow and boring it was not even funny, it was like watching two old men beat each other with their walkers.

Now that i've beat that horse to death, lets discuss the lighting... the lighting in this movie was awful.  All of the scenes were dark and muddy as hell, that even if I cared what was going on I would have no clue.

Lastly, the gods... OMG, what a bunch of losers.  They made the god's these skinny little worthless invalids.  If you want a real laugh get look at Zeus, he looks like Marc Anthony without the Cocaine.  Even the Titans look pathetic, they all look alike (even though they were brothers and parents of the gods), and they too are all pathetic looking.

This movie was awful, it went nowhere the customes and designes were pathetic, the lighting was way off and worst of all it was boring as hell...

Save the money.. don't do it!! Either Netflix it or rent it from the library, but definatey don't pay for it.",1336435200,6,2360,4.284424379232505

4414333,2,B004LWZW8S,"SPOILERS!

""Immortals"" is a rivetingly original tale, told in the grand tradition of sword & sorcery fantasy fiction. It is the story of Dar (Henry Cavill), a young fearless warrior who is the last of the peaceful agrarian Emurites. Dar's entire village gets slaughtered by the barbarian Juns in an horrific raid, and Dar is enslaved. One of his fellow captive-slaves is the young and beautiful Kiri (Frieda Pinto), a slave-girl who was secretly an oracular priestess of the old religion, before the evil Juns conquered her homeland and instituted the foul rites of the Priests of Ar.

Under the command of their fearsome Warlord (Mickey Rourke), the Jun horde has been raiding religious shrines throughout the known world, in search of the powerful One Ring. The Jun Warlord knows that the legendary One Ring will bestow omnipotence on the Juns and enable him to overthrow the reign of gods by releasing the Kraken, the last and mightiest of the evil Titans, which has been imprisoned by the father of the gods, Zeus (Luke Evans), in a weird cube-thing beneath Mount Tartarus.

In the meantime, Zeus and his subordinate gods have been unable to check the Juns' violent incursions, as Zeus proscribes any god's direct influence of mortal affairs, as well as the wearing of anything other than Gay Pride Parade gold flowing capes and headdresses created by Lady Gaga's costume designer. While the Juns' depredations continue unabated, the people of Rohan must flee to the safety of Helm's Deep, their ancestral stronghold. However, the traitor Grima Wormtongue (Joseph Morgan) betrays his former comrades, by revealing to the Juns the one weak point in the walls of Helm's Deep (Hint: It's the gate). The gate of Helm's Deep is known as the ""Hot Gates."" It opens on a narrow corridor that runs for an hundred feet underneath Helm's Deep's defensive wall before debouching into the courtyard of the walled fortress. There in that narrow corridor, the Juns' vast numbers count for nothing, and in this way King Leonidas (Cavill) is able to lead his fellow Greeks to victory, but only after delivering a rousing speech about fighting and why it's necessary.

What about the fights? Aren't they amazing? Sure, Henry Cavill fights just about everybody from Nathan Jones' family, and later the Greek gods use their Greek Matrix-powers to battle the Titans, and its all very bloody and gory. Personally, these days I'm feeling just a little more intimidated by short, wiry Indonesian pencak silat masters than I am by seven-foot tall powerlifters. Not only is the fighting much better, but the storyline, plot twists, and character development offered by the short, wiry Indonesians beats ""Immortals"" hands down, in my opinion.

Oh, and I apologise in advance for destroying any sense of surprise that moviegoers may have derived from viewing this highly original and unique adventure film. Gotta go now, I've got a date in a Jakarta slum with an army of hardcore gangsters. So keep Greeking it up, people.

Well, for starters, the movie borrowed the names of Greek legends like Zeus, Athena, Theseus, Poseidon, but lost most (if not all) of the traditional Greek mythology that goes with the names. Namely, the movie makers took these famous names and made up their own stories completely, trying to give the movie modern appeal. What came out was a movie that kind of made sense but didn't have much meaning or depth. The battle scenes weren't interesting or intense. The story didn't draw me in. I felt no emotional connection/sympathy/empathy with the characters. Overall, it was a disappointment and predictably boring. The ending was a little confusing.

About the only positive things you can say about this movie is that the sets are sometimes quite visually spectacular, and the actress who plays the Oracle is genuinely hypnotic.

4414668,3,B004LWZW8S,"The titans are contained in an ancient box and locked in place for all time. King Hyperion in the year 1228 BC wants to release them and wreak havoc on the world of mankind and pit the titans against their ancient enemies the gods. This is a story based on Greek mythology, sort of. It is as much made up as it does not follow the ancient tales and the story line seemed to wander as the mixture of ancient history and modern script writing get intermingled.

Theseus is a protagonist that comes from humble peasant background who is educated and trained by the god Zeus disguised in human form. He is mankinds and perhaps the god's last hope for survival from King Hyperion and the titans. This movie had great potential but I found it to be slow moving at times and many of the scenes were very dark. Theseus finds the mythical Epirus bow that is a magical weapon of great power and one that can kill from great distances. Unfortunately he loses it twice and seems to have slippery fingers. Faced against an army of hundreds of thousands he manages to kill four warriors with the bow!

I didn't enjoy the liberties taken with real Greek mythology and there should have been enough in the ancient tales to have made a great movie without muddying the water with so many twists in the script. The titans were depicted as man size beings that the gods ripped apart easily and the titans only did well because of superior numbers in the fight. The titans were ancient and powerful giants and the story of the movie had nothing in common with the ancient history beliefs.

With all the high tech imagery, high powered action and actors this movie could have been a lot more. It came out OK but not outstanding and I expected more. The haphazard storyline was intermingled with some good fight scenes but overall the movie just didn't grab me like the movie 300 did.",1334620800,,1862,4.486725663716814

Trust me, not every award winner is a good film, and not every good film is an award winner.
It does all it needs to with decent acting, great SPEFX and a decent storyline. Films based on Greek Mythology and fantasy are among my first choice for passing a little time and putting aside the real world for a while, and Immortals does this very well.

4414784,3,B004LWZW8S,"It's close to 300, but lacks a fully-defined world.

Synopsis and Plot Summary:

King Hyperion declares war on humanity and seeks the all-powerful Bow of Epirus which he will use to unlock the imprisoned Titans. Theseus, a human peasant is favored and trained by Zeus incarnate to become the savoir of all humanity.

General Angle:

This is 300 turned up a notch by replacing the Spartans with fighting gods. 300 was based loosely around true events and Immortals gives the same visual treatment to Greek Mythology.

The New and Original:

The gods are young and active. No more lounging around in floating clouds, wearing togas and eating grapes. Titans (who were supposed to be as strong as or stronger than the gods) are skillful warriors and not the far-from-factual monsters depicted in Clash of the Titans. For the record, Medusa and the Kraken are not Titans.

What's Old and Borrowed:

Slow motion combat sequences. A hero that is TOLD he's a hero, BECOMES a hero without doing too many heroic things. A single weapon/object that's so powerful it can defeat armies. Yes, more movies like Lord of the Rings and Krull. A woman who serves no purpose besides being eye candy- yes, that's Megan Fox in The Transformers.

When I saw the trailer for this movie two years ago, I quietly leaned over to my girlfriend and said ""They made this one for me."" Really, it's a guy's movie with the looks of intense battles and non-stop action. I love the combination of great visuals and majestic vistas. I like when moments in a movie have additional impact from meaningful storylines and solid character development. I do. This is a great movie, but its total ranking on my charts suffers from flaws in its foundation. Since 300 is its too- close- for- kissing -cousin, we'll offer some comparisons.

I'll skip over the slow-mo fight scenes and partial nudity to nudity (ahem) and Rourke (Hyperion) verse um...the guy who played Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). It's about the believability of the world. That makes the action have meaning, the plot twists intriguing, the characters have dimension and the storyline have a logical course. That's what's missing here. Oh, by the way, if you're the kind of movie fan that only cares about loud explosions, action stunts, hot chicks and plots as simple as The Dukes of Hazzard; just go see the movie, its' awesome.

I expected more and at first I couldn't figure out why I wasn't enjoying this epic as much as I should have. I figured out why the remake of Clash of the Titans missed the bullseye for me. It was a pacing problem. Everything happened so fast; nothing had any meaning. He gets the Pegasus, no big deal. It's just a flying horse. No sense of wonder there. Even the hero Perseus seemed unimpressed. Dude, you just got a flying horse! Both Troy and Alexander had some great moments, but the impact was lessened by all the badly executed scenes between battles.

In Immortals, it's the world that's lacking. I read that Director Tarsem Singh had a lot of control over this movie. With movies like The Cell and The Fall under his belt, you have no doubts about his ability to tell a tale with visual flair. But for Immortals it seems as though the one-man's-vision approach leads us to numerous plot holes and logic-defying devices.
Let's take a look at some of them: SPOILER ALERT AHEAD!!!!!

1. Early in, Theseus is told he must wait a day to evacuate his village before the rapidly advancing army of Hyperion. The privileged upper class is leaving immediately and the poor must wait 24 hours. Why? And why wouldn't he just leave on his own? If you were told a flood was coming and you must evacuate, but only certain people could leave now, would you say ""Oh, okay"" and stick around? Exactly.

2. Next, a captured Theseus is sent to the salt mines to work. At night the slaves are corralled near a fountain where the (hot) Virgin oracles are also getting a sip or two. And the hotties are chilling one-room over at the Hyperion-Hotel-Six. Who would mix rough slaves with the sexy virg-...oh wait, why are there only four slaves at the salt pit? Why do we never enter the salt mines and only see the front door? Why are there so few guards? How do they get from the salt flats back to...wait...

3. Everything in this world is a few minutes walk. At least when King Leonidas, in 300, showed his map, it did look like walking distance. They also omit any means of travel. The massive army of Hyperion has no horses, carriages or any depicted means of getting around. We only (really) saw two horses in the entire movie and they seemed thrown in at the last minute to solve another How do we get there quick? problem.

4. She's the virgin oracle that never sees a useful vision. She was hunted down because she could lead Hyperion to the Epirus Bow, but um...she didn't know where it was and our hero found it on his own, by accident. And after she loses her visionary powers by having sex (like she couldn't wait till the end of the movie) she's still around and truly serving no purpose. Speaking of serving no purpose, did you think the Monk who sliced off his own tongue was going to have some kind of significance after sticking around so long? Me too.

5. Yay, a cool scene involving Poseidon making a giant wave. How come the main characters can leave the boat, but the bad guys stayed in the boat and just watched the wave come. AND the Oracle said something to the effect of staying steadfast when the sky thunders. Well, she quoted that line right before the tidal wave hit and our hero did the opposite. He jetted off that boat like he leaned over and saw the name Titanic written on the side.

6. Their plan is to commandeer a merchant boat of Hyperion's navy, but at the dock, there's no one. No other boats, crews or merchants or goods even...and that leads us to another problem.

7. Aside from the bad-guy action figures like the hawk-guy, the Bull guy and the beast, everyone else in Hyperion's army is a generic foot soldier. No generals, captains or anyone else of any rank or skill. In 300, you saw assorted flavors in the Xerxes forces. They seemed like a conquering horde. In Immortals, they felt like the extras they were.

8. Speaking of people, in 300 I could see myself living in that universe, tending, crafting, hell maybe I'd be some kind of musician there too. In Immortals they never showed us Hellenic life to actually see what Theseus would have been fighting to save. Same with the gods. What do they do besides watch us? I wish we knew more about their world. Had their universe been more and better defined, I might have more to walk away with- than the memories of some very cool and graphically charged combat scenes.

I could go on longer, but I'm even getting tired of taking apart this movie. It's good, long as you watch it lightly and don't think too deeply about anything besides the beauty of the visually visceral violence. I rate it a 8.5 and 300 a 9.2",1334188800,,6944,4.565916398713826

4414787,2,B004LWZW8S,"This film was slammed by the critics when it first came out, which is no indication that it may not be likable... but for once I agree with them. This film has little style and no substance.

In ancient times, the gods are forbidden from interfering in the affairs of men unless the infamous Titans are released. Zeus (Luke Evans) warns his children against engaging in battle when King Hyperon begins to terrorize the mainland. His intention is to find a mystical bow, and he believes the oracle Phaedra (Freida Pinto) can reveal its whereabouts. But she is always surrounded by companions and no one knows which is the true oracle. When she is captured in the temple, she encounters Theseus (Henry Cavill), about whom she has a vision. A man of distinction but little interest in politics, Theseus and his companions help her escape... and are engaged in an epic war between the gods and the Titans.

Five minutes into this movie I thought it was terrible. The thing is, some movies start out bad and then get better. This one never did. It is an emotionless, passion-less project with one-dimensional characters. There are some pretty costumes but nothing much to look at, and the entire film was shot in such dark interiors that if you don't watch it in a pitch black room, you won't be able to see much of anything -- which is at times a blessing. There are some incredible visual effects here and there, particularly in the last fifteen minutes, but frankly in spite of all the violence, it's boring. When you don't engage with the characters on an emotional level, and you don't care if the love story works, there's no point in investing in the film at all. The acting staggers between decent and terrible.

It feels like this was pitched in a hurry, written in a crunch, and then filmed without a capable director at its helm to see when it wasn't working. At least with the atrocious Clash of the Titans, I was entertained. Here, not so much. It had a big budget and clearly most of it went into the special effects. There are some cool moments when Zeus shows up, but overall it's forgettable.

Some of the fight scenes are pretty impressive but the actor roles could have been so much better.

4414914,2,B004LWZW8S,"I came to see this movie with a very big bias I will admit. I love Tarsem's filmmaking and his altered perception on common stories. I thought ""The Fall"" was hands-down one of the best movies of the past decade and thoroughly enjoyed The Cell.

With that said, when I heard he was making this movie a year ago I was really excited and started reading up on it everywhere. When I got to the theatre I was still sitting around for 20 minutes after the film was done expecting there to be a epilogue that explained a lot. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE STORY??!!! It felt like the producers took the script and cut it in half over and over again and we only saw scraps of what could be! In greek mythology Hyperion is a Titan, I kept waiting for them to explain that he escaped and is seeking his revenge disguised as a human, which would make sense as to why he is doing everything and knows certain things and is so much stronger than everyone, but NO, nothing, the movie just abruptly ends. What gives?

As with any movie by Tarsem the film is incredibly lavish and the design tends to be the strongest element in the movie. The only problem with this is that you can tell they only filmed inside sound studios because which is weird because most of the film takes place outdoors. It really made everything feel closed in and isolated, which worked against them I think. I think they were trying to make things more intimate for the 3D effect, but this movie really didn't need to be in 3D!!!

As far as the acting goes, Henry Cavill was alright as an action star, but due to the crappy storyline there really isn't much to work with. Mickey Rourke is good of course as a ruthless king, Frida Pinto is so-so, nothing too earthshaking here. What was surprising was Stephen Dorff making a comeback as a sidekick thief who tags along for the adventure. Luke Evans also does a good job as a stern and commanding Zeus.

When the Blu-Ray was announced and they stated that there is over an hour of additional footage and an alternate ending I thought that it was a must see because the theatrical version was so bad, so I went out looking to rent it. Unfortunately the company that produced this created 3 seperate versions of the blu-ray and then only released the standard version to rental companies like Blockbuster and Netflix. That means that if you want to see the full version story that you were intended to see from the director then you have to purchase the Blu-Ray. Total crap!",1333411200,3,2473,4.416666666666667

I am the 155th reviewer and I am puzzled that there were so many reviews. I feel sorry for the people who could not enjoy it supposedly because of some of its unusual features. It does indeed feature unusual living conditions for these ancient greeks instead of iconic Mediterranean scenery but I loved their fantastical cliff dwellings! But this is mythICAL, so why not. This does not have a lot to do with the conventional Theseus myths but again this was clearly not a film intended to be shown in classrooms or to a substitute for reading classical sources. If you want to learn about the legendary Theseus go do some reading. There even were a few things that were inconsistent with the the traditions and that bothered me that I don't see mentioned in all the criticisms, but I did not let them spoil the film for me. I think that viewing this film does require one to sort of forget about ""realism"" if that term can be applied to mythology :) and just sit back and enjoy the freshness in the visual/dramatic experience regarding this cinematic fantasy.

But how many swords and sandals types of films are accurate anyway? Some ""look"" authentic but they usually take liberties in any event. I would just say if you think you can relax about things like this then there can be riches  in the watching experience with this film.

I personally think Greek mythology (and Roman, Indian, and Norse, for that matter) is ripe for action movie-making, especially with today's brilliant special effects. But after seeing this movie, I remembered things like plots, direction, casting, dialogue, and production matter.

It certainly looks pretty, I'll give it that--and it doesn't have that slightly false, kind of strange look that ""300"" had to it's backgrounds, for example. Shading, shadows, and coloring is used well during battle-scenes to make certain scenes particularly enjoyable. However, the sound is off--not sure why, but at times I had the sound turned up to 75, so I could hear dialogue,which was kinda sad because it only made sense about half the time, and then dropped it to 30 during the battles.

However, I found the film deeply boring and predictable.

I'm not sure why it's so boring, exactly--for one, there is no reason to care for any of the characters, as they are shallowly drawn caricatures, at best, or simply faces with names, at worse--but there is also heavy use of slow-motion scenes and long, ""zooming in"" and ""zooming out"" shots of landscapes. Some scenes and transitions just took a LONG time! I strongly suspect this was a 60 minute film, extended to be become ""production"" length by cheesy use of slow motions, landscapes, and repeated shots of things that didn't matter (foggy walls, the metal bull, Olympus, etc). I'm frankly a little tired of the use slow-motion fight scenes in Hollywood, though I didn't even reallize it until watching this film. I'm not sure what other reviewers are talking about when they mention all the fight scenes as if there are many--I think there is 1 or 2 in the first hour of the movie--and maybe 2 or 3, including the longer one at the end, in the last hour--and other than the final fight, I think they last 2 or 3 minutes at the most. Furthermore, and most damningly, they are essentially the same scenes one sees in the advertisements. There really isn't that much else, though they are longer.

I personally found Henry Cavill decent in a poorly-written role (for example, why would the army at the end rally to his words, since he's not part of them and has done everything possible to avoid involvement in the conflict with the army who asked him to join them?), and Frieda Pinto (as always) gorgeous and watchable, but her character was essentially a trope with little true value in moving the plot forward, and who loses her powers of predestination after she is knocked up by the hero (wow, what does THAT say?). I did not like Mickey Rourke's character or characterization, as written or performed, and I'm generally a Rourke fan...too mindlessly evil and selfish, though not particularly intimidating, maybe a little too bizarre. Why does he, when the gods ignore his call for help, decide to kill the gods by releasing the titans, rather than concluding there are no gods (which is actually more rational)? Why does he want a magic bow, the Nuclear Weapon of the Greek World, that he then uses exactly twice?  Why would he conclude the gods, who beat the titans once, wouldn't do it again?  Why does he keep switching out from amongst a series of garish masks? Why does he struggle so with speaking full sentences without an East Coast accent?

And finally...the battle between the titans and gods at the end. Kinda good, except it made no sense according to the mythology. So the titans are a bunch of frenetic, bestial, grey-skinned, normal-sized PEOPLE with no fighting skills and who basically explode when the gods swing sticks and pointy knives into them? The gods are essentially played like superheroes in this movie, but the titans (who are supposed to be immortal, powerful GIANTS against whom the gods rebelled--and barely survived! They were imprisoned because they were too powerful to kill and too dangerous to leave loose!) basically act like the mindless, swarming vampires in ""Blade III."" C'mon, seriously?

In the end, it might be decent popcorn fare for a Saturday or Sunday afternoon when it's raining or snowing too much outide, as long as you can rent it or get it for a discounted price.",1332374400,3,4400,4.796833773087071

4415398,2,B004LWZW8S,"From director Tarsem Singh (The Cell) comes Immortals, a visual dynamo of a film that offers little to nothing else.  Henry Cavill (from The Tudors and soon to be seen as the new Superman) is Theseus; a mortal man chosen by Zeus (Luke Evans) to stop the evil King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) from finding a mythical bow used for unleashing the mythical Titans and laying waste to the rest of the world.  Along for the ride are a thief (Stephen Dorff) and an oracle (Freida Pinto) as Theseus fights and flexes his way across the screen, with blood and swordplay being the order of the day.  Much like The Cell, Immortals is a visual feast that features amazing technical achievements while offering little in the way of story or character development.  Not to mention the fact that there are so many plot holes and inconsistencies along the way that you'll be hard pressed keeping track of everything going on.  The film's battle and fight scenes are good, but there are too many slow moments that bog up the pace and as a result Immortals feels uneven.  Cavill does little to prove himself leading man material, as the rest of the cast (including John Hurt, Alan Van Sprang, Isabel Lucas, and Kellan Lutz) pretty much phones it in, but it's Mickey Rourke that manages to leave a lasting impression in an otherwise mediocre affair.

I had to turn the brightness up on a 61"" display that was called ""so bright it can be seen from space"" in a professional magazine reviewer's opinion, so the TV is not the issue.

This darkening trend is infecting many studios and the people responsible for the final appearance of their films.  If you look in the special features, you will find some deleted scenes that were not included in the final processing and are much brighter, easily seen and clear.

This darkening is being carried too far and hurting the final product.  We wonder if there is a reason for this other than Hollywood sheep following a bad trend.  Less detail is possible; mistakes can be covered up, bad photography hidden.....

As for the negative reviews...I'm REALLY surprised. Regarding the story, it clarifies early in the movie that the gods can be killed (even though they are crazy powerful compared to a regular human).

The movie's color scheme and tinting were on the dark side as some have noted, but I didn't have any trouble viewing any of the movie, including a 20 minute segment I watched on my Nexus One AMOLED screen while I was waiting for some code to build.  I thought the color scheme and tinting actually gave it a very dreamlike quality that lent itself well to a story from ancient times.  The scenes and sets were visually stunning in their detail without going overboard, and the action was awesome; reminding me of fight scenes from Spartacus (but without the Kill Bill style blood and whatnot.)  I also thought the acting from the entire cast was very good.  The only long monologues were carried out by the veteran actors like John Hurt and Mickey Rourke, but I thought that the rest of the cast did a great job on their parts as well.

The story only very loosely fallows the Theseus tales, and the gods are cast in a VERY humane light (though that isn't completely unheard of in Greek mythos), but I still liked how the story was structured and molded together along with all the action.  All in all, it's a recasting of an ancient myth, but given that I've heard multiple versions of this myth, it worked fine for me.  If any are curious to see what the movie is like, you can always go to YouTube and watch what people have uploaded there.

Oh, Beverly Hills Cop was a great movie, but Bad Boys sucked because it was trying to be too much like BHC. You know, because Bad Boys pretty much stole the idea of a comedy with black cops. Dee Dee Dee, duh.

So anyways, this movie for me was excellent and the action scenes exceeded 300. Maybe not in quantity, but quality. I also read some people complaining about the Gods's armor and costum, that it looked cheesy. Really? Did you expect them to come down in robes? The Immortals can technically die, sooooo thus the armor. I feel stupid that I even have to explain this.

As far as everything else, I loved it. I rarely ever watch a movie twice within 48 hours, but this was the case for Immortals. The last film I watched twice was Black Death from 2010 starring Sean Bean. You should check that out also. Peace and Blessings.

4415564,1,B004LWZW8S,"Seriously!
Even though I am Greek myself, I can enjoy a greek-imspired, suspenseful and full-of-special-effects adventure/action film that is fun-to-watch, even if it rapes the entire mythology. For example, I enjoyed Troy, 300, even the Clash of the Titans (enough to want to watch the sequel). The key word here is FUN-TO-WATCH, which Immortals IS NOT!!! I cannot stress that enough!!!! The story HAD potential (providing you understood what was going on) and the movie WAS packed with action, so WHY WAS IT SO BAD?

Well, for starters, the movie is extremely, unnecessarily dark. I don't mean that in a thematic, artistic, tim burton-sort-of way, but LITERALLY the black color on the screen. You spend more than two hours squinting, trying to figure out what is on the screen, desperately waiting for a frame that shows some sun in the surroundings. High-def only accentuated that. And it didn't seem to be because their photography director had a bad day. Instead, my guess was that it was part of an overly stylized take on the ancient world (OVERLY STYLIZED) which just made the movie painful (literally) to watch. No, not artistic or elegant (like 300 managed to do).

Secondly, TOO MUCH BLOOD! And not in the obvious tarantino-splatter-sort-of-way, but just as a matter of fact, just because EVERY character in that movie (immortals and mortals alike) are unreasonably, unnecessary bloodthirsty. It's not even fun!! It strips the movie of all its righteous, emotional message of revenge and protecting the ones you love and so on and so forth. Instead, we are put through a tasteless extravaganza of killing (who kills who and exactly why is extremely difficult to understand -not to mention you can't see faces through the darkness).

As I said, the movie had potential: I am sure all the characters had depth and stuff on paper. But the movie FAILS to communicate that! And that's fine, because, in the end, I was not expecting a life-changing eye-opening philosophical experience. But I did expect a nice mass-audience good-beats-evil adventure full of eye-candy graphics (it was released in 3D, too, for crying out loud). I DID expect to feel, you know, happy after I watched it. Instead, I was left with the image of people getting slaughtered, decapitated, burned alive etc. and for no apparent reason. I felt depressed at having wasted 2 hours and $6 to watch this. Even GODS (yeah, the olympian idea of human-centric yet almighty gods) have their motives mixed up. Nope. Too much trouble for a movie that offers NOTHING.

Even if my analysis has not so far convinced you about how unworthy this movie is of your time, just trust me. Or trust my boyfriend who, after finishing this movie, exclaimed: ""you know a movie was bad when, after it's done, you feel you would have had better time doing homework instead.""

4415597,1,B004LWZW8S,"It is the era of the Internet. this movie should have been at least as bad/or good (depending on your perspective) as the original Clash Of The Titans. But it reeks of Internetness in the negative sense of it.

A lot of VISUAL information is its most noticeable characteristic. And as in the Internet, it's mostly disorganized and confusing. Here's why(the devil is in the details):

1.-The famous bow it's mentioned to had been forged by Heracles, or Hercules AFTER the story mentions that it was used BEFORE human existed in a war between Titans and gods. Heracles was human. That is simply an atrocious overlook either meant as a test to viewers attention (and then a very disrespectful action) or an act of idiocy.

2.-They simply took a modern cheap recurve bow and painted it black to make it look epic. What is there left to say?

3.-In the scene where Hyperion takes the bow you can clearly see Mickey Rourke had no clue how to pull a bow correctly, half an hour with a practice bow and an instructor would have been enough to retake that scene. It seems he actually did later on which leaves that first scene even less unexplained.

4.-In ACTUAL greek mythology gods were known for constantly intervening in human affairs, specially wars. That was the WHOLE point of Greek mythology. If you forgive the fact that trying to go against it doesn't make any sense its even more gut wrenching when you see the absurdity of gods dying withstanding an overwhelming number of titans because they didn't intervene when they still had a chance to avoid the titans being released. No one knows why they gods didn't eradicated the titans on the first place but what is more painful is that they weren't smart enough to act when they had the advantage and simply chose NOT to do it because ""they had faith in human"". Faith and stupidity are two different things and it doesn't involve dying from a god's perspective. It doesn't make any sense. If you are going to do a radical change like that, THINK about it.
All in all I would have given this script another 6 months to a year to actually film it.

5.-The gods costumes, it looks like a fashion designer wanted to take revenge on the world and decided to come up with the most freakily costumes they could design to cause physical pain on the viewers.

6.-The gods cast. I can't understand why did they looked for teenage models to play the gods. The gods were supposed to be badass forged in the legendary war with the titans. The actors didn't look badass. For example, Palas Athena is supposed to encompass wisdom. I don't think she did. That tells me they didn't put enough attention to detail to the gods characters.

7.- When the party arrives back to the temple where the oracle was the mute priest runs off and Theseus screams: ""It's a trap"". Then he clumsily proceeds to follow him to conveniently fall into it, lose the bow clumsily and get Apollo murdered by his father by trying to rescue him. This is the typical and abundant stupidity challenging cheap resource to twist the story in an absurd way to allow the screenwriter to force an outcome. It's so frequent that it must be in the screenwriters manual on page 1.

8.-In the final fight it's obvious that Neptune gets killed by the titans yet you see him fighting in the heavens alongside Theseus in his child's vision. It is not clear to me if the two yellow figures rising from ""Tartarus"" are Zeus WITH Athena in his hands and Neptune following. It wouldn't make any sense since he was getting chopped while Zeus brought the mountain down.

Good things:

The idea of the Minotaur as a torturer/executioner/overly big guy with a helmet is somewhat original and probably the only thing that made some sense in the movie. I would have explored that a little bit more.
Human costumes. The human costumes were ok in my opinion, from armor to weaponry(except the""epic"" bow) with the exception of the swords that looked more like gladius made in Rome.
The message in the ""politician"" who wanted to negotiate at the doors of extinction and gets his head chopped. If it wasn't because people can be this stupid I would say this part didn't make any sense either( you would think a politician would find something his counterpart wanted to bargain first) but indeed, the message of what happens when you're so stupid is there.

The story looks half baked to me.",1331510400,4,4369,4.608751608751609
4415598,2,B004LWZW8S,"This movie was sad at best.  What made it really bad was the waste of a good story.  Greek mythology is teaming with epic movies and this story is one just not this movie.

I'm not sure but that's what I got out of it.

The movie was slow and the story was confusing and non linear.  You just wait for the good to happen and it never does.  The Brazen Bull is a good touch.

The Props were bad they used rebar for everything.  I didn't realize rebar had been around for so long and was capable of holding gods, in all of Hollywood they couldn't find something better than rebar. The Bow was purchased from the nearest sports store and had some crap glued to the handle and painted black.  I didn't realize the gods were into carbon fiber limbs and sight mounts, just sad.  Then the armor.  It was metal of some kind but when Theseus takes it off in the Titan cave in crumples like it fabric of some kind.  Those type of errors are just awful in big budget movies today.

This is nothing like 300, a great movie.  It's a sad example of a studio trying to cash in.",1331510400,,1254,4.12396694214876

Even if the story was a little more coherent, it would be impossible to tell with the horrible sound editing.

4415600,3,B004LWZW8S,"Immortals is Greek mythology in the same way that PF Chang's is Chinese food. At best, this film can be described as ""Greek-inspired"" or ""Greek-themed"" mythology, because if you're looking for an authentic retelling of these age-old stories, you came to the wrong place, buddy. It takes some of the people and place names and concepts from the tales of ye gods and goddesses, puts them all inside a high speed blender, and mashes up everything beyond recognition. So much so that major characters are reduced to tiny ones (Lysander, Minotaur), a Titan (Hyperion) made into a ruthless and evil human king searching for a mythical weapon called the ""Epirus Bow"" that was invented for the movie, and the main character made into a peasant of illegitimate birth (Theseus) instead of noble lineage.. Instead of mighty precursors to the gods, the Titans are depicted as animalistic blue savages trapped inside a cube and arranged in neat rows like figures on a foosball table. I won't even mention the anachronisms and gaping historical liberties taken with what's supposed to be Ancient Greece, but I will mention the Mad Max/bondage-themed attire sported by most of the bad guys!

One should not look to movies to educate. For that, we have books and documentaries. If you came to be educated, please go read a book (like the one I mentioned:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gods-Heroes-and-Men-of-Ancient-Greece-Mentor/dp/0451628004/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gods, Heroes and Men of Ancient Greece (Mentor)</a>. What you get here is mindless hack and slash entertainment. Being the spiritual and stylistic heir to 300, if nothing else, this movie looks fantastic, speaking purely from a production design standpoint. Directed by Tarsem Singh, who also helmed the equally visually-stunning&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fall/dp/B001BPJJ82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fall</a>, there's no denying that this movie absolutely drips with masculinity and taut visual style. Don't mind the story too much. It's utter nonsense about a king with a major grudge against the gods who seeks a weapon to free the Titans so they'll run loose and fight the Olympians. It does not follow any established story in Greek mythology and there are huge gaps of logic all over.

Most of the film is very dark and grey both in terms of visuals and storytelling. Lots of barren rock and cliffs, and lots of decapitations and gore. Not much color, except for some signature splashes of golds, and red, which Tarsem is fond of. Do take in the gorgeous costume designs, sets, glistening muscles of Henry Cavill and the other actors, however. For the ladies, there's a lot of man-beefiness, and maybe too much on display on Mount Olympus, with Poseidon and some other dudes hanging out in all their glory, if you know what I mean. Much of the costuming and design reminds me of the videogame&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/God-of-War-III/dp/B000ZK9QCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">God of War III</a>. The scene where Poseidon plunges into the ocean looks straight out of the game.

All in all, this film was OK if you've got nothing better to do for two hours. The ending was a lot of mindless violence. Some interesting use of super slow-mo cameras, but 300 did a much better job of fight choreography. They were much more creative, varied, and stylish.

4415702,2,B004LWZW8S,"Capitalizing on 300, we now have branched out into making up new greek myths.

We did Troy, why not the Odyssey?  That might have been good.  Or make a version of the Iliad where the gods are involved like they were in the story by Homer.

This just left me asking all sorts of questions during the movie, which is never good.  If I'm asking questions, it means that I am not remotely immersed in the story.

If Hyperion had a bow that could blast a 30 foot diameter hole in a solid block wall, why didn't he just take an extra five minutes to shoot a couple more arrows into the Hellenic army and win the final fight before it started?  He just couldn't be bothered?  He didn't want to guarantee victory?  He just gathered an army of thousands, marched them across a desert, wiped out the Hellenic villages and majority of their soldiers, but he had some other crap to do that night and was in a hurry?

Why would anyone go fight for Hyperion in the first place?  His leadership qualities are not inspiring, he has his employees smacked in the groin with a giant mallet so they won't reproduce.  Those soldiers who don't get their giggleberries crunched get stabbed or get their eyes poked out.  His management style is highly questionable.  I'm pretty sure I'd seek alternative employment.

If the gods could instantly teleport themselves to Olympus and back, maybe that would have been a good thing to do when getting stabbed in the crotch area by a titan.  I like to avoid getting stabbed in the crotch myself.  I cant help but assume that gods like to avoid getting stabbed in the jimmy also.  Poseidon, or at least I figured it was Poseidon (he had a trident after all), didn't seem to be in favor of being on the receiving end of the whole crotch stabbing.  Good time to jet back to Olympus real quick.

How did this army of what appears to be hundreds of thousands get across what appears to be a very unforgiving desert?  Where did they get food and water.  The logisitics are baffling.  I liked the movie 'Kingdom of Heaven', as they address this issue directly.  Here we just have this huge freaking army sitting around, waiting to go kill some folk for a boss who is kind of a dick to begin with.",1331251200,7,2208,4.408415841584159

It seems the writers were given free run on rewriting mythology but then no one took advantage of it to make a decent film. You end up asking whose mythology is this?

4415751,4,B004LWZW8S,"IMMORTALS is a comic book version of Greek Mythology - but then what film that deals with the mythical heroes isn't?  IMMORTALS just makes them bigger than life - which they are supposed to be. It also is a decent reminder that we all should brush up on Greek mythology for the lessons it holds, many of which remain relevant to today's modus operandi of oppression and domination when it comes to small countries, their inner conflicts, and the ravages imposed upon them by invaders. Written by Charles and Vlas Parlapanides and directed by Tarsem Singh Dhandwar who understands the use of CGI in making his story sail forth, IMMORTALS is in the final analysis entertainment - and who could ask for more.

John Hurt opens the thought process of the film with some thoughts about immortality and divinity and that sets off the action about the Titans encased in Mount Tartaros, the Greek gods in Olympus and a tawdry, extraordinarily brutal King Hyperion who desires total control, a goal that can only be accomplished by seizing the Epirus Bow.  Among the humans is one Theseus, a swarthy lad devoted to his mother, who knows no fear and when it comes to battle he will do anything for those he loves. And the rest is a touch of love story between Theseus the and oracle Phaedra, some good buddy relationship with Stavros, and a lot of fighting and mesmerizing corporeal dismemberment all in the name of battle. In the end it is up to Theseus to save his people from Hyperion and his hordes and win the honor of the gods, gaining immortality as a legend.

The cast is surprisingly good - Henry Cavill proves he can carry off a lead heroic character, and Mickey Rourke manages to create on of his best roles as the insane King Hyperion -  but the main ingredient in this film is the quality of eye candy from Freida Pinto to the collection of Adonis-like bared torsos of the likes of the very buff Cavill, Stephen Dorff, Luke Evans, Joseph Morgan, Kellan Lutz, Corey Sevier, Daniel Sharman, Steve Byers...it is a runway walk of perfect physiques.

4415843,1,B004LWZW8S,"I looked forward to seeing this movie with some anticipation, but was very dissappointed when I did.  It was filmed after the style of the movie ""The 300""  with deep sepia tones. Now the ""300"" was an excellent film, filled with fantasy, heroism, sacrifice, and excellent story telling. And even though the heros died at the end, you are not left feeling depressed.  Its too bad the same cannot be said for ""The Immortals"". Firstly,  ""Immortals"" overdid the sepia tone of the film, making it nearly impossible to see in many of the scenes.  They never developed any of the characters, and did not have a story that hung together in any coherent form.

I found this movie to be very disappointing, and more than a little depressing.  The basic story of the movie is that King Hyperion, a tyrant apparently driven mad by the death of his family, has apparently decided to wipe out the entire human race to avenge himself on the gods.

One of the main characters in the film is the god Zeus, who seems to be suffering from bi-polar disorder, considering how he runs both hot and cold during the movie.  Zeus, in disguise of an old man, has helped to raise and train the hero, Theseus. But he does nothing to help any other mortal, many of whom are suffering and dying all around him. When the other gods want to help the thousands of helpless human beings that are being tortured and slaughtered by Hyperion, Zeus orders that no god shall do anything to help a human, on pain of death.  His reasons for this are never made clear.  When the young god Apollo can no longer stand by and do nothing, he comes to earth and rescues Theseus right before he is about to be killed by Hyperion's men.  For this act of compassion, Zeus murders Apollo, his own son. None of the other gods so much as raise their voices in protest. Frankly I found little to choose between Hyperion and Zeus.

The hero Theseus finds the supernatural bow, but loses it.  Even the way he loses it seems stupid. When faced with a mob of Hyperion's monstrous soldiers, he makes no move to use the power of the godly weapon. Instead he runs forward to engage the enemy with his sword. And promptly falls down a hill and drops the bow. The villians get the bow, and Theseus never gets to use it in any of the epic battles. Hyperion uses it to release the Titans, and the bow is destroyed by Zeus when the gods appear to battle the titans.  The whole idea of the supernatural bow seems more than a little anti-climaxtic.

I could not find the point to this story. At the end, the hero Theseus gets killed, leaving his lover, the Oracle, to raise a fatherless child alone and destitute. All Theseus friends and most of the good guys get killed. Hyperion and all the bad guys get killed. All the gods (except Zeus) get killed. All the titans get killed. Basically everybody gets killed.  It's worse than the last act of Hamlet!

There are some wonderful battle scenes that are worth seeing, and some fantastic special effects.  It is just a shame that they could not have been used in a better story.  Film makers today seem to depend entirely on special effects to carry a movie, and give almost no thought to telling a good story.

4415845,1,B004LWZW8S,"One thing is for sure: former music video and commercial director Tarsem Singh has an uncanny knack for visual flair. Unfortunately, if he were equally as adept at telling a story, his feature films would be at least twice as impressive. As it stands, last year's Immortals, his third film, is his worst effort thus far. The story, loosely based on Greek myth, follows the efforts of mortal king Hyperion, who embarks on a destructive campaign in hopes of locating a powerful bow once wielded by the Gods, and the outcast warrior Theseus who sets out to stop him with the help of an oracle. Recalling the hyperstylized graphic novel aesthetic of 300, Immortals contains a wealth of evocative imagery and technically impressive cinematography, but I found the story largely inert, with slack pacing and thin plotting that served primarily to fill the gaps between battles. In other words, it's a jumble of a tale told with spectacular visuals, and in still other words, it's par for the course for Tarsem Singh.",1330992000,4,1010,4.877906976744186
4415956,5,B004LWZW8S,"This is really the movie they should have made.  The original Clash of the Titans was horribly cheesy, but great at that time.  The 2010 remake left a lot to desire.  Immortals is a spectacular movie that does so much right.  It's amazing if you get over the fact that mythology isn't being represented very well which I fully understand people will hate this movie for.

This movie was much better than 300, which I didn't particularly care for.  I think the pacing is a bit weird, it's a little too dark sometimes, pretentious and assuming at other times, but this is definitely one of the best graphic novel movies that have come out.  Sin City was great, but it felt too forced at times and got really goofy.  This movie managed to keep it's darkness more evil than campy.

It's certainly not for everyone as the reviews show, but this was by far one of my top 5 movies of 2011.  This hasn't been a great year with movies as much as it has been an amazing TV season... but the movies of 2011 I've watched several times and know I'll watch again would be this, along with Limitless Unrated Cut, Horrible Bosses, and (gasp) In Time.  There are a few better movies, but some movies just don't have great replay value.  These are this year's movies that I've already watched several times and know I will want to watch again.

4416040,2,B004LWZW8S,"Immortals is the latest in a slew of classical cinema epics that began back in the hoary early 2000s with Troy. The trend seemingly hit its zenith with 300, a visually exotic fist-bumping war epic in which naked men fight monstrous Iranians and their murder elephants. 300s big success was that it blurred the lines between reality and fantasy- The Persian army is made up of everything from ninjas to towering gargoylic giants, showing us the battle of Thermopylae not as it was, but as it would have been told in folk stories or dramatic poetry.

Immortals attempts to work the myth-through-the-lense-of-real-life angle as well. The minotaur is a sort of bondage commando who wears a barbed-wire cow mask, for instance. But the film is complicated somewhat by its inclusion of real-live gods who dress like they are about to appear in an Erasure video. The plot is similarly hodgepodge, with an evil king Hyperion (who appears to be an old-testament style Moloch worshiper) trying to free the Titans. Note that this is not the TITAN Hyperion trying to bail out his buddies, but just a guy NAMED Hyperion. In the course of battling Hyperion and the titans (who are represented as muddy men in silly hats who live in a box) a huge cast of uninteresting people will spend two hours or so bickering, stabbing stuff in slow motion with spears and having lengthy soft-R sex. Why? Because all those things happened in 300. But the feel is wrong; Immortals is overcomplicated where 300 was simple, grim where 300 was outrageous, and confusingly highbrow where 300 was hoards of oily men killing things.

The tradeoff is that Immortals may be the PRETTIEST film you see this decade. The movie's palate seems to have been completely rebuilt from scratch after shooting, with every color lifted from a renaissance fresco. The movie is a collection of truly beautiful images- but it would be better served as an art book than the long, tedious slog that it is.",1328745600,6,1950,4.800595238095238

4416044,3,B004LWZW8S,"Immortals was my first bigscreen viewing of a Tarsem Singh movie and I'll admit on sheer vision I was blown away. I've been a fan of Tarsem since his first film The Cell. His follow-up The Fall was the type of film you get every few years, a massive work that took four years and spanned several continents in its making. Now comes Immortals the first film of His I viewed in theatres and the very vision blew me way.
This film is just a gorgeous feast for the eyes from the opening shot showing the prison of the titans with towering statues of the cell that houses them, to the multiple vistas of small cities or lone structures in the middle of barren deserts. There's no words that can do justice to the vision backed up by an impressive ammount of production value. The late Eiko Ishioka's costumes are beautiful from the giant in a barbed wire minotaur helmet to the costumes of the gods themselves each individually garish and beautiful at the same time. The action is fantastic and well shot and the film is astounding to watch. And the action while nothing astounding is well shot and suitably bloody (watch a scene where Ares smashes the heads of five villains). Its all fun to me.
Which is why the hours after viewing the movie is when the disappointment sets in. For all of the vision on display the plot itself feels a bit nonsensical at times with set pieces thrown in that look great (Poseidon's tsunami dive is amamzing but why did Theseus and his companions actually go to sea when they easily make the trip overland afterwards). The characters are sketchy at best with at least Henry Cavill providing and decent hero as Theseus while  Mickey Rourke is a decent villain. Others aren't so well drawn with Frida Pinto continuing to be pretty face without any real depth as an actress and Stephen Dorff as the plucky sidekick. The motivations of Luke Evan's Zeus are confounding and I'm sure I missed the reason there seemed to be only about six gods on Olymphus. The story hurts a fun movie and really leaves me wishing Tarsem had thrown caution to the wind shot the film with more flare towards the garish and surreal.
In the end while the film isn't great its the kind of pop entertainment I'll grudgingly admit is kind of a guilty pleasure for me.",1328227200,3,2265,4.510948905109489

Mickey Rourke was just incredible as the evil and merciless Hyperion, who just about brutally murdered everyone in his way. Henry Cavill was convincing as Theseus but could have done a bit better. Luke Evans was great as a younger-looking Zeus, and Freida Pinto was just beautiful eye candy as Phaedra, one of Hyperion's virgin oracles. As this film is impossible to not be compared to 300, i have to say, i think this one wins the war; 300 was a very incredible ACTION movie, but not as a whole complete film. It gave us a tiny bit of story in the beginning, little character development, and all action throughout the second and third acts of the film. Immortals on the other hand, mixed the action with story, carefully pacing the awesome visuals and fighting with dialogue and confrontations between characters. The visuals, by the way, were top-notch and i have no idea why it didn't make it onto the list for Best Visual Effects for the Oscars. I have to say though, it was mainly disappointing because of its short run time, but if they release a sequel, i am fully on-board for it, as a sequel is needed to complete this large and expanding story that preserves the classic ""Gods needing a mortal hero"" story line.

4416135,3,B004LWZW8S,"One encouraging thing I draw from having watched THE IMMORTALS: Henry Cavill looks like he's got the presence and physical goods to play Kal-El. As Theseus, he cuts a fine and dashing figure, even if the script doesn't exactly call for him to exert his acting chops. ""Look noble and heroic,"" the screenplay directs him, and dude does. And when Theseus loses a dear one, ""Look desolate, but keep those abs flexed tight."" And dude does. THE IMMORTALS treats us to remarkable visual artistry, insults us with phenomenally dull storytelling. And if you're into Greek mythology, fuggetaboutit. Director Tarsem Singh Dhandwar may have been aware of Greek mythology, but he's only ever read the cliff notes. In a saga featuring a hero named Theseus, he gets props for sneaking the minotaur in. And he does sort of get this next bit right: Untold milennia ago, in heaven, the immortal gods waged a mighty war amongst each other. The losers - who came to be known as the Titans - were cast down into Tartarus.

Ah, jiminy, but the film looks friggin' gorgeous and is stunningly lit, like a lush Renaissance painting come to life. Tarsem Singh Dhandwar's visuals dazzle us from jump, starting with an ominous overhead view of the Titans caged in a box deep in the bowels of Tartarus, their teeth clamped onto metal rods. They've been held captive for eons. That's a long time for teeth clamping. But this foreboding sequence sets the proper epic mood.

In 1228 B.C. the vile king Hyperion (a menacing Mickey Rourke) aches to leave a lasting mark on the world and on history for ages to come. Reviling the gods, Hyperion seeks to free the Titans. But to accomplish this, he requires the long-vanished Epirus bow, a weapon which bestows uncanny marksmanship upon its wielder and which manifests arrows made of devastating energy. Hyperion stalks the breadth of Greece - which, in ancient times, was apparently composed of towering cliffsides - and razes each holy temple. He seeks the virgin Oracle (Freida Pinto) whose prophetic visions may lead him to the bow. All of Greece cowers at his approach, and one can't blame them folks. King Hyperion is sadistic. He isn't stingy with the eye-gouging and with directing his burly minions to hammer his victims in the sensitive area of the huevos rancheros.

Up on high, on Mount Olympus, the gods gaze down on Earth and marvel at the doings of man - and never mind that the closest we get to getting a tour of Mount Olympus is that ledge the Greek pantheon is always hanging out on, the gods' poses so artfully staged it reminds me of those television perfume ads: the Greek pantheon... by Calvin Klein. Whenever the camera cuts to the heavens, here the gods are, on that ledge. Maybe they're renovating Mount Olympus? They're putting in a skylight. The gods, golden-hued and perfect, are debating whether they should interfere with Hyperion's plot. But Zeus (Luke Evans) calls upon an age-old pact, one which decrees that the gods may not interfere with man's destiny unless the Titans themselves stick their noses in. But unbeknownst to the other gods, Zeus himself, in the guise of an old codger, had been walking in man's world. He's been tutoring a fearless young peasant in the ways of the warrior. He's got big plans for Theseus.

The action is phenomenal, and about as well done as the slo-mo process can have it. Theseus is a man among men, but even he's no match for the gods. I admit to getting hyped up once the Greek gods joined the battle. I don't care what other action films debut this year. Nothing can beat the sight of Zeus unleashed, wrecking sh-- with his hammer and chain. The violence is amped up. Skulls are stoved in, torsos eviscerated, limbs ripped off, and all this done effortlessly by the gods.

I say, see this film simply to treat your eyeballs. The story itself carries a sense of detachment, and don't be surprised to find yourself unengaged in the quieter moments. There are passages that drag and drag, impenetrable plot points, and characters that surface and then vanish. I may have even glimpsed the evil preacher from HAVEN, but don't quote me on that. Tarsem Singh Dhandwar, in his eagerness to get to the visual money shots, settles for a shaky cobbling together of narrative structure and character development. What we see onscreen is awesomely awesome, a mastery of visual composition. But it might as well serve as an extended music video for some heavy metal band. Not even THE POLAR EXPRESS left me as numb.",1323043200,2,4489,4.75

Here's the scoop. Theseus (Henry Cavill) needs to find the Epirus Bow before King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) finds it and uses it to set the Titans free to decimate all mankind. Theseus will get help from a virgin oracle and the Gods themselves to accomplish this mission.

I like the director Tarsem Singh. His first outing ""The Cell"" was a decent script with a great look. His follow-up ""The Fall"" was a great script with a great look. ""Immortals"" seems more the child of the producers. It looks as though they were trying to capitalize on the success of their earlier ""300."" The overall look is very similar but I have to imagine Singh had a big hand in this. The costumes and set design are extensions of his earlier efforts. This movie looks great. Every shot is a feast for the eyes. The effects are seamless and the slow motion violence is really cool. Seeing heads explode like this is.....unique.

Cavill has a good, heroic screen presence. Rourke plays a great villain. He is so casual about killing it made my skin crawl. Freida Pinto as Phaedra is a real knockout. Stephen Dorf was good as Stavros but he seemed out of place somehow. John Hurt and Stephen McHattie were good in their small-ish rolls. One review I read complained about the slowness of it. I can't say I disagree but, at the same time, I wasn't getting fidgety so it mustn't have been too bad. This is an epic, myth based movie. Tarsem Singh does a lot to bring the sense of myth to the look and feel of it all. I'm chomping at the bit to see his upcoming ""Mirror Mirror.""

I cannot say I liked this quite as much as ""300"" but this is still a heck of a ride. When it hits Blu-Ray I will definitely add it to my library. It will stand up to repeat viewings.",1322438400,2,1920,4.354748603351955
4416177,3,B004LWZW8S,"The visual style of Director Tarsem Singh (""The Fall"") in this cheesy sandal action thriller has been compared to ""300"" of a few years ago.  In fact the producers of that film, are prominently mentioned in the various trailers.  The comparison is valid in some respects.  The movie is saturated in sepia tones and coloration as it was to some degree in the aforementioned ""300.""  This film however overloads us with CGI mountains, valleys and cliffs.  I'm no expert in Greek mythology so I'll defer on the accuracy of the gods and their roles in the storyline.  The story as it were, involves King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) wanting to obtain a magic bow that will enable him to kill everybody in Greece and release the Titans who have been captives of the gods for ""eons.""  The gods, led by Zeus (Luke Evans) would like to stop him but can't get involved in human stuff.  Zeus, however can transform himself into a human and does so in the old man body of John Hurt.  The old man discovers the one human that can lead them against Hyperion.  That is Theseus played by Henry Cavill who will be the next Superman and was so good in ""The Tudors"" series on the Showtime Network.  Theseus reluctantly leads the Helenics after a chance meeting with Phaedra, the virgin oracle who can see into the future.  She is played by the beautiful Frieda Pinto and her unnamed body double (nude scene).  I thought that once Phaedra lost her virginity her seer ability went with it, but not the case.  The other soldier in this little band is Stavros (Stephen Dorff).  Dorff was award-worthy in a little seen and generally unappreciated movie from 2010 called ""Somewhere.""  His reward is to play comic relief in this blockbuster wannabe.  The movie isn't downright terrible, but it is no ""300."" Those who like the genre will get their fill of blood and gore complete with severed limbs and heads.  Hordes of half naked men flailing swords and spears are pretty much non-stop.  Brain numbing stuff but moderately entertaining.",1322438400,,2006,4.696275071633238
4416178,2,B004LWZW8S,"One thing is certain about ""Immortals""; it doesn't relate the traditional Greek myth about the noble-born hero Theseus, future ruler of Athens.  Instead, it's about an illegitimately born (as a result from rape!) Greek hero Theseus (Henry Cavill) who is destined to battle the utterly ruthless King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) for the ultimate weapon of mass destruction, the Epirus Bow, and to protect Greece from his bloodthirsty conquest.  Therefore, the main plot is painfully simple, but the movie's execution of it is murky, illogical, and brainlessly savage.

Personally, I would have preferred the straightforward telling of the conventional Theseus myth, which certainly has enough drama, adventure, fantasy, tension, and passion to satisfy almost any cinema enthusiast.  I don't understand why any action director wouldn't follow this route.  Instead, we once again witness ""300""-style graphic mutilations, outrageous headgear and armour, and portentous prophecies that ultimately seem pretentious and ridiculous.  Cavill's Theseus is appropriately courageous, resolute, and self-sacrificing.  However, he is eventually overwhelmed by the filthy tide of dismemberings, stabbings, lacerations, and other tortures the supporting cast and he himself dishes out and endures.  Furthermore, Rourke's Hyperion overshadows Theseus and the whole movie with his unquenchable savagery, especially when his henchmen fail him, which they inevitably do.  It really doesn't make sense to be lethally P.O.'d enough at a henchman who is unsuccessful, especially when the henchman's failure is not really his fault and you may need that henchman in the future.

To some degree, the panoramic cinematography and the constant parade of sculpted, athletic bodies (both men and women) compensates for ""Immortals""'s ""warrior porn"".  That especially goes for the luscious oracle Phaedra (Freida Pinto), who aids Theseus with her prophecies and obligingly (through a stunt double, I just learned) displays her stunning back nudity by disrobing to share an intimate moment with our cursed/blessed hero.  But pretty pictures can only take you so far.  A movie, even a mythological fantasy, must have narrative coherence and integrity.  However, even people familiar with Greek mythology (as I am) will be lost at sea trying to figure out who's who and whether they're a mortal or a god.  Well, I at least figured out that the charaters wearing the golden armor were the Olympian gods, but with the exception of Zeus (Luke Evans) and Athena (Isabel Lucas), I couldn't tell them apart.  Likewise, Theseus's and King Hyperion's respective warriors were interchangeable, shield-banging, testosterone-fueled beefcake, except for maybe that brute in the Minotaur armor who battles Theseus for the bow.  In fact, the only ""normal"" person in the movie was the old man (John Hurt), who tutored Theseus as a youth in the arts of combat and, as I found out afterwords on Wikipedia and not from the movie, was Zeus in mortal disguise.

""Immortals"" is illogical and inconsistent in other ways.  For example, Zeus proclaims and vows that the gods will not directly interfere in mortal affairs, but they do just that when Theseus and his army confront not just Hyperion, but also the ""Titans"" (snicker) whom he frees from Tartarus with the bow.  Also, when Hyperion wrests the bow (which fires its own nuclear-strength energy arrows) from Theseus, why doesn't he use it to destroy Theseus's fortress and spare his army from entering the bottleneck where Theseus's army lies in wait?  With the bow, why does Hyperion need an army at all?  Furthermore, Phaedra owes her precognitive skills to her virginity; if she loses her virginity, she loses her power to view the future.  However, even after her night of passion with Theseus, Phaedra still seems capable of predicting danger for Theseus.  Returning back to the ""Titans"", they seemed like normal-sized men.  For Zeus's sake, Titans are giants, as large as the four colossal statues in the movie.  I thought THEY would come to life as the Titans.

Sigh!  Oh well, ""Immortals"" will play well to frat boys, jocks, and other macho types, as well as to sadomasochistic iron bondage fetishists.  But serious mythological scholars and other sensible, logical people will shake their heads in disbelief at ""Immortals""'s blood-drenched, bloated spectacle.",1322438400,4,4364,5.3952802359882
4416179,5,B004LWZW8S,"Friday after Thanksgiving my darling and I went to the AMC theater to watch the ""Immortals"" in 3D.

During my school years I have read a lot about Greek gods and next day after watching the movie I picked up the myth book to refresh it... the Olympic Games, honoring gods, were named after Mount Olympus. On the top of it all powerful Zeus sat on a golden throne and ruled other gods and humans with his cord of gold. The myths, legends and sanctuaries of the Greeks celebrated their gods.

""Immortals"" directed by Tarsem Singh immersed me into timeless themes of good vs. evil, fear vs. courage, love vs. cruelty, brutality of fight vs. wisdom of fight... Some scenes in the movie were just magnificent:
- god plunging from Mt. Olympus into the sea;
- all scenes with Epirus Bow and arrows;
- child's visions concluding the movie.

Important role of women in ancient Greek civilizations was debated at large by late UCLA's archeologist Marija Gimbutas highly valued by Joseph Campbell - read the Foreword to ""The Language of Goddesses"". ""Star Wars"" by George Lucas were solidly grounded in J. Campbell's mythology research. ""Immortals"" reminded me of the role of oracle - priestess Phaedra - and did it in a vibrant context of the war between the  Hyperion, the Heraklion King of Crete, and Theseus, taught and protected by Zeus himself (read plot and details on Immortals at Wikipedia).

The movie brings us also to the discussion of why gods support some mortals and abandon others, why free will is the key in reaching our goals toward liberation and prosperity. Those questions are relevant today as well as what does it mean to be competitive today?

Vivid contrasting colors, use of light vs. darkness, 3D dynamics, even the symbolic ""blood"" scenes (because you know that Gods are immortal)... - all this created unforgettable experience which we enriched by debating lines, scenes and meanings all weekend at home. I have to say that no other movie on Greek mythology made so huge impression on me.

Congratulations to film creators at Universal Pictures and Relativity Media.

Ms. Pinto's face could have launched a thousand ships. That would have been better than just about any flick. She is so hot and so sweet. Made her in a heartbeat. The same for the human appearing robot/transformer siren in Transformers, Isabel Lucas.

4416246,3,B004LWZW8S,"""Immortals"" is one of those movies that some may hate and some will love, but it certainly has some qualities that everyone will find appealing at least to the eye. Based on Greek mythology, ""Immortals"" centers around a peasant man, named Theseus, played by Henry Cavill, who is certain to be a big star in the making and is the title character in the upcoming Superman movie ""Man of Steel"". Theseus, is a man of no importance who was instructed in the art of fighting by Zeus himself, in his human form, all in preparation of an impending war sparked by King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke). Hyperion seeks a weapon forged in the heavens by Ares called the Epirus Bow. This weapon, and this weapon alone can free Titans, imprisoned within the walls of Mount Tartaros, Titans that will undoubtedly destroy mankind and destroy the world of the Greek Gods.

So, that being said, ""Immortals"", as you can tell, is tailored made for the fantasy, mythological, epic loving movie patron. In the tradition of ""Clash of the Titans"" and similar, but not the same as ""300"", ""Immortals"" is designed from top to bottom with beautiful scenery, colors, costumes and epic battles. The battle scenes may be the biggest highlight of the movie. Although the battle scenes are violent, it wouldn't be realistic if they weren't, and quite frankly, most moviegoers expect that sort of thing. In the movie ""300"" slow motion and disbelief were elements used to portray how so few men defeated so many. ""Immortals"" uses those same slow motion elements, but there is nothing left to the imagination as to how these battles are won.

The movie, directed by Tarsem Singh, who has displayed his talent quite brilliantly in such movies as ""The Cell"" and ""The Fall"", which won many cinematography awards, is gifted with incredible visuals from top to bottom. The mood and is ably captured and the actors are better than most you would see in movies like this, but ""Immortals"" isn't without flaw.

Despite all the story elements that are in place, with oracles, bows, titans, battles, revenge, Greek gods and impending wars, the movie is horribly predictable and simple. Every move is telegraphed. When they tell you the significance of something, you know how it will play out and your first impression is the correct one. Finally, as epic as the movie is, and maybe much of it was shot on a green screen, but it seemed that in the entire movie, there were only 4 or 5 sets and they used them over and over.

""Immortals"" will visual candy and entertaining for the most part. The audience member looking to just take your mind off things for a while and enjoy a spectacle, you won't go wrong. If you're looking to be challenged or be on the edge of your seat, it won't happen. The movie isn't without merit, but it is only for some.",1321747200,2,2793,4.682281059063136

4416248,1,B004LWZW8S,"Tarsem Singh is a true visual artist. His films include The Cell and The Fall. Both are visually striking, dramatically satisfying films, at once riveting and horrific. Both films contain unforgettable images. The Cell is a masterpiece of abhorrent beauty. The Fall is a haunting piece of eye candy with a heart-wrenchingly powerful story at its core. Tarsem is a talented man - yet it seems that he has finally decided to sell out, to squander his talents on mainstream macho-trash.

The Immortals comes from the same ilk as 300, meaning that it's an overproduced action film, largely filmed using green screen technology, opting for style over substance. It tells the tale of Thesius, a young mortal who is sent on a mission from Zeus. The objective is to lead an army against King Hyperion, an evil tyrant who is trekking across Greece to obtain a coveted weapon - a magical bow and arrow, no less - which has the power to release the titans and annihilate all of humanity.

Throughout the course of the film, Thesius crushes a few skulls, deflowers an innocent oracle, annoys the gods to no end, and unsuccessfully attempts to rescue his mother from the likes of Mickey Rourke, who shatters a man's testicles with a croquet mallet for kicks, and wears an awkward little mask with unnecessarily large horns throughout the majority of the film. Speaking of which, there isn't a character in this film that doesn't get to wear a funny hat. Lampshades, snail and clam shells, chandelier prisms - anything is up for grabs in the hat department, according to the costume designer of The Immortals.

The acting is mediocre from all involved. Mickey Rourke is simply miscast. He grumbles and mumbles his lines. He seems bored and indifferent. Henry Cavill shows plenty of machismo and gets to scream and twirl around in slow motion a lot. As for Stephen Dorff - well, I'm still not sure what he is doing in this film. As with Rourke, he seems out of his element. The writing leaves much to be desired. This film contains laughably inept dialogue, and the characters are poorly realized. The visuals may be three-dimensional, but you can't say the same for the people on the screen.

The direction is frustratingly dull. There is definitely some eye candy to be seen, but it does not feel like a Tarsem film. It feels like a Zack Snyder rip-off. That is nothing to be proud of.

4416249,2,B004LWZW8S,"One reviewer called IMMORTALS, ""an orgy of severed heads,"" and that's pretty much the basis for the film, though I only counted a dozen or so heads flying about by the movie's end. IMMORTALS tells the story of Theseus, slayer of the Minotaur, but bears little resemblence to any Greek myth. Granted Theseus did slay the Minotaur, but in IMMORTALS, the Minotaur is a man wearing the shroud of a bull in service to Hyperion--whom Theseus never encountered--and the plot is the war of the Titans versus the Olympian gods--a war the Theseus of myth was absent from. The interpretation of myth didn't bother me much, but it did leave for a confusing mesh of Greek stories.

The biggest error of the film was in the massive, gaping, bleeding plot holes. One: When you are the Evil Overlord Hyperion and you have captured the Virgin Oracle that you require to find your Bow of Epicness, you should be smart enough to leave some guards around the holding cell. Two: When sending your armies into a tunnel to die in the bottleneck, you might instead consider sending them up the nearby stairs, you know, the ones Hyperion took uncontested to the top of the wall where he could let loose the Titans, guard-free. Three: When you shout a warning, ""It's a trap,"" don't proceed to follow the trap-ee into his demise. Four: I really want to know where the Virgin Oracle was carrying around poison antidotes; all I can figure is she must have magical Virgin Oracle Sex Powers. Just sayin'.

Redeeming the film was the acting of Mickey Rourke as King Hyperion. The man pulled off creepy, sadistic, psycho-king-on-a-mission with style... despite the funny hats he was forced to endure. I mean, who puts a lobster claw on their head?

Another good point: muscled, oiled, man-cakes. Hundreds of them. Enough said.

The film aims at a deeper meaning, the granting of immortality through deeds, hence the title. However, IMMORTALS is mostly a spectacle for the eye, combining silly god-hats and bloody slaughter in CGI'ed glory without a lot of depth. I found myself enjoying the film, if only for the headless montage and the giggles it induced. Recommended only as a rental, and only if you want some good, mindless bloodshed.

4416250,4,B004LWZW8S,"Immortals is plain and simply a fun take on Greek mythology. After the Gods fail to answer his prayers, King Hyperion searches for the Epirus Bow in order to release the Titans and destroy the human race. It is up to young Theseus to become the leader he was meant to be and stop this mad King. Sure, the story is thin and the dialogue isn't groundbreaking, but man did those fight scenes deliver the goods. It basically combines elements from Clash of the Titans and 300, only with more blood and extended combat scenes where you can actually see the damage being inflicted. Due to popular demand in the comments section, the next sentence is a SPOILER. I absolutely loved the scene where the Gods came down and fought the Titans at the end. What a beautiful display of visually gory bliss. The CGI was mostly used to great effect, which was a shocker. The way Mount Olympus was portrayed was the best version I have seen, with very little cloud coverage.

The acting from Henry Cavill (aka the new Superman) was more solid than expected, but I thought Mickey Rourke stole the show as the evil King Hyperion. He is the most ruthless and intimidating villain I've seen in recent memory. Darth Vader looks like a nice leader in comparison, because if you fail this guy, you will die in a very unpleasant manner guaranteed. At least Vader gave that dude more than one chance.

4416251,1,B004LWZW8S,"Watching Immortals is like eating a big platter full of candy and sugary sweets. There's plenty to look at and many savoury sweets to indulge in... Only for you to not realize that by the time it's all over and done with, you'll be left with a lingering stomach ache. Which is exactly what is the problem with all types of candy; eye candy or the actual food itself. It's not until you're finished devouring such huge portions of it you realize you've absorbed absolutely nothing.

I have nothing at all against Tarsem Singh, an amazingly talented and visionary director. I loved The Cell, even though it was a bit mind-screwy (though as soon as it's done, you realize what was real and what was not). Every shot in that film was to die for, starting with the opening frame of Dead Vlei. The Fall was a movie that I managed to stumble upon by accident on IMDb. I watched the trailer and quickly decided ""I must see this!"". Soon after I rented the DVD, watched it, and thought ""holy crap, that was amazing.""

So as you may or may not be able to tell, I went into Immortals solely due to Singh's namesake, and the one thing that entered my mind as soon as his name appeared over the closing credits was ""did someone hold a gun to his head and force him to direct this boring 'movie'?""

It really is a shame. I love Greek mythology, and I thought Singh would be able to carry a Greek mythology themed film well. Let's say he did well with the visuals part; his trademark visual brilliance is all over this film. Every single frame of the movie is a work of art in itself. That said, the script is so agonizingly slow, boring and disgustingly patronizing.

Sure there's a lot of holes in the mythos- Theseus being a bastard, the sacred bow, etc. But those are the least of the films problems. The story and sequence of events plays as if it were adapted from a gore-obsessed 10 year old's paper on Greek mythology. One particularly insulting plot hole comes from the bow- when Theseus buries his dead mother in the cave, we are to assume the bow chose him and deemed him worthy of using the bow itself- yet Hyperion can use it without problem?!

The acting is insultingly awful. Cavill seems to think that just standing there and looking handsome and what not is acting. And while he is indeed a handsome fellow, he fits the role of Theseus in looks only. He barely emotes throughout the film, and even the one scene (where he watches his mother get killed) isn't enough to redeem his boring performance. Freida Pinto does an alright job though her performance wasn't nothing we saw in Slumdog Millionaire or Rise of the Planet of the Apes. And I have a gigantic man crush on Mickey Rourke, but he was just hilariously bad. He rehashed his performances from Iron Man 2 and Sin City, and the result was not good.

The film plods along at a snail's pace. We get a handful of action, and all are very short. Even the battle scene at the end was boring as frack. The slow, sedated pace wouldn't be such a problem if the dialogue weren't so awful. The dialogue sounds like an immature 14 year old wrote it, and I wouldn't be surprised if one did. The exploding heads scene was awesome, but that was it.

In short, guys will go see Immortals for the battle sequences and gods fracking stuff up, and girls will go see it for the guys walking around, letting their abs/muscles be the center of attention, neither of which being anything they wouldn't get from viewing the IMDb publicity stills for the movie- something they can do for free. Well, girls, if your boyfriend takes you to this movie, swiftly pull him aside and tell him ""maybe you and me being together just isn't working out for either of us..."". Guys, if your group of buddies drags you to this movie, immediately cut all ties with them and inform them that they're idiots.

This is how the story goes: The brutal and bloodthirsty King Hyperion and his murderous Heraklion army are rampaging across Greece in search of the long lost Bow of Epirus. With the invincible Bow, the king will be able to overthrow the Gods of Olympus and become the undisputed master of his world. With ruthless efficiency, Hyperion and his legions destroy everything in their wake, and it seems nothing will stop the evil king's mission. As village after village is obliterated, a stonemason named Theseus vows to avenge the death of his mother in one of Hyperion's raids. When Theseus meets the Sybelline Oracle, Phaedra, her disturbing visions of the young man's future convince her that he is the key to stopping the destruction. With her help, Theseus assembles a small band of followers and embraces his destiny in a final desperate battle for the future of humanity.

4416253,5,B004LWZW8S,This is a very cool movie. I love many types of gladiator style movies and this movie was just awesome. A lot of battles and kicking butt. The only flaw I found is that they just show and mention a few of the gods. I was hoping to see more of them fight.,1320969600,2,254,3.811320754716981
4416254,4,B004LWZW8S,"This film is not a masterpiece but that does not mean that it is a horrible film. The fight sequences were done very well. the story flowed right along, What i liked about the film is that we get to see henry cavill who will be playing the man of steel in the new superman film coming in 2013 in action. He really does have the look for playing superman. I do not want to give away anything but if you go and see this movie and do not expect an epic epic film then this movie can be enjoyable.",1320969600,,493,3.94
4416255,3,B004LWZW8S,"Western literature has been mining Greek mythology ever since the time of the Romans, but the last few years have seen a volume of screen adaptations not seen since Ray Harryhausen was in his prime.  The start of the 2000s saw a couple of films set in Ancient Greece but without the gods (""Troy"", most notably, then ""300"", though the latter adopted an oft-copied stylized book that had little to do with reality either), which gave way to myth-based adventures (the ""Clash of the Titans"" remake, the adaptation of ""Percy Jackson and the Olympians""; incidentally, though that latter film was bad, I highly recommend the books it was based on).  ""Immortals"" has, based on the trailers, been pegged as a ""300"" knockoff with the gods present.  There are certainly some similarities, but Singh's visual sense is ultimately much different than Zack Snyder's was (there's a lot more beauty and colour in this world, for starters, whereas Snyder's emphasized earth tones and grime.  Plot details are discussed hence, so be warned for spoilers.

In Hellenas (Greece), our hero is Theseus (Henry Cavill, the future Superman) - actually, to get this out of the way, the film uses a bunch of mythological characters' names (Theseus, Phaedra, Lysander, Hyperion), but the characters in question haven't any real relation to their mythological counterparts - the bastard son of a village woman.  When the evil Heraclean king, Hyperion (Mickey Rourke, surprisingly not out of place in the ancient setting, though the heavy stylization doubtless facilitates that), sacks his village and kills his mother, Theseus finds himself in the company of Phaedra (""Slumdog Millionaire""'s Freida Pinto, on duty as the love interest for the second time this year; she has more to do here than in ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"", though that was the superior film), the virgin Oracle, who has prophesied that he will play a crucial role in the war between Hyperion and the gods (he seeks to unleash the Titans and end the reign of the Olympians, in revenge for the deaths of his family).  Hyperion, meanwhile, seeks Phaedra, who can reveal to him the location of the Epirus Bow, a fabled weapon of immense power.  A quite exceptional amount of violence ensues.

As a story with characters, it's pretty minimal, but I imagine anyone going into it expected that.  I will, nonetheless, comment on the plot in one aspect:  in the past I've encountered films where the hero's only heroism was all about stopping an evil that they had accidentally caused, which often doesn't come across as especially heroic; ""Immortals"", on the other hand, features a hero who *fails* to stop anything.  Theseus would have to be considered the least successful action hero since Indiana Jones in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (if Dr. Jones had gone on an extended vacation to Yugoslavia, would the ultimate result have been very different at all?) - in fact, you can build a pretty good case that if Theseus had done nothing at all things would have turned out better, since his only meaningful action was finding the Epirus Bow and then losing it so that Hyperion could use it to free the Titans.  The gods defeat the Titans, and Theseus' killing of Hyperion is meaningless since the villain would have been killed along with his armies when Zeus collapsed the mountain.  Sure, he was brave, but what did he actually accomplish in the grand scheme of things?

Henry Cavill is a credible hero, and has great pecs (certainly, he feels less over-the-top than did Gerard Butler in ""300"", though I'm not sure whether he actually is).  The aforementioned Rourke is a menacing villain, aided by the director letting him do some memorably gory things to make an impression.  Freida Pinto, as I said, gets more to do here than in her last blockbuster, and I'd say she does fairly well with the movie's main female part (the movie never pretends that the petite Pinto is an action hero either, which I appreciated after too many movies featuring waifs with the combat skills of a Green Beret), though it's hardly a demanding role.  Pinto is also, among the cast, the primary beneficiary of her director's aesthetic skill, as he finds many ways to showcase her beauty (a brief nude scene is not actually her, but there are many stunning images of her in a red dress).  The supporting cast includes Stephen Dorff as what I suppose is meant to be a Han Solo figure, Stavros, and Luke Evans, Isabel Lucas, and Kellan Lutz as gods.

Tarsem Singh is the real star of the proceedings, though.  He does some remarkable things with his camera, producing quite a few memorable images and setpieces.  His use of colour stands out repeatedly, particularly the aforementioned red dress that Pinto wears (which does a great job of staying clean even in the midst of a typhoon of oil that coats everything else).  His rendering of Mount Olympus is by far the best I've ever seen on film - there's not a trace of the simple fluffy clouds populated by people wearing bedsheets so often seen in older films; pure majesty.  For all the inventive fight scenes, though, I don't understand how Zeus (Evans) could go the whole movie without using his thunderbolt even once (though he proves adept with chains).

As a story, this is lacking in numerous respects, but as a visual experience it's quite a marvel.  I came away thinking that Singh could perhaps be a great director if would devote as much care to his stories as to the images used to tell them.  As it is, we have a visually stunning mediocrity.",1320969600,73,5522,4.791359325605901
