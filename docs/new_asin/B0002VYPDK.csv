8323907,3,B0002VYPDK,"The Daichis is very clearly a superhero parody. The mood is pretty much The Incredibles via The Simpsons or Southpark. There is a lot of vulgar and potty mouth humour and behaviour here and thus clearly not for small children or those easily offended. The show is well animated and the battles are quite pretty and filled with energy. The Daichis are a very dysfunctional family on the verge of breaking up when they are chosen to defend earth from alien monsters who seem to only be interested in large scale destruction. They are given cards that allow them to transform into powersuits, each with its own abilities. They are supposed to work as a team to take down the monsters and only use flashy apocalyptic powers when absolutely necessary. To encourage this they are paid for each successful battle but charged each time they use a really flashy overkill power.  This family however, is so dysfunctional that it is rare that everyone even shows up for a battle, resulting in the use of many flashy overkill powers to win the day and thus a great deal of debt which adds to the family stress.

There is real pain in this show. Everyone behaves badly and I wanted to strangle everyone at some point, but they have good reasons for their dysfunctional behaviour and unfortunately make things worse by taking out their issues on everyone else. The show actually plays more like a tragedy than a comedy in many cases. This family is dysfunctional in a way that is painful to watch which kills some of the humour. Unlike most shows like this The Daichis does not end with a happy family, with everyone having learned their lesson. If anything the family is even more dysfunctional at the end of the series and only held together by a wicked early termination penalty clause in their contract. However, by the end, they seem to have embraced the fact that they are a dysfunctional family forced to stay together and fight for earth and accepted it as their reality.",1280275200,2,1965,4.659942363112392
