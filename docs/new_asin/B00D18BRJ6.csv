8588294,3,B00D18BRJ6,Good movie however I expected the quality of the film especially one from shemaroo to be much better. I mean it's a Madhubala and Dev Anand film for Pete's sake at the very least they could have restored the film before putting it out there for fans of both like myself to purchase. I Loved the movie but the dvd could've been much better.,1434412800,,339,4.3125
