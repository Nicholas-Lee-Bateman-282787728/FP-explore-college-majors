6877076,5,B00QMWEHOU,"A new grandchild we babysit prompted me to purchase this video. I believe that it will be enjoyed based upon the many positive reviews on Amazon. My wife and I watched about half and can see where this video will be well received by our new addition.

Too many of our children videos are geared for our older grandchild so I desired to have this one for the new child. At the price this is worth acquiring if you have - or antisipate having - very young children in your home.",1474934400,,476,4.230769230769231
