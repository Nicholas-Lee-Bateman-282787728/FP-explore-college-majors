8638202,1,B002P6XV7G,I bought both 1 and 2 of this series and was excited to get the complete set of Kurosawa but was sad to find out that there are no subtitles on these cd`s.... its sad since most of those movies or all of them are out with subtitles already but this blue ray set does not have it! and its being sold on amazon.com  and the .jp  site..... I thought that was strange!,1396051200,25,364,3.9726027397260273
