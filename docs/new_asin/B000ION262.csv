2659677,5,B000ION262,"Excellent.  A must for any Flyers fan.  Very disappointed that they still hold a grudge against Eric Lindros as there were more that 10 games that could have made the cut with him, especially the winning game against the Rangers to get to the Cup finals against Detroit.  Nice to hear Gene Hart again though.",1184284800,,308,4.5636363636363635
2659678,5,B000ION262,"I'll give this five stars for the general concept, and I'm certainly happy to see these games again.  But I disagree with some of the game selections.

First, only four of the ten games are home games (and only three at the old Spectrum).  There was a special magic of Spectrum games.

Second and related...there were other games that really could have been added instead:

- Game 6 of the Conference finals against Quebec, in May of 1985, when Dave Poulin scored a shorthanded goal while the Flyers were two men short.  The Spectrum EXPLODED when Poulin beat Mario Gosselin high to the glove side.  Flyers won this game 3-0 to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals

- Game 5 of the Conference finals against Boston, in May of 1976, when Reggie Leach scored 5 goals at the Spectrum.

There are a few others I could mention, but those are the two biggest, and certainly could have been chosen over some of the more recent road games. I see there's a new DVD coming out in April on the history of the Flyers - hopefully it will cover some of these classic moments.",1172102400,12,1058,4.4404145077720205

2659730,3,B000ION262,"Good mix of classic vintage Flyers and more recent years.
Can't go wrong with this DVD set.
Only  issue is there is no games with Eric Lindros. This is who I grew up with and was disappointed that I couldn't relive the ""Big E"" days.",1356566400,,232,4.155555555555556
2659731,4,B000ION262,"This is a great collector's item for any die hard Flyers fan. To have the complete games of such unforgettable moments in Flyers' history (the Cup wins, the 1987 Game 7 against Wayne Gretzky's Oilers) is priceless. But the whole package will seem hugely biased to any true Flyers' fan. Missing are any games representing the years from 1988 through 1999: namely the Lindros Era. I don't know if Flyers' management was so anti-Lindros that they left the 90s out altogether, but included as two of the ten greatest Flyers' games ever are two games from their 2004 Conference Final run. ?! Really? That's more exciting than their 1997 Cup run with Lidnros? Or any game where the Legion of Doom dominated? Their return to the playoffs in Lindros' MVP season of 1995? The last three games in the set are only passingly interesting because you know the players all left and never made it to the Finals. It's a shame we don't have a DVD to commemorate those amazing Lindros Era teams in this set.",1327017600,5,989,4.625

2659733,5,B000ION262,This certainly is a terrific set.  I would quibble with a few of the game choice however.  There are no games from the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals season and two games from 2004.  But overall it is a wonderful collection of past games and memories and I would definitely recommend it for any Flyers fan,1302825600,,298,4.381818181818182

2659736,5,B000ION262,This is an excellent series put out by the NHL.  Unlike the Penguins series it covers games from over a 30 year period of Flyers history.  So one can see the Flyers clinching the cup in the mid 70's to a the modern day pre lockout Flyers.  Plus one gets to the Soviet Union at the height of their hockey power as well.,1212192000,,318,4.015873015873016
2659737,5,B000ION262,"I don't know why but i've always liked the Flyers. Maybe they were hyping up Eric Lindros and I thought ""Cool."" but The Flyers have been my favorite team since I can remember. Ive stuck with the Flyers even though they had lost mostly every game last year, goaltenders who are great in regular season but cant cut it in the playoffs, and ever since Lindros was captain- every captain of the Flyers have got injuried, traded, or retired. Ive stuck with them but I cant say im a ultimate Flyers fan, I was not born in there glory days of the 70's. I love this set and it might not be the greatest games but Flyers fans choose them, so they must know something. I think it sucks they don't have a game with Eric Lindros or the Legion of Doom line from the time I proclaimed them my favorite team. A very good set and I highly recommend it to any Flyer's fan.",1201132800,3,855,4.1878787878787875
2659738,3,B000ION262,"I'm withholding 5 stars from this otherwise outstanding compilation simply because of the obvious flip of the bird the Flyers gave to Lindros by *not* including at least one game from his Legion of Doom days with the franchise.

The longstanding Flyers/Lindros battle notwithstanding, the fact remains, regardless of Flyers management's personal and professional differences with the Lindros family, Eric Lindros was an integral part of the Flyers' meteoric rise from the ashes when he was part of the team.  Blowing off his contribution to the team from that time doesn't undo the wins or history.",1198108800,3,598,5.21875

8146757,2,B000ION262,"I got this set as a Christmas gift back when it first came out, but never got the urge to watch it (and in fact I still haven't watched games 9 and 10 yet).  Now, I'm a die-hard Flyers fan.  Grew up with my parents watching them in the 70s and 80s, and once I graduated college, got a job and got married, I settled into the usual ""married guy"" habit of watching lots of sports on TV.  I've probably seen 90% or more of the Flyers' games since the mid-90s.  But the idea of watching these decades-old games when I already know the outcome just doesn't appeal to me much.  There's just too much ""dead space"" between the interesting parts of the games.

On the plus side, it's interesting to see the game from a time when no one wore helmets (surprising how many players had bald spots), the goalies stood up for the most part and had tiny-looking pads, and the game seemed to be played at about half the speed of the current NHL.  I'm wondering how many of the guys on those Stanley Cup winning teams of the 70s (not just the Flyers but any team) would even make it to the NHL today.

The down side is that the audio and video quality of some of these recordings are just brutal.  It's not until game 5 of this set that the picture and sound approach half-way decent.  It's kind of amazing they couldn't find better recordings of the deciding games of the Stanley Cup finals.  Some of the games are even missing parts of periods due to ""technical difficulties"".  The most glaring example of that is game 6, a Flyers/Rangers playoff game from 1985 - with less than 40 seconds left in the game and the Flyers clinging to a 1 goal lead, it just suddenly switches to that ""due to technical difficulties, portions of this game are unavailable"" card and then ends.  What the heck?  Why even include that game in the set if the ending is missing?  And the infamous 5-OT game is crammed onto one disc - DVDs are designed to hold about 2 hours of video, so putting an entire four and a half hour game onto one disc definitely causes some degraded video quality.  Oddly, about half-way through the first OT the picture suddenly gets letterboxed with black bars at the top and bottom - maybe it was some method of cramming more video onto one DVD?

For several of the games, you get a national broadcast team or the opposing team's announcers.  On disc 5, after a bogus offsides call against the Flyers, the Bruins' announcer says ""Well, if that had been against Boston I'd be upset.  But it was against Philadelphia so...OK"" or something like that.  That can get a little annoying.  And I could have sworn I remembered watching that 5-OT game with the Flyers' announcers, but the version here is an ESPN broadcast (remember when they actually covered hockey?  Maybe this game is why they decided to stop, since it delayed SportsCenter by about three hours).

And as other reviews have pointed out, the set completely skips over the Eric Lindros years, which is when I first became a die-hard fan.

The whole set just seems to have been cheaply made, slapping together whatever footage they could find of the ""10 Greatest Games"" that were apparently selected by fan vote.  No bonus features, no introductions or commentary, not even any chapter breaks except for ""Period 1, Period 2, Period 3, OT"".  Personally, I would have much preferred a more nuanced 1 or 2 disc documentary that covered the team's history by showing highlights from the big games, rather than the entire games, with narration from a Flyers perspective, done by someone familiar with the team.  Hopefully we'll get something like that for the 50th anniversary.",1454025600,,3619,4.536209553158706

8146763,5,B000ION262,"I am not a fan of the Philadelphia Flyers.  I have never been a Flyers fan, and I don't expect that I ever will.  As a child in the mid 70s, I recall ripping up all my Philadelphia Flyer hockey cards on the night the Flyers beat my Canadiens thus ending their long undefeated streak.  As a teenager in 1980 and an Oliers fan, I recall how the Flyers killed the dream of an expansion team going to the next round of the playoffs. With all this negativity I have expressed about the Flyers, I should be the last person who would want to buy a DVD that toasts their glory.  What gives?

Here's the story. It is my contention that there are only three long-standing NHL teams that maintain strong fan support in good times and bad times. They are the Canadiens, Leafs, and Flyers. No, the Wings, Bruins, Rangers, and Hawks have all suffered stretches in my lifetime where a cannon could be fired in their home rink without endangering any spectators. Simply put, Flyer fans love their team with unconditional love. I repect them for that and thus have an admiration for a hockey team in the US that garners such love from its faithful fans.

Second, half of the games on this DVD are from the 1970s.  At that time I was a kid learning about the game, so I did not fully appreciate those games when I saw them when they were originally played.

Third, in 2007, I watched the 1972 Summit Series between Canada and the US for the first time since it was played. Along with the Esposito brothers and Whitey Stapleton, Bobby Clarke was game in and game out one of Canada's best players. My appreciation for him grew immeasurably after watching him in this series. Before that, I thought he was a dirty little rat bag of a player but who was also a rather capble GM. In this Flyers' DVD set, I hope I can further admire Clarke's skill, grit, and leadership. He was a great player whom we in Canada didn't see enough of when he was in his prime.

It is not nice to say, but as this DVD doesn't feature any games with Lindros, I consider it a strong buying point. Not a Lindros fan, and I do pity the Flyers for paying a king's ransom to obtain this clown.

I have just ordered this DVD, so I cannot comment on it having never seen it, so the 5 stars I give it are for anticipation of something enjoyable. If I am ever lucky enough to find myself in Philadephia, I very much hope to shake the hand of a real Flyers fan and let him or her know how glad I am for keeping the torch lit and held high.",1371945600,,2485,4.223628691983122
