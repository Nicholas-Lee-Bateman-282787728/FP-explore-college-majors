5058762,5,B00770PIU8,I really like this season even though there is competition with a rival PI agency the Simons are able to solve cases and help people in need.  Also there is alot of adveture and action in each episode.  This is a good addition to the collection.,1334534400,,245,4.304347826086956
5058763,3,B00770PIU8,"It's about time SHOUT released this 1986-87 Season of this detective drama out on DVD since SIMON & SIMON seemed to keep progressing more & more every year along with the fact that this was the last season with Rick and AJ's streetwise cop buddy Lt. Marcel ""Downtown"" Brown(Timothy Reid)from San Diego P.D. whom gets replaced by Lt. Abigail Marsh(Joan McMurtry)in the Fall of 1987 whom becomes the Simon Brothers police investigator buddy like the down-on-his-luck now pardoned ex-con turned private dick Jim Rockford had his often overwhelmed cop buddy Det. Dennis Becker(Joe Santos)from the LAPD on the ROCKFORD FILES.

Something else unique about this show that was quite intriguing was for one thing SIMON & SIMON was probably the first and only detective drama that took place in San Diego instead of L.A., New York City, or San Francisco.

For another; it was probably the first and only detective drama about 2 brothers who ran a private investigations agency together as well as one of the few detective dramas that had 2 private investigators working together, unlike most other private detective shows like THE ROCKFORD FILES, MAGNUM, P.I., MATT HOUSTON, and MANNIX since Jim Rockford(James Garner), Thomas Magnum(Tom Selleck), Matlock Houston(Lee Houston), and Joe Mannix(Mike Connors)were all private-eyes who worked solo.

For another; Rick and A.J. Simon lived quite an eccentric lifestyle kind of like Rockford did since the often skeptical Andrew Jackson Simon(Jameson Parker)lived in a house by himself and his short-tempered gonzo private dick brother Rick Simon(Gerald McRaney)lived on a boat in AJ's backyard kind of like Rockford lived in a rustic trailer by the beach in Malibu on a shoe-string budget & always kept his gun in a cookie-jar and commuted all around the L.A. Area in his snazzy bronze Firebird which often got racked up, plus the Simon Bros. charged $400 a day, plus expenses which was twice the going rate as Rockford which only charged his clients $200 a day, plus expenses, except the ROCKFORD FILES often pointed out what a joke Rockford's cash-flow problem was just like Rick's.

As a matter of fact, Gerald McRaney had 4 acting gigs on the ROCKFORD FILES in the episodes ""Sleight of Hand"", ""The Farnsworth Stratagem"", ""Rattlers Class of '63"", and ""Hotel of Fear"" before SIMON & SIMON even made its debut on CBS in the mid Fall of 1981 which is when Gerald McRaney became a star and Mary Carver which played Rick & AJ's suffering, but sweet mother(Cecilia Simon)made a guest starring appearance on the ROCKFORD FILES in the Spring of 1977 in the ""Dirty Money, Black Light"" episode.

SIMON & SIMON's 6th Season also had some pretty interesting guest stars in it like
*Mills Watson in the ""Competition-Who Needs It?"" episode after his co-starring days as the doofus Deputy Perkins on SHERIFF LOBO

*Anne Lockhart in the ""AWOL"" episode after her co-starring days as Lt. Sheba on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA

*Tricia Cast in the ""Eye of the Beholder"" episode during her co-starring days as Nina Chancellor on YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Clarence Gilyard, Jr. after his co-starring days as Ponch & Bobby's fellow California Highway Patrolman(Officer Benjamin Webster)on CHiPs and before his co-starring days on MATLOCK & on the police drama WALKER TEXAS RANGER

*Richard Anderson in the ""Act Five"" episode after his co-starring days as Agent Oscar Goldman on THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN and THE BIONIC WOMAN

*James Luisi in ""The Last Big Break"" episode after his co-starring days as Jim Rockford's hard-nosed nemesis(Lt. Doug Chapman)on THE ROCKFORD FILES and after his co-starring days on DAYS OF OUR LIVES

*Elisha Cook in the ""Treasure"" episode during his co-starring days as Ice Pick on MAGNUM, P.I.

*Lyle Waggoner in ""The Last Big Break"" episode after his co-starring days as Diana's faithful fellow agent(Maj. Steve Trevor)

*Richard Herd in ""The Rookie"" episode after his co-starring days on V-THE SERIES & after his co-starring days as Hooker & Romano's often skeptical superior officer(Capt. Dennis Sheridan)

*Gary Coleman in the ""Like Father, Like Son"" episode after his co-starring days as the spunky Arnold Jackson on DIFFERENT STROKES

*Parley Baer in ""The Case of Don Diablo"" episode after his co-starring days as Doc Appleby on THE DUKES OF HAZZARD

*Alan Hale, Jr. in the ""For Old Crimes Sake"" episode after his co-starring days as Skipper on GILLIGAN'S ISLAND

*Jenilee Harrison in the ""Just Because I'm Paranoid"" episode after her co-starring days as Chrissy's cousin(Cindy Snow)on THREE'S COMPANY

*Bill Boyett in the ""Judgement Call"" episode after his co-starring days as Sgt. MacDonald on ADAM-12

*Ray Walston in the ""For Old Crime's Sake"" episode after his co-starring days on MY FAVORITE MARTIAN

*William Bryant in the ""Opposites Attack"" episode after his co-starring days as Colt's director on THE FALL GUY

*Dirk Blocker in the ""Judgement Call"" episode after his co-starring days on BONANZA

*Thom Christopher in the ""Lost Lady"" episode after his co-starring days as Hawkman on BUCK ROGERS

*Vanna White doing a cameo appearance as herself in the ""Walking Point"" episode

It's just too bad that SIMON & SIMON never had guest stars like Joe Santos whom is known for his role as Rockford's often overwhelmed cop buddy(Det. Dennis Becker) and Magnum's other cop buddy(Lt. Nolan Page)in the last 2 seasons of MAGNUM, P.I.

It would've also been cool if SIMON & SIMON had Stuart Margolin which played Rockford's ex-con buddy(Angel Martin) and Noah Beery, Jr. known for his role as Rockford's long-time suffering retired truck driver on THE ROCKFORD FILES since they've all guest starred on MAGNUM as well as various other shows and detective dramas along with the fact that THE ROCKFORD FILES had inspired newer detective shows that premiered in the 1980's including SIMON & SIMON and MAGNUM, P.I.

You can also watch these episodes complete & uncut without all those commercial disruptions when SIMON & SIMON was shown in reruns on Cozi-TV, A&E, and WGN.",1330387200,6,6003,5.1
5058764,3,B00770PIU8,"First, don't get me wrong. I'm a simon and simon fan. I give the show 5 stars. But $50 , shout factory , that's price gouging. I won't be buying untill the price goes down. If that happens.",1330300800,3,189,4.0
5058765,4,B00770PIU8,"The last full season of Simon & Simon is here and it was worth the wait. Season Six would be a turning point for the series and saw the departure of Tim Reid and Daphne Maxwell, who both left at it's conclusion to work on another series, and Rick's dog Marlowe also made his final appearances during this season. Jeannie Wilson returns as Janet Fowler and the tone of the series began to change from easy-going to a more serious/message oriented show that was taken to extremes during season seven. The use of some classic 1960's music from The Beach Boys and Robert Palmer's 'Addicted To Love' were probably the reason this season was pulled from Shout!'s release schedule last year, saying only that the music rights were ""too expensive"". Thank you to Shout! for buying the rights to these songs and not just replacing them with less expensive generic music the way Universal has done with some of their TV show releases. The package design and layout is exactly the same as Season Five. No bonus features included, but if your like me and have seen only the syndicated versions of these episodes then seeing them UNCUT for the first time is a bonus in itself. The show ran on CBS for it's entire run but Shout! have mistakenly indicated on the back of the sleeve that it ran on NBC. Notable guest stars include Gary Coleman, Vanna White, Pamela Susan Shoop, Stuart Whitman, Tony Todd, Anne Lockhart, Jenilee Harrison, Dirk Blocker, Anthony James, Dennis Cole, Shawn Southwick and Ray Walston.

The price is high at $49.99 and this is a 6-disc set with the last two discs containing only three episodes each. Shout! could have brought the price down a little by releasing this as a 5-disc set by putting 5 episodes each on two discs and 4 episodes each on the other three discs. If you do plan on ordering be prepared to pay at least another $30 for shipping and handling.  It's also wise to buy directly from Shout! Factory since some second hand retailers are selling this title for over $70 and that doesn't include shipping. At $49.99 I almost feel like I got a deal.

5058771,1,B00770PIU8,"""Simon & Simon"" was such a marvelous, unique, humorous and fun detective television series.

Jameson Parker was perfect in the role of private investigator A.J. Simon.
Gerald McRaney was perfect in the role of private investigator Rick Simon.

Tim Reid and his real-life wife Daphne Maxwell-Reid both left ""Simon & Simon"" following the end of the sixth season.
They had both been in seasons three, four, five and six of ""Simon & Simon"".

Sadly, the sixth season would be the final season that Rick Simon's dog Marlowe made an appearance.

I believe that all 22 of the episodes from the sixth season of ""Simon & Simon"" are each missing at least one scene, that's why I didn't rate this DVD set higher than one star.

The teaser for the episode ""For Old Crime's Sake"" showed Jameson Parker's character A.J. Simon saying ""Eat Your Heart Out, Jimmy Cagney"", but somehow that scene wasn't even shown in the actual episode on this DVD release.
That scene was shown in its absolute entirety in the original CBS broadcast version of this episode.

There might be numerous other episodes on this Shout! Factory set that are missing some scenes that are shown in the teasers.
The teasers were included with all 22 of the episodes on this DVD set.

I believe that all 22 of the episodes from the sixth season would have probably run for 48 minutes and change if they were all presented in their original uncut CBS broadcast versions instead.

The sixth season of ""Simon & Simon"" originally aired on CBS from September 25, 1986 until March 26, 1987.

Here are the exact running times for all 22 episodes from ""Simon & Simon: Season Six"" on this Shout! Factory DVD release.

The songs ""In the Mood"" and ""As Time Goes By"" were both left intact in the episode ""Still Phil After All These Years""
on Disc #1 of this DVD set.

The Beach Boys' songs ""Surfin' USA"", ""Surfin' Safari"", ""Catch a Wave"" and ""In My Room"" were all left intact in the episode ""The Last Big Break""
on Disc #2 of this DVD set.

The picture quality and audio quality on this DVD set are both good.

The packaging that Shout! Factory used for ""Simon & Simon: Season Six"" is perfect.
Season Six is stored in a plastic DVD case that holds all six discs.
None of the discs share the same side of any of the disc holding trays and none of the discs overlap any of the discs  either.

Notable guest stars from the sixth season of ""Simon & Simon"" were Alan Hale Jr., Al Ruscio, Ann Doran, Belinda Montgomery,
Bruce Fairbairn, Charles Dierkop, Clarence Gilyard Jr., Clu Gulager, Daphne Maxwell-Reid, Darleen Carr, Deborah Walley,
