4271207,1,B0046ZGQQ2,The editing of the novela is very poor. Scenes do not flow well and major sections of the novela (Hasta que el dinero nos separe) with the 2 protagonists were excluded while other scenes that do not add anything to the plot are included.  I do not recommend this video.,1296777600,7,269,4.38
4271208,3,B0046ZGQQ2,"DVD is good. The only thing I really hated was the fact that they cut out a lot of scenes of the TV show. It is supposed to be longer than 13 hours. If I knew they were going to cut a lot of scenes out, I would have recorded the TV show from the beggining. I really love this TV show of Hasta Que El Dinero nos Separe. I am very disappointed that they cut out a lot of scenes from this DVD.",1293148800,6,390,3.6547619047619047

4271230,4,B0046ZGQQ2,We watched this over Christmas and it was adorable.  The acting was good and the characters were lovable.  It's family friendly and funny.  It opened my eyes to the importance of having car/medical insurance ;-),1394582400,2,211,4.9714285714285715
4271231,4,B0046ZGQQ2,"I like this soap opera because of the comedy and because the actors speak Spanish very clearly. This abbreviated collection is a bit disjointed because the four DVDs contain only about 9% (892 minutes) of the total time (9,720) of the 216 episodes of the series. The entire series has many episodes or portions of episodes that are a waste of time and are silly or outrageous. Probably about 30%-45% of the total time of the 216 episodes falls in this category. My guess is that if there had been 3,000 minutes of the series instead of just 892 in this collection, then this could have been a great representation of the entire soap. Cutting the material down to 892 minutes was too drastic. For those not familiar with Hasta Que El Dinero Nos Separe, the storyline might be hard to follow. For those who know the story, there is enough here to have many enjoyable memories brought back to mind.",1384473600,3,895,4.565217391304348

4271233,5,B0046ZGQQ2,The telenovela was not complete but I enjoyed it anyway because my beautiful best  actress Itati Cantoral was in all of it. This novela was the best entertaining soap I have ever seen.  Better then any other funny ones out there like Poe Ella Soy Eva????,1374019200,,254,4.5
4271234,4,B0046ZGQQ2,"Hasta que el dinero nos separe (Until Money do us Part - 830 minutes)

The story of Rafael and Alejandra begins as a fateful accident when Rafael crashes into Alejandra's car. Each is in the throes of a crucial financial deal and they both miss their deadlines. Thus, she sees him as a ruinous ""assassin"" and he sees her as a stuffed shirtbut a goddess.

He has to repay her for the damages and her medical bills. He's broke, so they make a deal: she hires him to work in her car dealership so he can pay her back. Watch her chase him around her office on crutches!

Soon love develops between the two but Alejandra's fianc&eacute;, Marco, and Rafael's girlfriend, Vicky, will do all they can to keep them apart. At one point he sings a song to her about wanting an 'old fashioned love, not one by e-mail.' No matter what travails are thrown in their path, they automatically take each other's part before they have second thoughts and start fighting again.

He has a dueling serenade scene with Marco that is hilarious. They both bring mariachi bands, but Marco's is BIGGER! Testosterone rules in this delightfully silly comedy! I'm so happy to see this is available through Amazon.",1367280000,,1183,4.592417061611374

4271242,4,B0046ZGQQ2,"Me Gusto Mucho el Dvd de esta Telenovela, Muy Dinamico, Contiene un Buen Resumen a pesar de que le faltan numerosas Escenas Importantes, pese a eso esta bien editado, tiene coherencia y se puede seguir perfectamente el hilo de la Historia. En cuanto a la Telenovela en si Esta Muy Buena, Muy Divertida, lo que a partir del Disco 3 cambia un poco los Matices, se centra mas en lo Dramatico que en la Comedia, no se si porque esta resumida asi o porque la historia despues tiene ese giro. El Dvd tiene tiene un Resumen de Ms de 14 Horas con las Mejores Escenas, Exactamente 892 Minutos, 14 Horas y 52 Minutos de Duracion. Lo Recomiendo, Vale la Pena!!!",1323475200,4,650,4.425
4271243,1,B0046ZGQQ2,"Mexican studios need to look south to, let's say, Argentina to learn how to create stories that not only entertain but elevate the intelligence of their country's audience. Whenever i watch Mexican TV or movies it's is always the same (always!) boob enhanced, shirt skirt, salon/cosmetologist primped, sexually unrealistically produced female roles. Sort of resembles a street bazaar selling fantasy that everyone down there (and transplants up here) have bought into. Also, a part of that fantasy world is a Catholic priest; a huge symbolic wedding; food and kids (in either order) and watching more of the same on the Tele.

It's always surprising to me how many of my Catholic cohorts end up later in life way overcompensating for their earlier childhood Church guided repression. Meanwhile the Church looks the other way as if the more of the soul there is to save the stronger the hook. Especially when fantasy comes to grips with reality. Just my view!

So what do we have in this movie? Well, the above plus the customary convoluted love triangle or quadrangle with everyone endlessly vacillating between love and anger and partners with the usual subplots (usually money) of intrigue to prolong the story for countless hours.

For movies of this ilk my technique for saving time for more useful pursuits is to fast forward for half an hour; watch for five minutes; repeat until the end. Nothing is missed.",1313193600,,1413,4.978813559322034
