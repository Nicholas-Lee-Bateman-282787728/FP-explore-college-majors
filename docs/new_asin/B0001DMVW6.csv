1991942,3,B0001DMVW6,"A great value and easy way to own 100 television programs with over 52 hours of vintage television entertainment. Episodes include:

""Ozzie and Harriet"" (1952-1966) - 6 30 minute episodes

""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"", starring Ozzie, Harriet, David and Ricky Nelson, is television's longest running situation comedy. America watched this active middle-class American family grow up with adventures created, directed and written by Ozzie Nelson. The one mystique on the series was Ozzie's source of income -- he was only seen hanging around the house! Stories revolve primarily around the four Nelsons, with a notable neighbor, Thorny Thornberry, who can be counted on to offer Ozzie ill-timed advice. As the series progressed, and the boys began to date, a succession of friends began to appear. The show that aired on April 10, 1957, featured son Ricky singing ""I'm Walkin'"", the Fats Domino hit. It became a million-selling record and Ricky started a career as a rock'n'roll star.

""Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond"" (1959) - 3 30 minute episodes

Produced at the same time as the more well-known ""Twilight Zone"", this series fed the nation's growing interest in paranormal suspense in a different way. Rather than creating fictional stories with supernatural twists and turns, this program sought out ""real"" stories of the supernatural, including ghosts, disappearances, monsters, etc., and re-creating them for each episode. No solutions to these mysteries were ever found, and viewers could only scratch their heads and wonder, ""What if it's real?""

""Flash Gordon"" (1953-1954) - 3 30 minute episodes

Based on Alex Raymond's legendary sci-fi comic strip hero, these vintage television episodes present the journeys of space hero Flash Gordon (Steve Holland). Along with the lovely Dale Arden (Irene Champlin) and the brilliant Dr. Zharkov (Joe Nash), Flash represents the Galaxy Bureau of Investigation in an ongoing quest to keep the cosmos safe.

""Mr. and Mrs. North"" (1952) - 7 30 minute episodes

Jerry and Pamela North live in Greenwich Village in New York City. Jerry (Richard Denning) is a mystery magazine publisher who thinks he is a good amateur detective. He and his wife (Barbara Britton) investigate various crimes and solve them before the police do.

""Bonanza"" (1959-1972) - 3 1 hour episodes

The Cartwrights' thousand-square-mile Ponderosa Ranch is located near Virginia City, Nevada, site of the Comstock Silver Lode during and after the Civil War. Each of the sons was born to a different wife of Ben's; none of the mothers is still alive. Join Ben (Lorne Greene), Adam (Pernell Roberts), Hoss (Dan Blocker) and Little Joe (Michael Landon) as they rewrite the book on the western genre. These were the days where family values and the fight for justice were backed up by six-guns that always had right on their side.

""The Lone Ranger"" (1949-1956) - 6 30 minute episodes

The lone surviving Texas Ranger (Clayton Moore) who was nursed back to health by the Indian Tonto (Jay Silverheels) rides with him, on Silver and Scout, throughout the West, doing good while living off a silver mine which supplies him with income and bullets. Possibly the most recognizable and beloved of all classic western characters, The Lone Ranger became an icon for the triumph of good over evil for children and adults alike.

""Burns and Allen Show"" (1950-1958) - 6 30 minute episodes

This is the television show that broke all the molds. There was no comedienne at that time (or for that matter, any time) better than Gracie! No one could act that dumb! She was poetry to watch. As George used to say, he stood while Gracie talked! What a pair they were. ""The Burns & Allen Show"" developed a format that gave birth to the television sit-com as we know it today. Witty, ironic, loveable... discover American comedy at its best!

""Life with Elizabeth"" (1952-1955) - 6 30 minute episodes

While still appearing on daily Los Angeles television, Betty White, with two male partners, co-founded Bandy Productions in 1952 to produce her own self-starring situation comedy. A direct out-growth of some of White's daytime sketches, ""Life with Elizabeth"" told the story of married couple Elizabeth and Alvin (played by Del Moore). It was an unusual program in several respects, not the least of which was its twenty-eight-year-old co-creator, producer, and star. Each episode consisted of three vignettes, three different plots. Leisurely paced, Elizabeth's stories had a ring of ""I Love Lucy"" about them. While Elizabeth never launched any outrageous schemes, the comic conflicts often grew out of husband Alvin's disapproval of her logic.

Crime Stories (Various) - 6 30 minute episodes

6 great crime shows filled with intrigue and action:

""Highway Patrol"" Starring: Broderick Crawford. Chief Dan Matthews brings the perps to justice on America's highways.

""Dangerous Assignment"" Starring: Brian Donlevy. Steve Mitchell, undercover agent for the US Government., saves the free world.

""Mr. and Mrs. North"" Starring: Richard Denning, Barbara Britton. New York City mystery story writer and his wife are also amateur detectives.

""Public Defender"" Starring: Reed Hadley. Attorney defends destitute individuals charged with a crime.

""Richard Diamond"" Starring: David Jannsen. Richard Diamond, a suave private eye, brings justice to the big city streets.

""Boston Blackie"" Starring: Kent Taylor. Meet Boston Blackie... enemy of injustice, friend of the underdog.

""Dragnet"" (1951-1959) - 6 30 minute episodes

""The story you are about to see is true."" ""Just the facts, ma'am."" ""We were working the day watch..."" Phrases which became so popular as to inspire much parody set the realistic tone of this early police drama. The show emphasized careful police work and the interweaving of policemen's professional and personal lives. The show featured the inimitable Sergeant Joe Friday (Jack Webb) and his trusty sidekick, Officer Frank Smith (Ben Alexander).

""Dangerous Assignment"" (1949-1953) - 6 30 minute episodes

Film actor Brian Donlevy played Steve Mitchell, an international operative who had two jobs: get in and out of danger. Donlevy had the voice and delivery to make the show sound plausible, even if it was routine Cold War brushfire stuff. Herb Butterfield was the Commissioner, a taskmaster shrouded in secrecy who served up the situations that Mitchell seems never to refuse. The Commissioner's secretary is played by Betty Moran. She actually seems to care about Steve's welfare. The Commissioner is just concerned about the fare.

""Racket Squad"" (1951-1953) - 6 30 minute episodes

One of television's first classic crime shows, ""Racket Squad"" starred Reed Hadley as captain John Braddock, tireless investigator for San Francisco's Racket Squad, who tracked down a wide variety of flimflammers and con artists. Based on actual cases, the show's realistic approach to police work set a new standard for crime dramas. This half-hour show was produced by Hal Roach, Jr. and Carroll Case and was twice nominated for an Emmy award as Best Mystery Series.

""You Bet Your Life"" (1950-1961) - 6 30 minute episodes

""You Bet Your Life"" was derived from Groucho Marx's radio series of the same name. It was inspired after Groucho had done an improvisation scene with Bob Hope on the radio. The idea was to invite people on the show and then ask them a few questionable questions. This always led to improvised and inspired comic interaction with the unsuspecting guests. The subplot, which was almost incidental, was a quiz show with an alleged goal of winning money!! Possibly one of the funniest television shows of all time and a real treat for the uninitiated.

""Red Skelton Show"" (1952-1970) - 6 30 minute episodes

This long-running weekly show spotlighted America's legendary comedian and beloved TV clown, Red Skelton. Each show featured a series of hilarious comedy skits, gags and vignettes starring Skelton and guest performers. An illustrious roster of writers for the show included the inimitable Johnny Carson. The format for the show was a comedy breakthrough that set the groundwork for future shows including ""Laugh-in"" and ""Saturday Night Live"".

""The Andy Griffith Show"" (1960-1968) - 6 30 minute episodes Widower Sheriff Andy (Andy Griffith) and his son Opie (Ron Howard) live with Andy's Aunt Bea in Mayberry, NC. With virtually no crimes to solve, most of Andy's time is spent philosophizing and calming down his cousin Deputy Barney (Don Knotts). Put your feet up and travel back to a time when plain folks were the rule and Aunt Bea's apple pie was always on the table.

""The Beverly Hillbillies"" (1962-1971) - 6 30 minute episodes

Meet the Clampett clan: There's Jed (Buddy Ebsen), a kind and sensible man turned millionaire; Granny (Irene Ryan) - old and senile, paranoid, and always certain she knows how to deal with a situation; Elly May (Donna Douglas) - Incredibly beautiful but awful naive! And Jethro Bodine (Max Baer Jr.) - the strong but dull-witted nephew of Jed; and Mr. Drysdale (Raymond Bailey), a greedy banker who will do anything to keep the Clampett money in his bank, even if he has to hurt other people. Striking oil and becoming millionaires hasn't stopped this clan from living like hillbillies.

""Trouble With Father"" (1950-1952)- 6 30 minute episodes

Originally called ""Life With the Erwins"", this show first aired October 21, 1950, but, once syndicated, it became ""Trouble With Father"". Stu Erwin played himself, the folksy good natured bumbling principal of Hamilton High School. Most of the story revolves around the Erwin household, in which June Collyer is his wife June, and Sheila James (who nine years later was Zelda Conroy, the girl in love with Dobie Gillis) is their young daughter Jackie.",1151539200,124,9767,5.173223350253807
1991943,2,B0001DMVW6,i own most of these megapacks collections and like them but this set just didn't grab me the way some did.some of the shows were good but most were in poor shape picture wise and some of the shows were not very good quality(meaning writing and acting). some may like it but this collection just left me cold.,1145491200,26,308,4.327586206896552

1991945,4,B0001DMVW6,"This 100-episode set from Treeline Films is the quickest way to acquire a fairly diverse library of classic television programming, mostly from the 1950s, at an affordable price.  All of the episodes included in this collection have fallen into the public domain and, as such, most of the programs have been sourced from syndication prints (or from video masters thereof) rather than from the original film elements.  That means that audio/visual quality of the episodes varies dramatically.  I've found better looking releases of some of the more commonly found shows like Bonanza, Dragnet and The Andy Griffith Show on other DVD collections but, for the most part, the prints used for this release are watchable.  Buy this set, instead, for some of the harder-to-find shows (on DVD) like Four Star Playhouse, Life With Elizabeth (starring a young Betty White), and Trouble With Father.  Among the episodes included on the ""Crime Stories"" disc are Highway Patrol (a personal favorite) and Public Defender, starring Reed Hadley, who also stars in Racket Squad.  In many ways, television programming during the 1950s was experimental, with the networks (and syndicators) looking for the ""right formula"" . . . you'll get some sense of that with this collection.
Recommended as a great ""starter set"" for those interested in television's early years.",1086307200,128,1346,5.2372093023255815

You've got ""The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show"", ""The Adeventures of Ozzie and Harriet"", ""The Andy Griffith Show"", ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and many more.  The quality is what you'd expect from public domain episodes.  Lines in the film, occasional splices, hissing and popping.  As usual, ""The Andy Griffith Show"" doesn't have the original theme song, except for the first one.  The rest have no music at all.  Just complete, utter silence.  Very strange.  ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" has the same generic banjo music that most other companies have.  The name of the song is titled ""Banjo Signal.""  As for the other shows, they contain the original music.  Overall, a good collection of some classic TV shows.  I'd recommend it.",1390089600,,797,4.954545454545454

8010729,1,B0001DMVW6,"This set seems like a good buy. After all, that's why I bought it! 100 episodes of some great shows, at that price? Unbelievable! I had several problems.

1. The Andy Griffith episodes don't contain the signature 'Whistling Theme' at the beginning. It just silently shows Andy and Opie walking along the roadside.

2. The Beverly Hillbillies theme has been replaced by some generic crumby banjo playing with no singing. 'Come listen to a story 'bout a man named Jed...

3. Some of the episodes have even had there scene scores replaced. In one scene where Andy Griffith is attending Otis in the jail, the music in the background sounds more suited to a Dracula movie.

4. Some of the episodes have hissing in the Audio tracks. One episode of Dragnet is rendered totally unwatchable as a result.

5. Some of the episodes have very poor video. Almost as if they were downloaded from the internet and burned on to disc. Not professional transfers at all.

I've only watched about half the episodes on this disc and suspect the rest will be just as unwatchable, I'm particularly ticked-off by the music problems. It just doesn't seem right without the correct scores and themes.",1176940800,84,1174,4.758620689655173
