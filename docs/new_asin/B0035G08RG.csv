8388980,5,B0035G08RG,"This is a great product...very detailed, yet easy to follow.  The instructor/producer is definitely a knowledgeable professional yet conveys his knowledge to the viewer so that its like learning from a person you've known for years.  I've learned more in this instructional DVD within the first hour than at a weekend seminar at a local music school.  I've also sampled various other instructional DVDs, but found the instructors couldn't keep my attention that well.  I highly recommend this program if you are looking to learn Reason...it's a steal for the price...no question about it.  I'm definitely looking forward to future releases from him.  The instructor also makes himself available for contact with any questions you may have, which is nice to know...
