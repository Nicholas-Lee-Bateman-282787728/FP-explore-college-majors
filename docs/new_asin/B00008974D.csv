Saga did not dissapoint it's very good saga and WOW Krillin's girlfriend is a HOTTIE and don't think master Roshi didn't notice which makes for a bunch of laughs Five stars all around, plenty of action and a good story so at this price it's a must buy.

1831595,3,B00008974D,"I think this ""saga"" would not be consitered 1 really because it is only about 9 episodes long and not exackly the best",1118966400,,118,4.173913043478261
1831596,5,B00008974D,"What are we to do when goku isn't around. Garlic Jr has invaded kamis look out once again, but this time has won. He's taken the black water mist and spread it through the earth. Whats even worse is that goku isn't around and piccolo has been controlled as well. Gohan, and Krillin must stop him before all of the world is taken over by it. The box set is my favorite because gohan is the one that gets to save the day this time. A must have for all gohan fans.",1084665600,7,461,4.021739130434782
1831597,5,B00008974D,"If you are a BIG dbz fan you need to see this saga!!!! It is a really short saga, but it has a lot of action! I don't own this saga, but I am saving up for it with my allowance. There's nothing negative to say about this saga. Don't spend your money on anything else! Get this saga first!!!!!!!!!",1075852800,3,296,3.95
1831598,3,B00008974D,"Firstly, do not confuse this item with the first Dragon Ball Z movie. The Garlic Jr. saga was a filler series released on the TV airwaves in Japan, after the Frieza saga and before the Trunks/Android sagas.
On to the product:
The box itself is pretty nice, as the pictures are glossy and nice to look at. The structure is small enough to fit exactly three DVDs in, yet without them it would easily be bent due to its flimsiness.
Each of the three DVDs have a total of three episodes on one disc, save the last (Garlic Jr - Vanquished) which contains four. Cover art for the DVDs are simple screenshots of various episodes within the saga (not always accurate to the episodes which they contain), not eye candy by any means. Back of the case summarizes each of the episodes briefly and contains the ratings and various other info.
When you place your disc (which is decorated with the same screenshot as the cover art for the DVD) you'll be greeted with a tinny, hissy backround tune, and the menu has the same image as your box cover. Your options are ""Play All [episodes]"", ""Episodes"", ""Languages"", and ""Extras"" (the menus in these options have much better backround tunes).
The extras are no biggie: action figure commercials, next episode eyecatch, and various other previews. You also have the option to play the episodes in Japanese (subtitles or no). Though, be warned, when played in Japanese the audio is not stereo, but mono, unlike the English version.
The episodes themselves are fun. Much of the North American audience tend to avoid this saga due to the fact that it is a filler, plus the mediocre dub work, and edits; but this disk reveals the Garlic series as it was meant to be seen-uncut, in all of its non-Goku glory. For a filler, it's a fine job, and I would recommend it only to those who would go out of the way to find the DVDs complete with Japanese dialogue.
I am rating this 3 stars, not because of the episodes, but because of the rather sloppy menus and lack of extras and effort put in to the DVDs.",1071273600,5,2027,4.510869565217392

mastermind from enslaving humanity? or will it be the end for our heroes? Find out TODAY on DRAGON BALL ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!!!!! (*guitar solo)

Pros:

Though not ""remastered"", these episodes are in their original UNCROPPED 4:3 aspect ratio.

Has MOST of the original recaps and next episode previews

Is the original dub as seen as Cartoon Network's ""Toonami"" programming block

The Bruce Faulconer soundtrack is excellent and fits the show well

The Japanese version with optional English subtitles is present as well

Awesome menu music

Cons:

The saga is entirely filler, so if you didn't like Dead Zone or just want to see Goku get back to earth and continue on with
the main story, then the Garlic Jr. Saga will seem like an unnecessary roadblock for you, in which case I wouldn't reccomend it.

Missing some of the original recaps and next episode previews.

Is a somewhat short saga.

The video is heavilly interlaced and there's a fair amount of picture noise.",1390348800,2,1104,4.908108108108108

Any after that are too exagerated. I liked how The Spice Mob quickly tookover Kame's lookout. As the leader Garlic Jr. is the shortest like Napoleon Buonapart. The one loosend against his plan was that Namekians are not affected by the Black Water Mist. A good bluff that Piccolo pulled off.  I appreciate it was recorded with the original soundtrack. I don't have the advertised box-set, but Three separate individuals. Oh Well.  I have 2 copies of Sacred Water.",1250553600,,718,6.242424242424242
7980675,4,B00008974D,"The battle between Goku and Frieza in planet Namek has finished. Garlic Jr. has arrived the Earth to be the new guy in charge of it, replacing Kami on this function. Of course that Garlic does not mean to do any good. In the begining Garlic spreads a terrible mist all around the world that make earthlings bad people and so, all in the World becomes a mess.

But there is yet hope for the whole mankind. Fortunately Gohan, Krillin and Piccolo have dodged the evil mist and are ready to fight for the freedom of the Earth inhabitants.

It is a good story and Dragon Ball fans are going to enjoy it a lot. Those who like to see Goku and Vegeta in action might be disapointed because they almost don't appear in this chapters.

If you can, you should see firstly the movie ""The Dead Zone"" so that you will have a complete understanding of the situation.",1155945600,2,851,4.339622641509434
7980676,5,B00008974D,Garlic Jr. is back on Earth and using the black water mist to turn all human's into zombies. Krillian and Gohan didn't get effect cause Gohan was too high up in the air and Krillin and his girlfriend was underwater. Picclo also didn't get effect I guest it doesn't work on Namek's in order to turn people back to normal before sunset is by freeing the gaurdian of earth and let him get the sacrite water and pour it all over earth.,1132358400,,431,4.2682926829268295
