8062676,5,B0009JVRRM,"A delightful animated work that shows: (1)  The Russian version of Doctor Doolittle.  Really.  Kornei Chukovsky based his stories on those of Hugh Lofting, who was also the inspiration for Doctor Doolittle.  (2) Two styles of animation, and I believe that each style says something about the country where it originated.",1404864000,,320,5.215686274509804
8062677,2,B0009JVRRM,"As a fan of Cornelius Chukovksy and Russian animation, I expected more from this DVD.  The clunky, psychedelic, Monty Pythonesque animation is very disconcerting and detracts from the story.  The voices are also grating.  You're better off with a well-performed audio rendition of Doctor Aibolit than with this.  For those who don't know, Dr. Aibolit (Dr. Owithurtz) is C. Chukovsky's verse translation/adaptation of Hugh Lofting's Dr. Dolittle.  Personally, I prefer Chukovksy's rendition to the original.  This is not the way to experience it though.

8062678,5,B0009JVRRM,"Dr. Aibolit is probably the best cartoon I have ever seen. It is full of goofy animation, unique and hilarious characters, and even catchy tunes. If you need to excuse the purchase with intent to give it to a child, by all means, go for it. I would think, however, that you will form an addiction just as quickly as the child will (or would). This is a wildly famous cartoon in Russia, and should be a staple for cartoon collections worldwide.",1237334400,,443,4.414634146341464
