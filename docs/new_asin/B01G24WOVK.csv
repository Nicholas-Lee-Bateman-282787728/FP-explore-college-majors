7753470,4,B01G24WOVK,"A Horror Thriller for our times that begins overseas as a terrifying demon pursues its intended victims across oceans to Chicago's Southwest Side. Director Ricardo Islas takes you inside a blue family secret and translates it into shouts of horror.

The cast is outstanding (Franco Steeves and Rebecca Abraham) and the kids add a great deal to the suspense as one expectation after another is overturned as a new horror monster reaches our shores.

You often don't know who to trust as this thriller unfolds and you scream at characters not to do what they are bound to do. But are you right?

Or does that museum security guard (Keith Kelly) have a hidden motivation for what he says?",1469836800,4,685,4.739495798319328
