2755383,4,B000N3T3Z2,I really enjoyed this DVD even though I do not recommend it for beginners (some postures are quite challenging!). It is a great DVD if you are used going to yoga studio and want to practice at home.,1220832000,,198,4.2368421052631575
2755384,4,B000N3T3Z2,"This is a wonderful DVD. Great intro into the full primary series. If what you're looking for is STRAIGHT ashtanga with no mondifications or variations go with this...&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TAMARA-S-YOGA-FUSION/dp/B001DDY6RG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TAMARA'S YOGA FUSION</a>",1220659200,2,329,9.0
2755385,5,B000N3T3Z2,"This ashtanga DVD is phenomenal!  It's extremely user-friendly.  You can easily choose to do the full sequence, or a shortened version if you have less time or are a beginner.  The background is peaceful, soothing & inviting.  You can choose from multiple voice-overs to suit you.  And, there is extra instruction should you need it.  My husband & I both use this DVD on a regular basis and couldn't be happier with it.  A must-have if you do not have time to make it to a live class.",1201305600,31,484,4.431818181818182
2755386,5,B000N3T3Z2,I usually laugh at my wifes ongoing fitness DVD collection but this disc was so down to earth and engaging I nabbed it for myself. The interactive nature of the DVD shines. It meets me where my body is physically.  After a solid mountain biking session when I think I don't have the energy for a full yoga class I throw on one of the shortened sequences in this DVD and reboot for the next activity. As a guy who was shying away from namby pamby yoga classes this DVD is beginning to change my views on yoga. This style of yoga is affecting parts of my body previously off limits. I was fighting chronic hamstring tightness and various nagging injuries. Since starting with this disc my injuries have been kept at bay.,1186963200,25,718,4.398496240601504
2755387,5,B000N3T3Z2,"I adore this DVD. The instruction is graceful and helpful - with the capability of breaking down specific asanas from the flow sequence into specialized ""lessons"" that offer modified poses! The music is delicious and the choice of instructional voice-overs keeps it fresh. It's smart, aesthetically gorgeous and immensely helpful.
Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!",1184284800,37,363,5.618181818181818
2755388,5,B000N3T3Z2,I've bought a lot of yoga DVD's and this one is excellent.  The instructor breaks down the moves thoroughly.  The speakers are not annoying and the background is wonderful.  Great DVD!,1179273600,12,184,4.870967741935484
2755389,5,B000N3T3Z2,"I agree with all of the 5-star reviews.  This is a complete package for Ashtanga yoga, the primary series.  I have been doing the primary series for a number of years and am, by no means, an advanced practictioner.  While I can do the primary series on my own, I love having the company of fellow yogis/yoginis (even if only on a DVD) with whom to practice.  The instruction portion of the DVD is very clearly demonstrated.  The practice is nicely paced.  The background scenery on both is absolutely beautiful.  Very well done!!!!!  I highly recommend it.",1326240000,2,556,4.65979381443299
2755390,5,B000N3T3Z2,"i love this video. it has to be one of the BEST ashtanga videos, next to david swenson -- this video is easy to follow and the voice is so soothing and relaxing. i totally highly recommend this to anyone looking for something different.",1323302400,2,236,4.386363636363637
2755391,5,B000N3T3Z2,"I have to admit I was a little reluctant to pay $29.98 for a Yoga DVD since I have never paid more than $19.95 before.  I was also more than a little suspicious of all the outstanding reviews for this product - even Shiva Rea gets a few critical reviews (too fast, too hard, too dance-y).  So, I'm thinking maybe they got 24 of their closest friends to write all these stellar reviews. But, I took a chance and ordered it anyway, and, WOW, am I glad I did.

Now that I have actually used this amazing DVD, I have to say that the $29.98 price tag seems like a real bargin. The inclusion of 4 abbreviated flows (30 minute, 40 minute, 50 minute or 60 minute) in addition to the standard 75 minute primary series flow alone makes this DVD well worth the price.  But not only do you get a variety of flows, you also get classes with detailed instructions (including modifications) for each poise in the ashtanga primary series.

Adding even more value and usability to this DVD is the feature that allows you to move from flow to instruction and back.  For example if you are in the middle of the flow and can't remember the modification, or need more guidance on a particular asana, just press the ""select"" button on your DVD remote and you will be take directly to the section of the class with the lesson for that poise.  When you get what you need from the class segment push ""select"" again and you will be taken back to the flow right where you left.  Great feature!

I also like the feature that allows you to choose from 3 different instructor voice overs.

All Ashtanga Yoga DVDs and books have the disclaimer that before using their DVD, you must get in-person instruction from a qualified teacher.  I don't have that option. That's why I'm grateful for this DVD which provides detailed information and comprehensive instruction.  I'm certain that this is the next best thing to in-person, one-on-one instruction.",1313020800,8,1917,4.524637681159421
2755392,5,B000N3T3Z2,I'm a complete newbie to yoga but no stranger to fitness & I love this DVD. My wife and I have been doing the 30 minute workout several times per week and have thoroughly enjoyed it. We have a lot of learning to do and look forward to it! The way the poses are shown in the tutorial section is very helpful. I would highly recommend this DVD to a beginner and imagine it would work well for someone with some yoga experience as well.,1311724800,4,433,4.105882352941176
2755393,5,B000N3T3Z2,"I am living in a small city with no more than 1.5 million people. All the classes in a Studio are closed after 05pm(Time I leave my work).
I practiced Ashtanga Yoga for 1 year but I consider myself still someone between the basic and intermediate.
This DVD came just right and it is really GOOD. Now I can enjoy my practice the time I want and even practice some Yoga during the weekend...time that would be impossible some time ago.
I took a look on all the other DVDs and they seemed bored and too advance. Buy this one and you will not be disappointed.

Cheers, Marc",1310774400,4,569,4.268518518518518
2755394,5,B000N3T3Z2,"A must have for the at-home ashtanga practice. I've had this video for years, and keep returning to it when my home practice needs a bit of a tune-up. I have to admit that I've never switched the teacher's voice, nor used the tutorials, but I think the video itself is well worth the money. I like the option to have a shorter practice, too. It's the DVD I give to friends thinking about getting into the practice.",1310342400,2,414,4.32051282051282
2755395,5,B000N3T3Z2,"I like how this DVD is made for several different practice times. I used to take Ashtanga Yoga lesson at least three times a week. As my work schedule got me busy and I started taking classes at school, I had not time to go to Yoga pracice. Frustrated it was, I found this DVD. Now, I practice Ashtanga through this DVD at home. When I am busy, I chose 40 minutes program. When I have more time, I do 90 minutes practice. It works great for my schedule. Plus, I like the Hawaiian atmosphere of the DVD.",1302048000,3,502,4.13265306122449
2755396,5,B000N3T3Z2,"I started a yoga practice just over a month ago and this was the first DVD I got.  I'm an older guy who's run, raced bicycles, and generally worked out for many years and the injuries started piling up over the last 18 months.  The most recent is a torn calf muscle while doing a 3.5 mile trail run.  Swimming is not an option right now so I was stuck with none of my usual fitness alternatives and that led me to try ashtanga.  I am so glad I did.  It has been a startling revelation how greatly my flexibility differs from my right and left sides.  Having now seen how dramatic this imbalance is, I am not at all surprised I've had these recent injuries and I am convinced that restoring right-side/left-side balance in flexibility will enable me to resume my other activities.

Ease Into Ashtanga is a superb production with excellent instruction sessions showing both advanced and beginner alternatives.  The main focus of Ashtanga is the ""flow"", of course, and this DVD makes the flow very accessible by editing down the full flow to 30, 40, 50, and 60 minute easily selectable subsets.  The scenery, audio quality, and apparent knowledge of the teachers is also excellent.  These are people who know what they're doing and how to teach it to others.  There are several audio track options with your choice of three teachers and with or without a very suitable background music track.

In short, none of the other yoga DVDs I've gotten since compares with Ease Into Ashtanga for usability, efficacy, and value.  I've also looked into other online options such as podcasts, free downloads, etc, and none are anywhere near as suitable for an older guy working hard to maintain fitness and prevent future injuries.  My only concern with yoga in general is that it doesn't keep my heart rate high enough long enough to qualify as an aerobic workout.  There were some solid spikes above 70% of my max heart rate when I measured it yesterday during the 50 minute session, but not enough to constitute a fully effective aerobic workout.  That aside, though, Ease Into Ashtanga the DVD, and ashtanga itself, have exceeded my expectations and I highly recommend both.",1294531200,11,2163,4.712765957446808
2755397,5,B000N3T3Z2,"Excellent yoga DVD - it the most prized of my collection.  I highly recommend it for anyone who has already been practicing yoga for a while and is looking for something more advanced. One of my favorite features of this DVD is its ability to quickly switch between the actual flow and the lesson portion. Can't quite recall how to execute a pose? With a click of the remote you can quickly review it with an instructor and then return to the flow. The lesson chapters are also excellent workouts on their own.  There are  several options for flow length so that you can progress at your own pace, ability or mood. You can select to listen to 3 different instructors during the flow, and even opt out of the provided music if you'd rather listen to your own.",1293926400,6,758,4.438848920863309
2755398,5,B000N3T3Z2,"As the title says this is a excellent DVD for someone who truly wants to ease into the primary series of Ashtanga yoga. The tutorials are extremely helpful for a beginner as well as someone like myself who has several DVD's of the primary series and has been practicing for some time. I recommend this DVD because you can pick the length of your practice so if you don't have the full 70 minutes to devote to your pracitice you can shorten it up a bit and still practice the primary series. Other DVD's on the market require at least 75 minutes or more which is not always available on a particular day. My heartfelt thanks to all those who put this superb effort together.
Namaste.",1286236800,4,682,4.420634920634921
2755399,5,B000N3T3Z2,"This DVD was recommended to me by a friend who is an avid yogi, ashtanga in particular.  I am not the typical yogi, and had my doubts, but this DVD makes learning a new yoga style easy, and exciting.  I am still in the process, but I can see improvement and can't wait to take a live class.  The lessons are very well done, and modified postures are perfect.  Truly the best at home yoga I have seen, and for such a challenging practice.",1285459200,4,437,4.166666666666667
2755400,4,B000N3T3Z2,"I purchased this DVD & Doug Swensens Ashtanga yoga short forms together & I think Doug Swenson's is MUCH better.  I was generally pleased with the format, however the way they crop for the shorter sessions is a little 'jumpy' at points.  I also thought she does not thoroughly explain poses or breathing as well as Doug Swenson.  I have been casually practicing ashtanga for 3 years or so, so I am familiar with the routines, & this stays true to the ashtanga routine.  Overall, I'm glad I have the DVD for variety, but it is not my favorite.",1262995200,5,542,4.444444444444445
2755401,5,B000N3T3Z2,"After considering several dvd's online I selected this one for 3 reasons: 1) it offered variations in length for days i'm short on time or just feel like going easy, 2) it is based on a traditional ashtanga practice with instructional sessions for each component, and 3) it offers a choice of instructor voice tracks, with or without music!.

Now that I've received it, I am so pleased with it!  The instructors are very down to earth and have put a lot of thought into the filming of the instructional tracks, showing angles that are very helpful in demonstrating proper technique and variations, without the gratuitous chest shots so many instruction videos seem to include.  The ease of use is amazing as well, with immediate on screen icons during the practice sessions that allow you to jump to the correlating detailed instruction or switch audio tracks midstream.

I have been practicing yoga for about 7 years with local pracitioners or in studio classes a couple of days a week, but I've wanted to find a home video providing an intermediate level practice I can do more regularly.  One of my resolutions for 2010 is to set up a yoga/meditation room in my home and begin a daily practice... or at least every other day ;) to supplement my studio instruction, which I anticipate will reduce risk for injury and allow me to grow my practice further.  This dvd is just what I was looking for and I highly recommend for either a beginner or intermediate student.",1262390400,4,1467,4.7109375
2755402,4,B000N3T3Z2,"I've only used lessons up to and including Lesson 6 (Sun Salute A) on this DVD, but I really like it and am very glad I purchased it. I took some Ashtanga yoga classes years ago and wanted to try it again at home using a DVD.

I checked out various DVD previews on YouTube and was put off by the extreme flexibility of some teachers. They didn't seem to offer 'alternative' positions or options for people like me who are inflexible and haven't been practising yoga for years and years.

In this DVD, the teacher (Tania) talks through the techniques of each movement while two models demonstrate positions for beginners and more flexible/advanced students. As she says, ""Use the variation that works for your body.""

The voices used on some other DVDs also seem to drone and irritate, rather than relax and inform. Tania's voice in this DVD is calm, clear and non-judgemental. She delivers the right balance of explaining good technique for each series, without getting overly bogged down in detail.

I haven't touched on the other parts of the DVD which are pitched at longer term yoga practitioners, but if you've tried a few Ashtanga yoga classes and want a refresher (or you're wanting to try a new type of yoga), I'd recommend it.",1257552000,8,1235,4.67741935483871
2755403,5,B000N3T3Z2,I was a little skeptical at first given the price.  When I got this dvd home boy is it the real thing.  I have taken yoga for just under a year and needed to find something that would give me an intense home practice. Now with the economy the way it is this is the only yoga practice I can afford at the moment.  And let me tell you! It is fantastic! I can burn well over 300 calories with this tape in less than 40 minutes. I love it and have noticed an improvement in my practice.  I actually learned more with this tape than I did in class.  Amazing.  I love the instructors as well.  Great dvd will not go wrong. If you are a beginner and have had some yoga classes but want to try it at home on your on GET THIS DVD TODAY! you will not waste your money!,1237852800,16,758,3.883116883116883
2755404,5,B000N3T3Z2,"Being a tantric practitioner I'm always looking for workouts that support my total wellbeing, so the location has to be right, the music has to be spot on, and the teacher must be sympathetic and genuine. Ease Into Ashtanga has  all of these qualities. It is rich in information to help you understand exactly what you're doing and why. The practice is broken down into doable sections and the scenery is sublime. I always have an enjoyable experience practising from this DVD and feel relaxed, rejuvenated and sexy at the end of it! A must-buy.",1237075200,7,545,4.7368421052631575
2755405,5,B000N3T3Z2,"This DVD is a great workout for all yoga abilities.  I especially like how you can select the length of the workout from 30 min to over an hour, depending on how much time you have.  It is very easy to fit into a busy schedule!",1234742400,7,227,3.9130434782608696
2755406,4,B000N3T3Z2,"I take a regular Ashtanga class with an excellent teacher, so I am familiar with the routine and the poses.  For someone like me, it is a decent substitute for going to class.  However, it could not replace  working with a good teacher who can spot mistakes and correct alignment.  The energy of the other students is a part of the experience too.  If you are new to Ashtanga, this will introduce you to the practice - but it cannot replace being in a good class with a good teacher.  You should definitely take a class somewhere before trying it on your own.

This video does provide several interesting features, such as introductions to the poses and various shorter versions of the routine.  The Hawaiian coastal background is attractive, and the videography is fine - but the video does not deliver on all it promises.  There was no way to change the speaker or the background music, for one thing.  Also, the shorter versions of the routine are just edited versions of the same routine, i.e., the longer video with chunks cut out of it.  And most importantly, the teacher's verbal cues, while not bad, are only average.  In my opinion, my teacher (Stephanye Dussud) could have done a better job.

Despite these flaws, this is still a worthwhile purchase that I use regularly.  There is a lack of good Ashtanga videos, and I thank Yoga Hawaii and the video company for making this.  Hopefully they can add some improvements to later editions.  If they were to release versions of the Series 2 or the Moon Series, I would gladly purchase them and use them also.",1232496000,8,1565,4.615942028985507
2755407,5,B000N3T3Z2,"I have been taking Ashtanga classes for a couple of years now. This CD is just like having an instructor in your home. I have been able to advance my practice because of it. Clear instructions. I love the fact you can see many different people practicing, shows you what different body types do. I can't say enough good things about it. If some of the poses are beyond your ability right now you are shown modifications. Ashtanga has changed my body (and my mind) for the better, I have never done such a powerful practice. It is well worth trying. If you keep working at it you will be amazed.",1229040000,12,594,4.36036036036036
2755408,5,B000N3T3Z2,"I have been practicing yoga for almost 2 years now but I am still a beginner. I can't do arm balances or head stands but I can do most of the basic poses. I found Ease Into Ashtanga challenging without being overwhelming. This DVD is the full Ashtanga Primary series. The DVD is broken up into lessons where each pose is explained fully with modifications. Then once you master the poses, you can do one of 4 flows...the full 90 minute flow, a 60 minute, 40 minute and 30 minute flow. You can also pick which instructor's voice you want (out of 3). They even explain proper sitting and breathing. It is a very thorough DVD and one that a beginner can grow into. I think it is challenging enough for intermediate and advanced yoga students as well since they will probably be able to get into the full poses (very challenging!) rather than the modifications. It's a fun DVD and never boring. Minimal chatter which is refreshing. Plus, Ashtanga is a lot of fun and super conditioning!",1223251200,41,982,4.522471910112359
8174610,2,B000N3T3Z2,"I'd write my own detailed review but the one by D. Niedringhausz pretty much says it all: The instructor's voice is unpleasant, and her delivery is like a high school gym teacher. The flow is too fast-paced except perhaps for the speediest ashtangis, and the cuing a bit confusing. And this was an expensive DVD. I'm sending it off to the thrift store to make room on my shelf for better ones.",1462060800,,393,4.472222222222222

8174615,5,B000N3T3Z2,"I recently added ""Ease Into Ashtanga"" to my extensive yoga dvd collection and it's possibly the best instructional Ashtanga dvds on the market. So much so that it almost replaces going to Ashtanga classes as it very clearly explains Ashtanga from A to Z, including the breath and each of the poses. In addition, there is a full Ashtanga class as well as 30, 40, 50 & 60 shorter versions which are great when you pushed for time. I also love the fact that there are various levels amongst the yoga students who perform the class - it may have been helpful to have at least one beginner doing modified versions of the more difficult asanas as I sometimes feel overwhelmed by the students poise, grace & expertise. Nevertheless, this and David Swenson's DVDs are my favourite Ashtanga DVDs. I wish I could download it onto my computer!!! (the format seems a bit tricky). It's money well spent.",1344988800,,890,4.639240506329114
8174616,3,B000N3T3Z2,I like the instruction part of the DVD but the actual lesson moved way too fast for a beginner like myself.  The price is expensive.  If you have experience doing ashtanga then it shouldn't be a problem.  During the lesson they have way too many people taking part in the dvd so it's hard to watch one person to get an idea of what to do next.  I will give it another try after I get more experience doing yoga in general.,1334448000,,422,4.109756097560975
8174617,2,B000N3T3Z2,"OK, what am I missing?

I read all the glowing reviews and, despite the high price for a single DVD, I thought I would try this out.  There are a lot of things that I personally find annoying.  The first might be the main instructor's voice during the 'lesson' part of the video...sounds at times like a duck quacking...not particularly soothing.  I cannot find fault with the instruction itself, but her high school gym teacher delivery is less than inspiring.

Of course, one can change the voice over for the flow sessions, but I find there are a lot of 'gaps' with the alternate instructors.  This becomes a problem when the pace picks up and I have to keep turning my head to the screen to figure out what the next pose is....I'm in a forward lunge while the other practitioners are in a downward facing dog.  To me, ""Drop your shoulder blades"" does not mean ""step back into downward facing dog.""

Other reviewers have mentioned the beautiful Hawaiian scenery or the trim and toned bodies of the other yogis on the beach.  Although these might be pleasant distractions, they are distractions nonetheless.  Why didn't they choose two or three different people for each of the 30, 40, 50 and 60 minute sessions?

Given the price and the length of this DVD, I would also have liked to see a few balance poses or inversions but I suppose they would have interrupted the ashtanga flow.",1332633600,6,1385,4.612244897959184
8174618,4,B000N3T3Z2,"UPDATE: I've been practicing Ashtanga on my own for one year now and I recently picked up this video and listened to the instructions again. They made a lot more sense to me after I had memorized the first 50-60 minutes of primary series for myself. I recommend, if you are going to teach yourself using a book at first. Second get very snap at sun salutes. Back when I was groaning my way through, working up tremendous sweat in the first 10 minutes of primary series I had no strength left to pay attention to the dristi, or bandha. Get strong first. Then go back for the deep instruction. You probably don't need a book or a video to work yourself up to the requisite 10 sun salutes. Then buy this video or any of the other filmed Ashtanga primary series. (As I said in my initial review, ""Ashtanga is Ashtanga"" the primary series is the same - so buy the video with the instructor whose voice you like, lol.

PS Some of the short forms seem harder than just doing the first 40 minutes of primary series. Just watched the 30 minute short form and it includes a full backbend (repeated), lotus pose, lotus in a shoulder stand, and being able to arm balance. Don't be daunted. Just do what you can and not more than you can

**********************
Original Review starts here:

I keep trying to like Ashtanga. It is a very popular style of yoga.  It will build muscle strength.  It is beautiful to watch people do.  This video is filmed in beautiful Hawai'i with lots of strong good looking people.  The instructive portion of the tape was very instructive. A friendly looking woman with two models shows how the same pose may look different on two different people.  She is very reassuring.

But here's the thing, Ashtanga is Ashtanga, is Ashtanga - there's no way to make it easier, easy or to ease into it.  The poses change too rapidly for me! I can barely keep up with these guys and I have no time to check my alignment!  If you are already steady in your Ashtanga practice, none of this is going to bother you.  You will enjoy the music, the filming and the instructive features.

If like me, you already purchased the David Svenson video and hoped this video would be easier, based on the name ""Ease into Ashtanga"" you may be disappointed to discover - it's exactly the same sequence.  Well, of course it is.  They can't really do anything else and still call it Ashtanga.  Ultimately I think the only way to ""ease"" into Ashtanga, is to find an Ashtanga instructor.  In a studio, the instructor won't teach you the next part of the sequence until you are proficient with the beginning moves.",1329004800,13,2600,4.47457627118644
