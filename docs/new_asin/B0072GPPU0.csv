there is any possibility that you would enjoy it",1393804800,,128,3.9615384615384617
8508860,3,B0072GPPU0,"This movie was actually much better than I had anticipated, of course going in with no expectations (actually thinking this was about Grizzly bears).  It is low budget, of course, but the acting was actually pretty good (Except for Posey and Pastor Ron - I was wishing Pastor Ron would get shot to shut up all the monkey noises!). All in all, a pretty interesting movie.",1383350400,,370,4.606060606060606
8508861,1,B0072GPPU0,"Zero is not even enough for this mess.  There are no bears, but there is a guy trying to build a perpetual motion machine, some stereotypical hillbillies who are mostly unintelligible, a woman who thinks an oddly shaped gourd from her garden is lifelike, a weird preacher, and a story that has no center, no focus, and no point.  There is nothing even remotely entertaining here.",1341273600,2,379,4.7272727272727275
