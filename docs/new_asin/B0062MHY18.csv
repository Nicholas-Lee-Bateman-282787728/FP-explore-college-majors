4932806,4,B0062MHY18,"These types of movies exist to please fans of cars and car racing. Many...most don't try to invent a new plot line. They just want to get enough going to keep the viewer involved between races. This is no different. The plot is cookie cutter but you like the characters and the twists are such that it makes for very enjoyable viewing.

Here's the scoop. Danny Krueger lives with mom and step dad. He knows how to handle high performance cars and he knows his way around under the hood. But he keeps getting into trouble. Not because he's a bad guy. It's because he overreacts when people egg him on. He's in trouble one too many times and mom sends him packing to live with his real father where he finds himself embroiled in yet another street racing culture where his buttons might get pushed and push him back in the dog house.

This is a fun movie. Danny's problems are set up early on. Then he has to make peace with his ""on the wagon"" dad who used to be a racing big shot. He also needs to show the local street racing hot shot (who's also a big wiener) who the better racer is, and get the girl to boot. All the elements come together in true Hollywood fashion.

Other than Sherry Stringfield and Matt McCoy, I didn't recognize any of the other actors. They all did a decent enough job. It's directed well enough with good attention paid to the race scenes. The editing and sound editing were very good. And it seems they brought in some real-life drivers to add a sense of legitimacy to the proceedings.

It is what it is. If you like this sort of thing this should do you up real good.",1336953600,6,1595,4.289036544850498
4932807,5,B0062MHY18,"Born 2 Race is not one of the best films,The acting is bad but the plot is good. The Ricers burning away at the start of the movie-there was a Monte Carlo SS(but the Custom hood was ugly)and some other cool Domestics,The Kid drives a Subaru STI(not a favorite of mine but I like em in black or blue or in rallying better than a Honda.)The kids are typical all talking like they are from ""the hood"" and being cool and whatnot,I hateMustangs(I despise Fords-Im Corvette and Camaro/Firebird and GM muscle guy). So I had to wait a while before I got to see that Beautiful red Buick and the really nice Chevy 55' which are the best cars in the movie,sadly one Corvette(in the shop 80's,84-90 body,could not make out the wheels to specify which exact year); there was a Chevelle,Nova and finally through all the melodrama and afternoon special acting the Drag Racing and (SPOILER)The Jock as usual in the Mustang(Art Imitating life?)Annoying so it was awesome seeing the car destroyed since Frankly as mentioned Can't stand those cars as much as I can't stand Ricers,Not a bad movie lots of sponsors but Worth watching considering I saw it on netflix.",1336003200,,1145,4.645320197044335

4932809,4,B0062MHY18,"I honestly came into watching this expecting crappy acting, a F&F-type clone, and some crappy rice rockets. It turns out that it seems the crew did their homework. The acting was a fair bit heavy-handed at parts, and a bit cliche, with nothing really original (although there are a few quality lines, to be sure), it actually comes away as a decent movie. The themes, again, are nothing new- boy screws up, has to live with outcast/former drunk dad, they find common ground and reconcile... but the way it takes a theme (street/drag racing) that has been mercilessly abused (F&F movies ruined street racing's rep, which is duly awful [as any illegal sport should be, of course], and made all tuners look like idiot-criminals instead of car enthusiasts), and actually injects (har har) some life into it, with the street racing son actually going legit at the end, with an NHRA scholarship. Some VERY obvious marketing in this, but it doesn't take much away from what turned out to be a pretty good movie.
Certainly worth a rent, and I'll be keeping this in the collection. I liked it so much, I even wrote this review! :) Check it out! Mark W.",1335139200,3,1143,4.663366336633663

4932839,3,B0062MHY18,"As a long time performance Subaru enthusiast, I enjoyed the entertainment this movie provided.  I will share the DVD with my car club friends. The acting was average to good.  There's plenty of American V8 action along with the flat-four and inline-6 import cars.  I would've rented this movie but it wasn't available on NetFlix.  It's special if you like Subarus.  :-)",1393113600,,369,4.887096774193548
4932840,2,B0062MHY18,"First have to mention that this is a movie specifically geared towards ricer fan-boys and not very realistic.  I'm a gearhead and pretty much buy or watch any movie that has to do with fast cars.  For the most part, I enjoyed this movie.  The young street racer's estranged father is a well known former NASCAR driver who now owns his own shop.  The local hot shot owns a modified Mustang.  The movie's climax is at the end when the main actor's subaru is pitted against the Mustang for a chance at an NHRA scholarship.  Spoiler alert:  Based on the end result, somehow the Dad is converted from a lifetime of American muscle cars to the dark side.  FYI, if you want a glimpse of what really goes down in real street racing, watch Street Outlaws on Discovery channel.  There you can witness what happens to a 1500 hp Nissan GTR in Season 2, EP 1, that gets beat by a vintage Chevy Nova.  Would only recommend this movie if you enjoy fantasy genre.",1391385600,,947,4.390804597701149
4932841,3,B0062MHY18,"Watched this on netflix, and it was actually better than i thought it was going to be.  Some pretty cool cars, decent storyline(albeit a bit predictable), and alright acting.  The one thing that made me laugh out loud was when he said the car was maxed out at an 11.10 1/4 mile time, and then power shifting dropped him into the 9s...really guys? a full second? I know it's a movie but come on.

still worth checking out if you are a car enthusiast.",1390867200,,449,4.321428571428571

4932846,5,B0062MHY18,Let me start by saying this movie is awesome! Just a couple of things though. They did borrow a lot of material from the fast & furious franchise however what sets this movie apart is the authenticity. They got it right when it comes to the look and feel of the cars and racing. Also this is a great cast with some cute kids. This a fun movie that every car enthuisist will enjoy!,1362268800,3,380,4.148648648648648
4932847,3,B0062MHY18,This is an action packed movie whith beautiful cars and lots of racing and violence.  The acting and direction was not as good as it could have been but my husband REALLY enjoyed it.  (My comparison is to Fast 1 - 5 = not as good),1361404800,,230,3.9782608695652173

4932850,4,B0062MHY18,"I was actually very surprised. I have ordered a bunch of ""racing"" movies online before and have received the crappiest of crappy dvds that did not live up to my expectations or quench my thirst for well tuned, street performance vehicles. Shockingly, I ordered this movie w/ the expectation I would just see a few cool cars and surprisingly, this movie was actually a decent movie to watch. I really enjoyed watching it, primarily after I got over the fact that a high school student was driving a pearl white STI that had to cost at least 40K and he ""bought it"" himself...yea right. But anyway, shockingly fun movie to watch. I'd get it.",1339718400,,638,4.605263157894737
