8325358,4,B000LC55QQ,"It speaks to my advancing years that I think the 1970's still too recent an era to be referenced as old-timey. Anyway, CHITCHOR is an old-timey Hindi classic that made a dent in the Indian box office back in 1976. Those who habitually fuss and fidget may not have use for this movie as it moves leisurely and, for the most part, steeps its sensibilities in traditional Indian values. But I think it's a sweet and modest movie that grounds itself in good acting, and in its simple yet expert execution, and in melodious music. I won't say ""Stop me if you've heard this one before"" because, odds are, you'd get ahead of me. And I have to make my carpal tunnel worth it.

But the movie opens with a marriage proposal as the schoolmaster Pitamber Chaudhri (A. K. Hangal) receives a letter from his older daughter, Meera, who dwells in bustling Bombay. She alerts her parents that an important engineer is coming to their humble village of Madhupur to work on a bridge project, and that this engineer, well-off and educated abroad, may qualify as a potential match for her younger sister, Geeta (Zarina Wahab).

Soon, the train creaks in and the prospective suitor disembarks and is welcomed by the schoolmaster, is courted by the Chaudhri fam. As the stranger, Vinod (Amol Palekar), possesses an agreeable disposition and a clever wit, he promptly wins them over, and eventually even the obstinate Geeta. Maybe it's his singing that did it or perhaps his playing the harmonium. Whatever, Vinod is an exceedingly likable dude. Pleasant days go by, and Vinod and Geeta fall in love, and the schoolmaster begins to seek an auspicious date for the wedding.

Arriving at the film's halfway point we await that signature plot twist, there's always one come intermission. This time, the swerve comes in the shape of another letter from Meera, a missive that informs the Chaudhris that the promised engineer is yet underway to Madhupur but should be there shortly. Oh, snap! It's that old Bollywood saw - the mistaken identity! Turns out Vinod is the engineer's subordinate, an assistant come ahead to pave the way. And now here's the mighty engineer disembarking and setting eyes on Geeta and readily consenting to a match. Oh, what happens now?

Okay, one nitpick: It's a hard sell for me that that much time would go by without the family's asking Vinod his name.

CHITCHOR (translation from Hindi: Heart Stealer) runs 98 minutes, a shocker considering most Indian films go so long the viewer could experience a birthday twice. Nowadays, the movie is a sip of nostalgia, a peek into a bygone era of Indian cinema. There are no villains here. The various conflicts arise from misunderstandings and suppositions and being bound by society and tradition. Rejecting the exaggerated pomp inherent in most Bollywood masala films, CHITCHOR delights in its unassuming simplicity. It forges ahead on the strength of competent narration, a capable cast, a string of quiet scenes that reinforced characterization, and songs that would go on to impact future generations. Amol Palekar and Zarina Wahab are great together, and A.K. hangal as the schoolmaster exudes benign authority. But what I took away most is Dina Pathak's performance. She plays the schoolmaster's wife and is most memorable for her abrupt change in conduct towards our guy when she finds out he isn't after all whom her Bombay daughter had mentioned. And about the music - what does it say that whenever talk is bandied about concerning what's best in the repertoire of the blind music composer, Ravindra Jain, not a moment passes that you don't bring up the songs in this movie? For Bollywood buffs, CHITCHOR is the one that introduced K.J. Yesudaas and Hemlata as playback singers.

CHITCHOR inspired one inferior remake in MAIN PREM KI DIWANI HOON (2003) starring Hrithik Roshan, Kareena Kapoor and Abhishek Bachchan and an earlier looser-based remake in PARDES (1997) starring Shahrukh Khan and Mahima Chaudhry. I'm no expert in old-timey Hindi films but CHITCHOR must've been a sort of trailblazer in that the film's resolution relied on Geeta's independent choice. So, you go, girl. Or is that phrase old-timey, too? I am old.",1421798400,,4182,4.933238636363637

8325360,4,B000LC55QQ,"This Indian film is cute because of the simple story and the characters - especially the main young actress. It's also interesting to just watch little things about Indian life. This film isn't flashy, fun, or as skillfully composed as a great Bollywood film would be, but it's still cute.",1415836800,,289,4.8
