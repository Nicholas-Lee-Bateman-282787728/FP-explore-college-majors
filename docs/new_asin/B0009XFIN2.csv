2334441,3,B0009XFIN2,"To some, this is a classic piece of kung fu cinema history.  To me, it could've been with some severe tightening up.  The overall story is very good for this type of flick, as is the majority of the film's execution.  Director Lau Kar Leung (""The 36th Chamber of Shaolin"") delivers one of his more unique and frustrating films.  The martial arts?  Pretty sweet.  Appearances by Lo Lieh, Wilson Tong, and Johnny Wang as bad guys is always an asset too.  What's the problem then?

Gordon Liu stars as the 11th Prince who is hiding out in a brothel as an antique-collector while one of his evil brothers plans his assassination.  In the meantime, Liu is competing for the attention of the girls in the brothel with Ho Ching (Wong Yu), a petty thief.  Liu uses his influence and intelligence to trick Ho Ching out of the things he has stolen but keep him out of trouble at the same time.  Ho Ching wants his money back but Liu is always  one step ahead of him, pretending to not know how to fight yet evading all of Ho's attacks.  Liu eventually blackmails Ho into being his disciple after Ho is poisoned.  Assassins soon find Liu's whereabouts and come after him.

The fights where Gordon Liu pretends not to know how to fight are kinda neat... at first.  Then they just become boring.  The fight where an antique-dealer attempts to assassinate Liu while both are still having a civil conversation was kinda neat... at first.  Did they need another fight that was essentially the same?  These may sound like minor problems in the scheme of things, but they drove me nuts and took away from my overall enjoyment of the film.  These pesky scenes are very well done, with Liu looking fantastic.  Wong Yu's fighting performance is also very good.  However the fights don't really get going until Liu's identity is revealed to his disciple and they start to train, about a half hour from the end.

The version I have is a remastered one from Red Sun.  Though I don't usually advocate buying their bootlegs, sometimes they have stuff that you can't otherwise obtain, and I know of no other remastered copies available in a region-free format.  The picture quality is fantastic with a nice widescreen picture.  In English only with removable English subtitles.  Many fans of fu consider this movie to be a great one, so it is recommended to those who can overlook the flaws I consider fatal.  Maybe I'm wrong.  I once placed Sammo Hung's ""Warriors Two"" in the same category and I now hail it as a masterpiece.

2334442,2,B0009XFIN2,"This movie is a classic old-school kung-fu movie. Gordon Liu always entertains and choreography is top notch for its time. However, the release from Red Sun entertainment is a disappointment. On the DVD cover it states that it is remastered, I highly doubt that. The picture looks grainy and you can see the tracking adjustments on a few scenes that usually happens on VHS tapes. I was hoping that celestial pictures would remaster this picture like other Shaw Bros. films.",1244073600,,473,4.925
2334443,3,B0009XFIN2,"It's actually 3 1/2 stars from me. But I could of done better with another actor at the time instead of Wang Yu. I love Liu Chia- liang's martial arts choreography in this films first and foremost.

A far as this DVD: I bought this DVD at first as a pre order because I had the Ground Zero version which had (before I threw it away) skips and jumps on the DVD and Amazon {on the Pre- Order} comments mentioned that it had 5.1 surround sound and it was widescreen. Very seductive for a kung fu fan like me to give in, but guess what people- It's the same version as Ground Zero's but the difference is that they (Wu Wei) had rescaled their version (Ground Zero's) to 2:60 instead of the original aspect ratio which was 2:35. Hold on there is more: they rescaled it again to 1:85, so, when you are watching the film- the original aspect ratio {of their version- Wu Wei} is covered by a 1:85 strip. It's horrible. At least Ground Zero's version had better resolution and it was the original 2:35 ratio. Hold on their is more: they copied Ground Zero's version from the VHS copy not the DVD as you can clearly see.

Horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!! And I paid $21 for this... Deltamac or IVL is the way to go Kung fu fans. Also, thanks goodness for Quentin Tarantino and Dragon Dynasty..... they are going to put bootleggers like these people out of business.",1174780800,,1344,4.393574297188755
2334444,5,B0009XFIN2,"Dirty Ho is one of the best DVD's in the martial arts category. What can I say about it..if you are into martial arts classics, this DVD is for you. It also stars Gordon Liu and Lau Kar Leung...2 of the best in the business. Get it. You will not regret it.",1173312000,2,256,3.9423076923076925

This is another movie that recieved tons of hype for who knows what reason? I gave it three stars for having a story you can follow. As far as the fight scenes go they are not spectacular. I know its an oldie but still . Go see the magnificant butcher or fearless heyena. bye",1172534400,,424,3.8850574712643677
2334446,4,B0009XFIN2,"I really enjoyed this flick,,truly one of Gordon Liu best performance,,,there is no question,,not only is this guy an amazing kung fu performer, but he can truly act.  This flick is truly a gem,,a ,must have classic.  Old school kung fu very transparent from the start to finish!!  Definatly a must have for the collection,,,,you will not be dissapointed!!",1151712000,5,356,5.0
2334447,2,B0009XFIN2,"This famous Shaw Brothers title is pretty entertaining, but is badly let down by a substandard presentation.  It appears to have been mastered from an old VHS tape, and the picture is full of tape dropout...add to this the audio and digital artifacts and you have a most annoying video experience. The fairly high price adds insult to injury; I've bought DVDs for $5.00 that play far better. I haven't gotten any discs from this particular company before, and I'm not likely to do so again...buy if you must, but be forewarned.",1121731200,3,527,4.728260869565218

2334449,5,B0009XFIN2,Dirty Ho is a very good movie. I love Gordon Liu character and His co-partner character. Lots of comedy fighting skills on the part of Gordon Liu. He is a good actor in all his movies. If you are a fan of Gordon Liu than this movie is a must see.,1425081600,,246,3.843137254901961

2334451,4,B0009XFIN2,"Despite it's name 'Dirty Ho' IS indeed a kung-fu movie. After being discovered by Master Liu, Ho (the dirty thief) asks to be trained to learn the way of the kung-fu fighter. Legendary Shaw Brothers actor Gordon Liu plays the role of the mentor in this kung-fu flick which surprisingly is not chocked full of revenge filled, clich storylines.

For the majority of the movie, the fight scenes are relatively tame, in a cool and creative way. Instead of just having a bunch of all out brawls, Liu's character visit's several 'friends' where they (almost respectfully) battle with tea cups and Chinese hand fans. The choreography in these scenes is fantastic and pretty fun to watch. Not after long, Ho is given a rigorous training regiment in order to prepare for a more intense battle.

In one of the final fight scenes there is almost a Lone Wolf and Cub scenario going on, where Ho is wheeling around Master Liu in a cart as they battle dozens of foes. Finally Ho and Liu stand together, finishing the movie on a tandem fight scene.",1399075200,3,1033,4.639344262295082

2334455,2,B0009XFIN2,"I love old-school kung-fu.

For reference, I would say that my two favorites are: ""Master of the Flying Guillotine,"" and ""5 Elemental Ninja.""

Dirty Ho is AWFUL!  Granted the only reason I bought it was because I delight in seeing people read the title and squirm thinking it must be an ""adult"" title... but it is really bad.

Every character looks exactly the same except for Ho, who is easily distinguished by a small bandage on his head.  Apparently the fact that he has a band-aid on his head makes him ""dirty?""  Shouldn't his name be ""Injured Ho?"" or ""Wounded Ho?""  I dunno.

The fighting is pretty mediocre especially considering you can't tell who is who (except for Ho).  If there is a plot I couldn't figure it out...

Stay away.",1284681600,,738,4.564885496183206

2334457,3,B0009XFIN2,"I heard over and over again about how good Dirty Ho was, how it was a classic, a must see.  Well, I finally saw it and it was terrible.  So why did I give it 3 stars?  The two fight scenes in the middle of the movie, with the wine connoisseur and the antique merchant, was probably the best fight scenes I've ever seen.  Besides that, the movie was horrible.  The plot was stupid.  I still don't understand why they were trying to kill Gordon Liu when there were at least 10 other brothers.  Maybe I missed something.  The fight in the windy tunnel was so bad I skipped ahead to the next scene.
Dirty Ho is worth a watch for the two above mentioned fight scenes, but other than that, avoid at all cost!",1261785600,,702,4.148148148148148
8069560,4,B0009XFIN2,"Dubbed in English.  Fight scenes are really good and well choreographed, and the story is fun, but without much of an ending.  Two people become good friends throughout the movie, one poor and the other is super rich as he is one of 14 princes.  The poor guy steals as a career and fakes himself as wealthy.  The prince on the other hand is super rich, but fakes himself as a commoner.  The two meet one evening at a brothel, and each has his own room.  The young ladies are attracted by the money games each play, and they compete on who can get the most girls into his room.  Soon enough the prince wins, and cops/constables surround the place due to a tip of stolen jewelry.  When they arrive in search of stolen goods, without letting anyone know, the prince secretly shows off his Badge/Stamp to the officers and request that officials let the thief off the hook.  From there, the two meet again and again as the thief wants his loot back, but the prince convinces the thief to act as his body guard for a period of time.  The thief soon realizes the prince's high level kung-fu abilities, and he signs up to be a disciple to the prince.  During the time of the kung-fu training, many attempts are made to assassinate the prince.  It turns out the assassination attempts are made by one of the other princes as the emperor is about to announce who will be the next crown prince.  Though this prince is a super good guy and has no interest in being an emperor, someone seems to want to make sure he has no chance if assassinated.  The goal now is for the prince to stay alive until he can reach the royal palace to see his father, and the job of his disciple is to protect the prince until he gets there.",1524009600,,1708,4.296875
