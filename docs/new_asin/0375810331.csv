1954,1,0375810331,I so regret buying this movie. Why is it called Arthur's Perfect Christmas? The kids spend very little time on Christmas and more time trying to convince us that there are other religions just as worth while. Avoid at all costs!,1022630400,21,228,4.585365853658536
1955,5,0375810331,"This tape is pretty funny,especially the part when Uncle Fred's home video showed his dog,Rory chewing on a TV,with Uncle Fred saying,Rory,that's not a doggy toy,when he chewed it up! I would recommend this tape to any Arthur fan.",975283200,4,230,4.923076923076923

1958,5,0375810331,"According to my kid, this is the greatest Christmas movie of all time. She hasn't actually said that, but she's watched this on Amazon Prime enough that I think they finally removed it as she was using too much network bandwidth. I've never made it all the way through the movie, but I have one of the songs from it forever embedded in my brain. Tina, Tina, Tiny, Tina. Tina, Tina, Tiny, Tina, Tina, Tina, Tiny, Tina. Tina - the Talking Tabby! Please make it stop.

Joking aside. The a main theme of the story is discussing the Christmas traditions of various cultures. While normally these story lines attempt to ruin any sort of holiday magic you might be into, all were covered in a very kid-friendly way that won't ruin things for your child.",1513900800,,746,4.525925925925926

1963,5,0375810331,"I used to watch this movie on the tv when I was a child (I am 24 now) and I still watch it. It's by far the best show I saw as a child. It would come on every Christmas at 7 am when I was a child on pbs.  It's doesn't come on now or for the last decade or so. And it's been such a bummer. I used to never received any gifts for Christmas because my parents could never afford anything. I didn't realized this as a child, but I know now.  And what made it better was this coming on and watching it Christmas, year after year of no gifts, this movie that came on at 7 am would be the only thing consistent that would be around on Christmas. So I just though I was a bad kids growing up, but watching this movie made me feel better. It's was literally my childhood and when it stop coming on, it broke my heart. Now that I am older, I can afford things for my family, nieces, and nephews. And I saw today that it was on prime. I literally cried while I put it on for them. This movie makes my heart melt.",1509753600,,1001,3.8076923076923075

Arthur always had such a prevalence in our lives that I think I became attached to Arthur, too. :) So it's probably no surprise that I really love this DVD. I also love all things Christmas. So Christmas plus Arthur... well... winner winner chicken dinner!! :) :) :) (Yes, I am kidding.

Although it does not go into depth of all of the different holidays celebrated outside of christmas or christmas itself, it is one of the only kid shows that actually exposes children to the existence of these other holidays. It's a kids show so its obviously not going to go into great detail and it has a great message that sometimes we place these huge expectations on holidays and in turn they become very materialistically driven when in reality the importance is enjoying the day itself with those you love.",1454457600,,533,4.680851063829787

The picture quality and audio is great. The story shows the people of Elwood City all celebrating the holidays in different ways, and how all of them are important. For Arthur fans, there's D.W. hi-jinks, funny friend interactions, and cute musical numbers. But I think even people who aren't familiar with the characters would enjoy it.

2099,3,0375810331,"I don't know, im really one the fence.  for Arthur, it was typical and true to the fashion of the books.  I would say D.W. was extremely whiney to the point I explained to my 4 year old I never want to see her act like that.  there is also the issue of Santa where the mother cant find the much wanted gift, and Santa clearly didn't come. if you are a believer in Santa with kids who listen intently to storylines, I would chose a different movie.  the other holidays of hanakkah and kwanza where explained in much more detail than Christmas.",1420588800,,542,4.233009708737864

Should have been called Stressful Winter Celebrations and how to make them all blend.  If it's a Christmas movie, then stick to the topic.  Let us know more about those traditions and customs.  Sounded more like ""let's just not make Christmas that big a deal"", was the theme.  Would love to have heard more about what the spirit of Christmas is really all about.  Why do we celebrate it?  That's what really makes it perfect.  (This was more about being politically correct.  Downplay Christmas and pull in all the other holidays)  I'm a retired teacher and I always enjoyed teaching about all of the winter holidays.  But each one got it's own presentation....including Christmas.",1419465600,,782,4.885496183206107

2252,2,0375810331,If you want a wide spectrum exhibit of all beliefs including being a Gnostic this is your movie. I am a practicing Catholic and I had to turn this off while watching because it seems to undermine Christmas and try to show that there are many other beliefs during this time. It should have been named Arthur's guide to the winter season and practices. I  guess that is what you get with Arthur type stuff.,1387324800,,404,4.386666666666667

2254,5,0375810331,"Arthur's Perfect Christmas has become our favorite holiday movie.  The movie is warm and endearing.  It blends various themes of giving, caring, family, friendship and belief with humor and innocence. Adults will enjoy the movie as much as younger children.  It carefully handles the issue of whether Santa is real - DW is convinced that Santa is real and asks Arthur to write a letter to Santa for her, while her mother struggles to find Tina the Talking Tabbie - the gift she has asked Santa to bring.",1387065600,,503,4.693181818181818

I've always loved it because not only is it very fun, it teaches kids tolerance and helps them understand other faiths and situations. It goes beneath the commercialized coating of Christmas these days and shows that the holidays are about family, in whichever way you celebrate them. Even if I have to keep an archaic dvd player, I want to keep this and watch it with my kids. Even though they can't pronounce lutefisk correctly, I can't stress enough how wonderful, happy, and classic this shows is for me.",1386633600,,616,4.660550458715596

2264,4,0375810331,"I think we originally saw this on the TV one Christmas years ago. Our cable provider listed out Holiday shows in the Kids Section during the Season and I found it one year so I got the family together and we watched it. I ended up purchasing it on DVD since it wasn't on the following Christmas and I didn't have Prime at that time. Anyway, on to the review ...

The show has a couple musical numbers in it which is not a normal feature of the kid's series. They're cute and provide a nice touch. The usual cast of characters are there and we learn a little more about each of them and what they do during their own Holiday celebrations. Every Holiday is covered which has become the norm for many Christmas shows; making sure no one feels left out. As such, you'll learn a little bit about each of those Holidays throughout the vignette of the storyline. Sadly, they keep Christmas focused on the commercial end of it and do not touch upon the sacred core about Christ's birth. But, that isn't distracting or forced, it just is. Arthur's dad does insert a nod to Biblical times when he decides to ditch the usual turkey and taters for first century foods. Neither are the other Holiday celebrations forced into the storyline. They flow naturally and overall the whole show highlights themes such sacrifice, friendship, love, togetherness, etc.

Marc Brown's characters are true-to-life in that he does a fine job having them mirror how kids act in the real world. As such, their reactions provide lots of opportunities to talk to your kids about what is happening during the show. At least, that's how we watch shows. : )

Final analysis, enjoyable Holiday fare; fun for the whole family.",1382832000,,1689,4.586092715231788

2267,5,0375810331,"This annual movie on PBS is a favorite of mine, and now my daughters have taken a shine to it as well. Arthur and some of his friends are struggling to meet the cultural ideal of a ""perfect Christmas."" In the process, they learn that the best holidays are personal, and meaningful precisely because of those heartfelt aspects that cannot be purchased in a store or gleaned from advertisements. This is also the rare holiday movie that acknowledges those people who may not celebrate Christmas. It's a heartwarming experience for any viewer, and makes this father's eyes misty every year.",1378512000,,587,4.88

The only reason as to why it did not receive 5 stars was because the voices are different...I'm not one for changing character voices although I realize Authur can't stay eight years old forever.  I just like the focus being in the everyday life of a little boy who's dealing with growing pains lol.  I would recommend it however don't depend on the episode to put you in the Christmas spirit alone... :)",1356307200,,506,4.662921348314606

They discuss Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, St. Lucia Day and a non-religious celebration all wrapped up with an interesting story (and a lesson or two) about friendship, family and the true spirit of the holiday season-regardless of your religion.

This year, we can't find the DVD in our Christmas bins! I'm so relieved to find it here on Amazon because it's pretty old (not sure why to says it was released this year, it's at least 10 years old).

Then they stopped showing it and it wasn't available on Netflix so I bought the DVD.  My 16 year old son who grew up with Arthur was so happy to share the movie with his 8 year old sister who hasn't seen it since she was very little.  Francine sings a Hanukkah song and The Brain a Kwanzaa song and there is just so much holiday fun - this will very quickly become a favorite in your house, as well!!",1354147200,,562,3.9035087719298245
2301,5,0375810331,"I already knew what I was getting when I ordered this; I've seen the televised special about a dozen times.  Our local PBS station has not been broadcasting it recently, so when I saw it was coming to DVD (and at a great price)I just grabbed it.  This disc is pretty bare-bones, but I wasn't getting it for behind-the-scenes information or a lofty commentary.  I just wanted to see Arthur and his friends.  This does the trick.

The special is an hour instead of the series' usual half-hour.  The extra time is nicely used to show the different ways that Arthur's friends celebrate the holidays.  We learn that the Brain and his family celebrate Kwanzaa, that Francine and the rest of the Frenskys go to the movies on Christmas, and that Muffy is too oblivious to realize that her insistence on Christmas parties and trappings is offensive to her friend Francine.  We see Buster and his mother, and a sweet, sweet depiction of how Binky Barnes spends his Christmas.  DW and her lust for this year's Christmas ""it"" and Arthur's wish to give his mother the perfect present are the components of the A story.

Sweet, gentle, appealing to both children and adults, ""Arthur's Perfect Christmas"" is a treasured addition to our holiday movie/special stash.",1353024000,,1249,4.767441860465116

2303,3,0375810331,"Looking for something to watch with the kids (3 & 7), threw a dart at the free ""Amazon Prime Kids' Videos"" and watched this.  It is reasonably enjoyable but not much more.  There are quite a few story lines going on at once (Buster's mom and her emotional issues at Christmas, Arthur's search for the perfect Christmas present for mom, DW's anxiety over whether or not she'll get what she really wants from Santa, etc) so it isn't really focused enough to command much of an identity.  It's hard to capture much magic with a few too many varied story lines shifting back and forth.  My biggest complaint is the very forced multicultural element - not surprising since this is a PBS program, but it felt too educational & preachy in its covering of all the faith bases.  I'd prefer they make some unique holiday shows about Hanukkah and Kwanza instead of forcing the politically correct gamut at the expense of a more engaging story.
I imagine if your kids are fans of Arthur they'll enjoy this one just fine.  There's nothing especially wrong with it, but there's also nothing especially memorable about it either.  Worth a rental at best.",1334966400,4,1139,4.665

2326,5,0375810331,"If you're familiar with the Arthur program airing on PBS, you already know just how clever this show can be. Created by Marc Brown and based on his books, Arthur Read is an aardvark who shares adventures (and misadventures!) with friends like Buster Baxter (a rabbit), Francine Frensky (a monkey), Binky Barnes (a bulldog), Muffy Crosswire (a very RICH monkey), and others. Arthur is often at odds with his little sister D.W. (Dora Winifred) which makes for much of the shows comedic moments.

In Arthur's Perfect Christmas, the scene begins with Arthur sitting at the piano, softly playing Pachebel's Canon. This movie, like the TV show, uses day-dream sequences--and Arthur plunges into a snazzy song called ""Perfect Christmas"". You see, this holiday, Aruthur wants it to be absolutely PERFECT...but things go wrong in the town of Elwood City, for both Arthur AND his friends!

For example, Muffy expects Francine to attend her big Christmas party, but Francine has told Muffy REPEATEDLY that her family is having a Hannukah gathering the same night. What happens when Francine doesn't show up for the party to receive her present?

Buster Baxter worries about his Mom who seems to obsess over having a perfect Christmas for her son, especially since the divorce. Buster comes up with ""Baxter Day"" which takes the pressure of his Mom and displays the true meaning of the holidays--love and kindness.

Arthur searches the mall for presents for his parents, D.W. is desperate for a Tina the Talking Tabby (whose theme song haunts Arthur everywhere he goes!), Uncle Fred makes an unexpected visit on his way to a Floridian Christmas, and Arthur's Dad insists on making an ""authentic"" dinner that was likely served in Bethlehem over 2000 years ago.

Holidays such as Kwanzaa and Hanukkah are also highlighted making this a fun and informative DVD.

I bought the Arthur's Perfect Christmas DVD for my son several years ago and it's STILL his favorite. I just brought out the Christmas DVD's and VHS's and he plays this one several times a day. It's filled with fun songs (24 of them!), witty banter, and clever wordplay. Not only that, there's a great message that expectations often disappoint and that a wonderful experience can arise out of mishaps and situations not going as planned.

This 60 minute DVD doesn't have any extras (except for previews of other Arthur DVD's), but this excellent movie is well worth the price in my opinion. My husband and I get a kick out of the cleverness shown in Arthur TV series and this movie is no exception. And as I said, it's my son's favorite holiday movie.

Highly recommended for kids and parents alike!",1132704000,28,2647,4.906040268456376

2329,5,0375810331,"""What a wonderful kind of day when we can learn to work & play & get along with each other!""

Arthur is a rare kind of cartoon that is made for everyone; it is about a community of very different characters that live together peacefully and are accepting of one another.  No matter how different they are from each other, they ""get together and make things better by working together,"" with open eyes, ears, and minds, knowing that ""every day when you're walking down the street, everybody that you meet has an original point of view.""  The Arthur Christmas special does exactly what is expected of it: it applies the cartoon's main theme to the holiday season & places it in a story told from the point of view of a little boy who always tries to understand others' points of view.  It may not be everyone's perfect Christmas, but it is ""ARTHUR'S Perfect Christmas.""

On this page we have another case of people reviewing their religion instead of the DVD.  Don't be turned off by the reviews that say Arthur is anti-Christian; all of my family and friends, both Christian and non-Christian, love watching the Arthur special with their kids every year.  (Contrary to the popular misunderstanding, the holiday now known as Christmas was not invented as a Christian holiday; it was only adopted by Christians in the 1800s, so there is no reason that all Christmas specials have to be Christian Christmas specials.)  Also, consider the source of a critique before letting it affect your decision to see the movie.  For example, puremorals4ever over-criticized Arthur in his review in the name of his religion, though he gave 5 stars to SpongeBob SquarePants, which had a Christmas special that was very much less catering to the reviewer's fundamentalist Christianity than the Arthur special was.

After reading all of the reviews, I STILL don't know if it this DVD is good enough in quality to replace my old VHS copy.  Reviewers, tell me about the special features; tell me about the sound and picture quality; tell me if it doesn't work in some DVD players.  Each shopper has a different idea of what a ""puremoral"" is; shoppers don't care if the storywriters' values are different from those of one individual buyer.  What shoppers want to know about is the quality of the DVD, not whether or not you agree with the Arthur writers' message that a community works best when each person works together and realizes that others have views that are different from their own.",1095292800,12,2471,4.772300469483568
