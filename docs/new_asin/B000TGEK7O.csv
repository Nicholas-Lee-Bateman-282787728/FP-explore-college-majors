modern tween Like ""The Batman"". As someone who has invested alot in Scooby Dvds, Warner will never see a dime of my money for this garbage. I'm tired of the influence and or take over of Anima to our American characters.",1199577600,3,292,4.327272727272727
2897312,1,B000TGEK7O,I'd rather watch any episodes with Scrappy-Doo on repeat for 24 hours straight than watch this travisty of a Scooby-Doo show. Bah!,1193443200,3,130,4.954545454545454
2897313,4,B000TGEK7O,"When I first saw this show listed on my TV guide I was surprised. Hoping it would be somewhat entertaining as What's New Scooby-Doo had seemed to stop airing I gave it a shot.

I was surprised to say the least. First off, the animation is nothing like any Scooby-Doo show made before. As another reviwer mentioned it can be an eyesore before you get used to the style. Additionally, only Shaggy and Scooby take the stage for the majority of the show. However the one shocker that I was not ready for was that Kasey Kasem is not the voice of Shaggy, a possible first. But, though I'm not sure why, I learned through Wikipedia that he voices Shaggy's uncle who appears every so often, frequently sending the duo messages via the butler robot. (Odd trivia: Kasem's wife, Jean, voices 'Cat Lady' on the show. Go figure.)

Ideally I would not have been satisfied with the setup for this show but ultimately I found that while not fluid with the other shows, even the childish-but-funny A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, it is still entertaining. On top of that, with very few good shows on Saturday mornings now and MANY of those recycled animes with repetitive plots and subpar dubbing I find that this one is not that bad, even when compared to shows from ten years ago.

On a side note, Frank Welker does provide the voice Scooby-Doo, a task he has performed well ever since Don Messick (the original voice from 1969). He also does Fred Jones (when present), a role he has held since the origin of the characters in Scooby-Doo, Where Are You? Mindy Cohn returns as Velma Dinkley, and Grey DeLisle reprises her role as Daphne Blake (Both for infrequent appearances, but still present). Both have held the roles of their characters for many years as well, Grey Delisle a very succesful VA in her own standing.

Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get A Clue is an above average show, but not spectacular. For parents I'd say there is hardly anthing to worry about. Violnce is minimal, and always slap-stick. An all around enjooyable half hour for any kid.",1191801600,5,2025,4.6011080332409975
2897314,5,B000TGEK7O,"Shag and Scoob have never been this entertaining before.  I've watched them  transform through the years, and this is the only version, of these unlikely heroes, that consistently has me laughing out loud. The comedy is very refreshing, well timed and keeps you guessing.  It's a ray of sunshine on Saturday mornings, where there are less and less good cartoons to watch. I highly recommend this show for all ages!",1184889600,5,414,4.885714285714286
2897315,1,B000TGEK7O,"This is  a travesty of a show. The animation is done in an odd muted pallet and the plotlines are inane.
Shag + Scooby inherit a fortune only to discover that they will now have to deal with a mad.... I think he's supposed to be a scientist but he doesn't seem bright enough to earn a degree. He does have henchmen.
I tried and tried to enjoy this show as I am a lifelong scooby fan but this is awful!!!!",1184630400,5,404,3.9876543209876543

This is not those shows. Yes it has Shaggy and Scooby, even Velma, Daphne, and Fred often. However this is not your average Scooby-Doo show. But is that necessarily a bad thing? The animation and Shaggys voice get some taking used to but around the 3rd or 4th episode you watch, you will really like this show. It is pretty funny and has an interesting plot. You just have to keep in mind that its not your average Scooby-Doo show and just enjoy it for what it is: A funny TV show that has a good plot, fun characters, and good jokes.

  It still has its downsides, however; there robot servant Robi can get just a tad annoying at times as he destroys there house and what not. Not only that but you have to stick with this show. The first episode might horrify you as to what they have done to the show... KEEP WATCHING!!! The second episode doesn't seem bad, but not good. The third episode will have you smiling and you will be used to Shaggys voice, the animation and even Robi. By the fourth episode you will be laughing and enjoying this show! You just have to stick with it and enjoy it for the show it is. Don't compare it to the original Scooby-Doo shows. Please give it a try; you will be glad you did. If you're still not sure about this show, watch it for free on the Kids [...]",1272067200,3,1622,4.955882352941177

2897319,1,B000TGEK7O,This cartoon is the sadest knock-off of Scooby-Doo cartoons that I have ever seen.  It is worse than a generic version.  A kindergartener could have drawn Shaggy and Scooby-Doo better than the cartoonists did in this version.,1238889600,,225,5.054054054054054
2897320,4,B000TGEK7O,"My boys love this show.  I think it is one of the best on Saturday mornings right now.  Dr. Phibes is HILARIOUS!!!  My boys laughed for days when he got the giant wedgie!  It is all just good fun and a lot of humour.  We give it 4 stars.  Not the original, but who cares?  Enjoy it with your kids, you won't be sorry!",1216252800,2,317,3.859375
2897321,4,B000TGEK7O,"Ok to be frank the artwork/colorization is lower than just about every other Scooby franchise piece that has been created. Outside of that It really is not to be judged against the traditional Scooby doo ""Mystery"" types. It is a cartoon in the scooby doo world, that has characters from Scooby Doo, but that's about it. When my son picked it for his birthday I thought that I would shortly be put through cartoon hell. We have just about every other scooby doo made and the kids love them and I enjoyed them also. After watching it it was a pleasant surprise. The artwork took alot to get used to it still is beneath the usual scooby standards but it is fine in it's own way. The real standouts are the writing and the voice acting which is superb. The secondary characters are interesting and funny and best of all it passed the kids test. It is one of their most requested.",1209081600,6,875,4.407407407407407
2897322,3,B000TGEK7O,"I don't watch much TV anymore. I instead prefer to watch DVD's of the cartoons i enjoy. It wasn't until late last year that i found out my cable provider carries the network this cartoon series originates from: The Cin CW. It airs at 8am on Saturday mornings and i'm an all-night worker and am not awake on Saturday morning when the show is on. Anyway, i bought this DVD on a whim because it only contains a few episodes from the series. Having said that, i've seen things i've liked and not liked about the show but i don't feel i could make an in-depth overview of a series with only a few episodes to go by. The reviews on here are 50/50. The character design to my eyes is clearly inspired from the live-action films and i take it the furor is over the characters not looking like the traditional way they've always appeared. The plot of the series i found goofy, but goofy is also funny...it's nonsensical humor. This isn't sophisticated humor with a lot of wit or anything...Scooby cartoons were never meant to be viewed in the same light as something from a Looney Tunes director or the Jay Ward cartoons which were aimed at adults. The plot focuses around Shaggy, Scooby, and the main villain Dr Phibes. I think the portions that focus on the over-the-top Phibes and his underlings are a riot. The vocal for Shaggy is Scott Menville who, ironically, provided the voice of Red Herring on A PUP NAMED SCOOBY-DOO. The vocal takes some getting used to because Casey Kasem as well know has a distinct voice and even though Casey wasn't using his natural voice for Shaggy, you still knew it was Casey and so anyone who takes up the character of Shaggy is fairly or unfairly compared to Casey. I read that Shaggy was going to be written as more of a meat-eater, not a vegetarian, and so Casey didn't want to do the character but instead is heard as Shaggy's uncle. Look for a hilariously dead-pan parody of Ted Knight on the episode entitled ""High Society"" which spoofs pieces of Knight's movie, Caddyshack. Honestly, the series is not that bad if one doesn't have a hang-up on the character design and i wish there had been more episodes to get an even better viewing of the series and i'm sure there will be a DVD release containing the entire first season and i'll bet this release is a 'test' to see if there's a demand. Admittedly this is not your standard ""i would've gotten away with it if it weren't for you meddling kids"" series but i like the silliness of this particular version. The next Scooby series, and i assume there will be one, i predict will be back in the more familiar design.",1205884800,3,2599,4.46218487394958
2897323,4,B000TGEK7O,"My boys, 4 & 6, really thought this DVD was hilarious.  They were giggling and rewinding to see some scenes over and over again.  They cannot wait for the next DVD with Scooby & Shaggy.  My 9 year old thinks it's funny, but not that funny, which is why I gave it 4 stars.",1203292800,,271,3.9814814814814814
2897324,3,B000TGEK7O,"The show is fine, but it  isn't the original full gang.  Like the title says it's about Shaggy & Scoob.  And yes it is quite different in formula and artwork.  There is a standard (and not unfunny) nemisis character rather than ghosts and such and it is way updated, hip-attempt art.

It's like the Tean Titans, fans of the original 60s print versions hated the manga version but the manga tv shows were fine and - for some folks - a lot more fun when taken in their own right.  Same deal here.

To say you're outraged by the show is just plain silly, it's not NASA cutbacks, it's a scooby doo series.  It's an ok show and given the choice between this and Pup Named Schooby Doo I'd definitely rather my kids watch this (and I prefer it myself for fun too:) )

About the collection... here we go again with the Scooby ""best of"" mini sets.  I'm a bit tired of buying partial sets only to later be able to buy the whole season.  I Tivoed these to have the whole set for my young son, when the entire season is released in one box I'll pay but not till then.  If you however haven't ever seen these and your kids already have everything else related to scoooby go ahead and pay the ten bucks, ignore the naysayers (sheesh, it's a cartoon for gosh sakes).",1200009600,4,1251,4.232067510548523
2897325,1,B000TGEK7O,"There is nothing good to say about this show.  I had hoped that the makers of Scooby would have learned from their Scrappy fiasco.  But, this show makes one look fondly on Scrappy.  Any time that ""the gang"" is not really in a show, look out.

Even the art in this show is bad.  Frankly, it isn't Scooby.  Looks nothing like Scooby.  Music doesn't sound like Scooby.  Dialog is not Scooby.  Everything that makes the Scooby shows great is sadly missing in this show.",1200009600,3,465,4.440476190476191

8208907,2,B000TGEK7O,"This cartoon wasn't half bad for a Saturday morning cartoon, it was just awful for a Scooby-Doo cartoon and it is being judged as such. It's like they had an original idea that they couldn't sell so they tagged the Scooby-Doo name on it. They seriously could've changed the characters and the title, and it'd be fine. But alas, it's another addition to the Scooby franchise, and it's easily the worst. The redesigns of your favorite characters are simplistic, and blocky. Shaggy's voice actor (Scott Menville, Robin in ""Teen Titans"") sounds nothing like Shaggy. Fred, Velma and Daphne are mostly absent from this one, save for a few guest appearances. I really wish this wasn't called Scooby-Doo so I didn't have to judge it so harshly and it wouldn't be connected to the franchise.",1409011200,,782,4.843283582089552

8208910,1,B000TGEK7O,"As a longtime Scooby-Doo fan, I must say Shaggy & Scooby-Doo has got to be 1 of the WORST shows I've ever watched in my entire life! I only saw 1 episode of it on the CW  and I turned it off after 3 minutes into the episode. The animation looked too tacky, Shaggy sounds like he has an extremely bad case of laryngitis (they changed Shaggy's voice actor from Casey Kasem to Scott Menville who played Red Herring in A Pup named Scooby-Doo), and Fred, Daphne and Velma are only in a few episodes! A few episodes! Also, I hate Scooby's appearance with just dots for eyes like Shaggy. Overall, after Kids' WB was tarnished with the CW4K!ds, they cancelled this show! (THANK GOD!) All in all, this show sucked @$$ big time and the other Scooby-Doo shows were better (Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, The New Scooby-Doo Movies/Mysteries, A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, The Scooby-Doo (& Scrappy Doo) Show and What's New Scooby-Doo along with the new 1 on Cartoon Network, Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated). Don't watch this show, watch a different Scooby-Doo show!",1350691200,,1046,4.715846994535519

We started watching the ""bonus"" episodes on these DVDs of this newer series ""Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!"" Just like the original series, this one uses a formulaic plot that is replicated each time. My son loved them instantly, and I was skeptical. They actually grow on you though. Definitely not for the Scooby-Doo purist, which is probably why this was a short-ran series.",1349654400,,499,4.617977528089888
