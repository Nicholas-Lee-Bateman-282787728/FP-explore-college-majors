8030384,5,B0002PYS1U,"Based on previous reviews I just had to check this one out.  Like previous reviewers I too had a similar experience with the actor named Michael Kennealy.  His presence was awe inspiring.  I got the feeling that Michael acts for the common man.  He is the type of guy that can pick up a lady in a Las Vegas bar late at night and take her home.  Never mind that the lady has clipped on hair and just had gastro surgery.  He is truly a man of the people.

I like the other stuff about the movie as well.  The Screech and Zack characters were great.  A truly refreshing film.",1160092800,3,572,4.127272727272727
8030385,5,B0002PYS1U,"I watched Just Add Pepper the other night -- with two women ... in my bed ... after a little lovin'  And we all loved it!  We all had low expectations going in, but found the acting to be quite unexpectedly grand.  The gentleman who played the older brother, Michael Kennealy, was outstanding.  He reminded me a lot of the early acting work of Cary Grant -- humorous, flirtatous, whimsicaly, slightly gay, but not in a bad way.

Although the direction seemed a bit heavy-handed, Mr. Basler certainly has a great career ahead of him making Olive Garden commercials or possibly being a sous chef in an Olive Garden -- if they even need such a position there.

Speaking of positions, the ladies were wild that night after seeing this film.  Quite an aphrodisiac!",1159920000,3,759,4.619402985074627
