8410914,2,B002FQJ66Q,Okay we all know the story young girls recruited to go to a foreign country under the auspices of high-paying waitress jobs and whatever else and then stuck in a life of prostitution with no way out and then whatever country they're in putting a burden on the police force that has to sort this mess out if a woman wants to be a prostitute then she has the right to be one if she doesn't want to and is forced to then this is very wrong and there should be an international police force to rescue these women these documentaries are basically all the same and are rented by people who use their services I don't like prostitutes and I don't like people who do but I also think they're human beings and they should be treated well and treated with respect and I think that there should be an international monetary fund set up so they can be repatriated to the country they're from and then become prostitutes in their own country if they want or they can work at Dunkin' Donuts for minimum wage because that's about what's available to them if they're stupid enough to believe that they are being recruited to a foreign country to be a waitress I've seen ones about Thailand and it's the same story Mountain girl gets recruited to go to big city for job that pays five times the normal salary as a waitress you mean to tell me that these girls believe that and there's not anyone their village telling them that this is a story to be disregarded respectfully Johnny Irish,1354579200,,1471,4.391941391941392
