8578690,4,B00C89CUI6,"Super Mario Bros. and the Castlevania miniseries on Netflix aren't the only good video game adaptations: there's also this one. Directed by Takashi Miike, it features Phoenix, Miles and the rest of the gang as they take a case that has ties to their childhoods (made evident with flashbacks where the children hilariously have the same hairstyles as their adult counterparts). Unlike the majority of video game adaptations, it manages to have a compelling story and fleshed-out characters while staying true to its source material. Also, as it is with the best Miike movies, it transitions between over-the-top hilarity and deathly seriousness in a blink of an eye. Oh, and yes, there is plenty of pointing and shouting of ""objection!""",1517961600,,735,5.133333333333334
8578691,4,B00C89CUI6,"Based on the ""second and fourth cases"" of the popular videogame ""Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney"", this stylish, fun, lighthearted mystery is set in a futuristic Japan, where the justice system is so overloaded all court cases are now decided within three days.  Phoenix Wright is a young, inexperienced attorney going up against a former friend-turned-rival, prosecutor Miles Edgeworth (who has yet to lose a case), in defending the sister of his mentor, Mia Fey, when Mia is murdered.  After that case gets Phoenix some fame, his next garners national attention when Phoenix finds himself defending none other than Miles, now accused of murder, against the most revered prosecutor in the country - Manfred von Karma - who has yet to lose in his entire 40-year career.  The mystery is complex, the film much like a videogame come to life as Phoenix traces the case back to an old case of Mia's that may have gotten her killed.  Intriguing, fun - and I want Phoenix's hair!  (from sixtysecondcinema.blogspot.com)",1425859200,,1009,5.017964071856287
8578692,5,B00C89CUI6,"If you love the video games for the DS, this movie will not disappoint. The actor plays Ace perfectly. Surprised that this was Takeshi Miike, but, he's a genius so I shouldn't be.",1396051200,,179,4.454545454545454
8578693,3,B00C89CUI6,"This is a case where I really should have read the reviews before I bought the product. This specifically is a Chinese bootleg and not an official release; that being said, the English subtitles are actually quite good, but the picture quality is somewhat skewed and it wouldn't work on my TV's dvd player. It did work on my computer, however.",1389571200,3,343,4.639344262295082
8578694,5,B00C89CUI6,"My son loves this game. When I saw that there was a live action drama, I couldn't resist.  He was so surprised and happy.  Of course, he wanted us to watch it as a family.  I wasn't really in the mood for a movie, but I actually enjoyed the over-the-top hair and the ""new noir"" feel of the movie. In the end, it was a fun, family-safe movie.",1389139200,4,341,3.985294117647059
8578695,3,B00C89CUI6,"First i will address something the other reviews didnt, This DVD is clearly a chinese bootleg copy of the original film. I had heard this was getting brought out over in the states some time ago and thought this might be it... but it is not. The quality is clearly lacking compared to even standard dvds. The subtitles are actually understandable unlike alot of these kinds of translations where things like name mispellings and such are common, that said they do tend to go too fast at times (even for me who watches subtitles more then english films). If you just want to see the movie and don't care about the quality then go for it; its not a bad price, But if you want a good copy i suggest waiting for the official NA release whenever that is.",1383436800,22,749,4.39568345323741
8578696,5,B00C89CUI6,"Ace Attorney is one of my favorite video games and I do not know that they will made a film. This film is almost based on the video game for example: Phoenix Wright will not be in Turnabout Samurai on this film except Miles Edgeworth and Von Karma is not cruel like his video game counterpart. Phoenix Wright, the main hero of the entire series (Narimiya) had successfully defended his best friend Larry Butz, but he will defend his another best friend, rival and prosecutor of Turnabout Sisters, Miles Edgeworth (Saito) of murder charges of a prosecutor and the infamous DL6 incident about his father's brutal murder against Von Karma (Ishibashi) a ruthless prosecutor and the main villain of the first Ace Attorney game and this film, who had not lost a trail for 40 years. Will Phoenix Wright successfully defended his friend from the ruthless Von Karma and find out his dark secret. I gave this film 5 stars like the video games and I wish they will make a 2nd Ace Attorney film.",1382400000,,983,4.622857142857143
8578697,5,B00C89CUI6,"I was surprised at how good this movie was. We all know that video game movies aren't done that well (unless it's Pokemon but that's not life action). To add to that, it's a Capcom based franchise and most live actions aren't that good (I'm looking at Resident Evil).

Let's talk about the things that they changed in this movie. This movie is based on the first game with the movie focusing on case 1-2 and 1-4. 1-1 and 1-3 are easily glossed over in the first five minutes to get the plot going and to establish what the characters are and not capable of. The movie for example plays Phoenix as incompetent in 1-1 with Mia solving the case for Phoenix (then again, she did do the same thing in the game but it wasn't as obvious) while establishing Edgeworth as ruthless with how he handles the 1-3 case (which leaned toward comedy). Right off the bat, you notice obvious differences such as...(there might be some spoilers for those who haven't played the game but going into this movie, chances are you played the game).

1. Mia is working on the case that killed Gregory Edgeworth as a way to clear her mother's name instead of focusing on a different case entirely that included Redd White.
2. Maya looks older but she lacks her bubbly personality from the game. (Then again, this movie is more serious so most of the comedy moments are gone). She's very serious and broken in the movie compared to shrugging it off in the game.
3. Gumshoe is younger and GASP more competent.
4. The murder of Gregory Edgeworth happens in the evidence room instead of the elevator thus Miles does not have his fear of earthquakes. He also hates defense attorneys because he thought his father was trying to destroy evidence rather than thinking that the defense letting a criminal go free.
5. The Spirit Channeling comes off as more creepy than in the actual game. When it happens, only Phoenix can see Mia which now makes it seem like he's hallucinating (to be fair, this works better given how the game works on the logic that they do and don't acknowledge spirit channeling).
6. Von Karma actually isn't as cruel as he is in the game. His constant harassment of Phoenix in the game is pretty much absent as when he does complain, they are legit complaints instead of him being a jerk (and because of that the judge isn't abused either).
7. Redd White isn't as fabulous and fills the role for April May for ""witnessing"" the murder of Mia Fey and has some Mike Meekins persona when he starts flipping out on the stand.

With this in mind, the movie is VERY faithful to the game. The guy who plays Phoenix NAILS his character down. I also give props to the guy who plays Larry. Larry fills the role of the comedy relief when Maya fails to do that and he does it VERY well. Combined with Phoenix's nervous wreck on the stand, it's a hilarious dynamic. My particular favorite scene is Larry throwing something at Redd White and not being kicked out of the court room because of it. It's very enjoyable despite some of these major changes but as a result, the movie can stand alone and you can get enough laughs and tears from it. I definitely recommend the movie to any Ace Attorney fan.

 If I could rate on a half star system, it would be 4.5 out of 5 (or 90 out of 100 because I was enjoying this movie with a friend).",1373155200,12,3307,4.432565789473684
