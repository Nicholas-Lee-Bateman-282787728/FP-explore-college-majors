2691459,2,B000KHME7U,"Pitched as `the movie the oil companies don't want you to see' but instead proving to be the movie nobody wanted to see, The Formula is a classic example of how blockbuster novels so often turn into mundane films. It has a solid cast, a solid script, solid production values - everything, in fact, but a reason to watch it. It's one of those lethargic thrillers where cardboard characters constantly talk to each other about things that happened offscreen and which the film would have been far better showing us as George C. Scott's LA cop uncovers a conspiracy involving a Nazi formula for synthetic fuel that Marlon Brando's eccentric oilman wants kept under lock and key so he can artificially inflate the price of oil. The teaming of Oscar's two most famous refusniks sadly provides no sparks - indeed, there was reportedly more drama offscreen at the time between director John G. Avildsen and writer/producer Steve Shagan over the re-editing of the film, so it's a genuine surprise to find them jovially sharing the audio commentary on Warners' new DVD. Not that it seems that anyone else was so passionate about the film: there's no shortage of class talent here (John Gielgud and Beatrice Straight also turn up), but it's clear that the paycheck is of more interest to them than the script and they're just slumming it. Not a terrible movie, just a rather flat, uneventful and predictable one.

Warners' widescreen 1.85:1 DVD transfer is adequate, but not up to their usual standards, with the mono soundtrack particularly flat. Despite the packaging stating it includes a Brando trailer gallery, the only extra is the audio commentary.",1168905600,4,1645,4.91726618705036

2691472,5,B000KHME7U,"There's a reason you may have never heard of ""The Formula."" Actually, make that several reasons.
Best quote: ""You're not in the OIL business, you're in the OIL SHORTAGE business!"" -- George C. Scott

This film's plot centers on police lieutenant Barney Caine, played with immense presence by George C. Scott. He is called into service to investigate the murder of a friend former colleague who was discovered executed in his own bed. However, the film does not simply begin with this murder scene. No, it begins with one chapter of US history that mainstream teachers and politicians would rather you forget about: the close of WWII and the desperate US intel's acceptance and immersion of Nazi scientists and military brass into the American military industrial complex. Wermacht General Helmet Kladen is tasked with walking important scientific documents into American hands in a faux-escape attempt most importantly so that Russian soldiers do not acquire said documents.

The same American colonel who heads the arrest of Kladen on the German frontier is also the man whose murder Caine is investigating near the beginning of the film. As Caine delves deeper into the murder, he discovers that some of the acquaintances of the deceased are being killed soon after he speaks with them. Among the shadowy movers and shakers Caine interrogates are industry and science heavyweights, played by GD Spradlin, John Gielgud and Marlon Brando. Caine's course leads him inexorably to a secret that's worth killing for: a complicated recipe for a ""clean-burning"" fuel derived from coal that was formulated by Gielgud's Nazi character near the end of the war.

""The Formula"" features a complicated, twisting, multi-level plot which if you miss a minute of it, you'll probably need to go back and watch what you missed. The film drags the oil industry into the light of day for what it is, hence my above quote of Scott's character. SPOILER: the coal derivative fuel equation is ultimately HIGHLY prized by the oil industry in the film, which is why so many connected to it die. Now you and I both know the oil industry of today wouldn't hesitate to kill to suppress such alternative fuel sources. The final verbal confrontation between Scott and Brando is something that severely escapes today's filmmakers to a great degree. The writing (Steve Shagan, based on his novel) is terrific and the acting is similarly impressive. When combined with the film's brutal honesty towards a cutthroat industry in which today's politicians send other peoples' children to fight in decades-long wars, ""The Formula"" is a film I truly wish were more widely popular/distributed than it is.",1419379200,,2665,5.079908675799087

At this writing, we have not received this DVD, but know this one well having watched it a few times over the years. The actors are good and the overall plot is good. We would agree it definitely could have been edited better to tie the sub plots together. Therefore if one is not too picky, one can enjoy this movie.

2691475,4,B000KHME7U,"It's an old urban legend. Or maybe it's the worst-kept secret in the world. It might be both. It is...the formula for synthetic fuel that can run all gas-based engines more efficiently and ecologically, at a fraction of the cost. If it existed, it would be the greatest advance in mass transportation since the invention of the steam engine. And it would put the big oil companies out of business. All of them. Permanently. Naturally, Big Oil will do anything--ANYTHING--to keep this formula off the market. And only one man can stop them. Or can he...?

Steve Shagan's bestselling novel, THE FORMULA, was filmed in 1980 by director John G. Avildsen (ROCKY, THE KARATE KID). George C. Scott plays the burnt-out, divorced cop who stumbles on a string of dead bodies and an insidious plot to keep the world enslaved to the gas engine. Marthe Keller is the mysterious woman who may or may not be trying to help him. Marlon Brando is the ubiquitous oil tycoon who opposes him. Scott runs all over Europe and America, constantly pursued by a bunch of bad guys. Wherever he goes, things blow up and more people die. There are only two scenes between Scott and Brando, but they're the best scenes in the film. This is a fun, fast-paced thriller with a plot that doesn't bear close scrutiny (Why don't they just kill him, for Pete's sake!). The book and film arrived at the height of late-1970s paranoia, with oil shortages, high prices, and long lines at gas stations, and that explains why it was popular at the time. But it holds up very well today. I guess we're all still hoping that this synthetic fuel dream becomes a reality. Recommended.",1414800000,2,1638,4.6678200692041525

Good subplot about how the oil companies control the oil economy and, consequently, the world economy (some things never change).

The plot involves a Nazi discovery of a formula that allows mass production of synthetic fuel. The formula disappeared at the end of WWII and resurfaces some decades later. The oil companies, of course, will stop at nothing to keep it off the market.
It's great to see Brando and Scott going at it, since they were both top of the line actors. Brando's character is offbeat to say the least (or at least the way he played the character), but this film is fun to watch.",1386892800,,756,4.649253731343284

This may have been unique in 1982 but it has been over played lately. Still this makes for a great entertaining who-dun-it movie. Yes it had George C. Scott and Marlon Brando at their best. However it was held together by the rest of the cast.

A side note is that I only had two years of German and they never once used anything past that. It was so simple that they probably did not need the subtitles.

The DVD I watched has a voice over commentary by Steve Shagan.

The editing and the plot both seem OK to me. The basic story and the fine acting are both excellent. Scott is top-notch, as usual.

But Brando nearly steals the show with his memorable portrayal of the pudgy oil company tycoon who tells his dense brother (who's complaining about OPEC), ""How many times do I have to tell you, Harold? We ARE OPEC!"" He's the embodiment of the phrase, 'the banality of evil.'

2691493,4,B000KHME7U,"When you have Gielgud and Brando in cameos and George C. Scott starring, there is little doubt that it is worth seeing even if a bomb. This is not a bomb, however, but a conspiracy film, although I didn't feel the conspiracy chosen was particularly stimulating as a subject. I imagine the creative staff bought it because they thought that the gasoline crises of the 70's, marked by the Arab Oil Embargo, would still be fresh in the  public mind. At any rate, Scott is a senior police officer on the LA force, assigned to discover the killer of a long time police officer. The hunt leads him to Germany (in 1980, there were still two Germanies) where he met the necessary beautiful woman. While there are a sufficiency of killings along the way, I would not call this one a thriller, since, while interesting, there is not much suspense or tension moving one along to the conclusion.
For those of us who are of Scott's generation (he was 3 years older than Brando), it is a pleasure to watch him work before age, weight and life's experiences, took the edge off his presence. (The same may be said of Brando.) For the general viewer,  this is a decent conspiracy theory film, not of the first rank, by any means, but adequate to provide a couple of hours of good viewing at a minimal price...essentially shipping cost.",1376524800,,1318,4.556962025316456

2691496,4,B000KHME7U,"This offering comes in a sealed slim case, and its obviously a refugee from the Marlon Brando Collection. The only way you can get THE FORMULA on DVD is either from this offering or with the Brando box set, which at this writing is less than $18 for five Brando movies. As a George C. Scott fan I decided to scoop this film up before it disappears. Some of Scott's more important films, such as THE FILM-FLAM MAN and THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS are not available on DVD except through the expensive secondary market.

The premise of the movie is silly: at the center of the story, which takes place in the late 1970s, is a Nazi formula for making synthetic fuels from coal with no pollution that the oil industry wants to suppress, and will even commit multiple murders to do so. Scott is an LA detective investigating the murder of a friend, a former cop who now works for the oil company headed by Brando.  The investigation takes Scott from LA to Germany and Switzerland. As the bodies pile up, the investigation leads back to LA with the final confrontation between Scott and Brando. Scott realizes he has been been a pawn in a chess game under the control of Brando. Although, only in a few scenes, Brando gives a memorable performance as a bland but evil oil executive who likes Milk Duds and would rather be hiking in the Sierra Mountains, but his sense of patriotism and duty makes him do what he does. Scott, as always, is worth watching as the dedicated cop being manipulated by Brando, his boss and Marthe Keller, a member of a secret German radical group. If you like George C.

2691501,4,B000KHME7U,"Released in 1980, ""The Formula"" is a star-studded crime/thriller about a Los Angeles detective (George C. Scott) who investigates the murder of his friend, a retired cop, which leads to Germany and a Nazi formula for synthetic fuel that big oil naturally wants to suppress at all costs. Marlon Brando plays a shady oil tycoon but only appears for roughly 15 minutes of the almost 2-hour runtime.

The film is top-of-the-line as far as cast, location and cinematography go. It starts off like a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dirty-Harry-Collection-Dirty-Harry-Magnum-Force-The-Enforcer-Sudden-Impact-The-Dead-Pool/dp/B002Z7FWBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dirty Harry Collection (Dirty Harry / Magnum Force / The Enforcer / Sudden Impact / The Dead Pool)</a>&nbsp;flick substituting Scott for Eastwood with his Asian sidekick, but the plot's too complicated and there's not enough action for Dirty Harry fans.

The highlights include the WWII and Nazi elements, acting giants Scott and Brando, the lovely Marthe Keller, the rest of the cast, the great locations (California, Germany and Switzerland) and the emphasis on dialogue above thrills, which may be a detriment to others. Regarding the Nazi elements, there's a brief strip club scene where Nazi imagery is used as a backdrop for the dancers, fittingly showing how yesterday's unspeakable horrors are forgotten by the next generation and utilized for entertainment or recreation.

Brando has proved time and again that he has a knack for playing weird, quirky characters (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Missouri-Breaks/dp/B000B6CO48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Missouri Breaks</a>"", ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apocalypse-Now/dp/6305609705/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apocalypse Now</a>"", ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Godfather/dp/B005DNPFUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Godfather</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Island-of-Dr-Moreau-Unrated-Director-s-Cut/dp/0780619951/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Island of Dr. Moreau (Unrated Director's Cut)</a>"") and he tries to do it here with his portrayal of an oil executive, but with so-so results. I didn't buy it; it comes off as more of a performance rather than a real person. Still, you've gotta give him credit for trying and Brando is always entertaining, even when he fumbles.

The main problem here is the convoluted plot. There are so many names it's hard to keep up (I recommend using the subtitles as it helps keep track). The conclusion is both thought-provoking and unsatisfactory; a strange mix.

So ""The Formula"" is a mixed bag, but its strengths outweigh it's weaknesses, but not by much. It's worthwhile if you're a fan of the stars and if you're in the mood for a thought-provoking and globetrotting crime/thiller that's heavy on talk and light on thrills.

The movie then ""fast forwards"" several decades to present day Los Angeles, where the former American Officer is murdered in his Beverly Hills home. Shortly thereafter the officer's wife is also murdered. George C. Scott is a LAPD ""blood-hound"" Detective who tracks the killers all the way to Berlin.

prices dictated by the oil producing countries holding the non - producing  countrioes of the world  hostage . If you don't pay the pump price you don't have
transportation . I know there have been many inventions of alternate fuels over the years & pattens applied for . Also different means of transportation . A great
example is the ""Tucker Automobile "" that a movie was made about . I had an uncle
who worked at the Tucker Plant in chicago where the Tucker car was first introduced after World war #2 . All the employees were given the chance to purchase one & my uncle put his name on the waiting list . He never got his car .
Not because it was a failure but because the entire auto industry controled all the auto parts & Tucker could not acquire enough for production . After making about 100 they had to stop production . I have read of inventions of fuels that will never be allowed by the oil producing countries to be marketed ""LIKE THE MOVIE"" . During the war Germany had many engineeres invent never dreamed of equipment such as ""Rocket Propelled V 2 Bombs "" ----Why not cheap Fuel that would
control the worlds Oil market? The movie seemed it could be possible to me -----

2691510,2,B000KHME7U,"A classic line from a forgettable film. ""The Formula"" (1980) lives up to its title in the worst possible way. George C. Scott and Marlon Brando (who makes the most of his limited screen time) are the only saving graces in this dull excuse for a thriller. Producer Steve Shagan botches the adaptation of his best-selling novel, with director John G. Avildsen unable to salvage the oily narrative mess. Brando's eccentric imitation of Jerry Lewis in ""The Nutty Professor"" is one for the ages.",1343347200,6,490,4.845238095238095
2691511,4,B000KHME7U,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""The Formula"" starring George C. Scott, Marlon Brando and Marthe Keller. It was sorta billed as a Marlon Brando movie, but it really was a George Scott movie and he did an excellent job. Brando was in the movie, especially toward the end, representing ""Big Oil"" and you'll probably end up loathing him. Nice job, Marlon.

In World War 2, Germany did exceptionally well especially when you realize that they had little in the way of petroleum resources to propel their war machinery. How did they ever manage? Well, they had abundant coal resources and some of their scientists had discovered ways of turning coal into petroleum-like fuels. There was a secret formula and it required secret catalysts. These secrets escaped into Switzerland after the collapse of Germany but failed to again emerge. Well, a lot of people would like to see the secrets out and a lot of others wouldn't. The emergence could totally change the dynamics of the energy industries and some would benefit and some would lose. As one line in the movie put it, it wasn't so much the oil business, but the oil shortage business that was driving the wealth.

The movie begins with a mysterious murder and Scott gets called in to investigate. Shortly thereafter, there's another related murder. The murders seem to indicate a connection to Berlin and Scott is off to a nice German vacation/adventure where he is advised to keep his nose out of German business. Well, you know that's not going to happen or we wouldn't have much of a movie. Scott gets involved. Toward the end he returns to the US and Brando re-enters the picture as a representative of ""Big Oil."" If you think at all about all the energy problems we have and will continue to have, it's a thought-provoking movie. The acting is excellent and the movie production values are high. I would not have it down as a favorite movie, but it was well worth watching.

2691513,2,B000KHME7U,"The Formula, 1980 film

The story begins in wartime, there is a bombing raid in Nazi Germany. A general will take secret documents in hope of a trade. But this truck is captured by the Americans. The war is over. Later a man is summoned by the police to investigate a murder. Lt. Caine sees the body of Neeley. There is a name written in blood! The chauffeur talks. Lt Caine talks to the widow, she doesn't say much. Neeley helped out the ruling class of Beverly Hills. Then he finds widow Neeley was also murdered by the same pistol! Caine visits an oil businessman to learn more. Caine develops a theory about the murders. When OPEC lowers output the price of gasoline goes up. Caine goes to Germany to investigate. America is fortunate to not have organized terrorists. A telephone call summons Caine to the Berlin Zoo to meet a man. Project Genesis created oil from coal. This is a threat to powerful interests, it is best to forget this technology.

Outside a masked man shoots at Caine! His informant won't talk. The niece is questioned. What will she do next? Caine learns about a wartime alliance through shared patents with Americans. He continues his search at Club Venus. They meet the chief scientist who worked on Project Genesis, he tells his history and reveals the secret formula. Caine puts a letter in a safety-deposit box, and mails another. Caine learns more about Lisa, his companion. Lisa tells her story and warns Barney. They go to Berlin to meet Tedesco. ""Auf Wiedersehn."" There is a shocking surprise! Caine returns to Los Angeles. His partner was kidnapped. Caine visits Adam Stifel, the oil businessman to make a deal. He explains the politics behind the plot. A cartel seeks political harmony. Their main interest is in gathering wealth, which has costs. Oil is needed for America's existence. ""Enjoy the chocolates!"" Stifel makes a telephone call and a deal!

This is a somewhat incredible story that fall short of average. Yes, coal can be turned into oil. You also need limestone, water, and cheap labor. Synthetic oil lacks the quality found in natural oil for some applications. [The details are out there.] The solution to America's need for oil requires a political solution, not some chemical formula. America was a net oil exporter before the mid-1960s. The political decision to disperse the population from cities and towns into the suburbs created a dependence on oil and gasoline. Oil companies benefitted greatly from this policy. The rise of supermarkets and shopping malls destroyed local small businesses that used to be within walking distance from most homes. Small farms are no longer close to small towns and cities.

Just as there is no Philosopher's Stone to turn lead into gold there is no cheap solution to America's energy problems. Building office and industrial parks requires long drives on crowded highways and only makes the problems worse. It creates a national risk with any fuel shortage. The costs of highways was followed by general sales taxes in most states (NY in 1964, NJ in 1965). Post-1968 saw stagnant wages and rising taxes. Did such problems cause Rome to fall?",1327881600,,3135,4.865168539325842
2691514,4,B000KHME7U,"The mid 70's were turbulent times, with rampant inflation, rising terrorism, and an energy crunch that saw OPEC assume great power.  The times also saw the rise of a multitude of conspiracy theories, both political and economic.  If the Trilateral Commission rings a bell, then you may be familiar with the kind of distrust of business and government that some felt.  Big oil was also subject to scrutiny, as huge profits were made in the industry.

Out of this unrest and distrust comes The Formula (1980), a film that is mostly concerned with a conspiracy by players in the energy industry, to maximize profitability.  The feeling of paranoia is strong, as a series of murders leads to a LA police being sent to Germany to find information about a mysterious formula related to the manufacture of synthetic fuel.  Competently directed by John G. Avildsen (Rocky, The Karate Kid), the movie remarkably features the first two actors to refuse their Best Actor Oscar, George C. Scott, and Marlon Brando.  Steve Shagan who wrote the original story, also penned the screenplay, and serves as executive producer.

The story begins at the close of World War II, where German General Helmut Kladen (Richard Lynch) entrusted with valuable secrets of the Reich, is captured by American soldiers led by Major Thomas Neely.  Jumping forward to the present, LA police detective Lt. Barney Caine (Scott) is called in to investigate the murder of his old friend, former police chief Tom Neely.  The investigation leads to Caine questioning Adam Steiffel (Brando), a big wheel in the international energy biz.  Steiffel reveals that he employed Neely as a courier, delivering bribe money to his overseas contacts in Europe.  Caine discovers information that Neely's death may be related to his activities in while in Germany during the war, he convinces his superior (in an extended continuous shot) to allow him go to Berlin to try and solve the case.

The movie enters a whole new phase, as Caine arrives in Berlin, and enters a swirling world of intrigue.  Caine engages in some very solid detective work in an atmospheric winter setting, but almost everyone that he speaks with, is murdered soon after.  Caine forms an association with Lisa Spangler (Marthe Keller), the niece of a one of the victims.  Under a lot of stress, Caine is slightly off his game, but he's a damn good detective and eventually uncovers the truth.  Returning home, things unravel a bit, as the remaining answers are revealed.

The scenes between Brando and Scott are notable, as these two screen giants interact mostly one on one.  In their last meeting, Adam Steiffel is supremely confident and has little fear of speaking his mind.  He's a master player, with the world as his chessboard, who with a long term perspective, makes whatever moves are necessary to advance his interests.  Realizing his vulnerability, Cain refrains from getting violent, as the film winds down to a cynical, business as usual finish.  This final confrontation is a little pompous and surreal, but it's something that the film seemingly builds up to.

Director John G. Avildsen, and screenwriter and executive producer Steve Shagan, provide a commentary track which is kind of spotty and little light on technical details.  The men seem to be old friends, and their conversation contains a lot of inside jokes, and anecdotes about cast members, particularly Brando.  Often they seem to be having a private conversation, rather oblivious of any audience.  One interesting revelation is that Shagan wanted Gene Hackman to play Caine, rather than George C. Scott.  Both men seem less than enthusiastic regarding Scott, though the reasons are not specifically stated.

The Formula is well put together, features some good cinematography, and is nicely paced, as a methodical Caine manages to gather together the pieces of the puzzle.  Although distracted by a little romance, the detective gets the job done in a mostly realistic manner.  The sudden and violent murders that occur in Germany, add a little edge to a drama that is a little sparse in the action department.  The plot does include many realistic elements, as the Nazi war machine actually did depend to a large degree, on fuel synthesized from coal.  The desire to utilize Russian oil fields was a factor in Hitler's decision to attack Russia, and the Allies utilized German scientists after the war.  Then as now, the motives of big oil are suspect, and the subject of speculation by some, as energy concerns continue to be a major factor in the economic and political lives of most Americans.",1323302400,5,4600,4.994750656167979

2691517,2,B000KHME7U,"I remember when this movie opened in 1980. I was really excited to see Brando and Scott together on screen (especially Scott). It was the beginning of a frequently repeated lesson. Two legends on the screen at the same time more often than not produce more of a fizzle than a bang. Prophetic and timely this could have been a great film. Instead, at the end you feel like you have been served day old soda.

There are some wonderful bits and scenes in the film, it's just that there are also so many long dull passages that you have to sit through to get to them. The last fifteen minutes of the film almost make the rest of the movie worthwhile. It's so well written and acted that it still packs a timely punch.

Oil is not the only thing that this film nails flatly on the the head but Brando's line ""Human beings are a very complex paradigm. Very very dangerous. They don't want to be leaders they want to be followers. They can't wait to find some nut who they think is just wonderful, to tell them what to do.""

If that is not applicable to American thought today, well...

Overall it's a B film with A list actors. Moments of brilliance through a dense fog of bad editing and questionable direction.",1236988800,13,1206,4.346666666666667

I'll never forget the day I waited in anticipation of seeing it at the theater when it came out in 1980. While standing in line to enter, my frined from work came out. I asked him how it was. ""You have to keep up with it,"" he said.
