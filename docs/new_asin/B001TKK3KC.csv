3792245,5,B001TKK3KC,"As always these three aging scamps are always in trouble. The wonderful character actors who prevail on this comedy from the Yorkshire Dales are a refreshing change from the junk that is on the TV now. Hurry up Warner and BBC this series was on for 30 years, so it must be worth putting on the DVDs quicker than you are doing now. ABC, NBC and CBS take note, if I have the choice of your shows or a BBC comedy, the BBC wins every time.
Just love Foggy, Campo and Cleggy. Wish I lived in their village.",1252713600,10,501,4.122448979591836
3792246,2,B001TKK3KC,Very few if any new episodes Most shows are the same as seen in earlier releases. With thirty plus years of shows it seems as if they would not have to repeat earlier releases,1249516800,,175,4.176470588235294
3792247,5,B001TKK3KC,"I really like this series and enjoy it very much.  The stories are fun, it is weird to see old men acting so silly, I laugh so much while watching the 1977 and 1978 DVDs that my wife gave me this DVD as a present for Father's day.  Hope there will be more DVD of later episodes.

3792248,5,B001TKK3KC,This is an excellent program.  I am now buying them and sharing them with my family.  I highly recommend to others,1245974400,,114,4.380952380952381
3792249,5,B001TKK3KC,Each episode is outstanding. I laughed all the way through and am completely satisfied with this DVD. Classic LOTSW you'll love it!!,1244851200,,132,5.045454545454546
3792250,4,B001TKK3KC,"Not to take away from the prior series/seasons. Series 5 (1979) starts Foggy, Clegg and Compo off in IMHO the two best series of the show. (Series 5 and Series 6) ""Full Steam Behind"" is a great episode where the trio has to deal with a runaway train thanks to Compo's hi-jinks. Other great episodes in this DVD include ""The Flag and Further Snags"", ""Earnshaw Strikes Back"" and ""Here We Go Again Into The Wild Blue Yonder"".

I agree with others that say for a 30 year and series run of this show, they do need to get the DVDs out faster than 1 or 2 a year. This is such a great show, especially the early seasons of it with Foggy (Brian Wilde) as the third man.

My only problem with the LotSW DVD releases are the flip-flopping on whether to provide the Christmas Specials or not.

Also,[...] mentioned it would have bonus interviews and this website (amazon.com). Unfortunately that is not the case. There are no bonus interviews. What's up with that Warner Brothers Home Video?? Get a move on, that man and put in the interviews, Christmas Specials and other bonus features!",1244678400,16,1076,4.507692307692308
3792251,5,B001TKK3KC,Great episodes as usual.  I do wish they packed more into them.  How many episodes are made yearly?,1241913600,4,99,4.444444444444445
3792252,5,B001TKK3KC,"Don't be surprised if you are lukewarm to the program upon first viewing. This is a show that grows on you with each episode. The first time I saw LOTSW I was underwhelmed... but I watched a few more and it began to grow on me. A few more and I was hooked!

Warner and the BBC appear to still be listening (or are we just purchasing them in large enough quantities?) as, though again overpriced for just 7 episodes, we get series five of our favorite retirees.

From the press release:

""The year is 1979 and Compo, Clegg, Foggy continue their gentle hijinks in the picturesque village of Pennine up in the Yorkshire Dales. The adventures this time around includes Foggy taking Compo and Clegg to see a piece of history - the Steam Preservation Society's reopening of an old railway line. However, Compo and Clegg's energy only go so far when Foggy is in the grip of another enthusiastic ambition. Meanwhile, the trio does not have the monopoly on quirkiness when Sid and Wally are seen creeping around the woods with bedding rolls.""

Once again, a BBC series does *not* include the ""Christmas Special"" episodes, 2 this time, that truly should be included.  I don't understand this mentality.  Hopefully these will someday appear on a LOTSW ""Christmas Specials"" release.

To Warner/BBC:
Get on with it!  At the current release rate of 2 series per year we'll see the successor to Blu-ray come to market before all series are out on standard DVD!  For a program with a over 30 year run, 2 per year is entirely too slow a release rate!",1237161600,32,1533,4.586080586080586

3792288,5,B001TKK3KC,"The longest running comedy in history (30 some-odd years!).  Subtle wittiness combined with total silliness.  These guys live the lifestyle we all can appreciate, rambling about the Yorkshire countryside making mischief.  The show highlights the beautiful landscape too.  Ensemble cast has great screen chemistry.  Roy Clark's writing slowly develops solidly humorous recurring (but still very fresh) plots that do get better with age (like wine!).  Even the very later years are a big chuckle.  My husband and I love this show.  Can't beat it for ""clean"" comedy.  I love the fact that it highlights the older age group having so much fun.  Campo is a total riot - a mischievous little elf of a man!  And Foggy and Clegg provide the perfect counterpoints for Campo's childlike energy.
