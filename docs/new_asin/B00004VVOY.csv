1357689,4,B00004VVOY,"As a born again Christian, lover of history, beauty, & courage, Esther was such an inspiration to me.  A few liberties were taken (ie. God is never mentioned in the Book of Esther, while He is in the movie.) But these liberties actually succeeded in bringing out the meaning of the Biblical story.  Some of the acting done by the actors playing the eunuchs was a little stilted, but it also didn't damage the progression of the story.  This movie is an excellent teaching tool to get people interested in the Bible.  It tells a story of a young woman who is an example for women of all ages.  Esther is courageous, honest, graceful, empathetic, & a woman of integrity & dignity.  Through her bravery, faith, & wisdom she brought the enemy of her people down & gained the respect & love of her young, impetuous, & immature husband who was a reluctant king. Because of her qualities Esther didn't have to use ruthlessness & vulgarity, or dishonesty to bring down her & her people's enemies.  Because of her dignity she won the place as partner with her husband in ruling Persia, & certainly her husband needed someone who could help him in his responsibilities & help him to grow up & rule responsibly. So many girls & women in our society could use Esther as their role model.  She was Every Woman & a Lady!  She was truly a ""Liberated woman.""",979603200,91,1342,4.512396694214876

It follows the book very well and the two main actors (Esther and Mordechai) are really good. The other Esther movies that I have seen deviate from the book of Esther, they add too much that isn't in the original story, have bad dialogue and or have terrible budgets.  Usually when a movie follows a book so closely it makes it dragy but whoever put this one together did it masterfully. It moves very quickly.",1419724800,2,543,4.262135922330097

1358250,4,B00004VVOY,"The tenth in a series of TV movies based on stories from the Bible, this drama entitled,Esther stars Louise Lombard in the title role. Esther is a common Jewish woman who rose to wealth and power when she captured the heart of the King of Persia. Eventually, Esther opted to use her influence to win freedom and a better life for her people. Also,it features F. Murray Abraham as Mordecai, Esther's cousin and foster father together with Jrgen Prochnow,Thomas Kretschmann,Ornella Muti and Natasha Williams; and it is directed by Raffaele Mertes.

This is a fairly elaborate production with a solid supporting cast, it proceeds at a relaxed pace and never quite takes off dramatically. But it does provide a solid telling of Esther's story, and if considered as something of a docudrama, it's successful. Also,it does provide much of the period flavor of ancient life, and the major facets of the story and portrayals of the characters coincide with biblical accounts. Overall,it is a good TV movie that accurately portrays Esther and it gives the viewer a good understanding of this book of the Bible.",1418601600,,1101,4.951351351351351
1358251,5,B00004VVOY,I enjoyed this version of Esther the most of any I have seen.  It is biblically accurate and the actors are very suitable for their roles.

Movies like this one help me understand the different books of the Bible and when I read each book in the Old Testament or the New Testament and see the movies that pertain to those books, I have a clearer understanding of what I am reading.  I am very careful to buy the movies that give the true meaning of what the Bible says and not some superficial storyline that goes is not accurate with the Bible.

1358427,5,B00004VVOY,This was a fantastic movie-I received it on time and in perfect condition.  I recommended highly because it's one of the few Christian movies that remains  faithful to the Bible-something that cannot be said of most supposing Christian movies made in this day and age.  Just a few minor differences which I imagine is mostly due to adding to the dramatic storyline-nothing that changes the meaning of the story of Esther.,1394755200,,421,4.901408450704225

But this one surprised me.  Grab your Bible and watch it like I did.  You will not be disappointed!  The fillers do not take away from the truth and get to see more of the truth the relationship between Esther, the king, and Haaman than is ever shown anywhere.

1358429,4,B00004VVOY,"Unlike many adaptations of biblical stories, where either the entire film version or parts of it are not as described in the Bible, this film version is very accurate, except for one incident. True, the film has, as it should have, many elaborations that are not specific in the Bible, but what it added are reasonable ideas of how the events occurred. The events themselves are unchanged.

The sole exception is the introduction into the story of the biblical figure Ezra the Scribe. According to this film, he was a friend of Mordecai and decided the leave Persia and travel to Israel because of how he saw the Persians treated his people. This is neither in the books of Esther or Ezra. Arguably, this too is a fair elaboration. Scholars are unable to date the time when Ezra left Persia to travel to Israel, and it is possible that he did so at this time.",1393718400,2,859,4.541935483870968

1358466,3,B00004VVOY,"The Book of Esther is one of my favorite Bible stories.  It would be very hard to completely destroy it.  This version is decent.  It doesn't do as well at describing the problematic nature of harem life as some Esther movies.  This movie also doesn't adequately play up the significance of Esther's decision to dress simply, and to take no particular jewels with her when she leaves the first harem and goes to the king.  In fact, the movie has her dressed more fancily than the Bible says she dressed. Other versions have her dressed, all except to appear in the king's court, in rather plain clothing.  This sets off her beauty in a different way than rich clothing and jewelry would, and far better illustrates the strength of Esther's character.  I have seen several Esther movies recently, and as I recall, this one alone doesn't skirt the fact that the king would have slept with Esther, as he did with each concubine in turn, and Esther was not yet married to him.  Missing from most Esther movies, and from this one as well, is the element that gives the story the most power; Mordecai had specifically adopted Esther because she was beautiful, and he probably slept with her as well.  It is the manner in which Esther's strong faith protects her from being changed into a cheap whore by the continuous thread of evil in her life, that gives the Biblical story its greatest power.",1385510400,4,1389,4.6138211382113825

My daughter is no exception, and I believe we have every version of ""Esther"" ever put to film, from ""One Night with the King"", to Veggie Tales ""Esther"". I think this one is the best of the versions we have seen. The acting is believable, the wardrobe is acceptable and the story is true to point. I found it wonderful that the story included prominent contemporaries of Esther and Mordechai, Ezra and Nehemiah, that are not mentioned in the book of Esther but would have been present in Babylon at that time...and likely would have reacted to circumstances just as they did in the film. It is not often, in my opinion, that embellishment makes a Bible movie more biblical, but in this case it worked!

1358473,5,B00004VVOY,"Taken from the Bible of the story of Esther it is surprisingly accurate for the most part with artistic license thrown in which adds dimension to the story, that is, real people and real events. It's about a young Jewish girl, how she winds up in a Persian harem and becomes queen unbeknownst to the King that she is Jewish and ultimately is instrumental in delivering the Jews. I love bible stories brought to life and this is one of my favorites how God intervenes in the affairs of men for His purposes. Wholesome entertainment.",1375574400,,531,4.6

1358496,4,B00004VVOY,"This production seems superior to ""One Night with the King."" It depicts how Esther was chosen queen and used her station to rescue her people. It seems to avoid misleading poetic license excesses.

As per background material in the New American Bible, ""The Book of Esther is named after its Jewish heroine. It tells the story of the plot of Haman the Agagite, jealous and powerful vizier of King Xerxes (Ahasuerus) of Persia (485-464 B.C.), to destroy in a single day all the Jews living in the Persian Empire. He is moved to this out of hatred for the Jewish servant Mordecai, who for religious motives refuses to render him homage. The day of the proposed massacre is determined by lot. Meanwhile Esther, niece and adopted daughter of Mordecai, is chosen queen by King Xerxes in place of Vashti. She averts the pogrom planned against her people and has the royal decree of extermination reversed against Haman and the enemies of the Jews. Mordecai replaces Haman, and together with Esther, works for the welfare of their people. The event is celebrated with feasting and great joy, and the memory of it is to be perpetuated by the annual observance of the feast of Purim (lots), when the lot of destruction for the Jews was reversed for one of deliverance and triumph by Queen Esther and her uncle Mordecai.""",1373155200,,1310,4.745614035087719

I found it more accurate than other videos...I especially like that they allude to the presence of Ezra and Nehemiah in a speculative way. Including these two biblical giants helps unite the three consecutive OT Books. ""The Night With the King"" had too much Hollywood interpretation in it to make it a very good teaching tool.

1358501,3,B00004VVOY,"I've seen several film variations and/or adaptations of Esther's story (one of my favorites in the Bible), and although this particular one has already been reviewed quite extensively, I felt it important to point out one VERY important fact:

In the original Biblical account, Esther DID NOT sleep with Xerxes BEFORE they were married!!!!  Esther was a virgin when she entered into the palace, and she REMAINED one UNTIL she & Xerxes were officially wed. This is critical, because the Bible makes it VERY clear that Esther - at that time - was representative of God Himself. Every single book in the Bible has some sort of Christ representation, if you really study it.  Esther was the vessel and/or tool that God used at THAT time, to set His chosen people free from Babylonian captivity.  Although back at that time kings, princes, and rulers of the earth DID ""have their way"" most times because of the power & authority given to them, Esther KEPT HERSELF before God, to whom her FIRST allegiance was due.  GOD chose Esther to fulfill this mission, before Xerxes chose her!

Ironically in comparison, ""One Night With the King"" - although it does take lots of poetic liberties in story detail - DOES at least correctly portray the fact that Esther was indeed pure & abstinent until the day she married the king.  I ALSO recommend that version when it comes to the critical pre-history of Esther's story, which explains why God chose & placed her in the position she was in the first place. I am always in awe of the fact that, had the Prophet Samuel's divine instructions been obeyed, the awful bondage, oppression, and loss of life that resulted could have been avoided.  It PAYS to do what God TELLS you to do!!!!",1371081600,2,1717,4.7

But God's ways are clearly depicted in righteousness, wisdom, and judgment.  Louise Lombard (Esther) beautifully portrays Queen Esther in her humble and wise decisions on behalf of her people.  Another good revealing is the little known beginnings of the word ""hypocrite"" --- in early ""theater plays"", actors held a molded ""face"" (a mask on a stick of the one that they were acting out) in front of their own face.  These actors were called ""hypocrites"" -- or two-faced actors.

It's probably one of the more biblical versions, but the quality of the production and some of the license taken with the story is annoying. The false noses on some of the Jewish characters is laughable, and most of the acting is terrible. The most annoying part is the way the film makes King Ahasuerus out as some weak, whiney young man who over-reacts to everything like a toddler, and can't think for himself.

I work in youth ministry, and I was hoping to show clips of this as we study Esther. I don't think I can show scenes of this to a room full of teenagers, though, and expect them to take it seriously.",1326844800,4,716,4.296296296296297

There is no reason to assume that this great JEWISH HEROINE gave up her dignity and pride. All scripture tells us is that she was brought to the chamber and then chosen as the QUEEN. It is reckless and sexist to assume that she was not as virtuos and dignified as the prophets DANIEL, ELIAS, JEREMIAH, SAMUEL, EZECHIEL,ISAIAH  ETC.....

When I say deviation I mean, characters who are not mentioned in the Book of Esther are in the movie (as someone mentioned Ezra).  Also I noticed that it was not as well funded in terms of props and other elements to make the story believable. Don't get me wrong, it's a fantastic movie on all parts but in terms of accuracy to the Bible it would be around 89% and the props and costumes to make it believable.. I would say 85%.

Its a good movie, not as well done as ""The Bible Collection"" series but not as bad as the movie ""The Story of Ruth"" or ""The Ten Commandments"". Sorry I know some of you like those movies but in all frankness do you watch these movies to be entertained as the world is entertained? Or as the word of God has put forth the truth of these real events that took place years ago? I personally want to watch these movies to get a real feel for how it must have been in those days. Also I teach Sunday school so I use some of these movies to help the kids and teenagers learn from these visual aids if they don't deviate too much from the Bible.  In my estimation, this one just made the cut. It has some artistic elements to it which fills in some blanks from the Book of Esther but nothing that would ruin the whole experience since I do explain to them what is actually in the Bible and what was made up as we watch these movies.

One thing I did not like about this movie at all is the scenes when the King and Queen Esther get intimate with each other. It did not need to be shown to the extent it was and it just ruins my ability to show this movie without having to skip over some parts and have the students nag me about why I skipped some parts.

1358680,3,B00004VVOY,"Esther is the classic tale of the Jewish girl who wins the heart of a debauched king and in doing so manages to save her people the Jews from certain death at the hands of an evil courtier.  This film was dazzlingly filmed in Morocco, and I particularly thought the set design, costuming and cinematography was well done.

I felt the storyline was a trifle weak. For instance, it seems instantaneously that Esther wins the heart of the king; however, the film fails to show why. There isn't an ounce of passion or chemistry between the king and Esther, and aside from being a good person Esther isn't that pretty nor is there much of an explanation to her instant rise to fame. The King's portrayal doesn't make this any easier, as he does very little except issue negligent commands which while biblically true, doesn't exactly endear the viewer, and while doubtless Esther spent most of her life in a harem, very little of the dynamics of harem living are portrayed.

I felt this was ok. I would've liked the king to be a more charismatic character to possibly explain why Esther loved him. I would've liked there to be more chemistry between Esther and the king. As it was, the Eunuch's were more interesting which is probably not what the filmmaker was going for.

Still, this was an entertaining film, worth a watch for the costumes and scenary. But I wasn't that impressed with the acting or the love story.",1270339200,4,1413,4.617529880478088

King Ahasuerus/Xerxes was not as believable for me, but who knows what he was really like?  The quality of the film itself was good, with great backgrounds and costuming.  It didn't come across as a low budget presentation.  I'll be showing it to a group of women this week.  We just finished studying the story of Esther and this will be a good follow-up to put ""flesh and bones"" to the story of God's gracious provision to save His people, the Jews, through one of their own who was in a strategic place(queen) at a strategic time (when the annihilation of the Persian Jews was imminent).

I incourage you to read the story of Esther to be able to get the whole concept of this movie because a miracle does take place with the Jews.

1358711,5,B00004VVOY,"Esther is one of my favourite Bible stories and this film doesn't disappoint when it comes down to telling it. A part of the Bible Collection it tells the story of a Jewish woman named Haddassah an orphan being raised by her uncle Mordecai. He works in the palace of the Persian king Xerxes who has banished his queen Vashti for refusing to obey his command. The story is well known and I won't continue it here, but the history behind the story, and surrounding it was just very interesting for a person who love history like I do.

Like almost all the movies in the Collection the time and attention paid to detail, costumes and acting is superb. I wish all TV movies were done this well. This movie is shorter than normal, about 1.5 hours, but you don't really notice it in comparision to the others. I like that it felt longer, but wasn't.

1358714,3,B00004VVOY,"It helps us remember the Biblical story and the intervention of the God of Israel in His People's lives.  It also helps to be reminded that satan/the evil one works to try and stop God from keeping His Covenants with His People (including those of Judah during the account of Esther), as well reminds us of the lineage of Mashiakh Ben Yosef's mother [Miriam] which may have been in those who experienced this story of ""Purim.""  Satan has always tried to ""thwart"" HaShem's Plans.

Very Biblically accurate (at least very close) movie on Purim, from ""The Bible"" series films.  If you saw THIS version, you wouldn't be disappointed in the story-line.  But getting the ""One Night With The King"" version is quite disappointing due to it's liberality with the Biblical account.

This ""The Bible- Esther"" film is very enjoyably accurate and rewarding!  The authentic feeling of the movie props/sets, the political issues happening at the time, the differing types of Jews at that point in history, and the power of the Gentile nations are all given time in this movie.  If it wasn't for our exception below, we'd say ""get it!""  The actors do well, and you FEEL the issues at hand. A spirituality is brought forth, just as the Spirituality you pull from the Biblical account Itself.

My family loved to watching this movie.  We made it a point to watch it during Purim...though it would have been enjoyed throughout the year too.

We would like to recommend adding this one too, to anybody's Biblical movie shelf.  BUT we have one exception which we'll address last herein.

It's done fairly well, Biblically accurate for the most part, and conveys the same message as the Scriptures tend to in the Biblical areas it traverses.  Our family enjoyed this one, on many levels.  We'd say ""buy this one!"" as it's pretty good....but again....

The one exception to us recommending this film, is going to only strike a positive/helpful note with few people (we realize), but nevertheless....the problem we have with this film is that real live human beings with real life families (husbands, and/or wives, and/or children) are being intimate with other people outside of their family all for the sake of ""it's just a job, it's acting.""  We personally don't believe that God will every approve body-close-holding and smooching, as ""just a job so it's okay"" when it comes to non-married people.  You simply won't find that kind of behavior ever supported or condoned in the Bible.  As i said, we realize this won't be a popular stance, in a Media-soaked culture, but nonetheless...it's the flat truth.  So we cannot recommend you actually buy this film.  There ARE films on the market, few though, that have actual actors who are husbands and wives being intimate on screen...or that have husbands and wives pictured who aren't married outside the movie but BARELELY touch in any intimate way (like FireProof, Facing the Giants, Time Changer, Flywheel, and others).  We recommend you just place your own family member in the actor's spot, and see how you'd feel watching your partner or child doing the intimacy with a complete stranger (IN FRONT OF THEIR CHILDREN OR SPOUSE).

The dialog between Mordecai and Ezra is very entertaining. Somehow it always turns out that the one rebuking the other accidentally does exactly the opposite, just a few moments later.

Unfortunately nothing is perfect. There's quite some visible female flesh in some scenes, and the king could have done with a little more ""royalty"" in his character. But still I like the way this movie was done. Good acting and a good soundtrack.",1172448000,2,563,4.744897959183674

1358730,5,B00004VVOY,"""Esther"" is a powerful movie based on the Old Testament book of Esther. This is an interesting movie that is faithful to the biblical story with some few additions that do little to dilute the basic message and veracity of the story. The movie powerfully illustrates the deep faith that Esther, Mordecai and Ezra had in God and they maintained this faith even in the face of immense suffering and troubles.

The movie is well made with great acting by British actress Louise Lombard playing Esther; F. Murray Abraham playing Mordecai, Esther's cousin and foster father; Ahasuerus playing King Xerxes, King of Persia whose empire extended from Egypt to India. The sets and costumes look authentic and there was great colour harmony. Esther comes out as a clever and brave woman who ultimately saved the Jewish people from possible extermination. This should be an inspiration to all women to see how one woman could make such a positive difference to her people. To this day, the Jewish Festival of Purim is based on the story of Esther.

The story ends with Ezra, the scribe and priest and a friend of Mordecai leading the remnants of Jewish captives back to Jerusalem.

This is an excellent movie that is highly recommended especially for learning and understanding the book of Esther.",1145404800,13,1286,4.889908256880734
1358731,5,B00004VVOY,"As I've said in some of my earlier reviews I've been fasting TV & Movies but this one is worth my time. I'm giving it *****Five Stars because it deserves it.  The actors and actresses bring out the best of each actor.  The scrip is in good order for those who want to line up the DVD to what has been written in The Old Testament.

My degree in Art challenges me to look at the richness and harmony of many aspects of this movie from the production, introduction, Narration and overall presentation of the movie.  Well put together and even more important inspiring.

The sets, the wardrobes, jewelry, animals and even the look of the characters is lovely and well put together.

Great color harmony and a rich sense of color balance as we observe the use of color in the forms of taupes, grays and muted baiges, pinks and browns.  But as the movie moves the use of color inspires and engages us to flow with the movie.  The concept rolls out well in terms of moving us through the story of Esther to help us see what is taking place.  This is an educational movie and one filled with deep emotional value.

Leading us from Esther the cousin of Mordeci who was left in his custody to Esther the Virgin who must learn how to prepare her self to go before the King was well put together.  We get a picture of what challenges Esther must have faced in order to get ready to become Queen.

Another thing I like is the depth of a story that has been told over and over again as it relates to the Jewish people.  We see that even in this historic depiciton of the Jews they are being persecuted and mistreated again for some of the same negative connations that people still have in our day and age thousands of years later.

But the power of the story of Esther is rooted in how Esther, Mordeci and Ezra have a deep faith in the God of Abraham, Issac and Jacob.  They keep their faith even in their heartfelt pain and struggles of not knowing how they will survive a decree that can not be reversed.

If you want to get a movie that is rich in historic and epic proportion get this movie ""ESTHER"" it's a wonderful movie.

1358732,4,B00004VVOY,"Of all the Bible sories, I find the The Book of Esther does not flow as easily as others, but nevertheless, this film based on the story is interesting; it is faithful to scripture, with a few additions to fill out the plot.
Queen Esther is beautifully cast with English actress Louise Lombard (seen in 2004's ""Hidalgo""), and Oscar-winner F. Murray Abraham excellent as her cousin and guardian Mordecai.
King Ahasuerus (historically known as Xerxes) is a character I find hard to like; he appears to be an indecisive and capricious man, who puts all his trust in the evil Haman (well played by German actor Jurgen Prochnow). It is Esther who courageously stands up to Haman when he tries to annihilate all the Jews of the land.
The main addition to the story is the inclusion of Ezra as a friend of Mordechai. Ezra was the scribe and priest who led a remnant of the Jewish captives back to Jerusalem, but this would come twenty years later, under the reign of King Artaxerxes, in 457 B.C. Having Ezra in the story also emphasizes the importance of God, whereas in the Book of Esther, no mention of God is made.
Directed by Raffaele Mertes (who was the cinematographer for most of the other films in this television series), it has a good score by Carlo Siliotto, lovely cinematography by Giovanni Galasso in the exotic area of Quarzazate, Morocco, with the use of a wonderful color palette in the costumes, using rich earth tones and shades of teal and olive greens.
The story of Esther is the basis for the Jewish Festival of Purim, which is a grand time for children; it's a time to dress up in costumes and masks, eat sweets, and best of all, twirl one's gragger (noisemaker) whenever Haman's name is mentioned in the reading of the story.",1079222400,122,1742,4.604501607717042

I'd suggest preteens not watch it, because what is not shown has the effect of making the movie more intense, like Hitchcock's movies. And - Depending how protective you are, you might not want to explain:
1 - What the harem was learning to do to please the king (!)
2 - why the eunichs were acting silly (effeminately) and said they were not men
3 - What went on when Esther went to the king the first night, and the camera cuts away to a dew-covered red rose falling to the floor. (a great visual symbol of virginity lost)
There are some intense emotional scenes that could scare young children, from Esther being taken from her home by force, to Mordecai lamenting that the Jews will all be killed. The settings and clothes were all well chosen and appropriate. Nothing low budget about it, in my opinion. It is empowering for women to see how one woman can make a difference, even in a bad situation, and how faith makes a difference: God hears.",1078444800,26,1254,4.4803493449781655
1358734,5,B00004VVOY,"All the Turner bible movies are terrific. Like I always say, it's some of the only television/video ""you can watch with your mom in the room."" The dialogue and pace are tremendous in Esther, and the romantic scenes (there are many in the bible) are done tastefully, sensually, and they don't insult the intelligence or taste of the viewer. Like all the Turner bible series, this one is a treat to watch; entertaining, provocative, yet absolutely clean and respectful to all faiths. I recommend them all.",1075420800,6,503,4.8604651162790695
1358735,4,B00004VVOY,"This film is part of the Trimark Home Video Bible series.  It is refreshing to know that new movies about the Bible are still being made.
This movie is from the book of Esther.  If you are watching the whole video series, you should watch ""Jeremiah"" before this one.  It will explain the first part of the movie.  The actor playing the king in ""Jeremiah"" is also the king played in this movie.  This was not intentional.
To keep the movie to an hour and a half, there have been some things added.  I do feel that these neither change anything in the Bible nor do they distract the viewer.  I find this to be a good tool in learning the book of Esther.
The end of the movie speaks of Ezra and what he did for the people.  It sounds like a lead-in to another movie, but alas, there is no movie on the book of Ezra.
I would recommend this movie.",1020211200,31,842,4.122699386503068
