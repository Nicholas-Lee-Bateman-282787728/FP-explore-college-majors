4905360,1,B005YCEIIE,I love the wine country and I was hoping this movie would be like Sideways ....but it was nothing close. The actors and actresses act so fake. I couldn't even finish the movie. I turned it off after 40 minutes.,1328572800,2,210,4.275
4905361,1,B005YCEIIE,"I had high hopes for this movie, but frankly it fell flat. The plot was tired, the romantic chemistry was lacking and quite frankly I thought that Christopher Lloyd would have made a better evil cartoon character than winemaker his acting was so over the top. The actual film making was decent, and Sokoloff and Righetti had good banter as friends- that 's about all that's positive here.

Move on to greener pastures folks...nothing to see here.",1326240000,11,446,4.792207792207792
4905362,3,B005YCEIIE,"Love and wine mix with pretty Napa countryside in a somewhat lackluster but well meaning tale.

Marla Sokoloff, who makes a living off these kind of movies (""Gift of the Magi"", ""Christmas in Boston""; she's also scheduled to star in a modern remake of Sense and Sensibility, called ""Scents and Sensibility""- can't get enough of Austen in my book) plays a struggling to find herself single girl who inherits a vineyard from her estranged father.

With her guy-hating, guy-hunting girlfriend, Amanda Righetti(""The Mentalist"")they go about trying to save the place while competing with a devious neighbor, Christopher Lloyd(looks good in white) and being wooed by his handsome son, Barry Watson.

There's romance and conflict in the air along with the inevitable come to terms with what's really important: true love or greed.  And, of course, will he come through for her, and will she forgive him; will she find herself and forgive her father?  And herself?

Yes, and that's fine.  The country setting, filming, hip music, and actors are all nice.  The story's a bit flat and not as amusing as they want it to be.  It's PG-13, and there's a fair amount of sexual references or innuendo.  It dulls the romance.  For example, in one scene, the heroine inadvertantly meets the hero in a small grocery store, and seeing condoms in his shopping basket offers to pay for them since he paid for her gas when her credit card wouldn't work.  I guess that could be funny.  He's a virile male; she gives him her phone number, and they have a good laugh.  Ugh.  I think they needed a woman on the screenplay.

Overall, it offers sentiment consistent with a potentially good but flawed, romantic comedy: love conquers all, some quirky but mostly fun characters, beautiful scenery.  It's diverting for an hour and half on a rainy day, but I wouldn't watch again.  I'll drag out one of my Austen's instead!",1325635200,21,1889,4.813664596273292
4905363,2,B005YCEIIE,"Do not spend money to watch this movie. It lacks a compelling script, employs minimally competent actors, and has a painful soundtrack. Watch Sideways instead. (And I like rom-coms. Seriously.)",1325635200,,193,5.466666666666667

4905371,2,B005YCEIIE,This movie was such a disappointment and waste of time. All males were pretty much put down throughout the entire movie by two girls who felt super entitled even though they were pretty much losers themselves. The language and jokes that were very sexual didn't fit the theme of the movie. And I skipped a lot of it because it was not good.,1477958400,,340,4.412698412698413

4905378,1,B005YCEIIE,Very disappointed.  This was not a typical Hallmark movie with the language and crudity throughout the show.  I can't believe I paid for that!  I would prefer not to rate it even with one star as it should be much less!!!,1468800000,,221,4.341463414634147
4905379,1,B005YCEIIE,No. Looked like a cute young love movie set in wine country... But filled with amateurish dialogue almost like a kids' afternoon sitcom. Very disappointing. Poor Chris Lloyd had to be embarrassed to be part of this film.,1468022400,,220,4.815789473684211

The best friend of the main Character meets this guy at the winery and is sleeping with him within 24 hours of meeting him, They never even went out on a date. They need good writers who have lived in the real world to write these stories. If you want to waste an 90 minutes of your life rent this movie.

Predictable yes, but aren't all romantic movies? Isn't that why we watch them, they make us feel good inside and we know they are going to end well.

Wendy's father owned a winery in Napa Valley.  Wendy was asked to come to the winery because she inherit the winery. Wendy and her best friend, Jennifer (Amanda Righetti) come to the winery to take a look at it.

Wendy meets a guy named Chris (Barry Watson) who's father named Nathan (Christopher Lloyd)  owns the winery next door. Nathan tries to run Wendy's father vineyard from under her.  Nathan gets Chris to spy on Wendy. Watch this movie to see if Nathan buys the Vineyard or not. Also see if Chris and Wendy ever gets together or not.  I loved this movie from beginning to end.

But when you're 20 minutes into it, and the film has reduced itself to silent treatments ad insults between best friends and shirtless Brazilian men, it's time to turn it off and watch ""Bottle Shock.""",1371427200,,507,4.404255319148936
4905458,4,B005YCEIIE,I love the wine experience and any movies affiliated with it. It is fun to see Christopher Lloyd as a bad guy too!,1371168000,,114,4.0
4905459,4,B005YCEIIE,This was a good movie would recommend to my family and friends as well to see.  It kept you awake.  Thanks!,1370217600,,107,4.0476190476190474

4905461,2,B005YCEIIE,"The story and acting was sub par. Not realistic. Not worth the money. There are plenty of other ""wine"" movies out there. All better than this one.",1368489600,,146,4.444444444444445
4905462,3,B005YCEIIE,"The idea of the story was a good one. But I was disappointed by the language in the movie. There was really no need for it.

The actors did a good job but the language took away the ability for it to be a really good movie.",1366156800,,223,3.74468085106383
4905463,4,B005YCEIIE,"Good movie...., nothing extraordinary.., just the kind of movie you would want to sit back and relax to, drink some beverage.  Good story line.  Recommended if you had one of those stressful days and you just want to unwind and clear your mind for a few moments.  Nice scenery too.",1364860800,8,281,4.58
4905464,5,B005YCEIIE,Overall this movie is great! I think they did a great job with the cast. This is the type of movie that you would watch with friends and wine. I love to watch movies from Marla Sokoloff she is a great actress. Amazon needs to have more movies by her.,1364256000,7,250,4.02

4905467,2,B005YCEIIE,"Had the potential to be cute, but just fell flat.  The characters weren't very likable (which they need to be in a cutesy rom-com) or interesting.  If you know anything about wine, this movie will frustrate you.  They passed a Chardonnay off as a red wine.  Come on, if you're going to make a movie set at a winery, at least get the basics right.  Out-takes at the end were funny, though.  Not a terrible movie, just not well thought-out or well written.",1360972800,,454,4.409638554216867

4905470,3,B005YCEIIE,"It had a cute story line. But I loved the vineyards, they were beautiful.  Just a fun, lighthearted movie. Puts you in a good mood.  It is nice to see a woman be courageous enough to take on such a big task.",1357862400,,207,3.9047619047619047

Both Mr. Watson and Ms. Sokolff do a wonderful job of bringing their characters to life, although you will believe Ms. Sokolff's innocence more than you will Mr. Watson's business savy.",1355702400,,314,4.833333333333333

4905476,3,B005YCEIIE,It was a typical romantic comedy/drama. The estate and landscaping was beautiful! The acting was ok. It was worth renting.,1351296000,,122,5.15
4905477,1,B005YCEIIE,I didn't like it. It was boring and it just seemed the girl in the movie is immature. She finds her father left her a wine vineyard to look after. She doesn't know the first thing about it. She meets a guy through deception kept the fact that he was her own competition. Everything just goes too fast for what is expected in the real world. They fall in love too fast. I didn't even finish the movie.,1350777600,6,400,4.141025641025641
4905478,5,B005YCEIIE,The Chateau Meroux is an entertaining movie reminiscent of the light-hearted Hallmark Channel movies Marla Sokoloff stars in but with more adult dialogue. It has a lot of terrific banter spiced up with salty innuendos. If you like Sokoloff's Hallmark movies you'll love The Chateau Meroux.,1349136000,,289,5.304347826086956
4905479,5,B005YCEIIE,This is such a nice movie.  I really enjoyed it.  I was looking for something to watch and just couldn't find anything I even wanted to look at when I came across this movie.

4905481,5,B005YCEIIE,If you are looking for a non pretentious romantic comedy this is one of those. Interesting scenery and good fun.,1345852800,,112,4.65
4905482,5,B005YCEIIE,"I loved this movie. It is silly and sweet. It makes you feel empowered to overcome problems in life. It has a Hallmark movie look and feel, which I like. The main character is feisty and off-beat; she says the funniest things (good banter throughout).
If you liked The Gift of the Magi or Mrs. Miracle you would probably like this.
This movie is about a girl that inherits a beautiful winery. She knows nothing about running one so she enlists help (best friend and a new guy). There is this jerk neighbor who owns a winery and is determined to put her out of business. Now she gets to show what she is made of...
