It's all CGI graphics and it looks so amazing. Cloe, Sasha, Yasmin, Jade perform music videos and everything! This is going to be the best Bratz DVD yet, I can't wait! Bratz rule!",1153699200,2,312,4.131147540983607

8128835,3,B000G2YC92,"I LOVE the Bratz, and have all their movies and love them, but this one was a disapointment. The animation was poor compared to the other Bratz movies, when they moved, they seemed week and lifeless; the voices could have been better too. Also, it was more of a movies then a game.",1265846400,,281,4.320754716981132
8128836,3,B000G2YC92,It was ok but my grandaughter had a little hard time with it being she is only 5.,1179100800,,81,3.5555555555555554
8128837,5,B000G2YC92,"I LOVE this DVD!  It is so much fun to watch and there are so many activities to do. First, there are 4 music videos of the Bratz dancing and singing to songs that you'll want to listen and watch again and again! They totally rock!  I really love the idea of being able to choose the direction of each Bratz story. It's sort of like being the director!  Photoshoot is another cool feature of ""Livin' It Up! With The Bratz!"" You'll feel like you're right there with the photographer! Last, but certainly not the least, the Bratz 3D art is incredible! The Bratz really come to life! If you love Bratz, ""Livin' It Up! With The Bratz!"" will make a great addition to your Bratz DVD collection!",1179014400,,688,4.359375
8128838,4,B000G2YC92,"The plot can change in this movie.  You sort of choose your options and can live the story a couple different ways.  I like movies, not half movie, half game.  My kids couldn't figure it out first, they kept wondering why the movie is short.  So, I'd watch it over at a friend's house before buying it, see if you like it.",1175990400,,322,4.145161290322581
8128839,2,B000G2YC92,"This is not a movie as much as it is an inter-active Dvd. It was fun for my 8 year old, but a little more difficult for the younger ones. If your girls a Bratz fans they will love it.",1173916800,,183,3.6
8128840,5,B000G2YC92,"This dvd really lets you get in on the fun and decide what the fab four will do next.  I loved the fashion show part!!!  The animation looks great, better than the other Bratz stuff does.  Get it!",1154908800,3,196,4.105263157894737
8128841,5,B000G2YC92,"I bought the first two BRATZ DVD (from FOX Home Video) for my pre-teen niece, and she liked them alot, but complained that the animation wasn't up to Disney or Pixar quality.  Imagine our surprise to find that this newest BRATZ video, ""Livin It Up With The Bratz"" is right on target with the best quality 3-D animation in the world.  The closing credits indicate that the Jim Henson Creature Factory was involved with the motion-capture aspects, with the balance of the animation coming from the acclaimed ""Extra-Large Technology"" group in Hollywood.  In addition to superior animation, this video features a great plot line, and even stronger songs.  The clincher is the DVD's ""interactive"" mode which enables multiple choices to be made throughout the program, each with different results. The interactive mode is controlled by the DVD remote, so it's really easy to use.  My niece and two of her girlfriends watched this program (and played with the interactive options) for three hours straight, making this a truly cost-effective piece of entertainment!",1154304000,10,1058,5.127906976744186
