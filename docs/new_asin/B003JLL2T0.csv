8398237,4,B003JLL2T0,"Having grown up in a family where we were molested by our father, this is the one movie I have scene that captures the heartache of trying to bring restoration to a family devastated by molestation. Most people think the molester is a complete villain, but the situation is not that simple. I am not trying to excuse what my father did, but to see him as a person who did a terrible thing and encouraged us to be all that we could be. We wanted a way to heal our family. I watched my friends being mistreated by their fathers in other ways, they were often put down and nothing they did was ever right. No one thought of charging these horrible fathers with what very damaging to their children. I am not excusing what my father did, it was very wrong. He was molested growing up so where do we draw the line? If we looked at his life before he had his own family, we would see another victim and we would be understanding.",1492128000,2,923,4.220338983050848
8398238,1,B003JLL2T0,"I don't  Understand this movie. It seems as though lifetime is saying that it is OK for the father to be around the daughter after he abused her. Not on any other movie or show about this topic has the father ever been allowed back into their lives. Then the movie itself, it's not bad, good acting, but I'm just so angry that the shrink and the family service workers allowed him to move back in, and the mother basically blames the daughter. It's disgusting. I'd like to take the father out and just... ugh. And the mother! I don't care if they were ALL abused, there is no way in hell I'd let a man that molested my children, father or not, back into my home!",1483920000,3,662,4.21259842519685

8398240,1,B003JLL2T0,"I am disgusted by the fact that this movie makes it seem like it is the right thing to do to allow the father to even be around his daughter whom he molested.  Would that even be legal?  Not quite sure how this is supposed to be a heartwarming movie.  Anyone who molests their own child much less any child at all, should be locked up and throw away the key.  Not subject the innocent child to having to look into her molesters face every single day.  The writers of this story are idiots imo.",1421625600,5,493,4.147368421052631
8398241,4,B003JLL2T0,"This story was told from rather a different perspective.  Most stories about a father's sexual abuse of his daughter are told from before it was discovered and immediately after.  This film is about a family trying to get back together a year later.  It is well written, well acted and is a good production.  The main problem is that Meredith Baxter and Robert Urich were both far too old for the roles.  And they look too old.  Meredith Baxter looks 60 and probably was at the time.  Urich is both too fat and too old.  Every time either comes on the screen it is distractlng because they look so old.  But, it is a well told story of the family trying to put back together what is past fixing.  It is a well painted picture of a woman essentially blaming her daughter for what happened and the daughter feeling betrayed both by her father and her mother.  It's a very good movie and I recommend it.",1408233600,2,900,4.36144578313253
8398242,5,B003JLL2T0,This was bought as a gift for my mother. She says it was a really cool movie and she loves watching it,1403568000,2,102,3.6818181818181817
8398243,4,B003JLL2T0,"i had not seen this movie before, i really enjoyed it, always love to see movies with meridith baxter and robert urich in them  .  wish they could have stayed together though.",1401148800,3,175,4.4375
8398244,2,B003JLL2T0,"This 2003 made-for-TV film stars Meredith Baxter, Robert Urich and Shawna Waldron.  It is a film about incest and the devestating effects it has upon all parties involved.

Mom Carol (Baxter) and daughter Tess (Waldron) must deal with Dad (Ulrich) as he comes to terms with his molestation of Tess - Unfortuately the film misses the mark and does not portray a realistic scenario of the relationship between all the parties involved.  In spite of the fact that both parents were abused as children it is difficult to relate to them as adults.  Carol's mother (Diane Ladd) does little to help the situation.  Written for Lifetime TV, and in spite of the powerful subject matter and the actors doing the best they could with the weak script, this film is not worth watching.",1340668800,,772,4.774436090225564
8398245,3,B003JLL2T0,"This was well acted and well produced but I just cannot imagine a mother welcoming her husband home after he molested their daughter. I don't understand why they made a movie about this. Abusers don't change, it is not a disease you can recover from.  It is an impulse that they cannot control.",1325548800,5,294,4.547169811320755
8398246,5,B003JLL2T0,Great movie - held your interest - but disgusting that the mother of a molested daughter would welcome her husband back home because the selfish ----- doesn't want to be alone.  She even wanted to blame her daughter and held it against her for allowing this to happen.  Wonderful acting but very disturbing that this kind of thing is going on too often and most of the mother's are to blame in one way or another.,1285372800,9,413,4.421052631578948
