8380933,4,B00008FGAG,"This is a fine collection of music videos. No documentaries, no video clips, just videos, which is what makes this good. You hear the hits, plus see Stevie at her best. All are well directed and one is live. A must for any Stevie Nicks fan.",979948800,11,240,4.239130434782608
8380934,1,B00008FGAG,"I've been a Stevie fan for over 25 years, Stevie Nicks being my all time female vocalist.  This video is made up mostly of lip sync which was really disappointing. I only saw one cut on the whole tape( the entire tape was  only about 25 minutes long)that appeared to be recorded live or in a  studio.  The list of songs made me want to purchase this tape, however I  wouldn't have had I of know of the content.",953769600,8,410,4.139240506329114
8380935,5,B00008FGAG,"What can I say?  A collection of her most artistic videos bound to keep you enraptured in her love, pain, anguish, and happiness.  I can watch this over and over again.  The only video missing from this is  ""Gypsy""--my personal favorite!",953596800,4,237,4.7073170731707314
