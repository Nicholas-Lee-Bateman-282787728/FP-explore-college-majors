I feel it is my duty as American to support all of these heroes and try to learn and understand their individual stories.  These people have given everything so that we may enjoy our freedom. We will never truly know what they endure on a daily basis.

How can we begin to  thank them?

I experience waves of men and women just getting back from being deployed or getting read to leave at my place of employment. The courage these people have is something I don't think anyone who has never been in their position will ever know. The stories in Section 60 are heartbreaking. I have not lost a loved one or close friend in combat and I can't even begin to imagine the pain they must feel for the rest of their lives.

I am a mother, a daughter, a sister, a fiancee.

I am a Christian, a Jew, a Muslim. I am Buddhist and I am Hindu.

I lie here at Section 60 at Arlington National Cemetery.

I have never known my daughter or my son. My parents will never see me grow old.

They pray over me with a Bible, the Koran, wear a shawl and say Kaddish for my soul, and they leave rice for me.

They leave pictures of me, of them, of my parents, of my children.

They place a blanket or a coat over my grave so I will be warm.

They place flowers, balloons, stones on my marker, and Christmas decorations.

They rest and sleep by my grave until the sun sets.

They walk up to strangers in Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery and embrace in the common, terrible comfort of grief.

Their flowers, their pictures, their flags, their decorations, their markers, bring them closer for one brief moment to the person they can touch no more. They cling to their memories.

This is all they can touch in the cold, winter sky as they prune the grass, and polish the marker in the undying devotion for the love they have lost, but will cherish for a lifetime.

3618897,4,B001GQ3ED2,"I loved Jon Alpert's 'Baghdad ER' because it turned the soldiers and the
doctors fighting to save them into real, complete, complex human beings,
and not just symbols of war, bravery, devastation and loss.

But with this film, as with Alpert's 'Alive Day Memories' - which
moved too fast through various Iraq war survivors' stories to get the
full impact, I once again found myself feeling guilty for not being more moved.

This is an unflinching portrait of the grieving of families who lost
loved ones in Iraq and Afghanistan. And while it can't help but be
affecting for a while, the endless parade of unknown weeping faces
starts to become numbing not moving. It also starts to feel almost
on the edge of exploitive of their pain.

Certainly that's not the intent. And given that in our recent wars the
government has been careful to hide the bodies, coffins and death
there's a real social value to being reminded that these were real
young men and women - parents, children, spouses - dying over there.

But by moving so quickly from one grieving family to the next, there's
a missed chance to get to know these people (women mostly) left behind
to try and carry on their shattered lives as more than just symbols of loss.",1304121600,,1228,4.645161290322581
3618898,5,B001GQ3ED2,"Once again, HBO films gives us their best.  Stripping away any political posturing, religious moralizing or taking sides, ""Section 60"" instead simply shows us the true - the truest - cost of war; lives destroyed - not only the soldiers who've died, but every human whose life was affected by him or her.  Whatever we supposedly ""win"" by  their sacrifice doesn't seem altogether important anymore.  This is not to say they died in vain - but rather merely to say they should not have needed to die at all.  I kept thinking of the old folk song I sang as a kid ""Where have all the flowers gone"" with its chorus ""When will they ever learn?  When will they ever learn?""

A profoundly moving experience.",1280966400,,698,4.536
3618899,1,B001GQ3ED2,"I have seen this documentary and was very moved by it. In fact, I bought it to show to my students who will be visiting Section 60 as part of a class trip in a couple of weeks. MY ISSUE IS NOT WITH THE CONTENT OF THE MOVIE, IT IS WITH THE DVD MEDIA! Upon trying this dvd out before showing to my students, I found that it WILL NOT PLAY ON ANYTHING BESIDES A DVD PLAYER. I can not show it using a computer, so it can not be projected using an LCD projector nor a Smartboard.

I really feel this should have been clearly stated.",1264636800,2,526,3.9158878504672896
3618900,5,B001GQ3ED2,"We hear of war casualties every day on the news, and both because of the presentation and because of the context, they strike as statistics. It is terrible when men and women die to protect their country (or someone else's), but these are not stories, they are statistics. And statistics are, by their very nature, somewhat dry and unengaging.

Not this film. If the reporting on the nightly news is war examined at the macroscopic level, this is the casualties of war on the microscopic level. We see people grieve for friends, lovers and family members who lost their lives in war. These are not statistics, and we cannot view this film and think of them in such a light. These are tragedies, one and all. And the fact that these people died serving their country makes them heroes as well. Seeing the fallout of deaths from military service, so raw and so personal, is incredibly moving.

It doesn't matter how you feel about war. It doesn't matter whether you feel that some of these people lost their lives in a ""just"" war. None of the people whose graves are visited in this film started those wars. But they all lost their lives serving what was presumably a greater good and at the direction of those who would have us believe it so.

This film should be required viewing for anyone contemplating the desirability of sending troops for the next altercation. THIS is the cost. This will ALWAYS be the cost. And the next war, somewhere, for some reason, will always--human nature being what it is--be looming. May all those in charge of making horrible decisions about war take the tragedies of this film to heart. War may sometimes be necessary but, war is ALWAYS h*ll.",1253577600,,1676,4.655405405405405

I'm extremely glad I saw this but I feel like a voyeur recommending it. I'm proud of the families shown here but I feel slightly embarrassed
looking over their shoulder during their grief. But it's more then just grief its stories of heroes, and their heroic families. You will be torn
between feelings of grief,  and deep respect. I'm a veteran but I don't think that matters in this case this is film that will feel you with emotion.

3618903,4,B001GQ3ED2,"This shows the struggle that isn't seen.  Mothers, Fathers, Spouses, children, relatives all struggling with the loss of someone close to them.

The film doesn't have any overlay, and little direct dialogue with the camera.  It doesn't make any points for or against the war, just simply shows you what part of the outcome is.  It's incredibly sad.

The one thing that is noted, but I glossed over, is that this is made using Amazon's DVD on demand.  Essentially this means when it's ordered, a DVD is burned (just like the blank ones you can buy), screen printed with the logo, and an insert made.  It's all stated there, but it ultimately produces a lower quality disc/package, and with a price this high, it seems kind of cheap.  That's the only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5.  Based on the film alone it's a 5.",1245110400,,820,4.523809523809524

This is one of the most moving and beautiful documentaries I have ever seen and it stays with you.  There are scenes, quiet moments that are absolutely devastating and so sad.  Words are not necessary, the pictures tell the story.  I think the image of the man who spends the day lying by the grave of the person he lost stays with me and shows the real cost of war on the most personal level.",1243036800,2,472,4.269662921348314
3618905,2,B001GQ3ED2,"This is a tough review to write. I need to say up front that I respect our men and women in the military who fight for freedom across the globe. These brave souls deserve our all, and seeing the final resting places of those who didn't make it is humbling in the extreme.

But if we're going to be honest about reviewing this documentary, then we have to do it objectively (i.e., without emotions, and an eye toward education and informing the general public).

My first big problem is that there's very little information given on SECTION 60; about it's formation, the battle for more space for grave sites, who oversees the care of the grounds, and how the families of the deceased view these aspects. Instead, the camera is relegated to basically being a fly on the wall while families visit the cemetery. We see families cry, touch headstones, leave trinkets for their dearly departed, and listen to them mourn. And that is the entirety of the film. It is also focused almost entirely on those soldiers killed in the current Middle East conflicts, with nothing noted about the surrounding soldiers who've been there since Vietnam, Korea and beyond.

Another big problem is that there were too many lingering shots of headstones. Headstones being cleaned. Headstones with the sun setting behind them. Headstones with jelly beans on them. This might not have been too bad if the documentarians had included informational dialogue during a few of them. But the shots are eerily silent, making it seem more macabre than packing any sort of emotional punch. Too, I found these overly-long shots (sorry to say) exceptionally boring.

Let's not forget that these brave men and women died so that we might live, too. Life is for the living, not the dead. And it is the living and how they deal with what's left to them that I would've found more fascinating than this current documentary.",1240531200,4,1884,4.787692307692308
3618906,4,B001GQ3ED2,"This is one of those movies that is hard to review. There are definitely some people that won't care for it at all. It seems almost like you are looking in on very personal moments real people are having....and you indeed are. This is true documentary style, with no narration, no musical score, it is filmed as if you are just walking through the cemetery and meeting the people there. Can I truly understand their pain and grief? Definitely not. And this film doesn't really make any commentary on war or why these people died...to me it's just an incredibly stark reminder of how many have died and how many families and loved ones will mourn every day for the rest of their lives. I don't think you can watch this movie and not feel a more heart-felt stab at a news report of another soldier lost in battle. Every one of them has a story behind them and it's clear in this movie that this is what the families want...for their loved one to be remembered.

So as a movie, I definitely recommend this. But it's a little harder to recommend purchasing the DVD at such a high price. There are no extras on this, and for a less-than-two hour movie, the price at the time I'm reviewing this of $24.95 seems rather high, so I have to dock a star for that. If you can get it at a better price, or just rent it, it's worth the time for sure.",1238803200,,1336,4.280632411067193
3618907,4,B001GQ3ED2,"""Section 60"" is built on a simple premise -- bring a camera and sound equipment to the portion of Arlington National Centery set aside for Iraq and Afghanistan war dead, and film the folks who come to honor their dead. The camera captures the raw grief experienced by the wives, children and parents of the dead, as they work to grapple with the enormity of their loss. Tearful young wives reminisce with their girlfriends. Young moms bring their tots to help them ""remember Daddy."" The most moving visitors are silent - a man curled up and sleeping atop the grave of his son. Families struggle to make their loved ones part of the family, decorating the silent stones with balloons, pictures and even Christmas trees complete with gaily-wrapped gifts. Christians graves abut those of Moslems and Jews, all sharing the eternal sleep of death and the fresh, throbbing anguish of loved ones.

""Section 60"" rarely strays into politics and, for good or ill, the larger value of the soldiers' sacrifice does not come up. Most of the mourners have not yet salved their emotional wounds with justifications. They in are in that horrifying stage of grief in which the loss is too recent, and the wound still unbearable. Longtime mourners greet each other and intereact with visitors, like a class of high schoolers who have each adopted a vet. The camera also shows us cemetery workers, on their unending job of hosing down the monuments and inevitably burying newly-arrived dead. The shot of dirt from a fresh grave being scooped atop its newly-occupied neighbor speaks eloquently to the never-ending string of deaths that stretches endlessly into the future.

An elequent elegy to the price paid by the dead and a close up  look into the face of sacrifice for those left behind.",1238112000,,1772,4.860927152317881
3618908,5,B001GQ3ED2,"HBO is best know for their award winning series': The Soprano's, Six Feet Under, Sex and the City, Deadwood, and others. However, their support of documentary films should not be underestimated. One of the best films HBO produced in 2008 is Section 60: Arlington National Cemetery.

Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery has the United States' most recent war dead, those who gave the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan. With dignity and respect, with no narration or musical score, the filmmakers have the living tell their stories of the dead and the result is a very emotional, moving documentary. Rain or shine, there seems to always be someone in Section 60 paying their respects. When several are in Section 60 at the same time, they usually reach out to each other, becoming an ad hoc support group. That is quite a difference from your local cemetery or even other sections within Arlington. Others arrive to mark special events with the deceased; birthdays, wedding anniversaries, Christmas. This makes Section 60 a very special area within Arlington National Cemetery

Section 60: Arlington National Cemetery is a nonpolitical, low-key, emotional film that deserves your attention. Simply, it shows the cost of war and the people who have to pay the price.

The only draw back is that it wasn't more professionally produced and edited. It strikes you as ""amateurish"" from the start, but full of touching scenes nonetheless.

At times the pace of the film got to me and it just felt like someone left a camera on in the middle of the cemetary and forgot to turn it off.  In between those times however, I was left fighting back tears. Especially in those moments dealing with children, such as the family with two little girls singing Happy Birthday to their departed father.  There were other vignettes that were also moving, and I am glad that I have seen this film.  But, who do I recommend this movie to?  It's a film for an audience that I'm not sure really exists.  I have briefly seen into the pain of those that lost someone, but I can't say I know more deeply understand nor share that pain.  The film feels like you wandered into the cemetary overheard some snipets of conversations and left.  I honestly cannot figure out who to recommend that experience to.  But if you feel yourself in need of this experience I can recommend a rental.  May God grant the peace to those who have experienced this loss and bless them.",1236643200,,1099,4.422885572139304
3618912,5,B001GQ3ED2,This solemn documentary was heartbreaking. It manages to expose the raw emotions of the families who've lost loved ones to our current war. It doesn't feel like it's exploiting these people though. It's quiet and powerful. I visited Arlington about a year ago and wish I had seen this before my visit. The place itself is powerful but this film exposes a new layer of its meaning.,1236470400,,380,4.686567164179104
3618913,3,B001GQ3ED2,"Desert Storm commander  General H Norman Schwarzkopf once said ""The mothers and fathers of America will give you their sons and daughters...with the confidence in you that you will not needlessly waste their lives. And you dare not. That's the burden the mantle of leadership places upon you. You could be the person who gives the orders that will bring about the deaths of thousands and thousands of young men and women. It is an awesome responsibility. You cannot fail. You dare not fail...""

My three stars were after my first review of this DVD.  By the second review I felt better about this documentary, however, I can not change the star-ratings anymore.

I was stationed at Fort Myer, outside of Arlington National Cemetery, in the summer of 1995.  I would proudly watch as many burials as I could, as the Old Guard stationed there does a touching job for each veteran burried there.  (In fact, I would highly recommend every American watch a military funeral when visiting Arlington National Cemetery).  There is a lot that goes on behind the scenes of a military burial that I wish the documentarians had shown (and that includes more than just digging the graves).  This is why I originally gave this DVD only three stars although a solid four stars is more appropriate.

The DVD's background noises at first bothered me; you can hear jets taking off in the background and hear the traffic off the George Washington Parkway.  Sometimes the wind blew.

However, one can not argue that this DVD needed to be made.  When servicemembers die or get seriously wounded the country does not just lose a warrior, it gains entire families and friends who grieve over the loss of their loved one.  This DVD shows how young mothers, wives, young children, and most touching, former comrades-in-arms mourning at the tombstones of the deceased.

I am an Iraqi War veteran myself.  I was there during the height of the insurgency in 2006-2007.  The daily casualty toll at times was demoralizing.  I've seen young soldiers come back from patrol, I've talked to young enlisted folk who witness the deaths of ther comrades-in-arms.  I've seen their tired and grieving faces.  Watching this DVD brought back those moments of intense pain and sadness in me, another reason why I couldn't give this DVD five stars like everyone else has.  It took me a long time to get back to normal after returning from Iraq; sleeping through the night was especially difficult the first year.

Kudos to the makers of this documentary for portraying a deceased female soldier, too.  The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been raging for almost eight years now and female warriors, although only two percent of the casualties in Iraq, get very little mention.  Kudos also for portraying the ""resident alien"" warriors who have lost their lives in these wars.

This DVD is not quite as in-your-face as ""Baghdad ER"" from the same produces, however, for those who have lost loved ones in either war, this DVD shows many (but not all) behind-the-scenes events at Section 60.",1235779200,2,3043,4.841392649903288

Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery is where military killed in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried. The films shows loved ones of fallen military at the cemetery, some talking to each other, some talking to the gravestones. Many are young women, some have become friends with each other, which shows they spend a lot of time there. One young woman had her two very young children with her, and they sang Happy Birthday to their daddy, who would have been 30 years old. There were many parents, and especially mothers, visiting their sons' graves.

I felt sadness on a couple of different levels. As the wife of a military man who made it home from Iraq, I felt grief for the families and while I didn't go through what they did, I always felt that was a possibility and played that through my mind at times while he was over there. As a mother, I feel pain for the mothers of soldiers who won't return. As the wife of a career military man and the mother of a young military woman, I felt pride for their service and for these sacrifices.

Worth watching",1235692800,6,1169,4.453271028037383
3618915,5,B001GQ3ED2,"As I begin, let me note that I have subscribed to HBO for many years now, with a small break or two along the way, but for the most part I've subscribed to HBO for well over a decade.  Why do I 'pay' for TV, especially premium prices for a channel like HBO?  Because of films and content like Section 60: Arlington National Cemetery (and the very recently aired, excellent film Taking Chance, which would be a great companion piece to this film).

HBO has done many excellent original films during my time as a subscriber. The list is long, and highly distinguished, including many military themed films and/or mini-series events (Band of Brothers comes to mind).  Section 60 is one of the latest in the series of films that help HBO earn the honors they are lauded with.

Section 60 is an HBO Documentary, running approx. 60 incredible minutes, which introduces viewers to ""the saddest acre in America.""  The name-sake Section 60 that the documentary takes the title from is the newest section of Arlington National Cemetery, the section where military personnel killed in action in Iraq and Afghanistan may be buried. Unfortunately, that Section 60 has been filling with too many victims, and too many family members and loved ones have had to visit and pay their respects to the departed.

Section 60, the HBO documentary is fascinating for the way it treats the family members and all of the subject matter with dignity and respect, and also for the glimpses into the way that the family members are shown bonding with others that have also lost loved ones.  What viewers of the documentary see is how members of the military are also part of a much larger family, a brotherhood and sisterhood of military personnel and their extended families.

Thankfully HBO filmed the documentary without a narrator, and no apparent bias in who and what is shown.  The result is a film that is a great introduction to the sacrifices of the military, and the final resting place for so many heroes.

Originally aired on HBO in October 2008, I saved Section 60 (the film) on my HD DVR when it aired and have started to watch it several times, only to feel that I just couldn't make it through a complete viewing before, well, now.  Having received the DVD from Amazon, I finally resolved to view the copy on the DVR and compare it to the DVD.  The copy on the HD DVR was recorded from HBO's high definition channel, as I've become more of an HD snob and refused to watch standard definition content except in rare cases.  That includes standard DVD material, as I'd rather wait for Blu-ray versions of content that I really want to see.  I have to note that in comparing the material that is on the DVD, it compares very favorably to the version that I can watch from my HD DVR.  While neither version is what I would call high definition material, both looked really nice, though it's hard to tell for sure through the 'dust' that seems to be bothering my eyes through a lot of the viewing of material.

I would hope that DVDs of this great documentary are distributed far and wide through the educational system where young people can be educated about current events and military service history.",1235692800,,3188,4.6341030195381885

Our rights as citizens are only as secure as the bravery, sacrifice, and willingness of some to go and to lay down their very lives for their fellow countrymen if need be.  Each generation of Americans it seems has paid that price, sorrow filled but nevertheless.  I don't know who said it, shame on me, but he or she said something like, ""The only thing that keeps those with evil intents from achieving their goals is for good men (and women) to do nothing.""
