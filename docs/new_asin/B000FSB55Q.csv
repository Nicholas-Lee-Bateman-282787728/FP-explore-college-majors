8126099,5,B000FSB55Q,"Made in 1966 this comes from Hungarian director Mikl&oacute;s Jancs&oacute; (`The Red and the White') set some time after the rebellion of 1848. The partisans had carried on fighting the Austrian Habsburgs to throw of the yoke of oppression. In an attempt to stamp them out all suspects are rounded up and put in forced labour camps. The authorities hope to wheedle out the main culprits.

This they do by turning an informer against his former allies, but the wiley Hungarians are pretty strong willed and so the Austrians have to come up with ever more devious ways to catch their quarry.

This is a film that will leave as much unanswered as it actually says - this is a good thing - especially as you don't really notice until it is over. The use of the stark landscape and brilliant sunshine gives this a feeling of bleakness that borders on hopelessness in some aspects. The acting is all excellent as you would expect from a film that has been voted in the top 12 best Hungarian films ever. This is one you could easily watch again and again and would garner more insight each time - a rare thing in cinema and a film that will work for all lovers of classic cinema.",1431216000,,1173,4.4766355140186915
