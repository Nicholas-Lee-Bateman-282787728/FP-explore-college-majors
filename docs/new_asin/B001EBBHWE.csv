8297540,5,B001EBBHWE,"The film is a visual encounter with Yosemite National Park in California as perceived from the present and the past. It is truly a trigger to start thinking about nature in a different way and why we created the concept of national parks.
What is nature? What is the purpose of a national park? Why are we drawn to the solace of nature? Is Yosemite really part of the wilderness? These are some of the questions addressed in this outstanding documentary. Words from the journals of the early explorers of the pristine valley are mixed with encounters with the ""current"" (1990) horde of visitors to the valley. The backdrop of stunning images of the park are mesmerizing as one's mind wonder about the place we call Yosemite. A wonderful thought provoking film about nature and national parks. Highly recommended! The film was made in the late 80s so the images are somewhat dated although the message is as relevant as it ever has been. Excellent!",1342483200,,947,4.745454545454545
