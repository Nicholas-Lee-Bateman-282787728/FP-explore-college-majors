320592,3,6301216237,"An experimental film, a movie within a movie. A filmmaker throws a Valentine's Day party at a theatre that's about to be torn down and invites a bunch of people who are alone; he then goes about asking them why they are alone and do they like it. It's all pretty pretentious and self-indulgent, with some very banal comments made about a very banal society. Orson Welles appears, his last screen role before he died, and he among them all has some of the most banal things to say. There are a few interesting points, a few of the characters reveal some things to ponder (and generally be sad about), but it's not enough. So much of the acting has an improvised feel about it that one begins to wonder if a lot of it actually was. Jazz fans will notice Dave Frishberg in a fairly big acting and singing part.",1113264000,4,807,4.3509933774834435
320593,5,6301216237,"In the waning days before the demolition of the Mayfair Music Hall in Santa Monica, California, the brilliant and unconventional director, Henry Jaglom, created this unique film featuring the final screen performance of Orson Welles, and utilizing Jaglom's customary methods of actor improvisation coupled with perceptive editing, with the result being a moving tour de force of romantic sensibility. A gathering of single entertainment types meets by Jaglom's invitation at the theater on Valentine's Day, sharing perceptions of relationship success and failure as the director's powerful sense of angst rises to the surface with the camera being his investigative companion. Acting honors shall go to Sally Kellerman, whose performance explores most deeply of all her self-awareness of vulnerability and emotional need, and to Andrea Marcovicci, who plays a part as Jaglom's current love, and who sings beautifully as well, and as always. Jaglom's output has been remarkable because of his steadfast determination to create genuinely independent cinema and SOMEONE TO LOVE is a prime example of his talent for showcasing a personal point of view in such a manner that it touches upon the universal.",1109376000,3,1200,5.491891891891892
320594,3,6301216237,"""Always"" (1985) is Henry Jaglom's masterpiece, and his most commercial and accessible work; ""Someone To Love"" (1987) represents a return to form for the iconoclastic filmmaker, where Jaglom  (playing ""Danny,"" a caricature of himself) invites his real-life,  unmarried friends to a party and films conversations at the event in  cinema-verite mode. ""Danny"" asks his friends a series of  questions about why they have chosen to spend their lives alone. Guests  include lyricist Dave Frishberg, actresses Kathryn Harrold and Ronnee  Blakely, and singer/songwriter Stephen Bishop. As Leonard Maltin notes,  some of the ""actors'"" thoughts are interesting, others dull. The  film, however, becomes a gem because lengthy commentaries by the late Orson  Welles (on the subject of... what else?... relationships) precede and  follow the party. From moment to moment, Welles is completely stunning, the  views he espouses intriguing and controversial (at one point, Orson raises  the question of whether or not slavery is wrong!!!). Moreover, Jaglom  frequently splices gorgeous musical interludes (by Frishberg, Bishop, and  Andrea Marcovicci) in-between his guests' thoughts. Near the end of the  picture, Jaglom (either intentionally or unintentionally) raises the  question of whether or not his method of filmmaking entails an invasion of  privacy. These elements alone make the picture a must-see.",927072000,7,1393,5.75

SOMEONE TO LOVE: One of the Big Metaphors of the Me Decade said, ""Your life is a movie; write your own script."" Henry Jaglom took this to heart, and deeply. His is a truly original filmmaking style: part documentary, partially scripted; films in which fictional characters improvise dialog and real people often use scripted lines. Even if it doesn't always work, the effect does blur the line between life and art in interesting ways. Here--much like at a real party--the interview responses run the gamut from the infuriatingly banal (""I think we're all wonderful mirrors for each other"") to the insightful (""I feel like I'm being X-rayed"") to the witty (""Who do I have to **** to get out of this movie?"").

If you can endure the ""second act,"" in which these clips are intercut with eavesdroppings on various pick-up attempts, you get the Big Payoff: Orson Welles as a one-man Greek Chorus, the ultimate Voice of Authority, holding court from the back of the theater, pontificating real answers to tough questions about happiness, love and loneliness in provocative monologs. Orson, in his final performance, is a brilliant, wise, laughing, happy Buddha. What a lovely valentine to us, courtesy of Henry Jaglom.",1422403200,,1472,4.837301587301587

7810330,5,6301216237,"I saw this one on TCM and am glad that I stuck it out.  I apologize in advance to those who might find my critique to be a 'spoiler.'  I simply believe that the issues that Orson Wells brings out are worthy of detailed discussion.

  For me, the most meaningful part of the film is towards the end when the director, Jaglom, debates with Orson Wells about the reasons for loneliness and the need for partnership.  The rather amused intellectual, Wells, asks Jaglom why Jaglom's generation [60's-affected and self-absorbed] is so different from any other generation?  Jaglom doesn't have a very good answer which, in fact, makes Wells' point.

Then Wells--who is very much a liberal--turns around and answers, at least in part, Jaglom's question.  Although sympathetic and even in agreement with the women's liberation movement, Wells detects the worm of alienation embedded within it.  Wells complains about the straight-jacket of politically correct speech.  He then goes on to attack [tongue-in-cheek] the very foundations of liberalism.  Wells informs us [as if we needed informing] that slavery has been practiced since the foundations of the human species.  He informs us that the great civilizations [Egypt, Babylonia, Assyria, Media, Chinese, Cambodian, Aztecan, Incan, Persian, Phoenician, Greek, Roman up to close to the present time] practiced slavery....and...that virtually no one questioned the rectitude of the institution until recently.

Wells goes on to claim that the traditional role of women in Western Society is the last remnant of ""slavery"" and its collapse results, perhaps temporarily, in something like ""equality.""  Wells reminds us that the experiment in something like absolute equality is revolutionary and that the results are very much in doubt.  Most revolutions fail, Wells reminds us, but a few are successful.  If women's rights is a successful revolution, there will be a certain price to pay and one of the prices may be in the alienation and non-fulfillment of women and the emasculation of men.  To paraphrase Wells, this creates a vacuum that something unpleasant and totalitarian may fill.

The ""unattached"" women--primarily women involved in the film arts--invited to Jaglom's version of group therapy, largely disagree with Wells.  They regard their manless situations as either temporary or out-and-out desirable.  We, the viewers, see something fascinating, and I don't think it is contrived.  I think it is entirely unconscious.  Wells is old, fat and espouses concepts that most of these women seemingly disagree with.  At the same time, virtually all the women--most of whom are attractive and relatively young--are CLEARLY attracted to Wells.  It's basic and obvious.  It's not so much that women need men.  They need men that arouse their respect.",1401408000,2,2797,5.32648401826484
7810331,3,6301216237,"The perfect Valentine's Day movie...for dateless singles. Writer-director Henry Jaglom's films tend to polarize viewers. Jaglom reminds me of Ross McElwee (Sherman's March, Time Indefinite) in some ways; although his films aren't technically ""documentaries"", he is like McElwee in the sense that his work is highly personal, usually steeped in the obsessive self-examination of his own relationships with women. In Someone to Love, Jaglom plays (surprise surprise) a film director, who invites all of his friends who are currently ""in between"" relationships to join him at a condemned movie theatre on Valentine's Day for a get-together. Once they arrive, Jaglom admits a small deception-he wants each guest to explain why they think they are alone on Valentine's Day, and he wants to document the proceedings on film. Very talky-but fascinating, thought-provoking and (to my knowledge) a genuinely one-of-a-kind movie experience. Featuring Andrea Marcovicci (who had recently broken up with Jaglom at the time of filming), Sally Kellerman, musician Steven Bishop, and, erm, Orson Welles (don't ask).",1203033600,,1100,5.632530120481928
