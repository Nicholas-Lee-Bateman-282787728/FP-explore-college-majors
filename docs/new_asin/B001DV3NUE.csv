8294989,4,B001DV3NUE,"I wasn't really sure what to expect when I got this DVD other than it would probably be pretty good being a Coach K product.

It is good and has lots of good information about developing solid defensive players.  Some of the defensive concepts demonstrated include pressuring the ball handler, how to force bad shots, create turnovers, denial of passing lanes and how to play the game both mentally and physically, a topic often neglected in instructional DVDs about defense.

The tape was worth what I paid for it to see the defensive concepts explained and demonstrated.  But I was left wondering about how to condition my players to play better defense, which was why I bought the DVD. There are some concepts presented, but it is not the bulk of the information in the DVD.  Buy it for the DEFENSE demonstrated!
