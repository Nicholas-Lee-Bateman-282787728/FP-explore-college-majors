5126599,5,B0083TUE9M,"I bought these after seeing some other movies by the same people. Though there are a few things that are a bit corny, perhaps, to some, overall they can be helpful both in addressing issues that people face in view of Christianity and also in showing Jesus in a caring, compassionate way without straying from Biblical principals. If you have been hurt by religion or want to address issues in these movies themes, they would be worth checking into.",1362787200,5,449,4.69620253164557

5126640,5,B0083TUE9M,"All of Jefferson Moore's movies are great. They reach you in a way that is very special.
God and religion is given to you in away where you feel and understand,not where it is forced on you.
I saw The Perfect Stranger and after that I feel a total change in my life.
The actors are great,and everyone seems to relate to each other. You are drawn into the story as if you
were there and a part of it.
If you haven't seen his movies,do so! You will not be sorry. I bought every one of his movies.
I pray he continues to make more.",1425081600,2,528,3.990566037735849
5126641,5,B0083TUE9M,"LOVE this series! I also have THE PERFECT STRANGER and ANOTHER PERFECT STRANGER. I'll be buying NIKKI AND THE PERFECT STRANGER soon. If I remember correctly, there was also a Christmas STRANGER movie too...I don't have it yet, but I've seen it several times on TV.
  This boxed set was purchased in a Christian bookstore, and was one of the best buys I've ever made....I watch it and love it! I would recommend it to all ages...great for families!",1411084800,3,447,4.6455696202531644
5126642,5,B0083TUE9M,"Very heart warming and moving.
If I met Jesus, like these people did in the series, I would hug him and never let go.
He would have to zap me to get me off of him. LOL
Love, love, love this series!!!",1410566400,2,199,3.761904761904762
5126643,5,B0083TUE9M,What would Jesus say is a good second title for this set of short movies. They make you think about what really counts in this short life on earth. The love of God is shown in a biblical way that shows that God cares about each person like his child. From RGB in Tennessee.,1404604800,3,273,4.074074074074074
5126644,5,B0083TUE9M,5 Stars across the board. Very thought provoking. A must see.,1404086400,3,61,4.636363636363637

5126646,5,B0083TUE9M,"These movies are extremely captivating and inspiring.  My 81 yr old Mother introduced these to me and my 12 yr old granddaughter one weekend and we both sat in utter quiet with a range of emotions going through us.  Happy. Intense. Hanging on to every word. So compelled by the story and words of the character portraying Jesus. Oh how awesome it would be to actually spend a day with Jesus here on planet Earth like that!!!!
I would recommend Pastor & Youth Pastors doing a MOVIE NIGHT at your church using these films ..... Powerful. Impacting !!!!",1395964800,11,550,4.6020408163265305
5126647,5,B0083TUE9M,Thank You. I'm very pleased with this purchase. It is just what I wanted. I can't wait to watch them.,1384646400,3,101,4.1
5126648,5,B0083TUE9M,I enjoyed each series and have already recommended the TV series and DVD's to friends. This series is unfortunately seen on TV at 1:30am in the morning on the weekends so it is nice to have the DVD.,1384300800,3,198,4.2368421052631575
5126649,5,B0083TUE9M,"These are great ""mini-movies"" with interesting story-lines that might draw in the secular audience, as well as the Christian one/s; & mixed-aged family viewing.  Would be really good, for the mid-teen study groups, as they aren't ""beneath"" their intelligence; but not overtly Biblical, either.  I also purchased the two ""Dinner-withs""..the one with the Mom with marraige on the rocks...and later, with her daughter, headed for college.  A great alternative for some ""Chick-flick"" viewing; while the guys are rehashing the ballgames, maybe?",1378857600,3,539,5.62962962962963

8524714,5,B0083TUE9M,"This series is a wonder! It's so well done, and the insightful writing gives voice to the recorded words of Christ so well that this is a very viable estimate of how he may have spoken today as portrayed in the show. Of course we'll never know that with certainty, but its clear that this greatly echoes many of his statements in the New Testament. The only problem? Its so good that I can only ask, WHY DIDN'T THIS TERRIFIC SERIES RUN FOR MORE THAN JUST SEVEN EPISODES?
I'd buy 10 seasons of this in a heartbeat, if it were available.",1508889600,,535,4.306930693069307
