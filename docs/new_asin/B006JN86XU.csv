4993497,4,B006JN86XU,"At about an hour and fifteen minutes, the feature program is longer than most other Super Bowl recap DVD's of recent memory.  I was expecting the standard 30 minute retelling of the Super Bowl and short snippets of the season's highlights leading up to it, but what I got was a comprehensive review of every Giant game this season, win or lose, and the featured play from each game in high definition on blu-ray.

What makes this program special is the fact that NFL Films has recently elevated their high definition photography to an art form, so every play is stunning in its appearance and when the players are miked up for sound and they are hit or are hitting, the brutality of the sport is graphically spotlighted.  On a good sound system, some of these hits sound as brutal as they look.

Obviously, for the Giant fan, buying this memento of another improbable run is a no-brainer, but even for the casual NFL fan, this feature-length film features some of the best behind-the-scene footage of preseason coaching, banter between officials and players, sideline discussions (including the now-infamous Bill Belichick ""make 'em throw it to Manningham"" plea during the Super Bowl) and other rare moments that only the NFL Films crew has access to.

The scene selections are divided by game, so if you wish to fast forward through the Giants mid-season swoon and get to the good stuff, just flick the remote and off you go!  What I also liked about the program is the highlighting of all players who played an integral part in this championship, like Victor Cruz, Jason Pierre-Paul and even Chase Blackburn.  Sure, this is Eli's team, but you are not beaten over the head with it, like you were with the Aaron Rogers or Drew Brees love-fest videos.  This was truly a team effort, and the narrative certainly makes the most of that theme.

I also like how candid they were able to get with Tom Coughlin, particularly his heartfelt post game speeches, and especially with linebacker Michael Boley, who you can clearly see took over Michael Strahan's role as the emotional leader of this defense, and who I believe was even more emotionally invested this year than Strahan was during the 2007 run.  I certainly hope they peg him for at least one spot in the America's Game film of this team's story.  I vote for Boley, Cruz and either Pierre-Paul or Ahmad Bradshaw to be the narrators, as Coughlin and Manning are probably not going to repeat...all I can do is speculate of course!

The bonus material is not extensive, but it does feature the Super Bowl ceremony with everyone humorously assaulting Raymond Berry as he escorts the Lombardi Trophy through the field, as well as Super Bowl Media Day highlights, a short Super Bowl XLII retrospective (borrowed liberally from the NFL Films feature) among a half dozen or so clips and highlights.  Nothing to write home about, but that's hopefully not what you bought it for.

All in all, NFL Film's ability to be EVERYWHERE during filming of these games (including in the cheap seats!) makes this a truly unique perspective on a truly unique season and team.  I think the most memorable moment of this feature is the very prophetic shot of Mario Manningham's mother in deep focus in the stands at the Super Bowl, then a close up on her son and Manning, just before Eli calls the play that ultimately defines and decides Super Bowl XLVI.  You'll be asking yourself, how did they know?  Maybe they already knew it was destiny repeating itself...",1330992000,21,3491,4.743801652892562
4993498,5,B006JN86XU,"This is an ACTUAL review of the DVD, and not a bunch of whining about Blu-Ray or Hi-def or what people think this DVD should contain. Such things are of no matter to me personally. As long as I have a lasting document of this incredible season, I am happy.

I received the DVD earlier today, in advance of the Tuesday release date. All I can say is...stunning!

The first thing I must say is that to call this a season's highlight package is to sell this production woefully short. ""Cinematic"" is a more appropriate term. NFL Films, as a production studio, consistently puts out a product that rivals any Hollywood studio and can easily play on the big screen. You will have a greater appreciation of how fast and violent this game is when watching this, or anything from NFL Films. When you see the camera focused on a ball in flight, that is likely from the camera of Donnie Marx. That's his signature shot. He's got to be one of the best cameramen working in any medium. His shot of Tom Brady's ""Fail Mary"" at the end of the Super Bowl is a thing of beauty.

About this DVD in particular, I got chills and that nervous stomach when watching, even though I knew what was going to happen. If you were already a fan of Giants' WR Victor Cruz, you will grow to love him even more. NFL Films was able to capture him in those moments, and you'll see that he plays the game with a team-first attitude and a childlike enthusiasm (on display when the Giants win the NFC Championship, and sprints across the field). I have to use the world ""childlike"", because when he is handed the Lombardi Trophy, his eyes open wide and he looks at the trophy as if he's reliving the moment he held his first child a few weeks earlier. I also love an exchange between Safety Deon Grant and one of the refs during the Atlanta playoff game where Grant argues the spot of the ball. The ref tells Grant to do his job and he'll do his. Grant replied that he DID his job and that why the spot is where HE said it was. Classic stuff.

I think the one tiny complaint that I have with the DVD is that it focused on Giants' WR Domenik Hixon's acrobatic TD catch against the Rams. But they don't mention that it was Victor Cruz's window into the starting lineup, since Hixon suffered a season-ending injury to his ACL on the play. I DID like that they didn't spend too much time on the shellacking that New Orleans put on the Giants on that Monday night.

The one major complaint that I had about the Giants ""Road to SB XLII"" set is addressed on this DVD, as the Super Bowl XLVI Post-game trophy ceremony is presented in the special features, along with Media Day highlights from the NFL Network, an interview with Eli Manning conducted by the man he supplanted as Giants QB...Kurt Warner, A interview with the Giants WR Corps, and a feature on Super Bowl XLII hero David Tyree.

Giants fans...I really can't wait for you to see this DVD!",1330732800,29,2906,4.35239852398524
4993499,4,B006JN86XU,I am also going to wait until they release the blu ray that has all the playoff games on them. I still have the super bowl on my dvr. BTW can I also add that Joe Buck calling the game in 07 was way better then Al Micheals in 2011 season. On the hail mary he does not sound excited at all the ball dropped. Joe Buck makes the plax touchdown in  07 sound great.,1329955200,2,359,3.7866666666666666
4993500,4,B006JN86XU,"It's 2012.  Issue these discs in HD widescreen!  I haven't bought a standard-def DVD (with the exception of several Seinfeld sets) in 3 years.  I will buy any sets of Blu-ray Giants football discs the NFL puts out.  I will only (grudgingly) *rent* the standard-def DVD versions.  Let's go, baby!  HD widescreen!

Heck, I bought 2007 road to the sb on dvd and I will pony up the doh for the blu ray copy. Make some money, just do it... now!",1328832000,15,302,4.135593220338983
4993503,3,B006JN86XU,"It will be great to have this game on blu-ray (as opposed to the lame standard def DVD of Super Bowl XLII - too bad the Giants won that one just before blu-ray won the high-def format war, because it really sucks that there's never been a blu-ray issue of that). However, it will be even better if the NFL also issues all of the NY Giants' playoff games, like they did in 1997.

NFL, please do this one like the last Giants Super Bowl run, where you also included the wild card, divisional and championship games.  In fact, it would be great if you took this occasion to re-issue the 2007 DVD set on blu-ray, and also issue the 2011 run with ALL of the playoff games.

The playoff games were adequately covered. However, some of the regular season games were rushed. I understand that this is a Giants' season highlight film, but you have to show the good and the bad. They hardly covered the Giants losses. In particular, the Giants lost the 1st game of the season to the Redskins. They showed 3 highlights of the game and it lasted all of 30 seconds. They did the same thing with the Monday Night Football debacle against the Saints. Had they shown the losses as well as the wins, then that would've added even more suspense to the Giants winning the Super Bowl since it would've shown that this team could overcome adversity. They could've also talked about the Giants recovering from the Plaxico Burress incident and Tom Coughlin's job security.

Could the Patriots won in spite of Brady? maybe if they got really, really lucky and had a healthy Gronkowski.  I give the Pats credit for being in a semi-rebuilding year and still making the Superbowl, but I give the Giants credit for not making any big mistakes.

This was done in the DVD covering the 2003-2004 Giants' season.  Such a bonus feature could have given a ten or fifteen minute recap of each game similar to the weekly summaries on the NFL channel.

Like the previous DVD, they chronicle the whole season and highlight the great plays from each game.  The narration and music is very well done.  The footage is great.  The extra coverage from the Super Bowl was very good.

I do wish that they would have covered Coach Coughlin's speech that he gave his team on the night before the Super Bowl.  I recall the NBC correspondent reporting that it was really inspirational.  Then again it could be on the last extra segment (""Super Bowl Media Day Coverage"") or in the other extras that I have not watched.

4993629,4,B006JN86XU,This season review has coverage of every game the Giants played in their 2011/12 season. Unfortunately because their regular season form was so patchy the producers have decided to try and skate over some of the defeats by just showing Giants touchdowns without mentioning the scores in the games at the time the TD's occurred. This kills any suspense or tension because you have no idea how significant the touchdown was in the course of the game. Fortunately once you get to the important end of season games and playoffs the coverage is better and you're always aware of what the score is when a significant play occurs adding to the enjoyment. Overall this is a good DVD with lots of footage but it's not as good as previous season reviews I've purchased.,1338768000,,759,4.714285714285714
4993630,4,B006JN86XU,"after a quick start with a reminder of superbowl 2008, there are highlights of the regular season, about 40 minutes. then there are 15 minutes of highlites on the 3 races of the playoff, and finally 17 minutes dedicated to the superbowl. total dvd is 72 minutes. extra are all dedicated to SB, media day,post game,recap. also 2 extra on cruz e david tyree. total extra are about 40 minutes.
the ugly defect, for me, of these commemorative dvd is that the game have ended in defeat less than one minute of footage, and rarely shows the td scored by opposing teams. in conclusion a dvd that satisfies fans of the genre.
i hope it is put on sale a dvd ""the road to the superbowl 2012"".",1337644800,,682,4.377952755905512
4993631,2,B006JN86XU,The title states Super Bowl XLVI  I foolishly assumed it would be a replay of the entire Super Bowl. I wish I had read the reviews because the product did not deliver. I was out of the country and missed seeing the game and then paid for a highlight film. Contemplating sending it back to Amazon.,1336262400,,296,4.285714285714286
4993632,5,B006JN86XU,I enjoyed watching the DVD on the recent 2011 regular season and 2012 playoffs & Super Bowl. It shows that this team never quit and over came injuries and a mid season slump of loosing 4 games in a row. Tom Coughlin and the coaches deserves congrats on a great season. Highly reccommend this DVD for any NFL Football Fan.,1336262400,,321,4.366666666666666
4993633,4,B006JN86XU,"I ordered this DVD along with the Super Bowl XLII DVD and noted that in four years, virtually nothing has changed with this product.  There is the usually game by game highlights leading up to the Superbowl, which has the most detailled highlights.  It does start with the prior Superbowl match-up with Michael Strahan telling his teamates that the final score will be 17-14.  It then fast forwards to (2011).

The highlights are fairly exciting with a lot more shown in the games that were close.  The best highlights are the close loss to Green Bay and the win against the Jets.  Some of the the more brutal loses (the loss to New Orleans and the second Washington loss) have very brief highlights.

The Superbowl has some interesting highlights including hearing the Patriot players saying to let the Giants score (at the end of the game) and then Brady's comments to his teamates just before his last second heave to the end-zone.

The extras were a little disappointing, with no interviews of anyone from the Patriots.  There is the Media Day and the presentation of the Super Bowl trophy as well as highlights of Super Bowl XLII and an interview with David Tyree.

I liked the DVD in general but did not feel it any superior to the older one so I couldn't give it more than 4 stars.",1336176000,2,1288,4.585152838427947
4993634,5,B006JN86XU,"I am a big Giants fan & this video is terrific. I don't get the negative reviews by some folks here who were expecting to see the Super Bowl XLVI telecast on here. This is NFL Films, folks. Except for the ""Greatest Games"" series, you're not going to see entire games on NFL Films productions (and even they don't have every single play on them). Find out the contents before you buy it, what can I say? Wait for ""New York Giants - Road To XLVI"". That will have the four postseaon TV broadcasts replayed on them. Regarding this video, another great job by NFL Films. Every regular season & postseason game highlights are shown with the usual superior camera work & narration. The extra content is interesting in my view also. I got the Blu-Ray version which has three extra features (about 20 minutes) on it than the DVD. Every Giants fan should own this trip down memory lane to another improbable title, like 2007. Hopefully, the ""America's Game"" video they make for this will be made available to purchase along with the XLII (2007) version (which is still unavailable yet, very puzzling).

4993635,5,B006JN86XU,The quality is fantastic and it contains all of the great highlights of Big Blue's win.  It is so much better than the SB XLII one because it is now in high def.  Here's hoping they put together a road to the super bowl set with all the playoff games.,1335398400,,251,4.0

I have a copy of the fabulous IVII Giants Super Bowl video. It has all the playoff games, in their entirety. This doesn't even have the Super Bowl in its entirety.

This video should clearly state it is a ""highlight film"".

Then produce a complete video as in the past. I did like the highlights of the games during the season. The change I would suggest is limiting the length of early less significant games and longer length key games.

I would buy the second longer video, regardless of price. I would not buy the ""highlight"" version.",1335139200,2,612,4.4375

4993643,1,B006JN86XU,"I must say this DVD was a disappointment for the following reasons. First, they preview superbowl XLII - an unnecessary addition AND What they left out was a post game show with interviews (from both teams) -- a feature many football fans enjoy. The only postgame feature they had was the ceremony...NOT the best. The rest include conversations with Manning, the receiving corp and David Tyree. Personally, I look for the post game analysis as the most interesting. In addition, the physical nature of the Game with San Francisco was one of the best -- that was omitted. Frankly, I'd save my money and do some searches on the interview to see game highlights and post-game interviews -- you'd get more from it. Can't understand why the post-game stuff would have been left off...Perhaps to get you to buy another DVD????",1333497600,2,820,4.822695035460993
4993644,1,B006JN86XU,"I am very disappointed in the DVDs I purchased. 15 different supposed super bowl collection series DVDs. A series in which a different super bowl was what the cover depicts for each team. THE SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS then it gives the number of the super bowl in roman numerals. Other have Americans game the SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP and shows the ring on the cover. Did I miss something? Would that mean the game is what the DVD is about?  Wrong the only super bowls I have received in their eternity are the two Broncos' super bowls of the Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXIII that came along with the 1977 AFC Championship Game in a three set entitled the Broncos 3 greatest games. Said nothing about super bowl games. The only reason I knew the super bowl games were included was I had researched it on another website what I should have done for these. All very misleading. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning 13 DVD. Very disappointed.

It is a great souvenier of a wonderful season and shows how much talent and heart this team has. Burned by the worst injury list one could imagine and the toughest schedule the league could drop on a team,they still pulled themselves together and did what they needed to do: get into the playoffs. From that point onward it was a whole new season. This dvd captures all of this and the highlights of the Super Bowl victory over New England. It does not include any full games, but there probably will be a ""Run to the Super Bowl"" set like the last time we went and we'll get the entire playoff games with that. Anyway, I highly recommend it and state to the world...GO GIANTS!",1332028800,,843,4.3081761006289305

4993647,3,B006JN86XU,"I've been duped into buying each of the Giants' last two Super Bowl winning seasons DVDs. NFL Films, thanks for taking my money while delivering a pedestrian, rushed-to-market product.

My chief complaint with this (and with the Super Bowl 42 DVD) is that the narration fails to TELL THE STORY of the season. It's hard to make this Giants campaign seem flavorless, but they did. The format of the film is such that they'll go over a few highlights of each game rather journalistically, move on to the next one, and lather, rinse, repeat. There is very little commentary and they barely put anything in context. How about beginning with the fact that the team was widely criticized for making no free agent impact, for allowing Steve Smith to slip to Philadelphia, to see Plax return with the Jets? How about mentioning the fact that each of Coughlin's eight seasons in New York have begun with a 5-2 or better record, and late season declines were a pattern that was on the minds of everyone when they seemed to begin another one? How about discussing the emergence of JPP, the contract dispute with Osi, or Justin Tuck's tumultuous season -- rife with personal lose and physical injury -- before returning to strengthen the defense down the stretch? Or Eli Manning's bounce back year, in which he defended his pre-season remarks and reversed a nasty turnover trend to throw a record-setting 15 TD passes in the fourth quarter? No, no mention of any of this. Instead, all you get is ""Bradshaw ran for a TD... then Eli threw for one... the Giants won X to Y. The next week, Cruz had two TDs, Corey Webster had an INT, the Giants won X to Y...""

In fairness, the footage is pretty spectacular. Makes you wonder where it is when the officials don't have a good view on a replay review and the announcers are telling you ""all they have is what you're seeing on your screen, folks.""

The bottom line is, I get these DVDs so I can remember the finer points of a miraculous season and so that in 10, 20 years time, I can pop the DVD in and bring this season back to life. I seriously doubt that this product will serve that purpose.",1331337600,33,2125,4.514285714285714

8499495,5,B006JN86XU,"These DVDs are meant for right now, the offseasons when we have nothing to celebrate. I give this disc 5 stars because its NFL Films version of the story of the 2011 Giants, which is much more exciting minute for minute, watch the entire season in 70 or so minutes.  Watching the games is great too, but that's Road to the Superbowl 46, and each game demands 2 and a half hours, that can maybe be shortened to 70 minutes if you're an active viewer like me holding the remote in order to fast forward the 40 seconds between snaps.
NFL Films is must see, their angles make even blowouts look like epic titanic struggles every week on SHO Inside the NFL.  So you have to have this disc, because all you have see in the broadcast version. There's no other way to see this great footage, the best of all 20 games, without owning this DVD.
 The 2011 run lacks the tight struggles of 2011, or 1990 for that matter. No matter, a Superbowl win run demands our attention for the rest of our lives.  Nothing is guaranteed, it might be 40 years until the next one, ask the Bengals, Cardinals, Vikings, Bills, Browns, well you get the picture.
