3952066,5,B002MAG7F8,"After seeing the world premier of the Special Edition of ""Spirit of '76"" I was not disappointed. I have listen to Mike Church's other audio documentaries which are not only educational but also fantastic. However this movie far surpassed my expectations and was packed with tons of great information that filled in many gaps of this event in history for me.

This movie will take you back in time, and let you see how our founding fathers debated and ratified the US Constitution. There was real debate over how the States should be governed if at all, not just the fairytale that I was taught in the public education system. What I enjoyed about this movie was 3 fold. First the sound was incredible, the rain falling and lighting outside Independence Hall sounded so real and it really helped set the scenes. Second the illustrations and video work helped me watch each scene and take in visually what it would have looked like in the late 1780's. Lastly, the movie was not just ""educational"" but I felt I was learning and being entertained all at the same time. Isn't that what we all want? Finally a movie that teaches how the worlds most famous document.

Overall 5 stars. Anyone who wants to learn and be educated should by this movie. Also if you have kids this is a must have, I know my niece and nephew love anything animated. Why not let them learn at the same time. Thanks Mike for another wonderful production!",1259884800,,1422,4.594488188976378
3952067,5,B002MAG7F8,"There is no better time in American (or global) history to tell this story.  This is the most important part of US  history, it needs to be understood by everyone, and needs to be understood now. Church's theatrical description of this story will be easily understood and appreciated by all.  I will listen to it several times, as I have the two previous stories (Fame of Our Fathers and Road to Independence) by the King Dude.",1259798400,3,427,4.592105263157895
3952068,5,B002MAG7F8,"What role did Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison play in the ratification of our Constitution? What about Paine and Morris? For those who are looking for a ""play-by-play"" recap of how the Founding Fathers debated and finally ratified our U.S. Constitution, look no further than Mike Church's ""Spirit of 76"" as the definitive recount of what really happened. Rather than relying on accounts from other historians, Church delves deep into the writings of those of the time to give the viewer an accurate view if what really happened from 1776-1787. You won't find a more accurate description of the creation of the Constitution and the birth of the United States of America.

Kudos to Mike Church for his in-depth research and effort!",1259280000,2,730,5.033057851239669
3952069,5,B002MAG7F8,"The Tie-ins, from Mike Church, relating date's and different part's of history coming together with the true intent of what our founding fathers, United States Citizens, were trying to and did accomplish is simply incredible.
When you receive this item be prepared to sit back and learn what they meant the Constitution to say and do.
See how without an educational system in-tune to holding the Constitution as it was meant to be, The founding fathers warned that if we, individuals, don't pay attention to the laws and right's of the U.S. Constitution, the Government will take our freedom's away.
Just as we seem to have happening today.

Spend the money, watch it as often as necessary to understand and learn the Constitution. Then start to teach our children what the U.S. Constitution is and what it stands for. . . .",1259020800,2,824,4.802816901408451
3952070,5,B002MAG7F8,"This was an awesome movie. I was a little skeptical about the animation part, but get past that. The information, the story, the history, those are the important and exciting parts about this. I'm going to drag as many of my relatives and friends over to see this that I can. Schools call it education. I call it indoctrination. Give young people the facts, like in this movie. Give them the chance to overcome the indoctrination. Do this at least.",1257552000,2,448,4.6125
3952071,5,B002MAG7F8,"The long anticipated wait is over and I received the DVD/CD set on Monday. I watched it on Tuesday and I was not disappointed. For me, some of it was a refreasher course in America's founding; however, there was a lot to learn as well. For one, my rememberance of Madison was crushed and I no longer hold the respect for him as a founder that I once had. The only comment I have is the editor should have left the characters standing. Having them ""walk"" while speaking in the manner they did was pretty lame. I highly recommend this DVD/CD set as a gift for the upcoming gift-giving season. Show it to your children and/or grandchildren. It is time we undo the indoctrination of our government run schools.",1256774400,2,706,4.48062015503876
3952072,5,B002MAG7F8,"The work by Mike Church his staff and the production crew have outdone themselves.  I love it!

This story about the writing and ratification of the Constitution is explained like never before.

Mike lays it out with style and substance.  The true story of the document that should be the blue print for the management of our great country.

A great story!  Well done Mike and Staff!!!",1256774400,2,385,4.6716417910447765
3952073,5,B002MAG7F8,"My wife and I were in attendance for the premier of this film at XM studios in Washington, D.C.; this production was much more then we expected going in.

Between the narration by Mike Church, the convincing performances by the films participants, and the cameos by the Church daughters, Reagan and Madison this film provides entertainment, meticulously researched information and shocking revelations that settle the debates of our time.

I thought I was fairly well educated on the founding of our great Republic before seeing this film and I have to admit that there were a lot of holes in my memory that were never filled in by my formal education.

The Articles of Confederation were lacking in sufficient coverage for the issues of the time, specifically the threat to commerce by the Spaniards who were claiming title to the Mississippi river and excise being imposed by the States on commerce. This film will fill in the blanks and dispel tall tails spoken for many years by many about the true heroes of the Constitution.

You will meet Thomas Pinckney, Patrick Henry, William Paterson and the other true voices behind what we know today to be our Constitution; they presented the main decent to the Virginia plan constructed by James Madison, this plan was known as the New Jersey plan.

The reluctant leadership by George Washington of this gathering and passionate speeches by the attendees will stir in you the passion for freedom our founders had just recently fought to attain from the English monarchy.

The Federalists fortunately lost their plea for a new king to be coronated, lifetime appointments to Senate and the stripping of States rights.

The founders knew the woes of too much power being bestowed upon a central authority and delivered a Republic to the States.

This very foundation is being threatened today by others who would rather do for you then allow you to do for yourself.

Get this movie, watch it, show it to your children, your friends and anyone else you can think of; it is the obligation of all Americans to know your history or you shall be doomed to repeat it.",1253577600,15,2106,4.8277777777777775
3952074,5,B002MAG7F8,"I listened to The Spirit of '76 on this morning's Mike Church show.  Very interesting, very educational, very entertaining, very well done.  Five stars for Mike Church.",1253145600,9,168,5.185185185185185
3952075,1,B002MAG7F8,Made a mistake by ordering Spirit of 76 so early for my son's birthday- ordered 1.5 months in advance and missed return policy.  Both DVD's have errors and do not play.  Sad because I was going to show to all the kids in my carpool- hoping they would learn something.  Too late to return- very bummed at quality.,1323648000,,312,4.344827586206897
3952076,1,B002MAG7F8,"The production of this DVD is very amateurish. The animated characters are not really animated, but rather an arm or mouth moving on occasion on a stationary cardboard like figure.

An elementary school project would produce a better viewing experience.

The history included is fascinating, and enlightening and the audio is very good.  Mike and his adorable daughters did a nice job in trying to bring history to life.  Too bad this was marketed as a DVD which in and of itself is a very poor product.

The content gets lost in the annoying presentation.  I would recommend this for the content, but it is not a video worth buying.  It should be sold as an audio disc and priced accordingly and then I would have given it 4 or 5 stars.",1323129600,,737,4.537878787878788
3952077,5,B002MAG7F8,"Learn what you have never learned from the educational institutions of America about the actually important foundations America has dismissed.  Since dismissing these foundations, America is adrift heading towards destruction, but most don't notice since they don't know what we are adrift from.  This documentary fills in that gap.",1316217600,,332,5.755102040816326
3952078,5,B002MAG7F8,Everyone should watch this. great for your kids. They should show this in every school. It keeps the the kids intrested.,1316217600,,120,4.761904761904762
3952079,5,B002MAG7F8,"I originally purchased from mikechurch.com with the intent of completing an assignment in my US History class. I though it was a great excuse to finally purchase it. Sadly, the military postal system didn't get it to me in over here in Iraq in time, thus I was forced to write a review of ""Horse Soldiers"" for my class.

Anyhow, I watched the film and was throuroughly pleased, scratch that, enlightened and excited to share it with my family. Who cares if the animation isn't that of Pixar or some other multi-billion dollar corporation. That isn't the point. The content is what matters. The film is true to its cause. Mr. Church set out to create a film to tell us what the history books either omit or skew through political correctness. We learn who the real founders are and who the real defenders of libery are by their own very words, not the interpretations of a text book.

For anyone who is looking for a film that will provide insight as to the real story of our founders with out the glitter of Hollywood or the political correctness, this is for you. If you want a film your children can understand and learn the true history and intent of our constitution, this is for you.",1314921600,,1188,4.49537037037037
3952080,5,B002MAG7F8,"Great video. Only complaint was the animation, but the story and narraration more than make up for it. Good job Mr. Church and crew.",1313280000,,132,4.541666666666667
3952081,5,B002MAG7F8,This is the real story of the reason for the war of American independence. Everyone needs to watch this movie and throw away your government school history books.,1309478400,,162,4.821428571428571
3952082,5,B002MAG7F8,I find myself in agreement with Brutus on the movie....what a great educational tool it has been for me. I truly enjoy listening to Mike Church on Sirius XM. Thank you Mike you've opened my mind and great job on this production!!!!,1305504000,,231,4.523809523809524
3952083,5,B002MAG7F8,This is by far the best presentation of the writing and ratification of the Constitution that has ever been produced.  Every single American should be duct taped to a chair and required to watch this.,1294704000,,200,4.714285714285714
3952084,5,B002MAG7F8,This is a window to our country's beginnings. It reflects on our form of government and how we can participate in healthy debate. We must be ever vigilant of tyranny created by big government.,1294531200,,192,4.676470588235294
3952085,3,B002MAG7F8,"I enjoyed the premise of the movie, although it was like watching an educated slide show. Personally Mike Church and his wife don't seem as involved or concerned with how personal orders go. Don't order directly from them or their website, if you want quality shipping anyways. I paid for 3-5 days on a couple T-Shirts and it took almost a month, and writing directly to them and asking I recieved ""it's not our fault"" and ""how dare you criticize my company"" replies. I have since stopped buying from them. I have no regrets for the merchandise, they are good, high quality, except for my remarks about the video made earlier in this statement.",1293840000,3,644,4.657894736842105
3952086,5,B002MAG7F8,"I loved this DVD and it was very obvious that this was a project of love on behalf of Mr. Church.  This is the perfect tool to show in classrooms to educate both kids and adults alike.  One thing that is extremely impressive is the quality of the sound track it's simply amazing.  If you're looking for high tech animation your not going to find it here... but animation is not what its all about.  Learning the truth about our Constitution is all that matters and on that matter Mr. Church is an expert.

Do your children and your grand children a favor... buy this video and all the other great productions from Mr. Church... it's a great place to start to teach your kids about this great country outside the public school systems.",1289520000,,734,4.447761194029851
3952087,5,B002MAG7F8,"I highly recommend ""The Spirit of 76"" DVD by Mike Church.  It is highly informative, and our whole family (including our 12 and 10 year old kids) enjoyed it.",1287446400,,157,4.413793103448276
3952088,5,B002MAG7F8,"I wasn't really sure about what to expect with this. I'm a fan of the Mike Church show on Sirius Patriot radio. Honestly, I bought this dvd more out of curiosity than anything else but I sure am glad I made that decision. This turned out to be informative and entertaining. The artwork is fantastic and there's actually some humor thrown in as well. I highly recommend this for anyone wanting to know about the ""real"" story behind the writing and ratifying of the U.S. constitution.",1287360000,,482,4.616279069767442
3952089,5,B002MAG7F8,"This is the only film, to my knowledge, that covers the true story of the writing and ratifying of our Constitution! It will be an instant classic. The dialog is a little hard to follow at times due to the differences in the use of the english language 224 years ago, but, I had no problem with it overall. The only thing that could use improvment was the animation. Still, it wasn't terrible animation. It was just like the video's you used to watch in class. Mostly still animation. Good job Mr. Church!",1287014400,,505,4.440860215053763

3952092,5,B002MAG7F8,"I started listening to Mike Church about a year and a half ago and after hearing him mention the film and provide excerpts on his show many times decided it was time to check it out myself and I was very glad I did. The film is well put together with narration by Mike Church and well drawn artistic renditions of our founding fathers whose animation doesn't distract from the historic telling of our founding but rather keeps the viewer fascinated and interested throughout the film. It is definitely a must see for anyone who wants the unedited, unfiltered and undistorted truth of the founding of these United States. I would recommend this for all ages as I plan on showing it to my son when he is old enough. Thanks Mike!",1284336000,,726,4.507575757575758
3952093,5,B002MAG7F8,"this is one of the best history lessons i've ever received, privately or scholastically.  more people should take the time to learn history since it affects so much of their lives.  unfortunately, public schools make it so drab and dry that it becomes a nuisance.  as Winston Churchill quoted ""Those that fail to learn from history, are doomed to repeat it.""  we are seeing this every day in our lives yet very few recognize this.  i commend Mr. Church for creating this fine documentary and the courage to tell the story.  keep up the good work, Mike!",1282435200,,552,4.639175257731959

This is a very good representation of our founding fathers and what what they did for us. What would they think if they saw us now? We must change our ways! NOW, before it is too late, if it is not already. We must REMEMBER how we started out and get real. The message of this DVD is important,real,and should provoke us to action.

3952099,5,B002MAG7F8,"This was a gift to myself.  It was from my wife but I specifically requested this so she made me order it myself.  Just to make sure that there was no mistake.  The story is told in such detail that we learn far more about what factors, events and thoughts went into the creation of the single most important document in history.  The detail is more than we get in news reports of current political events.",1278374400,,406,4.302631578947368
3952100,5,B002MAG7F8,"The Spirit of '76 is an interesting and entertaining animated documentary.  Mike Church has spent years studying the notes and works from several founding fathers.  With an assist from American historian and U.S. Constitutional scholar, Dr. Kevin Gutzman, numerous talented men for 'founding father's voices', gifted animation artists, and several amazing 'behind-the-scene' folks, Mike Church has produced a top-of-the-line movie-documentary of our early American history.  Mike also has available for purchase @ [...] the audio version of ""Spirit of '76"" [which contains parts omitted from the DVD], ""The Road to Independence"" and ""The Fame of Our Fathers"".  As of this review, he is working on the theatrical debut of ""Road to Independence""...which I am looking forward to purchasing, watching and enjoying.  5 star work, Mike.",1278288000,,830,5.608

But that never really was the point. The STORY is the point, and the visuals are just a way for the creators to make following the story easier. It can be pretty handy for understanding the interplay of characters, even if it's not quite as smooth as Japanese Monster Movies. ;)

Buy this. Buy it for you and buy it for your kids. Even the young ones, the ones still in grade school.. even they'll like it, because it gives a presentation of the most important period in our history in a new and fascinating way.",1278201600,,584,4.398148148148148

My daughters are extremely young so I didn't expect them to watch much but the animation captured their attention for a lot longer than I expected. They cuddled with me during what they called the, ""Thunder Man."" It was truly a great experience and I still say Wilkow doesn't sound like his usual gravel and bourbon self. It's a good thing you are doing here Mitter Church and I love the fact that you and you alone have taken the initiative to teach us through your own hard work instead of using the work of others. Honorable is the only word that comes to mind. You do us proud and I'm sure Gutsman and Woods are equally proud of their co-refounder.

I now have the confidence (albeit after watching the DVD 3 times) to discuss the ""Intent"" of the Constitution with unabashed confidence with people I consider to be intellectually superior to me. If the cartoon presentation was to capture the attention of Middle School pupils then I think it will be sucessful in that endevour.  If however, you expect to be visually entertained then I'm afraid you'll be a little disappointed. But if your goal is to be educated and informed about the writing of the great Document...

If you a expecting an action packed movie, along the lines of Ice Age, Fantasia, etc. You will not get that, this is a well made DOCUMENTARY. The budget may have been low, but the content is exceptional. The film brings an insight to the writing and ratifying of The Constitution that has been neglected to be taught in our schools, to the detriment of this country, in my humble opinion. Most people can honestly say they don't know who George Mason was, you will know after watching this film. And Patrick Henry, possibly the central character, or at least the favorite. Most are only aware of Henry saying, ""give me liberty, or give me death"" This movie has historical context of the great Patrick Henry and his eloquent words. The artwork is wonderful and the content is incredible. I know my family and I will have to watch this a number of times to soak it all in. I am encouraging my daughters teacher at school to get a copy also. I highly recommend this film to anyone.",1272153600,,1129,4.458937198067633

It is so refreshing to see that such an amazing story could be drawn from sources that are largely free and open to the public.  This is the definitive history for conservatives and ""little 'r'"" rebublicans must be familiar with in order to be legitimate.  I bought 2 DVD/ 3 CD sets and mailed one to my Dad.

3952118,5,B002MAG7F8,"I am an amateur historian and a back stage pass member of Mike Church web site. I bought all the audio and the Special Edition DVD of these historical productions. This is the first one that includes animation. It is not a slick, Hollywood big budget animation production, but it is very well done and is a lot more likely to hold the attention of younger students. In its target audience of junior to senior high schoolers, it is a way to slip hard core History into a Saturday morning cartoon motife. I know that Mike has a special for teachers and schools, and there is emerging anecdotal evidence that this is being stealthily adopted and put to use in many schools in diverse geographical locations. I know that Mike Church took a great financial risk to fund the prodution of these fine historical re-enactments, and I think he has a winner on his hands. With several accompanying songs and videos going viral on You Tube, I hope Mike is able to make enough out of his investment to go back and do the same animation approach to his two audio re-enactments, the Fame of Our Fathers and The Road to Independence. I know I would be willing to buy DVD releases of these two, and I believe he could do just as well or better than he has with this DVD release.",1266969600,,1261,4.416309012875536

I know that there is probably people out there that thought that it would be more appropriate to have had this done as a motion picture but Mike Church financed this movie with his own money.  More importantly is the content of the film; this docudrama gives you a REAL understanding of what went on during that time that is backed up with research into the actual transcripts of that time.

This movie focused on the point of revealing the founders discussions and thoughts of the proposed Virgina and New Jersey plans and the unltimate product of the Constitution. While not full of glossy special effects that many expect of a modern movie the actors role in presenting the voices and intensity of their founding father role is impresive. While previous Hollywood attempts at this subject focused on the men and their character none have approached the ideals held by the founders like this work. Most profound is the presentation of Patrick Henry who is historically forgoten about after he made his ""give me liberty or give me death"" speech of 1775. The role of Patrick Henry here can not be over emphisised, as his comments on the Constitutional Convention and the Constitution itself are the culmination point of this great work.

It will explain what the true intent of the Constitution is, from the founders own notes. Yes the people that were unhappy with the graphics must understand that not every person doing a documentary get hand outs from someone to create a movie and that makes it even better. Plus if you don't like the graphics close your eyes and listen to the story we all know what most of the founders look like.

3952129,5,B002MAG7F8,"I reviewed the original version and recently had a chance to view the Special Edition.
 I still feel distracted by the video,this is more a concentration problem, though I think the artistic work is excellent and for the budget a masterpiece I can not watch and listen intently. This is not a problem as I prefer audio over video anyway.
The updated and added sound and content are wonderful.
  I think Mr. Church did an excellent job in directing and unlike the other reviewer I believe all the voice talents were superb,in fact if they sounded different in real life I would be disappointed.
  I did not expect a pixar type animation and truth be told would be more distracted from what I find to be the true value,in the language. I have ""listened"" to the movie almost a dozen times picking up every sound and speech given. I especially like how he weaves his daughters into the whole movie giving it a warmer less documentary feel. They were superb,dare I say outshining The Dude himself.
  I still hold to my previous review,except I think this version would be worth three times the amount and SHOULD be required for high school.
 This is a wonderful movie and would make a super gift for anyone looking for answers to our political system,not just relying on cliff note style text books and the mass media.
  I have owned the older copy since Oct.'09  and viewed the SE version and I can only hope Mr. Church does more. It sheds new light on the cries of getting rid of partisan politics( these guys argued everything and disagreed much!) and what should or should not be mandated by our federal government.

This type of stuff has long, long ago been removed from the curricula of our public schools to the detriment of our society.  Far too many of today's citizens are ignorant of the principles that our country was founded upon.
This movie deserves to be seen by all Americans over the age of 10. Mr. Church should be commended for the public service he has done in making this vitally important piece of American history available in a form that is not only entertaining but educational as well.

After watching this DVD, you will know more than most people that graduate from some of our most prestigious educational institutions.

For an added bonus.  Get a copy of Mike's first two documentaries; The Road to Independence and The Fame of Our Fathers.  Both are audio only but well worth the listen.  Also get the audio version of The Spirit of '76.  It is about an hour longer but is worth the extra time.  Use it as an excuse to go for a long drive with the family.

I am adding to my initial review after receiving and watching the Final version.  The newest version has consists of a DVD that has a run time of aprox. 90 mins and a DVD that has the original version that runs aprox 2.5 hours.  For those who have younger viewers or may not know much about the writing and ratification, the 90 minute version would be great to get the basics and the second will give you more information as well as some additional entertainment.  This final version also has something extra that wasn't included in any previous edition and that is bonus features.

This documentary tells a true story that is no longer told in the realm of public education.  The material and the production of the audio CDs as well as the DVD is great.  The only reason why I gave it four stars is because the mouths don't really move in the movie and at times make it difficult to figure out who is talking.  I'm assuming this was a budget thing.  Other than that I thought for a low budget documentary (relatively speaking as compared to Hollywood) Mr. Church did a fantastic job and I highly recommend it for any free thinkers that believe in America and the freedom and liberties provided to us from our founding fathers.

3952153,5,B002MAG7F8,"First, I agree wholeheartedly with Brutus' review.  This film is an astounding achievement for an upstart film company.  The 5.1 audio mix is expertly layered, and draws you into the action (soundtrack was originally basic stereo as an audio-only documentary).  Animation is presented as moving illustrations, and they are beautifully drawn with an artist's hand - and based on historical paintings and sketches of our Founding Fathers.  By far the MOST amazing part of this film is the story itself.  Mr. Church spent months researching and writing the audio documentary, going back to the source (the personal notes, letters, and memoirs from the men inside the debate halls) for the great bulk of the material.  What he learned was so amazing that he financed, produced, wrote, directed, acted in, mixed audio, to bring this film to life.  The story which unfolds may shock you, but it IS historical fact.

1. The Constitutional Convention of 1787 was convened under false pretense, ostensibly to amend the Articles of Confederation.
2. James Madison was not the Father of the Constitution, his plan called for a central government similar to England's.
3. The Federalists were actually nationalists, and wanted to eliminate state sovereignty.
4. The republicans (not the modern GOP) were against ratification.  They considered each State a separate Country.
5. The Constitution may not have been ratified by Virginia and New York had rapid and secure communication existed at the time.

Patrick Henry's speech from the Virginia Ratification debate steals the show.  His defense of liberty was one for the ages and has never been committed to film until now.  History buffs rejoice!",1261008000,4,1685,5.2

This man has transformed my life.  His works are made of the stuff we all want to learn about,the truth about our country's origins and the people who shaped it.  Our founding fathers were brilliant people with a mastery of the english language and the Spirit of 76 gives you the very essence of how they conveyed their thoughts and passion for freedom and liberty in an everyday life setting.

3952159,5,B002MAG7F8,"This compilation of Audio CD and DVD movie is quite possibly the most accurate telling of the trials and tribulations leading to the greatest charter ever to be forged for a nation.  The U.S. Constitution.

In spite of Obama's view of the Constitution where he claims its ""flawed"" and a ""charter of negative liberties""... The Framers clearly were attempting to prevent exactly what our current president is trying to do.  There were those among the Framers that wanted what Obama is attempting to deliver... a NATIONAL Government, but there were those that wanted a limited FEDERAL Government.  Mike Church's effort in telling this story makes clear the delineation between the two, and how the true ""Federalists"" won in the end and by its telling, makes stark why we need to return to that foundation.

This is a riveting documentary and exciting to listen too.

Recently, my wife and I attended the Army/Navy game in Philadelphia.  As part of our trip.  We listened to the ""Spirit of 76"" during the two hour trip.  Prior to going to the stadium, we had lunch at the City Tavern, the ""home away from home"" for the Framers when they were not going about the affairs of building a nation, but they did discuss those affairs privately there.  Mike mentions the discussions that went on at City Tavern, and you can't help but feel their presence when walking through history in such a place.  Talking to the waiter about the documentary, he pointed to a room across the way and said, ""Oh yes, they met in that room over there""... While we were sitting in the room that was the ballroom for George Washington on the eve of his Inauguration as president... I still get goosebumps.. :) (By the way, the food is fantastic! Recipes from the colonial period)

If you want to teach your children the true history of this nation's founding... this is the documentary to do it.  You'll be surprised the difference between what actually happened vs. what they are being taught in school today.

Mr. Church is an exceptionally likable and intelligent man in his role as narrator, and his daughters are wonderful, kids anyone would be proud to call their own.

I can only wish that the idea would catch on and a major production would be made for television or the big screen with similar subject matter.",1397347200,,545,4.540816326530612

I popped it in that afternoon at the in-laws place where we where having dinner just for a few minutes fully intending to watch about 30 minutes then go back to helping in the kitchen and then have a few drinks with everyone and enjoy the day. This did not happen. By the 20 minute mark I had everyone camped out in the TV room watching the show. Everyone from Grandma and Grandpa to a handful of 7 and 8 year old where watching, everyone getting something out of it. The little ones just plain love anything in a cartoon and us adults where sucked into the story, the history and the ideas. Needless to say it has sparked a lot of good debate in the family and all in a good way. My family comes from all over the political spectrum but the historical record being presented here has given everyone food for thought. I am so glad it did and over the past year it has been referenced many times during family get togethers. Admittedly I am a Libertarian and reformed Neo-Con. It has been a long road on this journey and I have tried many things to get my family to ""take the Founder's Red pill"" this movie has done more than all the arguing and debate ever could. You just can't argue fact. You can disagree with the ideas and the principle but the fact remains unchanged. This film was a great production and beautifully but together. It flowed nicely and was never boring and dull like so many documentaries. The cartoon animation was OK but not great and that was obviously a reflection of the budget but beyond that there is nothing I can find negative about it. I hope that you get this for your special someone that is a history buff or just wants to crystalize there understanding of the Founding Fathers original intent.",1382659200,,1813,4.366863905325443
8373754,5,B002MAG7F8,"Spirit of 76 is yet another of Mike Church's great blends of entertaining history.  It is the kind of video/audio that can remove the drab background noise of a car trip or a rainy day.  The story is a focus upon the context of personalities, debates, and results of the origin of the republic.  You feel as though you are in the room with the Founders.  It is a natural companion to the other Mike Church edutainment works, Fame of Our Fathers, and Road to Independence.  You will not be disappointed.",1362009600,,502,4.472527472527473
8373755,3,B002MAG7F8,"From a pure historical point of view, I really enjoyed this movie.  Using the words of our Founders was very powerful.  The problem I have with this movie is the constant political input Church adds to the movie.  I bought this with hopes of showing it in my classroom, but with all of the political statements against Obama, this is impossible.  As a teacher, I am supposed to remain unbiased.  I am a Conservative, but I go to great lengths to remain unbiased and teach the students to think for themselves.  I give them the evidence and facts and allow them to come to their own conclusion.  This movie does exactly what I get upset with other teachers for doing, TELLING us what to think rather than allowing us to come to our own logical conclusions.

Without the added commentary by Church, this would be shown in my classroom for years to come, but as it is......There is no way.  If you're like me, and you like to remain unbiased as you can, offering facts, evidence and proof to allow your students the ability to think on their own, this isn't the movie you're looking for.  If you don't mind this, you won't be disappointed at all.",1355702400,,1143,4.478260869565218
8373756,5,B002MAG7F8,"This video was wonderful.  I wish public (aka government) schools would really teach about the founding of this country and liberty.  Unfortunately, that will never happen.  I enjoyed the entire production.  I do listen to Mr Church on the radio and I wish he would attract a wider audience.  The acting is good.  If you like special effects and gratuitous sex then this is not for you.  If you like a REAL story then you NEED to buy this.",1343952000,,439,4.481012658227848
