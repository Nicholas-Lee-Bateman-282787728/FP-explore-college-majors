8034865,3,B0002YLCPQ,"This is a well cast and well produced movie - I would not have thought it a telemovie but for Grady Harp's informative review from 2005. I think the cast works very well with what is a fairly predictable script - Lambert Wilson overplays his hand wildly, as does his dear old mum - and Adrien Aumont is just right as Dimitri - I could watch him all day.
Early in the piece I thought Maitre Aumont was going to give us a taste of Gregoire Colin in Olivier Olivier - but no such luck - the movie remained fairly pedestrian.  But it does have a budget, and some fine actors as well.

I think this movie rates three and a half stars.  No Special Features to speak of.  English subtitles are good.",1300320000,,692,4.180451127819549
8034866,4,B0002YLCPQ,"Le Divin enfant (HOLY CHILD) is a French made for television little film, written by Jean-Luc Goossens and directed by St&eacute;phane Clavier, that is part of a series of films collectively titled 'Tales from the Orphanage', a series which opens the door to both the randy rowdiness of young boy orphans as well as the tender, needy emotions of children who land in collectives for one reason or the other.  The constant seems to be the need for discovery of each child's roots or at least a return to the family so desperately needed for a child's maturing. In that way this series is both entertaining and touching.

THE HOLY CHILD focuses on one boy Dimitri (Adrien Aumont) who while somewhat of a malcontent in his orphanage longs for a life outside.  He sees a priest on the television P&egrave;re Marc Aubrey (Lambert Wilson), a priest well know in the media for his celebration of the benefits of chastity before marriage, and immediately identifies him from a saved photograph of him with his mother Martine (Agathe Teyssier), now in prison.  Dmitri leaves the orphanage and appears in the church where P&egrave;re Marc is officiating in Mass.  Dressed as an acolyte he confronts P&egrave;re Marc with the fact that Dmitri is his son. P&egrave;re Marc is chagrined: how will this affect his public image of a bastion for chastity?  Dmitri pleads his  homelessness and P&egrave;re Marc takes him home where Pere Marc's mother Mamitta (Marthe Villalonga) immediately offers her heart.  P&egrave;re Marc at last confesses to Dmitri that on the day before he took his vows of chastity as a priest he slept with Martine and agrees that he is indeed Dmitri's father.  The two agree to keep the fact a secret, Dmitri lives with P&egrave;re Marc and Mamitta and gradually the parish takes Dmitri into its fold.

When P&egrave;re Marc informs his bishop of his fatherhood, compounded by his rather recent indiscretion with Marie (Diane D'Assigny) with whom he sleeps after a confessional deal to keep Marie from spreading the truth about P&egrave;re Marc, the situation comes to a climax - leave the priesthood or stay.  That decision molds the ending of the film.

Yes, it is a slight story, and yes, it moves in directions obvious form the start, but the cast is good and Lambert Wilson has a fine sense of comic timing that keeps the story on course.

There is enough said about the current state of the Catholic Church's social and political stances to make it a palatable satire.  It has its charms.  Grady Harp, July 05",1122163200,12,2525,4.825986078886311
