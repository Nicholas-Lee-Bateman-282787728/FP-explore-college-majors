8633031,2,B002WOLG3C,It explains how babies develope but does not give much advice on how to help them develope. The production value is poor where the sound cuts in and out. There is one scene where there is dog poop on the floor next to the baby which was the high moment for the video. A ten minute introduction was not needed but they had to make it longer. They put in a lot of work but it needed better production value and more tips that can be applied to ones baby. The title is misleading.,1371254400,,477,4.085106382978723
