7360049,5,B013323CM4,"If you enjoy costume drama/mystery you will love this.  Miss Fisher is probably more theatrical than a lady sleuth might have been in the late 1920's in Australia but it is still fun.  I first saw this series on TV, then borrowed it later from my local library, and now now bought the BluRay to watch whenever.  By the way, my husband enjoys watching it with me - could it be that Essie Davis is such a great actress in this role ( she certainly is a knockout to look at as well)?",1522368000,,480,4.139784946236559

7360056,5,B013323CM4,"She's smart.  She's sexy.  She's wily and sophisticated.  She's also a kinda-sorta private investigator without a license, but whose instincts are a benefit to a begrudged police captain and his faithful sergeant.

The scripts are brilliant.  The production is superb.  The direction, the acting, the detailed scenery of a more distinguished era, and cinematography are magnificent.  The theme music is strikingly beautiful, and the incidental music actually adds to the drama.

The Blu-ray edition does not disappoint.  Image and sound are bright, colorful and crystal clear.",1520294400,,576,5.604651162790698

7360058,5,B013323CM4,Miss Fisher ... What a character!!,1520294400,,34,4.833333333333333
7360059,5,B013323CM4,"What a Great Romp!  I saw this series for the first time by borrowing it from the library, and I was happily surprised.  Based on the books in the Mystery Series of the same name, Essie Davis perfectly embodies the joie de vivre of the Phryne Fisher (Lady Detective) character.  She is at once, bold, brash, funny, compassionate, vulnerable, courageous, amorous, irreverent and sophisticated.  The time period of the late 1920s is beautifully and lavishly rendered -- Phryne's wardrobe, alone, is a joy to see.  While the show has a nice, balanced intersection of murder mystery and it's tongue-in-cheek approach to aspects of each episode, I felt it stayed mostly on course to be more amusing than campy.  The character of Chief Inspector, Jack Robinson, is performed with some highly-skilled, subtle nuances by Nathan Page.  While Jack's character is fairly secondary in the books, in the TV series, the increased focus on him as a ""partner in crime"" (forgive the pun) and growing love interest for Phryne only adds to the entertainment, as does their witty repartee.  The supporting cast is equally enjoyable and charming, and their characters are well fleshed out.  If you like a lot of fun with your murder mysteries, this is a great series for that!  In fact, the world-wide enjoyment of and interest in this series has resulted in over $700,000 in public donations to help fund the making of a Miss Fisher Murder Mystery movie.  So, one more story about Phryne Fisher to look forward to.",1520208000,,1494,4.888888888888889

Being attached to British/Australian telly programs and movies, I started watching episodes on PBS and got totally hooked from the getgo.

7360109,5,B013323CM4,"This delightful and entertaining mystery drama made its debut on Australia's ABC-TV in 2012. Based on Kerry Greenwood's novels, the series follows the adventures of Phryne Fisher, a 1920's English heiress, and her devoted companion, Dorothy. Essie Davis is marvelous as the self-assured and free-thinking Phryne, who engages merrily in a number of torrid one-night affairs when she's not otherwise solving murders. While all the production values are generally excellent, the standout feature must be Phryne's stunning wardrobe. It is said her costumes have inspired numerous 1920s look-alike parties. If you enjoy good mysteries in stylish settings with colorful characters aplenty, then this clever series will surely satisfy. My wife and I have watched this series many times and have discovered something new and entertaining with each viewing. Highly recommended!",1506729600,,868,5.684615384615385

Although it's set in Australia in the late 1920s, the social issues and loss of loved ones in a war are still relevant today.

The attention to detail in the clothing is so well done I have as much fun looking at the clothing and surroundings as I do watching the stories presented. Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries is a delight. I highly recommend the series on Blu-ray so you can appreciate and enjoy all the effort that went into these period rich presentations. You will love the characters and their relationships to one another.

7360143,5,B013323CM4,Love the style of this show. The 1920's costuming is fantastic. Her outfits are exquisite! The period sets are excellent. The story line is varied and entertaining.  The characters are all likable. Miss Fisher has spunk and panache. If you are sick of all the blood & guts on prime time TV check out this series. Quality entertainment for adults. After watching the entire series on PBS we bought the DVD's. Another series you may like is called MURDOCK Mysteries. It's filmed in Canada where as this one is in Australia. Also a period piece from the turn of the century. Great costuming & acting in that one too.

I loved the relationship between her and Jack. Seeing Dot grow into her own woman was great but I got a real kick out of Bert and Cec. All the cast worked so well together. Hopefully they will make a new series (season) as they said they'd be open to doing. There were only 34 to this series and I just have to know what happens next for Phryne and Jack!",1498608000,,523,4.188118811881188
7360150,5,B013323CM4,"I love this show! Especially the music. And the visuals, and characters. And the story lines. A local PBS station airs it. But their schedule conflicts with mine, and anyway, it'd be nicer to get into the 1920s Melbourne atmosphere any time I feel like it.

My only complaint is that this Blu-ray version's audio has a problem with audio balance. Often the music or sound effects are so loud that I can't hear the voices. Subtitles become necessary. Also, there's a slight reverb added to the soundtrack which can be irritating. I don't understand why anyone would want to do this to such a beautiful soundtrack. It's not there in the version that PBS airs, and I'm sure about this because I use the same amplifier and earphones for both. I don't know if the DVD is the same, but whoever mixed this Blu-Ray version needs to go back to mixing school. It's not the settings in my Cyberlink software. I've checked.

Anyway, it's a unique, well-written, beautifully photographed show, with music that reflects or is from the Roaring 20s, but has all the full audio fidelity of modern days, plus an irritating reverb, in this case.",1498435200,7,1126,4.681818181818182

She's a beauty of the highest calibre who carries a gold-plated pistol, climbs the sides of buildings to investigate crimes, and drives a Hispano Suiza sports car that is a dazzler.  All the Miss Fisher mysteries are well crafted and with locations and sets that are true to the period.  Her outfits and accessories are the epitome of high-fashion of the 1920's.

7360198,5,B013323CM4,"I first discovered Phryne Fisher on Netflix. I liked the characters and stories so much that I bought the entire series on DVD, just in case my Apple TV box ever blows up. Then, after watching all three seasons twice in the space of a single year, I noticed a line in the credits: ""Based on the novels by Kerry Greenwood."" ""There are Phryne Fisher novels!"", I thought, and went immediately to amazon.com and ordered ten of them from various vendors. (I have already read five of them.)

As far as the quality of the vendors merchandise is concerned, all of the books were in excellent condition.  Most arrived later than I am accustomed to, but that is because I am an amazon prime member, and I ordered several of the books from non-amazon vendors to take advantage of the lower prices.  In summary, then, I love ""Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries""  and I have been delighted with every delivery system (i.e., Netflix, DVDs, and books) that has made them available to me.",1486512000,4,969,4.616279069767442

7360202,5,B013323CM4,"I am catching this on Netflix. It was recommended to me because I watch Bones and Murder, She Wrote.
I hate to say it, but I love this show more than pizza. And as a fat girl, I take pizza seriously. It is set back in the 20s and the costumes are amazing! The way everyone is dressed just gives me something to look forward to every time I watch. I am only on episode 4, but I can't wait to find out the answers to some of the mysteries that are ""long-term"". I can't wait to hear more about her family and her sister's death. It makes me anxious, but hell, that's life.

I would recommend this show for anyone who enjoyed (s) Murder, She Wrote, or such shows. It has some nudity and sex in it, so not for small children to watch. Some blood but not as graphic as shows like CSI. Miss. Fisher is more risky than Jessica Fletcher, but just as entertaining! The side characters are great too. Dot is my favorite mouse and A Butler named Mr. Butler! Fantastic! Love it. And she lives on Baker Street! that's just a great nod to the master of mystery.",1485907200,,1046,4.152709359605911

Almost every U.K. series I have ever watched offer  A+ actors, sets and storylines with great writing.  I hope that this Australian production never gets re-made in the states as I have noticed  the U.S. usually sexes everything up while sacrificing the quality of acting, sets and dialogue.

7360262,5,B013323CM4,"6-star MARVELOUS. Crime. Glamor.  Mystery. Action. 1929 sets -locations- costumes -props, all the Bees Knees. Worth 6-stars from day one. Series 1 = 13 episodes, as does series 2, then 8 more for the 3rd season. 34 episodes and loads of bonus stuff. All Aussie, as is the production, more flair than Outback stereotype, with abundant sub-plots, suspense, & humor. Deco-delicious! Self-indulgent flapper Miss Fisher and her world are Hotsy-Totsy. Nifty! Kerry Greenwood, who's novels are adapted, calls this TV series ""Perfect"". Worth more than 5-stars, like Poirot, Downton Abbey, and Midsomer Murders. Ritzy 1920s Jazz tunes included.

Phryne (pronounced Fry-nee) spiffily played by Essie Davis (Girl with a Pearl Earring) is a PI, assisting local cops with her golden pistol, Bond-like, and a celestial action heroine--naughty. Cops are DI Jack (Nathan Page) and Constable Hugh (Hugo Johnstone-Burt -`Cloudstreet'). Other cast: Dot (Ashleigh Cummings), butler Mr. Butler (Richard Bligh), Bert (Travis McMahon) & Cec (Anthony Sharpe), and the morgues Dr Mac (Tammy Macintosh).

I did the math.
New, bought individually on this date was $93 assuming free shipping; used $70 with required shipping cost; making the asking $80 price a bargain. Every episode is worth the $$$, and worth watching multiple times.",1469750400,,1308,5.465346534653466

7360265,5,B013323CM4,I have really enjoyed Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries.  Pryne is really so ahead of her time.  Great example of how society viewed women and their roles at the time.  You have the very liberal Miss Fisher and her very conservative assistant who work so well together. the characters from all walks of life blend together and work great as a team.  The stories are varied and have good story lines.  I recommend Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries to anyone who is looking for something different.  The sets are awesome and Pryne's outfits are just great.  A great glimpse of society at the time.,1469145600,31,589,4.715686274509804

7360267,5,B013323CM4,"We LOVED this series, and have recommended it to many friends who also think it is great. All of the ""period details""...costumes, cars, scenery, etc...are excellent. We loved the characters from the first episode, but think the ""mysteries"" themselves were much improved in series 2 and 3. The bonus features on the DVDs are as enjoyable as the actual episodes. Our only regret is that it was all over too soon! We didn't realize that only three series had been filmed, and there has been no commitment for a fourth series. However, the stories and characters were so enjoyable that we will surely watch them all over again...once we get our DVDs back from those to whom we loaned them!",1468713600,,685,4.716666666666667

She's definitely her own woman, but without diminishing anyone else.  The acting on the series is excellent and the mysteries varied.  Not as crazy about the ongoing theme about her sister in series 1, but still loved the series overall.  Series 2 was even better.

All of the characters are well developed and well acted  but nothing compares to Essie Davis as Miss Fisher she is simply fabulous in this role!

But to the contrary, I have found it to be most entertaining and somewhat mind altering.  Writing suburb,  acting perfection, suspense exact and background perfect.  My highest applause to the directors, actors, and producers. Although somewhat fanciful the series allows us to escape our mandarin world to escape into another which seems to  process more beauty and excitement. As you my guess, I completely enjoyed this entertainment experience.  P.S. I remain committed to my Catholic values.",1532304000,,647,5.242718446601942
