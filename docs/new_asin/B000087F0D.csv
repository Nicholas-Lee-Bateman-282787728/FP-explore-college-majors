7979281,1,B000087F0D,"Alexander seems competent enough himself, but there's a precious few techniques demonstrated and those just from one camera angle. Production values are amateurish. Far superior are the Cool Rain aikido videos. Also, Tanemura Shoto has a much more interesting video offering.",1149897600,2,275,5.7317073170731705
7979282,5,B000087F0D,This is by far my favorite martial arts instructional video. The instructor presents this art in a way that anyone can understand. Very clear and easy to understand. I would recommend this video to anyone who wants to be able to defend themselves regardless of age or physical ability.,1091750400,,285,4.836734693877551
7979283,5,B000087F0D,"I've recently seen this DVD and I highly recommend it  to anyone interested in authentic Japanese Jujitsu. The DVD provides a good cross-section of stand-up techniques, ground-fighting and self-defense. I've incorporated much of this info into my own martial arts training. This is definitely one of the better instructional DVDs on Jujitsu. The techniques are explained clearly and are highly effective. Great Work! I give it 5 stars!",1083283200,2,435,5.397058823529412
7979284,5,B000087F0D,I studied jujitsu for a year and loved it but moved to an area where there are no local schools teaching jujitsu so I am taking karate and self defense . The technical information in this dvd is so clearly explained that my friends and I are using it as a additional training tool. It has enhanced my karate training and helped immensley in my self defense tactics. I recommend this dvd highly and give it five stars.,1076976000,2,417,4.358974358974359
7979285,1,B000087F0D,"This DVD will disappoint anyone with any JJ experience.  The Sensei, George Alexander, is clearly a bully and applies various locks and holds on his students who all yell while tapping to get George to release a hold - which he does painfully slowly, and often immediately reapplies to get a second or even third tap.  On one occasion one of the students hurts a shoulder while obediently getting thrown and George says ""come on"" as if nothing has happened.  On another, George starts immitating his students by putting on a whinning voice and pretending to ask a stupid question.  There are few techniques shown that would work in a real life fight, unless your opponent is a totally compliant in the way of George'students. I am big fan of Pride, UFC, KOTC and the various other fight DVDs.  I have now built up a large collection of DVDs and videos with about 700 fights on tape.  unfortunately I have to say that this DVD ranks as the worst I have bought.  The disappointment is made worse by the fact that the price is way too high for the one hour of instruction.  The Renzo Gracie/Kukuk DVDs are MUCH better value for money and have much better lessons therein.  I am selling my DVD on amazon after one viewing with a bargain price, but I advise you not to buy it.",1074988800,11,1271,4.467532467532467
