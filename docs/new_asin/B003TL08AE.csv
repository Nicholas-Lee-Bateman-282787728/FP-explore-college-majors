8405192,3,B003TL08AE,excellent movie but to short. running time should have been posted,1445472000,,66,5.090909090909091
8405193,5,B003TL08AE,"I can only review the soundtrack, which I bought as a limited edition Record Store Day 2014 release from Death Waltz Recording. In a nutshell - superb! The eerie soundscape is told through many different ""treated"" instruments and sounds, and reaches very shrill highs and deep, dark, brooding lows. I am all the more intrigued to watch this short now, but sadly Netflix does not seem to have it available. Guess I'll have to pick up the DVD from here!",1400803200,,451,4.65
8405194,5,B003TL08AE,This is a great short film that should be made into a feature.  The soundtrack is fantastic and sets the mood perfectly for this stellar little short.  Great film making.,1399420800,,170,4.633333333333334
8405195,1,B003TL08AE,"This is nothing but a short .Misty plays a terribly mistreated wife who is about to have a baby. I often wonder why such material is produced as it has no redeaming social value. To take out Misty and kill her off in a brutal fashion and then take the pregnant body and place it behind the drywall to me is nothng but the product of a sick mind. Misty s short role shows that she can act ,something that we all know. The end of the movie had an ""alien "" twist to it so we have no new ideas presented here.
All in all it rates a no star rating.",1316304000,,543,3.857142857142857
