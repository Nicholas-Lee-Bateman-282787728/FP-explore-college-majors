7799012,5,1577420772,"A fun follow-up to the original ""Frog"" movie.  It's goofy and good-natured, with Shelly Duvall, Elliott Gould, Scott Grimes, Amy Lynne and Paul Williams as Gus.",1508889600,,160,5.153846153846154
7799013,1,1577420772,"Tape editing takes away from the story line, very poorly done. I have the original version which is much better. Don' t by this one.",1359849600,,132,4.32
7799014,3,1577420772,"First, don't watch this movie until you have watched ""Frog;"" it will make no sense. This sequel is at times bizarre, and sometimes a little environmentally preachy, but still clever as a family film. I didn't see this movie until I was past 16, so it doesn't hold the fuzzy place in my heart that the first one did, but it does, in my opinion, round out the story line in a satisfying way. Occasionally Arlo's (the main character) inexplicable foray into preppiness is aggravating, but he eventually gets back in touch with his inner science geek (as I personally felt he must). There's also something innately amusing about watching a teenager run around town with a middle-aged lounge singer... While this movie is tragically missing the song ""That's Amore,"" the music sung by the frog prince is still classically Italian. This film is for anyone who loved the first movie, likes talking frogs, or likes to see the geeks win. Though the characters are at the end of highschool, I doubt most highschoolers will want to watch this; it's probably generally best for a pre-teen audience.",1177286400,,1085,4.807486631016043
7799015,4,1577420772,Unfortunately the two reviews already written have nothing to do with this funny and quirky movie that was a delight to watch with my kids. The story line was familiar but with enough twists to make it interesting. The scene in the biology lab is especially rib-tickling. Obviously not the horror flick (you can tell from the video cover photo).,1015977600,,345,4.766666666666667
