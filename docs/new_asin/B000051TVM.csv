1388043,4,B000051TVM,"Enjoy this whimsical story showing Van Gogh transported into modern time to get a second chance.  What he discovers is that his art is highly valued and since he never sold a painting in his lifetime, he seeks to reclaim his work and in the process falls in love! Lots of fun esp. watching Sally Kirkland as a relentless detective seeking to bust this mental case who believes he is truly Van Gogh!",982022400,5,398,4.4520547945205475
1388044,5,B000051TVM,"This movie, as they used to say, is quite ""a trip"" -- innocent but ironic, simple but poignant in message, lulling and teasing -- and all told with a big wink.  How much have we all changed since a century ago when Vincent van Gogh was rejected, scorned and dismissed?  Not much.  When he comes back today, the media (journalists and newsmen), lawyers and judges, art critics, even art educators try to dismiss him all over again, considering him a ""con-man.""  But this is no ""Harold Hill"" of the MUSIC MAN who tried to con River City into buying instruments for a Boys Band.  This is the real Vincent -- and like any working man, he wants to get paid... it's been a century and he comes back from death to just TRY to get his check from the greedy chiselers who hoarde his artwork.  A low-budget, independent film that makes up in charm what it lacks in production sophistication, with some very funny performances.",981763200,5,916,4.5212121212121215
1388045,1,B000051TVM,"I think that this film proves, if anything, that anybody can convince others to fund any screenplay.  So in a sense I suppose this film offers hope to filmmakers everywhere.

1388048,5,B000051TVM,"One of the most magical movies about Vincent Van Gogh is Starry Night. For anyone who admires the artist, the story will make you wish it all was true, that Vincent came back to vindicate the wrongs done him in his life. Not with vengence but with a neat twist on awaking the world to the plight of ""starving artists."" Anyway. It's a really cool movie. One of those hidden gems that often get overlooked. Definitely worth viewing again and again. Oh, and ""Starry Night"" is the theme song and Josh Groban did a wonderful rendition of it on at least one of his albums. Beautiful.",1414368000,2,577,4.452830188679245
1388049,3,B000051TVM,"This film is a total fantasy, and a bit silly at times, but it kept my interest.

1388052,5,B000051TVM,"My 5 star rating for this movie isn't based on it being an intentionally good movie. In fact the movie is so terrible it is fantastic! The unintentional comedy level is off the charts. The budget honestly couldn't have been more than a few hundred dollars. The premise, script, & acting are so beyond absurd that it's awesome. Views like a production of community theater. Complete w/ police name tags accidentally upside down - & lines you'll never ever forget - ""Its the flowers Kathy ...

1388055,5,B000051TVM,"Why this movie does not have more press is beyond me!!!! If you love the art of VAN GOGH you will simply love this movie, I did. TRUE IT IS A FANTASY, still you do wonder that if it were true would VAN GOGH be distressed. YOU BET YOUR VAN GOGH HE WOULD!!!! Buy this dvd, see for yourself if I am not right. P.S.

1388056,5,B000051TVM,"This romantic comedy fantasy is a must-have completion to my video collection, since it crosses over my three favorite genres: romantic comedy, time travel fantasy, and Van Gogh. Lt. Murphy makes such a rich nemesis for the small cadre of friends who pack a powerful punch to the elite world of art collectors. Thought light and humorous, the film challenges our assumptions about art and carries some thought-provoking messsages woven into it.",1223078400,4,444,5.180555555555555
1388057,4,B000051TVM,"If you teach art grades 5-7 this is a video to have. It's a fun, corny, silly, movie about Van Gogh coming back from the dead into the 21st century!  I was amazed at how much the kids enjoyed it and really were able to pull on our studies of Van Gogh.  I would have it on the shelf for a rainy day.  The only negative is that there is one very short scene where there is a nude model in a painting class...it is a quick clip, but you can fast forward through it and the kids will never know.  This has to be the only reason it got a PG-13 rating. Preview it first.",1207008000,2,564,3.836206896551724
1388058,2,B000051TVM,"Van Gogh wearing eyeliner, and delivering some of the worst movie lines ever in an accent that ocillates between an obscure Transylvanian dialect and slurred Irish.  Good Times.  Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but certainly one of the most ridiculous.",1104883200,4,256,5.071428571428571
1388059,4,B000051TVM,"I've seen all the ""serious"" Van Gogh movies extant as he is one of my very favorite painters.  It would be silly to try and compare this movie to any of them as it has a very different aim. This is a very whimsical fairy tale based on the idea of what would happen if Vincent came back.  What would he think of the prices that his art now goes for?  What would he think of the buyers of his work?  Would he ally himself with starving artists needing the help he needed in his own lifetime?  I found these very provocative questions and the movie examines how Vincent would answer those questions if he had 100 days to live again in modern day LA.

Don McLean sings his ode to Vincent over the credits and that is very nice too.  I'm sure this was shot on a shoestring budget but that adds to its rather offbeat charm. I'm an artist and that may have influenced my liking of this film.  An art collector might not like this film much though as Vincent does not think much of them (which is fairly consistent with his view in his own time). If you have Van Gogh high up on a pedestal, I would advise you to skip this movie.  There is nothing exalted about this movie at all and that's why I liked it.

1388060,4,B000051TVM,"This movie is really fun as long as you go into it with the right attitude.  The sets are cheap, there are some continuity problems, and the acting is really, really strange.  It's sort of like something you'd expect from a PBS-produced soap-opera documentary.  Some would call it bad--and I would agree if it was confined to one cast member--but it seems like the whole cast is in on the joke, and once you accept it, the movie is really quite interesting.  Don't expect your life to be changed, or your sense of aesthetics to be redefined, but settle down to enjoy a whimsical little movie with a really unique tone.",1036195200,11,618,4.54054054054054
1388061,1,B000051TVM,"This movie is absolutely the most awful movie I have ever seen, but the hysterical thing is that we rented it knowing that it would be a complete flop, based on its premise, and the description on the video.  It absolutely exceeded our worst expectations, in design, makeup, accents, acting, concept and cinematography.
Rent this only if you have a moral or aesthetic imperative, and only if it's in the 10c bin at your local movie store.",1035763200,,438,4.688311688311688

Can't believe the people out there slamming it with only
1 star--they are worse than the savage critics attacking
""Vincent's"" LA work....this film is a fantasy anyway, who cares if he wakes up in CALIFORNIA instead of his place of burial
in Europe....it's all about art and MADNESS and the intersections
in between...I thought this was a very cute ""indie"" film

1388063,2,B000051TVM,"I love Van Gogh. I love creative love stories. I love art in general. I love witty humor. This movie should've been easy for me to like.

My problem was I went into more seriously. This is closer to camp. Fans of Young Frankenstein might enjoy. Entirely different movie but similar humor.

If you saw the Vincent Van Gogh Dr. Who episode, you'll find similarities, though less depressing.

The plot is predictable. Vincent comes back to life in modern America (Los Angeles) and has to process how he's seen 100 years after he died. He meets new artists and runs into some trouble stealing his own paintings.

7929586,5,B000051TVM,"This is a very enjoyable and moving film if you are able to suspend disbelief for 100 minutes and overlook some plot holes and contrivances.

The premise is set up quickly in a brief scene before the opening credits. In 1885, a lady who recognizes Vincent Van Gogh's talent and humanity offers him a magic potion which will give him the ability to come back to life 100 years after his death. However, he will only be allowed to live for 100 days. She explains that 100 days is all he'll need to right the wrongs of the world that failed to appreciate him during his lifetime.

Right on schedule, Vincent Van Gogh returns to life in 1990 California, right in the middle of a parade in his honor, and he gets injured by being trampled by one of the floats. He's taken to a hospital, and notices a print of his ""Starry Night"" (his most famous painting) hanging on the wall of the hospital room! His roommate, a sleazy lawyer named Gabe Burton, has to explain to Vincent what a ""print"" is, as the technology for mass re-producing of art did not exist in Van Gogh's time. The part of lawyer Gabe Burton is played very well by an actor named Lou Wagner, in a performance reminiscent of Joe Pesci. The lawyer's TV ad (""Call 1-555-LET'S SUE"") is hilarious!

After being discharged from the hospital, he rescues a young artist named Cathy from an attack by a mugger, and subsequently befriends her. Although Vincent is always honest with her, it does not occur to him to immediately tell her his full name, so when she only knows his first name, she does not know he is the famous 19th century painter Vincent Van Gogh.

There is a great scene when Vincent Van Gogh attends an art class with Cathy, and creates a disruption by trying to set the record straight when the instructor makes a statement about Van Gogh's life that Van Gogh knows to be untrue! When he begins to insist his name is Vincent Van Gough, Cathy naturally doesn't believe him right away, but still sticks by him and eventually comes to accept that he is exactly who he says he is.

The other characters in the film are not so easily persuaded, even when some very strong evidence mounts in Vincent's favor!

Although flat broke, Vincent manages to obtain some art supplies and resumes painting again. However, now he is painting scenes of 1990's California! (The ""new"" Van Gough paintings seen in the film are very impressive; they are modern scenes done very faithfully in the style of Van Gogh!) Cathy persuades her aunt to fund a gallery displaying the new paintings of the man who claims to be Vincent Van Gogh. Vincent does a painting of a gang of Hell's Angels on motorcycles as a personal gift for Cathy's aunt, although she does not accept his claim of being who he claims to be.

Upon learning his old paintings are now worth millions of dollars, he sets out to take them back from various collectors. He reasons that this is not stealing, as he cannot steal what he considers rightfully his property. After Vincent snags his ""Starry Night"" painting from a collector, he donates it to the hospital he had stayed in as a means of trying to compensate them for the medical care he had received. He sets out to use money from the sales of his other old paintings to fund a charity for struggling artists like his friend Cathy.

The song ""Vincent"" (aka ""Starry Night"") by Don McLean is used as the film's theme song. Thank goodness the DVD retains this song, as the film would lose much of it's impact without it! (I say this because nowadays it is common for songs to be removed from home video versions of movies because the manufacturers either can't or won't pay the necessary royalties.) The song is heard in its entirety in the opening and closing credits, and excerpts are used to good effect at various points in the film. (The line ""Perhaps they'll listen now"" takes on a whole new meaning in the context of this film.)

Additional musical scoring by Brad Warnaar is excellent and up to the standard of the best Hollywood blockbusters. (This is worth noting because it's unusual for a low-budget independent production such as this to have such a fine score.)

Paul Davids wrote and directed, and he sure knows A LOT about Vincent Van Gogh! This film is not only a romantic fantasy; it is also a sincere and heartfelt tribute to the famous painter.

The DVD includes the following bonus features: a very interesting 20-minute ""Making of..."" documentary, a text biography of Vincent Van Gogh and commentary by writer-director Paul Davids. The movie seems to be available only in full-screen format, but does not appear to be cropped. It may have actually been shot in full-screen format.",1482451200,2,4663,4.592548076923077

(I kept wondering what Tim Burton might have done with the idea.)  Creaky mechanics for bringing back Vincent weren't help by some amateurish acting.  Too often writers, filmmakers and the like seem to feel that getting across their message justifies totally abandoning logical devlopment.  This also happens here.

This film on the surface is about VanGogh, but understanding just a little deeper brings the viewer to examine his own life, how he can reclaim and change his legacy. An original premise, Van Gogh come back to modern day Los Angeles a hundred years after his death and sees his paintings selling for millions.
And he meets his muse of sorts and begins to pain again.
Others have praised this film for it's photography, and its good.  But the real appeal of this film is it's challenge about what we leave behind.  Certainly a motivating film.",1426636800,,651,4.445378151260504
