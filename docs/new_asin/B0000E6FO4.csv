We found ourselves simply watching it quite amazed at how everything comes together. The best thing about it is knowing that you are given all the tools to enable you to play the same type of music. Being the ultimate beginner, having only taken a little music appreciation in elementary school, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I learned in the first half hour.",1316217600,,488,4.556818181818182
8002144,5,B0000E6FO4,"I have tried several times to learn the guitar. This DVD was recommended to me and I was blown away. There is an incredible amount of info on this and it is broken down into easily digestible chunks. I am still no Eddie Van Halen, but with this DVD I have way surpassed any of my previous efforts. Great product, highly recommended.",1190246400,4,332,4.370967741935484
