7796559,5,1565859677,"""Great Pharaohs of Ancient Egypt"", The Teaching Company (Great Courses), Virginia, 2004, ISBN: 1-56585-967-7.  DVDs with 57 pg. Guidebook, 212 pg. Lecture Transcript with 9 pg. Biblio., map, Timeline & suggested readings, questions to ponder, etc.

Professor of Egyptology, Bob Brier of Long Island University, is a well-published author who narrates 2 DVDs (circa 6 hours total) in a series of 12 scholarly lectures covering Narmer's unification of Egypt in 3150 B.C. to Death of the last Pharaoh Cleopatra in 30 B.C.  Brier's vantagae point as historian and permitted visitor to archeological sites not accessible to the public provides the reader a meticulous journey into the life and times of the Pharaohs, their subjects, customs, daily life, religion/beliefs, and progression of pyramid building.

Having personally spent a month (within this past year) exploring Egypt and the Nile from Alexandria to Aswan, I was pleasantly surpised to find I possessed so many misconceptions and voids of information - these were nicely clarified by this teaching course.  The DVD sound track and video quality is superb.  Unless current military tensions ease, visits to Egypt, especially those near Aswan and perhaps even to Cairo my become overly restrictive, ill-advised or non-existent.  The economy of Egypt is highly dependent on tourism, a country where Muslims account for over 90% of the peoples. It is said that unless you have visited Egypt, you have not really travelled.  It is recognized as the womb of civilization.",1187308800,10,1524,5.320833333333334
