7972036,5,B00006LSIQ,"I Lived in the UK for a few years and watched Gimme Gimme Gimme religiously.  Kathy Burke is one of the most talented comediennes I've ever seen.  She appeared in an episode of AbFab as a stodgy suit-wearing manager and on The Harry Enfield Show as many characters including a hormonally over active teenaged boy!  She's also been in a few movies such as 'Dancing at Lughnasa' and 'Once Upon a Time in the Midlands', but Gimme is her comic best.  The character of Linda with her screaming red hair, gaudy tight clothes and complete lack of social graces is a one of a kind that'll have you rolling on the floor with laughter.  I've been hopimg this would be released in Region 1 but I may have to just watch the Region 2 on my PC.  Be warned this show is NOT for the easily offended.",1153612800,4,783,4.292517006802721
7972037,5,B00006LSIQ,"I loved this series when it aired on BBC2 about 3 years ago and although it only ran to 3 series it was sorely missed.

It may be a bit 'rude' for an american audience but if you liked AbFab, Spaced, Coupling or Two pints of lager and a packet of crisps then watch this and be prepared to laugh!",1151539200,3,295,3.9166666666666665
