4955049,5,B0064YON8G,"I am so lucky to see this 3D movie on 24-Nov, the secondy of its debut!
It's a fantasy movie with a ""flavor"" of vintage european atmosphere in Paris(actually it's a little bit like London, cos the actors speak British English~~)
The story is based on real one of the first great movie master director Georges Mlis.
See the movie, especially in 3D form, it deserves applause!",1322179200,,374,4.597014925373134
4955050,4,B0064YON8G,"Martin Scorsese, with his portfolio of underworld epics, is not exactly your average fabulist, but his latest picture ""Hugo"" is the bittersweet fable of a broken man repaired by the devotion of a sensitive child. Scorsese's screenplay was written by John Logan, based on Brian Selznick's novel titled ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"", but as I have not read the novel I can't compare the two. The story as Logan and Scorsese present it concerns a young boy living in the Montparnesse railroad station who tends the clocks and watches over a strange automaton left to him by his father. The automaton is disabled and needs mechanical parts for which the boy is willing to steal. (It also requires a special key right out of ""The Secret Garden"".) In pilfering parts for the robot the boy is caught by an old man who runs a toy/candy concession in the train station, and it is their relationship which reveals the plot's secrets. It turns out that the concessionaire is none other than Georges Mlis, the master artist of the silent screen, who created ""Le Voyage dans la Lune"" and dozens of other films, many of which are lost. From this point on ""Hugo"" is half ethereal fantasy and half realistic history, but Scorsese balances the two halves well. In an interesting flashback Mlis tells how he began making his inventive films, enjoyed enormous popularity, but fell out of favor after the Great War. (The story seems to take place in the early 1930s; Mlis died in 1938.) Scorsese and his cinematographer Robert Richardson decided to film their picture in 3D, an amusement to which I have become immune -- my initial thrill of watching Vincent Price stalk Phyllis Kirk through those deep dark streets is long gone -- but there are some lovely effects here, including an aerial view of a snowy Paris and stunning interior shots of a crowded theater. This is not Scorsese's masterpiece by any means (that, I think, is ""Goodfellas""), but ""Hugo"" is an imaginative and intelligent adventure. By the way, some of the publicity includes a picture of the little boy in a Harold Lloyd type situation, implying that this is a kids' movie; but the first half is awfully talky, and the general mood is a little sophisticated for the average child.",1322179200,,2231,4.767441860465116
4955051,5,B0064YON8G,"I saw Martin Scorsese's wonderful film on the large screen in 3D (and the effects are terrific). A boy (Asa Butterfield) peers out through a clock at the goings-on in a railroad terminal in the 1930s. He is trying to survive by stealing food, but he's also trying to repair an automaton that his father (Jude Law) has brought home from the museum in which he works. The boy's life becomes intertwined with that of an old man (Ben Kingsley), who owns a toy shop, and his goddaughter (Chlo Grace Moretz). The boy also loves the films of the time and becomes interested in the first films, which were produced in France by the Lumire brothers and Georges Mlis at the turn of the twentieth century. The recreations of the efforts of these pioneers are breathtaking, as are examples of their films shown in Hugo. There are also great chase scenes--featuring Sacha Baron Cohen as a railroad station policeman--and some very good dream sequences. And the acting by Kingsley, Butterfield, and Moretz is superb.",1322092800,2,1002,4.764367816091954

4955054,4,B0064YON8G,"Good movie except for the typical Hollywood worldview: that people are just ""machines"" whose ""brokenness"" can be ""fixed"" by other people. No recognition of divine providence nor of any power higher than ourselves.  For this reason, I can only give it four stars rather than five.  On the upside, there was no foul language, violence, or sexuality.",1526688000,,347,5.0701754385964914

4955056,4,B0064YON8G,"The biggest shortcoming is probably the contrived plot, which relies on several coincidences. (The most obvious is the fact that Hugo gets caught stealing by Georges, who created a fabulous contraption decades earlier that Hugo just happens to be in possession of.) Also, the attempts at humor are pretty lame. When the man tries to pet the dog, you know exactly what is going to happen; when Sacha Baron Cohen stoops to sniff the flowers, you know exactly what is going to happen. Yawn. And Chloe Grace Moretz is far too twee. (Let's have an adventure! I love adventures!) Still, the story is entertaining, Kingsley's performance is great, and the cinematography is fantastic.

Yet, it's not one of those ""slice of life"" art house movies; it's a real adventure.

4955061,1,B0064YON8G,"The cinematography was beautiful, but the story was far too dark to be a suitable children's movie, as it is advertised to be. The history of early movies was very interesting but the character of Papa George was utterly unsympathetic.  His anger was self indulgent in equating the loss of his business and films as equal in impact to Hugo's loss of his father.  Papa Georg'se deliberate and cruel manipulation of  Hugo is unforgivable...allowing him to think that his last piece of his dad, the book has been returned, only instead to unwrap a pile of ashes. I could still almost cry thinking of it.  Papa George did not deserve any of the help and kindness Hugo showed him and I was left feeling very angry at the way the story played out.  Hugo certainly deserved better than to be taken into such a disfunctional environment.",1525219200,,829,4.6506849315068495
4955062,5,B0064YON8G,"Directed by Martin Scorsese, Hugo follows a young, orphaned boy in France on a journey to find his family. However, he does not find what he expected. Living in a railway station in Paris presents its struggles to an orphan with the Inspector constantly watching for thieves. Through a thieving circumstance, Hugo meets a girl ready for an adventure. They grow close as they search for a message from Hugos father and discover interesting facts that connect them to each other. In this film, the themes of friendship, family, and transformation are portrayed through the different aspects of filmmaking incorporated. Hugo represents an excellent film because of the exceptional acting, cinematography, and soundtrack.
 In Hugo, the actors portrayed the characters with emotion and a sense of authenticity, making the film incredible. Ben Kingsley expresses authenticity in his portrayal of Georges Mlis by clearly showing the audience the transformation that Mlis undergoes. By the end of the film, Kingsley exudes emotion as his character, Mlis, finally breaks down his walls and exposes his feelings, which clearly portrays the character development set in motion by the main character, Hugo. Also, Sacha Baron Cohen, who plays the Station Inspector, gives his character depth and emotion. At first, the Station Inspector seems harsh and uncaring, but, scene-by-scene, Cohen peels back each hard layer of this emotional man like an onion, giving depth to his character and the overall movie. Kingsley and Cohens brilliant acting make Hugo a film worth watching.
Hugo exemplifies a wholesome movie through the strategic cinematography. First, the cinematographer used aerial shots throughout, specifically Paris in the beginning of the movie. These shots force the viewer to take a step back and look at the whole picture and gain perspective of the film. In various scenes, the cinematographer included close-up shots. For example, they take a close-up shot when Georges Mlis flips through Hugos notebook. Each close-up shot adds intensity to the scene, which draws the viewer in. Through aerial and close-up shots, Hugos cinematography amplifies its excellence.
Accordion music and classical music comprise the soundtrack of Hugo, which gives the film an authentic feel and enhances the viewing experience. For many scenes, accordion music plays in the background, which typifies French music. This presents an authentic experience for the viewer as they virtually walk through Paris. Along with French-style tunes, the soundtrack in Hugo also incorporates classical music mingled with the accordion throughout. Depending on the scene, the classical music in the background enhances the overall feel such as suspense, sorrow, or joy. Therefore, Hugo has a realistic, experience-enhancing soundtrack, which makes it great to watch.
 Through the convincing acting, tactical cinematography, and authentic music, Hugo portrays an outstanding film. Hugo not only entertains the viewer with mystery and adventure but also teaches valuable lessons about love. This film attracts audiences of all age groups from children to adults. Children can appreciate the movie for the adventures and exciting cinematography. Adults, on the other hand, can understand the deeper themes of friendship and family intertwined in the film. Whatever the age, everyone should watch Hugo in order to experience a truly heart-warming film that teaches about the power of love.",1525219200,,3452,5.511320754716981

Hot Toasty Rag, December 11, 2017

While Martin Scorsess Hugo was a huge contender at the 2012 Oscars and took home five statuettes, the average audience member will come away from it thinking it was incredibly long and boring. What they don't know is the movie wasn't really made for the average person to appreciateit was made for those who care about film history and preservation. Although the main hype was to educate people on the importance of film preservation, that message will go over most peoples heads.

A little boy, Asa Butterfield, lives in a train station, and as he grieves for his father, he feels compelled to solve a mystery involving his late father and others he hasn't yet met. While this is the main plot of the story, its not executed very well. I saw this movie in the theaters, surrounded by lots of interested people, and hardly anyone could remember the key plot points once the film was over. The movie seems to bank on distracting the audience with very small parts by Sascha Baron Cohen, Emily Mortimer, Helen McCrory, Richard Griffiths, Christopher Lee, Jude Law, Ray Winstone, and Ben Kingsley. None of these people really advance the already thin story, but if they had, the story would have been infinitely more interesting.

By the time the old footage of silent movies is shown, audiences have most likely checked out and aren't paying attention. If you're in Hollywood or film school, youll think this is an essential movie that pays tribute to a wonderful era. If you're an average Joe, youll think you were ripped off by your ticket price.",1512950400,,1596,4.754512635379061

Hugo was one of those cinematic experiences I occasionally have in which I feel a need to pen a letter of apology once it was finished. As a young cinephile just getting my feet wet in film, I did what I thought we all were supposed to do; worship at the altar of Martin Scorsese. During my second Film Studies class, I struck a deal with my professor where he let me complete a career retrospective in place of making a short film for my final project. I was thrilled that my professor agreed to this deal, as writing a 60-page paper seemed like less of a daunting undertaking than operating a camera. I knew I was going to pick Martin Scorsese before I knew if my professor was going to let this happen or not. With his help, I watched every film Scorsese ever made from Who's That Knocking at My Door to Shutter Island. Not only did I see all of his full-length features but I also saw a great deal of his shorts and documentaries. It was supposed to be a cathartic experience of me getting as close as possible to the director I loved until it wasn't. That's not to say I didn't enjoy and appreciate many of Scorsese's films--I did, but I also learned that his enormous contribution to cinema didn't necessitate him being my favorite director. It's unfortunate that this project was one year too early to have Hugo included because once this project was complete, I tended to shy away from Scorsese films that came after, for a spell anyway. I missed seeing Hugo in the theatre, how could I have known I would have loved it so much and it would have been about one of my favorite cinematic subjects? Georges Mlis was one of my first cinematic idols, and he remains one today, as I am finally completely healed from my tattoo immortalizing his iconic image of the moon with a rocket that landed on its eye. I even attempted my own version of a shot-by-shot re-imagining of A Trip to the Moon, achieved by painting 146 individual canvas screens photographed to appear as though they move; an intensive labor of love that has never seen the light of day. Georges Mlis life being portrayed on screen would have been enough to get me to a theatre had I not been in such a Scorsese burn-out that I never even bothered to read what his 2011 film was about when Hugo hit theatres. Starring Ben Kingsley, Asa Butterfield, and Chlo Grace Moretz, Hugo is a brilliant spectacle that would make even the most devout skeptic believe in magic.

Based on the book The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick, Hugo follows an orphan boy who lives in the clock mechanism of the train station keeping the train clocks running so he can have a place to live undetected avoiding the orphanage. Still reeling from the death of his father, Hugo (Asa Butterfield) painstakingly works to repair an automaton (mechanical man) that his father instructed would only be complete with a unique key. Once Hugo finds the key, he will know what secret it contains and retrieves the last message his father sent him. While attempting to find the key, Hugo crosses paths with a shop owner Georges Mlis (Ben Kingsley) who believes him to be a thief. When Hugo meets Georges' goddaughter, Isabelle (Chlo Grace Moretz) who is always looking for an adventure, Hugo learns that their paths were destined to cross in ways he could have never imagined.

Hugo is one of the most beautiful films to look at that I have ever seen. Scorsese's outpouring of love to classic cinema and film preservation couldn't have tugged any harder on my heart strings if that had been the intention. Every single shot is gorgeous, capturing Scorsese's grand production design and exquisite colors. This is a film for us, for cinephiles, for the ones who don't feel the magic in any other setting than a dark theatre. Hugo is for the ones who dream in 16 millimeter and can't imagine a life without cinema. Hugo encompasses everything a cinephile feels in their heart when a film begins to roll, proving that ""the movies are our special place.""",1503705600,11,4047,4.571625344352617

The performances are terrific, especially from the young stars, and the supporting cast of veterans is top-notch. It's easy to see why this movie won the Academy award for cinematography and special effects, as both aspects of Hugo are dazzling.

4955144,5,B0064YON8G,"I love this movie. I went into it completely blind not knowing at all what to expect. I was hooked within a few moments and enjoyed it from start to finish.

This is a family movie but keep in mind its the type that really tugs at the heart strings near the end. So some parents may want to watch it first before having their kids watch it. Honestly I don't see why any kid shouldn't be able to handle it, but this is the world we live in.

Any way, the movie is fantastic. It sends you on a wondrous journey that ignites your imagination and all of your emotions. Kids will be amazed and adults will feel like kids again. It's so great to see movies like this that excite your imagination, and make you feel wonderful instead of focusing on cheap laughs and cheap thrills.

4955154,2,B0064YON8G,"I had high expectations going into watching Hugo, the movie adaptation of Brian Seltzers book The Invention of Hugo Cabret, which I reviewed yesterday. If you read my review, then you know I loved the book. Also, Im big fan of Chlo Grace Moretz who plays Isabelle. I was excited that shes in it.

The movie is a fairly faithful adaptation of the book, yet somehow manages to be really boring! Im not sure why either because the book is anything but. Maybe it loses something without all the wonderful illustrations?

The one major change from the book is that the Station Inspector has been changed from a dark, looming presence always one step behind Hugo, to an incompetent, bumbling idiot whose slapstick mistakes are supposed to be funny. Hes played by Sascha Baron Cohen, who I have always though is mostly annoying and not very funny. If you're a fan of his, then you may like this movie better than I did. Kids will probably like him since they are usually fans of physical comedy.

Hugo was nominated for and won a ton of Oscars but I think its telling that it wasn't nominated for any of the major awards, like acting or directing. It actually is probably a good family movie to power through for your kids sake but I wouldnt recommend it otherwise.",1485734400,,1258,4.557522123893805

4955162,4,B0064YON8G,"I'm surprised this film didn't do better at the box office.  It is truly a cinematic delight that works on many levels.  Children will enjoy the young characters and the story, and older viewers will catch the more subtle layers.  Film buffs will spot all sorts of well-researched goodies in there, including a poster for a ""Fantomas"" movie and a nightmare based on an actual train accident that occurred at another Parisian railway station at the time.  The story of the orphan Hugo, his friend Isabelle, and the automaton they salvage is all deftly woven into the true story of the re-discovery of Georges Melies, a magician who created many eye-popping short silent films at the turn of the century.  Like some fantastic clock, all these disparate pieces work together to form a coherent whole.  (For example, the people who work at/frequent the Metro all play their parts like clockwork - and their little stories-within-the-story are all classic silent movie plots!)

I had the good fortune to see this film in 3-D in theaters, and the effect is used to its fullest potential here.  If you don't have 3-D TV, you're still in for a treat; if you do, you're in for a bigger treat.

My one grievance is that there is no audio commentary track.  As a cinephile, I would very much have loved to hear Mr. Scorcese and/or a film historian discuss the minutiae of this richly detailed film.",1484265600,25,1387,4.717842323651452

I completely disagree that this isn't something we'd expect from Scorceseto me it makes perfect sense that he'd do a movie about the beauty of movies! From the opening shot of Paris as a giant cog in a machine to the final shot, Hugo pulls the viewer in with beautiful imagery and color that reaches right off the screenwhether you see it in 3D or not. There are elements of fantasy and reality woven into the storyline. Just like in life, many of the characters are broken people, incomplete and yearning to be ""fixed. However, the film's major theme is cinemathe birth, death, its beauty and importance of restoration both for lovers of film and for the (sometimes) forgotten filmmakers who blazed the trails for its place in human history. The film is never boring; these rich themes are always conveyed through brilliant metaphors and allegorical storytelling.

4955218,4,B0064YON8G,"Cinema, ever since the invention of motion picture cameras in the 1890s, has consistently played its role to merge the most absurd of fantasies in human imagination into real life through the wonders of technology. One of the dominant forms of art in the modern era, films of all genres have undergone significant development and changes in style and method of depiction, but the essential purpose of creating an overall experience the audience could easily immerse in and learn from remains. In the production of a captivating film, every factor, from the general setting to the smallest detail of cinematography, theme, and soundtrack, contributes to the ultimate goal of effectively incorporating the directors vision and message into the work, the things he expects the viewer to take away from watching it. Essentially drama played on the screen, movies narrating stories with entire, logical plots especially require such ingenious arrangements as testament to the capability of the director to bring fiction to life. American filmmaker Martin Scorseses historical adventure film Hugo displays just such an amazing example of how these qualities coordinate in a joint effort to present a pure, thoughtful crystallization of the shared dream of two persons, a child and an old man, each unaware of the others importance to his own life at the beginning and gradually discovering the transcending connection that ties them. Thus, Hugo, radiating with grace and honorable mindfulness in the presentation of its fantastical plot, which mainly involves the life of a most illustrious figure in the history of the film industry, definitely counts as a masterpiece in the genre.
Built up on the story of a twelve-year old orphan boy, the movie strikes at a delicate balance between the whimsical naivety of the world of childhood imagination and the bitter reality of a society beleaguered by the haunting memories of a Great War. Taking place in 1930s Paris, the narrative features Hugo Cabret, who has lost his father several years ago due to a conflagration accident and lives secretly in the walls of a railway station ever since. Accustomed to thieving spare parts at an elderly mans toy booth due to the need of sustaining the mechanism of the stations main clock, the protagonist gets caught one day while snatching some gears from the counter and subsequently loses his precious notebook, which Georges Melies, the eccentric shop owner, lays claim on. Hugo, then dismayed at the loss and desperate to retrieve the object, embarks on a series of adventures with the toymakers goddaughter, Isabelle, who has promised to help him. As the duos journey goes on, mysteries, mainly surrounding a particular hominoid machine, the automaton, and Melies ill-tempered response to Hugos plead, become unraveled; enlightened upon the discovery of the mystical wonders of the cinema, the boy decides to restore the old man to his former, complete self, for, just like the broken machinesthat cant do what they're meant to do, the grumpy toymaker has lost no less than the orphan did. Then, the plot, initially shrouded with a melancholy gloom, experiences a major upbeat in the overall mood, turning from a hazy, heartbreaking tale about a deprived child falling into the black pit of despair into a touching adventure of self-rediscovery and redemption. Apparently, Scorsese demonstrates his mastery of artistic expression and transition in Hugo, a fantastical work of tribute that brings the audience back into the early days of the film industry through a fictional story about an inspiring passage in pioneering cinema artist Georges Melies dramatic life.
From a technical aspect, understated acting, appropriate, smooth editing, and skillful cinematography all work in chorus to meet the expectations of the films possible audiences. Playing as protagonist Hugo Cabret, Asa Butterfield, thirteen-year old British actor during the production of Hugo, displays extraordinary catharses of emotion in a subtle and realistic style. For instance, when the mechanical hand of the completed automaton, with gears creaking, stops abruptly after scribbling a few incomprehensible, scattered letters, the boy, expressionless and shaken, launches a violent assault on empty bottles while shouting: Its broken! The whole thing is broken. Then, exemplifying the mentally deprived state of his character, Butterfield transitions that sudden rage into a series of low, reserved sobs, collapsing on the couch and muttering to an Isabelle who tries to comfort him: I thought if I could fix it, then I wouldnt be so alone. Genuine, vivid, and intensely emotional, Butterfields portrayal of Hugo contributes greatly to the authentic feel of the poor orphans struggles. Careful editing and the use of certain special effects, on the other hand, serves to capture and emphasize the whimsical mood and tone of the story as a whole; one example comes from a set of scenes depicting the protagonists dreams. In the first dream scene, the locomotive, having avoided crushing the boy sitting on the train rails, crashes into the platform and out of the arched windows of the station, the visual sensation of which a series of hand-held and aerial shots perfectly conveys. Obviously, the photography team of the film does a wonderful job in graphically tracing the horrendous path of the roaring machine, but the producers elevate the surreal nature of the accident into an even higher level through the transition into the next scene, where an abrupt close-up shot reveals an astonished Hugo in pajamas, apparently recovering from the shock of the nightmare. All factors combined, the production style of Hugo proves ideal to the majority of audiences, presumably of various age groups and critical tendencies, in these three significant criteria.
Dedicating Hugo to the memory of French filmmaker George Melies, director Martin Scorsese successfully incorporates the fantastical tale about an orphan boys adventure to fix the broken reality of a man and his creation into the broader appreciation of cinema and its history. One especially illustrative scene occurs at the film academy library, where Hugo and Isabelle skim the Invention of Dreams by Professor Rene Tabard and become amazed at the end as they see the signature George Melies under Le Voyage Dans La Lune, a movie making recurrent appearances in Hugo. Then, Scorsese renders his intention further evident through the very words of the author of this book: The filmmaker George Melies was one of the first to realize that films had the power to capture dreams. Introducing the theme of the transcending power of cinema, the modern director directly references the early passages of the movie industry and, more importantly, reveals the greatness of the French pioneer to the audience. Additionally, Professor Rene Tabard, one of the few contemporaries who have not forgotten the glorious achievement of Melies in the film, plays a key role in narrating the tale of his exhilarating childhood experience and how everything has changed after the Great War. Surveying his own collection of Melies relics as he leads the protagonists into his office, Tabard tells of his out of a dream encounter as a boy with the then celebrated artist in the studio, a designated flashback to intrigue the audience and reinforce the main message of Hugo. In the enthusiasts recount, the filmmaker, dressed up in his shining costume for a scene in the underwater palace, says: If youve ever wondered where your dreams come from, you look around; this is where they are made. Manifestly inserted to elevate the overall connection between the movies plot and the broad historical background concerning the life of Melies, this scene perfectly demonstrates the wondrous ability of the cinema camera to capture the whimsical fantasies of human beings, once exclusively seen in their dreams. Through the dramatic discovery and revelation of Papa Georges secret at the library, the film, while resolving the central mystery of the story, conveys the elevated message of the magical qualities of movies.
Therefore, an intriguing plot, first-rate production, and the respect it pays to the historical development of films and the specific contribution of a great filmmaker whose genius once became painfully ignored characterize Hugo as an outstanding work in the dramatic genre. Centered on the depiction of Hugo Cabrets innate struggles as he strives to decode the secret of the automaton, the story exhibits a curious mixture of fantasy and reality as two intermingling themes, both embodied in the essential moral of the narrative. Featuring the realistic and touching acting style of Asa Butterfield and naturally integrated visual effects, the movie exemplifies quality production and is worthy of praises on its appeal to audiences of different demographic groups. Martin Scorsese, while creating a piece that could inspire many interpretations in its own right, has accomplished his goal of crystallizing the common wonder of films, namely, that of capturing the dreams of mankind, into his message. With honorable intentions to present an artistic tribute to George Melies illustrious career and fascinating life story, Scorsese has elevated the essence of the film into one of historical importance and so proved his extraordinary motivation and talents as a director. Overall, Hugo, with its enchanting display of a blended style of fiction and reality, testifies to the ingenious mind and the inspiring heritage behind the tale of the boy and the automaton, qualities which an observing audience should justly appreciate.'",1464480000,,9642,5.298497713912475

I recommend watching Georges Melies' original film (not the colorized version with the horrible music) before viewing Hugo.  ""Trip to the Moon"" is very short, about 20  minutes, I think, and it will make Hugo more interesting.  Plus Ben Kingsley looks something like Melies.  Of course, Kingsley's chameleonic abilities are what make him a great actor.",1464134400,,431,5.014084507042254
4955221,5,B0064YON8G,"During Martin Scorseses film, Hugo, the main characterHugo Cabretdiscovers a dilemma as he states, Maybe that's why a broken machine always makes me a little sad, because it isn't able to do what it was meant to do... Maybe it's the same with people. If you lose your purpose... it's like you're broken (Scorsese).  These thought provoking words from Hugo, a twelve-year-old orphan, reflect a quest for meaning as old as time itself.  As with all major motion pictures, the amount of work that goes into making a story in someones head come to life is immense; however, the producers of Hugo successfully convey their message through an abundance of well executed film devices.  Through attention to cinematography, editing, soundtrack, and more, Scorsese tells an incredible story explaining how the world resembles one big machine and every person it contains has a distinct role to play.  In Hugo, a magical film about a boys quest to fix the broken and discover his role in the world, three main film devices make an impact on the audience in order to send a much needed message about the mechanics of purpose.
 Master storyteller Martin Scorsese takes his audience on an exciting journey as young Hugo struggles to find his place in the world.  This film takes place at a train station located in Paris, France, during the 1930s.  Oftentimes Hugo Cabret remembers his father who would take him to the movies, teach him how to fix things, and share adventures with him.  Before his passing, Hugos father shows his son a peculiar machine man that he calls an Automaton.  Unfortunately, his father dies in a tragic museum fire before the two can figure out how to fix the machine.  His drunken uncle takes Hugo in and puts him in charge of keeping the train station clocks running on time.  As far as Hugo knows, he could spend the rest of his life behind the walls of the station, greasing and tweaking and fixing the machinery; however, he continues to search for meaning in his life and in his fathers death.  From here on out, Hugos mission is to fix the Automaton with the help of his new friend, Isabelle, believing that the mechanical man holds a message from his father.  These two best friends get into trouble, go on marvelous adventures, and learn and important lesson about purpose together.
 Although this movie exhibits several beautifully executed film techniques, the cinematography, editing, and score stand out the most.  Cinematographers of Hugo capture the perspective of this film through an abundance of shots that allows the audience to view the world through Hugos eyes.  Oftentimes this occurs when Hugo would look into the busy train station through the numbers of the clocks.  This technique helps the audience relate to how big the world seems to Hugo and how lonely and small he feels in comparison.  Another technical aspect that stands out is the lighting.  During any shots in Hugos bedroom or behind the walls of the station, the lighting possesses a dark, blue tone.  Contrasting this, shots of the station always exude warm, lively tones.  Noticing the difference in atmosphere between Hugos surroundings and the bustling train station highlights his unfortunate situation and makes the audience feel sympathy for Hugo.  Lastly, the score makes an impact on the mood of this film.  Throughout the entire movie, many of the songs possess a distinct accordion in the background, adding to the somewhat mysterious Parisian mood.  Because of the cinematographic choices, lighting, and unique music, the producers of Hugo more effectively convey the desired mood and message.
 Using machinery to demonstrate their point, the directors and producers illustrate to viewers how everything holds a specific purpose.  Throughout the film, machines are heavily involved.  During the opening credits, the audience hears clocks or machinery ticking.  Hugo has dreams about machinery and lives surrounded by it. He shares with Isabelle, I'd imagine the whole world was one big machine. Machines never come with any extra parts, you know. They always come with the exact amount they need. So I figured, if the entire world was one big machine, I couldn't be an extra part. I had to be here for some reason. And that means you have to be here for some reason, too (Scorsese).  Wise beyond his years, Hugo points out that everyone inherently possesses a purpose because of the way he observes machines work.  Even in Hugos quest to find where he belongs, a machine guides him there.  In reference to the Automaton, Hugo says, I'm sorry, it's broken, to which the elderly Papa Georges replies, No it's not. It worked perfectly (Scorsese)!  Papa Georges implies that although the machine breaks physically, it serves its intended use well.  Through the consistent emphasis on and appraisal to machines, the producers effectively portray their message highlighting just how closely our lives resemble one of Hugos many contraptions.
 Scorseses Hugo effectively uses several film techniques in order to draw a parallel between machines and people, proving that everyone has significance.  Its editors, directors, and cinematographers do a wonderful job of complementing this message through lighting, music, and perspective.  While seemingly directed towards children, this movie can be enjoyed by everyone ages one to one hundred!  Not only does Hugo contain thrilling adventures, a bit of romance, and some devastating tragedy, it holds a great message for viewers about how everyone has a vital part to play in this machine of life.  In a day and age where children grow up wondering more and more if they even matter and seek answers to questions about their identity, this film appropriately addresses issues like loneliness, purpose, and family life.  Both the directors and producers of Hugo masterfully paint a picture of a twelve-year-old boy who simply wants to belong, a boy who eventually realizes that if you lose your purpose... it's like you're broken.",1463961600,,5983,5.047812817904374

It is a real treat to watch Christopher Lee as Monsieur Labisse, as Lee caps off his 65-year cinematic career. And as for the Georges Melies segment, we can imagine the thoughts running through the mind of Ben Kingsley as he played the creator of the medium in which he thrives. Scorsese masterfully develops the story from a very wide scope to its final laser-like focus. ""Hugo"" is a simple coming of age tale at its roots, flowering before its many new audiences, into its inviting and spectacular culture.

4955383,5,B0064YON8G,"There are some movies that are so good--that present a world so vividly imagined--that you want to live in them.  Hugo is one of these films.  It is a story about broken machines and broken people and the young orphan determined to fix them.  The title character is a young lad who lives in the walls of a Paris train station.  He keeps the clocks running in the station. He is also obsessed with a machine left to him by his late father, a machine which he believes holds an important message from his father.  To say more about the plot will spoil a good part of the film's enchantment.  Let me just add two disclaimers.  One, while the movie is based on a children's book, it is not a film intended solely for children.  In fact, I think the theme may be beyond the interest of a very young child.  Also, the film is not an action movie.  It is a movie that slowly gains your interest and by the end has you thoroughly entranced.  Asa Butterfield is fine as Hugo.  The supporting cast is phenomenal.  The story is beautifully  realized.  This is the perfect movie for a rainy weekend afternoon.  Fix yourself a cup of tea and settle in for very rewarding watch.  You won't regret it.",1444521600,7,1186,4.342465753424658

Come to find out, it's essentially Hollywood patting itself on the back for how creative it is. Suddenly all the positive reviews made sense. The film has nothing to do with the automaton, and everything to do with how happy we should be that there's such a thing as movies and we should THANK GOD for Scorsese et al that are out there making films for us. Throw in a bunch of Parisians that sound they just stepped off the train from London (except for the quite excellent Christopher Lee), and what sounds like an intriguing concept jolts you right out of suspended disbelief and into the Hollywood mutual admiration society. It gets two stars from me because Christopher Lee can actually do a French accent, and because it's not based off of a comic book.",1443139200,,904,4.552147239263804

4955415,5,B0064YON8G,"Here's a movie of striking mechanical detail and a story-line that is only slightly shy of perfect. Scorsese has indeed created a visual masterpiece, one of moving gears and gorgeous views aplenty. Asa Butterfield is perfect as Hugo. I particularly enjoyed the several short stories woven into the main fabric, giving additional texture to the whole. Sasha Baron Cohen is equally superb. And Ben Kingsley ... wonderful. This is just sit-back-and-enjoy magic, beginning to end.",1443052800,,476,5.36

The casting was perfect, consisted of both well-known and B-list Actors, which helped make the movie even more interesting as you became pulled further into the story.

I just loved the story, the animation, the filmography and the acting.  Jude Law's cameo, and Ben Kingsly's portrayal of George Mieler are perfectly casted.  If you like fantasy, a good story, and to be entertained, this is the film for you.  It is deep with out drowning you, entertaining without crassness and completely a joy to watch.

4955600,4,B0064YON8G,"Because I go to the movies almost every week, I see a lot of trailers.  It seemed as though I watched the preview for 2011's ""Hugo"" about 800 times before I finally saw the film.  The thing is, when I first saw the trailer, I thought it was going to be a children's fantasy.  It looked big and colorful, with children in the main roles.  Then I saw Martin Scorsese's name as director.  How could this be?  Scorsese doing a children's fantasy?  Well, stranger things have happened.  Didn't he do an M. Night Shyamalan-type thriller in ""Shutter Island"" just the year before?

Not to worry.  ""Hugo"" turns out not to be a children's fantasy, even if two young actors carry much of the picture.  And despite its exuberant trappings, the movie is decidedly not a fantasy.  It is, in fact, an affectionate tribute to moviemaking and the movie industry, a history lesson wrapped in a valentine.  And I wound up loving every minute of it.

Nevertheless, you do have to sort of get used to it as a Martin Scorsese film because it's like nothing the man has done before.  It's probably the first time that for him a movie's appearance dominates its content.  The primary thing one notices as the movie starts is not the characters or the story but the look.  Dante Ferretti's production design is so extravagant, so elaborate, so colorful and ornate, it rather overshadows everything else, at least for the first fifteen or twenty minutes until we come to know the characters.  But even then it's hard to concentrate on them with so much going on around them.

Since the movie is a paean to motion pictures and their early creative history, Scorsese uses every facet of modern filmmaking technology to tell his story, and that means using widescreen, color, 7.1 sound, digital photography, and 3-D.  Yes, he made the film in 3-D, although I resisted the urge to watch it that way in a theater.  I still feel 3-D dulls a film's color, and, besides, 3-D glasses don't fit comfortably over my eyeglasses.  Make no mistake, the regular 2-D theatrical experience was spectacular enough, and this Blu-ray edition retains much of the effect.  The point is that one can see throughout the film how Scorsese uses 3-D in almost every shot, starting with a lengthy chase employing oddball camera angles and point-of-view shots at every turn.  Initially, it may seem disconcerting until you remember that the director is merely showing off the technology.  He does settle into more subtle uses of the process as the film goes on.

Yes, I'll tell you in advance, the movie is sentimental; get over it.  And, yes, the movie emphasizes style over substance; live with it.

Anyway, based on the book ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"" by Brian Selznick, the storytellers set the film in the early 1930's, and it recounts the exploits of a boy of twelve or thirteen years, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield), who, since the death of his father (Jude Law), a clock maker, and the disappearance of his uncle (Ray Winstone), an alcoholic, has been living alone in the Montparnasse train station in Paris.  He's hidden himself out in the intricate mazes of the station's clock towers, afraid that if anyone finds him, they'll send him to an orphanage.  In this regard, he must definitely stay out of sight from the station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen), who was also an orphan and now delights in catching other abandoned children.

So, what's the plot about?  Actually, the story line is almost secondary to the plush tapestry of images, supporting characters, and human interest in the movie.  Nevertheless, the primary narrative concerns Hugo's attempts to restore an automaton, a mechanical man, that his father left him.  The father found it at a museum for which he worked, and he decided to bring it home as a restoration project for him and his son.  Hugo searches everywhere for the parts he needs and begins stealing them from an old man, George Melies (Ben Kingsley), who, with the help of his young goddaughter, Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), runs a toy shop in the station  When the old man catches Hugo thieving from him, the two slowly get to know one another, Melies putting Hugo to work in his shop.  Hugo and Isabelle become friends, of course, and together they begin an adventure not only to rebuild the automaton with the help of a heart-shaped key but to discover the truth about the old man.

If you know anything about the history of filmmaking, you already know the truth about George Melies, and, as though it really mattered, much of what we see on screen the filmmakers adapted not only from Sleznick's book but from real life.

The film's magic lies in how Scorsese reveals everything.  First, as I've said, he astonishes us with his visuals, especially the train station, a virtual city within a city, filled with shops and stalls and vendors of all sorts, continually suffused with the bustle and flow of the crowds that inhabit it.  It's quite a marvel to behold, as are the romanticized shots of Paris itself, its streets and apartments.  Second, there are the actors, from whom Scorsese elicits some of their best work.  The young people are fine, as we would hope, natural in their responses rather than awkward or precious, and Kingsley is always good.  But it's the peripheral characters that give the movie its richness.  Sacha Baron Cohen discloses previously unknown facets of his talent; rather than using his usual shock and awe as a substitute for humor (""Borat,"" ""Bruno""), he exhibits a genuine comic acting ability as the station inspector obsessed with tracking down orphans.  Then, there are the little sub-dramas:  The station inspector and the flower seller (Emily Mortimer) he fancies but is too shy to approach; the kindly bookseller (Christopher Lee) always ready to find a home for orphan books; Isabelle's godmother (Helen McCrory), afraid of her past; and the older couple (Frances de la Tour and Richard Griffiths) gently and quietly becoming better acquainted.  The movie is flush with such characterizations.

Scorsese composes each frame with the care of a master painter, giving every shot the appearance of a classic work of art.  Ultimately, ""Hugo"" is about the wizardry of movies ""to explore the power of dreams,"" a film that not only pays tribute to the splendors of filmmaking by talking about them but by demonstrating them.  As such, ""Hugo"" becomes a movie for film lovers of all ages.

The Academy nominated ""Hugo"" for eleven Oscars, including Best Picture and Director, the film winning five:  Best Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound Editing, Sound Mixing, and Visual Effects.

Video:
Appropriate to such a resplendent film, the Paramount video engineers give it their best possible high-definition transfer, using an MPEG-4/AVC encode and a dual-layer BD50 to capture all of the movie's grand images.  Needless to say, they retain most of the film's 1.85:1 theatrical aspect ratio (1.78:1), which fills every inch of a widescreen TV with glorious colors and contrasts.  Note, however, that Scorsese probably wanted much of the image to evoke a soft, wistful, misty-eyed look, no doubt helped along by the digital photography used.  Any softness you may notice is not the fault of the transfer; it's the way it looked in a theater.  The colors, soft or not, are brilliant and realistic, especially hard-to-capture facial hues; and detail is likewise reasonably natural and lifelike.  It is one of the most extravagantly rich films you're likely to see on Blu-ray and one of digital's best.

Audio:
Although Scorsese fills his soundtrack mostly with atmospheric background music, which the 7.1 lossless DTS-HD Master Audio handles easily, he also uses an abundance of subtle (and some not-so-subtle) surround noises.  The opening shot of gears turning and ticking in a huge clock sets the tone for the sound to come with its pinpoint, all-immersive aural characteristics.  And while there are not a lot of dramatic sonic effects, the ones we do hear are extremely effective.  The high quality of the sound makes the film as much fun to listen to as it is to watch.

Extras:
Disc one of this two-disc Blu-ray combo edition contains several worthwhile extras.  The first is a nineteen-minute featurette called ""Shoot the Moon:  The Making of Hugo,"" which gives us some behind-the-scenes info on the filmmaking.  The next is ""The Cinemagician, Georges Melies,"" about fifteen minutes on the film's subject, described as a ""modern inventor of storytelling.""  Following that is ""The Mechanical Man at the Heart of Hugo,"" thirteen minutes on the automaton in the movie, which, surprisingly, is not a CGI creation but a genuine automaton.  Then there is ""Big Effects, Small Scale,"" six minutes on one of the film's important special effects; and ""Sacha Baron Cohen:  Role of a Lifetime,"" three minutes with the comic actor in character.

The bonuses on disc one conclude with sixteen scene selections; bookmarks; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages and subtitles; English audio descriptions; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Disc two contains the film on DVD.  In addition, Paramount make the film available via an UltraViolet digital copy, downloadable from their Web site.  The two-disc set comes housed in a flimsy Eco-case, further enclosed in a handsomely embossed slipcover.

Parting Thoughts:

4955608,5,B0064YON8G,"All over the world, people seek happiness. They look for it in everything, including money, possessions, friends, and so on, but few ever seem to find it. Answering the question of the centuries, Hugo, directed by Martin Scorsese, demonstrates how a little boy, by chance, solves the mystery. In a train station in Paris, Hugo, a boy living in and maintaining the train station's clocks, sets out to discover a message that he believes his now-deceased father has left for him; he has little idea, however, how his effort will affect those around him. Portraying emotions of characters surprisingly accurately, this film will undoubtedly evoke a tear or two from its audience. Besides warming one's heart, the movie teaches important lessons in an effective way. By mixing lovable characters with skillful filmmaking, the movie successfully accomplishes its goal of teaching people of the joy that they will receive if they live their purposes.
 Unique in its story-line, Hugo is about a parentless child who lives to fix things. From the start of the film, Hugo attempts to repair an automaton, thinking that it will reveal a message from his father. To mend it, he steals pieces from a toymaker's shop, until he gets caught. The toymaker takes Hugo's notebook that contains diagrams of the robot and threatens to burn it, obviously upset about the notebook's contents. Overcoming obstacles and enlisting the help of the toymaker's god-daughter, Isabelle, Hugo finally completes his mission of fixing the automaton and sees the message that the robot provides. Not what he expected, the message creates a whole new mission for the boy who now has to find out what it means. In summary, the boy completes his first mission of fixing his mechanical man just to find himself caught up in an entirely new mission of deciphering what the automaton's message means.
 In addition to the gripping story, this film also boasts excellent acting, directing, and music that all work together to make an A+ movie. Almost all of the characters in the movie play realistic roles. For example, when the station master is about to begin a conversation with the flower lady, his leg brace squeaks; embarrassed, he decides against social interaction and disapointedly walks away. Outwardly appearing evil, the station inspector plays his role well, as he nonetheless garners sympathy from the audience by revealing his hurt and feeling of isolation. Additionally, the directing plays a big part in the movie's success. Deciding to create a few sub-plots, the director wraps them all up the way that the audience desires, producing an overall sense of happiness by the end of the movie. Lastly, the music does a wonderful job of setting the tone. Whether during a scene of suspense, joy, peace, or mystery, as in when Hugo first sees the automaton, the music successfully portrays the mood of the scene, ultimately guiding viewers through the entire movie. Therefore, the acting, directing, and music all harmonize together to provide an astounding film.
 Most importantly, the movie accomplishes its goal of teaching that a person's joy comes from living his or her purpose. As Hugo says in the movie, machines do not come with extra parts, so, if the world was one big machine, then [he] couldn't be an extra part (Hugo). The film successfully demonstrates its point by contrasting the attitudes of people living their purposes to those not. Although not a main character, the station inspector stands as a perfect example. While he constantly patrols the station, looking for little kids that he can send to the orphanage, he never exhibits contentment. However, once he abandons his cold-hearted ways, acts kindly toward Hugo, and befriends the flower lady, he displays nothing but pleasure. Similarly, Hugo, Isabelle, and the toymaker all exhibit gladness while living their dreams. In the end, then, the film achieves its goal of demonstrating that people will achieve happiness once they live as they were meant to.
 Overall, Hugo is a work of art. While all over the world people seek happiness in various places, this movie clearly demonstrates how to attain it. Because of its universal subject matter and lifelike characters, people from all age groups and demographics will feel a connection with at least one of the characters and ultimately fall in love with the movie. It ingeniously integrates lovable characters, realistic emotions, and a unique story-line to ultimately touch audiences' hearts. This movie stands as a must-see for all, as anybody will immediately claim it as a favorite. Thus, people should watch Hugo because of its excellent acting, filmmaking, and theme.",1433030400,,4673,5.104575163398692

The story never gets old no matter how many times I watch it on Netflix, so I figured I might as well just buy it for myself. I always leave feeling a little more cultured, even though it is based off a children's story. I'm not sure that I've actually seen another Martin Scorcese film, so that isn't what drew me to this - Actually, it was the music- It has a great soundtrack! It's so odd that it was so popular during awards season and just faded away, but I think it's a gem.",1429056000,,578,4.169642857142857

4955757,1,B0064YON8G,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The opening scene was too long and that should have been a sign. It dragged on and on, and most of the time I was frustrated at how things were such a big deal, but you never knew why. I literally was shouting, ""What is the BIG DEAL?"" as characters are flouncing around and making long meaningful glances or acting upset and this or that. If you've seen it, you know the point of the movie I'm talking about. The movie is pretty - the shots are well composed and the cinematography is great. The sound is also great but good God, the story - the story needed to be reworked even though it felt SO worked. The sequences that involved flashing back to the old picture films were cool and quite frankly, the story should have been about that. It should have been about a particular character and their memories of making films and what had happened to him and then ended the way it ended. He could have been sharing his memories with the boy at the train station for all I care. THAT would have been a better constructed plot. The boy is a good actor (I can't say the same for the girl), but I could have done without his story line in the film. It honestly drove me crazy and was so irritating. I debated often about just stopping the film. Everyone I know raves about it, but I couldn't believe just how much I truly disliked this film. That was genuinely shocking to me.

Simply too many characters that I didn't care about.  The character played by Ben Kingsley was supposed to be a man with a tragic past.  So grief stricken he had turned into an old curmudgeon and semi-recluse.  His past was hardly tragic when finally revealed.  More a man with a minor disappointment who was so spoiled and self-centered he made everyone else's life sheer misery.

4955843,5,B0064YON8G,"Hugo is a gorgeous storybook experience, best viewed in the intended 3D format. In short - I found the story intriguing and compelling, and the visuals from beginning to end absolutely stunning. I also feel that this is a benchmark 3D film to compare others to.

This film tells the stories of an orphaned boy (Hugo) and an old man (Georges), both broken by the pains of their past. In order to move forward they must discover how they are connected to each other. The backdrop is 1930s Paris, in a big train station they both work at. The overall story is robust, following not only the boy and the old man's journey, but also the supporting comic relief stories of the train station's residents; The station inspector who needs to soften his heart, A tea shop lady with a dog that drives off her admirers, and one of those admirers who never gives up, in spite of the protective dog. The film creates a feeling of storybook enchantment and though there are painful moments for Hugo and Georges, getting past those hard times is what its all about. The actors give their all, every one of them owned their role and made it real. Even the station inspector played by Sacha Baron Cohen, though the silliest character, gets the viewer to feel for him. There is another interesting character in the film but its not a person or an animal; it is The Movies and their history. Sure, some artistic license is taken to tell a story about our love of The Movies but the essence of that love is what comes across.

With 3D cinematography, the atmosphere of each scene is emphasized, not ignored; Jets and wisps of steam coming from hard-working pipes, dust motes floating in the air, and lightly falling snow are a few amazing examples. Looking to the bigger 3D picture of large, deep settings like the train station, these particles and elements make the illusion of place complete. What the viewer sees is a detailed look at a world from the past, given the polish and shine of fond memory, movie magic, and the depth of 3D camera work. Color is used to direct the viewer's eyes by making the main set-pieces lush and vivid, with more subdued tones in the surrounding scenery. Each scene is an illustration brought to life, with a touch of stylization making for the storybook feel.

I highly recommend an annual repeat viewing of Hugo. It recharges nostalgia, reminds us to keep a sense of wonder and even teaches us a little something about the earliest movies.",1422835200,4,2456,4.602739726027397

The 3D treatment and use were exactly what should have been used by many others who have not and consequently given 3D a somewhat bad reputation. 3D is a difficult medium in which to work and it takes real craftsmanship to do it well and not have everything popping into your lap just for effect.

4955958,5,B0064YON8G,"Knowing absolutely nothing of the film's premise before starting it, I very quickly decided that the film's old-world charm and careful pacing put me in mind of classic French films, and when Hugo's father talked of watching a film where they shot a rocket which hit the man in the moon in the eye, and it quickly dawned on me that whimsical silent film fantasy ""A Trip to the Moon"" was a heavy inspiration for the cinematography.

And that was only the beginning.

Beautiful locations, wonderful characters, flawless acting, and a strong sense of nostalgia complete the package quite beautifully. While not a film for most young children, those with vivid imaginations will be captivated, as will adults who haven't lost their own sense of wonder and whimsy.",1418342400,,759,4.921875

The reason is, I've waited to receive new earphones so that I could hear the great music as fully as I'll enjoy the amazing 3D imagery. But my Mother and sister both wanted to see what a 3D movie is like, so they came over to watch a few minutes each. So before I sit down and enjoy the whole flick, lemme tell you that even if it impossibly turns out to be a disappointing story, the characters, 3D scenery and cinematography, and music, will make it all totally worthwhile.

It is so interesting for one thing, take the viewer into a realm of life in the unseen world behind the scenes through the life of a boy without parents who must make it on his own.  It is a glimpse of dickensonian proportion.  The boy becomes the hero of his own life and the catalyst for the transformation of several other lives.  Ben Kingslly plays a wonderful protagonist as we sit on the edge of the seat waiting to see why. And how the boy will manage to escape the horrible policeman looking for orphans is a whole subplot of its own.",1417910400,,563,4.233644859813084

The period costumes lead us back in to simpler times.  The story line presents the disasters that happen in a subtle way so that young viewers will get the point without disturbing pictures of the events to haunt them in their dreams later on.  The characters are very interesting and diverse which helps the story line to develop and unfold leading one into the charm of this tale.  Although the ending is somewhat predictable, that conclusion isn't drawn too early on which leaves a delightful mysterious quality through over two thirds of the film.

4956163,2,B0064YON8G,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I decided to watch this for several reasons: Jude Law, Martin Scorcese, Sir Ben, and superlative reviews. At onset, I had great enthusiasm with the opening scene phasing into reality with sumptuous visuals and engaging, intricate set composition. This led me to believe wondrous adventure lies beneath, ala Harry Potter style. However, after a very short time, I was supremely disappointed in the plot, acting, and dialogue. Being long on patience for exposition, there was limited reward at film's end.

I actually fell asleep waiting for something interesting to happen. If only the Automaton could liven up more than once, I would have been pleased. Literally too much smoke and mirrors to my great annoyance.

Cohen's performance, a Peter Sellers wannabe, was exceedingly bad. Marty typically hires phenomenal talent, but this hack was the height of horror, scene after scene. Disheartening when I recall the very first home made Scorcese movie and loved even that simple effort.

I could not fathom a child being able to sit through this drivel although I found the history of film fascinating. This was the only redeeming feature of this effort which piqued my interest. I recently viewed a documentary on the debate of digital vs celluloid and appreciated Marty's input as very thoughtful and honest. It is unclear if that production was filmed prior to this project, but I highly recommend that he stick with his previous formula which has satisfied billions to date.

High recommend for introduction of pioneer George Melies' films, rich visual context, and to complete the catalog of Scorcese projects.",1412121600,,1654,5.156716417910448

No spoilers here.

Martin Scorcese has produced an amazing fantasy tale... or is it reality...?

Well, that's a good question. Often some of the best films are them that blend the two, and in so doing, create something magical. And the fact that this film ended up being quite different than I expected, and wonderfully so, makes it all the more beautiful.

The choice of actors was, as always with Scorcese, perfect. The cinematography was very beautiful. Even the use of CGI did not interfere with the story, as can be the case in some films.

Rent it, borrow it, buy it sight unseen. You will love it.",1411084800,,718,4.622047244094488

4956229,5,B0064YON8G,"Martin Scorcese is not well-known for making children's films. Although there are some sad parts to this one, please believe that the word 'Masterpiece' is not casually thrown around this work. This is the master story-teller's fine art being applied to yet ANOTHER master story-teller, in this case, Georges Melies. Melies was the first truly great film-director, nee-plus ultra, deluxe, extraordinaire. Artist and magician (first), Melies was the first 'set-designer','cinematographer', 'choreographer' and even special-
effects technician of his age and era.
  'Hugo' (Cabret) is an orphan boy living in the main railroad depot in Paris after his father is killed in a fire. But Georges Melies is a broken man, as the story begins. (His studios were abandoned during the first world war, and his films were melted down to make shoes). His young, teen-age daughter doesn't know who her father was, but she and the orphan boy Hugo start asking questions and putting together the pieces of this amazing puzzle. The other characters in this story are priceless as well, and your children should not be allowed to miss-out on this incredible film.

4956272,4,B0064YON8G,"There are so many words that can describe the new film from Oscar winner Martin
Scorsese: dazzling and spectacular come to mind. Critics and audiences agree for the
most part: the film is stunning, a winner, and must-see. And when you figure out what
the film is about, you know why the film industry would fall in love with it and will
likely lavish it with many, many awards. And I can agree with almost all of that. Almost.
Hugo is a film about pioneer filmmaker Georges Mlis. For a student of film, there is so
much to take in. The history, the folklore, the recreation of productions that breathe life
into those old reels. And certainly there is no better character study than Mlis (played
by Ben Kingsley). A magician, an entrepreneur, a visionary, Mlis made more than 500
films over his career. His most famous short, A Trip to the Moon, depicts a rocket ship
landing in the eye of the moon. To say his work was creative is an understatement. This
alone makes Hugo mandatory viewing for every film student.
Scorsese, certainly no slouch in filmmaking, creates a true sense of place with textures
and colors that are beautiful. He truly depicts what must have been such energy and
passion for the new art form that was early cinema. But for those not so interested in film
history, perhaps this story is so much media on media. Do common folk really care to
see a reporter talking about how a certain news story was covered by a certain
newspaper? So it is the redeeming value of focusing on Mlis that perhaps leaves this
film open to criticism.
You will see this film at the Oscars no doubtand much deserved. The industry loves
when one of its own gives homage to its roots with such a spectacular work. But Ill
stopped short of calling Hugo a masterpiece, and while it had many moving moments it
didnt move me deep down (and I wish it had). I know, I know, this is all blasphemy
from a guy who runs the film festival in townand one who makes movies at that! I was
inspired somewhat by Mlis life and passion for his work, his creativity and drive. It
made me want to ramp up on my own productions that have been languishing for lack of
time (or as most indie filmmakers will cry about: funds).
You shouldnt miss the spectacle of color and brilliant cinematography of Hugo on the
big screen. But when you're done, catch some of Mlis work as well; youll have richer
insights into what made this man so passionate about his work.",1408406400,,2434,4.459641255605381

Andrews Blu-ray Review: ""The movies are our special place."" So says the pensive, 12-year-old title character in 'HUGO,' and though most of us who go to films blithely share this simple sentiment, director Martin Scorsese brilliantly and perceptively shows us why. His beguiling ode to the magic of cinema and the sense of wonder and community the art form inspires ranks as one of the director's greatest achievements, and that's saying something! Flashy yet subtle, grand yet understated, 'HUGO' brought tears to my eyes, not because of any emotional plot development, but because this heart-warming film celebrates with grace and lyricism the personal connection we all have with film, and the important, intimate role it plays in all of our lives.

No other director could express these ideas more simply and with more potency than Scorsese, who infuses 'HUGO' with an uncharacteristic yet utterly charming warmth and innocence that augments its power and makes it resonate. And no other film encapsulates the essence of Martin Scorsese, who he is and what he does better than 'HUGO,' which ties together the director's passion for motion pictures, spawned from a lonely, challenging childhood, much like Hugo's and his intense commitment to the cause of film preservation. 'HUGO' may start out as a tale of both an orphaned boy searching for a home and a bitter old man at war with the past, but it becomes a story about all of us and how films collectively bond us through dreams. With ceaseless urgency, almost all humans strive to connect with someone or something and it is in our DNA and Martin Scorsese depicts how film often satisfies that innate, burning need, and consequently brings us joy.

Based on the Caldecott Medal winning novel by Brian Selznick, 'HUGO' chronicles the wide-eyed adventures of Hugo Cabret [Asa Butterfield], a young, penniless French boy who lives alone in the clock tower of a Paris train depot after his father dies and his guardian uncle goes off on a bender. Hugo leads a hand-to-mouth existence, swiping croissants and milk from station vendors, and stealing toys from a booth run by an austere elderly man [Sir Ben Kingsley]. Hugo deconstructs the toys and uses some of the parts to repair an automaton that is a primitive robot, that his father, a clockmaker, purchased from a museum and the two worked on together. One day, the toy dealer catches Hugo red-handed and, as punishment, forces him to relinquish his prized notebook that contains diagrams outlining the automaton's mechanisms.

In an attempt to reclaim the notebook, Hugo comes in contact with the toy dealer's goddaughter, Isabelle [Chlo Grace Moretz], and the two embark on a voyage of discovery, each exposing the other to unexplored wonders. Isabelle opens Hugo's eyes to the world of books, while Hugo introduces Isabelle to films. In an odd coincidence, Isabelle, quite literally, holds the key to the automaton, which in turn sheds light on the true avocation of her godfather, Georges Mlis, who they discover was a once-famous filmmaker. Georges Mlis, who's now forgotten, depressed, and impoverished, forms a tenuous bond with Hugo, who tries to help him, while continually evading the clutches of the tyrannical station inspector [Sacha Baron Cohen], who relishes sending stray children to the city orphanage. Though he is adept at fixing things, can Hugo repair the shambles of his own life, and restore the reputation and self-esteem of Georges Mlis, and in so doing, indirectly heal the crippled station inspector, who feels like half a man? It's a tall order, but Hugo, with the films and the automaton on his side, proves he is up to the task.

There's a Dickensian air about the characters of 'HUGO,' especially the plucky urchin who's reminiscent of Oliver Twist that lends the film additional charm. Though many of the minor figures, a flower peddler Lisette [Emily Mortimer], caf owner Madame Emile [Frances de la Tour], bumbling patron Monsieur Frick [Richard Griffiths], suspicious bookseller Monsieur Labisse [Sir Christopher Lee], and Hugo's gruff, drunken uncle Claude Cabret [Ray Winstone] only play marginal roles, they're essential cogs in the film's wheel, and Scorsese treats them with respect. And in a further homage to the great films of old, we often witness their actions through Hugo's peering eyes, a sort of homage to Alfred Hitchcock's 'Rear Window.' Martin Scorsese also beautifully incorporates into the story sequences where Hugo himself views on film, such as the comedian Harold Lloyd swinging from the hands of a clock tower, and tips his hat to Georges Mlis, by giving some shots, like the Paris skyline, a fantastical, animated look.

Just as Georges Mlis was an innovator in the early 20th century, Scorsese breaks ground today with his keen use of 3D, bringing what many still regard as a flamboyant, commercial fad into mainstream film making. Never a distraction, and the 3D images in 'HUGO' unfolds naturally as a part of the story, enhancing impact and providing delicate shadings, while the more overt effects salute the showmanship of Georges Mlis by adding a whimsical playfulness to certain scenes. In the film, 'HUGO' it explains it is the essence of magic, and 3D, when employed judiciously, can be a vital aspect of the spell celluloid weaves. Martin Scorsese, in his infinite wisdom, recognizes that, and Georges Mlis would have appreciated his perspective.

And anyone who truly appreciates classic beautiful films and what they do and say, and that is the care with which they're often made, and how they make us feel and make us fall in love with 'HUGO' and that is the reason why it received 11 Academy Awards nominations and won five OSCARS. And though, it's a shame Martin Scorsese himself didn't take home a gold statuette, he doesn't need the award to validate this amazing work. As Isabelle says in the film, ""Thank you for the film today, it was a gift."" And 'HUGO' is Martin Scorsese's gift to those of us who cherish films. With respect, reverence, and a boyish enthusiasm that will never leave him, Martin Scorsese shows us that film was a magical, wondrous entity 100 years ago and it still is today.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Breath-taking is perhaps the best way to describe this reference quality transfer from Entertainment in Video, and this often jaw-dropping beautiful 1080p encoded image effort showcases all those elements to perfection, while transforming the 3D presentation from gimmick to art form in the blink of an eye. The opening shot of the Paris skyline glistens like a newly minted penny, and sets the tone for the entire film. The pristine source material is practically devoid of grain, yet the image never loses its warmth and lushness, even during scenes that heavily rely on CGI effects. Clarity and contrast are exceptional, be sure and catch the reflection of the clock in Sir Ben Kingsley's eye, and colours pop, thanks to marvellously modulated saturation. The bright blue of the station inspector's uniform, the flowers in Lisette's cart and the tinting on Georges Mlis's films and all these possess an intoxicating vibrancy and lushness. Black levels are deep and inky, shadow detail is very good, and flesh tones remain stable and true throughout. The textures of fabrics are easily discernible, as are background details, and though a faint bit of shimmer afflict a couple of patterns, the intricate designs on many costumes stay rock solid. Razor sharp close-ups accent the distinguishable facial features of the varied cast, including the automaton, which looks almost human. The inspired use of 3D, however, sends this film into the stratosphere. Seamlessly integrated into the film and astonishingly well defined, the 3D imagery takes us inside Hugo's world and into the captivating realm of cinema like no other picture I've seen before. And the effects are even more stunning in the home environment than in a theatre. The sense of depth and openness the 3D provides is truly amazing, as Hugo peers through bars, windows, and the through the hands of the clock. Various perspectives are heightened and spatial boundaries blurred, so we feel a part of the action. Details like snow, ash, steam, mist, and fireworks gently dance before us; a swinging pendulum cuts through the screen; the glistening snout of a growling Doberman Pinscher protrudes forward; sheets of paper float before our eyes; and in my favourite dimensional shot, the Station Inspector slowly leans forward, lunging further and further and further and still further into the room, making his intimidating presence not just known, but felt, and making us recoil just a tad in response. Martin Scorsese also adds a hint of 3D to the inspired use of the 3D itself to even greater effect, and sends this film into the stratosphere heights that seamlessly has been integrated into the film and is astonishingly well defined, and the 3D imagery takes us inside Hugo's world and into the captivating realm of cinema like no other film I've seen before. And the effects are even more stunning in the home cinema set-up environment than it was in the cinema. The sense of depth and openness the 3D provides is truly amazing, as Hugo peers through bars, windows, and the through the hands of the clock. Various perspectives are heightened and spatial boundaries blurred, so we feel a part of the action. Details like snow, ash, steam, mist, and fireworks gently dance before us; a swinging pendulum cuts through the screen; the glistening snout of a growling Doberman Pinscher protrudes forward; sheets of paper float before our eyes; and, in my favourite dimensional shot, the Station Inspector slowly leans forward, lunging further and further and further and still further into the room, making his intimidating presence not just known, but felt, and making us recoil just a tad in response. Martin Scorsese also adds some 3D effects to Georges Mlis's 'A Trip to the Moon' to make it even more magical. For someone who has never before waded into 3D waters, Martin Scorsese possesses a surprising mastery of the concept, knowing when to push limits and when to pull back. As much as the form dazzles and thrills me, I still find it hard not to regard 3D as some sort of trick or gimmick, but 'HUGO' comes closer than any other film I've seen to using 3D as an artistic tool rather than a commercial draw. Aside from the aforementioned brief shimmers, no imperfections mar this exceptional transfer. No noise, banding, pixilation, or edge enhancement rears their ugly heads. Not everyone may be enthralled by the story of Hugo Cabret, but it's impossible not to be blown away by this impeccable 3D treatment that's truly a visual feast.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Along with the reference quality video transfer comes a reference quality 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track that's stunning in its clarity, precision, and level of detail. 'Hugo' possesses a rich audio fabric, juggling big moments and delicate nuances, yet all the sound is distinct, perfectly balanced, and awash in superior fidelity and fine tonal depth. From the opening frames, featuring the rhythmic interlocking of mechanical gears exquisitely apportioned among all the room's speakers, it's evident we're in for an aural treat, and the track never backs down over the course of the film. Superior dynamic range handles screeching highs and low rumbles with ease, and nary a hint of distortion creeps into the mix. The surrounds are almost constantly engaged, as bits of detail gently flow from speaker to speaker. The hustle and bustle of the busy train station is especially well rendered, with footsteps, the rustling of clothing, steam, whistles, and rail sounds at once distinct and yet unified. The gears and clicks of the automaton are crisp and lively, and especially the swoosh of flying papers floating about the room, and when the train crashes through the station the cacophony of destruction crashes through the speakers. Stereo separation across the front channels is also excellent, and bass frequencies are potent and perfectly integrated into the track's whole. Howard Shore's gorgeous, Oscar-nominated score boasts exceptional presence and fidelity, caressing small moments and accenting big ones, yet never overwhelming the on-screen action. Dialogue is always well prioritized and easy to understand, and no surface noise or hiss intrude or distract. As I have already informed you that 'HUGO' won Academy Awards for sound editing and sound mixing, and this superbly clear, active, and immersive track makes it easy to understand why.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature Documentary: Shoot The Moon [The Making of HUGO] [2011] [1080p] [20:00] Martin Scorsese, screenwriter John Logan, members of the cast, and other creative personnel examine various aspects of the film's production in this interesting, yet standard, behind-the-scenes documentary. Glowing comments about Martin Scorsese are sprinkled throughout this piece, which covers the original book upon which 'HUGO' was based, casting, sets, working with dogs, and Martin Scorsese's attraction to and philosophy concerning 3D films and photography.

Special Feature Documentary: The Mechanical Man at the Heart of HUGO [2011] [1080p]  [13:00] The history of automatons, from their Greek and Arab origins up through their golden age at the turn of the 20th century, is explored in this informative documentary. Famous automaton makers are also discussed, and we learn about the design and intricacies of mechanics of the automaton used in 'HUGO.'

Special Feature Documentary: Sacha Baron Cohen: Role of a Lifetime [2011] [1080p] [4:00] This amusing spoof allows the comic actor the chance to display some temperament, as he talks about his disrespect for the script, the children with whom he worked, and most importantly, Martin Scorsese himself.

Special Feature Documentary: The Cinemagician of Georges Mlis [2011] [1080p] [16:00] This fond remembrance of one of film's pioneers and the father of narrative movies covers the artist's life, vision, and contributions to the industry he helped create. The great-great-granddaughter of Georges Mlis adds an intimate perspective, Scorsese talks about which Georges Mlis films he chose to recreate in 'HUGO' and other experts chime in on the innovations of his work.

Special Feature Documentary: Big Effects, Small Scale [2011] [1080p] [6:00] This documentary examines how technicians fashioned the shot of the locomotive crashing through the station faade, an actual event that occurred in Paris in the early 20th Century. Meticulous research, construction, and attention to detail all contributed to the effectiveness of this striking sequence in the film.

Special Feature Preview [1080p] You get a long promotional video of The Artist and because it is a silent film, there is of course no voice over advertising the film.

Finally, 'HUGO' will forever stand as my choice for Best Picture of 2011 and as another monumental achievement for director Martin Scorsese. At once an endearing family film and a fabulous 3D experience, 'HUGO' is most importantly a love letter to movies - those who make them and those who watch and revere them and produced by a man who does both. It will move, dazzle, and delight anyone who sees it, especially on 3D Blu-ray. This disc features top-of-the-line 3D video image and reference quality audio surround sound that combine to make 'HUGO' even more thrilling at home than it was in cinema, and a must own 3D Blu-ray disc release. A few more extras would have been nice, but this disc isn't about what's behind the screen; it's about what you view. 'HUGO' is an exceptional film in any format, but if you can, you MUST view it in the stunning 3D, as you won't forget it and the magic images you view will live forever and the opening shot of Paris with the snow falling down, and you will feel it is actually landing on your lounge carpet. I personally think this is the BEST film that Martin Scorsese has directed in a very long time and he is such a passionate person in bringing Georges Mlis to life and especially to bring this silent film director to a new generation in showing that in the days of silent films, you could make spectacular films without CGI computer generating images and that is why I was so honoured and proud to add this brilliant beautiful Martin Scorsese film to especially my 3D Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

So the message of the movie didn't connect with me very deeply.  But its got a cool story, good visuals, and good acting.  Its pretty fun in 3D too if you're looking to expand your 3D library.

4956310,1,B0064YON8G,"THIS IS A REGION B/2 DISC! It will not play on USA devices.

I think the Hugo movie is good-to-excellent, along with the 3D. Unfortunately I will not be able to view this disc, and will need to find it elsewhere.

Seller was RAREWAVES-IMPORTS, but I partially blame Amazon for allowing incompatible movies to be sold without clear labeling. Amazon did bend over backward to try to make things right, but until they modify their system I will be very cautious when ordering movies because now I am not sure of what I am getting. It is very inconvenient to have to double check if a movie might not work.

Incompatible movies should not come up when browsing. I live in the USA. This does not happen if I buy a movie from Walmart or Best Buy or Target. At the very least, the title and description should clue the buyer in as to where the movie is compatible to be viewed.

Sellers should be sure customers are aware if a movie has a different region code than the location being shipped to.

Very disappointed.",1403481600,,1009,4.4324324324324325
4956311,4,B0064YON8G,"I bought this film because it's family friendly and kid friendly. Brian Selznick was raised in nearby East Brunswick, New Jersey where he went to high school. He became a successful children's book illustrator. With his own genius in illustrations, he has developed a story with beautiful visuals. Martin Scorsese's daughter wanted her father to adapt the book into a movie. It became an award winning hit with critics and audiences alike. This film is about 2 hours long with a terrific cast including Sir Ben Kingsley; Sir Christopher Lee; Richard Griffiths; Frances De La Tour; and Sasha Baron Cohen.

The acting is great but the art direction is first rate with attention paid to every detail. The story takes place in a Parisian train station between World War I and World War II. Hugo encounters Georges Melies, a toy shop owner at the station. Their encounter leads to an unlikely friendship. Secrets, revelations, and truths emerge slowly but masterfully as always under Martin Scorsese.

This film shows Scorsese's range as a film maker with an emphasis on details. Scorsese takes the audience to a magical place in film making where the audience can be captivated by the cinematic beauty onscreen.

If I have one complaint, it is that this DVD doesn't have any extras like a behind the scenes or documentary style of adapting the book to the screen. I would have liked to have seen interviews from the cast, crew, and others.",1403395200,,1435,4.872950819672131

4956320,5,B0064YON8G,"This is one of my ""go to"" movies when I need to take a break and nothing's on the tube.  It's a shame that it has often been dismissed by many as a ""kids flick"". Hugo is a 2011 3D adventure drama based on Brian Selznick's novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret.  The film received much critical acclaim at the 84th Academy Awards coming home with five Oscars--for Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Sound Editing out of the eleven nominations it was given.  Hugo won two BAFTAs and was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards, earning Scorsese his third Golden Globe Award for Best Director.  In my estimation it was a visual masterpiece.

Hugo is a 12 year old boy who lives alone in the walls of the railway station in Paris where his job is to help his uncle wind the station's many clocks.  Hugo's father has died leaving him and orphan.  His dad was a tinkerer of mechanical mechanisms at a museum and had taught Hugo an ability to repair wind up gadgets.  When his alcoholic uncle passes away Hugo lives in constant fear of being caught by the vigilant Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) and be put in an orphanage.

Hugo has an automaton given him by his father and a notebook showing schematics on how to repair it so he pilfers small parts from the local toymaker Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley).  Hugo is caught and his treasured notebook is taken from him by Papa Georges who says he is going to take it home and burn it.

The story unfolds as Hugo tries to retrieve the notebook and meets the myriad of characters that frequent or work at the train station.  The movie is mostly true to the book and unfolds the story in an enchanting, endearing way that will leave the viewer in love with every character in the story.",1401235200,,1781,4.479876160990712

4956327,4,B0064YON8G,"Hugo is not about gangsters in New York or a man seizing Wall Street by storm, however the director never lost his touch with his inner child in Hugo. Hugo, a movie detailing the life of an orphan who lives in the train station of Paris winding the clocks, is visually addicting to look at. The world Scorsese captures here is one of beauty and wonder, and along with keeping some French in the film it feels more authentic. The movie itself may seem to start slowly for some who might expect high-speed chases or a mystery such as The Adventures of Tin-Tin, though Hugo has its own beat it goes to. Give the movie time to develop and its messages to sink in, and you'll enjoy the show.",1400630400,,686,4.325581395348837

4956358,5,B0064YON8G,"I rarely go to the movies because I seldom find a movie worth watching.  Nevertheless, I purchased a 3D TV and a Blue-Ray player with the hope that I could locate some good 3D movies. I ordered 3 from Amazon (Avatar, Journey to the center of the Earth, and Hugo).  I am very pleased with each purchase, but I liked Hugo best.  Hugo has something for everybody. It's part historical, part humorous, has great special effects and contains none of the foul language so prevalent in recent films.  The Amazon price compared favorably, and delivery was prompt. If you want to see one of the best movies in recent years, order Hugo.  I have seen it 4 times, and will probably watch it many more.",1398124800,,689,4.48

4956366,5,B0064YON8G,"Director Martin Scorsese ventures off his accustomed path in this magical fantasy tale that is by no means limited in appeal to a juvenile audience. While two of the principal actors ARE children [Asa Butterfield (13) -Ender's Game, The Boy In the Striped Pajamas; and Chloe Grace Moretz (13) -500 Days of Summer,Carrie,Kick-Ass], their characters do things that real 13-year-olds wouldn't do!
At the heart of the story is an association with the machinery of creativity, in which even the fantastical clockworks are magical and magnificent. Scorsese presents a great modern Dickensian novel that is set in the little world of a grand, immense 1930s Paris train station. Shot in London, where a bounty of seasoned stage actors were available, the cast includes such luminaries as Christopher Lee [Lord Of the Rings, Dark Shadows],Sir Ben Kingsley [Schindler's List, Ghandi],Richard Griffiths and Frances de la Tour [The History Boys], Sascha Baron Cohen [Borat, Bruno], Jude Law [Sherlock Holmes,The Grand Budapest Hotel], and Emily Mortimer [Shutter Island], all of whom weave in and out of the picture as characters in the train station, each with a story of their own that is told more in actions rather than with much unnecessary dialogue.
But the invention of young Hugo Cabret, an orphaned lad who lives secretly behind the facade of the station's interior walls, maintaining the many huge clocks in a lonely and clandestine existence, brings to life the eternal myth of a lost man [Kingsley's Georges Melies] guided back into life by the hands of a child. An avid film collector and historical cinema enthusiast, Scorsese honors here the work of the late 19th-century pioneering filmmaker Melies, whose experimental creations [over 500!] were forerunners of stop-motion photography and other visual effects still used today.
The winsome, exceptionally talented Butterfield is joined in Hugo's adventures by Isabelle, Melies' ward [Moretz] in an enchanting collaboration that makes you believe that Hugo and his accomplice could almost be brother and sister.

4956429,5,B0064YON8G,"This film is available in 3D, but I don't have the 3D kit for my TV. The important thing to note is that Scorsese did not lean on the 3D to the detriment of plot and action, so it is perfectly watchable in 2D.

A fine old-fashioned type of movie with a happy ending, barely squeaking over the line to PG for very minor reasons. I would have no trouble letting kids view this except very small and easily frightened ones. At the same time, it's great for adults who are tired of blood, guts and violence and just want a well-told story.

I do have a minor complaint about the color design/grading - the film's color design follows the fad of restricting the color range to give a certain mood, not as strongly as some; but really, there are only a few directions you can go (paler, grayer, blue and beige) without making really ugly results, so this tends to become a ""me too"" kind of theme. Still, it's fairly moderate and doesn't spoil the film.  Just a little tiring once you recognize it.

Lent it to some friends - will be interesting to hear their comments.",1393372800,,1062,4.348484848484849
4956430,4,B0064YON8G,"I liked ""Hugo"" quite a lot, mostly because of the feast of visual effects that the film offers. The opening sequence, zooming through long-ago Paris, is exhilarating, perhaps even better than a similar flight in the otherwise forgettable ""Moulin Rouge"" (2001) by Baz Luhrmann. The story of ""Hugo"" is rather predictable and only mildly intriguing, and the acting is nothing special. However, Martin Scorsese's effective command of photography and sound leave no doubt that a master filmmaker is at work. It is well-nigh impossible to take one's eyes off this delicious screen banquet. What dazzling impact will next make itself be felt? Watch ""Hugo"" and be prepared for an amazing journey.

I literally watched it early this 2014 and was totally enthralled.  It is a true nostalgia movie with a beautiful essence of what films are made and what others lack today.  I didn't anticipate such a well-written tale and have it beautifully depicted through a children's film.  It actually brought tears to my eyes at the end. I really, really enjoyed this.",1393286400,,461,4.597560975609756

4956455,4,B0064YON8G,I don't normally like a lot of movies based on books but this one was pretty true to the story.  The main reason it got 4 instead of 5 was due to the actors all having British accents instead of French.  The story takes place in Paris....surely French actors could have been found for this movie.,1392163200,,296,4.267857142857143

4956457,5,B0064YON8G,"I mentioned that it is a children's movie because the director (nevermind the one-of-a-kind Sascha Boren Cohen) is not known for children's movies. It made me hesitate a long time before renting it. Once I did, I immediately bought it. It's one to watch again, for the cinematography, production values, and the touching story. The young protagonist is an orphan living in a train station (between the wars Paris). The young actor who portrays him, does so with clarity and poise, without turning sentimental. Ben Kingsley of course breaks your heart.  Even Cohen turns in a surprisingly poignant performance as the Uber-Guardian Inspector.  Anyone who enjoys art history, early cinema, and a darn good adventure will like this movie.",1392076800,,734,5.159663865546219

Despite the difficulties that Hugo (the main character) went through, the movie was uplifting - so this was no downer.  We both recommend this movie to adults.

To fight for the preservation of one of the 20th century's art forms with undying passion and then using the most current techniques to tell a story of one of the innovators of magic via film seems a perfect focus for this journey.  In the theatre, on a large screen, in brillantly executed 3D, the film did for me what I suppose the oncoming train did for the unjaded film audiences in the early 1900's.  The work is an homage to everything cinematic, the story is touching and revealing, and the cast plays their notes with heartbreaking reality.

Apparently it was filmed in 3D but I did not see it in 3D.  It is not a fast paced movie but lovely and very enjoyable, and for the whole family. Mr. Scorsese wanted to make a movie that his 12 year old daughter could see (as his movies are usually rated ""R"").  I didn't realize (before watching) the movie also focused on Georges Melies, one of the very early film makers. Since I enjoy silent movies, this was an added bonus to me.

I feel it's quite worth the time to watch.

POSSIBLE SPOILERS:

The unreasonable protag has a dog and a war injury, which makes for some amusing scenes and a bit of richness to the plot.
The young boy is a clock winder in the train station, having taken over from his uncle.  Some of the scenes connected to that are interesting.
As well, the young boy has an unusual item passed from his father, which is the crux of his mission in life at that time.

It does have enough new elements to save it from being a bore and is well worth the time.",1387324800,,838,4.444444444444445

4956593,4,B0064YON8G,"I have loved 3D since I was a kid. I was lucky enough to see 'House Of Wax' in its glorious first run. (See my review of the Blu-Ray.) I mention this, because it is still the standard against which 3D movies must be judged. And, at least for now, any 3D movie must be judged as (first) a movie, and almost as important (second) a 3D movie.
As a film, Hugo is charming. It's a unique mixture of fantasy and movie history. The bare bones story is that of a young orphan boy who 'rediscovers' Georges Melies, the early film pioneer. Parts of it are based on fact, parts are not. I won't go further into this because you can find a plot summary anywhere on the net.
In general, the acting is excellent (with the exception of Sacha Baron Cohen, who overplays terribly). There is an unfortunate tendency to be 'French,' but it's a minor quibble.
Scorcese has done his usual yeoman's job, and has chosen a perfect vehicle for his initial excursion into 3D.
Which brings me to the second part of the review: the use of 3D.
When I heard Scorsese was making a 3D movie, I was excited. The fact is nobody (with the exception of Andre de Toth, who directed 'House Of Wax') had really explored the 'grammar' of 3D. Mostly, it is used as a gimmick, to startle and thrill the audience. In this way, it's a bit like the guitar 'wah-wah' pedal. Everybody had one, but no one knew what to do with it -- until 'SHAFT.'
I must say I was a tad disappointed in the result. There are some beautiful and romantic sequences -- even breathtaking. Only occasionally, did the effects seem 'gimmicky'. Even the roaring train was a sly harkening back to the reactions of the early film audiences. It's a big step forward. Not the kind of quantum leap of D. W. Griffith, but at least the 3D melded with the story in a meaningful way, and gave me hope that 'depth' would become a legitimate tool for the director, and not remain a novelty and be relegated to die, yet again.
My one criticism of the camerawork in HUGO has to do with 'depth of field,' and hearkens back again to 'House Of Wax.' If you watch this classic, you may notice that de Toth uses an extremely 'wide' depth of field. (I know this is expensive and difficult). Watch carefully! In the street scenes the background is as sharp as the foreground. The same is true of the interiors. The director is 'playing' on the depth, saying, ""Just as in life, you can truly look anywhere. It's entirely your choice how far away you want to focus."" Even seen in 2D, 'House Of Wax; seems to have 'depth.' In 3D it is stunning.
Scorcese, however, uses a more 'traditional' field depth. The focus shifts from foreground to midground to background, never showing all three distinctly. In doing this, he is dictating just how far you can really 'look into' the picture.
Perhaps, this is my prejudice. I am no Martin Scorcese. I'm just the guy writing the review.",1386806400,3,2881,4.417293233082707

4956597,5,B0064YON8G,"I absolutely love this movie, however some viewers should prepare before watching Hugo. One, viewers need to understand that Martin Scorsese (the director) is a storyteller, and like all of his films he takes a keen interest in nurturing dialogue, characters and scenes from start to finish.  Personally, I love his style, it is natural and follows a familiar equation that life presents the unexpected. I find that many directors lack this form of storytelling and must reveal everything or leave it all predictable, which is most unnatural, but some viewers may connect best with these types of movies. Second, I highly recommend watching A Trip To The Moon & The Extraordinary Voyage by Georges Melies. The black and white original as well colour deluxe copy are both available free on Amazon Prime right now and I really advise taking advantage of this free viewing as it will give you a fonder appreciation for Hugo. So you ask, what do the above statements have anything to do with Hugo? Well, the film is set in a 1930s Parisian train station as we follow a young boy (Hugo) on his quest to complete his late fathers work. On this quest he forms a remarkable bond with the ex-magician and filmmaker Georges Melies, now a shop keeper at the train station. This is merely a brief overview of the movies premise, I will leave the rest of the details and twists and turns for the viewer to discover themselves. However, it is safe to say this: Scorsese beautifully and delicately bridges one characters private turmoil with the disguised turmoil of others (as based from the novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret, 2007).
Pros:
Excellent use of 3D
Hidden historical figures, my favourite being Salvador Dali
Excellent storytelling that feels natural
Refreshing cast
Great character development that reminds me of the effort that used to be put into Tin Tin
Beautiful cinematography

4956621,4,B0064YON8G,"The main problem for those who like their storytelling to be straightforward narrative is that this movie really doesn't begin to make sense until towards the end. The first three-quarters of the film is atmospheric, bizarre and apparently pointless. It's visually amazing, the setting is among the most original I've seen and the acting is superb. The young actors fit their roles perfectly and they are surrounded by a cast of seasoned British professionals, even though the movie is set in France, who convey the eccentricities of their characters brilliantly. Scorsese knows that for eccentric characters, you can't beat the British!

Parts of the movie seem to drag and are a little repetitive, principally the scenes involving the station inspector which take up too much of the film, and that is why I don't think it quite merits five stars. Nevertheless, stick with it; as the threads begin to weave together you will find yourself transported to another place. I found myself saying ""So THAT'S what it's all about"" as it all became clear. The final scenes are moving without ever descending into mawkishness.

The human head never appears to have any depth or spherical shape and generally just looks like a 2D image pasted in front of a 2D background.  The one exception to this I did find while watching Hugo, in one short scene near the end of the movie when Ben Kingsley gives a speech on stage and the camera zooms in on his face.  This is the first and only time I have ever experienced a 3D facial effect in a movie where the actor's head actually has spherical form and depth and truly appears lifelike.  Without the 3D glasses on I noticed that the blurring around his face was much more severe in this one scene than in any other part of the movie.  Perhaps there lies the secret to a lifelike 3D effect.  I imagine it must be cost prohibitive to replicate this effect throughout the whole movie and that is probably why it's not done.

4956639,5,B0064YON8G,"Hugo is the fictional story of an orphan (Asa Butterfield) who hides among the massive clocks of the Montparnasse Railway Station in Paris of the 1930s. In a corner of that station there is an obscure man who was once famous, Georges Melies (Ben Kingsley), an actual historical figure, a magician who became a filmmaker in the 1890s. But by the 1930s he is a forgotten man, running a small toy store. Director Martin Scorsese, a movie history buff, uses Hugo's journey of discovery to entertain and enlighten us with a story that includes one of the earliest and most significant pioneers of the motion picture industry.

Hugo Cabret is obsessed with an antique automaton, a clockwork robot of the sort popular in the 1800s, many of which were capable of performing amazing feats. Hugo wants to restore it to working order, a project he had been engaged in with his late father. He needs mechanical parts, and to get them he steals toys from Melies' store. Caught in the act, he is put to work in the store, and eventually meets the storekeeper's goddaughter, a girl about his own age. She provides the vital part to restore the automaton, and it begins to draw a picture. It creates the most famous image from Melies' silent movies, the face of the Man in the Moon. And so begins the children's discovery of the surprising world of the earliest films.

The story often evokes a subtle dreamlike state, intentionally blurring the line between the dream sequences and those which depict reality. Scorsese skillfully weaves several plot threads, almost all confined within the walls of the railway station. Aside from the threads devoted to Hugo and Melies, foremost among these is that of the war-crippled Station Inspector, the bane of orphans or runaways who might seek shelter in the station. He is wonderfully portrayed by Sacha Baron Cohen.

This movie combines the best of modern film technology with a moving story about a time when the beginning of motion pictures was still in living memory. It will be enjoyed by most, from pre-teenagers on up. You won't board a train, but for two hours you will make a journey of discovery with Hugo in the Montparnasse Railway Station.",1379721600,,2180,4.792553191489362
4956640,4,B0064YON8G,"Hugo is one of those rare children's film that doesn't treat children like, well, children. The story is far from saccharine--even if it is a tad improbable, that is the idea of adventure. And, much like this year's The Artist, it is also a love story to film that is probably lost to kids, but very clear to adults. What is also very clear in the story is the open-eyed wonder of the world with which the children approach everything. For them, all is possible and should be. And the adults, in their various ways, encourage or otherwise enable that. Scorsese manages to create a near magical sense in a story that absolutely no real magic.

Chloe Moretz continues to impress me. In many ways she's already becoming an adult actor as her child roles (e.g., Kick-Ass or Let Me In) are not exactly your typical children; they're very much adults in child bodies. This role is a partial exception in that her character's outlook is a bit naive, but she is still very much her own person and taking care of herself and others.

And in the titular role, Asa Butterfield looks to be an excellent choice for the upcoming Ender's Game movie. He managed a subtlety of expression not often available to young actors and was as comfortable in silence as he was talking.

Some of the strengths of the film were also some of its weaknesses, which is why this wasn't quite a 5 star film for me. Over time, and re-watch, I may change my mind on that, but initially it hasn't quite cleared that bar. The dual edge is that it is a children's film through and through. Where some films of similar quality manage that and still have rich dialogue and realistic action, both the direction and dialogue left it feeling like a children's story to me. The adults were somewhat thin and over-acted. The kids weren't far from Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney putting on a show in their attitude. That doesn't quite capture what I'm trying to put my finger on here, but it is as close as I can come at the moment. And, to be fair, that doesn't make it bad, it just doesn't make it something I needed to own right right away (though I eventually gave in just for the visuals). It has neither the pure escapist magic that makes a children's movie unavoidably endearing, nor is it quite adult enough that it speaks to my inner child in a compelling way that requires me to have it on-call for bad or confusing days where I need a vacation or guidance.

Interestingly, for me, was that I've experienced something of what the Kingsley role went through. In my last major move across country, 20 years of photos from my years in theatre were lost due to exhaustion and bad judgement during packing. My entire identity felt ripped away, and still does, for that aspect of my life. But even with that direct connection, his story wasn't quite central enough for me to latch in whole-heartedly.

This is an extraordinary movie and will be remembered for a long time--in fact, I suspect its success will grow over time as more people discover it now that the Oscars have graced it with so many statuettes. And who know that Marty had such a soft center underneath all that darkness and violence?",1379721600,,3158,4.523642732049037
4956641,5,B0064YON8G,"It's obvious the Director Martin Scorsese finds pioneering filmmaker George Melies fascinating. This film is a loving, whimsical tale that deals with the magic of Melies. The 3-D blu-ray is exceptionally crisp with the 3-d effect used in the proper fashion. It pulls the viewer into the scene, much like a live theater stage, rather than relying on cheap ""comin' at ya"" gimmicks. It completes the magical feel of the film. I highly recommend the 3-D version to capture the director's vision of the story. Only negative is, as always, the over the top Sasha Baron Cohen who's attempts at humor fall short. Still can't forgive the producers of Les Miz for casting this guy as the Innkeeper. But bravo to Martin Scorsese and to young Hugo Cabret, Asa Butterfield",1379635200,,759,4.846153846153846

Big part of the drama took place in this train station with all the characters involved in the childs life who  was obsessed with fixing this automaton and when he finally got the devise working he discovered with the help of other characters that it was involved with Milnes, a film producer at the beginning of the century who was forgotten.

4956651,5,B0064YON8G,"I am an Amazon customer for many years. The ease of ordering, the price and quick delivery are the standard and it was again here with Hugo.

Hugo is my second 3D title on Blu-ray. My conventional TV ran great for years. Its failure recently sent me out shopping for a replacement and I didn't hesitate to get 3D. I got the matching disc player and dashed out to buy anything in 3D. Okay, it all works. Amazing, but I didn't have any passion for that particular movie. So I ordered Hugo.

The other reviewers have done a wonderful job describing the movie. I saw it in the theater in 3D and was thrilled. Like other reviewers, I thought this one of the best uses of 3D and I was and still am convinced that this story requires it. This is because of the locations where the story is told. The main location is behind the walls of the public spaces of a train station and behind those walls is machinery and towers and stairs. We, the audience, put on our plastic lenses and get to move within these spaces. We also get a Doberman with a long snout poking out from the screen.

3D at home: This really, really works. The experience was exactly as I remember it sitting in the theater. I wondered if it was foolish to get the 3D television. It isn't and if only for this movie.",1378944000,,1275,4.260330578512397

4956660,5,B0064YON8G,"I'm not a Martin Scorsese fan, in general, but I will say that in HUGO he has made one of the most PERFECT films that I've seen in years, a real homage to the magic of cinema. It's unfair to call this a children's film, although the story is really told through a child's eyes. I can't go into detail about the story without giving away the many surprises that await you upon the first viewing. I envy you-those that are going to see this for the first time.
Note: I've seen this movie in a ""regular"" showing-not 3-D. Whatever format you see it in, I can't recommend this movie highly enough!",1377993600,,592,4.294642857142857
4956661,4,B0064YON8G,"A heavy movie that used all the technical means in today's movie arsenal to pay homage to the very early steps of cinematography.
While going for the same goal, this movie is basically the exact opposite of ""The Artist"".",1377993600,,220,4.666666666666667
4956662,5,B0064YON8G,"Considering that movies I typically watch are more action-oriented, I never thought that Hugo would make the short list of movies that I would buy and watch multiple times. I do like the ""classics"", but I did not think before watching this that Hugo would ever make it into that category for me. My wife saw it in the theater with my two boys, and even her characterization of the movie was ""It was OK."" She said ""I liked it, but I don't think you will."" Thus, I did not make watching this movie a priority initially. Then, after reading previews, reviews and descriptions, I still thought this would be a movie I would not be overly interested in.

Wow, was I ever wrong!

I finally watched it for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and Hugo is simply a brilliant movie. I liked every minute and every aspect of the movie. The plot is not overly complicated, but the attention to detail, the nuances of most every scene, the acting performances turned in by the cast make the movie very special. Everything about the movie is outstanding and result in making the simple plot shine in its genius.

The scenes in the train station have so many ""layers"" - you can play back each scene and pick things up you did not see the first or second time, and marvel at the attention to detail. Each scene is well thought out and executed with a touch that makes it special. There is literally something for everyone in this movie - no matter your age group - this movie appeals to those of all ages. That in itself says a lot about the universal quality of this film. It appeals to the younger generation since it has children in the lead role; and to the older generation due to it's historical aspect of movie making.

Plus, this movie is a treat and really shines in 3D - I have a 3D set and it was very enjoyable.  The scenes in the clock tower were very interesting, and you almost felt like you were in all the narrow stairways and passages.

I can see how some who go to the movies for action, adventure may not appreciate this film, but if you enjoy a movie that pays attention to detail, attempts to marvel the senses with interesting scenes and props, then you will thoroughly enjoy Hugo. It is truly a special film. Martin Scorsese shows his versatility with this film.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the cinema and it's history, and to anyone that enjoys innovative scenes and great acting.

Martin Scorsese produced and directed a wonderful movie and a movie that lifts your spirits!  I especially have a knowledge of silent movies and he incorporates this knowledge of silent movies, winding the camera the film and all films that were lost during WWI.  Seeing the very famous clip which was real of Buddy Keaton's hanging onto the clock is very famous and so sweet to see brought into HUGO, where, Hugo, was the little boy doing the same thing.  Hanging out on the ""Watch Tower"" is very risky!  As Jimmy Hendrix sang to the ""Joker and To the Thief.""  All along the Watch Tower, Hugo is a little boy who is afraid for good reason of the outside world for his time, however through the key to the heart there is a happy ending and this turns the clock of time in a happy way.

What's nice about Hugo, is not that it's 3-D, masterfully done by one of the greatest directors in film history, it's that he takes you back to the beginnings of the film industry.  There's a story within the story that is very important for any film fan.  When you watch some of the extras on the disk, you are given a history of the man the story is really about, Georges Melies.  Georges didn't invent movies, but he invented special effects, most of which are still amazing today.  And Mr. Scorsese shows you how those effects were done in the day.  This movie did win 5 Oscars, but both Martin and the movie were robbed, and should have taken the Director and Best Picture awards too (The Artist, is a wonderful movie too, and one you should also buy!) This is a movie you can watch over and over.",1371427200,,911,4.236994219653179

I actually watched this movie with my 2nd graders on the Smartboard after I had read the book aloud to them.  They loved the book and were entranced by film version. The only issue I had was with the sound. I had the Smartboard's volume and the laptop's volume all the way up and some of the quieter talking scenes were difficult to hear. But nevertheless it was great movie!!,1371340800,,490,4.212765957446808

4956757,4,B0064YON8G,"This is a surprising movie that follows the English tradition of being about a young boy who is ill-treated by the world but eventually wins out through hard work and pluck.  It mostly takes place within a train station and, further, within the workings of a clock.  It is excellent acting by all parties, including the several character parts of the older couple who meet at the cafe in the station, the young flower girl, the book shop owner, and the policeman.  The plot builds on the movies of Georges Mlis and builds around a mysterious ""automaton""--a mechanical man.  The scenes of Paris from the train station, the train station itself, and the clock works are terrific.",1370995200,,677,4.760683760683761

The characters are believable, and all developed just well enough that we care. The plot is great. It's quick enough that I didn't get bored, but it slowly and carefully develops without gaping holes. It's interesting enough and quick enough I think a kid could enjoy it, but for a relaxing evening, it's also quite fun and interesting.

I'm also a bit surprised by the versatility some of the actors showed.

Give it a shot. It's a great movie.",1370908800,,601,4.704761904761905

4956776,5,B0064YON8G,"Hugo is a marvelous, grand spectacle of a film. I had no idea, but now I do: Martin Scorsese is a film making genius!! This movie is a reminder of Les Miserables and Super 8(in a sense); both which are great movies as well. Asa Butterfield portrays the young Hugo with grace and style; yes he IS that good. The supporting cast includes Chloe Grace Moretz (she really has quite the talent), Ben Kingsley, Jude Law as Hugo's father, Ray Winstone, I was also pleasantly surprised to see Sacha Baron Cohen in this movie. They all did one heck of a fine job bringing Hugo to life. The storyline is just what you would want it to be: enchanting, mesmerizing, delightful, and just a real joy to watch. With fine acting and a superb storyline, Hugo is One of the best movies ever made.

5 Stars",1369180800,,786,4.383561643835616

4956796,5,B0064YON8G,"Despite the poor box office performance, which I could care less as a viewer, this movie is still my favorite and will continue to be my favorite for who-knows-how-long.
I can remember I have watched Hugo in the theater for three times, twice in 3D and every time I got overwhelmed by the stunning film work. Besides, the second trailer still has the power to give me hot tears. But why such a PG film could possibly have so much affection onto a grown-up! If I say this is a sweet story, many people may start to rant "" Hugo lost his father"", "" Hugo is an orphan"","" Hugo is alone"", "" Hugo is cold""... But still remember during the trailer Isabelle said ""the message brought him all the way home""? Hugo, he is strong. Still remember when Hugo confessed that he thought his purpose of life was to fix things? Mustn't a fixer be strong oneself first?
The film from the surface is a tail of a little boy trying to find his father, if dig deeper, it is a tribute toward George Mlis and classic cinema, but just try a little bit harder, it is a lesson for all ages- to be strong, to find a purpose, to go home. For the complexity of the story, I have to thank for the original author of the book, Brian Selznick, but It was Marty who put all those gigs on the silver screen. The smooth texture of the image, the flowing angles, and the almost perfect editing.
Hope you will enjoy it!",1367884800,,1378,4.243346007604563

Scorcese is not only top-tier master director, but truly has an instinct for using the 3D technology to dramatically enhance the viewer's film experience better than anyone so far! The movie plot is fascinating AND the 3D is absorbing. This is one of my favorite five movies since 2000 and a must for any 3D movie library! It's a joke that ""The Artist"" (though an excellent and clever movie) beat it out for the Best Picture and Best Director Oscars that year. Scorcese was robbed big time! You'll never tire of repeat viewings! Unlike most Scorcese films, this one is very sweet, and suitable for family viewing.

4956817,1,B0064YON8G,"Mlis made better movies than this!

Sorry, I just don't understand the hype with this movie and I know a lot of people love-love this movie. I guess a lot of people like mediocre storylines as long as it has a lot of shiny objects, CGI, and a famous director like Scorsese? I've seen it twice and just get so bored with it. The story line is bland and all over the place. The characters, to me, are very annoying (especially Asa Butterfield (Hugo) and Chloe Moretz (Isabelle) -- whose acting ""abilities"" are beyond me) and makes me less emotionally invested in them and thus makes the movie even more unbearable (although I did like Sacha Baron Cohen's character, and Christopher Lee's cameo). I don't know how kids can stay interested in this movie! Sure, the visual effects are nice, but the movie still falls flat.

I totally agree with this reviewer (achsaphillippi8) on IMDB, ""My first impression was that the movie was about a boy trying to uncover a great mystery left behind in the wake of his father's death. I thought the movie was going to open up into an enchanting adventure, complete with suspense, action, and magic. I didn't get any of those things. This movie starts out with a long build-up, with the audience waiting for this magical adventure to get underway, only to keep them waiting for another hour or so, where nothing interesting or magical happens.""",1366934400,17,1376,4.681818181818182

4956836,1,B0064YON8G,I was expecting more. The beginning of the movie too slowly to keep my attention. I found myself looking for other things to do while it was on and finally turned it off after 40 minutes.,1365811200,3,187,4.222222222222222
4956837,3,B0064YON8G,What a great movie! Too bad Amazon streaming stopped streaming 10 minutes before the end of the movie. This wasn't the 1st time this has happened with Amazon streaming.

4956839,3,B0064YON8G,Not sure what all the hype was about. It wasn't bad. It just wasn't that entertaining to me. The scenery looked authentic. I think that's one of the reasons it won so many awards.,1365811200,,179,4.294117647058823

4956843,5,B0064YON8G,"Unusual premise...delightful imagery. It added to my lexicon of unique thoughts which pop into mind during moments of reverie. Due to the trailer material I was expecting another ""Deus Ex Machina"" of magical intervention. That would be fun all by itself but it was much, much better---the story of the human creativity and perseverance.  The slightly ""jerky"" scripting and filming mimicked the early screen work of the movies. I really enjoyed the colors and the costuming. Great movie...and very different.",1365638400,,507,5.3375

This deeply involving and satisfying tale of redemption for all the age groups in the film is a sleight-of-hand of miraculous proportions.  Beautifully shot and beautifully considered, this semi-surrealist/realist film breaks all the conventions and, well.........just see it.

Some will say the plot is slow, but they're probably too used to the nasty split-second action cuts that pollute movies today.

A parable, I say, because so many of us hide from others, even those closest to us, somehow afraid to tell our stories, speak out minds, use our gifts. Hugo learns and then teaches others to speak his dreams. In doing so he allows others to be liberated from doubt and fear and defeat.

An automaton left behind by the boy Hugo's father was his last connection with his father. The story revolves around this in 1930's Paris.

Hugo is a well-staged and filmed movie with a very good script and acting. I save my five star reviews only for movies that profoundly effect me. Hugo didn't quite do this for me.

The first five minutes of the film has no dialog, but the viewer is keenly aware of what is going on.  Very reminiscent of the book which takes the reader from the written word to the picture view and back to the written word (the picture view is crucial to the story and cannot simply be skipped).

The film has some excellent special effects which make the story line even better, but the surprise is the story within the story.

4956917,4,B0064YON8G,"My son asked to watch this movie because he had read the book (The Invention of Hugo Cabret) and really loved the book.  I didn't really know what to expect, as I wasn't familiar with the storyline.

The movie was a bit slow at the beginning - setting up the scenes, the backdrop, etc. seemed to take forever and didn't engage me at all, although I was fascinated with the cinematography, which was gorgeous.  The beginning of the movie did convey a wonderful sense of realism and fantasy at the same time - a perfect balance of the two, which is not easy to achieve.  I was impressed with that, even as I was bored with the story.

As the movie developed, I became more engaged and was drawn more and more into the plotline.  By the end of the movie I was fully engaged and emotionally moved.  When I look back on the movie after seeing the whole thing, I have to say that I did enjoy it.  It was a beautifully made movie with excellent casting (especially Sascha Baron Cohen as the station inspector).  I just think the first 15-20 minutes could have been condensed into 5 minutes.

My kids (ages 9 and 11) enjoyed the movie as well.  They didn't seem bored at the beginning, like I was, because they were intrigued by all the clock gears and tunnels that Hugo moves amidst.",1362960000,,1276,4.364406779661017

4956919,1,B0064YON8G,"I'm a 59 year old electronic engineer, who started in electronics at age 5.  (No joke!)  ALTHOUGH I didn't design or work on DVD players, I thought I had a pretty good knowledge of them.  Apparently, not.

This DVD will NOT work in players made for purchase in the U.S.A.!  It turns out that DVD players have region settings.  A1 is what you want.

Now, Amazon is a U.S.A. Company and I believe that Hugo was produced in the states.  So, after purchasing a 3D TV, 3D glasses, 3D Blu-Ray player and a Home Theater Sound System from amazon, I assumed that the DVDs purchased from amazon, would work with my system.  Not so!  At least for this Hugo, sold by this company.

When I contacted them, they replied that they clearly stated what region this disc was for.  Except for the message displayed on my screen, this was the first time I heard of regions in association with players and DVDs!

WHY would a company sell DVDs to a company in America, when the DVDs will NOT work in the DVD players in America?  It is clearly meant to deceive amazon's U.S.A.'s customers.  Perhaps these were copies that didn't sell in Germany.  Germany is where they will work.

First, as a customer, I am mad.  I have to pay return postage to Germany, to get a possible refund, probably minus their shipping charge and mine.  It is almost not worth it, which they are counting on.  Second, as an Amazon merchant, I am furious that another merchant would do such a thing.  If my customer's DVD won't play, I give them a full refund AND I send out another DVD, free of cost and via Priority Mail.  Yes, I lose money.  But, it is how I would like to be treated.  It turns out that by treating the customer in such a way, that I have a customer for life, who recommends me to other people.  I have become a strong believer in Karma.  THIS company has a lot to learn.

As for a review of the movie, I haven't yet seen it.  I'm aware that this is meant to be a product review, but I wanted to warn those who are about to make the mistake that I did.",1362873600,7,2023,4.238845144356955
4956920,3,B0064YON8G,"Pros: Granted, this movie is derived from a book, which has assumedly fleshed out the world in which the story takes place. I haven't read the book, but I've sampled some of the pictures within it, and there's just no comparison between the illustrations of the book and the visuals of the movie. Coupled with the wonderful visuals is a very deeply interwoven audio track. Each scene practically jumps off of the screen and draws you right into the world Scorsese created. The majority of the plot takes place in a train station in Paris, but given how thoroughly the filmmakers fleshed out that world, you can't help but want to explore more of it.

We're all aware of how Hollywood is jumping all over the 3D bandwagon so that they can charge more for admission. But there are some instances where the technology is actually a useful tool and enhances the storytelling effect. This is one of those instances. The visuals become literally enveloping and greatly aid in the effect of pulling the viewer into the story. They are neither campy and in-your-face nor an afterthought, but instead they create a fully realized world that hugs the viewer in a magical blanket. (...Did I just use the word ""magical"" in something other than a very literal sense? I'm afraid I did.)

Cons: The rather sizable problem with the movie, however, is that the compelling nature of technological achievements in storytelling is completely at odds with the more traditional storytelling devices, like the script and acting. The audio-visuals are busy sucking me into a world where the story and characters are trying to push me right back out. It's a very conflicting viewing experience, to say the least. The plot is one that I really couldn't care less about, but that could be remedied with a decent script. The main character, Hugo, rarely does anything other than flash those enchantingly bright blue eyes, cry, and say things that are completely void of substance. Little better can be said for the remainder of the ensemble.

The cast sports the likes of Ben Kingsley, Christopher Lee, Ray Winstone, Jude Law, Sascha Baron Cohen, and Chloe Moretz, but in a vacuum, you would probably conclude that all of these people suck at movies. Moretz plays her character of a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed tyke to an aggravating tee. Cohen falls flat as the comic relief. Kingsley does an alright job, but he suffers from the same problem as the rest of the lot, and the movie as a whole, in that it's aiming to appeal to your average 10 year old. Don't get me wrong; there's a place for movies aimed at 10 year olds. I loved movies when I was 10. But I thought the median age of the Academy votership was 62, not 10. What is this doing as a Best Picture nominee?

Overall: If you really want to watch this movie, I highly recommend forking out the extra cash to see it in 3D. It does the best job in recent memory of completely pulling the viewer into its world, and it's a great example for how 3D can enhance a story. The problem is that enhancing a story from ""bad"" still doesn't do a whole lot. This is another case where I get the sinking suspicion that the Academy saw a movie about the history of movies and leapt at the opportunity to heap it with praise, even if it was, in some cases, undeserved. While I gag at the fact that it also got a nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay, I give it a 6 out of 10.",1362873600,,3393,4.566502463054187

4956953,3,B0064YON8G,"You know, I think I was expecting something different from this movie. It's certainly not a bad movie. I mean it won 5 oscars. It's certainly very pretty to look at, and I would even go so far as to say it's very artistic. But I think the story is where this movie is weakest. Not that it's an all around bad story, no no. Just longer than it needs to be with more characters than necessary. I feel like they could have streamlined George and Hugo's story if Isabelle wasn't in the movie at all. She really wasn't needed. And the first part of the movie was basically just everybody being awful to Hugo. Even after they started warming up to him, when they tell him and Isabelle not to do something, there's no explanation as to why, just 'You're too young to know such pain.' Despite building up how tragic his back story is with the untimely demise of his wonderful Jude Law dad. It's like the adults are so much more selfish than the children in this world that  they just don't think anyone could have been hurt worse than them. Even though the actual reveal of the pain is pretty tame by comparison.

Where the story really shines is when they actually get to the movie plot. It takes forever to get there, but once its there, it does a wonderful job showing movie magic. It really captures the nostalgia of old movies. Audiences of today would probably feel the same way about movies they say as children. Think back to a movie you saw and absolutely loved when you were a kid. That feeling of nostalgia, the wonder of how they managed to do something, how you actually felt for the characters on screen. That is what is captured in this part of Hugo. And by the end you certainly are rooting for things to work out for everyone. When I watched the movie, I felt like the movie was trying to be an epic. But it takes place almost entirely in a train station. And they didn't really take advantage of the station's epic parts, its inner clock work, until later on. After the movie magic part of the movie started. And a little bit in the beginning, just to set the tone of the movie.

Honestly, the movie had a great cast and they all did an amazing job. I just think the cast was too big. I mentioned earlier that I didn't really think Isabelle needed to be in it, and I don't think Christopher Lee needed to be in it either. I love Christopher Lee, really I do. I just think he was there to make Hugo feel better about things he did earlier in the movie rather than progress the plot. There's a romantic subplot for two sets of side characters. The one with Richard Griffiths is pretty cute, unnecessary, but cute. I feel like Sacha Baron Cohen's romance could have been better developed if there was more time to devote to his love interest. As it is, she's really just a pretty face with maybe one thing in common with him. But I may be over thinking that, considering the rest of the romances in this movie.

Anyway, the movie is worth watching. It's certainly very pretty. And the acting is wonderful. You really feel like you were taken on a journey with this movie. It just starts off kind of slow and doesn't really pick up till the middle. If you can just sit back and watch the movie, and not think terribly hard about it, you'll like the visuals, and the sound will help immerse you in the story. And when you get to the good parts, you'll be that much more pleased you stuck out the drawn out parts.",1361923200,,3417,4.309486780715397

4956996,3,B0064YON8G,"Visually the movie is very pretty.  Anybody who has a special interest in Paris, the Gare du Nord train station, and early French film history will enjoy it.  Also fun are a cameo appearance by Scorsese and I think I saw Johnny Depp in the station orchestra (he is also the executive producer of the movie I think).

The problem is that the story is strained and comes across as contrived.  It feels like there are two story lines that come together through happenstance.  First, there's the story of Hugo, the son of a watchmaker who dies leaving Hugo in the custody of his drunk uncle who lives in the Gare du Nord train station taking care of the station clocks, but who disappears leaving Hugo to attend to the clocks alone.  And then there's the story of George Melies, a true-life pioneer in French film history, whose films are believed destroyed by the events of World War I, and is reduced to repairing and selling toys in the train station.

The contrived part is how the two stories come together. Hugo and the toy-maker come across each other only because they happen to be in the same place, and Hugo has been stealing parts from the toy-shop.  Hugo has been stealing the parts to repair an automaton that his father bought and that Hugo and his father were repairing when the father dies.  Surprise (!) . . . the automaton was actually made by the toymaker, but Hugo doesn't know it.  When Hugo manages to fix the automaton, the automaton draws a picture (an image from one of George Melies' movies) that Hugo takes as a message from his dead father who loved going to the movies, and which reveals that the automaton was made by George Melies, the toymaker and former film director.  And there's more.

Whew, this sounds strained because it is.  I expected the movie to be charming and carefree; but it was labored.",1360713600,,1830,4.5426829268292686
4956997,5,B0064YON8G,"Hugo is a ""feel good"" movie. If you have young children it's a must have, and if you don't, it's a must have for the child still in you.  Martin Scorsese is a genius!",1360713600,,166,3.8823529411764706

The uncle, who only cares where his next drink is comming from, is in charge of the giant clock system in a large, very busy, train station. The uncle trains Hugo to take care of his work, while he eventually drinks himself to death, leaving Hugo to fend for himself.  Hugo lives in the train station and continues to take care of the clock system, while trying to keep clear of the inspector that provides security there.

  Furthermore, fate unites their paths to help fulfill an empty void that each has been searching for. Touching, heartfelt, and awe-inspiring...the performance, direction, production, screenplay, etc., work flawlessly to deliver complete satisfaction by films end of over 2 hours in length.
  In Summary...This story is beautifully scripted, offering a seamless blend of loss, humor, longing, hope, compassion, fantasy, determination, and triumph.
  Also, each turn of events are introduced at a comfortable pace, with perfect stride, to effortlessly carry the momentum needed to capture the audiences undivided attention.
  Finally, the underlying theme could be of how a child can inspire the old, giving them meaning, and purpose, and how the old can inspire a child, offering them belonging, and direction. As a result, both are complete in their needs.",1360627200,,1051,5.525

4957003,5,B0064YON8G,"This is a magnificent childrens' fantasy, but it is so much more...it is also a tribute to cinema history and to one of the founding fathers of cinema. While children - if my grandkids are any example - will love this film, it has appeal for all age groups and I believe will be enjoyed by the old and young equally. It won five Oscars at the recent Academy Awards; and director, Martin Scorsese, won a Golden Globe for his direction. One of the Oscars was awarded for visual effects and cinematography...and you will find them both to be stunning. It was shown in the theater in 3D and is available in 3D in DVD format...while I saw the Blu-ray version, it is probably more stunning yet in 3D. The tribute to early cinema contained in the film is based on fact...the characterization of Georges Melies, the enigmatic toy shop owner and former filmmaker, was based on the real pioneer filmmaker of the same name. That is a subplot: the main plot revolves around a young orphan, who lives alone, secretly, in Gare Montserrat, a Paris Railway station. He has learned watch and clock repair from his deceased father and how to maintain the clocks of the station from his uncle, who has disappeared. He maintains the clocks, steals food; and works on his father's favorite project, the repair of an automaton. The automaton becomes the connection to the toy shop owner...and the story develops from there. The wonderful child actor, Asa Butterfield is the orphaned boy, Hugo, and Ben Kingsley is Georges Melies, the film pioneer and toy shop owner. They both deliver masterful performances. The support cast is also superb, including another child star, Chloe Moretz, who plays Melies' adopted daughter and becomes Hugo's best friend; and Sacha Baron Cohen, as the sometimes-comical police inspector.

From the previews though, I expected more. I sort of felt betrayed; that is, the only good parts were in the previews.

Much like the Bridge to Terabithia, a complete RIP OFF! The previews showed only the fantasy sequences leading viewers and buyers to believe it was going to be a film about all these cool animated characters. Instead it was a horribly sad story about a selfish, self centered kid and his only friend who died. The fantasy scenes touted in all the previews were only five minutes of the actual film.

His facial expressions and physical pratfalls were priceless, especially how he injured his leg.

You feel so much for young Hugo and you just want to go into the movie and protect him, I have never seen a movie like this before.

The 3D absolutely blew me away. It wasn't added into the movie just to make it a 3D movie, but it fits right into the movie. You can tell Martin put alot of time and heart into the movie and it is very obvious he did the same with the 3D. The depth is spot on throughout the entire movie and matches up to the depth in Titanic. The pop outs are not cheesy and are only used in spots that actually add something to the movie and not just thrown in there for the hell of it. There was some ghosting on my Samsung TV, but nothing terrible, and to be truthful you get so drawn into the story you really just don't care about the occasional minor ghosting!

We saw it in 3D, and I have say it was used very well in this film. Some films tend to overuse 3D, where you just end up with a lot of weird stuff popping out at you from the screen. In ""Hugo"" the effect was used in a subtle way to truly immerse you in the story, which really is the most important component to storytelling. Scorsese created magic. He took a beautiful story and full realized it for the screen. So well cast, well acted, shot beautifully. But it's all about the story. I absolutely loved it, and looked up the book it was based on (equally lovely, of course). But here's the strange thing. Coming out of the theatre, feeling a sort of quiet joy with what I had just experienced, I asked my Mom what she thought of it. She didn't like it at all. And we usually have similar tastes. So puzzling how one person can absolutely love something, and the very next person, not so much. Still, I really do recommend this film to everyone.

Still, the story about an orphaned pre-teen boy, who traces a miraculous discovery hinted at by his late dad, is a lovingly crafted hommage to moviemaking, taking place in mid-war Paris. Packed with fantasy and crowded with a host of full-bloodied characters, this is not a movie for young children, but not really for tough and superficial youngsters of today, either. However, it should not fail to win its audience, at least for its sheer magic, which more than makes up for a rather simple story.

You might have heard this once, even several times, before: ""Hugo"" is Martin Scorsese' love song to the movies.  If so, it was a menage a trois.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Invention-of-Hugo-Cabret/dp/0439813786/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Invention of Hugo Cabret</a>, written by Brian Selznick, is one of the most charming and sweet (and lengthy) children's books to have come along in a long time, and of course it, too, is a loving tribute to the early days of cinema and in particular the films of Georges Melies, an early master of stop-motion cinematography.  Melies was one of the real pioneers, serving as a producer and actor and cinematographer and editor and makeup and production designer and special effects--heck, he even wrote a soundtrack.

But beyond all of that he was a director of--and I hope you're sitting--MORE THAN 500 FILMS.  While all of them were shorts, it is still a remarkable achievement.

Yet for all his accomplishments his story is frequently a sad one, and it is to that end that Hugo directs a good deal of its later attention.

But even if one were to throw this noble goal aside, ""Hugo"" is, first and foremost, a movie that will evoke in you the joy of watching a beautiful, moving, attentive, colorful and, above all, heartfelt emotion.  It is a tale that all of you--man, woman, boy, girl, old, young--will love.

In a nutshell, an orphaned boy named Hugo (perfectly cast in the form of Asa Butterfield) is able to make a meager living keeping all the clocks ticking in a gorgeous old Paris train station during the 1930s--and here's the kicker--as long as no one realizes that his father has passed away some time ago and the boy has been running everything by himself ever since.  He is fully capable, but there are tight, tense moments when a deliciously petty and hilariously despicable station inspector (well played by Sacha Baron Cohen) gets closer and closer to discovering his secret.

Hugo's one lasting connection to his father outside of the timepieces is a mysterious clockwork man, an intricate automaton that he is desperately trying to repair.  To this end he has found one friend and confidante in a young girl named Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), and together they work to discover its secrets.

There are other great character actors here--Ben Kingsley, Emily Mortimer, Ray Winstone, Christopher Lee, and Jude Law, to name several--but of equal or greater impact is the train station itself,  beautifully rendered and captured in all of its brass-y and steam-y splendor by director Scorcese and his fellow creators.  To this end, the movie won five Oscars (including Best Cinematography, Art Direction, and Visual Effects) and was nominated for six others (including Best Picture and Director).

From its terrific opening shot--a faraway panoramic view of Paris swoops down, then inside the beautiful, gleaming Gare du Nord train station, sweeping along its gleaming tiles and rails until if finds its way into the intimate quarters of young Hugo.  It's a stunning piece of camera work and special effects, and it sets the tone for the technical mastery throughout.  But the beautiful thing is that Scorsese, despite all the technology  and inventive special effects, never loses sight of the characters the story is about, and the ultimate outcome is an is intimate, personal story about not only an orphaned boy trying to find his roots, but about the film industry as well, and its roots as well.

As such, it represents the best things that a movie can do, and be: a conveyor of mass media that can still be astonishingly personal.  See this movie, and it will touch you, too.",1357171200,2,3721,5.045751633986928

4957129,4,B0064YON8G,"Okay, this movie obviously is not a companion piece to ""The Dictator"" in terms of content or story. However, I was quite surprised when I began playback to discover that the two stars of ""The Dictator"" - Sacha and Ben Kingsley - were also the stars of ""Hugo""! These movies were released around the same time, and they do a marvelous job of showing just how talented these actors are. The roles they adopted could not have been more different (especially those of Kingsley), yet they pull it off with astounding aplomb. Their acting styles are polar opposites (Kingsley is emotion driven and somber; Sacha radiates an idiocy that ranges from muted to over the top), but their personalities seem to offset one another quite nicely.

The imagery of ""Hugo"" is magnificent, and it really captures the imagination. The setting of Paris in the 1930s is rendered beautifully, with particular emphasis, of course, being placed on the elaborate train station where the majority of the movie takes place. While the pace can be a bit plodding at times, what slowly reveals itself is a beautiful tale of finding one's place in the world, letting go of past failures, and moving on to embrace life in the present. And as these themes are slowly unveiled and explored, this is when Kingsley turns on the juice and steals the show!",1356825600,2,1315,4.767543859649122

4957144,4,B0064YON8G,"I studied cinema is college. For some reason I think a lot of my classmates are the people who gave this film 1 star. Where cinema is a medium for making our dreams come alive, many see it as a place to make a lot of money and blow s*** up. This film isn't for those people. I remember on my first day of film school when my professor spoke about the ability to see through our minds eye yet projected on a screen. That's what a movie should be, and I think for the most part that is what Hugo is.

There are some reviews here that say that this movie is boring and some say it's too predictable or formulaic. Those people I think have become too jaded. In essence if you think too much about any story, and many of the great stories of our time are predictable. Many stories we already know. You know what happens in the Lord of the Rings if you've read the book, yet the trilogy were some of the highest grossing films. And that story is formulaic as all get out. If you've read anything Joseph Campbell has written about storytelling you can dissect the lord of the rings to bits. On another note, being that the film attempts to delve into cinema's early history and how it is a mechanical process that has made storytelling possible - something that never existed for millions of years and is a very recent invention to follow the most basic rules of cinematic storytelling just reinforces the themes that are being presented. It's not necessarily about the story, but the experience. Don't think about the movie, experience it. For me, Hugo was a wonderful experience.

I love the fairy tale adventure aspect of the film. I love the dialogue tropes using synonyms and alliteration. I love the artifice of the settings. I loved Helen McCrory's perfomance and thought that it's subtle use was such a wonderful addition to the film. As a film school nerd this story was like a sermon being preached to the choir - but I was still enthralled. As it went on it brought so many things to mind, the 400 Blows, 8 1/2, La Nuit Americaine, early Disney. I had become a bit jaded myself about current film options only going to the theater to see new releases about 4 times a year (the last thing that got me out of the house was Beasts of The Southern Wild) and being a stringent revival and museum movie theater go-er most times and I'm only 23 years old. When Hugo was released and watching it now it sort of renews my hope in the movie-going experience.

 I dream of a time when there weren't movie stars like we have now, but we sure had fun. Hugo reminds us of that and brings it back to life for a modern time. I think that it was incredibly well done and that everyone should give it a chance.",1356566400,,2696,4.322134387351778

4957151,1,B0064YON8G,"I think future film historians will point out this movie as a low point in American movie making. Sure, the effects are nice, but the story is a huge yawner, and is so formulaic and dull as to be laughable. And this is ironic since part of the 'plot' (if I can even use the word here) is about the history of movies.

The movie relates how movies were found to be a mechanism for telling stories, but this movie uses 2 hours to tell a very weak story that could be related in a single minute. The rest of the movie is with continual shots of animated gears (yes, very nice... *yawn*) overdone and overused villains, predictable outcomes, and what seems to be the same scenes done again and again to draw out the length of the movie. Yes, I know it is supposed to be a children's tale, but my children could not sit through this one.

What is amazing is that this movie has a big budget, top actors, and one of the best directors cinema has seen. What happened?

As the story progresses, additional bits of intrigue come into play and draw you further into the story. He meets Georges Meli&eacute;s, who presently owns and runs a toy booth at the train station; however, there is much to learn of his past. Hugo comes to realize that the (initially) brusque man has quite an interesting past which bears a connection to his own.

It's one of those movies that when they get released, people can't relate because of the time in which they live.  Generations to follow will appreciate this movie, as it should be appreciated.  You have to watch it without any preconceived ideas, and let the movie tell the story.  You won't get it, until about half way through, and you'll understand that there is a very deep and meaningful message being told that goes way beyond simple cogs and gears, or little dogs, and a poor orphaned boy.  I'll give you a hint, life is what we make it, and we all play a role just as important as the next.  Together, we all comprise this machine called life.

4957171,5,B0064YON8G,"I saw this movie twice in the theater in 3D. Not because I like the movie so much, although I do, but for the the stunning 3D production. This film looks amazing in 3D. The love and attention they put into utilizing the technology is amazing. I was blown away at how good this movie looks on a TV screen. Unlike other 3D movies which use 3D as a gimmick and have objects jumping off the screen at you the 3D in HUGO immerses you in the film. The visuals combined with the surround sound totally envelop you and put you in the middle action. The story line is a throw back to the beginings of film. There is footage in here which traces the first days of cinema and re creates what it would be like to be involved in the intiial stages of film at the turn of the century.

HUGO was originally presented to me as a children's film which is about as inaccurate a description as I could imagine. The pace is probably too slow for young children and might appeal to 13 year olds and up. It definitely would appeal to anyone who loves the art of film making. There is a rich history lesson on the beginings of cinema in this movie, told lovingly and with passion by one of the best, Martin Scorsese.

He threw in a bunch of things into the movie that had nothing to do with the book it was based upon.  He turned this children's movie into a psa on conserving old films, an over two hour psa.  Throwing his obsession of old films into this kids movie destroyed the plot making this movie a garbled mess of tossed together bits and pieces.

4957220,1,B0064YON8G,"I don't usually take the time to review movies, but this film was a complete disaster.  The basis of the film is dull in of itself.  A boy lives in a clock tower, which is largely unexplained except by the fact his father has died in a fire (a fire of Plot for which the movie can springboard off), and he has no mother for whatever reason.  Though some amusing shenanigans occur in the train station, the film is peppered with dull, unlovable characters who either exist to give out meager plot tokens, or are vague attempts at creating interaction dynamics.  Said dynamics are as flat as a frog squished by an 18 wheeler.  Though the film also takes place in France, actors employ bad British accents.  French tropes, like striped sweaters and accordions and little dogs, are lit everywhere, as if you needed to be reminded.

Special effects are dispersed at even ratios throughout the movie, just to spice up a visually dull attempt at an extravaganza.  The robot the boy is trying to repair is only an excuse to throw in these extraneous effects, and in the end, it serves absolutely no purpose.  I left the theater at one point, and almost didn't go back in.  After some texting, a long potty break, and a stroll around the complex, I went back in to find the movie was still on the same scene.  Though I did stay, making it to the end, I left the theater glad for the sight of reality once again.  A redemption-of-an-aging-man story was tossed in almost as an afterthought, and though it only encompassed a small percent of the movie, it had the dull, dragged out feeling as well.

tl;dr: Not for kids, too slow moving, has basically no plot.  Vintage lovers may take some joy in toys, clocks, etc, but lovers of history will vomit at the fact there are badly done British accents in a French movie.  Random redemption story squeezed into the last 1/8th of the film was laughably pathetic.  Truly a waste of money / time.",1355270400,14,1927,4.510086455331412

4957222,5,B0064YON8G,"The film Hugo contains action, mystery, a child heroine, love, French culture, and most importantly it honors the life of a real film maker (Hugo himself is a fictional character, but Georges Melies was real, and the answer to the mysteries of this film is based on facts about his life).

The minor characters have a sort of B-movie simplicity to them, each is constructed to be such a contrast to others in the film that it is a welcome distraction from the darker issues Hugo and Melies deal with, almost to the point of being cheesy but in an entertaining, good way.

The musical score has a strong French influence that is a constant reminder of where this movie takes place and brighten even the dark back-alleys of the film.

The mystery, the action, the romance, the relationships between contrasting characters, the musical score, and the history behind it all combine to make Hugo a must-see film that is truly unique.",1355184000,,928,4.716049382716049

There were a variety of misconceptions about life portrayed here, but there were also parts worth mentioning, parts depicting both the good and the bad qualities of human nature. It was a movie layered with myriad of illusions. Complex, intricate, nuances that hinted at much bigger questions about our understanding of reality and man's existence.

4957243,5,B0064YON8G,"Etienne is missing. How Hugo comes across the Automaton has changed. And the bickering and fighting that goes on between Hugo and Isabelle is non-existent. Also it was competition, not the war, that made Georges Melies stop producing movies.

Having said that I am impressed at how well Scorcese and Depp were able to come up with something that is pleasantly digestible and leaves a nice aftertaste in the soul.

This movie is well crafted and reads almost like the middle grade novel that inspired it. I have no idea why critics slammed this movie when it was at the theaters. It is a wonderful movie with an ending that provides solace in a genre that has grown darker and more brooding in recent years. There's no magic here, except that of the human heart. That's what really drives this movie home. My favorite line from the book was copied almost word for word in the movie: ""I like to imagine that the world is one big machine. You know, machines never have any extra parts. They have the exact number and type of parts they need. So I figure if the entire world is a big machine, I have to be here for some reason. And that means you have to be here for some reason, too.""

This movie has it all: adventure, romance, mystery, and the powerful message that everyone is here for a reason, and all told in such precise and cohesive scenes. It is a movie worthy of my time, and I would be happy to watch it again.

As a teacher I would recommend this to any parents with middle-school children. As a parent I would caution against letting younger children watch this move; 7 would be my limit, but each parents has to decide what's best for their own.

To sum it up: this movie is what movies are about. There's no need to push the envelope to tell a wonderful yarn. That's the mark of an excellent film.",1354924800,,1809,4.388059701492537

You can 3-D-ify a movie all you want but if the story is poorly written & lugubriously delivered it matters not a whit. This movie is striking in its visual effects & yet both my husband & I fell asleep during parts of the movie. The story moves sooooo slowly & it doesn;t get interesting until the last .........15 minutes or so. It's sweet, the acting is fine, I wanted to like this as it was very highly praised by almost every reviewer I read & yet it put me to sleep. So OK it is a fantasy & some leeway can be given for silliness in such a story but you have to at least care about the characters & want to follow them into the fantasy........again this didn;t happen for me. And just when the story would appear to pick up the pace a bit & start really moving forward........more trite dialogue or a chase scene with no purpose. The history behind the early movies is fascinating but is not well served by this movie. If a movie requires that it be seen in a 3-D theatre to be tolerable then that movie fails my test to be rated as a ""good"" movie. The story must support the 3-D and not the other way around.",1354233600,,1280,4.083333333333333

4957350,5,B0064YON8G,"There is so much about this film that I love, and yet I imagine many would not. Other reviewers have explored the film's story-line and themes, its wonderful cinematography and such. Let me instead describe my family and our reception of this film and, if there is something of us in you, then perhaps this is a film you should buy and watch.

My family consists of myself, my wife and my 8 year old daughter. I am a middle-aged man, well educated with a passion for history, art, science fiction. I love old science fiction (novels and film), visit museums, and enjoy family life. My wife, educated in accounting and computer science, also enjoys museums and art galleries, and loves shows such as Star Trek: the Next Generation, Doctor Who and the X-Files and so on. My young daughter, alas, has been indoctrinated into all things fantastic, from Lost in Space to fairies and the things we (her parents) love.

For each of us the film was captivating. The colours in the film evoked the past in a manner that was quite magical. The music was subtle and compelling. The characters... I am not sure how to describe them. Each had little stories that were progressing through the film - stories that ultimately were about belonging or companionship. Somehow the manner in which these were portrayed evoked something of the mechanised panoramas sometimes seen in department stores at Christmas. I mean this in a good way. The construction of the film, from the juxtaposition of past and present (the film's past and present that is) to the use of cinematic effects, was marvellous.

The principal story did pull at heart strings. It was all part of a very strong theme about loneliness and salvation from it.

I also enjoyed the acting, though I have seen some reviews criticise it. The leads were excellent in my opinion. As an aside, Sacha Baron Cohen's portrayal of the station security at times evoked humourous memories of the policeman in Allo Allo. Yet I enjoyed this because it was the perfect mask for the fragility he sometimes let us see in his character.

Once the film was done, I meandered to my bookcases and pulled down some of my books on the history of science fiction and was able to show my family some pictures portrayed in the film. My daughter was delighted that much of it was based on truth.

I know this sounds like I am engaging in some form of hubris and saying that you must be like my family to enjoy this film. But that is not so. I think any person who enjoys a simple but compelling tale told in a magical manner will love this film. However, if you are like us then I feel there is a good likelihood that you will enjoy it and therefore should buy it.",1351209600,,2683,4.544513457556936

4957373,5,B0064YON8G,"Hugo(released Nov/11) stars Ben Kingsley  as George Melies,Asa Butterfield as Hugo Cabret,Chlo Grace Moretz as Isabelle,Sacha Baron Cohen as Inspector Gustave,Jude Law as Hugo's father,Christopher Lee as Monsieur Labisse,and an astounding supporting cast of other actors. This is a nostalgic look back at film making's earliest days and how a young boy is the catalyst for one its most honoured creator's deserved return to the limelight. Beautifully photographed and set decorated,this piece almost immediately brings you into the film titled young boys life and world,and from there the adventure never stops building to its inevitable climax.
The story takes place,I would guess,in the late 20s. Hugo is a young boy living with his father,who works in a museum. Hugo has become a tinkerer of sorts,like his father,and both work together on repairing and bringing back to life an automaton Hugo's father claimed from the museum's basement. One night his father is fatally caught in a conflagration at the museum and Hugo is forced to go and live with his inebriated uncle. The uncle tends the clock works at the Gare Montparnasse,the central train station in Paris. And when his uncle is away,which is quite often,it is left up to Hugo to pick up the slack. Eventually his uncle is found dead,and he is left an orphan.
When Hugo has down time he works away at the automaton. He regularly scrounges parts from an old man who runs a small toy store in the train station. One day the man catches the boy and Hugo is forced to empty his pockets. Among the items the man confiscates is Hugo's diary which his father kept while working on the automaton. That night Hugo follows the man  home and speaks to his young god-daughter,who promises to keep her father from burning the book and to help him get it back.
Next day Hugo is hired by the old man in the toy store to fix his toys. In return he says he will eventually return his book. One day Hugo takes the old mans god daughter to the movies(to which she has never been)and in return she introduces him to a local bookseller. Then Hugo introduces her to the automaton he has been trying to fix. In the process Hugo discovers she,coincidentally,has the heart shaped key that is needed to turn the machine on. The key is inserted and the machine comes to life. Hugo is expecting a message from his father but instead a drawing is made of a scene from an old film produced in the late 1800s by George Melies. They both return to the girls home and present the drawing to her god-mother who wants them to forget about it. Just then she hears her husband waking up and the children are shuffled into a side room. They search for the diary while in there and find a heavy box hidden in a secret drawer in the top of an old armoire. The chair she stands on collapses and the box and her come tumbling down. Papers scatter everywhere,but all have drawings from other scenes of Melies films. The old man enters the room and can only sit despondent at the supposed betrayal Hugo has perpetrated.
The children return to the bookseller wanting to know the best place to find books on old film making. They end up at a specific area at the local library and while reading one particular chapter in a book about George Melies,it dawns on them that her god-father is none other than George Melies himself. Suddenly a stranger appears behind them,who turns out to be the very author of the book they are reading. He asks about their interest in Melies and she tells him her god father is he. The author is incredulous but nonetheless takes the chance and returns home with the children. As soon as her god mother opens the door the author,who met both her and Melies when he was a child,recognizes her instantly. He expresses his gratitude for Mr. Melies inspiration,who is at the moment sleeping. Before parting he gently asks whether she would like to see one of her husbands works. She acquiesces and before long the projector is ticking away,frame by magical frame,the only known remaining print of a George Melies film. They all sit in amazement and when the film ends Mr Melies walks in on them. He instantly starts recalling in brief his career in film making with his wife,and the calamity that led to him having to sell his films for scrap and burning all his sets. He thought no one cared any longer.
Hugo excuses himself to return to the train station to retrieve the automaton. Along the way he gets arrested by a station gendarme who has been dogging him constantly. When Hugo fails to return promptly Mr Melies and his god daughter return to the station and rescue Hugo just in time. It turns out the automaton he and Hugos father work so judiciously on for so long,originally belonged to Melies himself,who was also a tinkerer and an inventor. He had donated the automaton to the museum,but when the fire destroyed it he assumed it has been lost also.
The film ends as the author introduces Melies to a packed audience,who are there to watch again Melies works that have been rediscovered and lovingly restored. Hugo has found a new home and life with the Melies family and the film fades out as we stare at the automaton;the very thing that brought a man and his son close together and has now brought Hugo a whole new life.
As much as the film is a children's adventure,it is also a marvelous educational tool. The film's own subject matter,the French film pioneer George Melie's and his works,which are on prominent display off and on throughout,are absolutely marvelous to look at. On top of this we have a myriad of references to stars of the 20s such as Douglas Fairbanks,Max Linder,Charly Chase,while we actually see Buster Keaton,Charlie Chaplin and especially Harold Lloyd doing his thing in Safety Last. We also get the point of the neglect of film over time and what we have lost,and what we need to do to protect it in order to ensure their longevity or just plain existence. The film also has some neat touches such as the guitar player in a band at the station,who more than likely is a Django Reinhardt reference. So much going on in this film,but all lovingly wrapped up in what essentially is a children's story. All players here do a fantastic job in their portrayals.
Technically speaking the film is its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. The only extra is a making of featurette.
All in all a highly recommended film ,a children's adventure cunningly concealing a message about old cinema and its preservation. Well acted,well shot and well deserved of a place on your DVD shelf.",1347926400,,6557,4.6468561584840655

In fact, it took me more than three attempts to finish viewing film as I kept loosing interest in hopes it would get better, but I was determined to reach the end.

4957436,4,B0064YON8G,"A film about film-making, or about a slice of life in the history of film-making and filmmakers, must always be an appealing subject for any director, and especially for a quirky and historically-immersed director like Martin Scorsese. We are all children of the film age (including Hugo and the other children who pop up in this film) and thus it was interesting to see as the ""plot"" unfolded how film began to be used the movies as a modern metaphor for humankind's imaginations, of its dreams and of the process of going from disbelief to the suspension of disbelief that is part of any film experience, including this film.

As for the film itself, based on an adaptation of novelistic treatment of the wonder of discovery, of invention, and of pure fantasy inherent in trying to make dreams come to life it works pretty well. And to place that challenge in the hands of a child just adds to the effect. One might argue, and should, that the length of the film including its little redundancies (the constant background shots of the railroad station and it inhabitants) could reasonably have been shorter by about fifteen minutes. And, perhaps with tongue in cheek, that it really does take film's magical suspension of disbelief techniques to take a plot that is centered in Paris while the cast speaks the Queen's English making one think that we could have been in the center of London just as easily. Other than those minor points this film was entertaining. And isn't that what film should be all about. That is what its founders thought anyway.",1345420800,,1554,4.7555555555555555

4957438,4,B0064YON8G,"Paris, 1931. Hugo Cabret is a young boy living in Gare Montparnasse, a railway station. He has no family and is trying to salvage parts to fix an automaton, believing it contains a message from his late father. Constantly hunted by the Station Inspector (who delights in finding orphan boys and sending them to the orphanage) and thwarted by a toy stall owner who takes his father's notebook, Hugo's quest seems doomed...until he discovers another piece of the puzzle.

Hugo is director Martin Scorsese's tribute and love letter to the pioneering days of the cinema. The director's first family film and his first movie made in 3D, it's a bit of a new direction for him but also one that he embraces. Hugo is vibrant, colourful, entertaining and amusing, let down only by a slightly excessive running time.

The movie hinges on the central performance of Hugo and actor Asa Butterfield (best known for playing the young Mordred in the British TV series Merlin) does great work in the role, nailing the loneliness of the young boy looking for a place in the world. Chlo Grace Moretz (Kick-Ass, Let Me In) is equally capable in the role of Isabelle, a young girl who befriends Hugo and encourages his quest. Older, more established actors like Ben Kingsley and Christopher Lee also bring their A-games to the movie, with Kingsley particularly successful in his role as real-life movie pioneer Georges Mlis. Arguably the biggest revelation is Sacha Baron Cohen, who leaves behind his increasingly predictable comedic roles (though not entirely his comedic talents) in the role of the Station Inspector, initially presented as a straightforward antagonist who becomes more nuanced as the film progresses.

Visually, the film is a delight. Scorsese uses a combination of sets, CGI and illustrations to create a vivid, exaggerated version of the real world. Scorsese makes the slightly 'false' look of CGI into a virtue, using it imaginatively and contrasting it against the much more primitive effects of early 20th Century cinema, but which were equally groundbreaking in their day. Scorsese is well-known as a film historian and a keen preserver of old movies as well as a director, and he combines these interests with a solid storyline (adapted from an award-winning book by Brian Selznick) to create a film that is close to his heart. Crucially, however, he prevents the film from tipping into self-indulgence by ensuring that these elements are driven by the story rather than any kind of lecturing.

Where the film stutters is its pacing. For a film meant to appeal to children as well as adults, the two-hour running time is a bit long for such a slight story, especially one where the writer and director have to keep contriving dramatic situations out of misunderstandings which could be solved in a single line of dialogue (why does Hugo never tell Georges that the notebook is his father's? Why doesn't he tell the Inspector that Georges is now looking after him?). This problem is accentuated by the presence of under-developed sideplots, such as the Inspector's faltering attempts to romance a flowergirl (a heavily under-used Emily Mortimer), Christopher Lee's lack of screentime and an amusing but very slight storyline involving two station workers (Richard Griffiths and Frances de la Tour). Perhaps expanding these storylines and dropping some of the repetitiveness of the main storyline might have been a better idea and could have filled the running-time more effectively.

Still, despite this problem Hugo (****) is visually arresting and well-directed, with some educational value regarding the early days of cinema and some excellent use of emotion without descending into mawkishness (one shudders to think what an off-form Spielberg would have made of this script).",1344816000,3,3786,5.109854604200323

Loved the cast--even Sasha Baron Cohen who is on my top ten list of actors to avoid.  Ben Kingsley was great as always.  Loved the young actress Chloe Moretz (who is also fantastic in Dark Shadows!).  Ray Winstone played his wonderfully dark character just shy of a caricature (something he does so well).

4957470,3,B0064YON8G,"This movie has a wonderful story and premise, but it suffers from slow pacing and overdone art direction. The film is not only about an orphan boy who tries to fix the automatron he was working on with his dad before he died, it's also about pioneering filmmaker Georges Mlis' life and work. The movie is at its best when it focuses on Mlis. This would have been a great film to use to introduce kids to early silent films, but the pacing is too slow for most kids to even sit through. Plus, I wonder how many kids watching this think that Mlis is just a character in a movie, and not a real person?

Once the story got going, I became glued to the screen and was curious to see where it would take me. I loved how the ending tied everything together into one satisfying conclusion. After watching it, I learned that the movie did accurately portray Mlis' life, including the fact that he was raising a granddaughter and that he was given a tribute later in his life.

On the downside, the movie tries too hard to be whimsical and fantastical. Paris is portrayed as so gloomy and dark, and the scenery was a little too ""steam punk"" for my taste. What would have been better is if Paris was portrayed more realistically so it would have provided a nice contrast with Mlis' dream-like films. Instead, we get a fantasy within a fantasy.

The movie didn't say anything about his mother and brought up his father dying every other scene, not to mention the movie didn't even say anything about his uncle until way over half of it.
The actors were poorly chosen, what little special effects the movie had fell short of anything special and overall the movie Hugo lacked any real connection with the characters. Not to mention it was boring.",1342915200,16,700,4.519685039370079

4957476,1,B0064YON8G,"I'm not sure what is more surprising: that this film is such a mess or that Scorcese directed it. Hugo is supposed to be a magical movie set in the 1920s about an orphaned boy who lives in a railway station clock who is seeking the secret contained in a badly rusted robotic writing machine his dead father was restoring before he died in a tragic museum conflagration. This does not sound magical. In fact, it sounds like a bit of a mess, and that's just the start of this film's problems. The script is simplistic and thoroughly unimaginative and yet, in the hands of a decent director and good cast, it might have been salvaged.

Here we come to the next problem: the casting. It's bad. The main actors are not convincing, in part because they are asked to speak in plummy English accents. For some reason Scorcese must have thought this would add to the atmosphere but instead it's hugely irritating. Firstly, this movie is set in Paris, so why is everyone speaking in posh English accents? Asa Butterfield (who is English) just about gets away with it as Hugo but I'm afraid Atlanta-born U.S. actress Chlo Grace Moretz makes a horror show of her accent, which is stupendousy unconvincing. Sacha Baron Cohen's accent wanders all over the place, from the learned tone of an English professor to broad Cockney, so he also becomes a distraction.

So the movie has three huge strikes against it from the start (bad script/bad acting/bad direction) and I'm afraid it doesn't recover. It's boring. No matter what supposedly innovative twist develops on the screen you're too bothered by the other irritations to pay much attention. The mystery of the robotic writing machine is solved about an hour in and the rest of the time c-r-a-w-l-s until the merciful end. Hugo is trying to be too clever and flops badly.

I really had no idea what to expect from Hugo when I ordered it. I simply read that critics have said that there are two movies that MUST be experienced in 3D: Avatar and Hugo. Having a 3D TV, I ordered Hugo.

It blew me away.

Martin Sorcese has done a masterful job of creating a story with layers; layers that get uncovered slowly, building up suspense in a fun and enjoyable way. We actually get to LEARN things as the movie progresses, instead of just staring at the screen and getting our brains turned to mush. Sasha Baron Cohen gives the performance of a lifetime as the Station Inspector.

Most certainly of all, Sorcese has integrated the 3D technique into the story itself: I could probably watch Hugo in standard Blu-Ray or DVD if I had to, but a lot of the story is lost in it. You have to see this movie in 3D to truly appreciate the wonder of it all. In fact, I actually did something I haven't done while watching a movie in years: I lost track of time, completely engrossed in what I was experiencing on screen.

When it's all said and done, I wish more movies were made just like this. Hugo is a timeless masterpiece for movie fans and history fans alike; and everyone from little kids to the elderly will enjoy it thoroughly.",1341446400,,1422,4.350943396226415

4957499,1,B0064YON8G,"When I saw the trailer for Hugo I was unmoved. I had heard that Scorsese was working on a mysterious project called ""Hugo Cabret"" and that it was a ""cubistic"" 3D film set in Paris in the early 20th century. Sounds cool. Well, the ""Cabret"" had been dropped for the more family-friendly, if not moronic sounding, ""Hugo""-- The new Pixar film about a baby Hippopotamus? Nope, but could be. Watching the trailer, I waited to be interested in something, anything, but it never came. The child star in the lead looked more suited to texting in the back of his parents luxury SUV than playing a 1930's waif. And don't tell me it can't be done: Charlie Korsmo (remember him?) actually looked like a kid from the 30's in Dick Tracy. There are just types more suited than others for certain things, but hindsight is 20/20, and Asa Butterfield was cast. Something about a creepy robot and a key and it all looked rather uninteresting from the trailer and I sort of wrote it off for what it was.

Then when it came to theaters and people were raving, I had an afternoon free and I had never seen a 3D film in the theater yet, so I decided to give it a chance. Was my original impression from the trailer correct or wrong? Was it in fact a fabulous film that somehow just didn't translate to the truncated trailer form? Oh how I wish. Instead I was subjected to a 2 hour ride in a dentist chair. Asa Butterfield did exhibit some waif traits that were not apparent in the trailer, I'll give it that. But any real filmmaking qualities were quickly swallowed up by the synthetic CGI and 3D experience. The 3D was cool for awhile, but then it just became a distraction: little floating dust particles in the air, lots of scenes with snow; as with CGI, 3D just seems another distraction for the filmmakers who should be worried about making a good movie, not adding little digital bits here, there, and everywhere.

And what are real filmmaking qualities? Well,let's start with the waif. The film inched oh so desperately toward entertaining when Sasha Baron Cohen started putting orphans into cages, but then it fell back exhausted to more floating dustparticles, animated clockworks, and snow. Remember the 70's? Does Martin Scorsese? Before CGI a director would have jumped all over orphans in cages and made it a centerpiece to the film. Now it's just an afterthought to frantic, frenetic CGI fakeness. CGI seems to effect the actors too, imbuing them by its proximity with a fakeness as well (anybody see The Phantom Menace?). And I did guffaw when Marty tried to add some genuine Scorsese passion with Hugo's emotional speech where he becomes so impassioned he strikes a period leather upholstered chair. Again, these attempts at making a real movie amid such digital kiddy games were just pathetic at best, laughable and sad at worst.

Speaking of kiddy games, I suppose something should be said about Hugo's source material: it's based on a young adult's book aimed at the Harry Potter phenomenon. People who think this is ""Scorsese's love-letter to cinema"" are deluded. The early cinema aspect of the story exists just as springboard to add some sort of ""whimsical quality"" and get the books on bookshelves all across the country. The story of the movie reads as if it's based on a book for young adults as well: big letters = staid characterizations and slapdash plotting.

But the reason I do not believe this movie is suitable for children (or adults come to that) is the (possibly subliminal) imagery in the movie.  Not only does the film have a somewhat creepy robot that looks human (transhumanism), it also comments that the world is a machine, that we are cogs in that machine and then worse of all, it shows MANY pictures of devils and Hade's satanic creatures and dead bodies.  There is also a creepy picture of the moon appearing to spy on us and also aliens on the moon that live underneath the surface, with closer inspection of these 'aliens' we are shown the half cresent flag.  There are lots of other images, too many to mention, personally I don't want my child thinking images of the Devil are acceptable and 'entertaining'.

I was a little nervous from the trailers that perhaps the ""Station Inspector"" character would take center stage and turn this into a different type of story.  I also wasn't thrilled about the 3D element (as I'm not a big fan of 3D in movies anyway as they're often just gimmicky and can be annoying) but I can see where it was appropriate to make this particular film in 3D (since the story itself is a little bit of a commentary on the art of moviemaking).

After many months, I finally got around to renting this movie and watching it with my kids.  I must say that the art of movie making was definitely alive here.  We didn't watch it in 3D and I was glad to say that even though there were numerous shots that were obviously taking advantage of the 3D elements, I didn't find these moments distracting or gimmicky.

My fears with the Station Inspector were somewhat founded.  With Sacha Baron Cohen taking on the role of the Inspector, it was almost inevitable that the role would be larger than it was in the book.  This meant adding in plot elements and scenes that weren't part of the original story and trying to make them feel like natural appendages.  Again, I was glad to see the new treatment handled well.  I was mostly worried about the Station Inspector becoming so ""over the top"" and crazy as to distract from the subtler emotionally stirring threads of the story.  Fortunately even though the Station Inspector was quirky and intense, he wasn't so distracting as to break apart the other elements of the story.  I felt that the expanded scenes for the Inspector were well done and added fun new vignettes.

I found the movie presentation of the story wonderfully endearing and heartfelt.  However it felt like it lost some of the immersive emotional nature that I felt in the book.  With the book the chapters were short and fast paced, interspersed with gorgeous artwork to complement the story.  The movie I think tried to do some of that with the great scenery and costume work as well as the 3D, but for some reason it just didn't draw me in as much as the book.  I felt like Ben Kingsley was great (granted, I've always enjoyed his acting) and I really liked the young actors who played Hugo and Isabelle.

Overall I felt like the production value was great, the story was good and the acting and directing were good.  But in taking this movie from the page to the screen, it just didn't feel as  fresh and engaging to me.  I wonder if I might feel the same in re-reading the book...maybe so.  Still, I can recommend this as a touching and fun movie to watch.  It's family friendly, has some fun characters and adventure, and even mixes in some interesting educational and emotional twists.  For my money, I think I'd rather read the book.  But you wouldn't have to twist my arm too much to watch the movie again either.

4957528,2,B0064YON8G,"First off, Martin Scorsese is a great director.  His innate ability to make a memorable scene, or give new visual dimension to an otherwise flat character is a real gift in the world of filmmaking.  I am always mesmerized by the viceral black and white fights (both verbal and physical) in Raging Bull and the gritty verisimilitude of the urban crime drama in The Departed.  Scorsese makes us believe the characters are real and the world they exist in is real.

Hugo was not real.

Initially, Hugo felt like it should've been filmed on location in France with french actors and english subtitles.  Heck, it would've been better as a foreign film that gets some foreign award no one cares about like at Cannes.

But this is an American-made movie.  And Americans have to share their plight about not making enough money with the world.

Hugo was one big ""The More You Know.""  Just like if ET would've gone back to the ship in the first 5 minutes, Martin should've been in our face saying, ""You know, directors do a lot of stuff and barely get recognized for it.  Next time you're at the Oscars, don't think about Scarlett Johansson's rack, think of me.""
Both actions would've saved lives and countless hours.

The smartest person in the entire film was Sasha Baron von Cohen -- or Borat.  Whatever his name is.  He actually understood that this movie was a facade for some Hollywood sympathy appeal and kept his character a bumbling comic relief.  The movie would've been at least tolerable if he was the main character struggling to date the flower lady and had Hugo as a wingman....

...Until the boy gets hit by a train and the stress of the war comes back to him as he holds Hugo's lifeless body in his arms.  Hugo would represent the loss of youth and innocence, Borat would fall into a deep despair and only the flower lady would save him.  It could be a tragic romance or dark comedy.

Either way, it would earn an Oscar instead of requesting one.",1339718400,3,1954,4.54727793696275

Hey, it's not the first bad use of four bucks I've made.

It was Scorcese's imprimatur that convinced me to watch it. I did not recognize his touch in any of those fifteen minutes I endured.

4957585,3,B0064YON8G,"Great idea for a film. I loved the general gist of the story -- the lesson if one likes -- if I sit back and think about it. As presented, the build up to ""the secret"" was sort of overdone. Pre-secret and post-secret material hung together awkwardly in my opinion.

Also I loved the general ambience of Paris subway station buzzing with characters and local period color and all the gears etc. Wish I could give this film 5 stars for atmosphere and concept.

But I can't. The acting tended to be stiff. The child actors needed to be either different kids or have a different director. Some of the adults did not appear to even be trying. I don't want to be too harsh, because I did more or less enjoy the film and what it was trying to do. I might even keep it.

It seemed that a lot could have been spiced up where people were just talking with each other. I agree that it was on the whole too slow. A lot could have been cut. Even a few chase scenes through parisian crowds were uninteresting and I used fast forward.

4957589,5,B0064YON8G,"More than any other living filmmaker, Martin Scorcese approaches movies with a pure and loving heart and the commitment of an artist who simply could not do anything else. He puts everything on the line and gets outstanding  performances from his actors in every movie he makes, whether a masterwork like ""Goodfellas"" or an interesting-but-flawed detour like ""New York New York."" He does not beg for awards, pander to the box office, or make throw-aways for paychecks.

After decades of sex, drugs, rock-n-roll and stunningly operatic violence, he proves himself master of yet another genre, the family fantasy. Hugo, an orphaned clock maker's son who's perhaps nine or ten years old, lives alone in the secret passages of the old Gare Montparnasse in Paris in the early 1930s. He keeps the station clocks running, steals bread off caterer's trolleys, and steals parts from a toymaker's shop in the station to try to complete the repairs his deceased father had started on an old automaton, all the while dodging the efforts of the station inspector and his Doberman to catch Hugo and send him to an orphanage. Hugo's struggle to survive and fix the automaton lead him into the world of the pioneers of silent film, particularly to the work of Georges Melies who essentially invented science fiction and fantasy movies. Scorcese's admirable passion for film history and preservation lead him into a bit of story-slowing pedantry, but it's a minor flaw in a gorgeous, charming film that sensitively captures the dreams, fears and longings of children.

Observant adults will enjoy some visual surprises that pass so quickly they're almost subliminal. James Joyce is seated at a cafe in the station, and isn't that Johnny Depp playing in a Django Reinhardt style band? Children  will enjoy the child's-eye perspective and fast-paced adventure. Everyone can appreciate this love letter that extols the power of the movies to entertain and enchant us and the gifts of those who make them.",1338681600,,1984,5.058103975535168
4957590,3,B0064YON8G,"The themes that Martin Scorsese addresses in this film--the thin line between self-recrimination and nostalgia, the effects of advancing technology on thriving art forms, and the lasting effects of a father's love--would seem misguided in a typical children's film. ""Hugo,"" however, a children's film directed by Scorsese--one of the greatest American film directors of all time (""Taxi Driver,"" ""Goodfellas,"" ""The Aviator,"" ""Raging Bull,"" ""The Departed"")--is no typical children's film. Scorsese has made a children's film for adults who still experience the joys, wonders, mysteries, and painful epiphanies of childhood.

First of all, the ""exotic"" setting of a 1930s Parisian train station establishes the wistful tone. The film is beautiful to behold--the colors, the cinematography, the set design, and the art direction are all stunningly beautiful. The plot itself focuses on the titular hero, a young boy who lives in the rafters and bowels of the station and spends his time adjusting the station's numerous clocks, evading the menacing pursuit of the Station Inspector (played by an appropriately surly Sacha Baron Cohen), and searching for parts that animate the automaton left to him by his dead father (played by Jude Law in an unfortunately brief appearance). Through the course of his quest, Hugo encounters an elderly shopkeeper (Ben Kingsley in another masterful performance), the shopkeeper's god-daughter, and a film historian. Through these connections, Hugo begins to piece together not only the mystery of the automaton but also the impact of the beginnings of cinema as an art form.

The film is sumptuous, the plot is charming, the actors are magnificent--yet somehow the film amounts to far less than the sum of its parts. I found myself bored at many points during the film--the story seems to linger a bit too much, allowing the viewer to appreciate (almost excessively so) the aesthetic and nostalgic beauty of the film.

4957609,5,B0064YON8G,"""Are you sure about this? We could get into trouble!""
""That's how you know it's an adventure.""

I was given a copy of The Invention of Hugo Cabret by a professor last fall. While I did leaf through it, I never got the chance to read it because of my iron-heavy workload. When Christmas came, I gave it to my younger brother, and didn't think about it until he asked me to go see the Hugo movie with him this Thanksgiving. The first thing I thought of, sitting down in the theater with Luke and my father, was, ""Wait, Scorsese directed this?""

That didn't occur to me again until the credits finally rolled. I was totally entranced by Hugo, utterly wrapped within its tiny world. Asa Butterfield, who plays the titular Hugo Cabret, does a splendid job, and so does nearly every other face in the film. Indeed, this movie has an excellent cast; Sasha Baron Cohen is a misguided but loveable Station Manager, Christopher Lee is a suspicious but kind librarian, and Ben Kingsley... well, I'll let you find that out for yourself.

My father opted to pay the extra few bucks to get us into the 3d version of the film. The movie has been hailed as ""the best 3d experience since Avatar,"" and having seen a few 3d movies myself, I think that's a pretty good appraisal. I'm no fan of 3d, but Scorsese's team has done an excellent job with this. The 3d a constant in the movie, and very, very rarely devolves to the typical ""in your face"" kinds of scenes we've come to expect from a 3d movie. Rather, there are subtle differences between where characters are perceived to be standing, small edges that stick out towards the audience (like tables, corners, etc), and a fair amount of swooshing snow. Somehow, Scorsese managed to keep enough color in the film to keep it from appearing ""washed out"" as many 3d flicks seem to (Captain America: The First Avenger suffered hard from this problem). If you can see it in 3d, I strongly recommend it.

Now, I'd like to mention colors for a moment. As a gamer, I often find myself playing games that are devoid of color; they're muddy, brown-washed affairs that distract with fast-paced gameplay, but when the action slows down, you realize you're looking at a rather bland fare. Hugo is actually quite color-muted through much of the runtime. Given that the movie is a love letter to silent movies, this makes sense. But where there is color, it is vibrant and beautifully placed. Flowers pop, the rich old books in Christopher Lee's library snap, and Asa Butterfield's eyes burn out at the viewer with incredible blue. Scorsese's employment of color in the movie really helps build a sense of immediacy and concrete verisimilitude to the things on screen.

I've mentioned it before, but Butterfield's acting is amazing. He delivers Hugo's lines with a sobering reality absent in many actors five times his age. There is a distinct sense of keen sadness in his eyes, but a longing to be loved in the way he speaks not only his friend Isabelle, but also to Ben Kingsley's Papa George, even as the old man practically abuses him. There's no way to avoid falling in love with Hugo Cabret; Asa Butterfield summons him so thoroughly you wish you could adopt him.

The same is true for Kingsley. He plays a worn-down old toymaker with no patience or love left for Hugo's thieving. As the movie explores his past, Kingsley's role in the movie takes unexpected twists and he too becomes so real that, with the 3d technology working its wonders, it doesn't seem hard to believe you might reach out and put a hand on his shoulder. Together, Butterfield and Kingsley are a joy to watch, and watching Hugo explore Papa George's mysterious past is artfully done.

The actors do an incredible job of bringing Selznik's tale to life. Hugo's plot is an unbelievably tightly-knit tale. Having no knowledge of the book going into it, I was floored by how everything seemed to come together, like some big machine (a motif in the movie to watch for). There are several side-plots that Scorsese might have easily bungled or over-cooked, but as the movie progresses these too come together to add to the story's climax. Watching the other frequenters of the Paris train station grow is part of the fun of the movie; we see people fall in love, dogs learn to get along, and even a police officer get his possibly-cheating wife back.

I doubt much of these intricacies would impinge on a child's experience, however; these are events that occur beyond Hugo and Isabelle and the magic of the train station. They are beyond Hugo's little automaton with its missing heart, and outside of Papa George's toy shop, but to an adult viewer, both my father and I were impressed. Hugo might easily have been just a kid's movie that we saw to humor my brother's interest in the book, but instead we were treated to a movie that we both understood on different levels. My father, being, well, a father, was able to take home a totally different impression than I the one that I as a writer received. The wide personalities and interests that Hugo speaks to is remarkable; this is one of those rare whole-family films that keeps dad, big-brother and kid-brother all engaged and tense throughout. And I mean that; my dad stayed awake through the entire thing. That's a feat!

My father tells me the Selznik family has been a part of the moviemaking industry for decades. I'm inclined to believe him, and if he's right, the celebration of moviemaking history makes total sense. Hugo is a love letter from Selznik and Scorsese to the movies. It captures the magic and possibilities that the silver screen offers beautifully, and even tragically. Watching it all come together like clockwork is, well, to quote Hugo's father, ""Like watching your dreams come true.""

For the unprepared viewer--by which I mean a viewer who hasn't read the book--don't feel like you can't see the movie. There is a lot to love about Hugo that is rooted solely in the adaptation, because Scorsese is a master at his craft and this is a film that was lovingly created. The plot is far more complex than you'd expect from a kid's movie; I hesitate to speak at all to it, because I fear it would be rude to spoil such a delightful surprise. But settle for the fact that it is both deep and rich; Hugo is full of the unexpected. Though it lacks sex, violence, and gunfights (staples of American cinema these days,) you won't be bored. Hugo is populated by a memorable cast that grips so hard the real world pales, and it is shot so well in 3d that I declare it should be an example to all those that come after it.

If you have a kid, grab them and treat them to Hugo. Treat yourself. This is a movie that demands an audience, and then spoils them. Its sharp polish and distinct sense of self are incredible to behold on the big screen, and the plot is so well written and acted that it will keep you thinking about it long after the credits have rolled and the lights have come on.

4957610,3,B0064YON8G,"First thing is the visuals of all the giant clockwork machinery looks really good.  The first 90-100 minutes of the movie are slow though and it isn't till that 90-100 minute point that there is an actual emotional connection achieved with the characters.  Most of the acting consists of close up shows of the boy's face and having him stare wide blue-eyed at something.  Characters in the movie are pretty flat.  Not sure if this is a result of the acting or of the writing.  Certainly, the inspector character is quite tiresome and very dully / poorly acted.  Additionally some of the periphery characters such as the two with dogs, or the flower girl are as about as cardboard cut-out as you can get.  Certainly a little better writing could have gone into these characters.  It is also a little disturbing that the movie was set in Paris, but everyone is speaking English.

Performances are sterling and interesting, especially those of Ben Kingsly and Sacha Baron Cohen.  The cinematic disciplines of direction, editing, photography, etc. are all nicely in place, and the production design is truly awe inspiring.  Of special interest is the re-telling of the true story of one of the cinema's
great early pioneers, George Melies.

However, herein lies a problem.  To me Hugo is two films joined together in one package... a story of a boy longing for his dead father, and the story of George Melies.  Both are involving, but the boy's
story gets lost midstream in Melies' story, and both suffer accordingly.  While there is still abundant magic, humor and excitement in both of these tales, all of this is somewhat diluted when the two stories are combined in this particular telling by one of our stellar film directors.  While this film is definitely a worthwhile audience experience--especially in 3D-- in retrospect I agree with my son that it might have been better if Spielberg had directed Hugo while Scorsese directed War Horse.",1337558400,4,1151,5.052910052910053

The side plots with the shopkeepers and the flower girl/gendarme were, as with the rest of the film, predictable, sloow, and poorly written.

The book's ending was so absurd that I thought the movie must have a different ending since it was receiving such good reviews.  Wrong! The movie is as silly as the book plus some. Ben Kingsley's character, George Melies, is distraught when, after the first world war, his films are no longer popular among returning soldiers who have witnessed the horrors of war. Does this realization cause him to gain perspective on life or make new films to appeal to this more sophisticated/hardened audience? No. It turns him into a depressed bully who spends decades lamenting his lack of popularity until he's rediscovered and appreciated. Instead of sympathy for the orphaned boy, it's all about what each of the characters can do to boost Melies' self-esteem.

4957661,2,B0064YON8G,"My favorite Scorsese films (Mean Streets; Taxi Driver; The King of Comedy; Goodfellas) have always felt 'non-Hollywood' to me; my least favorite (Gangs of New York; The Aviator; The Departed; Shutter Island) seem to be the most conventional and reliant on Hollywood formula. Not all formulaic films are bad. The King's Speech is one of the most typical Hollywood films to come along in years and it's still a pleasure to watch (though a bit sappy).

No films are perfect, unless they are perfectly bad. Of course, there is something joyful about watching a perfectly bad film (Plan 9 from Outer Space; Attack of the 50 Foot Woman). When a film tries it's hardest to do more and fails considerably, it can become aggravating. Scorsese's Hugo is not technically a bad film. On the other hand, it's not a good one either. It falls short on so many levels it's hard to even give it a fair estimation without sounding like a cynic. For starters: it's clumsy. It's filled with more CGI than an average live-action outing and if it weren't for the human actors who populate it, I would say it felt almost totally animated along The Polar Express lines. For a kids film, there is little or no sense of wonder or adventure in it. Hugo gets chased by an orphan-obsessed station inspector (with a leg that symbolically reminded me of von Rauffenstein's neck brace in Grand Illusion) and that's about it. There are many symbolic references (intentional or otherwise) in Hugo. So much so, I began to wonder what was actually original about the film. I also began to wonder exactly how and why Scorsese sold out yet again to the establishment.

A rough, challenging film like Taxi Driver or a sweet, introspective one like Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore aren't going to do well at the cineplex -- unless they are made by Martin Scorsese. There's the rub. Scorsese has a built-in audience (and critics cheering squad) regardless of what he does. He's also spent the better part of the last two decades making conventional, indirect films that seem like they could have been directed by, well...anyone. When he made Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, it stuck out as an anomaly in his early career because it had a central female protagonist. Hugo is another anomaly, simply because it's a kids film. The big difference between the two movies is Alice seemed to defy convention and refused to be a weepy women's issue picture. Hugo on the other hand strives to be a personal story of abandonment and redemption as well as grand historical fantasy. While it flirts relentlessly with these ambitions, it never really grabs on to any of them. It never really picks up enough steam. Worse yet, the film contains several moments that even an amateur film-maker might have rethought or simply avoided. There is a scene in which Chlo Grace Moretz gets knocked down in the train station and is almost trampled by a hoard of passengers. The problem occurs when her perspective changes to a bizarre camera angle looking directly up toward the ceiling as the shoes of the mob seemingly walk flatly over a sheet of glass on top of her. My only guess is this looked way less-effective in the 2D version I was watching than it did in the 3D manner for which it was shot. The argument for selling out or not seems to end right there. There were obvious '3D moments' in the far superior Tin Tin but they never distracted from that films story.

There is a lot of talk about movies in Hugo. So much so that I began to forget about the titular protagonist altogether. Scorsese injects the film with a kind of remedial silent film history that can only be meant to enthrall an adult audience with the vaguest of notions regarding these staples of TCM and film class syllabi. I don't need a full-blown documentary on the subject (though it is one of the few things Scorsese actually seems to be artistically successful at these days, especially with his George Harrison: Living in the Material World) but I kept wondering: what does this much film history have to do with Hugo's story? Hugo is not the main character of this film like he is in the source book. That's fine, but changing horses like that midstream, from orphaned boy on a quest to bitter old reclusive film-maker (Georges Mlis) feeling unloved or jilted was more jarring than the conflicting CGI environments -- especially when Hugo does very little other than going through motions to inadvertently help the old filmmaker. The film struggles to find it's center and leans too heavily toward the cause of film preservation than it should. By the end, we are beat over our heads to death with it.

The truth is, I still don't know if Scorsese has become a total sell-out. I'm also not going to begin telling you how Hugo could (or should) have been a better film. I will say that had they stuck to the tone of the book (even just in spirit) it might have been a more satisfying experience. Also, there's a little gimmick used in Hugo that I picked up on after seeing a Woody Allen film once -- if a character in a film says something like: ""Happy endings only happen in the movies"" -- you can best be sure that the film you are watching is going to contain one of those same patented happy endings. If anything, Hugo's greatest contribution would seem it's an excellent primer on the well-known and highly regarded work of Georges Mlis. This film really only acts as a reminder that not all artists are as consistently and vigorously celebrated as Scorsese in their own day. I doubt that I will think too much about Hugo in the future. It's already sort of subsided into that 'curious failures' trunk in my mind. Like the unnatural-looking and awkwardly conceived CGI train-wreck that occurs in Hugo's dream -- Scorsese continues his streak of pure Hollywood hokum. As long as he keeps waving his baton to the masses, the longer his orchestra will seem out of tune.",1336694400,4,5893,4.658021133525456
4957662,3,B0064YON8G,"""Hugo"" based on the popular kid's novel is an odd film; its not a project I would expect Martin Scorsese to helm but I have to give him credit for trying such an unusual project given his past films (Taxi Driver [Blu-ray], GoodFellas [Blu-ray]) and stretching himself as an artist with a genre he's never tackled before--a fantasy children's film.

SPOILERS:

Hugo (Asa Butterfield) the orphaned son of a clockmaker (Jude Law) lives above the train station in Paris tending to the large clock. Hugo tries to unravel the mystery of an automaton that his father was working on just before his death and spars with the bitter owner of a small gift shop named Melies (Ben Kingsley)while on the run run from the station inspector (Sasha Baron Cohen). Hugo finds an unlikely ally in Isabelle (Chlo Grace Moretz from Let Me In [Blu-ray])as they search for the key that will wind up the automaton so they can discover what, exactly, it was designed for.

END OF SPOILERS:

A movie that is as much about the history of film, the redemption of Melies and who, exactly, build the automaton, Scorsese creates a lush, lovely looking film filled with some truly stunning set pieces (particularly a computer generated train crash that looks amazing)but is undone by the languid pacing of the film which fails to generate much suspense. While I didn't expect the attention deficit cutting style of, say, Michael Bay, I did expect a more involving experience.

The screenplay by John Logan (based on the book The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick)fails to generate characters with much depth (beyond Melies and even then he comes across as just a grumpy ""get off of my lawn"" old man who wants nothing more than to nail Hugo). Certainly Hugo is portrayed sympathetically he is, after all, an orphan and, at times, a bit of a scamp always trying to find food and stay off the radar of the station inspector who is always looking to catch a stray kid.

The truth is that I found little in ""Hugo"" to identify with and my kids just couldn't appreciate the fantasy elements of the film. Visually rich, ""Hugo"" only has the wisp of a plot to hang the rest of the film on. While the performances are solid throughout by the actors, Logan's script uses cliched characters that just don't draw us in.

I was a bit disappointed that we didn't get a commentary track from director Scorsese. His insights on what appealed to him about the project, shooting it and the challenges of taking a popular children's book and adapting it to the big screen would have been interesting.

We get four featurettes on the production of the film and a fifth one that's a bit of a joke about actor/comedian Sasha Baron Cohen. The making of featurette provides little insight into the making of the film. ""The Cinemagician, Georges Mlis"" is the best of the featurettes giving us a bit of insight into the cinematic world of the talented, groundbreaking visionary and brilliant filmmaker who almost ended up forgotten by many due to the fact that his films weren't in circulation for a long period of time.

The featurette on the visual effects is pretty fascinating glimpse into the creation of the train crash scene. Finally the featurette on the automaton and their popularity during the late part of the 19th and early part of the 20th century is a pretty interesting glimpse into these robotic devices.

Given all the praise the movie received, I'm surprised that there aren't more special features as part of this set (given that most are produced prior to the release of a film).

Rather than do a blind buy, I'd recommend renting ""Hugo"" first to see if it's a film that appeals to your sensibility. I would approach the film without expectations (given Scorsese's name that may not be possible but try) and, perhaps, you'll enjoy it a bit more than I and my kids did. With all the praise the film received (which honestly was difficult to ignore), perhaps I was blinded to the appeal of ""Hugo"". I suspect I'll have to try it again after a little while to see if my take on the material divorced of expectations were inaccurate and colored my view on the film.

I'd recommend going with the Blu-ray if you decide to pick this up because although the DVD looks nice it just doesn't do justice to the rich, lush look of the film.",1336608000,4,4296,4.653034300791557

There weren't any OOS (out of screen) effects that I could see but the 3D was outstanding nonetheless. From the sweeping views of Paris in the opening scenes to action shots in the train station with a dog and gendarme chasing Hugo to a train coming toward you, Martin Scorsese uses some of the best cinematography I've seen in the making of this film. The fact that it was originally filmed in 3D rather than having the effects added later is probably a reason that it looked so well done.  The scenes in Paris were beautiful.

The story is about a young orphan, Hugo, played by Asa Butterfield, who lives in a train station in Paris in the 1930's and takes care of maintaining the clocks after his drunken uncle, Claude, played by Ray Winstone disappears. Hugo was close to his dad, played by Jude Law, before he is killed in a museum fire. He has to steal food from the local vendors in order to survive and he spends a lot of his time trying to repair an automaton, kind of a robot, that his dad brought home from the museum before he died. Papa Georges, played very convincingly by Ben Kingsley, puts Hugo to work for him to pay off his debt for stealing parts for the automaton. A girl his age named Isabelle, played by Chlo Grace Moretz, ends up helping Hugo. The acting is superb and the story, if a little predictable at times, is still a good one.

My main reason for purchasing this movie was to try out the 3D using passive 3D lenses, with a new TV. It was a good choice for a first movie because it gave a glimpse of what is possible and how good 3D movie making can be.",1336003200,2,1666,4.2993630573248405

4957681,5,B0064YON8G,"Interestingly, The Internet Movie Database contains numerous bad reviews of this film by its ""users.""  What seems to be the trouble is that this extremely detailed little picture was advertised as a big adventure film (which in its own way, it is), but those movie fans who go chiefly for that sort of thing were disappointed that it is actually a historical timepiece. It's an homage to cinema in which the main adventure is within a small story about the early days of movie making, the imagination and wonder of a child, and the awakening of a broken old man who was once a great artiste.  Far from being ""shallow"" as more than one reviewer complained, this film is quite the opposite.  Sometimes I think audiences have been spoiled by action pictures spiced with plenty of sex and violence (and Scorsese has directed his fair share of this kind of movie) -- this film has none of the former, and very little of the latter, yet if one just relaxes and lets it unfold at its own pace, there are layers of discovery available to an opened mind and heart. There are numerous visual references throughout, all of which anchor this story in a particular place and time, with literary and artistic characters planted among the crowds, that if one is either uneducated or inattentive might go unnoticed, and other character vignettes that have nothing to do with the main plot, but which give this unique picture its delicious flavors.  I did not see the movie in 3-D, and frankly, it's great without it, because it doesn't really need a gimmick!  There is a glorious, golden glow about this beautifully designed location, a train station in Paris, that is reminiscent of the animated picture, RATATOUILLE, and indeed, much of the scenery is digitally created or enhanced; however, much of the setting is real, built scenery, and the colors are hyped just enough to give it the magical look it has.

The acting by all the principles is fine, if not outstanding, but the most surprising turn was made by Sacha Baron Cohen, an actor I'm not normally fond of.  As a policeman who was wounded in World War I and has a mechanical contraption supporting one leg, he is uncomfortable and stiff in his uniform, and seems to be unfamiliar with smiling.  Negative reviewers complained about Sacha's performance, but HE wasn't wooden, his CHARACTER was ... that is, until he is helped by another character to overcome his painful shyness and open up to a flower girl he's attracted to.  There is comedy in Cohen's performance, but I did not laugh AT the character, which is one reason this nuanced bit of acting deserves notice.  The lead actor, Asa Butterfield, has striking blue eyes, and the clothes the orphan he plays, Hugo, is still wearing, but has outgrown, were a wonderful, realistic touch.  Kingsley is his usual, brilliant self as Georges Mlies, and the other main character, the girl who befriends Hugo, Chlo Grace Moretz, is a real find.  Helen McCrory is truly charming as George's wife and former muse, as are three real dogs, who have as much character as any human -- yet, although this movie is based on a children's book, I found it to be sophisticated and adult.

I think it was trying to become lengthier than the movie Ghandi.  The special effects were fantastic, and the music soundtracks were pleasant.  There is a lot of good things to say about the movie, but at the same time it was like watching a political push for movie preservation or an all day Jerry Lewis telethon.

But, this is ostensibly Hugo's film, so we see it through his eyes, hiding up in the steel trusses of Paris' grand train station, where he tries to reassemble the missing pieces of an automaton left behind by his departed father.

It's the sort of pretentious, self-important style that makes certain people who think they are cool cinephiles swoon, but it doesn't mean the movie itself is actually a masterpiece.

On the plus side, the film history information was interesting, and Sacha Baron Cohen and Ben Kingsley were engaging to watch. But the film never really gels.

4957688,2,B0064YON8G,"Beautiful film - yes. But the story? Without giving anything away, I guess all I can say is that it starts off in one direction, skids sideways into another direction, and then totally jumps the rails into a plot that ends up having little or nothing to do with what you thought was going on. And while in some films this is a really good thing - in this one there is no big reveal, no big amazing denouement, just switching gears for the sake of switching gears. There was no real character development, so no real affection for the characters. Bored enough to wander off and start playing Facebook games, and completely unthrilled by the ending. Sorry.

4957691,5,B0064YON8G,"As Martin Scorsese enters the twilight of his career he continues to challenge himself as an artist and challenging the audience along with him.  I can think of three primary goals Scorsese had in mind making ""Hugo"".  Firstly he wanted to advance the 3-D technological process but in turn he imbued it with heart that distinguishes ""Hugo"" from ""Transformers"" and their ilk.  Secondly he wanted to make a family film that not only engages the children but allows adults to appreciate the subtleties.  Lastly he wanted to promote his pet cause of film preservation and in turn resurrecting the legacy of French silent filmmaker George Melies.  Scorsese has assembled an impressive cast but special mention should be made for the youngest actors, Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz, whose work here belies their tender years.  There are innumerable riches that can be mined in ""Hugo"".  The star rating system does it no justice.  ""Hugo"" is an instant classic.",1335484800,,960,5.031645569620253
4957692,4,B0064YON8G,"Melding elements of both Oliver Twist and the Artful Dodger into a single character, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is a homeless orphan who lives surreptitiously inside a great train station in Paris circa 1931. To assuage his loneliness and to give some purpose to his life, he fixes and maintains the station's many elaborate time-pieces - and, to survive, he furtively steals food from the local vendors selling their wares there.

A life-affirming departure for the normally dark and brooding Martin Scorsese, ""Hugo"" is such a beautifully crafted work of commercial cinema that I feel a trifle ungrateful for not actually liking it more - though, more accurately perhaps, I should say that I love the final third of the film but have some reservations about what comes before. It is certainly a wonder to behold in terms of its art direction and scenic design, which together help to create a never-never world of Art Deco architecture and breathtaking cityscapes, where the surreal and the real comfortably meet - a fitting visual correlative, as it turns out, for the theme of the film. And it goes without saying that the movie richly merited each of the many awards it earned for its visual accomplishments.

Adapted by John Logan from the Brian Selznick novel, ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret,"" ""Hugo"" is at its most magical when it is reveling in and celebrating the pioneer days of filmmaking, particularly the fantastical works of magician and special effects wizard Georges Melies (""A Trip to the Moon""), who is an actual character in the movie (played by Ben Kingsley). It seems, according to the story, that Melies left filmmaking an embittered, forgotten has-been and now owns a toy booth in the very train station that Hugo calls home. One fateful day, Hugo and Melies' paths cross - and so the adventure begins...

Given all these quality elements, what then are my objections to the film? Primarily, they rest in the fact that, as a central figure, Hugo is too lacking in fire and passion to generate much interest for the audience; that the secondary characters - particularly Sacha Baron Cohen as a war-ravaged security guard - come across more as live-action cartoon figures than as real people; and that the storytelling and pacing in the first half of the film often lag behind the visual stimulation. All these work as distancing devices that keep us from becoming as fully engaged in the plot and the world of the film as we perhaps would like to - until the last third, that is.

And that final third winds up making all the difference, as it brings together the movie's disparate elements into a unifying theme of fixing that which is broken - be it a mechanical device or the human heart. This theme is reflected in the film's visual motif of endless machines, both those that are functional and those that are in need of repair.  And Scorsese's meticulous re-creation of Melies' classic works is indeed a wonder to behold.

There is one glaring anachronism, however: though the story is set in 1931, Hugo at one point makes reference to having seen Errol Flynn in ""Robin Hood,"" a movie that wasn't released until 1938!  A prescient kid, that Hugo.",1335484800,,3175,4.825367647058823
4957693,5,B0064YON8G,"I went into Hugo knowing very little about it, which can either be a really fun way to watch a movie or it could be a huge mistake. Luckily for me in this case, it was a great thing. The Martin Scorsese-directed family movie ended up being a great time at the movies with a fascinating, and partly true, story.

Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is a young orphan boy living alone after his father passes away (and later his uncle). He maintains the clocks within the walls of a Paris train station, stealing food as needed. He eventually meets a grumpy old man (Ben Kingsley) who owns a toy shop at the station as well as the man's goddaughter (Chlo Moretz). The two youngsters go on a few adventures, one including an automaton left by Hugo's father which he believes contains a message.

The few facts I knew about the film were mainly revolving around the fact that it was a family adventure movie. About half way through the film though, the topics of early film production and preservation come into play. Much reminiscent of Cinema Paradiso, Hugo has a lot of film spirit that any movie lover will appreciate. The scenes involving both clips of old movies and the characters' memories and thoughts on film make the viewer appreciate what the movies are really about.

The acting is all-around well done. The surprise standout for me was Sacha Baron Cohen as the Station Inspector. The two young leads are just incredible and believable, and it goes without saying that Ben Kingsley did a wonderful job as the legendary Georges Mlis. There are also a few characters placed around the train station that make everything so much more realistic and inviting. From an older fellow trying to swoon a woman (even though her dog doesn't approve) to a quiet and charming flower shop girl...there are small details and people that, while they seem minor, without them the movie wouldn't be the same.

Hugo really is a fun movie and a great experience. I had no choice but to watch it in 3D at the theater, which I probably could have done without (though a few scenes did look awesome in 3D) but it still didn't take anything away form the whole experience. The music, classic film clips, and performances are not to be missed. It's got the spirit and enthusiasm that a family movie should have. This one really makes you not only appreciate film, but those close to you as well.

4957707,2,B0064YON8G,"First off this movie is visually stunning even when the sets don't make total sense.  For instance the internal workings of the clock rooms.  It's gorgeous but nevertheless a nonsensical conglomeration of twirly gears and other spinning bits.  Let's also not get into how the robot works.  Why does it need to ""look"" at what it's drawing??
Second, this movie seems to drag on, with really only one interesting plot element that takes f-o-r-e-v-e-r to get to.
Third, personally I'm really sick of the gratuitous English accents in movies. Fine if it's James Bond or a movie based in the UK, but this movie is based in Paris! I guess the ignorant American audience couldn't possibly handle French accents!  Chlo Moretz's accent is particularly annoying.  She was born in Atlanta for chrissakes!
Forth, can we move on from the actors with the big blue googly eyes!  Eliji Woods, though fantastic as Frodo Baggins, killed that one.
Fifth, the link between the core theme of the movie and actually making movies is weak at best.  But at least I now understand why it got so many votes from the Academy.

Anyhow, that's why I got myself a 3D TV with 3D Blu Ray. I got quite a bunch of 3D movies, starting with ""Daybreakers"" and animation flicks like the Toy Story Collection and stuff. But... by far the best is this: Hugo! Not only is the use of 3D technology amazing thanks to director Martin Scorsese and Director of photograph Robert Richardson but also the story. It's a timeless story about the meaning of live, filled with the passion of one of the best directors currently alive! All the details within this movie come out even better thanks to 3D. By far: the best 3D movie ever... yes.. even better - not to say far better - than Avatar...!

This move must not be missed in any 3D home collection or by any cineast since this movie is actually a declaration of love to the history of the movies.

I must admit, this movie draws you into it with 3D mastery, from the very beginning. The style that pervades the entire movie is shown at the very beginning as the intricate gearing of a clock 'morph' into a beautiful night scene of Paris. The camera then takes you for a virtual birds-eye view of the city, progressing to the train station, taking you into a sweeping run through the station itself past passengers on the ramp....a very exhilarating trip that sets the scene very effectively.
I'll spare the readers my lame attempts at a written movie review. All I can say is, check this movie out...in 3D.

Update 6/5/2012
I just removed a star from my original review. I just watched Hugo, again, with my brother and his spouse. I realized that there are rather long stretches of this movie that drag on with little dialog or action. OK, it gets boring after awhile. I must admit I was watching it in 2D this time. If you don't have 3D TV, then I'd give this a 2 or 3 star rating. With 3D, it is worth watching, just realize that the action scenes are spaced too far apart!

One day, he gets caught by a toy maker (Sir Ben Kingsley). Little does Hugo know, this will be the start of an adventure involving robots, a strange girl named Isabel (Chloe Moretz), and movie making.

Based upon THE INVENTION OF HUGO CABRET by Brian Selznick, this family friendly film by Martin Scorcese is a feast for the eyes. The cinematography is beautiful. The locations are very much characters in their own rights; the train station, the rooms within the clock towers, and the movie sets all come alive. These alone are worth a look.

The film is also well cast. Asa Butterfield is charming without being syrupy. He was able to carry the film and interact with Sir Kingsley with ease. I liked the camaraderie with Chloe Moretz, who, by turns of the films she previously starred in (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kick-Ass/dp/B002ZG983M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kick-Ass</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Let-Me-In/dp/B004BLJQOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Let Me In</a>) gets to be a regular little girl who doesn't kill people.

I haven't read the book yet, but I was taken by surprise by the reveal about the toy maker's true identity. I was immersed in the storyline about Hugo, and then it goes into another plot line, and this plot line felt like the meatier portion of the film. There is a dream sequence which is confusing and strange. Also, there is no narrator throughout the entire film; at the end, Isabel pops in with narration. What? Minor quibbles aside, this is still a cute homage to the past and the love of filmmaking.

How they recreated the train wreck was very interesting and showed that the producer/director wanted perfection. When I saw the train wreck scene I recognized it instantly. It is a famous picture actually taken in Paris. The behind the scenes of the ""mechanical man"" is a must see. What is amazing was to find out that what I saw in the movie was not all computer generated.

4957762,2,B0064YON8G,"Since the  history of the art of motion pictures, along with the art of audio reproduction, have always been subjects of great interest to me, I would have expected this homage to the movies by Martin Scorsese to be at least engrossing if not emotionally involving.  Unhappily neither was the case.

We have a story, which is a fantasy, set in the late 1920s to the middle 1930s taking place largely in a Parisian railway station in which, curiously, all of the characters not only exclusively speak English, but with a British accent.  Dramatically the film simply never takes off as one expects it to.  Even the action (chase) scenes are curiously static and uninvolving.  The acting style and delivery of the dialogue resemble to a very large degree the first Harry Potter picture -- utterly sleep inducing.

A great effort is made to recreate the times in which the story takes place but that feeling never develops.  Visually, the film  looks very impressive and its sound recording is excellent.  Nearly every shot of Paris appears to be the result of CGI processing and everything about the ancient city looks absolutely new.  Nothing looks old or worn but appears to have been created only for this picture and intended to be discarded or erased when the film was completed.  Efforts were made to evoke the period between the Great War and World War II.  We see scenes of a group of musicians in the station with a guitarist apparently made up to resemble Django Reinhardt, but the music heard resembles romantic Parisian styles and bears no relation whatever to the jazz style for which Reinhardt was famous.  I had the distinct impression that no one in connection with the making of this film had ever heard one of Django Reinhardt's recordings.  Other recreations of historic figures pop up from time to time, as in Woody Allen's ""Midnight in Paris"" and it didn't work that well there either.

When clips or recreations from the old movies of Harold Lloyd and Georges Melies are seen, they, as usual, are shown at the current sound projection speed of 24 frames per second, while having been originally shot at an average of 16 frames per second with the result that the characters are seen running around like jumping jacks and not the way they must have been seen in theaters of the times in which the films were made.  Scorsese makes an obvious appeal for the preservation of motion pictures, something with which I entirely sympathize.  But if one observes what has been achieved in film preservation in the last twenty or thirty years, I think he need have few fears.

A few years ago I heard an interview I think on NPR, with a film screen writer or director whose name now escapes me.  He  made an interesting comparison between writing a novel and a screenplay.  He noted that when writing a novel, you can always go back and add more and more detail as the story requires, as in designing a building -- you just make it bigger if you have to.  But he said that writing a successful screenplay is like designing an airplane that must be light enough to take off and fly or it's a complete failure at what it is primarily intended to accomplish. This is the feeling I had watching ""Hugo"" -- that it was simply static with long pauses in the dialog that slowed the pacing to a fatal degree.  And I really did so want to like this picture.",1334275200,15,3356,4.611111111111111

As other people have noted, this isn't really a movie, so much as a documentary about Georges Melies, the early silent film director.

The plot is a bit haphazard, and develops painfully slowly.  I watched this with a group and most people left before it was over.

The production values are very good: I can see why it was nominated for technical areas.  But this isn't a movie for most people (including myself).

As a CG production, this movie is really nice, beautiful in certain aspects.  As a whole however, it lacks the pace and true emotional connection to make it great. Ultimately, what gets in the way is Scorcese's affection with the cinema and how it tints the whole movie by forcing HIS love of the cinema onto the viewer and expecting the audience to ""get it"". Somehow, it's a little arrogant on his part to ""demand"" that we see what he sees, feel what he feels.

I went home, took out my copy of the book and found images that had been expertly portrayed in the film.

4957863,4,B0064YON8G,"On the surface Martin Scorsese's latest film ""Hugo"" appears to be a family-oriented adventure film about a boy named Hugo following his dreams. In fact, ""Hugo"" is more like the director's love letter to cinema of old (silent movies) and new (3D technologies). And it is a very passionate one. If you remember Martin Scorsese's dedication to the movement of film preservation, it is not surprising.

Having lost his father in a fire, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is brought to the station by his uncle Claude (Ray Winstone), a clock maintainer with a bottle in his hand. While living alone inside the walls of the station, Hugo dreams of fixing an old automaton, the only thing that connects the boy to his dead father, but to do so he needs a heart-shaped key. One day he meets the very person who literally holds the key, a girl named Isabelle (Chlo Grace Moretz).

Set in the 1930s Paris, the story of ""Hugo"" slowly leads us to the past of one aged toyshop keeper and Isabelle's godfather played by Ben Kingsley. We eventually come to know who he is, uncovering his buried past memories through the eye of Hugo.

This means you are invited to the spiritual journey of an orphan boy Hugo, but Scorsese's film is not about him; Hugo is there, together with incredible coincidences and contrived storyline, so that we can share his experiences of revisiting what is once thought lost, the cinematic imagination of Georges Mlis, through the world of state-of-the-art special effects.

Thus ""Hugo"" is not an adventure film. If you think story is slow-moving and dull, and characters flat (with two exceptions Georges Mlis and his wife played by excellent Helen McCrory), that is because the real star is not Hugo; it is cinema of old days, recreated by the newest technologies. Since I like old films (my favorite is Buster Keaton, though), I give four stars, but I also think paying more attention to characters of Hugo and Isabelle, and narrative structure is not a bad idea.",1333670400,,1975,4.766081871345029
4957864,5,B0064YON8G,"My reaction to the first two minutes of ""Hugo"" was that they had more wit, humor, charm, and the sheer /pleasure/ of watching a motion picture than the whole of ""The Muppets"" (which I'd watched the day before). As several reviewers have pointed out, ""Hugo"" embodies the reasons we go to see movies -- to be moved and enchanted.

""Utterly boring""? I guess there just wasn't enough drug use, car crashes, rape, and disemboweling to hold the reviewer's attention.

I have two not-unreasonable complaints. The story starts off as a tale about an orphaned child trying to recover his life, then turns into a biography of one of motion pictures' great pioneers. The forced, ""necessary"" quality of the latter doesn't sit well with the ""poetic"" quality of the former. And the story's belief that the innocence and idealism of children are capable of redeeming adult lives is... well, wishful thinking. (""Hugo"" is hardly the first film with this belief at its core.)

Regardless, an exquisite motion-picture experience that you should not deny yourself.",1333670400,,1044,5.023121387283237

The actors became the characters they played and created a world that you instantly became immersed in.  The young actor who played HUGO was brilliant!  My husband was as emotionally involved as I and felt this was truly a worthy  story and script.  Secondly, we found this to be the most visually beautiful movie we had ever seen!

Now we rarely buy movies, but I ordered it in Blu Ray from Amazon and received both discs.  We then watched it for the second time.  I can only say that we were absoluty blown away by the blu ray version.  The movie almost looked as if it were 3D.  The crispness of the sets and color were something we have never seen in a movie before.  This is truly a movie for any age, and we are in our 60's and have no children and felt that we had just purchased a work of art to be watched and enjoyed for years to come.  This movie is unique and has set a standard for other movies to live up to as far as set design, color, acting, and the general settings and ambiance.  It is a great story, as well.  We have already had friends who had not gone to see HUGO because they thought it was a ""kids"" movie, borrow it and their response was the same as ours!  They are also buying it for their collection.  One reason to own this is simply because it is a go to movie when you want to be fully engaged in a heart warming story that is uplifting and incredibly beautiful to watch.

4957883,3,B0064YON8G,"This movie is fun to watch and easy on the eyes. It has great music and photography, a superb performance by Ben Kingsley, supported by an excellent British cast. (Including Frances de la Tour, who also appeared in two Harry Potter movies as Olympe Maxime, the giantess love interest of Rubeus Hagrid.)
There are some amazing photographic tricks: an apparently endless tracking shot all along a train platform and into the main lobby of a huge railway station. Another, where a train that is coming in too fast cannot be stopped at the end of the track, and plows through the station and ends with the engine and the first carriage hanging from the sill of the large front glass window, over the street.
That is a recreation of a famous train accident in that same Parisian station, the Gare du Nord, in Montmartre, where much of this movie takes place.
The story is, in part, centered on an important event towards the end of the life of cinema pioneer and special effects inventor extraordinaire, Georges Melies, and on a mysterious key that will set in motion a mechanical man, an automaton. The key is missing, all right, but is not very mysterious: the look allowed to the movie watchers for a few seconds clearly suggests what the shape of the key is likely to be. When the key is finally seen, it is exactly what one would have expected. But two smart and mechanically skillful people, Hugo's father and Hugo himself, who had been seeing the same thing day after day, for months on end, as they worked hard to fix the automaton, apparently couldn't figure it out. Another thing I found disappointing in this ambitious big-budget movie is the oddly unnecessary liberty taken with the life of Melies: The wife he was living with at the time, contrary to what is shown in the movie, was his second, not his first wife and the actress in his films. That one was dead and buried, and had been so for a number of years already.
In ""Hugo"", the story of Melies has been romanticized and prettified to appeal to children and sentimental grown ups, and for that a lot of nice shinning, moving objects have been piled on it, with 3-D, and a little romance. It makes for a good show: a mixture of outright fantasy, some (sort-of) reality, and some over the top drama.
The real Georges Melies was a successful magician that, in the last years of the XIX century and the beginnings of the XX saw in the movies a new way of making tricks to impress his audience. Then he started making actual movies: Movies that told stories! Movies that showed impossible, beautiful, unforgettable, things! He brought them to the wider public, and help lay the foundation for the one true popular art of our age. He did not invent moving pictures: Edison in America and the brothers Lumiere in France did that. But their movies were about mundane happenings or else recreations of famous events: a train coming into a station, a dog barking and playing tricks, a horse galloping, a famous train wreckage, a buxom young woman dancing a naughty dance, that sort of thing.
Melies brought fantastic, unreal stories to the screens, so people in big cities and small villages, everywhere, could see his gorgeous dreams with their very own eyes. Today, those movies look crude and simplistic; in their day, they were dynamite. And an invaluable inspiration to those film makers that came after him and improved on them.
As to ""Hugo"": it left me pleased but unsatisfied, wishing for a different movie about Melies' life: one without fantastic adornments and thrills and spills. His life was fantastic and dramatic, and important, and singular enough. He was a great man, I think he deserves more. I hope he gets it, some day.",1333497600,4,3694,4.675883256528418
4957884,3,B0064YON8G,"Sorry, Mr. Scorsese! This was a good, entertaining film. But worthy of an Academy Award? Nope. The beginning of the film was a bit off and slow; the plot really didn't pick up until about 40 minutes into the film. The best performance in the film was by Helen McCrory who portrays Mama Jeanne (Georges Melies' wife), but the others were decent. I feel like people (especially the Academy) are only crazy about this film because (1) it's Scorsese, and (2) it's about film history -- particularly honoring that history.

By the end of the film, I almost feel like I was watching the life-time achievement award
ceremony of the Oscars! This is probably a cherished topic for Scorsese, probably reflecting his childhood
memories, but it does little for me.

The Station Inspector character is a major failure. You can tell he is simply not a villain, but then he's not
a clown or someone worth sympathies for (considering the children he had sent to the orphanage). As a result, you never feel the kid is in any real danger escaping from him, and
there is just not a lot of tension.

Perfectly cast, Hugo represents storytelling at its very best, and I found myself thrice drawn back to the theatre to witness his spectacular foray into 3-D.  It was by far the finest presentation in that process these eyes have ever beheld.  This lifetime movie fan is at a loss to name a film in recent memory that he enjoyed more than Hugo, and I hastened to pre-order my DVD copy after watching it for the first time.

 Deservedly, Hugo received eleven Academy Award nominations.  Undeservedly, it failed to capture the Best Picture Oscar, The Artist winning instead.  Evidently, many Academy voters had never before seen a silent motion picture, and felt that moviemaking techniques abandoned in 1928 with the advent of sound to be revolutionary today.

 Of course, some modern moviegoers found Hugo not to their liking, having been weaned on glitzy special effects, car chases, splatter, and street language.  They considered it boring.  Used to be that a good story was all that was necessary to fill theatre seats, but, and sadly, no more.  But I am among those who still demand that of a motion picture, and can only say well done, Martin Scorsese; well done Asa Butterfield, Chloe Grace Moretz, Ben Kingsley, Christopher Lee, and yes, you too, Sacha Baron Cohen.

I'm not a 10-12 twelve year old, clearly the target audience for this appalling waste of $200million, but I coughed up my $20 and wore the glasses so here goes.

Before I even saw HUGO my suspicions were aroused by the studio's hyberbolic PR trumpeting of the virtues of this 'Nouvelle Vague' of 3D wonderfulness, those suspicions were indeed confirmed after a mere two minutes of this movie.  The soulless camera work feels self conscious, obtrusive and sadly doesn't even begin to plaster over the sloppy acting and pedestrian script. It's like Scorsese was 'not at his desk' but had his hands full dealing with the sheer weight of technical nonsense involved. Whatever the reason the piece is devoid of his masterful touch. Anyhoo I hung in there but after forty minutes of eye watering 3D my heart finally sank into the bog of it's mediocrity, my cherished memories of Travis Bickle, Joey Santoro, Charlie, Johnny Boy etc etc tarnished forever. When Hugo mercifully finished, it felt shockingly forgettable. It just evaporated - no indelible quotes or haunting images, just a scrap of a $200 million discarded sweetie wrapper.

And what of all the fine words spouted about the revelatory nature of the new sensitive 3D we're being so desperately flogged? Well, for me, there was scant proof of the lofty claims as to it's drama enhancing qualities - in fact it was more distracting nuisance than revelation or enhancement. I'm afraid from an adult perspective it was....well ummm, lame.

The final insult of this 'homage' is that Georges Mlis was in love with the medium of FILM and the journey it took him on to create magic in the camera. HELLO! FILM, not a load of smart arsed CGI FX churned out on a digital camera pretending to be a film camera - for heaven's sake. HUGO is in fact the polar opposite of an homage, betraying the very essence of Mlis passion.

4957970,2,B0064YON8G,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

For those who believe that 'Hugo' is all about the title character, think again. Martin Scorsese only uses a fanciful child's tale to arrive at his true intent: a tribute to film pioneer, Georges Mlis. Visually, one can argue that the film is a tour de force, with some fantastic special effects as well as a sumptuous score, but until we arrive at said tribute, Scorsese's tale lacks the requisite tension and charm.

The film starts off rather nicely as Scorsese takes us into the heart of a Paris train station, circa 1930. We meet Hugo, an orphan, who's being raised by his alcoholic uncle, after Hugo's watchmaker father is killed in a fire. The uncle teaches Hugo how to maintain the vast array of clocks, hidden inside the station but their relationship remains completely underdeveloped. The real tension is supposed to be between Hugo and the autocratic station inspector (awkwardly played by Sacha Baron Cohen), who is bent on sending the orphan away to a reform school. Scorsese relies on a series of slapstick chase scenes between Hugo and the inspector to move the plot along, and adults should not find much interest in such shenanigans.

The connection between Hugo and Mlis is made through a keepsake bequeathed to Hugo from his father. It's an 'automaton', a mechanical man which the father could not get to work, and now Hugo has taken to stealing mechanical parts from a toy store owned by Mlis, now a virtual recluse, in the hope that those parts will enable him to start the device up. Mlis ends up confiscating Hugo's notebook, which contains drawings of the Automaton and his efforts to repair it. Eventually, Mlis hires Hugo to work in the toy store, in order to pay off the debt for the mechanical parts he stole from the store.

Hugo finally gets the Automaton to operate when he discovers that Mlis' goddaughter, Isabelle, is wearing the key (that starts the device), around her neck. Wouldn't you know it but the Automaton draws a screen shot from Mlis' most famous film, 'A Trip to the Moon', proving that the ""great man"" is still alive (unbeknownst to an indifferent public). The two kids manage (with the help of a kindly film historian), to bring Mlis back into the public eye, and Mlis ends up getting the recognition he ""deserves"", from the French film society.

In the best part of the film, Scorsese shines, as he offers up a film hagiography of Mlis' career. The flashback, which includes how Mlis actually created 'A Trip to the Moon', features that glass house, where the pioneer's seminal feature film, was made. Nonetheless, one gets the feeling that Scorsese's embrace of the past, has gone too far. The reverence for Mlis has gotten to the point where Scorsese has placed the film pioneer, on a saintly pedestal. Yes, he is an important figure in the history of cinema and he was extremely talented, especially in a day when film was in its infancy and no one had yet grasped the concept of film as spectacle --but Mlis was still a product of his time, and those ancient images belong in the context of the times they were made in. If it was up to Scorsese, Mlis would be placed in the same pantheon as Shakespeare and Dickens; but Mlis' films were not designed to appeal to the intellect. Mlis' appeal to Scorsese is on the technical level and that's why he admires him so much. To a certain extent, there's nothing wrong in that. But for Scorsese to expect the average film goer to worship Mlis as some kind of film 'deity', I would suggest he's gone a little too far out on a limb.

Karina Longworth, in her review of 'Hugo' in the Village Voice, sums it up best by arguing that the 'ticking clocks' are the true antagonist in the film: ""In the story of Mlis's life as recounted by Scorsese--and by extension, the story of the movies--time is the enemy that alters the tastes of audiences, decays film prints, and turns today's fetish objects into tomorrow's relics.""

'Hugo' in many ways, feels more like a documentary in parts than a clever children's story, fraught with conflict. The conflict here is manufactured and the two child actors end up with little to do except act as impresarios for the Mlis main act. Relationships here are never really developed or explored and we're asked by Scorsese, to simply applaud the hagiography. If you were to take out all the spoken dialogue in the film and leave only the musical soundtrack, you wouldn't miss much. Perhaps, ironically, that's what Scorsese was really aiming for: a stunning visual tribute, to the technical wizardry of an early film pioneer.",1332547200,4,4593,4.698136645962733

4957993,4,B0064YON8G,"Beautiful to look at and lovingly produced, Hugo is still a bit disengaging. The heavy use of CGI is distracting at times, and the sense of magic that the film so clearly strives for is only partially attained. For me the most moving moments came from the recreated footage of movies made at the dawn of cinema. Those brief scenes elicit so much joy and wonder that it makes the rest of the movie feel flat by comparison.

I couldn't help but compare ""Hugo"" to ""Cinema Paradiso"" (not the ""special edition"", but the version that was originally released in the States), since at its heart ""CP"" is also about the romance and innocence of early film. The emotional payoff at the end of ""CP"" is on an exalted level while ""Hugo"" leaves a pleasant afterglow that ultimately pales by comparison.

That said, I want to note that ""Hugo"" looks absolutely gorgeous in high definition. The level of detail is breathtaking, making this a demonstration-class disc in my opinion.

4957995,5,B0064YON8G,"""Hugo"" is director Martin Scorsese's foray into a more fantastic and family friendly film than most of his body of work from ""Mean Streets"" to ""The Departed"".

""Hugo"" takes place in 1920's Paris, Hugo is an orphan played by Asa Butterfield whose father (Jude Law) is a watchmaker is killed in a museum fire and Hugo finds himself taken in by an Uncle who works keeping the clocks in the Paris train station. When the Uncle disappears Hugo keeps the clocks running and fends for himself in the train station, stealing what food he can to survive and mechanical parts for an automaton he started to repair with his father. Hugo's life, while it has obvious ""Oliver Twist"" overtones, is going along until one day he tries to steal a mechanical mouse from a toymaker in the train station, who turns out to be the forgotten early filmmaker Georges Melies (Ben Kingsley). Melies confiscates Hugo's notebook of drawings of the automaton and forces Hugo to work in his shop until he's repaid Melies.

In an effort to get the notebook back and avoid Melies indentured servitude Hugo enlists Melies ward, Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), to retrieve the notebook. The girl who up until now had only read about adventures, senses one in Hugo and agrees to help him and together they discover Melies secrets.

There's a lot of whimsy and romanticism surrounding Hugo, the secret passages he uses to get around the Paris train station largely unseen, his love of the mechanical and his mastery of intricate work, as well as the discovery associated with Melies and the automaton, children will enjoy this and hopefully soak up some of the sense of wonder in the worlds discovered in this movie. It's also easily Scorsese's most whimsical movie with an eye towards some of the wonder and fantasy associated with Melies movies.

There is one scene that seems a little out of place, when the characters learn the fate of most of Melies movies it seems almost a commercial from the American Film Institute for the need of film preservation, but the moment passes quickly and the audience is reimmersed in the plot of the movie.

The casting and acting are great from beginning to finish, Asa Butterfield has the wide look of wonder that youth supplies. Ben Kingsley goes from grouchy old man, to menacing, and then world weary filmmaker. Sacha Baron Cohen plays Hugo's nemesis in the station inspector, a character that clearly could be the grandfather of Inspector Clouseau. Chloe Grace Moretz has the same innocent charisma and sense of wonder as a young Diane Lane in ""A Little Romance.""

""Hugo"" is a parable with Melies life as an example of the need to preserve films, but it's also a very personal parable for Scorsese's life. Like Melies of ""Hugo"", a war changed the course of a movie industry, in ""Hugo"" after World War I Melies fantasies were no longer in fashion because audiences had seen too much and craved more realism in their films. Scorsese was part of the wave of post-Vietnam War filmmakers whose realism and naturalistic techniques were more in demand with audiences that were rejecting the studio produced fantasies and movies with an inevitable happy ending that they just didn't see in life.

4957998,3,B0064YON8G,"Intelligent family films are few and far between, so it is a surprise that one would come from director Martin Scorsese, who is better known for his sprawling macabre sagas than children's stories. But Hugo is full of enough magic, heart, and imagination to inspire anyone, young or old.

Since the death of his father, twelve year old Hugo (Asa Butterfield) has lived in the train station and looked after winding the clocks. By day he keeps out of the clutches of the local inspector (Sasha Baron Cohen), who is intent on catching orphans and dispatching them off to the orphanage, and by night he works on the anamatron his father left him. The wind-up man has never worked and Hugo steals parts from a local toy shop to try and fix him. But one day, the owner of the shop, Georges Mlis (Ben Kingsley), catches him and absconds with Hugo's notebook full of sketches. This leads to an unlikely friendship with George's granddaughter Isabelle (Chlo Grace Moretz), as the two are drawn into one another's worlds and discover unexpected delights along the way.

Because this is a book adaptation, the plot is richer and more complex than usual. It unravels at a slow pace but has the luxurious quality of feeling like a book, as pages turn and events transpire and we learn things about everyone along the way. What stands out the most, however, is the vignettes that unfold in the background such as a romance between two people held at bay because of her aggressive dog, and the insecurities faced by the station inspector. These add an air of delight to a plot that in the second half surprises us with unexpected revelations. It does feel a trifle slow at times but the wonder of the world Scorsese creates makes up for it. I have rarely seen a more gorgeous film, full of beautiful exterior shots of France just after the first world war. Everything from snow-covered statues to the interior clockworks is breathtaking. The cast is made up of mostly British actors, many of whom will be familiar to the audience from everything from Hammer films to the Harry Potter series. (Christopher Lee, Jude Law, and others make guest appearances.) It has a wonderful musical score, and a truly tremendous main cast. The luminous eyes of Asa Butterfield often shine with unshed tears.

Finally after 2 hours, they got to the point of the movie which was pretty uninspiring.  And the ending was so cheesy, everyone lives happily ever after, even the bad guy who miraculously gets redeemed, that it was just painful.

4958026,4,B0064YON8G,"If you've ever wondered what a children's movie directed by Martin Scorsese would be like, wonder no more. Based on a children's book, ""Hugo"" maintains much of the simplicity one would expect. The cinematography and art design is amazing. Whether or not the Paris scenery was real or generated, it was beautiful to behold. It's a good family movie; however, even evaluated at that level, it could've used a little more feeling. Despite Hugo being an orphan, it was difficult to sympathize a whole lot with him. Maybe it was because Hugo was so self-sufficient even at a rather young age. Hugo is a very likeable character and the actor did a great job, but somehow I didn't feel emotionally connected to him. In general, the acting was rather good. It was amusing to see Sacha Baron Cohen playing a role which was less outrageous than his typical characters.

The part of the movie which is geared more toward adult audiences is the homage to Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s, the great filmmaker. It was wonderful to see Scorsese bring elements of M&eacute;li&egrave;s's old movies to life. Watching some of the behind-the-scenes features included on the blu-ray, it was interesting to discover how much fact there is behind the movie. M&eacute;li&egrave;s really did end up forgotten and poor running a toy shop in a train station in Paris before someone re-discovered him by chance.

In general I would recommend ""Hugo"" as a nice family film, despite its emotional shortcomings. Although the plot is largely predictable, the tale of redemption of Hugo and M&eacute;li&egrave;s is still entertaining. It shows how versatile a director Scorsese is, since one couldn't get much different from ""Goodfellas"" or ""The Departed"".",1332115200,,1720,5.095744680851064

Not sure about all the 1-star reviews, especially since the film was multi-layered and rich with themes. The soundtrack was sumptuous, and there were some really poignant scenes. Also, quite a few silent scenes in which the acting and the music carried them through.

Sadly, the acting is what left me scratching my head. Hugo, played by Asa Butterfield, seemed uncomfortable, almost like he didn't know what to do with his arms, or didn't know how to hold his body. He just looked awkward, and it pulled me out of the movie. I think he has a lot of talent, however. In fact, there were a few scenes were just his facial expressions seemed to reveal what he was thinking. But on the whole, it just felt like he was acting.

However, there is something overly meticulous and dramatically inert in the execution that somehow makes the film miss its mark for me emotionally. As much as I admired all the technical achievements presented here, I felt a bit of a chill when it came to the emotional elements. Adapted by John Logan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Aviator/dp/B00080ZG10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Aviator</a>) from Brian Selznick's historic fiction novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Invention-of-Hugo-Cabret/dp/0439813786/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Invention of Hugo Cabret</a>&nbsp;(2007), the fanciful story centers on Hugo, a twelve-year-old urchin who lives within the walls of Paris' Gare Montparnasse railway station in 1931. His father was a master clockmaker who took Hugo to see the early films of cinematic pioneer Georges Mlis (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Trip-to-the-Moon-1902/dp/B006XEH7EO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Trip to the Moon (1902)</a>) and was working on his most ambitious project, repairing a mechanical robot who could write with a pen, when he died suddenly in a fire.

Hugo is taken away by his drunkard uncle, who took care of the main railway clock until he disappeared one night. All the while, the boy obsesses over finishing his father's project by pilfering gears and other parts he finds in the station toy shop run by none other than Mlis who has fallen on hard times. Now an embittered man, he take's Hugo's prized notebook with all his father's notes and threatens to burn it as punishment. However, Mlis decides to let the boy earn back the parts he stole by working in the shop. Hugo also meets Mlis' precocious goddaughter, an orphan named Isabelle who is a bit older than him. They bond immediately with he taking her to the movies for the first time and she leading him to the key that unlocks the mechanical man's programmed capabilities. Through quite a few convolutions in the plot, including an elaborate dream sequence, the connection between Mlis and his earlier groundbreaking work is finally recognized and celebrated.

Finally back in a top-grade production, Ben Kingsley plays the gruff and mysterious filmmaker-turned-toyshop owner with the ideal mix of austerity and frustration. Chlo Grace Moretz (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kick-Ass/dp/B002ZG983M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kick-Ass</a>) is also winning and immensely likable as Isabelle.

The young actor has the immense weight of the story on his shoulders, but he doesn't provide enough conviction to gravitate the heart to Hugo's plight. The most problematic performance is Sacha Baron Cohen's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Borat/dp/B000P4ME14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Borat</a>) slapstick-driven turn as the station inspector. It's not so much the stunt-casting aspect as it is the anomalous approach he takes in making the character strangely menacing with little redeeming value. Much smaller roles are taken by Jude Law as Hugo's father and Emily Mortimer as a flower girl. Scorsese's visual team has done near-flawless work here, starting with production designer Dante Ferretti and cinematographer Robert Richardson, both of whom bring 1930's Paris to vivid life with exacting detail and burnished brushstrokes.",1332028800,2,3936,6.410546139359699

4958048,5,B0064YON8G,"Hugo is a wonderful story.  It is a story that goes straight to the heart. It is the acting of Isa Butterfield that plays Hugo that makes it especially great.  He is a triffic actor. You know what he is feeling and thiking by his expressions and his bodily actions. He is a lonely boy that is looking for a real home away from the walls of the railroad station. He literally lived in the walls of the railroad station but all the action of the station was within his constant view. What he sees is like a silent movie but the actors are so good acting out their parts that you understand fully what is going on. Hugo met a girl his own age and they helped each other understand why their life was the way it was. Hugo sees the world as a huge machine with no extra parts. He says ""machines don't come with extra parts"". Therefore he believes that he and his friend have a definite purpose in the world.  If a machine or person isn't doing what it was intended to do then it is broken and that is sad and they needs fixing. He and his friend see Ben Kingsley as soneone who needed repairing and proceed to do just that. I think it was one of Ben Kingsley's best movie part. It is one of the most heart warming stories I have seen for a long time.  I wish there were more stories like this. I find most movies that have come out recently as uninteresting. There have been a few good ones like ""Tower Heist"", ""RED"", ""The King's Speech and ""Unstoppable"".  ""Hugo"" won many academy awards and deserved every one of them.  I usually don't like the movies selected by the academy but this one is a keeper.  I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good story. I enjoyed it more in BluRay than PayPerView.

4958051,1,B0064YON8G,"I am of the ""did not like it"" camp.  The movie is basically a high quality overly long infomercial for film preservation.  And I was annoyed that it did not have any driving singular narrative.  Additionally, I thought the script was haphazard while trying to be mysterious but with a perpetual overwhelming boredom.  Ben Kingsley is still trying to prove that he's not Gandhi by playing another unlikeable character; and I found his motivation for his bitterness to be thoroughly unbelievable.  (Ben Kingsley is now officially the 'kiss of death' for any movie, for me.  I refuse to see any more of his films).  I do like movies that star kids (The Others; Neverland; The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas; Charlie & The Chocolate Factory; The City Of Lost Children; etc), but I do not like this one.  The fantasy genre is not in Scorecese's wheelhouse.  This should have been more in the realm of Alice In Wonderland, Harry Potter, or any Terry Gilliam film.  Scorcese is not the director for that kind of movie... and this is painfully evident by the stilted characters, bland dialogue, and uneventful meandering that goes on throughout.  Sacha Baron Cohen is the one highlight of the movie.  He seems to be the only one who understood what was going on and how to approach the movie.  The 3D is admittedly well done, but does not make up for the sloppy editing, the poor scripting, the lackluster directing, or the contrived plodding plotting.  How this movie was even nominated for Oscars is due only to the CGI and 3D effects.  I had great hopes for this movie.  They were exceedingly dashed to the ground, and I was more annoyed than I should have been, only because the movie had so much potential to be so much better.

4958052,5,B0064YON8G,"This movie was entrancing to me and bored my wife; yet another example that beauty is in the eyes (and ears) of the beholder. Hugo evoked memories of the excitement of being young, impressionable and filled with wonder at the mysterious parts that make things work, both animate and inanimate. The movie progresses at a rather slow but steady pace at the beginning that may put off those who are looking for action in their movies. To me it did an effective job of identifying and defining Hugo with all of his dreams and aspirations; I felt a kinship with him that reminded me of certain aspects of my childhood. Gradually the clues that are given in the early part of the movie are put together and the viewer begins to see how it all fits together.

The movie is visually somewhat overwhelming in its level of detail on the screen; one gets the feeling that one needs to watch it again to finish seeing all of the amazing and fascinating things being shown. This movie will be a feast for many boys and those men who have not lost their boyish sense of wonder. The role of Hugo is convincingly played by Asa Butterfield and the other lead roles are well done by such seasoned actors as Ben Kingsley, Christopher Lee, and many others.

The movie is just over two hours long and seems to proceed at a leisurely, introspective pace. I have not been young for a long time but it brought back memories of youth that took me back to the feelings of childhood. I recommend it highly.",1331683200,4,1479,4.453874538745388

4958076,5,B0064YON8G,"Weighing Scorsese film at this point in his virtuosity, would be a truism, I would say, for example, that is huge, like a mighty river flowing through the frames, musical patterns, and New York (the Italian of course). The metaphor of a stream flow of ideas, scenes, actors, extras and conjugations you do with these elements is comparable to George Mlis, a dynamo therein as the Director that this film honors.  I would like to paraphrase to Isaac Newton about Scorsese, saying: ""We are standing on the cameras filming the giants who preceded us.""
  It is said that Hugo Cabret is playing in this transgression of time and space, the asthmatic child that was Martin, a situation which limited its output in street playgrounds with other kids an because that to invent other kind of  activities, fantasies, and read what ever was at hand, in that he was in semi-seclusion like the boy in his movie. Hugo serves various and giant gears that move the clocks in the train station. Full of people coming and going, but also merchants and their customers- All such  faces that are spy by Hugo, reading minds, gestures, learning in such a big behavior laboratory,  stands apart from the covers of Time Machines. Was Scorsese as a child watched the passers-by from his  home?
  The movie is also the story of the great George Mlis, in part of his life in which he was in a small kind of estrangement from the joy that gave him the directing, acting, doing drawings (storyboards), for the scenes and scenarios, design mobile scaffolds in the first movie studio at Montreuil (the summer place of another small boy with asthma Marcel Proust  as Scorsese).
  That studio was like a greenhouse, to exploit sunlight as light, because the resources of artificial illumination were limited. Mlis was originally from a merchant family in shoes, but its formation from the drawing to the humanities (spoke Latin, Greek and English), and his curiosity about the inventions (an element that adds to the child Scorsese to Hugo Cabret), and finally his training in sleight of learning in London and then in the theater of Robert Houdin, allows graduating from the University of Life, to be the equivalent of Mozart at the movies. He did not invent the cinema, but this activity has made the filming of people, parades, trains, waves and military parades, the narration of dreams.
  It was so banal everyday filming, those scenes that merchants traveling fairs, bought the footage per meter, as the fabrics. It's telling stories, people come and go, objects, hopes rise and fall, wanting to be deceived, opposite the silver screen, but with elegance and good trade, is something that develops, among other hundreds things Mllis, and some of them are still used, and they were only perfected.
  Hugo is the child who discovers metaphorically that great director who works in a toy and candy store, forced to be out of movies because the of Edison, like Bill Gates of his day, it has been marginalized and forced to sell everything. For me, the discovering of the old filmmaker, is the central metaphor of the film, along with the automats, which indeed they were the hobby that Mlis inherited from the previous owner of the theater of magicians and illusionists which owner and director before was Robert Houdin. Scorsese would like to have him the discovered of that Director in real life, but Hugo is his alter ego in the film.
  The movie ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret,"" with Ben Kingsley  as George Mlis. has in him almost  an exact phenocopy  of the director Mlis, it's amazing  to see photos of the latter after seeing Scorsese's film and tell that makeup is well characterized and acting by  Kingsley.
The film was so superb directed and the actor's direction was so careful that even the hypomanic Sach Baron Cohen, was acting soft and nice, as ""The Station Inspector"" and also one of my favorite actors, specially
 in  my childhood fantasy, Dracula, as Christopher Lee, was there acting as the mythical bookseller of the  library.
  ""The invention of Hugo Cabret"" did not win the Oscar, but this is a greatest film, compared with ""the Artist"".  This was another of the contenders, which highlights the actions and dramas of the actors in the transition from silent movies to talkies. If you used a metaphor between rock and blues guitarists and both directors, the director of ""The Artists"" Michel Hazanavicius, is for me as the guitarist of the Rolling Stones, Keith Richards, a good interpreter of his instrument, he dreamed one night the tune of ""I can't get no Satisfaction"" and this was the song that catapulted to international fame with his band.
  While Martin Scorsese is for me like Stephen Ray ""Stevie"" Vaughan, who BB King and Eric Clapton, said that when he played blues guitar, the music flowed without repeating, natural, without pause, as if connected to a place from where it came all the phrasing of his instrument.
  Scorsese is the hallmark of all his films; he is like Fellini and Kurosawa, that deployed extras and cameras all over the scenario. For instance in ""Shining a Light"", with the Stones, he jokes with them, pretending to be angry, because they had not given the list of songs to play at the concert to be ready to shoot. But with 16 cameras covering and shooting everything (Yamamoto recommended that Kurosawa filmed with 100 camera because the real work of the Director was to be editor), Scorsese could be filming Mickey Jagger's uvula, rather that an act of superiority of Rolling Stones, as some critics cried as ""blasphemers head bangers addicts"", that was just a prefabricated joke between Jagger and Scorsese
  Hugo, the movie is a tribute to George Mlis, but at the same time, draw a line in the dream of the audience: ""You want to know of silent film and its brave men with their cameras and cranks? For this is the Lord's Prayer. Sweeteners are for ""The Artist"" just more saccharin for fat, tissues. But the real diabetics we watch this George Mlis's! And we are not afraid and we like the glucose rises! ""
  The film of Scorsese did not win the Oscar, but when no one remember  ""The Artist"",  The Scorsese movies  will continued to bee watched, and the empathy for Hugo Cabret would be one important master movie about George Mlis and of course indirectly by my admired Martin Scorsese.",1331596800,,6316,4.785253456221199

4958113,3,B0064YON8G,"There is no question that the sets and CGI carried the movie as well as the superb casting. The problem is that there were too many subplots that took away from the storyline and depth of character for Hugo, Georges Mlis and most importantly the automaton. The dogs; the security guard; store front owners were nice touches but became overbearing superficial distractions. By showing the films of Mlis the movie accomplished one of it's goals which was showing us the history of cinema (as an aside I believe that to understand any subject requires knowing it's history whether it's physics or politics) but I would have liked to have seen even more of his diverse accomplishments. The most obvious missing story was that of the automaton. I was waiting for much more of not only it's history but to see it do more whether in reality (they were amazing devices) or just with fantasy. The automaton essentially just disappeared. Finally, I was disappointed that they couldn't come up with a more positive way for Hugo to sustain himself than continually stealing, lying - bad message for the younger viewers.",1331424000,,1107,4.862433862433862
4958114,5,B0064YON8G,"This is a movie that people either love or hate.  When I was browsing through the customer reviews on Amazon here it's the first thing I noticed.  There are a lot of 5 star reviews, and a lot of 1 star reviews.  How is that possible?  How could so many people watch the same movie and have such a different view of the it?  Well, I'm sure it's a combination of alot of things, namely it's not some mindless movie that you can plop yourself or your kids in front of and just take it in and not have to think, rather it's a movie that will cause you to think and appreciate the artistry of cinema.

I love this movie!  It's one of the few I've seen in a long time, that when it was over I thought I need to see this again.  The movie has a lot of things going for it:

Story:  The movie is an adaptation of the book by Brian Selznick, who funny enough is known more as an illustrator than a writer but his book ""THe Invention of Hugo Cabret"" is the book the movie is based on. The book published in 2007 won the Caldecott Award that year, the first novel to ever win the award.  If you read the book you knew that this was going to be a movie, and you were excited to see it knowing that it would not disappoint.

What makes the story so good is that it tells a great story about the history of movies, and if you love movies then you will love this movie just for the story!

Characters:  The characters in the movie are wonderful.  The movie has some notable supporting characters namely Christopher Lee(Count Dooku).  The movie has some amazing actors that really surprised me.  One being Sacha Baron Cohen, who I can't help but only see as Borat until this movie.  He truely is a good actor and I hope he will take on roles like this in the future.  Ben Kingsley has been in many movies and has always been a good actor among many in a great cast, this movie is no different. He is excellent in his role, but he's out shined by the children.  One is Chlo Grace Moretz, I first saw her in ""Diary of a Whimpy Kid"" and she was great, but recently she has done several other great films.  This girl is only 15 years old!  I look for many amazing roles for her in the future.  THe young man that plays Hugo is a relatively unknown actor named Asa Butterfield.  He reminded me a lot of the young man in the most recent Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

Production:  The imagery in this movie with the gears and clocks is awesome! While this seems an unlikely movie for Martin Scorsese to direct I remember that he is a master storyteller that needs and loves good stories to tell, Hugo by that criteria is a no-brainer.

I loved this movie so much, and I wish everyone would watch it.  One interesting personal tidbit when I saw the movie and they referred back to the old historical movie ""To the Moon"" I kept thinking about the music video from the 1990s by Smashing Pumpkins, ""Tonight Tonight""  They recreated the film in their video, and for all the generation X'rs like myself this was my frame of reference for most of the movie.

4958143,4,B0064YON8G,"Snuggling in for a night at the movies with my kiddos and a blanket was the name of the game last night; and `Hugo' was on my big screen.  Yup, I finally got around to watching this Oscar frontrunner (and winner of 5 Oscars) and I must say that I was wholly satisfied.  It is magically and charming and entertaining and really a very fun and inspired ode to filmmaking in general, and it is easy to see Martin Scorsese the man coming through in almost every frame.  This is a family film, for sure, but it has so much maturity and depth of spirit that it doesn't feel like a children's film.

`Hugo' tells the story of orphan Hugo Cabret.  Hugo's father passed away and since his death Hugo has been living with his drunkard uncle and working the clocks at a train station.  His uncle has disappeared and Hugo has basically been stealing for his meals and stealing for his hobby.  You see, before his father died he found an unwanted automaton and both he and Hugo were attempting to fix it.  Hugo carried on this work, stealing from a toy merchant in the train station to find little mechanics needed to complete his task.  He's soon sniffed out by the merchant and punished, made to work off his thievery, and in the process he starts to uncover a greater truth in that little automaton he held so dear to his heart.

The `message from his father' led him to an even greater discovery.

Visually, `Hugo' is a feast.  The Oscar winning production design is truly eye catching.  You can't help but feel consumed by the flawlessly detailed train station and the simple yet heartwarming living arrangements.  The grandeur of the movies is captured in flashbacks and set pieces alike; and the grace of center stage illuminates the film's heart-tugging finale.  I did feel that the CGI embellishments were a tad overdone.  In some of the scenes I felt like I was watching a stop motion film, and I didn't like the way it took me out of the human appearance of the film.  Some of the sequences didn't work as intended (small moments, like when Isabelle falls in the station or the sudden `belief' in Rene's eyes) but overall there is a total emersion of grace and delight that overtakes nearly every frame of `Hugo'.  The acting is hit or miss, which is sad.  Chloe Moretz acts too hard.  You can always see her thinking about her next move.  Nothing is graceful and she holds her face in an awkward way that always tells us she's `in character'.  Asa Butterfield, on the other hand, is a wonderful actor.  While this performance was not as sincere as the one he gave in `08's `The Boy In the Striped Pajamas', he really understands how to convey emotion.  I felt that he botched his first teary outburst (pleading with Isabelle's god-mother for answers) but he nailed his final one; the most important.  Sacha Baron Cohen was awful, but Ben Kingsley was WONDERFUL.  You see, hit or miss.  It really is like that for everyone.

As many have noted, this is Scorsese's homage to film restoration, which is his big charity these days.  I back him one hundred percent.  It is a shame when great films are lost to the rest of us.  That only breeds youth who are removed from the greatness that cinema has to offer.  I'm intent on my children growing up to appreciate film of all kinds, and so I truly appreciate the stance that Scorsese is making.  `Hugo' definitely touches upon that concern, especially in the final act.  It can get a little too direct (it almost felt like a script upheaval for a moment, to be honest) but Scorsese finds a way to balance it back out.

In the end, `Hugo' is a delightful film.  It is flawed, sure, but it is truly a moving picture that has a sparkle one won't soon forget.",1331251200,5,3698,4.475336322869955

It starts off well enough with some good action and some thrills- then stalls and gets too cerebral for any kid to really retain any interest and it drags badly in the middle of the movie.  3d effects were not all that great- there were a few scenes of snow (been there done that) that looked OK, but overall the 3d was not that great.

Interesting sentiments that begin Hugo Cabret's (Asa Butterfield) journey towards understanding the world around him and the loss that he has endured after the death of his father, a clock-caretaker and an inspiration to Hugo's inquisitiveness to how things work, especially anything mechanical and most importantly clocks.  The movie takes place in the city of lights Paris within a train station where Hugo also lives.  With the opening scenes of the film, viewers have entered a world of mystery, mischief, and magic that looks like a combination of animation and like-action.

Hugo becomes an orphan but somehow becomes independent and self-reliant.  His curiosity and persistence to understand the things that his father (Jude Law) left behind leads him to an experience like no other that a child his age could ever imagine.  And the key component that leads him to a world that he has been enthralled and fascinated with, his father's small sketch notebook; the notebook was one of the last objects along with the mechanical figure that his father had been working on that will help to spark Hugo's energy to unlock the mystery behind the drawings and the mechanical figure.  But before he and Isabelle area able to unlock the mystery, he encounters a disgruntled toy shopkeeper by the name of Georges (Ben Kingsley)and retrieves the notebook who inquires about the drawings; but as the film progresses more mysterious elements arise and the question of who exactly is Georges? But along the way, Hugo does not make his journey alone, and he befriends Georges's goddaughter Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz).  The drawings reveal much in terms of the love for film and its origins, which renowned and critically acclaimed Director Martin Scoresese helped to revive and unlock the mystery as well as the history of film-making within the main character of Hugo as well as other most recent films The Artist.  Both films recaptured the craft and innovation of what movies had first set out to accomplish - entertain but also make the filmgoer wonder after the last credits of the film have gone up.  But also most notably, the individuals that first made this world of wonderment happen and what Hugo's storyline centers upon, legendary filmmaker George M&egrave;li&eacute;s and the cinema.

With the sudden resurgence of the history of film, the release of Hugo and The Artist are a welcoming aspect, especially during this rise of technology within the film industry and overall within the cinema.

This restoration is a basic element of the film's focus on creativity, determination and pride.  The movie is hypnotic and features an excellent cast.  Asa Butterfield's Hugo is superb, a child actor with an uncanny maturity who provides the heart and soul of the film...one of the best youth performances in recent cinema.  Chloe Grace Moretz continues her impressive career as the engaging Isabelle.  Ben Kingsley gives one of his best performances since GANDHI as the bitter Georges.  Sasha Baron Cohen is surprisingly effective as the disapproving inspector.  Rounding out the cast in smaller roles are Jude Law, Richard Griffiths, Ray Winstone, Christopher Lee and Emily Mortimer.

4958176,3,B0064YON8G,"I was really disappointed with this movie. The previews (as always) showed a magical mystical type of story with action and heart felt acting and it seems like it would be a wonderful story. But I felt that unless you were from a time when you enjoyed the old silent film industry and the movie makers of that period, then this movie would really mean very little to you, as it did me. Hugo is a young adventurous type lad who has no parents or family any longer alive and lives in a clock tower of england, london train station, really wasn't too sure where it was taking place. He discovers that he has the anamatron robot that was once owned by the old time director of these films, that he and his father found at a fair. The old time director turns out to be the old man that owns the toy shoppe across the street from his clock tower. Hugo travels every day through the streets to get food and parts he needs to try to fix the robot. He keeps stealing from the old man until he gets caught one day and the old man puts him to work. He finally gets it working and discovers that it can draw pictures from scenes from the director's movies. He eventually meets and teams up with the old man's grandaughter who wants to help him on his journey to get what he needs and to keep the large clock towers running. In the process, Hugo and the grandaughter uncover much more about the old director's history and the movies he made. So towards the end of the movie, Hugo discovers the anamatron once belonged to the director and tries returning it to him and is constantly hounded by the mean train yard security officer with a fake leg because he lost his real one during the war. The only real excitement comes from a few scenes where the security officer and his dog chase Hugo through the train yard and they do eventually capture him but only for a moment. The entire story was very slow. If you had have memories of the old silent films and can appreciate their greatness, which I have to admit they were pretty spectacular for what they had to work with at the time and the ingenious minds that came together to create some pretty great effects, then this movie is definitely for you. It just wasn't really for me, and I bought the blu-ray to boot. Live and learn.",1331078400,2,2267,4.311475409836065
4958177,5,B0064YON8G,"HUGO is a magical treat from start to finish, beginning with its marvelous open tracking shot of a Paris railroad station in the '30s. From then on, there's a treasure of masterful photography involved in the telling of a boy who lives in a train station and, in the tradition of his inventive father, keeps the huge clock and its machinery working.

The boy is played with great sensitivity by Asa Butterfield in what has to be one of the best child performances ever. He carries the film and never lets the momentum stop as he scurries around the train station trying to avoid the overzealous clutches of a crippled station master (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his fearsome dog. It's like watching Dicken's innocent Oliver Twist or David Copperfield trying to avoid the unscrupulous mishandling of a mistrustful adult.

All of the behind-the-scenes glimpses of the whirling machinery inside the clock are an added visual treat, creating the illusion of suspense and danger whenever the plot demands it. As the girl whom Hugo befriends and shares his knowledge of the automaton with, Chlore Grace Moretz is equally charming and natural. Their chemistry helps the film's most pivotal moments work beautifully.

A much needed sense of humor is helped enormously by the contribution of Sacha Baron Cohen, whose station master emerges as one of the story's most interesting characters. Emily Mortimer is touching as a woman he admires and Christopher Lee does a standout job as the librarian who takes an interest in furthering Hugo's education.

The story's thread is slight, but the film is full of such complex images and turbulent events surrounding the boy's precarious situation that it remains an absorbing tale of an orphan who proves to be a most resourceful lad in keeping one step ahead of the authorities.

Then too, it's a backstory of the famous cinema inventor Georges Melies, who had the imagination to become one film's most inventive craftsmen in the early 1900s. Glimpses of his work are seen throughout the film and Ben Kingsley is a perfect choice to play this complex man. His scenes with Hugo are extremely touching.

And finally, I must end with a word of high praise for Martin Scorsese who lends his own magical touch to the proceedings to create one of the year's best films for the child in all of us. All of its wonders are underscored by Howard Shore's lovely background score.",1331078400,2,2398,4.87960687960688
4958178,3,B0064YON8G,"I was hugely disappointed with this movie.  I had heard such rave reviews, with one child going so far as saying it was the best movie of the year.  The story line had such potential, but the story just didn't flow.  There were a lot of moments where the movie just played but nothing happened.  So much storyline left untouched. It is a long movie which drags on and feels even longer than it really is.  Which is unfortunate because the potential is there for a really great movie.

*Possible spoilers*... Yes we know the father dies from a great firey explosion, but how & why? How did the fire start? Anyone else die? What happened to the museum?  Then the Uncle appears out of nowhere, steals a watch from the fathers workshop, takes the boy to the clock tower and you never hear from or about him again. Wouldn't the child wonder where he went?  Then one day, as the story needs to wrap up, his body is found.  Men that were nasty mean to Hugo one minute, warm up to him in a very short time, and take him under their wings.  How & why was the robot made?  How does it work?  How did the father get it to write out his message?  There are just so many things left unanswered in this movie!  The way the script is written, Hugo is very vague when speaking and is frustratingly silent when asked very simple questions.  This movie is frustrating throughout because of these type of moments. The movie is slow and the story just drags.  There are so many dull moments where the security guard is trying to muster the courage to talk to a pretty lady, but yet it has nothing to do with the story.  I think the worst acting character is the security guard.  There are so many other actors who could have pulled it off so much better.

Pulling the good from the movie, I found the visuals stunning, and the language clean.  It is a movie you can watch with a child or adult of any age, although the subject matter may be lost on the younger ones.  Also, the younger ones and those with ADD/ADHD may have a hard time sitting though the entire movie.

It seems so many movies these days forget that some people still love good story telling.  You can tell whole those people are by reading the reviews.  All the people who say this movie was boring probably didn't even pay attention to the story.  They were probably expecting some amazing special effects or who knows what.  I will admit this story is not for those who do not enjoy actually paying attention and or dislike interesting characters.  This movie is for those who enjoy books and imagination.

This story is about a young orphan who wants nothing more than to understand and rebuild this automated doll that his father was working on.  He believes that this object has left a hidden message from his father.  Along the way, he makes a friend and eventually he does get his answer, but i will not give that away.

Even though most of the movie takes place at the train station, there is a sort of adventure and mystery involved in the clues this child follows.  It is a very touching and well written story, that is definitely worth the watch.

Some might say it is a kids movie, but i think it is great for the whole family.  I miss movies like this really.  All movies seem to be about nowadays is sex, violence, and special effects.

I have seen the formula of interweaving reality with a fictional character before; one of the most famous is ""Sophie's World"" by Jostein Gaarder.

Any way the basic story is of a child that loses his father and thinks that his father left him a message that will change his life. In the process of perusing the message he meets Georges Mlis who may just have a message to change the reader's life.

The book incorporated a lot of pictures to help tell the story. This is innovative and holds your attention. However it did not translate well into the film as the film was slow and dragged a lot in scenes and even dialog.  They lost the continuity and purpose of the story by incorporating the station inspector story that was a minor part of the book. It was too slapstick.  What was great graphics in the book translated in almost cartoonish graphics in the film.  However they did an excellent presentation of how the original films were designed to show us the stuff that dreams were made of.

The flat screen version was well enough. The 3D graphics were sort of gimmicky sort of looking through a stereoscope; however they were several fields deep.

The shots in old Paris are lovely, and the train station setting is wonderful and allows for some amazing shots, especially as the young Hugo works inside the clocks, and the trains race through the stations. Orphan Hugo works with a friend to discover the trick to getting an old automaton his father left him to work, and ends up discovering the world of early film making. This movie basically offers a brief history of film, with footage from pre-war movies both real and created, and I loved this. It does verge on sentimentality though, and wasn't nearly as fascinating to my kids. For all the talk of movies being like dreams, I thought this could have used a little more of a nod to modern-day special effects, beyond some of the train scenes, to capture the youth of today.

4958214,5,B0064YON8G,"On one level, Martin Scorcese's HUGO is about French filmmaker Georges Mlis, who made hundreds of films between 1896 and 1913.  Anyone who has ever taken a film class in college will remember Mlis's ""A Trip to the Moon.""  Film aficionados will delight in the story of Mlis's life, his work in the industry, and his eventual disappearance into obscurity following World War I.  Ben Kingsley does a commendable job playing Mlis as a disappointed man near the end of his life, believing his life's work has been forgotten.

But on another level, HUGO is about our very human need for purpose.  Hugo himself (Asa Butterfield) is a young boy living in the walls and clock tower of the Montparnasse train station in Paris.  Hugo's father (Jude Law) has died, leaving him alone with a strange and magical ""mechanical man"" which his father found in a museum and was desperate to repair.  Hugo makes it his purpose to continue his father's work, believing that the mechanical man has a message for him from his dad.  When Hugo steals mechanical parts from a toy dealer in the train station (it's Mlis of course, played by Kingsley), he inadvertently forms a connection between himself and the now-reclusive filmmaker.  The heart of the film, then, is in Hugo's gift to Mlis - the recovery of the man's purpose, the resurrection of his belief in himself.

What makes HUGO a wonderful film, however, really has little to do with either its message or its historical portrait of a French filmmaker.  Mlis's work in film was all about the visuals, and so is Scorcese's HUGO.  This is a movie that explores what makes film a unique medium.  Books can tell stories; writers can even vividly describe images, but the reader is ultimately responsible for seeing them.  But film instantly grabs us out of ourselves and plunges us into time and place in a way that no book ever can.  HUGO is the train station, with its motley group of salespeople, commuters, and orphaned children.  It's the magnificent clock, filled with intricate gears and levers.  It's color and sound and motion, all happening at once.  There's a grandness to the visuals here, a magical beauty that is at once hypnotic and immediate.  This is what Scorsese was going for.  We experience film here the way people experienced Mlis's work a century ago.  The images we see surprise and delight us.  This is why we love film today.  This is why it's magic.

HUGO is best appreciated by those who delight in the artistic beauty of film itself, and what amazing feats can be accomplished with a camera and an artistic vision.  This is a film that plays with cinematic visuals in ways that are truly wonderful.  For that alone, it's worth five stars and multiple viewings.

Martin Scorcese's love for his craft shines through this homage to renowned filmmaker Georges Melies and to the history of film itself.

The set design, lighting, costume, and music work together to create an almost magical atmosphere throughout the entire film. I was taken aback because the movie is not only beautiful, but also a great testament to Scorcese's versatility as a director. Hugo is so unlike any other film of his that I've seen, but he managed to execute this children's-story-like film wonderfully. Cameo appearances were a plus as well.

Some of the script is a little cliche, some of the subplots are predictable, and some of the characters are a little too familiar. I felt like the characters all sounded sleepy in the beginning  (it picked up in the end, probably to highlight the progression in the theme of the story), and Sasha Baron Cohen's performing was surprisingly disappointing. In addition, the movie seemed to slow down a bit right before the hour mark. There are a lot of elements (educational tidbits on the history of filmmaking, Hugo's affinity for clocks, the policeman's love interest) that seem scrambled and unrelated until their all nicely tied together in the end.

4958244,4,B0064YON8G,"Quite surprising for an American director to create an excellent Euro-styled production. Filmmakers crossing ponds and finding success is very rare in my cinema experience, very rare.

A pair of examples of how unusual and difficult it is: '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hulk/dp/B001DRF84W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hulk</a>' directed by Ang Lee.

Again, it sucked. These are highly regarded directors in their respective cultures - but translating that into a completely different cultural product is so very difficult. The style, temperament, and visual cues are often subtle and easily detectable if missed. And if not done correctly, will sink a film. Though to be fair, Lee's project immediately after the green disaster was a hugely successful movie.

Point being: Few filmmakers can transfer and translate their abilities. Obviously Martin Scorsese is a member of that very elite club.

Loved this film, and I was really impressed by wide-eyed newcomer Asa Butterfield, who played the all-important lead role of Hugo. So easy for a director to select a child actor who is inappropriate - either overrated or because they're simply incapable. Remember the atrociously plastic kid in the latter 'Star Wars' films? Or how about that ridiculously pretentious little prig in the recent stinker '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Real-Steel/dp/B006PZBR8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Real Steel</a>'? Lots of kids just don't have ""it"" - and surprisingly, many of them still somehow con their way into films. I'm honestly amazed that Scorsese was able to cut through the blatherskite and find the right performer.

Butterfield has just enough universal appeal to forgive the fact that he, and the other artists, were speaking English. A tough sell given that almost the entire cast were from the UK.

I have to think the French would've been happier if Scorsese had utilized an authentic Franco cast. Sadly, many in the US don't speak another language or are incapable of reading subtitles - so it's completely understandable from a marketing perspective. But from a creative angle, it's the one very minor failing of the production.

A wonderfully rich story that I really enjoyed - with kudos to one of my all-time favorite actors -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sir-Ben-Kingsley/dp/B000UAE7KO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sir Ben Kingsley</a>.

4958246,5,B0064YON8G,"Hugo is based upon the beloved children's novel, The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick and is directed by Academy Award Winning Director Martin Scorsese. Set in 1930s Paris, Hugo (Asa Butterfield) and his widowed father worked on fixing an automaton able to write, thanks to the complex network of gears within. Unfortunately, Hugo's father died unexpectedly in a fire, leaving Hugo orphaned. Hugo's uncle then took Hugo to a train station in Paris, where he worked winding the clocks, and trained Hugo. His uncle then disappeared leaving Hugo alone, making him take over his uncle's job. There, he constantly tried to avoid the station inspector with his vicious dog. He met Isabelle (Chlo Grace Moretz), an eccentric and charming girl who loved to read, used odd sounding words like `superfluous', and always wanted to have adventures outside of books. But he also met her angry god-father (Ben Kingsley), who somehow knows about his automaton. Through peril and adventure, Hugo is the astonishing adventure of a boy whose quest to unlock a secret left to him by his father will transform him and all those around him, and reveal a safe and loving place he can call home.
 Hugo is a masterpiece, from the beautifully detailed streets of Paris, the superb acting, a heart-warming and nostalgic look at the invention of film, incredible cinematography, and some of the best uses of 3D since James Cameron's Avatar. Hugo is a celebration of people who have dreamed big, and so it too dreams big by using the most technologically advanced film techniques available, which results in one of the most beautiful movies of the year. While Hugo has special effects, they mostly involve the turning gears of clocks. This isn't Avatar, it's something better. Scorsese has found a way to prove the usefulness of the 3D format, not as a gimmick, but as a device for making even the simplest stories feel so big and important that they're ready to burst out of the screen and into real life.
While Scorsese's films are often dark and violent, such as last year's Shutter Island, he has shown that films starring children can be worthy of praise by making Hugo, which aims to entertain the older members of every family. But Hugo also has its faults; it doesn't really get interesting until the second half, and it could probably be cut down to a ninety minute film as opposed to one lasting one hundred twenty seven minutes. The first half sets up the action, and adds in meaningless things like a relationship between the station inspector and the owner of a flower shop, and a failing attempt at humor with the station inspector's artificial leg getting stuck.
 Overall, it is a truly great film that I found to be both heartwarming and satisfying. More directors are now showing us that movies about children can be beautiful works of art, and do not really have to be children's films at all. We need more films made with this level of care and dignity, for Hugo's is simply astonishing. Despite its pacing problems, I simply cannot recommend Hugo enough.",1330819200,,3056,4.830152671755725

4958249,5,B0064YON8G,"'Hugo' tells the story of a boy named Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) who only wants to find his purpose in life.  He spends his days in a Parisian train station running the clocks and observing the everyday activities of interesting side characters.  Hugo is an orphan whose father (Jude Law) died in a museum fire and the only thing Hugo has left of him is a mechanical man called an automaton.  Hugo believes that by fixing the automaton, he will recover a message from his father and will find just what part he is in the great machine that is the world.

Hugo meets a crusty old toymaker (Ben Kingsley) while trying to steal parts for the automaton.  The toymaker, who is first known as Papa Georges, takes a notebook from Hugo, which is vital in helping Hugo fix the automaton.  After following Papa Georges to his home in hopes of getting his notebook back, Hugo meets Isabelle (Chloe Moretz).  Isabelle soon becomes Hugo's only friend and through their adventures, they find out that there's more to Papa Georges than meets the eye.

While this is all going on, Hugo has to avoid capture by the ruthless station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen).  What's eventually revealed is that Papa Georges is the forgotten filmmaker Georges Melies, who is in the most simple terms, one of the most important pioneers in film history.  A great appreciation for what Melies did is found, but more importantly, 'Hugo' makes any movie-goer appreciate the magic that is the movies in a way that brings warmth to the hearts of all who witness it.

Butterfield does a fine job in the title role.  Subtle and sensitive, he makes the character of Hugo believable.  Moretz is delightful as Isabelle.  Something tells me that she has potential to do greater things.  Baron Cohen moves beyond 'Borat' and 'Bruno' and shows true acting chops while providing some needed comic relief in what is other wise a serious film.  Baron Cohen certainly stands out as one of the strongest members of a wonderful supporting cast.  The supporting cast includes: the station inspector's flower lady love interest (Emily Mortimer), two lovers separated by a dog (Frances de la Tour, Richard Griffiths), and Georges Melies' wife Mama Jeanne who is played by Helen McCrory with a gentle sensitivity and compassion for her husband.  All of these people add much-appreciated personality and delight that makes the difference between a great and excellent movie.  Kingsley, as Melies, is nothing short of sensational.  This was, in my eyes, a huge snub for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars.

'Hugo' is one of the most visually dazzling movies you will ever see.  It boasts the best use of modern 3D technology since 'Avatar'.  It is a beautiful portrait of a movie that secures its excellence with a strong cast, compelling story, and a superb directing job by Martin Scorsese.  'Hugo' will leave you feeling wonderful while instilling a greater appreciation for how far films have come and how it can be a masterful form of art. A+

As for the product, 'Hugo' has to be one of the best movies that one can view in Blu-ray.  A film that is filled with stunning CGI visuals and Oscar-winning cinematography, Blu-ray brings out the best of this visual masterpiece.  I do not have capabilities to view the 3D version right now, but I bought it anyway as an investment for the future that is worth it.  There will come a time when every TV and Blu-ray player will be able to play 3D.  That future is not so far away.

I want to address complaints about the Ultra Violet digital copy.  All one has to do is copy the code into the 'Redeem' section of the iTunes Store homepages (top right-hand corner of the page) or follow the other instructions on the bottom half of the instructions (gray background).  In short, do not mess with the Ultra Violet part if you don't want to risk it.",1330819200,2,3841,4.703592814371257

But not remind me that there is purpose in life, that bad people aren't always bad, and that through a sense of perseverance, adventure, and sheer grit, we can become better people.  No spoilers here, no plot summary.

4958251,4,B0064YON8G,"I truly hated this movie the first time. I was fast forwarding the DVD after 5 suffocating minutes. It was awful. It seemed to take forever at 10X speed with all the lingering shots of the cast moping around and talking. I hated the stilted, artificially colored world. Forcing magical beauty on the audience at all times made the movie impossible to relate to. I couldn't stand how overwrought everything was. I completely agreed with negative reviews on the web.

I watched it again with the TV adjusted to black and white with no sound. 3 piano music CDs shuffle played instead. Suddenly everything worked beautifully. The world of 1931 Paris was ugly and gritty. Hugo looked authentically poor instead of healthy and perfectly lit, wearing a carefully chosen costume. The story had room to breathe. 2 hours flew by and the picture held my attention the entire time. Isabelle was wonderful. The formerly obnoxious special effects worked and looked natural, since black and white effortlessly and harmoniously unified everything. I was so glad to see how beautiful the weirdly colored DVD transfer looked in black and white. Snow, sparks, and misty backlighting were particularly good.

The behind the scenes feature ruined the movie again, since I turned the color and sound back on. All the obsequious kissing up to Scorsese was pathetic!!! I hated seeing the beautifully toned black and white scenery go from looking like truly magical (and unflinchingly bleak) drawings to overdone golden hour oil paintings that drew attention to themselves at the expense of the story and characters. Magic isn't magical without grim, unforgiving reality for contrast. It was impossible to care about the troubles of characters in a perfectly constructed fantasy world filmed with tiresomely elaborate camera moves.

Black and white took all the needless excesses of 21st century movies away and delivered a refreshingly charming and beautifully paced story that paid off multiple times. I enjoyed reading subtitles (all lines delivered perfectly to my mind with the full benefit of the doubt given to the cast) and NOT hearing the bizarre English in France dialogue. Facial expressions and body language were more than sufficient. Talking ruins movies (and life) 90% of the time in my opinion. Going silent took the performance / ""you WILL be entertained"" pressure away. Simple, innocent humanity had room to shine instead of being weighed down in competitive battle with gimmicky visual effects and cluttered scenery. The excessive artifice of the full production became humble and appealing in flawlessly toned black and white.

So I can't give Hugo 5 stars. I doubt I'd enjoy seeing it with the overkill of full color and sound. Plain, sensitive, gently restrained piano playing was all it needed. The picture was hellish and exhausting in color, but timeless, engaging, funny, tragic, and glorious in black and white. I'm very happy to have given it a second chance.",1330732800,2,2962,5.126293995859213

But you'll notice that some reviewers were bored, so rent Hugo if you're unsure.  I hope it has the same affect on you that it had on me.  And then you will buy a copy to watch over and over.

The trailer is WAYYY better than the actual movie, so thats why this movie is proof that less is more. The first 90 minutes is a complete waste of time. Last 30 minutes is watchable but not much more than that. There is some deep deep conspiracies going on in the movie business for a bad movie like this to get awards and good reviews. The only scene even memorable was when the boy has a dream, and its nothing special, just a train crashing. Really a complete waste of time and money for everyone involved, including anyone that watched it. If you take all the interesting parts from this movie, you have a 12 minute film at best. If you don't believe me then you will after you watch it. Save your curiousity for a good movie. Watch the trailer again because its better than the movie. Theres nothing to see here. The robot barely even plays much of a role in the film. It draws a picture and thats about it. Nothing much is ever even explained about why things happened the way they did.

This film didn't win 5 Tech Oscars for no reason; Scorcese has crafted a very personal film; his devotion to film preservation is no secret to anyone.
The lovely story of Hugo Cabret is perfect subject matter for a man who finally decided to make a film his kids could watch. I never read the book, but the film, as presented, created a magical world. Indeed, the work of Melies may have gone forgotten.

I'm sure many who are not serious film aficianados may not understand its importance, but the story being told should suffice. There are good characters, good script, fine acting and excellent direction, pulling all these elements together. Oscar-winning production values are reason enough to watch ""Hugo"", and Scorcese's loving homage may resonate with those who know the power of film.

I've always had a particular affection for films seen through the eyes of kids; kids see so much more, and more simply...probably more like it is. The difference is that kids choose what is most important at the time, and Hugo makes good decisions.

It's a marvelous family film. I liked it very much.",1330646400,,1130,4.75

Even Hollywood has forgotten them as they honored ""The Artist"" with the best picture Oscar while it blatantly ripped off the likes of silent greats such as ""7th Heaven"" and directors such as Borzage, Murnau and Hitchcock in the name of honoring them! ""The Artist"" was ""cute"", maybe even innovative, but not original.  Hugo is original.  It is a plea not to forget the silents - not to forget those who came before the Hollywood we all enjoy today. Martin Scorsese was best director in 2011 for having the courage to make a beautiful film to deliver his message.  Hugo was best picture for its extroadinarily entertainining, almost mystical story that implores all of us to preserve our film legacy!

4958289,2,B0064YON8G,"I have over 300 Blu-ray titles. This is in the top ten of ones I wish I could return. My family watched it with my daughter and mother-in-law. Not one of us found it inspiring, exciting, or even entertaining. The picture was beautiful, the cinematography was top notch, but the story was a let down. This would be a bore to any child to have to sit through compared to other ""family"" movies out there. Although titled Hugo, the movie was more about the retired film maker.

Several times throughout the movie, Hugo could have gotten out of his predicament if he would have just spoken up and explained himself. Time and time again, he didn't. What kind of protagonist is that that to route for?! By the end, I almost wanted to see him end up in the orphanage. Then there is the matter of the ""robot"" that's secret looked to be the climax of the story, but once again a major let down.

Have any kids actually liked this movie? I just can not see how they would want to sit through this without 3-D glasses on. As for us, it is back to re-watching real heart felt gems from Pixar and Dreamworks for the family.",1330646400,11,1109,4.326923076923077
4958290,5,B0064YON8G,"I wish it had won more awards.  This film about a desperate orphan, who finds a home, was so well made that it charmed some of the most jaded audiences and critics.  Time is one of the motifs.  Hiding in the Parisian train station, Hugo is the ghost in the machine who, unseen, keeps the giant clockwork lubricated and on-time.  Hugo is the boy in the moon, peeping out from the giant, white clock face to wonder at the small world beneath him; he watches the scurry of life and little romances.  Enhanced by its appropriate and charming score, the film succeeds on almost every note.

I think there are a couple of things I would have made stronger or forecast better.  For example, Hugo should be seen actually learning to repair clocks from his father; and, sometimes you can't be subtle with audiences, though it may be intimated that he's running out of time before he's caught, why does he feel his last chance is with Papa Georges.  Maybe I'm the one who's missing it because I can be hypercritical.  Hugo, all alone, wonders about his purpose in the world.  In the end, Hugo's purpose is revealed.  He ""repairs"" the broken people around him, Papa Georges Melis and the Station Inspector, for example.  He finds a home.  The wonderful (magical?) automaton, a simulacrum of his father (and the actor who portrayed him), also comes home.

I'm skeptical of 3D.  It's always been (and probably always will be) a gimmick.  The 3D version in theaters worked, however, because Scorsese played with it, worked with it, as a tool to tell the story, like Melis did with magic tricks.  One reviewer opined that Scorsese may have saved 3D.  Scorsese must have had great fun.

The film is perfectly cast.  Without Sir Ben Kingsley and Sir Christopher Lee, the story is diminished.  Caught on the cusp of adolescence, Asa Butterfield and Cloe Moretz, are terrific.  To watch the whole cast work together is a joy.

4958317,5,B0064YON8G,"Martin Scorsese's new film is many things:  A marvelous Dickensian tale of childhood wonder, a portrait of our enduring love of gadgets and gizmos, and, above all, a description of our intense relationship to those marvelous things we call moving pictures.  His lifelong love of film shines in every frame.  The tale is based on one true fact:  George Melies, who was one of the early movie pioneers in the 1900's, was largely forgotten when Hollywood was in full flower, and, at the end of his life was reduced to selling toys in a train station kiosk.  Only in 1929 was he fully recognized as one of the greats.  Scorsese, who has devoted much of his career to preserving and restoring our film history, clearly believes that Melies' surviving work (some of which shows up in a dazzling melange of clips at the end of Hugo) assures his position as the first true Auteur in film history.  In telling this story, Scorsese has pulled out all the stops in his formidable arsenal of cinematic tricks:  Awesome long tracking shots (especially at the beginning of the film), unusual camera angles, superb editing, and, best of all, formidable production design.  Every set is itself a veritable Cabinet of Wonders, full of fascinating mechanical contrivances, beautiful old books, etc.  The photography is just plain gorgeous (I saw the 2D version) - each detail as sharp and clear as I have ever seen in a Blu-ray disc.  I have never seen a more beautiful film.  Along the way, we see many interesting details of how Melies made and edited his films and the equipment he used.  And, of course, the Writing Automaton is a treasure.

4958335,4,B0064YON8G,"HUGO is a strange film. It purports to be for children despite the fact that the screenplay written by Josh Logan based of the book 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret' by Brian Selznick has more references to words and people and events that children would not relate to on the same level as adults. It is a spectacle in the order of director Martin Scorsese with some of the most beautiful contraptions and mechanical wonders ever filmed.  It seems in many ways to be an homage to the history of filmmaking in the manner in which the rather disjointed story is presented.  Likely it comes across better in 3D than on the small flat screen.  Not that the film is without special merits: there are many moments of impressive philosophical values, child/parent relationships, and a few comedic turns.  The cast is solid if somewhat underused in this visual mechanical Parisian extravaganza spectacle, but it well worth watching as pure entertainment  - and that is really OK!

The story is well known: Hugo (Asa Butterflied) is a lad whose inventor father (Jude Law) salvaged a broken automaton from a museum to fix it but dies before accomplishing that: his Uncle Claude (Ray Winstone), a drunk, is let in charge of the lad.  Hugo is soon left alone in the bizarre train station in Paris where he tends to the multiple clocks, misses his beloved father, and fends for himself by shoplifting food and a few `parts'. He is caught by a rather glum Georges Mlis (Ben Kingsley) who runs a toy store while bemoaning his current lack of the thrill of living, despite the nurturing he receives from his wife (Helen McCrory) and his adopted daughter Isabelle (Chlo Grace Moretz) who longs for adventures.  In time Hugo and Isabelle become fast friends and discover the secrets held by Georges and it is through their efforts that joy and the dreams of the aged filmmaker are resurrected.

There are some sidebars - an injured WW I veteran who serves as Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) who dreams of the attention of the flower lady Lisette (Emily Mortimer), Madame Emile (Frances de la Tour) who sips coffee while tending her dog and attracting the attention of the hefty Monsieur Frick (Richard Griffiths), cinema devotee and historian Rene Tabard (Michael Stuhlbarg) who opens the doors to the mysteries that have collected during the story), and the odd Rene Tabard (Christopher Lee) who part is questionable.

The cast is strong - especially the children - and the special effects are very lovely to watch.  The film takes us to the land of fantasy and it is worthwhile trip. Though the film seems to be impressed with itself and the revelation of the history of cinema, it offers many pleasures. Not sure it is a DVD to buy, though.

However, because the expectation of an ultra-clever, ultra-exciting storyline from this extravagantly reviewed, 5-Oscar-winner film was so stratospherically high, its overlong, often standstill plot turned out to be a catastrophic letdown, causing me to nosedive into a near-irreversible funk -- and forced to rely on my remote's fast-forward button more than once.",1330473600,10,847,5.558139534883721

Yes, it moves slow compared to current day films like Transformers where there is hardly time to blink between action sequences. For a popcorn flick, Transformers is fine. For a quality drama/bio movie this is high quality. This is not a ""Hollywood Elitist"" as some have said. Hugo has a solid over all cast, a charming old world feel, and it paced more like a drama, because that is what it is.

The 3D part seems of little value. If you have Blu-ray then get that version. If you are thinking of getting a 3D TV, wait until the next generation hits stores. They will require no glasses and will likely have better quality.",1330473600,3,906,4.236994219653179
4958339,4,B0064YON8G,"There was a lot of buzz over this film. It was the best while others were disappointed. I decided to see for myself. I had heard that it was the story of a boy's fascination with movies and the film certainly takes its time getting to that part of the story.
HUGO seemed painfully slow moving for the first 15 minutes as we see images of young Hugo's life in a train station in Paris. There is almost no dialogue in those 15 minutes and finally the title HUGO fills the screen.
It didn't feel like an exciting story but finally we got to the story of Hugo and his relationship with his father and the ""automaton"" they are working to repair. An automaton is a robot-like figure with intrique workings and this one looks like his function is to write something. Tragedy strikes and Hugo ends up living behind the clocks in the train station. Hugo spends his days making sure the clocks in the station are running, stealing food to survive and stealing the parts he needs to repair the automaton. He's always one step away from being caught by the station inspector and sent to an orphanage.
Hugo is wonderfully played by Asa Butterfield. At times Hugo seems to be a small child and at other times much older than he really is. Asa is totally charming and delightful and the orphaned Hugo.
Hugo's life changes when he has a run in with Georges, the seeimingly-unplesant owner of the station toy store. Georges's goddaughter befriends Hugo and finally the adventure of the store begins. It's very far into the story before the fascination with motion picture begins. We eventually learn Georges identity and his history and his connection to the automaton. The story is contrived but somehow it works and we become involved in the silent era of motion pictures.
HUGO is a visual feast of a magical world of clocks and mechanical devices. The train station setting is a appealing and we have a superb cast of characters. We get insight into their characters and begin to see why some have become broken and disheartened in life.

4958343,5,B0064YON8G,"Martin Scorsese is primarily known for two things: making gritty, true-to-life movies (usually set in New York City) that chronicle violence and human chaos in all its nasty forms; and loving, utterly treasuring, the art of cinema.  HUGO belongs firmly in the latter category.  It's a movie about movies; moreover, it's a movie about cherishing movies, a summation of an entire art form from one of its most devoted admirers.

There is a plot here, of course: young Orphan Hugo hides in the walls of a train station, working the clocks and carrying for a robotic figure his father found in a museum.  He steals parts from a local toymaker to keep up the machine; when the toymaker catches Hugo in the act, he steals the boy's pocketbook, and Hugo sets out to get it back, with the aid of the old man's goddaughter, Isabelle.

If you simply want a family movie, then HUGO will work sufficiently.  It has a plot; it moves along at a decent pace.  But to truly appreciate how magnificent this film is, you have to approach it from an entirely different point of view: that of a film lover.  This is, in effect, a very serious, very moving, very effective film.  The acting from the two child leads, Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz, is nothing short of wonderful; child actors are usually a sticking point for me, but Scorsese knows how to ring a fine performance from all of his actors (it doesn't hurt that both have already proven themselves to be talented up-and-comers).  Ben Kingsley delivers one of his best performances in years (perhaps of his entire career).  Other supporting players get to shine in their brief roles: Christopher Lee, Jude Law, Ray Winstone, Emily Mortimer, Helen McCrory, Michael Stuhlbarg, Frances de la Tour, and Richard Griffiths (it's a whole HARRY POTTER reunion) all make significant, even if minor, contributions.  Sacha Baron Cohen, as the single-minded (and strongly anti-orphan) Station Inspector, provides some of the film's weaker moments; not Cohen himself, as his performance is dependably strong, but more the character, whose slapstick shenanigans try to remind us that this is a family film.  (Cohen is clearly aware of this, and provides decent bursts of humor elsewhere, and yes, some of it tends to lean towards the ""young adult"" spectrum of things; younger children, fortunately, probably won't catch on, and adults will get a good belly-laugh.)

But the true heart of HUGO lies beyond the casting.  It's Oscar-winning effects are utterly dazzling (and I only saw it in 2D; when I finally see it in 3D, as it's intended, I think my heart will stop with pure joy).  The cinematography is also just spellbinding, and also Oscar-winning (the film took home five statues, all for more technical aspects, which is appropriate because this is one of those films where even more casual movie-goers will notice things like lighting and score). Everything comes back to Scorsese's lovelorn directing; he's a man with a crush, and he's writing a brilliant love note that goes far beyond ""check yes or no.""  HUGO may not be Scorsese's best film, but it is certainly his most special.  Anyone with a pulse can feel the love here--and it is real, genuine, and reciprocated in full.",1330387200,16,3222,4.8699633699633695

From the trailer we assume that there is something magical about this little robot and that it is the subject of the film. If you see the movie with that in mind, waiting for the robot to take on a life of its own, you will likely become bored or disappointed and lack interest in the real storyline. In reality, the robot is more prop than actor. This might explain why Hugo didn't get a wider audience when it made its theatrical run. Like the real subject of the movie, the fictionalized life of turn of the century film maker and magician, Georges Mlis, there is slight of hand, but in this case misleading the audience does not amaze them.

4958357,5,B0064YON8G,"Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo"" is a beautiful to watch period piece of a movie.  Set in 1931 in a large Paris railroad station, the movie is a coming of age story for its young protagonist, Hugo Cabret and his friend, Isabelle.  Hugo is an orphan who lives in a garrett in the upper reaches of the train system and survives largely by petty thefts.  He also has great mechanical talent and is working on restoring a mysterious automaton that his father, before his death, had recovered from a museum where it had been stashed in a corner and ignored. Much of the movie centers on young Hugo and his friend arriving at a sense of where their lives will take them.

""Hugo"" also is a celebration of the power of the imagination as displayed in the early history of the movies. As the story develops Hugo meets an old pioneer of the movies, Georges, who has been reduced to operating a toy stand in the station. In his young days, Georges had been a magician and then a producer of movies in a palace-like setting.  The movies frequently starred his wife, Mamma Jeanne.

A third broad theme of the movie is redemption.  Georges, embittered by the loss of his film career and by the apparent indifference of the public towards his efforts receives through his acquaintance with Hugo a measure of recognition and understanding.

The use of 3D movies, replete with the goggles, has all the elements of gimmickry but in Hugo the gimmick works. The goggles help capture the large scenes of clockwork and moving parts in the film as well as the several scenes filmed precariously far from the ground.  Through music and lighting as well, the film captures the ambience of Paris and a busy railway station replete with an officious police inspector and many of the shopkeepers at the station.  Subplots and love interests add much to the story.

With all the excellent acting and effects in the movie, its main focus for me was in its director, Martin Scorsese.  Many of his movies, including ""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"", and ""The Gangs of New York"" with their focus on the raw, violent character of urban life moved me greatly over the years. In contrast to most of Scorsese's work, ""Hugo"" has an endearing lightness.  It is a movie of creativity, redemption, and hope.

As for this DVD release, it is almost bare bones.  There is one documentary included (as the bluray has this doc and a few more featurettes).  What would have been great would be a director's commentary to best explain those one or two portions that would benefit from Scorsese's explanation.

In his quest to repair the mysterious automaton that his late father left behind, Hugo befriends a young girl named Isabelle whose toymaker godfather may or may not be intimately connected to his father's automaton. Lavishly shot in 3D, Hugo evokes a strong sense of cinematic nostalgia, demonstrating Martin Scorsese's very personal love for the magic of the movies, and it's a delightful treat for all families, whether they're full of cinephiles or not.

4958360,5,B0064YON8G,"The first thing that really stands out in this movie is the cinematography.  I don't believe I have ever seen a movie with such stunning and engaging visuals.  I regret that I did not see this in 3D as that must have made the visuals particularly breathtaking.  Of course, I believe every aspect of the film was done extremely well.  What I like to do when I watch a movie is get really enmeshed in the story and try to put myself in the shoes of the characters and think about how they would feel.  In ""Hugo"" that is very easy to do as the characters (to me anyway) have a lot of depth and emotion and are full of life.  I find it very easy to feel for these characters and root for them.

  There are many great performances in this movie.  First, Asa Butterfield gives a moving performance as the title character.  His tearful expressions and at times melancholy demeanor are truly heartbreaking.  This young actor is truly gifted in giving a deep performance.  His young co-star Chloe Moretz (who plays Isabelle) is also fantastic as an adventurous type who helps bring Hugo out of his shell and who offers him true friendship and support.  Ben Kingsley is incredible as well in his portrayal of Georges, a cantankerous old man who is covering up the deep pain he feels about the path his life has taken.  Also of note is Sacha Baron Cohen, who portrays a comedic, yet at times frightening station inspector.  Even the background characters truly stand out. There are enough side stories in the train station that you almost feel like you are a part of the crowd at that station, getting an intimate look into the social dynamics there.

  I also greatly enjoyed the plot of the movie as it unfolded.  I won't give much away, but suffice it to say these characters have all crossed paths for a great purpose and have quite an impact on each others lives.  This is definitely my favorite movie that came out in 2011.  I think this movie will leave a lasting impression for many years to come.  Not a movie for cynical people or ones looking for a rousing action film.  However, it is definitely a movie that can be enjoyed by dreamers and those who appreciate movies with a depth of emotion and who are good at feeling empathy for movie characters and appreciate the humanity portrayed by them.",1330300800,8,2297,4.492753623188406

4958363,5,B0064YON8G,"Available to view as 2D and 3D, this is the 2D review:

Having heard a few reviews for this film, I still didin't quite understand what ""Hugo"" was about. All I gained from the reviews was that it was about a boy and his father building an automaton (robot),... and yet, it was also about a passion for movies. I was like,... ""huh"". After seeing the film, I can tell you that it is an historical fiction piece. The primary story is that of one of the first film makers. His was not the first film made, but I believe he was the first to make an actual ""motion picture"" with a story, and the first SciFi film. Georges Melies was a French illusionist who found that film was a great medium with which he could create wonderous illusions. He was a prolific inventor and created many autotronic or robotic devices, built innovative cameras, and was perhaps the first cinematographer to use special effects of any sort. One of his best known films was ""A Trip to the Moon"", a true classic, well known to any student of film. This is the historical part of the film (this information is not all totally in the film but was included here for reader/filmgoer insight).

The fictional part of the film takes place in France, a bit later, sometime in the 1920's and revolves around the boy, Hugo, whom happens upon Mr. Melies quite by mistake as he is trying to ""revive"" an automaton which he and his now deceased father had been working on. The film is both entertaining and educational - paying homeage to perhaps the first great film producer - and overall well done, with excellent acting by Ben Kingsley as Georges Melies, Asa Butterfield as Hugo, Chloe Moretz as Hugo's friend Isabella... and a not un-humourous role of station inspector by Sasha Cohen. I like to break movies down to their elements and examine each closely, but I also get an overall feel from a film when I walk away from it. My overall feel was a thumbs up five star rating... each item broken down warrents five stars as well,... humor, acting, story, set design, costume design, cinematography...... The only wonder here is WHY this is called ""Hugo"" and why it seems to revolve around a clock. Martin Scorsese's attempt at luring the public in to see a documentary perhaps ??? In any case, it is both entertaining  and a visual pleasure... I have seen the 3D version as well, but the 3D doesn't add much to the film...

After running into shop owner George Melies (Kingsley) and his daughter he is forced to reveal his secret to them, which sets off a chain of event that changes him and the city.  I have to start by saying that this is not a movie for everyone. I really liked it but it is very slow moving and for the casual movie watcher it may seem like nothing happened.  That statement may seem strange but after you watch it it will make sense to you. This is a movie that each scene builds on the next (like most Scorses's) and is hard to talk about without giving anything away but I will say that it is a movie that entertained me all the way through.

4958386,4,B0064YON8G,"Martin Scorsese has a deep love for movie history and film preservation.  Both passions are imbued in Hugo, a charming tale of a child's personal search that leads to a treasure of memories and redemption.

At a Paris train station in 1931 a young boy, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) lives a solitary existence.  The train inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) lurks about looking for stray children to send to the local orphanage.  One day Hugo notices an elderly watchmaker (Ben Kingsley) who sits lonely and silent.  Joined by a curious girl, Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), the two join forces to investigate the old man and learn that there is much more to him than meets the eye.  Add to this a mysterious mechanical man built by Hugo's father and known as an automaton whose cryptic writings may provide clues to the past.  But how to unlock these secrets?  What the young couple finds will lead them back to the old man as there seem to be a surprising connection, and through the old man, a remarkable past is rejuvenated that will harken back to the birth of movies.

As the mysterious, old man, Ben Kingsley provides the gravitas to flesh out a character that at first seems dull and lonely, whose past catches up and reveals a lifetime of hope and genius heretofore forgotten by the public until Hugo and Isabelle rediscover it.  The kids are well cast although Hugo comes across a bit of an oddball whereas Isabelle is a sweet girl who compliments him.  Cohen, quite effective in a villainous role, is properly mean and threatening until he has a change of heart near the end, and you wish there had been more of him because his character evolves toward the end.

In fact the whole heart concept permeates Hugo.  There is the budding love between Hugo and Isabelle, the old man's romance in his past, and even the hint of love from a flower girl.  There is the heart shaped key that unlocks the automaton's mechanism.  The automaton serves as a static character, a kind of Pinocchio in scenes where Hugo talks to it in the absence of his father.  Above all, it's all about a love for movies past and present.

It is clear how much Scorsese loves movies in smaller, intimate scenes as when Hugo and Isabelle sneak into a Harold Lloyd film or when he shows snippets from earlier moving images.  The main thrust of Hugo's plot provides Scorsese the excuse to restage classic kinescope and film clips.  It's like reliving history.  Film buffs will love these moments as Scorsese lovingly and painstakingly recreates early silent film.  We see history and magic being made simultaneously!

A minor problem with the film is that it feels a bit uneven at times, and you never feel fully engaged with the characters as much as you want to be.  Hugo and his friend Isabelle should be the focus all the way, but the film seems to occasionally stray from their journey.  As a couple, they are more tentative and reserved than Harry Potter and his friend Hermione in the Harry Potter series.  It lacks a strong emotional center.  One wonders how a director like Steven Spielberg or Tim Burton would have interpreted the story.
Technical and production quality are superb.  This is a fully realized fantasy world especially with the overall design and art direction and costumes within the train station and immediate neighborhood.  Even the visual effects work well within the story without being a distraction.

The film does works for both children and adults.  Hugo in a way represents the painful and joyous past that people keep hidden until it is released by patience and love.",1330041600,4,3574,4.717741935483871

4958388,5,B0064YON8G,"Most of the reviewers here have been very careful to preserve the plot surprises in Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo,"" and I will be too, although by now many writers have spilled the beans. So all I will say is that ""Hugo"" is one of those very rare movies that lives up to the phrase, ""movie magic."" Scorsese has us in the palm of his hand from the first shot, a magnificent panoramic sweep of a Paris train station circa 1930, and keeps us there all the way to the expected happy ending. The basic story--Hugo (Asa Butterfield), a misprized Parisian orphan who keeps the station clocks running, even as he tries to evade capture by the officious station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen)--is one just about any child can relate and thrill to. But the story really opens up once it gets to Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley), curmudgeonly proprietor of the station's toy shop, and his beloved goddaughter Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz).

""Hugo"" can best be described as a voyage of discovery, using extraordinarily sophisticated cinematic techniques to create a marvelously sustained mood of childlike wonder. As Hugo and Isabelle, piece by piece, uncover the life story of Papa Georges, Scorsese pays glorious tribute to the early days of the cinema, and to the pioneers who created it. This is the first film I have ever seen in which the director uses 3D to advance the story, not just to provide chills and thrills to the audience. The effect is that of Scorsese, like Papa Georges within the movie, waving his magic wand to cast a spell of enchantment over the audience.

Scorsese's usual crew is here--photographer Robert Richardson, designer Dante Ferretti and editor Thelma Schoonmaker--and their work is flawless. Also flawless is the cast; ""Hugo"" features a veritable honor roll of some of the best actors working today, including the aforementioned players as well as Helen McCrory, Emily Mortimer, Ray Winstone, Michael Stuhlbarg, Richard Griffiths, Frances de la Tour, and--in a brief, poignant cameo--Jude Law.

If I were as curmudgeonly as Papa Georges, I could complain that the story of ""Hugo"" stretches a little thin toward the end. But considering the glittering cinematic art that surrounds it, that complaint is extremely minor. It's a cliche to say a movie will delight children of all ages, but in the case of ""Hugo,"" it happens to be true.",1329955200,14,2343,4.926582278481012
4958389,5,B0064YON8G,"One of my favorite Oscar moments a few years ago came when after a highly distinguished career, fellow directors Spielberg, Lucas, and Coppola finally presented Scorsese with his first and long overdue directing Oscar for The Departed.

Throughout an illustrious directing career, Scorsese has directed some of the most critically acclaimed movies ever made, such as Raging Bull, Cape Fear, Goodfellas, and The Aviator, and many many more.

Not only is he a great director, he is also a tremendous movie scholar, responsible for keeping in circulation classic movies such as Thief of Bagdad, a 1941 masterpiece, which influenced him, Coppola and Lucas, and the classic Red Shoes by Powell and Pressburger.

In addition he lectures in University on the movies, and you can get his dvd&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Personal-Journey-With-Martin-Scorsese-Through-American-Movies/dp/6305941122/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese Through American Movies</a>, which explores movies by well known directors of the past such as King Vidor, Fritz Lang, Cecil DeMille. Watching this made me realise the importance and contribution of the director.

Hugo leads the Academy award nominations list this year with 11 nominations, closely followed by The Artist with 10, Warhorse, The Descendants, Midnight in Paris, all outstanding movies. Nominations for Hugo include Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay.

As the movie begins, in one extended shot we zoom through a bustling Paris railway station in 1931, and you become instantly aware that this is no ordinary movie. We meet a 12 year old urchin named Hugo who lives there. Circumstance has committed him to winding and repairing the clocks, and scrabbling for survival as a railway urchin, and we notice that he has a tremendous gift for repairing gadgets, be it watches, clockwork toys, or automatons. Although the story appears to be about a boy, it quickly morphs into a dual story as he comes into contact with a store owner in the station, from whom he steals, and his young granddaughter who befriends him. Secondary stories develop with various other characters at the station.

The store owner played by Ben Kingsley is based on a real life character George Melies, and the story develops in simply amazing ways, and the urchin combines with a young girl to reveal a mystery to which she holds the key, a boy, a girl, an automaton, movie magic, and the story works in wonderful ways.

I saw it in 3D and I believe this is the best way to watch, so see it if you can while it is still in the movies. As you watch the movie moves ticks along like clockwork, and we have extensive intricate imagery that I was at times simply in awe as I watched the movie, we have crosscutting between the events of the time, and silent movies, with parallellism and repetition from classic movies occurring in the actual story. This is where Scorsese's scholarship and love of the movies shows through, as the the two children meet a movie scholar who looks a little like Scorsese, and ultimately the movie becomes a homage to cinematic genius.

Ben Kingsley does an extraordinary acting job, and I was particulaly gripped by one emotional moment few actors could do with the same effect. As you watch this movie, if you're like me you become totally transported, some of the imagery and ticking sound effects remain with me even as I write.

It turns out that Martin Socrsese and I share the same birthday so we share a little more in common than a love of the movies. I highly recommend this movie. It's quite spectacular.

I think you will love it, and I hope this was helpful.",1329782400,9,4607,5.548433048433049

4958391,3,B0064YON8G,"I expected a lot before watching this film but was a bit shocked that I found it sincerely boring. To see a director make a film just to may some sort of a tribute to his own profession, film - making, is just not that overwhelming. I like dramas based on the human emotion, it seems this is specifically based on creating magic out of nothing. THE ILLUSIONIST and PRESTIGE are films based in similar era's that tower over HUGO. Hugo is a primeval film about machines and man at the dawn of the cinema era. I don't blame myself entirely for not curbing my apathy towards this film. It is not a bad film - it is just ordinary and hardly moving.

Watch this if you don't mind watching a two hour long film based in early 20th century about an orphan.

I have a sinking feeling that M.S thinks he nailed crime/drama films after THE DEPARTED and won't be making a film with that bent again. He is starting doing these tributes to film making - SHUTTER ISLAND for instance, what was that all about?! Yet, that is a much better, more laconic film than Hugo (Which I doubt will figure in my top 15 of last year)",1329609600,3,1104,4.252380952380952
4958392,1,B0064YON8G,"If ever there were a DVD which called for commentary and extra features, ""Hugo"" certainly would be at the head of the list. Opportunities abound:

  **Even those knowledgeable in the history of cinema could use a refresher on Lumire and Georges Mlis and their contribution to the history of film. Equally interesting for those who have been to Paris (as so many Americans have,) are the differences between the Montparnasse railroad (which no longer exists,)the Lyon station, and other real Parisian stations which tourists walk though today and are used in bits and pieces to form the set.
  **The author of the novel on which the film is based, Brian Selznick, saw an automaton made by the Swiss watchmaker Henri Maillardet in the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia and incorporated it into his story line in the print edition. An equal influence was the Jaquet-Droz automaton ""the writer"" still works and can be seen at the Muse d'Art et d'Histoire of Neuchtel, in Switzerland.
  **Few know that dream sequence in the film depicts the famous Gare Montparnasse train derailment, an actual event famous in the history of railroading. Why not original photos?
  And the list of the missed opportunities could go on and on. How expensive would it be to run a voiceover track with the director and principals? How many struggling US film students would gladly make a documentary as their final project and give it to the producers for nothing, merely to their work featured in a major DVD release?
  Amazon offered the DVD for sale prior to the release date of Hugo, which occurs ten days from the time this review was written. Let us hope Amazon's information was incomplete and the coming DVD offers more than just a rerun of the film. If not, buyers may want to wait to see if, like so many releases, a ""collectors edition"" with ""bonus features"" is offered in the fall. This shabby way of making extra money is increasingly common these days by even the largest operators in the industry. If Hugo wins some Academy Awards--and it will-- Hang on to your credit card. You might be glad you did.",1329523200,24,2091,4.796657381615599
4958393,5,B0064YON8G,"I am a fan of movies.  Have been since I was 7, growing up in Spain where my entertainment choices were limited.  Some people think I may be a tad too fannish about the movies.  In any case, I see an average of at least 100 new (to me) movies a year, so I have more than just a passing interest in them.  I told you all that to say this:  Hugo is hands down the best movie of last year, and for a few years before.  Hollywood has been putting out some really bad sludge out there recently, and this is an example of what is great about movies.  I call it, in my case, a Willy Wonka moment.  When I first saw Willy Wonka when I was 4, I was transported to a new world that I didn't think was possible and everything was magical and fun and scary and thrilling, all in the space of about 2 hours.  It had a profound effect on me and started my lifelong thrill with the movies.  Occasionally, I get these moments, but not often.  Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Back To The Future are but a few.

Hugo is another.

At first, from the ads I could not figure out for the life of me what it was about.  It was marketed terribly, and if I didn't have a friend who told me about the story, I would never have gone.  Without giving too much away, the story is about a young orphan named Hugo who lives in the Paris Rail Station, maintaining and winding the clocks, a job his uncle had before his father (a watchmaker) died in a fire.  His uncle, a drunk, took him in and showed Hugo the ropes and then died one day anonymously on the streets.  Hugo continues on with the work, and at the same time steals small machine parts from a toymaker to rebuild an automaton his father and he worked on before his father died.  The automaton draws something that pulls Hugo into the life of the toymaker who has been disappointed with his lot in life.  Without giving any more away, Hugo's interactions with all the characters collude together into a wonderful, life-affirming story of helping broken people gather their lives back together and go on living.  It is a story of friendship, love, and ultimately that we are here for each other and we never know the effect we may have on somebody's life.  The movie actually moved me to tears.

The movie is also a primer on the birth of cinema with the historical backdrop where the story takes place.  Giants in the early movie industry show up in the movie and shows why the magical cinematograph became the art form of movies.  It celebrates the artistry and passion these early pioneers had for the craft and why artists do what they do.  This is where the movie took me away.  It reminded me of the wonder still possible in a well-told, artfully rendered story.  Scorsese is at his peak in this film.  If you get a chance to see it in 3D, watch what a master can really do with a 3D palate in his arsenal.  Avatar (and by extension James Cameron) was really good, but this is one of the best masters of the art form rendering an almost perfect picture.  You will not be disappointed, unless you are a fan of Scorsese's earlier, more violent works such as Goodfellas, Raging Bull and Taxi Driver.  This is totally different, another side.  This is the consumate artist at work.  Do yourself a favor and see this as soon as you can.  You'll thank me.  I know I thanked my friends who cajoled me into seeing it.",1329436800,5,3407,4.253894080996885

It certainly wasn't in this case ... it made me feel like I was really a part of the movie, going on the adventure right along with Hugo. Asa Butterfield and Chloe Moretz were also fantastic, as of course were Ben Kingsley and Sacha Baron Cohen. I can easily say this is one of the five best movies I have ever seen.",1329350400,6,519,4.2

Technically brilliant, beautiful to look at, it is probably the best use of 3-D ever in a film: subtle and understated, it adds depth not gimmicks. Scorsese's love of the film medium is evident here as he pays tribute to the early days of the industry and to one of the great pioneers of the screen. While Selznick's story of an orphan's life in a Paris train station is fiction, much of the film's backstory is based on fact, including the forgotten Melis' life as a toy merchant, the loss of his studio, the rediscovery of his lost films, even the train crashing through the station wall. It's a film that deserves its 11 Oscar nominations. If you crave 3-D action flicks, don't bother. If you love fine filmmaking and care about the history of movies, I highly recommend Hugo.",1328918400,14,835,4.573333333333333
4958420,1,B0064YON8G,"Very dissapointing movie!  Classic paid off ""Hollywood Elite"".  I had read all the reviews before going with my family to see this long and very boring movie, and we all expected something incredible.  That was not the case.  My 3 kids fell asleep before the 1/2 way point.  My college son, asked if he could leave and see something else after 25 minutes.  This is the honest take on this movie.  You don't have to make up a bunch of B.S. to justify wasting your time sitting thru this movie.  This is not a kid's film or a family film.  You have to like long, drawn out, narrative, European-like documentaries in order to like this movie.

Both my husband and I have read the book, along with our kids, and this director took way too many ""off-roads"" from the original story.  The boy was also younger in the book and numerous aspects were changed.  In addition, 1/2 way thru the story, the movie shifts away from Hugo's story to Ben Kingsly's character being the center of attention, and both of them didn't do a very good acting job.  I don't mind a director's twist on a story, but be honest and cop to it in a review...no one comments on that.  If you want to do an adaptation, then do it correctly or at the very least acknowledge your changing it for Hollywood.

Also, this is a French story, why aren't the actors speaking French or at the very least have French accents!  That lost everything for me.  You go to a restaurant and order a steak but they give you chicken, ""hey that's o.k. cause it's artsy chicken and that justifies and substitutes for steak?""  I don't think so!  Sasha Cohen did a mediocre impersonation of Peter Sellers as inspector Clouseau. But at least Sellers had a French accent!

Hugo Cabret is French, the actor who played him spoke ""British English"" so did all the other main characters...Wheres the great acting there?  At a cost of $180,000,000 dollars they couldn't hire a French accent coach?  Wheres the masterpiece of acting there? It isn't even true to character.  I don't quite get that.  If you realize and then accept the fact that all the main characters spoke heavy ""British English"" and everyone who comments positively on this movie, ignores that critical aspect entirely.  How can you justify yourself being an individual thinker if you can't even acknowledge that important aspect.

Asa Butterfield was so monotone and un-engaging.  His performance was so ""ho hum"" they could have found a much better kid actor in Hollywood and not have to go to Great Britan to find this lousy kid actor.  Not once did any of us feel any compassion for this kid.  Not once did this kid actor engender a connection between his audience and himself.  Jude Law is in the movie for a ""blink"" of a moment.  Chloe Moretz is American, she doesn't speak British English, so if they had a coach, why wasn't she speaking with a French Accent?  Or did they hire her solely for her French last name?  That would have been real acting, as a French character if she actually spoke with a French accent.

Everyone talks about how incredible the 3D is, well for $180,000,000.00 I would expect to see ""gold"" flying out of the screen.  Hey don't get me wrong, the animation sets are very pretty.  But this movie is all computer animated farce. Since when did artificiality become artistic?  And this your reviewers call ""artsy, fartsy"", cinema verte'?  How does that justifies so many major flaws and exclusions in the movie?  I don't think so. In a movie where the characters were born and live in France, why aren't they apeaking in a French Accent?  That's ridiculous.  That lost all credibility for me.

In addition, I see nowhere that any of the Reviewers make one comment about the fact that for kids to see this movie where the main character spends 1/2 his time stealing food, toys, parts, etc., yet no reviewers comment on this?  This is what my kids should see and be told is great artistry?  Baloney!  In other movies where a kid is unlikeable because he behaves selfishly, the reviewers are all over it and spouting paragraphs about such a despicable character portrayal even if that is the character in the book.  But, with Hugo Cabret - directed by Martin Scorsese, if you put the lable ""artsy"" on a $180,000,000 dollar long and boring ""flop"" of a movie, then it's elevated to ""g_dlike status.  What a joke!

If this was any other movie besides a Scorsese, your reviewers and professional reviewers would have attacked everything wrong about this movie and pointed out all these issues.  Instead most of you just ignored all of these important issues under the guise of ""masterpiece, artistry, Scorsese, etc, etc.etc.  But all of you who think it's just wonderful obviously can't think or react for yourselves.

None of you make one comment about these important issues, which are very critical to the story itself.  Yet you rush to defend every sentence of your ""mind-blown"" experience of this movie.  Think about it.  This is Hollywood bought at it's best.  In 2 1/2 months the movie has barely made $55,000,000 dollars in revenue and it cost more than $180,000,000.00.  It was expected to be a big hit in Europe because of it's French story background and it has bombed overseas!!  So it has bombed in America and also in Europe.  So I guess that justifies Academy Award status for the Hollywood ""weirdo elite"".

I would think twice about seeing this one before it comes out on DVD for 1/2 price.  And who said the Academy Awards weren't a bought off scheme of Hollywood.  Yeah, how does this movie get nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award, but none of the actors are nominated for their acting?  How can you have a best movie based on the characters, but none of the characters were important enough to get nominated for an Academy Award?  Just more games  They understand it's just another way to increase revenue and payoffs!  I would expect that as much money has been spent on marketing this movie as the cost itself.  Look at the marketing games being played out on this movie which started more than 9 months ago.  Guess what, nominations and biased awards doesn't mean anything and definitely won't save this movie!",1328745600,41,6162,4.64967562557924

If you do not care about the history of film, especially silent film, then you may not get this film at all.  That's too bad. I see this with The Artist as well.  Both films are not strong in the Box Office.

What I ask is that you give yourself a chance.  Rent it.  Rent both of these.  If you have any memories of going to the movies as a child or ever saw Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd or Charlie Chaplin, there are silent films that truly hold your interest. I saw Metropoliis completely silent and with no music as a teenager and exposed to more silent films in college.

But let's back to Hugo.  It is a childrens story.  It is a story about the silent era. There really were amatons. And the films of George Miele (sp) were rediscovered.  TCM just showed them.  So this is a leap for the regular film audience.  I think this is a very special film.  The Oscars are a confirmation that this is a Special Film.

4958435,5,B0064YON8G,"""Hugo"" is a drama genre film where the calamity of several lives intermingles with each other, at the Paris Railway Station of Gare Montparnasse.

The narrative follows Hugo Cabret, an orphan boy, who is fending for himself whilst maintaining all the clocks at the train station, and living in the servicing areas.

It is a broken automaton that brings many of the film characters together. After the death of his father Hugo believes that returning the automaton back to working order, which has a writing function, will contain a message from his dad, and he works tirelessly to achieve this.

The automaton connects more than one broken heart and Hugo's comment that: ""machines don't come with spare parts...so as humans we have to assume that there are no spare parts in our world, and that we all have a purpose,"" is striking as philosophically poignant film dialogue.

The viewer is presented with a stupendously crafted story, complemented by wonderful acting, and accompanied by breathtaking film shot selection and vivid colour.

The photography is stunning, gorgeously shot, with lots of steam vaporing out at you.  Luminescent, yet muted hues, the soft glow of Parisian lighting, sparklers, enormous roller coaster-like Escher clocks moving and ticking and turning in such a way as to make your stomach flip and rise as you follow along as if in your own dream.  Also, the two main characters, glistening wide-eyed child actors, steal the show with their acting abilities, complex expressions and cherub faces.

Anyone involved in film making or the film industry in general will love this film.  It IS a film about film making afterall and had to have been produced extremely well because of that.  It shows how creative and wonderous film making can be, with dancing characters spotted through a backdrop of aquarium water fish swimming over the glazy scene, it is by far one of the most entertaining 3D movies I have seen.  It is right up there with Avatar, only very different, very artistic.  The plot ties up succinctly to make a tight, exciting story.  The visuals are what this movie has the most of and that's its best feature.  It is pure visual magic. I cannot believe they can make movies like this.  I cannot imagine the cost.

4958437,5,B0064YON8G,"**Originally posted on ""#1 Hits From Another Planet"" - 11/30/11**

I'm an enormous fan of well-made ""kid movies,"" or as I like to think of them, movies for the uncynical and young at heart. I think one of the biggest reasons they appeal to me so much is that they cut to the core of things. Oftentimes, a coming-of-age or childlike film gets right down to who a filmmaker is at their essence. This happens more often when great writers and directors are at the helm of these movies. They feel very personal. That's one of the reasons why I consider this and JJ Abram's Super 8 to be my favorite movies of the year.

Based on a children's book by Brian Selznick (which, it kills me to say, I actually haven't read), Hugo is a completely unique, almost dream-like fable. I went in with little knowledge of the story and no expectations, which I think is the best possible frame of mind to be in before you watch this movie. After about the first fifteen minutes (more of an introduction to the title character's world... which ends with a stunning reveal of 1930s Paris) I found myself utterly engrossed. Riveted, even. This feeling lasted through the entire movie and the weird thing is, it's not a wham bang action thriller with huge plot twists and explosions. It's not the kind of thing I'd expect to be riveted by... yet there I was.

Now that I've given it some thought, I can put it down to several factors. First, the world of Hugo is utterly immersive. The color palette, the cinematography (the angles used to shoot inside the station are just thrilling to watch) and the side stories of the different goings on inside the station all add up to create a sense of place that's absolutely transportive. It's like a classic painting come to life. Story and character aside, it's beautiful to look at. But that's selling the story short. After awhile, you do know where it's going, but the journey to get there had me guessing. What's up with this strange boy's salvaged automaton? Or the mysterious toy seller, or the secrets his dead father seemed to know? I love a good mystery, especially when it pays off as well as this one did. I didn't expect the rich taste of history and filmmaking we get in the film's latter half. This is that deep, personal connection I was talking about earlier. It definitely feels like this is Scorsese's core. You almost expect the movie to head in a fantasy direction. What you get is quite different, and far more affecting.

Finally, I'd be leaving a gaping hole if I didn't at least mention the acting. It's uniformly excellent... ""kid movie"" or not. I've loved everything that Chlo Grace Moretz's done, so it's no surprise that she's amazing here (and it's nice to see her playing against the Let Me In/Kick-Ass type). Sacha Baron Cohen hams it up a little much here and there, but turns in a performance that ends up to be much more layered than it first seems. Ben Kingsley has one of the tougher performances and plays a critical role in the central mystery. He carries it off brilliantly, of course. And Asa Butterfield, the youngest of the bunch, carries the movie on his shoulders with a pair of ultra-expressive blue eyes that often speak louder than any line he's been given. He's the heart of Hugo, and wouldn't be a total shocker come Oscar nomination time.

The vague marketing isn't doing Hugo any favors, but if you like intelligent, engrossing, character driven movies (that just happen to star a child), you've got to check this out.

4958442,5,B0064YON8G,"I went to this movie having no clue what it was about and really feeling it was going to be a waste of my money (I rarely find movies worth paying theater price for).  However, this movie was a total surprise and a pleasant one at that.  Here's why:

1. Plot.  This is an actual STORY.  Instead of leaning on special effects and ""eye candy,"" this movie has an actual plot and a good one at that.  The story includes mystery, intrigue, fantasy, and complexity (but not too much so).

2. Cinematography and art.  The cinematography used in this movie was not only very well done, but also fit the movie style.  This movie is truly art.  Not just in its visual aspects, but the film is incredible and fits in beautifully with the story.

3. History and complexity.  Hugo ties in real film, history, and blends it in beautifully with fantasy. I learned a lot about an historical figure without feeling like I was watching a documentary.  (Until I did research later after the movie, I had no clue if the character existed in real life or not).

4. Heart.  Not just a great story.  Hugo displays characters that seem real, not posed, especially as most children seem in modern movies.  Each character has the potential to resonate in the heart as the story line progresses.  And the ending is heartwarming for sure.  Not one of those ""ball your eyes out"" or unrealistic endings.  Just a Real. Good. Story.

5. Family friendly.  There is no foul language, enuendo or controversial lessons taught in this movie.  Parents can let their children watch it without feeling the need to cover their eyes or ears or explain to them something that they have seen or heard.  What's better, is that the parents may get more enraptured in the story than the kids...",1326758400,6,1747,4.561290322580645

I was mesmerized for the first 10 minutes.  Then I started looking for plot.  The film develops slowly, which does not bother me--I'm all about build up and character development--but at some point,the various threads need to come together in an engaging way. This film is only mildly engaging. Based on reviews, I knew it was about Georges Meilies, so no surprises there, but I WAS surprised that the only really interesting part of the story happens near the end when Mieles' career plays out.  Hugo's story, his journal, even the automaton left to him by his dead dad--they are all thinly tied together, mixed in with some unfunny side story featuring Sascha Baron Cohen. Hugo actor Asa Butterfield has wide, glossy, baby blue eyes, but little facial expression. My sons and niece were bored to tears. If you like technical virtuosity, see it in 3D because it is state-of-the-art.  The film is visually beautiful, sweet, innocent, and somewhat educational; maybe that is enough, but it does not deserve the praise lavished upon it by critics.",1326672000,9,1197,4.768115942028985
4958474,3,B0064YON8G,"Nothing in this film is quite as magical as the sources it feeds from: Paris, the age of Steam Trains, Dickens, magic, Melies, young love and the Cinema.  Still, Scorsese gives it his all, showing  the world he's the Jack LaLanne of film directors: the great overachiever still flexing his muscles.  It's all so charming that you'll quickly be worn out and ready for a quiet walk by the Seine, without all that tinseltown frosting.

Somehow this manages to feel sincere and contrived all at once: as though this paradox flowed through its literary and cinematic DNA.  On the whole, it was an experience I'm glad to have had.  However,  not one I'm dying  to repeat.

Some of the actors (especially Ben Kingsley) are terrific.  Sasha Baron Cohen (it has been noted repeatedly) stumbles badly here.

There was one element in the film which did strike me as worthy of highlighting:  the closing title song, delivered with soul and finesse by a fine young French pop star.  Download it, and save the store the film in the wine cellar.  Watch it some winter afternoon when you're home with the flu.  It would make a lovely companion.",1326240000,7,1128,4.683673469387755
4958475,2,B0064YON8G,"Martin Scorsese doesn't make movies that attract me. Too male oriented, too focused on making bad guys look good. I thought this might be different since it's about a child and about movies -both topics which usually engage me with little effort. Well, it wasn't. I took several of my younger children, ages 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13. The 9 year old loved it, the middle ones were so so, and the teen hated it.

I found the movie to be very slow and self indulgent in that only someone with Scorsese money and reputation could have destroyed a really good book and still have it hailed by critics. The acting was good, and the interwoven story about the two children (one looking for family, one looking for adventure, both orphans) was engaging. Another thread of the story, about the long lost history and people of early movie making was also engaging. Both could have been full movies in their own right. The thread about the train station police man and his extreme beliefs about duty was silly as were the thwarted attempts by the tea lady and her lover to get together and neither seemed<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hugo/dp/B003Y5H5H4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hugo</a>&nbsp;to belong to the overall story, other than as plot devices to create scenes or incidents.

Everything was neatly linked together and tied up at the end, as is appropriate for a children's story, but that was another problem for me. I couldn't really decide if Hugo, the movie, was made for children or adults - the themes were too vague for children to comprehend and there were too many threads for the children to understand which was the main theme and which were plot devices. My own children were very divided on what the movie was about, and I just wished we'd skipped the whole thing and gone to see War Horse again.",1326153600,14,1843,4.884984025559105

For some reason, the masses haven't flocked to this film in theaters, but don't let that fool you into thinking it is second tier in any way.  ""Hugo"" is actually one of the best films of 2011 and one of the best family films ever (that adults will enjoy even more).  Most importantly, this is one of the best LOOKING films I've ever seen.  James Cameron himself called the film a masterpiece and praised it's use of 3D.  As of my writing this I can say that ""Hugo"" and ""Avatar"" are easily the two best uses of 3D yet seen.",1326153600,69,605,4.271929824561403
4958477,5,B0064YON8G,"Over the last few years I have been increasingly jaded by special effects. The last time I recall being really blown away by special effects was the 1977 STAR WARS. It seems that more often than not today, the effects either dominate or get in the way of the story. Scorsese has managed the difficult feat of hitting just the right balance. AVATAR was supposed to be the film experience that took movies to the next level, but frankly, it didn't do that much for me. But I viewed HUGO yesterday on the big screen and it was an absolutely stunning and magical movie experience! I saw it in 3D and was mesmerized from start to finish. Asa Butterfield is pitch perfect in the role of Hugo and everyone of the supporting cast all ring true. I'm not a big fan of Sasha Cohen, but he is riveting as the train station policeman. Christopher Lee and Ben Kingsley shine as well. As another reviewer stated...it's not for everybody. But as a person with an interest in the beginnings of films this movie resonated deeply with me. This is more than an homage to silent films...it is a sincere love story about them, lovingly crafted by Martin Scorsese. I often felt like I was living in a dream as I watched the story develop. In particular, I savored the scenes in the old book shop. This film was a revelation and a perfect fit for 3D (and Blu-Ray) presentation. Sure it can be predictable at times, but that is also part of the allure. Sit back and appreciate a movie master doing his best to take you on a two hour magic carpet ride. The set design, the music, the acting and the atmosphere...bravo Martin Scorsese! You've made a masterpiece.",1325635200,33,1635,4.471571906354515
4958478,4,B0064YON8G,"This is NOT, I repeat, NOT a children's movie! I must emphasize this, as you may have been misled by the PG rating. (The children's book it's based upon has been fundamentally changed.) This is a wonderful, heart-felt, visual feast, dedicated to cinephiles everywhere! Movie lovers are rapturous over it, while children brought along by well-meaning parents are bewildered and bored.

The opening scene is a magnificent, deeply dimensional, 3D shot of a massive clockworks. It segues into traffic headlights encircling the Eiffel Tower and an aerial view of 1930s Paris. From that moment I knew I was in the hands of a master filmmaker! We are behind the scenes (in the walls and attic) of a huge Parisian train station where we see how they maintain the clocks: oiling, winding, repairing and fine-tuning them. It's no wonder the orphan boy charged with these marvels sees the world as a giant clockwork; his entire life centers around oil cans, counterweights, gears, flywheels, and mainsprings.

Director (and Film Historian) Martin Scorsese (""The Departed"") brings us this wonderful cast:

  * Asa Butterfield (""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"") is our eponymous hero, striving to unlock the mystery of his father's death. He lives in the walls of the train station, stealing what he needs and living by his wits. He is apprenticed to his drunken uncle, thus he works on the clocks.
  * Jude Law (""Sherlock Holmes"") appears briefly as our hero's all-too-soon-dead father, but he was working on an automaton, which Hugo now sees as something he absolutely must complete.
  * Ben Kingsley (""Shutter Island"") is Georges Mlis, the center- piece of this tribute to early French cinema. A magician turned cinematographer in 1895, this innovative pioneer was very nearly forgotten despite his almost 500 films made prior to WWI. This homage includes a moment when he is belatedly honored for his contributions.
  * Chlo Grace Moretz (""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"") is a girl who joins our young hero on an ""adventure!"" Her first taste of the cinema is the well-known clip of Harold Lloyd hanging from the face of that clock. This film is checkered with many such classics.
  * Helen McCrory (""The Queen"") is Jeanne Mlis, wife of Georges. This actress was so convincing as an older woman, I was impressed by her makeup when she appeared younger. Silly me!
  * Emil Lager (""Cheerful Weather for the Wedding"") fooled us all. We thought he was Johnny Depp, doing a surprise cameo as a guitar player in the train station!
  * Sasha Baron Cohen (""Brno"") is the gendarme determined to catch our boy and send him to an orphanage. Well, catch him he does!
  * Emily Mortimer (""Our Idiot Brother"") is a sweet flower vendor in the station. The gendarme gets tongue-tied around her.
  * Christopher Lee (""Season of the Witch"") is a librarian who directs our youngsters to books on topics they are researching.

We were pleased to see the emphasis placed on the value of books. Courtesy of excellent 3D, we cringe from a horrific train wreck and struggle with the children as they try to push through a crowded train station. We revel in the discovery and restoration of many of Mlis' well-known film clips and marvel at his ingenuity.

This is an excellent film for film buffs, not for children and I'm sure Amazon.com will notify me as soon as it's available.",1325548800,5,3337,4.8465608465608465
4958479,5,B0064YON8G,"Martin Scorsese's 'Hugo' is his first family friendly entertainment, but just like all of his endeavors, his film pays dirt.  Filled with passion, innocence, yet shrouded in mystery, 'Hugo' works well by its own merits, but, having seen it in 3-D, it can't be said enough how much the enchanting story unfolds like a flowing pop-up book.  (While 'Avatar' wins the prize for being elaborate, 'Hugo's 3-D experience is more worthwhile, my best to date.)

It is the camera lens that gives us such a wide-eyed (pun intended) view about an orphaned boy who works the clocks at a Parisian train station while trying to uncode a message from his late father.  Besides his dire circumstances, he must contend with two nemeses:  One is from the toy vendor (Ben Kingsley) at one of the train's stands and a policeman (Sacha Baron Cohen) who patrols the depot and is fond of coralling wayward orphans.

The story is embellished by some love interests, including an unlikely girl who becomes Hugo's companion, a flower vendor (Emily Mortimer), and the toy purveyor's wife.

Not only do the 3-D effects unveil some breathtaking cinematography, but the way both the screenwriter and Scorsese unfold secret messages, secret identities, and secret hideaways, make for a treasure chest of a movie.

As has been stated elsewhere, 'Hugo' is a tribute to moviemaking, but it does its best work by its own merits.  'Hugo' is a triumph of filmaking and antecedently a tribute to all the geniuses, particularly one early one, who have made films a worthy and sometimes thrilling art form.",1325376000,3,1565,4.920152091254753
4958480,5,B0064YON8G,"One of the last movies I saw in 2011 was also one of the year's biggest surprises, and I mean in the most pleasant of ways. I had heard good things about the movie, and yet, I delayed and put off going to this movie because... it's a kid's movie, right? Wrong!

""Hugo"" (125 min.) is director Martin Scorsese's most unexpected movie ever (for me anyway), I mean how can you reconcile this gentle movie with the maker of Taxi Driver and Mean Streets, just to name those. The plot of ""Hugo"" has already been described in other reviews, so I won't go into it again. The movie really blossoms in the second half when instead of focusing on the young Hugo, the movie clearly becomes a ode to... the movies in general, and film preservation/restoration specifically, a cause near and dear to Scorsese's heart At that point you can really feel Scorsese's touch all over this. I found myself nothing short of transfixed for the last hour or so.

If you have a chance to see this in the theater still, by all means make sure to go see this in 3D. Indeed, in my book this is the best movie in 3D since Avatar, and one of the few movies that really take full advantage of the 3D technology. In all, I found this movie to be one of the most memorable and enjoyable movies I've seen all year, and that is really saying something as I see a lot of movies.",1325289600,5,1340,4.271653543307087
4958481,5,B0064YON8G,"Hugo, the latest film from cinematic maestro Martin Scorsese, is both his first film geared for families and his first film shot in 3D. While many noteworthy directors have been weary of the new format, some greats have embraced it and been eager to try it. James Cameron, not the inventor of 3D but certainly a recent innovator, upon seeing Hugo, called it the best use of 3D he'd seen. No matter what your thoughts on 3D may be, this is no small feat coming from this man. The film, based on the novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick and with a screenplay by John Logan, who also penned Scorsese's The Aviator, Hugo is largely billed as a family film but it's worth noting that the film's biggest fans will probably be adults, although there's enough whimsical fantasy to tug at the heartstrings of even the most jaded child.

Hugo largely takes place in the early 1930s at a Paris railway station. Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is a young boy whose father (Jude Law), a clockmaker, dies suddenly in a fire. His alcoholic Uncle Claude (Ray Winstone) is responsible for maintaining the clocks at the railway station and teaches Hugo how to do so before taking an indefinite leave of absence. Hugo, left all alone, lives within the walls of the train station, maintaining the clocks, acquiring food by stealing, and spending his free time trying to fix the automaton his father left behind. The automaton is a mechanical man that, once wound up, is supposed to write; his father found it difficult to fix and it's Hugo's mission to see that it finally works. To successfully accomplish this goal, Hugo steals mechanical parts from a toyshop owner named Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley), a callused, angry old man who eventually catches Hugo and steals his blueprints that guide him in fixing the automaton. Hopeless, Hugo befriends Isabelle (Chlo Grace Moretz), Georges goddaughter, and begins to uncover the mystery of Papa Georges cinematic past. The film co-stars Sacha Baron Cohen as the feared Station inspector, who will happily whisk Hugo away to the orphanage if he catches him and Christopher Lee as a generous librarian who specializes in finding a good home for books.

Hugo is without a doubt the most visual film that Scorsese has ever directed. Armed with a large budget, the film is heavy on CGI yet moves with the grace of a silent film. The production design by Dante Ferretti and the art direction, credited to ten people, is luxurious and Oscar-worthy, although I confess that it's hard to differentiate between reality and CGI at times. The look, among other things, is completely different from anything Scorsese has made before. The man that directed such gritty films as Mean Streets and Taxi Driver has had a much smoother style in recent years with films like The Departed and Shutter Island, but until now Scorsese has never made a movie that could truly be described as a visual feast for the eyes. As for the story, it's easy to see what made Scorsese respond so strongly to it but taken at face-value it's a rich, lovely fairy tale with shades of Charles Dickens. Of course, in true Scorsese fashion, it's also a history of and love letter to cinema with the importance of film preservation being a theme at the forefront of it all.

The performances are great all around, striking and heartbreaking. Butterfield carries the emotional weight of the character well, while Moretz continues to establish herself as one of the best child actors working today. Kingsley delivers a performance that is, at first, cold but gradually turns to sympathetic. Cohen is quietly hilarious but brings genuine pathos to his role. It's a memorable performance that proves what a gifted actor he is and it's worthy of an Oscar-nomination, although if anyone is nominated it will likely be Kingsley and deservedly so.

As Hugo is very much a cinematic love letter to early cinema, young children may be bored by it. It has enough magical imagery, but I'm not sure how successfully it could capture some people's ADD-riddled attention spans. It's one of the most classic-feeling modern films I've seen, which could be good or bad depending on your perspective. However, it's a joyous film that both children and adults should give a fair shake.

In my humble opinion, Hugo is one of the best films of the year. Who else but Scorsese, well-known as such an incredibly passionate lover of film, could make such a wondrous film about the wonder of film? It's a celebration of all that cinema can be, as well as where cinema came from. It illustrates the progression between cinema being made of dreams to becoming the thing dreams are made of. It's amazing that a major studio would release this film at a time when major studios are largely considered creatively bankrupt. In making a film that celebrates early, silent cinema Scorsese seems to be winking at the audience by creating a film that could not exist without modern technology. Hugo is a perpetually heartwarming and smile-inducing film. Beautiful, not just aesthetically, it's a triumph of spirit; a soulful, magical masterpiece that actually brought tears to my eyes.

GRADE: A

As for the 3D; I've always preferred to see 3D used as the gimmick that it is rather than seeing an attempt to be artistic with it. I was not impressed by James Cameron's Avatar and have only seen it used with true purpose in Herzog's Cave of Forgotten Dreams. Truth be told, I have not been particularly impressed with any use of it I've seen thus far. That changed with Hugo. Scorsese does not use it as a gimmick, but as a way to provide the film with an additional dimension and deepen one's immersion into the overall experience. Would this film still function as magically without it? Yes, it would. Does this use of 3D actually add something to the experience? Undoubtedly. While 3D is still not a fad that I'm particularly hip to, it's good to see a director trying to use it with purpose and actually succeeding.",1325203200,41,5980,4.783155856727976
4958482,4,B0064YON8G,"Not entirely successful as an entertainment, but still a marvel to behold. The expert use of 3D creates depth and texture, though much of the production looks artificial. This may be - actually it is likely - intentional as this artifice echoes the subject of artifice which absorbs much of the movie, whether focusing on magic, automatons, or filmmaking. The classically styled adventure of a boy fending for himself in an unusual setting and the characters who inhabit the small world he is intimately familiar with segues into what is ultimately an exploration of the most magical of early cinema pioneers and a plea for film preservation. That this is accomplished so entertainingly is a small wonder itself. That the plea for film preservation is delivered through the very medium that is driving film presentation out of broad public view is somewhat ironic.",1325030400,4,864,5.048951048951049
4958503,5,B0064YON8G,"HUGO begins from a high altitude perspective over Paris. After centering on a long-distance view of Montparnasse railway station, the lens zooms-in over the city's streets and rooftops, enters the station from the track side, swoops along a platform between two trains and among scurrying travelers, comes into the station's arrivals and departures hall, and finally comes to a stop in a close-up of a set of young eyes peering out from behind a large clock set high on the concourse wall. The alluring imagery of the film is immediate.

Date stamped by one particular real event that takes place late in the plot, the year is no later than 1929, though an on-line summary of the movie places it in the early 1930s. Never mind, it's pretty much irrelevant to an appreciation of this bravura production.

The story centers on the 12-year old orphan, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield), who, after a lifetime of familial misfortune, alone maintains the huge station's clocks while living inside the building's forgotten infrastructure. His presence has gone unsuspected by Station Inspector Gustav (Sacha Baron Cohen), a bitter and pitiless wounded war veteran who walks with the aid of a dodgy leg brace, and who dedicates his time-on-duty apprehending - with the aid of a big, black Doberman - parentless children wandering the great terminus and packing them off to an orphanage. Hugo's secret existence is precarious as he steals food from the Montparnasse's food vendors and tools and small gears from the owner (Ben Kingsley) of a toy repair booth located within the station. Young Cabret uses the stolen items from the repair shop to attempt to fix a non-functioning automaton from his deceased father's former clock shop. Once again operable, Hugo hopes the mechanical figure will do ... well, something ... that may somehow prove to be a message from his Dear But Dead Ol' Dad.

HUGO is Martin Scorcese's tribute to the ground-breaking French illusionist-turned-film maker Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s who, between 1896 and 1913, directed - and often stared in - some 531 short (1-40 minute) silent films, most of which have since been lost. Georges himself, I suspect, is virtually unknown by most of the public except a knowledgeable few in the film industry, though any one may have seen, at some point in life, a scene from his film ""Le Voyage dans la Lune"" (""A Trip to the Moon""), that of a canon-fired spaceship hitting a humanized Moon in the right eye.

The visual presentation of HUGO is positively magical, especially as rendered in the 3-D format. Unusual camera perspectives linger lovingly on moving gears and machine parts, clock pendulums, abandoned labyrinthine spaces (within the Montparnasse infrastructure), as well as the chaotic and crowded ambiance of the station's public areas.

Students of film will appreciate the significant inclusion of rescued, archival footage from M&eacute;li&egrave;s's silents.

HUGO was the first of a cinematic doubleheader attended by my wife and I on Christmas Day, the second being the latest Mission Improbable episode, GHOST PROTOCOL. As gripping an action film as the latter is, I wouldn't bother to attend it again or review it. HUGO, however, I would see once more (at least) just for the utter delight it brought me - that same delight a child experiences on first gazing upon a fireworks display, or first holding a puppy, or perhaps first eating an ice cream. A delight that comes less often as we age. It's the purest reason for seeing any moving picture show, and the reason for their making that M&eacute;li&egrave;s understood and Scorcese understands.",1324857600,3,3621,5.087542087542087
4958504,5,B0064YON8G,"Having read and loved Brian Selznick's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Invention-of-Hugo-Cabret/dp/0439813786/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Invention of Hugo Cabret</a>, I was eager to see the film adaptation, especially in the hands of uber director Martin Scorcese. He does not disappoint - this movie far exceeded my expectations, and I actually loved it even more than the book. It was like whatever I had imagined while reading the book (which has lots of graphics btw) was brought to life, only even better!

My husband and I took our almost seven-year-old daughter to view this and she was riveted. It is difficult to imagine any child or adult not being captivated by the visuals in this movie. They are truly magical, and though my daughter is obviously too young to get some of the subtler undertones and themes in the movie, she was able to appreciate the visuals and follow the basic premise of the movie.

The story itself is one that tugs at one's heartstrings and imagination. Young Hugo Cabret (finely nuanced performance by Asa Butterfield) is an orphan who has lost his father (played by Jude Law) in a fire and is now living on his wits, keeping the clocks running in a large train station in 1930s Paris. His uncle is the real timekeeper, but for a large portion of the movie, we do not know where the drunk has got to. Hugo's father was a clockmaker and had been restoring an old automaton, an object of fascination for both father and son. Upon his father's death, Hugo takes over the automaton, and tries to get it to work, using his dad's notebook as a guide. He steals parts from wherever he can, including the store of Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley), who catches him in the act one day, and becomes irate with anger when he sees the notebook.

Over a period of time, young Hugo forms a friendship with Papa Georges' goddaughter, the orphan Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), and the pair discover some of Papa Georges' long-buried secrets. Hugo is in peril though, as the station inspector, Gustaf (Sasha Baron Cohen) holds no tolerance for young orphans and makes it his mission to catch them and have them hauled off to the orphanage. Emily Mortimer plays flower seller Lisette, whom Gustaf pines for, but is afraid to make the first move for fear of rejection and self-consciousness at his crippled leg.

There are several bit roles played by some recognizable actors which add to the charm of the movie, but the real appeal of this movie revolves around young Hugo's attempts to get his automaton to work, and how he eventually finds his way 'home'. Along his journey, Hugo discovers the history of cinema, and all the wonders associated with it. The director's love of films shines through in every frame, and the beauty of this film is that it truly dares us to dream and give flight to our imagination!

This is a magical film, and a homage to the magic of film-making, that will capture the hearts and minds of viewers, both young and old. The film is rated PG, as there are some intense scenes, though I'd have to say Hugo's father's death is more subtly portrayed here, alluded to by a giant ball of fire. There are some scenes which younger viewers might find scary, such as the scenes of Hugo being chased through the train station by the Station Inspector, etc. but on the whole, the movie is great entertainment for the family.",1324771200,5,3408,4.828767123287672
4958505,4,B0064YON8G,"Martin Scorsese is a well respected director known for R-rated films usually revolving around crime or gangsters in some capacity. Saying the F-word nearly 300 times in one movie, stabbing someone with a pen, flushing a stash down the toilet, getting whacked, getting blown up, and getting your mind blown to such extremities in the last twenty minutes of a feature that you win an Oscar for it even though somebody already made that movie before; these are the things that come to mind when you think of Scorsese. Scorsese hadn't really worked with children much over his career or at least not to this extent. So that was interesting to keep in mind when Hugo started making the rounds. A family friendly Martin Scorsese film seems so surreal, but is more than a worthy addition to an already overflowing resume full of fantastic cinema.

It takes a while for Hugo to really get going, but it's certainly beautiful in the meantime. The film is a visual spectacle while each frame is an absolute joy to look at. You're taken through the intricate insides of various clocks at a train station; seeing their gears move as the use of steam adds just the right amount of mystery. It's not so much the fact that Hugo is slow because it isn't. There's this veil of mystery that isn't lifted until Hugo (Asa Butterfield) finally caves and tells his story. The various clocks and train station setting keeps you occupied and the long introduction with no dialogue is extremely noteworthy. It's just for nearly half the film, you have all these elements (clocks, the train station, a notebook, an automaton, and Hugo's father) without much of a connection. But it does all come together in extraordinary fashion.

The cast is really superb. Asa Butterfield is so passionate and emotional. Those blue eyes of his tell the story better than words ever could. Chloe Grace Moretz is so optimistic and eager for a chance at an adventure. You can't help but adore the Isabelle character. Sacha Baron Cohen seems to step way out of his element here. The Station Inspector seems like a complete 180 from Bruno or Borat, but his sense of humor is still in his performance. He just happens to have a bit more depth in comparison. Ben Kingsley's Georges Mlis goes through such a transformation in the film though that he's able to display such a wide range of emotion. He plays the broken old man impeccably.

There are times when movies affect you in a way that let you know they are special. For me, it's like I'm suddenly overcome by a wide range of emotions that make me want to laugh, cry, scream at the top of my lungs, and the overwhelming sensation of never wanting that moment or the movie to end. I'm not ashamed to say I felt that a few times during Hugo. James Cameron called Hugo a masterpiece and it's really difficult to argue with that. There isn't a weak point in the cast, the visuals are outstanding, and you find yourself connecting to the story. You're sucked into this world right from the start. Hugo is one of the most beautiful and charming films of the year.",1324771200,5,3065,4.620183486238532

4958507,4,B0064YON8G,"Few read reviews to find out whether the reviewer liked the film. They want to know whether THEY will like the film--to decide whether to see the movie or not, and whether to see it in the theater or wait and see the DVD (or the download). That's the task I'll take on here.

As the Rottentomato website has already shown (it assembles and correlates scads of reviews from the press and the web, along with reader responses), the critics adore this film, the audience somewhat less so.

Part of this has to do with managing expectations. The marketing presents Hugo as an Avatar-ish 3D fantasy with a C3P0 (StarWars)-type flying robot. this is actively misleading, though that's not the director's fault.

What Hugo is, is a fable--not a fantasy--that's part tween adventure and part infomercial for the preservation and viewing of old silent movies. Most importantly--and this is a point that hasn't been made by most reviewers here and elsewhere--it's a film about ex-magician/early filmmaker Georges Meli&eacute;s that Scorsese made, to a degree, IN THE STYLE of a Georges Meli&eacute;s movie. That's part of the homage.

Thus ""Hugo"" contains a lot of adventurous running-around, a brilliant exploitation of the best 3D filmmaking technology extant, and a leavening of slapstick elements--particularly from the surprisingly restrained Sascha Baron Cohen.

It's a fable based on real events in the early history of movies. ""Sleepless in Seattle"" was a fable with no fantasy elements other than its happy-ending-inevitability, which you feel from beginning to end. That's the essence of a fable, not whether it has fantasy elements or not. A fable is a kind of ritual that reaffirms the tribe's values and faith in its vision of life.

Hugo reaffirms faith in goodness--that even in many apparently hard-hearted people there's an ember that can be fanned into life by the right person. The movie's vibe from its first seconds tells you that you are riding towards a happy ending.

Two Russian intellectuals that I saw the movie with hated that fact. They think a movie is unrealistic unless everyone's doomed, and if you'd grown up in the Soviet Union that was probably realistic. Especially since Soviet-era fable-movies did guarantee a happy ending--""happy"" as defined by Soviet ideology at least. So for my friends. fables aren't just false, but evil State Propaganda. And a lot of Americans who fancy themselves intellectual have a similarly jaundiced perspective about Hollywood's addiction to guaranteed by hook or by crook happy endings.

I think this issue stems from not understanding the ritual validity of fable. I love realistic movies without this guarantee of happy outcomes, but I also love a good fable. I'm certain of my spouse's love for me and of my love for her. I'm certain of our relationship with our closest friends, as they are of us reciprocally. I'm certain of the law-abidingness of my society (especially compared to the third-world countries we've traveled in). Predictable good outcomes are, within reasonable constraints, reasonable to believe in, in many ways.

So ""Hugo""'s ultimate predictability is a valid artistic choice. It's not a spoiler to say this because you know it from the start and you should know so you don't confuse this with a Sundance-type art film where everyone is confused and faces an uncertain future, usually alone. I apologize for ""Hugo"" not being a slit-your-wristsathon. I also like such films, and they usually set your expectations from the start as well, for that matter.

So who will enjoy ""Hugo"" ?
1. Bright tweens. It stars a pair of bright tweens, so this is a natural. Many younger kids will like it as well--it's visually a treat, and it is based on a kids' story. But duller/much younger/Disneyfied kids who want nonstop action and/or the relentless cheerful action of a Disney film will probably find their attention wandering in places.

2. Everyone who's interested in the history of filmmaking--particularly right at the beginning.

3. Everyone who's interested in modern filmmaking. This does represent the absolute state of the art in 3D cinematography--where its 3Dness is integral and almost taken for granted, not tacked on, not poke-you-in-the-eye, not several layers of 2D images.

4. Everyone who's interested in good fable direction/screenwriting/acting. This is not to say anyone involved in this project can't do naturalistic films or fantasy films, or, in the case of Chloe Grace Moretz, naturalistic fantasy films (""Let me in""). So no negatives are proven here. That said, I believe the casting was spot on for the major and minor roles. This is one area where Scorsese didn't copy the stagy mugging of Meli&eacute;s' films (except during re recreations of those films). The large, intent close-ups of the major characters really exposed their acting chops, and all came through. The boy, who I'd never seen before, kept it subtle, as well as the other juvenile character, Isabelle (played by Moretz). The young actors in many youth-oriented films tend to mug--again, Disney movie style--and kids who expect that need to be prepped by their parents to look for more lifelike acting here.

Who won't love it?

1. It's not a Selena Gomez/Demi Lovato/Disney vehicle. It's nothing like Lindsay Lohan's wonderful ""Parent Trap,"" one of the best of the normal good-quality kids' film. It too is a fable, but it isn't overlaid with all the stuff about film history and suchlike. ""Hugo""'s ideal kid audience is going to be like Isabelle in the move--sweet, bookish, curious, and not locked into peer culture as the source of everything that could possibly be of interest to one.

2. People who don't like the fable genre. The film embeds pretty naturalistic performances and note-perfect sets showing a Paris train station circa 1931, where most of the action takes place within a non-naturalistic film fable. There are lots of non-fable films. See one of those unless you really do want to see state of the art 3D cinematography and want to ratchet up your suspension of disbelief in order to watch this.

3. People with zero interest in film history. This is where a lot of movie critics err. Of course nearly all of them are fascinated by early film history. But this film verges on being a high quality 2 hour infomercial for film preservation, and you know, reading this, whether such prolonged self-regard on the part of the filmmaker towards his medium will fascinate or annoy you.

4. Adults who don't like films starring children. I detect this bias in people who criticize the performances of ""Hugo""'s two junior leads, who are both exemplary. Also, I hadn't seen the boy before, but I have seen Moretz costarring in the grim, critically acclaimed ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Let-Me-In/dp/B004BLJQOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Let Me In</a>,"" in which she portrays--with almost no dialogue and almost no special effects--a bloodthirsty (literally) yet profoundly conflicted child vampire, and in which those averse to sunny endings will get their wishes more than satisfied. And in which her appearance and performance have been compared favorably to a very young Ingrid Bergman. That is, she has gravitas. Of people in her age bracket, the only other actor I can think of who has that is Hailee Steinfeld (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Grit/dp/B003UESJME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Grit</a>).

My point here is that Moretz's acting chops are now an established fact. She has a far less complex character to portray in ""Hugo,"" yet even in Isabelle's wide-eyed pre-ingenue role she infuses her character with a kind of luminosity that holds its own even when she's sharing the screen with great adult actors like Ben Kingsley.

5. Adults who only want to see heavily plot-driven films. It's not like ""Hugo"" is one of those kaleidoscopic non-narrative films. It tells a story, to be sure. But besides the child-centered narrative there's a biopic about Georges Meli&eacute;s (and his wife) here, told in flashback, along with excursions into film history. Some people will find that as rich as a multicourse meal; others will be annoyed by ""Hugo"" not being propelled by a singular narrative drive. Such people will sit there saying ""All right, Scorsese--get to the point!""

6. Those who are really reluctant to pay to see the film in a theater, even if they're eager to see it on DVD. I agree with this feeling nearly all of the time. However, some films are so visually huge--and, especially, if they're 3D and do that well--you need to bite the bullet and see it in a theater, if only to compare what it's like in a theater in 3D with what it's like on your flat screen TV at home in 2D. Hey, you can always see it in a bargain matinee, as we did. But we'll probably get the DVD when it comes out as well, because it both makes and recalls film history.",1324252800,363,8936,5.090163934426229

4958511,5,B0064YON8G,"Different people go to the movies for different reasons.  Some of us want to be entertained. Some of us want to be dazzled. Some of us want to be engaged by a story, or by characters that stick in the mind after the film is done. Some of us want to be transported to a different time or place. And some of us want to see talented actors create a bit of magic in the hands of a masterful director. Martin Scorsese's Hugo does all of these things. It is, more than any other film I've seen this year, _why_ we go to the movies.

The film is based on the novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick. If you've read the book, then you know the story already, but for everyone else I am going to be careful here and not reveal anything that might spoil the film. I will say that Hugo is about many things, but at its heart, it is about obsession, discovery and how one person's story can lead to - and become entwined with - another's.

The film is set in Paris in the 1930's, in a railway station where an orphan boy named Hugo (engagingly played by Asa Butterfield) lives in the workspaces in the station walls and in the station's central clocktower. He spends most of his time keeping the station's clocks running (so that no one will come into the walls or the tower and discover his hiding places) and pursuing his obsession - fixing a man-shaped automaton designed to write with a pen which his father (Jude Law) had found in a museum and was trying to repair when he was killed in a fire. To feed himself, Hugo scrounges and pilfers food from the various food shops in the station, which draws the attention of the station  inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen). To feed his efforts to repair the automaton, Hugo steals parts from a toy shop in the station, run by the elderly Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley), who finally catches him in the act. He is befriended though by Papa Georges' god-daughter, a girl his age named Isabelle (Chlo Grace Moretz), who ends up helping Hugo pursue his obsession of fixing the automaton. Which, Hugo is convinced, has some secret message for him left by his late father. Where this ultimately leads... you'll have to see the film. Telling you here would only ruin the film's joy of discovery.

There are so many good things about Hugo as a film that it's hard to know where to begin. I can at least start by saying that the look of the film itself is dazzling. Scorsese creates worlds within worlds, taking you first back to Paris in the 1930's and from there into Hugo's hidden world within the walls and clock tower of the train station. And from there, other places that are equally wondrous.  The 3D is not wasted here and truly adds to the feel of Hugo's world of narrow passages and massive time-keeping mechanisms with their enormous but intricate gears, springs and pendulums all in motion.  And Howard Shore's beautifully crafted musical score evokes the period throughout the film, adding to the feeling of being transported to a different time and place.

Another thing that makes Hugo so worth seeing is that Scorsese is one of those directors who can bring out the best performance an actor has in them, which he does a magnificent job of here, from veteran actors like Ben Kingsley and Christopher Lee to comparative newcomers like Asa Butterfield and Chlo Grace Moretz.

And just as the look of the sets shows his attention to detail, the populating of the world with characters shows it as well as he makes the train station come alive with its regular denizens, from Sacha Boren Cohen's officious station inspector with his leg brace and the pretty young flower seller Lisette (Emily Mortimer) he secretly yearns for, to the comic attempts at romance between Monsieur Frick (Richard Griffiths), an elderly newspaper seller who keeps attempting to woo Madame Emile (Frances de la Tour), a cafe owner who dotes on her dog who unfortunately attacks Monsieur Frick every time he comes near. Scorsese also works in some famous historical Parisian residents of the period into the background, like jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt (Emil Lager), artist Salvador Dali (Ben Addis) and writer James Joyce (Robert Gill).

Highly, highly recommended for anyone who enjoys movies, and an absolute must-see for anyone who loves movies and what they mean to us.",1323302400,580,4297,4.6272965879265096
4958512,5,B0064YON8G,"If you just looked at the trailers, you might think Martin Scorsese's latest film was about nothing more than a little boy living in the clockworks at a train station in Paris, having magical, vaguely steampunk, Harry Potter style adventures. You'd be mostly wrong. Hugo is, instead, at its heart, a film that's about films and the people who love them.

The main character is a boy named Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield), who, like most of the French people in this movie, speaks with an English accent. He's been living at the train station ever since his father (a clockmaker), died, leaving him an orphan in the care of his drunken uncle, who maintains all the clocks at the station.

Young Hugo takes over the job after his uncle disappears, though this is a secret that isn't known to the station denizens, including the local police chief (Sasha Baron Cohen). He spends his spare time stealing food and occasionally swiping bits of clockwork from an old toy maker (Ben Kingsley). This goes well for him until one day when the toy maker catches him in the act, and finds a notebook on Hugo detailing a clockwork automaton that his father was working on repairing.

The toy maker goes a bit bonkers over this, and confiscates it, telling Hugo he's going to burn it. Then his young goddaughter (Chloe Grace Moretz, who thankfully doesn't kill anyone in this film), takes pity on the boy and tries to help him out. They're both surprised to realize that a key she wears around her neck fits into a keyhole on Hugo's clockwork man. They're even more surprised when the image the automaton draws is one of the Man in the Moon with a rocket sticking into his eye. That the girl's godfather is named Georges might start to give some in the audience pause for thought.

I loved this film from start to finish, and it's by far the best film I've seen this year. It really does have everything, and oozes a love of film like nothing I've seen in a long time. The power of film to move the audience is explored here in ways I've never seen before, and like any good movie, it does an excellent job of showing me things I've never seen before.

I also greatly enjoyed the fact that the movie takes time to slow down and explore all the supporting characters. The policeman, the flower girl, the newspaper seller, the woman at the cafe. They all get their own stories, and those add something wonderful to the film, and something sadly lacking in most movies that can't wait to get to the next explosion and haven't time for character development for their main characters, much less supporting ones.

The 3D effects must be addressed. I'm not a fan of 3D, not even remotely. I find it a distraction, for the most part, and generally regard it as a way for movie studios to pad out their profits. It's generally unnecessary and adds nothing to the plot. Even in the best 3D film I've seen before this, Avatar, it wasn't that much more than a gimmick, though one used to good effect.

In this film, though, it really does add something. It really does give a whole new dimension to the movie. I guess this isn't a surprise with a filmmaker like Scorsese. In his hands, this isn't a distraction, and it isn't a gimmick. I'm willing to bet that the film is just fine without 3D, but with it, it really becomes something unique and fascinating. If all 3D films were this good, I'd be less unhappy with them.

Hugo is a masterpiece. Look for it to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars and for Ben Kinglesy as Best Actor. Yes, it's that time of the year again. :) Also, this movie is doing very poorly at the box office, so if you can, go see it in the theaters.

4958545,5,B0064YON8G,"It may seem odd that a movie about the magic of cinema, in an age where cinema proved itself to be more than just a fad, the 1920s, would be made utilizing 3D, a gimmick that seems to be all the rage today. This gets lampshaded by one particular scene, where the audience watches a scene where a train pulls into a station and flips out, as they think the train is coming for them. Yet, given the subject matter, it only seems inevitable that a man like Martin would think up such an idea for such a plot, anyway.

Based off the book ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"", which is a stunning mix of hand drawings and writing, and set in 1920s Paris, the film ""Hugo"" tells the story of Hugo Cabret, a young orphan who works and lives in the clock tower of a train station, which is ruled by a ruthless inspector, and is also where he has been stealing several toys for their parts to fix a broken automaton, made for the movies of Georges Mils. One day, when caught trying to steal a toy, the owner notices Hugo's notebook, which contains conceptual sketches for the automaton, and steals it, to which Hugo tries to get back.

But Hugo instead meets Uncle Georges' adoptive daughter, who helps him try to get the notebook back. But through all this, they both end up in the mystery surrounding the automaton, and movies. Isabelle hasn't seen a movie, and after a stint in a cinema, they find out that film itself is what keeps drawing them closer and closer in this spider's web... and so begins an adventure for the two where they discover themselves, the joy of movies, and the need to stick together in the face of adversity.

Wow... What a film. Honestly, I don't think I've seen a movie like this at all. I always knew you could count on Marty to blow your mind, and here he really has outdone himself. I was left speechless after the movie- honestly I don't think I've been left with that feeling in ages.

Everything about this movie is just brilliant. First, the acting is STELLAR. Asa Butterfield plays the titular character so heartbreakingly beautifully. He puts so much pain and emotion into his performance that it's as mesmerizing as it is heartbreaking. He is a great actor with the eyes too, and he really showed it here... Every melancholy expression of his had me on the verge of tears (and I'm a very manly guy!!!). Moertz... Well, we knew she was amazing when we saw her in Kick-Ass!, and she is especially brilliant here. Cohen is his usual funny self, let's face it: he was made for the comic roles. He does brilliantly here. But best of all is Kingsley... Oh man. Word to all directors ever: if you don't want your audience reduced to sobbing messes, never have Ben Kingsley play a broken old man, ever. We all know he's an amazing actor. But here, he gives his most devastatingly beautiful performance ever. I cried in a few places, he is that phenomenal.

The plot? Well, you knew already it's great. But my synopsis does not do it justice, believe me. Absolutely beautifully done.

The cinematography is perfect, and the 3D is amazing. This is the best 3D I've seen in any movie, ever. It helps tell the story, for once- it helps a movie about the magic of filmmaking, that should say something. This must be seen in a 3D cinema, I mean that. Every single detail is exposed, there's several moments where its like you're looking through a window. I think Scorsese made a wise choice to shoot in 1:85.1, too. That helped give the movie the old timey feel it aimed for. I will definitely add this film to my Blu ray collection, even if it's just to show off my HD equipment for family members visiting in the future.

And another thing- the feel of the movie is perfect. This is a film made for us who go to a movie to immerse ourselves in it. To escape from reality and indulge in this world being brought forth to us. Not since TRON: Legacy have we gotten a film as magical as that, and I did not want this movie to end at all.

In short, do not miss this film. If you're tired of brainless blockbusters and dialogue driven movies that turn them into videotaped plays, and want a film that sums up why we go to the cinema, see this movie. You will regret having missed it, if you don't, and that I guarantee.

Bravo, Scorsese. You have re-proved yourself as a favourite filmmaker of mine.

4958546,3,B0064YON8G,"""Hugo"" is a delightful, big and slow moving film that manages to be interesting to watch, although very little happens through much of it.  Sort of like watching the workings of a fine watch.  Like too many modern films, it's about 30 minutes too long;  gives too much to special effects over good story telling; and is hampered by inconsistent performances by its child actors, although the secondary characters somewhat make up for it with their performances, and the little stories they bring to life in the margins.

The film is as much about the orphan boy Hugo, who lives within the walls of Paris' Montparnasse station in the early 1930s, and keeps the stations clocks in time, as it is about the real life film pioneer Georges Melies, who is discovered by the boy, and Isabelle (god daughter to Melies), who becomes his confidante.  As such, the audience is given a crash course in cinema history, and then treated to a glorious recreation of Melies movie studio and its sets,  as he is shown filming scenes from some of his films.  As it turns out, Melies had a rather short career, which was brought to an abrupt end by the major US and French studios, with his films melted down to make boot heels for WWI, adding yet another absurdity to mankind's most absurd war.  He ended up selling toys in a Paris train station, which is where the film finds him, and tells his story more or less as it happened.

Sadly, the kids, upon whom the movie is built, can't quite carry the load they're given.  Most of the time you can practically hear them thinking ""What do I do now?  How long must I stand here? Should I smile?  Can I scratch?"".  The other problem is that the background is a combination of sets and CGI, that with the 3D glasses, creates a world that is so detailed that it manages to seem too real, and utterly fake.  One gets the sense of the film as an animated feature with real life characters (which contrasts with trailers for the upcoming ""Tintin"" movie, with animated characters that are almost lifelike).  I can not see why 3D was necessary, or how it aided the film, when good cinematography would have been just as convincing.  That it cost me $27.00 for two tickets did not impress me one whit.

An idiosyncrasy of the film, a throwback to the 1960's when Americans played themselves and Brits played all the foreign language roles, is that the movie is set in Paris and yet everyone in it is British, with pronounced British accents and often strictly British characters to boot.  Only Ben Kingsley looks even vaguely ""French"".  It would be interesting to see the film dubbed in French.

Still, I found the film enjoyable, fun, and romantic.  It built up a certain level of restrained suspense and maintained it throughout the film, and the scenes of Melies sets were a real treat.  I'd buy the film and I can see myself watching it over and over again, perhaps not nearly as much as other films, but it easily bears repeated viewing.",1322784000,8,2962,4.559546313799622
4958547,4,B0064YON8G,"- Isabelle: ""We could get into trouble.""
- Hugo: ""That's how you know it's an adventure.""

So if you haven't read the book - Brian Selznick's THE INVENTION OF HUGO CABRET - then maybe you should know up front that the film adaptation, HUGO, isn't straight-up fantasy fare like Harry Potter or the Chronicles of Narnia. Yep, there is a heightened sense of reality in that the panoramic cinematography and the fabulous set designs evoke a childlike sense of wonder. There is a fairy tale ambiance of sorts. HUGO is a fable concerning an intrepid orphan boy and a long neglected artist, care worn and bitter and resigned to fading into obscurity.

His pa deaders and his hard-imbibing uncle having amscrayed for parts unknown, young Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) has been living in a post World War I Parisian train station, inhabiting the walls, navigating the catwalks and catacombs and precarious steps that make up the train station's dusty inner sanctum. Hugo keeps busy by doing his uncle's work. He's been secretly tending to the clocks in the sprawling train station. In his spare time, he strives to piece together a mysterious broken-down wind-up automaton that was abandoned in a museum. Hugo believes fervently that the little metal man, when functioning properly, will reveal a message from his father. But Hugo is stumped by a missing heart-shaped key which activates the automaton. Hugo perseveres, long as there's food to filch and his father's notebook to guide him and mechanical bits to steal from the toy salesman's booth.

Hugo has an affinity for machinery, a knack for fixing gadgets. This serves him well when his luck runs out as a thief and he's nabbed by old Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley), him what runs the toy booth. The furious Papa Georges nevertheless indulges in an act of kindness; he takes on Hugo as a booth assistant. Around this time Hugo meets Papa Georges' niece Isabelle (Chlo Grace Moretz), and so we're introduced to the film's best performance in my opinion. Chlo Grace Moretz radiates a warmth and great charm. Her Isabelle is captivating and inquisitive and effortlessly rolls off literary references. I love that she savors them fanciful words, words such as ""reprobate"" and ""clandestine"" and ""covert lair"" lovingly tripping from her tongue. But Isabelle is tired of living vicariously thru books; she longs for an adventure of her own. And she embarks on one with Hugo. At one point, she's heard to remark: ""This is marvelous. I feel just like Jean Valjean."" Except that she's ever more lively than good old Prisoner #24601.

It's interesting. The first half of HUGO tracks our scampering orphan's escapades and the tone is very much adventurous. But somewhere in the middle bits, it seems as if director Martin Scorsese finally put his foot down and decided to go ahead with what really drew him to this project. Scorsese loves cinema, and somewhere you must've seen him espousing a cause near and dear to his heart: the preservation of old films. His passion for old movies and the salvaging of them fold into this picture. I won't say what, but there is a huge reveal somewhere in the middle bits, and the tone alters some and the spotlight sort of veers away from Hugo, even though Hugo is still the catalyst to everything that happens hence.

HUGO is a film for kids, but maybe not all kids. The visuals are dazzling and enthralling and whoever came up with them should be tapped for an Oscar nomination. For those who harbor love for silent pictures or are curious about the early days of cinema, the second half of HUGO is a marvel, as only an affectionate valentine by Scorsese could be. As in the source material, HUGO shines a light on a near-forgotten pioneer of cinema, a talent who once upon a time made over 500 films until the advent of the first world war and the movie audience's shifting tastes forced him to sell his films, of which celluloid were broken down to chemicals and refashioned into the heels of women's shoes. And you wonder why this old bloke is melancholy?

I've isolated Chlo Grace Moretz as my favorite performer in this film. Doesn't mean that the rest of the cast sucks asphalt. This is a terrific cast, from Butterfield to Kingsley to a fantastic Helen McCrory (who makes the most of her minimal screen time) to Christopher Lee (who lends benevolent weight as the librarian Monsieur Labisse). Even Sacha Baron Cohen restrains himself and is fine and funny as Gustave Gaston, the bum-legged Station Inspector whose mission in life - when not wooing the shy flower lady - is to corral all runaway urchins and send them packing to the orphanage. Cohen's antics and his lanky build remind me in some ways of a Keystone Kop or maybe Tony Azito who played the cowardly police sergeant in THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE. Some effective slapstick moments provided by Cohen... and that police dog.

If immortal folks like Chaplin, Keaton, and Fairbanks evoke fond memories or some recognition, then HUGO treats you very finely. Location-wise, this is as idealized a version of Paris as you and I can hope to see. The automaton is a steampunkish concoction of gears and coils and springs and thingamajigs, and, early on, is what drives the narrative, piques our curiosity. The kid actors contribute mature performances. And because this is the kind of film that delivers the goods, chances are solid that, by the closing moments, our forgotten filmmaking pioneer will take taken his bows, remembered once more. HUGO isn't fantasy in the mold of Harry Potter and such. But Scorsese introduces an enchantment of sorts, one somewhat anchored in reality. But I've always considered Scorsese magical, even when his subject matter is scurrilous mafiosos (which by the way sounds like a nasty medical condition). Scorsese again demonstrates his great craft. To lift from Hugo Cabret's vocabulary, Scorsese is like... clockwork.",1322611200,,5884,4.878
4958548,5,B0064YON8G,"MOVIE NOTE #12: HUGO Based on the book by Brian Selznick's novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret, this film was incredibly enchanting and warm hearted for me. Paramount Pictures's film Hugo, was Co-Produced by Johnny Depp and the director Martin Scorcese (the `Godfather' director himself) - this is Scorcese's first film that didn't involve, the mob, gangsters or guns - this is actually a family film with a very big heart.

Rated PG, for he subject matter - it tells the late 1930's tale of a young boy, HUGO (played convincingly by Asa Butterfield of `Nanny McPhee', `Wolfman' & the `Merlin' TV show) who loses his father and takes the place of his uncle (Played by the convincing Ray Winston of `Indiana Jones', &' Percy Jackson and the Olympians') - to do the task of keeping ALL the MANY clocks and their mechanisms working in the world famous and huge Paris railway station. His father, lovingly played by Jude Law (`Sherlock Holmes', `Aviator' & `Alfie'), finds an Automoton (Clock-work Android) that apparently has a special ability that after his fathers death, Hugo goes on his journey of discovery.

The whole time Hugo is literally mentally tortured, teased, taunted and abused by one of Academy Award Winner - Sir Ben Kingsly's (`Gandhi', `Schindler's List' & `Prince of Persia') most amazing and heartfelt performances ever. He plays film maker and innovator George Mlis, most noted for the silent film `A Trip To The Moon' - where an oversized bullet takes travelers to the moon and shoots the moon in the eye! `Hugo' although very visual in nature and making full use of the 3D process has beautiful imagery, soft warm tones and a very visual dynamic with all the clock, clock workings and cogs of the machines that tell time in Paris. Not to mention another incredible musical score by Howard Shore (`Lord of the Rings', `Phillidelphia' & `Ed Wood')

Young Hugo also has one other problem - he is continuously being chased by the railways Inspector played by the impressive comedic talents of Sarah Baron Cohen (`Sweeney Todd, `Borat' & `Madagascar') who he himself has a malfunction mechanism attached to his leg to help him walk. He and his dog (with his witty smirks) torment Hugo and then unexpectedly gets help from Georges granddaughter - Isabelle (Played by Chloe Grace Moretz of ""Kick Ass' & ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid') they find their way to know the real story behind her Grandfather and his Father's `message'.
 The film is amazingly entertaining and might be a little slow for the younger crowd - but it has amazing performances, visuals and great `not in your face' 3D effects. It's also a great period film too with many details and intricacies.

The film also has some impressive performances `sprinkled' throughout by the Bookstore owner played by Christopher Lee (`Star Wars: The Phantom Menace', `Lord of the Rings'), the Inspectors love interest played by Emily Mortimer (`Shutter Island', `Cars 2' & `The Pink Panther' 2008), a `blooming' love romance played ever so gently by Richard Griffiths and Frances de la Tour (From the Harry Potter films) and the most heartfelt and magical performance of Helen McCrory (the Harry Potter Films, `The Queen' & `Doctor Who') who plays George Mlis's sympathetic and loving wife.

 This was refreshing 2 hours and 7 minute film and although the pace is slower that your average shoot-em-up....you really feel apart of Hugo's life. I gotta read the book now!",1322524800,,3427,4.90846286701209
4958549,3,B0064YON8G,"The trailers for ""Hugo"" are hugely misleading. I expected a fantasy story about a young orphan in Paris, with floating robots and mystery trains. Instead, I got a rather pedestrian tale about the orphan with little of the fantasy. Indeed - spoilers ahead! - the film became a biography of early cinematographer Georges Mlis, he of ""Voyager to the Moon"" fame. As sad as was the life of poor orphan Hugo, forced to wind clocks in the Montparnasse train station, the story of Mlis (played by Ben Kingsley) was a much more compelling and could have been a film in itself. The Hugo material was too skimpy, making this part of the film tiresome. A couple of love stories between train station regulars might have made the film more bearable. As would a btter eye for comedy. I knew we were in trouble when an early scene, in which a character catches a leg brace in a train door, fell comedically flat. And Sacha Baron Cohen, as a brutal yet lovesick gendarme, was completely misdirected. His character was not given any motivation or his foul temper - the audience was left to imagine a war wound as the likely cause.

I will say that Scorcese did a nice job of evoking 1920s Paris fashions, signage and technology. The train station was truly a bustling place full of thousands of stories every time a train arrived or departed. The Paris scenes were mostly done as matte paintings, and lacked realism. That might or might not be your cup of tea.

""Hugo"" is a huge waste of money, except that it will bring more attention to Mlis and his enormous output of wonderful early films. The man was a creative genius and his story deserved not to be twisted with a nameless and fictional orphan. And the 3D brought nothing to the film, except a buck or two extra on the ticket price.

I told you I was disappointed.",1322352000,10,1805,4.513761467889908
4958550,4,B0064YON8G,"Martin Scorsese's beautiful film based on Brian Selznic's ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"" (screenplay by Josh Logan) is full of gears and timepieces both large and small.  It's riddled with a rich, porous, dream-like fabric that in the end is a celebration of the birth of cinema itself.

The story, set in 1930s Paris, is about Hugo, a fatherless boy whose drunken uncle brings him to the train station and teaches him how to run the giant clocks.  The kid is a natural, having learned the mechanics of maintenance and repair from his father.  So when his uncle disappears, Hugo keeps the clocks running.  Always on the run from a station inspector who collects strays and sends them to an orphanage, Hugo eventually becomes involved with an elderly toy merchant and discovers a secret about the man, birth of cinema as an art form and why movies are dreams made real (or at least reel).

The 3-D, which I usually hate, is magnificent and most appropriate here.  It greatly enhances the film's extraordinary, multi-layered, dreamy patina from start to finish. And make no mistake, the 2-D version is more than fine.  Steam Punk fans will also find a vibe to enjoy in this sometimes slow, uneven, but heartfelt and beautiful celebration of why movies matter.  And to what level the artistry aspires.",1322352000,3,1298,4.8108108108108105
4958551,3,B0064YON8G,"I recommend you see the film before reading the book.

All I can say is that those who are raving must not have read the book. The book is big in size and scope, but is basically a novella.  It is heartrending and poignant.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Invention-of-Hugo-Cabret/dp/0439813786/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Invention of Hugo Cabret</a>&nbsp;is wonder-full and imaginative - it is unique in the way it communicates its story through words, drawings and pictures.

Once again Scorsese has overproduced his material and seems much more concerned with ""the look"" of the film than the content.  Too much of the ""heart"" is gone, the story of the boy and the old man has been cut short, the relationship of the boy and girl has been altered as well as her personality, and important characters like Etienne are missing while others have been expanded in nonsensical ways (the train station inspector is played for slapstick, Blake Edwards style laughs - that are more annoying than funny); and why do all the actors in the film (which is set in Paris, France) have British accents?

The look of the film is impressive...but why change the story and characters?",1322352000,22,1219,5.361256544502618
4958552,4,B0064YON8G,"In this wonderfully inventive film, director Martin Scorsese incorporates two different genres into one great story.  The first half of the film deals with a young boy who is orphaned and adopted by his drunken Uncle Claude (Ray Winstone).  Claude is responsible for keeping all of the clocks wound and in proper working order at a huge Paris train station.  Young Hugo (Asa Butterfield) learns how to do this and after his uncle disappears, manages to keep the clocks working.  He lives where he works deep in the belly of the station.  The only thing Hugo has from his father (Jude Law in flashbacks) is a robotic like machine called an automatron.  Since the inner workings of the machine function much like a windup clock, Hugo is constantly trying to get it to function again.  This requires guile, skill and stealing parts.  One of Hugo's victims is the owner of a trinket shop.  This grouchy old man named George is played by Ben Kingsley.  George and his wife however are the Godparents of another young orphan named Isabelle (Chloe Moretz).  She and Hugo create a bond and get into mischief and eventually detective work.  Both are enamored by magic and George was once a great magician as it turns out.  This set up segues to another creative style in which we discover that George is actually famed movie pioneer George Melies.

Scorsese is one of the great film historians in addition to being an iconic director and puts in much time and effort into presenting Melies contribution to film.  He was instrumental in giving the new medium a sense of illusion.  Magic and trickery?  Of course.  Movies and magic.  Melies grumpiness is mostly attributed to his departure from the industry after WW I.  The reason is unclear, although the public's lack of interest as suggested seems overstated.  Hugo sets out to bring George the attention he deserves, if many years later.  He enlists the help of a film expert who knows Melies' work but believed he had died years earlier.  The ending is sweet and predictable but also a perfect conclusion to a magical film.  I saw this film in 3-D which was some of the best work this ""trickery"" has to offer.  A perfect partnership.

The Blu ray version of this film is equal to the quality or the original.  The 1080p transfer is shown with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio and frankly leaves nothing to be desired.  The film is enjoyable and full of visual treats.  This is reference quality as it the remarkable DTS-HD MA 7.1 soundstage.  This entire disc is demo quality, so keep it handy to show your friends.",1322265600,7,2549,4.688487584650113
