8448292,5,B004YHBB0I,"This is a superb series on the organ.  It, in a very compact manner, demonstrates the history of the instrument from its Mediterrean origins (Ctesibius, 3rd. C. BC) through the organ's evolutionary path in Europe (where it flourished). Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the Low Countries are represented as major centers of organbuilding. The organ is well represented with playing examples by the greatest organists and scholars of the era in which the series was made (1997). Suitable for all (3.5 hrs. total on 4 DVDs).",1404259200,,523,5.0813953488372094
8448293,3,B004YHBB0I,I bought this for my partner.  And he says the first 2 disks are all about the history. And the rest are nothing but people playing different types of organs.  Only enjoyed the first 2.  If they van just divide the set up they may do better,1361577600,2,240,4.0638297872340425
8448294,3,B004YHBB0I,"I must say I was so excited to receive the Dvd's ""History of the Organ"" How disappointed I am now that I've seen them. There's not much displayed as far as history goes. Most of the 221 minutes is of film of various organist performing pieces from the organ literature on historic instruments. A treatise on Organ History this does not make. If you are really looking to learn about the history of Pipe Organs I guess it's only to be found in books. There are some great ones! If you just want to watch film of people playing historic instruments, this is for you. On a positive note, the filming is professional and the audio as well. I expected more.",1352764800,3,652,4.396694214876033
