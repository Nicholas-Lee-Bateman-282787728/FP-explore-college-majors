Its realistic, if there was an invasion. It has a Great cast! Im only sorry there is and will be only 10 episodes, that is not nearly ebnough for the Best Tv show on TV!!!! Triple that TNT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Give us 20-30 episodes per season. Thankyou for making my Sundays!",1312070400,11,423,4.578947368421052
4402374,4,B004LROMWU,"Falling Skies is a fiction television series. For TNT. The first season has 10 episodes. The show  tells the story of the aftermath of an alien invasion. The show follows Tom  a Boston University history professor, who is one of the leaders of the 2nd Mass, a group of survivors fighting against the aliens. Tom, is  in search of his missing son, as well as put his extensive knowledge of military history into practice to help resistance fighters and protect survivors. Most  of the human race has been distroyed,  Tom and his other  two  sons, Hal and Matt are with him and wants to find their missing brother as well. Tom and the other soliders must learn to survive  the alien and whatever else they encounter on the way.

Not a bad show so far for me. I'm up to  the 3rd episode and found the show to be to my liking. I thing sci fi shows are better watched on cable as they tend to do better there in most cases. Great cast and visual, surely since it's cable I wanted to see what the special effects would look like and it isn't bad, I can tolerate it. I look forward to more episodes and hope it won't be cancel soon. I'm glad to see Noah Wyle back on tv. I think TNT treats him well I saw both his librarian movies.",1310601600,36,1224,4.214592274678112

4402437,5,B004LROMWU,"If you're looking for your alien invasion apocalypse fix, this is it. Season 1 and 2 were all kinds of fun, complete with people on horseback fighting aliens with shotguns, being vaporized by lasers, mind control, spaceship abductions, explosions, all the good stuff. I was hooked and watched it to the end, but was less impressed with each season as the plot got more and more ridiculous.",1513209600,,389,4.82089552238806
4402438,4,B004LROMWU,"It's an ok series. I was halfway through season 1 and now it's changed to a purchase only. I won't be purchasing it. I pay enough for the prime membership as it is, shouldn't have to pay for second rate shows on top of it.",1512604800,2,222,3.9555555555555557
4402439,5,B004LROMWU,I was watching this series and then they de idea to take it off of the prime list. I am left in the middle of the series and now not able to finish unless I pay for. I am not willing to suy each season for $15 each when there is 5 seasons.,1512518400,3,239,3.5283018867924527
4402440,5,B004LROMWU,Huge fan of falling skies. This was a great purchase and I have 0 problems with it. I also love that it came with a Vudu code so I can have the disc and have the electronic version. I would recommend to anyone that likes falling skies.,1512172800,,235,4.0212765957446805
4402441,1,B004LROMWU,"Bait-and-switch? Eight episodes  (Season 1) into a ""free"" Amazon Prime show and suddenly we--AmzPrime members--are whacked with a per-episode fee of #2.99?
WTF?",1512172800,2,160,5.956521739130435
4402442,3,B004LROMWU,"Decent show, worth the Prime fee, but not the per-episode. Would be nice to have some warning about which free shows are going to be taken off the list. Bad management snatching stuff from us by surprise. Happily, the show is at the library, and our Prime is up for renewal in March. Will be looking hard at worth, especially since this is the third show we've lost free access to that is available on Hulu. Just saying.",1512086400,,420,4.397435897435898

4402444,2,B004LROMWU,I was actually getting into it even with the bad writing. I'm halfway through season 4 . Went to start next episode and was informed it would be 2.99 per episode.  Lol. Nice try Amazon.  Guess my prime membership will be cancelled,1511913600,3,230,4.4523809523809526
4402475,4,B004LROMWU,"Show's good...there were a few ""um what the hell"" episodes though that in first run probably cost them some viewers.  Seems it's getting better as the show progresses.

But come on Amazon really?  It was Prime like 3 days ago.  Guess I won't be finishing this one.",1511913600,,264,4.553191489361702
4402476,4,B004LROMWU,"I liked the show, but some writing was just difficult to get through. Pretty much guaranteed in every episode:

1) 10 minutes of action
2) 10 minutes of soap opera level drama
3) 10 minutes of sentimentality/hugging (literally every episode ends with some sort of hug and soft piano soundtrack)
4) 10 minutes of someone reassuring someone else that everything is going to be okay (and it ends up being--you guessed it--okay.)

Point 1 about makes the show fun, but point 2, 3, and 4 can be excruciatingly dull. I literally cried in season 4 because of the drama, character inconsistencies, and exaggerated themes.",1511222400,,613,4.884615384615385
4402477,1,B004LROMWU,The series was amazing until season 5. It leaves you empty and lost.,1510790400,,68,4.3076923076923075
4402478,2,B004LROMWU,I tried to get into this very s l o w moving series. I went up to episode 4 and was constantly fast forwarding because of the glacial movement of the cinematography... Then I noticed that it was to be removed from Amazon soon so...adios and good riddance. No problem. Never was hooked to begin with.,1510099200,,299,4.357142857142857
4402479,1,B004LROMWU,It's just another cookie cutter post apocalyptic show. Nothing special about the characters. The plot is extremely thin and full of contrivances to drive the story forward. It's all extremely generic. Not worth the time with all the other options out there.,1509753600,,257,5.142857142857143
4402480,4,B004LROMWU,"It's hard to find good sci-fi! As a fan of the genre, I really enjoyed this series. As others have noted, it's a little slow the first season but that's because it's setting up what is ultimately its strength - this series is deeply invested in the personal relationships of the main characters, and less in the weapons, battles, CGI and aliens. The sustained focus and exploration of human connections, growth, strength, friendship and trust in the face of constant uncertainty, challenge and imminent disaster is what makes this series compelling.

I did not give Falling Skies 5 stars because, like many compelling TV series of any genre, in seasons 4 & 5 it succumbed more and more to ""desperate writer plot syndrome"". The main plot lines were mostly played out, so the plot twists became more and more ridiculous. Sci-fi fans always suspend disbelief to some degree, but truly good sci-fi always dances at the edge of ""yeah, this could really happen"". This series strayed pretty far from that path into situations that were laughable then conveniently resolved, tied up with a bow that just appeared out of nowhere time and time again (the moon...?)

All in all, an absorbing and compelling series and well worth your binge time. Just be ready to plunge off the cliff of disbelief in the last couple of seasons - but again, how many really good series have you watched where all of a sudden the plot lines turn crazy after a few good seasons? Happens all the time. Happy watching, sci-fi fans! :)",1508544000,,1501,4.747126436781609

4402482,5,B004LROMWU,Addicting,1507334400,,9,9.0
4402483,3,B004LROMWU,"Okay start to the show. Goes downhill in later seasons as the charcters go from one ""I was possessed by aliens"" moment to another and lapses into total illogic (if the aliens can do that, then why don't they just do this much simpler and easier thing?). It feels as though the writers sketched out their outline, filmed season 1, got a renewal, and then changed the ending because the original wasn't contrived enough. The alien's motivation for attacking Earth is obscured until later in the series, and it could have been resolved with a simple, ""Why didn't you just ask for help?"" Most of the characters are just whiny, selfish brats who, in the face of extinction, fight with each other like a horde of rabid racoons in a barrel.",1507248000,,733,4.603053435114504

4402529,5,B004LROMWU,At first I was put off by the cheesy graphics and stopped watching the first episode less than halfway thru. I returned and gave it a second chance to learn that it actually had a pretty good story line and the graphics got better. I was soon addicted and watched all 5 seasons in a couple of weeks. Highly recommended if you are into shows such as Game of Thrones or Walking Dead.,1503532800,,381,4.232876712328767

4402532,2,B004LROMWU,"This show falls in the television equivalent of the ""uncanny valley"" - half-way between realism and fantasy, that achieves the allure of neither while realizing the flaws of both. If Falling Skies were more fantastical, say like Star Trek (pick your series or movie), I could suspend disbelieve and enjoy the magic of imagined futuristic technologies, however improbable they may be. On the other end of the spectrum, consider something like Gravity; I was willing to overlook the occasional stretch because it included such a uniquely-high dose of realism, forcing the characters to grapple with practical problems that other sci fi stories sweep under the rug.

Unfortunately, Falling Skies feels to me more like Jericho - a good premise with lots of potential, but too much perfect hair and convenient stashes of pre-apocalyptic supplies to distract me from the show's legitimate attempts to depict the hardships of life after an alien invasion. Stated another way, Falling Skies spends a lot of time - to their credit - trying to show what life might be like in the world they've created, yet repeatedly undermines those efforts by introducing new technology, incredible feats, and absurd coincidences on a continual basis. It's too real to be escapist, and too fanciful to be dramatic.

The above notwithstanding, I'm 2 episodes away from finishing the series. So, there's obviously something in Falling Skies that has kept me watching, lo these many hours. (That ""something"" is most likely the fact that my family was away on vacation for two weeks, and this show provided a suitable backdrop to reading the news on my phone while winding down at night; otherwise, I probably wouldn't have put in the time.) Based on the high star rating, I was expecting another Battlestar Galactica, Firefly, or even The Expanse. Sadly, Falling Skies misses that delicate and elusive balance of sci fi magic and human drama that compels me to watch the show on its merits. If you're looking to kill some time, and can tolerate a haphazard, cliche-ridden, shark-jumping plot, though, you could do worse.",1501113600,,2093,5.063768115942029

4402534,2,B004LROMWU,"no. it just keeps getting worse and worse. I'm on season 2, and every scene now has me going, ""what? Why would they do that? Who wrote this?"" It's just sloppy logic that is killing what could be a fun show. Why does the kid need to swim across when there's only a hole in the bridge? Why does a character do one thing to advance the plot, then do the total opposite in the next scene? It just left me wanting to, then actually, turning it off.",1498953600,,443,4.045454545454546
4402565,1,B004LROMWU,"Horrible show. Guess if I was a 15, I'd think Falling Skies was cool. Maybe that's where all the 5 star reviews are coming from. Been watching indie sci-fi lately, since cable TV sci-fi has been pure sh*t of late.",1498780800,,213,4.35
4402566,2,B004LROMWU,"Really dumb.  When watching the first episode I thought this was satire.  A goof on sci-fi movies where the aliens were, as always, part amphibian and part insect.  The dialogue was riddled with ""Atta boys, That's my son, It's a suicide mission, and This is the end of mankind.""  End of mankind - I could only hope.  Juvenile dialogue delivered by bad actors.  Yes, the black guy gets killed in the third scene, the hillbilly becomes a general, the Asian chick is a techie....
I skipped to the last episode where the hero kills the Queen Bee and all her killing subjects explode themselves in the sky.  By that time I was rooting for the Queen Bee.",1497744000,,648,4.487179487179487

4402808,5,B004LROMWU,"I have really enjoyed watching Falling Skies on my Fire TV. The story is great, even though it's pretty much just another alien invasion show. This one's a bit different though, traking place far after the invasion has commenced, and is during the time where people are trying to survive and resist the aliens. Falling Skies is one of those shows that have a LOT of characters that live within a large group of people, so it's pretty hard to tell who exactly which ones are the main characters and what their names are, but they eventually become prominently known as the episodes go by. Another awesome thing about this show is that there are no inappropriate scenes like other shows have, which is good. I have really enjoyed this show, and if you like sci-fi shows that involve alien invasions, you probably will too. Thanks, and I hope I could help!",1485129600,2,853,4.618421052631579

4402964,2,B004LROMWU,"A friend recommended this, so we watched it. The plot is thin, the characters thin, and the story holes you could drive a truck through. Since it has made it 5 seasons, we continued watching and are midway in Season 2 now.
The thing I don't understand is they break the golden rule of sci-fi. You have to make it at least plausible or it's unbelievable and doesn't sit well. This happens over and over in this show. In one show they tell you the aliens sense heat and have sensitive hearing but the characters ride around on old dirtbikes and drive old cars. Not to mention they hide out in a school with 1,000 people and there are candles burning in piles everywhere and trash can fires outside. The body heat alone would show up to an inferred scanner in a world without electricity of any kind. The aliens do regular fly overs.... One episode they kill a Skidder with nothing but a shotgun and a knife, the next it takes hundreds of rounds of ammo, Which they never seem to run out of, despite no one making more. Then the human 'bad guy' has the bright idea to use Mech metal to make bullets that will kill them easier. He sets up an assembly line and makes them. One of the bullets, in the demonstration, is enough to take down one Mech yet when the Mechs arrive,20 people open fire, all with Mech bullets and use all but a few of their new ammo. Then the 'bad guy' leaves and there is no further indication of ammo production. They then find a hospital and are able to get a generator running, with all the lights blaring away in the night. Like aliens wouldn't see that? Every single episode there is something that makes you sit back and go ""wait, what?"" And not in a good way.
Still, a lot of great shows had awful first seasons. So we are in season 2 now and still waiting for it to improve.",1484006400,,1801,4.269005847953216

Visually the devastated world after an alien invasion and war is wonderfully created and convincing, the acting is very good in general, and the writing first-rate. The humans have degrees of complexity, and their personal involvements and problems are convincing psychologically. They are also a welcome rest from the intense action.

4403252,3,B004LROMWU,"Great storyline with realistic CGI and, for the most part, decent acting. But expect a totally humorless presentation with plenty of clichs exchanged back and forth. As is common with Hollywood productions, undue attention is placed on style--leather jackets and jeans are de rigeur, and the motorcycles have to be Harleys. While violence reigns, humans take regular-10 minute breaks to embrace and hug each other. The whole structure and tone of relations, however, is based on the militaristic model, with orders being shouted on a regular basis. Overall, it is an enjoyable and innovative series, but well within the Hollywood parameters which refrain from anything too intellectually demanding. 3 1/2 stars",1481846400,,710,5.405405405405405

Stephen Hawkins has warned that they most likely would not be loving, ""enlightened"" beings that come in peace, but that rather come to conquer and rule.  The way that family comes together, but also how dissent is spread among survivors is also realistic.  Catastrophe brings out the best and worst in us.",1481500800,,473,4.875

I don't know if I got if free as a Prime member or if I purchased the series but now it's saying I have to pay to watch. The show debuted in 2011 and as a Prime member I now have to pay? What good does Prime do if we can't watch anything that's decent without having to pay extra $$$ on top of the already high annual fee? And why did they change it?

I should have quit in season 2, honestly. Many many scenes are poorly edited and drag on with no resounding addition to th storyline. Thank the gods for the +10 button on Amazon so I can rapid fire my way thru them. Also, the unreasonable adherence to family over all other considerations by the hero and his family, while noble, in a time of war on this magnitude would not be tolerated by the following legions. At some point there would be a splintering or a coup. For instance, at one point as the heroine is leading a group of resistance fighters they come across a cattle truck of 50 children. The group decides to track down where the children of so very many families are being taken. A few scenes later the heroine tells everyone they are abandoning all those children because she senses her child is off in another direction...

I loved the 2nd Mass travelling and getting to know each other as you got to know them.  You feel drawn to certain characters and appreciate the fight for them.  I loved the whole harnessed kids storyline(s). Was definitely a favorite of mine.  The interaction by the Mason brothers especially the two older ones really and truly feels like family.  Enjoyed how the 2nd Mass set up camp, the stories about how and what they were doing when the skitters came.  Just loved almost everything about it (except Maggie).",1480550400,,656,4.470588235294118

4403412,5,B004LROMWU,The series picks up speed quickly and kept me enthralled more than most series. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys alien style sci-fi.,1479168000,,137,4.75
4403413,4,B004LROMWU,watched with family--loved the Massachusetts city names peppered throughout--good action and okay for younger children if they can tolerate alien-type images.,1479168000,,158,6.571428571428571

4403417,5,B004LROMWU,"Hooked! A great drama. I was concerned it would start to focus too much on person-on-person violence (like The Walking Dead did), but it's balanced. Love it - a great Apocalypse drama!",1479168000,,184,4.78125
4403418,1,B004LROMWU,"Woah!
I can't believe the writing on this. Just arrf-ull, bow-wow.

4403445,1,B004LROMWU,Replete with disgustingly sappy scenes melodromatic music that takes the enjoyment out of an otherwise promising scifi. Exceptional macho-centric stereotypes.

4403461,3,B004LROMWU,Interesting but very exaggerated.  Motorcycles and guns don't beat aliens with space ships and Robots with arms that are massive machine guns. not to mention mind control of children who get other kids to spill the beans on where the resistance is located.

4403469,4,B004LROMWU,"While I have enjoyed this series, it is heavy on the interpersonal relationships compared to the action. Let's face it, we want to see more action in series similar to this. There are lots of opportunities for the characters to ""wax"" philosophical about the life in general, and life under an alien invasion in particular. You will probably want to see the second season after watching this first.",1477958400,,397,4.852941176470588

4403471,4,B004LROMWU,"Not bad as scifi goes these days. But it reminds me that a show is only as good as the writing. The plot kind of lumbers and drags  intertwined with a fight with the aliens. Staying in one place until the aliens arrive to enslave or kill everyone makes for a suspenseful experience, but doesn't make a lot of sense as a practical approach to staying alive. There are other plot lines that could have been better thought out. But, hey, I'm still watching it hoping things get better in the writing and the aliens just get bored, give up and go home.",1477958400,,548,4.320388349514563

4403487,5,B004LROMWU,"This is a great show, I remember watching it on T.V. when it first came out but have forgot about it until I seen it here on Amazon.  I think this movie is one of the best made for television programs as far as graphics, the aliens in this program have some amazing details to them.  Their ships are great looking as well, there was a lot of thought put into making this television series.  It was really cool the way they added in the mind control on the kids with the harnesses, it would make more sense to be able to control their minds with a parasite then any other form.  The bug from the eye part was awesome too, all in all it is a superb T.V. show in my opinion.

  I also think they did a great job with choosing the cast of this series, granted there is some parts where the acting isn't top notch but they still do a great job considering.  The world being destroyed is another great visual aid to this series, some great work all around when it comes to this show.

4403525,4,B004LROMWU,"A very slow first season as characters develop made it difficult for me to get through and without Stephen Spielbergs name I never would have. I hadn't seen any of the characters in anything except Noah Wylie.
The characters evolved, and the writing improved, and I'd seen where it had been filmed for at least 5 seasons, and by season 3 I knew why, Noah Wylie had taken a more active role in making the series and I could see right from the first episode the way the storyline and action picked way up and it became much more exciting and suspenseful, and I started caring about the characters.
The aliens were ruthless and spider like, creepy with a little resemblance to monster in Aliens.
The plot becomes very involved and very interesting, lots of violence but a real caring among most of the survivors as they work together in what seems to be an unwinnable war.
Great work on special effects as could be seen when the budget must have picked up by season 3.
Mr. Spielberg Noah Wylie the writers and the cast came together very very well.
If you start watching this continue into the 3rd season you will be very happy you did, one of the best series of its kind ever made.
Highly recommended Season one and two may be only a 4 but a strong five from then on.",1477094400,,1265,4.3872340425531915

4403536,3,B004LROMWU,"I watched 5 shows.  Star Gate smokes this show.  Everybody is so stupid and nobody does anything that is logical. Leave the dangerous alien with no soldiers around it.  Oh and leave the kid next to the alien.  Try to communicate and when you finally figure it out, terminate the communication.  Where are the dogs for protection?  The attitude is more like a summer camp than the end of the world.  Nobody seems to be upset about the death all around them.  I eventually did not care who died as they screwed up every mission.

The Darwin award in this show occurs when harnessed kids with automatics show up at the cycle shop and they stand in the door way watching.  Wow are kidding me.  The aliens did look cool so I give the show three stars.  I am curious how they taste but I can't watch anymore.",1476748800,2,802,4.344594594594595

4403539,4,B004LROMWU,Carried by the story mostly so my 4 stars are probably personal ones. Noah Wyle And the rest of the principals including Will Patton are competent if uninspired. Young Connor Jessup who plays Wyle's middle son rescued from the invaders seems to me the most invested in his role with Colin Cunningham as the renegade John Pope also quite good. There are many times when I want to punch him out which I take as a good sign. I've easily been kept interested through the first two seasons which I also take as a good sign.,1476748800,,518,4.40625

The storyline should be exciting. But it's not. The pacing is somehow radically off...the show is sloooowwwww. It lacks drama. The surviving humans are weirdly calm and relaxed (except when the actors--I use that term generously here--are emoting amateurishly to advance a silly plot point). The characters are as richly developed, as three dimensional, as Flat Stanley. That is to say, not at all. They are entirely uninteresting. I _want_ them to get killed by the aliens. All of them.

After the first season could not wait to get started with the second season which is where I'm at now.

If you are looking at this title and it does not call you attention at first please give it a chance and it will grow on you and remember that for every alien type of movie out there, there might be something live for and hope for and that is what keeps that people in this show going forward.",1475712000,,619,4.15

4403603,4,B004LROMWU,So far it has started off a little slow. It is starting to grow on me. Will see how it goes as the actors get comfortable and start working better with each other and become more relaxed. They seem a little stiff thru the first 5 episode. story line is OK but the writing specifically when the Aliens and how humanity deals with them needs a touch more reality. Too many mistakes cautious people would not be making like the doctors methodology when dealing with the one they captured. Also civilians would all be in the all for me horde mode not the touchy feely get along nicely way they are portrayed.

Most of Boston proper who've lived there for 10 years or so or more call it ""Southie"", but about a quarter of Boston residents are college/univ. students who have Not lived there 4 years--most are out of state and call it South Boston.

4403732,1,B004LROMWU,"I can't believe the high ratings for this show. I initially voted it at 2 stars, but I firmly believe it needs to have its ratings lowered by any means necessary. The acting, while not terrible all the time, shows people making the stupidest decisions imaginable seemingly without taking any previous experience into consideration. The 2nd episode, this supposedly semi-tough, streetwise kid actually goes to try and recover his dog Nemo from one of the seemingly-invincible-to-small-arms-fire mechs during a planned warehouse raid. It's like they had never done it before, the kid just jumps right out and essentially says ""Hey how's it going? I'll take some of those anti-personnel rounds right here!"" like a total moron. Very poorly written, VERY poorly written. I'm sorry but after the questionable choices and highly predictable action from the 1st and 2nd episodes, I can bring myself to watch no more.",1474329600,5,908,5.183673469387755

4403737,4,B004LROMWU,"Its good, its not amazing or ground-breaking, but if you like the subject matter (heavy sci fi with aliens) then this is down your alley. It has a walking dead feel where its about community surviving together, except the threat of the monsters (in this case aliens) far outweight the threat of people (there is barely any fights between survivors, which is good, you don't want to cross the line TWD and have a sci fi copy).

There are a lot of corny moments, and it can be very predictable. Some of the characters should have been fleshed out better, its mostly focused on the Mason family. The farther you get into the series the more you notice they are branching out too much with the story. But again, if you are a huge sci fi geek you will eat it all up.

4403887,3,B004LROMWU,"So I have mixed feelings about this show. First off - the overarching plot is pretty good and compelling - aliens invading is always fun and it is nice to watch something about the world falling apart that isn't zombies. Characters were decent and progressed a bit although they were absolutely banal cut-outs.  Especially Noah Wyle.  He's really off-the-shelf stock for network tv.  The show-runners could have imported his character from ER and had the exact same show.
Most frustratingly the production values and special effects absolutely scream ""network tv"" for most of this season.  The hulking alien robots made me laugh out loud they were so poorly/cheaply rendered and often critical action takes place off screen - plainly for budgetary reasons especially in the last couple episodes.  A high school stage is obviously reused a few times although the action was supposed to take place miles apart. A better budget and more compelling effects and climaxes I think would have really helped here.
That said, I do think this is a fun show and I did find myself enjoying it and I plan on watching season 2 - so I think that if you like serialized sci-fi and can forgive schlock effects - give this show a shot.  If not, move on.",1472860800,,1234,4.769953051643192

4403928,3,B004LROMWU,I've watched five episodes.  The show has an okay fundamental plot so far: some interesting concepts for an alien-invasion type story.  But there is a lot of awkward writing and acting.  There are cringe moments in every episode when I wonder how things passed the editor.  The overall decent production values compensate for these problems a bit.  So far it is 2.5 stars rounded up for me.  Lets see how it goes.,1472774400,,413,4.666666666666667

4403999,2,B004LROMWU,"Most of the problems encountered by the survivors are results of making really blatant mistakes. ""Hey let not assign anyone to guard this alien prisoner"" Gee, he kills someone, oh wow I'm so surprised.

Even by today's technology, 90% of the decisions made by this resistance would be laughably stupid and end in failure. If we were to assume these jokers were pitted against the US military, the ""resistance"" would be decimated in a weeks. But wait, somehow a race of aliens with technology 1,000 years more advanced can't do what the US military does today. Aliens don't even have basic thermal imaging!

This is science fiction and the writers have a virtually unlimited choice of new or imagined technologies to play with. Instead they are lazy and  depict a band of survivors that could not even survive against today's known technology. Gee, maybe the resistance could of stolen a stealth cloak from the aliens. Is it really so hard to incorporate the survivors using salvage alien technology to survive?

4404012,3,B004LROMWU,"The Earth has been attacked yet again by an alien aggressor, this time with more success than usual. Tom Mason (Noah Whyle) is a father of three boys who is taking a prominent role in the resistance. Reflecting the US War of Independence, the resistance is organized into regiments (of a sort) based on their Colonial forebears. These try to protect the other survivors and fight back where they can. The idea of associating a future conflict with that of the past is an interesting device. Mason, as pre-invasion history teacher, gets to make informed decisions from time to time.

The first thing to be said, is this is not being done on the cheap. There are many characters. Obviously, in this genre some exit for good but others come in too. The aliens in this case look a bit like large spiders, though they have mechanized support (a bit like in robo-cop). More is learned as the season progresses and there are some very intriguing developments. It is good to see such thought put into this element.

It seems to me that the show has been created with the family audience in mind. It has a similar tone to 2011s Terra Nova which explored pre-historic Earth through the experiences of a family. Here, Mason and his sons are the focus. There is no bad language or sex and the violence is not too graphic. It is, for a non-American, a little confronting to see so many guns being carried about but they're pretty necessary here it has to be said. The characters are mostly fine (a mid-season addition is a stand-out), if a bit stereotypical and prone to strange decisions to create drama. An enjoyable enough show which has some promise, providing you don't want it to be too edgy. 3 1/2 stars",1470787200,,1697,4.578947368421052

4404145,4,B004LROMWU,There is an alien invasion (which we do not see but happens before the action begins).  This first season is about humans trying to find a life and survive after such an attack.

Very unique storyline especially with the harnessed children and the don't know who to trust. I hate shows that piggyback other shows and form a tangent line off of the main line.

4404152,3,B004LROMWU,"Written at a grade 9 level, Falling Skies looks at life after a hostile alien invasion - mostly through the eyes of a rag tag group of survivors who call themselves the 2nd Mass(achusetts). They've spent at least a few bucks on special effects so the aliens are mostly believable. Main characters run around looking for fuel, food, other survivors, love and a reason to keep going another day. This is okay for the first 5 episodes but after that it starts to get tedious. The characters become stereotypical and the dialogue becomes predictable and the forward momentum all but stops sometimes. It's not Mad Men or House of Cards but it's a comfortable way to blow an hour or two before bed.",1468627200,,692,4.634146341463414

It does have that sci-fy channel makeup, so expect some subpar acting and somewhat predictable plotting.  I gave 4 stars because it does have some good storytelling and it is an exciting show. (I have to remember that this first season came out back in 2011, and I have since become numb to the ""world-ending-survivor, battle for existence"" type of story)  I really like the family dynamic being played out and there are some interesting twists getting thrown in the mix.  While I wasn't staying up all night to watch, I am interested to see how season 2 plays out.  A solid 4 stars.",1468627200,,753,4.62406015037594

If you took out all of the long meaningful stares between relatives and lovers, and erased all of the I'm your combat buddy therefore I'm your friend speeches. You would have about 2 hours of fairly decent science fiction. Instead what we have is 3 or 4 hours of original storyline that is repeated over and over and over.

It is a low budget TV series, but they made the most out of it.  The story, albeit a little slow, is very interesting.  It revolves around a group of survivors and their families while struggling against a very powerful invading force.

I clicked on it hoping it'd be something amazing, and genuinely expected it to be so, after watching a few other scifi shows here and seeing the reviews. The beginning makes no sense. They just dump you straight into the thick of things with very little explanation and you're expected to follow along without complaint or a problem. You don't know the characters yet you're already supposed to empathize with them. It's both fast, in the sense that it's already moving when you hit 'play' and incredibly slow, in the sense that you have no idea what's happening, why it's happening, who these people are, or why you should bother caring. I made it through a few episodes and couldn't handle it anymore.

4404226,5,B004LROMWU,"This is an excellent series. A group of humans fight against aliens who seem to have taken over the earth. At first it is pure survival to run, hide and fight against what seems to be superior forces. Good characters are developed as they move along in the series. Noah does a credible job as do his sons. I must admit it is scary at times but love to see how resourceful they are as they fight to survive. I've been binge watching the series and can tell you it is well worth watching. It is interesting to see the characters evolve so the writers did a good job. It's syfi but also its been fun to watch as the humans interact.

It pauses playback every 2 minutes to buffer for 10 seconds.  It is absolutely infuriating.  Netflix runs completely smooth and flawless with just a short buffering period when you first load a show.  I reset my modem, and my brand new top of the line router, thinking something there was causing the problem, but I couldn't make it go away.  A few seconds online told me I'm not the only one to have issues.  AMAZON NEEDS TO FIX THEIR STREAMING SERVICE.  I'm going to try again later on a computer and see if it's any better, but PS3 via wireless is my normal playback method, and it was VERY disappointing.",1467504000,,735,4.432835820895522

4404244,5,B004LROMWU,"I really like this show, for the same reasons I like the Star Trek franchises. As someone else pointed out, this show is as much about the relationships as the sci-fi. Only, this one is kinda reverse of the ST's: Instead of the humans having the upper tech, and often coming to the rescue of others, we are the persecuted, with aliens having the upper tech. This show offers a unique perspective on how relationships are affected within the underdog group, made up of ordinary people who all have their flaws and failures. I would recommend this to anyone who values a good mix of sci-fi, action, drama and plot twists. As others also have said, the first episodes are a bit slow getting things started (as with most great series) but trust me, it kicks into high gear eventually.",1466985600,2,780,4.578571428571428

Well handled, and while I am not a huge Noah Wyle fan, he does a good job and is joined by a range of solid character actors (notably, this continues and gains strength in season 2, with quite a number of actors that are generally know to TV fans, especially science fiction and fantasy fans).  The key to the series is that the writers walk the fine line between wallowing in what is a pretty depressing situation and having everything be sunshine and ponies - bad, scary, and ugly things happen, but so do hopeful and reassuring things.  Final note - lots of good stuff on the difficulties of leadership and parenting, which in many cases highlights the overlap between the two.",1466985600,,851,4.6158940397351

4404392,2,B004LROMWU,"Where to begin.... The show had an amazing opening which prioritized action over story telling which is enough of a reason for me to give it 5 stars but after episode one, my opinion of the show gradually fell until it hit rock bottom.  The main character (a history Professor) who is likeable in episode one because of his optimistic personality mixed with his understanding of history quickly becomes a weak hypocritical character.  while he proudly totes a AK 47 assault rifle don't expect him to shoot it as much as he voluntarily surrenders it every chance he gets.  why he even brings it places is beyond me.  All of the other characters follow the same path of sterile 2D characters who can barley act.  I can go on, but do know that this show has a great concept (a clich one but a good one) but fails due to a cast of unlikeable characters (only one is likeable), completely absurd leadership decisions, and the fact that I found myself screaming at the TV at least twice per episode.  I'm rooting for the aliens.",1465257600,,1022,4.5271739130434785

4404427,1,B004LROMWU,The show starts of slowly but gains some momentum after S1E8. The show has lots of lows(of the size of craters on moon) and very few highs. The story has lots of holes. digital imagery is decent but main concern is direction. Tom Mason and his family members go and visit the alien ships as if its their grandpa's home. To make it worse is the more than obvious twist/turns/moles. I can go on and on but who the time.,1464825600,,417,4.225

I get it, every post apocalyptic show has to have people deal with losing faith, but the way it's done is unbearable. at episode 4 I'm already beyond done with that girl. They just keep forcing this idea that somehow, everyone but her, immediately lost all religious faith soon as anything bad happened (yeah... okay.)  it's just being pushed over and over like some big thing that really has nothing useful to add to the series.

again, still giving it 4 stars, still really enjoy it, but yes, that part is torture.",1463961600,,609,4.468468468468468

Any modern tank would have a field day with those.  EMP pulse that wipes out all of earth's electronics..what happened to Faraday cages? And what about tons and tons of old weaponry that don't even have semi-conductors? I find it hard to believe the Aliens would be able to sniff out all of the military bases, including underground, missile silos, submarines, etc. and hit them all at the same time, leaving the earthlings helpless...but all of that I could swallow. It was hard, but I did. But..when in the last episode Tom whips out an RPG and uses it as a surface-to-air missile a la stinger style and shoots down an aircraft way up above..that's when I've had enough..will not be watching second season, I've had enough frustration with the first..but hey, some people not as picky as me, might actually like it..graphics is good..but it's no longer enough on its own to attract the audience.",1462406400,2,1111,4.668367346938775

Special effects are not up to modern standards we are all used to, Aliens and Alien Robots seems like my own home animations, not really meant to be shared with the public... If Marvel's Agents of shield is rated ""10"" on special effects, this show I would rate it 4.5 - that said, it's really MY viewpoint. Im a fan of special effects since Star wars saga started... Growing up, my daily reading would be Marvel and DC comics, and this story reminds me of plots developed in the 80's in several of these comics. Still good to go for me!

The acting was totally believable. All the actors fit just right. Except I would have chosen a dark haired woman as Tom Mason's first wife, as Hal had dark hair and Tom, Ben and Matt had brown hair. A minor detail. Would loved to have seen another love scene between Hal and Maggie, and they could have played up the rivalry  between Maggie and Lourdes. And Will Patton should win a special Emmy Award as Captain Weaver. An outstanding science fiction drama. There should be a Falling Skies 10 years later.

4404815,4,B004LROMWU,"Where are all the women?  I really enjoy this show so far.  I'm a big fan of the genre and this seems to be a solid addition.  I really enjoy Noah Wyle's character.  I've enjoyed his work since ER.  My biggest complaint so far is that there is a serious lack of strong female characters.  We have one in the whole cast, the doctor.  And even that one character has had very little character development.  Some of what I love about Sci-Fi is the strong female characters, but this show is definitely lacking.  I'm going to cross my fingers and hope that we can see some others development in the next seasons.",1459209600,,608,4.357142857142857

4404820,4,B004LROMWU,"After two or three episodes I was contemplating moving on to another series, however as time went on Falling Skies became more and more interesting and I became more engrossed in the story.  I feel that the series is well-acted and even though it is more or less a fantasy, it is about as believable as any other alien invasion series.  Now each episode leaves me looking forward to the next one which is just what you look for in a show.  It is a story about survivors of an alien attack, actually a complete invasion and how they cope with all of the hardships on a day to day basis.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys shows such as Lost and Defiance.  I am sure I will give it 5 stars next season.",1459209600,,708,4.176470588235294

It's about people who make mistakes and fail and have the faults and foibles all humans have, but never give up and keep trying, and behave with respect and integrity.
