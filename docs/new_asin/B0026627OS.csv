8352105,5,B0026627OS,The whole series is an intense cop/psych type show.  I also like Robson Green in anything.  He's the police consultant that helps with the psych side of the crimes - in the later series the term profiler was used.  It's a good blend of the police work side and the characters personal lives.  Warning:  These are not 'light' crimes - some are brutal and raw.,1394841600,,358,4.446153846153846
