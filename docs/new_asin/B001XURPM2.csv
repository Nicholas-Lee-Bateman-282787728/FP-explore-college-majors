3828895,4,B001XURPM2,"A good little movie to scratch a comedy horror itch.  I loved the movie.  The effects and writing were solid.  The jokes were funny and honestly the makeup was amazing for a low budget film.  Loved the characters, all of the actors were great.  I hear that a sequel is in the works and I can't wait to see it.",1354665600,3,309,4.083333333333333
3828896,4,B001XURPM2,"""It's in good company with THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA and ALIEN TRESPASS...charming and fun...THE NIGHT SHIFT is for those who can laugh at how silly this little horror genre can be."" - Ain't It Cool News

""I love this film! Fulmer...was likable, affable and relatable. Lilley...was equally enjoyable...I absolutely loved Herbie! Story was also very well done with perfect pacing and progression...never gets mushy or lame...really nice chemistry between [Fulmer and Lilley]. Fulmer played the character with just the right amount of humor and seriousness to keep the character real. The oddity, the interestingness, and the affability of the main character; everything comes together and makes for a really good experience. A definite buy. It's just that good."" --A Little Dead Podcast

""Full of campy fun...entertaining"" --28 Days Later Analysis

""Funny, action packed little film with a lot of potential to be a cult classic. The story was unique and the acting was all very professional. The story definitely had enough substance to fill out the running time and there weren't really any slow points. It's nice to see something as original and entertaining as The Night Shift.""-- B Movies and Beyond

""Scores an `A'. Seek out this campy and infectiously enjoyable horror comedy...a feast for all to enjoy. The Night Shift is pure and simply fun. It infects instantly with a vibe of sincerity...The reins are confidently gripped in the largely untried hands of this young Mr. Smith. He displays a deep and considered passion for his craft and an obvious respect for the eclectic heritage of the ghouls he has gathered here to conduct. Rue Morgan (Khristian Fulmer)...delights as the graveyards perpetually flummoxed caretaker. He also comprises one half of comedic double act that surprises by actually succeeding in drawing out both humor and empathy. Herbie (Soren Odom) is a scene-stealer...Erin Lilley's plucky portrayal of Cemetery overseer Claire Rennfield is nicely restrained...Jam-packed to overstuffed with inoffensive fun... a special treat...do yourself a favor, go give it a look-see - just don't forget to bring the kids.""--Suite 101

""Incredibly competent acting crew. Kristian Fulmer...proves to be a capable actor up to the task at hand. The story was interesting and involving enough that you could easily see a marketable big budget film squeezed out of the script sponge...audacious and daring...an entertaining piece of independent fun. 7/10""--Killer Reviews

""Thomas Smith's THE NIGHT SHIFT is one of these special films with a great concept and a love of fun accessible entertainment. Smith's core concept with THE NIGHT SHIFT is pure gold. The interplay between Morgan and Herb is one of the best things about the film...it's classic Laurel and Hardy interplay and gives the film an immediate nostalgia for those bygone days of cinema...quite fun and engaging. [Smith] does what all great next-generation filmmakers do...[THE NIGHT SHIFT is] sweet 80's fare with a sly nod to the absurd, nostalgic heart and ample breadth of imagination.""--Independent Film Reviews

""A fun little watch...clever written script and some fun characters. I am excited to see what is coming up next from Thomas Smith. Give this film a shot. 7/10"" -- Wicked Channel

""Ambitious...old-school...storytelling done the old fashioned way. A unique and sincere independent film. Professional and competent...impressed with how Smith got the job done."" -- Drive In of the Dead",1315699200,3,3476,5.341864716636198
3828897,4,B001XURPM2,"I had the pleasure of reviewing this film on my podcast (A Little Dead Podcast) a few months back and absolutely loved it.

The film centers on the night caretaker for Pinewood Oaks Cemetery, named Rue Morgan. He and his best friend, the skeletal Herb, enjoy evenings playing cards with other residents, including Roderick, a Civil War soldier who shares a rivalrous relationship with Rue. And speaking of relationships, there's the pretty Claire who has his eyes.

But there's something going on in the cemetery, something just under the surface. And I don't mean the reanimate residents either. There's something more sinister going on that Rue has to face. It's his responsibility and the leader of The Night Shift.

I loved the film. The acting was superb, light and never distracting from the story. The actors were believable, especially Khristian Fulmer as Rue. All in all a great film and one I highly recommend to you.",1313625600,11,927,4.92948717948718
3828898,4,B001XURPM2,"This is an independent film, from the low- to no-budget category, but it is an original humorous take on the horror genre that works. I wish it were longer, but I also realize it is a labor of love for all involved, doing what they enjoy doing. This group may be making it big one day...",1249776000,,287,4.142857142857143

3828901,3,B001XURPM2,"I watched this before watching the sequel, Night of the Krampus. For a low budget film, it makes good use minimal special effects to reinforce the storytelling. This is essentially a workplace comedy-drama about two people from very different backgrounds who supervise the day-to-day operation of a retirement community (the cemetary residents play games, watch TV and don't leave just like most people in retirement communities). It does drag in places, but I think that's because this is really a two-episode show presented as a two-hour film. I wonder how it would do as a sponsored web series. The writing is very good, taking typical some of the workplace issues everybody's had and translating it to an urban fantasy setting. Even considering the fantasy setting, everyone talked like real people would, including all the awkwardness compared to slick dialogue from the major studios.",1445644800,,890,5.230769230769231

3828903,4,B001XURPM2,"Really liked this silly movie. The makeup was awful but the acting was pretty good, as was the dialogue. The whole movie was very funny. A talking skeleton in a backpack, a baseball-impaired zombie, and a gentleman rebel antagonist who sounds like Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday in Tombstone (I'm your Huckleberry). Great fun. Watch it.",1445299200,2,331,4.928571428571429
3828904,4,B001XURPM2,"This is not your typical horror film.  Nothing gruesome, no computer generated images, simply set in a graveyard with actors in costumes obviously enjoying their roles.

3828907,3,B001XURPM2,This was more like the pilot for a  series but it left out a few things like it was a  series  and we were seeing the 2 episode. I honestly think this would make a great series  it was entertaining towered the end and the middle a bit slow paced at first leaving you thinking what are they leaving out there are references to a person before the main character and things like that. Its hard to say much without spoilers for the video. If anyone is looking to make a series I think this would be great to start with it has a lot of elements people like right now.,1434844800,3,563,4.045045045045045
3828908,3,B001XURPM2,"You should only watch this movie for entertainment purposes only.
Don't look for messages or meanings,there are none.
This silly and at times dumb movie is one to be just watched and enjoyed.
Don't over think this, it's just an undead comic romp. It's kinda hokey at times but is close to Bubba-HoTep for watching enjoyment.",1432944000,,324,4.803571428571429
3828909,3,B001XURPM2,"Better thought out than a lot of big budget horror comedies. This is a 0 budget, set your expectations there. There are some actors having fun, there are a few solid performances, and there is some very limited action. The story line is more coherent than usual, which helps a lot. I had to watch this in a few sittings, it does get a little slow in places. All in all though I have to rate this a fairly solid average film.",1424995200,,424,4.182926829268292

Can he convince his co-worker and main-squeeze wannabe Claire that there is a threat before it's too late?  I liked this movie.  The acting was decent and the characters were likable, especially Herb, the limbless, wise-cracking skeleton and Curly, the ""Forrest Gump"" of zombies.  Yeah, it was low budget and way too long, but it had a neat premise and the potential to be a top-notch horror/comedy movie.  If you have it free on Prime, I think it's worth a look.",1415836800,,590,4.91919191919192
3828911,3,B001XURPM2,"Well I'll say this much, there is not much of a plot and the acting is less than good, but it is funny. If you like funny dealing with a grave yard go for it.",1415577600,,158,3.5428571428571427
3828912,2,B001XURPM2,"Overall just too long and boring. The oddball romance between Rue and Claire is OK, as is the buddy adventure subplot with Herbie, but man, 123 minutes? I thought Curly was adorable and wanted to take him home, and a lot of the other peripheral cemetery residents were fun, even the unseen ones like the kids. Roderick had ""Kevin Costner"" challenges with his accent, which faded in and out, and he was probably the weakest member of the cast.

The big frustration for me was the confusion around the standard ghost/monster/zombie dynamic in which powers and objectives were all over the place. OK, so someone unlocks Adremalech and he is a demon, but he is a cowboy demon with a gun. And Rue has a gun (part of the job?), along with other randomly selected ""weapons"" like dynamite and a silver-bladed knife (huh?), and then we get random action scenes that make no sense. The demon shoots his gun at Rue and NEVER runs out of bullets, but Rue does. Then Rue tries dynamite. Then they chase the werewolf, but the werewolf is a high school kid who died and was buried and is now a werewolf? And then they kill him and ""give him peace""? And what is the goal of ""killing"" a dead person? A demon? A werewolf? The logic, even at a basic level, is full of gigantic holes.",1411516800,,1264,4.448275862068965

3828917,2,B001XURPM2,"Rue Morgan (Khristian Fulmer) is an undead cemetery caretaker tasked with keeping the undead on the grounds at night. His day time counterpart is the living Claire (Erin Lilley). Rue likes Claire, although she doesn't see herself in a physical relationship with a dead guy, no matter how nice he may be. Rue is troubled by rare happenings on the grounds that task him.

The film includes the proverbial dead guy playing chess with death and a bunch of Zombies watching a zombie movie. The film is ""Dylan Dog"" cute, but the execution was terrible. The acting was bad highlighted by long conversations that did nothing but take up film. The film is way too long and boring.

3828918,5,B001XURPM2,"This llight hearted ow budget movie produced by an independent film company was hugely entertaining.  It is basically a cross between the Walking Dead and Night at the Museum. Khristian Fulmer plays an irreverent undead watchman (Rex) who supervises the residents of a cemetery. When night falls and the cemetery closes, the dearly departed come out of their graves and crypts to walk the Earth and to enjoy the night. The watchman' s job is to keep the residents of this cemetery in the graveyard and to discourage any mayhem that might leave this place looking unpredictable come morning.

While most of the residents are content to watch films, play games, and socialize, a small element have untoward plans that could result in athe Apocalypse. Will Rex be able to uncover this plot and overcome the forces of evil? His human supervisor played by Erin Lilley, believes that he suffers from paranoid delusions and the mysterious upper management is one step away from replacing him with someone who is more responsible.",1403568000,2,1022,4.970760233918129

When I put this on, PURE BLISS!  Passed right out, it must have been so gloriously uninteresting.

3828922,4,B001XURPM2,"I rented this movie from Amazon and was pleasantly surprised.  In a way 'The Night Shift' reminded me of the 1996 Michael J. Fox film, 'The Frighteners.' It's basically a supernatural comedy set in a graveyard populated by various undead creatures.  The pacing of the movie could be better; at a little over two hours in some parts, it does drag a little.  However, this slow boil gives the film a chance to develop its lead characters and, in this respect, I think the writers and performers did a fine job. There are a couple of moments where the audio/video quality get a bit fuzzy, but these are fairly minor and don't detract from the film experience.
Overall, though, I thought 'The Night Shift' was a fun flick.",1372982400,10,718,4.59375
3828923,1,B001XURPM2,The movie was really cheesy. I watched it only for the first 10 minutes and I had to stop.  It was just awful.,1372550400,,110,3.782608695652174

This could of been good but it couldn't keep me interested and at 2 hours and 7 minutes that's too long for a romantic horror comedy.,1369699200,,333,4.0606060606060606
3828925,2,B001XURPM2,"The movie wasn't too bad, the filming and acting were ok. It isn't the best movie but the characters are likeable.  B-movie quality. Somewhat cheesy. Interesting storyline",1367020800,,171,5.333333333333333
3828926,3,B001XURPM2,A mid quality independent film worth watching if you like this sort of thing. It's comedy and meant to be so. It's also a horror action flick. The Skeleton gave me the best laugh I've had in quite a while. It has a decent and interesting plot and sub plot. The acting is good enough from the main characters to not be annoying. There's some quality issues with blurryness and bad sound in a few spots but overall its fine. It's kinda longer than it needs to be but its entertaining enough when there's nothing else to do.,1358035200,7,521,4.326530612244898
3828927,4,B001XURPM2,"I just finished streaming this movie, and I must say I began it with very low expectations.  I was glad to have been proved wrong.

Don't expect to see an academy award winner with this film.  The acting is OK.  That being said, I found it to be an offbeat, quirky comedy.  Very nice if you are looking for something completely different to watch.  At least the film makers tried to do a unique film, and didn't settle for a rehashed ""zombie comedy pic"" script.

The makeup is about what you'd expect to see in a Halloween haunted house- not professional, but the film makers did a decent job.  The cemetery set is also pretty believable.

The plot is a little unfocused, veering all over the place, and the end is a bit too neat for my taste.  I mean, really- a werewolf bites a zombie, and he turns into a werewolf?  (And how in the heck did a werewolf get in here, anyway?)

The reason I gave the film 4 stars is twofold; the cast (and their characters) are really likeable, and there are some very funny jokes worked into the script.  The joke that first got my attention was when all the ""residents"" of the graveyard gathered for movie night.  They were showing NOTLD, and when it was announced what was playing, a George Romero zombie lookalike got up to leave.  He had to be convinced he'd like the movie. The character of Curly the zombie was just endearing.  (...never thought I'd call a zombie ""endearing""....with perhaps the exceptions of Fido, from the movie ""Fido"", and Bub, from ""Day of the Dead."")

A major strike against it is that it's too long at over 2 hours.  It could have been 1 hour 15 minutes or so, and still get in all the plot points it needed.  (the afore-mentioned werewolf part should have never been included, and a lot of the dialogue could be dropped with no problem.)  It also looked like it was setting something up by showing the caretaker's headstone.  It's evident that he died in the 1920s, and they show his death date to be October 29th, 1929- the date of the stock market crash leading up to the Great Depression.  I was hoping this would come into play somewhere down the line, but it never did.  Why pick that death date if it was never to be addressed?

Still, I have to tip my hat to the film maker's ambition.  Just because they didn't score a bullseye doesn't mean they missed the target completely.  If you're in the mood for something other than the normal zombie fare, you could do a LOT worse than this film.  Give it a chance; you might be pleasantly surprised, just as I was.",1357171200,2,2529,4.394396551724138
3828928,3,B001XURPM2,I don't see how this film got such high ratings even though it did have it good points it was a super cheaply made movie. A bigger budget may have helped it a bit but I can't bring myself to give it more than 3 stars for effort. The script was ok and some of the actors were able to carry their lines but to be honest it was a chore setting through it.
