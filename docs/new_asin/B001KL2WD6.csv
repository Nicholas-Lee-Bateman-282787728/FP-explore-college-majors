The guy who use to be a crip gang leader, and now a change man since he tries to reach out young kids to stay away from gangs! It's so sad that they had to execute him when they could had just give him a retrial! Everybody makes mistakes and deserves a second chance! He really did try to save kids from self destruction! So may I say rest in peace to Mr. Stanley ""Tookie"" Williams!

8315178,5,B001KL2WD6,"This documentary is inspirational and heart-breaking, that a person of Tookie's gifts to young people could be executed by the State after turning his life around. The DVD consists of a reenactment of his execution, speeches at the memorial service for Tookie -- where Snoop Dogg, Tony Robbins, Jesse Jackson, Louis Farrakhan and others spoke movingly of Tookie and his contributions to kids through his books and the movie about his life starring Jamie Foxx -- and two close friends who took his ashes to South Africa, as he requested, to spread them there, his final resting place. A remarkable story, an extraordinary man.",1237680000,3,625,5.019230769230769
