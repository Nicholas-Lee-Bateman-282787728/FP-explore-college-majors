There are some slow parts, and there are some good things too.  All-in-all, if you want to watch a film that doesn't try to gross you out with torture for the sake of torture, this film is not bad.  Too bad there was not more money for better equipment and actors.",1258588800,,436,4.228915662650603
8129180,1,B000G6Y43M,"There are low-budget films that succeed despite their limitations.
There are those that are camp and fun because of their limitations.
And then there is the unique kind of trash that has come about in the 'camcorder age' and which has absolutely nothing to recommend it.

This is one such project.

Shot with a cheap camcorder, directed, edited and 'acted' by people who have no cinema skills, this abomination has only one thing about it that is truly frightening:
How could they get anyone to actually distribute this on DVD?

I watched about 6 minutes of this on Netflix streaming, and that was more than enough.
