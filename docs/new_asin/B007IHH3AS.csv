5089051,2,B007IHH3AS,"The story is moving too slowly, and the main protagonist is hard to empathize with. But l liked the fresh approach, so different from the frenetic, over the top ways of run of the mill Indian cinema.",1444867200,,199,4.405405405405405
5089052,5,B007IHH3AS,"Excellent movie. Simply love it. Why it was never screened widely? The story is realistic. Somebody wrote that the girl studying in US wasn't practical. But, I being in US in academia have seen very bright students from Kashmir.",1443830400,,228,4.871794871794871

5089056,5,B007IHH3AS,"Filmed mostly in the streets of Srinagar, Kashmir showing the daily lives of a people living in an undercurrent of tension from the persistent religious conflicts between Islam and Hinduism and to a lesser extent Buddhism and other religious groups.  A small crew filming without the use of professional or even amateur actors. Actors recruited with no previous experience who, nevertheless, produced a most believable and naturalistic drama of love and survival. The survival tactics seemed petty compared to western standards, yet you felt their necessity of fighting for the smallest advantage; for small lies and for pennies.

My minor criticisms are in portrayals that seemed a little too unlikely such as a Kashmir woman working as a clerk, yet has a US educated physics background.
The other area that seemed lacking was a greater, more in depth, understanding of our characters, the city, the region, the nature of the religious discord, the political entanglements from Pakistan, India and China in that region. But perhaps I'm asking too much for a very budget restricted (although you couldn't tell) production.

Besides the acting the script was engaging with it's mounting conflict, uncertainty, tension and resolution.",1345852800,3,1232,5.34020618556701

8517522,5,B007IHH3AS,"I have rented this movie from my local library (DVD).  It is independent film, coming of age story from Kashmir.  If one can get over average acting, it is a touching story of a young 17 year old boy adopted by a family that treats his as properly.  He is smart and resourceful  Although he skips the school a lot and occasionally mixes with a wrong crowd that teaches him how to steal, he also finds a way to make money by doing his friend's homework for a fee.  Business gets even better when circumstances put him in touch with a 28 year old woman from the local Tourist Office.  She is beautiful and well educated.  She earned her degree in Physics in the US and has return back to India to live with her family.  But education adn exposure to the free world has changed her and she finds it difficult to adapt to the old way of life and her family's and society's expectations fo women.  Two strike friendship in spite of their age difference.  There are a few things they have in common: both are intelligent, both are social misfits of sorts and both are desperate to escape their families and a life in a small city.  Set of events forces them to make a pact to escape to Delhi but as destiny will have it, nothign goes according to the plan and movie has explosive and heartbreaking ending which makes is a masterpiece of sorts.

I loved the story and director's bold take on what it is like to live in a backward place where society forces people to do things they normally never would have.  For anyone who loves a great story and foreign films with their unique view of the world this is a must see movie.  It is a film about some of the most vulnerable people in the society: orphans and women.  This film has subtitles.",1477526400,,1733,4.305555555555555
