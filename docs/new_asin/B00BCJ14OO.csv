8565960,3,B00BCJ14OO,"I gave this three stars because the second dvd ""Rockets and Missiles"" is mostly a rehash of the SAME topics and footage/content that is shown in the Modern Missiles dvd. I liked the ""Modern Missiles"" dvd better because it was presented better and the topics interested me more. The ""Rockets and Missiles"" dvd has a couple of topics that are not included in the other dvd, like Sea Eagle and RBS70 missile systems but in my opinion it is not worth buying. The ""Modern Missiles"" dvd will have almost the same content. The footage and content are from the 1980s during the Cold War. There is NO current footage of recent missile systems. I will list the scenes/chapters for the Modern Missiles dvd below:

1. FIRING POST - setup and live fire footage of the French Milan anti-tank missile.

2. MISSILE TUBES - includes footage of the British Javelin and Rapier anti-aircraft missiles with demo and technology content. Also includes the American Chaparral and French Roland missile systems.

3. STAR STREAK -  British anti-aircraft missile system, ADATS, Hellfire, Maverick anti-tank missile systems.

4. HIGH SPEED ANTI-RADIATION MISSILE - HARM, Phoenix, Sidewinder, AMRAAM air-to-air missile systems live fire tests and of their technology.

5. HARPOON - Exocet (French), Sea Dart(UK), Sea Wolf(UK), Standard SM-2 including the Aegis and VLS systems footage.

6. FLEET BALLISTIC MISSILE SUBMARINE - Trident C4 and D5 missile firing footage, Tomahawk (footage of all versions), MX, MLRS live fire tests.

The dated nature of the footage (ALL of it is from the Cold War era) makes this a good HISTORICAL collection of different missile systems and their technology. I was expecting more footage on the ICBMs and the SLBMs so I was disappointed with this dvd. For the rocket enthusiast looking for something from the Cold War era, this would be a good buy for the price but DO NOT purchase the ""Rockets and Missiles"" dvd because it has almost the same content, so you would be wasting your money. I recommend you buy the Modern Missiles dvd separately, ONLY if you do not mind that the content is from the Cold War. Again, there is nothing current on the Modern Missiles dvd or on any of today's advanced missile technology. I included the list of chapters because I thought it would be of interest to rocket enthusiasts or military technology buffs. But for the person with a passing interest or curiosity in military missile systems this would be a disappointment!",1372377600,,2461,4.927536231884058
