If you really want to know truth read the Bible and find good Biblically aligned books, try Joel Richardson's The Islamic Anti-Christ' for a good start,and skip this type of trash which mixes every fake prophetic source they can find in an attempt to water down the true Scriptures which point only to Jesus.

3730420,5,B001OLP2SY,"The DVD ( Seven Signs of The Apocalypse ) is the very best for those who love Science and Biblical Prophecy. It combines the best of both worlds by fairly looking at and combining possible ways that our planet can be destroyed by both Natural & Super natural means, Man's incompetence through neglect, Global War and Biblical Prophecy.
  It's realistic and well thought out by experts on both sides of the issue and has great visual effects of these events. It's one of the really good End Times DVD's that shows how this world of ours can end and presented by highly educated scolars in Science and Biblical Prophecy as they work together on this topic.
  I will more than likely in the future order more of these and from a person who loves the Bible and Technology, I say it is the best Movie / Doc. out there. Mark",1249948800,31,818,4.433333333333334
3730421,1,B001OLP2SY,"This is nothing more than supposition presented as factual, scientific research.  The narrator delivers sentences like, ""An astroid collision could happen, so it's not a question of if but when.""  I'm sorry, but the verb ""could"" implies ""if.""  But, to present this as a definite is utterly irresponsible.  This is nothing but worse-case, doomsday scenarios (and that's just what they are hypothetical scenarios) offered as examples of our ultimate demise.  It has without a doubt created even much deeper skeptisicm with material from the History Channel.",1244592000,3,555,5.406976744186046

8330773,1,B001OLP2SY,"The program begins by talking about 7 seals on a scroll on which the Book of Revelation is written with each seal being some kind of end-of-the-world prophecy.  So why, then does the program ignore seals 1-3 and go immediately to seal 4?

Could it be that the History Channels experts aren't experts at all?

To begin with the scroll with the 7 seals isn't the Book of Revelation, i.e., what the Apostle John wrote down.  The 7-sealed scroll comes from Christ in Heaven (Revelation 5:1).  John merely writes down what he sees when the seals are broken.

Revelation 6:1-2 opens the 1st seal and unleashes a conqueror on a white horse.

Revelation 6:3-4 opens the 2nd seal and unleashes a red horse whose rider brings war and strife.

Revelation 6:5-6 opens the 3rd seal and its horseman brings famine.

Most people (in my personal study) take the 1st horseman to be the antichrist.  But, if you compare these verses in Revelation with Matthew 24:14 and then 24:6-8 youll see obvious parallels: the Gospel of Christ is taken to the entire world thus giving the world a chance to repent, and when repentance doesnt come Gods judgment- wars, famines, pestilence and natural disaster- begins in earnest.

So the History Channel ignores the Gospel of Christ and the warning of pre-tribulation judgment because the liberals who run the History Channel do not want anyone to repent.",1440720000,,1374,4.804255319148936

8330778,4,B001OLP2SY,"This CD could have been rated highest of all with great quotation of all facts.  However it did quote the hoax of Goble Warming as a fact instead of fiction.  It was a tense moment to see the Writers of faction and of witchcraft on the screen. The CD did keep them to facts and Bible verses without allowing them to stray into a 3rd coming of Jesus that they claim will occur before the 2nd Coming.  Most of the time these producers of fiction do not stay with the facts of the Bible and add the Margret Campbell fiction into their work. The history CD stayed with the verses and prophecies very close. The political agenda of Goble Warming or now Climate Change it not a part of Revelation.  The Goble Warning Hoax name was changed because the Scientist consensus that made it up, suddenly realized the climate was not warning.  So now it is called Climate Change.  The CD left the facts to promote the Hoax.  Over all the was real good information.  Out of the three interpretations concerning Revelations, this fit most the most popular one.  Dose not match the South American or the Political one at all.  If a person can separate the political agenda Hoax from the real facts then this will be a great CD to have.",1412467200,,1218,4.42152466367713

8330780,1,B001OLP2SY,"Wow, what a piece of junk! It's as though the nut-job on the corner with a ""The end is near"" sign was given keys to the History Channel studios. How about raising the bar a little? I know that scaring people sells DVD's, but don't you think it is your duty to to give rational experts some time on the subject. I'm a science teacher and I'm constantly having to correct misconceptions propagated by the History Channel. Unfortunately, I have to remind my students to not believe everything they see on TV!",1292716800,4,505,4.5
