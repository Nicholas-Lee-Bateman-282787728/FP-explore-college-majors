7904796,2,B000006QHT,"I have 5 more documentaries on Castro and I spent the years between 1962 and 1964 listening to his speeches in Havana on a short wave radio from the Dominican Republic with other Peace Corps Volunteers. I have reached the conclusion that he was extremely popular with the majority of Cubans after he defeated Batista's Army and the dictator left the country, but as he aged he lost the support from many of the Cuban people. A&E also ignores  Castro's  popularity in third world countries. Biography misses Fidel's appeal to  Cubans, but many Cubans got out of Cuba when they could. Castro became the dictator of a third world country depending on horses to plow and haul the crops.",1390780800,,682,4.714285714285714
7904797,2,B000006QHT,"This may be helpful in a junior high docial studies classroom, as it contains a very basic outline (in less than 50 minutes) of Castro's life, and briefly touches on his time as Cuba's leader through 1996, when the documentary was produced. It consists mostly of (not exactly rare) photographs of Castro through his life, and some video footage of him meeting with Soviet Premier Khrushchev. Overall, this documentary contains nothing that can't already be found on Wikipedia (information and photographs) or YouTube (video footage).

The final ten minutes is subjective, not objective, and consists of the personal opinions on Castro of people who were U.S. officials or journalists during the Cold War.

Overall, I was expecting a lot more and remain unimpressed--and I certainly do not consider myself a guru on post-1959 Cuban history.",1317600000,,839,5.207407407407407
7904798,2,B000006QHT,"You should take note of the purported location of the other reviewers on this page. That is significant because their reviews bear little, and most often no, resemblance to the film. One can only wonder if the reviewers are from the exile Cuban community or are their fellow travelers. In my estimation, the relative high ratings that the reviewers gave the film is their attempt to induce you to purchase the film since it mostly trashes Castro and the revolution in Cuba. The only ""credit"" that film accords to Castro, in rather amorphous and fleeting ways, is:
1. The universal health care system in Cuba.
2. The elimination of illiteracy in Cuba (although one pundit in the film makes the dubious claim that literacy in Cuba is not universal).
3. The low infant mortality rate in Cuba.
4. The rise of Cuban nationalistic pride.
These, of course, are not small accomplishments for a third world country subject to 44 years of an American embargo, invasion by CIA trained forces, frequent acts of sabotage and provocation by violent elements in the exile community, numerous CIA inspired assassination attempts on Castro and other members of the Cuban leadership, frequent diplomatic bullying of other nations by the US State Department to accede to US policies regarding Cuba (esp. 3rd world countries dependant on US aid), an unremitting barrage of US inspired radio propaganda to the Cuban people to resist their government, apparent and unrelenting dissemination of disinformation about Cuba as is, arguably, indicated by the reviews appearing here and so on and so on. As should be expected, the film makes little of these moral crimes against the Cuban people. Nor does the film seem to interview people clearly sympathetic to Castro.
Castro is not interviewed once. The reviewer's claims about Barbara Walters interviewing Castro, his singing, etc. are bogus. They are not in the film.
The fact that Castro isn't interviewed is telling: the film does not allow Castro to answer the charges made against him. That way the charges stand unadjudicated, as it were--lurking as potential smears. That is this film's damning liability.
The film does have good scenes from Cuba and some interesting clips of Castro. Otherwise, I recommend that you find a film that is willing to assume the politically risky possibility that Castro and Cuba just might have a perspective.",1051574400,44,2373,5.0561224489795915
