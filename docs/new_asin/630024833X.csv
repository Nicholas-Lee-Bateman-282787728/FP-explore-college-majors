Just recived it in the mail & the first I did I popped it in my DVD/VCR player/recorder that I bought here! After seeing theses videos, I thought ""Wow I have not seen these in about 25 to 28 years. Has it been that long?"" I forgot how awesome they were. From the gravely bluesy voice of Kevin DuBrow {1955-2007} to the heart pounding bass playing of Rudy Sarzo to the bone crunching guitar licks of Carlos Cavazo & the explosive thunderous drum beats of Frankie Banali would make anyone who was there at that pinacle point of heavy metal to relive it all over again! Seeing & listening to the music & the videos now, & they are better when they were first released! It is that awesome & worth every penny!",1321920000,,717,4.350746268656716

7807000,4,630024833X,"Between August and November of 1983, Quiet Riot was just HUGE! You couldn't turn on MTV without seeing the video for Cum On Feel The Noize, and Quiet Riot's Metal Health album was selling big-time. For the follow-up, the band covered another Slade song (Mama Weer All Crazee Now), which is pretty much a lesser version of Cum On Feel The Noize, and album sales started to decline. David Lee Roth wannabe Kevin DuBrow was the personification of obnoxious, from his attitude down to his voice. Already closing in on 30 and balding by the time QR made it, it's odd how his hair has actually gotten longer and fuller by the time The Wild and The Young video came out in 1986 (!). A bit sparse in terms of how many videos are actually on this, but this was the early version of the home music video format, so it is what it is. If you're a huge fan of the band, this is a must-have. If your interest is less than fanatical, just throw in a blank VHS tape the next time VH1 Classics is doing a Metal Mania block and you'll probably be able to tape most of these selections for free before too much time passes.",1205107200,,1104,4.261904761904762
7807001,5,630024833X,"Oh man I love this video. I watch it every day at least three times and have since 1987. I cannot get enough of the rich powerful singing of Kevin Dubrow, nor the shredding qualities of Carlos. If you are a rocker, and I know you are you must, you have to, I command you to BANG THY HEAD!!

This video has five music videos:

1. Cum on Feel the Noize - Ah the good old days. Here we have Kevin and the gang invading the bedroom of a typical 80's teenager. Now you have to go along with the fact that having a man screaming into a microphone while wearing leapord pants in your bedroom is a common occurance and treat it as such. The poor kid kept trying to pull the plug on that mutant stereo system but to no avail. I guess that's what you get for catching the QR mask at a show.

2. Metal Health - This is the song that will forever make Quiet Riot a cool band. If not for this one song, they may have died in oblivion two decades ago. But they wrote it and performed it 1,000,000,000,000,000 times and it is their trademark. The video highlights everything that is rock n roll; insane asylums.

3. Mama Weer all Crazee now - This video I always found a bit disturbing. Though his condition was critical, Kevin again nails another Slade classic. But how did he get so big? And where did they get a shoe that size for the second giant Dubrow? I never thought of Quiet Riot as the 1984 Big Brother band, but the mask had some sort of mind control powers. WHo were the guys in the French Foreign Legion hats? And why did the one guy break the screen? Answers we'll never know, but continue to seek.

4. Party all Night - Oh you gotta love this one. We got Quiet Riot invading a nerd house where Trivial Pursuit rules supreme. We got bikers, surfers, punkers, and QR destroying a home as the chorus continues to wail 'Party all Night!' Check out the dude with the keg and keep an eye out for the punker with the mohawk, it's a mohawk wig! Is that really beer dripping out of Kevin's nose, and why did Carlos ram the TV that was playing a QR video? Well next time you order pizza, beware of the masked delivery man.

5. The Wild and the Young - To understand this video you have to understand the 80's and the PMRC. You see rock n roll was trying to be outlawed to a point. Now I doubt that even Tipper and Al Gore would go as far as a concentration camp for rockers, but who knows. To see B.C. Rich guitars being thrown into a wood chipper breaks my heart everyday. Of course the standout visual on this is the new wig that Kevin decided he needed to sport. I guess he figured QR's success would only be achieved by the size of his hair. I could never figure out if he looked more like a third rate Bon Jovi or a poodle. The wig is hillarious but it will o ne day be in the rock n roll hall of fame. Check out Dick Clark in his 'No Rock n Roll' cameo. The little warden was a wicked little woman, but she's probably dead by now.

Enjoy!",1103241600,,2934,4.083333333333333
