2023017,5,B0001O3YP8,"Being a whale and dolphin lover and also a marine life artist, I purchased this set because I've never seen any of them. However, I've always wondered about them. I guess I never put it into much thought since I didn't grow to love these animals until I started to grow up. Now since I watched the first film the love has grown even more. This is a good deal too. 3 movies for about 5 bucks is all I paid-plus the extra shipping which is 3.00. Not bad at all for an excellent set of movies!

I wanted this movie because of the name and the story I heard about it. I was so pleased, but also shocked at the reality of what's really happening with these animals in captivity. They really don't belong in marine parks and shows. It is a jail for them. Even if you treat them right, they are suffering. How do you know they're happy? Do they tell you that? NO! They can't even speak for themselves so we must speak for them. Putting them into these tanks is mistreatment of animals. You may think it's big, but really it isn't. They need the huge vast ocean. Nothing can be bigger than that. Now all they can do is swim in circles. Like putting a goldfish in a teacup. Putting them in these tanks with hundreds or thousands of screaming people in a surrounding stadium hurts and disturbs them. They have very sensitive hearing. It messes up their sonar just like being contained in a small space they're put in. They are taken away from their home, their families(they're very social animals like us), their life in the ocean which is their natural environment. Now they are forced to do nothing but perform tricks for human entertainment for profits. I think we humans are pretty greedy and selfish. If they do a trick, they get fed. If they refuse to do the trick, no fish. Do they have a choice? Now they are forced to live unnaturally the rest of their lives. They must open their mouth to have a dead fish tossed in their mouth. This has become the daily routine. In the natural ocean, they hunt and forge for their food which is not dead but live. This is the natural (real) way that nature intended.

Now I see the reality. We underestimate these beautiful, intelligent creatures. In captivity they get aggitated. I can understand why. Recently a trainer at SeaWorld was killed by an Orca. I feel sympathy and great sadness on the families part but really, have we looked at the whales point of view? Once a man was found dead draped over the back of the same Orca who killed the trainer. People blame the whale for killing that man. But no one saw what really happened. How do we know the truth? I don't think we should assume anything without the proof. Maybe the man just fell in-just like the kid did in the first movie. The man probably drown and the whale tried to save him. It is possible. Or the whale is just angry of being cooped up in this prison.

I think we should all think this through more. We should all watch this film and learn something from it. Learn our own mistake done by human hands. These animals deserve better treatment. To be free in the ocean and live the life they were born to live-like God intended. Not some amusement park attraction. I'd rather pay to go on a boat way out to open sea, and see the whales in the real ocean instead. I am boycotting all marine parks/shows after seeing this film. When I heard that whale cry in this movie, I was in tears. It really changed me.

A very moving film that touched my heart and I hope others will feel the same way I do. We should all have a heart. It is the human and right thing to do. Excellent movie. I'm still in tears for the whales in this world suffering in captivity. May God have mercy on them all.",1306540800,,3690,4.305035971223021

2023021,4,B0001O3YP8,"12-year-old Jesse (Jason James Richter) is an Angry Young Boy, and not without reason: six years ago his mother dumped him on the doorstep of Family Services and took off, and not even the Federal government has been able to find out where she is.  But Jesse stubbornly insists that she will return for him someday, and meanwhile he's not interested in co-operating with anyone, including his caseworker Dwight Mercer (Mykelti Williamson) or any of the foster homes he's gone to.  Temporarily loose, he and a friend are vandalizing a local aquarium when he comes face-to-nose with a captive orca and is utterly entranced.  Required to clean up the damage he's done, he accepts the sentence willingly for the chance to learn more about Willy the whale (Keiko), even though it also means another foster home with Glen and Annie Greenwood (Michael Madsen, Jayne Atkinson).  Inexplicably a bond grows up between the boy and the cetacean, and Jesse even turns out to be able to train Willy to respond to cues so he can take part in the aquarium's show.  In the process he is befriended by Haida Indian maintenance man Randolph Johnson (August Schellenberg) and would-be marine biologist Rae Lindley (Lori Petty).  Then Jesse happens to witness an attempt by aquarium owner Wade (Richard Riehle) to sabotage Willy's tank so the whale will die and the insurance on him can be cashed in.  Enlisting Randolph and Rae in a race against time, Jesse sets out to return Willy to the ocean.

In the sequel, Jesse is now 14 or 15, still living with the Greenwoods and even calling Glen his ""dad,"" when he suddenly learns that his missing mother has recently died--and left him with an eight-year-old half-brother, Elvis (Francis Capra).  Though the Greenwoods willingly take Elvis in, Jesse isn't at all sure he wants anything to do with the kid, who's not only a little-brotherish kind of pest but a compulsive teller of tall tales.  However, a vacation trip to visit his old friend Randolph, now working with a marine biologist (Elizabeth Pena), brings him back into contact with his whale friend Willy, who has rejoined the pod of his birth--and hasn't fprgotten his human buddy.  As Jesse tries to sort through his relationship with Elvis and the pangs of first love with Randolph's goddaughter Nadine (Mary Kate Schellhardt), an oil spill suddenly imperils the whales, and the three youngsters make common cause to save them.

Another two years on, and we find Jesse crewing with Randolph and his new employer Drew Halbert (Annie Corley), who are still studying Willy and his pod.  What they don't know is that supposed salmon fisherman John Wesley (Patrick Kilpatrick) and his crew are really clandestine whalers--and they've got Willy's pod in their sights.  Unexpected help comes in the form of Wesley's young son Max (Vincent Berry), who, like Jesse before him, sees Willy and is lost.  Now it's a race against time to save the orcas from Wesley.

With real whales in the cast, this trilogy is suspenseful and family-friendly, and Jesse's development is well portrayed too.  Each movie could be the launch point for some good family discussion as well as an entertaining evening's watching.",1290729600,,3184,4.921495327102804

3) Free Willy 3 The Rescue - 3 Stars",1220054400,3,494,4.25531914893617
2023109,4,B0001O3YP8,"I bought this for my wife as a birthday gift.  She recently bought a ratty old copy of the first film on VHS at a yard sale & instead of dragging the VCR out of the closet I figured why not just get her the DVD and throw the tape in the trash.  I was delighted to find that I could get all three movies for the price of one.  I'm not really familiar with the Free Willy series, unless you count the occasional ""Free Willy"" sexual innuendo joke, but this is a pretty good bargain for some good clean wholesome family entertainment.",1219881600,,530,4.12621359223301
2023110,5,B0001O3YP8,"This was such a great DVD for my grandson's ages 3, & 6, I purchased 2.  One for them to have at home, and the other to have at Nana's and Papa's.  It is hard to find good clean language movies these days for children, and I would rate this one of the best for children and adults alike.  Thank you Amazon for making this kind of shows for children available today!!!!  Keep up the good work.

Also the way they made the real orca whale, Keiko, act in some scenes mixed with the computer generated whale scenes is really amazing. Who has never seen the scene in which the whale junps over and passes over the boy, and towards freedom. It's simply a good and family classic, even more if you're fan of this animals.",1169942400,3,443,4.414634146341464
