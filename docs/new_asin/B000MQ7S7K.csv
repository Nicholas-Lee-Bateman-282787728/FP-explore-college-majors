8170804,3,B000MQ7S7K,"The Falcon's Adventure (1946) Tom Conway put in the last of his ten appearances in what would pretty much be the final Falcon adventure. (There were three more movies made after this one with a character called the Falcon, but the character was modified to star John Calvert's magician persona and the films are not truly part of this series.) The producers saved some money by reusing the script from A Date with the Falcon, which starred Conway's brother George Sanders. This version puts Conway and sidekick Edward Brophy back into the same plot about the search for a formula to create industrial diamonds. Although that lends a bit of a stale air to the proceedings, credit Conway and Brophy with staying committed to their roles. I'm not sure if they knew this would be the last, but there's no sign of phoning it in, and this is a very watchable old fashioned mystery story, very much like one of the Saint movies from the same period. It also does not wear out its welcome, clocking in at one hour and one minute. Highly recommended.",1250985600,,1041,4.632432432432433
