4492246,3,B004X63RP2,Very lurid tale. 50's cheesiest at its best. John Russell [later of Lawman fame... quite a shift in gears!] at his slimiest. Long story short... the bad guy gets his just desserts in the end ;o),1313539200,6,194,4.416666666666667
4492252,5,B004X63RP2,"The actors are not real famous.  That enhances the movie.  John Russell plays an anti-hero who gets his just reward in a nightmarish scene.  The first part of the movie, just before the transition, may seem corny.  That does not matter.  The director, the cinematographer, casting, editing, and more were masterful in creating this film noir.  Pay attention to the scene where a man begs his father for heroin in a strip club.  This 1957 movie could hook you on the genre.",1449878400,,472,4.682926829268292

4492260,4,B004X63RP2,"HELL BOUND is about a man named Jordan (John Russell- LEGACY OF BLOOD, PALE RIDER), who puts together a big cargo ship heist involving a shipment of medical narcotics. He assembles his team of criminals -as it turns out, just getting the assorted crooks together takes up the lion's share of the film's running time- and gets to work on the logistics of the plan. A beautiful woman named Paula (June Blair) seems a little too eager to join the group and ""help"" Jordan w/ his enterprise. She quickly learns that Jordan's all business! Enter goody-two-shoes ambulance-driver, Eddie (Stuart Whitman- THE WOMAN HUNTER, NIGHT OF THE LEPUS, EATEN ALIVE), who hooks up w/ Paula through her job as a nurse. The two fall in love, causing a moral dilemma for Paula, and problems for Jordan's plot. Jordan needs a nurse in order for things to go right, and he's not willing to let Paula go. She soon discovers just how dangerous this man really is. Yep, he's pure eeevil! Now, just as the heist is about to commence, everything that could possibly go wrong... does! Jordan's gang starts to crumble under the weight of their own weaknesses, addictions, and idiocy. One almost feels sorry for Jordan, in spite of his being a ruthless, murdering ba$tard. HELL BOUND is a decent crime-thriller that ends very satisfactorily w/ a wonderful chase through a junkyard. Russell is the black heart and dead soul of this tale, and he delivers w/ an unflinchingly wicked performance! A keeper...",1416268800,3,1472,4.822134387351778

Was charged $5.29 (including tax) to stream this on Amazon Prime.
Wasn't worth $0.29.",1518825600,,198,5.03030303030303
8446202,5,B004X63RP2,Amazing little gem of a film that most people have never heard of. A very interesting storyline. Remember John Russell from the television series from Warner called Lawman? He also played the bad lead gunman for hire in Clint Eastwood's masterpiece Unforgiven. He has the lead in this film. Check this one out.,1508198400,,310,4.867924528301887
8446203,3,B004X63RP2,This film is okay as long as you don't think about it too much. That was a hell of a lot of work to steal some drugs of a ship. There were and are much easier ways to get drugs to sell than that. Also what kind of idiot would get a junkie to participate in such a scheme and not make sure he was well.,1493683200,,301,3.5757575757575757

8446209,4,B004X63RP2,"Though off the beaten path in the annals of moviemaking, Hell Bound is everything good film noir should be:  Flawed but interesting characters in a dark, seedy world where everyone ekes out their forlorn existence mostly by clawing over someone else.

Jordan (John Russell) has mastered a plan to heist drugs from an inbound cargo ship, but he needs money to pull it off.  The movie starts with a movie--a film Jordan produced so he could pitch his plan to an unscrupulous businessman.  Initially, Jordan appears to be a cool, sophisticated James Bond type of criminal who leaves nothing to chance and plays fair with his accomplices.  Not so, and watching his true character unfold as his plans unravel makes this movie fascinating and enjoyable.

Paula (June Blair) is thrown into the heist by the backer, and initially it appears she's the wretched, hardboiled dame who will stab Jordan in the back to run off with the spoils.  Again, not so.  Blair was a surprise in this movie:  The first scene seems to start with her still on the 'casting couch' and initially her portrayal of Paula is stilted and melodramatic.  However, when Paula finds her humanity Blair is up to the task and puts in a competent performance.

The other players put in memorable performances as well, and even though it becomes obvious Jordan's plan is doomed, there are plenty of twists and turns along the way, right up to the last second of the show.  Film quality is remarkably good, and the cinematography is better than average for a film with lesser known talent.

In summary, I give this 'B movie' an 'A minus.'  Any film noir aficionado will enjoy this raw, gritty contribution to the genre.",1481328000,5,1677,4.757785467128028
8446210,4,B004X63RP2,"A forgotten noir gem with all of the classic elements: ruthless criminal smacking people around, sexy femme fatale, sniveling underlings, clean cut hero. This has somehow been underappreciated by noir film scholars and writers. The print is excellent. It looks like it was filmed yesterday.",1480118400,6,290,5.466666666666667
