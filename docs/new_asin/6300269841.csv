289606,3,6300269841,"This movie is so outrageously terrible that it's actually good! There's lots of nostalgia in it for me. I saw this film when it first came out, during my junior year in high school (1975). I've always been a huge crime history buff, especially the history of Jewish gangsters of the first half of the 20th century**. I hadn't seen ""Lepke"" for almost 25 years after that first viewing. I was quick to snap up a copy when I found out that it was available on VHS. I still enjoy it to this day.

Among the worst--oops, I mean BEST!--offenders are the are totally over-the-top shoot-out scenes, especially (as another reviewer points out) at Coney Island. The most hilarious part of that gunfight is when one shooter manages to ride standing up in a moving bumper-car, all the while with his tommy gun blazing! (you had to wonder who was steering or pressing the accelerator pedal!). Another example is the unbelievably corny ethnic culinary stereotypes. Whenever the Italian gang (under Lucky Luciano) sits down to eat, they are served nothing but endless spaghetti and red wine. Likewise, whenever it's ""nosh-time"" for the Jewish mobsters (led by Lepke), there's nothing on the menu but bagels!

As the other reviewer pointed out, the film also plays fast and loose with the truth. Many of the scenes seem to be cut from whole cloth. A few years ago, I posted on IMDB a list of some of the most ridiculous ones (yes, I actually do have a life also, but thanks for asking!). If you're interested, you can find my list in ""goofs"" section of the IMDB page for this movie.

Still, I must say in fairness that the film did have some outstanding performances. Unfortunately, they were overshadowed by the uniformly terrible writing. Tony Curtis, as always, was excellent. His expertly-uttered Yiddishisms (e.g., ""they're all ganefs!""), facial expressions, and temper outbursts alone almost make the whole thing worthwhile. Some of the lesser players also deserve recognition for doing a great job with some really poor material. These include Michael Callan as attorney Robert Kane, and the lovely and highly underrated Anjanette Comer as the long-suffering Mrs. Lepke. And very special kudos should go to superb cameos: Milton Berle as the no-nonsense father-in-law-to-be, and the tragic and very unappreciated Vaughn Meador as Walter Winchell. On the so-bad-they're-good side of the cast are the laughably cheesy performances by Vic Tayback as Lucky Luciano, and, worst if all, by Gianni Russo (famous for playing the lowlife son-in-law in ""The Godfather"") as Albert Anastasia. It seems that these two otherwise-decent actors were in a competition to see who could out-ham the other.

In summary, this movie's terrible script overshadows some pretty good acting. As drama, it rates one star at best. Strangely, that same awfulness gives the film its entertainment value. In that regard, it's worth four stars. Putting some weight on the latter, I give this film an overall rating of three stars. It's a comedy that wasn't intended to be funny.  This film is definitely worth a look . . . as long as you know what to expect.

(By the way, I have to throw in this bit of useless trivia: One of the principal writers of the horrendous script is Tamar Simon Hoffs, mother of the beautiful and very talented Susanna Hoffs of The Bangles.)

** For those interested in reading some really good (and entertaining) accurate histories on the subject of Lepke, Murder Incorporated, and Jewish NY gangsters of the period, I highly recommend: ""Lepke"" by Paul Kavieff; ""But He Was Good to His Mother"" by Robert Rockaway; and ""Tough Jews"" by Rich Cohen.",1382918400,,3669,4.965798045602606

289610,1,6300269841,"Agreed! This movie is awful. Tony Curtis is awful (even though he's become famous as an actor and has even been nominated for an academy award (for another movie), he really isn't much more than a high school play grade actor) along with 99% of the other performers in this dog. The made up story/facts... also awful. If you do watch it, you won't be able to believe how cornball the gun battles are, especially the one in the amusement park. As a work of art, this is 180 degrees from ""The Godfather"", which as we all know was excellent (and it also made up stories and facts... but did so exceptionally well).

I would predict that virtually anyone that watches this will feel they've wasted their time and come away quite disappointed.

I'm the type that believes film critics are way too negative most of the time, but this movie deserves a thumbs-down for certain.",1284595200,,869,4.564102564102564

289612,4,6300269841,"This Depression Era gangster pic packs a real punch.  This stylishly exciting movie keeps your attention throughout.  It lacks the artistry of ""The Godfather"" but more than holds it's own.  Tony Curtis as Louis ""Lepke"" Buchalter, murderer, businessman, loving husband, gives a credible performance here.  Also noteworthy is an effective dramatic turn by Milton Berle as Lepke's Orthodox Jewish father-in-law.  This film should be seen in conjunction with ""Murder Inc."" that featured a chilling turn by Peter Falk as Abe ""Kid Twist"" Reles, Lepke's enforcer.  Reles is only given perfunctory mention here.",1249776000,7,603,5.5

7807995,4,6300269841,"For those of us who are gangster movie lovers, this is a better than average film.  The cast is very good, Curtis plays a nasty sob as Lepke was,
and lots of machinegun (Chicago typewriter!) action.  Rather gory at times and had some strong language that makes it even more realistic.  And
a rather gruesome ending: I would love to say what happened, but some folks think I reveal too much in some of my other reviews so I will be still.
Warner Bros, who pioneered the gangster movies, released this but it was apparently produced independently by the people Golan and Globus
before they had their own company.  Anyhow, it was filmed at the Culver City Studios that at one time was MGM but I think this lot (what was left
of it) was owned by WB.  Today Culver studios is owned by Sony Pictures and it is rather small, some 44 acres.
  Some of the street action scenes reminds me of very similar happenings in the original Untouchables.  No Ness though, to save the world.  There
was even a bit of mush with Curtis and a woman for those who like such stuff (I did) and the overall production quality as well as the background
music themes were very well done.  The price of this DVD is  very good, and the quality of the picture excellent.  I got mine from Amazon.  I give
it 4 stars only because of some gruesome scenes and subjects, but for us gangsteroids this is a good investment.  They even plugged a WB
movie with you-know-who from Casablanca!!!  Enjoy  and NO  Dr. Sweets!!",1439510400,,1480,4.4222222222222225

7807998,5,6300269841,"I saw this one when it was released to the theaters. I enjoyed the movie very much since i'm a big gangster movie fan. Prior to the sixties Tony Curtis made some great movies like Houdini, The Ira Hayes Story, The Great Impostor and more. Unfortunately during the sixties he was caught up making some very stupid romantic sex comedies. His role in The Boston Strangler was great but by that time he had lost his audience. He turned in a great performance in Lepke but it was to late for him. If you enjoy gangster movies then this is a great one to own.",1428278400,,553,4.276190476190476
7807999,4,6300269841,"Interesting movie about biographical drama about Louis ""Lepke"" Buchalter a real life mobster who began as a juvenile delinquent punk and rose through the ranks of gangsters in the 1930's in New York City to head up Murder Inc. He was a dichotomy - a devoted Jewish family man who treated murder-for-hire contracts and cold-blooded killings as just another business. Lepke was eventually convicted and executed. The movie is worth buying and watching to view the execution scene. Tony Curtis does a good job of portraying the mob boss Lepke.",1414972800,,540,5.011111111111111

7808001,4,6300269841,Acting is outstanding. It was reasonably close to the truth. Curtis was a good choice to play the part. Lepke had the unfortunate distinction of being the only high ranking mob boss to be executed. He was also unusual because he wasn't an Italian American.,1384560000,,256,4.711111111111111
