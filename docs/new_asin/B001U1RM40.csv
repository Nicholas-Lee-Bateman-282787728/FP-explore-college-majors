3795446,3,B001U1RM40,"""Personal Effects"" deals with a very heavy subject ... grieving people dealing with the violent deaths of loved ones. After his sister's brutal rape and murder, Walter (Ashton Kutcher) gives up his promising wrestling career in order to care for his family and monitor the case of his sister's alleged killer. Through a support group, he meets Linda, (Michelle Pfeiffer)a widow grieving her husband's violent death, and the two become closer when the trials of their loved ones' killers are running concurrently. Kutcher's relationship with Pfeiffer grows from platonic to romantic, and Kutcher also takes an interest in Linda's angry, troubled, deaf son Clay.

After ""Spread,"" ""Personal Effects"" is the second film I've seen recently that casts Ashton Kutcher as a dramatic lead. Like in ""Spread,"" Kutcher is paired with an older, more seasoned actress, and in both cases, this mostly just makes obvious how feather-light Kutcher's presence really is. Kutcher and Pfeiffer have a smidgen of chemistry, and despite their 20 year age difference, Pfeiffer is still so beautiful that there's no doubt that even pretty boy Kutcher would find her attractive. But Pfeiffer is such a far superior actor that Kutcher seems wooden by comparison. It's clear Kutcher is going for subtle and stoic, but the result is, unfortunately, somewhat vapid.

Also adding considerably superior acting chops to the film is Kathy Bates, who plays Walter's mother, Gloria, mourning the death of her daughter and caring for her grandchild. Once again, Bates' gravitas make Kutcher seem like an amateur in comparison.

By casting a stronger actor in the lead (Ryan Gosling or Joseph Gordon-Levitt come to mind), this could have been a much better film. Until his acting improves, Kutcher should stick with goofy comedy and prank shows.",1282521600,6,1808,5.227586206896552
3795447,3,B001U1RM40,"For the excellent actors, the money was somewhat disappointing.

3795448,5,B001U1RM40,"A friend gave me this movie. I didn't know what to expect. I was surprisingly surprised. I think Ashton did a wonderful job. Actually, the whole cast was great. Having lost a family member to a brutal death, I could relate to Ashton's character and felt he expressed my pain perfectly. The exploration of grief from different angles was well written. I hope to see Ashton in more movies where he can show how he has grown as an actor.",1271462400,2,434,4.4375
3795449,4,B001U1RM40,"This is a powerful story about loss of people close to us and overwhelming power of grief that can alter course of anyone's life.  Walter is a young man in college whose twin sister is brutally murdered.  Laura's husband was shot to death by his friend and she is left to care for her deaf teenage son on her own.  Both walter and laura belong to different generations and lifestyles, but mutual loss of their loved ones binds them together.

For anyone who believes that pain is necessary part of life, while suffering is optional one has to wonder if they have experienced grief of a loved one that can take over life of any individual.  This is a powerful story about two people who find that their loss and love for each other is a way to their own emotional salvation.

Ashton Kutcher and Michelle Pfeiffer make perfect duo for their roles.  It is easy to imagine a young 24-year old man falling for an older woman as beautiful as Laura.  Kathy Bates who plays Walter's mother is absolutely amazing in her role of a grieving mother.",1257292800,5,1037,4.4787234042553195
3795450,5,B001U1RM40,"I was pleasantly surprised with this movie.  The characters were well developed and the performances were well above my expectations.  Michelle Pfeiffer played her role with a gentleness and vulnerability that I have rarely seen from her and Ashton Kutcher was perfect in his portrayal of a young man trying to deal with loss...and guilt.

The film tells the story of two families attempting to come to terms with the deaths of significant family members - a father and a sister.  And it portrays the various ways we have as humans of trying to cope with the loss that results from death.

The relationships that arise from the attempts to deal with the losses are what makes this story so very precious.  I am always surprised at what grows out of grief (based on personal experience) despite the tears and heartache.  The emptiness left by our loved ones departure is an emptiness that awaits the arrival of something or someone new...if we only let it.

Great movie, great perfomances, well written script and a tough subject served well by a finely crafted piece of cinematic art.",1253318400,13,1084,4.790322580645161
3795451,5,B001U1RM40,"This movie was a great surprise.  I did not know what to expect and ended up loving it.  It is like a small indie flick but it stars three well-known actors:  Michelle Pfeiffer, Kathy Bates, and Ashton Kutcher.  I was surprised by what a good actor Ashton Kutcher is.

The movie starts out with a group of people meeting together in a grief support group.  Ashton Kutcher's sister has been murdered and Michelle Pfeiffer's husband has been murdered.  Kathy Bates plays Ashton Kutcher's mother.  Michelle Pfeiffer has a teen-aged son who is deaf.  Ashton Kutcher had the potential to be a nationally recognized wrestler prior to his sister's murder.  After her murder, he returns home to be with his mother and to watch the trial.  He reaches out to Michelle Pfeiffer's son by getting him involved in wrestling.  Gradually, Ashton Kutcher and Michelle Pfeiffer become attracted to each other and begin a relationship that is poignantly sweet and deep.

I highly recommend this movie.  It's a gem.",1251158400,29,995,4.880239520958084
3795452,4,B001U1RM40,"Had not heard a thing about his title and it received little to no support for distribution. Part of my higher rating is that it falls into the non self absorbed category containing several A-list actors, and is a great film.

A long story of good people suffering through different levels of anger, depression, retribution, loss, and in the end trying to find some semblance of living a decent life. What makes this movie watchable is the film quality and style; A great deal of close-ups, panoramic focuses, and slow-motion with zooms - all whilst looking incredible on Blu. Each main actor performed believably, but especially the deaf newcomer (playing a deaf teen) Spencer Hudson who shows some wonderful depth.

The filming locations and city-scapes in Canada looked flawless. A good deal of effort was obviously put into making this look clear, professional and meticulously framed. This writer/director's freshman piece was preserved excellently, and looks especially pristine in Blu; excellent start. The DTS gets used primarily with the music, as 99% of this film is dialogue. The blue tint, gloomy weather and dark clothing are prevalent throughout, but the yellow chicken suit and wedding scenes give some vibrancy occasionally. I just have to mention again that the clarity is awesome...wow.

Customers have watched it playing in the store and appear quite surprised by the film. For me, this is Ashton's best film and performance to date, so hopefully the haters will take a rest and give this a chance. I have seen the same reaction here that I read about elsewhere in people saying how bad this is because of Mr. Demi, but I think of this as an owner for the Michelle and Ash fans, and a renter for the Kathy Bates group.

I had to ding one star because this is a classic role model for how not to do a behind the scenes piece. It runs 19 minutes and contains 11 minutes of long takes from the film. I just watched two hours of gloom, I do not feel like watching it again right after to learn about how they got there. The remainder is mostly about how great everyone is, so hopefully the filmmaker has learned that Blu has the capability to hold lots of material, so make it worthwhile next time. No other features.",1241913600,9,2232,4.730077120822622
3795453,4,B001U1RM40,"PERSONAL EFFECTS is a solid little film written by director David Hollander and the fine novelist Rick Moody.  The premise is a study of how the traumatic deaths of people affect those left behind. The story is well told, allows the audience to explore the group therapy approach offered to families of violently killed people - the various means of responding to loss, the differing reactions from those who cannot let go of the hate they have for losing a loved one, and introduces an interesting concept of having one of the characters who narrates the film be a deaf mute young man!

Gloria (Kathy Bates) is the mother of twins - the girl was been brutalized and murdered and the boy Andrew (Ashton Kuchter) has left his career as a wrestler to return to the scene of the crime to mourn his sister and to demand the perpetrator be convicted and imprisoned: his career has been put on hold and he ekes out a living dressed as a chicken for a fast food chicken restaurant.  During the ongoing twin's trial, Andrew meets  Linda (Michelle Pfeiffer) whose alcoholic husband has been killed and she is left to support her teenage deaf mute son Clay (Spencer Hudson). Through series of grieving meetings and periods of isolation on the part of each of the characters, each finds ways to support the other and a love affair develops between the older Linda and the younger Andrew as he agrees to accompany her to her various weddings for which she serves a planner.  How  these characters comes to grips with resolution of their losses is well tied together by film's end.

This is not a great movie, but the performances by the leads are quite fine. This is a movie with a message, one that delves into territory with which many are not familiar, and for that reason alone it is well worth watching.  Grady Harp, March 09",1236211200,22,1818,4.589506172839506

3795531,5,B001U1RM40,"Ashton Kutcher does an award deserving performance in his ""big"" movie about Steve Jobs, but in Personal Effects he offers his most sensitive and appealing performance with Kathy Bates as his mother and Michelle Pfeiffer as an older woman with a seriously handicapped son who he meets at a crisis group of people who have lost loved ones to murder.  The relationship with an older woman echoes Kutcher's real life experience, but I regard it as an irrelevant coincidence.  The University of Iowa connection is relevant, if only because Kutcher arranged screenings to benefit flood victims in Iowa City and his home town of Cedar Rapids.  This is a small and intimate film, Sundance sort of stuff.  Rather than dominating fellow inventors and employees, Kutcher's character finds personal redemption in the last shot (which is a loving smile on Pfeiffer's face).",1474243200,3,860,5.078014184397163

So many emotional spots in this film, it was definitely hard to watch at some small moments, but it was also definitely worth it.  I'm actually in awe right now and that is a really great feeling given the awful movies I forced myself to sit through before this one!

The movie starts out in such a way that you THINK you have some sort of idea as to the ""why"" of the opening scene after you have watched the movie for a bit, but you end up being so wrong by the end! I was shocked and that doesn't happen very often.  The last 10 minutes or so of the film have so many tiny twists and turns and emotions that it almost left me breathless for a few minutes.  You have a moment of ""no way"" and then just as quickly a moment of ""thank goodness"" and then another moment of ""no way"" and so forth.  It's almost dizzying. It truly is incredible how things tie together and open up through the last quarter of the film and allow you to gradually knit the puzzle in your head, instead of figuring it out at the first beat, which I have a tendency to do. I love it when it gives me shock value and tugs at my heart strings at the same time!",1436572800,,1216,4.041666666666667

As one who lost someone close, almost 7 years ago, I didn't realize that a part of me was waiting for them to come back.  This film touches on a part of simple humanity that doesn't understand when someone dies.  We live in this world that is so real.  It stays real when real people leave.  It's hard to balance the new reality with the past.  We get so used to their presence, we grow accustomed to it.  When they leave, we don't KNOW where they go.  We are still here.  Where are they?  Just not here, and there is nothing we can do until it is our time to leave.  So many emotions connected to their leaving and our still being here.

Here he is, a 24 year old successful athlete, with good lucks, etc. but unprepared for an ugly visitor like ""murder"" in his family.  His feelings are locked up in his stiff body.  Although he is portraying a lot of depth if you really watch him. He relies on all of his old coping mechanisms to deal with it (running, working out, even sex) but ulimately can't escape his feelings. I have seen many people look like that after a death.

Clay also added an interesting twist to this plot. He is perceptive in many ways, but due to his deafness just doesn't get the whole picture. Like all of the characters, they are all wrapped up in their own lives, their own grief while trying to love those around them. Sometimes succeeding and sometimes not.

Sure, it could happen, but why glorify it? So these two characters who, based on the actors that portray them, are drop dead gorgeous can't attract a member of the opposite sex within 20 years of their own ages? Yeah, right. At first I thought the relationship between the two was going to be just as friends, supporting each other through their respective hardships. But as soon as Pfeiffer's character uttered the all-time classic BS line ""I need you to go with me to this function but it's not a date,"" I knew right then where this story was going--straight to a bedroom.

To see  seasoned, skilled actors like Michelle Pfeiffer, Kathy Bates, and  Ashton Kutcher in these character roles made  it worth the watch.",1511049600,4,401,4.753623188405797
8342598,5,B001U1RM40,"Ashton Kutcher and Michelle Pfeiffer really deliver in this story about love and family. It's a story, and I love stories. I like a movie that captures me and draws me near. Not 100% action movies--although they have their appeal also. Bravo Ashton, Michelle and Spencer Hudson-- you were really good as well!",1510704000,,309,4.849056603773585
8342599,5,B001U1RM40,"If you are unable to understand the appeal of this movie, I would think you would be ashamed to admit it. The best part is, the ending. The second best part is; the acting. Nothing wrong with the directing, either. There isn't a wasted scene in it. It's a tight ship, this movie is. I totally enjoyed it.",1509667200,,304,4.258620689655173
8342600,2,B001U1RM40,"With three superstars like Kathy Bates, Michelle Pfeiffer and Aston Kutcher I thought this movie would be awesome, but, it's not. Despite phenomenal acting this movie just tries to hard and reeks of weak, uninteresting and incessantly droll dialogue. This movie is a true waste of time!",1509408000,,286,5.1063829787234045
