3904806,5,B002C7ELWW,wonderfully great !!! love walter goggins  in anything very versatile actor so is ray McKinnon story line was unique and funny,1409011200,,126,5.0
3904807,5,B002C7ELWW,I have always been a Ray McKinnon fan but this was so much better than I even expected. The cast is wonderful. I hope he starts making comedies again soon.,1399420800,,155,4.2
3904808,3,B002C7ELWW,"I won't go into to much detail on this movie simply because it is all right, not great and not terrible. It is a fun little watch that if you have some time and just want to enjoy a cute little movie, well, this could be it. Cute story capable actors.",1394496000,,251,3.9411764705882355
3904809,5,B002C7ELWW,Ray McKinnon is a genius. Anything he even remotely touches is gold. If you like this movie I highly recommend The Accountant.,1375920000,,126,4.7727272727272725
3904810,4,B002C7ELWW,My husband loved this movie! It was very funny and we've actually loaned it out to friends to watch. They too loved it!,1369699200,,119,4.217391304347826
3904811,4,B002C7ELWW,"I turned if off the first time after at the 20 minutes mark. A few days later I restarted (mover forward a few minutes perhaps). This turned out to be a very good quirky small budget comedy. Props to the writer, for such a complicated script, especially in the area of the protagonist and antagonist switch several times. The movie is character driven instead of plot driven (as most comedies are plot driven).The movie makes redemption possible for just about everyone involved in the story. Im glad I watched this it is a clinic for writers (im sure there are lessons for aspiring director and actors, etc as well because it is a fine movie). If you look odd but not over the top odd comedies wathc this but be warned the beginning is intentionally slow.",1259884800,4,756,4.5661764705882355
3904812,4,B002C7ELWW,Quirky southern movie.  Along the lines of Napoleon Dynamite in the sense you need to watch it a couple of times to get it.  Great acting by both Ray and Walt.  The boy who plays Ray's son is a real cutie.,1254614400,3,205,3.951219512195122
3904813,3,B002C7ELWW,"This was a cute, insightful drama about man named Randy who in order to impress his wife, goes into debt with the mob. The mobsters come for him when he is unable to make good the loan, sending a very odd mobster named Tino to claim the debt. Tino is funny at first, but after awhile I found him someone annoying and overdone.

I did think Randy's gay brother was very well done, and so were the other mobsters. While I wouldn't watch this one again, I still found it amusing enough.

3 stars.",1253145600,3,493,4.23404255319149
3904814,4,B002C7ELWW,"A very obscure Southern comedy that comes with a unique set of quirks, humor and a Burt Reynolds cameo. I was initially put off by an over-the-top feel in some of the physical schtick scenes, and coupled with Walter Goggins' Sling Blade persona I thought about quitting, but by the end I actually liked this film.

This is the same crew that made and starred in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chrystal/dp/B0009PVZSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chrystal</a>, except they wanted to do a comedy this time. The story follows a middle class Georgian business owner who has accumulated some serious debt he owes to a loan shark. Instead of killing him, they decide to send in their accountant, excellently played by Goggins, to facilitate an operation of repayment. Instead of things going as planned, the accountant creates a whole new chain of unlikely events that affects everyone involved. Writer, director and dual star (plays twin brothers) Ray McKinnon is fun to watch, and manages to make an interesting little dark comedy that I think will get skipped over. Burt Reynolds has only one sequence but it was worth watching it for that alone.

The sound is good, the picture is great and the only supplement is a solid piece on the production/making of. I liked seeing how involved Goggins was with the film, and I have a new respect for him as I only knew him from being my least favorite character in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shield-Season-Seven-The-Final-Act/dp/B0020TS5EM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shield: Season Seven - The Final Act</a>. The supporting cast was fun to watch, each with their own little Southern nuances, and I would actually watch this again. It is playable in the store since they actually made this presentable for all ages at a PG rating. Hope you enjoy.

Edit: Forgot one little tidbit, should you actually be looking for a Labor Day weekend film, part of the film contains a LD & Thanksgiving holidays theme (takes place during those two weekends).",1251676800,3,2081,5.456521739130435
3904815,3,B002C7ELWW,"""Gentle southern charm"" comes to mind -- funny (if you ""get it"") and with a subtle message.  Nothing hits you over the head, no explosions, no F-bombs, just a nice ""feel good"" fun movie.  We loved it.  Safe to watch with your Momma.",1249948800,5,232,4.348837209302325
8363479,5,B002C7ELWW,"This is a pleasant comedy with good actors, good acting, and good-enough writing. Ray McKinnon struggles to make this more than just a slapstick comendy, - which it easily could have been - and have characters whose decisions and feelings mean something. He succeeds. It is funny and it is also a tale of wildly different brothers who must live uneasily with a business and personal relationship.

Walter Goggins is very good but he's given a difficult role: he must play an enigmatic character. His Tino is very mysterious. He has the best line in the entire film: 'Never trust a man in a teal pant suit.' It is said in the film's trailer but you really appreciate it in the context of the film's plot. My other favorite line comes from the young son of the family who says, 'I hope to someday'; again, the context is important.

The setting, a small Southern town, is perfect. You want to go there. It's slow-paced, it's spacious and claustrophobic at the same time.

I enjoyed the film. I will probably watch it again. And the scene at the dump - pure gold!",1525132800,,1060,4.539267015706806
8363480,1,B002C7ELWW,Absolutely terrible movie. Poorly made and unbelievably not funny.,1513900800,,66,6.444444444444445

8363482,5,B002C7ELWW,great cast and Walton goggins shows he can do it all as an actor as well as ray mckinnon,1510704000,,88,3.6842105263157894
8363483,3,B002C7ELWW,Maybe another word for his flick is corny. The movie wasn't a total waste but it won't be winning any awards.  I was hoping to laugh but this never quite got there. It's advertised as a comedy but the jokes on us who rent it.,1506643200,,225,4.0
8363484,3,B002C7ELWW,"okay, good in parts, fun premise.
 Awful insensitive backward portrayal of gay brother. writers should be ashamed of themselves.",1505606400,,128,5.7368421052631575
8363485,3,B002C7ELWW,"If you are bored and alone this will help pass the time, if not, I'd recommend a better movie.",1505347200,,94,4.0
8363486,5,B002C7ELWW,"I recommend this funny film. The second viewing is very, very funny with knowledge of the joke setup and the quick cameo appearances easily missed on a first run. The family and cameo actors deliver jokes but when you really know the whole story of the film their jokes are funnier. The landfill scene is over the top for ""no-potty humor"" types but I loved it. Writing this review, I am laughing thinking of the scene. I laughed at the story of a guy pretending to be a tough. His world crashes down because he is an obvious fake. My take is this guy just has to learn to be an un-obvious fake. This seems to be the overall punchline; so timely these days. Seriously, the film is a delight from the first note to the last. Ray McKinnon is awesome as the film's director and lead actor. cheers Ray!",1503446400,,797,4.32

8363488,5,B002C7ELWW,"I love Walton Goggins.  I'd watch him clip his toenails or read the phonebook.  Fortunately, this movie was both clever and enjoyable for my husband who isn't nearly so enamored of Walt as I am.",1445299200,4,194,4.514285714285714
