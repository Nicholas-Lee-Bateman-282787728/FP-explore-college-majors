It gives a very good idea of the difficult life of the afro-american population in the
Cuba of the 19th century.",1470960000,,200,4.4324324324324325

8267660,5,B0017WI5NO,I love this movie. It is on the same level as Quilombo in showing the resistance and self sufficiency of Africans who were forcibly brought to the Western Hemisphere by slave traders. It is refreshing to see the Afro-Cubans history highlighted from a historical viewpoint that shows how they fought to maintain their own freedom.,1236556800,4,329,5.0
