7846628,1,630344461X,This came to me (VHS) broken so my daughter and I never got the chance to watch it. I tried to tape it up but it looked like it had been stomped on and almost messed up my machine. Too bad as I remember watching magic school bus as a child and wanted to share the experience with my kiddo.,1384992000,,289,3.8333333333333335
7846629,5,630344461X,"Yep, I ""borrowed"" the title. This really is a good one! I can't get over the amount of info they fit into this story! MY kids (ages 4 & 8) don't really follow the news cast line, but they love seeing the inside of their bloodstream, throat, etc. They watch this over and over..... My Mom even liked it enough to ask for her own copy!",1127520000,3,333,4.0606060606060606
