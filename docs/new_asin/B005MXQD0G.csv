4839002,4,B005MXQD0G,"The performance is fine, but beware:  it's a 4:3 screen ratio with a slightly grainy picture and only a stereo mix.  Still, it's nice document of one of the best Allman Brothers Band lineups that should have been released in its proper form (without cutting into songs for interviews) on DVD years ago.",1392854400,9,302,4.679245283018868

4839004,5,B005MXQD0G,"Take it from someone who was there, this was another excellent performance by the Allman Brothers Band. I was not aware that this concert was recorded until I recently noticed it on Amazon. This show was recorded for a Japanese television documentary in SD, (after all it was 1991). Despite it being recorded in SD the video & sound quality is very good. This concert is where Warren Haynes, Allen Woody, & Marc Quinones were still relatively new members of the band promoting the ""Shades of Two Worlds"" album, from which they performed only two songs, ""End of the Line,"" & ""Get On With Your Life."" In the rest of the 80 minute set they played some of their best known classics, beginning with ""Statesboro Blues,"" & ending the show with another great version of Gregg Allman growling out ""Whipping Post.""
This DVD is the show & not the documentary, it's just the Allman Brothers doing what they do best.",1497484800,4,903,4.65

4839006,5,B005MXQD0G,I bought this one based on the opinions of the fans who said to get it because of Dickie Betts still being in the band. They were right and I strongly recommend this. Excellent! i,1488067200,,179,4.142857142857143

4839017,5,B005MXQD0G,"I have wanted this show for many years and it finally became availeable again so I jumped on it. I do wish that there had not been quite as much editing as there appears to be. Other than that, it is a good DVD. They were not at thier absolute best, in my opinion but any Allman Bros. show with that line-up before things came apart would be a good listen. From the mouths of the band members themselves, Dicky's performances went from great to wanting him gone which they eventual did invite him to leave the band. Since Allan Woody passed away and without Dicky, they are not the Allman Bros. I have allways been a huge fan of, particularly since we saw them live in May of 1971. They were absolutely the best band ever, bar none. The best part was running into Duane after the show !!! I will remember that for the rest of my life. It hit me quite hard when he was tragically taken from us just 5 months later, almost to the day. I learned a great deal from that genious of a man !!",1436140800,,985,4.135416666666667

4839020,5,B005MXQD0G,"Really like this performance the best of 3 ABB concert DVD's I ordered. (the other two are @ Beacon). I like this lineup the best. This show feels more authentically Allman Brothers than the Beacon DVDs. Once you take Dickey Betts out of the mix it's not the same band. Love him or hate him his contribution to the song writing and to the sound are unmistakable. Warren Haynes plays with a fresh young energy on this DVD. Great show and DVD, you can go wrong ordering this one.",1432425600,,477,4.370786516853933

4839028,5,B005MXQD0G,"ok, so the video is NOT modern HD quality, after all it IS 1991...BUT, the boys sound GREAT.  Warren had just joined the band and is like a wild stallion eager to jump out of his holding pen !  Gregg is in GREAT voice, and Woody, Butch and Jaimo all are at the top of their game.  But the stand out for me at least, is Dickey's playing.  He was definitely peaking on this night.  Played with abandon, played with passion, never missed a beat OR a note and the concert was a fantastic moment in time for the Brers...the audio mix, even by today's standards, is perfect...buy it and watch it with a good sound system.",1418083200,4,615,4.222222222222222

4839033,5,B005MXQD0G,"Top notch performance.  No frills DVD, they come out, they play, they melt faces. I'm sure some uber-fan has done a song by song review. I'll just say if you love the Bros, this one is as good as any.",1400371200,,200,4.0
4839034,5,B005MXQD0G,"Previously-issued versions of this DVD were shortened and the music was interrupted by interviews. Finally they have released the original longform video version of the concert, which was previously only available on VHS and Laserdisc. I watched it for the first time last night, and it is a great concert. It lasts for 90 minutes, and there are no interruptions to the concert footage.

Filmed in Massachusetts in 1991 in front of 20,000 fans (who seem to be nearly all men for some reason!), this concert was originally recorded for Japanese TV. It features one of the great line-ups of the Allman Brothers Band, with both Dickie Betts and Warren Haynes on lead guitars. Warren is also a great asset because of his vocals,  particularly when he teams up with Greg, as their voices blend together so well. The line-up also includes Marc Quinones on percussion, and he was a tremendous addition to the band. One of the great things about this video is that it is nice to watch the Allmans playing so many of Dickie Betts' songs.

This is turning out to be a good year for Allmans fans, with this release as well as the '40th Anniversary Concert', which I haven't seen yet. Finally, I would just stress the caveat that others have made. Be sure you order the 2014 issue (with the  blue and white date sticker on the front), because older versions of this DVD are inferior.",1400112000,2,1371,4.652892561983471
4839035,4,B005MXQD0G,"This is a spectaclar concert with the band in fine form. I had this on VHS years ago. I had hoped the audio would have been better and include a 5.1 mix however it does not, in fact it is only 48 kHz.
The picture is greatly improved compared to the VHS version with the stage view far superior and a lot sharper.
What impresses me with this concert is how well Dicky Betts plays, the guys loving being there and is on the top of his game. This is at a time when the band had re-emerged in the late 1980s with a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of new songs.
The song selection is also well thought out with old and new songs all played brilliantly.
Its just a real shame they didn't improve the audio on this, another reviewer commented the lack of bass, I must agree the bass is not blasting through my JBL speaker system as I was hoping.

Great concert, a good document of the band in peak form in 1991.",1399680000,3,900,4.056179775280899
4839036,5,B005MXQD0G,"Great set and Great performance. Now the full vhs version on dvd. Not the complete concert, but longer than the first dvd version.
Dickey and Warren at their best. A must for ABB and music fans.",1399161600,,194,4.416666666666667
4839037,5,B005MXQD0G,"An extremely fine performance by the ABB! The interplay between Dickie, Greggory and Warren was fantastic. Especially since Warren had not been with the band all that long.....well worth it!!",1398470400,,191,5.4
4839038,3,B005MXQD0G,"It's in mono but the sound and video quality are OK.  It's DVD quality video.  The music and video are in sync.  There are no video extras.  It's a short DVD case but the graphics are well done.  It is a seamless video with no recording glitches.  There is a mixture of 11 songs about 80 minutes long with traditional ABB and some odd so-so music filler stuff.  The traditional music deviates considerably from well known album recordings but that is what ABB is about.  It is a 1991 recording made for Japan but it's in English.  Betts is there and a brand new, rather rough, Haynes on guitar.  I lost count of all the drummers.  They sounded great.  The bass was a little weak and not videoed often.  The stage is small, simple, and stuffed with the band but not detracting from the performance.  Camera panning is at a good, easy to follow, speed.  Greg A was just going through the motions but the rest of the band performed hard.  I'm happy with it but don't recommend it as your first ABB video.",1397952000,2,1001,4.358695652173913
4839039,2,B005MXQD0G,"Very poor audio. Sounds like $19.95 boom box or used camera microphone. No bass - 5 min. drum solo proves it. In another song, Butch Trucks goes to the kettle drums and once again, they sound small and flat.  Dull, flat sound.  No punch.  No 5.1.  I am using a high end 5.1 audio system and have nearly 100 DVD concerts - I know good sound.  Anyone else saying it's good simply has some limitation in their system or their hearing.  Don't waste your $$ - wait on an update.

Any excuse about this being a 1991 concert is baloney - I have Journey, Paul McCartney and other DVDs from 1980 and earlier that are top notch sound.  Good sound recording has been available since late 1960s.  Video might be more challenging but this video is good.

I did like that 8 of the 12 songs are not covered on the Live at Beacon Theatre (2011) DVD.  No other DVD that I've found has ""End of the Line"" song but this one.  The Live at Beacon Theatre (2011) DVD is very good sound - how it's supposed to be.

Don't buy it.",1397692800,2,1004,4.166666666666667
4839040,1,B005MXQD0G,This concert wasn't especially good and certainly doesn't showcase the AAB as it was during their heyday. I'm looking to sell it,1397520000,,128,4.863636363636363
4839041,4,B005MXQD0G,"Loved this concert. Great lineup with Dickey Betts' and Warren Haynes' (who was new to the band) dueling guitars. Gregg Allman was terrific as usual - as was the rest of the band. I wish they had included more songs, but I understand that would be difficult considering the size of their catalog.",1397088000,2,296,4.60377358490566

4839043,4,B005MXQD0G,This isn't a bad DVD and Gregg sounds real good vocally. It's not the Beacon though. That DVD is far superior in sound and video quality as well as jams. There is no Dickey there but Derek Trucks and Warren Haynes make up for it big time. This isn't a bad show if you want a cheaper shorter concert.

4839045,5,B005MXQD0G,"I play guitar but am really not a musician so I cannot explain why I miss the pairing of Duane and Dicky so much, I can't put it into words.  Duane brought me to tears, and my cell phone greeting is an acoustic rendition of the opening phrase of ""Blue Sky"".  This is an admirable performance and Warren Haynes carries the load, but Dicky is in command.  I've watched this about 10 times already, but I still find myself dreaming that it was March 12 &13, 1971 and that this was a DVD of ""at Fillmore East"".  So dream on because it isn't but it damn sure is the next best thing.",1396224000,3,577,4.125

4839048,5,B005MXQD0G,"Just a magnificent concert with a great set list.  The only negative is no surround sound, but that is offset by the great set list and energetic performance.  The highlight for me was the accoustic version of Midnight Rider-- exceptional.",1394841600,6,239,4.95
4839049,5,B005MXQD0G,"...that owning both versions of this dvd is exactly what Sony is hoping and that on the 1st version (after Dickey's ouster), the songs that were interrupted were Dickey's songs? Greed, spite, etc.",1393545600,5,196,4.96969696969697
4839050,5,B005MXQD0G,"Although I could gripe and complain about the video quality and no 5.1... Those things don't matter WOW what a magnificent performance... The whole show is a highlight reel and brings yet another spectacular performance that I have come to expect from the ABB. Just an amazing live band ... Top notch musicians delivering the goods, enjoy with your favorite beverage!! Turn it up!!!!",1393027200,10,383,5.0
4839051,5,B005MXQD0G,"This is a great document of the Allman Brothers band of that era. While I prefer the first and latest (as of 2014) versions a bit more, this version was very close.",1392940800,,164,4.15625
4839052,4,B005MXQD0G,"When I heard that Sony would be releasing a new, fully restored and unedited version of the Allman Brothers Band's ""Live At Great Woods"" DVD I was absolutely thrilled about it, but upon picking up the actual disc and putting it into my DVD player my happiness was somewhat overshadowed by my disgust that Sony messed up once again. Don't get me wrong, the performance is fantastic (what there is of it), and the production is fine by 1991 video standards as is the audio, but where is the 5.1 surround sound mix that is available on the previous edition of this DVD, and why hasn't the video been re-mastered for HD? The aspect ratio of the video is still 4.3 and not wide screene. I feel that a lot more effort could've and should've been put into the re-release of this fantastic concert document of an amazing band at the top of their post classic era game. Sony completely dropped the ball with this one on the production end of things. So in closing, I urge you not to get rid of your old copy of the Allman Brothers Band ""Live At Great Woods"" DVD because the differences between the old and new editions are significant enough to justify keeping both versions, and even with the uninterrupted performances on the new edition, I think that the older release is slightly superior in overall quality. And finally, the original show introduction and ending with comments by Robbie Robertson are completely missing from the new DVD. Some people may not view this last as a great loss, but since it was part of the original program it should've made it on to this new edition. Revisionist history isn't my cup of tea at all, and this re-release suffers from it greatly. For example, get a load of the fake crowd noise that has been added at the beginning of most of the songs on the new edition, and how some of the brighter lighting looks slightly better on the older DVD. After reading this review should you even bother with this new DVD edition if you own the previous one? ABSOLUTELY! It's great to finally have the uninterrupted performances back as they were origionally presented on VHS and LD, but hang on to your original DVD for the 5.1 mix, the interviews and the suttle differences in the audio and video editing. Thanks for reading this review. I hope it was both helpful and informative to you as you ponder weather or not to buy this DVD. Good luck, take care and keep rockin'!",1392940800,27,2393,4.528868360277136
4839053,4,B005MXQD0G,"I had the VHS of this years ago and honestly forgot how incredibly smoking hot this performance is.  What you have here is one of the premier American bands of the last fifty years, in perhaps the best post-1975 ABB band lineup kicking musical butt on a good night. Songs from their self-titled first album, Idlewild South, At Fillmore East, Eat A Peach, Brothers and Sisters and Shades Of Two Worlds.  Here you are reminded, on grainy video, of the greatness of original members Dickey Betts,  Gregg Allman, Jaimoe and Butch Trucks, joined by the late Allen Woody, Warren Haynes and Marc Quinones. Almost every song is a highlight. I first saw them in the summer of '73 after Peach and before Brothers and lastly a fantastic performance just a couple of years ago. Highly recommend it. Its not HD (not even close), it is not the ultimate in technology, but it is a fantastic musical performance.
