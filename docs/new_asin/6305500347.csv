7891462,5,6305500347,"Being a song writer myself I could identify with this movie,being in an active band for eight years, I when thru alot of the same things that this movie cast went thru. I guess you could say ""I get it"" It was not a first class made film but it was a real film. Maybe not the best acting but I would recommend it to people who like the music thing. I thought the music genra class battle was great.",1316995200,,397,3.975
7891463,1,6305500347,"I watched this movie because Hoyt Axton was in it, listed third in the beginning credits. He was on-screen for about 60 seconds and never performed, which was an unforgiveable lapse on the part of the movie makers - he was far superior to any of the performers in the film. As a movie, it lagged, contained shallow dialog, and had a weak and predictable plot. Some of the songs were good, but overall it was an extremely disappointing film.",1277164800,,440,4.5125
7891464,5,6305500347,This is one of my all time top 10 movies. It's how a classical musician becomes unemployed and hires out to a country and western band whom he thinks is below his station. The lead singer quietly conforms him into a real live cowboy. When he finally gets rehired with the orchestra he is in a tux and as the camera scans down he is still wearing his cowboy boots. It really is a very good movie.,1207353600,5,395,4.142857142857143
7891465,3,6305500347,"Here's a rare big screen appearance by Jim Byrnes (Highlander, Wiseguy), & yep you even get some music.  He has a substanial supporting role, so if you're a fan, the movie is worth seeing.  There is very little else to recommend it.  If you're short on money, look here at Amazon.com for his music rather than this tape (Burning, & That River.)",1047772800,,344,4.516129032258065
