8563630,5,B009CDEUY8,"I find the subject of life between lives fascinating, and after having read Robert Schwartz's books, Your Soul's Plan and Your Soul's Gift, I wanted to see the extended DVD (he also has a shorter DVD called Your Soul's Plan: The Spiritual Meaning of Your Life). In the extended DVD, we get not only Robert's insights, but also the insights of Barbara Brodsky and her channeled entity, Aaron. We also get participation from the audience in the form of many thoughtful and thought-provoking questions. There is also humor in the way some information is presented, which is always a good thing, in my estimation. For example, Aaron explains the concept of a plan vs. free will as similar to an improv situation. The actors in an improv group are given fairly specific situations and characters, but within that they have a lot of free will to play out the scene. That was quite an enlightening way for me to understand this delicate balance. Another humorous insight was in regard to souls who don't learn from their plans and have to complete several lifetimes learning the same lesson over and over--they were compared to the movie Groundhog Day where Bill Murray keeps repeating his same mistakes but eventually finally learns from them and is able to move on. In any case, this is a very interesting presentation and I highly recommend it, and of course the books as well.",1420934400,,1373,4.773109243697479
