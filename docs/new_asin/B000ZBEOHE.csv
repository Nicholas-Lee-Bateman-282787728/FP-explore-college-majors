3038864,5,B000ZBEOHE,"This DVD expertly captures the many different
scenarios and complexities of the modern urban
phenomenon called ""The DL"" (Down Low) or a closeted
gay or bisexual man( usually black or latino, but not
exclusively!) who lives a dual life of sleeping with women
to keep up their public image / street cred / family ties,
etc., while secretly indulging in intimate encounters
with other men!--It's been going on for years!

Of course, these men insist on and, in some cases,
will fight you to prove that they're straight!
But it's a sad game of self-deception,
self-denial and ultimately, self-hate, which leaves
lives turned upside down when the inevitable truth comes
to the light! This series brilliantly captures all of
this through its main case studies:

Wes, the sucessful married executive who is a beautiful
man with a beautiful wife and a seemingly beautiful life that,
as we go under the surface, hides deeper inner pain and
longing which is brought bubbling to the surface when
his wife's devastingly gorgeous, manipulative and roguish
gay brother comes to stay with them for awhile to
""get on his feet""!!---That ain't all he gets on!

Then there's Robert, the handsome everyday guy who is
a sucessful talent agent who was once married and has
a college-aged daughter who lives with him who has no
clue that her dad spends his free time in gay chat rooms,
cruising guys on the internet and having secret gay liasons.
His life is turned upside down when he meets an
attractive openly gay, but not nelly, man who owns a health
store and through their budding relationship, Robert
is transformed and learns the meaning of honesty,
love and self-acceptance.

Then there's BOO--The stereotypical ""thug"",
whose hyper-masculine swagger, hip-hop era (outwardly)
homophobic attitude, sagging jeans, 3/4 timbz,
wife beater teez and exposed boxers are in sharp contrast
to what he really likes to get down in when he isn't
fighting with his hood-rat girlfreind Keisha,
who puts him out at least twice a week
or mooching off of his church-going, bible-thumping mother!
Who is the type to say she's a loving christian,
but then bashes and condemns those who aren't like
her every chance she gets!
Boo is a ""man-boy"", who though he's very much
a grown man physically, is but a child both emotionally
& mentally!--A very common occurence these days!
He accepts no responsibility for his life on any level,
thinks he has the answer between his legs to all the
world's problems, puts down gays in one breath while
sleeping with them every chance he gets!--He also cheats
with other women too!--Just the quintessential ""playa"" type.
Anywayz, this scenario plays out with alot of interesting plot
twists that will keep you laughing and oohing and ahhing!

Lastly, there's Mark and Dante, a black and latino
middle class gay couple of 3 yrs who reside in San Francisco
who are making leaps and bounds in their relationship when
they get an unexpected and uninvited visit from Mark's ol'
sorry-azz drifter no-account cousin, Terrell, who brings
baggage of all kinds with him from L.A.!!
But the guy is sooo funny too!
This story has a lot of great twists to it as well!--

Without giving everything away, this is a great series
because it is done intelligently, with humor and with great
sensitivity. It also rings true in so many ways and really
opens up understanding in those whose hearts and minds are
open and may either be in this situation or has a freind
or family member in this situation.

In the black and latino communities, there is such
an ugly and heavy stigma and homophobia
against gays that a lot of people,
thankfullly not myself, feel they have to live this
DL lifestyle just to function and remain close to the
ones they love and hold on to whatever it is that they
think they have accrued in this life.
But the truth is the light, and I hope that through
films like this that don't use stereotypes and show
gay/bi men of color as what they really are---men,
in every sense, who just, through natural selection
or fate, share a different end of the sexual spectrum
from their mainstream counterparts and deserved to be
loved and valued like any other human being
as part of the bigger human family.
Through stories like these, intelligent, respectful
and understanding dialogue can be started amongst
freinds, amongst family members, etc., to overcome
what really shouldn't be an issue anywayz!--And hey,
if they abandon you, then they didn't love you for you
anyway and should be considered good riddance
to bad rubbish! Self-Love, Self-Acceptance,
Self-Acknowledgement, etc. and living your truth will
lead to a richer and fuller life for all parties concerned...gay/bi/straight or whatever!

But, personal philosophies aside, this series
(the complete first season) is a great and
groundbreaking step in the right direction and
I can't wait to see more!
It's well worth the money to add this
to your collection!",1202256000,53,4921,4.899159663865547
3038865,5,B000ZBEOHE,"I first came across the DL Chronicles on Heretv and decided to watch it. I was hesitant as most dl chronicles demonize closeted black men but DL chronicles was different. It gave various incarnations of the ""down low"" phenomenon. The term came to reflect more hiding from oneself instead of the usual manipulation/deception of women. I definitely enjoyed every episode I saw and can't wait to see the whole series. This series, like black men, is more complex than simple stereotypes.",1201219200,2,484,4.987654320987654
3038866,5,B000ZBEOHE,"i'v been lucky to have seen several of the ""Chronicles"" at some local film festivals & i am so excited to see they will be available on DVD.  Deondray Gossett & Quincy LeNear have done an excellent job of telling the stories of black men & their sexualities, and the production quality is also amazing.  if you have any interest in the true stories of how some black men negotiate the tensions between what they are expected to be and how they really are, these ""Chronicles"" are highly recommended.",1197417600,14,498,4.584269662921348

i think it realistically displays the life of both African american gay men and also Latino american gay men that live in a different culture, i like how this show was made and how they showed different type of ""men"", if you think about it it's not just gay men or straight men its about ""men"". The different life we live, and how attraction to the different gender had nothing to do with what we are.

maybe i went a little to deep, but i like this show, if it would of lasted longer i think they could of hit on many different issue in which we all could relate to.",1415836800,,702,4.0503597122302155

3038900,5,B000ZBEOHE,"When thinking about the storylines presented in this collection of shorts, one has to ask, "" Were I in any of these situations, would I make similar decisions?"". I stay away from judging others for the choices that they make, and even though these accounts are fictional, I'm sure that someone, somewhere, is being faced with these same issues. I appreciate the opportunity for self discovery that this anthology presents. And the stories were well written, amusingly acted and the production value of the video was decent.",1396310400,,523,5.022988505747127

3038903,5,B000ZBEOHE,"I totally enjoyed this movie. I had heard so much about it but did not know where to find it.  I was glad I ran across it here.  I will be sharing it with alot of my friends.  I was impress with the candid openess in alot of the scenes.  The characters were hot especially the men. The storylines were excellent.  I still get irritated when I see scenes like the one in the garage and the ideal that they (DLs) do not think or even conceive the fact that they are gay but are willing to put down their neighbor who is openly gay.  Which one is more dangerous?  I have a problem with Bi or DL.  Be one or the other.  It's too confusing and too dangerous to play a switch hitter especially when you are dealing with women's lives. But all in all.  I really like the hot scenes and for the DL(s) that are out there.  Women are finally waking up.  A Queen trying to be a King is not for the millenium.  I would highly recommend it to alot of my gay friends especially my ""Straight Male Friends"".",1376352000,,991,4.072538860103627

3038905,5,B000ZBEOHE,"Love and lust ain't always easy to explain or navigate, but this series gave us a glimpse of what could be happening with a bit of understanding why.  Nothing is cut and dry when it comes to relationships whether sexual or romantic and it gives one pause after watching this series.

The men are all very handsome and the writing is decent.  It is an enjoyable series.  I purchased the series to help me with a paper I am writing on the phenomenon.  It has helped to bring visual aid to the reading I have completed so far.",1274140800,,406,4.153846153846154
3038912,4,B000ZBEOHE,"Of the Afro-Americans still rarely Hollywood presents works not filled if even in comedies, with gun-drugs gang-murdering actions.

It is simply nice to watch something different from clich of steady anti-social activities while San-Francisco lads direct their urges in different direction.

3038914,5,B000ZBEOHE,"Why do all ads for this refer to it as ""The Complete First Season""?
First season???  Hell, its the ONLY damn season!  Makes no damn
sense, either.  Unlike some of the previous reviewers who apparently
sought out the show looking for a life changing experience, I merely
was looking to be entertained....and I was.  It was great to just
see gay MOC interacting with each other period, since you are more
likely to see the Loch Ness Monster on a reality date with Bigfoot,
on TV first.  However, that, sadly is also why there are only four
episodes of The DL C, while series such as Queer as Folk have gone for
many full-fledged (not some paltry 4 episodes) seasons.  I assume
MOC into each other, and not pursuing White men is a no no.  I guess
they don't even want the mere thought that MOC can actually p-r-e-f-e-r
each other, to even enter the public consciousness.  Trust me, if there
were an abundance of White men being chased on The DL C, there would
be 5 times as many episodes produced by now.  Same reasoning applies
to Noah's Arc.  If Noah and crew had been all hugged up on White guys,
it would still be on the air too.
The Complete First Season.....indeed.  Here is a clue:

In order to properly quantify as a ""First"" season.....there needs to be
subsequent seasons to follow, or at l-e-a-s-t a second damn season.",1248912000,2,1326,4.45643153526971
3038915,1,B000ZBEOHE,"I think unsuspecting people should be aware that this series is NO Noah's ARC.  I'm not talking about the stories.  I was very aware of what this series was about before I saw it.  I read all the reviews.  And like Noah's ARC, I was expecting a bunch of unknown actors and low budget production.  However, I LOVED Noah's ARC.  A beautiful series that was truly ended way too soon.  No so much this series.  There should never be a season 2.

I think Noah's ARC writing and direction made it a better series to watch and enjoy.  How do I describe the DL Chronicles?  In one word...AWFUL.  And predictable.  (I guess that was two words.)  And on top of the poor stories (and really bad acting) we were constantly treated to gratuitous nude scenes. I'm not opposed to nude scenes, but there was no point to these.  In one scene there was full frontal nudity.  What?!

Plus the show had a lot of plot holes, which really irritated me.  For example, in the story of Robert, can anyone tell me what the timeframe was?  He met the guy in the store, then online, then at his apartment and then on a few dates.  Next thing I knew... they were professing love for each other.  I couldn't tell if this romance happened in a week or a year.  I kept thinking to myself that if the executive producers/ writers/ directors (who appeared to be the same people, which probably led to most of the problems) <you know, no checks and balances> had eliminated all the nude scenes, maybe we could have been treated to more plot that actually filled in some of the holes.

Either way, I don't think that this would have improved the stories, much.  I understand that this series was pretty popular among the young, gay college crowd.  However, straight women like my friends and myself found it ""unwatchable.""  View at your own risk.",1243209600,2,1810,4.458715596330276

3038918,5,B000ZBEOHE,"I had seen this series and that is why I wanted to get a copy for myself. I found that the subject matter was very realistic and the situations that the characters delt with were true to whats happening in our society it was deffinately entertaining and thought provoking and is something that eveyone should see regurdless of race, gender or sexual preference.

I thoroughly enjoyed each of the 4 episodes, but by far my favorite one is the story of Robert (see previous reviews for the storyline) as it seemed very real, honest and sincere !!!  It shows a side rarely seen (hell, hardly ever) in our society of a black man who finds himself falling in love !!!  I had tears in my eyes during one scene !!!  I'm eagerly awaiting Season 2 and I may even renew my cable subscription to here TV just to catch the new episodes when they are initially aired !!!",1233705600,,767,4.052980132450331

3038921,5,B000ZBEOHE,"I think these episodes were amazing. I watched all four and loved them. The story of Robert was my favorite. Boo was so real and really gave you a look into the possible mind and life of the ""thug"" DL man. The other stories were very funny and heart warming.

3038924,5,B000ZBEOHE,"I was pleasantly surprised. I bought this DVD on a whim. The term DL is always negatively associated with black men while our white counter part (ie brokeback mountain) is heralded as a gay love story. I was pleased that it was not stories of Black men who habitually cheat on their wives and girlfriends. While a couple of the shorts involved the secret lives - others where about coming out (or not) and the fear of losing friends and family members as a result of that choice. Episode 1 Wes - his story is not finished - so I'm not sure he is on the DL or just made a bad decision during a drunken pity party - it dosen't mean he will continue to sleep with men
Episode 2 Robert - A middle age man who is embarking on a new relationship for the first time with a man and afraid for his college age daughter to find out - this is not DL - this is more coming out.
Episode 4 Mark -  A couple living together - tries to hide the statis of their relationship from an univited out of town relative- again not DL ..  this is closet
Now edisode 3 Boo - this is DL ..this character is freely sexing both men and women without any regard for safe sex practices -while adamantly denying being gay (his rationale he doesn't get f**ked and he'll let a guy suck him or he'll do him and that is different) this is the most compelling character in the whole series. Boo really is on the DL  he has no remorse or desire to make a choice or make a change - the life of a DL man is self serving
I recommend this product and I hope the makers will continue to explore the various  life experiences of gay men - I just wished they named it something else - the show really explores the different struggles in self acceptance verses the life of a DL man",1219708800,,1735,4.094117647058823
3038925,5,B000ZBEOHE,"There are four stories in this set which all deal with aspects of the 'Down Low' life.  It gives us a view from not only the DL person's viewpoint, but many of those who he comes into contact as well.  I felt Episode #1 was the weakest, since by the end of the story, there is no real change made in the lead character's life.  There's plenty of eye candy in each episode to keep you interested in these characters and see how they resolve thier life issues.  Episode #2 is cute, predictable and very 'sweet'.  Episode three is a real eye-opener as to what often happens in society.  Blame for the spread of STDs is shared not only by the DL individuals, but also their contacts as well.  It makes a strong case as to why we need to use protection EVERY time with EVERYBODY.  Episode #4 has an interesting 'plot twist' and keeps the viewer's attention focused.  The additional conversations by the Directors and actors in the ""Commentary"" section makes for a very interesting expose on this DL topic as well.  I'd heartily recommend it.",1219190400,,1036,4.491978609625669

3038927,4,B000ZBEOHE,"The DL Chronicles: The Complete First Season is lacking in very few aspects.  However if there is a sore spot, it is the number of episodes - too few for this viewer.  Hopefully here! cable channel will allocate more funding to generate a full season - 22 episodes.  The variety of actors and their respective talent happens to be the cornerstone of the high quality production.  The fact the directors/producers keep the story lines moving forward is another reason to celebrate The DL Chronicles.

3038934,5,B000ZBEOHE,It is a great concept. A series of short stories about African-Americans. The acting started off shakey but got better as it went along. It also provided work for lots of minority actors. I'm so glad it wasn't filled with the typical images we see. Too bad HERE only allowed 4 episodes. This series is worthy of so much more.

Anyway, besides the 4 short episodes, the acting doesn't help.  There are some very cute, good looking men, but they must of just been picked up from a modeling agency, because they lack in the acting department.

The stories are okay, but 30 minutes per story is not enough for you to get really envolved or feel for any of the characters.  They don't have enough substance.  If you are getting it for the sex scenes, those are not even worth the money.  There are better scenes in Noah's Arc.",1210636800,5,636,4.422413793103448

some reason rarely shows Black men together, I hope this changes and
soon. Noah's Ark on Logo sure was refreshing to see, but then they cancel it, go figure. In any case if you get the DL Chronicles you will enjoy it

3038937,4,B000ZBEOHE,"I stumbled across this film looking for resources to support a paper for school I wrote tackling the representation of Black Gay themes in film.  I didn't know what to expect when I purchased this, but I have to say that the script and acting were equally amazing.

The downfall with this series is the writers were concerned too much on the twists and turns in the script (which I must add were well thought out) rather than focusing on the whole DL phenomenon and its effects within the Black [Gay] Community.  The only episode that successfully executed this was the BOO episode, which stands out among the four as being the most thorough and raw depiction of what today's DL Black man by definition stands for.  The longest of the four, the ROBERT episode, may have come close but the twist to the story makes it null and void (which I will not give away).  However, there are many issues about acceptance and struggle in the ROBERT episode that the BOO episode lack, which were on point and resonate today.  Everything else was unfortunately nothing more than any given episode of a soap opera in comparison.

For anyone who has watched such promising yet flawed put-together series like ""The Closet"" and ""Noah's Arc,"" you will be taken aback by how believable the cast is, for starters.  The script is well written but drags at times, but the acting makes up for that.

I recommend watching each episode from beginning to end to fully understand the story and catch the links between characters from episode to episode.  Because the WES episode starts out really slow compared to the intensity of those that follow, I skipped to the 4th episode, MARK (which turns out to be the most comical and light-hearted of the four), before watching the other two and saying, ""Wait a minute?!"" and doing some rewinding for myself.  But again, watch from beginning to end and pay close attention to the character overlapping for some ""Ahh ha"" moments.

Another shortcoming, or maybe just a question that went unanswered, was the whole purpose of the narrator and his involvement with these men.  The narrator is writing a book focusing on DL men and as the episodes intro, he is either writing or talking about the whole DL culture before he starts talking about each individual.  In Episode 1 WES it is revealed how they meet, but I was left wondering how, if he is telling the story, does he know all of this information about Wes.  Were they intimate (which you think is obvious as the story sets up the way they meet, but it never comes into play again)?  Does he know someone who knows these people?  Did they tell their stories to him for his book?  Is he maybe even one of the individuals involved in the stories and he has just changed the names and instances?

Maybe another season will offer these answers, but for anyone looking for an extremely entertaining, thought provoking, well-scripted and acted Black film/series of a different kind, I highly recommend this DVD.",1209600000,,2975,4.686538461538461

3038953,4,B000ZBEOHE,"Not so very long ago, exclusively gay TV shows were non-existent. Certainly, there were gay characters in mainstream shows, but no shows just for us. That's all changed in the last few years, and since Queer As Folk debuted in 1999 (with a superior US version appearing the following year), TV shows in which we're the majority - not the minority - have been springing up like erections in a Bel Ami flick. Noah's Arc, Dante's Cove, Metrosexuality, The Closet - and The DL Chronicles.

The DL Chronicles differs from its cousins in looking at a different set of characters in each self-contained episode, with narrator Chadwick Williams (Damian T. Raven) and the theme of ""men of color"" living sexually duplicitous and secret lifestyles the unifying factors. The four episodes that make up the first season are refreshingly varied, featuring men in various situations and of differing circumstance. But cast an eye over a handful of reviews of this series and you'll discover it's the third episode, Boo, which receives the most acclaim.

Undoubtably, Oneil Cespedes, playing Boo, is platinum grade eye candy, and turns in one of the strongest performances in all the episodes; it's also one of the best realised episodes. But the story - that of a downlow player and a thug - is the most obvious one; it's a crowdpleaser. Everyone wants to be a thug, and those that don't wanna get one. In particular, Boo has been trumpeted as the definitive vision of black gay masculinity, against Noah's Arc, which critics accuse of camping it up (presumably for showing some gay men acting fem). That isn't a criticism of the episode, however, just a rationale for its popularity amongst viewers.

Interestingly, Boo is shown sleeping with just about anyone - female, male, black, white, whatever. Despite being sold as a series about ""men of color"", the cast is actually racially ambiguous, and doesn't seem intent on perpetuating racial separtism in the gay community like Queer As Folk (which in five years didn't feature any non-white characters) and Noah's Arc (where the only whites seen on screen were gay bashers).

The other episodes are all strong in their own right, and often surprising. My only real gripe is the intrusive and dated background music - give me the intelligent, soundtrack-free experience of The Wire and The Shield. The ponderous piano employed on The DL Chronicles, so beloved of indie producers, is jarring.

Music aside, The DL Chronicles is hugely enjoyable, heartfelt, and perhaps most importantly, promises much more. Roll on season two.",1205020800,,2561,5.002347417840376

3038957,5,B000ZBEOHE,"For anyone who may not already know, a man on the ""Down Low"" or ""DL"", is one who secretly has sex with other men while pretending he only has sex with women. Such men can be single, have long-term girlfriends, fiances, wives and even children and they rarely form romantic relationships with the men they have sex with. This sexual behaviour can be seen all over the world of course and is not in any way unique to the US. Neither is it the sole preserve of black men or even men in general, as men AND women of all ethnicities are also known to behave in correspondingly similar ways.

For reasons I haven't been able to determine however, African American and Latino men have chosen to formalise or institutionalise this phenomenon and coined and embraced the ""DL"" term. J. L. King wrote a book about it and went on Oprah to tell her and her wide-eyed studio audience how it's done, (apparently from first-hand experience), and in his book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beyond-the-Down-Low-Sex-Lies-and-Denial-in-Black-America/dp/0786714344/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beyond the Down Low: Sex, Lies, and Denial in Black America</a>, writer, activist and broadcaster Keith Boykin put together the most adequate exploration of this complex and intriguing phenomenon I've ever come across. I've heard - I've never met one of them personally myself - that these men are quite proud to proclaim themselves as being on the DL and are reported to be a really big deal in the eyes of the men who are said to lust after them. Each to his own, I suppose.

I do find it interesting though that unlike most social developments in the US, this is one that hasn't succeeded in crossing over the Atlantic to the UK. At least not yet. The behaviour exists, obviously, but the label just hasn't found a home here - and I would know.

Anyway, to the DVD. Though I had some preconceptions, I didn't know exactly what to expect. I deliberately didn't read anything about the DVD, not even any other reviews here on Amazon. I didn't even read the splurge on the back of the DVD (although I was surprised to see that the whole season was contained on just the one disc); I just put it in, sat back and watched. I was pleasantly surprised.

The season can fit into just the one disc because there are only four episodes to it. Created, produced & directed by real-life couple Deondray Gossett and Quincy LeNear, all four episodes - two written by Gossett, the other two by LeNear - are all woven together by narrator Chadwick (played by Damian Toofeek Raven) who plays an aspiring journalist who's writing a book about men he's met and knows about. He only gets to physically meet one of the men whose stories are featured here so I had to assume he knew of the other three. Each episode is about each of these four men.

First off is Wes, a married real estate banker (played by Darren Shnase), whose wife Sarah (played by Jessica Bashir) tells him one day that her ""weird"" brother Trent (played by Ty Vincent) will be staying with them for a while. It's clear from the onset that Trent makes Wes uncomfortable and he seems to know something about Wes that we don't.

The second episode introduces Robert, a talent agent (played by Terrell Tilford), who meets a charming young man named Austin (played by Austin Wade) after an incident in the health store Austin manages. In a case of coincidence that stretches the imagination somewhat, the two later meet online and arrange to meet. Robert appears eager and evasive all at the same time and Austin wants to take things slow. This episode is given added vigour by the performance of Sheilynn Wactor, who plays Austin's fiesty co-worker Shirley. Karamo (from MTV's Philadelphia season of ""The Real World"" has a cameo appearance, acting, ironically, the role of a straight dude. This is a better story than the previous one. I laughed out loud in places and I was slack-jawed towards the end.

We meet Boo (played by Oneil Cespedes) in episode three, and while this is supposed to be an episode that challenges stereotypes, to me, Boo was a stereotype walking. Hard-acting, tough-talking, bald-headed, Timberland-wearing and with tattoos and trousers down around his thighs, he was the archetypal thug. He was also hypersexual to boot and seemed to be sleeping with everyone, male and female. The good thing about this episode though, was that it went a long way to explain some of the reasons why these men behave in the way they do and it also bravely introduces the tricky issue of HIV/AIDS into the mix. There's a gasp-inducing moment where I'm sure a lot of folks will be reaching for the review and pause buttons on their remotes and, speaking for myself, I was particularly taken with Boo's friend Deron (played by Anthony Clark).

The final episode, perhaps wisely after the issues raised in episode three, decides to go for humour and we meet Mark (played by Ulrich Que), who's in a long-term committed relationship with partner Donte (played by Colbert Alembert). Mark's zany cousin Terrell (played by Dee Gibson) drops by unexpectedly and uninvited one day and asks if he can crash for a while. He's apparently fallen out with his girlfriend Regina. Terrell doesn't know that Mark is gay and poor Donte has to pretend to be Mark's roommate and he's NOT pleased. The stage is thus set for a whole lot of drama and misadventure. There's a shock twist to this story that I did NOT see coming and I'm usually good with that sort of thing. The end had me in absolute hysterics.

I really commend the show's creators and makers for this piece of work. Every single one of the preconceptions I had about the series was smashed (I thought the actors were all going to be chiselled-jawed model types; I thought the scenarios were all going to be E. Lynn Harris-esque upper-middle class, with lots of flashy cars, first-class flights, talk of designer labels and the like; I thought the talk would be all about sex and I was wrong on all three counts) and although there were a few ""Nollywood"" moments, on the whole the series was very well acted and very well directed. I also have to commend here! - I believe it's a cable channel - for taking the series on. There were enough love scenes and scenes of  full nudity to make it interesting without it being too tacky. I actually like this better than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Noah-s-Arc-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B000GFLEFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Noah's Arc - The Complete First Season</a>.

Most crucially though, I feel that no matter what opinions we may hold about this breed of men, this series will go some way to enabling us to understand them better. I certainly do. I used to believe that they were a bunch of duplicitous, selfish and dangerous renegades but while I don't excuse what they do and probably never will, at least I now know it's a lot more complicated than that. At the end of the day, if the society we live in wasn't so virulently homophobic and patently heterosexist, these kinds of men would probably not exist. I have a feeling they're not all that happy living the way they do and as fellow human beings - men, women, gay, straight, bisexual, black, white or whatever - I feel we all need to be concerned about that.

It'll be interesting to see where these guys go for season two. I'm looking forward to it.

3038964,3,B000ZBEOHE,"Reading the reviews here on Amazon.com and in other places, I purchased this expecting cutting-edge entertainment that showed and really examined the `down low' culture African-American and Latino (and others) engage in. I expected this to be above and superior to the Logo show `Noah's Arc' that really camped up the gay/queer experience for Black males for the sake of offering a humorous show.

`The DL Chronicles' has four episodes to this first season. In my opinion, only one of them has anything of real substance. Otherwise, this is just another show that pretty much takes light of the `down low' culture with odd situations, at times over-the-top acting, cheesy-dialogue that pretty much distracts from the main mission of the show.  Yes, there are a few love scenes mixed in between the men that probably make this show stand out from the others and gives some viewers the impression that it's accomplishing something or is `groundbreaking'. Really, it isn't.

The episode ""Boo"" is the most realistic and compelling episode of the small lot. It examines the `thug' culture that seems more rampant and current in today's culture. Seeing how the character Boo, along with his middle-class family, girlfriend, friends and neighbors deal with and confront sexuality, sex, consequences does stand out from most anything I've seen on the DL culture. The other episodes though don't do much at all but stick the generic `boy meets boy' plot and `boy and boy have problem, have sex, go back to problem' formula. The first episode deals with a well-off husband who confronts his sexuality and his wife's gay brother and offered some very over-the-top acting that was distracting. One dealt with a couple's adjusting to living with one another and one's coming out to his family, completely given a comedy-treatment. Another with a father coming out to his daughter that's probably the next best episode to ""Boo"".

In all, it's a decent show but the description on the back, and some of the reviews, give the impression it's a much more serious and gritty show than it really is. It's pretty light and comedic for the most part with moments of seriousness. The only episode that doesn't fall victim to mediocrity is ""Boo"" which I wish had been expanded on and given more than just an episode. It was by far more realistic, gritty, `wow' inducing than the other three episodes that were a bit of a let-down from the much hyped series.",1202860800,20,2434,4.914841849148418

A closeted talent agent (Terrell Tilford) falls for a hot health food store manager (Kareem Ferguson), 20 years his junior. What Robert fails to share is that there is a very special lady in his life. When Robert's new lover grows suspicious about his many secrets, a game of cat and mouse ensues.

Episode 3: Boo
Boo is an ex-convict, a mooch, and a player who lives his life on the DL. His girlfriend is fed up with Boo's cheating and kicks him to the curb. Boo's mother tells him it's time to settle down, but Boo is unfazed and continues having sex with multiple partners, including an unprotected romp with Deron, his neighborhood friend. But when shocking news rattles Boo, he is forced to reconsider his reckless life on the DL.

Episode 4: Mark
Mark and Donte, a loving couple who have been living on the DL, are jolted by the unexpected arrival of Mark's thuggish cousin, Terrell, who shows up at their house needing a place to crash. Desperate to keep their relationship a secret, Mark asks his boyfriend to pretend he's straight. When Donte reluctantly agrees to play the part of Mark's ""roommate"" for their new houseguest, a chain of humorous events unfolds, and Mark eventually comes to realize the ridiculous nature of living on the DL in their own home.",1202342400,3,2234,4.994623655913978
3273361,5,B000ZBEOHE,"This DVD expertly captures the many different
scenarios and complexities of the modern urban
phenomenon called ""The DL"" (Down Low) or a closeted
gay or bisexual man( usually black or latino, but not
exclusively!) who lives a dual life of sleeping with women
to keep up their public image / street cred / family ties,
etc., while secretly indulging in intimate encounters
with other men!--It's been going on for years!

Of course, these men insist on and, in some cases,
will fight you to prove that they're straight!
But it's a sad game of self-deception,
self-denial and ultimately, self-hate, which leaves
lives turned upside down when the inevitable truth comes
to the light! This series brilliantly captures all of
this through its main case studies:

Wes, the sucessful married executive who is a beautiful
man with a beautiful wife and a seemingly beautiful life that,
as we go under the surface, hides deeper inner pain and
longing which is brought bubbling to the surface when
his wife's devastingly gorgeous, manipulative and roguish
gay brother comes to stay with them for awhile to
""get on his feet""!!---That ain't all he gets on!

Then there's Robert, the handsome everyday guy who is
a sucessful talent agent who was once married and has
a college-aged daughter who lives with him who has no
clue that her dad spends his free time in gay chat rooms,
cruising guys on the internet and having secret gay liasons.
His life is turned upside down when he meets an
attractive openly gay, but not nelly, man who owns a health
store and through their budding relationship, Robert
is transformed and learns the meaning of honesty,
love and self-acceptance.

Then there's BOO--The stereotypical ""thug"",
whose hyper-masculine swagger, hip-hop era (outwardly)
homophobic attitude, sagging jeans, 3/4 timbz,
wife beater teez and exposed boxers are in sharp contrast
to what he really likes to get down in when he isn't
fighting with his hood-rat girlfreind Keisha,
who puts him out at least twice a week
or mooching off of his church-going, bible-thumping mother!
Who is the type to say she's a loving christian,
but then bashes and condemns those who aren't like
her every chance she gets!
Boo is a ""man-boy"", who though he's very much
a grown man physically, is but a child both emotionally
& mentally!--A very common occurence these days!
He accepts no responsibility for his life on any level,
thinks he has the answer between his legs to all the
world's problems, puts down gays in one breath while
sleeping with them every chance he gets!--He also cheats
with other women too!--Just the quintessential ""playa"" type.
Anywayz, this scenario plays out with alot of interesting plot
twists that will keep you laughing and oohing and ahhing!

Lastly, there's Mark and Dante, a black and latino
middle class gay couple of 3 yrs who reside in San Francisco
who are making leaps and bounds in their relationship when
they get an unexpected and uninvited visit from Mark's ol'
sorry-azz drifter no-account cousin, Terrell, who brings
baggage of all kinds with him from L.A.!!
But the guy is sooo funny too!
This story has a lot of great twists to it as well!--

Without giving everything away, this is a great series
because it is done intelligently, with humor and with great
sensitivity. It also rings true in so many ways and really
opens up understanding in those whose hearts and minds are
open and may either be in this situation or has a freind
or family member in this situation.

In the black and latino communities, there is such
an ugly and heavy stigma and homophobia
against gays that a lot of people,
thankfullly not myself, feel they have to live this
DL lifestyle just to function and remain close to the
ones they love and hold on to whatever it is that they
think they have accrued in this life.
But the truth is the light, and I hope that through
films like this that don't use stereotypes and show
gay/bi men of color as what they really are---men,
in every sense, who just, through natural selection
or fate, share a different end of the sexual spectrum
from their mainstream counterparts and deserved to be
loved and valued like any other human being
as part of the bigger human family.
Through stories like these, intelligent, respectful
and understanding dialogue can be started amongst
freinds, amongst family members, etc., to overcome
what really shouldn't be an issue anywayz!--And hey,
if they abandon you, then they didn't love you for you
anyway and should be considered good riddance
to bad rubbish! Self-Love, Self-Acceptance,
Self-Acknowledgement, etc. and living your truth will
lead to a richer and fuller life for all parties concerned...gay/bi/straight or whatever!

But, personal philosophies aside, this series
(the complete first season) is a great and
groundbreaking step in the right direction and
I can't wait to see more!
It's well worth the money to add this
to your collection!",1202256000,53,4921,4.899159663865547

It gave various incarnations of the ""down low"" phenomenon. The term came to reflect more hiding from oneself instead of the usual manipulation/deception of women. I definitely enjoyed every episode I saw and can't wait to see the whole series. This series, like black men, is more complex than simple stereotypes.",1201219200,2,484,4.987654320987654

I was impress with the candid openess in alot of the scenes.  The characters were hot especially the men. The storylines were excellent.  I still get irritated when I see scenes like the one in the garage and the ideal that they (DLs) do not think or even conceive the fact that they are gay but are willing to put down their neighbor who is openly gay.  Which one is more dangerous?  I have a problem with Bi or DL.  Be one or the other.  It's too confusing and too dangerous to play a switch hitter especially when you are dealing with women's lives. But all in all.  I really like the hot scenes and for the DL(s) that are out there.  Women are finally waking up.  A Queen trying to be a King is not for the millenium.

3273411,5,B000ZBEOHE,"Why do all ads for this refer to it as ""The Complete First Season""?
First season???  Hell, its the ONLY damn season!  Makes no damn
sense, either.  Unlike some of the previous reviewers who apparently
sought out the show looking for a life changing experience, I merely
was looking to be entertained....and I was.  It was great to just
see gay MOC interacting with each other period, since you are more
likely to see the Loch Ness Monster on a reality date with Bigfoot,
on TV first.  However, that, sadly is also why there are only four
episodes of The DL C, while series such as Queer as Folk have gone for
many full-fledged (not some paltry 4 episodes) seasons.  I assume
MOC into each other, and not pursuing White men is a no no.  I guess
they don't even want the mere thought that MOC can actually p-r-e-f-e-r
each other, to even enter the public consciousness.  Trust me, if there
were an abundance of White men being chased on The DL C, there would
be 5 times as many episodes produced by now.  Same reasoning applies
to Noah's Arc.  If Noah and crew had been all hugged up on White guys,
it would still be on the air too.
The Complete First Season.....indeed.  Here is a clue:

In order to properly quantify as a ""First"" season.....there needs to be
subsequent seasons to follow, or at l-e-a-s-t a second damn season.",1248912000,2,1326,4.45643153526971
3273412,1,B000ZBEOHE,"I think unsuspecting people should be aware that this series is NO Noah's ARC.  I'm not talking about the stories.  I was very aware of what this series was about before I saw it.  I read all the reviews.  And like Noah's ARC, I was expecting a bunch of unknown actors and low budget production.  However, I LOVED Noah's ARC.  A beautiful series that was truly ended way too soon.  No so much this series.  There should never be a season 2.

I think Noah's ARC writing and direction made it a better series to watch and enjoy.  How do I describe the DL Chronicles?  In one word...AWFUL.  And predictable.  (I guess that was two words.)  And on top of the poor stories (and really bad acting) we were constantly treated to gratuitous nude scenes. I'm not opposed to nude scenes, but there was no point to these.  In one scene there was full frontal nudity.  What?!

Plus the show had a lot of plot holes, which really irritated me.  For example, in the story of Robert, can anyone tell me what the timeframe was?  He met the guy in the store, then online, then at his apartment and then on a few dates.  Next thing I knew... they were professing love for each other.  I couldn't tell if this romance happened in a week or a year.  I kept thinking to myself that if the executive producers/ writers/ directors (who appeared to be the same people, which probably led to most of the problems) <you know, no checks and balances> had eliminated all the nude scenes, maybe we could have been treated to more plot that actually filled in some of the holes.

Either way, I don't think that this would have improved the stories, much.  I understand that this series was pretty popular among the young, gay college crowd.  However, straight women like my friends and myself found it ""unwatchable.""  View at your own risk.",1243209600,2,1810,4.458715596330276

It shows a side rarely seen (hell, hardly ever) in our society of a black man who finds himself falling in love !!!  I had tears in my eyes during one scene !!!

3273421,5,B000ZBEOHE,"I was pleasantly surprised. I bought this DVD on a whim. The term DL is always negatively associated with black men while our white counter part (ie brokeback mountain) is heralded as a gay love story. I was pleased that it was not stories of Black men who habitually cheat on their wives and girlfriends. While a couple of the shorts involved the secret lives - others where about coming out (or not) and the fear of losing friends and family members as a result of that choice. Episode 1 Wes - his story is not finished - so I'm not sure he is on the DL or just made a bad decision during a drunken pity party - it dosen't mean he will continue to sleep with men
Episode 2 Robert - A middle age man who is embarking on a new relationship for the first time with a man and afraid for his college age daughter to find out - this is not DL - this is more coming out.
Episode 4 Mark -  A couple living together - tries to hide the statis of their relationship from an univited out of town relative- again not DL ..  this is closet
Now edisode 3 Boo - this is DL ..this character is freely sexing both men and women without any regard for safe sex practices -while adamantly denying being gay (his rationale he doesn't get f**ked and he'll let a guy suck him or he'll do him and that is different) this is the most compelling character in the whole series. Boo really is on the DL  he has no remorse or desire to make a choice or make a change - the life of a DL man is self serving
I recommend this product and I hope the makers will continue to explore the various  life experiences of gay men - I just wished they named it something else - the show really explores the different struggles in self acceptance verses the life of a DL man",1219708800,,1735,4.094117647058823

I felt Episode #1 was the weakest, since by the end of the story, there is no real change made in the lead character's life.  There's plenty of eye candy in each episode to keep you interested in these characters and see how they resolve thier life issues.  Episode #2 is cute, predictable and very 'sweet'.  Episode three is a real eye-opener as to what often happens in society.  Blame for the spread of STDs is shared not only by the DL individuals, but also their contacts as well.  It makes a strong case as to why we need to use protection EVERY time with EVERYBODY.  Episode #4 has an interesting 'plot twist' and keeps the viewer's attention focused.

There are some very cute, good looking men, but they must of just been picked up from a modeling agency, because they lack in the acting department.

The stories are okay, but 30 minutes per story is not enough for you to get really envolved or feel for any of the characters.  They don't have enough substance.  If you are getting it for the sex scenes, those are not even worth the money.  There are better scenes in Noah's Arc.",1210636800,5,636,4.422413793103448

some reason rarely shows Black men together, I hope this changes and
soon. Noah's Ark on Logo sure was refreshing to see, but then they cancel it, go figure. In any case if you get the DL Chronicles you will enjoy it

3273434,4,B000ZBEOHE,"I stumbled across this film looking for resources to support a paper for school I wrote tackling the representation of Black Gay themes in film.  I didn't know what to expect when I purchased this, but I have to say that the script and acting were equally amazing.

The downfall with this series is the writers were concerned too much on the twists and turns in the script (which I must add were well thought out) rather than focusing on the whole DL phenomenon and its effects within the Black [Gay] Community.  The only episode that successfully executed this was the BOO episode, which stands out among the four as being the most thorough and raw depiction of what today's DL Black man by definition stands for.  The longest of the four, the ROBERT episode, may have come close but the twist to the story makes it null and void (which I will not give away).  However, there are many issues about acceptance and struggle in the ROBERT episode that the BOO episode lack, which were on point and resonate today.  Everything else was unfortunately nothing more than any given episode of a soap opera in comparison.

For anyone who has watched such promising yet flawed put-together series like ""The Closet"" and ""Noah's Arc,"" you will be taken aback by how believable the cast is, for starters.  The script is well written but drags at times, but the acting makes up for that.

I recommend watching each episode from beginning to end to fully understand the story and catch the links between characters from episode to episode.  Because the WES episode starts out really slow compared to the intensity of those that follow, I skipped to the 4th episode, MARK (which turns out to be the most comical and light-hearted of the four), before watching the other two and saying, ""Wait a minute?!"" and doing some rewinding for myself.  But again, watch from beginning to end and pay close attention to the character overlapping for some ""Ahh ha"" moments.

Another shortcoming, or maybe just a question that went unanswered, was the whole purpose of the narrator and his involvement with these men.  The narrator is writing a book focusing on DL men and as the episodes intro, he is either writing or talking about the whole DL culture before he starts talking about each individual.  In Episode 1 WES it is revealed how they meet, but I was left wondering how, if he is telling the story, does he know all of this information about Wes.  Were they intimate (which you think is obvious as the story sets up the way they meet, but it never comes into play again)?  Does he know someone who knows these people?  Did they tell their stories to him for his book?  Is he maybe even one of the individuals involved in the stories and he has just changed the names and instances?

Maybe another season will offer these answers, but for anyone looking for an extremely entertaining, thought provoking, well-scripted and acted Black film/series of a different kind, I highly recommend this DVD.",1209600000,,2975,4.686538461538461

3273450,4,B000ZBEOHE,"Not so very long ago, exclusively gay TV shows were non-existent. Certainly, there were gay characters in mainstream shows, but no shows just for us. That's all changed in the last few years, and since Queer As Folk debuted in 1999 (with a superior US version appearing the following year), TV shows in which we're the majority - not the minority - have been springing up like erections in a Bel Ami flick. Noah's Arc, Dante's Cove, Metrosexuality, The Closet - and The DL Chronicles.

The DL Chronicles differs from its cousins in looking at a different set of characters in each self-contained episode, with narrator Chadwick Williams (Damian T. Raven) and the theme of ""men of color"" living sexually duplicitous and secret lifestyles the unifying factors. The four episodes that make up the first season are refreshingly varied, featuring men in various situations and of differing circumstance. But cast an eye over a handful of reviews of this series and you'll discover it's the third episode, Boo, which receives the most acclaim.

Undoubtably, Oneil Cespedes, playing Boo, is platinum grade eye candy, and turns in one of the strongest performances in all the episodes; it's also one of the best realised episodes. But the story - that of a downlow player and a thug - is the most obvious one; it's a crowdpleaser. Everyone wants to be a thug, and those that don't wanna get one. In particular, Boo has been trumpeted as the definitive vision of black gay masculinity, against Noah's Arc, which critics accuse of camping it up (presumably for showing some gay men acting fem). That isn't a criticism of the episode, however, just a rationale for its popularity amongst viewers.

Interestingly, Boo is shown sleeping with just about anyone - female, male, black, white, whatever. Despite being sold as a series about ""men of color"", the cast is actually racially ambiguous, and doesn't seem intent on perpetuating racial separtism in the gay community like Queer As Folk (which in five years didn't feature any non-white characters) and Noah's Arc (where the only whites seen on screen were gay bashers).

The other episodes are all strong in their own right, and often surprising. My only real gripe is the intrusive and dated background music - give me the intelligent, soundtrack-free experience of The Wire and The Shield. The ponderous piano employed on The DL Chronicles, so beloved of indie producers, is jarring.

Music aside, The DL Chronicles is hugely enjoyable, heartfelt, and perhaps most importantly, promises much more. Roll on season two.",1205020800,,2561,5.002347417840376

After viewing it, I can truly say, I learned a few things about this so-called down low life style that I didn't consider before.

3273454,5,B000ZBEOHE,"For anyone who may not already know, a man on the ""Down Low"" or ""DL"", is one who secretly has sex with other men while pretending he only has sex with women. Such men can be single, have long-term girlfriends, fiances, wives and even children and they rarely form romantic relationships with the men they have sex with. This sexual behaviour can be seen all over the world of course and is not in any way unique to the US. Neither is it the sole preserve of black men or even men in general, as men AND women of all ethnicities are also known to behave in correspondingly similar ways.

For reasons I haven't been able to determine however, African American and Latino men have chosen to formalise or institutionalise this phenomenon and coined and embraced the ""DL"" term. J. L. King wrote a book about it and went on Oprah to tell her and her wide-eyed studio audience how it's done, (apparently from first-hand experience), and in his book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beyond-the-Down-Low-Sex-Lies-and-Denial-in-Black-America/dp/0786714344/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beyond the Down Low: Sex, Lies, and Denial in Black America</a>, writer, activist and broadcaster Keith Boykin put together the most adequate exploration of this complex and intriguing phenomenon I've ever come across. I've heard - I've never met one of them personally myself - that these men are quite proud to proclaim themselves as being on the DL and are reported to be a really big deal in the eyes of the men who are said to lust after them. Each to his own, I suppose.

I do find it interesting though that unlike most social developments in the US, this is one that hasn't succeeded in crossing over the Atlantic to the UK. At least not yet. The behaviour exists, obviously, but the label just hasn't found a home here - and I would know.

Anyway, to the DVD. Though I had some preconceptions, I didn't know exactly what to expect. I deliberately didn't read anything about the DVD, not even any other reviews here on Amazon. I didn't even read the splurge on the back of the DVD (although I was surprised to see that the whole season was contained on just the one disc); I just put it in, sat back and watched. I was pleasantly surprised.

The season can fit into just the one disc because there are only four episodes to it. Created, produced & directed by real-life couple Deondray Gossett and Quincy LeNear, all four episodes - two written by Gossett, the other two by LeNear - are all woven together by narrator Chadwick (played by Damian Toofeek Raven) who plays an aspiring journalist who's writing a book about men he's met and knows about. He only gets to physically meet one of the men whose stories are featured here so I had to assume he knew of the other three. Each episode is about each of these four men.

First off is Wes, a married real estate banker (played by Darren Shnase), whose wife Sarah (played by Jessica Bashir) tells him one day that her ""weird"" brother Trent (played by Ty Vincent) will be staying with them for a while. It's clear from the onset that Trent makes Wes uncomfortable and he seems to know something about Wes that we don't.

The second episode introduces Robert, a talent agent (played by Terrell Tilford), who meets a charming young man named Austin (played by Austin Wade) after an incident in the health store Austin manages. In a case of coincidence that stretches the imagination somewhat, the two later meet online and arrange to meet. Robert appears eager and evasive all at the same time and Austin wants to take things slow. This episode is given added vigour by the performance of Sheilynn Wactor, who plays Austin's fiesty co-worker Shirley. Karamo (from MTV's Philadelphia season of ""The Real World"" has a cameo appearance, acting, ironically, the role of a straight dude. This is a better story than the previous one. I laughed out loud in places and I was slack-jawed towards the end.

We meet Boo (played by Oneil Cespedes) in episode three, and while this is supposed to be an episode that challenges stereotypes, to me, Boo was a stereotype walking. Hard-acting, tough-talking, bald-headed, Timberland-wearing and with tattoos and trousers down around his thighs, he was the archetypal thug. He was also hypersexual to boot and seemed to be sleeping with everyone, male and female. The good thing about this episode though, was that it went a long way to explain some of the reasons why these men behave in the way they do and it also bravely introduces the tricky issue of HIV/AIDS into the mix. There's a gasp-inducing moment where I'm sure a lot of folks will be reaching for the review and pause buttons on their remotes and, speaking for myself, I was particularly taken with Boo's friend Deron (played by Anthony Clark).

The final episode, perhaps wisely after the issues raised in episode three, decides to go for humour and we meet Mark (played by Ulrich Que), who's in a long-term committed relationship with partner Donte (played by Colbert Alembert). Mark's zany cousin Terrell (played by Dee Gibson) drops by unexpectedly and uninvited one day and asks if he can crash for a while. He's apparently fallen out with his girlfriend Regina. Terrell doesn't know that Mark is gay and poor Donte has to pretend to be Mark's roommate and he's NOT pleased. The stage is thus set for a whole lot of drama and misadventure. There's a shock twist to this story that I did NOT see coming and I'm usually good with that sort of thing. The end had me in absolute hysterics.

I really commend the show's creators and makers for this piece of work. Every single one of the preconceptions I had about the series was smashed (I thought the actors were all going to be chiselled-jawed model types; I thought the scenarios were all going to be E. Lynn Harris-esque upper-middle class, with lots of flashy cars, first-class flights, talk of designer labels and the like; I thought the talk would be all about sex and I was wrong on all three counts) and although there were a few ""Nollywood"" moments, on the whole the series was very well acted and very well directed. I also have to commend here! - I believe it's a cable channel - for taking the series on. There were enough love scenes and scenes of  full nudity to make it interesting without it being too tacky. I actually like this better than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Noah-s-Arc-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B000GFLEFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Noah's Arc - The Complete First Season</a>.

Most crucially though, I feel that no matter what opinions we may hold about this breed of men, this series will go some way to enabling us to understand them better. I certainly do. I used to believe that they were a bunch of duplicitous, selfish and dangerous renegades but while I don't excuse what they do and probably never will, at least I now know it's a lot more complicated than that. At the end of the day, if the society we live in wasn't so virulently homophobic and patently heterosexist, these kinds of men would probably not exist. I have a feeling they're not all that happy living the way they do and as fellow human beings - men, women, gay, straight, bisexual, black, white or whatever - I feel we all need to be concerned about that.

It'll be interesting to see where these guys go for season two. I'm looking forward to it.

3273461,3,B000ZBEOHE,"Reading the reviews here on Amazon.com and in other places, I purchased this expecting cutting-edge entertainment that showed and really examined the `down low' culture African-American and Latino (and others) engage in. I expected this to be above and superior to the Logo show `Noah's Arc' that really camped up the gay/queer experience for Black males for the sake of offering a humorous show.

`The DL Chronicles' has four episodes to this first season. In my opinion, only one of them has anything of real substance. Otherwise, this is just another show that pretty much takes light of the `down low' culture with odd situations, at times over-the-top acting, cheesy-dialogue that pretty much distracts from the main mission of the show.  Yes, there are a few love scenes mixed in between the men that probably make this show stand out from the others and gives some viewers the impression that it's accomplishing something or is `groundbreaking'. Really, it isn't.

The episode ""Boo"" is the most realistic and compelling episode of the small lot. It examines the `thug' culture that seems more rampant and current in today's culture. Seeing how the character Boo, along with his middle-class family, girlfriend, friends and neighbors deal with and confront sexuality, sex, consequences does stand out from most anything I've seen on the DL culture. The other episodes though don't do much at all but stick the generic `boy meets boy' plot and `boy and boy have problem, have sex, go back to problem' formula. The first episode deals with a well-off husband who confronts his sexuality and his wife's gay brother and offered some very over-the-top acting that was distracting. One dealt with a couple's adjusting to living with one another and one's coming out to his family, completely given a comedy-treatment. Another with a father coming out to his daughter that's probably the next best episode to ""Boo"".

In all, it's a decent show but the description on the back, and some of the reviews, give the impression it's a much more serious and gritty show than it really is. It's pretty light and comedic for the most part with moments of seriousness. The only episode that doesn't fall victim to mediocrity is ""Boo"" which I wish had been expanded on and given more than just an episode. It was by far more realistic, gritty, `wow' inducing than the other three episodes that were a bit of a let-down from the much hyped series.",1202860800,20,2434,4.914841849148418
