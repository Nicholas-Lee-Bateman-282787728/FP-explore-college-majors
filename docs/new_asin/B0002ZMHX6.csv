2152635,5,B0002ZMHX6,"IMHO, Superman was just as good a series as Batman, the Animated Series. The stories were not on a higher level, but a different one. Batman reflected film noir dramas as well as having a classic, vintage feel. Superman was a little more lighthearted, more epic, and had a modern feel. As with the Batman series, each Superman episode can be a stand alone episode in itself, yet it all adds considerable detail to the series as a whole making it a signicantly rich world. The consequences and the results of certain episodes are also touched upon from time to time and even lay the foundation for even more dramatic storytelling.

This DVD set includes the first 18 episodes of the series I believe. Starting it off is the 3-part ""Last Son of Krypton,"" which retells the origin of Superman and does a good job establishing the series. Other favorites of mine that are on this DVD set are ""Stolen Memories,"" "" The Main Man, Parts 1 & 2,"" ""My Girl,"" ""Blasts from the Past, Parts 1 & 2,"" and ""Speed Demons."" This set does include all the episodes on the single disc release ""Superman: A Little Piece of Home."" If you're a fan of the series I recommend this set over the single discs. If you're a parent looking to simply amuse your children, the single discs may be an option to consider, but even so this set can be bought for less than $25 and has 18 episodes to boot. The only drawback in this set that I can think of is that the second disc is a flipper, where one side contains 6 episodes and then the other side contains the last 6. It's a minor complaint, as I'm just all too happy to have this series as a box set, but it may be an issue to some.",1097798400,20,1651,4.291666666666667
2152636,5,B0002ZMHX6,"I'm not clear on which episodes were in which season. The one's that stick in my mind are the episodes with Darkseid. Especially the one dedicated to Jack Kirby,when Turpin dies,and the one when superman is brainwashed into thinking he's Darkseid's son and he attacks the earth. These episodes are right up there with the batman series. Also the episodes with bizarro are pretty warped. In particular when they show the deterioration of the perfect clone into bizarro,and the destruction of the many other developing clones. Then there is the episode where Bruce Wayne visits Metropolis and Lois Lane ends up loving Bruce but doesn't want him to be Batman,which is ironic because she loves Superman but not Clark. Then there is  the one where Superman fills in for Batman and the villains freak out trying to fight super-batman. Most of these episodes are probably in the second or third set,but they are all top quality. Great stories, great animation, great series. Buy them all.",1097280000,7,981,4.945454545454545
2152637,5,B0002ZMHX6,"Finally, one of my all time favorite 'toons being released on DVD! This cartoon had excellent stories and a great take on the man of steel. Any fan of Superman will love it! I only wish the series had lasted longer than the 55 or so episodes they made.",1097107200,5,252,4.163265306122449
2152638,5,B0002ZMHX6,"Superman: the animated series was quite a good show fromt the creators of Batman: the animated series. In this box set it does not feature the first season but the first volume (the first 18 episodes out of  the approximate 55 made). So probably there will be three in total. the episodes for this release are as follows....1-3 ""the last son of krypton,tells of supermans origins. 4. Fun and Games, the toyman is the bad guy. 5. A little piece of home, lex learns of superman's weakness. 6. The Way of all Flesh, bad guy is Metallo. 7. Feeding time, bad guy is the parasite. 8-9 the main man, is a two parter, obviously, ha ha. 10. Stolen memories, braniac is bad guy. 11. my girl, lana lang comes to metropolis. 12. Tools of the Trade, involves darkseid. 13. Two's a Crowd, man goes into a coma and s-man must find out information from him...somehow. 14-15. the main man, another two parter. 16. Ghost in the Machine, braniacs back..again. 17. Action Figures, involves metallo. and....18. Livewire, obviously is about bad girl named Livewire. AND THAT, MY FRIENDS IS THE EP.

A great way to introduce a non-comic reader, or even a jaded one, to the character.

2152723,3,B0002ZMHX6,"When viewed alongside ""Batman: The Animated Series"" from the same time period, the story writing, character depth, story immersion, just isn't there. Batman: TAS tells a story about flawed and hurting people. Sometimes we'll agree with the characters, others we'll question their decisions and motivations - but there's a definite pull to the story that keeps you coming back.

With Superman: TAS, none of that is here. Lois Lane's character is plastic and shallow, there's nothing to explain who or why she is. The same goes for Superman; his character's entire purpose in this series isn't really to do good, to stop crime, even to save the world - his entire motivation is saving Lois from one ridiculous situation after another, every single episode. The best episodes are those when Lois is hardly in the picture, because then we get just a glimpse of what a fleshed-out character could look like.  Frankly, the best episode in the series is ""Brave New Metropolis"" where we get to see Superman as the flawed character - scarred because he was a split second too late to save Lois.",1475107200,,1085,4.859459459459459

I just wish that Superman didn't show so much weakness. Getting punched or zapped with some kind of power Ray, he often ends up flying into a brick wall or down on the ground in agonizing pain.

Also, when lifting heavy weight he seems to struggle with it quite a bit.  Now Kryptonite, that's supposed to make him as weak as a lamb and I understand that.

I watched the show when it came out in the 90s and I just finished watching the whole first season again September 2016.  LOVE IT",1474502400,3,503,4.197916666666667

Two stars for season 1.  Superman's character is not developed, like all the characters.  The stories are generally predictable.  There is no sense of awe, wonder, or adventure.  By halfway through season 2, I'd give the show 3 stars, but by then my interest was gone.  I've never watched season 3.  In a word; disappointing.",1472860800,,497,4.845238095238095

2152773,3,B0002ZMHX6,"This was a very important interpretation of Superman. Also it was last (single character/weekly episodic) interpretation of the 20th century for Superman. Created by the same Warner Brothers animation team/studio that brought forth Batman : the animated series several years earlier. Very much the same artistically speaking (Fleischer inspired) as well as story telling structure. The show's biggest and most often cited flaw regards the incredible ""de-powering"" of the Man of Steel. This incarnation of Clark Kent/Superman is very traditional in many ways. The biggest change comes in the form of Superman being hurt relatively easily. They made him powerful of course. But this isn't the superman that can tow the moon on a chain either. But the animation is crisp and stylized to somewhat match the animated stylings Bruce Timm used in the creation of the 'Batman universe.'",1469923200,,878,5.323741007194244

2152829,5,B0002ZMHX6,"This is a very well written, animated, and acted series. I like how they purposefully dialed back some of Superman's powers so he's not completely invincible as he so often appears in the comics.
Yes, there's some cheesy dialogue, but for the most part the stories are very well written with a nice plot line that they don't have any problem extending over two, three, or even four episodes if it really needs that much development.

My daughter likes the show for the action and because she thinks Lois is really cool how she stands up for herself.

2153096,4,B0002ZMHX6,"Definitely much livelier than season 1. (More people in background and background music.) While there are occasional filler episodes that would feel right at home with the 1940's Superman cartoon (The Prometheon and Monkey Fun) as well as a few snoozers/half hearted episodes (Action Figures,  Double Dose, both Edward Lytener episodes), it expands the Superman/DC roster (Dr. Fate, The Flash, Orion, Steel, Batman, and Supergirl to name a few) and features some episodes a slightly mature audience would appreciate (Brave New Metropolis, The Late Mr. Kent, and my personal favorite, Apokolips...Now! 1 & 2.) while containing fun and charming episodes in Mxyzpixilated and Bizarro's World. Other note worthy episodes are Blasts From The Past 1 & 2, Livewire (not a character for everyone), Identity Crisis, and Father's Day.

Superman was not as powerful as in the comic books, but he was powerful enough to defeat his enemies. This series showed the softer side of Kal-El. First, he was Clark Kent. Then, he was Superman. Bruce Timm is a genious, and I believe that his decision to include Jack Kirby's creation, The New Gods, specially Darkseid, in the first season was a brilliant decision by Mr Timm and his collaborators.

2153164,5,B0002ZMHX6,This was a quality show right along with Batman. The funny thing is that even with all that super speed Superman never really learned how to duck or just move to the left by a foot to avoid getting hit. Took way too many hits which probably ended his career early like what is happening with RGIII.,1439164800,,298,4.245614035087719

Since I knew that I would never be a cable or satellite tv subscriber, my patience paid off in waiting for the episode volumes to come in at an attractive price point that wouldn't break the bank.

2153423,4,B0002ZMHX6,"This show is really great for its time. There are no ""reset episodes"" (as I call them), which is surprising for such an old show.  There's nothing that turns me off of a series more than when the good guy(s) win at the end of each episode and then the next episode is a different plot without any continuity to the episodes before.  ""Character development"" alone is not sufficient continuity for me; I like plot continuity -- and this Superman series has that:  recurring characters, persistant story arcs, and concequential actions.

Not saying this is a perfect show.  Some of the animation is cheesy, but that can be somewhat overlooked due to the time period.  Also, some of the major action scenes can come off a bit corny.  One thing I didn't like was how easily Superman is matched by various foes.  In one episode, Siperman could not even stop an airplane from crashing-- he was only able to help it into a more gentler crash.  Anyways, I've only seen season 1 completely, and a couple episodes od season 2, but so far it's worth watching.",1412812800,,1047,4.586021505376344

Most surprisingly done was the character of John Corben ""Metallo"" and how he's a villain even more so to Lex Luthor than he is to Superman considering how truly evil Luthor is to strip one's humanity into one of cold unfeeling metal!!

2153489,4,B0002ZMHX6,"As I recall, I wasn't too impressed with ""Superman: The Animated Series"" when it first appeared in the 1990's.  It was a follow-up to the classic ""Batman: The Animated Series"" but it seemed to pale in comparison.  Batman had not had many successful adaptations to comics or film form (unless you're a fan of the camp Adam West TV series, which I'm not) whereas there had been numerous media versions of Superman.  In fact, Superman TAS was competing with a new live-action TV version of the character, ""Lois and Clark"", at the same time.  The only Superman TAS episodes that really left much impression the first time around were those in which Superman played host to other DC Comics characters who had not appeared in animated form up to then-- Jack Kirby's New Gods and Darkseid, Green Lantern (who appeared in the Superman episode ""In Brightest Day"" as a kind of weird blending of two GL incarnations, Hal Jordan and Kyle Rayner) and the Legion of Super-Heroes, among others.
I've re-watched most of the Superman TAS episodes since then, though, and they hold up better than I remembered, even the ones featuring only Superman and his regular cast of friends and foes with no guest stars.  The characterization of the regular characters is solid (though it's a little annoying that Lois Lane almost never seems to change clothes), and the stories are usually entertaining.  Superman does come across as kind of clueless occasionally, as in an episode I just watched. ""Blasts From the Past,"" in which he releases a Phantom Zone criminal. Mala (her sentence has expired) without any advance precautions to keep her under control if she goes renegade with her Kryptonian super-powers.  But then, Supes in the comics and all media has these occasional ""what was he thinking"" moments.  So if you are a Superman fan who hasn't encountered this particular version of the character, it's worth taking a look at..  .",1401667200,,1911,4.8734567901234565

Of the recurring villains, I think Mxyzptlk was my favorite. Superman's tricks to get him back into the Fifth Dimension were different from what I remember in the comics.

theatrical shorts. I look back fondly on ""The Adventures Of Superman"" starring George Reeves. As a child I was blown away seeing Chris Reeve taking the character to new heights. And yes; for the first time we could finally believe that a man could fly!  And now we come to this incredibly perfect adaption of everyone's favorie Man Of Steel. I am no fan of what they've been doing with Superman in the recent films. I was forced out by family to see the forgetable and extremely awful ""Superman Returns"". And I don't even want to know that the newest Superman film; ""The Man Of Steel"" even exists. Leave it to say, being a lifetime true comic fan of Superman, I highly recommend this amazing and wonderful ""tribute"" to the father of all superheroes. The brilliance of Bruce Timm, Paul Dini, Alan Burnett, and all the rest behind this fantastic show should really get a standing ovation. Certainly a show for young and old. I have all three seasons and think I'll start watching them all over again.
p.s. To all those young ""hot shot"" producers & directors in Hollywierd who really want to give us all a live-action Superman film to remember, they should really use ""The Adventures Of Superman"", ""Superman The Movie"", and ""Superman: The Animated Series"" as a guide & blue print.

2153582,2,B0002ZMHX6,"This series is too violent. Compared to Batman the Animated Series, Superman uses a lot more muscle and force instead of his mind. It's kind of hard for superman to do something other than use physical force considering the powers he has, but too many of the episodes are just stretched out fight scenes between superman and some other undestructable foe. In this series, Superman and his villans will just fight and blow things up until one of them goes away or gets tired. Even though as a whole, I did not like this series, there were a few gems in the series including the Late Mr. Kent and Apokolips Now. If your looking for an action packed television series with not very much of a story then this is what your looking for. If your looking for a good superhero tv series with a great story then watch Batman the Animated series volumes 1 through 3.

Great Music Score

This show went back to a time when Superman couldn't push a planet out of orbit, or fly so fast he could change time. Yes there was a time when a rocket to the chest would hurt Superman folks. Lex Luthor was o villian sure, but not one that molded the Man of Steel's life comic to comic. This show made Superman a super man with some limitations to keep a story believable.

Bruce Timm served as one of the series producers and he duplicates the look of the 1940's Superman.  I love the art deco and the new take on his origin story.  If you like your super hero cartoons light and family friendly this is the ultimate in animation.  I only wish it could have gone on for a few more seasons before it went off the air.  I much prefer this version than any Superman live action movie.  This one is true to it's comic book roots and has heart. If I were a producer or had a say so in the direction of the franchise, I'd keep Superman where he is at his best, in the animated world!",1346889600,,686,4.014705882352941
2153596,5,B0002ZMHX6,"This review won't be very visual since I've been blind since birth, but here's hoping I can still convince you to make this purchase.  I had missed watching this series when I was a kid since we didn't get the WB for the longest time.  My little brother was nuts for it back in the late 90's.  I do remember seeing the first 2 parts of the pilot when I was visiting him in Memphis and loving them.  So it was a treat when WB released this in 2005. This volume comprises the first 18 episodes of the series.  We're introduced to Superman in the 3 part pilot, The Last Son of Krypton.  And we're also introduced to memorable villains like Lex Luthor, Brainiac, and the dreaded Darkseid.  Give this series a chance if you've got a few extra bucks lying around.

  This is so much better than the Superman movies.  I think it's a great deal more serious, and with a darker Lex Luthor.  I just couldn't take the mad scientist version of him seriously, but Clancy Brown does a wonderful job of voicing and introducing a new take on the character.  Lex doesn't go around throwing kryptonite at Superman every chance he gets like we've seen in the live action films.  He is more suttle in this hit series.  He's a devious and successful businessman who owns half of Metropolis, and he gets away with just about everything.  Great move by the writers.  I'm sure it was done in the comics first,but since I am totally blind, I couldn't tell you anything about that.

  Another thing I enjoyed about these episodes was the way some of them built on each other.  For instance, we're introduced to a very important villain in an episode called Tools of The Trade which is included in this set.  The writers leave fans who have never read the Superman comics wanting to know more, and they certainly deliver in episodes further down the line.  They also treat Brainiac, who is introduced in the 3 part pilot, in similar fashion.  But like I said, they always deliver.

  As far as bonus material goes, we're treated to a few episode commentaries and a featurette focusing on the origins of this animated series.  It kept me entertained for hours when I picked this set up in mid 2005.  So if you've never seen this show and aren't wanting to risk purchasing the complete series, try the first 18 episodes.  It's a perfect gift for people of all ages since shows from the DC Animated Universe were designed to please just about everyone.",1343088000,3,2422,4.488532110091743
2153597,5,B0002ZMHX6,"My only problem is that the season is split into volumes.  I'd rather have it all in one shot. As well, there are so many versions of the Superman mythos ... Yet, this collection is still so very refreshing to watch.",1334793600,,216,4.2682926829268295

2153600,4,B0002ZMHX6,"The 1996 WB Superman animated series doesn't get the respect it should, but that's probably because it followed on the heels of the massively successful (and dark) Batman: The Animated Series, which brought the character of Batman back to his dark, mobster-and-villain-fighting roots. Superman: The Animated Series, however, re-established the Man of Steel as the quintessential blue boy scout, and with the voice talents of Tim Daly and Dana Delany, was the best representation of the character in animated form or otherwise since the first two Superman movies in 1978 and 1980.

Yes, the animation is a little dated by 2011 standards, and sometimes the dialogue is as well, but this set, as well as the entire series, has many well-written episodes and guest voice actors, usually people who would later become much bigger stars in their own right (Brad Garrett voices DC fan favorite Lobo, and Brian Cox lends a voice or two as well). Amazon has this for less than $10 right now, so it's a great purchase to help you relive your own childhood or for your own children.",1310342400,,1071,4.884615384615385
2153601,4,B0002ZMHX6,"This DVD set includes the first 18 episodes of ""Superman: The Animated Series"". Lets get the bad points over with first. ""Superman: The Animated Series"" isn't as realistic as ""Batman: The Animated Series"". One of the things the creator's wanted to do with ""Batman"" was make it realistic. For the most part they had realistic stories and realistic animation. ""Superman: The Animated Series"" has more off-the-wall stories in them, and the animation isn't as good - although the animation is still better than most cartoons. And by off-the-wall stories, I mean more sci-fi stories. I know that ""Superman"" is suppose to be a sci-fi, but they could have at least had more down-to-earth villains in them every once in a while. The three-part pilot ""The Last Son of Krypton"" is also slightly edited. For the unedited version you have to buy it separately from the rest of the series.

On the plus side most of the episodes are still good and entertaining, the villains (although they are sci-fi villains) are still entertaining and are challenging opponents for the Man of Steel, and the actors are brilliant!

Highly recommended!

The exciting stories of Superman (voiced by same actor across the major animated DC series --- love the consistency) told with great art, stories, and voice actors.  I actually rather liked Lois in this one (most times I just think how Superman deserves someone better.)",1287619200,,455,4.6625
2153603,5,B0002ZMHX6,"Another great Warner Brothers treatment of a DC character.  Like the animated Batman series that preceded it, these cartoons pack a lot of story and action into 22 minutes, and the show runners don't shy away from presenting an episode in two or even three parts when they feel the story warrants it.  Standout episodes include ""The Last Son of Krypton"" (a three-part telling of the origin story), ""The Way of All Flesh"" (introducing Metallo), ""Blasts from the Past"" (Superman releases two criminals from the Phantom Zone), and ""Speed Demons"" (guest-starring the Flash).",1276128000,,570,5.118279569892473
2153604,4,B0002ZMHX6,"I watched the animated BATMAN with my daughter when she was a small child, when it was coming out for the first time.  I recently watched the Justice League cartoons that were done by largely the same people.  I should have watched SUPERMAN before watching JUSTICE LEAGUE and JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED, and so should you if you haven't seen them all yet.  SUPERMAN, like BATMAN, is not at all a bad show.  It is, in fact, a very decent one.  The problem is that the Justice League shows are extraordinary and they make all of the others look weak in comparison.  On the other hand, watching SUPERMAN after JUSTICE LEAGUE really brings how brilliant the latter truly was and how much both the writing and the animation techniques improved as they worked on it.

Still, SUPERMAN is all in all a pretty decent cartoon series.  While the writing isn't nearly as strong or as innovative as the writing on JUSTICE LEAGUE would be, it was still quite above normal for children's programming and the voice talent, like all of the DC cartoon shows, is top notch.  It is all quite watchable, but I never, ever got the sense that I was watching something remarkable as I did with JL.

I also did not care much for the general ""dumbbing down"" of the DC stories.  And some of the revisions of traditional DC storylines were unnecessary and arbitrary.  For instance, they do a Green Lantern origins episode in Season Three, several traditional elements are changed.  Abin Sur is shown as having been pursued by Sinestro, whereas in most origins stories Abin Sur is deeply upset at the death of his colleague.  And Sinestro is shown already a fully blown bad guy upon the selection of the earthling Green Lantern for Section 2814.  The successor of Abin Sur is in this version Kyle Raynor, while there is a bizarre nod to the original Green Lantern, Hal Jordan in the episode.  Why Kyle Raynor instead of Hal Jordan?  Perhaps because Jordan's back story as a test pilot is too well established, while it was easier to work with Raynor?  It was all just odd and I'm confused at nearly all of the narrative choices in this particular episode.  But the same kind of oddness afflicts several episodes.  Not to beat too often on the same drum, but these kinds of changes were much better handled in the later JL series.

I don't recommend skipping this episode, but I definitely recommend watching the three DC series in the order that they were made, BATMAN, then SUPERMAN, and then JUSTICE LEAGUE.  While the first two series are of a similar quality, the third grew into something truly special.",1249603200,,2577,4.642384105960265

I am disappointed.

DVD Technical quality is very good and the stories are interesting but I cannoy see why Americans ( who practically invented the comic and animated cartoon genres) have to resort to this Japanese drawing style.

In my opinion it is just ugly, do not communicate that American way of life Superman is all about and I just feel uneasy while watching the DVD. This marketing obsession about up-dating classics like Superman takes more out that it puts in.

In short, I did not like this DVD's and will pay a lot more of attention next time I think in buying American icons made outside America. If I had wanted Japanese animation i'd have bought Mazinger adventures.",1209772800,2,880,4.658064516129032

Volume one of this series brought a good basis to the Man of Steel.  The shows in the first season showed us how intricate the animators version of Metropolis, the intricacies of the fight scenes, and they didn't overuse the kryptonite.  Everyone knows Supes is weak to the rock, but you can't use it all the time.  Throughout the series they show his battle with stronger foes, overwhelming odds, and magic.  The team up with the newly designed 4th season Batman was also stunning.  Anything made by Bruce Timm and his group has been done well, so I highly recommend the entire Superman series and the rest of the DCAU (DC Animated Universe).",1208908800,,799,4.705035971223022

The kids started watching Superman, and that was it, he was hooked.  The series is voiced by a whole slew of incredible voice talent including Tim Daly, Dana Delaney, Mark Hamill, Clancy Brown, Malcolm MacDowall, Kevin Conroy, just to name a very few.  The animation and color palettes are great, very comic book true to life, only better.  The storylines are great with nice continuity from one episode to another.  Dialogue is often understated but hilarious (a great example was in ""Father's Day"" Season two when the Kent's go to a restaurant to have lunch with Lois and one of the bad guys shows up and starts busting up the place.  Jonathan says very quietly, ""That guy needs to be taken down a peg.""  Very funny moment in the scene as we all know that he knows that Clark/Superman will be along momentarily to do just that).

2153613,5,B0002ZMHX6,"Bruce Timm created a magnificent television series about the iconic ""Man of Steel"". He also created Batman: The Animated Series, but that is another story. This great television show premiered in 1996, and ran for three seasons, even though it should have lasted longer. It starred the wonderful voice talents of Tim Daly and Dana Delaney as the main cast, Clancy Brown, Brad Garrett, Lori Petty, Corey Burton and many others as the frequent guest stars. In this volume one DVD set of ""Superman: The Animated Series"", there is not one episode that is better than another. I did think that there were some that were great and some that were good, but after watching all the episodes again, I have realized that this was a great show, and all the episodes were awesome. While some of the episodes do not have as good of a storyline, cast of characters, or a sequence of high-flying action like the other episodes, this does not matter, because when viewed as a whole series, from beginning to end, and considering the scope and imagination of the entire series' three season run, there is not one episode that is better than any other.

2153614,4,B0002ZMHX6,"i give this dvd box sets 1 out 4 I Hate double sided dvds i rather pay an extra 10 dollars Not to have a double sided dvd other than that terrible option through out the set its great if you superman series fan if it was not for the double sided dvd crap i would have gave the rating a 5 or more.

i like looking at the art on the dvd or cd not flip ove the dvd and clean both sides of the coin if it has dust on it and it won't play because of it.",1194220800,,448,3.48
2153615,3,B0002ZMHX6,"The show itself gets 5 stars; however, beware of the dvd packaging. One of the disks is one of those double sided disks that companies include to save money on a third disk. They are very annoying because both sides contain a data and can easily get scratched.",1187136000,4,260,4.4375
2153616,4,B0002ZMHX6,"Superman the Animated series is Similar to the Batman one. All the episodes are enjoyable and the DVD contains commentary on key episodes. This version of Superman is a little different than in the movies. He is a lot weaker in this version and not as strong. I don't like that here in the series Braniac is a Supercomputer from Krypton. I also don't like  some parts of the series because Superman fights robots and droids too much. Overall,this is a fun cartoon to watch and a good buy.",1184544000,,488,4.48314606741573
2153617,4,B0002ZMHX6,The DVD is very nice and must have but what you should now is that if you Superman season one don't buy Superman son of Krepton (included in season one). It is a waste of money! Also if you have Superman season 2 don't buy Superman Batman the movie (included in season 2)!Take care and don't waste your money like I did! At least amazone should mention this if WB don't care!,1179014400,,375,4.222222222222222
2153618,5,B0002ZMHX6,"I still remember when this animated series was made and I fell in love with it since the first episode. This animated series comes on two disks with 18 episodes that has the Man of Steel battling aliens, giant robots, super computers, and his biggest rival of all, Lex Luthor! The action is great, especially in some of the episodes, and the voice casting for the characters was done really well. Add some extras to this disk set and you have a series that anyone of any age will enjoy!

Disk 1:

The Last Son of Krypton, Part 1: On an alien world called Krpton, a scientist named Jor-El realizes that the world is about to end and desperately tries to get the supreme council to evacuate the entire world. However the Supreme Council instead listens to Brainiac, a diabolical computer designed to collect the information about all the planets in the solar system, and also has intentions of letting Krpton be destroyed. Jor-El's pleas go to deaf ears and as the world ends the only survivor is Jor-El's son, who escapes on a spaceship sent to earth.

The Last Son of Krypton, Part 2: On earth, Kal-El [Jor-El's son] learns his alien heriatage from his adopted parents. Now knowing why he has all these special abilities Clark Kent is born and moves into the huge city of Metropolis to make a living as a newspaper reporter as well as saving people in times of need as Superman!

The Last Son of Krypton, Part 3: Lex Luthor, a powerful billonaire, sees Superman as a threat to running the city and hires a man named John Corban to attack superman in a huge robotic machine. [This won't be the last time you will see Corban in the series]

Fun and Games: Toyman, a deranged inventor inside a dummy suit, wants revenge for the murder of his father and its up to Superman to stop him. Really creepy ending to this episode.

A Little Peice of Home: During a robbery attempt at a museum, Superman comes across a strange rock called kryptonite which mysteriously weakens him. That is all the evidence needed for Lex Luthor to take hold of the rock and use it to try and kill Superman.

Feeding Time: A man named Rudy, who is in a low dead end job, is exposed to chemicals which turn him into a being that can absorb memories, strength, and knowledge of anyone that he touches, including Superman!

Disk 2 Side A

The Way of All Flesh: John Corban returns as he is about to be let free from jail, only to realize that he has been exposed to a virus that must lead to an operation to save his life. Lex Luthor then transforms him into Metallo, a cyborg like being with krptonite serving as his heart and power. A war then erupts with Corban and Superman.

Stolen Memories: Brainiac returns, this time showing up at Earth, and asks Superman to join him in exchange for memories and secrets of Krypton. However doubts follow superman and it isn't long before he discovers Brainiac's secrets.

The Main Man, Part 1: A bounty hunter named Lobo is hired by a collector of rare species to bring superman into his collection. This leads to a wild fight on earth and in space as both Superman and Lobo himself is double crossed and placed in the collector's habitat.

The Main Man, Part 2: Lobo and Superman now must team up to escape the collector and get back to safety. This leads to a huge showdown in the collector's giant spaceship involving other bounty hunters and dangerous rare species of aliens [my two favorite episodes!]

My Girl: A woman named Lana Lang, an old flame of Clark Kent's, shows up in Metropolis as Lex Luthor's new girlfriend. However Luthor realizes that lang is also mysteriously linked to Superman and decides to kill her in order to draw Superman into a trap.

Tools of the Trade: A criminal and his gang called Intergang are given weapons by a mysterious supplier who in turn works for one of Superman's most hated rivals, Darkside.

Two's a Crowd: A bomb maker is in a coma and has a bomb hidden in Metropolis somewhere. Superman has to resort to getting help from an enemy of his past in order to find the bomb before it is too late!

The Prometheon: A huge creature crashes on Earth and causes havoc by absorbing raw heat and attacking anything in its past. Superman must find a way to stop it before all of Metropolis is completely destroyed!

Disk 2 Side B:

Blasts from the Past [2 epsiodes] Superman discovers the Phantom Zone, where two krptonian criminals are being kept. Superman lets them out but soon realizes his big mistake after the two beings realize they can rule Earth after becoming as powerful as Superman.

Livewire: A woman with a loud mouth gets turned into a being of pure electricity in a huge accident. Blaming Superman for her transformation, Livewire as she now wants to be called is determined to destroy superman at all cost.

Speed Demon: The Flash, the first of the Justice League superheroes that shows up, challenges Superman to a race around the world. While they are racing the two superheroes realize a plot by someone called the Weather Wizard who wants to take over the world!

Extras include:

Superman, Learning to Fly: Tells about the creation of the series

Building the Mythology: A look at all the supporting characters that help make Superman, the Animated Series, what it is today!

This is definately recommended, a good voice cast, great action, and a lot of drama makes this a great series to get in to! highly recommended!",1175904000,,5389,4.566390041493776
2153619,5,B0002ZMHX6,"What more can you say about a cartoon that was so well written, it won an emmy!?! AN EMMY for crying out loud! This award is given only to sitcoms such as Seinfeld(well deserved), Everybody Loves Raymond(also well deserved) and yeah..Friends(not so deserved). Bare in mind that this Superman, the animated series, came out at a time when everyone thought Superman was basically dead. Mainly because they had him brutally killed, beaten to death in the comics, by a character named Doomsday! Man was there publicity written all over the newspapers about it. From the Daily News, The New York Post, maybe even The NY Times. All were discussing how Superman, a hero that was basically indestructable, was beaten to death, in an epic battle that will go down in comic book history! I have to admit though, as hard as it was to see Superman dead, the story was well written and it was spread out to 2 different comics, Action comics and Superman, the Man of steel. I wonder if the story had anything to do with the fact that it was written by a woman who was writing for the Superman comic series at the time. Not sure if she's there anymore...I wonder why...Anyways, getting back to Superman, TAS, this series is a MUST BUY for anyone and I mean anyone, who enjoys a really well written and directed cartoon. (Can we really say ""well directed"" when we're talking about a tv cartoon?) It doesn't matter. This one is so well written that even my wife, who doesn't really care for such cartoons, was practically glued to the TV with me and my son, who's now 6. Yeah, it's a little too violent for any kid under the age of 5 so I wouldn't try to expose him/her to some of the violence in this cartoon. Unless of course, you want to see him flying from one couch to the other, and coming close to breaking your favorite Lava Lamp. I bought all 3 volumes which covers the entire run of Superman, TAS and I wasn't disapointed AT ALL!! This cartoon is like watching a mini movie and judging by some of the movies out there now, this cartoon by far, is SOOOOOO much more interesting and much better to watch. I guess they had to bring people back to believing in Superman after he was given such a horrible death in the comics. DC probably couldn't afford to loose one of it's biggest money makers not only in comics but in movies as well. Superman was so loved by millions of people, myself included, that they had to bring him back somehow, in the way people remembered him. And what a way to bring him back to life. It's shame that the cartoon only lasted for 3 or 4 years, from 1996 to I think 1999. But keep in mind that it also came on the heals of another great cartoon series, the Batman, TAS which by the way, was also written by the same writers as Superman, TAS. These cartoons are so good that once you put the first DVD, of Superman TAS, Volume one, you won't be able to stop watching the other DVD, as 2 DVDs come in each volume, which is 18 episodes in total! To be honest, I almost spent an entire day watching Volume 1 before I even realized,""man it's almost 6:00 PM""! But I watched it anyway..(c'mon, there was only 3 episodes left!) I haven't watched all 3 volumes yet, but believe me when I tell you that this cartoon is very addictive! It made me feel like a kid again and I'm 44 years old!! It's been a looong time since I watched a cartoon that was this good, and honestly, it's better than any cartoon that I've ever seen in the past. Simply put, THIS CARTOON SET IS ONE OF THE BEST BUYS I HAVE EVER MADE. I intend on buying the Batman, TAS also as well as the Justice League. These are cartoons that were made way ahead of their time. They are for the true superhero fans. They show how powerful your favorite Superheroes really are, and the battle scenes are excellent, just like the comics...maybe even better. So do yourselves a favor, buy the first volume of Superman, TAS and believe me, you'll probably be running back to your computer to buy the other 2 volumes as well. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!",1173398400,,4026,4.3693333333333335
2153620,3,B0002ZMHX6,"Our 8-year-old daughter found this show too violent (it has guns).  If your children like superheroes and are this age, try Kim Possible or Teen Titans.",1168300800,6,152,4.846153846153846
2153621,5,B0002ZMHX6,Same as before when it came to the other volumes.  Superman is a great thoughout character.,1168300800,,91,4.6875
2153622,4,B0002ZMHX6,"The same team who produced Batman: The Animated Series really let their hair down with this. Where the former is dark, this is light; where Batman is set in an imagined noir-deco past, this is what tomorrow might be like; where one focuses on psychology, this punches you with action. The first three episodes are basically the first hour of Donner's Superman done about five hundred times better. Krypton is more than a two-dimensional ice-planet, and the creators' one superb twist is to make Brainiac a Kryptonian Super-computer. While most episodes stand alone, they flesh out the superman universe and remain consistent with subsequent stories. Generally, the supporting characters are excellent, including a detective magnificently modelled on Jack Kirby. Indeed, Kirby looms large in many of the character and monster designs. Lois is plucky, but essentially she's sidelined as an annoying meddler for most the season. The villains, though, are the focus, and they're consistently excellent and worthy of superman, especially Lobo who appears in a spectacular two-parter. An assured, respectful yet original addition to the canon, and still the best version on screen (inc. Singer's).",1159056000,,1191,5.408602150537634
2153623,5,B0002ZMHX6,This is a great set. The episodes are well written and the animation is fantastic. The bright colours and simple lines of the show make it a pleasure to watch. Definitely worth buying.,1155859200,2,184,4.606060606060606
2153624,5,B0002ZMHX6,"as far as comic book hero cartoons Warner Brothers truly made an amazing product, Clancy Brown as Lex Luthor, and many famous actors making most of the voices, Metalo is the guy from Clock Work Orange, and many many more

a class A super production",1155427200,,248,4.511111111111111
2153625,4,B0002ZMHX6,"Admittedly, I've never been a huge fan of Superman but I respect both his place in American pop culture and the fact that without him, guys like Batman, Spider-Man and others may not have existed! When the animated series first came out in 1996, I was in college but having watched the incredible BatMan: The Animated Series, this one seemed a bit of a letdown so I didn't pay attention to it for most of its run! WHAT A MISTAKE I MADE FOR DOING THAT! While I still prefer Batman: TAS or even Justice League, Superman: TAS is great in its own right with good animation and even better story telling! Here is the rundown of Volume 1:

Disc 1

Having watched this whole thing, I have to say I am sorry now that I didn't give Superman much of a chance while it aired! Still, this makes up for that lost time! Enjoy!",1153526400,4,5223,4.57556270096463
2153626,4,B0002ZMHX6,"I only caught a few episodes of this Superman series when it aired on television and liked what I saw.  I recently purchased this volume 1 collection of Superman The Animated Series and really enjoyed most of the episodes.  I've been a long time Superman fan ever since I can remember and still am today.  I pretty much collect any animated superhero series and could not wait to get my hands on this series.  I recently bought volume 2 and plan to buy volume 3.  As a Superman and comic book fan I must say this is a must own series.  Ten years old and still strong today...stronger than Ultimate Avengers animation.  Like all series though there are stand out episodes and then there are some that are fillers with no meaning to the main story.  I particularly disliked the episodes with Lobo as they felt more childish than usual.  This series is certainly for children and adults alike.  Some of the more fun episodes are:

The Last Son of Krypton (3 part story)

Tools of the Trade

Speed Demons

The Way of the Flesh

Overall a nicely done series and highly recommended for any Superman fan.  Makes a good additon to any comic book movie/television/animated library.  Could of done without the double sided second disc.

A loyal fan.",1152576000,,1239,4.579908675799087

If YES, or even if NO - buy this Superman box-set! The writers are the same from the Batman show, even though the characters are different. Trust me, if it's a Timm/Dini product...it's worth buying!!!

The DC Comics Animated Universe rocks!!!!!",1150329600,4,2457,4.5600907029478455
2153628,5,B0002ZMHX6,"When I purchused the first volume of this series last summer, I didn't know what to expect.  I had watched Batman the Animated series on a daily basis when I was a kid, but I don't think we got the Wb so I missed this one.  It was absolutely amazing!  The difference between Batman and Superman Animated series is that Superman gets a three part pilot.  If fans are looking for a series that has a bit more of an ongoing story arc, then this is the one for you.  Several great episodes here.  The pilot especially.  Fans also get to see Superman and the Flash team up to defeat the Weather Wizard.  Not a particularly memorable villian in my opinion, but an interesting combination of heros.  Fans are also introduced to Intergang as well as Darkseid, ruler of the planet Apocalypse.  I hoped for a more menacing Lex Luthor than that which I'd seen in Super Friends, and I wasn't let down.  Clancy Brown is perfect for the role of the character.  I could go on for hours and brag about this series, but you check it out for yourself.  My only complaint is not being able to get the fight sceens described to me.  Other viewers are so blown away that they forget stuff like descriptions.  A great series, though.  I'd give it 10 stars if they let me!",1145059200,2,1249,4.341991341991342
2153629,5,B0002ZMHX6,"After working on the much praised Batman animated series, the creators decided to take their attention and focus(actually split in 2) as they started working on a Superman animated show, at roughly the same time they did more Batman shows. While many people say Batman is the superior one, Superman is nonetheless entertaining with a brighter color palette, interesting storylines, fan favorite characters and of course Ol' Blue Man of Steel.

Disc 1

The Last Son of Krypton Part 1: Jor-El learns of Krypton's quickly approaching destruction and must evacuate his only son Kal-El 9/10

The Last Son of Krypton Part 2: Part Smallville segment/Metropolis segment with the introduction of Superman. 9/10

The Last Son of Krypton Part 3: Superman has to stop Lex's plan of selling a powerful metal suit to terrorists. 9/10

Fun and Games: Superman has to save Lois from an odd villain known as the Toyman. Kinda bad but it's ok. 7/10

A Little Piece of Home: The introduction of kryptonite which doesn't bode well for Superman, especially when Lex found out its effects on him. 8/10

Feeding Time: A criminal's pathetic lackey turns into a (personally) lame villain known as Parasite. 7.5/10

Disc 2 Side A

The Way of All Flesh: John Corben, last seen as Lex's suit operator, undergoes a transformation into Metallo which results in an unfortunate side effect. 8.5/10

Stolen Memories: One of my favorite villains as Brainiac comes to Earth under the guise that he's providing knowledge of the cosmos. 9/10

The Main Man Part I: An intergalactic bounty hunter, Lobo, is hired to capture Superman. 8/10

The Main Man Part II: Lobo and Superman have to deal with Lobo's employer together.

My Girl: Lana Lang shows up and knows Clark's dual identity which she tries to help with which puts her in harm's way. 8/10

Tools of the Trade: The mysterious Kanto shows up with weapons of great power, all coming from an even more dangerous source. It's basically a big 7.5 for the episode but a full point up for the ending.

Two's a Crowd: A guy with a bomb holds the city ransom and ends up in my least favorite villain so far: yep, Parasite. 7/10

The Prometheon: A meteor is heading for Earth but something odd is attached to it and Superman must defeat it. 7.5/10

Disc 2 Side B

Blast from the Past Part 1: Superman discovers the Phantom Zone and releases Mara which wasn't a good idea. 8/10

Blast from the Past Part 2: Superman squares off against Mara and Jax-Ur and tries to bring them back to the Phantom Zone. 8.5/10

Livewire: A Superman-hating disk jockey turns into Livewire, a vixen who loves electricity and, of course, hates Superman. 8/10

Speed Demons: The Flash and Superman have a race for charity but a very lame villain comes in to wreck things.

In the commentary for an episode, they mention Batman has the best Rogues Gallery ever. Superman on the other hand besides series favorites Lex, Metallo, Bizarro, Lobo, Brainiac and so on, there's not much else so they added some villains and the Weather Wizard from Speed Demons is quite lame even if his ""power"" is threatening. Livewire is a nice addition and it's great to see Darkseid in an incredibly brief cameo. And like I said, I HATE Parasite for some reason and we get him twice! Actually volume 2 has another one with him, go me.

Transfer-wise the set is disappointing. Just like in the Batman sets, the image wasn't cleaned up so you get scratches and dust and a funny blur on the characters sometimes. Quickly move your mouse back and forth. Notice the trail it leaves? Well it happens a few times in the show. The voice acting is great with Tim Daly as our Superman, Dana Delany as Lois Lane(not to mention Dana is insanely hot), Michael Ironside, Lori Petty, Brad Garrett in duel roles, Christopher Macdonald, Corey Burton and Michael York.

It's disappointing that this set doesn't have more episodes other than its 18 but it's pretty fun episodes anyways, even if it doesn't reach the heights of Batman.",1143417600,3,3981,4.727930535455861
2153630,4,B0002ZMHX6,"Not a bad introduction to the Superman adventures.

Unfortunately continues the artists' habit of exaggerating the difference between men's and women's bodies to the point of Super Hulk & Micro Lois. Still, if you overlook that, there's good plots and character development, and listen for the great soundtrack music in ""A little Piece of Home.""

Warner, keep it up and give us complete season 3 on DVD soon.",1141776000,,408,4.985294117647059
2153631,3,B0002ZMHX6,"We bought this for our kids, because it has a french language track. My kids all love the DVDs, but I have to admit that the double-sided DVD is a very bad idea. There is no way to protect one side or the other. I just ""repaired"" side B, and hopefully it will work again. Of course, my oldests favorite episode was the one that was scratched & damaged. I think they could have splurged a little on the cost and given us 3 DVDs.",1140652800,3,427,4.035294117647059

For aficionados of the animated superhero sub-genre, it is a worthwhile addition to any collection (baring in mind that you'll find better writing and animation in some of the other licensed DC material), that is if you can find a copy that actually works the way it is supposed to!

2153634,5,B0002ZMHX6,"I was major comic book maniac as a kid, and collected just about everything from Marvel and DC between the years of 1971 and 1980.  My interests changed as I grew older, so I sort of left the comics behind.  I was vaguely aware of this series back in the day when it was current.  I recalled seeing ""The Main Man"" back in 1996 when it was released.  However, I never really got into the series until this year when I subscribed to satalight TV for the first time and began watching the series on Boom.  Now I am utterly hooked.  I bought this DVD collection and I am about 2/3rds through it.  I'm loving every minute of it.

This is one of several great series with which Warner Brothers laid the ground work for the awesome ""Justice League Unlimited"" series currently running on Cartoon Network.  This series is very accurate.  Fidelity to the comic book is pretty high.  They made some changes with Braniac which are quite fundimental to the Superman story, but these were good strong changes which drastically enhance this villain.

This cartoon constitutes a huge blast from the past for me, and it reminded me of why I idolized Superman as a youth.  For all of you out there who hate the schlocky Christopher Reeve Superman and the weak-arse Lois and Clark series, this is the cartoon you want to watch.  I just wish they would release volume 2 and give us the origins of Supergirl.

Being so much younger, I enjoyed seeing superman's exploits as he defeated criminals in a variety of ways, and even putting up with the terrible cereal ads that WB played all over their network. However NOW we finally get to see the series in one tidy package. Of course, I would have loved it if this series could have come out at the same time as the New Batman Animated series, which played along with this show back in 1997 (hopefully WB and DC will release that soon as well). But until you can enjoy both at once, relive the greatness that is Superman, and that shaped the Superman we see today in the Justice League show on Cartoon Network, by buying this set.

But with Warner there's always a problem. Here it's the presence of a double-sided disc. In fact, this was supposed to be a 3-disc set ; but they chose to put in 1 single-side disc + 1 double-sided disc. Double-sided discs are much more fragile and sometimes split into 2 unusable discs. The DVD-case is also problematic: it's almost impossible to take out the discs without pulling them hard and risking breaking them (which make the double-sided disc even more fragile). Next time, Warner, make this perfect : put only single-sided discs, in an appropriate package (such as the ones you used for the last Batman TAS sets).",1120694400,18,835,4.839160839160839
2153637,5,B0002ZMHX6,"I know it's not fashionable to call Superman cool, but he is.  The key to Superman is that he's refreshingly down to earth.  The guy has all this power, and in the end, he's just one of us.  Sure, he'll fly off to stop a giant robot from crushing Metropolis, but that's just because he's a good guy.  I'd like to think if I had those powers, I'd be a good guy too.  But I'd probably be a jerk, like nearly all of us.  But not Clark Kent.  You can call him a boyscout if you want, but being honest, good, and helpful aren't such terrible things to be.

On to this series.  It's great.  I wish it had lasted as long as Batman.  It's got the same maturity, the same depth as that series.  It's also got giant robots, alien invaders, weird mutants, and all sorts of super sci fi bad guys to distinguish it from Batman.  Personally, I enjoy both these series immensely for pretty much the same reason.  Great animation.  Great stories.  Great dialogue.  Just great period.

If you're on the edge about the Man of Steel, but you love Batman: the Animated Series, give this a shot.  You'll be glad you did.  And if you're like me and just like Superman because of everything that makes him Superman, buy it.",1118620800,8,1200,4.272321428571429

The animation is great, the stroy plots are excellent and the origin stories tell more than you would learn from any of the previous movies or T.V. shows.  I think this franchise was an excellent idea and had a good run, though why they stopped doing it I'm not sure.  It was second only to the Batman series I think as best comic to TV series of all time.

My only problem is the overdoing of Superman's limitations. Superman should never need a special suit to travel in space or swim underwater. It makes him only sorta kinda superman. Kryptonite, a red sun,and magic are enough weaknesses. Well despite my gripes, I do enjoy watching this. Don't let my gripes be your gripes. I do recommend you get a copy and enjoy.

The shows are en masse in a boxed set, not just a few episodes in a plastic case, so it's environmentally friendly (in keeping with Superman as too good to be true).  The design of the show keeps the humanity of the characters while balancing iconic myth-making with a sort of whimsical fun in a way that I find incredible; I had no idea mainstream stuff could be this well done or this much fun.  I've watched them over again; ok, you don't know how I normally watch films, but that's a good thing.

Supes' supporting cast is nicely done as well, including Dana Delaney and Lois Lane, and his rogue gallery is here full blast as well, including Lex Luthor (Clancy Brown), Metallo (Malcolm McDowell), Brainiac (Corey Burton), Livewire (Lori Petty), and even intergalactic fan favorite Lobo (Brad Garett).

Personally I like Batman better as a character (He has more depth and is a more interesting character), but the Superman series was just done so right from the first season on. Because Bruce Timm and Paul Dini had already perfected the Batman cartoon after years of working on it, Superman didn't need 2 seasons to be perfected.

2153646,4,B0002ZMHX6,"Superman is THE most overdone character in comics history. Movies, toons, TV shows, books, etc it is no wonder we are not sick of him by now... Which is why I give this show praise. It re-invented the character and made him more interesting than he has ever appeared before (until Smallville came along). From this first volume I enjoyed the episodes featuring LiveWire, Parasite, Metallo, Brainiac and the brief introduction to Darkseid. These episodes were all extremely well done and in the same mold as the much superior Batman: The Animated Series. However there are a few clunkers, too. The Prometheon is torture to sit through, as our the ones with the released Phantom Zone inmates and (I know I'm in the minority here) the Lobo episode.

I do have to give much kudos though for the Toyman! What an excellent and frightful interpretation of that character! Bravo! That face/mask alone would give any kid nightmares!

Again, I rate this beneath Batman because the writing and characters seem subpar. In the Batman universe you connect with his villians because each one has an emotional scar (much like Bats himself) that propels them to be who they are. Mr. Freeze and the love for his sick wife, Harley and her obsession with the Joker, Mad Hatter and his quest for love and Ivy and her inability to have children...all of these characters are so muli-dimensional that they make the Superman villians pale in comparison. Lex Luthor is a rich guy who wants power, Brainiac wants to collect information, LiveWire got shocked, Parasite got doused with toxic chemicals, etc. There is no human connection. The only one who remotely achieves this is Metallo.

In all, I cannot wait for volume two!",1106870400,27,1700,4.855172413793103
2153647,5,B0002ZMHX6,"With the latest Big Screen Superman film stuck in seemingly endless mud, Warner at least had the good sense to follow their successful Batman Animated series by giving one to the Man of Steel, and its the best thing that happened to Superman on-screen since Superman 2, even if it is the small screen.

This set collects 18 episodes in all, 13 from season one and 5 from season two.  It features the same great, yet simple animation that made the Batman series so popular, although it's strikingly brighter and the colors bolder than that grittier series.  In the three part opener, We see young kal-El sent to earth before his some planet of Krypton is destroyed.  We see him grow into manhood and go to  Metropolis and assume his role as Superman.  Tim Daly provides the voice of Clark/Superman with Dana Delany as Lois Lane and Clancy Brown (Carnivale) as Lex Luthor.

I'd be hard pressed to say which is my favorite episode but here are a few of them:

""A Little Piece of Home""  Lex Luthor discovers Superman's vulnerability to Kryptonite, and attempts to exploit this weakness to rid himself once and for all of the Man of Steel.

""The Way of All Flesh"" - Lex Luthor poisons a terrorist named John Corben and withholds the antidote until he has extracted a promise: that Corben will become Metallo, a flesh and metal Kryptonite-hearted cyborg with evil intent and no emotions. His only mission is to destroy Superman.

""The Main Man"" - One of DC Comics most popular characters the Intergalactic bounty hunter Lobo is employed to capture the Man of Steel, but thanks to a double-,cross by the rare-species-collecting Preserver, both Superman and Lobo end up trapped in the Preserver's personal zoo.

""Speed Demons""  The Flash guest stars as he and Superman team-up to battle 'The Weather Wizard' who holds Metropolis hostage with the threat of unleashing a killer hurricane.

""Tools of the Trade"" Bruno Mannheim and his Intergang terrorize Metropolis with high-tech weapons supplied by Kanto, an agent of the Darkseid who strikes a devil's bargain with Bruno, leaving him deeply indebted to Darkseid yet well equipped with weapons that can destroy Superman.

The thing so great about both the Supeman and Batman cartoons is seeing guest appearances by so many other characters from the DC comic universe.  This never used to happen in cartoons from way back when.  The stories stick pretty well to comic continuity and really have the look and feel of golden age stories with a modern edge.  Highly recommended!",1106870400,16,2515,4.850117096018735
2153648,5,B0002ZMHX6,"Like the proverbial bolt from the blue, the first season of the
highly-acclaimed SUPERMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES has finally been
gathered onto a 2-disc, 3-sided DVD set; one long awaited by
animation fans, comic page enthusiasts, and lovers of good
solid drama. Its extra featurettes and occasional commentary
adds an extra treat to what is easily one of the most
eagerly-anticipated DVD releases from Warner Home Video.
Amidst a sterling array of cartoon series which distinguished
the 1990s (from THE SIMPSONS to GARGOYLES and more),
the animated SUPERMAN is a standout classic. Fresh from
the success of BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES, the ingenious
energies of Paul Dini, Bruce Timm, Alan Burnett and
associates were focused upon rendering the saga of the
legendary Man of Tomorrow as the serious action-adventure
presentation that SUPERMAN was conceived to be over a
half-century ago.

Rendering SUPERMAN as a serious tale for tube and screen has
been no small order over the years. Consider the various
efforts to trivialize the character, and one can only wonder
how the character can continue to hold full interest and
inspire vehicles as well-struck as the current series
SMALLVILLE, or imaginative movie-makers such as Bryan
Singer, who is currently preparing a long-awaited
blockbuster promising to be as thrilling and evocative as
his pair of X-MEN epics.
From a mid-1960 Gilbert & Sullivan-esque Broadway musical
borne from the camp-ridden hokum of that era's so-called
BATMAN series, and the half-hearted efforts of the SUPERMAN
films of the 1970s and 1980s (hamstringing the superb work
of actor Christopher Reeve), to the even-cheesier camp of
the 1990s LOIS & CLARK series, the presentation of SUPERMAN
on screen has too often been the image of an ineffectual clod
in tights, a lantern-jawed strong man mouthing moral
platitudes which would have embarrassed even Dudley Do
Right.
For all the superlative efforts of Kirk Alyn, George Reeves,
Mr. Reeve (despite lackluster producers), and the Fleischer
brothers in capturing the power and fortitude of the Man
of Steel, the overwhelming image most have of SUPERMAN on
screen is the wooden bilge of SUPER-FRIENDS, its voice
actors mumbling dead lines masking as derring-do, its
studios ripping off American myth & folklore with stolid
four-color blow chow odiously passed-off as ""nostalgia"",
""pure entertainment"" or, perhaps most contemptuously,
""popular culture"".

Thankfully, Mssrs. Dini, Timm, Burnett, Glen Murakami and
crew would have none of this nonsense. The animated SUPERMAN
is a class act from the get-go, its rendition of the legendary
origin a heart-stopper in itself. From its brief-but-telling
look at the planet Krypton (featuring the most chilling
portayal of nemesis Brainiac to date), to the injection of
a young Clark Kent fleetingly wondering if he might be some
sort of freak, ""The Last Son Of Krypton"" delivers the point
of the series' compelling drama for all to see.
In fact, the theme of participation vs. alienation is a
running topic of this saga. Nowhere is this presented more
effectively than in the consistent intolerance of the saga's
arch-nemesis Lex Luthor (superbly voiced by Clancy Brown).
His ominously-smooth tones dripping with snide racism, this
Luthor is the perfect foil to Kal-El's humble tolerance, and
sets the stage for the discomforting paranoia which will
frequently confront SUPERMAN in later episodes (from ""The
Prometheon"" in this collection to  -most exceptionally- the
series' finale in the third season , the gripping ""Legacy"").

As the series' creators created a classic film noir setting
for the animated BATMAN, so do they conceive a Metropolis
whose sun & spires are worthy of the Fritz Lang epic of
the same name. Just like that film's METROPOLIS, the famed
home of SUPERMAN bears its hidden flaws and arrogant
by-products, awaiting the chance to manipulate or usurp
what is best for all.
A superb team of composers delivers an ever-evolving
score which portrays the grandeur and gravity of the
drama as magnificently as the best work of big screen
composers such as John Williams and Danny Elfman. Led
by the amazing Shirley Walker (whose SUPERMAN theme is
among the finest works ever conceived for symphony
orchestra), this team ably continues the grand tradition
of Warner cartoon composer Carl Stalling in their ability
to meld modern thrust and timeless taste into a musical
juggernaut which can sweep you into the heart of the story,
or touch your sensibilities with the delicacy of a feather.
One would hope that Warner and Rhino will finally collect
this work onto a CD collection, especially considering
that the animated SUPERMAN is fast approaching its 10th
anniversary.
Not enough can be said about the voice-acting, easily
among the finest to grace any cartoon. Highest compliments,
once more, to Executive Producer Jean MacCurdy and Voice
Dircetor Andrea Romano for their uncanny ability to
assemble the finest artists around to bring such gripping,
versatile expression to bear in such a consistently
wonderful manner.
I'll leave it to you stalwart readers to discover the vast
array of dramatic talent contained here, but special
mention must go to the lead work of Timothy Daly and Dana
Delany. Daly, best known for his work on WINGS and a brief-
but-well-rendered FUGITIVE series, is exceptional as both
SUPERMAN and Clark Kent; delivering a strong, flexible
heroism and warm, perceptive humanity. None of Dean
Cain's sappy diffidence here.
Likewise, the star of CHINA BEACH and TOMBSTONE brings
home a Lois Lane who's rat-a-tat pro, hapless target,
and vulnerable friend all rolled up in one. Sharp, saucy,
and full of heart, Delany puts Teri Hatcher's bubble-
headed depiction of the intrepid reporter to shame.

Aptly reflecting the finer changes of the DC comic series
since the late 1980s, the classic Fleischer cartoons of
the 1940s, and the thematic wallop of Sequential giant
Jack Kirby, the animated SUPERMAN is a stirring narrative
of awe-inspiring delight. This collection is but the first
of three projected packages, taking the storyline from wit
and peril to pathos and the ability to prevail, from the
deadly whimsy of The Toyman to the mainipulative menace
of Darkseid.

Here is a SUPERMAN to eagerly watch, gain ethical wisdom
from, and heartily enjoy. If, like this reviewer, you've
been waiting almost 10 years for Warner Home Video to get
on the case, the wait is finally over.
If you never saw this series, and your only image of
SUPERMAN is cheesy corn more fitting for UNDERDOG, then
consider yourselves encouraged to begin your re-evaluation
of a major fictional icon here.

2153649,3,B0002ZMHX6,"I was pleased with the content of this DVD.  I think the Superman: TAS, like Batman before it, was a good modern superhero cartoon.  I think it has something to offer Superman fans of all ages.  The stories and characters are simple enough for kids to enjoy as well as rich enough for adults.

What disappoints me is the presentation.  Primarily the DVD navigation.  One chapter is one episode, this doesn't allow one to skip over the opening sequence for episodes.  As episodes are less than a half hour, this makes for a lot of opening sequences in a short period of time.  Furthermore, I am pleased that WB has a play all feature (not all TV episodes offer even that), but I am severely disappointed that when playing all you are forced to sit through not only both opening and closing credits on multi-part episodes, but also the ""Last time on ..."" sequence as well.  I think whoever put this together must not have been thinking.  I OBVIOUSLY know what happened last time because the episode just ended.

If WB would take multi-part episodes and make them run through with no interruption for credits and no ""Last time..."" sequence, I think I would have easily been able to give this review 5 out of 5.  I just hope WB addressed this problem when they release Justice League, because EVERY episode is a multi-part episode.",1106784000,6,1327,4.6

In his quest for truth and justice, Superman will face such powerful enemies as scheming nemesis Lex Luther, the menacing supercomputer Brainiac, high-voltage villainess Livewire and the ruthless bounty hunter Lobo. From the creators of the award-winning ""Batman: TAS"", this enjoyable animated series is the most faithful adaptation of the popular comic book character in recent decades. All episodes contain entertaining storylines, refreshing characters and rousing action. The animation is brighter and more colorful than the unique gothic style in ""Batman: TAS"".

This set collects the first 18 episodes of the Superman animated series (basically a third of the entire series) and tosses in some commentary tracks and other goodies. The thing about the Superman show is that while BTAS was groundbreaking and Batman Beyond/Justice League were heavily promoted, Superman kinda fell by the wayside. The series has always been the middle child of the DC Animated Universe, and had such a brief run on KidsWB that most fans have not seen all the episodes. This is especially unfortunate because the second season of Justice League drew heavily from the Superman rogues gallery and unfinished plot threads started by this show (Darkseid, who appeared in the JL episode ""Twilight"", first appears here in ""Tools of the Trade"".)

This is a pretty solid collection of episodes. The Superman series got a little erratic later on, with bad animation and poor scripts, but the episodes presented here are some of the best. You get first appearances of major Superman villains (Lex Luthor, Darkseid, Metallo, Parasite, Toyman), a hilarious two-parter with the obscene bounty hunter Lobo, and the first animated appearance of the Flash (another JL note: the episode ""Paradise Lost"" borrowed some stock footage from here...see if you can find it!)

In this incarnation, he (Superman) is almost pathetic of how weak in power he is.  I mean you've got to be kidding with some of this stuff of how Superman struggles with or hurt by Part of the appeal of Superman is watching a variety of things just bounce off him. Not here, instead we have a Superman who needs a space suit to go into outer-space, a diving suit to go under water etc...all of this made the series less enjoyable for me cause I felt I wasn't getting the real deal and therefore missing out on untapped potential.

If I didn't know any better I'd say the writers had it in for Superman in this animation series.",1490400000,,1051,4.277777777777778
