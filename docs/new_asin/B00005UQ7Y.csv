1666646,4,B00005UQ7Y,"""The Seagull"", heavy on symbolism and thwarted love in Bohemian rural Russia...why should we care? Because the play shows so clearly so many ways that human beings fail themselves and others. . . so many ways love is leaned on, and then expires...from abuse, misuse, overuse. . . and not understanding the true nature of loving.

We should care because human beings still need lessons on love. Seeing ""The Seagull"" for me is a clarion call to loving just a little bit better.

1666647,4,B00005UQ7Y,"There really isn't a lot to compare this production to, as I don't know of any other filmed versions of ""The Seagull"" available. This is Checkov's third-most-often produced play, after ""Uncle Vanya"" and ""The Cherry Orchard,"" though it is equally powerful, dramatically.
Actors and actresses run, rather than walk, to be cast in Checkov plays. It's easy to understand why, as he consistently wrote scripts that allow for character reinterpretation. His are also wonderfully cadenced lines, even in translation. His plays have depth and weight to them, even though the surface themes may appear ephemeral. ""The Sea Gull"" is no exception.
The reason I can't quite give this production four stars (but I would give it 4 1/2) boils down to personal tastes. I prefer my Checkov, as I prefer my Shakespeare, performed by British casts. Something about the training, and the innate ability to get at the essence of a character more convincingly. As American casts go, however, this one is nothing to sneeze at. A look at the roster will show you that these are all actors that have had a marked impact on the Broadway stage. This is a well staged, thoughtfully directed production, and is the best representation available to the home audience.",1046304000,28,1236,4.975845410628019
1666648,4,B00005UQ7Y,"The actress Blythe Danner is Gwyneth Paltrow's mother, and some of us think she could have been just as big a star.  Here is one of her very best performances in this PBS version from the 1970's of Anton Chekhov's classic play, ""The Seagull.""  She plays Nina, a country girl who falls in love with the dissolute novelist Trigorin (Kevin McCarthy).  She is the very incarnation of innocence and happiness in the first three acts.  She uses that throaty voice, enormous eyes and piercing sweetness to make us care deeply about the character.  Then in act four she transforms herself into Trigorin's destroyed victim and the result is heartwrenching.  A great performance by a sadly neglected great actress.  This video is part of the ""Broadway Theatre Archive"", a collection of plays taped for PBS as part of their ""Theatre in America"" series.  Every drams buff should seek them out.",982886400,36,881,4.865771812080537
7955154,5,B00005UQ7Y,"This is a classic, and maybe the best realization of The Seagull ever performed.",1462838400,,80,4.785714285714286
7955155,5,B00005UQ7Y,it's the Seagull by Chekov the cast was unexpected but oh such great play!,1444348800,,74,4.357142857142857
7955156,5,B00005UQ7Y,One of my favorite PBS series from the 1970s!  I am a fan of Frank Langella's and loved his theater-on-TV work from back then.  He and Blythe Danner made an excellent acting team!  An excellent production!,1417824000,,205,4.638888888888889
7955157,3,B00005UQ7Y,"The movie version of this classic is just a reading of the play with scenery.  The acting is just workman like.  There were no memorable roles.  If you don't want to read the play but are interested in it this movie is for you.  Otherwise, a little dry.",1408838400,,253,4.208333333333333
7955158,5,B00005UQ7Y,"An excellent rendition of a surprisingly complex and moving play. Chekhov in a nutshell, with its longing, frustration and gentle family tragedy.",1397865600,,145,5.636363636363637
7955159,5,B00005UQ7Y,"Wonderful version of Chekhov' s ""Seagull.""  Very well acted and also very faithful to the text.  Either rent or buy it.",1392422400,,119,4.619047619047619
7955160,3,B00005UQ7Y,"I have never read Chekov's original play, but I was quickly carried away by the depth and provocative language of this story; it's the kind of play that makes you fall in love with words and the power they can have.

The story itself is very simplistic, with most of the really important moments actually happening off camera. Because of that, this can't really be recommended for everyone; uninterested viewers will probably find little to cling to.

This interpretation is weakened by the broad ranges in performances. Blythe Danner was certainly the highlight; her breakdown scene a particular standout.  Lee Grant is also captivating as a past-her-prime stage actress.

The men, however, are not as effective. Frank Langella is at his best when playing powerful characters, so as the tortured playwright Konstantin he sometimes comes across as hammy and too self-pitying to feel real empathy with. Kevin McCarthy is effective, but at 60, seems too old for the role of Trigorin. His romantic scenes with the much-younger Danner are uncomfortable to watch, but perhaps that was the intention.

This version will pacify fans of the play, but is unlikely to convert any new ones.",1381363200,,1179,5.056701030927835
7955161,4,B00005UQ7Y,"This was a really great rendition of Chekov. As with ""The Cherry Orchard"", it is a filmed play, rather than a movie. As long as you watch it with that in mind, you will be happy. The acting is excellent.",1369872000,,203,4.1
7955162,5,B00005UQ7Y,"For a movie set so many decades ago I wasn't expecting much, but now I see what's the possible rave about it. It's beautifully done, and the acting was genuine. Even though it's about ordinary lives, it's made very interesting. Definitely worth a re-watch.",1358553600,,256,4.840909090909091
7955163,4,B00005UQ7Y,"This is a good production of a great play. If you have never seen the show, it's a great introduction. The acting is a little uneven but Frank Langella is outstanding and Blythe Danner is always good. If you can't see the show live, this is a decent substitute.",1290124800,,261,4.346938775510204
