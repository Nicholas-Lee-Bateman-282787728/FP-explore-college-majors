6534888,1,B00M0JTYJC,"This item had great reviews, so I decided to check it out. I was looking for a video with music for my 2 and 3 year olds to watch. It did not hold the interest of my 2 year old, which is rare.  But worse, it was very frustrating for my 3 year old.  There are dozens of little skits, but between each one  there are credits, as if the show is over.  So between thinking it ended and having to sit and wait between scenes, she got frustrated.  I tried it a few times.  O.  my kids normally like everything. The actually skits were cute.",1448755200,,534,3.981132075471698

You will find yourself referring to ""two banana days,"" and for no particular reason start singing ""in the park in the park in the park in the park..."" Oh yeah. And I've got big feet. Ahhhhh.... big feet.

Seriously, there is an incredible amount of fun packed into each of these 24 short videos. You won't be able to get them out of your head. Nor will you want to.",1437696000,,495,4.15625

The DVD auto-plays and auto-repeats, which is great for them (and gets used constantly). One the first sentences my (now) 2 year old learned was ""Big Block Singsong"" and it got/gets uttered often. Starting with Monkey this is 48 minutes of catchy tunes that make kids happy. What's nice for us parents is the songs are fun - they aren't the same-old-same ... well, with the frequency with which I have seen them they get a little old, but that's to be expected for any song.

I like how the songs have different sounds, some more like jazz, some disco, some rock. They are very creative and remind me a little bit of the Flight of the Conchords tv series.

6535259,5,B00M0JTYJC,"Who knew that being so square could be so cool! Big Block Singsong is a terrific musical, visual DVD romp. Creators Warren Brown and Adam Goddard have hit the creative mother load here - what seems so simple is so deceiving in its well-designed construction - the 'simple' individual block characters sing a two-minute nicely produced song that covers subjects from noses and hair to emotions of sadness and happiness, so you see the sky's the limit, or not. Two of my favorite pieces are 'Octopus' who is so proud of his eight legs and 'Moose' who touts the joys of visiting the park. If I was a betting man I'd bet you couldn't watch just one, could you, I bet not.

This might be the best invention since the Wheel! Simplicity and cleverness of design mixed with catchy songs and melodies. Great to look at and fun to hear. I'm 65 and mesmerized ... the colors and movement will entrance toddlers while adults will get the in-jokes. Each two-minute animated song is a complete story and true to its mission of making what might be a mundane single word into a revelation that being so square could be so cool. I love that some of the lyrics are above the head of the little ones. It doesn't matter because the visual and audio support each other so well

The songs are positive and supportive and applaud individualism and uniqueness. I bet this DVD will get worn out from repeat viewings!
The DVD cover shows the diversity of each character, an animated block that is colorful, very fun-looking and inviting. The technical features are all sound but the joy is letting each of the 24 segments play through. Cool!

The kids really liked this program. They watched it with interest and they were excited for each next song to begin. They laughed and jumped around during the song about hair. We watched it in two sessions because it was a little long for them to watch in one session. They lost interest halfway through but came back excited about it again later. They loved the different colors of the blocks and were interacting and discussing the songs with each other.

""It's big music!"" ""My favorite part was the hair person that had hair all over her eyebrows."" ""We liked everything."" ""We liked that it said, oh yeah!"" They really liked the format of short, fun songs, laughed hysterically at the hair song. The baby had his eyes open really big. They also liked the space song. Thought it was really cool. ""We learned about colors, fruit and flamingos. The owl looked so mean."" They were loud and enthusiastic about each new song. The baby cooed at the fruit song. Very enjoyable for all, ages 4 months to 5 years.",1429488000,,2623,4.5863539445629
