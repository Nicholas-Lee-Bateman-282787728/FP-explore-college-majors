8448190,5,B004YDSNIU,"Ed Hardy is one of the true greats of tattooing and a living legend. This dvd charts the life of Ed Hardy and how he was influenced and steered towards tattooing. Ed Hardy is an artist that always understood and acknowledged tattooing as a folk art but really pushed tattooing to its limits, paving the way for the fantastic tattooing that is being done today. Those of us that have been in tattooing a long time, longer than when it became popular, already knew that Ed Hardy was on a special path bringing his art to the general public. Ed respected the art of tattooing and it's roots before him so much that he describes in his own words how he travelled to be tattooed by an almost blind eighty year old lady. This respect is deep in all old school tattooists. I wouldn't just recommend this dvd to the younger generation of tattooists, I would go as far as to say it is essential viewing, to understand the roots of modern tattooing and how and why it is enjoying its popularity today. I enjoyed all the old photos and footage described by Ed in his own words. The dvd has much bonus material making it exceptional value for money. Lyle Tuttle is on the dvd saying that an old friend of mine (Jeff Baker) still owes him for a tattoo, so that gave me a chuckle on a personal level. I also enjoyed the interview on the bonus material of Ed's son describing how tattooing is not just about the art (although that's obviously important) but it's about dealing with people, showmanship with a little bit of hustle, it was good to hear as I have been saying for a long time now the newer generation of tattooists are lacking in this side of tattooing. No collection is complete without this dvd buy it now!
