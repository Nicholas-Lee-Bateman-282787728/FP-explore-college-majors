6381345,3,B00JLJ0ARE,"The potential for this film to be a great movie is there. It had a great plot, and story line. So for the bad news. During the movie you well find yourself asking why did he/she do that, that was just dumb because any normal person would have been like ok lets not do that cause it might get me killed. The movie lacked a budget, and possibly a director. I know I cant do this but I would actually have given the movie 3.5 stars for the potential. I cant give it 4 that would mean its worth owning. I recommend a rent if you have nothing else to watch.",1406678400,10,552,3.981981981981982
6381346,3,B00JLJ0ARE,"Dark Space was a small budget independent film, that came out last year. Even with it's small budget, the special effects were really cool, unfortunately, that's where they spent all their money. In the future, space vacations is big business, and six college kids on spring break have rented a ship to travel to one of the many off world locations. The ship is set to go the speed limit and that's not cool for the drunken students. After altering their ship, it flies out of control into an uncharted region, where the group crashes on an unknown planet. The story told in Dark Space is a good one and the special effects were the best I've seen in such an independent film, but the acting was awful! Alana Dietze is the lead and she literally sounded like she was reading from a teleprompter the entire film.  Even the emotional scenes and the action sequences were just so badly portrayed that it was like watching someone read the news. The male lead, Steve West, wasn't much better either has he gives a dry and uneven performance. Independent films are where a lot of people get their start, and to get recognition, they have to do things to help the film stand out of the rest. That is why they spent so much  money on special effects, but what good are the effects or even the terrific story, when you have actors that are so bad, you feel like your watch a middle school play? I liked everything about this film and with a more competent cast, it would have been terrific. If you like a good science fiction story, I'd still watch the film, but the cast just really doesn't cut it.",1419379200,,1591,4.445205479452055

6381356,1,B00JLJ0ARE,Don't be fooled by the trailer. This incomprehensible mess is amateur hour from the get-go. Plot is ludicrous. Character development and dialogue is unbelievable. There isn't even any campiness to help it along...miss this or watch it for free on netflix.,1410998400,3,255,5.2439024390243905
6381357,2,B00JLJ0ARE,"Dark Space is about some drug users who party on a shuttle on the way to a resort planet. The smoking pot, drinking alcohol, ect.... seemed really out of place for a futuristic type setting. They all seemed like 1990s college binge partiers, not really in keeping with the sci fi theme of the film. They mess around with the speed governor on the computerized shuttle and that messes everything up. They crash on an alien world. Then they encounter things if an evergreen forest that looks a lot like earth.

Positives: Some good effects with the shuttle and some good special effects with the controls, computer system, and that setting. I actually liked the way the shuttle was portrayed from an engineering standpoint. The planet and space scenes were good, as was the crash landing through the atmosphere. Creature special effects are moderately interesting.

Negatives: WAY TOO MUCH HAND HELD SHAKY CAMERA EFFECTS. The Blair Witch Project is over and done, and please movie makers, use better cinematography! Please! The acting is really not very convincing. The nose rings, and other outfits all seem like 1990s not the future. Dialogue is poor. Some of the weapons systems really look like paint ball guns. Not some high tech futuristic weapons. The body armor was odd and its style did not work for me. The overall story is weak. The situation encountered on the planet is not very believable, and the ending with the other ship is just dumb. I give this a C- rating.",1409961600,8,1475,4.803149606299213

6381361,1,B00JLJ0ARE,"Is there such a thing as a C movie?  Looked like the producers and the writer/director sat around in deck chairs between sets, drinking brewskis and developing the next awful stitch in a plot with no life, no direction, no...anything.  I wish I had some way of hanging a sign warning of toxic content on this turkey and only hope that the production was made digitally--so that precious celluloid was not wasted on this drippy POS.",1408838400,,431,4.657894736842105

6381363,4,B00JLJ0ARE,It was different but OK for a B rated movie. i would have rated it 3 stars but hubby thought it was worth 4 stars. Not too bad and don't expect big A movie plot and dialog. But a good solid B movie with an interesting idea.,1408665600,2,223,3.765957446808511

The notion of a bunch of ""fracked up"" 20 somethings taking a multi-million dollar space craft out on a joy-ride is laughable. Underdeveloped plot; sophomoric script and dialogue; lack of character development; lack of tension and real fright moments; poor creature development and backstory - in short, a modern version of a Larry Buchanan, low budget ""Z"" film.

6381374,3,B00JLJ0ARE,"Saw a cartoon once in the New Yorker, where a Jetsons type flying saucer, complete with clear dome and bug eyed alien is buzzing Park Avenue shouting; ""YEEEHAAAAAW"". From there the question of, 'are they out there?' goes down the logic tree, but I like to think they are out there, and can come here' and they have something like the Prime Directive.  So what are ufo sightings? There either spring breakers, bored station keepers, or bootlegers: somewhere in the Big Out There cow parts are in high demand, and if you haven't figured out the anal probing, check out red tube.

So this film takes on the spring breaker hypotheses, and does it with a nice twist--in some ways its like an extended episode of the modern Twilight Zone.  I'm still hoping to see some of the other ideas worked out. Done right, the anal probing possibility could be as hootie as Killer Clowns From outer Space crossed with Orgasmo, imho.",1406678400,,915,4.635802469135802
