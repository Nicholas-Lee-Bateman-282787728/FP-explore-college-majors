8345338,5,B001UWOLQ6,I found this film totally charming and engaging . . . .Hugh Bonneville had a huge undertaking here and pulled it off wonderfully! I loved how you had to use your imagination to picture his wife Carrie and the son who changed his name to 'Lupin' (I burst out laughing at that one!). Gentle humor and some touching scenes. No car chases here:),1460419200,,341,4.428571428571429
8345339,5,B001UWOLQ6,I adore this production of Grossmith's writings. The writing is so clever and one can find no fault in Bonneville's performance. I can't imagine the difficulty involved in engaging with the camera at all times while performing as Mr Pooter. His righteous indignation and victorian ideals crack me up. There is nothing else quite like this that I can think of!,1445472000,,359,4.901639344262295
8345340,5,B001UWOLQ6,"Fantastic!  Hugh Bonneville at his best.  Though it's funny,  very funny, the hopes, frustrations,and need to be seen as 'somebody' are quite apparent.",1431648000,,151,5.478260869565218
8345341,2,B001UWOLQ6,"Without any slight to the dramatic talent of Hugh Bonneville, this film offers convincing proof that ""The Diary of a Nobody"" is impossible to translate to the medium of film. The conundrum is this: how does one dramatize diary entries, whose humor originates in the fictional author's lack of self-awareness and description of socially awkward situations, not to mention the pomposity and self-deception inherent in keeping a diary. The answer is that you can't. You can either dramatize the diary entries with a full cast of actors, in which case you lose half the humor since so much of the book's charm lies in its protagonist's obliviousness to his own ridiculousness, and the charming, deadpan manner in which it is set down on paper. Conversely, you can do as the film did, and simply have the protagonist talk to an invisible interlocutor- the viewer- as if we were sitting in his parlor. It simply didn't work. In fact, it was kind of odd to watch a man having a one sided conversation. If they were just going to have an actor read diary entries, they should have just produced a audio book, which would have been far more pleasant.",1374364800,2,1141,4.738693467336684
8345342,5,B001UWOLQ6,"The book has never been out of print since it was first published in 1892, and with good reason.

George Grossmith created a work of genius.  Charles Pooter is the archetype lower middle class Victorian.  He strives to raise his status, never succeeding. He grovels before his superiors and patronizes those one rung below him on the social ladder. He is vain, silly, ineffectual and absolutely endearing. The book's illustrations (by Weedon Grossmith)are delightful and bring the pages to life.  The television show, faithfully adapted from their work, manages to capture the book's charm and its humor.  There is not one minute that's not worth seeing.

Poor old Pooter. Life at The Laurels, a charming name given to an ordinary little bungalow in the unprepossessing suburb of Brickfield Terrace, is mostly disappointing.  Things rarely go right for Mr. P.  His son is not only a disappointment to him, he is also more successful. His job as a mid-level clerk in a small investment firm brings him some satisfaction, although he is the frequent target of his colleagues' jokes and paper missiles. Even so, Pooter is always optimistic, always eager to elevate his status. His genuine respect and admiration for his employer Mr. Perkupp is as touching as his supercilious and doomed attempts to lord it over tradesmen and delivery boys are funny.

Hugh Bonneville is excellent in what cannot have been an easy role to play or an easy task to undertake.  This is a one-man show.  We see Pooter at home and in various locations--his office, a somewhat seedy beach hotel--as he narrates his daily life and shares his jokes with us.  Mostly daily life is better in the anticipation than reality...and isn't that the way real life sometimes works? The beauty of the book and Bonneville's performance is that we can see a little bit of ourselves in Pooter but the charm and gentle fun-poking make us laugh, even when the dart lands in a sensitive spot.

Bonneville uses such a reasonable tone of voice and such small, measured gestures, it's amazing how much emotion he conveys and how many situations he describes using no words at all.  His eyes are unbelievably expressive, giving us a purely Pooterian look that combines injured dignity, surprise and dismay at a world that could behave in such a rude and vulgar manner, and the absolute assurance that we agree with every word he says.  For all the subtlety of his gestures, Bonneville is very physical. The tiniest reconfiguration of his brow speaks volumes.  Watching him crack an egg tells us more about the events he is about to discuss than his words possibly can.  The way he bites into his morning toast signals whether things go good or ill in Pooterland.

Bonneville also has a gift for inflection and phrasing, and uses his voice brilliantly, changing pace and pitch when necessary, adding precisely the right expression or movement, to convey different characters and different emotions, and make us forget that it's only the one man on the stage. We 'see' what he's describing, so vividly that it's sometimes a shock when we realize he is alone.

The plot is nothing, just a little over one year in the life of A Nobody.  Pooter and his wife, Carrie, live simply. Their social life consists of Pooter's friends Mr. Cummings and Mr. Gowing--whose names provide Pooter with endless amusement. Pooter's son is young, irresponsible and disasterously in love with the rich but coarse Daisy Mutler. His friends are fatuous, rowdy and theatrical. Despite Pooter's warnings, the lad continues his dissolute ways...and becomes considerably more successful than his dad. Of course.

The big events of the year are a ball at Mansion House where the Lord Mayor of London himself will be holding court, a party Pooter throws for his son and Miss Mutler, and a week's holiday at some damp and dreadful British seaside resort.  Naturally all go horribly wrong, in small but absolutely dire ways.  There is no Lucille Ball slapstick here, no over the top American sitcom situations.  Even so, you can't stop laughing.

The humor is gentle but not too subtle.  We love and despise Pooter simultaneously, and we can all see bits of ourselves reflected in him.  This is a lovely piece acting and a unique piece of television.  If you have read the book, you really ought to watch this. If you haven't read the book, you will after viewing.

Bonneville displays more of his considerable acting talent as the Earl of Grantham in Downton Abbey.  He's very good in that role, but he's unforgettable as Pooter. Don't miss this little gem.",1365984000,4,4576,4.874677002583979
8345343,3,B001UWOLQ6,"The book THE DIARY OF A NOBODY  is hilariously funny. However, despite the earnest attempt by the film maker, somehow an awful lot of the humor was lost in the single actor narration. I think Hugh Bonneville, who is an excellent actor, was done a disservice by given this part. I was very disappointed and went back to reread the book. It's still a very funny book.

8345344,1,B001UWOLQ6,"For decades I have enjoyed British comedy, and when I saw the rave review of this film on Amazon I jumped at the chance to see it.  What one gets is lengthy, dull, unfunny, and pretentious.  The major character in the monologue constantly sniggers at his own banality and superficiality. I kept wondering why this dull dud is considered a comedy at all.  There is nothing amusing or profound or thoughtful about it!  If you think watching snow melt is entertaining, well, good for you.  This is your kind of movie. I wish I could get my money back, not to mention the time wasted.",1362787200,3,580,4.485714285714286
8345345,5,B001UWOLQ6,"What can I add to ""Doc's"" review?  Just a hearty, Amen! Hugh Bonneville was simply superb as Pooter!  I had to own the dvd, because I'm sure every so often when the 'world is too much with me' it will be an antidote and escape.",1258934400,10,227,4.022222222222222
8345346,5,B001UWOLQ6,"Mr. Charles Pooter, the diary author in ""THE DIARY OF A NOBODY"", is a nobody, but he simply fails to notice. He is content with life, almost. He presents his diary in a verbal (in this DVD)format, speaking directly to the camera. He most enthusiastically orates about his common middle-class social and family events (the very ones he's written in the diary.) He feels assured the world will eventually enjoy his written diary--when published. Is he the Suburban Snob of 1892? Certainly it's perfected pompousness.

I can not imagine ""THE DIARY OF A NOBODY"" being as funny without hearing and seeing Pooter (Hugh Bonneville) presenting the diary in dialogue.  It's strictly British humor, but at it's Victorian finest. Bonneville's ability to project emotion and expressions is near perfection. Hugh Bonneville can say as much with a lifted eyebrow, an eye roll, a gesture, or a voice change, as what is provided in the script.

In Pooter's written (spoken in this DVD version) accounts, he makes the occasional joke--usually unappreciated by others.  A time or two Pooter laughs so hard at his own merriment that he resembles Red Skelton's famous moments of belly-laughing at his own humor.

Pooter loves his 'Home Sweet Home' which is near the rail tracks. He had just moved into the new rental as the diary began, April of 1891. The diary ends in May of 1892. The home is called The Laurels (even though it has no laurels growing, but Pooter and his wife, Carrie, might plant some). It is London, suburbia, Victorian, and the train traffic makes the house quake frequently. But Pooter adjusts. The many views of the 6 or 7 rooms, as well as Pooter's employment location, provides a complete, delightful look at London Victorian living in a middle-class dwelling. Furnished with period pieces and accents, right down to the tea cups and boot scrapper (which is a constant complaint). And the Christmas holiday tops off the Victorian aesthetics. WOW!

So what does Pooter write about? Lupin, the not-so-perfect son and his engagement with a not-so-perfect, older, fatter, uglier, Miss Daisy Mutlar. Spouse spats. His boss, Mr. Perkupp, and Pooter's downns and upps with Perkupp. Social engagements gone afoul or well. Costs, especially with drinks. Stocks, encouraged by his son. Bad lobsters. Friends, Cummings and Gowing, and their comings and goings. And that darn boot scrapper.

The DVD features explained that the term ""Pooterism"" (taking oneself too seriously) evolved from this work first published in a magazine (1888), then book in 1882 (still in print today), this film via BBC (2007), and now this DVD. The book was written by brothers, George & Weedon Grossmith, biography also in the bonus stuff.
Plus more, but no subtitles--BOOGER!

4 episodes totaling just shy of two hours. In the end my wife and I had enjoyed actor, Hugh Bonneville, as Charles Pooter so much, we finally ceased smiling and laughing. Why? It was over. Sad to see it end.

If you like the subtlety of British comedy, then you'll LOVE this CLASSIC British humor book brought to film/DVD. An astonishing one man show. Listen to Pooter's words, watch him, ""For he's the jolly good fellow.""",1248307200,19,3172,4.981096408317581
