8636780,5,B00HW4PACK,"This is a demo-quality 3D entry into David Attenborough's wonderful presentations on the beauty of the natural world. It is a true night at the museum where extinct animals rise up from their fossils and you see what they were really like - fur or scales and all. Attenborough tells us how we know from their fossils how they must have walked and moved and lived. To watch this I used a region free 3D player, a 60"" 3D screen and bought this movie from amazon.uk for about twenty dollars. I have found that many movies, even American ones, are cheaper at amazon.uk. And I think I have covered the cost of the player just since Christmas. The screen is going to take longer as far as money, but from what I have already experienced watching these movies, it is really worth it.  If it says Sky 3D, you're in for a terrific ride. Two others that are equally wonderful are Conquest of the Skies and Island of the Lemurs.",1457395200,,917,4.394117647058824
8636781,3,B00HW4PACK,"The actual movie is good if you can find something to play it on. It will not play on a mac book because it is a blue ray, it would not play on  my  other dvd player because it is not 1080i compatible, and it would not play on another dvd player because it is not PAL compatible. Interesting enough, I finally was able to get it to play on an older non-name brand dvd player.",1425772800,2,375,3.9210526315789473
8636782,2,B00HW4PACK,"ForTheLoveOfGame is the seller offering this in US format.  The problem is the special features don't work.  Main movie no problem but the special features won't play.  I found this to be the case with the Attenborough 3D box set as well.  All the main movies will play fine, look great but NONE of the special features play on those discs.  I contacted ForTheLoveOfGame and they blamed it on me, they don't have defective disc... funny I've got 4 of them.  It's my player, my fault and o by the way if you want to return it there's a restock fee. So good luck with them.  Their customer services suck and their movies don't play right as well.",1415232000,4,644,4.406779661016949
8636783,5,B00HW4PACK,Very well done3D production.  It was educational with the right amount of humor added in.  The photography was great and the CGI effects were well done.  The 3D effects were used prominently without being gimmicky or exaggerated unnecessarily.  The disc played without any issues in my US OPPO 3D player which was connected to a US Sony 3D projector.,1405123200,4,350,4.88135593220339
