8319177,4,B001LNON5I,"OK early 60's West German made, English dubbed mystery.  Typical Edgar Wallace thriller.  Story is somewhat convoluted.  Something about fake bank plates and a man being driven mad by being suspected of the crime.  Not as atmospheric and fog-shrouded as other films of this genre, but not bad.  The Sinister Cinema DVD-R is OK quality but rather dark at times and needs re-mastering.",1487548800,,383,5.015873015873016
