Thee show follows the adventures of Ricky, Julian, and Bubbles.  Usually each season starts with ""the boys"" getting out of jail and each season ends with one or all of them getting locked up (with exceptions).  This set does not include the movies or the ""say goodnight to the bad guys"" special, but I highly suggest you purchase those in addition to this box set!

3527993,5,B001DB2HTC,"When I stumbled onto this show when it was on IFC awhile back, I wasn't sure what to make of it for the first few minutes.  Then the brilliance of Ricky, Julian, Bubbles, and Lahey shines and really begins to dawn on you.  The spoof reality style shooting of the show only adds legitimacy to the setting of a Nova Scotia trailer park. Each season starts with Ricky and Julian exiting the local prison to return to Sunnyvale Trailer Park to act out their latest ""retire at 35"" scheme.  Great show, with off beat and witty humor.  Great for fans of Reno 911, and a catalyst for smarter comedies like Sunny in Philadelphia to take great notes from.",1379462400,,645,4.440677966101695

3528018,5,B001DB2HTC,"I generally don't like cult hits.  However, after seeing various avatars on forums I frequent I gave in and watched a couple of episodes on Netflix.  After ""getting it"", the premise of the show and the mocumentary humor this is my new favorite show.  I purchased these as a present for my wife, as it's become her favorite show as well.  I haven't watched these DVD's but other than defects in the DVD I don't know what could be wrong.  I'm hoping we see some bloopers or extras on these we haven't seen in the regular series.  I wanted the ""cheeseburger locker"" but I wasn't willing to pay what they are asking for it now, as it's out of print and prices are soaring.  I'm not sure if the regular DVD's I bought are out of print, but I would imagine they may be as the prices on these have gone up quite a bit too.  Rest easy everyone, since I bought them, what usually happens is prices go down after I buy so maybe in a few months you can pick these up for peanuts lol.  If not, they are worth the the price of admission.  The humor is somewhat low brow at face value, but there is definitely undercurrents of more intelligence if you can look past the slapstick stuff.

3528024,4,B001DB2HTC,"Trailer Park Boys has to be one of the funniest shows I have ever seen.  Until it hits season six.

I won't go into the hows or whys of its downfall; suffice to say that, like many shows that outlive their final punch-line, it begins to repeat itself, drag itself into the emotional affairs of characters (rather than comedic situations), and finally become the thing that it was always railing against - a mainstream, safe-for-teenagers 'comedy'.  This is true also of the Trailer Park Boys Movie and the Christmas Special, which offer very few new gags and rehash many older jokes posited in the earlier seasons.  The movie especially seems to have a trace of Hollywood polish and it doesn't mix in with the raw and low-budget feel of the first five seasons.

And then comes ""Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys"" and ""Countdown to Liquor Day""...

The boys put in a massive final quarter and Trailer Park Boys comes right back into its own.  Hilarious liquor-store robberies (look out for Bobby Box Head and his friend Weldy Weld Face), dope-growing, guns - and, most importantly, puns - abound in 'season eight'.  Littered with 'Rickyisms', Randy jokes, kitty cuddles and Lahey insanity, TPB captures the flag from the s***-rats and drives it to the dump to hang out with Ricky's dad.  Outstanding.

Oh yeah, and always watch out for s***-hawks.",1359417600,3,1341,4.791304347826087

Theres not one bad season or episode in the series in my opinion and i wish they wouldve had more seasons than cancelling it after one episode of season 8. Rumor is they're doing another movie sometime this year, so im hoping for a revival!!! I love how Ricky always talks his way out of getting trouble with the cops, the way Julian is always carrying around his drink, Bubbles and all his kitties and at the end of the day they always manage to make Lahey mad or look like a fool.

3528043,5,B001DB2HTC,"As with an ever-growing contingent of admirers, I arrived at this party as it was disbanding. I was introduced to the distinguished canon of Trailer Park Boys on August 20, 2010. By September 6, 2010, I had viewed all archived Trailer Park Boys material several times and concluded that its greatness compelled me to make its dissection and analysis my life's work. This review will merely touch on a small corner of my 5000-page dissertation on what makes this series and all of its attendant appendices (Trailer Park Boys Pilot, 1999, Trailer Park Boys Dear Santa Claus Go F&6& Yourself, 2004, The Big Dirty, 2006, Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys, 2008 and Countdown to Liquor Day, 2009)the inviolately perfect conclusion of all art ever created in the history of recorded time, and why everyone on earth MUST view it, all of it, at least a dozen times, if we are to save this earth from the Armageddon towards which we are relentlessly marching. I daresay, for example, that if the American public school system has not replaced the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance with the recitation of Lahey's ""Sh1thawks"" speech from The Big Dirty, complete with concluding epic chuggage of an entire pint of rye, by the end of the next Presidential cycle EVERYONE IN AMERICA WILL DIE. In fact, I'm lobbying tirelessly with my local legislative representatives to introduce an emergency bill that will authorize the use of all necessary tactics in forcing actor John Dunsworth to renounce his Canadian citizenship and assume the office of President of the United States, unwillingly if necessary and effective immediately. Eastwood was wrong in that commercial. We are not at half-time. We are in sudden death, and only Dunsworth/Lahey can save us, flanked by his advisors Patrick Roach/Randy and director-writer Mike Clattenburg, who will assume the office of First Lady in a quasi-Eleanor Roosevelt/Hillary Clinton capacity if this bill is successfully passed.

I'm aware that talk is cheap, and I don't expect my assertions alone to convince review readers of the life-altering importance of Trailer Park Boys; ergo, I have built up an arsenal of historical data to back the ultimate argument. In this review, I will touch upon the main societal schema through which the Trailer Park Boys teaches us everything any human being would need to know about negotiating this mortal coil: the psychological schema. I have compiled several schemas by which we can be presented evidence that the meaning of life can be brought into focus for even the most prosaic of minds by this series, but the psychological is key, and I have a finite amount of room in which to expound. Also owing to a paucity of space, I will focus only on the schema evident in the five main characters: Ricky, Julian, Bubbles, Lahey and Randy. For additional data on this I soon hope to post addenda about these schema in the supporting cast in the comments section of this review (see ""J-Roc: sex-positive feminist"", ""Lucy: matriarchal engenderment of reproductive confusion as survival mechanism"", and ""Cory, Trevor and Sarah: Aristotolian bugaboo?"").

Psychological schema of Trailer Park Boys characters:

Julian - Freud's concept of superego. With his insistence on maintaining a modicum of control over his own physical situation even as chaos breaks out all around him, embodied in his ability to avoid spilling his drink in any and all circumstances, Julian, the putative leader of the titular ""boys"", demonstrates man's effort to control both his demeanor and his destiny by physical means of will over the glass containing the potent highball. In ""Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys"", Lahey, the dictator/patriarch against which Julian continuously struggles, symbolically castrates him by destroying the glass as the police he has called cart Julian off. Many would argue that the kiss Lahey impishly plants on his cheek is the castrating moment, but this is incorrect. The kiss symbolizes Lahey's final acknowledgement of the worthiness of his foe, in the moment just prior to defeat and gelding. In the end, as demonstrated in ""Countdown to Liquor Day"", Julian symbolically reclaims his manhood by refusing to return the dubious ""love"" offered by the patriarch in exchange for obedience, which will never be forthcoming.

Ricky - As with yin and yang, Ricky provides the raging Freudian id to his friend/mentor's orderly superego. In all things, Ricky represents the irrational, the chaotic, and the immature id's constant search for instant gratification, which for Ricky usually consists of cigarettes obtained by force or derision from Trevor, and pepperoni stolen from his father. Ironically, at the series' end, it is Ricky, not Julian, who successfully fends off the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms with his animalistic negotiation tactics. His endless exhortations of those around him to ""Catch a boat to f&6k-offity land"" are, at their core, a heart's cry for a saner and more egalitarian existence for all.

Bubbles -  Jung's concept of the Divine Child, referred to in modern psychotherapy as the Wounded Child. His harsh induction into adulthood at too early an age, touched upon at length in ""Dear Santa Claus..."", followed his abandonment by his parents when his father abruptly had to flee the trailer park after shooting his mouth off in a place referred to colloquially as ""down to the Legion"". His desperate search for a parental figure finds no satisfying conclusion in the institutional patriarchy of Lahey, so he instead turns to Ricky and Julian for filial solace. As in life, this longing and loyalty frequently brings him to heartache. He occasionally salves his frustration at the recklessness of his fellows by insulting them only through the medium of a malevolent hand puppet, Conky.

Additionally, all three Trailer Park Boys suffer, debilitatingly, from Oppositional Defiance Disorder.

Lahey - Patriarchal Totalitarianism. With his background in law enforcement, a career briefly resumed in Seasons Six and Seven, and his occasionally delusional proprietership of Sunnyvale, Lahey represents the forces of civilization vis a vis the individual. Wherever there is adversity for the spirit of individuality, one will find a usually-intoxicated Lahey. Occasionally impish vestiges of chaos will cause Lahey to lapse into lethal behavior, as in Season Five when he induces a bloody war over the Hash Driveway between the Boys and their arch-nemesis Cyrus (along with his henchmen ""the Flappy-Bird brothers""). His moth-to-flame sexual attraction to Julian symbolizes his own thwarted individualism, something that is plainly evident in his fetishism of the younger man's tight black t-shirt, an emotional substitute for the pirate's flag which he both dreads and longs for.

Randy - Stockholm Syndrome. As a young male prostitute who goes by the suggestive moniker ""Smokey"", Randy is quickly indoctrinated by Lahey after the patriarch extends his protection in the form of a place to stay and a new pair of ill-fitting dress pants. His larcenous ways are quelled by the security, and he becomes the older man's staunch apologist even when it is evident that Lahey's dictatorial ways, coupled with his drinking, are leading Sunnyvale down a road to rack and ruin. He joins Lahey in his constant quest to neutralize the flagrant individualism of the Boys and assumes a vigilant ""Big Brother"" role in the trailer park. He frequently makes halfhearted attempts to break free from the benevolent totalitarianism of his patriarch/battering spouse, but he is not strong enough. It doesn't help matters in this dynamic that he too is attracted to Julian's t-shirt, as well as to Ricky's wife, Lucy, whom he impregnates.

The psychological schema of the series' creator, Mike Clattenburg, is obviously most crucial to its development, but again, space limitations in an Amazon review format do not permit a real analysis of something so complex. Suffice it to say that I don't know what the hell is going on in this guy's head, but I wholeheartedly approve.

All kidding aside, yeah, real talk, you could watch all of this for free on Youtube - but why not just buy the set and make Clattenburg and company a few bucks? It's completely worth it for so much originality. I've seen Showcase attempt to describe this show as a ""sitcom"".

I'll keep this short and simple, if you like documentary style, insane situation, improv comedy, this is for you. I highly suggest watching it on Netflix first. As for the set, it comes in an awesome ""Cheeseburger Locker"" which is a reference to a character in the series(Looks great to display). It comes with all 7 seasons in their original DVD cases(which means it includes all their bonus features, SUPER PLUS for that.)

3528049,4,B001DB2HTC,"I'm not going to review the series. If you are familiar with TPB, you know how great the series is. I'm just going to focus on the package of this set.

A few of the other reviewers on here have complained about the Cheeseburger Locker case, stating it's cheap, and that it doesn't fit on a standard DVD shelf. I was expecting the case to be made out of cardboard or really flimsy plastic from what some said. This couldn't be further from the truth. The case is made of a fairly sturdy and quality plastic, complete with Randy's gut protruding out as a door to open the set. It's honestly one of the better quality DVD set cases I have ever seen. As for the size being odd, and not fitting on a DVD shelf, yeah I can see that being an issue. With that said, the set begs to be displayed separately, on a shelf by itself for all to see! It's a guaranteed conversation starter. The first thing you can't help but notice is Randy's gut with Julian, Bubbles, & Ricky tattooed on it. It should NOT be hidden away on some DVD shelf. It should be the centerpiece to any TPB fan's DVD collection! If you are willing to spend $100+ on this set then you are big enough of a fan to WANT it to be displayed out in the open, perhaps with some spotlights shining on it!

If you are a TPB fan you simply cannot go wrong with this very complete collection.

EDIT: I was very sad to put in season 7 and discover that it's in letterbox format, not anamorphic like it should be. Very disappointing especially considering that you can watch season 7 (actually the whole series other than the last movie and one or 2 of the specials) on an unofficial fan YouTube channel in anamorphic widescreen. This to me is unacceptable for a 2008 release so I have to deduct a star from my review. 4 stars still isn't bad and it's still a 5 star series. Still a must have, but unless you have a DVD player that will zoom (my PS3 wont, or at least I can't figure out how to do it) you will feel like you are watching season 7 through a keyhole. Here's hoping the movies and specials are anamorphic not gawd awful letterbox! I'll post another edit if they are in letterbox, people deserve to know.",1330300800,5,2163,4.232445520581114

It is filmed documentary style and it is a Canadian show. The shows run very short at just a little over 20 minutes a pop so it is very easy to watch.

It is basically about the life of crime, drugs, friendship, and sex inside of a trailer park. Even though almost every character is a criminal, you can't help but feel for them and to like them. This show has the best one liners of any show I've ever watched. The actors say the funniest, most ridiculous things you've ever heard yet say them completely straight faced.

I have never heard of the actors in this show but I think they're genius. I can really relate to this show and the content. It really reminds me of the people I have grown up with. It is kind of a cross between Jack@ss and The Real World.

You need to be open minded to enjoy this. So try to relax and watch this show. I think it would be a blast to watch with a group of friends.

These main characters are always working on their next get rich scheme and have back up plans in place to put the blame on Cory and Trevor (the 2 trailer park dimwits) should their plan go awry. I will guarantee that you will absolutely love Bubbles.....He's the smartest guy in the park. BTW...He wears REALLY thick glasses, drives a go-cart, and lives in a tool shed!

After my third viewing(6 episodes), I was hooked! Everyone with whom I have shared my knowledge of this show are big fans too. I love being able to watch when I want to watch and the bonus features are priceless.

Not a minute goes by that one or the other doesn't get into something.

This was an old series filmed in Canada and should be shared. A lot of cussing.... but the humor overshadows any effect it might have for all but the most sensitive.",1279065600,,409,4.368421052631579
3528078,5,B001DB2HTC,"Having recently discovered this Canadian comedy series through a friend, I watched seasons 1 through 7 with fervor and was sad when it ended.  I found myself laughing out loud practically every episode (something I almost never do)!  I never thought I'd find another comedy show that would nearly live up to my all time favorite, The Kid's In the Hall (also Canadian).  However, I'm happy to report that Trailer Park Boys easily measures up in delivering the same comedic genius.  The premise of the show is simple and as follows; Ricky, Julian, and their innocent cat loving friend Bubbles live in Sunnyvale Trailer Park located near Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada.  They're constantly attempting ""get rich quick"" schemes (none of them ever hold a real job for long).  Each scheme usually involves some sort of hair brained hi-jinks and are always inevitably foiled by the always inebriated, ex-cop trailer park supervisor Jim Lahey, his shirtless, gut toting, cheese burger eating assistant Randy and a little help from local law enforcement.  Each season begins with the boys getting out of jail only to end up right back in by the end.  Here are my thoughts on this brilliant comedy series;

Pros

+ Excellent cast of actors/characters.  Ricky, Bubbles/Conky and J-Roc (an Eminem wannabe) quickly became my favorites.  The improvisational skills of most of the actors are phenomenal and always hilarious.  Robb Wells (Ricky) is above and beyond the best example of this.  His constantly mispronounced ramblings were absolutely priceless.

+ Some great guest star appearances (most of them Canadian) by Sebastian Bach (Skid Row), Alex Lifeson (Rush), Brian Vollmer (Helix), Denny Doherty (Mamas and the Papas) and Rita MacNeil.

+ Adult style humor (lots of cursing, the F-word especially...not for the easily offended).

+ Blurs the line beautifully on many subjects people may view as taboo such as sexuality, racism, religion etc.

+ Hilarious criminal hi-jinks that always leave the boys or their dummy scapegoats (Corey and Trevor) back in jail.

+ The boys' main goals in life are making quick money, getting high/drunk and staying out of jail.

Cons

- Non-Canadian viewers may not appreciate/understand all of the humor.  For example, Ricky being referred to as Peter Raveen the hypnotist/illusionist wasn't nearly as funny to me as I had to Google him to find out who he was.  I had the same issue with Ricky's love Kim Mitchell's music.

- Corey and Trevor were absent from all of Season 7 having left the show due to ""creative differences.""  While they weren't my favorite characters they definitely played a crucial role in the show and the boys' criminal schemes.  It was sad not to see them in the final season.

- A few plot holes if you really want to nit pick.  An example would be in season 7 when the forest rangers try to arrest the boys for damaging a beaver nest.  During the first run in the rangers attempt to arrest the boys are unable to as the rangers are Americans on Canadian soil.  Then in the final episode the rangers appear to be Canadian.  Minor story hole, but who cares really.

- Boxed set isn't really ""Complete"" as it's missing a few specials/episodes.

Trailer Park Boys is a perfect example of low budget comedy that gets everything right.  From the characters to the story to the scenery, Trailer Park Boys is a priceless and comedic masterpiece.  While not suited for a mainstream type of humor it definitely fit mine and I didn't want the show to end.  I'm not sure if Canadian humor is more my style (since it's similar to U.K. comedy) but I can happily add Trailer Park Boys next to The Kid's In the Hall as one of my all time favorite shows.  I only wish I had discovered it years ago!",1278374400,5,3735,4.80690737833595
3528079,5,B001DB2HTC,"The entire box set comes in a Trailer Park Boys lunch box, very cool!!  Definitely the cheapest you will find this item anywhere!!",1274054400,,130,4.6521739130434785
3528080,5,B001DB2HTC,"Have definitely been a TPB fan for a while. Loved the lunch cooler that came with the box set. Bubbles has proved himself to be the vertice of laughter throughout the seasons.

3528082,5,B001DB2HTC,"I viewed a few clips of this show and had to buy this set right away. While this may not be complete, I did watch the full length movie before watching the first and second season. I'll break down the seasons

Seasons 1 and 2: I really didn't get into the show right off the bat. It was funny but I stopped after a few epsiodes and placed season three in the dvd player.

Seasons 3,4,5,6: All the seasons are short but very enjoyable with lots of laughs. Every season ends the same way for season six.

Season 7: A very weird season of Trailer Park Boys. I loved when Bubbles went to the train show and stole the prized trains. He disguises himself and I couldn't stop laughing.

You can get the Complete Series minus the movie and Christmas speical with a lunchbox. Its a better deal then buying the seasons seperate. Overall, it's a must own set because the laughs are plentiful and you can view them over and over again without getting bored.",1267401600,,945,4.3522727272727275

3528084,5,B001DB2HTC,"I don't care for much that comes out of Canada with the exception of a few things that I think we Americans should adopt.  In no particular order they are: Ketchup Chips, Wunderbars, Poutine, and the Trailer Park Boys.

This is wonderful comedy that I accidentally stumbled upon while watching the 101 Network on Direct T.V.  It is subtle and intelligent.  You can tell that every piece of comedy was planned out by the writers/directors.  It is absolutely hilarious.

I can confidently say this is the best comedy series available nowadays.  I love Curb Your Enthusiasm but this is far superior.  Pick it up and watch every episode.  I recently ordered the two movies and will review both of those after I have watched them.

I am disappointed that this set does not include the pilot episode, final episode, or the documentaries.  I hate it when box sets of an entire series are not true to their title.",1266019200,19,905,4.6645569620253164

Officially, I purchased this set as a gift for my husband - he says it is the best gift that he has ever received.  Unofficially, I really got this set for myself and have enjoyed every minute of it...  The characters, the crazy plots, and the relationships within the trailer park all add up to hilarious enjoyable viewing.  The inclusion of so many extras: deleted & extended scenes, lost interviews, bloopers, etc...are a wonderful addition.  This is a series that you can watch over and over and enjoy more each time - really hearing how Ricky is butchering the english language is worth the price by itself.  The ""Steve French"" episode is one not to miss!  I can't imagine that anyone with a sense of humor wouldn't totally enjoy the series.  God bless DirecTV's 101 channel for introducing the ""Boys"" to the United States...this is the only time in my life I've wished that I was born in Canada.

3528092,4,B001DB2HTC,"for the record I don't usually enjoy 'pot' movies that show people getting stoned and being stupid.  Trailer Park Boys (TPB) puts a different if subtle twist on a purple haze type life.  these characters are stupid and poor first which leads to growing drug, drinking too much and having disfuncional relationships.  hidden deep in the middle of these characters are occasional tender hearts who are trying to come to grips with being messed up and being ok with that type of life.

The show is shot kinda like a documentary with cameras following people and doing the occasional interview to get the characters thoughts on events that just occoured.

I like unusual films and stuff, but not just ANY unusual films.  as mentioned earlier I didn't enjoy ""half baked"" or ""harold and kumar""  but I did like Undercover Brother in which some drug use was a side issue to the character's motivations.  I liked zoolander where most of the characters are out of this world, but because the whole film is populated with them it helps to believe in the unbelievable characters.  unlike blades of glory where two or four characters are over the top, but everyone around them are normal, thats when the over the top acting becomes annoying for me.

search some TPB youtube and see if you laugh at them, if so start your TPB collection!

3528094,5,B001DB2HTC,"The Trailer Park Boys...what can I say...if you get the white trash street humor you will love it, if you don't you won't like it. This series is a ""mockumentary"" that follows hapless knuckleheads and all of their trailer park neighbors through daily life. Their whole life is about scams, smokin' and growin' ""dope"" (weed), going to jail and fighting with the trailer park supervisor, who is an alcoholic former cop who treats the park as his city. It is hilarious from start to finish. The actors are so good, you actually would believe they are as dumb as they appear in show, but brilliant is more the description. I highly recommend getting the entire series and watch from the first episode to let the characters develop, you will not be disappointed.
