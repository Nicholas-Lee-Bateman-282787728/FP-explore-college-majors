8466702,5,B005DER1I2,"If According to Jim didn't already have everything going for it with Jim Belushi and Alison from Melrose Place, the show really took off with the regular guest starring appearances by worldwide media phenomenon Jason Stewart.  Just watch J Stew crush it as ""Guy #1"" in episode 21 of the fifth season and you will be muttering ""Holy Moley"" until Jeff in RIchmond picks you up in his luxury sled.  In other episodes, J Stew shows up as the memorable ""Bar Patron"" and his star turn as ""Jim's Friend"".  You will never forget roles like this.  I may be crossing the thin line of blasphemy here, but it is undeniable that J Stew kept According to Jim on the air for a couple seasons by juicing the ratings.",1473120000,,700,4.4453125
