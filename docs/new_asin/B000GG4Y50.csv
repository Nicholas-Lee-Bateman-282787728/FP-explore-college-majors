2609235,4,B000GG4Y50,"To be honest, I had low expectations for this film. From early previews it seemed to me another teen comedy with the same premise as the rest, often featuring a lead who is too perfect looking to pass off as a friendless high school student. But, I was suprised with ""Mean Girls"". Although you are somewhat embarrassed to say so, you have a great time and feel like you got your money's worth.
The story follows 16-year-old Cady (Lindsay Lohan), who after transferring from being homeschooled in Africa, to being the new student at an Illinois public school, must adapt to the often cruel, survival-of-the-fittest world of high school teenagers. From teachers and rules to fitting in with the crowd of unfamiliar faces, Cady struggles, but soon befriends the ""art freaks"" Damien (Daniel Franseze) and Janis (Lizzy Caplan), who explain to her the prominent cliques that exist. But soon, she is drawn to The Plastics, the most exclusive clique of all, where only the prettiest and richest girls are asked to join. The Plastics, made up of leader Regina George (Rachel McAdams), rich girl Gretchen Weiners (Lacey Chabert) and less-than brilliant Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried), soon invite her to be a part of them. At first, she accepts as a joke with Janis, but then, as she is elevated to teen royalty, she begins to grow accustomed to the world of The Plastics, and loses sight of her true friends. Things are made more complicated and claws come out when Cady falls for Aaron Samuels (Jonathan Bennett), the ex-boyfriend of Regina.
As Cady, Lindsay Lohan gives a solid and likeable performance. She is one of the many rising teen stars, who finds relatively similar roles with each new project. However, unlike so many teen stars, she looks like someone you'd actually encounter at a high school. She doesn't have the perfect stererotypical body, and she's awkward at times, which adds to her realism and charm. Although she is excellent at what she does, I would like to see her in a deeper, more emotionally challenging role, perhaps something along the lines of Evan Rachel Wood's ""Thirteen"" performance. As for the other cast members, Rachel McAdams is sweet and treacherous as Regina, and doe-eyed Amanda Seyfried plays dumb to perfection. However, the highlight of the movie is the performance by Lacey Chabert. As the ever-loyal Gretchen, she is emotionally insecure and at times pathetic, and completely devotes herself to her character.
The script, written by SNL's Tina Fey, is smart and hilarious, but falters at points. It is a bit predictable, and some of the jokes fall flat, but overall, it is commendable and well-written. Inner monologues by Cady, and her comparisons of high school situations to that of the animal world are clever and original. Overall, although I have read reviews stating the contrary, I was very satisfied with ""Mean Girls"". It's an enjoyable, humorous, and clever look back at high school and the drama of teenage life.",1083369600,6,2960,4.945783132530121
2609236,4,B000GG4Y50,"I must say that I never expected to see Mean Girls, at least not on my own.  If someone else wanted to go, I would go.  I had nothing against seeing it, I just wasn't motivated enough to see it myself.  I'm really glad someone else I knew wanted to see it, because I was very surprised and delighted at how entertaining it was.  It tells the story of Cady ""Its Pronounced Katie"" Heron (the beautiful Lindsay Lohan) as a girl who has just moved to Evanston, Illinois from Africa.  Her mom, Saturday Night Live's Ana Gasteyer, and dad are Zoology professors at Northwestern University, and the family had been living in Africa for 14 years.  Cady has been home-schooled all of her life, so now, at age 16, she attends her first day of school.  At first, she is unpopular and her only friends are the goth girl Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and out-of-the-closet homosexual Damien (Daniel Franzese), but soon, the three most popular and most evil girls in school, the Plastics, take Cady under their wing.  All three of them are beautiful bimbos, with Karen (Amanda Seyfried) as the dumbest of the bunch, Gretchen (Lacey Chabert) as the second-in-command, and Regina (Rachel McAdams), who is the queen bee.  Desperate for more friends, Cady decides to hang out with the group, but she does not forsake her first two pals.  However, Janis seizes the opportunity and asks Cady to become a spy within the Plastics' ranks, sabotaging, scamming, and humiliating the group.  At first, Cady, Janis, and Damian all have a grand time with this set-up, especially after Regina steals away a boy that Cady has a crush on.  But, things begin to turn sour when Cady starts to truly become a Plastic.
I'm not sure, but I think that this is Lindsay's first non-Disney job, and I'm sure glad that they had nothing to do with it.  Writer and co-star Tina Fey actually had to rewrite the first draft because the MPAA gave it an R-rating.  I'm very surprised with some of the things that this film got away with, especially with only a PG-13 rating.  For example, there were some VERY skimpy outfits (no complaints though), a lot of swearing and name-calling, and even a graphic description of a feminine hygeine problem.  This probably is not going to be a favorite of mine, but it is definitely worth a look.  It is surprisingly funny, there are a lot of beautiful girls, and its a fairly accurate portrayal of high school.",1083369600,2,2394,4.6350710900473935
2609237,3,B000GG4Y50,"I saw the movie last night, even though I wasn't extremely impressed by the story (I had read the script before I saw the movie).
I think that the movie had an improtant message: Every one of us can turn into a mean person through influence from the outside if we don't preserve our character and stick to our beliefs.
And even though the story will not win an oscar, the movie had an good continuity/flow and there was some really interesting cinematpgraphy.
If you are a fan of chick-flicks or just want something to spend your night on the town, you should consider watching this movie.",1083369600,,589,4.514018691588785
2609238,4,B000GG4Y50,This is an excellent movie. The movie starts out with Caty who is home-school in Africa but must go to high school. Where she meets the plastics the meanest but coolest girls in high school. Caty tries not to get suck into the plastics. But her desire to fit in and a bet. She becomes one of them. Then really gets interesting. The cast was great but the standouts were Lindsay Lohan and the leader of the plastics.,1083369600,2,415,4.333333333333333
2609239,3,B000GG4Y50,"You're thinking, ""Oh no, not another teeny-bopper movie with Lindsay Lohan!""  I know I did when I first saw the title.  But when I watched the trailer, I found it to be slightly amusing (it wasn't hilarious, but you'll get a few laughs).
Lohan stars as Cady Heron, a girl who recently moves to America from South Africa.  Cady has always been homeschooled and assures her parents that she's okay with their decision to send her to her first real school.  Cady realises that high school is like her experiences in Africa (i.e.  the students are predators fighting for their prey).  But Cady doesn't enjoy her first day of school, even though she has befriended Janis and Damian.
On her second day of school, Cady is saved by Regina George, leader of The Plastics, who tells off a boy who is bothering Cady.  Regina sees more to Cady and invites her to their 'special' lunch table.  The Plastics are the most popular and most powerful clique in school, they are three wealthy and self-centered girls.  The Plastics decide that Cady is worthy enough to join their group and allow her in.  What Cady doesn't notice is that she is slowly turning away from herself into a true Plastic, even more like Regina.
When Cady falls for Aaron Samuel, who is Regina's ex-boyfriend, things go downhill.  Regina promises Cady to help her hook up with Aaron, but instead hooks up with Aaron (again) herself.  Cady is furious and seeks revenge, with the help of Janis and Damian.
But as far as revenge go, Cady didn't plan it to be all this way.
I must admit though, I loved the clothes they wore.  How very plastic of them.",1083283200,2,1605,4.56993006993007
2609240,1,B000GG4Y50,"My whole family saw this movie in a prescreening on Thursday, 4/22.  We left totally disappointed.  Why a homeschooled young adult would want to go to a public school is a ridiculous notion.  My wife and I have been homeschooling all of our 5 children for the last 10 years. All of my homeschooled children disliked the movie and thought it was unrealistic, vulgar, and wished that we walked out after the first 10 minutes.  Lohan plays Katy, the main character, who's socially stupid for a homeschooler.  Academically she is outstanding, but has to downplay her intelligence to try and win the attention of a boy and associates herself with Plastic girls.  She isn't honest with herself and painfully learns her lesson to be herself and to tell the truth.  Save your money.",1082937600,9,774,4.774436090225564
2609241,5,B000GG4Y50,Mean Girls is a wonderful film which takes a humorous look at the antics of high school girsl.  The movie is fast paced with many funny moments under the direction of Mark Waters.  Amy Poehler is delightful is one of the mothers.  Lindsay Lohan gives a completely believable performance.  You will love it..,1082592000,34,307,4.735849056603773
2609242,4,B000GG4Y50,"Don't be surprised if some of these comments aren't 100% (ages, years etc.), its a while since I saw this movie.
I love this movie! I saw it when it came out,when I was 17. It's definitely my favorite teenage movie. The characters are true to life; they're not all the typical gorgeous Hollywood actors, and the story line is really believable. Obviously, it could've been better, but it was good enough. Mean Girls involves a number of girls, Cady Heron as the main character who just moved to a public school from Africa and when she falls for Aaron, Regina, the meanest girl in school's ex-boyfriend, Regina and her clique who has just invited her into her 'clique', the 'plastics' harass her in every single way girls can, including nasty gossip, hateful email messages, banishment from the lunch table, etc. but managed to follow and enjoy the movie anyway. The movie has quite a few memorable moments in it which I can recall. All in all, a good movie which I feel I could watch again., but probably not enough to buy it.. Anyway, an extremely funny movie that pre-teen's will enjoy most likely, but not sensational. Very average. My Girl is better, dare I say.  This is a great movie, following Cady through her years of  mean girls. Lindsay Lohan is perfect. There could not have been a better Cady. Cady reminds me of my sister at the age of 16, having a tough shell and a soft inside. For me it's a kind of reference for that often told story of the summer of first love: all of the well-known cliche-characters - the four girls and their special patterns of behavior in relation to each other, the guys, the high school Christmas dance... - are portrayed and played in a nicely detailed way. The story development works pretty fine, too, and all in all builds up an at least ""comprehensible"" atmosphere, being far away from letting you forget you're watching a film or even being realistic, but as that's not what I'd expect from such a film, that doesn't really bother me.
BUT... the parts of the story playing in the present REALLY annoy me. In addition to the unmotivated kind-of-story with it's incredibly boring and unmoving ending, all actresses deliver such a bad work, that Lacey Chabert actually makes the best impression to me - and she's not better at all than in her other movies.
In order to rate this film in an honest way an AS IT IS, I can give it only 7 out of 10 - I highly recommend it, nevertheless. This is one of my favorite movies. Its a coming of age about 4 friends being nasty and mean to each other. By the end of the movie, they come to see a more mature view of the world. The chemistry of the actresses is wonderful. My 3 best friends and I watched this *one of which is a guy* and we were all almost in tears by the end. It was such a good movie, and it really portrays how us teenage girls really are :-) Thanks for making such an awesome movie! Yo this movie rocks... I love it so much.. it sums up all girls insecurities and probably reminds you of yourself at that age. And definitely reminds you of the friends you had way back when. its the kind of movie that every teenage girl needs to see and the kind of movie that stays in you forever. Its damn hot, funny and just all around great. Brilliant girly film exploring the friendships and hardships of 4 young ladies. Warning - this film is not suitable for guys! CHICK FLICK.... But a totally brilliant one none the less. This movie is about four young girls who are really catty and mean to one another. Many of the plots are true to life, even now in these times as I am growing up. It caught me from the very beginning and I was hooked. I didn't really expect it to be very good. I was very surprised as to how much I really did like it. If you have not yet seen it, I recommend that do so. I completely adore Lindsay Lohan and her first PG-13 movie.  Cutie Lacey Chabert gives a pretty good performance, and the beautiful Rachel McAdams who I enjoyed in The Hot Chick was great as well. Tina Fey and Tim Meadows are just priceless as Mr. Duvall and Ms. Norbury. If U love SNL or teenager movies you'll love this! 7/10.",1081641600,,4121,4.356306892067621

Lindsay Lohan was great.  So were Rachel McAdams and Amanda Seyfried, who's new to the big screen.  All in all, everybody gave a great performance, especially whoever played Regina's mom (Rachel).
Tina Fey wrote a really great script, which has gotten me totally psyched for her future works.  Her work on SNL has been admirable.  Also, I'm not sure of his name, but another SNL alumni plays another one of Cady's teachers and you see him in the beginning, (""We have a new student joining us today"") and he was also very funny.

The movie is incredibly dark and adult humored and totally threw off my expectations. Tina Fey's sharp writing showcases her talents very well. That comedianne had much more in her than i knew, and i liked that. If Fey continues to write like this, i think she will get very far in hollywood and out of the 5 minute span of her Saturday Night Live skits.
The 4 mean girls of the movie are well played. Lindsey Lohan continues with her string of successes in film once again. This movie only showcases her talent even more and shows that she can get out of the kid's movie genre. And, the main mean girl (i don't know her name) is quite the mean girl and she is awesome in showing that. The other 2 girls are perfect in their supporting roles are ditzy followers.

Mean Girls is indeed an exaggerated version of reality, but its depiction of the brutality and ridiculousness of high school and the need to find and stay true to yourself within a social construct manage to ring true. It does not stray away from or gloss over the dark humor that high school inevitably draws out nor is it apologetic in its over-the-topness. The result is a hilarious, well acted film that is as unpredictable as it is funny. It's the Clueless of the 00's and definitely worth seeing.

2609594,5,B000GG4Y50,"One would have thought that the core essence of Mean Girls would be driven by a simplistic, rather mundane exercise in procedure, the protocol being the marketing of an insubstantial collection of cinematic clichs culled from the recent annals of bad teen flicks such as Sugar & Spice and Bring It On.
One would have been wrong.
I'm not kidding: Mean Girls could easily justify an Oscar nomination (I'm not saying a win, mind you, just a simple nod from the Academy).  In a very broad sense, it emulates the thematic underpinning of the wonderful film Election but from a decidedly different plot engine: that sociopolitical currents as displayed in the ecology of high school halls not only echo the world of adults but are in fact the point of genesis for such later-life behaviors.
Lindsay Lohan plays Cady Heron, a girl new to high-school life.  She previously experienced education only in the context of at-home schooling administrated by her parents while living in Africa.  When she comes back to the states and enters the strange new world of suburban public education, she gets an interesting dose of reality: specific, well-defined cliques exist, and they are as rough and protective of their turf as any pride of lions or pack of hyenas roaming the wilds of the Serengeti Plain. After befriending social outcasts Janis Ian and Damian, she discovers the menace of the Plastics, a group of popular girls led by Regina George, a girl with a controlling, bullying demeanor who wouldn't think twice about stabbing a friend in the back to accomplish whatever goal she sets for herself and her agenda. Janis and Damian fill Cady in on Regina and her clique; the new friends then team up to send Cady on a mission to infiltrate the world of the Plastics and damage its leader. What follows is a swift arc of intrigue, deceit, socio-political quagmires and deliciously fun entertainment.
Eric Blair- the man behind the pseudonym George Orwell- would have loved Mean Girls, absolutely loved it.  It's Animal Farm, for all intents and purposes.  When Cady begins sleeping with the enemy, she finds that it's all too easy to pick up the nasty idiosyncrasies of those who inhabit the upper echelon of the social strata. And Janis Ian's seething hate for Regina and her brood also makes the viewer wonder if they aren't equals of personality after all.
Mean Girls is an honest depiction of life and the competition that occurs among all members of the human species. As much as we like to fantasize that we exist in a haughty plane above all others in the jungles of the big blue marble, the shocking truth is we are no less susceptible to our inner instincts for survival than any other participant in the phylogenetic tree.  In the end, it's the genes and their desire to replicate themselves that we ultimately fall in thrall to; maybe that's why we're all so mean sometimes.",1088812800,5,2876,4.8
2609595,5,B000GG4Y50,"Judging by the trailer, I expected MEAN GIRLS to be a cheesy screwball comedy with not much heart and a few laughs tossed in along the way.  But I was very wrong in my assumption.
MEAN GIRLS instead chronicles the life of Cady Heron, a homeschooled student who spent her life in Africa.  For the first time, she must walk through the doors of a public high school.  She's nervous but feels she can get through her first day and come home in one piece.  In a way, she's wrong.  Her first day goes horribly.
But after meeting Janis Ian and her best friend, totally out and proud Damien, Cady (pronounced like ""Katie"") is glad to be befriended by the two social misfits who, prior to her arrival, have enjoyed no one's company but their own.  ""I'm going to call you ""Caddie"","" Janis says.  The three make an interesting trio.
Written by Tina Fey of Saturday Night Live fame, MEAN GIRLS is wickedly funny, laced with satire-esque humor and lots of laughs.  Lindsay proves that, unlike Hilary Duff, she can act.  Parallels can be drawn between MEAN GIRLS and my favorite movie of all time, HEATHERS.
What originally begins as an experiment goes horribly wrong.  Janis, Damien, and Cady have decided that Cady must infiltrate the renown Plastics clique.  Because Cady is a beautiful girl, she is welcomed to the Plastics lunch table.  Leader Regina George and her friends, Gretchen and Karen, are three girls seriously blessed in the looks department.  It at first seems as if everyone envies their social spotlight but in reality, while some do, others loathe them.
Like Janis Ian, for example.
Regina is wonderfully played by beautiful Rachel McAdams (The Hot Chick).  Insecure Gretchen is played by Party of Five actress (and the voice of Eliza Thornberry!) Lacey Chabert.  Karen is played by newcomer Amanda Seyfried, who is still actually a high-schooler.  Despite this being her first film role, she looked familiar to me.  OT but I found out it is her face that graces the covers of the Victoria Martin series by Francine Pascal.
The plan against the Plastics first conjured up by Janis soon turns ugly.  It had been Cady's goal to destory the Plastics.  Instead, she takes Regina George's place as the leader of the gang and almost loses her two true friends.  And Regina is not happy.  The trouble between her and Cady begins when she falls for Regina's ex boyfriend, Aaron, played by Eric Bennett, I think - he's also a newcomer and so incredibly hottttt I cannot even describe it.  I pray to God I see him in more roles soon.
Cady grows into a mean, spoiled brat.  Aaron is a genuinely nice guy and after he and Regina reconcile and break up again, he is drawn to Cady until he sees her true colors.  Now she must deal with him disliking her - he sits in front of her in Advanced Calc.  Cady must also deal with the fact Janis and Damien can't stand the sight of her and that Regina's wrath can seriously be damaging.  Even her parents have noticed she's changed - and for the worse!  Cady's plethora of problems sorted out isn't dealt with in an easy-breezy fashion, which I really thought was to the movie's advantage.
Hilarious moments include a schoolwide brawl due to the Slam Book, a game of Trust that takes place in order for apologies to make rounds, comparisons to high school being similar to Africa's Survival of the Fittest, Cady's party in which Aaron comes up to her bedroom (OOH!), and certain lines I won't reiterate.  It's better you hear them for yourself and be surprised.
MEAN GIRLS is a coming-of-age comedy, basically.  Both children and adults will enjoy it - me and my mom loved it!  Critics overall have had positive things to say about this witty film. Hopefully, Tina Fey will write another screenplay soon.",1087171200,9,3740,4.648401826484018

2609599,3,B000GG4Y50,"The movie reflects a honest view of high school life in that it shows the desire to be somebody in a positive sense. The craving to be looked up to and admired, is still happening in a way through the hollywood circuit, even after high school. Fame and glory seem to be very important in the world in general. This is easily glimpsed in the movie by taking a really sweet innocent girl and putting her with the in crowd at high school and than seeing how control and power can corrupt faster than reciting the alphabet. I wish the movie had more of a dramatic edge to it so it could have been taking maybe a little more seriously. Although comedy is marketable and this comedy at times gets a little silly and unbelievable. It would have been really nice to actually see a mix of comedy, more curbed and drama with the story line yet I think this film will appeal to a young crowd. It has Lohan in the lead, who seems to be one of the queen bees herself in the disney crowd circuit, as well as jumping up in the teen tiger beat gen. Her real fame seems to conflict with the storyline in a way. It seems like they portray in real life what they are trying to act out, reflecting it as not a good thing. It seems kinda funny.  The need for attention becomes an addiction and the lose of self follows. I liked the premise. Some parts were not predictable and gave the film a neat style. Yet other parts were sickeningly predictable like the end. I wish it could have stayed true to its creativity. I thought the girls were pushing the envelope with the language, only in the sense that it will probably attract a younger generation as well as the teen crowd. Because I am an adult it was a bit tamer than many films I have viewed yet for a child this is showing Lohan as a regular teen with all the trimmings.

2609600,5,B000GG4Y50,"Lindsay Lohan makes her third big screen return within a year's time with THIS particular film about high school cliques, fitting in and all the dramas that go along with this particular drama queen.
THE STORY
Cady Heron (Lohan) was raised and home schooled waaay down in Africa and is thrust into a ""normal"" All-American high school and quickly ascends the social ladder by breaking into the `A-clique' ""The Plastics.""  As Cady finds out through her dealings with the various kids at school (her outcast gothic chick and gay guy friend, the Plastics and the math club) all is not so peachy in high school as kids frankly cannot get along.  Cady gets into a power struggle with overbearing and down and out mean Plastic's leader Regina George (`The Hot Chick's Rachel McAdams) after she falls for George's ex-boyfriend.  When the Plastic's slam book gets out an all out clique war breaks out.
THE COOL THINGS
We all have our own remembrances of high school (or if you are in high school) and can definitely understand and relate in parts to this film.  Of course, everything is TOTALLY exaggerated for comic effect but he can all relate.  All in all just watching the various interactions with all the different students and cliques is a fascinating experience.  The comic relief provided by goth chick Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan) and gay guy Damian (Daniel Franzese) are probably the major highlights of the film.
BEST SCENE
1. The talent show
2. Regina's lunch-time comeuppance
3. The Halloween party

I have known girls like The Plastics (though I avoided them like the plague).

2609636,4,B000GG4Y50,"I went in to this movie expecting yet another average teenybopper movie, but I was pleasantly surprised!  While it bears a striking resemblence to the infamous ""Heathers"" - it's more modern and a quite a bit funnier.  The movie was written by Tina Fey, of Saturday Night Live fame, who definitely has a future as a screenwriter, I believe!  For the most part, the movie is witty and amusing.  The time went by pretty fast, and I don't think there was a moment I looked at my watch out of boredom.
The cast was great!  Lindsey Lohan is s superb young actress who is pretty, but not artifically so.  She plays a teenage girl, Cady, just starting high school for the first time after being homeschooled for 17 years and travelling all over the world with her parents.  At first she doesn't fit in, of course, and becomes friends with a goth girl and a gay guy who like to make fun of the popular girls, aka ""The Plastics,"" led by Regina George.  The three of them make a plan for Cady to infiltrate the Plastics and basically ruin Regina's life.  The plan works a little too well, especially since Cady finds herself falling for Regina's on-again/off-again boyfriend.
The rest of the cast is pretty good... Tina Fey plays Cady's totally un-cool math teacher.  Amy Poehller (I'm sure I spelled her last name wrong), another SNL star, does a phenominal job playing Regina's mother who wants so badly to be cool and hip and her daughter's best friend, but comes off as totally crazy.  One of the funniest characters in the movie is math geek Kevin G (not sure who the actor is) who tries hard to be a cool DJ and ladies' man, but is also a ""mathlete"" (aka on the math team).
Overall the movie was funny and lighthearted, with a strong moral at the end.  The story moved at a good pace and kepy my interest the entire time, which is pretty uncommon.  I give it four and a half stars!  While most of the cast was great, I found the goth girl character to be pretty well, unlikeable.  I didn't have much sympathy for her and found her somewhat annoying.  Still, this is a great date movie - I highly recommend it!",1084752000,4,2104,4.4119170984455955
2609637,3,B000GG4Y50,"""Danny Devito!! I love your work!!"" - Damian scares another one away in ""Mean Girls""

Lindsey Lohan stars in this above average teen comedy, from Tina Fey of ""Saturday Night Live"" fame, that gets quite a few laughs but doesn't seem to delve into any real life situations other than the classic struggle between classes (the jocks, the dweebs, the click, etc.) in everyday school life.

Lohan is the new girl in school, fresh from living in Africa and home schooled all her life by her parents. Of course, she doesn't fit in at first, but is befriended by 2 class outcasts. A unique opportunity opens up for Lohan when the class click (that consists of 3 preppy girls known as ""The Plastics"") decide to induct her as a new member. The outcasts, with co-conspirator Lohan, see this as an oppurtunity to infiltrate and destroy the school controlling group and plot there revenge. However, all plans backfire, and all bets are off, when the leader of ""The Plastics"" uncovers the plot and decides to get even with devastating & hilarious results.

""Mean Girls"" is more of a crossbreed between any John Hughes teen-comedy and the less controversal, lighter moments from ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"", than the gross out school comedies from the past (""Mean Girls"" doesn't cover any new ground that the genre hasn't already touched upon). The film has laughs that one might find from the best sketches of ""SNL"", but no real memorable moments. Lohan gives another great performance (Hillary Duff may have the stuff, but Lohan is here to stay). ""SNL"" alum Tim Meadows & Ana Gesteyer are a bit painful to watch in their roles. Meadows is miscast as the high school principal (he may have been better as a confused guidance counseler than a confused principal). Gesteyer looks tired, & pained as Lohan's mom (she looks better on ""SNL"". trust me). Tina Fey shines as the math teacher who helps Lohan wake up & smell the plastic (Fey is a hottie, but, in some shots in this movie she looks older than she usually looks. I blame it on bad photography). Rachel Drasch is great as she lampoons all those single moms who strive too much to be the hip, cool mom, but, turn out to be slutty, washed up drunks. The ending of ""Mean Girls"" is one of the more original & happier (?) endings to this type of film that I've seen in a long time.

With the exception of Lohan being a hottie and Fey making comedy sexy, my hopes weren't to high for ""Mean Girls"". I can honestly say I was wrong. ""Mean Girls"" is definitely worth a date, to book for.",1084406400,6,2521,4.570796460176991

Although not based on a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit, this movie is swarming with SNL players.  Lorne Michaels produced it and Tina Fey wrote and stars in it as Cady's math teacher.  And unlike most SNL movies, this one is actually quite good and funny.  My one complaint is that instead of having a bit more edgy ending, they opt to take a more ""happy"" route.

2609694,4,B000GG4Y50,"There are three things I already believed before I went to go see ""Mean Girls,"" and which were not changed by watching the film.  First, you cannot be too mean to a mean girl because they are pretty much impervious to just about everything.  Both this movie and the book which inspired it, Rosalind Wiseman's ""Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends and Other Realities of Adolescence,"" have been the topic of talk shows where they have brought in real, live ""mean girls,"" and nothing on earth can get through their head that their are wretched human beings.  In this movie the effort to get the chief mean girl, Regina George (Rachel McAdams), by our heroine, Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan), does not go nearly far enough to really get through to her.  The point of a movie like this is for the villain to get her comeupance, and what happens here does not really satisfying the anger in my soul at such human beings.
Second, the worst year for mean girls is the 8th grade.  These mean girls are juniors in high school.  Granted, junior girls are as bad as it gets in high school, because senior girls tend to unclench their hair and enjoy their last year, but they have nothing on 8th grade girls.  That is when they hit puberty, before the boys and at a time when the boys are not worth pursuing, so they turn on each other.  Most of the mean things the mean girls do to themselves and each other in this film my youngest daughter says happens in her school all the time and she is only in the 7th grade.  These girls are getting off lucky.
Third, Tina Fey is the sexiest woman on television.  She is the sexiest woman on television because the head writer on ""Saturday Night Live"" is the smartest woman on television.  Not that her character is pretend smart, like Jennifer Garner's Sidney Bristow is smart on ""Alias,"" but really smart, as in a wicked bad sense of humor.  The fact that she is even more cute with those glasses on is just gravy, just like her first appearance in this movie.
Fey wrote the script for ""Mean Girls,"" and if anything she has softened her barbs because she actually has an important point to make to her audience and this movie is perfectly suited to bring her target group in because when I went to theater there were dozens of groups of young girls, teenagers and young, there to see the film.  The big question is whether or not this film will have any impact on the behavior of these girls.  If I had to make a bet, it would be that this film is going to inspire them to gang up on the mean girls at their own schools and turn the tables on them (not that this would necessarily be a bad thing given the notion of cosmic justice).
Lohan's character is considered a ""Martian"" by her new classmates, because she has been home schooled until the age of 16 while living in Africa, so she knows nothing about the social do's and don't's of high school (a state beyond that of Rory being a ""Mary"" on the first season of ""Gilmore Girls"").  She gets the perspective of both extremes of the high school girl world with Regina on the one side and Goth-girl Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan) on the other.  All this really does is teach her where the battle lines are drawn, but what she really needs is a crash course in how to play the game.  Fey tries to refrain from actually teaching girls to be mean girls, which puts her in a Catch-22 because she cannot give us satisfaction without being really mean and being really mean endorses the idea that is the only way to get satisfaction.
The only real flaw in the set up of ""Mean Girls"" is that there really is not a good reason for Regina to admit Cady to the Plastics inner circle, but you have to accept the idea so we can get on with the festivities.  After all, Regina does not need to co-opt the new girl in school to have her ostracized by the assembled masses.  The other concern I have is whether Fey should have given the articulation of the film's message to her own character when she points out to them why calling each other fat, stupid, and even worse names is not productive.
This 2004 film, directed by Mark S. Waters (""Freaky Friday"") has a handful of ""SNL"" performs.  Ana Gasteyer is wasted as Cady's mom and Amy Poehler is the film's one adult caricature as Mrs. George, but it is Tim Meadows whose controlled comic performance stands out among the older actors.  Of the kids the one who commands attention is Lacey Chabert as Gretchen Wieners, the Queen Bee's left hand dancer until Cady comes along.

Now, her parents have moved to suburbia and think it is time for her to attend a traditional high school.  If she thought the jungles of Africa were rough, she hasn't seen anything yet.  Upon entering her new school, she begins to see how much it is like the jungles of her previous home.  The kill or be killed world of teen queendom is even more viscious than a lions den at feeding time.  To make matters worse, the popular crowd takes an interest in Cady and invites her to join them.  Janice and Damian (Cady's true friends?) think it would be fun for Cady to join ""The Plastics"", and uncover their secrets, so as to destroy them.  Of course, when do things ever go as planned, Cady ends up liking the popularity and power that goes along with her new placement, and REALLY let's it go to her head.  The carnage that ensues is fabulous and hilarious.  It becomes a race to see who can be more conniving and back stabbing.  It couldn't be more fun.",1083974400,4,1109,4.283653846153846

The movie also makes you reflect on yourself, both young and old. Many times throughout the show I thought, ""Am I a mean girl? Would I ever do that to one of my friends?""

2609747,4,B000GG4Y50,"When I was watching the trailers, I thought that it was going to be a revenge comedy. Once I got to the movie, not so much. It was still Hilarious, but not what I expected. The movie is based on  the book:THE QUEEN BEES AND THE WANNABES. The movie focuses on the main character Caddy[Katie] who on her first week of school is embraced with ""The Plastics"" These horrible group of girls who are mean(as given in the title) to their peers. At first, she is onl ""a plastic"" because of her friends want the dirt on the group and laugh at them. There is also this BURN BOOK where they write  trash about people. Caddy turns mean herself and temporarly looses her buddies. If you have ever been to high school, you probably know the type of girls they are, Cruel. The movie is realistic in SOME areas of the movie, but meant to be Funny, which it is!! Tin Fey(SNL actress, writter for SNL) wrote this as well! So, now you know what to expect...

2609748,4,B000GG4Y50,"Ok, I've got to admit, every once in awhile, I like to go see one of those teen flicks that are just pretty much fluff, and nothing else: that's what I was expecting here, but this one turned out to be different.  Very different: extremely well written (great job Tina Fey), and appealing to anyone who has ever experienced embarassement in the hands of a fellow student (basically everyone!); I was expecting a light-feeling, comedy driven film that stuck to all the superficialness of high school cliques, and never went any further...but it surprised me when it did!
The movie pokes fun at all the stereotyped cliques: the popular girls, the smart kids, the asians, the geeks, the wannabees, etc.  In a subtle yet effective way, it poses the question ""why can't we all just get along?""; it addresses the issues that keep teenagers from being friends with each other, and even breaks down a few of those barriers along the way.
For those of you worried about content: there is a bit of language in this film: mostly it's many uses of the b-word and the slang version of it, as well as a few other curse words.  There's quite a bit of talk and scenes about high school/teenage issues: condoms, premarital sex, drinking/partying, etc.  You may want to take it in first, before taking a young child along.
I have to say I was pretty impressed with the mix of serious and funny in this film; well worth your time to go see it, and ""re-visit"" those high school days again.  You'll leave feeling like maybe there's some hope for high schools after all...",1083888000,2,1550,4.601449275362318
2609749,5,B000GG4Y50,At first I snubbed the movie because it looked like your average teen flick that would attract pre teen girls... but to tell you the truth I was blown away. This movie has got to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is hilarious and really well written. Lindsay Lohan is actually a really good actress and I will be looking forward to more of her movies. I have already seen this movie three times since it came out in the theaters last friday and I will be looking forward to buying the DVD. This is a must see movie.,1083715200,3,528,4.086538461538462
2609750,5,B000GG4Y50,"I can't remember the last time I laughed so consistently all the way through a movie. I have to wonder what is going on with Saturday Night Live, since this was produced by Lorne Michaels, written by Tina Faye, and every adult but one is a current or former SNL cast member. Why does the show suck so much when this movie was so great?
In any case, ""Mean Girls"" is probably the best teen comedy ever, sharp, funny, relentlessly unsentimental, with strong (but not perfect) acting, some clever twists and a solid soundtrack.
I don't know of any film that so well observed the nature of high school cliques (and cheerfully discusses groups like the ""angry hot black chicks"" who certainly were a clique in my high school), the way teenagers (particularly girls) treat each other and even the quirks of the teachers (unlike most teen films, they aren't all ciphers or buffoons here). A lot of the bits feel very authentic, including the central plot element of the Burn Book, in which the titular mean girls write things about the other students in the school to make themselves feel better. Other great bits include real-looking high school students (except for the four mean girls themselves), the terribly true to life wannabe ""cool"" parent and one of the girls dumbing herself down to be able to talk to a cute guy without it being corny and ridiculous like a feature-length afterschool special.
There's a bit of drinking (which ends with someone getting very drunk and embarassed) and a bit of talk about sex (which never goes anywhere beyond someone taking off their shirt), so it's a surprisingly family friendly film for parents of preteens.
A great film with an actual decent message, but which relentlessly refuses to give into cliches or heartwarming schmaltz. Strongly recommended to anyone who ever really wanted to like teen movies, stretching all the way back to the John Hughes era, but who found them a bit too nauseating at the end of the day.",1083715200,6,1957,4.758823529411765
2609751,4,B000GG4Y50,"I have to say, I was impressed with this movie.  Mean Girls was actually REALLY funny, and definitely one of the best movies out this year.
It is a PG-13 movie, and is meant for that age group and above.  I mean, it really is for Teenagers.  Not pre-teens, not tweens, it is meant for teens.  And a lot of the humor reflects that.  There are tons of jokes about sex, and there is some swearing (nothing to major, but b*tch and slut are used a ton).  I honestly am happy that this stuff made it in to the movie.  It is more realistic to have a teenager call someone a b*tch, than to have them use some softened word.
One little thing that bugged me though is that the movie is suppose to be set in Evenstan, IL.  And it is obviously someplace else.  One major tip off, they mention Old Orchard Mall, and even show the girls there.  The only problem is that I am pretty sure a good portion of Old Orchard mall is an open air mall, and the mall they are in is far from an open air mall.  Other than some of that stuff, (which I found amusing), the movie is pretty good.  A few jokes fall flat, mostly towards the end, but it actually has a very effective ending.  Recomended (15+)",1083628800,5,1177,4.109649122807017
2609752,4,B000GG4Y50,"after sitting through so many cliched, formulaic, and dumb teen movies, ""Mean Girls"" is like a breath of fresh air. The hilarious new comedy (written by Tina Fey, head writer and cast member of ""Saturday Night Live"")is about teenager, Cady Heron (played by an enchanting Lindsay Lohan), who lived in Africa with her parents and was homeschooled all her life until she moves to Illinois and enrolls in a high school. Cady quickly becomes one of the smartest girl in school , but is completely clueless when it comes to the rules of high school. Cady is clued in by two mis-fits: Janis, a very friendly semi-goth chick and Damian, who is described as ""too gay to function"". They tell her all about the different cliques (the cool asians, the black hotties, the jocks, etc.)and who sits with who at lunch. They also tell Cady about the most popular clique, 'The Plastics', who are the three most beautiful girls in school headed by the supreme queen bee Regina George (played very convincingly by newcomer Rachel McAdams). When Cady is invited to sit with them at lunch, she is urged by Janis to accept the invitation so Cady can act like kind of a spy, and get inside information on the girls (we are informed later why Janis is so bent on destroying Regina).The Plastics tell Cady their rules (they were pink on Wednesdays, and only wear their hair in a ponytail one day of the week)and she quickly  becomes a certified plastic. But things take an interesting turn when Regina finds out that Cady has a crush on her ex-boyfriend Aaron and instantly gets back with him just to make Cady jealous. After Cady sees them kissing each other at a party, she makes a plan to ruin Regina, but she gets carried away and goes a little to far.
One of the most refreshing things about the movie is its characters. I liked how the teachers were funny not because they were over-the-top unrealistic caricatures, but because they were just funny people, including a math teacher played by the script writer Tina Fey, who is one of the most realistic and human teachers I've ever seen in a teen movie. And i liked how the two misfits know that they are different from the peers, and genuinley don't care (Damian sings ""Beautiful"" at the talent show, which he does as sort of a tribute to his reputation); I liked how the plastics were made into real people who were mean because they felt like it would keep them popular, and they weren't portrayed just as the cliched evil beauty queens who are just mean for the heck of it. I especially liked Lacey Chabert as Gretchen, who has a nervous breakdown when she finds out that Regina might be mad at her, and through her situation Fey gives very wise insight into popularity ('I guess Gretchen felt it was better to miserable and apart of the plastics, then be banished from them'). There are also many memorable and hilarious scenes, and the movie gets lots of laughs from Regina's way to hip mother (brilliantly played by SNL cast member Amy Pohler),who offers to get Regina some condoms when she finds her making out with her boyfriend, and offers Cady some alcohol because she'd 'rather have her do it in the house'. The movie also has a great message about cliques and gossip, which makes for a sort of sugary ending, but the movie does earn it by then, and did put a little smile on my face. Also, this is probably one of the only teen movies I would encourage parents and even childless adults to see, because it has such witty and smart comedy that anyone could enjoy.",1083542400,4,3505,4.563492063492063
2609753,4,B000GG4Y50,"Thoese of us who have survived high school and those who are still in it, can really relate to this film.  It is not masterpiece theater, but it is definately smarter and more clever than its predecessors.  It doesn't single out a group of socialites, and it is't entirely about the chess club, it is about the entire high school population.  It really breaks high school down scientifically, which is kind of overdone at times, but hey it is a comedy movie.  Lindsay Lohan shines in another movie again.

  The movie was incredible, Lindsay Lohan was the perfect choice for Cady Heron, a quite home-schooled kid who gets corrupted by ""the plastics"" within the first week of her school year. As for the ""junior plastics"", I don't know how they'll be delt with, but I'm sure it'll be a sequel. Actually, I hope not, because it'll probably be one of those sequels that doesn't come out in theaters, only on video, like Bring it On Again. So, overall, this movie was INCREDIBLY grool!",1083456000,4,723,4.511450381679389
2609755,5,B000GG4Y50,"Mean Girls is a definite ""must-see"" for any Lindsay Lohan fan.  This movie isn't just for teenage girls either.  It is a good comedy (surprising, considering some of the cast are from Saturday Night Live - past and present) with some very realistic high school portrayals.  I watched the movie with my wife and daughter, but almost every other person in the theater was of high school age; I heard a lot of people mumbling about how accurate a lot of the stereotyping mentioned in the movie is (in other words, parts of the movie reminded them of their school, today).
As always, Lindsay Lohan played her part to perfection; she has more talent than most Hollywood actresses.  Lohan plays the part of a formerly home-schooled (in Africa) teenager who enters a typical high school after her parents move back to America.  She makes friends with two misfits who layout the general explanation of what Cady (Lohan) Heron is about to experience at the Illinois public school; a place where the students have given the word ""diversity"" a whole new meaning - mainly, ""separate and NOT equal""!  Geeks hang with geeks; the jocks hag with jocks.  You get the picture.
One group, The Plastics, have supreme status over most the other groups, especially in their ability to belittle the rest.  Rachel McAdams is excellent as the leader of The Plastics; I could not picture any other actress playing this part as well.  Her character drags Cady into her inner-circle and the fun begins.
There are a lot of great supporting actors and actresses in this film.  Most notably, Lizzy Caplan almost stole the show with her incredible performance as Janis Ian, one of the misfits who befriends Cady.  She was in Orange County and a few lesser known films and TV shows, but man can she act!
There are also a few ""not so good"" performances.  Tim Meadows is a great guy, but he seemed to be in skit-mode in this movie.  Same goes for Amy Poehler and Ana Gasteyer; they never seemed to fit on the silver screen as well as Tina Fey did.  I think Fey fits the silver-screen well.  I mean she is beautiful, smart, and has a great smile - yep, a star is born!
I enjoyed this movie; most of the people in the theater seemed to enjoy it (by the way, every show was sold-out); and if you think Lindsay Lohan is one of the hottest stars around, you'll enjoy this movie too.  Don't let the few lackluster performances scare you away; Amanda Seyfried, Jonathan Bennett, Daniel Franzese, Lizzy Caplan, Lacey Chabert, Tina Fey, Rachel McAdams, and Lohan all turn in GREAT performances, worthy of ticket price or future DVD purchase.
On thing I haven't mentioned is the message of this movie:  We need to worry more about ourselves, and that we shouldn't put others down just to make ourselves look better.  I think the movie managed to get that message across without being too corny.  (...)",1083369600,33,2856,4.642147117296223
