I like to learn about the different methods of yoga and this is slower paced yin/yang - I also purchased the other companion dvd.  She is very knowledge, I purchased her book also.  It is a great reference tool to deepen your practice and knowledge of Yoga.",1424736000,,330,4.754385964912281

I enjoy listening to Sarah give instructions for a while, but if I want to follow the DVD for years, I get tired of the same, repeated wording, which I begin to know off by heart.  I don't know who has CD rom's these days, they are seriously out of date so not being able to access part of the DVD through lack of a CD rom is problematic.",1406419200,,411,3.9397590361445785
8510997,3,B0076L0S30,"As I understand from the DVD cover and explanations, this yoga DVD (and the other in the series, Heaven) is meant to draw Earth energy into an energy center located in the belly. Here, energy is conceptualized in the traditional Chinese medicine way. So this kind of yoga is an innovative hybrid. I am wondering why there is a need to innovate yoga, when it is already tightly intertwined with a traditional Indian medicine system, Ayurveda. Assuming that practicing the sequence does have the intended effects -how do we know that it is appropriate to draw chi into the belly for a given individual at a given time? Energy work done without proper understanding and control can be harmful. I usually feel great after practicing yoga. I did not feel good at all after practicing along the 55 minute sequence.

From an asana standpoint alone, the sequence didn't flow smoothly for me. It didn't progress gradually through a warm-up and then back through a cool-down. There were very few counter-poses to balance out the standing ones that can strain the lower back. I felt the need to do forward bends, child pose, and twists throughout, and I did them at the end.

I did enjoy the content of the spoken track,  and did not think it was too much information. On the contrary, I would have liked to hear more detailed alignment cues. I did like the slow pace and the focus on the breath. Like another reviewer, I did feel her discomfort and anxiety during recording, but I could have put up with that if the asana and energy work felt good.",1345420800,3,1538,4.626373626373627
8510998,3,B0076L0S30,"I was looking for 'static poses' as I have in another yoga dvd, Yoga for Weight Loss. While this one fits that bill, as it isn't the up and down  routines, there is soooo much voice over, tooooo much information, to the point of distraction, for me anyway. It was a new workout but less than what I wanted in terms of exercise, and way more than what I wanted in terms of information. She should have included the information separately and left the pose holding with some nice music.",1341446400,2,484,4.377777777777778
8510999,4,B0076L0S30,"If you are looking for a hard core Rodney Yee type flow yoga you will be disappointed with this presentation.  The movement is slow.  There is no music. The set is pretty bare bones.

Nonetheless I was very intrigued by this practice.  I consider myself a medium level yogi.  I've been doing yoga daily for about three years. I found myself unable to complete the simple 55 minute practice the first time I tried it.  The poses are simple enough, it's holding them for as long as she does that is very challenging. Because I was having trouble even doing the exercise I didn't experience much of the chi flow or softness mentioned in the narrative.  Intrigued I decided to rotate this into a 40 day challenge.  After doing the video daily for about a week I find myself almost able to finish the sequence.

The results are interesting: doing this practice calmed my anxiety much more than any of the yoga videos I own that Advertise they are for depression/anxiety.  I think there really is something to this chi flow etc.

I also got hooked on the guided meditations.  I have been doing the 18 minute one more than once a day sometimes.  I think it helps, if you are new to meditation to have someone explain it.  I will admit at first it seemed funny that the producers didn't just release it as an audio version. I mean there's nothing to ""see"" while Sarah and her husband sit and meditation, but what you can do about that anyway.

One reviewer mentioned that she found this woman's voice annoying.  Sarah does seem to have an odd hesitancy in her voice. The cadence sounds nervous.  Maybe if she continues to make Dvd's she will hire an actor to read her script, because the words themselves are helpful guidance.",1336867200,7,1718,4.525974025974026

INSIGHT YOGA EARTH is one of two new DVDs offered by yoga instructor Sara Powers. Powers and her husband, Ty Powers, are founders of the Insight Yoga Institute. The DVD insert explains that Insight Yoga involves a balance between the lower body, which is the earthy or ""Yin"" region, and the upper body, the heavenly or ""Yang"" region. In Insight Yoga Earth, the emphasis is on drawing strength from the ""hara,"" or the belly center.  Both the two yoga practices and the two meditations on this DVD focus on deriving energy from the hara to nourish the entire body.

The Main Menu of the DVD offers the following options:

  Introduction (1.5 min)
  Practices Menu
  Special Features Menu

Selecting the Practices menu opens the following submenu:

  Practice Overview (9 min; audio only)
  Yoga Practices
  Grounding Down (55 min)
  Spiraling the Universal Chi (31 min)
  Meditation Practices
  Shamata Meditation (20 min)
  Vipassana Meditation (18 min)

I have provided a general overview of each practices below.  Powers and her husband are shown in a studio with wooden floors, and Powers instructs via voiceover.

YOGA PRACTICE #1:  Grounding Down
This practice is designed to maintain a healthy spine.  Powers begins on the floor in butterfly pose.  Several standing sequences follow.  The first is a lengthy warrior series which includes warrior 1, warrior 2, side angle pose, and a flow from warrior 2 to reverse warrior to side angle that is repeated for several minutes.  The second standing sequence is a series of balance poses, including tree, a variation on dancer's pose, and standing knee to chest.  Powers then performs flowing movements to open up the upper back and shoulders (e.g., arm circles, spinal twists, and elbow circles).  She concludes the standing work with chair pose, adding in lion's breath, and finishes out the practice by returning to butterfly.

YOGA PRACTICE #2:  Spiraling the Universal Chi
This practice is described as a combination of seated twists and core strengtheners.  Powers begins seated with a focus on diaphragmatic breathing; she uses the mantra ""om mani padme hum"" (heard in the background) to regulate the breath.  For the twisting segment of the practice, three versions of Sage Marichi's pose are performed.  This is followed by abdominal work that includes table/boat pose, lifted thread-the-needle pose, reverse plank, and full forward bend.  The practice ends with a 2.5-minute savasana.

MEDITATION PRACTICE #1:  Shamata Meditation
Powers notes that the translation of ""shamata"" is ""calm abidance"" and that the general practice of shamata involves attending to a simple object--in this case, the breath.  Most of this meditation is silent, as Powers encourages the breath focus.  She also suggests simply observing when the mind is wandering and then returning to the breath.

MEDITATION PRACTICE #2:  Vipassana Meditation
Vipassana means insight, or seeing things as they are.  In order to do this, Powers explains that this meditation combines mindfulness with inquiry.  Rather than a simple breath focus as in the Shamata Meditation, this meditation involves a focus on ALL details of the present moment.  The three actions of mindfulness which Powers teaches here are pausing, softening, and connecting.

Powers has a soothing manner in these practices, and those who have enjoyed her previous work will likely enjoy this DVD as well.  On the other hand, those familiar with other styles of yoga might have some difficulties connecting with her approach.  The first practice offers flowing movements, but it is certainly not a vinyasa or even a ""yang""-type practice.  And while the second practice is relaxing, the postures are not held at length as in the ""yin"" tradition.  Furthermore, there were a few things about Powers' presentation that I didn't like.  First, although the inclusion of the ""om mani padme hum"" mantra was potentially an excellent tool for breath regulation, Powers frequently talks over the mantra, making it difficult to hear.  Second, the meditation practices are quite lengthy, especially for those new to meditation; Powers might have better served her viewers a by offering shorter options.",1332979200,8,4345,5.186147186147186
