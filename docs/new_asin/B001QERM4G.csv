8335453,5,B001QERM4G,"This DVD just shows what great energy W13 has in their shows.  We all know he and the band were sick when this was filmed, but they still went out there and rocked.  This speaks to the work ethic and integrity of this band.  Wednesday is definitely one of the most underrated artists out there and should be playing much larger venues.  Although for selfish reasons I enjoy the smaller venues which make the show more personal and electric.  I truly hope Wednesday knows just how much his true fans love him and appreciate what he is putting out.  This DVD will never get old to me.",1469059200,,582,4.392523364485982

8335457,5,B001QERM4G,Wednesday 13 murder dolls etc. Is some of the most underrated music out there. The lyrics are fun and many times reflect what we all feel. And the concert dvd included is good,1388966400,,175,4.333333333333333
8335458,5,B001QERM4G,"This performance was done while Wednesday was a little under the weather but still has alot of raw energy. Just good clean, I mean dirty, fun.",1355097600,,142,4.5
8335459,5,B001QERM4G,"Wednesday 13 to me is one of the most talented rock artists to come out in a long time. Sure his lyrical topics are campy but intentionally so. As someone who was raised on classic horror films such as those produced by Hammer films, I can certainly relate. All camp aside, Wednesday's music rocks hard and is pure energy and angst. All of his solo recordings are excellent. The band is very tight throughout the performance and Wednesday of course delivers the goods and then some. I would have liked to have heard more material off of 'Transylvania 90210"" such as ""Bad Things"" and 'Haunt Me"" but the set list kicks ass as is. To me Wednesday's participation in ""The (excellent) Murderdolls"", will only serve to expose Wednesday 13 to a wider well deserved audience. I'm looking forward to much more from the new king of the horror / goth / rock genre. Highly recommended!!",1305158400,2,874,4.645161290322581
8335460,5,B001QERM4G,"Wednesday 13 is the singer for the Murderdolls. This live CD/DVD captures an awesome live performance by the Wednesday 13 solo band on their tour in support of their album ""Skeletons"". Wednesday 13, is a musical offspring of Alice Cooper & Rob Zombie with his own unique distinction.",1299456000,,283,4.916666666666667
8335461,5,B001QERM4G,Great show...Wednesdays voice was a little off due to sickness but its still a great dvd and a great value. All graverobbers should own this!!!!!!!,1288137600,3,147,4.92
