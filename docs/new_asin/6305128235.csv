969872,4,6305128235,"This is a very exciting video about the origin, history, developments, success and failures of the Internet. It has good detail in the topics and companies that refers, but it does not touch every important(historical level) company in the net.  Perhaps less time for ""excite"" and jokes, and more time to relevant companies and phenomena.",977961600,2,338,5.1454545454545455
969873,5,6305128235,"I belive this is one of the greatest video on the subject of internet and world wide web. It gives a clear picture of the internet and world wide web. It commends the work of great research scientists who were not recognised for their initial achievements. It gives an idea how the internet emerged and how big companies like 3com, Cisco came into existence. This is great story of all the nerds who worked hard (not for money) to achieve good things in their research. Finally I believe money is nothing and it all comes because of hardwork and luck.",972518400,2,551,4.52
969874,5,6305128235,"Cringely manages to succinctly and incisivly present the origins of the internet in a manner which both informs and entertains.
It should be compulsory viewing for everyone who works in the high tech industry.",914198400,4,209,5.176470588235294
969875,5,6305128235,This video is a well put together piece of histroy. I consider myself a computer guru and I learned new information. Yet my mother who is computer illiterate understood the simple explainations given by the host.,911952000,,212,4.916666666666667

7883409,5,6305128235,Good basic material for those interested in delving into the cyber world.  Connections were made which led to the early formation of the net.,1492387200,,141,4.875
7883410,4,6305128235,"Fascinating portrait of a key element in today's society.

Some outdated material, for sure, but even that makes the overall project intriguing as a glimpse into what went for ""tech innovation"" in the late 90s. These parts almost grant a kind of speculative ""Imagine the future, Nineties denizens!"" feel that makes for amusing but nevertheless interesting moments a la sci-fi of the 1950s looking ahead to the 80s.

Good times all around, with some surprisingly forthright interviews by folks who either built or are still building the modern tech industry today.",1417478400,2,563,5.175824175824176
7883411,5,6305128235,"This video is amazing!!  I love it!  Seriously because this video shows how the internet came into being, what was going on during those years and how quickly things were changing back then.  They interview many of the people that actually developed many of the standards we know now....but take for granted.

I discovered this video from my local library and rented it soooooo many times.  I love this video.

WHY ISN'T THERE A DVD??  Seriously...please...do this!!  This video is an important historical video of the birth of the internet and the PC.  There is sooooo much that should be preserved in this video.  Please PBS....a BluRay would be outstanding and I would pay a premium to own this.",1391644800,,698,4.7899159663865545
7883412,4,6305128235,"This is a fascinating, educational history of the ARPANET and the early years of the Internet. The videos are packed with interviews with pioneering engineers who designed and built the ARPANET, and entrepreneurs who pursued Internet-related business opportunities. If you're a person who likes tech history and/or business history, you'll enjoy these videos. There are 3 VHS tape cassettes in the set, titled as follows: (Vol. 1) Networking the Nerds, (Vol. 2) Serving the Suits, and (Vol. 3) Wiring the World. My favorite is Volume 1. I show a large chunk of it in my telecom and networking classes. Students enjoy it and find it eye-opening.",1384732800,,644,5.084905660377358
7883413,5,6305128235,"Nerds 2.0.1: A Brief History of the Internet is a 1998 three hour documentary film that explores the development the internet. It was written and hosted by Robert X. Cringely. It serves as a sequel to Triumph of the Nerds,a documentary about personal computers.

The documentary explores the development of the Arpanet and email from the Department of Defense in the Military, the Internet, and the World Wide Web in the United States from 1969 to the time the documentary was featured. Also,it discussed the invention of the ethernet at the XEROX PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) during the 1970's. In addition to that,it discussed what created dot-com boom of the late 90's.

I would say that this was a great documentary about the early days of the internet. Many of the dominant companies of the internet that were features when the documentary was done are no longer relevant at present like Excite and 3Com. In fact,it never even discussed Google,who at that time still has yet to be incorporated. Cringley stated in 2012 during the commentary of the Steve Jobs:The Lost Interview that Google has yet to incorporate itself and the check was still in the hands of its venture capitalists. Aside from that,it also features some of the rising titans of the early dot-com bubble wherein Netscape and America Online (AOL) were still dominated the browser wars and the early days of networking companies like Novell Systems and SUN Microsystems as well as software companies like McAffee and online shopping company called Amazon at the point that it has yet to make a profit. Finally,I felt sorry after the founders of Cisco Systems - Sandy Lerner and Leonard Bosack - were politically outmanuevered by the venture capitalists by kicking them out of the company. And last but not the least,it also features the early days of the browser wars particularly between Netscape and Microsoft.

But overall,one would surely enjoy this if for techies who want to learn about the early days of the internet revolution and how the technology came about.",1375574400,,2044,4.9533527696793005
7883414,5,6305128235,"This,  along with the ""triumph of the nerds"" tape tells how personal computers and the internet got started. Trust me, a very fascinating story.",1358380800,,144,5.0
7883415,4,6305128235,"I've been using this series in my Web Design class for three years. The video is packed with good information and is clearly presented. I have not found a better video covering the history on the WWW.

Down side? It looks dated and is a bit cheesy at times. It would be great to see an updated version.",1254441600,2,302,4.206896551724138
7883416,5,6305128235,"This was a gift for someone who already had the Nerds video, but I ruined it for him.  Everything must be OK, since he has made no comments.",1247184000,,140,4.0
7883417,5,6305128235,"First, Cringley is great, and makes a great documentary. Howerver, years later, in 2007, this documentary is pretty hilarious. What a trip down memory lane before the apocalyptic meltdown of 2000. Its funny hearing, that Excite and Amazon are valued at over ""1 billion dollars"". I loved the history of how the Internet was actually created by DARPA. Definately worth watching.",1189036800,,376,5.180327868852459
