8022642,3,B0002677AI,"""An abandoned gold mine in the heart of Central Brazil, two outcasts live in extreme circumstances.  A nosedive into the souls of two Brazilians lost in one of the country's forgotten corners.""

This is typical of many Brazilian films .... a depressing glimpse into the negative aspects of life in Brazil including poverty and violence.  The main reason I bought the DVD was to help me learn about Brazil and the Portuguese language.  There are only two actors in this film, and the plot is simple.  Can these two strangers build a successful life together living in such desolate circumstances?  To find out buy the DVD.",1248566400,,621,4.811320754716981
