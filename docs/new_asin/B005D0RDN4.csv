Danni remains in her own.

The ending of the movie should be obvious from the fact that it's set at Christmas, and that's OK. We know where Christmas movies tend to head, and that predictability is often part of their charm. But for me, this one had just too much deus ex machina, too much insincere schmaltz, and too little believability. I wanted to like this, but I got the impression that the characters were mostly going through the motions, acting their hearts out when the script didn't offer support. I hope others like the movie, but I'm afraid it didn't do much for me.",1320624000,6,1675,6.900943396226415
8466091,3,B005D0RDN4,"A magical switch of identities movie.  Two girls, one a foster child and the other a spoiled rich girl, get switched after crashing into each other after making wishes on a Christmas tree star at a school dance.  A party planner also makes a wish at the same time, she wanted to find a sister she wish she had, and that throws a wrinkle in the mix.  The two girls realize that they are mixed up right away, but no one will believe them.  When they convince the party planner they feel it is up to her to get them back to the right bodies.  The party planner who is working on a big party with the rich girl's mom doesn't want to lose the deal and agrees to help.
Fun storyline acted well by the girls, but for some reason Amber Benson just didn't fit well for me.  If she had I probably would have added another star.  Nice family movie.",1417564800,,837,4.12962962962963

and enjoyed it for what it is...
a Lifetime movie.

I feel, everyone gave it they're all, and
had a lot of fun in the making of this.

A very cute and different kind of
Christmas time movie and for the
price... it certainly is worth adding to
your Christmas DVD collection.

All the acting was done pretty good...
even though a little bit overboard at
times.

Still worth watching, and having for
next year.

The ending was quite a Surprise
and done Very well too!!!

Didn't expect that at all!! WOW!!!",1413590400,,538,4.438775510204081

8466096,4,B005D0RDN4,"I first saw Holiday Wishes on Lifetime and was ecstatic as I'd never heard of it and it starred Britt McKillip and Amber Benson, two of my favorite actresses. While the story does not contain much depth, it doesn't need to. It's a very wholesome story about the meaning of family, and cherishing loved ones. When a poor foster child and a snobby rich girl wish on a star at the same time, their souls are switched into one another, and each must experience life as the other one, and ultimately unite in friendship to return to themselves. Life lessons are learned and experienced, as is the meaning of family and judgement. I highly recommend this as a family film, most likely to be enjoyed by young girls. I was so happy to find it here on Amazon and purchased it immediately, as I'd never seen it for sale anywhere else, nor on Netflix. For a wholesome family film, it is an extremely cheap and reasonable price. My only personal complaint is that it is not in widescreen, however, being that it originally aired on television, it's possible it was not manufactured for widescreen release.",1356825600,2,1093,4.61025641025641

8466100,3,B005D0RDN4,"The 411:

I was a big Buffy The Vampire Slayer fan so seeing Amber Benson ""Tara"" in another role was exciting. Amber Benson plays Danni Hartford a party planner who spends her off time looking for a sister she hardly remembers having except for a photo of her and another little girl.

Britney is the daughter of Danni's clients. A spoiled rich girl who wants for nothing but a horse of her very own. Rachel is an orphan shuttled from house to house who only wants a family to love her.

After being mistreated by her foster siblings on a horse farm, Rachel makes a wish the same time Britney and Danni do while looking at a star on a Christmas tree. The girls bump into each other and Britney and Rachel switch bodies.

It's Freaky Friday turned into a holiday movie with an extra. The script is weak and the acting just OK but this is a Christmas Movie and in the end who doesn't love to watch movies about Christmas at Christmas time?

Originally a Lifetime Movie that aired in 2006",1322006400,6,985,4.360655737704918
