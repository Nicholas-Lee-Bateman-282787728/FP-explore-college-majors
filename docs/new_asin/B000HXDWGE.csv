2648615,4,B000HXDWGE,"Having watched this novela in its entirety as it ran, I loved it!!!! The DVD version leaves a little to be desired because it cuts out important parts of the story or even entire story lines. Nonetheless it is a wonderful way to get Mario Cimarro around the clock, and that's very enjoyable.

I actually had a problem with the product...it's 5 DVDs...and I was sent a duplicate of one DVD and did not get number 5. Amazon fixed it though and now I have a complete set.",1170115200,,468,4.318181818181818

2648618,3,B000HXDWGE,"I watched this show when it aired, I wanted to see it again, unfortunately,  too much has been taken out, the relationship between the characters was the main attraction for me and half of the cast was barely shown. If I hadn't seen the original, a lot of what happened in the edited version wouldn't have made any sense,  As it is, I spend most of the time explaining to others  who had not seen  the show why certain events too place etc... A word should be sent by the creators of the novelas that their work has been  downgraded to incomprehension. This is not the first novela that I have  bought and found wanting , but this time they went beyond editing, some scenes were switched around in order for the story to make sense, and some relationships vital to the story were obliterated.",1166227200,25,792,4.427586206896552

2648683,5,B000HXDWGE,"El Cuerpo del Deseo (""Body of Desire"" 720 minutes)

Here is a super macho hombre who never met a shirt he could wear for over five minutes. His specialty: Smolder, smolder, smolder.... He is actually the reincarnation of Pedro Jos Donoso (Andrs Garca), an elegant, successful businessman who had married Isabel (Lorena Rojas), a lovely, ambitious, much younger woman only to die of a ""heart attack"" soon after the wedding.

Before his death, Pedro Jos had been troubled by dreams of Santiago (Mario Cimarro), an illiterate peon working in a field who he watches die. When all is said and done, our nice older fellow is back, but in the strapping young body of the peon, long hair and all. He is horrified to awaken in the peon's casket being carried to a cemetary, so in that small village his ""resurrection"" is a scandal and a miracle.

After some initial confusion (he is shocked by his image in a mirror and doesn't understand what happened), he is unable to convince anyone of his real identity, they just think he's crazy, although it is more difficult when they discover that now he can read and write, not only Spanish, but other languages, too.

Fleeing the peon's life (smelly wife, dirt floor in hut, fleas in his bed) he becomes a chauffeur in his widow's home, unaware of the role she played in his death. His trusted protg Andrs (Martn Karpan), is the mastermind behind the whole devious plot but it takes him two discs to learn the crushing news. Tia Rebeca (Martha Picanes) is only one of the many middle-aged women who find our reluctant hero irresistible; she has an impressive array of wigs, so she has a different hair style for practically every scene.

Our chauffeur takes his daughter ngela (Vanessa Villela) under his wing although she has no idea who he really is. (This actress bears an uncanny resemblance to Scarlett Johansson.) In the meantime the peon's widow is hot on the trail of her missing, and possibly alive, husband.

Valeria (Diana Osorio), a good friend of the evil widow, had been taking piano lessons from the businessman before he died and they enjoyed classical music together. She feels an affinity with the chauffeur, almost as close as her dead mentor.

Got it so far? Now you're on your own. This totally unpredictable story is engrossing from beginning to end. I like it because I never saw the original, so the editing doesn't bother me! I got my copy through Amazon.",1403740800,,2416,4.710900473933649

Ma compr los vdeos porque es una serie que descubr cuando ya haban emitido ms de la mitad de los episodios y quera verla desde el principio, pero cuando me puse los del final y me d cuenta de lo mucho que han cortado de lo que ya he visto, no me fo de lo que habrn hecho con la primera parte.
Es una lstima, mereca la pena haberla grabado entera, aunque fuese ms cara y con el doble de DVDs que hacer lo que han hecho.

2648691,3,B000HXDWGE,Not the best soap opera I've ever seen but yet it's ok. If you like mysteries of the afterlife. Average,1370131200,,103,4.2
2648692,5,B000HXDWGE,"This is actually a 4 DVD abridgment presentation of a ~ 105 hour Spanish language telenovela.  The 5th DVD  has things like interviews of actors & bloopers.  It has large lettered English subtitles, which can be turned on or off.  In addition, Spanish captions can be displayed if you set your TV set (monitor) to display (analog) captions.  The producer, Telemundo (a Spanish language TV network) airs telenovelas with both English & Spanish captions, which can be selected on one's TV set (monitor).  If you activate Spanish captions, then the Spanish words will be displayed over the English subtitles, both on the screen at the same time.  Myself, I use 2 monitors side by side with a DVD player so that I can have English on one & Spanish on the other.  The recording quality of what I have seen thus far is excellent.

The idea of abridging this telenovela is not bad.  Judging from this show & from another telenovela by the same author, Julio Jimenes wastes a lot of time (for me) by first having an action scene or a primary discussion scene, then having the same thing one already saw, repeated over by minor characters, talking about it.  The repetitions to me are boring, but some evidently like them.  There is a lot of time wasted in the original watching people dancing, hearing minor characters blather at the mouth or quarrel, seeing repeated entradas (title screens, etc.).  A character may drive somewhere & time is wasted with lengthy views of the person driving.  If a ghost plays the piano on different nights, the production may take up a lot of time playing the same music played over & over, while you watch persons in the mansion comment on it & walk to gather outside the haunted room numerous times.  ""Let's go check out the piano.""  ""No, don't dare.""  ""But we must."" ""No, we dassan't.""

If you want to see it all, about 99 percent of this telenovela is available to view on line free from YouTube & Dailymotion.com.  However, YouTube has an abundance of capitulos w/ missing parts:  It may have cap 24-1 & 24-4, but not 24-2 & 24-3.  The quality is better on Youtube than on Dailymotion, but many parts are missing from YouTube.  Daily motion has a majority of the episodes (captulos) in whole or joined in doublets.  The problem with dailymotion is that it is hard to search to find what it has.  Usually the best way to locate a capitulo is to use this string (say for episode 124) on google search:  ""El Cuerpo del Deseo124"" site:dailymotion.com  Note how some episodes have a space between Deseo and the capitulo number, others run it without space like Deseo124.  In rare instances there were small parts that I could only find on a site that presents this telenovela with Russian lip synch -- so I could watch, but not hear Spanish for those parts.  For the Russian version, go to serialsonline a dotnet.  See the comments section on this review.

I don't know where you can find ECDD online with captions or subtitles (captions & subtitles are not the same, incidentally, but similar).  There are sellers of telenovelas DVD's online; but I only know one source that has DVD's with the captions recorded.  The source for captioned DVD's probably has to be American.

Incidentally, Telenovelas are not Soap Operas.  Generally Telenovelas are like novels put on screen. They have a conflict, resolution, & end to the story, usually lasting 6 months to one year (not unending).

The main drawback to this telenovela is that it has a few pornographic scenes.  The idea is that this guy has a Cuerpo del Deseo (a Body of Lust) which women cannot resist.  It is produced in the style of ""Magic Realism,"" which is a genre of telenovela in which magic is employed or the supernatural.

SPOILER FOLLOWS:

 This one is essentially, IMHO, a tragedy.  An old man marries a young woman; then he dies.  At the same time a young man seems to die also, but probably goes into ""catatonia,"" which in telenovelas means he seems dead, but isn't.  When that happens, the old goat who dies has his spirit leave his corpse & go into the body of the young man who just collapsed.  So the old goat suddenly finds himself in the body of the young man, inside a coffin on the way to burial.  He busts out of the coffin -- then fun & games follow.  The young man was a brute, ignorant, country farm worker.  The old goat had been refined & intelligent, a rich business man & master of the piano.",1363132800,5,4402,4.59178433889602

2648696,4,B000HXDWGE,"I really enjoyed this telenovela from Telemundo.  The story is a life-after-death tale of redemption - a departure from the usual telenovela plot lines but very well done.  Mario Cimarro and Lorena Rojas are terrific in the lead roles.  Other reviewers claim to be disappointed because the DVD version is heavily abridged from the prime-time TV version - but I wonder what in the world they are thinking.  All DVD telenovelas are condensed from 100 - 150 hours of first run TV time down to about 12-14 hours of DVD time.  In order to keep prices reasonable, how could it be otherwise?  The question is not *whether* the DVD version is abridged, but rather *how well* it has been edited.  I think the editors of the El Cuerpo del Deseo DVD did a great job here; the story line is easy to follow and the action flows as smoothly as can be expected.  I enjoyed this telenovela tremendously and highly recommend it.",1326499200,5,911,4.580246913580247

I was surprised to find that it had substance and wasn't just about sexual desire, which was what I thought from the title. But I was disappointed to find that a lot had been edited out, but luckily my friend caught me up on important parts.

It jumped a lot of episodes, many were ommitted.  i was not happy after investing such amount thinking  I would get complete epispode, I ended having less than what I got from the TV even when I did not watch the TV all through.

I am not comfortable with this DVD.  If it is not that I have opened it, I would have sent it back because it was a disappointment.  I was promising my wife that we would get the original DVD from you, when I recieved it with the high spirit I got something different.

It took a long time before the following actors and actress appeared: (Antonio, Simon and Valeria); even when Antonio and Angela were dating and Don Pedro was against with the relationship was not shown and many others episodes that I may not be able to state.

Having said that, I was a little disappointed because most of the scenes were removed, important scenes I most say! some characters were erased and later surfaced out of the blues. I also noticed that some of the character's stories were cut off. Now if I had not watched some parts of it in Nigeria, it would be difficult to put two and two together. In general, the editing part of it all was very unsatisfactory.

However, it was nice to know I could get a feel of it though. I will buy it again if nothing is distorted. In other words if the original is available I don't mind getting it. That's how good the movie is !",1214265600,,927,4.202247191011236

2648721,5,B000HXDWGE,"Telemundo/Universal put together an excellent release. Yes, it is edited down to 12 hours like all novellas that are being released, but i personally do not mind as all the fluff/unnecessary scenes are cut that drag out the novellas for 6 months.
Televisa/Xenon's releases make 2.5 hr long discs with no breaks, making it a little difficult to find where you left off, unless you leave the disc in the DVD player.  It is like splicing together 4 episodes of Ugly Betty with no breaks inbetween.  Not here.  Telemundo/Universal formed new ""episodes"" to break it up and take you back to the menu.  I like this alot better.
This is an excellect novela, the actors have great chemistry, and the production is top notch.  This is one of the better novellas I have seen.  Enjoy !!!!!",1208304000,6,777,4.676470588235294
2648722,3,B000HXDWGE,"Well, I must have to agree with the majority and the editing was done poorly, far two many important scenes were cut, were as the original series  had more in depth scenes to tell about the characters involved. This dvd lacks the passion and depth..

2648723,1,B000HXDWGE,"To say I was disappointed will be an understatement. I had watched about six episodes of el cuerpo del deseo in Nigeria when I went on holidays. I bought the dvd in hopes of continuing where I left off. As I watched the previous episodes, I realized that most interesting and main scences where cut out. The dvd seemed like a summary instead of a story. For example, I didn't see Isabella's mother who was a total comic in the soap. Why they would do something like that, I have no clue. Not a great buy, I would say.",1201132800,2,517,4.232323232323233
2648724,5,B000HXDWGE,"Cuerpo Del Deseo was given to me as a gift. There is full language selection available on all 4 of the story discs. The fifth disc is out takes and interviews and you have to know Spanish to get it...as a lot of the out takes are language gags. The novella is really well subtitled. The only thing missing over the TV version is the arrival of the sexy musical and pure Valaria. You can figure out who she is quickly. This is a story that pits pure evil and vengeance against forgiveness and raw sexiness against the enduring love shown by a young mother who lives in poverty on a campo. Great illustration of the concept that justice and love are eternal values. We love this dvd set. Oh yes, and the main characters are so attractive they take your breathe away.

I would have paid to get it in its entirety from the U.S.  As it is, I'm getting it from Europe.  Too bad Amazon lost a sale.",1183334400,,256,3.9411764705882355
2648729,5,B000HXDWGE,"1) Quality and editing:

For someone who has not watched the original version on TV this will definitely be an enjoyable and addicting story to watch (it will be very hard to stop once you start watching it!)I have to say that Telemundo/Universal is doing a much better job than Televisa in the DVD release department of ""condensed telenovelas"" as the editing is smoother and much more seamless.

2)Content:

I do agree with the fans that complain that too much content has been cut out. I really don't know why these multi million dollar corporations can't release larger versions without compromising the content and the story so much (cut out the excess ""filler"" scenes and episodes used to extend the life of a sucessful drama while it is on the air, but leave the complexity of the stories and characters intact!)",1180483200,5,818,4.787234042553192
8142410,2,B000HXDWGE,"I did not like it because they cut very important and funny parts to abridge the novela.  If you had not already seen novela, then it would not matter but when you see the entire Novela on Netflix, buying a Novela with parts missing sucks.  They cut the best parts.  They should add more DVD's to the set so that the entire Novela is shown.  It also happened with another Novela called Passion de Gavilanes.  They cut the best parts or parts needed to fully understand the Novela.  We are very disappointed.  They should not touch the Novela.  If you keep it the way should be you would have happier customers.",1524528000,,610,4.4324324324324325
