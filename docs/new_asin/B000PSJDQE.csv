8193157,5,B000PSJDQE,"Recomended for anyone who loves Motown classics particularly from the 4 Tops, Temptations and of course Smokey Robinson.  Brilliant covers of ""You Are Everything"" and ""If you don't know me by now"".  One of the extras is Human Nature doing a commentary over the entire concert which is highly entertaining.  The concert was recorded around 2006 and having seen them live in Las Vegas last year, their performance has become more polished but this DVD is great fun.  Love it!",1358208000,,473,4.875
8193158,5,B000PSJDQE,"This Concert is amazing started out with the MC Doug Parkensin who done an excellent job getting the crowd started with his unique way of introducing the guys and then as the guys began the concert it was excellent. The behind the scenes gave a look into what they do and a special thing that they did for one fan to make her night special.  The bonus feature include the photo gallary and performance by Doug with the Funk Foundation even you can choose to play the concert with Andrew, Mike, Phil, Toby doing the Comentary and it is a must hear.  Overall the Concert was fantastic I was on my feet singing, dancing and having a good time.

Advice that I have for Amazon is to post the fact that the Dvd dosen't work in american DVD player that they would have to get an Multi region player for it to work instead of posting it where the reviews are post it at the very beginnig where they should see that before they see the DVD. You would elimate a whole lot of people returning it you might even sale a multi region player with this wonderful DVD.",1338595200,,1051,4.271356783919598
8193159,5,B000PSJDQE,"This is an excellent concert, complete with a little bit of Australian swag.

[First, please note that this DVD is PAL which plays in European players, but can not be played in American DVD and Blu-ray players.  You need a multi-region DVD player to watch this video.]

Human Nature is a polished Australian quartet with solid harmonies and fine solos, coupled with dance moves and grooves.  In this concert, they pay tribute to Motown, including the excellent a cappella song, ""The Tracks of My Tears"".  This concert is long, at about 1 hour, 44 minutes.

8193160,5,B000PSJDQE,"I went to see this group live in Las Vegas last month at the Imperial Palace hotel. They did a Motown show and sang songs such as the Supremes' ""You Keep Me Hangin On"" and ""River Deep Mountain High.""  They also sang songs by the Temptations, Marvin Gaye, Smokey and the Miracles, Four Tops etc.  I am not normally a boy band fan but they were sensational.  I grew up and was a teenager when Motown was on top of the world.  These fellows did all these songs justice and put on a high energy show with impeccable vocals.  My favorite was Toby Allen, the bass or baritone singer.  He stands out on the acapella version of Ooh, Baby Baby by the Miracles.  He seems the most animated and truly having the most fun of the four, however that is not to take away from the rest of the group that give their all and have fun as well. And such great singers. If you get to Vegas, you must see this show.  If not, get this DVD especially if you like Motown.  Even their own top hits from Australia are great songs.",1308787200,3,1003,4.155440414507772
8193161,5,B000PSJDQE,"We saw these guys in Vegas and were blown away. They are sponsored by Smokey Robinson and put on a great show at the Alladin. This DVD was made earlier in Sydney. not as good as the Vegas show but still lots of fun. We loved their voices, enthusiasm, and showmanship.",1294185600,,267,4.254901960784314

8193165,5,B000PSJDQE,"The most AMAZING MOTOWN Show I have ever seen.  More electrifying than the originals.  I didn't know who they were but when I watched it I felt they had been rehearsing for years.  The songs are the BEST Motown had to offer, the moves more brilliant than even MJ and the showmanship is devasting.  Excellent.",1258761600,,308,4.545454545454546
