8159023,5,B000KSY8FK,"Lena Horne --  what a woman she was!  Beautiful, talented, funny, classy, exceptional.  She was the best.  This is a hard to get video.  I wish it was on DVD, but the video is an exceptional one since the picture is very clear and the sound is very good.  I love Lena Horne.  She was an exceptional talent and a very beautiful woman.  What a voice she has.  She can be funny as well.  This one woman show won awards for a reason and if you see it, you'll understand.  The songs she sings are well chosen and the dancers and band are A-one compliments to her singing, story telling and performing.  She puts her own stamp on every song she sings.  No one can sing a song the way she can.  She makes familiar old songs seem brand new and as though you've never heard them before and her interpretation is so on target that it's amazing.  I honestly couldn't leave my seat for one minute this show was so entertaining and enjoyable, but I expected no less from the one and only, super-talented Lena Horne.  There will never be another one ever.  Thank goodness, this exceptional show was recorded for new generations to see.  This tape is a treasure indeed to cherish and watch over and over again.",1440547200,2,1195,4.3545454545454545
8159024,5,B000KSY8FK,Lena Horne is absolutely phenomenal in this video. It needs to be upgraded to DVD. She is an amazing performer. You will love it. I was not around to appreciate her when she was alive. I wish I could have seen her live bit this video is the next best thing. She is stunningly beautiful even at 65. Check it out.,1399161600,,311,4.114754098360656
8159025,5,B000KSY8FK,Fabulous. Best performance ever in a one-woman show. A total stunning video. Should be reissued as DVD and seen by everyone who thinks they know what a star is.,1381449600,,160,4.551724137931035
8159026,5,B000KSY8FK,"i cannot believe this hasn't been transferred to Bluray/DVD yet....someone is really dropping the ball, hello is anyone out there?  Geeze.  Long live the TRUE Diva.",1346630400,2,164,5.269230769230769
8159027,5,B000KSY8FK,"I had the great honor of seeing her perform this show live in my hometown, with my best friend from the second row, center right and it was just wonderful!  I still have that beautiful program with her signature ( I was lucky that evening) among by collection of souvenirs.

I had always been a fan since I was a little girl, as the family watched all of  her movies and television appearances; but in person, on stage, she was magically mesmerizing.  You could not take your eyes off of her for one single moment as she recounted the story of her life, interspersed with the music that made her famous.  One of my very favorite stories she told was the one about the role she was supposed to have in ""Showboat"" and the makeup (by Max Factor I think) created for her (light Egyptian), that wound up all over the gorgeous face of Ava Gardner instead.

The way she told the story, was very funny...and also, very sad (a reflection of the attitudes of that era).

The story of her parents, her children, her career, and love life...her many struggles.....all recounted with such dignity and grace (The Lady)....and of course all of that lovely music.  If you think you liked hearing her sing ""stormy weather"" on television.....it cannot compare to hearing her in person. As she said herself....at that point in her life the song had so much more meaning.

Not purchasing the tape for this show has been one of my most painful missed opportunities.  Like the other reviewers, I too hope this can be remastered for high definition viewing.

When she passed away, I actually went online to 60 minutes hoping to find a showing of that Ed Bradley interview he did with her as they walked and talked.  Of all the interviews he did for the show I liked that one the best.  I too think it would be absolutely wonderful to have it as a special feature for the ""redo"" of this on HD DVD.

As my father would have said...Long Live the Queen.",1295827200,6,1926,4.481375358166189
8159028,5,B000KSY8FK,"Well I have yet to see the entire show. But from what I have seen from clips from her 60 minutes interview I'm sure it is Beyond Fantastic. I hope it will come to DVD regular and Blue Ray. I just hope they include some special features on it, like Mayber her 60 minutes interview or her Sank, Crest, and Post Natural Bran Flakes Commercial. Well hopefully it will come to DVD this or next year and I hope it stays in print for a while.",1284422400,3,435,4.069767441860465
8159029,5,B000KSY8FK,This video and show is one of the best that I have ever seen.  She is also one of the classiest ladies that I have ever worked with. Please re-release this on the DVD format for the youth of today to have the unique experience of enjoying Ms. Lena Horne.,1275782400,10,254,4.08
8159030,5,B000KSY8FK,I hope that people will begin to realize what a treasure this VHS was and will reissue it on DVD. It is one of the high points in the American Theater by a show business legend. Please lets get this reissued by this great artist. This is a true keepsake.,1273968000,9,254,4.1
