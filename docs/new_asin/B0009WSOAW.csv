8068734,4,B0009WSOAW,"Pat is an excellent flatpicker and demonstrates some great techniques for learning how to navigate the fretboard. He shows how to use open chord shapes from the first position and apply them for soloing up the neck. Please note, this is not for beginners or those that don't have a basic knowledge of the fretboard. Recommended for players who have some experience soloing. All sections are demonstrated full speed, there are no parts that are slowed down. If you're stuck or in a rut with your soloing, this is a good DVD to help you start moving forward again.",1390003200,4,562,4.686868686868687
