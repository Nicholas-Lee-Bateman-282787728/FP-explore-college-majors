Edit: no no no... the subbing on this is crap.... sometimes there's not sub to read so you miss important parts, or it's in kanji, the sub time is slow ...it's fine because I've watched this already... but what if someone new bought it and was watching it for the first time?",1494806400,,476,4.230769230769231
