7832780,5,6302980704,"I own many Vicente Fernandez movies, but this one by far is my favorite. I love the storyline and Vicente does a great job in portraying the role of a young man that despite poverty and a physical defect, still strives to aim high and change all that. The comedic role of ""Memo"" serves well to give some parts of humor throughout the film. Around 5 classic songs are excellently sung by Chente in the film, and the character portrayed by Vicente does leave one inspired. Ending is rather tragic, but well worth the overall movie line. Great acting by Jorge Rivero; the villan, and Amparo Munoz; the love interest as well.",1305331200,,621,4.553571428571429
7832781,3,6302980704,"I'll admit Vicente Fernandez is not the best actor, but I like the story of how the rich always outrank the poor, and I think the song he sings "" El Tahur"" is one of his greatest.",1107216000,,179,3.864864864864865
7832782,1,6302980704,A Thoroughly boring film dealing with gamblers and their love and competition for a woman.not one of Vicente Fernandez best films.,1039132800,,130,5.238095238095238
7832783,2,6302980704,"This film features a good cast, but the story is merely conventional,i'ts Mexican-Spanish co production roots are difficult to hide and it doesn't seem like a Mexican or a Spanish film but a mixture, the movie lasts much too long dealing with the gambling aspect and not enough time with the love story aspect which was more interesting and the result is a film which end's up being barely mediocre.",1036886400,,399,4.714285714285714
7832784,5,6302980704,"Extremely engrossing, this tale of two men in love with the same woman is terrific. Well written and acted, there are moments of great tragedy, and also humor, supplied by Eduardo de Pea ""El Mimo"".
Amparo Muoz is lovely as the girl, and Jorge Rivero excellent as the other man. Vicente Fernndez is as always, a fascinating actor, and sings five songs that are a delight. Taking place around the late 19th Century, the locations are wonderful, with the architecture of the old houses a marvelous, aesthetic treat.
For those of us who are Alejandro Fernndez fans, here's another one for the collection ! He is seen very briefly here (so cute ! He eats a flower !!) at the age of about seven or eight, as the young Vicente in a dream sequence...what an incredibly beautiful child !
The ending is superb and one that Hollywood rarely (or never !) has the guts to do...it makes this film special and satisfying. Bravo Vicente !!",976147200,5,923,4.6
