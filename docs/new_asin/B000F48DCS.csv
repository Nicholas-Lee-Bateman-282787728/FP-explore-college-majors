2550843,4,B000F48DCS,"This is a fine 3-part documentary (3-hours long) on the Battle of Stalingrad. It is a German/Russian co-production made in 2003 to commemorate the 60th Anniversary of the battle that turned the tide of the war. It is a remarkable collaborative effort between the two former belligerents, with unprecedented access to their joint historical archives, both in terms of film footage and documentary records. The progress of the battle is told through the recollections of surviving veterans from both sides, as well as poignant letters home from those who perished. Alongside the better known footage from the German archives, there are rarer clips from the Russian vaults, of life in the city before, during and after the battle, and propaganda films of German POWs in Soviet concentration camps. From the NKVD (KGB/FSB) archives, we learn how, contrary to long accepted historical accounts, Field Marshall Paulus' surrender did not bring the battle to a close - over 10,000 German troops chose to fight on amidst the rubble, holding out against superior Soviet forces for another 2 months before finally being defeated. In all, over a quarter-million German soldiers (the mighty 6th Army) died at Stalingrad. The Russians suffered over half a million casualties.

The documentary is far from exhaustive. Only cursory mention is made of the Romanian, Hungarian, and Italian Armies (over half a million men) that took part in the assault and perished alongside the Germans. But on the whole, it is a balanced, moving and admirable account of a battle that has for too long, remained untold in the west. Its value lies not so much in the battle-footage unearthed but more in preserving the first-hand testimony of the last remaining survivors of this decisive moment in history.

My only criticism is of the irritating English dubbing of every spoken word in the documentary. This was originally shown in German and Russian with all the interviews conducted in those languages. It's fine to dub the main narration but dubbing over the veterans' and survivors' accounts was overkill and highly annoying. As the previous reviewer said, it was to appease the ""subtitle-averse"" crowd. Personally I thought the producer should have given his audience more credit. Many of the veterans interviewed were emotionally distraught as they recounted the trauma. Having American voice-actors trying to capture their distress with faked emotion made the whole exercise laughable. For me, the height of absurdity was when Hitler and Goebbels had their speeches dubbed over by some American voice-actor. Optional English subtitles should have been the way to go.

The documentary was shot in 1.78:1 widescreen and is presented as such on this DVD (Anamorphic). The recent footage, including the interviews, shots of the present-day city and the graphics used, all look excellent, with sharp images and strong, natural colours. The archive footage is understandably poorer in quality, unrestored and from the Russian side, significantly grainy. Sound is in Dolby 2.0. There are no subtitles. Extras include a 10-minute long interview with Prof. Guido Knopp who wrote and co-produced the documentary, 20 minutes worth of additional interviews with veterans (both in German with optional English subtitles) and a 5-minute modern-day tour of a pristine, snow-clad Volgograd (City on the Volga - the new name for Stalingrad).",1157932800,91,3400,5.280961182994455

2550845,2,B000F48DCS,"A solid documentary with interesting new footage and invaluable testimony from participants in the battle and related events is ruined by loud voice-overs by poor actors. Both the narration and the voice-overs of interviewees are mediocre at best. If you are averse to dubbing of fictional films, you will understand that overdubbing of non-fictional work is particularly onerous. Clearly a decision was made to create a version that would be accessible to those averse to reading subtitles. But in the age of DVD it is fairly absurd not to include the original version of the film.",1151798400,60,582,5.072916666666667
2550846,5,B000F48DCS,"I saw this about 3 years ago when it was playing in a very limited release in NY city, this documentary was unbelievable, extremely moving and the best documentary ever made on Stalingrad.  Told throughout by interviews with the people who were there (or sometimes the wife they left behind)it is so enlightening, even to someone like myself who has seen everything on the battle including even visiting Stalingrad(Volgograd) in 1998. I had been trying to find out how I could purchase this documentary in the three  years since I saw it , to no avail, to see it finally on Amazon is great,I am ordering it today.

Outstanding archival film research resulted in never before seen footage of Operation Blue & Stalingrad (especially life in the Kessel).  99% of the footage is genuine late 1942 vintage, and quite a bit in color.  This is a MUST-SEE on HDTV.  The doc also reveals a stunning secret regarding the Kessel, but I won't spoil it for you.  I have $3K in English, Russian & German Stalingrad books/video, and I would buy this one again if I had the choice.  You can't possibly regret this.",1149292800,46,556,4.565656565656566

2550849,4,B000F48DCS,"Heart-wrenching and maddening true stories of one of the most important battles of WW2.  The original footage and interviews with survivors on both sides really brought home the destruction of humanness and brutality of war.  Although both sides are represented, I was a bit annoyed that it seemed to be told from the German side about 75% of the time, and I'd be interested to see a Stalingrad docu from the Soviet side.  That said, I found it worthwhile that the low-level 20-year old German soldiers were humanized as ""not fascists, just humans"" (quote)  from the point of view of (I think?) a Soviet doctor in the POW camp.  Some of these Stalingrad POW's and German dead were low-level foot soldiers caught working for the wrong leader at the wrong time, and brainwashed since 1933 by Nazi propaganda. Of course, this is an excuse, but I have the feeling from watching this documentary that many 20-yr old German soldiers were just caught up, being forced into the draft or ""everyone has to go"" national pressure rather than a particular personal love for the hateful ideology of Hitler (although many higher ranking officers definitely DID share his disgusting manifesto).  In any case, these young soldiers either did not have the desire, moral ability, or way of escape that would have enabled them to flee Germany rather than fight for Hitler. (Their families might have been killed in retaliation if they said no, also...?)

The brutality inflicted by German generals and officers not just on the Soviet population, but on *their own starving German soldiers* came across many times in the film.  Ouch.  Betrayed with two enemies, the Reds and their own generals.

Definitely a worthwhile watch for historical education. (Heads up: As in any true war documentary, there are some nauseating descriptions of graphic atrocities and horrors of war, of course.  Just a disclaimer.)",1482019200,2,1886,4.993610223642173
2550850,5,B000F48DCS,Great documentary. Shows what it was like for a lot of men in the east. True hardship was endured.,1481241600,,98,4.2105263157894735
2550851,2,B000F48DCS,"I'm not usually one for writing reviews, but I feel the need to speak out on this one. I bought this one despite the various negative reviews, the majority of which focused on the English dubbing (which was indeed an unfortunate choice) because of the many reviews which raved about the documentary's historical accuracy, use of previously unreleased footage, and access to rare German and Soviet archives. Unfortunately, these reviews are misleading.

This is a German film, and is perhaps thus inevitably German-centric, really presenting only one side of the battle. Worse, the filmmakers go out of their way to portray the Soviet veterans they interviewed as callous, unfeeling killers, while presenting the Germans as young men unfortunately caught in hellish circumstances. The entire battle is largely presented as a discrete event, with no real attempt made to connect it with the previous year and more of brutal warfare and atrocity as the Germans invaded the USSR. The progress of the battle itself is told through a series of disconnected vignettes, with the usual landmarks (Tractor Factory, Red October Factory, Pavlov's House, etc) completely omitted. Oddly there is absolutely no mention of Chuikov, Rodimtsev, or the 64th and 62nd Armies desperate defense of the city before Operation Uranus. Now that I think of Uranus, the Soviet counterattack is never given it's proper name in the film.

Beyond turning Stalingrad into a German tragic drama, the filmmakers chose to keep the majority of the quotes red and even the people they interviewed anonymous. Interviews with a number (mostly German) of veterans and survivors are repeatedly inter-cut with archival footage, but except in rare cases, the speakers are never identified. The same is true of the excerpts from letters, diaries, etc. it is always ""a soldier's letter,"" ""a general writes,"" or ""a young girl's diary entry reads"" so the first person accounts turn into a series of disembodied, disconnected anecdotes, robbed of any real pathos or historical accountability.

Overall, the three-hour mini-series fails to even attempt to construct a coherent narrative of the Battle of Stalingrad and the operations surrounding it, creating a confused jumble of scenes that are rarely anchored in time, and never anchored in geography. Granted that Stalingrad was a complex battle, and is not easy to reconstruct or follow even with detailed maps and documented movements, but the film doesn't even try. Then again, as noted above, this is not so much a film about the battle as it is an apologia for the members of the Wehrmacht's 6th Army who are presented as sympathetic figures without even a modicum of countervailing examination of their roles as invaders and an integral part of the Nazi war machine and racial ideology.

This one goes to my local used bookstore for trade credit, perhaps to be used for a real history of this absolutely crucial battle.",1478822400,7,2929,5.147058823529412

2550854,5,B000F48DCS,"This is simply the best documentary about the battle of Stalingrad I have ever watched, and I have a huge collection of war videos. It's 3 hours long and the three episodes are titled ""The Assault"", ""The Cauldron"" and ""The End"". A multitude of German and Soviet veterans remember their experiences of Stalingrad, sometimes shedding tears for everything they lived through. The footage is excellent and dramatic, and does not contain scenes that are irrelevant with the battle of Stalingrad. Especially the last episode where German former soldiers describe the hunger, the cold and the misery they suffered while trapped in and around the city, was heart rending. The same applies with the haunting stories of the survivors from the brutal Soviet captivity. If you are looking for the absolutely best documentary for the battle of Stalingrad available today, you don't need to watch anything else.

2550867,4,B000F48DCS,"A good documentary, worth the money and worth viewing.  I agree with some other reviews, it is not all that well balanced.  To me, it leaned heavily on the Germans with not too much on the Russians.  Almost no mention of the German allies and their part in the battle.  Very sketchy introduction to the background of the German thrust towards the Volga.  Very little about POW's on both sides, except for those who surrendered at the end.  No mention of Stalin's mishandling of the initial battle, his insane policy of treating so very many of his own soldiers as traitors, and his execution of over 13,000 of his own troops.  Also, I was disappointed that there were no subtitles except in the deleted interviews - which by the way, were among the best.  Wonder why they were left out?

In general, I regard the first two segments, The Attack and The Kessel, at good but not great.  The final segment, The Doom was probably the best for it's portrayal of the fate of the captured Germans.  For those really interested in the battle, I recommend ""Stalingrad"" (the book) by Antony Beevor, available here on Amazon.",1430438400,3,1113,4.627551020408164

2550869,5,B000F48DCS,I have been looking for a book or film that would get close to how it felt to be a German soldier trapped in Stalingrad. This is it. The interviews with German survivors made me feel the pain they felt. The scenes at the train station as the remaining survivors returned to Germany and the hope and anguish on peoples faces brought the horror of war to me.,1416182400,,356,4.25
2550870,4,B000F48DCS,"This is an excellent documentary made by Germans telling the story of the pivot point of World War 2 in a broad perspective, although some personal stories are included.  CGI maps are interposed occasionally, and are of help for those not intimately aware of the vastness of the Stalingrad Front.  The story is told in a factual manner, without propaganda or apology.  There are three segments of this ""miniseries"", each one on its own DVD disc. The introduction (disc 1) gives a brief review of operation Barbarosa's southern front; fortunately it does not attempt to explain the vast Russian Invasion in detail, which has been excellently documented in other sources (such as the BBC).  The second disc is devoted to Der Kessel"", which means cauldron.  This is done very well, emphasizing how a huge German Army Group (240,000 soldiers) were bottled up in Stalingrad and its surrounding suburbs and rural areas.  The third disc, about the Sixth Army's ultimate collapse is not done quite so well.  General Paulus has been painted in most movies and many books as a bumbler and a coward.  Yet, this general fought an impossible mission the maniacal Hitler insisted upon.  True, the Sixth Army was large but it was thousands of miles from the Fatherland, bereft of supplies, fighting in an evermore desperate situation.  That they held out so long, ultimately is due to top grade leadership ar the Front--not from the Wolf's Lair in East Prussia.  The take home message of this miniseries is that Hitler cold-bloodedly sacrificed this Army and of course the spirits of the people back home who loved them.",1413763200,3,1605,4.929368029739777

2550872,5,B000F48DCS,"This documentary covers all 3 phases of this terrible & epic situation. It's a clear, objective and well-narrated documentary. Interviews with actual survivors, civilians  and combatants from both sides helped me begin to understand the depth of the suffering faced by anyone who was involved (except for a few armchair generals who continued to live the good life throughout the whole episode). The explanation of Zhukov's brilliant encirclement strategy is well presented. The coverage of Paulus is also fair - a career general, short of front line experience, completely unable to influence Hitler's strategy. The conclusions at the end of the documentary are still incomprehensible - over 1 million lives claimed in the Battle of Stalingrad. The fate of over 100,000 German prisoners (6,000 of whom survived Soviet captivity) is also covered in some depth. This admirable documentary left me feeling shocked and saddened, but also inspired by the courage, tenacity and survival instincts of people on both sides of the conflict.",1388188800,,1032,5.37037037037037

2550876,5,B000F48DCS,"I am quite knowledgeable about the Battle of Stalingrad and the Great Patriotic War in general, so when I came across this documentary, which was a fairly recent, modern production with both German and Russian participation, I was naturally very excited. I have even travelled to Volgograd and toured many of the important landmarks from the battle, so I have spent a bit of time reading the books and watching many of the films made about the battle. I have also read many of the negative reviews written here about this documentary and I have to say that these people must have a real problem keeping things in relative perspective. The lack of subtitles is annoying. The single male voice over artist reading for all of the male witnesses - both Soviet and German - as well as the documentary's story narration is not ideal, but come on...  There is no better collection of witnesses, soldiers from both countries, who were there present during this epic battle, anywhere else gathered together in one work. And as far as historical significance goes there is nothing more important than eyewitness and participant testimony. This is an amazing treasure to have here preserved these testimonies. Hugely important. Nothing is as rich as these human tales told by the people themselves. No book, no slick Hollywood feature, nothing outweighs the value of these stories told by those who were there. And by the way, the translation of these testimonies and the read and inflection given by the narrator is very accurate. Would I have liked a few more male VO artists? Sure, I would. Additional female VO artists too?  Ditto. Would I like the option of subtitles. Absolutely. But as an amateur historian who takes it seriously, all of these complaints pale in comparison to monumental importance and absolute gold that the producers of this documentary have given us - the real people. The story is well crafted and woven with the testimonies. There is good use of archival footage, some of which I have not seen before. And the overall production quality, i.e., the photography, the graphics, etc., are also well done. A very important piece that anyone who is serious about the subject should own. I just want to say ""Thank You"" to the producers, and everyone else - crew and witnesses - who participated to bring these stories to the world.",1358726400,21,2342,4.8525

I then bought it on VHS, finding to my horror, that it had been dubbed! Do not watch a dubbed version of this film! It is available cheaply on DVD, and it must be remembered that this was well before the days of 'Saving Private Ryan', or 'Blackhawk Down'. Possibly the finest portrayal of close combat and street fighting ever committed to film, this German production pulls no punches, and asks for no sympathy for the German aggressors. Films such as 'Enemy at the Gates' simply do not compare. It is a must buy for any collector of war films, or anyone interested in the brutal campaign to take Stalingrad.

2550882,3,B000F48DCS,"The overall view presented was well documented by archival footage from both sides, as well as eyewitness accounts of what happened.  My major complaint is with the narration.  First off, the narrator mispronounces several words such as the name of the Soviet General Zhukov.  The narrator pronounces it Chuikov, who was the defender of Stalingrad, not the general in charge of Operation Uranus.  Also, during the beginning of Part II ""The Kessel,"" the narrator states that ""On November the 19th, World War Two took a turn for the worse.""  This is only true if you were German.  For the Allies, this was the turning point of the war.  Which raises the question: Was the narrator biased or was the narrative written for him slanted to put a more positive spin on the German invasion of the Soviet Union?  Perhaps the European Union would like to paint itself in a more favorable light, even if it means leaving out a lot of information.

This documentary is too long for one battle.  I don't particularly like documentaries that try to paint a sympathetic portrait of armies, militarism or war.  Too often these films, instead of being anti-war, end up glorifying war instead.  All my sympathy goes to the civilians caught in the crossfire.  My sympathy also goes to the country invaded, and against those who start the war.  What was missing from this documentary were the Einsatzgruppen, Babi Yar, and the ultimate goal of exterminating Slavs, Gypsies, Jews, and the forced labor of the Soviet people.  In the name of Lebensraum and hatred for ""Jewish Bolshevism"" they attacked Russia, and rose colored lenses are not going to be able to distort that fact.

Adolf Hitler and the cult of personality worship that created the Third Reich, was adamant in its belief that they were superior to other races.  Hitler wanted Germany's youth to have the eye of a bird of prey, and the heart of Krupp Steel.  So when these supermen invaded the Soviet Union, they thought they were invincible against the sub-human Slavs.  It's too bad that it took Stalingrad to change their minds (some never did).

There have been other documentaries about Stalingrad and Barbarossa that have excellent footage such as ""The Battle of Russia"" produced by the U.S. Army as part of its ""Why We Fight"" series during WWII.  It has a propaganda style suited to persuading Americans of our cause during the war, but also explains the Soviet strategy of defense in depth.  Also ""The Unknown War"" has some excellent footage as well.  All of these films however leave out the fact that Stalin purged his upper military leadership prior to the invasion, and failed to act on intelligence received from Switzerland of the impending attack.",1261353600,2,2704,4.85589519650655

The forced surrender of an entire German army for the first time in history set the stage for Nazi Germany's ultimate defeat. While rather vague on some details which are well documented, the interviews of German and Soviet survivors of the battle are touching and bring the tragedy of this bloody battle as close to us as we will ever get.

The use of archival film throughout the documentary was very good but it seemed to reuse some of it. The employment of stills (of which there are thousands upon thousands) might have made it a bit better.

Certainly better than the five minute discussion normally reserved for Stalingrad in other documentaries of the war.",1195862400,2,750,4.7615384615384615

2550886,4,B000F48DCS,"I recommend this film, but I think it could have been better.  We need maps-- Where are the landmarks--  Red Barricades.  Crossing 62.  The Tractor Factory.  The Brickworks.  The only landmark we hear of in all three hours, other than the airstrips, is ""the basement of a department store.""  Surely the script allowed for mention of the well-known landmarks.  Viewers who have read a book on Stalingrad will feel lost.

The narrator tells us that the airstrips are overrun-- then later we hear of Ju-52s landing at Pitomnik and Gumrak--  So after Kalach, there are other airstrips-- where are the maps that show what's going on?

And how many times do we need to hear that the airstrips were chaotic?  Seems like we heard that about every five minutes throughout the last two episodes.

Was the story about the four officers in white fur coats believable?-- Forcing the pilot at gunpoint to leave the 17 wounded on the ground and take off with only the four officers?  What goes through a pilot's mind at that point-- how about:  ""If they shoot me, how are they then going to get away?""  Must we hear about this one flight, and not the thousands of others?  I'm sure there were better examples than that, to make whatever point the directors were trying to make-- which seems to be that the Wehrmacht officer corps were all cowards.

2550887,4,B000F48DCS,"Very powerful and accurate.  This video really brings the horror or this bloody battle into perspective.  The historical footage, interviews, and battle analysis are superb.  The extras are worth the cost in themselves.  The only complaint is the voice over work is a bit  lack luster.  I recommend to any WWII buff or history nut.",1179014400,2,331,4.927272727272728

8117108,5,B000F48DCS,"Year's ago, I got 'into' the siege of Stalingrad.  I read some good books on, read about the whole situation + and all the numbers and statistics.
But NOTHING hits you like this documentary!  Excellent film footage, voiceover, and so forth, but  what strikes hard and deep are those participants who there and experienced it firsthand.
You re left with fact that hell is here on earth, and those who were there, experienced it, and it has never left.
Very powerful indeed",1496448000,3,471,4.719512195121951

8117111,3,B000F48DCS,"The battle of Stalingrad lasted from early September into the following January.  This American style documentary concerned itself soley with the last 6 weeks of the battle.  A huge mistake for a documentary.  Despite the interviews with a few of the German survivors, the documentary was very biased for the Soviets.  The British documentaries are much more fair and objective.  What a shame that the producers of this film ruined it.  When you look for documentaries of WWII, always look for a British production.  The American ones are much too biased.",1487462400,2,555,5.032967032967033
8117112,5,B000F48DCS,Finally somebody that interviewed and recorded German veterans that lived it. New facts found from Soviet archives. I liked every minute of it. Too bad that original german not available. It is well made and highly credible.,1485302400,,224,5.081081081081081
