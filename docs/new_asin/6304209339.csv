7865770,5,6304209339,"Charles Schultz,at least to me is an American pop culture icon. I doubt I will get any arguement on this-his Peanuts comic strips and classic TV specials have delighted and entertained millions of literally every age and walk of life for generations. Why?Because the themes are universal-each character has a little bit of the human race in every one-Lucy's snottiness,Peppermint Pattie's over assertiveness,Marcie's awkwardness,Linus's insecurity,Sally's immaturity and Snoopy's lovable liveliness and of course Charlie Brown-basically an animated version of Schultz himself-a little wishy washy but with alot of courage and a willingness to keep trying despite knowing he'll probably lose. Well in 'Sparky's case he won out big time,namely by imparting to young people they should never fear being a failiar by using Charlie Brown as the ever present example. And yeah-as this special shows through musical tributes,discussions and even some rare clips from the Peanuts inspired off Broadway production no:Charlie Brown will probably always have his kite eaten and will doubtful ever win a baseball game. But will keep flying his kite,he will keep trying to steal home and the little red haired girl DID kiss him-once. And that is the most important lesson and as I've discoverd not always as easy in application as it could be-don't always expect to succeed at everything but NEVER stop trying. And this tribute does honor to Schultz and my personal favorite Peanuts character-round headed Charlie Brown.",1116374400,2,1507,5.417021276595745
