6414115,5,B00KBZZIS8,Good entertaining movie even though it offers a bleak outlook on a global disaster,1409702400,,82,4.928571428571429
6414116,4,B00KBZZIS8,"The film centers on Hunter (C.J. Thomason ) a young doctor who knows something about what to do when the big ones start falling. He meets and woman and a young boy along the road. They steal a vehicle, loot a store and seek shelter in rural Oklahoma/Texas, a place that has far more many guns than basements. They eventually find refuge in a basement to the dismay of Brad (Edward Furlong) who supplies us with internal conflict until the wanting, looting neighbors show up.

The film is more realistic than most. Who fired the nukes at us is not known. The war started when Pakistan launched nukes against Israel and India. They don't have many warheads and certainly don't have the capability to reach the US so they had to come from either the Soviets or China, most likely the Soviets, but there is no reason given or why NORAD failed to protect and warn us.

A makeshift fallout shelter is great, but unless you have a filtered air system, you only have half the problem licked. The dose rate meter shown typically doesn't click. That appears to have been added for effect. The rate of 4 Rem/hr will give radiation sickness to most people after a day or two of exposure and kill half the people exposed after 4-5 days. We didn't get any idea how long they were exposed to that level. Radiation sickness first effects the digestive system. You lose it all. It also makes people lethargic as you feel sick. The very idea that infected people are out marauding around is something to spur slumping gun sales, but not a likely scenario. Most likely it would be uninfected people out to scrounge food, of which only sealed goods are safe after you wipe off any exterior fallout, but that makes a boring film, like that Viggo Mortensen thing everyone seemed to love.

6414117,3,B00KBZZIS8,"Good movie, but very hopeless scenario along the lines of ""The Road"".  Will make you think about the devastation of nuclear war and how it would affect society.  Probably some good learning points as to what to do if that should ever happen.",1409270400,6,241,4.5813953488372094
6414118,3,B00KBZZIS8,"Yup. That's what happens when Nukes go off all over the world... Problem is, assured mutual destruction? Could happen... This was more of a documentary than a horror movie. It shouldn't have been in the Amazon horror genre section. It's an OK film, but it wasn't very interesting given that just about everything I assume is general public knowledge about radiation poisoning.",1409097600,,376,5.080645161290323
6414119,3,B00KBZZIS8,This movie is O.K. but The Day After with Jason Robards from 1983 was a much better film.,1409011200,3,89,4.0
6414120,4,B00KBZZIS8,"When I was a kid, potential nuclear war with Russia was a constant threat.  It seemed to loom over everything:  news, pop culture, even our day-to-day lives.  As a result, I grew up with a healthy respect for nuclear weapons and what they could do.  This is probably why I enjoy post-apocalyptic films and stories so much; there are so many things that could happen in a radioactive world.  AFTERMATH, an upcoming PA release from RLJ Entertainment, is a solid entry into the PA category, and it is definitely a must-see if you're a fan of the genre.

I was infatuated with this film from the opening credits.  While they roll, a series of bleak images slowly plays across the screen.  These shots set a nice, dark tone for the film, but they are also very artistic in nature.  After they concluded, I restarted the movie so I could watch them again.  Talk about setting the mood!

AFTERMATH has some excellent cinematography and the production value appears high.  The film looks great onscreen, especially in HD, however the surround-sound didn't work on my Blu-ray copy for some reason.  All I got was sound through my front speakers.  Not sure if this is something to do with my system or the disc.

The acting in the film is great as well, with C.J. Thomason heading up a fantastic cast.  Thomason is a new actor to me, although I own a couple of films he is in (HUSK and SUTURES, however I have watched neither one).  He is definitely an actor to look out for in the future.  I also enjoy seeing Edward Furlong onscreen; Ive been a fan of his work since TERMINATOR 2, way back in 1991.  He does a very convincing job in this film with his role.

My sole complaint about AFTERMATH is that Thomasons character is never fully developed, and we are left wondering why and how he knew everything he did.  For example, when they raid a convenience store, he tells his companion what to look for (food with protein, no junk food, etc.).  Also, he knew how to hotwire an Army vehicle and how to use car batteries for power in the cellar.  This sounds like doomsday prepper knowledge, but it is never mentioned in the film.

But that is my only negative about this film.  AFTERMATH is a hell of a film, chocked full of intensity and realism.  I highly recommend checking this one out.  It might just change the way you look at World War 3.",1408492800,,2335,4.458628841607565
6414121,3,B00KBZZIS8,"Not a five or four-star production for sure.
Gave it three-stars as it was a way to pass some time a on hot day, but not a one or two-star disaster.",1405728000,,148,3.806451612903226
6414122,4,B00KBZZIS8,"I saw this at the movie theatres.  The movie takes place right after a nuclear war.  We do see the mushroom clouds erupt.  A young doctor and other survivors try to find shelter and we see them go through the next month.  IT's a grim story of course. But the acting Is fine and most of the movie takes place at one house.  So there are no military people running around with gas masks.  The budget on this one is very small, but it's a small drama story. As the story progresses we see them deteriorate and in reality , this would probably be what most people would experience. With few interactions from others. But this story has dying people showing up often and attacking them. This might happen of course.  but probably not so many!  It does make the story move faster as they have to fight off all of the radiated people.  I would assume that most people would not go out attacking though. in such a helpless situation.  But then it would have been a much slower movie. Critics will point this out probably that this went for a more violent story for the horror aspect. .  I liked this movie ,.  Many cities won't have this playing, this was at a cinema in Denver, Only in this state. . So you may have to wait for the blu ray..",1405641600,7,1234,4.24892703862661

6414125,5,B00KBZZIS8,"This was surprisingly good!  I am generally skeptical when it comes to these lower-budget efforts, but found this to be totally engrossing.  Tight script, realistic situations and dialogue and, most surprisingly, good acting. C.J. Thomason (who I had never heard of) deserves a boost up, he could be a major star--handsome, believable and a fine actor, as are most of the others in the cast.  Definitely an edge of your seat thriller--and also quite sad.  I imagine that if this situation ever comes to pass (and with Trump a possibility as POTUS, it could be sooner rather than later) I imagine this is pretty much exactly what it would be like.  Well-done indeed!",1465344000,2,665,4.849557522123894

6414127,3,B00KBZZIS8,"Excellent movie as far as acting and plot but so frightening because it's an entirely plausible scenario if a certain individual (ok, I'll say it: TRUMP) becomes our president.

A man who when caught with his pants down, just pulls them up and starts lying about it. We should all be very afraid of this man as he will be the death of us.",1459296000,2,464,4.1098901098901095

They all go to the houses cellar with all the things needed to survive, so they think.
Thus setting the premise of one of the better post nuclear movies to come out in some time because it is realistic in it's approach in how people deal with disaster and the drive to survive, not to mention the effects of radioactivity from the nuclear bombs rendering food and water useless because of contamination.

6414151,4,B00KBZZIS8,"This is a movie that follows the lives of a number of strangers who find themselves in a Texas basement immediately following multiple nuclear strikes on the area around them. I thought the acting was fine. I also found their experiences to be quite believable.

At the small risk of MILDLY SPOILING how things go, take my comment about this being believable, and your own knowledge about what happens in the aftermath of a nuclear strike. Exactly. The movie is pretty dark and I don't think it ruins anything for me to say these survivors are not spirited away to a radiation-free mountain retreat in the final moments of the movie.

I have to give this movie 4 because it really is true to its title. I have to ding it a mark because, despite loving this genre, I'm hard-pressed to say I'm glad I saw the movie because frankly nothing good happens. Its realism is also its flaw.",1425427200,2,880,4.528301886792453

6414164,5,B00KBZZIS8,"I didn't sleep last night after watching this film. This movie is not full of special effects, or adventurous survivors. It's about what would happen if you were in the middle of a nuclear attack, but far enough away from the blast zone to survive the explosion. It's about slowly dying of radioactive fallout, and trying to keep it together when you're confined to a small space with strangers for weeks, not knowing if you will be rescued, or what's going on outside. It seemed too real to not worry about all the stuff that is going on these days, like people cutting off peoples heads because they want to scare people into submission. And governments letting the barbarians slip away so that the horror continues and scares the populations into trusting the government. It's complete insanity. If it results in a nuclear holocaust, the politicians are to blame. Instead of taking bribes, they should be using their legislative powers to make life better for everyone, by creating a better system that allows people who work to buy a home, and build up a retirement pension. A system that does not reward greed and waste. The present economical system is not sustainable, and the narrow minded people of the world that want you to be afraid of change, are not helping. What will it take for people to see where things are going? The current system is taking us down a dead end road. The attack on the be-headers that is now being planned, will no doubt result in more innocents being accidentally killed, and that will fuel more anti-west hatred. Can our nation find a way to stay out of nations where the populace likes being intellectually stagnant? We can't help some people, because they don't want us too.

6414167,5,B00KBZZIS8,"When I was in seventh grade, 1987, an actual representative from out nation's military came into our school and explained (against our sometimes strident objections) that the most rationalnay, the ONLY rationalstrategy to avoid a nuclear war was to keep amassing stockpiles of expensive ballistic thermonuclear weaponry that could wipe out the whole human race multiple times over. And then 1989 came and our nation's punditry gave us to believe that we could all of a sudden just forget any anxiety that a nuclear war was ever going to happen in our lifetimes and maybe our children's to boot.
So am I scared now? More than the general punditry would have me be, yes. Less than the Fox News punditry would have me be. But if nothing else, this movie is a great example of what our modern film-making techniques can accomplish in the vein of such classics as Threads, the British nightmare-after film. This offering gives us a very charismatic young MD in Texas who brings a group of survivors to shelter, helps them survive the many threats to their survival, fosters a civilized and sustainable culture based on mutual respect and love, and thus leads them on toward...what? Certainly the end of this movie presents no promised land. Our hero and one other survivor stumble out of their shelter, balding and bleeding from spontaneously erupted skin lesions.
Yes, I am scared. But I do think that the best way to prevent this is to keep electing men like our current president, and the way to invite it is to keep on blindly chanting ""worst president ever! worst president ever!""",1411344000,2,1580,4.833948339483395

They end up in an unprepared basement to wait out the fallout.  They face radiation sickness, intruders and medical emergencies. Eventually there is a battle with intruders.

The special effects budget obviously went into simulating nuclear explosions in the distance because most of the movie was set in the basement, which really doesn't require much in the way of special effects.  The dialogue was sparse, but the acting was credible.  I actually became involved with characters - apart from Edward Furlong's ""Brad,"" who was a bit of a loud-mouthed jerk - particularly the young doctor.

This is actually a well-done movie, particularly for being low budget.  One thing nice about the movie is that it does not stink, like so many other similar movies (which thereby earns it an extra star.)  It is depressing, but - hey! - nuclear war is no bed of roses.

On the other hand, I sort of found myself taking notes.  Hmm....kerosene as the liquid for a portable toilet because it is lighter than water and waste...who knew?  And I wonder if I should get a geiger counter because it seems that you would be screwed if you don't have one and you need one.

I am not sure who this movie is for.  It is not an adventure flick.  It is not humorous at all.  It is not inspiring.  It is barely an action flick. I thought it was good, but, for the life of me, I don't know who I would be recommending it to.",1410652800,28,1529,4.4855072463768115
