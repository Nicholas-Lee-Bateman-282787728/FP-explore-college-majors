8686039,4,B00P11J7JI,"I'll watch anything with Robert Donat in it, one of my all-time favorite actors.  This one, though, will have a limited audience due to its subject matter.  Pitt the Younger was himself not all that interesting.  The movie does include a tepid romance, which may or may not have been based on real life, but other than that, it is mainly a history lesson with very good performances.  It will appeal to those who, like me, adore Robert Donat, and those who are interested in the political developments of the times.",1451347200,3,515,4.626373626373627

8686041,5,B00P11J7JI,This was supposedly Winston Churchill's favourite movie. I wouldn't go that far but it is an interesting look into BRITISH history with obvious references to WW2 then raging. Robert Donat gives his usual stalwart performance and it is interesting to see the young John Mills. Overall very enjoyable if you like erudite historical movies.,1426291200,8,337,5.2592592592592595
