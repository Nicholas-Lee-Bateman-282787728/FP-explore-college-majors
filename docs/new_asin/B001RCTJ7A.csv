Do not waste your money, it would be better spent on maxi pads.",1448236800,,211,3.8181818181818183
8337701,5,B001RCTJ7A,"Ali Spagnola fought for your right to party! Sure, you could listen to her songs in MP3 format, but the people Need Something For Watching!",1359504000,,139,4.6
8337702,5,B001RCTJ7A,"If there is a finer piece of work every written in the history of music, I have yet to see it! Once again Ali Spagnola has published an anthology just as sure to raise the bar for her peers in the music industry as it is to delight her legions of fans. Though she utilizes only 60 second songs in her album, time and time again Spagnola has proven that in no way does this format limit her genius of music delivery. She consistantly produces tunes of a dazzling scope and depth, which hide layers upon layers of enjoyment that seem to demand multiple listenings. Although enourmously complex and even at times displaying a dark sense of humor, Spagnola nevertheless is able to keep even the youngest of fans amused through her delightful music and the uplifting shots her power hour provides. Sad to say, but since the death of Bob Hope, Ali Spagnola has been left without a true peer in the world of entertainment. No, truly each period of human exsistence has produced a select few people whom society can look up to. Just as the Roman Historian Sallust could proudly say he lived in the Republic of Caesar and Cato, and past generations could say they lived in the days of Washington and Jefferson, so can we say we knew the time of Spagnola, and thus are we more fortunate than all others who came before.",1359331200,,1309,4.481171548117155

8337704,5,B001RCTJ7A,"This Power Hour drinking game is drenched in awesome awesome-sauce. A great way to start a party.  A celebration of alcohol and the people who drink it. Only improvement would be a short rendition of the Doobie Brothers classic ""Black Water"".",1359331200,,242,4.902439024390244
8337705,5,B001RCTJ7A,"This is a fun drinking game to unwind to, by responsible and inebriated adults. Also buy her USB Shotglass for a more current one. <>",1359331200,,133,4.36
8337706,5,B001RCTJ7A,"I think my liver prefers Blackwater. <>

But seriously, Ali's timing is so precise on this album, I don't know how she did it? Every song had just the right pacing.  Like a metronome for the soul.",1359331200,,196,4.27027027027027
8337707,5,B001RCTJ7A,"Ali's Power Hour drinking game is the only one you'll ever need. Often imitated, never duplicated. Available nowhere but Cuba. Worth more than diamonds.",1359331200,8,152,5.375
8337708,5,B001RCTJ7A,"Ali's power hour is an awesome compilation of 60 original songs about drinking -- definitely one of the best video power hours I've ever done!  This is much better than the other ""power hour"" videos that people are trying to hawk on Amazon, which are essentially countdown clocks with crappy powerpoint presentation style graphics.

If you're going to do a power hour, go with Ali's!",1273363200,6,383,4.876923076923077
