8162889,5,B000LP5FW2,Like the anime one of my favorites. Before I only had the first two DvDs so I found never watch it  and the online version the sound was always off form the pitcher.,1375574400,,165,4.0
8162890,4,B000LP5FW2,"The Dark Tournament is STILL going on (how many months has it been?), and Team Urameshi is facing both the semifinals AND the finals. While ""Yu Yu Hakusho - Team of Four"" spends most of its time focusing on the gang's increasingly brutal fight scenes, the real focus is on the culmination of Yusuke's martial arts training -- and there's a shocking twist near the end that, while a bit predictable, is pretty wrenching.

Team Urameshi is presented with two surprises -- the masked fighter reveals his/her true identity, and Yusuke's Spirit Beast hatches at last. But the gang doesn't have long to make fun of Yusuke's magic animal, because they have the semifinals to fight out

Then Genkai pulls Yusuke out of the tournament for his final test as her apprentice, which might actually give him enough power to defeat Toguro. In the meantime, the rest of his friend has to fight team Uraotogi -- Hiei is forced to fight the transforming Kuromomotaro, Kuwabara gets thrown through a dimension-warping cape, and a magic smoke has a shocking effect on Kurama's body.

However, the real challenge is in the forthcoming finals against (obviously) Team Toguro. While Yusuke, Kurama, Hiei and Kuwabara all enhance their strength in preparation, Toguro makes a deadly strike against one member of their team -- leaving the group devastated and grimly determined to win. Unfortunately, Kurama's fight against the sadistic Karasu doesn't go so well...

The Dark Tournament is the longest arc in the entire ""Yu Yu Hakusho"" series, and it's seriously beginning to feel like the longest arc in anime history (excluding the current ""Bleach"" one). But it's definitely getting more exciting now that Yusuke and Co. are in the big leagues -- and to keep the whole fight-after-fight-after-fight thing from getting boring, there are actually some plot twists thrown into the mix.

Not that the fights aren't interesting, which they are -- we've got magic bombs, shapeshifting, dimension-warps, screeching swords and magic smoke that de-ages you. And despite the grimness of the whole situation, there's some hilariously humorous moments (everyone's response to Yusuke's head-penguin). But the most powerful part of the story involves the loss of a major character, and the long-running feud between Toguro and Genkai.

Kurama and Yusuke get the most attention in this chunk of the arc -- our punky anti-hero undergoes some torturous training that might actually kill him, and is forced to stand on his own for the first time. And Kurama is given an opportunity to get back some of his old power... which he desperately needs, because otherwise that creepy perverted sadist is going to have WAY too much fun killing him.

It gets pretty dark in the last laps of the Dark Tournament, and ""Yu Yu Hakusho - Team of Four"" leaves you wanting to see the tournament's end.",1272672000,,2844,5.0

8162892,5,B000LP5FW2,"As a fan of Japanime for decades, and one that is seriously infected...ehr, uhm...I mean...addicted...*COUGH*...hooked...yeah that's it...hooked on a number of the older stories, the Yu Yu Hakusho series is among my top 10 must have list.

Although the Inuyasha series (both Anime, and Manga) is my number one, all time favorite series, Yu Yu Hakusho is by far the one that follows as a close second.  It you like Inuyasha, then you just have to checkout Yu Yu Hakusho.  It is not just a matter of plots, but a storyline that is well thought out for the most part.  There is always something unexpected around the corner, and just when you think you know what is going to happen next, a curve ball is thrown right at the works, and the story diverts into another direction.

It is not a story that just focuses on the main character, and does not provide much thought or development to the supporting caste.  Although it primarily follows the adventures and experiences of Yusuke Urameshi, it also proves great believable backgrounds for friend and foe alike, giving a depth to the story that makes this series one that even a more mature audience can appreciate.

Like any series, there are highlights and low, and somethings that are a definite asset to the story, while others are obviously just added for filler.  It does not, however, detract from the overall story, and character development.

If you like Japanime, and love following a good fantasy story, then this series is a definite must see.",1203120000,,1503,4.772200772200772
8162893,5,B000LP5FW2,"Yu Yu Hakusho may not be the most popular anime above dragonball z, naruto, evangelion, etc.  But it does have everything they all have and more.  To be honest the english dubs for all the other animes just sound like the voice actors are reading instead of putting true emotions into their voices to make it sound real.  That's the what yu yu hakusho has over almost all the animes I have ever seen.  The voice overs are outstanding and I think that's one thing that everyone should know separates a good english dubbed anime to a bad one.",1189814400,,540,4.424242424242424
8162894,5,B000LP5FW2,"In Yu Yu Hakusho: Team of Four you will get 14 terrific episodes of the show on 2 discs. Specifically, these are episodes 43 to 56 of the show and they all deal with the Dark Tournament. If you haven't yet seen the earlier episodes of this show, get them first or you will never understand the following review:

Team Urameshi has made it to the semifinals of the Dark Tournament. Now the Masked Fighter reveals her true identity of Genkai to Yusuke in the hope that he can pass her final test - absorb the extremely powerful Spirit Wave Orb! Yusuke suffers in agony as Genkai watches and hopes he can endure.

At the tournament, Team Urameshi, without Genkai or Yusuke, must face the mysterious Uraotogi Team in the semifinals. The first disc covers this entire round. As you watch the fights, team Uraotogi becomes more and more interesting. In the matches, almost each member uses a mystical item created by Onji, an elderly man on the team. When Shishiwakomaru, the team's supposed leader is defeated, only Onji remains. But what secret is the insidious old man hiding?

In disc 2, it is Team Toguro's turn to show what it can do. Elsewhere, Genkai meets an old friend turned enemy to settle a 50 year old score. Yusuke has successfully passed her test, but she leaves him with one more even harder test - overcoming her death.

As the final round of the Dark Tournament begins, each team is short one member. Who will fill in the rosters? The last two episodes on the disc are the first round of the finals - Kurama versus Karasu. Will Suzuka's help be enough to give Kurama a win for his team?

Overall 14 great episodes of Yu Yu Hakusho. You can watch in English or Japanese and the extras are lacking, but the episodes are very good. The first disc is action packed, while the second focuses more on emotion. As the Dark Tournament's final round begins, it really is the beginning of the end.",1178582400,,1900,4.511627906976744
