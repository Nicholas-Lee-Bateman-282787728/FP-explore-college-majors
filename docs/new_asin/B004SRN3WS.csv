8440169,2,B004SRN3WS,"There was very little information from the vet on this video. More time was spent showing a particular pet owner's bird with the owner just talking about how they love their bird. If you want really good training info, don't buy this video.",1494374400,,240,4.604651162790698

8440171,1,B004SRN3WS,"I just received this DVD on 5/17/11.  I watch the DVD and played the audio CD that's included.  I personally think both is a waste of money.  It doesn't teach your parrot to talk at all.  The stuff that's explained on the DVD and audio CD is not helpful.  You can go on youtube and get some audio recording of parrot talking.  Also some of the audio is from youtube.  As far as the DVD, you can get the same advice just by searching the internet.

I was so excited about receiving this DVD.  I figured that it was gonna teach me ways to train my Amazon to talk.  I had done research online before receiving this DVD and found the exact same information for free online.

I am so disappointed at Barbara Heidenreich for putting together this DVD. Like I said, you can get the same info online for free.  Nothing special or unique about this DVD and audio CD.",1305590400,16,857,4.254658385093168
