8156444,5,B000KGGOKO,This is a wonderful video to watch prior to going so you get some great tips.  When you get back from your trip and you watch it you recognize so much that you enjoy it just as much post-trip.,1329523200,,192,3.923076923076923
8156445,5,B000KGGOKO,This was the first episode I ever saw of Samantha Brown's Passport series. Love it! Even if you aren't that interested in a city you'll love Brown's lighthearted and fun approach to traveling. She gives tips on what you must see and some of the less touristy things to do. She loves food as well so you'll get a good taste of what each destination has to offer. The Prague episode is available on her Seven Fabulous Cities dvd. Check out all her shows - they really are alot of fun and much more entertaining than Rudy Maxa or Rick Steves.,1302652800,,539,4.346534653465347
