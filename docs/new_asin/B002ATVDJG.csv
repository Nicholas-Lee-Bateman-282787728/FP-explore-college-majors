If you take too much acid (or smoke too much weed) at one time the symptom is paranoia, which is why I avoided acid in the first place.  However, I got dosed, and in 1969 hippies in Syracuse were met with disapprobation to say the least.

I wanted to avoid the hairy eyeballs I was getting from civilians and cops alike, so I ducked into the movies.  Wouldn't you know, this movie was non-stop hassle.  But it was hilarious.  I'd say it's one of the four on five funniest movies of all time.

One last note:  I'd seen a blurb that said Fireman's Ball was funny, so I was primed for a comedy.  I got into the theater a few minutes late, bought a box of Milk Duds and settled in for 90 minutes of hilarity and refuge from hostility.  On the screen there were scenes of tanks crushing streetcars, guys flinging Molotov Cocktails and general mayhem.  Since this was a comedy I laughed out loud until the screen flashed ""YOU HAVE JUST SEEN FILMS OF THE SOVIET INVASION OF PRAGUE"".  Then the house lights came up and everybody - even including some kids - were looking dirty daggers at me.  So much for tranquility.",1501718400,,1205,4.373873873873874
