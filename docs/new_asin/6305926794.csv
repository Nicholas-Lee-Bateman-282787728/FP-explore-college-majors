1099739,5,6305926794,"Having been fans of both heavier classical music and heavy metal for over two decades, it was positively astounding for us to see those two worlds merge into one in this great video.  We have always been partial to The  Call of Ktulu, Master of Puppets and For Whom the Bell Tolls, but watching  them performed here shed an entirely new light on the musical structure,  for the first time bringing to light what those songs actually contain.  And the new song, No Leaf Clover - well, you will just have to experience  it for yourself. Lastly it must be said that Metallica, in our view, have  never in their entire career performed as they do here. They have always  been good, on quite a few occasions terriffic - but this, ladies and  gentlemen, this has simply to be seen to be believed. A word of advice:  please view this on a powerful surround system and a big, quality monitor.  To reap the full benefits of this performance, we believe it to be  absolutely essential.",947462400,15,975,4.508571428571429
1099740,3,6305926794,"The second I saw This video at the music store I bought it.  Then much to my suprise as I was at the mall the next week I saw the same S&M video with a bonus video attached of behind the scenes footage.  So if you buy  this video you will only get the concert tape, don't make the same mistake  I did.  Anyway the performance on the video is excellent.  Metallica is in  top form, as opposed to their usually sloppy live performance.",946166400,7,433,4.083333333333333
1099741,5,6305926794,"Symphony and Metallica together?  well it's no joke!  This is one of the greates combinations that i've ever heard/seen. This is a majestic show, living behind the pyro that Metallica uses, in a theater, with an orchestra  in the back. The sound is great, the ilumination is awsome, It's a show  where Metallica plays at their finnest. This is why they are considered the  kings of metal. They were greately tunned, timed, and playing the right  cords and riffs at the right moment. It's a must see show. Never have i  seen something like that, I have seen them twice already, and this show  makes the difference. The video is better than the CD, can't wait for the  DVD.",945907200,3,671,4.571428571428571
1099742,5,6305926794,"This is the best concert I have ever seen. I have seen metallica live and it blew me away, but this is just the ultimate. Who would have thought that the intensety of metallicas music would blend so well with the eloquent  sanfrancisco symphony orchestra. Classics such as Master of Puppets and for  whom the bell tolls are brought to new heights, they were made to be  performed with a 100 strong orchestra. There are songs on this album that  are so underrated. The outlaw torn is an epic song, so full of diversity  and talent.  One almost brought me to tears, it is so beautiful. If I had  one complaint it is that there aren't enough songs on the album. You could  spend an hour talking about what songs should have gone on the album but in  the end you'd just realise that you had named every single song metallica  have ever written or covered. If you are a metallica fan, then you really  should have this album already. But if you aren't then this album will make  you change your ways, a definete classic.",945302400,7,1015,4.397849462365591
1099743,5,6305926794,This is probably one of the best videos of the year.  It's Metallica at its finest.  All of their songs that they sing sound a lot more powerful with the symphony.  The behind the footage tape has lots of cool footage of  the concert.  Michael Kamen is simply a genious.  This only proves one  thing: Metallica will continue to rock.,944956800,11,333,4.45

1099746,5,6305926794,"In April of 1999 new boundaries were broken yet again by the Rock God's Metallica. Classics like For Whom the Bell Tolls and Master of Puppets tore through the the speakers with a new sound, ""a classic sound.""  Harmonies and booming overtones were given a new meaning, and what a better  way to do this than with the San Francisco Symphony. This is the ultimate  concert and a definate must have for the Metallica fans and people who like  ""real music.""

1099961,1,6305926794,Where to start? Thanks Lars and James for being the poster children for sell outs. This S & M is a leading example of doing anything for money. What happened to the days when James was vocally against posers and sell outs? I mean honestly everything you have done after...And Justice For All was crap. The Black Album should be under the POP section is music stores because thats the album you went Popular with. Lars became some paint collector...thats not Metal. James got sober and could not write anything decent there after. What happened to the band? The Big Four? What a joke! They probably intentionally left Iron Maiden off the list because Maiden would have the headline anywhere out of the US. Megadeth and Slayer are bigger than Metallilosers could ever imagine being outside the US. Anyways thats my rant. This album sucks.,1448150400,,836,4.772413793103448

What is kind of funny is seeing all the old people in the orchestra that are like ""I just wanna get paid and get out."" But what is really amazing is the last song ""Battery"". Adding an orchestra to a Thrash Speed Metal song is amazing and calls on very strong concentration on the orchestra. This is something you need to watch.",1353715200,,465,4.235955056179775

1100547,5,6305926794,"While bored a few weeks ago, I searched youtube for Metallica videos.  Thank God I did, because I never expected that this treasury existed.  After listening to a couple of songs on youtube, I ordered this DVD.

Okay, so you might be thinking that I'm not a Metallica purist since I wasn't aware of this concert, and you'd be right.  However, I've converted every single person that I've shown this DVD into a Metallica fan, so I'm making up for it.

Words cannot describe the power that the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra adds to this concert.  Every member of the orchestra had his/her A-game on that night, and they had an exhilarating time performing to that crowd.  My very favorite part is the cello solo in ""Enter Sandman.""  Sends shivers up my spine every time.

If you're on the fence wondering if this DVD is worth your money, I would push you off that fence and tell you that this is a rare find.  You will not regret buying this--you'll be headbanging and applauding shamelessly.

Trust me on this one.",1291766400,,1016,4.588888888888889
1100548,5,6305926794,"Even if one is not a Metallica fan, the power and rage of Metallica and their music is undeniable. The San Francisco Symphony, with Michael Kamen as the conductor, is regarded as one of the best orchestras in the world.  One would think that these musicians are disparities and would never cross path. ""How can a thrash metal band sound remotely decent with an orchestra?"" One would ask. Well, Metallica, Michael Kamen, and the San Francisco Symphony orchestra did it; and it was a masterpiece.

From the second Metallica walked onto the stage, the mutual respect between these true musicians was evident. Opening with The Ecstasy of Gold, drifting to The Call of Ktulu, then to the wrathful Master of Puppets, everyone in the stadium was ecstatic. The unexpected harmony was largely due to the conductor, Michael Kamen. The orchestra definitely volumed up, to the classic songs of Metallica (such as Of Wolf and Man and Devil's Dance).

Two of my favorites that I found to be especially dark and heavy were - Human and One. In my opinion, I think the music of Metallica and the Symphony blended perfectly in these two songs. All the audience were standing from their seats while the band and the Orchestra were making their music. Dark, raw, and astonishing......

S & M is a masterpiece.",1280448000,,1289,4.792792792792793
1100549,5,6305926794,"I've always liked Metallica. I remember when they came up through the Los Angeles and then San Francisco heavy metal music scenes. They were something of an outrage, of course, but an attractive outrage. I also found their MTV videos compelling viewing, back in the days when MTV was all videos. Real good band, albeit somewhat turbulent. Excellent and non-compromising. Very distinct signature sound.

Well, some years ago I read about Metallica producing a concert in conjunction with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. Heavy Metal with a symphony orchestra? Who ever thought this one up? Well, I finally got around to ordering the video. My wife and I viewed it a couple nights ago. It's a two-disc DVD and we viewed it on two nights. Outstanding! Absolutely stunning! It's one of the best rock-concert videos I've ever viewed. Both the audience and the atmosphere is totally unlike any symphony concert I've ever attended, that's for sure. Basically, it's a greatest hits album with a couple new songs added. Both the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra and Metallica were really up for this one and the audience loved it. It's a strange mixture of musical styles, but it works and makes for compelling viewing and listening. Who knows? Maybe this will be one of America's greatest contributions to classical music. Awesome!

1100551,5,6305926794,"Orchestral accompaniment to rock, as the amazon review suggests, usually results in more misses than hits.  One of my great disappointments was that the music of the Moody Blues, which you might think would be ideally suited for orchestral accompaniment, sounded only more maudlin with a 40-piece orchestra. Orchestral Yes didn't match expectations. The only examples I know of that really worked were Procol Harum Live with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra and two albums by a somewhat obscure british prog rock group, Renaissance - Turn of the Cards, and Sheherazade.

So my expectations were low when I put on Metallica S&M, especially given that heavy metal seemed like it would be far less conducive to a good orchestral collaboration than the aforementioned prog rock bands.  Surprise!!! It works.  Certainly not on every song, but there are enough cuts that benefit from orchestral layering to reward repeat listening.  Standouts include ""No Clover Leaf,"" ""One,"" and ""Enter Sandman.""

However, what really makes this compilation a truly unique find are just two songs: ""Bleeding Me"" and ""Outlaw Torn.""  On these two gems, the power of rock and the artistry of the orchestra come together to create a musical ecstasy that is damn near orgasmic.  You just want to put these songs on, turn up the volume, grab your favorite beer, and let the music wash over you through every pore of your body.

I bought this CD about 8 years ago and it has withstood the test of time.  For me, this version of ""Outlaw torn"" is the most powerful 8 minutes of music ever recorded on this planet.",1268438400,,1581,4.909774436090226

the Band and Songs are great, like we know them.
Orchestration is pathetic, quite obviously aiming for the Wagnerian,
but to no avail.
Mr. Kamen has yet to learn that in order to sound like Wagner,
you've got to write like Wagner.
Pity the poor Orchestra...",1259539200,,299,4.555555555555555
1100656,5,6305926794,"Say what you will about what late bassist Cliff Burton's attitude would have been with regards to Metallica's artistic direction in the '90s, but he would have certainly approved of this experiment with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. As illustrated at one point in the entertaining 40-minute documentary included with this release, Burton was an enthusiastic fan of classical music, and the concert on these two DVDs is a great example of how the two genres -- at first seemingly opposed -- can meld instead of clash.

I'd like to take some time to review Sam Graham's review for Amazon.com, showcased above. In it, Graham cites Metallica's fan base as being predominately white and male. That's factually on-target; even the concert footage confirms this. However, there are many female fans in the audience as well, some in the front row no less -- not to mention millions of female fans, then and now, all over the world. It demeans them to imply they're nearly nonexistent. And here are certainly many fans who are not white; why race even enters into Graham's review is a mystery, as is the seeming offense at James Hetfield's calling the audience ""man."" It's called a colloquialism.

As for Graham's assertion that the orchestra ""adds texture but not much else"" to Metallica's sound, I beg to differ there as well, but only in regards to certain songs. True, on some songs (mostly from the Load-ReLoad era), there's not much the orchestra can do -- they offer some moments where they just follow the guitars. 'Fuel' is an prime example of this. That song's inclusion is strange, since it is essentially a song about going really fast in a car, which is not something that lends itself to violins and a harp playing in the background.

Where the orchestra really shines shows when the ""old stuff"" is performed. One needs to only listen to the S&M version of 'Call of Ktulu' to see this executed. Far more than ""superfluous bombast"",'Call of Ktulu' is the perfect song for this concert. In the documentary, Hetfield mentions how members of the orchestra were surprised to see such complex song arrangements from a rock band (though he wasn't specific on the songs they meant, I doubt they said it regarding 'Devil's Dance'), and it's during these arrangements that the concert excels. The version of 'The Thing That Should Not Be' here is even better than the version found on Master of Puppets, almost to the point where you might feel like the band originally intended an orchestra for the song. It's a real shame that other classic Metallica songs like 'Fade to Black' and 'Sanitarium -- both of which would certainly be enhanced by an orchestra -- didn't make it on the setlist.

Weirdly, Graham says the show is ""...basically just a filmed concert, with little in the way of additional visual interest."" What sort of additional visual interest did Graham envision? Explosions, maybe? That wouldn't be practical, given where the concert took place. Everything else was done that night to make the visual experience entertaining as well: the lighting changes follow the mood of the songs (at one point during 'For Whom the Bell Tolls', they shut off completely), there are multiple dynamic camera angles (a few humorously close to the mic), so what else could have been added? Furthermore, the DVDs allow for multi-angle views for select songs -- follow the band member of your choice.

Graham has at least one part right: the sound quality is excellent. In addition to the superb mix, the option exists for the viewer to virtually mute either Metallica or the orchestra. This addition alone makes the purchase worthwhile. If you'd like proof of the fallacy that the orchestra doesn't add much, turn off Metallica for awhile (just a little while, of course). Hear for yourself their contributions to the concert. And yes, Graham also correctly points out that most everyone filmed seems to be having a great time. It's especially entertaining to see members of an orchestra, normally an austere group, getting excited.

Basically: take Graham's review with heaps of salt. This DVD set is a necessary addition to any Metallica fan's video library, and something that can perhaps bring lovers of both metal and classical music to the same room to actually enjoy a concert at the same time. (But not for long after. Soon enough, the metal fan will want to talk about Ride the Lightning and the classical fan will want to chat about Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture, and the two will probably part ways.)",1252886400,,4509,4.887581699346406

1100753,4,6305926794,"The key to a band's ultimate survival lies in its ability to do new things. Metallica is one of those bands that is willing to take chances: first with their music and secondly with how that music is presented to its fans. You may not always like the music but it's never boring.

In April 1999 the band played two shows at the Berkeley Community Theatre with Michael Kamen conducting the San Francisco Symphony. The nights were a mix of heavy metal styling joined to classical music. The strange and amazing thing was that the band actually pulled it off quite well.

The shows were performed on a stripped down stage with little background except a screen and some lighting effects. The music was a good representation of the band's music up to that point in its career. In 2.5 hours most of the band's catalogue was showcased. Standout performances included Master of Puppets,Fuel, No Leaf Clover, Sad But True and the ever popular Enter Sandman. The orchestra enhanced the performance by giving the songs a new sonic depth.

The dis has some issues: first the concert is spread over two DVDs. The show could have been conveniently placed on one disc. The sound mix (newly remastered in 5.1 Surround) has a sort of tinny feel at times that was not noticible in the Dolby 2.0 mix that was available on the source video tapes.

Hey the concept of a head banger band combined with a symphony was very intriguing.  And it delivered far more than I ever imagined.  Having played in a symphony for 5 years during my school days -- I was more than a little concerned about the symphony's arrangement and hoped that Metallica wouldnt just drown them out.  Michael Kamen (or whomever) was masterful in blending the symphony together with the metal to provide a very robust and rich sound.  And the band doesnt overpower the symphony at all. As a metal head banger I was also worried that they would produce a milk toast or watered down version of Metallica -- again no worries mate!  Metallica sounds great and the symphony adds an amazing texture to them.  The DVD visually is very well done -- cameras transition from musician to musician and angle to angle in a coheisive fashion so that the viewer feels like part of the performance or at least being part of the front row.  All parties appear to be enjoying themselves tremendously - which makes viewing the DVD even more fun.

1. The Ecstasy of Gold: The SFSO opened the concert by performing this Ennio Morricone piece, I think I like this verion more than the version on ""The Good, The Bad And The Ugly"" soundtrack. 5/5

2. The Call of Ktulu: This instrumental was rarely performed live, it sounds awesome, the SFSO makes it a little more dramatic whith the string section, especially with the violins. 5/5

3. Master of Puppets: A masterpiece, pumping energy, the symphony and metallica stay together at top notch. The crowd shouting ""Come crawling faster, Obey your master"" make you want to sing with everyone. 5/5

4. Of Wolf & Man: Hmm.. Not bad, could have been better, I liked the original version better. 3.5/5

5. The Thing That Should Not Be: It slows down in ccomparrison to the previous songs, I like it anyway. 4/5

6. Fuel: Awesome pumping energy, I like it that before the song began the guys made some cool guitar riffs that sounds exactly like a race car starting. It surpasses the pumping energy of the original studio version. 5/5

7. The Memory Remains: Sounds awesome especially when the crowd sings ""la,la,la,la, la la la la"". 4.5/5

8. No Leaf Clover: Pretty good, they made this one a single with a music video, it was pretty good. 4.5/5

9. Hero of the Day: James's voice sounds deep on this one, it stills bring me chills down my spine. 5/5

10. Devil's Dance: I never loved this song that much, but it sounds really good here and at a time it goes dramatic. 4.5/5

11. Bleeding Me: Sounds awesome, great closure for the first half of this memorable classic concert in rock history. 5/5

12. Nothing Else Matters: Awesome ballad, the SFSO adds more suspense and more chills down my spine on this song. James's voice sound very inspired on this one.  5/5

13.  Until It Sleeps: Sounds pretty good. I would have prefered someting like ""Fade to Black"" or ""Welcome Home Sanitarium"" But I ain't complaining. 4/5

14. For Whom the Bell Tolls: Sounds amazing and richer than ever. James's voice and playing sounds very inspired and at top notch. so is Lars's drumming, Kirk's guitarr shredding and Jason's Bass lines. The symphony adds suspense in the beggining before vocals start, listen closely to the percussion section of the SFSO, because you can hear the bells ringing. 5/5

15. -Human: The second new song performed at this concert, sounds pretty good. 4.5/5

16. Wherever I May Roam: Sounds decent, not one of the best songs but I still like it. 3.5/5

17. The Outlaw Torn: Good. 4/5

18. Sad But True: Really Good. 5/5

19. One: Amazing, their best song ever, period. I love the beggining with the special sound effects. The orchestra, especially the percussion section does an amazing job imitating the gunfire. Just perfect, no doubt about it. 5/5

20.  Enter Sandman: Another grat Metallica classic, sounds awesome. 5/5

21. Battery: Heavy,loud,great closure to an awesome concert, just the way I like it. 5/5

My overall rating: 4.6/5 stars

1100953,5,6305926794,"I have been a part of the Metallica Army for many years now, and when I first found out that the guys were going to play with a symphony, my heart leapt into my throat.  Being a former musician for eight years, I have a deep love and appreciation for classical music, and the overall sound of a symphony orchestra.

Being a Metallica fan since the 1980s, I have a deep love and appreciation for their awesomely bombastic music and ability to take simple musical notes, and weave a song that hits hard and deep on the emotions.

That said, I purchased the CD of the S&M concert, and immediately fell in love.

The fact that the concert opened with Enrico Morricone's ""The Ecstacy of Gold"" was more than enough for me.  When the first bell tone hits, and the solo trumpet plays along with the swelling roar of the crowd... it's enough to give you goosebumps.

Then, at the climax of the song, you hear the crowd scream their heads off... that's because James is entering the stage, solo.  I would have done the same thing myself.

So, after an amazing performance of ""Ecstacy"", I get to hear something I didn't expect at all - ""The Call of Ktulu.""  From what I understand, this was the first time the guys had performed Ktulu live.  Well, let's just say that that song is an awesome one in itself, and the addition of the symphony orchestra just made it thousands of times better... I loved how Ktulu and ""Master of Puppets"" were seamlessly transitioned.  It was truly awesome.

The entire concert is full of energy, as you would expect with Metallica, and the orchestra just seems to pump them up.  It's a two-way effect.  The orchestra keeps pumping up Metallica, and Metallica pumps up the orchestra, and the fans are feeding off it all, simultaneously.  And the fans keep Metallica and the Orchestra going.

Okay, so, after I bought the CD and wore out both discs in my car stereo... I had to see if the concert was video taped.  Thank God, it was.  I ordered the DVD immediately, and when I got it, I watched it continuously.  I loved it so much.  Seeing them live and hearing the music was almost too much for me.  I still love it.  In fact, a friend of mine borrowed my DVD, and he lost it, so, I'm ordering another one as soon as I finish this review.

If you are a fan of Metallica, buy this CD, and buy this DVD.  If you like classical music and are open to new experiences, buy this CD and DVD.  You won't be disappointed.

It's heavy, it's intense, it's beautiful, and it's one the greatest things that has ever reverberated against my eardrums.

The brass and again the strings amplify the heavy riffing of songs like For Whom the Bell Tolls and Fuel.  The ballads are almost personified by the soft violins, creating a near-tear jerking blend of the most heartfelt poetry in music history and Michael Kamen's genius vision.  Hetfield's voice is touching at times, downright scary at others.  Lars, despite what you think of him, creates impossibly speedy rolls that will make you believe he has three sets of limbs.  Hammett's (still) incredible high wails fill the scape of sound with an undertone of roughness and grit (when appropriate, of course).  Newstead lays down the usual basslines, but unfortunately his contribution is often drowned out by the sheer amplitude that over 100 instruments can produce.  Luckily that oversight doesn't cost the production in overall sound quality, which is the best I have ever heard from a live concert.  The stunning performance of metal anthem One is the climax of the careers of four middle-aged men who used to be on top of the world.  My only complaint is the omission of a few classic songs (...and Justice for All, The Unforgiven, Fade to Black), but that is to be expected of any greatest hits collaboration (which, in reality, S&M is).

If you want to have your ears sweetly shattered by the best noise the Lord our God has allowed to be heard on his earth, buy the double-live album.  If you want to turn your living room into a chamber of echoing serenity and flashing lights, buy the DVD.  If you thought that Metallica has sucked since the Black Album, buy both as payment for your transgressions.  You won't be disappointed.",1129507200,,2018,4.808695652173913

BUT, this dvd changed my mind, it gave me a new perspective on classic music. the thing is it's really enjoyable.

the concert includes great song selections such as master of puppetz, the one, roam, nothing else, bells,fuel(love lars's drums), and 2 unreleased songs. i thought battery was kind of inappropriate for the show but hey if it works then why not, it's a great way to end the show.

the dvd includes bonus material such as a 40 minute documentary on the making of S&M, one on one interviews with the guyz and also michael kamen. some parts were hilarious. it also give u the opportunity to choose different angles for a few songs.

this is something u can't miss. it's brilliant",1126828800,,1034,4.431578947368421

Also ""The Call of Ktulu"", ""No Leaf Clover"" and ""Battery"".  But Metallica would have added few more songs as an encore....should have played ""Creeping Death"", ""Sanitarium"", ""Unforgiven"" and ""Fade To Black"".  Well overall, I enjoyed that Metallica DVD ""S & M"" very much....and I can keep on watching that same concert DVD again and again.  Most of all, this ""S & M"" DVD is dedicated to the late Cliff Burton (he should be proud of those guys).  We love you, Cliff!!",1124150400,,843,4.86013986013986

----------------------------------------------------------------

PROS

*The spectacle that it was to see 4 Metal gods backed up by a over 100 classical musicians was just incredible in itself.

*Some songs were made to be backed up by an orchestra. ""Outlaw Torn"", ""Ktulu"", ""Bleeding Me"", ""One"" and ""Nothing Else Matters""  were all amazing.

*Metallica themselves were on top form and there wasn't one fault in their playing throughout the gig.

*2 new songs, ""Minus Human"" and ""No Leaf Clover"", were entered into the setlist. The never before heard material were nothing short of brilliant.

*The Documentary in the Extras is quite enjoyable and interesting.

----------------------------------------------------------------

CONS

*The choice of songs could've been better. No Fade To Black? Sanitarium? And yet they put in some songs with which the orchestra didn't adapt very well. Enter Sandman for example, was quite average. as was Sad But True and yet again, Not enough old stuff.

1101044,4,6305926794,"I remember it like it was yesterday;April 22, 1999. I was preparing to make a two day bus trip form the M-I-A(that's Miami for the urban slang challenged) to San Francisco. To reward myself for graduating early from college, I decided to attend Metallica's S&M concert, the joint venture with the San Francisco Symphony. Being a fan of Metallica and heavy metal for nearly 10 years( a black guy who adores hip hop), going to my first metal concert(and in this format, no less) would be a revelation, indeed. The second I stepped off the bus and to the Berkeley auditorium on the 24th, the adrenaline rush was moving. I didn't have to deal with a sub-par opening act; for the next three hours, it was all Metallica, all the time, and I couldn't have been happier. The show, like all Metallica shows, was tremendous; my only complaint is about the set list. When I heard that Metallica was preforming with an orchestra, I was estactic; the work from Metallica's 80's heyday was made for symphonic orientation, from the lightning-fast straight up rockers(Master Of Puppets, Battery, Disposable Heroes),half-ballad/half-thrash gems(One, Welcome Home Sanitarium,Fade To Black)to their slower but heavy songs(Enter Sandman, For Whom The Tolls, The Thing That Should Not Be). What's with the OVER abundance of songs from Load and Reload? To be honest, I don't mind songs like ""Until It Sleeps""(my favorite 90's Metallica song)""hero Of The Day, ""Fuel""(which got some added kick with the backing of the symphony) and ""The Memory Remains"", but Surely ythe band could have put some of their better songs in those spots. As a matter of fact, if I were in charge(which I should be of all that exists), this would be my set list:

Orion

The Call Of Ktulu

Master Of Puppets

Welcome Home Sanitarium

The Thing That Should Not Be

Fuel

The Memory Remains

Hero Of The Day

No Leaf Clover

Creeping Death(It's such a big fan favorite!)

Anesthesia(something for Jason Newsted since he has to pantomime through his performance of One, and we all know why)

Nothing Else Matters

Until It Sleeps

For Whom The Bell Tols

Ride The Lightning

The Unforgiven

Fade To Black(HOW COULD THEY HAVE FORGOTTEN THIS?!!!)

One(best song on the album, period)

bought this DVD.At best,I thought it would be a mediocre

Metallica concert while the symphony plays silently in

the background. I was so wrong!!!First,the concert hall

fits perfectly. Everything was planned out carefully.

The set list is great. When you hear 'Ktulu','Of wolf and men',

'Bleeding me','Whom the bell tolls' & 'One' you'll see what I mean. Actually,all the songs are great. There are two new songs:

'No leaf clover' and 'Minus Human'.'Clover' is amazing,taking full advantage of the 100+ symphony members. This DVD has replayable value. I watch it every day,at least a part of it,and I find new positive things about it every day. Example:The song 'Outlaw torn' from 'LOAD'.I didn't listen to it enough to like it. But the version on S&M is f.....g amazing. I love it now.

Same goes for 'Hero of the day'.

And the symphony isn't just sitting in the background. Symphony gave every song a breath of fresh air. Like a fifth Metallica member. I especially like when Hetfield sings 'Master of puppets' with the crowd. Hammet changed almost every solo a little bit and they still sound great. Jason is a energy bomb. When you hear his 'hoi! hoi!hoi!'you will do that with the crowd. Lars is frightening good in 'Bells'.In short,this DVD is definitely worth your time and money.

This proves that bands like Kiss and Aerosmith will never match up with Metallica when it comes to who is America's best band. Metallica has done all that they have, and has exceeded all of their records so around the year 2015, expect the dudes at Metallica to be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.",1094515200,,619,4.43859649122807

This DVD collection can keep you mesmerized totally in the METAL ZONE, the orchestra is another fabulous contribution.

Also the display for the song ""One"" Wich had a mayor impact of the view on the military; And last but not least the best feature ever is the release of the song ""No Leaf Clover"".

I even think the mixing is different between the 2 discs.  I'm not a big Metallica fan, but I do like there music, and  I am ADDICTED to this album.  I hope this isn't too blasphemous, but I think they should posthumously make Michael Kamen a member of Metallica.  His additions to some of Metallica's songs take them to a whole different level.  I'd have to disagree with Der Kommissar about which fans of Metallica would like this album.  While the originals of some of the songs from the 80's are a bit more stark than the versions in this album, they are no less powerful.  As he points out, Call of Ktulu gets a royal kick in the a** here and is thus one of the best songs on the disk.  IMHO, the BEST song on the disk is a toss up between For Whom the Bell Tolls (although I find it interesting that the only place where the symphony DOESN""T use bells is this song.  The intro is still cool though.) and The Thing That Should Not Be, both songs from the 80's.  If anything the weaker songs are the one's from the 90's.  Enter Sandman completely loses it's momentum in this performance, and the orchestra doesn't quite fit with Sad But True.

1101291,5,6305926794,"Written in memory of Maestro Michael Kamen, (15 April 1948 - 18 November 2003), by a fan of his.
There is no doubt in my mind what an amazing and passionate spirit Michael Kamen is...this only made it even more evident.
The arrangements, of course, were spectacular, and I cannot think of a single song that did not benefit tremendously from Michael and his orchestra. One could hardly imagine two more different genres of music--and yet the result was such that every note, every majestic chord was exactly where it should be...as if it had been destined from the very beginning.
I began my musical life through classical music and only later moved into rock when I heard Pink Floyd, with whom Michael collaborated--and for me, having enjoyed both genres, this is the perfect synthesis.  I will probably not ever investigate Metallica's other works...for I feel like all that I need to know is right here.
Obviously from a visual standpoint, I wish there would have been much more footage of Michael, as I am much more his fan than I am of Metallica, but I am very pleased that they honored him with his very own ""Maestro"" section in the bonus materials, and I was also very happy with the interview he did in the documentary. When he was visible, I couldn't help but feel invigorated by the sheer energy of his personality. His joy was obvious--watch for when he shouts ""MASTER!"" along with the audience during ""Master of Puppets""! And his vitality becomes all the more amazing and wonderful when you realize that Mr. Kamen was already having to deal with the challenges of MS--but he never allows that to stand in his way here. That in and of itself is a testament to the power of his spirit. Even when he isn't visible, that power reverberates through that orchestra and into the heart of the listener! Even now, when I sit here writing this in silence, the memory sings joyously in my heart...where it will be treasured forever.
Despite S & M being a DVD of bold statements, experiencing it was often a case of being touched by the little details...one of the most wonderful moments was as Michael came back onstage for the second part of the concert, and one of the hardcore Metallica fans in the front row greets him with that 4/4 time gesture, just as enthused about Michael's presence as he was with the presence of the band. It was clear that the audience loved him--and at one point, I could very clearly read Michael's lips as he looked out at them: ""I love you!"" And somehow, even the song with the grimmest lyrics became part of this great celebration. And that's how I think he was...smiling even through the most difficult things--and in a different way, smiling even now.
""How does it feel to be alive?""
What can I say after watching this, but WONDERFUL! Both this life and the life that is eternal!
There is one fact that cannot be denied...Michael Kamen will ALWAYS be remembered.
I don't think he'd want it any other way...I feel that I have just experienced a celebration of life, a legacy of power.",1070668800,5,3020,4.613382899628252

Other reviewers are right when they talk about people who weren't into Metallica,but loved this DVD.Fun for the whole family,really!10 stars!",1068076800,3,1050,4.681081081081081
1101294,5,6305926794,"What happens when you mix a heavy metal band with the San Francisco Symphony?  High quality sounds that compliment one another.  This is a highly creative (and original) task.  Although I am not typically a fan of this gentre, Metallica knows how to transcend one's worries into the emotional impulses flowing through one's mind when listening to the work.  The music demands--yes, demands--that it be played loud to hear the different symbols, vibrations, and impulses from the work.
The base is particularly noticeable, vibrating entire rooms if played loud enough.  My favorite songs on this track include ""Nothing Else Matters,"" which send shivers down my spine, especially if listened to during a particularly negative mood swing.  Nothing else matters indeed, especially after you listen to this and get over the pain you may experience at a particular time.  A great band: Just wish they created more albums!

1101296,5,6305926794,"Awesome, the orchestra adds texture and fills that allow the band to emphasise the potent riffs, crunchy tight rythmns and razor edged solos. All backed with the furious precision of blisteringly fast percussion.
Hetfield sings from the heart while Lars goes completely insane during One - until you have heard that song on this DVD you have not truly heard it. This may well be Metallica at the very height of their musical abilities. If so this will be a fitting tribute.
The production quality of the DVD is fantastic. Audio is the best I have heard, camera work is very good, and the bonus material is truly that and not just filler for the sake of the format.
And your neighbours will love it.",1059004800,,698,4.592
1101297,4,6305926794,"Mixing the sacred and the profane, Metallica perform some of their best (and worst) with the 104-piece San Fransisco Symphony Orchestra. Certain songs, like ""The Call of Ktulu"", ""Of Wolf and Man"", ""The Thing That Should Not Be"", ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"", ""One"", and ""The Outlaw Torn"" improve vastly with the extra textures that the orchestra adds, giving the songs more depth, and in some cases, balls-to-the-wall power. Others, like ""Sad But True"" and ""Fuel"", make you wonder why the hell they were included in the first place.
Sound production on this is perfect and second-to-none. It's incredible to be able to hear the orchestra and the world's loudest rock band mesh together so well on some songs. Camera/visual work is impressive as well. Turn the lights out and watch this on a big TV screen with the sound turned way up. Guaranteed to make the neighbours move. Especially with ""Of Wolf and Man"" blasting out.",1048204800,,919,4.859872611464968
1101298,5,6305926794,"I am a Metallica fan, but the first time that I heard the S&M CD, I didn't like it because it wasn't the pure sound of Metallica, you know, sometimes you try to be a ""purist"". A friend of mine gave it to me as a birthday present, well, a couple of months after that I bought this EXCELLENT DVD.
The sound in 5.1 is completely great, like being there, and the songs selection is great too.
I really recommend this DVD/VHS to anyone who likes, even a little, this great band. I promise that if you can't feel tuned with it at the beginning, you will love it in a very short time.",1047081600,,577,4.0701754385964914
1101299,3,6305926794,"I think the excellent production of this DVD is probably its strongest point. With the obvious exception of ""The Ecstasy of Gold"", the cameras (and the sound mix) do tend do overshadow the orchestra by showing the band too often. The band had no little or no input into the scores or arrangements and they seem to lack serious effort and motivation. The doco isn't nealry as good as the ""Year & a half in the life of.."" docos; as unlike then, they are now used to the cameras and 'play' to them.  Despite what they say on the doco, im sure it would have been a much more emotional and important peformance and experience if they didn't mostly sit back and let Kamen setup everything.
Take for example the brlilliant 1999 Deep Purple with the LSO. That performance was mostly written by John Lord (DP keys) INCLUDING of course the entire orchestral arrangement for the mighty masterpiece ""Concerto for group and orchestra"" as well as others. Now THIS is rock group/orchestra concert pairing that is.....exceptional!,  the concert blows S&M away but the production is not as good.
Another main complaint i have about this is the choice of songs, like on cunning stunts they like to forget most of their classic songs of old and try to promote their new stuff, this album is there best work since the black album, but thats not much too say.
With all that said i still think their are some great moments on these discs, a highlight being the climactic transition between ktulu and puppets -still sends shivers doen my spine. As well as the end pieces. Get it if you still want a 'metallica' dvd as it mostly is.

1101398,4,6305926794,"As an owner of many concert DVD's, the sound on this is amazing.  Metallica sonically shine on this DVD.  It will knock your socks off with or w/o a Home Theater System.  Metallica play with emotion and they are captured beautifully with inventive camera angles that seem to coincide with the music especially during the opening of One.  The making-of documentary is a treat for fans as it shows the band at their most honest.  I'm sure Metallica's other DVD's showcase that aspect better but I thought it was interesting.  Everyone has something to say on track selection here, so I will add my two cents as well.  Devil's Dance, Fuel, Memory Remains all sound good with the symphony but aren't very good songs, especially with the early catalog of Metallica's music.  Songs like Fade to Black, Unforgiven, Sanitarium, could have been incredible additions and could have made this concert something special.  Fuel is too fast for the symphony and just sounds odd.  The 2 new songs are OK but nothing groundbreaking.  However, the 2 tracks that make this DVD worth owning are Master of Puppets and One.  These are incredible songs on their own but coupled with a good symphonic arrangement and perfect sound and a gutsy vocal performance, these songs flat out pound your audio system and are visually impressive.  Enter Sandman is another concert staple and sounds great as well with the addition of the symphony, however, the guitars are a bit muted.  An honarble mention is the hyper-fast Battery.  A long favorite of mine from the PUPPETS album, it quite possibly sounds better here, than it does on the remastered album.  Metallica play with guts here and in my opinion, sound incredible with the symphony in most cases.  All in all, worth owning to wow your friends if you have a nice sound system and if you are a fan.  My only gripe aside from track selection, is the somewhat muddy production and the average picture quality.  The Eagles DVD has a much clearer picture.  Highly recommended and worn your neighbors because it will shake your room.",1041465600,2,2054,4.797720797720798

I am not sure if this is for all MetallicA fans, the name S&M stands for symphony & MetallicA, yeah they play their songs being backed up by a Symphony.  The DVD is just the performance being taped.

It was excellent, the only downside for me was they played too many songs from LOAD and ReLOAD.  The two new songs, No Leaf Clover and - Human, were awesome.  The lighting effects on One were really amazing.  It was great seeing the classic Metallica songs being played with a symphony.  It was very fun and exciting to watch.

Maybe because S&M ROCKS!) The orchestra really adds a lot of (for lack of a better word) body to some of Metallica's material- Of Wolf and Man and Sandman being two good examples. I personally do not think that the two new songs (Human and No Leaf Clover) were unwanted rejects from the Load/Re-Load sessions. The sounded similar, but leaned towards the older material.
The picture and sound quality are very good, capturing the feel of the concert.
All in all, this was a good album/DVD. Some of the arrangements fell short of what they could have done (Master of Puppets, Hero of the Day), but the vast majority of them were excellent, which makes S&M well worth owning.",1012867200,,834,4.566666666666666

Ego, vanity, and greediness aside I think Metallica and the Sanfrancisco Symphony did an incredible job and I would of given anything to see the peformance live.

1101406,5,6305926794,"Metallica totally kicks butt with the release of the DVD companion to the incredible CD S & M with the San Francisco Symphony.  Metallica is one of my favorite bands (if not the favorite) and I love how they completely reinvent themselves every couple of years.  The Black album was a complete departure for them from their earlier stuff.  And yet, working with Bob Rock they produced a great album in my humble opinion.  Every since the Black album, they've been constantly evolving as musicians and I think this DVD is another step in that evolution.  Never afraid to try new things, Metallica gets together with the San Francisco Symphony to create magic.
This is a MUST OWN DVD for anyone that likes Metallica.  Several of my friends that aren't nuts about Metallica love this DVD.  Michael Kamen and the San Francisco Symphony do a great job in working the Metallica making instant classics out of these songs.  Starting with the Ecstasy of Gold (The Gold, Bad and the ugly) to some of the old favorites including Master of Puppets, Sad but true, Battery, One, Enter Sandman, For whom the bell tolls, Devil's Dance to the new songs No Leaf Clover (my favorite) and Human, this DVD is non-stop action that will have you singing and moshing along.

I'm so happy to be seing that there's three new tracks. No Leaf Clover is one of 'em. It's never gotten old one day in my life. Which to me is amazing. Because of so much play on rock radio.

Any review which says the sound quality on this dvd is bad is talking out of their arse and has probably been playing it through their stereo t.v. or 2 channel hi-fi amp. Run this baby through a 5.1 Dolby Digital amp and 6 speakers, close your eyes and you ARE at the concert, superb stuff. Just make sure you select the 5.1 option as it defaults to the 2.0 track. However, there are a couple of small points which I feel would have made this a must-have title for ANY music lover. The inclusion of a DTS soundtrack would have been a major addition along with a nice 16X9 anamorphic transfer (as it is the image quality isn't bad but it is a little soft and appears out of focus a few times, especially during the documentary). Finally, I'm not a huge Metallica fan but I think some of the song selections could have been better (Devil's Dance springs to mind) - songs like The Unforgiven I and II are perfect for his sort of musical arrangement.... maybe next time eh lads? All in all this dvd rocks. Excellent documentary, good use of angles (though a few more songs would have been nice).  The Ecstacy of Gold intro followed by Call of Ktulu are some of the best orchestrations I've ever heard and it just gets better, and heavier, from then on. When James and the lads saunder on during the Gold intro it's definitely a moment Nigel Tufnell would have been proud of.",986169600,4,1441,4.376865671641791

The piece was written for an orchestra.  It was originally performed with 2 guitars, a bass, and the luckiest set of drums in the world.  It was majestic.  With the SF Symphony, it sends chills through the spinal fluid of the most jaded listener.  As for the rest of the selections, you will never be able to listen to them in the same way.

I was so lost on these cuts, I wanted to cut my hair off! The geeks with VCR's really need to spend some money and get a good DVD player. The DVD is very good, but for some reason it seemed that the editor of this 2 disc monstrosity, couldn't put it together if James or Lars themselves were standing over him with a 30.06 and a Mini-Gun! The editor should be sent to Siberia! Plus the 5.1 audio punched James' vocal up so high, one has to crank down the center channel almost by half! I like the Symphony & Band or band only, ect, as this is the only way you can her the two new ones, ""No Leaf Clover"" and ""-Human"" the way one normally is introduced to new stuff.

Also there is 40 minute Great documentary , four Multi-Angle  songs ( each Member of the Band has a Camera following him during the song  ) .

1101597,3,6305926794,"S&M is obviously one of Metallica's best efforts.  The band and the  orchestra make a great collaboration; it's a must-get for any Metallica  fan.  One small piece of advice: get the CD, not the video, unless you  really want it.  I mean, the video is a bit useful; it gives you a taste of  the intensity of a Metallica show, and is cool the first few times you  watch it, but overall you'll be a lot happier with the CD, which never gets  old (duh, it's a Metallica album).  The video does get old pretty quickly,  for 3 reasons (all of which pretty obvious):
1. Not-so-great sound  quality.  Can't hear the bass.  CD is a lot crisper.
2. The CD you can  travel with (i.e. take it to school and stuff like that).  The video, of  course, is restricted to home use.  And if you're like me and are the only  person in the family who doesn't mind Metallica you may have to resort to  just watching it when you're the only person in the house (unless you have  a VCR in a seperate private room, but that still doesn't seem to stop  complaints).
3. The CD lets you skip tracks so you can listen to any song  you feel like, and again, the video doesn't let you do that, unless you  want to fast-forward and rewind the hell out of the tape.
So in the  long-run, the CD's are a better deal for S&M.",964569600,,1290,4.16734693877551

As any true Metallica fan knows,  seeing a live show is equal to a religious experience and this disc proves,  without a shadow of a doubt, that Metallica can rock in even the most  unexpected of circumstances (headlining a symphony?). You've all heard the  CD, but watching the performance brings it into a new light. Not only is  the sound great and the visuals superior (the picture on this DVD is one of  the clearest I've ever seen), it is fun to see the crowd scenes. From the  protesters outside, to the symphony fans rolling their eyes at the t-shirt  clad youth surrounding them, to the tattoo covered shirtless man in the  audience, singing along and cheering with the best of them, the crowd is  definitely worth seeing. One of the highlights of the show is during  ""Memory Remains"", when the audience fills in for Marrianne  Faithful, never missing a beat.  This disc is 2.5 hours of pure  adrenaline, guaranteed to please. Invite some friends over and have a night  of ""culture"".",963187200,5,1177,4.485849056603773

Well, it turns out that the package was  right.  There are two additional ones which are NOT under the  ""Angles"" Menu (in fact, they're hidden:  ""Fuel"" and  ""Enter Sandman"").  The only way to access the multi-angle feature  to those songs is to access the multi-angle control feature on your DVD  player or DVD-ROM program (I did, and it worked for me!).  All you have to  do is choose an angle number, and the program will focus in on whichever  member you happen to choose (James, Kirk, Lars, or Jason).  It should work.

1101652,5,6305926794,"The DVD is a better choice than the CD and the video for one reason:  you  can switch between listening to the orchestra with band, the band only, or  the orchestra only!  It's SO cool when you listen to the orchestra-only  version of some of the songs-- Michael Kamen has added so much to the  music!  When you're listening to the regular orchestra+band, it weaves  together so seamlessly that you can miss a lot of the more subtle elements  of the music.  Try listening to ""Call of Ktulu"" and ""Hero of  the Day"" with just orchestra . . there's some great stuff in there.  Listening to just the band is also pretty interesting, and the documentary  is pretty cool too.  Definitely worth the cash...even if you already have  the CD or video.",962668800,2,741,4.507575757575758

If you have seen the VHS version or if you own it, you might just think it is the same thing in higher quality on DVD, but there is much  more.  This video has so many great special features.  My favorite was the  way you can filter the audio to hear only the symphony without Metallica,  or only Metallica without the symphony.  The first thing I did was listen  to ""No Leaf Clover"" without the symphony.  Another really cool  feature is the angle changes that you can do on select songs.  You can  watch certain songs at 5 different angles.  The first is the original  edited camera views, but you can also watch these songs with the camera  focused on one of the four band members, James, Lars, Jason, and Kirk.  The  DVD also features an excellent behind the scenes documentary featuring  interviews with the band and with conductor Michael Kamen about preparation  for the concert and how it all came to be.  Even if you already have the  VHS version, I would still get this DVD if I were you.  The video quality  and sound quality both greatly surpass that of the VHS version.

Camera angles never get  boring and the whole stage is transformed into a spectacular of lights and  patterns that just add to the excitement of the whole concert. But the real  surprise arrives when you switch the sound options to ""just  Orchestra"". Metallica like you've never heard them before. Weird at  first to see them play but (almost) not hear them, but the Orchestra is  amazing and seem to enjoy themselves, too, which makes it more fun to  watch. I take a bow for the S.F.

Metallica's music is loud and bold an already  a wonderful  composition, the addition of the symphony is great, sweeping, and  majestic.
Look to Orion on the Master of Puppets CD if you doubt  Metallica's ability to compose and define within their genre.
This DVD is  as close to being there as it could get.  A true watermark in the potential  of the DVD medium...  This is a slice of heaven for lovers of the band...  Metallica is not out to change minds or win over someone who is usually  glued to PBS.

I have seen/heard other rock/orchestra mixes in the past, namely Deep Purple and the London Royal Philharmonic, but these were ""concept"" things with all new material that no one was familiar  with. Metallica pulled this off using their own known past material with  excellent orchestral accompaniment by the San Francisco Symphony conducted  by Michael Kamen. For those unaware, Kamen was the lead singer for a 70's  band, New York Rock & Roll Ensemble. The boys' and Kamen's effort is  about as awesome as I can conceive, on both VHS and DVD. Hearing the band  and the orchestra together gives me goosebumps everytime I hear it. If  Metallica were to tour with the orchestra, I would easily pay in exess of  $100 per ticket for seats in the back. It is THAT stupendous and  captivating.",961372800,2,805,4.77536231884058

I bought S & M on CD last year and was amazed back then at how Metallica can take such a 'crazy'  idea of mixing their music with the backing of a Symphony Orchestra.  When  I got the DVD, I was even more amazed.  Seeing them all dressed smartly was  a big shock too!  They interact with the crowd as well as they always do,  they treat the crowd as if they're all personal friends.  Having seen them  live in Milton Keynes in '99, I can relate to how the crowd must have felt.  The sound is fantastic - 5.1 or 2.0 Band & Orchestra or 2.0 Band or  2.0 Orchestra.  They way you can change to just listening to the Orchestra  or the band is a brilliant concept and you can see just how much backing  Metallica are actually getting.  I have given this DVD 5/5 because it is to  me, better than Cunning Stunts (altho I give that 5/5 as well!).  The wait  was definitely worth it.  To all Metallica fans, I suggest you get this  DVD.I know you'll all love it.  One thing tho, turn it up LOUD!

From the clips of it that i saw on MTV and VH-1, I would have  to say in Cunning Stunts, Metallica had more room to move about and  interact wih the crowd.  From what i have seen in S&M, they are  confined to a small stage.  Cunning Stunts looks more entertaining to watch  due to the interacrion with the crowd but S&M's music sounds 100%  better.  (I am not saying Cunning Stunts sound was bad either)  but if  Metallica puts their name on something, it has to be top-notch.",960422400,,630,4.032520325203252
1101692,5,6305926794,"The direction is simply stunning. The director of Metallica's Cunning Stunts stretches more direction muscle here. The editing is also excellent.
Pros:
*It's a Metallica greatest hits concert!
*The San  Fransisco Symphony were amazing. I've never seen an orchestra play so  fast.
*The lights,editing,direction,effects and the whole setting in  general were brilliant.
*Jaymz' voice was so terrific. Sometimes deep(most  of the time),sometimes touching(Nothing Else Matters,No Leaf Clover) and  sometimes powerful(The Thing That Should Not Be,Master of  Puppets,-Human).
Cons:
*Why couldn't we see a lot of Jason in the  beginning of ""For Whom The Bell Tolls""?
*""Of Wolf And  Man"" shouldn't have been changed. It's the perfect Metallica  song.
*James still hasn't perfected the part ""sleep with one eye  open,gripping your pillow tight---exit:light,enter:night"".It's not the  same as the original. In the original,the word ""light"" seems to be  extended,like this :""Eeeeexit liiiiight!"".
About the S&M  documentary,it's outstanding. The pre-show and post-show doc's have always  been so much fun.
My advice: watch the documentary first and then the  concert. I regret watching the concert first. Don't make my mistake.
And  about the memorable moments in my review of the S&M audio CD,I forgot  to add to them Lars' staggeringly fast rolls in ""Fuel"",  ""Master of Puppets"", ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"", and a  lot others.
By the way, was it just me, or was James having a blast  performing ""The Thing That Should Not Be""? I like it when he  jumps.
Also, add to the phenomenal songs, ""Battery"".  ""Devil's Dance"" and ""Enter Sandman"" were also very  cool.
By the way,I changed my mind:I think that Hammett's original  ""Of Wolf And Man"" solo was better than S&M's.(I said the  opposite in my cd review)
If you ask me what's THE most memorable moment  of the concert,it's definitely that part of ""Of Wolf And Man""  where James says ""...so seek the wolf in thyseeeeeeeeeeeelf!""  with the symphony building up. And the best part in this part is Jason's  background scream. What a rush!
Bottom line:this is one unbelievable  epic. I can't recommend it higher.",959472000,84,2146,5.244837758112094
1101693,5,6305926794,"This video is the best especially the director ""Wayne Isham"" he took exellen shots of the band, and also the conductor ""Michael Kamen"" he made v-good background music, believe me the concert is much  better than the music CD like: In ""The call of Ktulu"" you can't  almost hear the guitars but in the video you can hear the guitars like the  original track on ""Ride the Lightning"". James,Lars,Kirk,Jason  played verry well but i think if Metallica made another S&M Concert  they shall add: 1 - The Unforgiven  2 - Fade to Black 3 - The Unforgiven II  4 - Welcome Home (Sanitarium)
