4326032,5,B004C6UDLY,"Sinatra was not only a great singer but a competent actor. Great watching him as a detective. Disc is first quality with no hiss, blurs or other problems.",1354665600,,154,4.535714285714286
4326033,4,B004C6UDLY,"Frank Sinatra did a great job in this TV movie. It is a solid story of how retribution can get out of hand. The story took place in then current times the 70s and still holds up well today. Sinatra is solid as the lead detective and has a supporting cast of stellar character actors.
Two of the actors are personal favorites. Harry Gaurdino and Henry Silva are excellent in this film. Both steal scenes  when ever they appear on screen.
This is a great nights entertainment and solid Sinatra entry in his detective movies.",1343692800,7,522,4.494736842105263
4326034,5,B004C6UDLY,"Great to see Frank doing what he does so well (among other things) playing a New York flat foot.  A colorful cast and they don't make em like they used to back in the 70's with the cars as big as boats.  Lets face it this isn't ""The Godfather"" but it is a good example of its genre if a little over long, but if you like a good NYC cop yarn with the master himself at the helm this is one to watch.",1316217600,11,398,3.7261904761904763
4326035,4,B004C6UDLY,"I thought this was a real good movie. sinatra , fine acting by all. entertaining movie from beging to end.",1315872000,,106,4.35
4326036,5,B004C6UDLY,"How great to have one of Frank's best TV performances available to the public at last, this TV Special does not need reviewing its SINATRA, and very rarely did he fail to deliver!
lovely to see Martin Balsam again, one of the true greats who never quite achieved Superstardom that he deserved....buy this DVD get a cool beer or Bottle of wine and be transported
to NYC for nearly three hours of great acting, from Frank & a terrific cast......Enjoy!!",1312416000,12,450,4.6375
4326037,4,B004C6UDLY,"It is so good to see a Sinatra movie. Just gets me
going for the day. ""Contract"" was perfect for that
Tuesday. And ""Anything Goes"" with Ethel Merman, lasts
the whole week.

But even when acting weak, Sinatra does good...""Johnny
Concho"" and ""Dirty Dingus McGee"". Classics!

Nancy, Tina, Frank Jr. Please release them all.",1301702400,6,320,4.907407407407407

8422852,4,B004C6UDLY,"I remember watching this when it first came out, almost 40 years ago.  This film is an absolute time capsule of dirty, scary, dreary old New York as it was in the 1970s.  Everything is ugly--the cars, the clothes, the buildings, the streets.  Even the actors look run-down.  Growing up not far from NYC, I don't think that part of the film really hit me the first time around.  Now, looking at the strip joints and the avocado-colored appliances and the horrifying clothes, it is a visual assault.

The film itself is a pretty good police procedural, right up until Frank and the boys decide to stop playing by the rules.  It is a gritty, hard-boiled look at a long-gone era.  Pray God those clothes never make a comeback.",1497225600,2,722,4.542635658914729
8422853,4,B004C6UDLY,"As a Sinatra devotee, I loved it.  Showed once again the talents of Frank!",1468800000,,74,4.285714285714286

8422859,4,B004C6UDLY,"The movie was surprisingly good.  A little long but held my interest. The 70's setting, cops bending the rules seeking justice, and better yet nobody broke into a song!",1428105600,,168,4.793103448275862
