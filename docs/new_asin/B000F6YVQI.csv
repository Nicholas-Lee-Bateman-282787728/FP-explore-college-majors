2553392,5,B000F6YVQI,"The Learn to Nordic Ski DVD by xczone.tv, is the entry level product for beginners through to novice skiers.  It is unpretentious and straight forward in its approach.  Xczone put all the highly technical stuff in their ""Nordic Skiing Technique DVD,"" product, permitting a simple and uncluttered approach for ""Learn to Nordic Ski DVD."" This DVD starts with a ski lesson given to a beginner classic and skate skier.  You just need to follow along.  When you are ready, the second chapter, produced with the Canadian Association of Nordic Ski Instructors, explains a bit more about the underpinning fundamentals and subtly of the sport.  The third chapter, leads a novice skier towards an intermediate level proficiency.  Too often, cross-country ski videos are all about race footage or try to accommodate everyone, but satisfy no-one.  This DVD clearly is meant for total beginners to novice skiers, that just want the most basic and simple skills to get going.",1144108800,7,961,5.082802547770701

8118059,1,B000F6YVQI,"Numero Uno, this is not an integrated instructional video.  It is a hodgepodge of two unrelated sets of videos.  The first one is embarrassing.  It shows the ""student"" skiing more than the instructor, and cuts them off at the waist!  HELLO!  IT'S SKIING!  You know, on snow, like?  The feet are critical.  I'm sure the instructor is a fine skier, but she is not very articulate.  And you know what scares beginners most?  DOWNHILL.  Instead, the first video shows NO instruction on stopping, going downhill, or even how to fall so you don't hurt yourself (keep your legs together and skis parallel).  The camera operator seems loathe to change position, so much of the time you are getting the WRONG view of what is gong on.  Oh, but they cover skating.  SKATING?  Since when does a beginner need to know how to skate?  Learn diagonal (classic) technique first.

The second set of videos shows just how apparently boring skiing is because they are constantly overlayed with spinning graphics, cartoons, and naked girls (ok, I made that part up).  The best way to learn how to ski is to watch people who are really good at it, and this video again shows the wrong angles.  Or covers them up.  In the second set, you get 30 seconds on how to stop.  Ridonkulous.  Snowplow technique is the most important thing to learn.  Why?  Because if you can't go down a hill, you will fall repeatedly and become miserable.  And never ski again.  I have the ex-girlfriends to prove it.

Numero Two-O:  They talk about waxing skis here.  If you are a beginner, don't even think about waxing skis, use waxless skis.  If you are skiing in California, you may want to forget about waxing skis forever--the snow temps in California make waxing very difficult.

Numero Three-O:  This film is made in Canada.  Now I love Canada, and I love Canadians.  I even love curling. But they use a bunch of terms about Canadian this and that, and none of it applies to those of us down here in the lower 48.  They misspell ""color.""  :-)

Don't buy this video.  It is truly awful.  If I find a good XC skiing video on amazon I will review it.  For now, you are better off watching some XC skiing on TV or reading a book.

A special note:  I found out a few minutes ago that Roger Ebert has passed away.  Roger wrote the best, and most entertaining reviews ever in my book.  He showed us that reviews can be entertaining as well as informative.  I try to do that in my Amazon reviews, so thank you, Roger.  And Rest in Peace.",1365033600,3,2491,4.459821428571429
8118060,3,B000F6YVQI,"We're returning to cross country skiing after a 12 year hiatus so we thought we'd get this DVD and use it as a refresher to remind us of basic technique before we head out.

The visuals of the various techniques aren't bad at all and did give us what we felt we needed.  In our opinion, the spoken instruction, however, left a little to be desired.  It seemed to us that the instructors, although obviously experts (given their announced qualifications and the way they just ""step into"" the various techniques), didn't really get their explanations of technique across to viewers.  We felt that, if you were a first-timer and looking for something to get you started, this probably isn't the title you should start with, since you might have trouble picking up the necessary details.

For those simply looking to watch skiers (who know what they're doing) demonstrate the various techniques, this DVD works well.  It met our expectations when all we did was watch it rather then listen to it as a learning course.",1359936000,,1013,4.76
8118061,4,B000F6YVQI,"A pretty good effort.  The visual instruction is clear and dialogue is fine.  Some of the camera transitions are a little amateurish, but overall a very helpful tool for learning to cross country ski.",1173312000,2,200,4.852941176470588

8118063,5,B000F6YVQI,"We ordered a large number of xczone's new Learn to Nordic Ski DVD for our ski school.  The feedback to date has been excellent.

The DVD program is ideal for people learning to nordic ski. It starts with a total beginner quick lesson that is super-easy to follow along with, then follows with the Canadian Association of Nordic Ski Instructor's approach to teaching. This is such a progressive approach for the association given that no other organization has published a DVD/manual for public consumption. It is noticable that a lot of effort went into the production.

Part 3 of the DVD finishes off with entry level racing instruction. Clearly a professional production.

The kids, adults and coaches universally agree that the DVD was a good find. The instruction is right on the mark, up-to-date, and not complex.

Afterall this is a beginning DVD.[...]",1165622400,3,858,4.972027972027972
8118064,1,B000F6YVQI,"I bought this DVD to get some idea of the Nordic skiing technique.  The DVD is divided in two: the first bit, a very basic lesson of nordic skking, taught old techniques no longer in use.  The second bit was a pure publicity to the Canadian system, not really explaining anything... I bought other DVD's at the time that were much much useful than this.",1165536000,7,353,4.415384615384616
8118065,5,B000F6YVQI,"I must say, one cool DVD. I mean, first of all, the title says it all, and delivers. Uniquely, the DVD teaches fundamental mechanics and practical stuff. I highly recommend this DVD. I wish I had it when I started skiing a few years ago. It is worth at least the price of a few skiing lessons.",1146614400,8,293,4.157894736842105
8118066,5,B000F6YVQI,"Like most people my cross-country reference section at home consisted of a 1960's guide to skiing by some knicker-wearing-Swede on hickory boards. One for someone who has been away from the sport for years, this DVD an excellent transported my understanding and vision of what Nordic skiing could be, ahead a half century.  Now I am ahead of the game.",1144627200,8,351,4.85
8118067,5,B000F6YVQI,"I've just gotten started skiing this year and I am skiing at an intermediate level. I've taken no lessons, but have watched a few instructional DVDs on the subject. Typical xc skiing videos either show race footage from TV, endless boring striding to elevator music, or half backed contrived drills. This DVD, conversely, conveys real knowledge and instills a sense of movement. The disk demonstrates simple techniques from every angle in slow and stop motion. The beauty of the movements and the scenery is as entertaining as it is informative. I'm ordering the other DVD's right away... can't wait for next winter!",1144108800,17,616,5.049019607843137
