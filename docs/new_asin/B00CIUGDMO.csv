The photography is brilliant, the series is stunning, but stick to trying to catch it on Animal Planet itself, where the show is closed captioned.",1379116800,5,347,5.0

8582169,5,B00CIUGDMO,"A masterpiece of film making.  Another glimpse of the oceans in their most grand. The photography is breath taking. This is the stuff a BIG SCREEN TV is for. For those of us who will never get to scuba dive an hour like this is a dream come true. And the subject matter never gets old. Great for kids, grand kids, and grand parents for that matter!",1523059200,,348,4.1940298507462686

8582172,2,B00CIUGDMO,"The filming is incredible!  Visuals get 5 stars.  Narration, on the other hand is the worst I have ever heard.  0 stars for the narrator.  Sounds like he is narrating a bad adventure movie preview the whole way through.  Who selected the narrator???  I had to mute it to continue watching after about 5 minutes.  Very disappointed, especially because the filming and information is so interesting, just literally couldn't stand his voice!",1425340800,,438,5.0

8582175,4,B00CIUGDMO,"This Animal Planet DVD/BD documentary series is actually Discovery Channels THE MAGIC OF THE BIG BLUE, as it was known in England when it debuted, reportedly in 2011.  It features some amazing photography by nature cinematographer Darek Sepiolo (who also directed), although a fair amount of it is of subjects we've seen in previous documentaries.  But not all: there are enough standout segments to make this show impressive, include rare underwater images of sperm whales sleeping upright, their enormous heads pointed toward the surface like massive floating kelp fronds, encounters with manta rays, pygmy sea horses, and mysterious underwater caves, and a number of segments featuring various species of shark.  The series seven parts each focus on one continents ocean life, although in the US only six segments were broadcast - this Animal Planet DVD/BD set includes the episode that wasn't broadcast here (it was evidently shown in Europe as it is included on the European release of THE MAGIC OF THE BIG BLUE, not as an extra).  This segment covers ANTARCTICA and features an especially interesting segment involving an encounter with a curious leopard seal; as well as including a notable making-of segment).  Richard Lintern narrated the British series (including the ANTARCTICA segment included here), but not the US version, even though he is credited on the Animal Planet DVD/BD box credits Lintern, which leads American viewers to think hes responsible for the awful narration on the six episodes shown on Animal Planet.  WILD DEEP is, in fact, narrated by American actor and voice-over artist Dave Fennoy (perhaps best known as the voice of the Hulu website) with a distracting tendency to speak in an annoying sing-song enthusiasm as if hes narrating a story to a group of children, or doing voice-over for a radio commercial, much to this series detriment.  Maybe Ive just become used to the Attenboroughs and the Linterns; not that I feel proper documentaries require a British accent, but try as I might I found Fennoys style of very deliberate and almost mechanical enunciation very unlikable in this context.  I like Fennoys work elsewhere but I not here; he strives to be dramatic in places where it's not needed.  The narration script also seemed to be overly simplistic and unnecessarily dramatic, making one long for the more detailed data conveyed on BBC documentary series.  The shows score is a library compilation taken from the work of eleven composers, includes the likes of Debbie Wiseman, Ian Hughes, Chris Blackwell, and others, taken from a variety of sources coordinated by music supervisor Rafal Bryll.  It works very well and gives the show an impressive drive and compelling atmosphere.",1394928000,,2725,5.156462585034014
8582176,5,B00CIUGDMO,I love it! Beautiful colors and the filming is amazing. Can't get enough of it. Price was right. good stuff,1393804800,,107,4.4
8582177,3,B00CIUGDMO,"After viewing a large part of this DVD series, I have good news and bad news.  The good news is that the photography and imagery is simply stunning. The intense colors and beautiful vistas are breathtaking and the coverage of the animals contained within the oceans is detailed and thorough.

Now the bad news - the narration.  The DVD package says that the narrator is Richard Lintern, who, it turns out, appears to be a British actor.  In my opinion, the narration ruins this series.  The narrator's voice is too deep and has very little inflection.  While you are sitting enjoying amazing scenery, each time the narrator speaks you are literally startled from your seat by the incongruent nature of the tonality of the narrator's voice when compared with the scenery.

Part of the problem here is that other nature documentaries - especially those produced by BBC - have such wonderful (and almost iconic) narration that they are a hard act to follow.  Once you've heard David Attenborough and Tilda Swinton narrate a nature documentary, there simply is no comparison.

So, if you can manage to stand the narrator, go ahead and try this one out.  But if you are used to the serene voice of the BBC nature series, then I would skip this one.",1385769600,2,1243,4.712962962962963
