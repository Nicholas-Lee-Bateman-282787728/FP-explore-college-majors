Taaj, the instructor, talks you through the moves slowly at first, then speeds up. She counts out each move in paused broken beats a few times the ""rounds out"" the moves to what they should be. She also does the moves 1/4 - 1/2 speed and gradually builds speed. Because of the semi-squat possition you are always in during belly dance, it is a great glute, thigh, core workout! I totally felt it during the workout and the next day.

I loved the belly dance workout so much that I decided to try another belly dance workout. The others I have tried went WAY too fast. They took all the moves at full speed, then too soon were adding on moves in combination! I don't know how they could call themselves ""beginner?"" Belly Dance Basics IS a beginner workout/introduction to belly dance. I highly recomend it to someone looking for an alternative workout for the lower body.",1242432000,4,1003,4.572222222222222
8044493,5,B00070M3J4,"The break-down format of this DVD is one of the things that makes it so great.  It breaks down moves - smooth, percussive, travelling steps, and so on, making it easier to focus on a particular type of move.  There is a warm-up and cool down, a performance piece in the end, and some other great tips, tools, moves, and techniques to improve belly dancers at any skill level.  For beginners, each move is broken down and through the power of repitition and easy explanations, you'll have it down in no time!  I have this DVD and have used it for a few years as a regular exercise and just for fun!  Because of the types of moves belly dance uses, this is a great DVD additional to any dancer's collection!  At about an hour in length, it's the perfect length for nap time, a quick work-out, or just about any time in your day!",1183593600,7,826,4.296774193548387
