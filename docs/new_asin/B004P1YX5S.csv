8437417,5,B004P1YX5S,"I do not understand how the producers can obtain such beautiful video images and sound in an outdoor venue such as Schonbrunn, however this program is lovely as any recorded in a concert hall.  The Weiner Philharmoniker was superb.  The selections were excellently performed.  The Mussorkgsky ""pictures at an exhibition"" was a good as any I have heard.  A great program.",1447200000,,370,5.016393442622951
8437418,5,B004P1YX5S,I had a wonderful pleasure of Valery Gergiev performance with The Vienna Orchestra.  I had to have this one for my library.  This is a great piece to have with the  dancers and background scenes.  Modest Mussorgsy Picturesat an Exhibitions is TOPS.  BRAVO,1419552000,,255,4.837209302325581

8437420,5,B004P1YX5S,"I've never written a review of a review before, but this listing has me confused.

One writer says this is NOT the Gergiev while the other praises Gergiev's Pictures at an Exhibition.

So which is it, AMAZON?

Exactly WHAT is on this disc and WHO is conducting?",1347408000,,261,4.51063829787234

Please note that this review has been correctly placed by Amazon under the 2010 Summer Concert with Welser-Most conducting and also wrongly placed under the 2011 Summer Concert with Gergiev conducting.
This is not an unusual problem with Amazon where there are similar titles and is beyond the control of reviewers.
Please be patient therefore - however, you may also be interested in the Welser-Most concert with the same overall title which is excellent.

...................................................

The theme of this 2010 concert, conducted at the last minute by Welser-Most, is 'Moon, Planets, Stars' and was originally conceived by Ozawa. When he became indisposed due to ill health Welser-Most took over the whole program and that is what we see on this disc.

The intention was obviously to create a spectacular musical and visual event and this is established right from the start with the VPO on top form with a sparkling and powerful rendition of `Main Title' from Star Wars. Meanwhile the camera swoops in over the massed crowds thronging among the sweeping expanses of gardens as if on a spaceship and finally focusses in on the orchestra playing inside a space-age see-through auditorium in front of the palace.

After this we hear what amounts to a light music concert made up of favourites which fit the general theme. All of these are played with consummate skill by the orchestra and with evident good humour from the conductor starting with Josef Strauss's Music of the Spheres waltz. The `star' pianist, Yefim Bronfman, then rises up seated at the piano on a stage lift from below and surrounded by smoke, an amusing entrance. From then however, we get to experience a seriously fine performance of Liszt's Piano Concerto 2 and a Paganini etude encore. This is indeed a starry pair of performances.

The concert continues with two more theme items from the Star Wars complete with more swirling smoke and featuring sweeping strings and resplendent brass as heard in the opening `Main Title'. This leads into Lanner's Evening Stars waltz and Nicolai's Moonrise from The Merry Wives complete with female chorus. These are followed by a stirring performance of Mars from Holt's Planets Suite. The concert finishes with 3 `encores' - Schumann's `Dreams', Johann Strauss's Vienna Blood waltz and finally Josef Strauss's `On Holiday' polka.

The imaging throughout captures the celebratory aspect of the occasion and provides crisp imaging and good colour. The sound is excellent and presented in both DTS 5.0 and stereo.

This is a joyous occasion and the recording fully captures this `gala' type of evening concert. It seems to me to be a totally successful disc and one that should delight future purchasers. For these reasons it seems only reasonable to rate it with a well earned 5 stars thus concluding the theme of the event with an appropriately starry grade!",1344643200,,2899,5.10337552742616
8437422,4,B004P1YX5S,"Maestro Gergiev is unquestionably one of the all-time great conductors.  His interpretation of the ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" is the best I've ever heard. The only drawback to the production of the recording was the inclusion of ballet vignettes to the 'Pictures'.  Although the dancers were first rate their presence was intrusive.  I would have preferred seeing more Gergiev instead.",1334016000,2,386,5.4
