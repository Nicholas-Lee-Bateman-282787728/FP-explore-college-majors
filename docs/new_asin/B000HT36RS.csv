She stopped what she was doing, stood in front of the monitor and dances her little heart out. She had to watch it three times in a row!",1180656000,,292,4.051724137931035
2640663,4,B000HT36RS,"ThingamaKid Toons' series for kids aged two to five kicks off with Toddler Toons, Action Bible, and Christmas Toons, all of which come packaged with a DVD and CD. The DVD contains animated ""toons"" singing children's songs and provides a karaoke version of all the songs to help the kids sing along. The DVD also has three educational shorts and a Spanish option so kids can learn songs in another language.

The Toddler Toons shorts cover shapes, colors, and counting to ten. They last up to 30 seconds, so they don't lose the toddler's attention. The DVD plays great on a TV/DVD player, but doesn't auto-run when using it in a computer (not all parents know how to get a DVD going or have the right software to run it). The DVD run time is about 25 minutes. Included songs:

* Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes

* The Butterfly Song

* The Wheels on the Bus

* Mary Had A Little Lamb

* Pop! Goes The Weasel!

* This Old Man

* The Bear Went Over the Mountain

* Eensy, Weensy Spider

* Old MacDonald

* Alphabet Animals (the A-B-C Song)

The CD comes with tunes for listening on the go or at home. It holds the same songs as those on the DVD, plus five extras including ""The Muffin Man,"" ""Roll Over,"" and ""Baa, Baa Black Sheep."" The CD also provides split track versions of the songs.

Our family toddler, a three-year-old, watched the DVD and asked for replays until told it was time to stop watching TV. He got up and danced and sang along when he knew the songs. It's sure to please toddlers who like music, singing, and dancing. Parents can help sing along as most of the songs are classic with a couple of unknowns for them to learn.

The box comes with song lyrics and the karaoke version displays lyrics as they're sung. More ThingamaKid titles are planned for 2007. The products seel for a great price considering they come with a CD and DVD plus karaoke and split track versions.",1161216000,9,1888,4.403458213256484
2640665,5,B000HT36RS,"I had been looking for a sing along DVD that both of my kids would like and this far surpassed my expectations.  My 1 year old was dancing the minute it started and when the first song ended my 4 year old was asking ""what song is next""?  They were glued to the TV from start to finish.  What is nice about this DVD is that the kids see the story with the animation, as opposed to just watching kids sing.  That way they get to know what the song is all about.  Get this DVD and the others offered by Thingamakid.  You won't be dissapointed!",1160611200,6,540,4.047169811320755

I have to take it away from her or else she would watch it all night! It's fun as well as educational. The ""shape family"" is a nice addition.",1298419200,,265,3.925925925925926
