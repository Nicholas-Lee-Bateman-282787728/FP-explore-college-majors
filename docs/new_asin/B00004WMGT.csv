7925626,5,B00004WMGT,"The previous reviewer is on the money. This is a very entertaining, well-made account of the Sid Caesar comedy shows during the ""Golden Age"" of live TV. The sketches included and discussed are as funny as anyting on TV today, and given the writers, often clever and literate. The interviews (40-50 years later) describing the ""typical"" work week for the writers and performers of the show are entertaining and illuminating.

The DVD has a brief interview in which Woody Allen describes a work session in which he refused to ""write comedy in the nude."" There's an additional sketch with Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca that's a parody of an early silent movie short. You can also read the original script of the sketch for ""Progress Hornsby"" showing all the cuts and additions. Wonderful.",1182902400,2,783,4.887218045112782
