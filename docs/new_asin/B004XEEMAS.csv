8446876,5,B004XEEMAS,"Now, I loved American Grindhouse! Speaks on how it got started on 42'nd street up in NY, thanks you New York, if if we didn't have them, we would be without greats such as HG. Lewis, Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez and many other old directors that I did not mention, cause that's for you too find, part of the fun. As for Red, White and Blue. I am highly looking forward to it, despite some bad reviews, but this is certainly one of those sets worth the cost of just one either of these DVD's, so buy this and save money for more Flicks man...
