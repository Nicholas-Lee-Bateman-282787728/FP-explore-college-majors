1780390,3,B00006JDRI,"On the surface, this movie had everything
it takes to score a hit (minus a Grade-A cast).
However it missed the marked by a longshot.
It's obvious that the writers invested much
effort into creating an original storyline.....
and they succeeded. However, their creative ideas
did not transfer well into the script.  The result
is a collosal mess of confusion.

It is VERY difficult to follow. Everyone is implicated
in everything. The victims are the perpetraters. The
Good people are the Bad People.  The past is the
future and the future is the present. More talented
writers could have parlayed these contradictions into
an ecxiting suspense thriller. Unfortunatly, it appears that
talent,in general, was in  short supply across the board.

The action is slightly better, but not by much. The most
ridiculous thing about this movie is that the main character (kevin)
can't fight. He gets beaten up in every fight sequence and
even gets killed at the end. (And he's supposed to be the
star/hero?) His performance of the fight choreography is blooper-reel quality at best.
To save money, the producers could have
pulled any 5 year old off the playground
and gotten a more effective performance. The other actors are convincing,
but Kevin should have had PUNK tatooed across his forehead.

In spite of my negativity regarding this film, I still give
it a 3, based on a great story IDEA, and some really good
fight scenes with the elusive female agent at the end.",1116806400,4,1462,4.898785425101215
1780391,5,B00006JDRI,"If you love action, Europe and fast paced stories, this one is for you. If not, then take a pass. Much like Nikita, Bourne Identity and other great Euro thrillers Soul Assassin is not as formulaic as most American action films and I really enjoyed the fresh new actors from Holland (I assume). Skeet and Kristy were good, but Kristy should have been in the movie more. A fault of an otherwise passable script. Nothing too special there, but the movie has a unique view. A very blue view. Personally I liked it. Along with the sound, which is loud and great. The story was confusing at times, then it all makes sense in the end. No spoilers here, but I was definitely surprised by the final events. I probably should give the film a 4/5 but because of the end I have to give it a 5/5.",1046390400,5,783,4.297297297297297
1780392,4,B00006JDRI,"The plot, while at times are to see, is there.  I would say that the majority of the scenes that attempted emotional impact were fufilled as a result of pretty good acting.  The DVD has some other cool stuff on it. I will admit though that the visuals, while interesting, were a bit nausiating.  A lot of quick, extreme camera movement.  The blue filter was very appropriate.  There is a screen flashing technique that the director overused a bit.
Good action movie to see once or twice.  Very fufulling ending, if you followed the plot...",1042329600,4,539,4.621052631578947
1780393,5,B00006JDRI,"I rented and then bought this DVD. It is different and has an attitude. Off beat locale and happenings...a bicycle chase in Amsterdam, a sniper shootout on the canal and lots of quick cuts and Hi Tech look and feel. The story is interesting as well...betrayal by a ""father figure"".
I have read some negative reviews of this movie by uptight ""filmees"". Get a life!! They over analyze all of the things about the movie that are actually fun....the pacing, the styized look, the blue filter....that's what is fun. Get your nose out of obscure and boring films and enjoy life.",1041292800,8,572,4.673267326732673
1780394,2,B00006JDRI,"This film could have been much better.  The Plot actually tried to be intelligent but failed miserably.  While the story was unique but it was simply put together so badly half the time you were like what the hell is going on.  Even when the film tries to explain it at the end it still does a super poor job.
The action was simply laughable since you couldn't see what was going on due to the purposely shaky filming to make the action look like it was in your seat.  It was not a good idea because unless you have an exciting plot and well explained action is not needed.  But the action was horrible and plot was explained at a D-.
Good points: attempt at a good story
Bad points: poor coreography, poor production of action sequences
worst points: boring film due to bad action sequences and poor  story telling
Overall movie grade D+",1038096000,5,838,4.374193548387097
1780395,4,B00006JDRI,"This indie from the Netherlands, with various film techniques from fast editing to fast music, could be a pleasant surprise to viewers who got fed up with Hollywood's cliches when it comes to suspense and action. Of course the movie would have been even better with a bigger budget for a stronger cast, yet I find it all in all enjoyable.
There's nothing quite new with the plot (""The Replacement Killers"" and ""The Bourne Identity"" being two best in this genre lately) but it still manages to keep you guessing at least half way through. Skeet Ulrich is Kevin Burke, a rising star in an international bank in Rotterdam, working as security agent under his surrogate father and mentor, bank director Karl Jorgensen (Derek de Lint). Just when Kevin prepares to propose to a broker he's deeply in love with, the beautiful Rosalind Bremmond (Katherine Lang), her life is cut short by an assassin's bullet. As Kevin is furiously driven to seek revenge, his investigation into Rosalind's death not only reveals a dark facet of her life, it also drags him into a web of corporate espionage and assassination involving some agents from Interpol and numerous unidentified enemies. While working his way out of this dangerous maze, Kevin confronts with another mysterious beauty, Tessa Jansen (Kristy Swanson), who might well give him the ultimate answer to his deadliest question...
Conclusion: 4 stars, 1 to the cast (especially Derek de Lint), and 3 to the film makers in terms of editing and cinematography (some sexy scenes from the streets of Rotterdam are really worth checking out). One side note: I was a little bit curious about ""some sexuality"" under the R rating box. Turned out it didn't involve Kristy Swanson, just Katherine Lang. But it was good anyway.",1036886400,10,1759,4.925925925925926
1780396,1,B00006JDRI,"Don't let my blurb scare you off. This isn't the worst movie ever made in any sense. However it is very un-American in its form. It isn't done that well at times and the plot is difficult to follow. Not to mention that Skeet Ulrich pulls off the worst performance I have seen all year. I know he was never great but he was never this bad. I mean his performance here is plain bad. I felt that there were times when I was supposed to know what was going on and I just didn't. I commend them for the style though. The fast music, the fast filming here and there. this film seems like a Dutch mix of THE BOURNE IDENTITY, any Jerry Bruckheimer movie, and RUN LOLA RUN. Worth a watch on a rainy day.",1036195200,2,694,4.072992700729927
1780397,5,B00006JDRI,"This is an excellent production.  Labelled by audiences as both an Indy film and foriegn, it had a premiere party both in the US and in the Netherlands.  The movie itself was very well done.  The cast was well picked out but I have to say that the person that stands out most in this feature is Derek de Lint.  The two names displayed on the dvd cover were good but I could see others playing the role and making it work.  DdL though? I am used to seeing him as a good guy, what with his work on the series Poltergeist: The Legacy, but he brought a suprising element to the man that creates his very own brand of killers.  I'd recommend this movie to anyone, it's a great piece to see!",1034208000,2,685,4.112781954887218
1780418,4,B00006JDRI,"Worth the Watch for Entertainment, not poorly made, good acting for the most part. A fast movie, really liked it",1508544000,,112,4.65

1780420,3,B00006JDRI,"It's an intriguing story, generally well-acted, but the plot depends on too many improbable behaviors, such as police not identifying themselves as such in a gun fight, purposeless murder, or the protagonist being blind to threats, even though observation and assessment are his specialty. I guess those might be called plot holes. Oh, and there's a flashing light effect that's used during some action sequences and other points, sort of an artificial tension app, as if the shaky cam wasn't enough. I sure hope it doesn't catch on.",1507852800,2,533,5.068181818181818

1780422,4,B00006JDRI,"Very entertaining. Good video and audio (streaming) quality, especially for 2002 movie without famous actors. Most of the acting was quite good, tho' lesser characters were clearly less talented too. Interesting and creative plot. I'd watch it again without even having my arm twisted, :), as long as I was in the mood for wanton murder, blood, violence and nudity, ;).",1507075200,2,369,5.065573770491803
1780423,5,B00006JDRI,I liked that the picture was 16:9. I liked the story. I liked the action and violence. There was several fantastic chase scenes. There was lots of shooting. There was plenty of punching and kicking. I appreciate Amazon Prime making another recommendation that pleased me.,1505606400,,271,5.044444444444444

1780425,5,B00006JDRI,".... and he didn't fail me in this movie.  There is something very special about him and his movies are worth seeking out and watching.  This reminds me of the later Bourne movies, strange stuff that we are beginning to accept as ""normal"" in the world of big business and world intrigue.  I think Skeet often is ahead of his time and his movies need a re-release to pick up on his star ability.  I recommend the movie, though it may be hard to find, I gather it is no longer being produced for sale.  I bought my DVD second-hand, I'm glad I did.  It will become part of my library devoted to Skeet Ulrich.  There aren't many stars I now follow.  I wish there were more films with Skeet, my library would be a lot bigger.",1267315200,3,720,4.204379562043796
1780426,5,B00006JDRI,"Derek de Lint is an excellent actor and I'd watch him read the phone book on DVD.  So, personal fan-based bias notwithstanding, this movie was thoroughly enjoyable, well-acted, and worth watching again.  It's as good as ""Bourne Identity,"" IMHO.",1266624000,2,244,5.230769230769231
1780427,2,B00006JDRI,"SOUL ASSASSIN could have been a fairly entertaining little thriller.  It has a complex plot with lots of twists and false leads, and some skillful performances from supporting players Rena Owen and Derek De Lint.  However, director Laurence Malkin decided to film 90 percent of it with a blue filter; erratic MTV-style choppy scenes and focused very little on the script or its performers.  Hence, all we get is a muddled tale of corporate deception and murder.  The use of the blue screen and its chaotic camerawork serves only to make the film more annoying than entertaining.  Skeet Ulrich is lost in the miasmic mess and the original Buffy (Kristy Swanson) just floats around with a gun in her hand most of the movie.  A potentially good movie murdered by its execution.",1125532800,3,774,4.825757575757576

7970264,2,B00006JDRI,"Skeet Ulrich's performance was stilted. Most of the supporting cast did a good job, but when Ulrich would start talking it was a bit grating. The transition scenes of 4x speed traffic was an interesting throwback to the 80's that I am not sure was needed. It didn't help anything. All in all, an interesting story that if you can get past Ulrich's performance and some of the editing/directorial decisions, make a workable for an afternoon show.",1510272000,,445,4.792207792207792
