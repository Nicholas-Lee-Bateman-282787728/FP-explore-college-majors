However, I did purchase it from another site and it was perfect. So I already did a review on this disc which you already printed. So don't print this statement. Thank you and keep up the great customer service!!.",1309219200,,351,4.176470588235294

7865366,2,6304243340,"I saw this one on VHS many moons ago. A good friend of mine rented this one. He and I, and his wife, sat down for a bit of entertainment on a quiet friday night. I had seen the first F.O.D. That one was OK, it killed some  time. This one must have been out-takes from the first one. I could hardly  keep my eyes open. My friends wife took a nap about half way through the  tape. Need I say more ? Don't waste you time and money on this  ""Sleeper"".Watch the first one again. Trust me.",957052800,,483,3.8979591836734695
7865367,1,6304243340,"I personally think that this FOD, FOD II, was the most disapointing FOD as of yet, even Dr. Francis B. Gross thought of this FOD to be the more dissapointing before dying after his more of a much deadlier comback Faces  Of Death film in the III'rd release. The only thing about FOD II I did not  like was that it barely has real good footage of the study of death, more  of in good words than good footage",946425600,,405,4.10126582278481
