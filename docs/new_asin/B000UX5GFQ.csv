2926888,4,B000UX5GFQ,"If you liked the first one, Long Way Down won't disappoint you. I couldn't watch it on TV when it came out, as I was overseas, so I ordered the DVD as soon as I could. The show is fun, eyeopening and flows really well. I found out things about Africa I would have never otherwise had the chance to. Love the bikes, love the boyish humor, and love the positive message of this trip. The only little bone that I would pick with it all is that it's got a little too 'branded', too 'commercially focused', but that is understandable in this day and age, I guess.

The chemistry between Charlie and Ewan feels a little strained with Eve joining the trip, and I'd be curious to find out if they are still as good friends as they were after the first trip.

The highlight of the show is Ewan's white shoes!

I hope they will make Long Way Up (from Patagonia to Nova Scotia)....Man! KTM must be kicking themselves.",1226880000,3,906,4.286549707602339
2926889,4,B000UX5GFQ,"I bumped into the LWD guys while they were filming this series in the middle of the Zambia bush. Charlie Boorman and Claudio stopped to chat and we shared stories, tips and took the piss out of each other's bikes - much like any British biker does at a UK motorway service station - except we were in the middle of Africa.  Quite surreal in a way.  My only criticism of the LWD is its on a bit of rushed production schedule.  Even by their own admission they missed so much of the ""off beaten track"" beauty of Africa. For instance, I know they must have charged passed the South Luangwa valley (quite possibly Africa's best game reserve) because Mrs McG can't ride off road. What a waste. Who brings the missus on a boys only motorcycle adventure anyway?  That said, the DVD is a great reminder for me of the incredible places I saw and the wonderful people I met - even if they were riding BMWs instead of KTMs!!",1226448000,,913,4.321637426900585
2926890,5,B000UX5GFQ,"I was a bit apprehensive about purchasing this series without seeing it, and having read reviews that this wasn't as good as Long Way Round. I absolutely loved the first series and didn't want to be dissapointed but let me tell you, this series was just as good as the first. The idea is seeing places that one would never think of going to to, and after seeing the places Ewan and Charley went (i.e. Lybia, Ruwanda) I was not dissapointed.
It was not the same as the first series to be sure, but that is ok. No second is like the first, and it had new things to see and experience, although admittedly when they had to absolutely fly through Tunisia, Lybia, and Egypt it was a bit dissapointing but still fun to watch.
I was also intriugued by the dynamic Ewan's wife, Eve, made on the trip for the 10 days she was there. I thought it would be lame but it turned out that she was a real sweet addition to the trip so it was a good surprise.
 Not as many river crossings as the in the first one and more civilization than the first as well (not as many spans between cities I mean) but it was fantastic. Good show to watch with a buddy who also likes bikes, or if you don't like bikes, just an entertaining show to watch. :)",1224892800,2,1224,4.1645569620253164
2926891,5,B000UX5GFQ,"I watched ""Long Way Round"" but enjoyed this one even more. The footage of travel through Africa is beautifully done and I give high praise to Claudio and the other photographers.  You can tell that Ewan and Charley are truly moved by their surroundings and the wonderful African people. They really didn't want to stop this journey. In this film you will see Roman ruins,Victoria Falls, Ugandan gorillas, hippos, elephants, and many more African animals. After watching this film, you will want to travel to Africa and also donate to Unicef. It will make you happy and have you grinning from ear to ear. I recommend it highly.",1223769600,13,626,4.796296296296297
2926892,4,B000UX5GFQ,"I watched the Long Way Round and really enjoyed the first outing with Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman. I was thrilled with the announcement that they would be doing it again! If you enjoyed Long Way Round, you will enjoy Long Way Down.

I gave Long Way Down 4 stars for 2 reasons -- it felt rushed and it only clocked in 6 episodes when Long Way Round had 10 episodes and wasn't as rushed. Secondly, I wasn't all that thrilled with Mrs. McGregor joining the boys in Malawi. Do not get me wrong, I love Ewan and his wife seems like such a doll! But for me, the Long Way series is about Ewan and Charley. I felt a little weird with the addition of Ewan's wife, even if it was only for 2 weeks. Despite some of my ""issues"" with the Long Way Down -- I do recommend it if you loved Long Way Round. It's a great addition to the Long Way series (let's hope they do a Long Way Up!).",1197849600,9,876,4.0344827586206895
2926893,5,B000UX5GFQ,"If you enjoyed Long Way Round, you'll enjoy Long Way Down, the second video in the series by Ewan McGregor and Charlie Boorman.

Boorman also has a video out covering his Dakar race attempt and this is what prompted Ewan and Charlie to do the LWD Trip down through Africa.  The Dakar video is pretty intense and focused down and in on the race course, and the spectacle of the race.

LWD strikes a good balance between riding and sightseeing/sidetrips, again similar in style to Long Way Round.  A bit more detail in this one on trip planning, logistics, supplies, and prep.

BTW, the BMW GS bikes appear to do incredibly well for the level of punishment they take -- chewing up a few shocks as you might expect, but that's about it for repairs (at least from what they show in the video).",1197417600,6,789,4.451388888888889
2926894,4,B000UX5GFQ,"Let me get past comparisons with the first program LongWay Round. This was shorter, but with better production values, warmer, more family, more people in the visited countries.

The second and third in the series of five shows were interesting for a number of reasons. 1. They displayed how hard it is to travel in Africa because of the dicey politics. 2. Weather can be really terrible and exhausting for bikers. 3. The inclusion of Ewan's wife Ev in the planning and preparation was a model of how to be inclusive, without prejudice even though the threat of more than one personal storm was always on the horizon. The second and third shows were rough because of the rushed feeling, the complaining, and strange video editing. They could have spent more film time at the Moto Guzzi plant and little was said or done about the historical things in Europe and Italy specifically.

Aside from that, when they had the time to do a little tourism or take shots of the background, it was great. The fourth, fifth, and sixth shows were more relaxed and more fun. The people they met, the places they visited, the roads, all made for a much nicer trip than LongWay Round. Ev's riding, even though it made Charlie feel like a fifth wheel, was a great promo for motorcycling in general. Girls, it's time to ride with your guys!",1197244800,3,1321,4.617021276595745
2926895,4,B000UX5GFQ,"I think by Ewan's own comments `this trip was rushed'. Although it brings together the same crew as the much better 'Wrong way round' series the experience is lessoned by the constant need to get from John O Groats (most Northern point of mainland UK) to Cape Town within the three months allowed due to Ewan's movie commitments. The strain this puts on the group is great to watch if you enjoy `group dynamics' but a little annoying when all you really want to see is the countries and the people.
However it does have its moments, the ruins in Libya are an amazing undiscovered wonder of the world and always the chance encounters unplanned but captured brilliantly by having those always present cameras. The series relaxes and improves as they travel further.
There is nothing unique in what they are doing, but their openness and willingness to explore and accept what they see and learn is refreshing as a reminder to those of us who have travelled in a similar way.
All in all worth buying and enjoyable, but the first series Wrong Way Round still ranks as one of the best motorcycle odyssey shows out there. Buy that as well then cancel a whole weekend because you'll not want to stop watching them. I hope they release some extras with this DVD not broadcast by the BBC here in the UK.",1195776000,19,1294,4.55793991416309

2926920,3,B000UX5GFQ,"Similar to their Long Way Round show.
Too much of them talking, too much complaining about how hard it is... on their fully sponsored brand new bikes with support crew.
But still enjoyable to watch if you are familiar with the dozens of other poor riders who are doing the same thing with no sponsors or support crew.
It is well filmed as should be expected and may appeal more to non-riders that might not watch a video of the real adventure riders.
The stars do draw in the paying customers",1443312000,,492,4.417582417582418

They were rushed and unhappy.  Then, Ewen's wife Ev ruined the film with her intrusive presence. If she had been a passionate biker who joined the group, it would have made sense, but she had never ridden before and declared her hated for motorcycles. She was ""jealous"" so she insinuated herself into the plan. It didn't fit, it was awkward and unpleasant. It would be fun to watch another one with Claudio and Charlie (no Ev).",1429747200,,590,4.462962962962963

They were so rushed to get from point A to point B every day, there were a bare miniumn interactions with the locals or to see the sights.  Seriously, how do you ride past the Matterhorn without even taking a few minutes for a photo opportunity?  Early in episode one Ewan talks about his dad and wife joining him for a few days during the trip, I knew that would bring tension to the team.  I don't understand why they felt it was necessary to insert themselves  into the trip.  LWD truly did not have the magical ingredients that  LWR had.  I only give it two stars instead of one star because by the last two episodes It felt like LWR once again.  If possible, save your money and watch it on Netflix.",1427241600,,764,4.213793103448276

I've watched it a few times and I feel like that's what is needed if you're going to really get into this film.

It is more of a ""made for television"" movie than a ""documentary of an experience"". Ewan McGregor comes across as a self-consumed Hollywood celeb.... it is all about me.... Instead of two friends travelling he has his dad and brother join for awhile and then, beyond belief, has his wife who has never even ridden a motorcycle come along for part of the trip and make it a ""celeb visits the poor people"" trip.

Maybe it's just that these two men are very boring, and not even a trip to Africa could make them interesting. As actors, they desperately needed writers, because left to their own devices, they don't have much to say except for swearing. It dawns on Mcgregor, when the two are in Rwanda, that maybe they should have done some research beforehand so they would have some inkling of the history of the countries and could, say, ask intelligent questions.

Long Way Down was much better than Long Way Round, mainly because of the crew's lessons learned from Long Way Round, and Charley's excursion in the Dakar rally. They equipped themselves more effectively with customized SUV chase vehicles, and a revised loadout for their BMW GS1200 Adventure bikes. It also helped they didn't have to pack so much cold weather gear from what I could tell. Their trip through Europe and Northern Africa was a bit rushed based on their schedule, I would have liked to see them explore more of Egypt. There are 10 episodes, which was an improvement over Long Way Round. Eva, Ewan's wife, is shown learning to ride a bike, and tagged along for a portion of the journey towards the end. Although it must have been an exciting adventure for her, I felt she was just a third wheel in the whole scheme of things.

Sitting in the theatre, the idea of riding bikes from the top of Scotland to the toe of Africa seemed absolutely mental, and yet completely sane, all at the same time.  Two years later, I had the privilege of meeting Charley as he toured the UK to talk about his adventures both with Ewan on LWR and LWD, at the Dakar, and beyond.  When I finally got this DVD, I cruised through the first disc in one night.  Charley and Ewan's adventures and the spirit embodied in them are absolutely contagious.  I spent most of the video thinking, 'I want to do this.  I really want to do this.'  There is something to be said for experiencing the world on the back of a bike as opposed to in a car - it's more organic.  And Charley and Ewan bring that feeling to the viewer in every episode.  You almost feel like a ninth member of the team.  Absolutely fantastic series and well worth the purchase!",1299283200,5,1002,4.281914893617022

Very interesting to see all the countries they rode through on their journey down through Africa. A real 'eye-opener' too for those of us who know little about these African countries. A great value for money dvd set.  Thoroughly recommend to biking enthusiasts but this series would appeal to all types.

The camera man and the truck teams are there too but ethier behind the scene or on thier own adventure yet part of the story and the reason I get to see and share McGregor and Boormans' adventrure on film.

Although both of the guys can be whiny at times and surprised at all of the help they receive even when nothing really goes right, the fact that the cameras were there probably helped a good deal. That said, it's still a wonderful story of humans helping other humans, even when there are language barriers and huge problems. I saw this a while ago and enjoyed it, but cannot remember most of the details...
it is funny, though, Ewan and Charley go to Tunisia to take pictures where George Lucas filmed the first Star Wars movies, and there's a few newer Star Wars posters up but all of the SW fans are so excited to be there, they don't recognize the new Obi-Wan!",1295395200,,824,4.427631578947368

Also Ewan has long been one of my favorite actors and seeing a bit of the ""real"" Ewan McGregor is always a treat.

I recommend this to anyone interested in adventure, traveling, or just curious about other countries but, like me, don't have the finances to actually travel to them. Ewan and Charlie's rapport make it even more entertaining.

I do agree that Ewan's wife, Eve, put Ewan into the awkward position of supporting her coming along when she showed an interest in doing so. From his previous experience, he KNEW what they were probably looking at and had to be worried about how Eve would fare, as from what I understand, she had never ridden a bike prior to practicing for this trip. I'm a woman, and I've got to think that if I took an interest in learning to ride a motorcycle because my man enjoyed it so much and I wanted to be able to do that with him, I wouldn't pick such an arduous and potentially dangerous trip for my first major trip. Fortunately, they appear to have ended up enjoying even that part of the trip, and what Eve brought to it, so in the end it did nothing to ruin it for me.",1290816000,,1366,4.352941176470588

Although this trip did not really suck me into the experience as much as Long Way Round, it was an exciting trip to watch.  There was definitely more of the support crew here as opposed to the first trip.  This both hindered and helped them.  I love the whole ambiance of the three (can't forget Claudio, the cameraman) of them going off on their own and exploring the continent and its people.  Yet on the other hand, I did enjoy having the chance to see how the support crew handled things also.  Eve joined them for a bit of the journey and subtly changed the dynamics while she was there. However I did not find her to be too intrusive.  When she did leave, I found myself enjoying the byplay between the two boys even more.  The scenery and people were so rich in color and life.  It made me long for a chance to take an adventure like this.  I would recommend this for anyone who likes adventure but just cannot afford the trip.

Much of the dialog and visuals are recorded conversations and comments from helmet mounted cameras and microphones and so are at times muffled, but the gist of what they are saying and the accompanying images are more than explanatory. Their well recorded encounters with Rawandan holocaust survivors and other nationals as they travel are moving and powerful in many cases.

2927037,4,B000UX5GFQ,"Ewan and Charlie have once again captured so much of what makes motorcycle adventure touring so enticing: far off locales, amazing scenery and video footage, packed and highly capable motorcycles, language barriers crossed by handshakes, smiles and a little money, on-road repairs, desolate camping sites, danger that can be quite up close and personal, and an all-together obvious camaraderie and enjoyment of the entire venture! Sure they had project and support vehicles, and they were never completely isolated from assistance, but in this age of electronic and digital communication, who isn't? I think the ease of communication was exemplified when Ewan's kickstand kill switch was broken in a tumble, and the bike wouldn't go into gear. Since they had no replacement parts, and no BMW mechanics nearby, Ewan placed a call to a European BMW tech who walked him through how to re-wire it and bypass the kill switch...simple!

The cultural shifts from one country to another were significant, and the poverty as well as the ravages of war crossed many international borders. As UNICEF representatives, I think Charlie and Ewan's presence at several orphanages along their route told stories about the country and the kids we'd never have known about otherwise. The deprivations were astounding, and should all make us feel especially blessed to live in the relative safety and abundance in the free countries we're in. Both my wife and I vicariously enjoyed the lengthy and demanding travels our friends were on, and more than once I wished to be able to join these fellas on their amazing trips. Bravo to Charlie and Ewan for sharing their journeys with us!",1252886400,,1662,5.110294117647059
2927038,4,B000UX5GFQ,"Long Way Round and Race to Dakar had a certain vibe. I was *so* looking forward to seeing that vibe again in Long Way Down. It was mostly there, but there were three major detractors:

1. Less focus on food and eating and what they were really thinking and doing, and what Claudio was doing, and their arguments, etc. (those appear to have been edited out or not filmed).
2. Ewan was all clean-shaven the whole time and more self- and power-conscious. I hope he can get back to how he was before, guess that's not probably possible. I missed his self-immolation in the trip from the first one.
3. Eve: I agree with an earlier poster that as a woman I am not criticising based on gender, but sorry, Eve just was not helpful on the trip. She was boring, it looked like she didn't even try to pick up her own bike when she fell over (many times). I concur with the earlier poster that Eve should not have inserted herself (for pretty much obviously selfish reasons). I was glad also that she wasn't there long. Charley was really nice and well-behaved about that whole thing. But Olly didn't drag things down by insisting on coming along, so he was out of the issue. Plus, Ewan and Charley are funny and interesting. When Eve was there, I found her quite dull, not being a guy who appreciates a cute face or whatever. I got tired of Ewan saying how great she was when she obviously wasn't, and I hope that Ewan and Eve can do their own trips separately from the ""Long Way"" series in future. Sorry to feel this way, as I'm all about girl power, but sheesh. I didn't sign on to see a girly girl with only a husband to recommend her get coddled along with the guys. Eve probably had a great time, and I'm glad Ewan liked having her there, but I found her to be a drag.

Apart from these negative observations, I loved how the team went through Africa. I felt like getting more involved in HIV/AIDS volunteering. I think they are great and overall this was a great show.",1252108800,,1963,4.317073170731708
2927039,5,B000UX5GFQ,"Although I have never been (and likely never will be) on a motorcycle, this series of DVDs (Long Way Round, Race to Dakar and Long Way Down) is an engaging introduction to why so many people love their motorbikes and the real freedom that can come with that vehicle. The focal points of these DVDs are Ewan McGregor (of Star Wars and Moulon Rouge fame) and Charlie Boorman, who are extremely approachable and honest center-points to an extremely complex set of trips. They are supported by an amazing crew, who through every series you'd like to know a little more about, in some just inspiring locations.

 If you just want to understand why people like bikes, this is a fantastic intro. If you are a motorcycle lover, who's trying to share with your family and friend (or even co-workers) why you love your motorbike, this may really get them to appreciate your passion. Regardless, the entire household will find themselves sucked in, watching every episode they can, and alternating between being glad is isn't them, and jealous that they weren't there. Since these are so addictive, It could turn into a major time commitment, when you pick up ONE of the series, and discover that now you really personally NEED to go through all the other ones too. If you watch an episode a night, you could find nearly a whole month gone into this wonderful series of adventures! I know I did.

Every DVD series (LWR, RTD, LWD) has a story arc that covers 3 basic premise points: 1) Cover (and record) a LOT of milage that isn't routine driving terrain / places for western Europeans or North Americans in a short or short-ish period of time; 2) Discover/document the some of the unique people, features and creatures that inhabit all the places they go and 3) Support UNICEF in places where they often literally mean the difference between life and death. All this while dealing with all the really random things that happen on any long trip. These episodes are not about how to fix the bike, or bike culture, or political statements. They are a video travelogue of the best type!",1251936000,,2072,4.686813186813187
2927040,5,B000UX5GFQ,"One of my dreams is to do this kind of riding. So it's not possible that I won't like this DVD set. But anyone that loves adventure riding will love this trek. It's not quite as good as Long Way Round from an adventure standpoint, but it's actually just as enjoyable for different reasons.

It's a bit less long (at least than the full length LWR), and so feels really about right for length. There are several events they experience where they are genuinely having fun, and that makes watching the video fun, too. Having Ewan's wife along for part of it adds a new dimension not found in the original series.

The quality of the video is as good or better than the original. Africa actually seems to have more variety than the LWR trek. And there is a lot more events that involve meeting people it seems than in LWR, which I think is part of why it's at least as enjoyable.

Ewan and Charley are both very approachable and likable. And they are very different, too. They play off of each other very well, and you can see how much they like and respect each other. Their friendship, and their genuineness, add immensely to the enjoyment. Sometimes they can each be a bit melodramatic, but in the end, this is simply who they are and it is genuine. They are both ""real"" people, and I respect that.

Having watched each series once or twice, if I was going to pick one up again, it would I think be this one. This set is a bargain for what you get. There is also a complete set that has the original (full length), this set, and also the Race to Dakar issue, all in one set. Race to Dakar is getting hard to find otherwise.

2927042,2,B000UX5GFQ,"I'll make it short.  Long way round was very special because you had two friends in an adventure and struggle that was truly amazing to watch. It's a very rare event in life when you can leave the wife and family and trek across the world with one of your best friends.  Ewan ruined that whole dynamic by dragging his wife along for part of the journey without even asking anyone else involved and on top of that she never even RODE a bike before- awful.  Ewan's brother Colin had more reason to be there. The tension is palpable and puts a sour note over what had the potential to be a truly unique sequel.

Granted there were other issues as people mentioned so I won't go into them but I really think this was a major one that needed to be touched on more deeply. I lost a lot of respect for Ewan and I'm sure Charley and their crew did as well for putting a damper on what was a very special thing. This is not an anti-female/anti-wife thing as the reviewer Amber pointed out but come on- she had to know this would cause tension and could have gone on a separate bike trip.

I thoroughly enjoyed Long Way Round. Their travels were tremendously entertaining, with absent roadways, accidents, and playful banter that made it a fun travelogue. It was also strange to see such out-of-the-way places where roads vanished, streams swelled requiring special crossings, and the people that turned out and took them in. It was a microcosm event where we got inside the heads of both the travelers and those they visited.

But things changed for the worse with Long Way Down.

First is the overuse of the helmet cameras and microphones. The sound was often exceptionally muffled, forcing one to rewind the DVD and turn up the volume in hopes of hearing what was said. The helmet cams, too, gave poor quality video and were often grimy or rain-splattered, not letting the viewer enjoy the sites around Africa and beyond.

And where Long Way Round started off with a bang, giving us some great entertainment right from episode one, Long Way Down didn't really pick-up for me until episode four when we are fully entrenched in Africa's amazing countries.

It was also a bit perturbing to see so much time given over to their time with UNICEF. Although I think this is a very worthy cause, it isn't why I like watching travel diaries like this. I want to experience the road and the people and the countryside. Having it on the DVD's extra features was fine, which is where most of the UNICEF information should've remained (I still would've watched the extras, too).

For those familiar with Long Way Round, they'll be happy to learn that Claudio is back in the saddle with our two boys, filming every move and crashing and burning yet again! The guy needs to pay closer attention to the road.

There's been some negative comments made about Ewan's wife's choice to join them on one leg of the journey. I thought this was excellent. She turned out to be a good diversion for Ewan and Charley, as well as quickly becoming an adequate motorcyclist.

I will also say that it was wonderful to see so many different cultures as the two crossed the African plains. I was particularly impressed with Ethiopa, which I'd always pictured as arid and depressing. But here we get to see the lushness of its green, verdant lands ...and it's incredibly gentle people.

Indeed, all of the people Charley and Ewan meet are amazingly gracious and hospitable. Perhaps even more than the tough roads they traveled. Many miles and many friends were passed during this trip.

2927049,5,B000UX5GFQ,"I really liked Long Way Round.  This was all that and even more.  I actually thought the Long Way Round was better between the two books, but when it comes to the video, Long Way Down was so much more rich and compelling.  I think it's because they had more time to get involved with meeting people and delving deeper in the culture.  These two are an absolute blast to watch because they are so different, but yet they compliment one another so well.  Ewan is committed and competitive, determined to keep on the throttle and not tip in the sand, vying for approval . . . while Charley is grinning like a kid on his first bike, popping wheelies, bunji jumping, and getting good and grubby.  It's a shame we don't see Charley on the big screen as much as Ewan because he's an absolute joy to watch and listen to.  I'm really looking forward to the Long Way Up because Ewan and Charley are the new dynamic duo in my book.

2927054,5,B000UX5GFQ,"After watching ""Long Way Round"" several times, I didn't think ""Long Way Down"" would live up to it...but I really gotta say I think it did.  Lots of goods and bads have been mentioned in others' reviews, and I agree with some of the stuff that's been said.  It takes a while to get into LWD.  The first episode is great.. I love watching them get things together for the trip. The following few episodes are lacking somewhat... things are just very rushed and the adventure really isn't there.  Just a lot of complaining and worrying about how many miles they need to make each day to reach a checkpoint that they have to get to.  But then the trip really hits it's stride and is phenomenal.  By the end of the dvds you feel like part of the adventure and you don't want it to end.

One thing that's been said that I have to agree with is that the ""support team"" is way too much a part of this series.  I almost get the feeling that Russ and Dave (co-producers/directors) saw this as an opportunity to get a lot more camera time than in LWR.  Not an episode goes by where these guys aren't adding their own commentary and showing clips of them driving through the countryside when we're really buying these dvds for the bikes.  Of course I don't mind some support crew footage, but there is just way too much of it here.  It's almost as if we're watching a documentary about an entire bike/car team rather than two buds on bikes.  Dave and Russ.. if you're reading this please cut the support crew screen time in Long Way Up in half.. I know seeing yourselves up on the big screen is cool but the show's about Charley and Ewan.

On the whole this is a great show and I'm sad I finished the final episode today.  If all you know of Africa is what you've seen on TV and in movies, this show will really open your eyes to what a beautiful country Africa really is.  The people.. the landscapes.. just amazing.  I'd recommend buying the 10 Episode Special Edition over the 6-Episode version.  The Special Edition offers so much more.  Same goes for LWR.  I have Charley's ""Race to Dakkar"" on the way and I'm hoping Long Way Up comes to fruition.  See you on the open road.",1231372800,,2167,4.316831683168317

As many of the reviewers have said, the very tight schedule they had to follow towards the beginning of the trip diminished the enjoyability of it a little, but not enough to dampen my overall enthusiasm for the series.  I followed their voyage as they were making it through the BBC website, which was fantastic!  Seeing this just made me feel like I was on the trip with Ewan and Charlie.  I enjoyed LWD just as much as LWR, but for different reasons.  They were more of a cohesive team in this one, even though there was some tension.

In that vein, the addition of Eve into the trip was a major contributor to that tension.  I'm a woman, so rest assured this doesn't stem from a ""boy's own"" attitude.  I just thought that Eve should not have inserted herself into the trip.  She put Ewan in a very tough position, because you HAVE to support your wife publicly.  That's just the way it works.  So, she put Ewan in the position of having to broach the subject to a bunch of friends (especially Charley), who were hoping to have another adventurous /male-bonding kind of trip.  If Eve wants to join Ewan on trip, she can do that anytime.  She doesn't need to be a part of these major outings.  I'm glad her screen time was rather abbreviated, and I hope she doesn't insist on being a part of Long Way Up, should they actually do that trip.  I prefer the strictly male, fun-loving, boy's bonding kind of trip sans any wives.

As mentioned before, the beginning of trip was so rushed, and the guys so tired, that tensions and emotions bubbled over.  That's understandable.  Traveling of any kind can be tiring, but covering those kinds of miles on a motorcycle has to be just exhausting.  Despite that, there were some really fun, enjoyable moments from Scotland to Libya.  One is definitely the Moto Guzi factory.  It's a hoot to see how enthusiactic Ewan is with the more comfortable seat on the classic bike!  A very moving time is their visit to the CHAS house in Scotland.  The people they encountered in this first part of the trip, the scenery, and the moments shared between friends starting a major adventure together more than make up for any tensions.

The rest of the voyage through the African continent is really engaging.  It's fascinating to watch as the terrain, the people, and the cultures change almost day by day.  I had no idea that Ethiopia is so green and beautiful!  Most of us only remember the drought-stricken images we saw during the 1980s.  It seems to be just a fabulous country, with wonderfully warm people.  It's also a joy to see Ewan's rapport with the children he encounters.  He is well-known for his love and compassion for children, and you can see that children just adore him.

One thing I would change is to add more footage that involves the support crew - especially Russ and David.  I really enjoy seeing the dynamics of the relationships with the whole team.  There was more of that in LWR than in this one.  A classic support crew moment in LWD is when Dai Jones ""loses"" his passport.  It's hilarious!

Some LWR fans felt letdown by this series, but I think that's mainly because they were hoping for LWR 2.  This was a completely different trip - with different requirements, different cultures, different dynamics, different terrain, and different desires on the part of the participants.  It was no less enjoyable for those differences.  I wouldn't want to watch a replicated journed to LWR in just a different setting.  It's entertaining BECAUSE of the differences.  If you enjoy learning about different cultures and places that most of us will probably never get to see firsthand - all from the perspective of very likable, though very human, motorcycle enthusiasts - then you will enjoy LWD!!!",1227830400,29,3834,4.62074074074074
2927063,4,B000UX5GFQ,"This series gets down to the nitty gritty of a trip through the African continent by two movie stars.  It shows, in it's own way, some of the beauty and some of the harshness of that continent.  It's funny in places, sad in places, and downright tearful in others.  The motorcycle ride aspects are very true to life (having made many myself but all in the US.)  Sometimes the movie is even a bit crude, just what life on the road would be!
We watched an episode each evening, eagerly awaiting the next day's adventure.
Well worth the cost.",1227571200,3,539,4.414141414141414

2927065,5,B000UX5GFQ,"Not sure how to classify this, either a documentary or a buddy movie.  Either way this is an excellent adventure movie, even if you are not a motorcycle enthusiast.  The only down on this is there is some 'colorful' language at times that may make it questionable for younger viewers.",1227052800,,284,4.66

I would have given this five stars except I cannot recommend it to be viewed by young children or people who are sensitive to profanity. These guys are real. And so is their language.",1500249600,,472,4.130434782608695
