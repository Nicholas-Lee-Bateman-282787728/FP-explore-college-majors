7572894,5,B019EMPBN0,"First of all, I love the show. However, on amazon video, it lists 5 seasons, but DVD format  says season 6. So I bought it on DVD, not realizing it was actually just the end of the season five - and the series of the show. Watch the show because it is amazing, but be aware that there really is no season 6, it's just part 2 of season 5.",1507593600,3,337,3.8142857142857145

7572905,5,B019EMPBN0,"This is an entertaining show. I normally don't like cop shows- I usually find them too repetitive and formulaic, but I tried this one because the price was so good. This show puts a strong focus on the characters and their relationships, which I like. Not every episode is just a 'case of the week' scenario. They make sure to have a continuous, evolving story line and keep things interesting. I especially like the relationship between Andy and Sam and how that develops. I recommend trying it even if you don't normally like cop shows and give it a few episodes- you'll be hooked. The quality of the picture on the DVD isn't perfect, no, but so what, the entire series is 30 dollars.  It's worth it.",1498867200,,702,4.52755905511811

7573016,2,B019EMPBN0,"I'm not reviewing the actual show, which is great and extremely enjoyable and the only reason for the 2 stars. Most of the other seasons of Rookie Blue were released on Blu-ray, and all were broadcast in HD. This SD DVD is however the only way to own this (and season 5, which is marked as Season 5 Part One but there is no part 2). This is one of the crappier dvd transfers I've ever seen. It's like they took the HD masters and stuck them on VHS then ripped the VHS' to DVD. Literally an hour of work max went into this. If you're a completest and fan of the show, obviously you'll need this, but don't expect it to be above VHS quality.",1458950400,32,639,4.079365079365079
