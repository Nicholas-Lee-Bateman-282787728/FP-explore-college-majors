8104796,5,B000E373AI,"My first thought when I watched this film was, ""Hmmm, the narration sounds oddly familiar."" Having read ""The Ruby Slippers of Oz"" many times, I was not surprised to see when the credits rolled that the show had been written by the book's author, Rhys Thomas. Just a little caveat for those who are familiar with the book: you may experience deja vu.

Rhys Thomas ought to do a sequel, because obviously there have been a few changes since this film was aired--one pair of shoes has changed hands yet again, and Michael Shaw's pair was, of course, stolen in 2005. Honestly, if the Shaw pair is ever recovered, the culprit will never be able to hold their head up again, because there is just too much mystique and prestige attatched to the slippers. It will be interesting to see how that saga pans out. But I digress.

This film is a must for Oz fans and anyone who is interested in film costuming or Hollywood's Golden Age. I enjoyed this film immensely. There are lots of close-ups of all the known pairs of slippers and a few tidbits that aren't in the book. I had to watch it over again--once wasn't enough!",1237248000,,1111,4.467980295566503
