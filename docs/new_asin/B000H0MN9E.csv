8135770,2,B000H0MN9E,"This is a dubbed German made for TV movie that isn't all that bad, nor all that good.  The scenes with the thousands of rats is pretty effective.  The dubbing is pretty bad and hinders the actors (?) performances.  The story revolves around a rat infestation in Frankfort, where the bitchy mayor lowered funding for waste removal thereby causing a strike, in which the garbage isn't picked up; it's also the hottest summer in Frankfort history so this situation inflames the rodent's appetite and ferocity.

Not a complete time waster for fans of this kind of movie.",1163289600,,566,4.804123711340206
