6607556,5,B00N1JQ2I6,"John Herzfeld & Rebekah Chaney have put together a great film. Great script, music, cinematography, music & acting. Not to mention a cast of so many great actors & actresses including: Sylvester Stallone, Kevin Connolly, Kelsey Grammer, Kyra Sedgwick, Tom Berenger, Danny Aiello, Tom Sizemore, Danny Trejo just to name a few of them.

This is a really good movie, definitely worth a watch (or two)!  Often I worry about a film with this many top notch stars in (look at the list of performers in this film, it's quite impressive).  Often that means a lot of short cameos with no real contribution.  However, in this case all of the acting is good and contributes to the overall movie in a positive way.  The music is very well done and the camera work, editing and post production was also very well done.  The movie is definitely a feel good film.  Only negative would be that after watching the film, some may want to go out and but the book, Reach Me, but none has been released.  Watch this film, enjoy the ride and leave afterwards believing that you can do more with your life if you have the will to do so.",1416355200,5,1113,4.475247524752476

6607649,2,B00N1JQ2I6,"Pleasant but completely inconsequential comedy/drama by John Herzfeld, the director of The Death and Life of Bobby Z and writer/director of 15 Minutes, both underrated.  Unfortunately Reach Me recalls his earlier 2 Days in the Valley with its collection of California characters and their overlapping story-lines.  Reach Me likely concludes with as many cute, happy couples as Love Actually--but that's not the problem.  The problem is that writer/director John Herzfeld seems to be trying to split the difference between the darker and more ambitious multiple character films of Robert Altman (Nashville; Short Cuts) and the more blatant audience pleasing of Richard Curtis (Love Actually)--but since Herzfeld's characters are cartoons lacking any genuine pain or yearning he would have been much better off completely embracing the crowd-pleasing elements in his material and ditching the attempts to find genuine meaning in any of this.

The basic story involves a self-help book titled Reach Me and how it transforms the lives of various characters in the movie.  The passages of the book that are read out loud come across as trite bromides rather than brilliant insights--several characters in the movie even say as much.  The power of Reach Me isn't in the words of the book but the fact that people have chosen to believe in them, giving the characters the confidence or strength to make better choices.  Unfortunately Reach Me never comes up with a believable reason for why so many people chose to believe in this particular book which only adds to the overall feeling of phoniness that permeates the material--actually spending some screen time demonstrating how Reach Me became a viral sensation likely would have been a good idea.

A put upon reporter (Kevin Connolly) is assigned the task of uncovering the identity of the reclusive author of Reach Me by his overbearing editor (Sylvester Stallone) or lose his job.  A police officer (Thomas Jane) kills a lot of people doing his job and is constantly confessing to his favorite priest (Danny Aiello) who thinks the cop should quit his job if he can't do it without killing people so often.  A woman just released from prison (Kyra Sedgwick) moves in with her British accented actress cousin who was sexually harassed by the star of a television program that offered her first speaking part.  And a pair of mismatched gangsters named Dominic and Thumper who have been friends since childhood are sent to track down a woman named Denise-Denise and her boyfriend who owes money to a nasty gangster (Tom Sizemore).

Much of Reach Me is actually fairly amusing but writer/director Herzfeld won't fully commit to making a comedy--there's the whole Robert Altman this-movie-is-about-bigger-things vibe that frequently hamstrings the film because Herzfeld seems to want us to take these characters more seriously than is possible and buy into the message that people can be transformed for the better if they believe in themselves.  It's a nice, positive message but when your characters are cartoons with cartoon problems and the catalyst for their inspiration is a book that seems to have nothing special to say that part of Reach Me inevitably fails.

The sequence where the reporter is cured of his smoking habit over the course of one night after he meets the reclusive author (Tom Berenger) in the flesh and calls him a fraud works surprisingly well--but it's the only non-comic scene in all of Reach Me that does.  Tom Berenger is very good as the author whose own weaknesses make him want to remain in the shadows.  Thomas Jane proves once again that he is much more effective in comic roles than when he tries to be serious--he also has a nice chemistry with Danny Aiello who is more father figure than Father Paul to him.  Everyone in the cast has their moments except for Sylvester Stallone who is seriously miscast as the media mogul--giving Stallone large chunks of uninterrupted dialogue inevitably recalls his Rambo monologues and brings out the worst in the actor.

Reach Me could have been much better if writer/director John Herzfeld had either gone all in on the comedy elements or taken the time and care to make the self-help book of the title into a believable viral phenomenon.  Reach Me has a nice message but without a strong script to support it that message feels phony and hollow and the time spent selling it wasted.  Still, the assembled cast is very impressive for a straight to video film and the good-natured vibe of the material makes Reach Me easy to sit through.  Unfortunately that's the best that can be said about Reach Me which lacks the satirical edge Robert Altman would have brought to the material or the inspirational vibe that a cornier, Frank Capra style approach might have yielded.  Despite obvious good intentions and an excellent cast Please Me is a pleasant time waster at best.",1430956800,,4887,4.985239852398524

It is a mixture of side stories surrounding a self help book written by a writer that doesn't want public attention to himself and only gives a name.  The movie is tongue in cheek while filled with all kinds of stars Tom Berenger, Sylvestor Stallone, Thomas Jane, Danny Aiello, Kyra Sedgwyck, Tom Sizemore and a lot more.  They all do adequate jobs.  While none are exceptional they all entertain in a story that is not difficult to follow.  It is a standard foil today to tell a story with a lot of side stories that all come together at the end.  This one is no exception, it is just entertaining.  A bit of escapism that is worth a watch.  The film is of course aimed at adults and while it is rated PG-13, I would give it a R for sure, some money must have changed hands with the people who rate the films.

6607674,4,B00N1JQ2I6,"Reach me(released Nov/14)stars,among others, Sylvester Stallone,Kyra Sedgwick,Thomas Jane,Terry Crews,Lauren Cohan,Kelsey Grammer,Kevin Connolly,Tom Berenger ,Danny Aiello and many more. This is a movie about seemingly disparate characters and stories coming together in the finale.
The essence of the story revolves around a book called Reach Me. However no one has ever seen the writer,even though his book has obviously inspired many and continues to do so. An aspiring journalist with his head strong boss nipping at his heels tries to run down the authors whereabouts.
Throughout the film we run into other folks whose lives have been touched or are about to be touched by the book's philosophy. There is a cop who obviously enjoys his career but who attends confessional just about every day to absolve himself of his""sins"",his proclivity for killing criminals. The priest has heard his confessions ad nauseum,is a drinker and wants nothing more to do with him. Then there is a man who borrowed money from a criminal boss to fund a ""film career"" for a much younger girl ,and who has now forfeited on the loan and is on the run. The goons the boss sends after the man to collect are two friends that have been together since the third grade. One is reading Reach Me and is profoundly effected by it. He eventually persuades his partner to quit the entire racket and follow his dream of being a cook and open a restaurant.
There is also a female ex con who goes to live with her sister who is an aspiring actress,and who has just been sexually humiliated by a scummy actor during a scene in her first speaking role. These two end up crashing into the cop,literally,and their two lives start to merge,slowly but surely.
Near the end of the film the author has finally been outed by the reporter and shamed into appearing in public. It is here that all the stories finally merge and circumstances come to a head for all. As a result their lives are changed for the better,forever.
I must admit I am a sucker for this kind of a movie....when done right that is. And I find that it was indeed done nicely. When watching this film you will a see a great mess of actors that you either haven't seen in a long time(and wish you'd see more of) or ones you can watch playing roles they don't usually play. Crewes is one,as he is particularly effective as the authors rep. Stallone is top notch here as the journalist's quirky but head strong boss. Grammer is also bang on with his ever so brief appearance as Sizemore's boss. Jane is great as the conflicted cop, as is Berenger who teaches overcoming personal hurdles,but needs to listen more to his own book to cure HIS many phobias. It is a well acted film by all involved. If I recall right this film had a LOT of money issues to get it up and going and it was a stop/start kind of production. At least though it was made,and that is all that counts. An FYI,watch for the Dave Clark Five poster on the wall in the journalists office. Nice touch.
Technically it is in its original w/s/ a/r of 1:77:1 and is clear and crisp.there are no extras.
All in all a fine movie involving several different characters,each with their own story to tell,all slowly but surely coming together in the end for a pleasing climax. Everyone did a great job. A solid 4 stars.",1422316800,2,3302,4.6078098471986415
6607675,2,B00N1JQ2I6,"Testosterone-loaded, the 2014 ensemble drama REACH ME cast includes tough guys Sylvester Stallone, Danny Aiello, Terry Crews, Tom Berenger, Tom Sizemore, Thomas Jane, Danny Trejo, and Chuck  Zito, among others.  With fewer muscles in his whole body than any of those formidable dudes has in just one forearm, Kevin Connolly is thrown in the mix for the sake of contrast, if nothing else, along with Kyra Sedgwick and Lauren Cohan.  High-energy, violent, and most of all off-beat, REACH ME shoots for the moon in its telling of a self-help book that inspires people to reconsider their lives and seek out its reclusive author.  Of the different stories the film attempts to tell, the relationship between priest Aiello and dirty cop Jane commands the most attention while Stallone's hard-driving newspaper editor is the most interesting character.

The stellar cast delivered outstanding performances, and although this film would fall into the category of films that make you feel great and that are ideal to watch with your significant other or family (I felt it was clean enough to be suitable for kids 10 and up or so), it never becomes nauseatingly ""cute"" the way a lot of those other warm-hearted drama/comedies do--the sort that usually when I find myself stuck watching with others make me roll my eyes and hope for a speedy conclusion. I loved these characters so much I would have been happy to watch another half-hour at least of their unique stories, but of course it was well-timed and edited so that we can enjoy the ride toward the conclusion. All of the talents were outstanding and I don't want to short any of them but I'll say Stallone, in his biggest SOB bit ever performed, had the force of a severe storm in one particular scene--some very powerful anger performed that had me in awe. Berenger was amazing as always, and seeing Kelsey Grammer portraying a seriously mean and nasty ""business man"" was amazing. Kevin Connolly's transition from slob to something greater was enough inspiration in and of itself, Thomas Jane as the kind-hearted vigilante offered up plenty to that part of me that enjoys films of vigilante justice. Then seeing the very talented Laura Cohan full of heart and on the other side of fighting the undead, Tom Sizemore as an irate, disgraced criminal, Nelly as a rehabilitated, formerly very negative hiphop artist, Elizabeth Henstridge dealing with a very negative experience associated with her breaking into the film industry, Cary Elwes playing a very (oddly for the likable actor) sleazy and detestable film star, Terry Crews being his usual awesome self. I guess my OCD wanted to list as many of the unique characters and talents portraying them as I could and even still I feel I'm leaving a lot of talent out, I should maybe write a thesis on this film? All in all I fell in love with this film that doesn't appear to be getting the recognition it deserves, in particular for the abundance of spiritual healing one might obtain by treating oneself to this exceptional piece of film art.

The main plot concerns author Teddy Ramons (Tom Berenger) who has written a rather generic self help book called ""Reach Me."" It is basically face your fears and just say no type of thing. The book goes viral and obtains cult status as Teddy tries to remain anonymous.

Reporter Roger (Kevin Connolly) is attempting to discover the author's identity at the request of his boss Sylvester Stallone, who plays a small part. Wolfie (Thomas Jane) is an LA cop who enjoys killing bad guys and then confessing about it. He had a great opening scene. There is also a mafia captain using two hit men to recover money from a movie deal. Another subplot consists of a woman (Kyra Sedgwick) who just got out of prison. Many people are using his self help book for motivation.

At times the film felt like a grindhouse, other times a drama. There is some formula writing which makes you think you are watching a romantic comedy or Lifetime film. The film fails if you try to put it into a category, but doesn't fail overall.  Then again, it doesn't soar because it was all over the place. Good characters. Fair plot.

6607732,5,B00N1JQ2I6,"After reading the reviews on some of the other sites, I watched Reach Me twice to make sure I had seen the same movie. I had. I wondered why I found it delightful and other reviewers were scathing so I checked their reviews of movies that I had found a total waste of time. No more confusion on my part. If you have dabbled in the self-help literature, you will find this movie hilarious, familiar, and affirming. You will smile in recognition as the experts speak through the characters. You will wonder if Herzfeld was taking a good-natured jab at the motivational field or making the audience aware of how common are our needs, how few are our deepest fears, and how simple are the solutions to reaching our potential. Yes, there was a happy ending, but thats the point of motivation. We want to know that we can be better, try harder, do more, and achieve our dreams if we take responsibility for actions, choose to listen to our own voices, and help others along the way. Is it hokey? You betcha. Is it a better way to spend a couple of hours than watching the usual life sucks then you die or lets blow the whole thing up or life sucks, lets do some blow then get naked? Absolutely. There are the obligatory scenes for todays audience: smoking pot, sex (but under the covers), violence, and cursing. What I didn't see was the same level of cynicism, disdain, and disrespect for life that has become common. Although you don't need to have a self-help background to understand the jokes or the dialogue, you do need to pay attention, listen, and think. There is a faster patter to the conversations with fewer filler (i.e., f*$#) words, and the humor isn't cruel, derogatory, misogynistic or about drugs, sex, and farts. Is it perfect? No. Does it reach its potential? Probably not. However, it will leave you feeling optimistic, hopeful, and encouraged, which is why I believe so many other reviewers have been critical. If you feel like crap, believe the future sucks, and want everyone else to join you in one smashing pity-pot party, this is not the movie for you. If you feel like crap or not, believe the future sucks or not, and want a storyline to hang on to until you move through a rough period or want characters to keep you believing there are others who are trying to be better, achieve more, and yes, even live up to their potential, then Reach Me is for you. Watch it in the same light-hearted, you-can-do-this attitude with which it was made and you will enjoy it.",1416960000,49,2485,4.536748329621381
