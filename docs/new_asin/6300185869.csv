243843,3,6300185869,"Just watched it, and for horror affectiandoes, it's certainly worth seeing for the remarkable film debut of Oliver Reed in a passionate, touching performance.  The story itself is also well constructed, avoiding much of  the cliches of traditional horror, and creating a ""Romeo and  Juliet"" tension that is quite remarkable.  There are flaws, however  that I found distracting; the makeup and lighting are both AWFUL!  It took  me away from the movie, and the mob scene at the end was more than a little  unconvincing.  But an enjoyable movie overall.",940032000,,551,5.033333333333333

243945,4,6300185869,"Being released as part of a two disc, dual layered dual sided Hammer Horror set from Universal in September, ""Curse of the Werewolf"" features a fine performance from a very young Oliver Reed. You'll need to use the ASIN below or the webpage to find it as it isn't listed (at present) under its own title but under ""Phantom of the Opera"". Set in Spain (although Guy Evans source novel is set in France) Reed Plays Leon who's mother died during child birth and whose father raped the girl. Born in Christmas Day, it's clear that Leon is cursed; the baptism water boils which is not a good sign to say the least. The boy is adopted by Don Alfredo Corledo (Clifford Evans). Early on it's clear things are amiss as livestock are routinely killed whenever the moon is full.

As Leon grows into adulthood and he discovers the truth about his past and learns what he really becomes when the moon is full. Featuring a surprisingly good script by Anthony Hinds (writing as John Elder)and featuring a top flight cast ""Curse of the Werewolf"" is one of Fisher's best films. Like ""Horror of Dracula"", Fisher managed to put his stamp on the Hammer films he directed for the studio and his personality informs the film much as it did his other films.

243946,5,6300185869,"Hammer only made one foray into the murky world of werewolf-mania, but they hit one over the fence with this entry.  Young Leon Corledo (Oliver Reed) changes into a gray-pelted werewolf when evil is exalted and the full moon shines bright.  Terence Fisher provides his sure-fire talent as director.  Although influenced by the classic Universal product, this wolf man stands on his own.  Odd elements to a familiar story line appear in the beast's origin.  The script is based on ""The Werewolf of Paris,"" an obscure novel by Guy Endore.  The setting is 18th century Spain.  Take note, the full werewolf makeup only appears at the climax of the film.  The monster is the unseen terror for much of the movie.  Suspense builds slowly.  Unlike Dracula's unholy delight in his blood lust, Leon suffers the torments of the damned.  The curse of the beast.  The full moon draws him, but pure love and careful nurturing keep him human.  Cristina (Catherine Feller) is his love interest.  When they confine Leon in jail, Cristina can't minister to him.  All hell breaks loose as the werewolf explodes out of jail and tears off over the rooftops.  This beast must be part monkey, the way he jumps from ledge to roof and back again.  He climbs the church tower, and meets his fate as the bells toll loudly.  This is one of the great moments in Hammer folklore.  The usual Hammer traits of lush color photography and rich period detail are evident.  A true delight for collectors classic horror flicks. ;-)",1037318400,13,1494,4.739299610894942
243947,5,6300185869,"The late Oliver Reed was something of a hellraiser, and had a predilection for three ""B's"": Booze, Babes, and Brawls. Mr. Reed appeared on talk shows drunk, fell down a hill playing bagpipes in a drunken stupor during the filming of ""Burnt Offerings"", took a chainsaw and cut his house in half when his soon-to-be divorced first wife wanted ""half the house"", slugged reporters, and married a sixteen year old girl when he was in his mid 40s. Ollie was a born wild man, so he was a natural for the lead in the Hammer horror classic, ""Curse of the Werewolf"", early in his career. ""Curse"", made in 1961, was Reed's second or third film, and is Hammer's only werewolf film. Having scrapped plans for a film about the Spanish Inquisition, the ever-thrifty Hammer studio wasn't about to let their newly constructed Spanish sets go to waste. Changing the locale of Guy Endore's ""Werewolf of Paris"" to sunny Spain, they came up with a winner. Sensitive Leon Carrido, played by Mr. Reed, is the orphaned offspring of a crazed, animal-like beggar and a mute (and buxom-this is a Hammer film, remember!) servant girl. He has also inherited the curse of lycanthropy, and has shown disturbing signs of it in childhood, killing goats and his pet kitten in his nocturnal prowlings. When he reaches young manhood, he leaves his adoptive father and sets out to make his way in the world. But his affliction (abetted, no doubt, by his healthy male hormones) resurfaces, with alarming and tragic results. The love of a good girl (the boss' daughter) almost saves Leon from his fate, but ""almost"" doesn't count. What impressed me about this film (and still does) was how sad it was, and how fragile life is. There are so many innocent, tragic characters in the film. The beggar, taunted by an evil Marques, is caged like a wild animal which, in a way, he becomes; the mute servant girl, abused by the Marques and raped by the beggar, lives in the woods like an animal and dies giving birth to her son; Leon, never knowing his parents, is cursed by uncontrollable forces within himself, doomed to tragedy. And the poor animals! The savaged goats, Leon's kitten (tastefully referred to, not seen), and a shepherd's dog, mistakenly shot for the mysterious savage attacker of livestock. Animal lover that I am, I weep! The film has a more ""intimate"" feel than other Hammer outings, and is passionately photographed in striking color, directed by Hammer's famed Terence Fisher. It is acted with intensity and gusto by the virile Mr. Reed, as well as several Hammer regulars such as Clifford Evans, George Woodbridge and Michael Ripper, and there's a particularly loathsome portrayal of the decadent Marques by Anthony Dawson. Benjamin Frankel's beautiful, poignant and exciting score is noteworthy, with a frenzied climax that takes your breath away with its mad rhythms and vivid orchestrations. And, of course, there is Roy Ashton's memorable, demonic werewolf makeup. Reed's werewolf looks like a Gustav Dore illustration come to life, sensuously frightening and lusty, like a ferocious satyr on a rampage. Some people squawk that one doesn't see the werewolf until the climax of the film, but in my view, the suspense leading up to our finally seeing it is more than worth the wait. Oliver Reed was a nightclub bouncer before he turned to acting, and his surly good looks and powderkeg personality were put to good use in his films. Having played a brooding juvenile delinquent in ""Beat Girl"" prior to this film, this ""angry young man"" persona fit him like a glove. Ollie, I know you're raising a ruckus, wherever the hell you are!",1015286400,19,3610,4.843042071197411
243948,4,6300185869,"It is rather ironic that ""The Curse of the Werewolf"" features not only one of the best werewolf makeup jobs in cinema history by Roy Ashton but the best actor ever to play a werewolf in the young Oliver Reed (even if the competition is basically Lon Chaney, Jr. and Michael J. Fox).  The film is loosely adapted from Guy Endore's novel ""The Werewolf of Paris"" with the action moved to Spain because the studio had constructed Spanish-style sets for another movie.  Reed plays Leon, born on Christmas day (as the result of the brutal rape of his mother in a sequence that was filmed but not included because of censorship) and at his christening there is a lightening storm and the baptismal water boils.  Leon might be a sensitive young lad, but he is obviously cursed and eventually something is in the hills killing goat kids and kittens.  When his adoptive father Don Alfredo Carido (Clifford Evans) learns the truth, he promises to show the boy enough love to let Leon's human soul win out over the animal soul within him.  There are no further incidents as Leon grows up and falls in love with Christina (Catherine Feller).  Unfortunately, while she loves him she is betrothed to some rich jerk.  When Leon drowns his sorrows at a local brothel, the wolf returns as one of the ladies tries to comfort him.  When the police arrest him for the three murders, the wolf returns one last time and is chased around the rooftops until the final fatal confrontation with Don Alfredo in the bell tower.
Given how fantastic the makeup job is on Leon as a werewolf, it is a shame that we do not really get to see it until the final chase sequence.  For the actual murders all we get our shots of hairy hands, shadows on the wall, and a lot of growling.  The final chase does allow us to see the werewolf at last, but the creature runs on the roof where the mob cannot get it, climbs down to the ground and lets the mob get close, then climbs back up again, then starts back down, then goes up to the bell tower, etc.  When someone finally throws a torch up on the roof where the werewolf is perched, it lights a convenient bundle of hay on fire, which is then pitched back down at the mob.  However, the ending does have a certain amount of flair.  Reed's performance shows his promise as an actor, and he is even more tortured in his performance than Chaney, Jr's Larry Talbot in Universal's ""The Wolf Man.""  ""The Curse of the Werewolf"" is an above average Hammer film, with a solid script from Anthony Hinds (writing as ""John Elder"") that gives director Terrence Fisher a story right up his alley.",989539200,8,2593,4.466101694915254

When I first found it on video ten years ago, I was overwhelmed at the complex layers of the screenplay.  This is by far one of Hammer's greatest films.  Oliver Reed plays even a more sympathetic part than Lon Chaney's Larry Talbot.

7805833,2,6300185869,"The Curse of the Werewolf, 1961 film

It begins in 18th century Spain. A beggar arrived in the town square on a public holiday. Some complain of their taxes. The beggar goes to the Marquis castle and asks for charity. The nobles mock him and give him wine; then put him in a dungeon. Years pass. A servant girl displeases the Marquis and is put in the dungeon. She cant call for help. Later she is given to the Marquis, but defends herself. She fled to the forest. She is rescued and given shelter. Afterwards she has a baby boy, then dies. A dead goat is found with its throat torn out, it must be a wolf. The hunter is ordered to kill the wolves. At night Leon went outside and was hurt; he has bad dreams. A priest explains how an evil spirit can enter a human body, such as a werewolf. Is there a cure?

People talk about a full moon attracting a werewolf. The hunter creates a silver bullet to shoot a werewolf. Young Leon is grown up and leaves home to find work. He loves the daughter of his employer but she is promised to another. Leon visits a sporting house on a Saturday night, but he feels ill (the full moon). What will happen now? Leon does not remember what happened that night. Must he be chained night and day? He runs off, the police question him. Leon wants to leave with Cristina. But the police arrest him for murder! Cristina arrives, does she know about his affliction? Will a silver bullet save Leon? The full moon causes a change in Leon! He tears down the bars and escapes jail. A crowd pursues him, he climbs a roof of the church. The bells ring, a man fires his gun and kills Leon.

Is this the worst werewolf movie youve ever seen? It was based on The Werewolf of Paris by Guy Endore, which few have read. I read that the movie legends of werewolves was created by Curt Siodmak, a screenwriter for many horror films of the 1930s-1940s. The opening scenes of the nobility remind me of The Hound of the Baskervilles.",1492387200,,1944,4.291553133514986

7805837,4,6300185869,"Just some thoughts...

Curse Of The Werewolf (1961) is one of the more well known Hammer horror movies.  It stars Oliver Reed, Clifford Evans, Yvonne Romain, Anthony Dawson, and Catherine Feller.  I think this movie is pretty good, not bad, but I think it could have been more than it was.  In my opinion, it's too slow moving in the first half especially.  The werewolf doesn't appear nearly enough.  He appears only near the end of the movie, then is killed off.  Oliver Reed plays a good werewolf.  The makeup of the werewolf is good.

This movie is very campy, especially in the first half.  The campiness seems to gradually erode away as the movie heads into the second half, when it suddenly seems like a more serious movie.  This movie has that classic Hammer feel to it - brilliant colors, a bombastic musical score (by Benjamin Frankel), somewhat over-the-top acting, and low tech (though effective) special effects.

Overall, not a bad movie, just a little slow, but worthy of a 4 star rating.",1299715200,,1003,4.7011494252873565
7805838,4,6300185869,"An interesting take on the transmission of the werewolf curse--Christian blasphemy.  A child, through no fault of his own, is born out of wedlock and on Christmas Day is cursed by an all-loving God to be a werewolf. Where's the love in that?",1264464000,2,241,4.604651162790698
7805839,4,6300185869,"This tragic (and long!) Hammer film has all the makings of a classic but it runs nearly three hours!

The story begins in a non-descript European village with a begger who inadvertently insults the Marquis and is thrown into a cell and forgotten.

Just before this you might see Desmond Llewellyn, who plays a bit part, who was later an actor with Sean Connery in the James Bond films a few years later.  But I digress....

He is fed for many years by the jailer's daughter, who grows to be a very buxom lass played by Yvonne Romain.  She herself shrugs off the advances of the Marquis and is thrown into the same cell as the beggar who by now looks pretty grimy.  A roll in the hay ensues.

After she is let out, she is returned to the Marquis whom she then stabs to death.  The film never further explores this part of the tale.  Then she ends up in a river at the forest edge and is taken in by a couple.

The wife of the husband who found her says that she is pregnant and that her baby will be ""an insult to heaven"" because it is unwanted and about to be born on Christmas Day.  Of course, baby Leon is born on Christmas Day just as a wolf howls.  Wouldn't you know it?  And the buxom mom dies in childbirth.

When the kid grows up, they find dead goats and cats around the place and wonder what's going on.  Leon is getting a taste for blood.  The priest explains what's happening and that only love can conquer this curse, as an evil spirit is warring with his soul.

Half the movie takes up this ""meet the parents"" thing.

The second half deals with Leon all grown up looking like Oliver Reed!  This is Oliver's first leading role and he does a lot with what little script there is.  He's forceful, exciting and terrifying.  Example:  He is in a brothel with his friend and co-worker when he is asked to come upstairs to visit this girl.  However, it's a full moon and he's having a lot of trouble keeping it all together.  Well-played, with sweat and later tears the prostitute apart most grimly.

Anyway, he falls in love with his boss's daughter and that spells trouble.  But the viewer believes that this love will stop the curse.  Unfortunately that's not what happens.

As far as Hammer films go there is not a lot of blood and gore and the horror parts are handled tastefully.  The musical score is great in conveying mood and substance.  The acting is a bit over the top, but Oliver Reed puts out a grand performance.

Interesting make-up and change to a wolf better than earlier films with Lon Chaney, Jr.  Some change is with stop-motion photography and not overly done.  The blood dripping from his teeth is something to behold.

Not the best in the Hammer stable, but well worth the watch.

Other familiar faces include Warren Mitchell (The Crawling Eye), Michael Ripper (Dracula Has Risen from the Grave), George Woodbridge (Horror of Dracula), Peter Sallis (Taste the Blood of Dracula) and Alister Williamson (The Oblong Box). Francis De Wolff (The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll) and Desmond Llewellyn (Q in the James Bond films) make unbilled appearances.

Oliver Reed's other films, (thanks to Wikipedia):

Reed starred as Athos the musketeer in three films based on Alexandre Dumas's novels. First in 1973's The Three Musketeers, followed by The Four Musketeers in 1974, and fifteen years later with The Return of the Musketeers. He starred in a similarly historical themed film, Crossed Swords 1978, as Miles Hendon alongside Raquel Welch and a grown up Mark Lester who had worked with Reed in Oliver!. Reed returned to horror as Dr. Hal Raglan in David Cronenberg's 1979 film The Brood.",1247270400,,3607,4.536434108527132

I can still say(and I am 59 years old) tthis was the best horror film I ever saw and definitely the one I thought was most memorable in my life.  It was all due to the fantastic color and acting.

'The Curse Of The Werewolf is one of the slower paced Hammer productions and we don't get much of the Wolfman until the very end of the film. The make-up is pretty good but, it pales in comparison to Jack Pierce's genius make-up from the 1941 classic 'The Wolfman'. Still, I do like the Werewolf make-up in this dry  Lycanthrope tale that strays far from the folklore, as it has become iconic along with the Chaney's version as definitive versions of the creature. This film is being reviewed here on VHS because I watched it on DVD as part of the Hammer Horror series collection including 8 old Hammer classics on a two disc set. The DVD transfers are very good and it is inexpensive. Check it out. I rate this movie at 2 1/2 stars but, it's a lot of fun.",1199318400,,865,4.242424242424242
