3152333,1,B001666484,"If you're getting this because you have fond memories of Maxwell Smart, bumbling agent and you want to share his zaniness with your children, don't!  This is NOT a family-friendly series.  The first time you see the agent paired with Maxwell's Smart's klutzy son, she is clothed in pants and a metal bra/camisole with prominent nipple guns.  There are sexual innuendos galore. If that's your thing, by all means, buy it.  But it was not what I was expecting.

And Maxwell Smart and 99 play second-fiddle to their son and his partner, so there's not much Don Adams zing there either.",1215561600,23,582,4.7227722772277225
3152334,1,B001666484,"We'd just seen the movie, and my wife brought me this in a bookstore assuming it was the original series.  I knew it wasn't, but the front of the DVD claims ""The Complete Series"" with the title ""Get Smart"" with *no* indication that it is the remake other than the fine print ""the Smarts are Back in Control"".  This is somewhere between dishonest and deceptive, and is certainly sleazy.  Buyer beware: the real complete series is ~$200 for a boxed set of multiple seasons.  Shame on Sony marketing.",1215129600,22,497,4.613636363636363
3152335,1,B001666484,"I was initially very disappointed that the show on this DVD was not actually the original Get Smart.  I still gave it a shot though.  It may be that I was already looking at the show negatively based on my initial reaction, but the show is really not very good.  It is hard to give specifics, the show is really just bland.  Owing to the fact that there were only six episodes made.

On the slightly positive side Don Adams is still very funny.  It is also nice to see Barbara Feldon as Agent 99 again.  In my opinion the buck stops with a little bit of nostalgia.",1213833600,11,564,4.166666666666667
3152336,3,B001666484,"I came across this DVD when searching for the original Get Smart TV show, and figured I couldn't go wrong picking this up for just $10.99.  It was great to see Don Adams and Barbara Feldon get back into the roles of Agent 86 and 99, but that was probably the best thing about this dvd.

Maybe my memory is clouded regarding one of my favorite old TV shows, but I don't remember the old version of the shows effects being this bad.  For a show produced in 1995, I expected a lot more from this new series, but was very disappointed.  Many of the 'effects' were simply shown by displaying a can or tool of some kind, then cutting away for a moment and back to the 'results'.  Off the top of my head, the only thing that comes to mind was the scene where the agent pulls out a can of 'instant key' and sprays shaving cream into a doorknob.  Flash away and back, and find a solid white ball of plaster surrounding his hand.  I'm not sure why that sticks in my mind, becuase there were definitely worse 'effects' scenes than that one.

Overall, I'm glad to have found this series that I never knew existed, but I can definitely understand why it was cancelled after only 7 episodes.  Fans of the original series will enjoy it, but don't expect too much.",1213488000,5,1248,4.276595744680851
3152337,3,B001666484,"Fox had a brilliant idea in bringing back this classic series. I was so excited that Get Smart was being brought back years later in an updated version.  First, start with the surviving cast (Don Adams, Barbara Feldon -still gorgeous, David Ketchum, and even a guest shot by Bernie Kopell as the evil Sigfreid.) They also added the stunning (and funny) Elaine Hendrix as another CONTROL agent.
Their one fatal mistake was adding Andy ""the unfunniest , most annoying man on Earth and appropriately named"" Dick as 86 and 99's son Zack. In the original series Max and 99 had twins. So it could have been worse, with the aforementioned Mr. Dick playing a dual role. But had they cast someone more likeable, the series would have went on much longer. I even remember reading an interview with Andy Dick where he trashed the show when it first came out because he also had a role on Newsradio and wanted out of his contract.
So in what could have been a great reboot of the series, CONTROL was not vanquished by KAOS, but bad casting. And niceness did not triumph over evil on this sequel. Sorry about that Chief!
It still amazes me to this day why Andy Dick has a career. I've tried to watch him with other wonderful casts on Newsradio and Less Than Perfect, but have a very low tolerance level to his brand of humor. Well, to each his own, but he's ruined many a fine show for me. Let's hope his 15 minutes are up.",1211587200,75,1410,4.423076923076923
3152338,5,B001666484,"Okay, the year was 1995.  FOX broadcasting wanted to bring in a mid-season replacement, as they are known to do.  Their decision?  Dig up ""Get Smart"".

In this new series, Max is now the Chief of Control and 99, still his wife, is in Congress.  His son, Zack, is a spy and teams up with Agent 66.  (No mention is made of their other offspring, however.)

7 episodes were made.

Some of the benefits accorded the new series:
* Agent 0 -- played by a different actor each week, you never know when 0 appears.
* Most of the humor remains in the same spirit as the original
* Sharply written plots
* Good acting

Some of the downsides to this new series:
* Overtly sexual in many episodes; even the pilot has more innuendo than many of the subsequent episodes combined.
* ""Casino Evil"", a great story, is a rewrite of an original series plot.  (I don't care much for rewrites, but this one did work.)
* Stopped after 7 episodes

Highlight episodes:
* Pilot (ep 1) -- Zack and 66 investigate KAOS' attempt to steal indestructible fabric.  Ignore the innuendo, some of which does get chuckles; there's more to like than dislike in this premiere.
* ""Casino Evil"" (ep 2) -- Zack and 66 infiltrate a casino operated by KAOS.
* ""Goodbye Ms. Chip"" (ep 3) -- A KAOS agent kidnaps and brainwashes 66 to kill an ambassador.

* Wurst Enemies (ep 6) -- An old enemy of Max returns.
* ""Liver Let Die"" (ep 7) -- Zack and 66 infiltrate a KAOS hospital.  This one is my favorite of the new series; it handled the dark concepts and humor immensely well.

I'm surprised this series has been scheduled for release, but am gratified.  My VHS off-air tapings are falling apart.  I do have more than a soft spot for this series, as despite being a newly commissioned series, a lot of it really gels together.  It deserved more of a proper chance than to be axed.

Please check back later to get a rundown on DVD audio/video quality.  It'll probably be very good.",1209427200,55,1936,4.384831460674158
3152339,4,B001666484,"If you think you're getting the complete, original (1965) Get Smart series, make no mistake.  The original series is still available only directly from Time-Life, and is still $199.95. (Update 10/08:  Now scheduled for 11/4/08 availability from Amazon at discounted price!)

This is the brief (7 episode) Get Smart revival series which aired on Fox in 1995.  The series brings back Don Adams (now chief of CONTROL), Barbara Feldon (now a congresswoman), and David Ketchum (Agent 13), but the main characters are now Max and 99's son Zack (Andy Dick) and his partner, Agent 66 (Elaine Hendrix).

I was pleasantly surprised that this series managed to maintain some of the character and humor of the original series -- especially the episode which brought back Bernie Kopell as Siegfried.

And I'm also pleasantly surpised to see this short-lived gem available on DVD.

But if you order it thinking you're getting the original series for under $20, you may be in for a surprise of a different sort.",1206316800,296,996,4.963855421686747

3152363,4,B001666484,"One of the obvious ones is when Smart and 99 encounter an old-style Asian villain called ""The Claw"", who introduces himself in a thick generic Asian accent (generic as in who knows if it's Chinese or Japanese).
""The Craw""? Max asks, nonplussed by the man's pronunciation.
""Not Craw, CRAW""; corrects the man in annoyance. In a later episode, they finally nail the guy, and an Asian police detective with the same kind of accent shows up to collect the suspect; ""Ah, Mr. Claw--so we meet at last"".
""Not Craw, CRAW""; corrects The Claw, seemingly as annoyed by the cop's mispronunciation as by the arrest.
Then there's the infamous Cone Of Silence, meant to protect against eavesdropping. But when Max and the Chief use it, they cannot hear EACH
OTHER.
Another great gag is when Max must deal with somebody's hand coming out of the darkness with a gun. Max applies a martial arts hold on the unseen man's gun hand which requires both hands.
""There's only one way to break this hold""; declares Max.
The unseen attacker's other hand comes out of the darkness with another gun.
""That's the way""; Max admits. This series does not work in these more modern times, as was proven by a next-gen sequel featuring two new agents who work for a new Chief--Max. Which only lasted a few episodes. This was 8 years ago, so its failure was not due to that famous bugaboo of one particular political persuasion--Gun Violence.",1484697600,,1405,4.715447154471545

The parallels and contrasts between this Cold War gem of a series and today's ""Nationless"" war with Islamic Terrorists are striking- and hilarious.  There is no political correctness, a lot of stereotyping and blatant stupidity- which of course is what makes this show so great and Don Adam's portrayal so inspired and unique in all of TV history.  Essentially this show has one message for all of us: Lighten Up and laugh at how ridiculous ALL OF US can be.

The episodes are short and snappy and the wardrobe is impeccable.  The cheesy sets are also a blast along with random cameos from stars like Johnny Carson, Ted Knight, Buddy Hackett and many more.

Sometimes you see the catch phrase coming before max does and the jokes do get a little played out- especially ""Don't tell me... and I asked you know to tell me that."" but don't lose heart- there's a genuine laugh or snicker just around the corner that you weren't expecting.

The only negative thing that happened with this is that the first shipment of the set had 2 disc 4's for the first season and no Disc 1.  A very weird production error that I imagine was not a one-off.  Fortunately, Amazon was all over it and the second I told them the deal, they got a complete replacement right away.  So when you get this set, be sure you check to make sure all the discs are there.

3152405,5,B001666484,"Smart. Maxwell Smart. The dumbest spy in the world, who fights on behalf of the forces of goodness and niceness, and succeeded in making democracy vs. communism a lot more entertaining.

And while some of the running gags become almost tropes (how often will Max repeat a plan that 99 just suggested), this clever parody of spy thrillers is one of the best time capsules of the 1960s. A lot of the comedy is dependent on Mel Brooks and ""The Graduate's"" Buck Henry, but the delicious writing wouldn't work without the brilliant  comic trio of Don Adams, Barbara Feldon and Edward Platt.

Don Adams is Agent 86, Maxwell Smart, a not-so-bright spy with an endless arsenal of strange devices and odd sayings, who survives on a mix of bravado and dumb luck. This bumbling spy works at a top-secret government agency called Control, which is responsible for keeping the free world free (very Cold War). Backing him up is his beautiful partner/love interest Agent 99 (Barbara Feldon) and his long-suffering Chief (Eward Platt) who puts up with Smart's constant mistakes.

Together with 99 (whom he marries late in the series), and the Chief (and his faithful dog Fang), Max battles the forces of badness and rottenness -- namely, the anti-Control called KAOS. They battle against their archnemesis Siegfried and a bunch of other KAOS agents, with explosive paintings, lovable robots, explosive pianos, KAOS shoe stores, evil gurus, espionage on the Orient Express, the Claw, the Choker, evil hippies, and much more.

In a sense, ""Get Smart"" is the perfect antithesis of the suave, inhumanly competent James Bond -- his catchphrases (""Missed it by that much!"") and goofy confidence somehow get him through the day. Unlike Bond and similar movie spies, Max succeeds out of luck and bumbling more often than skill... but somehow, he still succeeds.

The comic timing is a little awkward at the very beginning, but rapidly gets its footing, with lots of running gags (Larabee becomes a secondary source of comic ineptitude) and snappy dialogue (""Confiscate that plant!"" ""I can't do that, Chief. I'm not a priest!""). What's really funny is the endless spoofery -- Max is given all sorts of weird gadgets, including the legendary ""shoe-phone,"" and he faces off against all sorts of cartoonish villains. And it has dozens and dozens of movie spoofs -- ""The Great Escape,"" ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" ""Maltese Falcon,"" ""King Kong,"" and even the Bond movie ""Goldfinger.""

The political clime of the mid 1960s is all over the series, especially in the form of KAOS. But fortunately they don't get preachy -- KAOS is merely a big evil organization, no more. Some references are dated, and this definitely debuted before the era of political correctness and racial sensitivity (there's a bizarre episode about American Indians threatening the US government, and the Claw is funny if un-PC).

Don Adams MAKES this series, with his quirky facial expressions, nasal voice and odd body language. His Max overestimates his own skill and believes himself to be a sexy, karate-chopping Bondian treasure, though he survives mostly by luck (""Missed it by that much!""). Barbara Feldon is the least quirky of the cast, serving as the ""straight woman"" for Max, as well as the brains for his adventures. Edward Platt is just wonderful as the long-suffering, stressed-out Chief, who always looks slightly frayed, and Bernie Kopell is hysterical as the stiff-backed, volatile Siegfried.

It's been decades since ""Get Smart"" was first aired, but it is still gutsplittingly funny if you can get past some of the awkward racial jokes. You'll roll around on the floor, laughing yourself sick... and... loving it.",1442448000,3,3673,5.047854785478548

3152420,2,B001666484,"it was an exciting idea, and not simply because GET SMART - unquestionably the greatest series American television has ever produced or is ever likely to produce - is worthy of it's own equivalent of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION. had it caught on it just might've shook up the sitcom status-quo for the better. sitcoms were so much cooler in the '60s because just about anything could happen then, from landing on a deserted island to being one of two ""monster"" families. whereas somewhere around 1975 someone decided that the sitcom should narrow it's horizons, and it seems like every ""new"" sitcom since has found itself in the same mundane day-to-day life motif and/or rut. whatever bureacrat bozo(s) made that decision may well of been put in their place, had GET SMART Mk. II had the same punch as it's ancestor.
(for The Record, i'm not saying there's no validity to that day-to-day life approach. certainly there's tales to be told from that ""real life"" viewpoint. (see The Dick Van Dyke Show, for instance, or The Honeymooners.) what makes me nuts is the fact that that's all any sitcom even tries to do anymore.)
and since it dealt with concerns as well as absurdities that were still going strong 25 years later, there's no reason why it shouldn't of been revivable.
well, okay, there was one. i've heard more than one director say that 90% of their job is casting the right actor in the right part. the most positive thing i can say for Andy Dick is to NOT give in to the obvious dumb joke suggested by his last name. for one thing, he just doesn't fit. i suppose i could buy him as the offspring of Barney Fife, but even my flexible disbelief can't be suspended far enough to buy him as even the remotest relation to Maxwell Smart. oh yes, his limited talent was a contributing factor as well. Dick can bumble with the best of 'em, but he fails miserably to inspire anything resembling the admiration, to say nothing of affection, which Don Adams was even then commanding from a whole new audience via Nick At Nite. in other words, you may occasionally laugh at Andy Dick, but you'll never quite ROOT for him.
(the only possible excuse to be made is that Dick's brand of surrealist vulgarity was not his OFFICIAL stock-in-trade yet.)
to say nothing of lack of respect for the audience. he walked unceremoneously off the series with no warning when he was offered a part on NEWSRADIO. this constituted an upward move in his career because that show was on a ""major"" network, NBC. (remember those days when the Fox Network was still regarded as little more than a notch above UHF?) and as Fate would have it, NEWSRADIO was another mostly pretty good series wherein Dick was the weakest link in the chain.
his own sidekick, one Elaine Hendrix, has neither the beauty nor the charm of (still frickin' gorgeous) Barbara Feldon. Hendrix being just as miscast as Andy Dick, they have a curious sort of antimatter chemistry. they're a nice, cozy fit, for all the nothing that comes of it.
surprisingly good news, though. in a twist of Fate which makes this DVD worth owning in more than the historical curiosity sense, the tried-and-true elements are as potent as ever. the redoubtable Don Adams remains in top form, and Maxwell Smart's new standing as Chief of CONTROL is something he can handle in spite of still being his old ditzy self. (it's something i've noticed about ""buffoon"" characters like Maxwell Smart, Gilligan, Inspector Clouseau, Don Quixote, Lou Costello: they always seem to have some spark of brilliance they can find if we let them work at their own pace. they're never complete, hopeless idiots for the very simple reason that they couldn't carry a story if they were.) his chemistry with Barbara ""99"" Feldon and Bernie ""Siegfried"" Kopell hadn't dissipated in the least. if only they had found more suitable leads so restricting the established characters to the periphery wouldn't feel like such a gyp.
what's more, the stories make for a concerted and impressive update. consider the pricelessly titled ""Liver Let Die,"" in which KAOS engages in the then fairly new field of organ trafficking. but then, they did have Leonard Stern, the writer/producer who more than anyone else held the reins of the original series, on the payroll as ""special consultant.""
the series has it's own cool new touches. for instance the CONTROL elevator has gone from an obsolete telephone booth in an empty office building to a soda vending machine at a carwash. KAOS is now run by a sublimely sinister faceless woman. (a tip of the hat, perhaps, to the nemesis of Adams' other signature character, Inspector Gadget?) and let us not forget ""Agent Zero,"" the master of disguise played by six different actors/actresses (two apiece in each of his/her three appearances).
the series was obviously prompted by the successful as well as satisfying ""reunion"" tv-movie GET SMART AGAIN!! that triumphant exploit made abundantly clear that the premise still had some ""juice"" in it. the long since death of Ed ""Chief"" Platt and the death in the interim of Bob ""Larrabee"" Karvelas both had the potential to be death knells, but they managed to compensate there. it took the most masterfully audactious piece of miscasting since THE CONQUERER (starring John Wayne as Genghis Khan) to scuttle this promising series.
so much of the old spirit so successfully re-established for nothing. everything else works, EVERYTHING, but one ""slip"" and the whole thing collapsed. for want of a likeable lead the appeal was lost, for want of an appeal the audience was lost, for want of an audience the series was lost, for want of a series the opportunity was lost. i'm tempted to say something about the devil in the details, but i have a sneaking suspicion that sicko Dick would take it as a compliment.
this series may well be the all-time case-in-point of something i've already stated here in at least one review: good writing is indeed an assett, but it's nothing without decent characters. you will occasionally forgive a series for substandard writing because you've taken a liking to the characters, but you will never, and i do mean NEVER, put up with characters you can't stand for the sake of ostensibly wonderful writing. this series provides a singularly instructive contrast in the established characters which still work and their letdown son who doesn't measure up.

So stop complaining that you expected the original series because you did not read before buying.

So, 5 to 6 years after the re-union movie of ""Get Smart Again"", the group decided to come back and see if they could make a spin off series work of the original 'Get Smart'; unfortunately it didn't take off, but it's nothing that they should be ashamed of, or wish they had never done.

This time around, Maxwell Smart (Don Adams) is the Chief of Control, and his son (Andy Dick) is now working for him as an inspiring agent, in what seemed to be an attempt at a passing of the torch, but Maxwell's involvement seemed to be working better then that original concept idea.

Barbra Feldon is also back as 99, and a lot of familiar faces from the series make special appearances along the short 7 episode stretch. Some say the show was not funny, but I think it was good for what it was, considering it did not have 6 writers like the original had each week.

Sure, some things felt missing from the show, like the laugh track, and not everything was good to watch, but for what it was, I think it's great to see the cast back having another go at what made them all celebrities 30 years or so before this.

For the price, I don't know how you can really complain, and sure, it can not possibly compare to the original series, but take it for what it is, and enjoy the continuation of the Smart story.

After all, the name of the game among networks is the Ratings Game---if you don't have the high numbers, then it's bye-bye.
This is what seemed to have happened with ""The New Get Smart"", which never made it beyond its first seven episodes.
It's too bad that TNGS didn't catch on, because it held promise. Don Adams (who looked more fit & healthy here than five years earlier in the ""Get Smart Again"" TV-movie) and Barbara Feldon reprise their roles as Max & 99. Except this time around, things have changed: Max is the chief of CONTROL (Lord help us!) and 99 is a congresswoman with budget ties to her old organization. Actually, they are more of supporting characters for the newly-promoted antics of their son, Zachary Smart (a typically nerdy but likeable Andy Dick). Of course, Zach is just as bumbling as his Dad, but in Dick's own comic stylings. As history repeats itself, he is partnered with a beautiful, skilled & intelligent blond partner, Agent 66 (99 turned upside down..get it?), played by Elaine Hendrix.
Some new supporting players are included: Trudy, a ditzy secretary hired as a temp who thinks CONTROL is a talent agency (!!), a faceless femme-fatale now running the evil organization KAOS, Agent Zero (a master of disguise), and Agent 9 (who is really IS nine years old).
Even some old familiar faces pop up: Dave Ketchum reprises his role as Agent 13 (hiding in a bowl of cole slaw in one episode) and even Bernie Kopell guest stars as the nefarious Siegfried, unemployed by KAOS and exacting revenge on both Max & Zach.
I loved the hilarious opening credits for this series, a new variation on the old access-to-CONTROL theme, by using a car wash as cover. This series lacks the satirical zing of the old series, but it has its moments of loopy verbal comedy & goofy gadgets, 1990's style.
Who knows what this series could have accomplished if it continued? They were barely scratching the surface of Zach & 66's partnership-relationship.

And Maxwell Smart and 99 play second-fiddle to their son and his partner, so there's not much Don Adams zing there either.",1215561600,23,582,4.7227722772277225
3386831,1,B001666484,"We'd just seen the movie, and my wife brought me this in a bookstore assuming it was the original series.  I knew it wasn't, but the front of the DVD claims ""The Complete Series"" with the title ""Get Smart"" with *no* indication that it is the remake other than the fine print ""the Smarts are Back in Control"".  This is somewhere between dishonest and deceptive, and is certainly sleazy.  Buyer beware: the real complete series is ~$200 for a boxed set of multiple seasons.  Shame on Sony marketing.",1215129600,22,497,4.613636363636363
3386832,1,B001666484,"I was initially very disappointed that the show on this DVD was not actually the original Get Smart.  I still gave it a shot though.  It may be that I was already looking at the show negatively based on my initial reaction, but the show is really not very good.  It is hard to give specifics, the show is really just bland.  Owing to the fact that there were only six episodes made.

On the slightly positive side Don Adams is still very funny.  It is also nice to see Barbara Feldon as Agent 99 again.  In my opinion the buck stops with a little bit of nostalgia.",1213833600,11,564,4.166666666666667
3386833,3,B001666484,"I came across this DVD when searching for the original Get Smart TV show, and figured I couldn't go wrong picking this up for just $10.99.  It was great to see Don Adams and Barbara Feldon get back into the roles of Agent 86 and 99, but that was probably the best thing about this dvd.

Maybe my memory is clouded regarding one of my favorite old TV shows, but I don't remember the old version of the shows effects being this bad.  For a show produced in 1995, I expected a lot more from this new series, but was very disappointed.  Many of the 'effects' were simply shown by displaying a can or tool of some kind, then cutting away for a moment and back to the 'results'.  Off the top of my head, the only thing that comes to mind was the scene where the agent pulls out a can of 'instant key' and sprays shaving cream into a doorknob.  Flash away and back, and find a solid white ball of plaster surrounding his hand.  I'm not sure why that sticks in my mind, becuase there were definitely worse 'effects' scenes than that one.

Overall, I'm glad to have found this series that I never knew existed, but I can definitely understand why it was cancelled after only 7 episodes.  Fans of the original series will enjoy it, but don't expect too much.",1213488000,5,1248,4.276595744680851
3386834,3,B001666484,"Fox had a brilliant idea in bringing back this classic series. I was so excited that Get Smart was being brought back years later in an updated version.  First, start with the surviving cast (Don Adams, Barbara Feldon -still gorgeous, David Ketchum, and even a guest shot by Bernie Kopell as the evil Sigfreid.) They also added the stunning (and funny) Elaine Hendrix as another CONTROL agent.
Their one fatal mistake was adding Andy ""the unfunniest , most annoying man on Earth and appropriately named"" Dick as 86 and 99's son Zack. In the original series Max and 99 had twins. So it could have been worse, with the aforementioned Mr. Dick playing a dual role. But had they cast someone more likeable, the series would have went on much longer. I even remember reading an interview with Andy Dick where he trashed the show when it first came out because he also had a role on Newsradio and wanted out of his contract.
So in what could have been a great reboot of the series, CONTROL was not vanquished by KAOS, but bad casting. And niceness did not triumph over evil on this sequel. Sorry about that Chief!
It still amazes me to this day why Andy Dick has a career. I've tried to watch him with other wonderful casts on Newsradio and Less Than Perfect, but have a very low tolerance level to his brand of humor. Well, to each his own, but he's ruined many a fine show for me. Let's hope his 15 minutes are up.",1211587200,75,1410,4.423076923076923
3386835,5,B001666484,"Okay, the year was 1995.  FOX broadcasting wanted to bring in a mid-season replacement, as they are known to do.  Their decision?  Dig up ""Get Smart"".

In this new series, Max is now the Chief of Control and 99, still his wife, is in Congress.  His son, Zack, is a spy and teams up with Agent 66.  (No mention is made of their other offspring, however.)

7 episodes were made.

Some of the benefits accorded the new series:
* Agent 0 -- played by a different actor each week, you never know when 0 appears.
* Most of the humor remains in the same spirit as the original
* Sharply written plots
* Good acting

Some of the downsides to this new series:
* Overtly sexual in many episodes; even the pilot has more innuendo than many of the subsequent episodes combined.
* ""Casino Evil"", a great story, is a rewrite of an original series plot.  (I don't care much for rewrites, but this one did work.)
* Stopped after 7 episodes

Highlight episodes:
* Pilot (ep 1) -- Zack and 66 investigate KAOS' attempt to steal indestructible fabric.  Ignore the innuendo, some of which does get chuckles; there's more to like than dislike in this premiere.
* ""Casino Evil"" (ep 2) -- Zack and 66 infiltrate a casino operated by KAOS.
* ""Goodbye Ms. Chip"" (ep 3) -- A KAOS agent kidnaps and brainwashes 66 to kill an ambassador.

* Wurst Enemies (ep 6) -- An old enemy of Max returns.
* ""Liver Let Die"" (ep 7) -- Zack and 66 infiltrate a KAOS hospital.  This one is my favorite of the new series; it handled the dark concepts and humor immensely well.

I'm surprised this series has been scheduled for release, but am gratified.  My VHS off-air tapings are falling apart.  I do have more than a soft spot for this series, as despite being a newly commissioned series, a lot of it really gels together.  It deserved more of a proper chance than to be axed.

Please check back later to get a rundown on DVD audio/video quality.  It'll probably be very good.",1209427200,55,1936,4.384831460674158

This is the brief (7 episode) Get Smart revival series which aired on Fox in 1995.  The series brings back Don Adams (now chief of CONTROL), Barbara Feldon (now a congresswoman), and David Ketchum (Agent 13), but the main characters are now Max and 99's son Zack (Andy Dick) and his partner, Agent 66 (Elaine Hendrix).

I was pleasantly surprised that this series managed to maintain some of the character and humor of the original series -- especially the episode which brought back Bernie Kopell as Siegfried.

And I'm also pleasantly surpised to see this short-lived gem available on DVD.

""The Craw""? Max asks, nonplussed by the man's pronunciation.
""Not Craw, CRAW""; corrects the man in annoyance. In a later episode, they finally nail the guy, and an Asian police detective with the same kind of accent shows up to collect the suspect; ""Ah, Mr. Claw--so we meet at last"".
""Not Craw, CRAW""; corrects The Claw, seemingly as annoyed by the cop's mispronunciation as by the arrest.
Then there's the infamous Cone Of Silence, meant to protect against eavesdropping. But when Max and the Chief use it, they cannot hear EACH
OTHER.
Another great gag is when Max must deal with somebody's hand coming out of the darkness with a gun. Max applies a martial arts hold on the unseen man's gun hand which requires both hands.
""There's only one way to break this hold""; declares Max.
The unseen attacker's other hand comes out of the darkness with another gun.
""That's the way""; Max admits. This series does not work in these more modern times, as was proven by a next-gen sequel featuring two new agents who work for a new Chief--Max.

The parallels and contrasts between this Cold War gem of a series and today's ""Nationless"" war with Islamic Terrorists are striking- and hilarious.  There is no political correctness, a lot of stereotyping and blatant stupidity- which of course is what makes this show so great and Don Adam's portrayal so inspired and unique in all of TV history.  Essentially this show has one message for all of us: Lighten Up and laugh at how ridiculous ALL OF US can be.

The episodes are short and snappy and the wardrobe is impeccable.  The cheesy sets are also a blast along with random cameos from stars like Johnny Carson, Ted Knight, Buddy Hackett and many more.

Sometimes you see the catch phrase coming before max does and the jokes do get a little played out- especially ""Don't tell me... and I asked you know to tell me that."" but don't lose heart- there's a genuine laugh or snicker just around the corner that you weren't expecting.

The only negative thing that happened with this is that the first shipment of the set had 2 disc 4's for the first season and no Disc 1.  A very weird production error that I imagine was not a one-off.  Fortunately, Amazon was all over it and the second I told them the deal, they got a complete replacement right away.  So when you get this set, be sure you check to make sure all the discs are there.

3386902,5,B001666484,"Smart. Maxwell Smart. The dumbest spy in the world, who fights on behalf of the forces of goodness and niceness, and succeeded in making democracy vs. communism a lot more entertaining.

And while some of the running gags become almost tropes (how often will Max repeat a plan that 99 just suggested), this clever parody of spy thrillers is one of the best time capsules of the 1960s. A lot of the comedy is dependent on Mel Brooks and ""The Graduate's"" Buck Henry, but the delicious writing wouldn't work without the brilliant  comic trio of Don Adams, Barbara Feldon and Edward Platt.

Don Adams is Agent 86, Maxwell Smart, a not-so-bright spy with an endless arsenal of strange devices and odd sayings, who survives on a mix of bravado and dumb luck. This bumbling spy works at a top-secret government agency called Control, which is responsible for keeping the free world free (very Cold War). Backing him up is his beautiful partner/love interest Agent 99 (Barbara Feldon) and his long-suffering Chief (Eward Platt) who puts up with Smart's constant mistakes.

Together with 99 (whom he marries late in the series), and the Chief (and his faithful dog Fang), Max battles the forces of badness and rottenness -- namely, the anti-Control called KAOS. They battle against their archnemesis Siegfried and a bunch of other KAOS agents, with explosive paintings, lovable robots, explosive pianos, KAOS shoe stores, evil gurus, espionage on the Orient Express, the Claw, the Choker, evil hippies, and much more.

In a sense, ""Get Smart"" is the perfect antithesis of the suave, inhumanly competent James Bond -- his catchphrases (""Missed it by that much!"") and goofy confidence somehow get him through the day. Unlike Bond and similar movie spies, Max succeeds out of luck and bumbling more often than skill... but somehow, he still succeeds.

The comic timing is a little awkward at the very beginning, but rapidly gets its footing, with lots of running gags (Larabee becomes a secondary source of comic ineptitude) and snappy dialogue (""Confiscate that plant!"" ""I can't do that, Chief. I'm not a priest!""). What's really funny is the endless spoofery -- Max is given all sorts of weird gadgets, including the legendary ""shoe-phone,"" and he faces off against all sorts of cartoonish villains. And it has dozens and dozens of movie spoofs -- ""The Great Escape,"" ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" ""Maltese Falcon,"" ""King Kong,"" and even the Bond movie ""Goldfinger.""

The political clime of the mid 1960s is all over the series, especially in the form of KAOS. But fortunately they don't get preachy -- KAOS is merely a big evil organization, no more. Some references are dated, and this definitely debuted before the era of political correctness and racial sensitivity (there's a bizarre episode about American Indians threatening the US government, and the Claw is funny if un-PC).

Don Adams MAKES this series, with his quirky facial expressions, nasal voice and odd body language. His Max overestimates his own skill and believes himself to be a sexy, karate-chopping Bondian treasure, though he survives mostly by luck (""Missed it by that much!""). Barbara Feldon is the least quirky of the cast, serving as the ""straight woman"" for Max, as well as the brains for his adventures. Edward Platt is just wonderful as the long-suffering, stressed-out Chief, who always looks slightly frayed, and Bernie Kopell is hysterical as the stiff-backed, volatile Siegfried.

It's been decades since ""Get Smart"" was first aired, but it is still gutsplittingly funny if you can get past some of the awkward racial jokes. You'll roll around on the floor, laughing yourself sick... and... loving it.",1442448000,3,3673,5.047854785478548

3386917,2,B001666484,"it was an exciting idea, and not simply because GET SMART - unquestionably the greatest series American television has ever produced or is ever likely to produce - is worthy of it's own equivalent of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION. had it caught on it just might've shook up the sitcom status-quo for the better. sitcoms were so much cooler in the '60s because just about anything could happen then, from landing on a deserted island to being one of two ""monster"" families. whereas somewhere around 1975 someone decided that the sitcom should narrow it's horizons, and it seems like every ""new"" sitcom since has found itself in the same mundane day-to-day life motif and/or rut. whatever bureacrat bozo(s) made that decision may well of been put in their place, had GET SMART Mk. II had the same punch as it's ancestor.
(for The Record, i'm not saying there's no validity to that day-to-day life approach. certainly there's tales to be told from that ""real life"" viewpoint. (see The Dick Van Dyke Show, for instance, or The Honeymooners.) what makes me nuts is the fact that that's all any sitcom even tries to do anymore.)
and since it dealt with concerns as well as absurdities that were still going strong 25 years later, there's no reason why it shouldn't of been revivable.
well, okay, there was one. i've heard more than one director say that 90% of their job is casting the right actor in the right part. the most positive thing i can say for Andy Dick is to NOT give in to the obvious dumb joke suggested by his last name. for one thing, he just doesn't fit. i suppose i could buy him as the offspring of Barney Fife, but even my flexible disbelief can't be suspended far enough to buy him as even the remotest relation to Maxwell Smart. oh yes, his limited talent was a contributing factor as well. Dick can bumble with the best of 'em, but he fails miserably to inspire anything resembling the admiration, to say nothing of affection, which Don Adams was even then commanding from a whole new audience via Nick At Nite. in other words, you may occasionally laugh at Andy Dick, but you'll never quite ROOT for him.
(the only possible excuse to be made is that Dick's brand of surrealist vulgarity was not his OFFICIAL stock-in-trade yet.)
to say nothing of lack of respect for the audience. he walked unceremoneously off the series with no warning when he was offered a part on NEWSRADIO. this constituted an upward move in his career because that show was on a ""major"" network, NBC. (remember those days when the Fox Network was still regarded as little more than a notch above UHF?) and as Fate would have it, NEWSRADIO was another mostly pretty good series wherein Dick was the weakest link in the chain.
his own sidekick, one Elaine Hendrix, has neither the beauty nor the charm of (still frickin' gorgeous) Barbara Feldon. Hendrix being just as miscast as Andy Dick, they have a curious sort of antimatter chemistry. they're a nice, cozy fit, for all the nothing that comes of it.
surprisingly good news, though. in a twist of Fate which makes this DVD worth owning in more than the historical curiosity sense, the tried-and-true elements are as potent as ever. the redoubtable Don Adams remains in top form, and Maxwell Smart's new standing as Chief of CONTROL is something he can handle in spite of still being his old ditzy self. (it's something i've noticed about ""buffoon"" characters like Maxwell Smart, Gilligan, Inspector Clouseau, Don Quixote, Lou Costello: they always seem to have some spark of brilliance they can find if we let them work at their own pace. they're never complete, hopeless idiots for the very simple reason that they couldn't carry a story if they were.) his chemistry with Barbara ""99"" Feldon and Bernie ""Siegfried"" Kopell hadn't dissipated in the least. if only they had found more suitable leads so restricting the established characters to the periphery wouldn't feel like such a gyp.
what's more, the stories make for a concerted and impressive update. consider the pricelessly titled ""Liver Let Die,"" in which KAOS engages in the then fairly new field of organ trafficking. but then, they did have Leonard Stern, the writer/producer who more than anyone else held the reins of the original series, on the payroll as ""special consultant.""
the series has it's own cool new touches. for instance the CONTROL elevator has gone from an obsolete telephone booth in an empty office building to a soda vending machine at a carwash. KAOS is now run by a sublimely sinister faceless woman. (a tip of the hat, perhaps, to the nemesis of Adams' other signature character, Inspector Gadget?) and let us not forget ""Agent Zero,"" the master of disguise played by six different actors/actresses (two apiece in each of his/her three appearances).
the series was obviously prompted by the successful as well as satisfying ""reunion"" tv-movie GET SMART AGAIN!! that triumphant exploit made abundantly clear that the premise still had some ""juice"" in it. the long since death of Ed ""Chief"" Platt and the death in the interim of Bob ""Larrabee"" Karvelas both had the potential to be death knells, but they managed to compensate there. it took the most masterfully audactious piece of miscasting since THE CONQUERER (starring John Wayne as Genghis Khan) to scuttle this promising series.
so much of the old spirit so successfully re-established for nothing. everything else works, EVERYTHING, but one ""slip"" and the whole thing collapsed. for want of a likeable lead the appeal was lost, for want of an appeal the audience was lost, for want of an audience the series was lost, for want of a series the opportunity was lost. i'm tempted to say something about the devil in the details, but i have a sneaking suspicion that sicko Dick would take it as a compliment.
this series may well be the all-time case-in-point of something i've already stated here in at least one review: good writing is indeed an assett, but it's nothing without decent characters. you will occasionally forgive a series for substandard writing because you've taken a liking to the characters, but you will never, and i do mean NEVER, put up with characters you can't stand for the sake of ostensibly wonderful writing. this series provides a singularly instructive contrast in the established characters which still work and their letdown son who doesn't measure up.

So stop complaining that you expected the original series because you did not read before buying.

So, 5 to 6 years after the re-union movie of ""Get Smart Again"", the group decided to come back and see if they could make a spin off series work of the original 'Get Smart'; unfortunately it didn't take off, but it's nothing that they should be ashamed of, or wish they had never done.

This time around, Maxwell Smart (Don Adams) is the Chief of Control, and his son (Andy Dick) is now working for him as an inspiring agent, in what seemed to be an attempt at a passing of the torch, but Maxwell's involvement seemed to be working better then that original concept idea.

Barbra Feldon is also back as 99, and a lot of familiar faces from the series make special appearances along the short 7 episode stretch. Some say the show was not funny, but I think it was good for what it was, considering it did not have 6 writers like the original had each week.

Sure, some things felt missing from the show, like the laugh track, and not everything was good to watch, but for what it was, I think it's great to see the cast back having another go at what made them all celebrities 30 years or so before this.

For the price, I don't know how you can really complain, and sure, it can not possibly compare to the original series, but take it for what it is, and enjoy the continuation of the Smart story.

After all, the name of the game among networks is the Ratings Game---if you don't have the high numbers, then it's bye-bye.
This is what seemed to have happened with ""The New Get Smart"", which never made it beyond its first seven episodes.
It's too bad that TNGS didn't catch on, because it held promise. Don Adams (who looked more fit & healthy here than five years earlier in the ""Get Smart Again"" TV-movie) and Barbara Feldon reprise their roles as Max & 99. Except this time around, things have changed: Max is the chief of CONTROL (Lord help us!) and 99 is a congresswoman with budget ties to her old organization. Actually, they are more of supporting characters for the newly-promoted antics of their son, Zachary Smart (a typically nerdy but likeable Andy Dick). Of course, Zach is just as bumbling as his Dad, but in Dick's own comic stylings. As history repeats itself, he is partnered with a beautiful, skilled & intelligent blond partner, Agent 66 (99 turned upside down..get it?), played by Elaine Hendrix.
Some new supporting players are included: Trudy, a ditzy secretary hired as a temp who thinks CONTROL is a talent agency (!!), a faceless femme-fatale now running the evil organization KAOS, Agent Zero (a master of disguise), and Agent 9 (who is really IS nine years old).
Even some old familiar faces pop up: Dave Ketchum reprises his role as Agent 13 (hiding in a bowl of cole slaw in one episode) and even Bernie Kopell guest stars as the nefarious Siegfried, unemployed by KAOS and exacting revenge on both Max & Zach.
I loved the hilarious opening credits for this series, a new variation on the old access-to-CONTROL theme, by using a car wash as cover. This series lacks the satirical zing of the old series, but it has its moments of loopy verbal comedy & goofy gadgets, 1990's style.
Who knows what this series could have accomplished if it continued? They were barely scratching the surface of Zach & 66's partnership-relationship.
TNGS is probably too obscure for the casual viewer, but definitely of interest to lovers of Get Smart.",1215907200,12,2229,4.747422680412371
