If you are able to find a copy of this alleged HD title for free and you only had to pay the shipping and handling costs, you still will have paid too much for the disk. This disk will end up as a drink coaster on my coffee table for sure.",1226620800,2,321,3.735294117647059
8239997,1,B001139ZK6,"If you want a nice forest look with saturated colors - look elsewhere. Most of the footage is shot with a foggy backround which simply washes out the screen. Since the scenes are mostly backlit by a strong sun it just bleaches the screen out. Most detail is lost and the forest scenes are boring - no amazon forest here. Also the ""mellow"" soundtrack has way to much bass & fast rythms to allow you to really relax - not that you could looking at the poorly shot forest scenes anyway. Back to the drawing board on this one.",1208217600,8,522,4.282828282828283
