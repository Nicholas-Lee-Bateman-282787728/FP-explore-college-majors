3513161,5,B001CIOCMG,"Andrew Zimmern is the intrepid host of ""Bizarre Foods"" on the Travel Channel, and I have not missed a single episode! He is a wonderful host, taking a genuine interest in other cultures, always respectful and polite, and of course, adventurous in his culinary excursions! In this collection, some of the interesting and exotic cuisine to look forward to are lamb brains and goat testicles in Delhi, and rotten shark in Barcelona. Andrew Zimmern's Bizarre Foods is a wonderful, fun way to explore other cultures and 'sample' their native foods from the comfort of one's own home! I'm a fan for life!",1251158400,4,598,4.872549019607843
3513162,5,B001CIOCMG,"My mother taught cooking - first in our home, then in a shop/school/restaurant she opened back in the 1970s. It was not unusual for me to eat sweetbreads or calves brains or raw meat back then - which gave me my foundation for a love of indigenous foods. That may have a bearing on why I just adore Andrew Zimmern and his series Bizarre Foods. He has a love of culture and treats the people who host his tours of different countries with such honor and respect. At the same time he fun, witty and charming. I find every episode of this collection as well as the first one exciting to watch. I cannot say enough nice things about the show itself as I feel there is an importance to people understanding true local foods and cultures that have not been tampered with by  refined foods that frankly -are not doing us any good at all. I would rate this series 10 stars if I could. Who knew watching a man eat fish eyes could be so much fun!",1234656000,7,936,4.229050279329609

8287804,5,B001CIOCMG,"Must state up front I really like the host Andrew Zimmern. I was noticing no one so far had listed where he went in this set. I was unwilling to purchase as most of the time this set was over 40 and I didn't know where he went.

Well got a good price and will list his locations.

8287812,5,B001CIOCMG,I got this collection for my hubby and he loves it. He actually watches how Andrew Zimmern  digs eyeballs out of sheep heads and soulfully moaning slurps them down. And that's just an example of those 'Bizarre Foods'. All together the episodes are more entertaining than gross and you can actually watch them over and over and still be amused by wiggling worms and nicely plated rotten meat. Makes me wonder what Andrews wife cooks for dinner.,1259798400,3,443,4.753246753246753
