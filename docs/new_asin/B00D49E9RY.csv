8589447,5,B00D49E9RY,"Bela Lugosi's last great film performance.  An odd film to be sure, but fun.",1434585600,,76,4.428571428571429
8589448,3,B00D49E9RY,"The film is a low-budget British 'comedy'--part of a series starring Arthur Lucan as Mother Riley--an insult to women and people of irish descent.  The humor is very low-brow and slapstick--think the Three Stooges rolled into one man in drag.

Despite this, however, the presence of Bela Lugosi-a star deep in decline looking for a new start makes this interesting.  Lugosi, alone in the cast, plays the movie straight and is actually pretty good in it.

The print is wonderful--far better than any other print I've come across.

To sum up--if you are a Lugosi completist, you have to have this--and this particular version is the best one to have.  If you love comedy, give this one a miss!",1384905600,,691,4.764705882352941
8589449,2,B00D49E9RY,"First of all, let me tell you I'm a huge Bela Lugosi fan.  I pretty much like all his stuff, from little-known silent films all the way through his infamous collaborations with Ed Wood.  For some reason, though, I put off seeing this film for many years.  I think I suspected what I eventually learned, in a painful 75 minutes, to be true: It's just not any good.

The plot (call it spoilers if you want, and you should thank me for saving you the trouble of watching this turkey) involves the character Mother Riley, who is actually actor Arthur Lucan in drag.  Apparently, he/she was a known comic personality in England during the 30's and 40's.  Aside from being the worst drag makeup this side of Madea, the character is not remotely funny.  Maybe something is lost in the translation, although I watch quite a bit of British films and television shows, so I don't think that's it.  Anyway, Lugosi plays a scientist--not a vampire as the title suggests--who's building an army of robots, one of which accidentally gets sent to Mother Riley's house.  Her subsequent confrontation with him is, again, supposed to be hilarious.  But it's just awkward, and you'll find yourself looking at your watch long before it's over.

As for the DVD, VCI didn't exactly go to great lengths to restore this one.  The picture is acceptable, maybe one step above the prints sold by public domain companies like Sinister Cinema.  The sound is also lacking; at times it sounds as though the actors are on a stage having to project their voices to reach a faraway microphone.  The only extras are optional English subtitles.  If you happen to be a fan of this movie (and please explain to me in the comment section WHY that is?), note that it also available under the alternate title&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Son-the-Vampire/dp/6305944024/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Son the Vampire</a>&nbsp;from Image and several El Cheapo video companies.  I have not seen any of those, so I can't comment on their quality.

If you're a Lugosi fan, you may want to check this out.  I give it two stars SOLEY for his presence.  Even with the atrocious dialogue, it's still Bela Lugosi. . .he looks and sounds great. But if you just want to see the horror icon slumming it, stick with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bride-of-the-Monster/dp/B000YRZM6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bride of the Monster</a>&nbsp;or one of the other Ed Wood films.",1380240000,3,2509,5.2275
