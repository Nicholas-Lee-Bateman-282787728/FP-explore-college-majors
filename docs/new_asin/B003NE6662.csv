8400905,2,B003NE6662,It is what it is. I'm sure there is more substantial production videos out there,1442361600,,80,4.4
8400906,5,B003NE6662,I thought this movie was fantastic and I really enjoyed every minute of it because of it's always amazing to see the making of a movie and all the hardworking people who work behind the camera and in front of the camera in order to make sure the film is great and worth watching. I recommend anybody who's a fan of The Terminator to buy or rent this movie because I guarantee you'll love it.,1439424000,2,391,4.226666666666667
8400907,4,B003NE6662,Good guide on some of the film's origins and special effects but I would have liked more info on how they made the future scenes.,1389225600,2,129,4.2
8400908,3,B003NE6662,It was great seeing how they did some of those scenes. I've always liked seeing that. It's also really neat to see a very young James Cameron talking about the concept of this movie.,1368144000,2,182,4.382352941176471
8400909,5,B003NE6662,"Great behind the scenes video for fans of the movie. Highly recommend and worth the price. Beware this is old footage, so the recording is not the best quality.",1360627200,2,160,4.551724137931035
8400910,1,B003NE6662,"I wish I could read the reviews to these before I watch them so I wouldn't of made a purchase to rent this.

It's just an old 80's TV special, though with some interesting information on how they shot certain scenes (The Alley chase was particularly fascinating and I don't mean that sarcastically) but it's not worth 30 minutes of your time. Pass it up completely.",1355011200,,365,4.53030303030303
8400911,2,B003NE6662,"This 22 minute ""making of"" dates back to 1984. It features behind the scenes footage and interviews from the making of the film. It's actually a good piece on the making of Terminator.

Image quality looks like a typical 80's NTSC broadcast, reportedly from the producer's personal beta tape source. It is what you'd expect from a standard-def, composite, analog source. The image appears heavily noise reduced and soft. The colours are nice and rich, though. There are no tape related dropouts or streaking that I could detect. No compression related blocking either, but bear in mind I wasn't actively looking for any such defects. They may still be present.

The producer of this program and the Terminator rights-holders, have never come to financial terms over the usage of this footage, thus it has never been included on any official release of The Terminator.

Please note that this is a DVD-R release, with no menu or extras whatosever. Additionally, the image is horizontally squeezed, appearing squashed and thin on both widescreen and regular displays. (This is most likely a mastering error where the 4x3 image was meant to be pillarboxed within a 16:9 frame, but encoded as 4x3 erroneously. Someone just forgot to add the anamorphic flag at the mastering stage. Your TV should be able to compensate.)

Buy it soon, as this may get recalled at any time due to a dispute of copyright. I'm happy to add this disc to my collection, but at $15 it's not exactly a bargain. I suppose the price may go down eventually, but I wasn't going to risk the disc being recalled due to rights issues. It is disputable wether he's allowed to release this since it includes quite a bit of in-movie footage. (At the moment MGM is in no position to challenge him legally because they have bigger problems to deal with.)",1282176000,8,1812,4.798076923076923
