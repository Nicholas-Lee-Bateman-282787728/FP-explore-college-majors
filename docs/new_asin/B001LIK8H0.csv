8318136,4,B001LIK8H0,"""Defying Gravity"" is an interesting film that's won a lot of indie awards.  The backstory is even more interesting than the movie.  The writer/producer is a first-timer who made ""Defying Gravity"" on a budget that barely reached six figures.  Yet it's difficult if not impossible to distinguish it from major independent films made for $5-10 million.  (That's roughly 100 times ""Defying Gravity's"" budget for the non-math majors out there.)  ""Defying Gravity"" is just as good as most of these films, if not better.

Rob's rating:  8 or 8.5 of 10.  Check it out.",1259884800,2,560,4.946236559139785

8318140,4,B001LIK8H0,I was lucky enough to sit in a Q and A at the Wildwood Film Festival with the director of this movie....Reading the small summary that festival provide me...I wasn't sure if this movie was going to be any good.  But it ended up being a great production. I loved how the camera picked up the colors in different scenes throughout the movie....I highly recommand this movie to anyone into indie movies...Or just into great movies in general.,1235692800,,439,4.628205128205129
