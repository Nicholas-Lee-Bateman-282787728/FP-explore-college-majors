1655516,4,B00005RIIB,"I've been a big fan of the PetShopBoys since their first album came out when I was 12.

Neil Tennant's voice in the first song (and their first hit), West End Girls, was thin-- not like his youthful chant in the original. At other times he was just reading the words, and occasionally became a reed-like drone. His exagerrated diction in the rapping of the lyrics of Left to My Own Devices will leave you either annoyed, or pleased to hear his since abandoned trademark.

However, his voice came right in Closer to Heaven and sounded delightful in the unplugged version of You Only Tell Me You Love Me When You're Drunk. From here onwards, he really sung beautifully.

Visuals tended to be appropriate, for example in It's Only the Wind, the video montage superimposed over the stage turned to a stormy sky with lightning flashes. Sometimes though, their significance to the music wasn't obvious. I personally found the overblown visual effects stimulating, resulting in a serene aftereffect. However the speed of the visuals was unrelentless, calling for more slowdowns to suit the various beats.

Halfway through the show, Young offender was the first break from Neil's voice -- a trance-inducing extended intro and a shot of a naked guy (from a movie) on the screen, who become the focus of the song. Its melancholic slow melody made for a rejuvenating interlude.

Much of the camera's attention was on Neil, including many closeups, many of which should've been on the other very significant singers and dancers. Therefore, his change of clothes was refreshing on every occasion.

The disco furor in It's a Sin was awesome, complete with church-like props and ambience, with Neil walking up an aisle to a spotlight in heaven.

More of the crowd's reaction was shown in Footsteps in the Dark where they were spellbound, right till Go West, the finale, when they were worked into a zealous frenzy.

Excellent concert overall, at least on Neil's half -- but Chris needs to stop being Chris. His withdrawn and awkward demeanor makes the PetShopBoys a unique duo but if you're gonna give a concert you need to perform for your audience, not hide behind your ""Roland"" throughout.",1018915200,,2177,4.880758807588076
1655517,3,B00005RIIB,"I have been a long time fan of the boys, and I generally have almost all of their repetoire with cds, videos etc etc. I have other dvds of theirs and I have to say that with this one, i was disappointed. I really love the boys, but it's really insane that this one got approved,( i really wonder if they did approve it or if there was just some quick talk and dash involved.. hmmm sneaky..). I wanted to see the concert, and I did attend the nightlife tour in person, and I was looking forward to reliving some of that wonderful experience. I was really shocked at how annoying and utterly repetitive the montage and overlay bits were, it was mostly chaos during some songs. I was so thankful at the parts where the editor "" took a break"" , "" backed down a bit.. "" etc. It was really kind of painful to watch, cos I saw this performance get mangled by this gaudy editing. There is a really fine line as to where the montage bits were actually relevant,and to when they were just floating out there to annoy and fill up space ( which should have been filled up with the boys or the dancers!!! ) One of the most annoying montage bits was the over use of the ""hyper mode traveling the city at night"" parts , to me that was the clip equivalent to the over use of a vocoder in songs .... aaaaaaaaghhhhhh.. I can at least be happy with the sound, it was great and the very FEW moments where i could actually see the boys, dancers and sylvia, were quite nice.  One last thing, to retour to a previous review, chris lowe has done that for years and that's just the way he is, so i don't think he's going to budge just for you. Accept him.
So, while this isn't a top choice dvd, it's still good for the audio, you should probably keep yourself busy as you listen to it to spare yourself from some eyesores.",1016064000,4,1797,4.163793103448276
1655518,5,B00005RIIB,"This is the DVD that showcases the Pet Shop Boys on there Nightlife tour...I hear that many dissapprove of the whole camera angels the graphics etc.  This is there best DVD yet, yet 'Somewhere' gets better reviews must have been the whole 'Nightlife' angel.  The only thing I dissapprove is the internet option of informing you to vist the official website.  The audio, visual qualities are extremely good especially with 'Dobly 5.1' surround sound and HDTV.  This is very much worth the price I would have paid more for it.",1014422400,,524,4.788888888888889
1655519,2,B00005RIIB,"Let me start by saying that I think that when it comes to modern dance music, the Pet Shop Boys are to this genre what Elvis Presley was to rock.  Having said that, I was extremely disappointed by this video.  First of all, when I go to see what is supposed to be a live performance, I expect just that.  Unfortunately, when you go to a Pet Shop Boys concert, the only thing live is Neil Tennant's vocal and some of the backup singers, including Sylvia Mason James.  Every track is pre-recorded, which kind of makes their performances very elaborate karaoke shows.
  However, that complaint pales in comparison with what I saw when I viewed this video for the first time.  Instead of feeling like I was close to what was going on, I felt that I was in another building entirely.  What the hell were they thinking with the images that were superimposed over the actual show.  The only reason I bought this was to see the Pet Shop Boys and the audience.  Audience reaction shots are critical to a live performance, since they are one of the few things that imparts to a viewer what it was like to be in the crowd.  And why does Chris Lowe even bother to show up if all he ever does is stand like a zombie with his baseball hat and sunglasses?  Is it against his religion to let people actually SEE him??  The producers of this DVD actually gave us two choices for the multiple angle function.  Unfortunately, they didn't include the one option most people would have appreciated:  The ability to just watch the show and the audience.",1012521600,,1531,4.437275985663082
1655520,5,B00005RIIB,"Ditto to much of what one reviewer said about this being fresh and innovative. After I had listened to the live versions of a few songs from the Nightlife tour on the ""You Only Tell Me You Love Me When You're Drunk"" single, I was disappointed with what I heard. It made me have reservations about purchasing this video, quite frankly. I had seen the previous live videos however and I knew how good they were, so I bought this. I was very glad I did. From start to finish, a superb effort by the PSB. I especially liked the video projections that helped tell the story behind many of these tracks, or at least added to the performance (good examples are ""West End Girls"" and ""New York City Boy""). The vocals and sound quality were excellent, and the backing vocalists could have sang all of those tracks by themselves, they were that good. Only one criticism and that is I could have done without the webcam video insert. Internet video quality is always poor, no matter how you dress it up. I wouldn't have wanted to highlight that in this film if I was the producer.
Overall a very good example of how PSB has changed with the times, yet stayed true to their classic pop formula. A must have for anyone's collection. BTW do not pay attention to the parental advisory label, I saw nothing on this tape that warranted it.",1009152000,4,1321,4.440329218106996
1655521,4,B00005RIIB,"Heres' what you don't get with Pet Shop Boys ""Montage-The Nightlife Tour"": * no preening, posturing, and star tripping * no self promotion of recent album, stage play, back catalog, merchandise or website * no endless, moronic banter between songs * no tubthumbing or strident sexual politicking.
Here's what you do get: * 111 minutes of soaring, melodic pop music, some of the best made in the past 20 years * innovative stage design and overlapping film imagery that enhances each of the 22 songs * engaging lyrics and charming stage persona of Neil Tennant * a ""must have"" for fans and a fine introduction to the band for anyone else with an ear for pop music. If all you know about PSB is ""West End Girls,"" their only U.S. #1 from 1986, you may be pleasantly surprised.
Sound and video quality themselves are quite good. Videotape does not merit the Explicit Lyrics Advisory that it's tagged with-there's no objectionable language that I could discern.",1007596800,11,956,4.8
1655522,5,B00005RIIB,"I viewed the VHS edition of Montage, and it has to be one of the most unique, visually appealing concert videos I have seen in a while. It is a well moderated blend of effects and back drop videos intermixed with live concert footage from thier 1999-2000 tour. I enjoyed the live version of 'Being Borring' and of course, 'Always on my Mind' is still a favorite. This is definately a video worth having for all PSB fans.",1006905600,,420,4.397435897435898
1655523,3,B00005RIIB,"Montage is a wonderful concert film, though a bit busy visually. The option of viewing the projections is most welcome; it gives a slightly different perspective on things.
The performances are quite good, though the acoustic bit in the middle drags things down a little.
The sound could be better - what is the point of having the extra dynamic range afforded by DVD if all we're going to get is the same (...) over-compressed/limited, make-it-loud-so-it-sounds-like-everything-else-out-there mastering that so-called ""mastering engineers"" have been subjecting us to for the last several years?
And a couple of minor complaints:
(1) Not all of the tracks give you the choice of viewing the background projections, so there are several interruptions in the program if you choose that option from the menu.

(2)According to the booklet, there is a bonus video, ""For your own good"", that appears ""as a hidden bonus extra...after watching the other three videos all the way through."" It's there, but I don't want to have to watch all three of the other videos all the way through every time I want to see it. Impatient types (like me) can skip this path and just go directly to Title 12, Chapter 1.",1006387200,,1195,4.945273631840796
1655524,5,B00005RIIB,"I just got this yesterday and it is the finest concert DVD I've seen to date.
For those of you who went to the Nighlife concert a couple of years back, it will bring back lost of great memories. Remember those projections playing as the Boys performed? On most of the songs on this DVD, you actually have a choice of watching either the actual concert footage/projections or just the projected video. It's awesome!
Many of the Boys' hits are included, including an acoustic version of their 1991 single ""Was It Worth It?"" (my favorite part of this concert).
Quality-wise, you will not be disappointed.... :-)",1006300800,2,608,4.745283018867925
1655525,5,B00005RIIB,"The Pet Shop Boys Montage Tour is a 2001 DVD with live songs played by the group in their 1999/2000 world tour, but almost all songs come from their US and UK venues. The DVD is as good as it could be and portrays the duo from England as one of the most important musicians from Europe.

In fact, both Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe, when wigless, look like any chief executive officer from some multinational company; but they are much more than that. They are professional performers who aptly convey to their loyal audience rather simple songs in the very same way they were recorded in the studio, alternating dramatic and profound melodies and lyrics (e.g., ""Young Offender""), with joyful ones overflowing with the exhilarating pleasure of living (e.g., ""That is the way life is""), and some even which combines  joyfulness  with seemingly harmless martial overtones (e.g., ""Go West"").

The backstage projections of slides, and images from films are a show in itself, specially the ones that stupendously backs the song ""Young Offender"", inquisitive to any one in the audience and at home.

The Pet Shop Boys are backed by the vocals of the so-called ""New York City boys"", a group of very competent and energetic black singers (and dancers), and by the stunningly beautiful voice of the black female singer Sylvia Hason-James.

The enthusiasm of the whole group radiates to the public and the outcome is sheer ecstasy almost from beginning to end. This DVD is a must both for fans of the band as for any one who, like myself, listened in the radio the songs from the group but never dared to buy anything from them for home audition. I don't feel disappointed in any way. I got what I wanted.

As a minor flip-side, some of the visual effects are sometimes outdated, as if produced some 20 years ago. But in the end, despite not being a fan of the band, I got totally overwhelmed by the sheer intensity and enthusiasm conveyed by the band.",1096675200,5,1940,4.688235294117647
1655526,4,B00005RIIB,"Wow what a great concert DVD. Those familiar with PSB songs will find little to complain about. Those who love dance music will be entertained as well.
For all those who expected a PSB concert to be a ""real-time"" jam or something, you will be disappointed. PSB are creatures of the studio, and so their live performances compensate to prevent the danger of a prerecorded feel by exploiting the wonderful live singing of Neil and their sextet of singers. But it also captivates with visual montages (some no doubt tongue-in-cheek cheesy), a more lushly layered mix to familiar songs, and with visual conceptualism overall. But we are treated to a couple of unexpected acoustical jams of familiar songs that fits great as a counterpoint to the rest of the heavily technofied concert. This DVD, I think, does a good job of representing the paradox that is PSB. They sing with emotion and honesty about the most personal things, but they drape it in a ""faux-futuristic"" spectacle of sometimes android-like delivery. Neil and Chris may look like two unfeeling clones on stage, but the lyrics Neil sings betrays that immediately. The contrast between subject matter and technique is never lost. It's just great.
More extras like interviews or a documentary on the making of such a concert would have earned it another star. But in the end, it's a raucious, beautiful, uplifting aural experience that I would not hesitate recommending.",1064275200,4,1428,4.97907949790795
1655527,5,B00005RIIB,"This is by far the best collection of concert songs ever asembled on a disc or VHS.  Great from beginging to end...Highlights for me were ""It's A Sin"" the Closer ""Go West""",1064016000,,171,4.34375
1655528,3,B00005RIIB,"I attended the US leg of this PSB tour so I was excited to pick this up when it came out.  While it was essentially the same tour (minus the entire into and a couple of song changes) there were way too many clips of other film footage and special effects added to the visuals.  I would have preferred something a little more like the Somewhere tour video where it is a straight forward concert shots but the Nightlife version inserts footage from their videos, stock footage and neo-60s effects over the images of the concert.  If you're a fan, especially if you attended the concert this might be worth getting.",1059609600,,612,4.495495495495495

1655532,5,B00005RIIB,"Being a huge fan of PSP, I recently attended their latest show, ""Release"".  I was disappointed in the show, in that there was no ""show"", unlike previous tours (the music was still fabulous, as always).  Still being on a PSP high though, I bought ""Montage"", and when viewing it, was reminded of their earlier shows and how I missed that aspect.  ""Montage"" is simply a great PSP concert video, and hopefully not the last of their stage productions.  Getting Dolby Digital sound with it on the DVD is a huge plus.  I have to say that I enjoyed ""Montage"" more than the real show I just saw!  If you are a PSP fan - get it, crank up the audio, play it on a big screen, and enjoy!",1024358400,3,674,4.2265625
1655533,3,B00005RIIB,"Pet Shop Boys release their first DVD package, ""Nightlife,"" based on the duo's 1999/2000 tour.  I absolutely adore Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe, but the concert overall falls a bit short of its previous tour, ""Performance.""  First off, the live recordings of their hits are top-notch.  But the visual presentation leaves a lot to be desired.  Neil and Chris's stage presence is almost washed out by the dull clips that accompany their performances.  I guess this was supposed to enhance the show, but it was actually distracting.  On the plus side, the standouts are the live renditions of ""Can You Forgive Her?,"" the acoustic ""Was it Worth it?,"" and the album track ""Only the Wind.""  Also, the DVD has 3 music videos: ""I Don't Know What You Want...,"" ""New York City Boy,"" and ""You Only Tell Me...""  All of them are very good and, frankly, more interesting than the concert itself.  If you watch all three videos consecutively, you'll have access to a fourth, ""For Your Own Good.""  Alas, I'm sorry to report that that clip is a bit of a snooze, so it's hardly worth the effort. (For all you sound geeks, the concert is in 5.1 surround while the music videos are in Stereo).
So, all in all, the package is a mixed bag.  The DVD is well-presented; the music videos are nice, but the concert was rather uneven.  I'd have first-time viewers search for the hard-to-get video to ""Performance,"" which is the superior concert and better represents PSB's work.  Leave this one to the diehard fans like myself.",1024185600,15,1499,4.697318007662835
1655534,2,B00005RIIB,"Ok.  I am a huge Pet Shop Boys fan.  I truly believe that Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe are musical geniuses.  When I saw this DVD, I jumped at the opportunity to see this live performance myself.  There are few moments in this DVD worth mentioning.  The live version of ""Being Boring"" and ""What Have I Done To Deserve This?"" are spectacular, but the rest is just boring.  The screen is always full of cheap-looking swirls of light and boring projections, no doubt to mask the lack of movement on the stage.  You can see the boredom of the crowd during ""Young Offender"", which is a fast-paced song.  The crowd is standing perfectly still the entire time.  Same thing with ""Vampire"".  Tennant's voice is excellent as usual, but there's just not much to look at.  The sound quality of the DVD is questionable as well.  Pet Shop Boys, unless they can spice up their performances, should stick to the recording studio where their true strength lies.",1020297600,,943,4.614457831325301
