4240307,5,B00408YYEG,"This incarnation of Flash Gordon is done quite differently, and honestly it does start off a bit slowly, but grows on you as the series goes on until by the end of season 1 I was very ecvited for the next season, but Sci Fi cancelled it. To bad because the characters were really begining to take off and story lines were getting better every week. I like the twist on Klytus and Ming was different but very well done, Flash was very beliveable as the reluctant hero as usual just another series that was shut down to soon.",1352505600,2,523,4.292929292929293
4240308,5,B00408YYEG,"Though it may resemble Dune as much as  Flash Gordon, this is a worthwile  Sci Fi adventure series which grows on you
the more you watch.  When it aired I remember thinking this is real cheesy, and yet finding myself tuning in
anyway.  A second viewing -it was better than I remembered. Now watching  a third time it dawned on me that this is actually very well done.
The characters are well developed, the humor is subtle yet pervasive, and the sets, costumes, and effects are fine . The pacing and timing are almost excellent.
The plotlines develops so you don't feel like they're reinventing the wheel every episode, and there are only 1 or 2 of the whole lot that aren't that great.
Perhaps best approached with low expectations.",1337644800,3,733,4.607692307692307

Some people take shows too seriously. I like to be entertained, this was easy to watch, and sort of reminded me of 1966 batman another show I enjoy.
Take this show for what it is,  a fun bit of fantasy which doesn't take itself too seriously and is quite easily enjoyed!",1328659200,3,429,4.296296296296297

4240311,4,B00408YYEG,If you like the cheesy Flash Gordon made either in the late 70's early 80's you will find this show entertaining.  The series had a new and different twist on the way Ming is interested in earth. I would have given it a five but the acting is a little weak in some parts.,1321401600,12,271,4.018518518518518
4240312,5,B00408YYEG,The series starts off kind of slow but gets better every week.  It's too bad that the Scy Fy channel only likes to produce boring paranormal reality shows now.  Take the time to watch this series.  It's great fun!,1313539200,17,213,4.410256410256411
4240313,4,B00408YYEG,"I find it disingenuous when this series is reviewed and derided by those who consider the ""Queen soundtracked, Sam Jones as Flash"" version to be the criterion. I consider the original Buster Crabbe version to be the true original. Compared with the original, this version with Eric Johnson as Flash is good, with no more deviation from the original than the Sam Jones version, which seems to have been a parody.

Flash Gordon in any version is not to be taken seriously, or critiqued for accuracy of science, it is to be enjoyed as a diversion of fantasy, and in that context, this version succeeds. The characters and effects are supposed to be somewhat cheesy, and the situations predictably favourable to the core characters. Those who demand a higher degree of realism have many other choices.

Unfortunately, there are those who feel they must defend their favourite version by tearing down other versions, so there were many negative posts on message boards during the series run, and many comparisons to the ""original"" Sam Jones version being protected. But there are also many who watch series to have fun, who can suspend disbelief on their own, and who consider low-tech camp as part of the fun.

No series pleases all viewers, but for those of us who enjoyed this version, an affordable DVD set would be desirable. Or, to replay the series on TV, at least.",1293840000,47,1367,4.808510638297872
4240314,1,B00408YYEG,"I'll put my hand up and admit it; I was excited. When I first heard the news that a brand new series of Flash Gordon was coming to the Sci-Fi Channel, the Nostalgia Nerd inside me thought back to the gloriously camp and wonderfully garbage 80s movie, or the action packed, spirited capers of the Buster Crabbe serials. The Serious Nerd inside me pondered what such a show would be like, sitting alongside more intelligent sci-fi reboots like Battlestar Gallactica. Would it be possible to produce a grounded, realistic science fiction show based on the bonkers adventures of the ancient comic strip hero, with rocket ships and Hawkmen and all kinds of ""Simpler-Times"" lunacy? Or would the show go all out, embrace the Boys Own adventure theme, hoping to capture the tone and attitude of the strips?

Turns out it would be a little bit of both, with a huge dollop of ""Suck"" added in for good measure.

So, it turns out that in 2007, certain plot points just aren't realistic in this oh-so modern adaptation. So no rocket ships to the planet Mongo (it's now a parallel dimension which Flash and co can hop in and out of, yeah that's much more realistic than, uh, space travel) and certain names have been altered as well. Flash Gordon is now Steven ""Flash"" Gordon (because he can run fast, plus that unfortunate incident with the brown mac and the ten year old girl, possibly) and Ming the Merciless is now, God help us, Benevolent Father, and is an obvious take on Saddam Hussein. Wow. How chin-stroking and relevant. Except the crucial difference isn't the lack of Ming's famous beard and robes from the comic, serials and movie - it's the fact this new Ming is quite possibly the most boring villain of all time. Not in the least bit threatening, intimidating or even amusing, he's just sort of.. there. He looks like your bank manager.

But then, he's evenly matched, because this reboot's Flash is every bit as dull and pointless as his ""nemesis."" I understand the character of Flash Gordon isn't exactly a famous archetype; he's not the tortured billionaire of Bruce Wayne, he's not the guilt-ridden, socially awkward Peter Parker, so you could pretty much fill in a lot of blanks in Gordon and run with it. So those blanks that have been filled in are now ""smug"", ""hateful"" and ""incapable of any emotion other than apathy."" In the first episode he ends up on Mongo, a new UNIVERSE, remember, and placed in jail about to be killed, by ALIENS, remember, and he acts like he's just nipped out for a pint of milk. He sighs, he quips, and that's it. He doesn't care, so why should you?

The other characters are just as bad. Dale is like Flash-Ette, similarly good looking, similarly sarcastic and equally hateful. Zarkov is the nervous nerd and Ming's daughter; fiery tempered and spunky in the serials and the most beautiful creature who ever walked the earth in the 80's movie (Ornella Muti, quite possibly from another planet.. she really was too damn sexy to be entirely human), is dull and pouty in this series. She, like the others, have the exact same flaw; they're the same initial characters we all know, but with no spark. You don't believe, sympathise or even like any of them. Oh, and Token Black from South Park has been added to the cast list too, providing nothing but his obvious reason for being there. It's almost like the writers of this drivel had a) never read any Flash Gordon comics before and b) never watched any science fiction television before, instead deciding to pitch these characters as a cross between Beverly Hills 90210 and Friends, all unfunny quips and pointless mugging as each tedious, stupid story pans out.

Perhaps not surprisingly, the show tanked and was cancelled after its first season, but it's not like the rot began to set in after the first 12 episodes; it was dire - positively DIRE - from the very first episode. If it didn't have the words ""Flash"" and ""Gordon"" in the title I would have switched off after the first episode (hell, the first twenty minutes). I actually survived past episode 3 which SFX Magazine described as ""possibly the worst episode of anything, ever."" In fact, I lasted right up until the end of episode 8, until I found myself sobbing into my hands at the thought there were still 14 episodes left to go.

It's a damn shame. It had the budget, it had the potential audience, it had decades of potential storylines to take inspiration from and it had a full season run. Far more deserving shows had much less to work with before they were binned before their time. To re-write several key elements of a comic strip for being ""dated"" and then hampering the show with characters and dialogue worse than an episode of He-Man is baffling. Filling the show with bland, boring performances when history has provided the exact opposite is just galling. A waste of time, money and a potentially great franchise.

Flash Gordon 2007 could have been great. With better writers and cast it could have taken key elements that made the original great and evolved it into a relevant, intelligent piece of science-fiction. Or it could have given us enjoyable romps a la Xena or the BBC's Merlin series. It did neither, and ended up a boring, idiotic mess that made you believe (British joke alert) the writers were from Ming's home planet, or as we like to call them... Mongoloids.",1285459200,30,5340,4.680511182108626

4240328,4,B00408YYEG,"I was very dubious of this vision of Flash Gordon when it first came out and made an effort to miss it entirely for many years. From what I heard about it, I wasn't satisfied that it was a proper take on one of my favorite SF characters.
 Then I then read the Flash Gordon Omnibus which had Dale as a tough and cynical space administration reporter, Dr. Hans Zarkov as a hard drinking (Oliver Reed style) scientist/inventor and Flash as a family disappointment playboy, shown more as an adrenaline junkie frat boy, then a humble human. And it worked! All three stepped into the crazy and tyrannical world of Mings universe and crashed the party like you hoped they would. So, based on that retelling of the tale of our blonde hero and his friends, I thought Id give the 2007 TV series a shot.
 I enjoyed it far more than I thought, but certainly there were problems and if a second season were to be done, changes would want to be made. I really enjoyed Eric Johnsons performance as Flash, it worked for me on all levels. The innocent, naive boy that somehow keeps that innocence and honesty without seeming too sugary good. Yes, he was reckless at times and seemed to depend on the universes will to save him when he got into really tight spots. But Eric was charming and animated as Flash Gordon.
 Gina Holden as Dale Arden - the tough and cynical general news reporter who was as aggressive at saving herself, or Flash, as you would want, and not just a screaming girl who is always captured and has to be rescued. Karen Cliche as Baylin was the fish out of water element, but worked out well without being too goofy, or too hard nosed. Rankol, Aura, and Flashs mother were also good characters and worked well in the series.
 But not all is milk and honey in this version and what really hurt the story and probably disappointed a lot of Flash fans, was how Ming, Hans Zarkov, and the inexplicable addition of a throw-away character in Joe Wylee, Dales cop fiance, were presented.
 Ming came off as nothing more than a corrupt company CEO who didn't really give menace to his scenes and just simply didn't work as a merciless ruler. Sadly John Ralston simply did not inhabit that role to give it any screen presence. His Ming character, as it was, could have easily been a captain of the guard, or bodyguard to Ming and worked very well. His interactions with his daughter Aura were forced and awkward and it was here that Aura didn't really track well either. The two actors had no chemistry when they shared scenes together and it just slowed everything to a crawl. Where Aura was a fine duplicitous villain when she wasn't talking to her father, Ming was never a believable ruler of all Mongo.
 Zarkov was a joke, and a bad one. Scared of his own shadow, feelings of persecution, paranoia, socially awkward, mumbling and scattered brained, this version of our favorite scientist is simply a disaster. He played more like Munson, the cowardly assistant, to Dr. Hans Zarkov in the 1980 film. Thankfully they toned down many of his annoying traits as the series progressed, but he never became a believable scientist who could be the go-to tech jockey for Flashs team. Most of the time you wanted to either slap him, or tape his mouth shut. Fussy, irritable and more a Keystone cop than a serious man of science - Zarkov was as disappointing as Ming.
 Joe Wylee. Why? Did Dale even need a romantic interest besides, or in addition to, Flash? No. Did Joe have anything, at all, to add to the story? Sadly, he did not. He didn't advance the story, provide any spice or do anything that was actually necessary because, simply, his character was never needed in the story at all. Flashs mother seemed to have less screen time, but was more interesting as a character, than our hapless police detective. I argue that even if you remove him as a romantic place holder and just leave him as a Mr. McGee/Hulk type cop who is trying to find out the connection to the crazy happenings around town - hed still be unnecessary as written. Joe just comes off as a jerk - all the time and has no redeeming qualities that make you give a fig what happens to or around him.
 So, if another season was to have been made I would have suggested the following. Ming, as John Ralston, isn't actually the Ming the Merciless - hes a poser who took advantage of a power vacuum in Mings court and the real Ming returns with all the menace and charisma of Max Van Sydows characterization in the 1980 movie.
 Zarkov gets his mind zapped by accident when hes trying to rewire some of Mongos devices to assist Flash and, well, it butches him up so hes not a sniveling coward like Dr. Smith from Lost in Space. Im not talking a transformation from puny to Conan, I just want the phobias and social disorders to be gone and Zarkov to start using his mind for science instead of babbling incoherently.

SPOILER ALERT - Depending how you read the parting comment.

 The real Ming and Aura should have chemistry between the actors such that she can rise above the Miss Parker Daddy Syndrome of the TV series The Pretender. As for Joe the cop? Well, that issue is resolved in any case. Just don't introduce another needless character in season 2.",1448582400,2,5214,4.5

The worst sin any movie, book, music, tv series can commit is boring and this is deadly dull. Cheap, stupid, ill-concieved and dull... and the worst- forgettable.

4240344,4,B00408YYEG,"The Sci-Fi Channel isn't well known for their greatness when it comes to first party productions. While Farscape, the underrated Invisible Man, Eureka, and Warehouse 13 were exceptions to this, the rendition of Flash Gordon didn't quite have the same flair. There were plenty of predictable plot points. Eric Johnson grows into the role as the series progresses, but he seemed to be drawing more than a bit from his role as Whitney on Smallville. Dale Arden is a character I found rather void of depth and frequently used as more a plot device than true participant. Ming was more of a simple ""jerk-like"" villain rather than really having the nuance the character needed. On the other hand, Baylin's ""fish out of water"" antics are great fun (arguably the show's highlight) and Aura's character is interesting (and stunning on screen), but the real show stealer is Rankol, who gets the nuance down well and does a better job of keeping the audience guessing than anyone else in the series.

I gave the product four stars for two reasons. One for content; while not bad by Sci-Fi Channel standards, there's still something to be desired. The other is that the DVD set is a bit anemic. The discs come in a stack in the case; they aren't individually locked in. There's almost no bonus features at all. For the price though, I wasn't expecting a Lord of the Rings anthology.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a series to be done with in a short amount of time that isn't meant to be taken seriously and can put up with a few paint-by-numbers characters, it's most certainly worth the weekend binge.",1428105600,,1598,4.703571428571428

4240348,4,B00408YYEG,The series is a wee bit camp but overall it's good viewing. Flash is the son of a scientist who dissapeared while creating a dimentional rift. Flash thinks his father died in a labrotory fire until the ruler of the planet on the other side decides to send a probe to Earth. Flash finds out the truth and goes to find his dad. He and his companions move back and forth between dimentions. The show derives its storyline from the comics but it is not near as complex. The series has a resolution but no conclusion. The main story arch is wrapped up by the end but the series could have gone on. One has to wonder in what direction it would have gone. But which ever way it went it would have diverged more from the comic strip. The special effects are good but this is not a special effects driven show.

4240362,1,B00408YYEG,"I guess I'll never learn. The Sci-Fi (or SyFy, or whatever) Channel has created some of the most awful dreck that I've ever had the misfortune to waste time on. I don't have cable TV at home, but I occasionally have the ""opportunity"" to partake of it when I'm visiting relatives or in hotels when traveling. I almost never find anything on SyFy worth watching.

This ""Flash Gordon"" series is a case in point.

I checked the DVD set out of the public library, expecting to be able to spend a couple of pleasant days binge-watching a show I'd never seen. I was wrong. I only got through six episodes before I gave up.

Everything about ""Flash Gordon"" is horrible. The cast members, a bunch of 20-somethings who all look the same to me, have little skill in their craft. Their attempts to act are laughable, and they offer nothing with which the viewer can connect with or care about. The special effects are so cheesy and amateurish that they beg description. The inter-dimensional portal (""rift"") is fairly well done, but don't look for any state-of-the-art CGI here. Everything on the planet Mongo glows with lurid red light that does nothing but conceal some of the cheese. The rendered landscapes and the city look like someone cranked them out on a low-end PC in an afternoon between energy drink breaks. The characters are abysmally stupid and/or annoying. The story line (I hesitate to use the word ""plot"") could have come from a five-year-old child.

The only thing this series has in common with Alex Raymond's classic ""Flash Gordon"" comic strip, with the old black-and-white Buster Crabbe serials, and even with the 1980 cinematic release, is the characters' names. The producers of this tripe could not have done worse if they'd named them Dick and Jane.

It's no mystery to me why this series only lasted for one season of 22 episodes.

4240366,4,B00408YYEG,"It must be noted that this DVD set is definitely done on the cheap. It has 4 discs, stacked in the case, with no slip case or series information. The discs don't even have chapter menus. It's as bare bones as you can get, but there's a certain advantage in that, as it sells for a very low price. Ultimately, all I wanted were the episodes themselves, and the picture and sound are just fine.

Flash Gordon was a massive failure in terms of ratings. It's easy to see why, as the early episodes are quite poor. I remember watching this in 2007 and not being sure why I kept tuning in each week. It seemed amateurish with the word ""inept"" coming to mind more than a few times, bottoming out with a Weekend at Bernie's parody/tribute that just didn't work at all.

But something unexpected happened, after the series had alienated most of its potential fans and sunk to the bottom of the ratings: It got good. It got very good.

When the action shifted more to Mongo, the characters found their rhythms, and the show's ambitions came into focus, Flash Gordon blossomed into an adventurous, intriguing, exciting series. It's a shame that it happened too late to be saved. This complete series, which is just one season, tells a great story arc, but I wonder just how good it could have been had it been given even a two or three season run.

In retrospect, the early episodes are funnier than I had remembered, mostly because I can see the humor in context now, rather than as a worrisome set of episodes as I originally had. The music is also frequently very fun and well chosen. I don't expect most people to seek this out, but if you happen to be patient enough to get through some early mistakes, this is a very affordable option for 22 episodes of entertainment.",1416096000,,1763,4.46583850931677
4240367,5,B00408YYEG,"I gave this for THE EFFORT! I am downloading this to watch as I have time so I haven't a clue BUT what kills me is this show, the current reviews, show the same stigma of EVERY DAMN REMAKE I have ever seen from Batman(s) to Knight Rider and The Bionic Woman. I'm not someone who travels the country going to ComicCons and couldn't care less what these comics did in 1930 or whenever man read these by fire! Example: Knight Rider 2008 captured THE ESSENCE of the 1980's version (that I own and watched religiously). Of course, this was a continuation rather than a straight re-telling but people grew ticked because The Hoff wasn't more involved, etc. The remake of The Bionic Woman was GREAT but suffered several blows such as a writers strike and then those that ragged on it because if differed from the 70s version. SO WHAT!

We had three solid Spiderman movies then because morons cried that they didn't follow THE DAMN COMIC BOOK now we are plagued with 2 more...and I'm sure at least another to come and what's pathetic is the re-telling of the same story from a slightly different slant and different actors.

Some of us appreciate creative license and an update. I can watch the George Reeves Superman and the 80s ones. The latest was two and a half hours I'll never get back of my life and even downloading for FREE I felt like I deserved compensation for my time! Now the same idiots are doing Superman -vs- Batman...really???

My point is STOP LOOKING FOR DISCREPANCIES from the 1930s or 1950s, whenever versions and just enjoy these interpretations with an open mind. Maybe if people did these damn things would only last one season! As a non-comic book guy I LOVE CW's Arrow and hope you morons that scream about variations don't screw it off the air as it is now in it's third season and one of THE BEST shows on TV!",1415750400,,1830,4.48948948948949

I enjoyed the series and recommend it to people who can appreciate it for what it is. This is an enjoyable bit of entertainment you can watch with your whole family.

Please remember,  this is a Canadian series filmed on a modest budget. Do not expect ""movie quality"" special affects. it is unfair to compare this series to the 1980s movie version - which had a considerably higher budget.

 The series updates several aspects of the story -  to make it more contemporary. Flash Gordon purists will no doubt be offended. Many people, however, will find the contemporary story line much more east to follow.",1409356800,,713,4.672

4240404,3,B00408YYEG,"Not a terrible show, not a great show. The writers took their liberties with canon previously established in earlier incarnations of FG. While there seems to be attempts to create ""real"" explanations for certain characters or situations (e.g., the flying hawkmen), it then goes on and has pure sci-fi elements, including the main one, which is traveling through a wormhole that is a bridge from Earth to Mongo and back. The show initially spends too much time on Earth, where the overwhelming majority of previous versions of FG had Flash on Mongo. Also, while Ming is certainly built up and played as evil and heartless as you'd might expect, it is played by a caucasian actor, where Ming has traditionally been portrayed with Asian features, let along his name (Iron Man 3 made a similar move with its key villain, The Mandarin, although there are other things to debate there and not the point of this post).

FG came on SyFy on the heels of the end of the Battlestar Galactica reboot, which left a big hole for scifi fans. BSG was a scifi drama that was well grounded, even with all its scifi elements, while FG had too much of a campy flair at times, which is why I think people pretty much rejected FG as a replacement. FG suffered from its departure from previous canon: it's primarily supposed to be about a hero from Earth experiencing adventures on an alien world; there is a bit too much time spent on Earth in this incarnation, and that may have been dictated by the show's budget, and even time spent on Mongo looks cheaply rendered, but if you're going to take on a property like this, either go all in and deliver what is expected or be prepared to see fans receive and react to it accordingly.

4240420,4,B00408YYEG,"Flash Gordon was a popular 1930's comic strip by Alex Raymond and ended its run in 2003. In 1935 it became a weekly radio series. The comic made its way onto the small screen in the live-action 1954-1955 series and the animated 1979-1980 series. Three more short-lived cartoon series followed in 1982, 1986, and 1996. Flash even made it on the big screen in forty serials between 1936 and 1940. The comic is more famously known for the 1980 box-office flop that featured a soundtrack by Queen, but over the years it has been become a cult classic.

Flash Gordon returned to television on Sci-Fi (now known as SyFy) for the 2007-2008 live-action series. It was released on DVD in Canada in 2009, but it was unavailable in the United States until Mill Creek Entertainment released it on DVD on Tuesday, which I received a free copy in exchange for my honest review.

The series followed Flash Gordon's quest to find his lost scientist father, who had disappeared when Flash was only a thirteen-year-old. His father's former assistant Dr. Hans Zarkov informs him that his father didn't disappear. His father had found a rift between space and traveled to another world called Mongo. Along with his ex-girlfriend reporter Dale Arden, Flash travels to Mongo, a world ruled by the dictator Ming, who controls Mongo's only water supply. Flash and Dale soon befriend Baylin, who helps them try to stop Ming.

I recall catching a few brief moments of Flash Gordon when it originally aired, but it didn't catch my interest as I kept comparing it to the cheesy 1980's film. I thought I would give the series another try by watching the entire 22 episodes on DVD. I have to say that it takes several episodes for the series to become actually watchable. The first half spends way too much on Earth, unlike the second half that shows more of Mongo. The cast has a lot of chemistry, but the dialogue can be a little juvenile at times. My favorite character is the warrior Baylin (played by the beautiful Karen Cliche). After watching the complete series, I actually liked the series as a whole, especially for the ""Source Water"" storyline in the latter episodes. The series got better with each episode, but sadly it ended in a cliffhanger. There are no extras on this release, but each episode comes in crystal clear, which surprised me considering there are only four discs. Overall, I think Flash Gordon is an underrated science fiction adventure and I do hope it finds a new audience on DVD.",1366243200,17,2866,4.731313131313131
4240421,2,B00408YYEG,"Let me start off by saying I am a big fan of Flash Gordon. not just the 80s movie, but also the Filmation animated series, the orginal comics, and even the Buster Crabbe serials. I even own reprints of orginal Sunday comics. now i did not expect this series to be exactly like those. I don't mind a little diversity. however I found that this series failed on every level for me. Eric Johnson was a bit bland as Flash, Holden a so so Dale Arden. Dr. Zarkov was okish. Hooft was uninspiring as Aura. the few decent characters were Balyn, Rankol, and Prince Baron. their characters were fun to watch. now i don't need Ming to be a cackling villain. but still Ralston didn't seem to inspire menace for me. also Hawkmen without wings!! I can not overstate just how wrong that is. now its not just bland actors that put me off. now i did not expect the show to be total redo the old stories, as the Filmation series did. but i did expect some more action packed stories. which i feel this show lacked. i think what annoys me most of all is that the series takes place all on Earth and the heroes only visit Mongo on occasion, and most of the time deal with things that come from Mongo. this irritated me to no end. it's basicly 'creature' of the week stuff. where the characters have to deal with something from Mongo coming to earth and putting a stop to it. only on a few occasions going to Mongo itself. this most of all is why the show failed in my eyes. Flash Gordon should always be set on Mongo. ANY story not set on this planet, and there have been many, is not a represntation of the concept. it should be in the same vein of Edgar Rice Burroghs. where the hero has to fight to survive with nothing but his bare fists, his wits, and his physical strength. THAT is the Flash Gordon of the first comics, the animated series, the serials, and yes the 80s movie too. flash should be stranded on Mongo fighting for his life. that was the first concept. many comics, show, have taken that away and they failed. the only successful attempt to my eyes is Defenders of the Earth. but that is just the only one. this new show, shown first on SciFi, failed in that. hence my low ratings and review. if you enjoyed this series thats fine. if you are a fan of Flash Gordon the orignal i say avoid this at all costs. instead check out the comics, even the animated series,and yes the 80s movie too. or the old serials. each are far better repreentations of the Flash Gordon story.",1363651200,65,2470,4.27991452991453

This latest version of Flash, I had to stop watching after episode 4. It was too slow, not well written and just didn't seem to have direction. it was clearly a Canadian production of no value.

The characters were not as they should be. Flash was a small town marathon runner (small town? should have been world renown!) Zarkov was a bumbling buffoon scared of his own shadow, instead of a fearless genius. Dale was a small town t.v. news reporter (again with the small town). Ming was a dictator. Not especially maniacal or self-entitled. The special effects were just bad, and the story...well, it had no focus and went nowhere. The costumes and make-up were dreadful. Very 80's, and not good 80's at that!

I guess I'm just gonna skip to the middle and see if it gets any better. will update this review if then it changes my mind.

Thank goodness i bought this over the internet (sorry Amazon) for $15 bucks. No big loss. Curiously, it was very impressively packaged! my recommendation, buy it at a rock bottom close out price, rent it, or save your time and money.",1357776000,8,1406,4.585657370517929

The special effects are current and modern and entertaining. The quality of the image and sound also excellent. I am happy and satisfied with the product.",1517529600,,334,4.982142857142857

I guess I'll have to keep looking.  This series is ok, but nothing great.",1506816000,,250,4.3478260869565215
