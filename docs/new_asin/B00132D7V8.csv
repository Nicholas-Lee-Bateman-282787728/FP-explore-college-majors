Alas, on the other hand you have the other 3 movies which are not as good. You have the John Wayne Gacy film (with a cameo from Firefly co-star Adam Baldwin) which is very lame in it's delivery. You have the Jeffery Dhamer film, which is the least gory of the 4, it's mostly about his homosexual affairs and I really lost interest half-way through the film and the final film about Ted Bundy was just your standard serial killer movie.

Overall this package gets a 3, for the fabulous Ed Gein and the nice digi-pack packaging. It's definitely worth the 7 dollar price tag.",1324512000,,713,4.281481481481482

Please Amazon don't recommend this kind to me again.  It was better to watch them on the news.",1213488000,2,278,3.981818181818182
