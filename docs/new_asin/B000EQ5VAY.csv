8113235,4,B000EQ5VAY,"In Me Quiero Casar/I Want to Get Married(1967 or 1968), the sweet and lovely Angelica Maria plays Jane Friedman, a ""gringa"" woman on vacation in Mexico. A good looking heart surgeon, Pedro(Alberto Vasquez), makes a bet with his friends that he can seduce Ms. Friedman. However, as Pedro really starts to fall in love with Jane, he feels guilty about what he's doing! Will Jane and Pedro live happily ever after?!
 Angelica Maria(she was born in Louisiana, USA) can speak fluent Spanish and English and she does a credible job playing a Caucasian woman from the USA. It's also fun to watch Vasquez and Maria play soldiers in Pancho Villa's army during a campy fantasy scene! Super sexy Malu Reyes co stars as herself in the film. She must've been like a Mexican Jane Mansfield or something. In one scene, she dances in a bathing suit during a party; what a killer body she had! Also, the party has an energetic, instrumental pop song by El Klan. Every time I hear it, I want to shake my booty! The film also has a solid music score by Sergio Guerrero; although, he recycles some stuff from Romeo Contra Julieta. Me Quiero Casar is a fun, breezy comedy that'll kill 88 minutes.",1207958400,,1175,4.595238095238095
