1862834,4,B00008W2T0,Suspense with a little taste of action .Not as fast paced as I would like to see but a pretty good movie overall.,1397001600,,113,3.9565217391304346
1862835,4,B00008W2T0,"I like action so I liked it. It was ok. No big surprises but the story was good. The people believable, realistic mostly. I would watch it again.",1389484800,,145,4.214285714285714
1862836,2,B00008W2T0,"Just OK.  Decent performances, but no real surprises. The kind of movie you feel you've already seen a few times.",1389484800,,113,4.65
1862837,4,B00008W2T0,"Nothing spectacular, but did have a good story line and kept my attention until the end.  Would suggest to watch.",1389139200,,113,4.65
1862838,5,B00008W2T0,"Good movie. Action-packed.  Good movie-night flick.  Decent storyline. A lot of buffering with Amazon, so ended up watching on Netflix though.",1388707200,,142,5.714285714285714
1862839,5,B00008W2T0,"EXCELLENT MOVIE ABOUT A FAMILY ON VACATION ABDUCTED BY A MAD CRIMINAL. THERE ARE MANY PLOT TWISTS THAT ARE PROBABLE, AND THE UNEXPECTED ENDING IS QUITE GOOD. THE GOOD GUYS WIN IN THIS ONE!  RQ",1376956800,,192,4.485714285714286
1862840,1,B00008W2T0,"Seems to be a promising movie in the starting but slowly the feeling dies
Bad Acting..
Bad Action..
Not worth of time.",1368489600,3,118,4.409090909090909
1862841,1,B00008W2T0,"One star given because the story does have a beginning, a middle and an end, and the camera was pointing it the right direction (most of the time). Seriously, I think my head would explode if I tried to watch this again. Paint by numbers 'thriller' in that (in)famous Canadian Cinema Verite Style (that makes about as much sense as this movie). Some seriously wooden 'acting', and some of the most contrived plotting you will ever see. I'm saddened to see Michael Madsen (a guy I like alot) in such garbage, but it seems he is really a 'C' level actor who occasionally gets to act with the big boys. Take a pass here my friends.",1245801600,6,628,4.422413793103448
1862842,3,B00008W2T0,"This isn't such a bad flick. I get every Michael madsen flick that they put out and even though I'm a huge fan of his i must say alot of flicks are garbage, but this one is isn't too bad made in Canada for alow budget, and still they mnaged to pull off some cool action scenes, some very cool motorcycle chases, and some very big explosions.",1107302400,4,341,4.104477611940299
1862843,3,B00008W2T0,Ok movie,1426636800,,8,3.5
1862844,3,B00008W2T0,"Not your typical Micheal Madsen movie he is the good guy in this one ,he better as the bad guy and the Movie is little predictable",1425945600,,130,4.038461538461538
1862845,4,B00008W2T0,Very good.,1425945600,,10,4.5
1862846,5,B00008W2T0,I thought it was a solid movie! I wouldn't normally rate it 5 stars but the average  3 stars that everyone else gave I believe is underrating!,1422316800,,142,4.2592592592592595
1862847,2,B00008W2T0,"I was entertained, but neither the plausibility, scripting, production quality, cinematography, nor acting is likely to have won any awards.  My standards are that one star means I'm sorry I watched it and I recommend against it.  Two stars means I'm not sorry, but I definitely wouldn't do it again.  Three stars is what most movies get.  This one is definitely a two star movie.",1420416000,,380,4.8

1862860,1,B00008W2T0,just plain stupid.  too many unrealistic scenes.,1405123200,,48,5.857142857142857

1862862,1,B00008W2T0,"Watched this one because of Michael Madsen.  He has played the roles of interesting characters in other movies that I found good or acceptable.  In the pile of movies I've watched here and on Netflix lately, this is the 1st to inspire a review.  This movie is absolute garbage top to bottom.",1398556800,,291,4.5576923076923075
7987288,3,B00008W2T0,"As a big fan of Madsen and Rutger Hauer I keep hoping to find other GREAT movies they made other then the few big ones and it seems
like they just never made them! Here's another one by Madsen and while it's not as bad as others it's not very good or great it's OK. He
does play the 'good' guy in this one and it's a good plot but the writing and directing ruin the movie. Madsen plays it cool as always but he
seems to be just going thru the motions for a paycheck and who can blame him it's better than getting a real job. I watched this free online
so didn't have to pay for it so it was a good movie on a lazy afternoon. It's typical cable tv type thriller with no surprises unless you've never
seen these kind of movies before. Madsen was and is a 50's cool James Dean Robert Mitchum type actor who needs better roles.",1438819200,,823,3.993939393939394

7987291,5,B00008W2T0,Pressure Point is a great thriller without having to hear profanity. We really enjoyed it.,1432857600,,90,5.066666666666666
7987292,2,B00008W2T0,The director of this Canadian export should have a few fingers cut off for presenting so many scenes that show characters behaving so stupidly it makes no sense whatsoever.  Best example: the cop who approaches a known getaway car with a killer and the back window clearly shot out but does not radio in what he is doing and approaches the car without getting his gun out.  Note that the Canadian government seems to subsidize this crap.,1431734400,,437,4.662337662337662
