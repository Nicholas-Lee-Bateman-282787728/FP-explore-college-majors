5299546,4,B009AMAKWM,I absolutlely Loved it. They got it on the first try unlike twilight. I thought the casting was perfect even though I was a little skeptical when the characters were first released. Everything was almost exactly how I pictured it when I was reading the books. Very excited for the dvd.,1377129600,3,285,4.607843137254902
5299547,5,B009AMAKWM,I saw this movie yesterday on opening day. It was amazing  i really enjoyed the film and loved that it was similar to the books. I can't wait till the DVD is released!!!!,1377129600,4,170,4.151515151515151
5299548,5,B009AMAKWM,"I think the negative reviews being spewed by jaded critics are extremely unfair. Just because this genre isn't your taste does not make it 'bad'. As a fan of YA lit and fantasy, this hit all the right marks for me. I loved Jamie Campbell Bower as Jace, and I was impressed by what the filmakers managed to fit into the two hours. The actors playing Simon and Isabel were fantastic as well. Great score/sountrack, fast paced story, several funny one liners, and cool fight scenes.

I hope the mean spirited attitude of the critics does not ruin the box office gross for this. I think reviewers want to blast anything YA these days because they OD'd on twilight. This is very different and it's a shame it's being lumped in with it. I do hope it does well and gets a good following on DVD/digital release so we get sequels.",1377129600,226,821,4.437086092715232
5299549,5,B009AMAKWM,"This is my favorite book series after Harry Potter and Twilight, so I had high hopes for the movie and it didn't disappoint. I thought it was very faithful to the book and while I wan't sold on the casting at first, Lily Collins, Jamie Bower and Jonathan Rhys Meyers, among the others, were cast perfectly. I loved the action scenes and there were some jump out scenes that were cool and the graphics were great. This is definitely one of the best movies of the year. Also, this movie is for more than just the fans of the series. My friend didn't want to see it and now she is an addict who is going to buy all the books. Will definitely be buying this!",1377129600,5,654,4.198412698412699
5299550,5,B009AMAKWM,"This movie is a true adaptation of the first book by Cassandra Clare that's enjoyed phenomenal success ""Mortal Instruments:  City of Bones"" and this movie takes place in New York City, with Brooklyn being a very prominent part of the story.  The movie follows the book very well, the special effects are fantastic, but the characters are really someone you can relate to.  Clary, the main character, who's thrown from a very boring normal teenage life to a wildly weird supernatural world where you have witches, warlocks, demons, werewolves and even vampires and where nothing (and no one) is what it seems.

I really enjoyed this movie - I found the action nonstop and the special effects just made it more real for me.  For a fan of the book this movie is a must-see, but even if you haven't read the books, you will probably enjoy the movie and understand it.",1377043200,10,863,4.651315789473684
5299551,4,B009AMAKWM,"Not so bad for the Book Readers.

I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. But as I was one of the book readers, I did of course dislike it to a point.

As I watched the movie, I was looking at it from two different point of views. Book Reader and Casual Movie Goer.

Overall, I enjoyed my experience. Though there were many scenes that were horribly altered to make it work.",1377043200,5,366,4.2

5299698,5,B009AMAKWM,"Just finished the movie. Now I wish they'd come back out with another movie, but since the movie didn't get high ratings when it was in theaters I doubt. The movie was good but the TV series Shadowhunters is way better on so many levels. P.S- I need to get ahold of the books so I can read them.",1518393600,,295,4.016949152542373

5299771,4,B009AMAKWM,"Not able to obtain the tv series from free form channel on DVD.  I decided to purchase the movie version after seeing it on the Fox network.
I have to admit I am impressed by it.  Although the storyline strays a bit from the books.  ( so does the tv series). It stays fairly true to the plot. And what's interesting that the weapons used in the movie also appeared in the second season of the series on the  freeform network.  My guess the seraph blades in the first season appeared to star wars lightsaber like.  And didn't want any issues with Lucasfilm although freeform and Lucasfilm belong to Disney.  I think it's a very good alternative to the freeform version.",1514851200,,668,4.471074380165289

5299774,1,B009AMAKWM,Took a great story and completely mangled it.,1512172800,,45,4.75
5299775,1,B009AMAKWM,"Bela (Clary) and the werewolves from Twilight fight the vampires from Underworld led by her Waterworld possible father who is after the Holy Grail of the Da Vinci Code. During the turmoil, Clary (Bela) falls in love with her brother from the Games of Thrones (the incest guy there, I think the idea came from it). She's fifteen years old.

They go after a Chinese gay kind of dark Merlin to find a cure for Bela's mother, Sleep Beauty. Sleepy Beauty drunk a poison and fell asleep. She left the Holy Grail of the Da Vinci Code quest with her witch neighbor from the Harry Potter school.

 After finding the Holy Grail, Bela and her brother (and lover) go after their Waterworld father. He is a Nephilim from the Book of Enoch dressed in a cheap gang outfit.

The place looks like the building of The Sanctuary, and the subterranean level is loaded with small boxed graves organized in tall shelves. From that comes the name City of Bones, but it is only a large cemetery. Cemetery of Bones.

Bela's father tries to kill her and her brother. The couple is helped by a girl dressed like a hooker (not the real heroine) from the Hunger Games, and by a boy who's in love with Bela's brother, and by a nobody mundane who is bitten by a vampire, but he doesn't become a vampire. But it doesn't matter at all, the cameraman just spots the teeth holes in his chest... The nobody mundane is Bela's best friend (mundane = human = inferior). The Chinese kind of Merlin comes from nowhere to cure the boy who's in love with Bela's brother. He just came.

The Holy Grail purpose is never revealed. Sleepy Beauty is never kissed to be awakened. The nobody mundane saves the Hunger Games heroine from dozens of demons and vampires by pure luck, and I don't see them anymore. The Chinese gay Merlin and the wannabe lover of  Bela's brother also disappear without any resolution. Then Bela pushes her possible Waterworld father through a pool in a wall which is never a interdimensional portal, (it is something...) and he explodes. At least the water pool has something to do with the Waterworld possible father... Both are related to water, eh... I mean, he has the braids.

The story ends with Bela holding onto her (possible) brother's waist on a motorcycle ride and both thinking, ""should we, should we not?"".

I can't wait for the sequel...",1511049600,,2329,4.565947242206235

5299914,4,B009AMAKWM,"It's a pretty good story. I haven't read the books, but as a stand alone story it's not bad.

I'm not so keen on the one guy having a ""love interest"" on another guy in the story, that doesn't seem necessary. One other thing that really urks me above anything else in this, is why have werewolves at all in this story? The one character makes a point to call on his werewolf buddies only to have them slaughtered, for the most part in the end! What's the point of that?

Otherwise, it's a pretty good movie of those fighting the undead.",1499040000,,535,4.235294117647059

The acting in this is terrible, there is no chemistry between the actors that play Jace and Clary, NONE, Valentine was portrayed all wrong, and if I hadn't read the books before watching this movie, I would have no idea what was going on.  It's like they're LARPing.  It was rushed and very disappointing.  Lily Collins is a beautiful and talented actress and her talent was wasted on this movie.  I WANTED TO LIKE THIS MOVIE.

5299996,2,B009AMAKWM,"Weaknesses:
1) This story required much more background and character development.
2) Some actors seemed to be miscast.
3) Some of the sets looked like movie sets; in other words, not real
4) Relatively poor acting, direction, script throughout.
5) More for the teen crowd, and more in the production standard of a mid 1990s film
6) I couldn't identify very well with any specific character
7) Too many borrowed elements from many other better told stories.

Overall, with all of these faults, I just couldn't suspend my disbelief and be drawn into the story. It is entertaining on some level but I wouldn't recommend for an experienced older 50s+ viewer.",1494288000,,655,4.900900900900901

While on the other hand, it does leave you wanting more. Additionally, it's hard to watch different Actors play the characters I have come to know via the show on TV. All-in-all it is sound movie which would be suitable for children as young as age 12. I would recommend this if you enjoy fantasy, mixed with just a hint of a love story in the background, focused on an ongoing series which may- or may not - be continued since they now have the show on Free Form.",1482278400,,595,4.228070175438597

But that's just me, and I'm okay with this.  Future me -- don't watch this again -- too schmaltzy too stupid too trite too slow too too.  Lots of good CGI but without a script to make them zing.

5300906,1,B009AMAKWM,"If I could put zero I would.  I loved the books.  I loved the movie.  I hated this series.  I wanted to like it, I tried to like it, I made myself watch all the episodes in the hope that it would improve as things went along.  Didn't happen, on all counts.  What was the budget, I wonder, that had the swords looking like a light up plastic toy one would buy in kid's aisle of WalMart?  The clothes couldn't have been any tighter and while I generally don't mind, the sight of the mother/institute director in a skin tight dress that looked incredibly uncomfortable was not a good choice.  And let's be real, the stiletto's when fighting?  One can be sexy and tough but some things are just ludicrous.  The special effects were not that great and the actors weren't either, most notably the actress playing Clary Sage I'm sorry to say. I can't decide if it is her acting that was terrible or the director who should have been making sure everyone was coming across as believable.  The only saving grace I found was Magnus Bane.  The actor portraying him did and excellent job and so this ended up being the one character I could like and wish to see more of.  Funny, I wasn't so fond of Magnus in the books, but the actor who portrays him in the series totally changed my mindset on the character.  Even with that one redeeming character I feel that I wasted my money on this series and I regret it.  I won't be buying any further seasons if they are renewed....I think I'll just stick with the movie.",1473465600,,1501,4.348920863309353

5300908,4,B009AMAKWM,"First, yes I read the books first.
Second, overall character casting was well matched for the books.  Which of course make it much easier to follow the chain of events through out,  not so much if you don't have the back story.  Too bad the only continuation will be through the washed out tv version.
This could have moved past to wrap up the second and third book.",1473206400,,366,4.352941176470588

They are FUN to watch that's all that matters :) So I Highly recommend this movie!,1461110400,,495,4.276595744680851

This movie kept the main plot from the books, but it was rushed a bit. Overall, it is a movie that I can watch over and over again and thoroughly enjoy it. While some acting bits are a little off key for me, the actors themselves did a great job with portraying the characters, especially the one who played Clary, and Clary's mother.

I just finished the first book The City of Bones in 2016 (which of course I was instantly obsessed with and completely in love with all the characters) and then I realised there was a movie adaption and watched it immediately after finishing the book.

I am sad that they are not continuing on with the movies. I hate that. And I am not sure if I am going to watch the TV series or not. Maybe after I finish all of the books.

I actually thought the actors were great that were chosen for each role (okay I felt Alec & Isabel were a bit too old & Magnus Bane's acting was awful but he looked the part perfectly-but none of that once made me dislike this movie).

I was thrilled to watch the book come to life on screen. And I loved the chemistry and portrayal of affection between Jace and Clary.

I felt the movie followed along with the book quite satisfactory with, of course, some of its own twists that I found made it interesting and entertaining.

I seriously wish they would have continued on with making the movies. But at least I have this one in which I can't wait to watch again!",1459468800,,1122,4.248826291079812

I'm so irritated that they decided to make a TV series (more money I'm sure) instead of making the 2nd movie with the original characters.  The TV actors are good but the chemistry isn't there like in the movie.  It's been a while since I read the books which was after watching the movie so I saw how the books differed from the movie but the series is too different for me and I can't seem to get into it.  I think a series that is based on a book should be more like the book not just bits and pieces of it.

Not that different, but without the same sense of constantly impending doom that pervades the book. Demon onslaught, check. Reminders of the demon onslaught at every moment, absent. Thank you very much.
So if you forget the books or didn't read them, the movie is a pretty enjoyable fantasy movie. I'd recommend it to an age range older than 16.

It changed from a sort of decent movie into a TV pilot made for 12-13 year old girls. It did not help when one of the characters said he was over a thousand years old but his behavior and dialog demonstrated he was really about 15 years old.

5303069,5,B009AMAKWM,"A thoroughly under appreciated rendition of this story. The actors who portray the characters more than make up for any liberties the screenwriters took with the plot of the book. Also in terms of effects, costuming and atmosphere, this film does not disappoint. Those who had a problem with this film will be sorry they didn't embrace it when they have to settle for the under cooked and limp noodle that ABC Family will be serving up soon as ""Shadowhunters,"" an ill conceived, lackluster,  shallow misconception of the series which will be all we have to look forward to as a live action version of this wonderful universe. I think it's important to separate books from the films that are made from them, or else you would never be able to appreciate a film told from a book ever again!! This one is a far more faithful interpretation than some of the Harry Potter films, in my opinion, so I really don't understand why it wasn't a success. Unfortunately, the public and the critics decided to pan this lovely film, and now we are stuck with a vastly inferior product, instead of the sequel to this film with these wonderful actors that we will never get now. Ugh!!! I am so sick  of people being too picky to appreciate a good thing when they see it. Do yourself a favor and ignore the less than favorable reviews. Give this film a chance. You won't regret it. You'll only regret you missed it when it came out, like I do.

5303138,5,B009AMAKWM,"If you have seen my other reviews, you'll know that I'm a Scotsman and I am pretty blunt and totally truthful in my opinions! So, avoiding spoilers, I liked this movie! Enjoyable to watch, not too much blood and gore but some good fights interspaced between some quippy lines and story background fillers. British stars made it (IMHO) much better as the standard of acting was very good overall and the scripting to me made sense.

If you are looking for blood and gore, nudity, foul language, bad acting or vulgarity - you're out of luck! Imagine Witchblade, Vampire DIaries, Wolfblood and Buffy all in one package and you'll get an idea! All good fun and I thoroughly enjoyed it! Worth the price!",1450569600,,698,4.67479674796748
5303139,5,B009AMAKWM,"To be completely honest Cassandra Clare is my favorite author. I love her books and I have every single one that's been published. I have her new book preordered. I don't expect movies based on books to be perfect and accurate. Just look at the Divergent books versus the movies. The Insurgent movie is NOTHING like the book. That being said people really need to lighten up with their ratings. Being a total fanatic for the books, I honestly love the movie. I wish they were going to make another one instead of a TV show. It's a really good movie. Yea the actors were low budget actors but who cares I think they did a great job with the casting.",1450569600,,648,4.363636363636363

5303174,3,B009AMAKWM,"I've read most of the books in the series. This movie is pretty ""eh"". That seems to be a problem with books that have so many details. It just doesn't transfer well to movies because it would take too many hours to include everything. I can see why there was never a sequel to this movie. There just wasn't much to get excited about because the movie left out so much of the book. I would probably think the movie was better if I hadn't already read the books. So, if you haven't read them, then by all means you should give the movie a try. If you have read them, you'll be disappointed.",1449100800,,588,4.166666666666667

Since this is going to be a show on ABCFamily, after seeing the movie, I am now looking forward to the show.  I only hope they keep the feel of the movie in the tv show.

What I love about this movie is that it may sway differently then the book but it still felt like it had the same similar story line but in a uniquely new path or adventure being played out. If you read the book you can see where the movie is almost like a new story all together as it leaves out or changes character dialogue yet it still has a way to entice and bring you into it. The cast and crew did an excellent job with this movie, Do not expect it to be exactly like the book or you will be setback, instead look at it in a new way of telling the story. I would suggest getting both the book and the movie, as the book explains more detail but the movie helps you to follow and fall in love with the adventure.",1446768000,,877,4.017142857142857

5303386,5,B009AMAKWM,"Arrived in shrink wrap, in brand new condition as was described. I saw this movie in SyFy Channel recently, and decided I had to have it. I don't see why this series isn't more popular than the Twilight Series, considering it has everything that Twilight has and then some; add to the vampires and lycans, fallen angels, demons, alternate universes, half-angel heroes keeping the world safe from Demonic Oppression, and an interesting though complicated love story between one half-angel demon hunter, and the female protagonist. I didn't feel like I was watching a teenage angst movie, as was the feel from Twilight (which is why I haven't bothered to watch beyond the mid point of the first movie). I really, really like Catherine Clare's ""The Mortal Instruments"" series, and have ordered the book as well.",1446076800,,808,4.992592592592593

Sector A is the United States, Canada, and Western Europe.  Sector B is for Eastern Asia and Africa.  It just wouldn't play in my BlueRay Player.  Why didn't they check this before they sent it to me.  I read all these books and really liked them.  Now I have to wait longer to watch the movie because I have to send it back and hope they have the correct Sector A movie to send back to me.  I also had to pay for the postage to send it back.

With the right producer and actors, this could have been a fantastic set of films but I feel that it was rushed or not properly thought out....perhaps, as one person mentioned, the budget was so incredibly low that they were unable to do more.

That aside, the criticisms made by movie critics are true: the plot is unclear, the characters are underdeveloped, there's some really bad acting (e.g. Magnus was horrid, sorry), the changes made to Valentine and the ending were unnecessary, and I had a hard time understanding the actor who portrayed Jace. I have never had a difficult time with accents & everyone else in the movie spoke clearly, but darn if I needed captions when he spoke! Because the characters aren't fully developed & the script is lacking, the relationship between Jace and Clary doesn't work.

5303902,1,B009AMAKWM,"So many issues, where to begin??  Let me start off with a disclaimer; I read the book and as such had expectations going in.
As I have read books and then watched the movie versions before the bar was not terribly high.  Sadly I was still disappointed.
Issue 1) Volume modulation:  If you can hear what they are saying you will be deafened when the action picks up.  (I got the On Demand version through Amazon, I don't know if an actual physical DVD would perform any better)
Issue 2) Spoiler Alert: If you have not read at least the first 3 books and have any desire to do so, DON'T WATCH THE MOVIE.
Honestly I disliked this execution, of a story I really enjoyed, so much that I don't know that I am capable of even a semi impartial evaluation.  But if it helps at all I regret that I didn't instead rent it on Redbox so I might have only wasted $1.",1439164800,7,852,4.170731707317073

I couldn't stand the main character in the book, but Clary is better portrayed in this movie.  I think there is a lot happening and a lot of things became jumbled and uninteresting.  Also, the characters don't flow evenly with their own personalities.  Example, Clary seems to be annoyed by her mom's very exsistance, but the next scene she's all attentive and worried with her mom like she is the mature one of their relationship.  Same with Jace, seems like he's annoyed and disgusted by Clary and a few minutes later, he's yelling at her for being embarrassed about their love.

The fight scene between Valentine and Jace in the library---not in book.

Magnus (Gao) & Jace (Bower) were excellent in their roles. Actually all the main characters were great. I read the series again, picturing the cast from the movie as I read. It was great. I know I'll watch the TV Series, but it won't be the same.

I am convinced that it didn't do well at the box office because they didn't advertise it enough. it was a marketing fail. I don't remember any trailers or anything, and i go to the movies frequently enough that i should have seen something for it. also the Jace and Clary actors date in real life so it makes the on screen chemistry very believable.",1433289600,,720,4.255474452554744

5304290,2,B009AMAKWM,"My wife and I have been waiting to watch this.  Waiting because we wanted it to be free.  So after some drinks we decided to rent it, just for the hell of it, and see just how good or (more likely) terrible it really was.

So...

Production Value:  Yeah, they spent some money on this.  Sets are pretty nice.  The institute is reminiscent of Hogwarts, just without any of the personality to really bring it to life.  CGI is not top of the line but they're trying.  Costumes are a little ridiculous at times but I've seen worse on people in real life.

Story:  There's actually a story here.  It's trying, to some degree.  But it's hampered by some truly crap-tastic exposition dumps and terrible dialogue/character decisions.  It's not well done and quite frankly, it's rather tedious.  It hits multiple tropes and memes that are staples in the action/fantasy/romance worlds, which means its retreading territory others have already covered and much better than this movie ever could.  They also like to pull some of the standard story gags and they all just fall completely flat.

Acting:  Stiff and generally underwhelming.  I'm not sure if it's the actors or just the material they were given to work with but it's pretty Mediocre.  Overall score of MEH.  Let me be clear, it's not terrible.  It's just generally forgettable and uninteresting.  The love parallelogram is so completely underdeveloped that's it's laughable whenever we get to a point where a character should be faced with a choice/hard decision/tough conversation with their interest/their competition.  It's all telegraphed without any real development and then your supposed to buy into the bigger scenes because...well, just because.  Too bad you're not given a reason to care about any of the characters.  Also, random sprinklers?  Really?  Not sexy, just cheesy.

Overall:  The books are probably decent?  I don't know. I've no intention of reading them.  I'm not a huge fan of when fan-fic becomes published.  Too many holes and stolen plot devices that never quite fit together.  The movie is pretty blah.  I'd recommend waiting until it's free cause it's definitely not worth the rental price.  That'll probably be another year or so as they try to milk all the money they can from the YA fans who love this series so much.  This movie just isn't worth your time until it's free on Prime or Netflix.

Side note:  If you've seen the D&D movie I feel like the stupid over-the-top scenes in that hot mess give you a good primer on the sort of shtick to expect from this poor mess.",1432857600,,2554,4.810623556581986

5304293,2,B009AMAKWM,"At best this is average, for a reader of the novels this is a disappointing failure. Not only does the movie treatment veer off of the core plot, but the actors fall flat. There is a lot of talent here, Aidan Turner, Jaime Bower and Jonathan Rhys Myers not to mention Lena Headey. All of them wasted with flavorless performances and Lily Collins waters down the bland story even more. In a rush to jump on the book to movie craze this treatment fails.

The characters, however, were not as well developed as they could have been (you were left not feeling much for them).  Also the actors/actresses portrayal of the characters was spotty at best.  The relationship between Jace and Clary lacked believable passion (I actually found myself cringing at their kissing scene).  Overall, it was okay.

5304477,1,B009AMAKWM,"This movie was AWFUL!!!  I'm a fan of the books, but the movie was just terrible.  If you didn't know all the information from reading the books then the story made absolutely no sense.  Here are just a few of the things wrong with the movie:  Simon drank something at Magnus Banes' party that turned him into a rat, then the vampires took him in rat form with them (some say assuming he was one of their friends), that's why they went into the hotel to rescue him - Now I understand that they had to cut some stuff down to make the movie shorter, but the whole sequence then was just confusing.  The scene where Clary and Jace kiss and are walking back from the garden and suddenly Simon is in her room, Ummmmm wasn't he just in the infirmary?  Then all of a sudden they are fighting?  Hodge making the suggestion to Valentine to tell Jace that he is his son!  WHAT???!!  Why?  Never happened.  And Valentine.....what the hell was that?  Why did he have weird braids and always wear a leather vest with no shirt under it?  He was supposed to be this amazing leader who could convince anyone to follow him and he raised two young boys while simultaneously plotting to take over the world.......ummm that grease ball they had playing Valentine was laughable.  Who's following that guy?  Why would anyone be tricked by a wanna be motorcycle gang member with braided rat tails all over his head?  This is the description of Valentine from the mortal instruments wiki page: At six feet tall, Valentine was described as a formidable man with a wide chest and thick muscular arms. Considered handsome and good-looking, Valentine had an almost triangular face with a hard, pointed chin, black eyes, and hair so fair it was nearly white.  NONE of those qualities were in that actor portrayal of him.  There are so many things that I could write about - Hodge letting demons into the Institute?  Clary still keeping the cup?  The portal situation?  I just can't even....",1429747200,12,1961,4.577586206896552

The actor for Valentine is too young looking and his character is lacking composure and oozing way too much crazy. He's supposed to be a charming man. He also is supposed to have more of a voldimort style unravel so that for a good part of the initial story there's mystery building around whether or not he's actually still alive..... It gives him a haunting ghost type quality until he actually makes an appearance.  The movie doesn't leave that to question, rather it's about as subtle as a face punch.  The details of plot Dev over several books like valentine's experiments, or if he's actually alive and real, are shared too early.  Most importantly valentine is supposed to have gotten the cup successfully and that is important to the plot Dev for the books and for future movies.  Also there's no mention of forsaken or idris.  I shouldn't immediately know who sent the thugs and forsaken are supposed to be more mindless.

Also Simon is used to quickly translate over the new information needed about the shadow hunter world but that suggests that he was actually welcome there which he really wasn't.

The actual story is so rich and unfolds so well, to mess these sorts of things up suggests directorial and screen writer incompetence.

It was exactly by not taking these sorts of creative liberties that allowed the Harry Potter, twighlight and hunger games movies to feel like the same stories were still being told.

My only positive is that the casting for Simon, Clary, Jocelyn, jace, and Luke were fairly well done.",1429142400,,1641,4.828571428571428

Seeing that ""Mortal Instruments"" was released in 2013, this family was disappointed there isn't a sequel to this film yet.

We completely don't even cover that he becomes a vampire or why, followed up with NO greater demon, and we end with a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ENDING. Valentine doesn't get Jace or the mortal cup... and on I side note... Why on god's green earth does Valentine have a weird rat tail braid?

This was hollow, the story was an interesting idea but I never developed an attachment to any of the characters or a real feeling for the development of the story. Maybe this is just the foundation for a much better on going story and had issue of being a ""background"" story but all in all I was sorry I finished it and didn't turn it off after 30 min but I kept hoping that it would either be so bad I could revel in how bad it was or that it would draw me in, never happened. It was just, well meh!

To all of you that are going to post in response to this, please don't waste your time.

5304753,1,B009AMAKWM,"Some people love it, some people don't.  I definetly was not one of the ones that loved it.

The movie started alright and did really well sticking to the book (mostly.  Some things, like Pandemonium I shrug off, cause time restraints) but it stuck well.  It was clear that the person who did the movie at least read the books (Jocie drinking the potion after calling Clary, I loved that so much!) but it was right around here that things just sort of...stopped following the book and started doing it's own thing.

The actors protraying Jace, Alec, Clary, Simon, Jocie, Luke Isabella, all did fantastic job of bringing the characters from the book to life on screen!

However, Valentine and Hodge were terrible.  Valentine in the book was calm, collected and three steps ahead of everyone else.  He was charismatic and charming and I was really hoping to see that.  Instead I got a maniac with no sense of self control and was two steps behind everyone else.

Also, the actor who played Magnus was terrible.  Magnus was very flamboyant, blue hair, cat like eyes, sparkles, sequences, over-elaborate outfits.  Instead, you get a guy with eyeliner and black robes.  I was depressed seeing my favorite Warlock dumbed down and portrayed so poorly.

If you liked the book, you will be disappointed in the movie.  If you have not read the book, stop watching this movie, and go read the books.  They are fantastic and you will save a fair bit of money on this adaptation.",1423958400,4,1466,4.690196078431373

I have yet to see something they rave about and most times I don't watch the whole thing.  Look at what happened with the Sixth Sense and My Big Fat Greek Wedding.  They were ""rated"" poorly, but most people that ended up watching them loved them.  I have watched this movie at least 5 times so far and will continue to view it when I am in a ""fantasy mood"".

I am blown away by the acting, costumes, characters, and storyline. Vampires, werewolves, Nephilim, warlocks, and more abound in this movie that reminds me of a cross between Underworld, Hunger Games, and very tiny amounts of The Matrix. Buffy the Vampire Slayer meets Kadniss(Hunger Games) in a VERY big way. A young lady finds out her beyond human heritage and is introduced to a whole new world of angels, demons, and all sorts of other astral beings that are either very good...or very bad. She also finds out that her protector might not be the one she should be falling in love with for, shall we say, a reason right out of Star Wars(hint without spoilers!). This is what I would call Underworld for teens. Do not let that fool you though; this movie is action, action, INTENSE action and then, more action. Very original story even though there are many similarities to Buffy or Hunger Games. ONE OF THE BEST FANTASY FILMS I HAVE EVER SEEN. I am 44 years of age and this ranks in my top 3 best! Outstanding CGI, outstanding special effects and animation, outstanding script, outstanding fight scenes with everything from werewolves to warlocks, outstanding acting, and just that good old fashioned bang for the buck factor in droves and spades!

However after I watched the movie I read the books and I do understand why some people were unhappy but when a book is made into a movies alot of things are left out or possibly  changed. Regardless, I believe this was an awesome movie and the cast was perfect. I hope somewhere down the line a sequel  is made because I love to see the actresses  and actors reprise their roles!!!",1421107200,,620,4.385964912280702

5304937,3,B009AMAKWM,"I am very sorry that I have to give this movie such a poor rating. I have read all the books, and was excited to watch the movie. I was even inclined to judge it more favorably after I read that the movie did very poorly. Caring for the underdog. Unfortunately, I can see why the movie did poorly.

If I hadn't read the books, I would have no idea what was going on. Literally no idea. The movie doesn't explain anything, and the tremendous detail and back story is what makes the book compelling. Speaking of compelling, I didn't find enough dialogue between the characters to create any sort of compelling relationships. When Clary and Jace kiss, I felt it was very premature because they had barely spoken to one another. Every other relationship and event is underdeveloped. Granted, I know this is a common problem for book to movie adaptations. But I really feel that nothing was explained. It wasn't clear, for example, that the werewolves were rescuing Clary. The purpose of Mortal Cup and Valentine's mission was barely explained. Who Hodge was and what he did was barely explained. What Jocelyn and Luke did in their past was also unclear. What Jace believes about Valentine is unclear. I really feel that someone who hadn't read the books would have no idea what was going on.

Also, a lot of things have been changed from the book. One thing that bothered me was that the vampires looked like monsters. They were supposed to be beautiful people, not ugly. And the entire last part of the movie is completely different than the book.

Anyway. The costumes and set were beautiful. The casting was perfect. I really thought the characters looked the part, though their acting was so so. Sometimes ok and sometimes bad.

Again, I hate to give it a bad review but I was disappointed.",1420416000,5,1790,4.6372239747634065

I haven't read the book and don't really have an interest to do so. I thought the film was great. The plot was easy to follow; the characters were very likable; the set was nice (flipping back and forth between ""modern"" and ""medieval"" in some scenes); the CGI effects weren't overly done either, giving it a ""natural"" feel.

We're all used to movie adaptations of books being mediocre in comparison to the books...BUT COME ON.  No wonder this movie was a flop.  The acting leaves a lot to be desired and I didn't feel the same chemistry on screen between the characters as I did in the book.

While it is not a bad movie, there are a lot of loose ends that never get summed up in the end. It felt like too much of the movie hit the cutting floor before release and because of it the movie suffered.

For some reason Hollywood producers still think they have to fit everything into 90 minutes or less or else they are going to lose the attention span of the audience. If a story/plot/content is good ppl are willing to sit for more than 90 to 120 minutes. Hollywood needs to stop chopping movies because of their fear that ppl cannot concentrate on something for more than two minutes. They are already sufferring from lack of imagination but this blipverting of movies these days is hurting them even more.",1415232000,,798,4.503448275862069

Don't get me started !  But still optimistic that they will fix all the short comings zeggers was kinda OK but not the Alex I envisioned. Simon get some muscle and more backbone like the book.!

This is how I know them (correct me if I'm wrong) valentine is evil, clare main character, jocelyn clares mom. Jace clares love interest, and then old dude who plays clare, werewolf guy family friend, nerd boy who is clares best friend, girl with cool snake bracelet, boy who hates clare and is cool snake bracelet girls brother. Then there is a cup that does nothing, a Harry potter wand made of crystals that makes really cool tattoes, a portal that is dangerous to use and no one can use it but clare, a romance that last one minute and a love triangle that last 20 seconds, a fight scene that takes forever. Then the unanswered questions, a vampire bites nerd boy but he never finds out and his eyesight is the only thing that changes, clare is a girl with super awesome powers but the only thing she does is make tattoes that the book doesn't have and she can put and take thing out from pages, valentine tells Jace and clare that they are brother but it never clear whether they are or not and also if they are not then we're is clares brother, is clares mom going to be okay.

5305605,4,B009AMAKWM,"My attempt to describe this movie without giving anything away:

This movie wasn't bad. I'm always interested in seeing how books translate to film, and overall, this didn't fail. It wasn't completely spectacular, but if you've read the book(s), I'm sure you'll find it interesting and gratifying to see this interpretation.

What I liked:
1. The actors did a pretty good job. I thought they were true to the characters in the book.
2. Effects were well done. I could tell that great care was taken with some of the camera angles, which I appreciated.
3. No major ""over-exaggeration."" I was afraid this movie was going to be stupid, which would have been easy given the story, which successfully walks a fine line between creative and silly. Thankfully, nothing in the movie crossed into silly, either.

My problems with it were:
1. the storyline felt very rushed - not just the progression of events, but even the dialogue. The actors seemed like they were racing to get words out as quickly as possible, like they were being timed.
2. Wasn't crazy about the changes to the storyline. I feel like this story requires continuity. The climax of this movie was very different than the book version. It wasn't terrible, but it makes me nervous for the possibility of future movies. Did they deviate too far?
3. A little too much action: there wasn't enough down time between action scenes, which is probably why this movie felt rushed. Even action films need to breathe a little. Let the characters develop.",1408579200,5,1504,4.7992277992278

5305618,5,B009AMAKWM,"Love this film!  And I'm in my late fifties.  It's kind of a ""Harry Potter"" meets ""Twilight Saga"" but much more sophisticated.  The plot is more complex and the characters much more varied and interesting.  I've already purchased the video and watched it several times.  I can't wait to see the rest of Cassandra Clare's books in ""The Mortal Instruments"" series come to film.  Highly recommend!",1408406400,,394,4.893939393939394

5305620,3,B009AMAKWM,"Today I got to go see The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones.  Now, there is just no comparing the movie and the book.  All of those who have read the book will notice quite a few differences between the two.  If you think this will really be a problem, then don't go see the movie.  As a whole separate deal, the movie was good.  It had plenty of action, it was funny, scary, and a little cheesy.  I could have done without that little bit of cheesiness that they added, but overall a pretty darn good movie.  But please don't take your little kids to go see this movie.  Those demons in it were scary.  Period.  They looked like something that mutated out of a Resident Evil movie.  Talk about nasty and creepy.  And yes, Clary seems just as helpless in the movie as she does in the book.  One little thing though.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers has a serious hair problem.  It may seem like a little minor thing, but his hair is just wow.  And not in a good way.  Picture a cross between Joe Dirt and Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean and you've got it.  Yes Jonathan Rhys Meyers your hair is causing you a 5 point loss in cool points.  It was downright distracting.  There is some redemption for him though.  He did act just as crazy as Valentine seemed, maybe even a little more so.  Jamie Campbell Bower was a very good choice for Jace.  As we have seen before, he can play the part for someone who is a dark character.  And even though he is one of the good guys, you can also see a little bit of dark and dangerous still and it really works.  The only character I was truly disappointed in was the one of Magnus Bane.  I was hoping for a more flamboyant and out there persona.  That is not what I really got.  Yes you get to see him in his underwear (don't worry his little ""outfit"" is really hilarious), but he isn't all the glitter and glam and outgoing warlock we see in the book.  And if you have never read the book, then you might be more than a little horrified about Jace and Clary's relationship at the end of it when they find out some rather alarming news about themselves.  But, on the upside, the fight scenes are amazing and the nasty, scary demons really give the movie an edge.",1408320000,,2197,4.211538461538462

To anyone else, I imagine it was okay. Even in parts wherein it would have been perfectly simple to maintain the storyline of the book (like attempting to dye Lily's hair bright red), they changed things. Okay, maybe I'm being nitpicky about chronology, but then they move HUGELY important scenes to entirely different locations? And what the heck - let's change the whole ending while we're at it. I seriously wonder whether the book's author was even there throughout the majority of the filming.

5305658,4,B009AMAKWM,"I stumbled across this movie and thought it sounded interested.  I didn't know until after I'd watched it that it was based off a book/series of books.  So I watched it without any expectations.

This is basically a fun movie, with some good special effects and fight scenes.  The premise is that there are these Shadowhunters who are here to protect the human world from demons, Shadowhunters being of the blood of an angel.  There are also vampires and werewolves (of course!  What sf movie these days doesn't combine the two?) who are also trouble, though the main focus of the Shadowhunters remains demons.  The city is also rife with witches and warlocks.

Clary is a young woman who starts drawing this odd sigil and then she goes out to a nightclub and sees something no ordinary human (or mundane) should be able to see.  She gets dragged into this dangerous unseen world by Jace, a Shadowhunter who is one of the main love interests, along with Clary's more geeky (at first) friend, Simon.  When she goes home, she discovers that her mother had been kidnapped and everyone wants this special cup that her mother has hidden.  Clary discovers her own inner powers along the way, along with seeking to get at her buried memories.

Interesting idea in that drawing runes on their bodies causes them to be able to work different magic.  Familiar faces as Clary's mother is played by the actress from Game of Thrones and the bad guy from The Tudors.  I wish both of them had had a larger part in the movie.  This really seemed like a potential first movie of many, probably an attempt to spark another Twilight sort of hit.

I'm interested now in trying the books to see how they compare.",1407196800,,1691,4.605351170568562

5305698,2,B009AMAKWM,"I am a huge fan of these books and was very excited for this movie. However, the movie is never as good as the book so I went into the movie thinking that. And I was right.
The best part of the movie was ROBERT SHEEHAN who plays Simon. He was perfect! The perfect comic relief, the perfect third wheel, and also the best person to look at. The woman who played Isabelle was the next best part but she lacked the 'oomph' that makes her Izzy. She did alright. Kevin Zegers (Alec) would have been terrible expect for his hallway scene with Clary and the 'look' with Magnus. It certainly redeemed him.
Other than that awful, awful, terribly awful acting!
Let's start with the worst: Jamie Campbell Bower, which is painful to say because I have liked his acting in the past!
PLEASE, if you make a second movie, KEEP HIM AWAY FROM IT!
Let me start this by saying, I was one of the people that went into the movie wanting to see Jamie be Jace! I loved him in the trailers and loved the look of him in pictures I saw with him as Jace. I don't know what happened though, he was AWFUL! Boring, emotionless, stiff, he goes through either these awkward long pauses or almost cuts people off with how fast he speaks. It was weird and made me cringe. Also, I don't know what it is about Jamie but something makes me want to punch him in the face every time I see him. And yeah, that's how Jace is supposed to be, but at least Jace in the book is charming and witty! I don't know why Clary would like this Jace.
Now onto Lily Collins, I have never liked her acting. Honestly, I haven't. I personally thinks she gets by on her gorgeous face. In every single shoot she is in, her mouth is open. Even in the poster it is! It reminds me of Kristen Stewart. I hated her performance.
Next up, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. HE IS THE SECOND ACTOR I WANT TO STAY FAR AWAY FROM THE SEQUEL! He plays Valentine, the most evil shadowhunter there is, and he is awful. Yes, Valentine is supposed to be scary, but he is also supposed to be smart, endearing, manipulative, and cunning. He isn't supposed to be yelling and look like one of the freaking kids! And, for the love of all that is holy, cut the dreads! He looks like a stupid pirate!
I could go on and on about how terrible all changes are from the book but there isn't enough time.
I give it 2 stars. Would've given it one, but I loved the book too much to do that.",1406505600,,2387,4.191304347826087

In the book he's full of life and self-confidence, but his movie persona is pretty morose. The actor also much too skinny and frail to convincingly play the part.",1405468800,,510,4.730337078651686

A New York teenager (Lily Collins) recovers memories that open her eyes to a supernatural world mere mundane mortals can't see, dragging her into a centuries-long battle between good, evil and everything in between.

What did I think?

This is the latest in the line of supernatural teen romance flicks aimed at the post-Twilight audience  and yes, its also based on a popular book series. Fortunately, it stacks up pretty well against Twilight and others of its ilk with a stronger plot, less angst, better special effects, some great action sequences and a prettier, much more charismatic cast who exhibit actual chemistry. Established actors Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Lena Headey and Jared Harris add authority to the film, which is well-paced and easy to watch.

BUT, while the movie is a vast improvement on others in its genre, its still a supernatural teen romance flick. Recommended for fans of the original books, and those with a weakness for the genre, like me.",1403913600,,985,4.9817073170731705

5305838,3,B009AMAKWM,I know that when you watch a movie based off a popular book there are going to be differences.  I can even tolerate such difference but this movie had so much lacking in it no wonder there has been no sequel.  The casting for this movie was horrendous.  The script was no better. There were some visual effects that were relatively descent and one that was off the wall good but it does not make up for the lack of everything else that is in this movie.

5305869,3,B009AMAKWM,"I have read the original moral instruments trilogy, and The City of Bones is a great complex story that took about 500 pages to tell.  When I heard they were making a movie I wondered what parts they would take out since it would be impossible to put the entire story in a regular length movie.  Because of this I have held off watching this movie for a long time since I could not think of any thing that could be taken out and not effect the entire story line for this part and the ones that come after.  The answer was that the filmmakers tried cramming everything in in under 2 hours in order to tell all the necessary story lines.  The result is that the entire movie felt rushed from the beginning.  I don't how anyone who hasn't read the books would not walk away confused and suffering from information overload.  One part I felt the filmmakers did right though was revealing that Jace and Clary are not actually brother and sister from the beginning.  This fact was held back until the end of the third book and made their feelings for each other creepy, but also made you think that there had to be more to the story.  The casting was also well done and the special effects did not look cheesy.

The rest of the cast is fine, but those three are perfect.  However, there are so many RADICAL changes from the original story, that the screenwriters have written themselves out of any chance to follow through with movies for the other books.

As a fan of the entire book series, this is hugely disappointing. I would love to see these adventures play out on the big screen, but there is absolutely NO hope for that unless they act like this first excuse for an adaptation was simply practice and start all over from scratch...with the same lead actors mind you...right-not happening.

This book series seems destined to become a CW telivision series-which I would not complain about as long as the writers actually read the book first.

It seems to me that the writers of this film were given the Spark Notes to this book and told to ""make it sexy-""which it is not. The attempts to ""sex things up,"" through costumes and even plot changes, simply serve to cheapen a film that truly should have been a YA blockbuster in the same vein of Twilight.

I only hope that people will not dismiss the book series based on this cheap and cheesy representation of it. The books-though sometimes flawed-are a wonderful journey, well worth your time and money.",1402790400,,1382,4.717842323651452

I was bored to tears. And this is not about Twilight and being over enamored. (I personally hated Kristen Stewart as Bella who had the emotional range of a teaspoon) The film just takes the barest bits of the books and makes a weak story of it. You never get the sense of the loving friendship with Clary and Simon and you never get the idea that the war between the angels and the demons is that big a deal.

I'm undecided on Jace's actor though, I was picturing someone different visually, I do think he did well with the sarcasm and brooding personality!",1401667200,,562,4.574257425742574

Ihate this movie. Icompletely understand that not every movie adaption is like the book, but this is completely different. The biggest complaint ihave with it is that they gave away the biggest plot twist of the book. None of the actors fit the characters they portray, except for Magnus. Isabelle is too nice in the movie, and jace shows his feeling for Clary too much. And whats up with the accents? Ifelt like the end of the movie was just made up on the spot. It's not even close to what happened in the book. It's hard to find anything iliked about it.

The vampires didn't kidnap simon for valentine, valentine gave hodge what he wanted and took have, valentine wasn't an irrational smug crazy guy, they didn't confront valentine at the institute, and clary didn't still have the cup in the end!

The plot was all over this place and without having read the books the audience would be rather lost. Although the actors look very much as the author invisions I felt that some of the acting was rather  elementary. Not to mention Valentine looked ridiculous with the braids in his hair. The special effects were the saving grace for this movie.

The first book was truly fantastic, and the movie does a wonderful job of illustrating the story. In many ways this series, both the books and now this movie, is far superior to the Twilight saga. I especially like the actors portraying Clary, Jace and Luke. This is a complex story and the movie succeeds where many fail, staying true to the important developments in the plot of the story. The movie also does a wonderful job of conveying the storys ominous and brooding atmosphere and the intense, suspenseful experiences the characters go through. This movie is, in many ways, superior to the book.

I loved the settings and cinematography. It is powerfully gripping and atmospheric. While the story is set in contemporary NYC it often felt like Victorian-era London or 18th century Budapest.

I eagerly anticipate more of the series.",1399680000,,904,4.895424836601308

I would've.
I felt like most of the actors did a very good job. They were true to the characters and had great chemistry together. But Magnus Bane... *shudders* He was absolutely horrendous. And it's a shame, because his character is so cool and interesting. But the actor playing Magnus was painful to watch.
I also felt like you never really got to explore the characters in the beginning, or go deep into them, or their stories.
But all this aside, I loved it. I really, really loved it. It was exciting, it was true to the book, the chemistry was wonderful, and I will definitely watch it again.",1399593600,,638,4.508620689655173

5306128,1,B009AMAKWM,"How people can easily praise The Mortal Instruments film adaption is beyond me. The movie was absolutely terrible. Now I watched the movie prior to reading the book; I usually never watch the movie before reading, but the concept always piqued at my interest, so I decided to go and see it hoping it wouldn't follow the same train wreck of recent YA movie adaptions. As I watched the movie in the theater with my friend, I found myself analyzing the plot's ridiculous plot holes (and there are many plot holes to the extent where I can easily point them out), the mythology absurdly explained in the story, and the lack of character development. If anything, as I watched, I felt like some plot devices were already too heavily used in other fantasy films.
What I hate about book-to-movie adaptions like these is that when I watch them, it specifically caters to the fanbase and those who read the books, or are at least very familiar with its source material. From the perspective of someone who didn't read the books, watching it all come to life on screen didn't fit as well as it should've, and often at times left me confused by the infodump of mythology scattered throughout the film. I didn't really understand the purpose of Simon's character either, because throughout the movie it just seemed like he was just... there, solely for the purpose to give some love triangle dynamic to the story. Bleh. Of course, since then I have read the first book, and surprisingly, I enjoyed it waaaay more than this mess of a movie. The execution of the worldbuilding in the story was way more concise and flowed better in comparison to it, and all characters strike as more likable in the book than the movie, too. After reading City of Bones and watching the film adaption, I hoped I would at least enjoy it more but, really, I was less confused than the first time watching it.
 So would I recommend to watch the movie? Eh, no, but if you're a fan of the books then go for it... but the book was more better, personally.",1398643200,,2018,4.559228650137741

I certainly hope they make future installments of this film, as I want to purchase everyone of them. The writers, actors and director did such a good job keeping the film interesting, fun, exciting, making you not able to turn away from the screen.

5306151,3,B009AMAKWM,"In The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones you will meet a teenage girl Clary Fray (Lily Collins, Mirror Mirror), who starts seeing some strange signs. She is an ordinary heroine who discovers who she really is through a series of fantasy adventures. She also gets romantically involved with someone with supernatural abilities  in her case a Shadowhunter Jace Wayland (Jamie Campbell Bower)  before fighting enemies using her newly acquired powers.

This is a classic way of weaving an adventure story, especially that of young adult novel, and there is nothing wrong with that itself. What is wrong with The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones is that, while borrowing so many things from other movies of the genre, Harald Zwarts gothic fantasy film gives us nothing new in terms of story or characters. (Or maybe worse, because I didn't find Lily Collins self-absorbed heroine very attractive).

Familiarity is not exactly a bad thing as long as the film gives us something else, like nice action and humor, interesting characters or anything. The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones doesnt have much to offer. Actors are all fine, but action scenes (with lots of CGI) are generic. While the story is set in New York City, the film hardly looks that way.

So what do we get? A so-so fantasy adventure, probably overlong (130 minutes) trying to cover so many things in one film, but not able to fully explore its potential. In short, The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones is an agreeable entertainment, even though most probably you have seen it somewhere before.",1398470400,,1559,4.957854406130268

I appreiciate the fact that the book was made into a movie but I hate the direction they took with the movie. The movie has a lot of things that is not in any of the books. I feel like they tried to give the movie a better ending cause they didn't know if they were going to make another movie and by doing this they complete screwed the movie up. The movie itself is a great movie. I feel like if I never read the books then I would have loved the movie.

5306157,5,B009AMAKWM,"This is now one of my top ten favorite movies. It does have quite a bit of violence in it. The one thing that REALLY bothers me about this movie, though, is that the volume of the music sometimes overrides the dialogue. It also suddenly gets louder, then turns to whispers. I watched the movie before I read the book. After I read the book, I was a bit disappointed in the movie. There were several scenes that were different from the movie and they left a few really good scenes out. Over all, this movie is great but, take as a precaution that it has some violence, gruesome visuals (mainly the demons. I'm oddly squeamish about them for some reason and I like gory things), and the volume issue. It's still one of my favorite movies, though.

It is easy to follow and maintains a high energy almost throughout the entre film. If you have not read the booms first it would be harder to follow and harder to get into. There is not enough time explaining everything that is going on and changing.

The subtle love triangle doesn't take the front seat which i appreciate.  the characters are well written and developed.  they make decisions that although are reckless you could see yourself making...if you were suddenly aware that vampires, warewolves, and faeries existed.  its an interesting take on the paranormal world and they heroes aren't always depicted in black and white.  i always enjoy a book that leaves a little grey in there for you to make up your own mind.  its easy to read and a total page turner, and yes im 30 not 15.  i highly recommend this series to anyone who wants something a little more interesting than a vampire having an uncomfortably unhealthy relationship with a high schooler.",1397520000,,988,4.632183908045977

5306238,4,B009AMAKWM,"Saw this on cable after reading many of the glowing reviews posted here.

The movie is not bad, but it'a also not great.  From my point of view, this movie is much better than many of the tasteless, talentless, cheaply made offerings on TV these days.  BUT it falls short of the book.

The book was easily a million times better than the movie.  But, then, movies based on bestselling books are seldom like the books.  Many reasons for that , money being the biggest deciding factor -- not the cost of making the movie but mostly how much the movie will make at the box office.

I suppose film makers are still hoping to cash in on the box office appeal of movies like HARRY POTTER and LORD OF THE RINGS, assuming those movies made back what it cost to make them.  I don't follow the trades, so i don't know, nor do I care.

Would I ever watch this movie again?  You betcha!  I have already watched it on cable 4 times and will, undoubtedly, watch it again.

The movie was good, just don't be disappointed that it isn't much like the book.

Having seen this movie on cable is what lead me to purchase a copy of the book upon which the movie was based.  And I still am of the opinion that the book is much superior to the movie.",1396224000,,1227,4.188034188034188

5306264,3,B009AMAKWM,"PROS:
- some notable actors
- appealing cinematography (e.g., the presentation of dark urban environments such as the ""Goth club"" scenes)
- lighthearted amusement if you don't mind gaping plot holes
- compelling special effects
- sometimes the intended humor evokes a chuckle
- there are absolutely some good ideas here (thus 3 stars instead of 2)

CONS:
- for every good idea or line, there are two bad ones
- detestable pop music during the obligatory first kiss scene that was already exceedingly long and awful without the music
- astonishingly poor tactical decisions by the gang of young Shadowhunters
- too many Twilight moments

The plot isn't altogether shoddy, it just isn't consistently robust; logic fails many times on a small scale and too often on a grand scale. For example, why in tarnation would Shadowhunters let Simon into their sanctuary (the New York Institute), further compromising the secrecy of that corner of the Shadow World? Because a Twilight love triangle is needed, of course.

And yes, this film will give you&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight/dp/B001T5D6LK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight</a>&nbsp;flashbacks, whether it is a werewolf pouncing on a vampire or the girl being impressed by the silently tormented protagonist playing classical music on his piano. The film is not shy about ripping off shots from other productions. The portal is remarkably similar to the Stargate, right down to the blue shimmering that it eminates onto people in the gateroom. I am uncertain whether these moments are an homage to other productions, or just outright theft.

I have not read the book and don't intend to, so please don't comment that I should read the book. I bought this Blu-ray because I enjoy most films in the genre and certain actors in this one: Lena Headey aka Queen Cersei Lannister (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winter-Is-Coming/dp/B007HJ84ZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winter Is Coming</a>), Jared Harris from FRINGE (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Which-We-Meet-Mr-Jones/dp/B001KZMGEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Which We Meet Mr. Jones</a>), and Aidan Turner from Being Human UK (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Though-the-Heavens-Fall/dp/B004UXZZIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Though the Heavens Fall</a>). Unfortunately, Robert Sheehan was cast for a major role (this is the actor who was excruciatingly annoying in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Misfits-Season-One/dp/B0083VOUFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Misfits Season One</a>). Overall, the casting was spot-on, with just a few hiccups.

If you are in it for the special effects, the pretty faces, the sometimes dark urban ambience, and snipets of Hollywoodized Goth culture, then by all means, give it a try. If you are looking for an altogether satisfying story, you may be disappointed.",1395964800,,3036,6.467980295566503
5306265,2,B009AMAKWM,"So, it's probably a bad sign when a TMI fan can't even understand what's going on in the movie.  CoB the Movie wasn't terrible, but it wasn't the best.  The action felt super rushed to the point of losing details, characters weren't fully fleshed out, and plots scenes were lost.  I made sure to watch the movie a few months after I read the book so I wouldn't hold it to such high standards.  Even then I was disappointed.  All of the characters, with the exception of Valentine and Isabelle, were fairly well done within the constraints of the movie.  Isabelle's main problem was the actor looked too old for the part.  She looked way older than Alec (who's technically the eldest of the siblings), appearing to be in her twenties instead of sixteen.  Valentine...  The way he was scripted in the movie didn't even make any sense.  He wasn't scary, he wasn't menacing, and frankly, he was somewhat annoying.  And wasn't he supposed to have blonde hair?  I thought the actor did a good job with what he had to work with, but Valentine just wasn't the same.

The demons were disgusting.  Well done, but positively gross.  Sadly, the Greater Demon Abbadon made no appearance and Valentine never got the Mortal Cup (not even at the end of the movie).  Simon never turned in to a rat and bit Raphael, instead it is shown as if one of the vampires bit Simon instead.  Speaking of Simon, he was very lacking.  His being one of my favorite characters, I was really looking forward to seeing him in the movie; he looks like Simon, acts like Simon, but he's not Simon.  All those endearing little quirks Simon had, his nerdiness, his sarcastic remarks, not too many show up in the movie and those that do seem lacking.  Jace is missing a lot of his snarkiness, Isabelle seems like a minor, minor character, and Luke is off somehow (can't put my finger on it, but he's not quite Luke).  The werewolves never have the big showdown with the Forsaken; I'm still not sure if there even were any Forsaken in the entire movie.  There were these weird humanoid fire-creatures that kept popping up in the Institute near the end when Valentine is let in through a portal in the Library and he summons all these crows.  Crows -> Merge -> Fiery, Humanoid Things.  Still confused about that.

I could go on about all the things missing from the movie that I think are crucial points, but I'll stop here.  I went into this movie being told by several friends that it was mediocre at best.  I wanted to watch it anyway so as to form my own opinion.  Somehow I'm not surprised that I agree with them.  Make your own opinion, though.  If you want to watch the movie, watch it.  I just kinda wish someone had told me how much of the story was lacking before I had watched it.",1395964800,,2749,4.448897795591182

5306293,3,B009AMAKWM,"This is a semi-well-done young adult movie.  The acting is great.  The effects are great.  But the plot is so much like Twilight that it turns me off.  You have a love triangle between the special girl, a half-angel, and a geeky guy who might or might not become a vampire.  A gay half-angel who loves the other probably-bisexual half-angel.  The boys are as pretty as the girls.  You have instant love and flirting--in a time of war and fearful happenings, by the way.  Bloodless battles that are infuriating to watch.  Werewolves that look just like the overgrown dogs in Twilight.  And so on.

There is some fun action here, as well as a few cool monsters.  But the mushy, emotional, bad-romance-novel plot just washes away what could have been an interesting urban horror film.  The bloodless fights turn this into a laugh-fest when it is supposed to be taken seriously.  Sorry, but when you impale someone on a sword or a giant wolf bites someone's torso or a character is tortured THERE WILL BE BLOOD.

The beginning is quite good, but it develops into a pre-teen dream world.  Only watch this if you loved Twilight or are a pre-teen.",1395705600,,1140,4.625

5306298,3,B009AMAKWM,"Why are you only talking about this movie now? Well, I personally do not fancy the theaters and because of the mix reviews, I have been putting it off. I am a huge fan of Cassandra Clare, but I am not bias. This movie was entertaining, but there were some off points. Let's get to it.

The characters. The actors were not as animated as I would have liked them to be. They seemed so  stiff. I mean, I am in no way and actor myself, but as a person who has read the books, I can justify that it is only fair I expected a bit more life brought to the characters; because the way I saw them in my mind, especially Jace and Magnus Bane, was definitely more livelier and full of personalities. Far from what I received from the movie. I know that we should not compare, but even if it was solely based on the movie alone, without the interference of the book, I still would have found the actors a bit awkward. Because of this, it sort of dropped my expectations for this, highly anticipated, film.

What I enjoyed. I thought the graphics and setting of the movie to be very believable and well done. Although the City of Bones was not as I expected, it was still amazing! You can tell that a lot of thought was put into it. The scenes with the portal was awesome!

Another aspect of the movie I enjoyed, was the action. I thought it was well choreographed, but most importantly, it looked real (Isabelle, kicked ass!). I cannot phantom how many movies I have seen, where the action scenes looks so  WWEOr at least how I remembered watching it, (I know there were some real injuries, but) the punches seemed so unrealthey were a good couple of inches away from the other opponent. I am not bashing WWE, because I use to watch it ALL the time with my bro, but mainly trying to give you the idea/picture.
Moving on.

The soundtrack, during the action scene (mainly the brawl with the vampires). It threw me off. Imagine this, Me: Yeah, it is getting (the music starts) downnnn (voice fades)  I got sidetracked. It just-did not-go well with that particular scene.

The plot. There are quite a number of people, who did not enjoy the plot; which is normal. But, I believe most of them are those who have not read the entire series. Overall, what I am saying is, this film was definitely made for die-hard YA fansespecially those of the series. Which is why I like it, regardless of the weaker points I mentioned above.

Would I recommend it? Why not? If you need a teen-flick that has action, romance, and a complicated premise, check it out. However, keep in mind that it is a series, and the ending will be left open-ended.",1395187200,,2616,4.366255144032922
5306319,2,B009AMAKWM,"Since nearly everyone else has written about what I feel toward this movie, let me just say that it is one of the few fantasy films I don't need to see again. The character of Jace had no appeal at all - I had the distinct impression that the Jamie Campbell Bower could not remove himself from his Twilight role. Jonathan Rhys Meyers, as the bad guy, was miscast. Lily Collins was - dull, just like in Mirror Mirror. The rewrite of the story was not good at all, and changed it so much that I was pretty sure the author had no input at all, even though she is credited. The only reason I'm giving this two stars is to give credit to the creators of the good special effects and the other cast members.",1395100800,,701,4.161764705882353

Lily Collins was okay as Clary and most of the supporting cast was okay in their roles as well.  But there was so much left out including the lack of the wonderful Magnus Bane.  Also what happened to Simon's vampire storyline?  I guess I will have to re-read the books instead because this movie left much to be desired.",1395014400,,629,4.513274336283186

Simon's transformation into a vampire did not match the book in some very important ways, and no explanation was given about how he could be out during the day (which was not explained until the boat scene in the book).  By the way, the final confrontation was BADLY done.  No kidnapping of the different downworlders, no real depth to the plot was evident.  IF you haven't read the books, it is possible you might like this movie.  If you have, skip this.  Though Clary, her mom, & Simon were well cast, the rest of the actors did not fit.  The Mortal Instruments series is brilliant as a book series, but this movie was not a good addition to the MI world.",1394755200,,702,4.4375

5306354,3,B009AMAKWM,"I guess it's ok, I sat through it. I normally don't expect much from book adaptations, since they obviously can't fit the whole book into 2 hrs. My main gripe was with Valentine and Jace's relationship. Jace didn't have a mind block in City of Bones, Valentine actually raised Jace as his dad, and didn't at any point in the book ever tried to kill Jace.

Also there is something about the way Valentine was portrait, I always imagined him as a very calculated dude, that had most things under control and was meticulous about what he said and did. The whole putting the cup in and out of the card... I don't know it lacked substance.",1394582400,,634,4.418803418803419

5306379,5,B009AMAKWM,"Honestly at first I was a little skeptical about the movie due to the fact that I love the books ,and did not want the movie to ruin the books. However, I really liked the movie. The effects were good, the actors are exactly as you imagined them in the books, and they didn't change much from the books! This is by far my favorite book series since Harry Potter!

Update: They are making the series into a tv show which will be able to tell all the details! Its going to be on ABC Family!",1394496000,,488,4.083333333333333

5306381,2,B009AMAKWM,"I borrowed the book from the library because in my opinion the book is always better. Well, this movie proved me right again.

First of all, I read a good deal of young adult lit, so I do not universally dismiss YA lit and the movies that they spawn. Yes, this means I read ""Twilight"" and I even saw the first movie. Neither of these were stellar examples of their medium. The Twilight Saga was mediocre and the first two films (I stopped watching after that) were kind of laughable. That being said, the movies were relatively faithful adaptations, and the first film had a low budget so it is not a surprise that it was kind of cheesy. This movie has none of these excuses. First, the source material was much richer; it was not a tale about a whiny klutz pining over a broody goth boy. Secondly, the special effects and action sequences of this movie make it obvious that it had at least a decent budget.

The greatest frustration in watching this film was the very rushed feel. Instead of taking the time to explain Shadowhunters and to really allow the characters relationships to develop, the screenplay relies heavily on characters directly stating plot points in a very clunky, unnatural way. On top of this, some of the best moments in the book were truncated or left out. It may not be possible to sufficiently express my disappointment in the portrayal of the character Magnus Bane. In the book, he was charismatic, imposing, and somehow flamboyant and mysterious all at the same time. In the movie, the actor was given 90 seconds to explain one of the most important elements of Clary's character...no wonder he had to speak so quickly it was difficult to understand him.

If you enjoyed the book, there is a possibility that you will enjoy the movie, but I could not in good faith recommend this film to anyone.",1394409600,,1824,4.588957055214724
5306382,5,B009AMAKWM,All around entertaining! I recommend this movie if you are a person that enjoys a fantastical plot along with forbidden love. As long as you haven't read the books.,1394409600,,164,4.689655172413793

But my god, I have never seen such a horrible movie. I knew it was going to suck the moment I knew it was coming out. The movie is so hard to follow, it jumps everywhere and explains NOTHING. Acting is just horrific. I hope they don't come out with anymore of these movies. The last fight at the apartment with simon in the movie was not at all accurate to the one in the book.

HORRIBLE.",1394409600,,491,4.051546391752577
5306384,5,B009AMAKWM,Actually I was pretty shocked how much I did like this movie! I thought it was going to be another similar movie like Twilight or something which I thought was poorly made. This one I was interested in all the way to the end. Now I can't wait to see the next one! Graphics were really good. Action was good. Only thing I would say I didn't like is Chase in a way. The way he acts and his hair I just want to chop off! I so hope he either changes to the better or she don't end up being with him in the end! Anyways I was thinking of reading the books now. I hope they are just as good or even better than the movie!,1394409600,,615,3.8125

5306399,4,B009AMAKWM,I'm currently on book five in The Mortal Instruments series and I'm obsessed. The only reason I didn't give the movie five stars was because my boyfriend- who didn't read the book- found it hard to follow. I have to agree that if you don't know the story it is a little confusing. That being said I hope they start filming the second movie soon and make it more cohesive!,1394323200,,371,4.314285714285714

5306402,2,B009AMAKWM,"I gave this movie two stars because I'm being nice. The whole plot was a mess and it was very confusing for the most part. Just like Twilight, you got another cool skinny blond dude who's into a brunette whose wanted by her best friend. Jace wants Clary, Simon loves Clary, and of course she chooses Jace (i,e, cool blond dude), while the sweet friend gets nothing. There was no real backstory to help you understand what was happening and I feel like for a movie that's almost two hours, they could have done better. Complete mess and waste of time!!!",1394150400,,552,4.475247524752476

5306435,4,B009AMAKWM,"The movie has a great plot, but since I have already read the book, I can say I was a little disappointed by the movie. Clary Fray is played by a girl with absolute caterpillar eyebrows and a slightly thicker frame than I expected., I don't know the actress' real name, I've never seen her in anything else. The filmmakers ""prettied her up"" to sell movie tickets. They hit Jace's character right on the head. Although I must say that the relationship between Clary and Jace develops a lot slower and more realistically in the book. Also, the guy who plays Jace is pretty enough for the both of them! He's beautiful! That is how it was in the book. But where were the vampire motorcycles? They left out a lot of cool stuff. I doubt this series will continue on film... it just didn't live up to the book. I felt very AWARE that I was watching a movie...there was a part in the movie where Clary's hair is just all of a sudden parted differently. Whoever was in charge of continuity slipped up a few, very noticeable, times. Also, Clary's eyebrows stole every scene...you should watch the movie as a ""how-to"" video on how NOT to shape your brows. I just couldn't stop staring at them! Pluck, girl!

I wanted to like this movie but man, they made it hard to do. So you start off with kind of a cool unique spin on the supernatural. Here you have this heroic group of people that are part human part angel kicking ass and taking names. Fantastic! Whats not to like. Then the love interests start to blossom, it is cute, the chick likes the dude, the other dude likes the dude that the chick likes. Love triangle for the win! Then....the incest happens. The one chick and dude find out their are brother and sister! YUCK! Seriously? Why? Then they still love each other and life is unfair and oh god....I couldn't even make it to the credits.

Read the first book of the series and compared to find the rare result of liking the movie better.  The characters in the movie are older, making the story more believable in many ways.  (Do not want to give things away, so keeping that vague.)  The weird unnecessary plot items of the book were trimmed away and the movie is just all the awesome things the book promised but did not deliver on.

Very much looking forward to the next movie.

5306501,2,B009AMAKWM,"This movie has good special effects and a reasonably interesting premise. The antagonists are well played and the protagonists have a certain charm that would seem more natural in an European film.

BUT the whole incestuous thing between brother and sister is more than just odd. It's a deal breaker that ruins the end of the movie. I haven't read the books. One would hope that they are not really brother and sister. Perhaps this is discovered in the second volume?

Lesson learned for the writers and producers. Despite how the books may have been written originally, you might want to clear up any disgusting and totally non-romantic plot twists before the end of the movie, where they jump onto a motorcycle together. Ugh!",1393113600,,727,4.854838709677419

I gave this movie a try because I love urban fantasy (anything by Ilona Andrews, Patricia Briggs, Faith Hunter types.) I couldn't get through the first hour.  Not only is this predictably written and horribly acted,  it perpetuates gender norms that are horrifically damage to our young girls.  The lead character Clary is only pretty. She is not intelligent, funny, perceptive,  or brave. The only characteristic you can actually pick up from her is that she is pretty,  naive, and an ok artist. She is portrayed as weak, foolish, and unaware of the dangers around her. When she anything noteworthy it feels out of character and disgenuine. The only strong female character dresses like a street walker (think black leather mini skirts and thigh highs) and appears to view Clary as competition. This is not a Katniss character.  She is not a strong young girl who is flawed.  She is a flawed weak ignorant girl chasing a feminine arrogant dude with nice hair and an English accent.

5306589,4,B009AMAKWM,I actually liked it I was forced to watch twilight which is garbage so I figured same thing but I was wrong so action was good more plausible then similar movies so if your arguing with your significant other and you don't want to watch it because it sounds like twilight and you already sat through that bullS**T let her win this one give a little and who knows what will happen after the movie,1392595200,,395,4.28
5306590,4,B009AMAKWM,"Usually the movies made after books are pretty bad and do not follow the books well. This movie does a great job staying along the lines of the book, my only complaint is the casting. Jace looks nothing like the description in the books and Valentine is the opposite of all the book's descriptions, and those things were enough to be distracting.",1392595200,,346,4.596774193548387

5306594,3,B009AMAKWM,"The Mortal Instruments was good, but not something I would consider great. The performances of the actors were admirable and you can tell they spent their time trying to give life to their characters. However, the characters themselves were not likeable nor relateable, so throughout the movie it feels more like you are on a train directing you to where the filmakers wanted you to go. There wasn't much opportunity to invest in the characters, so viewers are less likely to develop emotions and relationships with our ""Shadow Hunters"". The movie is entertaining and has a few surprises (as trivial or predictable they were) and a couple of good action sequences. All in all, this is a good movie if you have nothing else on your list of movies to watch and you wish to see something that isn't sub par.",1392508800,,804,4.709219858156028

Then I actually tried to watch it and it was horrible. I love the entire book series and they butchered it. If you love the books as well, do yourself a favor and never watch this movie. I should have stuck with my first instincts and never watched it as well. Hopefully I will forget everything I saw and it won't influence me when I read the books again. Seriously, there is nothing redeeming about this movie at all, it's just terrible in every way. They are fools to make a sequel....",1392422400,,643,4.152
5306597,4,B009AMAKWM,This was not exactly the easiest of books to put on film- there were so many layers and subplots it's hard to know what to push forward and what to leave behind. I think though it did a good job. I'll watch it again. I hope they make another.,1392422400,,242,3.9591836734693877

Like with Simon and the vampires lair - wish that was like the book. To me it was like a book and a half. The series of books are excellent and I think as a fan there was no reason to change things.

Did the same with Hunger games first book and then came back to match the 2nd one. So I hope they do the same if they continue the series of movies. Give the fans what they want not what you think they want producers!",1392422400,,586,3.84297520661157

5306635,5,B009AMAKWM,"This movie is filled with action, great special effects, it covers both fantasy, sci-fi, it has a really great story line, its deep and you can really stick with it, the romance in the movie isn't over powering either. This movie is about demons, angels, shadow hunters, vampire, werewolfs. However this movie does cover one taboo issue. The two heroes of the movie fall in love with each other, at the end of the movie they find out they are brother & sister. This movie is fantastic, one of my favorites. I highly recommend it.",1392336000,,529,4.578947368421052

5306637,3,B009AMAKWM,"As much as I thought I was going to like this movie, I found myself just finding it okay and honestly a little boring in some spots. The trailers made it look like it was going to be full of action and cool creatures but the action was there and some of the creatures were there but they lost their cool factor somewhere and even the action seemed a little lackluster. I would still like to see a sequal to this movie made if for no other reason than to give them a second chance to do what should have been done with this story the first time around.",1392249600,,551,4.064220183486238

5306661,4,B009AMAKWM,I loved the movie when it came out! I hadn't read the books yet but was dying to know what happened next so while doing research to see if and when there would be a second one I found learned it was a book series! I immediately saved money to buy the books! So far I've read 1-5 impatiently waiting for the last book to be released.  I was bummed that the movie had veered so much from the books! It was almost as if they wanted to hurry it along :( would make a good movie series. As for as I've heard there is still talk for a number 2!!! Knowing the books and how different they are from the movie I'm very interested in watching the next and hoping they do all 6!  My advice is watch the movie then read the books like I did. If I hadn't I wouldn't be giving the movie as good of a rating!,1392163200,,793,3.888888888888889

They had read the book and were eager to see the movie.  I bought the Blu ray and then read the books and I actually liked the movie better.  The adaptation did a good job of consolidating  repeat teen-angsty moments and teen-in-peril events that in the book became rather redundant.  The plot moves along at a good pace and quickly introduces the characters and how they relate to each other.  I was expecting not to like the Jamie Campbell  Bower in the role of Jace, but I thought his performance was quite believable.  Lilly Collins also turned in a solid performance as  Clary. In fact I was pleased with most of the acting, but would have liked to have seen more of some of the back story of  Luke (Aidan Turner from ""Being Human""!) Jocelyn (Lena Headey!) and Valentine (John Rhys Meyers) as well as more character development for those characters along with Isabelle & Alec. (I didn't get a sense of who they were until I read the book.) It's a fine line to walk between pleasing an existing  book fan base and engaging a new film audience when adapting a  book for the screen, and the love triangle ""romance"" aspect of the story was a bit heavy-handed for me, but it was an enjoyable movie overall.

Phil Collins daughter, Lilly, is actually pretty good but her eyebrows look so much like caterpillars that I kept expecting them to crawl off her brow. Good special effects.

5306852,4,B009AMAKWM,"I will admit that I didn't expect to like this film, in fact I'm surprised I watched it in the first place, however I'll also admit that I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed watching it. It's a teen movie with beautiful and tragic young creatures, one in particular finds herself drawing the same symbol over and over again and when her mother is attacked by demons she discovers that the world isn't what she thought and neither is she.

As I've already mentioned this is a teen movie and one based upon a familiar template, so we have smoldering looks, emo teenagers who don't fit in with the rest of the world and a supernatural that is glossier than it should be. Nothing too original you might think and of the face of it you'd be right, however it does have some good things going for it.

The first is that for a gang of attractive and emo youngsters they're actually not bad, sure there's a few moments where you roll your eyes, but the story gets going quickly and keeps moving all the way through. The second is that the support cast contains a number of well worn faces and add some depth to the film, don't get me wrong its fairly throw away entertainment, but entertaining nonetheless.

It's also a decent action film and while it does have the slightly glamorous supernatural side it also has its dark side and some of the demons are quite nasty and look pretty cool. So while its not a great movie, it was a fun watch.",1391212800,,1435,4.407547169811321

It is another example of how you can make a pure fantasy story and put a boat load of action scenes with it and still feel like a pure fantasy movie. The Romance is surprisingly good , The movie handles is romance pretty well without shoving it down your throat . The Acting is just good with the exception of this witch character , her acting just did not leave an impact on me , the rest of the actors life an impact on me. The Special effects are fantastic . If I saw this in 3D my mind would have been blown away .

None of the characters acted how they should in the books and the Valentine was a complete and utter non-intimidating joke compared to the cool collected persona he gave in the book. This movie did not follow the book at all and revealed plot points that were not even given until the third book. I was surprised to hear that this movie got a sequel since it revealed all the major plot points that were given in the 2nd book. Jace was a complete embarrassment to the movie acting nothing like the arrogant, pompous yet likable character that he was in the book. The only character that wasn't downright horrible was Lena Headley's who had a great performance considering what she had to work with.

PS did you know that Bach was a shadow hunter??!! Cause I sure didn't not til i saw this movie. Also apparently demons can invade the Institute, and are affected by music? Like what the heck this was never even touched upon in the books?!

All-in-all this movie was a complete abomination and disgrace to the book series that everyone came to love. This movie was nothing like the books and should be wiped from the face of the earth so they can start again and make a movie that followed the actual book. If i was the author I would be offended that this was the final ""Movie"" product of my book, from the shoddy script and poor choice of characters that were chosen.

I got this for my wife as a Christmas gift & she enjoyed it for what it was.

She is a big fan of the book series & was displeased with the changes that were made from the book to the script. Changes aside, she still enjoyed the character portrayals & the things that were translated faithfully from the book.

I on the other hand thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I have not read any of the books but am aware of  what was changed and/or left out. If you go into this movie not knowing much or anything regarding the source material you will likely enjoy it. The character development isn't as deep as I would have liked but the movie wastes no time getting to the action.

Also keep in mind that although all of these book to movie adaptations these days get some comparison to Twilight or The Hunger Games, this movie is in no way comparable to the two as they are all different in their own right. The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones is more Sci Fi in my opinion that the others.

Bottom Line: Hardcore fans of the books may not like this adaptation as it is not as faithful to the source material as it could have been. If you are not well versed with the lore & are looking for an entertaining Sci Fi/action type of movie then you may want to check this out.",1390867200,3,1322,4.18503937007874

5307002,5,B009AMAKWM,"Maybe not for everyone, some fans had negative things to say.  Personally, I LOVED this movie.  Sure, there were a few akward moments (like the line about Clarys memories being blocked and she says something along the lines of ""I don't remember anything that I would want to forget"" ... it was sort of a ""duh"" moment and the script could have been a bit better there.

But the casting was flawless.  Lily Collins is exactly how I imagined Clary.  Jamie Campbell Bower is the perfect Jace (and so hot!!) the chemistry between the two is totally believable.  Simon is played exactly how I imagined him to be, Magnus Bane was another ""exactly what I imagined"" casting.  I couldn't imagine the movie(s) with any cast changes.

There is word that they are going to be filming part 2 in 2014.  I am seriously hoping they make the entire series into movies (and quickly too... waiting 1 year or more between movies sucks!).

That's about it... it's not for everyone, some have complaints, but whatever, I personally loved it, and bought the digital copy.  Nothing is ever perfect but I am certainly thankful that they made the move and hope they do the rest too... would love to *watch* the series to completion after having read it all (except the final one which isn't out till this May but I've pre ordered!).",1390780800,,1305,4.606060606060606

5307004,4,B009AMAKWM,"For those of you who didn't read the book, City of Bones, this movie may seem a bit confusing to you. This film is kind of like a cliff notes version of the book. Certainly they had to cut things out of the nearly 500 page novel, but some key moments are simply touched upon with a line or two, making the movie a bit confusing at times. Clary Fray (Lily Collins) is a seemingly normal girl, who for some reason can't stop drawing a symbol. When she starts asking about the symbol, she is pulled into a world she never knew existed. As it turns out, Clary is keeping secrets, secrets she doesn't even know she has. It's those secrets that will eventually put her life, and the lives of everyone she knows, in danger. At first, the two main characters seem like they are completely different and won't have any chemistry at all, but as time goes on, they learn they're more alike than they think. Once their on the same page, the story really takes off. Lily Collins (Abduction, The Blind Side) really takes hold of her character and gives the film a strong female lead, that rivals Katniss Everdeen. Collins is paired with British heart-throb, Jamie Campbell Bower, who is a lot more than eye candy. I'd never seen Bower in anything, except bit parts in Twilight and Harry Potter, but the guy has some serious fighting skills. Bower is another one who at first doesn't seem to fit, but in the end really helps to make this film something special. To answer the big question about City of Bones, no, it is not as good as the book and you really shouldn't have expected it to be. The novel is massive and has entire parts that simply couldn't be transferred to the big screen. Some things were left out that shouldn't have been, while some of the more fast paced scenes were extended for the screen. All in all, I thought this movie was a pretty good representation of an excellent novel and a great film to include in your next movie night.",1390780800,5,1939,4.418994413407821

5307018,2,B009AMAKWM,"I graciously gave this movie 2 stars because they kept the names of the characters from the books at least, but if you read the series do NOT expect it to follow. I felt like this movie had possibly 30 minutes worth the book in it, and that wasn't worth my money. If you think it is underrated, you couldn't have read the books. I was HIGHLY disappointed by the choice to leave out characters, change aspects of the character's storyline in the book, as well as adding in things that never happened in the book. Claire is transformed in this movie into a Bella Swan ""can't be without a man"" character, and Alec and Isabelle might as well have been left out of the movie altogether compared to their roles in the books. Don't even get me started on Hodge and Magnus (or Max who was nowhere to be found). Great actors were forced into horrible acting, and I won't waste my time with anymore of these movies. I don't expect books to be like the movie, books are always better, but the least a director and screenwriter can do is stick to the important facts.
I also felt the movie was choppy. The storyline didn't flow at all, probably because the director was forcing things from the end of the book to the beginning of the movie, killing the shock factor.

Of course there are differences between the book and the movie, some a little more important than others and you wonder, ""what were they thinking when they did that?""  But some of the major changes, despite being very different from the book, made sense in the movie and you wonder if perhaps Cassandra Clare would have written the story that way if she did it over because it did make so much sense.  Then there are other very important deviations from the book that make me wonder how the screenplay writer and director are going to reconcile them in the subsequent movies.

5307023,3,B009AMAKWM,"After the wild success of Harry Potter, Twilight and The Hunger Games it only makes sense the movie studios would rush out to grab any and every young adult and kids level book series with any promise or decent sales figures. Nothing wrong with that from a business perspective. These books have a built-in audience, which tells the studios there should be a reasonable expectation of a certain level of ticket sales. The real danger is it can fail horribly if the movie is not adapted well, especially when you are looking down the barrel of a three-to-four book series. Franchises will not continue if the first film fails to make it off the box office launch pad. That brings me to our current adaptation, looking to pick up the torch of the young adult franchise wars.

The Mortal Instruments  City of Bones is the first of a six-book series (final book due out in 2014.). It surrounds a young girl named Clary, who finds out her mother had a dark secret passed down to her. A power to see not only demons and all sorts of nightmarish legends, but also the people who hunt them. After being recruited into a group of these Shadow Hunters, Clary struggles to help them find a magical cup that grants the person who drinks from it incredible powers. Along the way, she also must decide where her loyalties and loves lie, in the real world or in the fantasy world.

Im going to put this right out front: this is far and away aboveTwilight, pretty much in line with the first Hunger Games film, and better than certain volumes of the Potter franchise (mainly books one and two.) The action sequences, character design and overall scenic look of the film are very well done. The goth kid-cum-demon hunter is a fun look, sort of a junior version of watching the Blade trilogy.

The casting of these hopefully long-lasting characters was done with care. Lily Collins (Clary) takes the helm as the young, naive fish out of water. She definitely has a certain charm about her, a presence on-screen that is natural, but there are moments here where she relies to heavily on theRyan Gosling method of success (just staring off camera in deep thought.) Robert Sheehan plays he lovelorn best friend Simon, the human element in the film. Hes mainly there to represent the audience, one character on-screen to give us the outlet for saying, What the hell is going on here? Hes good, very reminiscent of Jay Baruchel in The Sorcerers Apprentice. Jonathan Rhys Meyers tops the well-known bill by playing the main villain, Valentine. He doesnt show up until the last quarter of the movie, giving his usual intense performance: a sort of stoicism laced with psychotic rage. The breakout performance here is actually from Jamie Campbell Bower, who plays possible love interest and main Shadow Hunter, Jace. He has a power on camera, an intensity that matches well with Meyers. He also gets to balance his character between brash badass and playful protagonist, which always makes for a more interesting character.

On the down side, this movie suffers from the curse of the origin story that all franchises deal with. Running at just over two hours long it has to set up all the stories and plot lines that will continue through the franchise, if the other movies actually ever get made. The danger in that is if you don't make sure to make the first movie tight and enjoyable enough, there will be no audience waiting when the next chapter comes around. There are a ton of questions and scenarios introduced here, but very few actually tied up, so the movie comes off as long and mostly unfinished. I haven't read the books, so I cant say what I would have left out, but the movie could have benefitted more from a ninety-minute running time more than complete accuracy and allegiance to the source material.

The Mortal Instruments  City of Bones isn't bad and it makes me curious for what the next chapter will bring, but Im not convinced this chapter set the bar high enough to call for the money it will take to get the second one made.",1390521600,,4025,4.652601969057665

5307025,4,B009AMAKWM,"Its a cool movie. I really enjoyed watching it. The thought of your favorite book series brought to the big screen. I dislike that it wasn't exactly like the book and that skip some parts in the first book, but it is a movie. the books and movies tend to be different. But above all, I still liked it. If you like the series, you might want to watch this",1390521600,,354,4.071428571428571
5307026,5,B009AMAKWM,"Most book to movies these days have been blah. they usually take out important stuff from the book when they make amovie. this movie is very much taken straight from the book other then a few setting issues in the end of the movie which they did to save money since it is the first movie of the series and they have to save money somewhere.
special effects are amazing soundtrack is brilliant. Acting is amazing on all ends, amazing cast.
advertising for the movie was terrible which is why it didn't do well

5307059,2,B009AMAKWM,"Not a particularly compelling story line or convincing movie in general.  Just generally not impressed.  Have never read the books, so that might have been to my disadvantage, though the story was not at all difficult to keep up with, just did not really draw me in at all.

5307063,1,B009AMAKWM,"Where to start- the acting is really wooden and stiff. Clary and Jace had, like, negative chemistry. Jokes fell completely flat. I actually read all of the Mortal Instruments books and really enjoyed them, my expectations were pretty grounded for this movie. The movie took an entertaining book and made it boring. What a disappointment!",1390348800,4,337,5.1454545454545455
5307064,1,B009AMAKWM,This movie did not go with the book at all. They removed crucial parts of the book degraded the story line and did a horrible casting job. It made the last 6 Harry potter movies and the Twilight movies look like they actually followed the books. I would not recommend that anyone EVER watch this movie. IT SUCKED!!! Stick to the books. You will be disappointed if you don't run away from this movie.,1390262400,3,399,4.405405405405405
5307065,5,B009AMAKWM,This was a really great movie with wonderful scenery and a great story.  I really enjoyed the plot and the way things worked out.  I plan on reading the books now as this is a series.  Awesome job!,1390262400,,197,4.131578947368421

5307088,1,B009AMAKWM,"I was very very disappointed with the movie. As a fan of the books I found myself wondering if someone didn't realize (or didn't care) that the movie gets too far away from the book. They changed too many essential pieces and the essence of the characters, especially Valentine. I truly believe that for those who didn't read the book the movie will be confusing. For them the plot will probably seem weak. It's truely sad that they had the budget to do something great but failed miserably. Trying to look at the glass half full, at least the movie has good special effects.",1390176000,,575,4.538461538461538

5307091,4,B009AMAKWM,"As a fan of fantasy, I enjoyed the movie and found it entertaining.  While the movie didn't have the best acting or screen adaptation, I still found it entertaining.  I always love the performances of Jonathan Rhys Meyers who played Valentine, the shadowhunter who rebelled in desiring to kill all downworlders.  I don't want to give any spoilers, so I really don't wish to discuss the plot.

I enjoyed Lily Collins in Mirror Mirror and her performance in this was similar.  Not the best acting, but enjoyable anyway.

The action and story kept me interested throughout the movie.

I have not read the books, but am now interested in reading them to find out more and see the differences between the movies and the books.

Although not the best fantasy movie, this movie was entertaining.  I liked it.",1390089600,,801,4.746376811594203

5307093,4,B009AMAKWM,"I have not read the book (or books) from which this movie is derived, so I have nothing to compare the movie to, but in my estimation, it was a pretty good movie. It had the same sort of depressed film style as the twilight films, but without the (in my opinion) stupid love triangle theme.
The visuals were nice, and at times stunning, the sense of adventure and immediacy was palpable, the casting was pretty good, the dialogue was good, and the story itself was fairly seamless and interesting. There will clearly be at least one sequel if not more.
This is definitely a movie designed to be watched by teens/young adults, but I found it to be pretty decent for a 40 year old as well (myself). My wife was a little less enthused by the flick, so I think opinions will definitely vary, but for me, the sense of mystique and the reveal of another reality overlapping ours was pretty cool.
I think it is definitely worth a viewing.",1390089600,,931,4.4186046511627906

5307096,1,B009AMAKWM,I was really dissapoined in the unfolding of this movie. It was if they took part of the first book and part of the second book-and mixed them together. The location of the film takes place all in the same place-which is not how the stories were written and the characters were not physically the same as they were depicted and described in the books.,1390003200,,351,4.415384615384616

5307108,2,B009AMAKWM,"The writing is blah, the story was OK, but it seemed like they took a few too many pages out of Star Wars for the plot.  It was just a ""blah"" experience without any development.",1390003200,,177,4.057142857142857
5307109,5,B009AMAKWM,This is a first rate movie in its genre. Reminiscent of the Buffy series or. Beautiful Creatures. I rented it and liked it so much I bought it!  I saw online that they are filming the next book in the series now.  I can't wait.,1390003200,,227,4.022222222222222
5307110,2,B009AMAKWM,"""Mortal Instruments"" has everything: young teen heroine, boring teen love , boring threesome, vampires and werewolves (why not?), poorly CGI monsters, glow pen wands (crystals?), and a very sorry use of goth clothing.  For some reasons everyone wears black clothing that looks like they're from the late 1980's.  'Hot Topic' has better clothes.
The story is about pretty Clary who switches from crying to staring to looking upset to kind of smiling to staring.  She meets Jace who mentors her about the standard ""all things you were told aren't real, are real"" world they live in. Clary wants to learn about runes (magic?) so she can find her mother who's gone missing.  She's worried about her mother....sometimes... others times... not so much.  The movie literally stops halfway through to have Clary and Jace go on a *very* clique date.  Aren't they desperately searching for Clary's mother or trying to find the mortal instrument?  Aren't they being hunted down by Valentine?  Do they really have time to just wander around the school? Shouldn't Clary being spend all of her time trying to train? Did a thirteen-year-old girl write the ideas for the first kiss?
I didn't care about Clary or Jace's relationship.  She's boring and he's possibly bipolar. The main villain is Valentine who wants the mortal instrument to do something evil, apparently.  I'm not even sure if the demons are a real threat.  Sure they possess people (do they kill the people or make copies?) and they make sorry attempts to kill people, but, they don't do a lot beyond that.  They don't seem to be organizing or planning anything.  We're never told/shown the scale or the demon/angel war.  Are they really a treat?  They seriously don't seem to do anything.
Clary learns magic with literally no effort.  It's hard to be impressed by Clary's abilities, when they're something she stumbles into.  She learns how to do a very complicated magic trick by accident.  She doesn't use runes... so she can do magic without runes?  What's exactly is going on with the runes?  You get specific super powers by tattooing them on your skins.  Powers like strength or invisible.  Do they have more?  You don't see them use any while they're fighting.  Clary (being special) has -one- impressive runes that acts like magic. Can the others do magic with runes?  These people are covered in runes, yet, never do anything magical.  They don't even do anything that impressive physically.  They don't seem faster or more agile. I started to wonder after the second big fight what the point of being tattooed in runes if they don't really do anything aside from make you invisible to normal people.
Are the runes really doing anything? Does it hurt to carve runes into you?  Clary uses her glow stick wand (not a joke it really does look like a glow stick) to carve in a rune, but, doesn't seem hurt or is even bleeding.
This movie spent so much time explaining their unoriginal fantasy world yet glossed over the runes, which actually would have been something original and potentially interesting to see the different abilities the hunters can use.  Can we stop with the teen love triangles?  It's always apparent who the girl is going to choose.
All in all, it's a forgettable teen fantasy film that really adds nothing to the genre.",1389916800,,3298,4.8375

I believe this was based on a book, so either the book is that bad(unlikely) or the people who decided to make this movie have no good sense of what makes a good movie. Also - the men casted for these roles we some of the ugliest I've seen. What happened to having young men that look like decent human beings and not drug addled waifs? The only redeeming quality was the main female - don't really know her name, I've seen her in other movies that I liked her in- but even she didn't really do well in this movie.

5307239,5,B009AMAKWM,"I love to read and am normally VERY critical of adaptations of books I have read so I can sympathize with fans of these books who might not be pleased with the adaption. I had similar feelings about Twilight and now Vampire Academy coming out. IMO, I think the only book series that really adapted ""well"" to the big screen were Harry Potter and the Hunger Games series and I'm sure even those had their complaints.

I have NOT read these books and decided to give the movie a try anyway since I love supernatural/adventure books. Without having read the books and watching it as an entertaining new movie series I found myself very entertained. I loved the characters, I think the actors did an overall good job and for the most part I felt like the movie was good. The movie actually made me go out and buy the books because I wanted to know what else I was missing and what is going to happen to these characters. I really had no negative feelings about the movie and thought it was pretty good.

However, when you read a book it's like your baby and you imagine it to be one way and when the adaptation is not, it's easy to find yourself disappointed. I would say that if you can be open minded and just want something to watch, give it a chance. I personally liked this movie better than Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters which was okay too.

Edited on January 16th, 2014:
A few days after writing this review I received my copy of City of Bones and read the whole book. After reading the book and comparing it closely with the movie I can honestly say this movie is an amazing adaptation of this book. Many of the lines are verbatim to the book and sequence of events. With a few changes here and there which I think ultimately improved the movie. Some of the locations/where the events occur are different but very few. Jace's character was a bit different as well in the beginning but it didn't really make a big difference for me. I would say about 90% of the book is accurate to the movie. The only aspect of the movie I would have changed at this point was the romance scene. It wasn't like the scene in the book was all that romantic and detailed either but the sprinklers in the movie was an unnecessary add-on. It could have been more romantic/naturally done. Overall, if you didn't read the books you're not missing much. The movie is a great adaptation of the storyline and in my opinion I actually prefer it's direction over the book. I hope that helps! Just watch the movie. xD",1389484800,2,2490,4.37365010799136
5307240,1,B009AMAKWM,I am reallymad about this movie. I personally don't think it followed the book at all. And I also don't think they did a very good job at picking thecast of the movie. This movie would be great for someone who hasn't read the books.  But seeing. As I have read the books I was actually. Confused by the end of the movie by what just happened.,1389484800,,342,4.104477611940299

5307242,1,B009AMAKWM,"Movies to ever be made. Absolutely loved the book but the movie was a dead letdown. The acting was terrible. Jace says things in the movie that are stupid and VERY much unlike his character. Valentine was an absolute mess. Someone called him a Mad Max of the 80's, something to that effect....and that person was right. Valentine looked kind of out of place and, though Jonathan Rhys Meyers is usually an excellent actor, overacted his way into total failure in the role. Myriad problems plagues this movie, one of them being that certain things didn't happen in the movie the way they did in the book. Other things were changed so drastically that I wondered what book the director was working from. Don't get me started on Lena Headley, who is a glaring case of an amazing talent severely underutilized. She had almost nought to do in the movie. Her fight scene in the beginning of the movie was mess and she was supposed to be able to hold her own well. And they couldn't even end the movie at the proper point the book ended. All in all, an abomination at best.",1389398400,,1065,4.494845360824742

They changed quite a few things, and while they didn't detract from the movie, it leaves a lot of questions in terms of the sequels that are supposedly being made.

5307324,5,B009AMAKWM,"As a fan of the YA genre, I was thrilled to find that Cassandra Clare's masterpieces were being translated to the silver screen. I bought the DVD set and haven't stopped watching it since.

Yes, the film did some radical interpretations of the text it still came out shining in the end. While Jamie Campbell Bower wouldn't have ever been on my top 100 actors to play Jace, to my great surprise, he thoroughly embraced the character and sold me within minutes. Lily Collins is a fantastic Clary (definitely an actress whose career I will continue to watch with great interest) and the chemistry is definitely there between the two leads. I can't wait to see how they will portray their burgeoning attraction to one another, while dealing with the incestual ickyness in City of Ashes.

All the other actors were aptly cast, particularly John Rhys Meyers as Valentine. Wow...I don't think there was a better choice to play such a dark, slightly psychotic character.

To all those naysayers out in the world who diss and dismiss this movie, I ask you to think about some of the other YA novels that have been given over to Hollywood to twist and warp as the screenwriters saw fit. Try to remember to judge on a curve. The Twilight series was ruined for me simply because of Kristen Stewart, who couldn't seem to register an emotion if her existence depended on it. Allow the writers some artistic license and don't expect everything from the book to appear in the movie. Enjoy it for what it is...2 hours of adventure and excitement meant to distract us from the ordinary existence of our own world.",1389052800,,1595,4.669039145907473
5307325,4,B009AMAKWM,"Despite the artistic license taken, deviating from the book, this was an enjoyable movie.  My only negative was Clary not handling the first demon alone-- that's kind of important.",1389052800,,180,5.206896551724138

5307337,4,B009AMAKWM,I would have given it 5 stars. Except I really dislike the digital copy in ultraviolet. It's really a preference thing.  I prefer the digital copy to be downloaded in iTunes so that I an keep all my movies together. Easier to watch on my phone and computer from iTunes.,1389052800,,269,4.38
5307338,5,B009AMAKWM,"While I did enjoy this movie I was saddened to see just how much is wrong with it. I, unlike some of the people I know, hadn't read any of the books so I was going in fresh and new.
The story is fantastic, the characters are perfect and yet as I read the book after having seen the movie twice now,  I must say that they could have done a much better job in the telling. While our characters and the people who portray them match up very well there are some issues with the changes with most seeming small but can cast a long and dark shadow.

Jace is exactly right as he is portrayed by Jamie Campbell Bower, full of longing and anger and all consuming grief. His physical appearance is spot on I must say and although I do believe he is just TOO pretty he certainly needs to be. (No spoilers here)

Clary is a whiner who just cannot bring herself to care anything about her mom until it's too late and even then, well. I just hope that for all of their sake that she learns how to fight and stand on her own two feet. Lily Collins has the looks of Clary and some of her manners but only in that she seems to pout a lot and never is all that happy unless she's with Jace.  In her constant worry for Simon who just wants Clary to notice him she seems selfish and unfeeling toward anyone who isn't Jace.

Simon played by Robert Sheehan is annoyingly sweet, clingy and pouty but I found myself rooting for him in his hopeless quest for Clary's affection even after he is saved by her and the shadow hunters he still has his optimism full of wonder and painful longing.

Alec and Isabelle, the brother and sister who try and keep Jace on a leash when they can that is.
I believe that Alec is another character portrayed exactly right in looks and temperment. He is played really well by Kevin Zegers and I have high hopes that when the second movie is done he better have more on screen time. It's Alec's quiet devotion and sad wanting of Jace that makes you feel for him especially after his not so subtle keep away neon sign directed at Clary.

Isabelle is the sister that both Alec and Jace deserve, she is strong and will suffer no fools. Her flaws are being too serious about the things she doesn't need to be serious about and her fun side isn't fun when it's appropriate to be.  Jemima West plays Isabelle very well in that she enjoys being a female among boys but she also seems very glad of Clary's company as she states she hates being the only girl.

As for Valentine played by the always sexy Johnathan Rhys Meyers I just wish they would have gotten the HAIR right!  I mean he couldn't just have worn a wig or colored his hair??  Other then that I am sooo very glad to have Valentine be such a hardened warrior with the stellar acting chops that Meyers always brings to his roles. Especially one such as his current project, Dracula and his previous Henry the Eighth. I believe that these particular roles lend a certain heck yeah to his performance as Valentine, the evillishy handsome shadow hunter.

Jocelyn our actual hero, played by Lena Headey, is believable as Clary's mom in looks and bad attitude. Jocelyn should have prepared her daughter better not hidden everything from her until it was convienent and necessary. Magnus Bane should have tried a bit harder in letting Clary have a better chance later on especially.

Overall I have loved this movie and now the series of novels has entered my heart and mind. I wholly recommend the movie be watched and the series of books read.  Personally, I am glad I saw the movie first.  I am gleefully looking forward to the next movies (here's hoping) and maybe just maybe they will learn from the mistakes of adding when not necessary and leaving things IN when they should be.",1388966400,,3739,4.352011494252873

I was worried about purchasing just the normal D.V.D and Digital copy, thinking that as a  christmas present for her, what if it didn't have enough bonus info. for a die hard fan that she is. I was pleasantly surprised when there were actually deleted scenes and bonus featurettes that were not mentioned in the info on amazon. (Under special features it had said none).
She loved it!! We have now got all of the series except city of heavenly fire which comes out this year and now the movie.

It could be, but for the Twilight-esque bare-chested, hairless faux-macho teens and thirty-somethings trying to look like twenty-somethings.  Plus, no one watches this for the angst, but for the chopping and the fighting, the otherworldliness and the special effects.  To find out Bach was a demon killer, for example.

I read all the books and i hope your screen writer will do a better job if you continue this series of books that were written to an utmost fashion that i enjoyed reading them and look forward to many more writing by Cassandra Clare.,1388966400,,591,4.086206896551724

Sure there are things in the book that I wished had been in the movie, but they can only do so much. I think they did a perfect job casting Lily Collins and Jamie Campbell Bower. They brought those characters to life with Jace's witty, rude, but vulnerable side to the sheer bravery of Clary.

I had a few people who had not read the books say they were confused about things (the Stele was never explained for example) but they enjoyed the pace of it.

5307475,5,B009AMAKWM,"I did not read the book/s before seeing this film, but just finished the first book afterwards.  I'm not sure why there are all these bad reviews.  The movie followed the book as well as can be expected.  SPOILERS:  Realistically and financially, the cost of creating the Institute and the Staton Island place would have been ridiculous, so I see why that was changed to one location.  I actually liked the flow of the film version from the poetry room, Pandemonium and then the Joe's the next morning.  It made more sense.  I'm glad they left out Church, the coach ride and the restaurant...it would have been cheesy.  I also think Jace and the Shadowhunters knowing where the vampire laire, Mangnus Bane's etc were, just because they were indeed Shadowhunters in the city, made more sense than the book.  I see why they only made one portal as well.  I don't know why fans would have reacted badly to the changes, they were all good.  As for the acting, it was fantastic.  Not ""Twilight-y"" at all, and the comparisons are absurd.  Jamie Campbell Bower was excellent as Jace, I can't see anyone else playing him.  He seems to match the description in the book well as opposed to whoever did the cover art on the jacket. As for the other characters, I thought they were well cast, despite fans having issues with height and haircolor.  I'm glad Jamie's eyes weren't gold...too much like Twilight, plus he has great eyes!

Can't wait for the City of Ashes film.  Hope all the actors are available to come back!  Well cast and acted film and great screenplay.  A lot of the sentences and phrases were included, even if in different situations, which you would think, would make the fans happy.  The only thing that is truly ""different"" is the black rune tattoos, but they looked cool, so not an issue for me!!!

Well, at least I saved the price of admission and a large diet coke. Some books do not translate well on the silver screen. Of course, gutting out parts of the book and having a cast who look like their just going through the motions doesn't help either. No surpirse that it bombed big time here.
A great disappointment since I love reading the books in this series and I'm looking forward to the latest release.

5307540,5,B009AMAKWM,"When  I first saw the trailer for this movie I was thinking to myself oh here we go another poorly adapted movie based on a book. (Do you blame me? Look how Percy Jackson and the lightning thief movie turned out! I'm still afraid to see the sequel! The same goes for  the Hunger Games. Yikes!) Anyway I thought this was going to be a terrible movie because all they focused on in the preview was the kiss between Clary and Jace(the two main characters). Not smart because the advertising for this movie kept me from seeing it in theater's which I imagine is what kept other people, fans or not, from seeing it as well.

After watching this movie I really was surprised with how great This movie was! The acting was great, it followed the book pretty well, the special effects were good, and the quality/look of the movie was just plain excellent. I was a little worried about the choice of the two main characters before I watched it though. I didn't really think Jamie Campbell Bower or Lily Collins would be the perfect fit for these characters but they actually were! I adored Jamie I thought he did an excellent job as Jace and Lilly was good as well much to my surprise.

Minor SPOILERS

There were a few things that were missing from movie that were changed or removed like church the cat and the way Simon turned into a mouse but that was okay. The guy who played  Magnus Bane  was good but I felt he should have been a little more flamboyant like in the books but for how little screen time he had in the movie I don't think he did too bad.

End SPOILERS

So to let everyone know this is NOT a kissing-teens in love-romance story. This is not another  twilight or another horrible adaption of a famous book series( like Percy Jackson 1 and The Hunger Games). Even though there is one kissing part it's not a major part of the movie. This movie is about a young woman finding out she is a shadowhunter and discovers there are other people like her that she never knew existed. Vampires, demons, witches, wizards and Werewolves are involved in this action packed tale as well. It follows the book VERY well but like I said it's not  perfect. It's hard to fit everything from a 300+ page book into a 2 hour movie but I really think they succeeded with this one. As a huge fan of the books I was very pleased with this movie adaption and  I really hope everyone  in the cast returns for the sequel.
So if your fans  of the book like me, or just someone who wants to see a good paranormal movie filled with good acting, action, and interesting characters/story watch this movie!! I LOVED it!!! It's definitely an underappreciated movie that won't disappoint! :)",1388534400,4,2664,4.3991853360488795

5307571,2,B009AMAKWM,"Could have been a great movie but when you have the obligatory skinny girl and the quirky male model fighting scores of vampires in well choreographed fight sequences, it is just barely watchable. They should have spent more money on a better screen play and less on set design. British model vampire fighters at Hogwarts school. Come on......",1388448000,,343,4.931034482758621
5307572,4,B009AMAKWM,"Hollywood knows where it makes its money when it comes to theaters. That became apparent with the numbers raked up by the TWILIGHT franchise. Since that series is finished it's time for a new one and what better than another one based on a series of novels, THE MORTAL INSTRUMENTS: CITY OF BONES.

Clary Fray has been seeing things she can't explain. Signs no one else can read and images of people being murdered that no one else sees. After watching someone killed at a nearby club she returns home to find her mother gone and their apartment trashed. Enter Jace, the killer she saw at the club who explains to her what is going on and offers to help her find her mother.

It appears that Clary is descended from a line of Shadowhunters, a group of half human/half angel warriors that have battled evil for generations. Not wanting her to be aware of certain secrets, Clary's mother had a spell cast on her to hide images and knowledge so that no one could get them from her. But with her mother captured Clary isn't sure who to side with or who to trust.

Jace and the other Shadowhunters take Clary and her friend Alec in to their secret stronghold. It is there that they begin to tell her about who she is, who her mother was and just who is responsible for kidnapping her and why. Years before Clary's mother was part of a group of Shadowhunters who followed Valentine, a Shadowhunter who decided to use the method once employed to start their kind in the hopes of taking over the world. Clary's mother put a stop to that, stealing the sacred chalice that Valentine needs to accomplish his goal.

As the story unfolds it provides plenty of background material for those just coming into the series of stories but not in a way to be boring. Instead we get glimpses of the past of Clary's mother and of Clary herself, bits and pieces revealed to her and us at the same time. The story moves forward and alliances develop as does a love interest between Clary and Jace, much to the chagrin of Alec who has long been in love with Clary. Can you say Team Edward and Team Jacob?

But honestly that would be short selling this movie (and my guess the series of books on which it was based) which does offer something different and, for me at least, a bit more fulfilling than sparkly vampires. These Shadowhunters are fierce warriors willing to take on a room filled with truly hideous vampires in an effort to protect Clary. Their weapons are old school but don't let that fool you as they take on all comers with nary a drop of their own blood spilled.

The special effects are done to perfection here but yes of course they are CGI (Computer Generated Images) more often than not. At least they've made the effort to make them seem real as opposed to poorly done CGI (see any monster of the week effort on SyFy for an example of bad CGI). The heroics are nicely done and by the end of the film you find yourself hoping that more of the series will follow.

That may not happen as the movie's release didn't garner the attention or numbers that the TWILIGHT crowd displayed. That might change as the film head to DVD this week. It will give those who didn't see it in theaters a chance to see what it was all about and to decide if they want more. I for one am hoping that it happens. I found this movie to be enjoyable and action filled, a horror story with some oomph. Let's hope enough other people find the same thing so the series can continue.",1388448000,3,3450,4.38125

So many people are comparing this to the Twilight movies, so here's my two cents on that:  This is far superior to the first Twilight; comparable to the last.  Having loved the Twilight series, I walked away from the first movie totally disappointed.  (Acting, script, special effects, makeup.  Not good.)  I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome of Mortal Instruments and was thoroughly entertained.  They did a great job with what little budget they had.  Lily Collins was fantastic as Clary and after many reservations with who they cast as Jace, I was impressed with his performance.  I could have done without the Magnus Bane they chose; just didn't seem to fit the bill.  I very rarely see movies twice in the theater, but I couldn't help myself with this one.  I liked it that much.  It's a shame this picture didn't get the hype and props it deserved.  It's so much better than many other movies geared towards teens.

Lily Collins has grown a lot in the acting department since the horrible Snow White as well as Abduction, but she's still more of a pretty face than a great actress.

  I have read most of Cassandra Clare's books and have really enjoyed them.  I don't liken them to Twilight as much as the TV show Grimm.  That being said, two of the main characters were not at all as presented in the book.  Jace is supposed to be an extremely handsome guy who is witty, arrogant, and obnoxious.  Not so in the movie. . .  The character of Valentine was supposed to be charmingly handsome with an evil side - again, not so.
  Even if you leave the book out of it and just take the movie by itself - it had lots and lots of plot holes.  If I hadn't read the books, I would have been lost most of the time.  Very little in character development or even in development of the background stories of the characters.

5307639,2,B009AMAKWM,I read all the books and the movie was not very good.  I don't understand why producers don't understand that the people who read these books want a movie that atleast does justice to the story line - this movie fails.,1388275200,,218,4.317073170731708
5307640,3,B009AMAKWM,"I watched the movie before reading the book. After viewing I had the feeling it did the book a huge disservice and bought the book the next day.  After both watching and reading  I learned the movie loosely follows the original story. Basically they took elements from 'City of Bones'  swapped the sequences of events, inserted or left characters out, failed to fully explain the silent brothers, or other details that contribute significantly to the fantasy world of Cassandra Clare.  I am sure budget constraints  are the culprit to the movie industry failure to yet again bring a rich teen fantasy to life. They should have hired the screenwriters from the Twilight Saga or Lord of the Rings because they nailed it to write the script. This is why they were able to make more than one movie, not a future I foresee for the Mortal Instruments, paralleling closely the the movie/book 'Eragon' by Christopher Paolini, another  enchanting read with an even poor representation in the movie world. Nonetheless, the movie has some great CGI inserted appropriately, Jamie Campbell Bower did an amazing job as Jace, and can be enjoyable just do not expect to be blown away if you have read the book.",1388275200,,1194,4.828431372549019
5307641,5,B009AMAKWM,I loved the fact the movie was true to the book. I Also enjoyed the chemistry between all main characters in the movie.,1388275200,2,119,4.217391304347826

5307643,4,B009AMAKWM,"Like many fans, I read the book before seeing the movie. While there ARE quite a few changes from the book, the film is still enjoyable and retains the essence of the story. The casting is excellent. I recommend this movie.",1388275200,2,223,4.463414634146342
5307644,5,B009AMAKWM,I enjoyed the movie because I read the book after the movie.  As a movie they did an excellent job.  However the people who make movies from books need to keep the readers imagines in mind.,1388275200,,189,4.222222222222222
5307645,1,B009AMAKWM,"I tried this book out because I had had so many students recommend it. The first thing I found not to my liking was the writing style. It was a bit too juvenile for me. Also, the story itself had too many supernatural components to it. Did the story really need shadow hunters, demons, vampires, AND werewolves? I think it could have been a bit more focused on the plot line and the characters could have been better developed. I know that this book is meant for teenagers, but it doesn't mean that quality should be sacrificed in order to appease the masses.",1388275200,,559,4.436893203883495
5307666,4,B009AMAKWM,Movie was good and worth watching. A sequel based on the next book would be great. The only problem is that it was predictable like other YA movies. It fell short of the book. If there is a sequel hopefully it meets up to the book.,1388275200,2,231,4.043478260869565

5307674,5,B009AMAKWM,"I found this movie by accident, I never even heard anything about it. This is surprising, because it's exactly the type of story I enjoy and it came out five months ago already. I really loved it. The actors were perfectly cast, the story was funny, bittersweet, hopeful, romantic and action packed, and visually, a treat. It was pure entertainment, just the kind of movie I was hoping to find to take me away from the ""mundane"" world, LOL! I have a new appreciation for Jamie Bower, who made the whole experience so much fun. I hope they make the sequels for the whole series of books, which I also plan to check out, now.",1388188800,3,623,4.426086956521739
5307675,4,B009AMAKWM,"People who did not like this movie obviously don't like this genre. I love this genre and pretty much inhale new book releases. Sometimes I don't like certain books or movies, cough Twilight cough, but that is not part of this review. I'm no teenager but this is a fun, fast-paced movie. The reason I gave it only four stars was that I don't like the way Jace was portrayed. I didn't feel like the actor looked like the part and the first kiss really didn't do it for me. Usually, the romance part is what I love about this type of movie and the fact that I disliked the main guy and still liked the movie speaks volumes. I actually found the bad guy, Valentine, way hotter. I'd recommend to watch it, it's definitely entertaining.",1388188800,,731,4.382352941176471
5307696,2,B009AMAKWM,"so many things were left out or changed it is very different than the book. Someone not familiar with the books will be confused at parts and put off at others. I was severely disappointed.

5307697,2,B009AMAKWM,"Who has time to keep track of all of these characters? Not me.  Maybe it is a good read, but if you are introduced to the story by the movie, prepare for a lot of confusion.  I am not willing to make that kind of investment.",1388188800,,224,3.847826086956522
5307698,4,B009AMAKWM,I love this movie. It pulled me in from the beginning.  I love the ending are they really brother and sister. Wow that kinda different thing for them to do. I love the other things going around the story. I can't wait for the sequel.,1388188800,,233,4.177777777777778
5307699,5,B009AMAKWM,"I discovered this quite by accident, and had never heard of the book(s), but I like this genre, such as ""Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell"", ""Maximum Ride"", Harry Potter, the Dresden Files, etc.

I found the characters deep, well developed,and interesting, the plot better than average, and the visual feast exceeded expectations. I hope to see more of Jamie Bower in the future.

Movies and books are separate art forms, much like sculptures and paintings - comparisons are simply not valid; each has its advantages.",1388188800,,515,5.047058823529412
5307700,5,B009AMAKWM,"I read some reviews that were upset with the story line, but if you read the books and really enjoyed them you would know they did a great job cramming a lot of content into this movie.  Yes I would have liked more heat, but to bring all of that from the book to the movie would have broken it up into two or three movies. I'm not to sure I would have liked to have to have waited.  I can't wait for the next movie!",1388188800,,415,3.813953488372093

5307702,3,B009AMAKWM,Thought the movie was cute. There was a few cheesy scenes like with the vampire fight. Thought the portal with the demons entering the place was a little lame. Reminded me of Ghost Busters a bit. lol  I really like Jonathan Meyers and Lena Headey. I think their both wonderful actors.  Their really why I kept watching. Bower is a good actor too. Wasn't thrilled with Collins acting. But overall it was an interesting story. I am sure the book is better. Always is.,1388102400,,465,4.523809523809524
5307703,5,B009AMAKWM,Love this movie. My kids have watched it probably 20 times. I really Hope they keep making them. It's one of my favorites,1388102400,,121,4.304347826086956
5307704,4,B009AMAKWM,"It's been a while since I read the first 3 books in this series (and I haven't read 4 or 5) so the book wasn't ""fresh"" when I watched the movie. IMO they did a pretty good job following the book but I wish they would've expanded a bit with the secondary characters because I feel they got lost behind Clary & Jace. I get C&J are the main attraction but the books had a way so that the secondary characters like Luke, Isabel & Simon didn't feel so ""left out"".  I hope they continue with making the series into movies.",1388102400,,516,4.108910891089109
5307705,3,B009AMAKWM,This was about a girl who felt that there was something different about her and her mother who kept a big secret from her. About finding yourself and knowing who you really are.,1388102400,,177,4.393939393939394
5307726,3,B009AMAKWM,"Mostly this movie looks great, sort of laying a Gothic blanket over Manhattan and strangely enough, it looks good. Great looking actors, most of whom are British, with the odd Canadian thrown in, but all with plenty of talent to spare. Fantasy and science fiction fans are going to recognize a lot of familiar, formulaic motifs, and I found myself a little exasperated with the lack of originality in the reveals as the movie progressed, but the fight coordination is terrific, and the action sequences, although they are big and broad at times, don't get Michael Bay big, so you're not just watching the endless tumbling of colorful CGI shrapnel. Far easier to watch than a Twilight movie, and somewhat less convoluted than Game of Thrones, it's interesting to look at, and worth your time if you like urban fantasy and can handle a few, ""you're kidding me?"" moments.",1388102400,,868,4.832214765100671
5307727,5,B009AMAKWM,"Based on the the movie critic reviews, I was expecting this movie version of City of Bones to be mediocre, but I was wrong. It was a great rendition of the book.  The two main characters, Clary and Jace, have great chemistry and the acting was also very good.  Loved the casting -- Valentine is perfect, even if he looks more like a biker rebel than the Valentine I envisioned, Magnus Bane is as eccentric as even, and Simon is geeky but cute (although he doesn't play in a band in the movie). The soundtrack is also great.  I thought the back story on the shadow hunters and where Clary's mother fits in was also well done, so I am not certain why some critics found the storyline confusing.  The special effects were well done and I especially enjoyed the scene where the Silent Brothers try to reclaim Clary's memories -- very clever.

I watched the film with my family and even my husband found it entertaining and is looking forward to the next installment.  I would highly recommend this movie verison of The Mortal Instruments.",1388102400,,1034,4.532258064516129
5307728,3,B009AMAKWM,"I really enjoyed reading ""The Mortal Instruments"" series. Unfortunately, as all too often happens, there are always comparisons to ""Twilight,"" ""The Host,"" ""Lord of the Rings"" and other well written fantasy books. I believe ""The Mortal Instruments"" book series can stand on their own.

Too bad the movie wasn't produced to stand on its own against the recent blockbusters of ""Twilight"", ""Lord of the Rings"" and now ""The Hobbit."" The books give human characters some very nice realistic touches. However, the screen-play was more like a made for TV version of some well crafted literature. While I will sit down and watch almost any movie on DVD more than once, twice sort of did it for me with this film. There was no subtle or nuanced developement of plot or character in this film that required a second (or third) viewing. Oh well, it was on sale at WalMart, so no great loss.",1388102400,,878,4.738562091503268
5307729,3,B009AMAKWM,"I loved the books and was excited to see the film...sadly, the casting was way off on Jace who was supposed to be angelic and extremely handsome. Instead, they went with an Arian-neo-Nazi looking male lead...very distracting.",1388102400,,225,5.108108108108108
5307730,1,B009AMAKWM,"My only consolation is that I didn't waste $10 to see it in theaters.

5307732,5,B009AMAKWM,"I really loved this, I really hope they continue to put the rest of the series to film. I enjoyed all the characters in the film and i really like how the kiss and tension between Jace and Clary was just so real unlike some other movies i have seen. all the characters/actors just clicked, i have watched this four times now, once at the movies and three times since buying the dvd.

5307734,2,B009AMAKWM,"The book is so much better than this movie, also key parts were changed in the movie. It had a lot of potential but was poorly done directed and seemed low budget which is odd since you know millions of people probably went to see it..",1388016000,,235,4.130434782608695
5307735,3,B009AMAKWM,"The idea of magical things going on behind the scenes on a big city is a fun idea full of possibilities, but the main story line seemed to get too obsessed with itself.  Children of a dysfunctional family that reunite and fix things is not very satisfying.  Perhaps children of broken homes will find more in common with the story, but it fell flat for me.  Other than that, it was interesting seeing them piece things together and wonder the streets of the hidden city sites.  I think they could really have developed that better.",1388016000,,531,4.557894736842106

5307757,3,B009AMAKWM,This movie wasn't too bad it just never took off and they left you wondering about several different things but rather in that it was a decent movie if I can find it cheap enough I probably would buy it give this a rating of 10 stars I would have to give it maybe 6 1/2 stars.,1388016000,,276,3.8596491228070176

5307763,1,B009AMAKWM,"I'm stunned that this movie got good reviews. Yes, I am a fan of the books, and no, I don't think this movie stinks because it's so unlike the books. It just stinks. First, Jonathan Rhys Meyers' acting is horrible. He is trying to play a mad man and comes off like it is his first acting gig. It is always scary when the kids' acting is better than the adults'. Perhaps Hollywood was having a sale on pyrotechnics, and that's why there is zero sword play and an over abundance of flame throwing. Zero creativity on the demons. What a waste of Jared Harris. The whole concept of the Shadowhunters' connection to angels is non-existent in this film, and that is the most intriguing part of the story. I'm wholly disappointed that what could have been super-fun entertainment fell so flat.",1387929600,4,786,4.542253521126761
5307764,3,B009AMAKWM,Compared to the book this movie was not the greatest. Judged independently this was a pretty good movie. I loved the action scenes and the chemistry between Clary and Jace was believable and enjoyable. I was disappointed in Magnus. He was way to serious; And Alec was way to intense. All in all a good movie that I will watch many times. ,1387929600,,338,4.451612903225806

5307787,3,B009AMAKWM,I would have given it 3.5 stars but couldn't. I usually rate a show high if I would like to see it again soon. I probably wouldn't see it again unless someone else was watching it.,1387843200,,180,4.027777777777778
5307788,3,B009AMAKWM,"It was actually a decent movie especially if your into fantasy genre. Definitely a teenage girl coming of age movie with the mysterious pretty boy introducing her to a world she never knew, sound familiar? I think the plot pulls from a lot of other stories, a young girl whose memories are blocked, a mother who has kept her past a secret, a faithful friend of the family who is a secret guardian, and the unfortunate circumstances that lead to the mother not telling the daughter the truth before everything starts catching up to them, and it falls on the daughter to figure everything out about what happened, discovering new powers she never had before, and saving the day. Typical fantasy story lines and possibly why the movie didn't do so well because it has been told before. I think there was a lot of possibilities with the elements of the story, but I kept thinking how it reminded me of the whole Twilight story of the girl falling in love with the mysterious stranger and completely oblivious to the affections of the childhood friend even to the point of rejecting him completely. I kind of thought that was weird to do, especially when the love interest turns out to be her brother.",1387843200,,1196,4.619718309859155

I heard the book was good, but I heard the same thing about Beautiful Creatures, which also was another bad movie. I think I need to be more careful with my movie selection and stay away from these YA adaptations.",1387670400,,360,4.231884057971015
5307804,2,B009AMAKWM,This movie passed the time well enough when there was nothing else to watch. I would not recommend this movie and do not plan to buy any book or movie sequels from the series.,1387670400,,175,4.176470588235294

I read this book a long time ago so I couldn't remember much of it but I can defiantly tell that this movie wasn't it. This movie was poorly executed. Acting was cheesey and down right bad. The movie did a poor job of explaining the story and so I was pretty lost even with having read the book. Nope, I will not be watching nor recommending this movie to anyone. Amazon you did good and provided my service wonderfully... It's just the movie that was a dissapointment",1387670400,,547,4.5353535353535355

5307838,1,B009AMAKWM,"I reluctantly read the first book and immediately loved them all. I was excited to see this, I liked the cast, but the movie was god awful. I don't ever expect a movie to be exactly like a book, I don't want to watch an 8 hour film. I do, however, expect them to keep all of they story dependent events intact; they changed a few key events that would actually make the rest of the story not happen the way it is supposed to.
Other than that, the movie was drawn out pretty long for such minimal content. It was like a football game, seconds of actual story interrupted by wandering mindlessly until the next few seconds.

If you want to watch good adaptions, try the new Percy Jackson movie, it was splendid!",1387584000,,709,4.291044776119403
5307839,3,B009AMAKWM,Casting was wrong. didn't fit characters in the book. To much let out of the movie. The movie was rushed. Tried to get to much of the story in to quickly and lost the effect of the true story. Valentine was an old man. Not a young man. Chase's trainer was oriental and his mentor. Carly had no idea she could make new Runes. In the movie she just started making them. The demon cycles were left out of the first movie. The boat explosion. The brother and sister caste was total wrong. The boy was tall and very handsome. He was in love with Chase. The girls had long white blonde hair.  Both were tall in the movie it was just all wrong. Sorry I thought it was a bad attempt to make a movie from the book. Try again and get th casting right. Make two movies to get in the whole story correctly if need be for book 1. It's the most important book.,1387584000,,846,4.065868263473054

5307842,3,B009AMAKWM,"I generally read the book before seeing the movie. In this case the movie actually made me like one of the characters more. In the book the character is very whinny and pathetic but in the movie, while he is still pathetic and whinny, it was less so and worked within the movie.",1387584000,,278,4.264150943396227
5307843,2,B009AMAKWM,"This movie had its share of eye candy effects, though the compositing was a bit off on a number of scenes, but that is where the fun ended. The dialog was stilted and contrived feeling, The characters were not developed well and came of 2 dimensional at best. There was a total lack of understanding of comedic timing in the delivery of the one-liners, some of which would have made Schwarzenegger groan in embarrassment. These gems were presumably for comic relief but there was never enough dramatic pressure developed to require relief so all fell flat.
The direction was atrocious and so consistently so that it is hard to blame the actors for the performances they turned in even though they came off like a bunch of under rehearsed understudies of local theater children on their opening night.
Pounder was totally wasted in her cliche role as was Harris. And how did Gao get his role?
Things really got disgusting when we came to the love scene in the greenhouse. This awkward attempt to make the movie even worse than the Twilight franchise came off like a sick Disney soap opera scene and the song that played over the childish slobbering, which had all the charm of a cold sore, was perhaps the worst I have experienced in recent cinematic excursions.
Out of the entire cast, Sheehan and Turner turned in decent performances in spite of the lack of direction.
Not since the Golden Compass have I seen such a sad destruction of a novel in a movie. This is not a rant on the movie not being like the book except in as much as the book was actually well done. No, this is a rant on a movie that never even started to create the world for its characters to inhabit and never really gave its characters life to inhabit it with.
Epic Fail",1387584000,,1742,4.515822784810126

Magnus more sarcastic, and Valentine less aggressive and more charming. But I know they will fix those for the next.",1387324800,,448,4.6

I loved the books, but I had low expectations for the movie. I was happily surprised.  The movie didn't blow me away, but it was much better than I thought it would be. The first surprise was Jamie Campbell Bower as Jace. I was disappointed when they cast him, because I didn't think he was ""beautiful"" enough; however he was totally smoldering in this role and I feel like such a cougar saying that.  Lily Collins? eh, she was ok. No doubt, very pretty...but a little boring.  Hence the reason I did not give it 5 stars. otherwise, yeah - they made some changes to the story line, but honestly - it's been so long since I've read the books, that it really didn't bother me.  This isn't an Academy Award winning performance, but it's good mindless entertainment.  This is the kind of movie that I can watch when I'm in the mood for a good ""chick flick"".

5307989,1,B009AMAKWM,"Like other commenters, I don't want to be mean for the sake of being mean, however I was so excited to see this movie and had such high hopes about falling in love with it that I was completely aghast when the film ""adaptation"" was a horrendously maimed parody of a beloved book. I left the theater repeatedly and came back with the naivete that it may redeem itself over time only to be physically angry at how dishonest they were to the story.

Please understand: I am not nit picking over one (or ten) character(s) or scenes that were glossed over to save running time. On the contrary, I understand things must be cut to make a book into a movie. Harry Potter did it and still held the major story line. Hunger Games is remarkably similar to its books (all things considered). Heck, even TWILIGHT resembled its namesake. This was just an abomination. I actually felt like the filmakers were actively laughing at the audience by undermining the original work so deeply at every critical point of the film. If I were to take a shot everytime they reversed the plot, I'd be dead before it was half over.

The acting was bland at best (though admittedly even the best actors couldn't salvage a script this bad) and the story so disjunctured I don't how anyone could watch it without reading the books and make any sense of it. Trying to watch the film objectively was impossible because of how little background information the audience receives and how desperately the film is want for a storyline.

tl;dr: If you've never read the books and feel like watching something you find on daytime TV and leave on for your cats to watch while you're out running errands, this is it.

For anyone who has read the books, just blindly hate it; you'll still have a better opinion than those of us who saw it, but will save yourself two hours of your life.",1387238400,3,1845,4.514970059880239
5307990,1,B009AMAKWM,"I read the book before seeing the movie and I wish I had not done so.  This was the first time in my life that I ever walked out of a theater.  I like Lily Collins but this was not the role for her.  There was absolutely no chemistry between her and the actor who played Jace on-screen.  Their dialogue felt forced and unnatural.  Furthermore, Kevin Zegers (Alec) looked uncomfortable (like he had an upset stomach or something) throughout the entire movie.

So many aspects of the book were left out of the movie that I wondered if they were trying to rewrite the book on-screen.  I tried to move on to the second book and just couldn't get through half of it with the vision of these actors in my head as I read.  This was a total disappointment.",1387238400,2,748,4.292857142857143
5307991,2,B009AMAKWM,"To be fair, I have never read the books so I have no idea of how good a translation to the screen this was.  But as a new patron, I had high hopes for the film after the first 20 minutes or so.  Then, things started to unravel.  It's hard to say exactly where.  I mean, the conservatively religious folks among us will have no end of objectionable content, but for me, it was simply that the film dragged on... especially when the romance was introduced.  The protagonist was only slightly more tolerable than Twilight's Bella, but that's not exactly a Toastmaster endorsement.  The acting was valiant, but the characters were simply more of the same ""protagonist finds out she's secretly a super-being and must be taught (and find love) in those like her.""  I'd say this is probably for the 16-19 age range.",1387238400,,808,4.569444444444445

I have read all of the books that have been released and in the first book a lot of what is in the film did not actually happen in the book. For instance in the beginning of the movie where Jace killed the demon in the apartment;Clary actually did that in the book. Not to mention the scene where they go rescue Simon from the vampires ( In the book Simon was turned into a rat) and it was just Clary and Jace that rescued him, not all of them. And at the end of the movie when Jace is battling Valentine and Clary saved him and she still had the mortal cup in the card, well that's not what happens in the book. In the book it was Luke battling Valentine and Valentine got away with the cup. I can go on and on how different the book is from the actual movie but in all actuality it doesn't matter. This movie was great and I am happy that their going to make the next book into a movie ( hopefully more like the book this time) I hope they make the entire series into movies,because it's one thing to read a book and picture it in your mind and another to see it happening. This movie still kept me entertained. I thought it was great. Can't wait for the next movie to come out. And for those who haven't read the books and only watch the movies well you missed one he'll of a good read.",1387065600,2,1366,4.025735294117647

Jamie Bower was ok as well- he did seem a bit flat and rushed in parts, very one dimensional. However, this movie is not a terrible way to spend 2 hours.",1386979200,,369,4.068493150684931

I did not much care for the actors chosen in the roles.  In my opinion: Jace (Jaime Campbell Bower) is stoic instead of sarcastically charming. Clary (Lilly Collins) just feels wrong to me. Simon (Robert Sheehan) would have made a better Alec (Kevin Zegers, although he was ok). Magnus however, (Godfrey Gao) was quite entertaining, however I had pictured Jonathan Rhys Meyers in the role as I read the book. It is still an entertaining movie.",1386979200,,609,4.62962962962963

I watched because I love fantasy/supernatural type of movies, and I really enjoyed it. I really think movies should stand on their own--when they have been adapted from books. They should be movies that anyone can see and enjoy even when they haven't read the book. And this movie was definitely worth watching for me. I may even read the book at some point (although I don't usually read books if I've seen the movie first--it usually spoils the book for me) because I liked the story and the characters.

It was so good my wife even got hooked and has now watched it more times than me. Of course, not all things are the same, but I think that you're an idiot if you expected it to be exactly the same. Books are so much better than movies because we can explain things with our words that we cant really do with current graphics. Words are free, graphics are far from cheap.

5308081,5,B009AMAKWM,"From the first movie preview I saw earlier this year (2013) I was hooked. Upon watching the movie I went on-line and moved the Book Series from my ""wish list"" to my shopping cart. The movie and the book have to be appreciated as separate pieces of art based on a similar story line, one should not get hung up on the details of what is missing from one and doesn't complete the other because you'll never see the full ""picture"" of either. The movie is faster paced and some of the side stories we get from the text are not delivered in the movie but a movie will never have all of the detail a printed novel has, if it did one film might turn out to be as much as 10 hours long!

I personally loved the movie, no spoilers here but I am curious to see how the second installment fills in the gaps and completes the story changes where the first film and first book are different. I enjoyed the actors and the only character I found truly off (but not disappointingly so) was Isabelle, Jenna is beautiful and talented she's just not exactly the powerful almost Amazonian figure I was anticipating from reading about Izzy in the books. The others - Jamie, Lilly, Robert, Kevin, Aiden, etc. make a nice ensemble to the cast and I look forward to the second movie should they hopefully make it.",1386892800,,1289,4.3264462809917354

But I have to speak up if it can stop someone from spending the money to rent this, especially if you read the books and enjoyed them even a tiny bit.

It was terrible. It was painful. I don't know why I watched the whole thing. My partner turned to me and said, ""So. That was like Eragon."" The only movie we've never finished because it was so bad. There are so many changes from the book that I don't even know where to start. And I'm not talking about book fans being upset that every plot point didn't fit in. I'm talking about changing characters so severely that a heroine now turns into a simpering, hysterical woman who must be ""mansplained"" back to rationality in a raining alleyway so that the plot can progress. Horrible.

If you enjoyed the books, read them. But don't spend your $5 or $6 renting this. And whoever gave it 4 stars, welp. You're absolutely entitled to your opinion and I'm really glad you enjoyed it. I usually find positive aspects even in movies that get savaged by the critics (mostly), so that ought to tell you something if I'm willing to speak up about how disjointed they made this adaptation.

Stop trying to rush out the movie versions of YA blockbusters in hopes of riches without paying some top-notch screenwriters to get it right. It ends up costing the production in the end, with horrible press and fan disappointment leading to diminished sequel potential. Let's see. Percy Jackson: hot mess. Mortal Instruments: hot mess.

The character/actor that i liked best was Magnus Bane/Godfrey Gao.  He comes across as being very wise, but has been around long enough that he can't be bothered with anyone else's rules.

The acting and the casting is pretty good. I know both Lily Collins and Jamie Campbell Bower to be great actors as well as many other notables in the cast. The pacing of this movie and the writing was just awful. As someone who read the book, I was confused by the ending and what was going on, so I'm not sure how bad it was for my friends who didn't.

However, I did take issue with the characterization changes (particularly how mild Jace seemed--he's supposed to be cold and quite rude to Clary at first). Clary was better characterized though I still felt like she was a little less take charge than she normally is. And the scene in the garden was completely ridiculous.

That being said, just because I love the genre doesn't mean I love everything that comes out in the YA/supernatural world of books and movies.

Now I'm sorry I didn't.  No book to movie adaptation is ever going to be perfect, but I thought they did an awesome job of sticking to the storyline, and I actually thought the acting was very good.  No super corny moments to groan over.

I read somewhere that they were ""postponing"" production of the second movie because the first didn't have as great of a turn out as expected.

5308225,4,B009AMAKWM,"Gotta give credit where credit is due. Of all the wannabe Twilight flicks, at least the ones I've seen, this production comes closest to capturing the core essence of that very successful film.

Engaging and well acted, I had a very decent time screening this movie. While not broaching any new cinematic ground and the plot pretty much lifted from any number of similar films from Buffy to, again, Twilight - the cast did an excellent job of carving out their own place in the on-going YA battlefield.

As the movie opens, we're introduced to beautiful Clary growing up in NYC.

And Clary is what's known as a ""mundane"" - in every respect a normal average human. But there is nothing normal or average about this young woman. In fact, she's a blood descendant of The Shadow Hunters - just like her mother.

For reasons unexplained - mom has chosen to obscure her daughter's heritage. By way of an annual warlock pilgrimage, a spell has been cast that keeps Clary's memory repressed and her abilities in check. But upon reaching her late teens, the spell requires more frequent and powerful adjustments. The barrier is showing signs of collapse; she's beginning to see the hidden glyphs and runes emblazoned into the real world.

Unfortunately, as Clary begins to see into the shadows, so too the shadows begins to see her. Her recovered abilities exposing her presence to the darkness.

Like firing off a flare gun on a dark night - she's been noticed.

Her family assaulted, their home violated. She now understands the terrible price for her new insight. Worse, her mom and step-dad are missing. Suddenly, she's under attack from demons, vampires, and ghoulish monsters of all stripes. The warlock gives her a parting warning: The people whom she trusts, the Shadow Hunters, were in fact hunting her mother.

As both Light and Dark rediscovers the hidden hunter, both sides maneuver and manipulate in order to control. One way or another - Clary must be ""taken"". Facing lies, half-truths and betrayal - friends and enemies become a blur. She no longer knows whom to trust or what her hidden secret will ultimately reveal.

Again, no argument, this is a derivative and unapologetic copy of a better original. But because this was also a fun flick with good performances delivered by solid players, and built on an engaging screenplay with very minor plot holes - I'll put away the usual acidic barbs this kind of cookie-cutter production usually generates.

Additionally, the special effects were really good. Nothing new, but rather, appropriate. Instead of being done to show off some expensive digital wizardry, Director Harald Zwart used it - as it was always meant to be used - to compliment the story; adding effects only as a highlight to an already engaging tale.

Overall, very glad to have taken the time to screen this film. It was not time wasted.

Personal Notes:

- Could've done without the syrupy arboretum scene. Much too sappy. Though not much better, I prefer the Twilight mountain version.

- Very pleased that a favorite actor - Kevin Durand - got a small role in this production. Always good to see a talented performer who, in my estimation, deserves an expanded spotlight in the industry.",1386460800,,3214,4.851919561243144

5308232,5,B009AMAKWM,"Let me start off with the fact that I saw this movie BEFORE reading the books. In fact, the whole reason I decided to read the books in the first place was because I liked the movie so much.

So now, after reading all the books (save for City of Heavenly Fire, of course), I can give my honest opinion.

City of Bones was a great movie, and the actors and actresses cast were all spot on. Lily Collins (Clary) and Jamie Campbell Bower (Jace) are exactly as the book describes them, down to their chemistry and snarky, hard-headed personalities. I think I especially like the fact that the movie isn't heavily based on CGI, and everything that could be done with makeup and prosthesis gave things a more realistic feel.

I'm one of those people that understands why movies aren't always exactly like the books. Don't get me wrong, it's great when movies are literally a book coming to life, but sometimes change is necessary. As Cassandra Clare has said, the books are hers and the movie is not. If Cassie likes the movie, I see no reason why fans should be more negative. After all, The Mortal Instruments series is her own personal creation, and there is no better authority on whether or not this movie successfully brought City of Bones to life.",1386460800,,1248,4.5377777777777775

Too few hotties and too many pretty boys for my taste, but a decent fantasy flick. Would've liked better fight scenes. Enjoy MFJLabs 3x",1386460800,,337,5.017857142857143
5308254,4,B009AMAKWM,"Mortal Instruments is a movie about a young girl (Lily Collins) whose life is upended when she realizes that she's part of a long line of demon-slayers in the movie adaptation of Cassandra Clare's first book in her series.

Having not been familiar with the books or not even seeing really any advertisements for this when it was in theaters (which could account for why it didn't do well in theaters), I was really in the dark about the Mortal Instruments movie.  I wasn't really sure what to expect and frankly didn't have high expectations and though it was some sort of Twilight clone.  And to a certain extent it does mimic several different movies before it, it does remind me a bit of Twilight, Underworld and others as it tries to be a bit of all of those movies.  But even with all of that, I was pleasantly surprised at this movie.  I am not a Twilight fan but definitely an Underworld fan and I found that this movie had enough elements of each to balance out and make a good story.  I really don't think this movie deserves the criticism that it is getting from those who are trashing it and comparing to Twilight.  Maybe this movie suffers from Twilight fatigue, I don't know but it is really worth watching.  The action is good and entertaining and keeps the movie from stalling for very long and has very nice pacing.  The special effects are good and the scenery very well done.  My only real issue is that they fail to really tie up any loose ends in the movie, which of course for any movie these days is setting up for the sequel.  The question is now whether there will be a sequel due to its box office numbers.  A shame too as this movie is much better than the ticket sales really show.",1386460800,2,1709,4.3734177215189876

I'll admit it's not all that similar to the book but the book is really long and the way they changed things doesn't really bother me. I was leery of the lead male actor because I did't like him in the other movies he'd been in but he did very well in this, I was surprised. I love the action, the soundtrack, just about everything.

Seriously this was awful. The story made little sense and the parts that do make sense are ripped off from Star Wars.

5308261,1,B009AMAKWM,"I didn't read the books. I was confused during most of the film. It was fragmented and didn't introduce characters or storylines properly, just threw them in, no background. And I still don't know what the all-important magic cup was for.

There isn't much romance in this. The main character is a Standard One Unit: Teen with Super Powers Who Doesn't Know It named Clarry. She spends 3/4ths of the film running and screaming in terror. At one point she is told by her supposed father, Valentine, that her romantic interest, Jace, is actually her brother. Ewww. Even when she is ""sure"" that Valentine can't be her father, the mere mention of incest leaves a sick feeling in the viewer about their romance. I can't imagine what the author was thinking when she wrote that.

There were inadvertently funny things like, the actors had the worst tattoos ever. Their bodies looked like they had been scribbled on by kindergartners with black magic marker. And the Magnus character wearing booty shorts and a dress jacket looked like he was missing his pants.",1386374400,4,1053,4.8121546961325965

5308263,1,B009AMAKWM,"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE! Normally, I do not mind it when movies take liberties from books, because movies and books are completely different mediums. Whoever put the work in to this adaptation should be applauded for somehow combining two of the absolute worst traits a movie can have: clich and confusing. All the lore that made the book series stand out from its competitors was reduced to werewolves, vampires, magic, love triangle. Great thing they did this, we don't have enough of those horrendous movies to begin with. On top of that, they would drop plot points, never refer to them again, quickly move on to the next plot point, and ultimately you are left with a massive ball of inconsistent and contradictory dialogue that leaves the viewer completely perplexed. Please, please do not buy this movie. The production company behind this movie does not deserve to make the next book into a movie. Do not give them the incentive to ruin a great book.
Just to put how bad this movie is into perspective, all Twilight movies received a better rating from critics than this hunk of garbage that is a sorry excuse for a movie. If you're not a big reader, just listen to the books on tape. If you don't want to do that either, then don't. That's better than you watching this movie.",1386374400,12,1303,4.5965665236051505

I'm hoping they do the sequel, but am uncertain how successful the movie was in the box office (and if they can get the same cast back together).  I would definitely give this movie a chance.

When Jace recognizes Valentine as Valentine but doesn't know he's his father, that's when I totally lost it. Other than the fact that there are shadow hunters and a mortal cup this was a completely different story and a disappointing one at that. This could have been an amazing movie with the right adaptation but instead whoever is responsible for this killed the entire future of the movie franchise (2nd and 3rd movies were scrapped as a result of poor box office results). If I was Cassandra Clare I would be livid, but as a lover of the world and characters she created I'm just sad that this was screwed up so badly that I'm now robbed of the chance to see the rest of this amazing story unfold on screen.

I mean I know screenwriters take liberties but they re-wrote too much of the plot and changed the so much that it would have been better to have not read the books. I was more disappointed than I had excepted to be. I mean it one thing to omit miner details but it's another to change key parts of the story that important to later scenes and plot lines. Also to change the general essence of some characters like Valentine, who is suppose to be charismatic, dashing, cunning, and sleek; not a Attila the Hun with ragged braids. I laughed that awful, unnecessary weave job. I mean his crazy was to lie just below the surface it's hard to believe that anyone would follow the sociopath presented in this adaptation, at any point in time. Also, the movie moved so quickly through the first half of the story and dragged and added to the last half it was a jumbled mess. It would have been better to actually explain things for viewers who hadn't read the books. Instead of throwing them head long into the action.

After all the detail and hard work Clare put into the book. Anyway - one of the things I had the biggest problem with was the on screen chemistry between Collins and Bower. They couldn't have picked two actors that depicted absolutely no chemistry! I was skeptical about choosing the two of them to play Clary and Jace, but the two of them put on a REALLY GOOD performance. I have to give the writers credit as well, they really stuck to the book for the most part and did a wonderful job keeping, I think, most of the readers happy. I was also a little bit disappointed that they couldn't have made Collins wear a red wig or at least ask her to dye her hair a little more orange for the part. Other than these silly two things, I thought it was a SERIOUSLY well played movie and was definitely true to the book. I would recommend to anyone that has read the book and even those that love sci-fy, the supernatural and romance. It truly has it all.",1386288000,,1110,4.265402843601896
5308326,5,B009AMAKWM,"Just finished watching the film and I have to say I was very impressed at all they'd managed to cram into the film.  I read the book about 9 months ago...sorry, tried to read, I fell asleep a dozen times at how boringly slow the book pace was.  Being descriptive is great, but not to the point where you nod off waiting for some action.  The movie gave you all the action and cut out the snooze fest!  I have yet to finish the book and don't think I will.  If the powers that be do not follow this movie with sequels, I will have to wait for the authors last book to come out.  If the reviews prove that Jace and Clary have a HEA as they are not siblings, I'll give the books another shot. Not that I'm all about the romance, but I happen to like happy endings and good kicking evil's butt.  As to the movie itself, I was never bored and I never felt myself comparing it to another series as others seem to have done.  I did have Jace pictured in my head slightly different than the actor, but ten minutes in and I felt he nailed the part.  Remember people, these are teenage characters, do not expect them to show extreme maturity because of the circumstances they find themselves in.  As for Lily Collins, I enjoyed her in Mirror Mirror.  The Clary character in the book was annoying at times, but not as much as other heroines I've read. (cough, Katniss Everdeen, cough) and I found myself wanting to mentally slap her around a bit...not so with movie Clary.  I think Collins improved the character and I didn't feel the 'slap her' urge once.  This is one of the reasons I enjoyed the movie better than the book.

So, to sum it all up -- I very much enjoyed this movie.  The action never stopped.  The storyline was great and I found 2 hours and 10 minutes flying by.  There, of course, is a lot of information that was left out of the movie, but I never found myself missing the parts that weren't there. (like Simon turning into a rat by the vamps at the party and the heroes taking ad nauseum chapters to get him back to rights.)",1386288000,2,2035,4.217054263565892

The characters of Jace and Clary are fairly vivid, but the supporting cast - so much of what makes the story come to life in Cassandra Clare's world - is allowed such little development that I found myself not caring whether they even lived or died. The pacing of the entire film just felt wrong. There is so much to the world of the Shadowhunters and of these characters that could have been explored, but the filmmakers seemed to take every wrong shortcut, from the weird twist of 'demons possessing humans' (not a part of The Mortal Instruments world, at all) to the 'portal in the middle of the Institute' (not to be a purist, but why wasn't Magnus given a larger role as the person who CREATES portals for the Shadowhunters?). The integral role of Downworld among Shadowhunters was never shown.

I did love the performance Jamie Campbell Bower gave as Jace, and I loved the 'look' of the Shadowhunters and the atmosphere of the film. It feels very New York, which is nice, as Cassandra Clare does a fantastic job of making places feel real in all of her books. I only wish the film had done justice to the vividly drawn world she had already provided, but if this film makes people read her books, it will be worth it.

But they really couldn't have done better with this? From the cheesy ""romance"" lines they added in, to the poor acting (from some. Simon, Isabelle, and Alec were pretty much spot on), to changing SO MANY important details, and even so much as the potential they could have had with all the characters personalities, they just did a poor job in delivering the story in my opinion. I watched this movie with a friend of mine, she hasn't read the book, and she thought it was a decent movie.

Which is some times okay but for people who haven't heard of this you will be very confused. it doesn't' explain a lot, you have to know the books before you watch the movie. Other wise I liked movie and the actors and how well it was designed and the graphics. Dark and realistic with the creatures and environment.

5308351,1,B009AMAKWM,I don't know what movie the 5 star reviewers watched but it wasn't this. And anyone who says this was anything like the book must have read the Cliffs Notes version. The author should be happy a book she took time to imagine and write the way she pictured it in her head could so easily make her a bunch of money to let them hack it apart in Hollywood. She sold out hope she is happy with the money because she lost a fan with me. Won't read anything she writes again. I guess the days of writing books to express their ideas and for the enjoyment of the fans is over so long as Hollywood will pay them  a boat load of cash to change it to their version.,1386028800,2,654,3.9923664122137406
5308352,5,B009AMAKWM,"I am 55 years old and loved this series.  I thought the movie is a great protrail of the charcters in the movie.  There were some differences but all in all they captured the first book.  I can't wait to see the sequels movies because the books were great.  I even took my daughter to see the in the theater and then bought her the books and she is onto the end of book 4 ready to read book five.  Don't let us down do more advertiseing, more clips and sort of a build up on TV in the US.  I read the Hunger Games all the books and I was very dissapointed with the how the books turned out.  Your Movie and the these series are far better.  Producers are you listening to your fan base.  The books are flying off the shelves not only in the book stores but in other places and since the 6 book does not come out until May I read Clockwork Prince ( Internal  Devices) and that three part series.  I enjoyed all of those as well which led into this series.  Great job.  I also believe the movie to catch that is in the books is it l should be at least 2 and half hours.  More advertiesing for the rest of the series and see our stars on primetime new feeds.",1386028800,2,1155,3.965217391304348

5308415,5,B009AMAKWM,"Before I saw the movie in the theater, I was not happy with Jamie Campbell Bower as Jace. He is not what I pictured Jace to look like, just not good-looking at all. But he played his part well. I loved that they kept with his snarky attitude and smart remarks like he does in the book. Lots of action to keep you watching and you could feel the chemistry burning Jace and Clary. I could tell the actors had a thing for each other even before I knew they were dating in real life.

There were a few minor issues with the movie, like the fact that Simon starts showing signs of being a vampire at the end of the movie where I don't think he starts seeing signs until the 2nd book. When I was reading the books, I never pictured Magnus Bane as a young hot Asian guy. I pictured him as a 40-something white man, almost like an Elton John/Liberace mixture. And I didn't imagine Clary's mom haven't an accent.

I can't wait until the movies come out on DVD so I can buy it! I have read the Mortal Instruments books several times and I did not feel disappointed by the movie at all...Ready for the next one!",1385510400,2,1100,4.15962441314554
5308416,5,B009AMAKWM,"Really enjoyed this movie. The more you get into the movie, it might be easier in some scenes if you read the books so you really know what's happening so it doesn't hit you wrong, but not a must. Can't wait for the other movies to come out.",1385510400,,241,4.041666666666667
5308417,2,B009AMAKWM,"I'm shocked at how many supposed fans of the book loved this movie.  I thought it was terrible.  I thought the casting for Jace, Alec & Isabelle sucked.  The movie felt rushed at times and they deviated from the book a bit too much for my taste.  So pissed because now there's little chance they get to make the other movies because they fubar'd this one so bad.  It's a shame because these books were really good and deserved to be made into movies.  I wish I had 2 more hands so I could give this movie 4 thumbs down.",1385424000,,519,4.14
5308418,4,B009AMAKWM,The movie tries to represent several books in a short time if you have read them all except for heavenly fire it comes together but if not it will make no sense also clary isn't very nice to luke in this film but it is a visually pleasing film,1385424000,,243,3.979591836734694
5308419,5,B009AMAKWM,"I will start of by saying that I never read any of the Mortal books nor was aware of the movie production of it, actually of the series entirely. I only saw the Movie teaser /trailer on youtube early this year and thought I must see this when it comes out in August cause it looks awesome Well after about month after the release date I still haven't found time to go and see it on the big screen, however I was becoming aware of all the negative press talk and really negative stuff from fans of the series, which faze me not at all. I will take peoples opinion and views into consideration but I will always make my own judgement, so I had to see this movie that looked awesome but had such a negative tone attached to it.

Okay.take Constantine, Interview with the Vampire, & The Craft and fused it all together and you have The Mortal Instrument  City of Bones. I love the 90s gothic feel it had, it wasn't gruesomely dark yet dark enough to make it mysterious and seductive. I loved it!!! Loved the cast, loved the directing, love the special effects and loved the chemistry between the leading actors! I must admit I am now a fan, not a fanatic one, which is absolutely fine if you are one, annnnndIm sure I would be too if I was still in my teens, however Im a fan enough to start reading the books now.and I have just finished reading the City of Bone. Annnd I have to say I can now see why the fans were so disappointed and what they meant by the movie is totally different from the book. Well its true its different but only different in the sequence of events taking place that didn't happen in the order of the book, but everything else in the book that they could fit in was there in the Movie.

The back and forth between Jace and Clary in the books was hilarious to read. The chemistry between the two was strange, unpredictable, at times conflicting, but witty, strong yet underneath all thatsweet and loving. I guess Im a romantic LOL and it would have been great to see more of Jace and Clarys dialog seen in the movie because there is no denying the on screen chemistry there. There was also QUAILTY acting in this movie, which is why they all landed the part because although they may not all look like the characters or even resemble them (some), there was a defiant essence of the characters in all the actors that just showed on the screen.

So now when Im reading the books, and am glad I can put a clear face to all the characters, I might add a little height here and there or change the colours of their eyes but everything else is already paved for me (thanks to the movie adaptation).
The reason why the Movie wasn't a box office hit is 1) the marketing was really wrong, because the movie has a dark undertone that works will with older audience, which they forgot to consider to market because I wouldnt have known of the movie hadnt I stumble on by the movie trailer. 2) to keep the fans of the books they should have somehow or at least kept it in sequence to the books, you can still cut things out but keep the sequence because that was what they did with the Potter series, they cut out a lot but kept the sequence. 3) Im sure there is a third and maybe a fourth but thats was all I thought that was out of alignment. The movie was great and so was the book and if the supernatural fantasy world is your interest, be your own verdict and check it out! I did and loved the movie. Heythey movie got me reading the books. Cassandra Claire may have disappointed a lot of fan even lost some, shes simultaneously gaining a whole lot of new fans --- a little older though hehehehe look forward to the MOVIE sequeal!!!",1385337600,2,3646,4.264450867052023
5308420,3,B009AMAKWM,This movie had great potential but it appears that the writers tried to pull in bits and pieces of several books making the story seem choppy.  I also think by doing this it ruins the essences of the story and if you have read the entire series it will annoy you.  I purchased this for my digital library -- not one of my smarter moves.,1385337600,,336,4.153846153846154
5308421,3,B009AMAKWM,"Lets see is I can wrap this up. Buffy the Vampire Slayer meets Twilight Saga with a dash of Harry Potter and the teenie bopping overtone of Dawson's Creek.  Decent enough movie. It has most everything you'd want in a fantasy realm. Demons, Vamps, Wolves and some magic. Movie definitely had it's moments but, too short lived if you ask me.",1385337600,,339,4.557377049180328

5308464,1,B009AMAKWM,"The plot is nonsensical, the acting is awful, the movie is poorly written, the characters keep doing moronic things that no real people would actually do in any of these situations and from about 1/4th of the movie onwards, you're just cheering really hard for someone to kill the main chick and for the movie to end.

I's like an emotional porn written for 13 year old girls who spend all of their time listening to emo music and cutting themselves.",1385164800,6,450,4.555555555555555
5308465,5,B009AMAKWM,"This book series is absolutely one of my very favorites.  It's hard for me to decide between Twilight and The Mortal Instruments.  Honestly, I was a little concerned about some of the actor selections, but once I saw the movie, I ended up being happy.  There were a few differences between the book and the movie, but that isn't surprising.  I think it's unfair to expect that movies based on the book will be identical.  I felt like the changes that they made worked and I didn't have any problems with them.  I read alot and I really just think everyone needs to relax when they are adapting a book to a movie.  Being a long term fan of ""Gone With The Wind"", it's  incredible the amount of differences between the book and movie.  However you don't see that movie get the amount of critcism that newer book adaptations are getting.  Both are incredible!  My husband saw this movie with me.  He hasn't read any of the books, so I did have to fill him in on some of the background info.  Of course he had to complain a little, but he often does when I drag him to my YA Paranormal Romance movies.  I really hope they decide to continue adapting the rest of the books.  I'd hate to see it end here.",1385164800,2,1197,4.28125

5308467,3,B009AMAKWM,"I will admit I have no one to blame but myself for taking the plunge and purchasing this movie without checking out the story first. The trailer was corny but it seemed like an interesting ride. Oh, oh it is but not in the way I had hoped. Take every tired trope from Twilight, Vampire Diaries, and whatever else supernatural love story you can think of add tattoos, piercings and runes and voila, you have The Mortal Instruments. That being said the campy move, (do check out the garden sequence) moves along like a toddler with too much cold medicine and in the best way. It's hilarious in that ""this is a great drinking game"" kinda way.",1385078400,,639,4.47008547008547
5308468,5,B009AMAKWM,"I was young when City of Bones came out as a book. I went to see the movie because of Robbie Sheehan who plays Simon I am a fan of him and since he is Irish and not very big over here in America I wanted to support something he is in over here.
Anyways, the movie was very good I had to close my eyes because I wasn't used to so much violence and intensity.
I still enjoyed the movie, the acting was done very well except for Godfrey Gao who plays Magnus, when they got to seen with Magnus' party his acting sounded like he was reading off of cue cards.
Besides that the acting was done well, the CGI and affects were incredible; the same with; makeup, sets, props and costumes. Kevin Zegers and Jemima West (Alec and Isabelle Lightwood) did their British accents well since Kevin is Canadian and Jemima is French you never would've guessed they weren't British. The same with Robbie Sheehan you never would've guessed he wasn't American!
After I saw the movie I bought the book and found that the movie was incredibly close to the book, and I love the series I can't wait till the movie for City of Ashes comes out in 2015!",1385078400,2,1124,4.257009345794392

5308470,5,B009AMAKWM,"Wow, I really like this film. I've had to rewind thrice to fill context, literally thrice from the end and once from the middle of the film. This two hour and ten minute film lacks context and I've learned this is part of a massive vetted series of immaculate, very much admired books, 5 that are out now, 21 November 2013, a sixth book is released summer 2014 and there are 3 prequels. After I posted the movie's fully developed characters within the first 20 minutes of the film, I learned of this massive series of books as well as learned that many of my friends adore the series and own this film already. In my words, I'd say this film is brilliant and unique, though, the context of the sentences from the book may be required prior to watching the film and I imagine that reading the book prior to the movie is even more thrilling than just one or the other. Not having read the books, the context between the lines from the many characters are filled easily however with two hours and ten minutes, there is not one moment of lapses for any viewer. I've viewed quite a lot of films in this genre, which is a split-genre- in my opinion- having viewed so many super natural genre films, I can become, unbeknownst to me, a tad jaded in the midst of watching, knowing what the formula is and what the writers created when mixing formulas. This film is beyond a set formula, said to be based upon short books that are quick reads and most lines in the film are word-for-word from the respective book. This is not a youth-targeted film (series), this is not a targeted film (series), this just IS. I am reminded of pre-television writing- not Hemingway though not Warner Bros greed-driven hit-maker. What a beautiful and fulfilling thoughtful film. I'll watch this film several times before I feel as though I truly know ""The Mortal Instruments (City of Bones).""

5308471,5,B009AMAKWM,"Excellent movie. Books are good too. I had my doubts about how the movie would fair against the books, but they did a fairly good job translating the novel into a script for the screen.
It is always a tough thing for a novel to be turned into a movie script, as the novel will have lots of little elements in the story's plot that will get lots when the script is written for the movie, and some things that are in the book may not translate well on the big screen.
They did a fairly good job with this one. And while I have read the Mortal Instruments series, I am not one of the die hard fans that will comment on everything that is missing from the movie that was in the book. Basically, I personally, enjoyed the movie.",1384992000,,723,4.134751773049645

I wish those hours had just vanished from existence but instead I have a memory of a movie filled with horrible acting, crappy special effects and a even worse story line.  You might ask why I would subject myself to this cruel and unusual punishment and I am ashamed of my answer but the truth is I made a promise to my girl I would see it with her.  I'm trying to figure out a way to repay the love of my life for dragging me to this film.  It's hard to imagine anything worse, I thought about water-boarding but honestly that would be a walk in the park in comparison.

Surprisingly, this movie delivered and I really enjoyed it. Now, if you're a critic who thinks that a movie has to follow the book as closely as possible--then you'd probably be annoyed at minor differences throughout the plot line and a very different ending.

However, looking beyond a book comparison, this movie alone is awesome. The movie itself is very action packed and I thought the producers did a great job of providing enough history and background information for the audience to understand the world that Cassandra Clare aimed to create. Also, the actors have really great chemistry. I really hope they move forward and film City of Ashes!",1384041600,3,781,4.659420289855072

One thing that was disappointing with the movie was that I felt like they jam packed a lot of information into it. I do understand the need to do this, but as usual when you've read a book the movie just  doesn't portray it how you've imagined it in your mind. I think the casting was very good and the scenery was beautiful.
If I hadn't read the book the movie would have still rocked and in fact, my husband (who doesn't read) loved the movie.

I also love the choice of actors to act out their respective character in the movie. The movie incorporated a lot of different genres that we all love, but I for one loved the romance the best. Robert Sheehan's (Simon Lewis) comical timing was on point. In addition, his character indulged in a love triangle between Jace and Clary making it more intriguing. The movie had quite a few genres such as Adventure, Drama, Fantasy, Thriller, Horror, Action and Romance and all were used in a right timely fashion.",1383091200,3,626,4.63963963963964

I can't wait for it to be released and dearly hope they don't put the second one on hold for too long.  It stayed true the books with a few artistic licenses taken.  Those helped to tell the story in a condensed version so the movie would not have been 4 hours long (not that I would have minded it that long).

I was disappointed that the plan to produce a movie based on the second book was cancelled.

The only complaint I have, is I recently read the books about 2 weeks before seeing this movie... And as far as keeping it close to the content of the novel... They only got about three things right. Two vastly different things, so diehard fans of the book who are expecting a perfect cinematic recreation... You will be sorely disappointing.

5308583,5,B009AMAKWM,"Before I sat down in theaters to see the film, I was nervous they were going to butcher it--like so many book-to-movie adaptations nowadays.  THANKFULLY, I was pleasantly surprised!  I am very critical of adaptations since I write creatively myself...the scriptwriter and director really brought the author's world to life--not their version of her ideas.  It is very easy to see they consulted her on big and small details.

I found that each of the actors were brilliant in their roles.  Each of them morphed into the book characters I love so well.  Lilly Collins was such a strong Clary.  The character's bravery shined through it all.  She is also believable as a young girl whose whole world has collapsed--She did not overact her shock or pain, it did not dominate her performance, and her rawness was refreshing.  Lilly displayed that Clary was not a weak heroine, and she was not going to sit back and break (unlike in another teen series)

I have heard grumblings online that many do not like Jamie, but I think it was PERFECT casting; he became Jace!  I had hoped he could manage it, and he did not disappoint me.  His acting had depth and portrayed Jace's multi-layered personality.  The scenes where he was vulnerable with Clary really impressed me--it is far more challenging to act deep emotion than stoic strength. That British dry-humor benefitted his perfectly-delivered one-liners.

I was so happy that they put so much into the film; it showed how much the team respected it.  With certain sets, like the library, my mouth dropped open in the theater--the special effects were amazing!

On a final note: the ending is a different than the book--Now before you go away in disgust--I think it really benefitted the film.  It helped nonreaders to have more understanding, AND it opened a door for some greater tension in the next films.  I NEVER EVER condone big changes, but this one made sense to me.

I really have nothing negative to report and I hope those book-fans who were wary to see it will give it a chance.",1381536000,6,2035,4.746438746438747

5308586,1,B009AMAKWM,"I am obsessed with The Mortal Instruments series. I've read the books, especially the first one, multiple times. That being said. This movie is terrible. There is not one thing right about it. I am used to the normal stray of a book being turned to film, and believe me, I took that into consideration. Yet, this movie was nothing but disappointing. Most of the movie was so altered from the books that I couldn't even recognize the scene. I don't want to go into too many details, because I don't want to give away spoilers, but the moral of this review is....the movie is not even worth watching. It took me three attempts to even get through it, and I had to force myself to continue watching.

I assume the movie may be able to be seen as decent if you have not read the books, but if you are a fan of the books...and I mean a real fan, not someone who sped read before watching the movies...well, don't bother. I have a knack for details, and I know how to live with details being wrong. But this WHOLE MOVIE WAS WRONG. Not even a close to the book from the casting, to the story line, to the personalities of the characters. Important things that happen in book one were drastically altered or emitted, leaving me to wonder how the heck they will manage to make the 2nd movie.

5308591,2,B009AMAKWM,"I went to see this expecting the worst, but frankly had quite an enjoyable time.  I really love magical stories, and while I agree with some viewers that it was extremely derivative of both recent and older sword and sorcery books and films, I don't think there is much original to be said about underground communities of magical beings, youthful or not.

The script was decent if not inspiring, and the youthful cast reasonably attractive and sincere. The fact that Aidan Turner, barely 30 years old, and with a streak of white deliberately added to his curly dark hair, functioned as a senior member of the cast, gives you some idea of how youth-oriented the film is (and, therefore, I suppose the books, which I have not read, as well).

With the exception of blond young Jace, played by Jamie Campbell Bower, who has a faint aura of Mick Jagger-like charisma and a delicious voice, the seniors (Turner and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, of ""The Tudors"" fame) rather outclassed the youngsters in terms of screen charisma. Lily Collins did well enough as Clary, but she lacks the kind of force that will take her past the bloom of youth. And Luke Garroway's part seemed to me to be oddly truncated - as I haven't read the books, I'm not sure of this, but that's the way it seemed.  My advice to Turner, by the way, who really can act given half a chance (take a look at him in the very adult drama, ""Hattie"" and in ""Desperate Romantics""), is to end the involvement with fantasy films (he's done a vampire, a werewolf, and a dwarf at this point) and regroup and try to find some challenging adult roles before he starts losing his hair, his looks, and his chances to transition back to serious acting.

The magical effects were fine. On balance, in fact, MI:COB was much better than ""Man of Steel"", during which I nearly screamed with boredom at the inane script and endless explosions. It's not quite up to the quality of Harry Potter, let alone Lord of the Rings, its naked longings in those directions show too much to get quite to those levels, but it was nevertheless enjoyable on its own.

Turner, by the way (SPOILER ALERT!), has the best line in the film: while driving off in a truck with Clary to rescue her mother and Jace from the clutches of Valentine Morgenstern, Clary, who now knows Luke is a werewolf, tells him to feel free to hang his head out the window. ""I'm a werewolf,"" he snaps, ""not a golden retriever!""

And that's as good as the script gets.  I've heard worse.",1380240000,4,2480,4.544843049327354

5308603,5,B009AMAKWM,"""What?! She did not just say that!"" I know book fans of The Mortal Instruments will want to deliver a thumbs down from the moment they read the title... But please, hear me out. (: I own and have read the entire series, that has thus far, been released. I definitely did not love the first book but it was enjoyable enough. I read the others only because they were given to me as a gift. Then I felt like they went downhill from there. The author started out okay, but it quickly began to feel like 'a money maker' to me. Forcing stories, characters not staying dead, dragging out pointless plots... Anyway, as for the movie... I almost always prefer the book over the movie, as I think most readers do. But because I felt, ""meh"" about the book, the movie won out this time around.

It did feel darker and scarier than the book, and maybe that is my own imagination of the feared to blame. They kept with the book for the most part, but did change several details that made me cock my head to the side. (i.e. the creature in the apartment, the final showdown location, clary seeing that mark in the beginning and writing it all over her room, Simon getting bit was in a later book etc.) The actors did a great job. Jace wasn't as attractive in my opinion as he was written in the book. BUT, he did grow on me. Lily Collins was gorgeous and awesome as Clary. It was suspenseful and action packed almost the entire time. There was only a sprinkle of romance, so don't expect a bunch of make-out scenes and sappy love stories. I sigh regrettably, as my brother would cheer. It had laugh-out-loud-in-the-theatre moments. (Even some that weren't meant to be funny. Ahem. Cough. Portal Scene.) If you have seen it, you know what I'm talking about. Nerdy Simon was perfect and a great comedy relief amongst a series of serious events. Me and my group were all pleasantly surprised at how much we enjoyed this movie. You may not love it, but whether you have read the book or not, it is definitely a good watch for any of you mundanes. ;)

5308610,4,B009AMAKWM,"I went with my daughter and son. They kindly took me for my birthday, which happened to fall on the day this was released (hmmm...) I have never read the books.

The good: Whomever edited this movie was mostly brilliant. I saw scenes that were cut just right...and I could tell even a second more would have made the scene really bad.
I know some people didn't like the music, but I thought it was done fairly well. I could tell which emotion they were trying to evoke in the audience with each piece, so they did something right.
It might be a chick flick, but it had enough action to keep a guy from falling asleep.
Chemistry between the lead actors. The characters of Simon, Clary and Jace worked very well together.
Some very good camera work, if you looked for it.
The story was a little choppy, but I could follow without having read the books. I had no idea who some of the character names were in the beginning, but they all got named eventually. There's something to be said for not going for instant knowledge of everything in a movie.
Sets-most were perfect for the given scene, with nice attention to detail. Loved the crypts in the City of Bones.
I enjoyed the story as it unfolded. Having no prior knowledge, it had a few hiccups in flow, but there was an actual plot (or plots, as the case may be)

The bad:
Godfrey Gao-not only was he given the worst lines and costumes ever, his delivery was nothing short of abysmally wooden.
Special Effects- Very uneven. It looked like they ran out of time and money. Places where there should have been SOMEthing (like when Magnus is healing Alec) were left looking cheesy. Other places the effects were perfect.
Uneven acting-I'll bet I could tell you which scenes were shot first....
Some lines were delivered so quickly or quietly that I missed them the first time (yes,I went back)
Werewolves-Again, it looked like they ran out of budget to do them right.

I came expecting the standard brains-bleeding-out-of-your-ears-by-the-end-of-the-movie badly written teen flick (Twilight comes to mind...) and left liking the movie quite a bit. The kids didn't find it so horrendously off (think the ""golden cornucopia-not"" of the Hunger Games movie) that they hated it, and I was surprised that most of the movie was as good as it was. I even went back one day during a bargain hour to look at some of the editing and effects again. While it felt like it was released before it was quite done, I enjoyed it very much, and will not only buy it for the kids when it comes out, I'll probably watch it again.",1379203200,11,2554,4.547826086956522
5308611,5,B009AMAKWM,"Overall, I really enjoyed this movie.

The casting was perfect.  The actors really embodied their character-counterparts and brought them to life.  Jace was just as overconfident and funny in the books, and Simon was SPOT-ON! He looked and acted exactly how I pictured him in my head.  I will admit, I was sort of disappointed in Magnus - I was expecting more sparkle, but I suppose he did OK.

I really appreciated that the storyline and plot was swift without feeling rushed.  Anyone who hasn't read the books would have an easy time following the story.  They didn't go as in-depth on the shadowhunter history, but they touched on all the highlights that were important to the story for everyone to understand even if they didn't read the books.

I like that they sometimes went ""off script"" from the book sometimes.  For example, I liked the way they flipped the sequence of the poetry reading and the club.  It somehow made more sense to me that way.  I thought it was hilarious when Simon met Jace and he asked if he was the gatekeeper and alluded to the keymaster (from the original Ghostbusters movie).  I felt that it gave the movie a funny & ironic twist.

Another thing I liked about going off-book-script was the whole ""rat scene"" that was omitted from the movie that was in the book.  I realize the importance of that part in the book, but I think the CGI execution of that would have been ridiculous, so I'm glad they didn't go through with it.

There were a few things that weren't my favorite:
* I didn't like that they gave away some information in this first movie that didn't come out until later books (2 & 3).  I suppose it isn't a HUGE deal, but when I was reading the books I remember thinking ""OMG ! THAT'S what's wrong with Clary's mom!!!"" or finding out what Valentine really did to Clary & Jace before they were born. Minor details, but they irked me nonetheless.

* Magnus was kind of boring.  When he was talking to Clary at the party, I felt like he was reading the book to me.

Despite that, I REALLY enjoyed the movie - even with the ""twist"" ending. I've heard that the City of Ashes movie has been shelved ""indefinitely"" because this movie hasn't been a blow-away box office hit, but I really hope they pursue filming City of Ashes.  They did a fantastic job on City of Bones and I would definitely see City of Ashes if they filmed it.",1378944000,14,2368,4.450116009280743
5308612,5,B009AMAKWM,"I've seen this movie seven times. Yes, actually seven. I'm a huuuuge fan of the book and quite frankly with all these new book-to-movie adaptations I was horrified. The actors, I was indifferent about. Because nobody can live up to everyone's overzealous fantasies of how the character should work. I'll be honest, couldn't stand Jamie Campbell Bower at first when he was featured as Jace. He just didn't fit the part. But after the second, third and fourth time (with a little bit of YouTube viewing) His personality is extremely similar to Jace. Mainly this movie got attacked because of the 'low budget actors'. It was the first one, wasn't a make or break, they're not going to cancel out actors just because they're not top of the line popular. Plus, what really kills me is everyone's obsessive ability to compare this to twilight. Stop. Just stop. This isn't Twilight. It's not written by Stephenie Meyer. It's not about a shitty love story with a petty vampire and a girl stupider than a bag of rocks. Whatever. This is City of Bones, Mortal Instruments Saga written by Cassandra Clare. Please get it right. The acting, and the book portrayal was awesome, sure they tweaked a few things but if you follow the book word by word, (not to mention you only have 2 hours to speed things though) What they tweaked in the movie lead to a nice twist. I enjoyed it, first time I just kept comparing. Oh they did this instead of this, that instead of that. No. Not one book-to-movie adaptation is completely and utterly perfect. That's sincerely kills the excitement and the individualism of the movie.

Definitely saw how horrible this poor movie got on Rotten Tomatoes, and really. It's simply because a bunch of YA novels are becoming movies, and therefore they're being super critical over small things. It's quite sad. I'm sincerely looking forward to the Blue-ray version of this movie, as well as the soundtrack, and if you haven't checked out the soundtrack it's highly recommended! It fits well with the movies, the songs made/chosen are extremely accurate to the storyline of Clace. :) Sure, there's some cliche and overused moments in the movie. But no movie is perfect. Nothing will ever fit the perfectionist standard that people have immediately as the book comes out.

5308647,4,B009AMAKWM,"I am not the biggest fan of The Mortal Instruments book series.  I think I read the fourth book, but I wouldn't swear to it in a court of law.  I kept up with the books that long because they were decent cheesy fun, but it felt like they were starting to cannibalize themselves.  (I do think Cassandra Clare's Infernal Devices trilogy is more original and interesting.)

However, Jeanette Catsoulis' review for The New York Times made the movie The Mortal Instruments: The City of Bones sound like a ridiculous, but fun time.  Thus, after a too long day at the office (5:40 is just wrong on a Friday), I headed to the theater.  (Okay, I headed to somewhere to eat, and then I shopped at Target, and then I went to the 8:15 showing.)

The cast does a good job.  Lily Collins made a negative impression on me in Mirror, Mirror (a film I couldn't like despite my best intentions), but here she's got a nice bit of attitude and determination to carry her through Clary's bewilderment.  Jamie Campbell Bower looks wonderful in motion, and gives Jace a nice bit of vulnerability to temper his cockiness.  The adults are all fine, as long as you don't mind Jonathan Rhys Meyers chewing the scenery in a manner that will almost make you forget that his character's actions make no sense.  As Valentine, he's also strangely sexual with Jace and Clary, given that he's trying to convince him that he's their father.  The weakest acting link is probably Kevin Zegers, but then again,  he's saddled with the thankless storyline of over-the-top jealousy and cattiness.

And okay, I'd probably bump the movie up any mental grade because it has CCH Pounder in it, and I've loved her since I first saw Baghdad Cafe.  She's in fine form here as an agoraphobic witch, a small but crucial role.

""Small but crucial"" defines most of what happens in TMI: COB.  There's a lot being thrown at the audience, and I suspect much of it doesn't make much sense unless you've read the book.  There are a bunch of characters, a bunch of creatures, and a couple of goals (the cup and Clary's mom).  I doubt many moviegoers will be satisfied by the resolution, which shows absolutely no one worried about Jocelyn, still in a coma.

It's a better movie than I expected, for fans of the book.  If you liked the story, I'd go ahead and see it.  (Or rent it once it's out on video.)  But I doubt it will appeal much to other audiences, because it's overstuffed and too derivative.  Also, there was no place to mention this earlier, but the now frequently mocked pop-song-playing-over-makeout-in-the-greenhouse scene deserves to be mocked.  It's too cheesy even for TMI: COB.

General movie note:  Recent parents, I know you still have lives and want to get out of the house.  But if you're going out with your baby, a late-night Friday showing of a PG-13 movie on the weekend it's released is not the place to do it.",1378252800,,2880,4.572265625
5308648,3,B009AMAKWM,"The Mortal Instruments: City Of Bones was one of my most anticipated movies this year; I have been a fan of the book series for years and I was dying to see how this movie translated to the big screen. I wasn't exactly pleased with the casting originally, but the cast definitely grew on me. Considering I had such high expectations for this movie, it definitely was extremely disappointing, but it wasn't as terrible as some are saying.

  City Of Bones is one of the few book-to-movie adaptations that are mostly true to it's source material. For the most part, much of the movie is lifted straight from the book, but that didn't work too well for this movie. Harald Zwart decided to include most of the action scenes from the book which is fine, as long as you include vital segments.

  The action scenes are well choreographed, excellently executed, and are extremely thrilling. I definitely think the action scenes are one of the highlights of the movie and I absolutely loved them. The action scenes felt very real and they really captured these intense moments from the books well. The problem is that Zwart sacrifices valuable screen time to devote to the mechanics of Cassandra Clare's world. The Clave, Parabatis, steles, and so many significant items from the books aren't explained or if they are it's a casual mention. How would viewers unfamiliar with the books know what The Accords are? The Accords are mentioned, yet no one bothers to explain this to the average, unknowing viewer. This movie really wasn't made for those who aren't part of The Mortal Instruments fandom because it does a poor job of introducing viewers to Shadowhunters.

  I was a bit afraid that City Of Bones would be too heavy on cheesy, CGI effects, but that is not the case. The special effects are well done and are a visual treat to viewers for most of the movie. I was pretty impressed with the visuals in the movie and they were a nice surprise.

  City Of Bones has a poorly written script and so many of the movie's faults stem from there. Much of the dialogue is weak, implausible, and just ridiculous much to my surprise. Cassandra Clare writes some of the best dialogue in her books and I was disappointed how many lines they had used from the text. The screenwriters used only a few notable lines from the book even though there was so many opportunities for more usage. Much of the dialogue came across as awkward and just didn't feel conversational AT ALL. The lack of proper dialogue lead to feeble character dialogue and left something to be desired.

  I'm going to break down the acting by actor because the acting was very uneven.

Lily Collins as Clary: Lily portrayed Clary better than I thought she would, her performance was definitely the most notable in the movie. Lily was the perfect person for the part of Clary and she definitely gave it her all.

Jamie Campbell Bower as Jace: As soon as Jamie was cast as Jace, I was extremely skeptical and nervous how his performance as Jace. Jamie does a mediocre job of portraying Jace because he lacks the snarky attitude that is essentially a huge part of Jace. Jamie didn't capture the tortured, conflicted feelings that Jace is filled with throughout City Of Bones. Jamie always looked mopey throughout the movie but Jace smiles and laugh so much in City Of Bones. This isn't to say that Jamie is a poor actor, he's a great actor, but I'm not sure if he was cut out for this role.

Godfrey Gao as Magnus: I just can't even. Godfrey had maybe 2 minutes of on-screen time when Magnus is a huge part of City Of Bones. I really can't comment on Godfrey as an actor, because the filmmakers didn't give him much to experiment with besides a few flimsy lines. In City Of Ashes, I want more flamboyance, humor, and more light-heartedness from Gao.

Robert Sheehan as Simon: Robert wasn't exactly how I pictured Simon to be, I imagined Simon to be more geeky when I first read CoB. I know each reader has their own vision of each character so I can't fault Sheehan on this. Sheehan played the part well and all of his reactions seemed extremely genuine.

  I can't really comment on Kevin Zeger's and Jemima West's performances justfully because I feel like I didn't see enough of either of them in the movie to give a proper jurisdiction.

  The romance in City Of Bones didn't do the book justice at all. I adored Jace and Clary's relationship in the books, but I felt like the movie distorted their relationship beyond reason. There was little development in their relationship and it all felt too much like insta-love to me. The worst of the romance occurs in the Greenhouse scene which was all too much for me. The Greenhouse scene felt incredibly awkward to me and pretty unromantic, this scene was hard to watch for me. Why did they have it rain while they kissed? To make things even worse, the Demi Lovato song that they blasted when Clary and Jace kissed was so unfitting and made me want to cringe. I really don't think the filmmakers could have made this scene even more awkward or cliche for viewers.

  I was worried how the filmmakers would handle Valentine and the scene in his lair. I get that the filmmakers were on a budget, but I really don't think staging this scene beneath The Institute really worked too well. The battle scene didn't work too well there and I really think it would have worked better in Renwick's. Another addition I don't understand is the addition of Valentine's henchmen because they really didn't add much to the movie.

  I have one last and final complaint about the film, but it was an overwhelming issue for me. I wouldn't exactly call City Of Bones as so many critics have, but City Of Bones definitely borrows a bit from these franchises. I really don't understand why the filmmakers had to borrow aspects from these franchises. City Of Bones is a novel with so much excellent material and borrowing from other franchises was completely unnecessary and just made City Of Bones look like a Harry Potter/Twilight copycat. Sure they only adopted a few things into the movie, but it irked me to no end. City Of Bones is NOT Harry Potter, it's not Twilight, and it's most certainly not The Hunger Games. The filmmakers didn't understand that City Of Bones is it's own novel and doesn't need to feel like other popular YA franchises.

  There are just so many things that bothered me about The Mortal Instruments: City Of Bones, I could probably ramble on and on about this all day. The bottom line is that The Mortal Instruments isn't a bad movie, but it suffers from a weak script and other poor choices on the filmmakers' parts. While I won't be dying to see City Of Ashes in theaters, I'll definitely see it just for curiosity's sake. This book adaptation isn't the most impressive adaptation, but it's not the worst either. City Of Bones wasn't exactly the movie I expected, but for the most part, I enjoyed it.",1378166400,,6914,4.607986960065199

The actors are all very good especially the young lady who plays Clary and the young man who plays Jace.  I haven't read the books but I definitely want to after seeing this movie.

After seeing the critical views and remembering groaning while watching the Riordan books get decimated by Hollywood, I was determined not to see this movie.  But after coming across these reviews on Amazon by other fans of the series, I decided to see it and was very pleasantly surprised.  This may be one of those movies where you actually have to read the book first to fully appreciate it.  Having said that I can understand the reviews from ""critics"" who are too lazy to actually read a book.  If you are a fan of the book series you will not be completely happy with anyones adaptation, but in this case I think they did an very good job of balancing the true to the book aspect along with the Hollywood ""tweaking"" to the formulaic teen action film.  After seeing Riordans 9 foot tall nasty looking Cyclops Tyson reduced to a typical California surfer dude, I give the producers a lot of credit for developing the movie with the book fans in mind probably knowing it would be thrashed in reviews by the movie critics.",1378080000,5,1080,4.512820512820513
5308652,3,B009AMAKWM,"This film is for those who grew up missing Buffy, Twilight, and Star Wars. For you older guys out there, make sure you take a bag with you as I discovered my theater doesn't take kindly to hurling chunks. Like Twilight, the film is designed for the female tween audience. Clary (Lily Collins) rhymes with Carrie (Fisher) and reminds us of clairvoyance, is the main teen character. She can see things her friend Simon (Robert Sheehan) can not, especially that symbol that looks like the head of a deranged bunny.

One day Clary comes home to find mom (Lena Headey) left a mess and a demonic attack dog. Her life now consists of hanging out with a goth half angelic being (Jamie Campbell Bower), trying to find out who she is, rediscovering her powers, killing the beings Kristen Stewart would rather procreate with, and something about a cup. There is no Bella in this film, just an Isabelle. Could we please get off the Bella Donna word play.

The film is a culmination of pop culture designed to appeal to young female fans. All others beware of nausea. Keep an eye on Clary's hair part as it magically changes aka Deb in ""Napoleon Dynamite.""

On a side note: Both Lily Collins (Mirror, Mirror) and Kristen Stewart (Snow White and the Huntsman) both played the role of Snow White. Lily was clearly the superior actress by being able to read a line and use facial expressions.

5308684,1,B009AMAKWM,"I love Cassandra Clare. I buy every book she writes as soon as it's available. Her stories are beautiful and captivating and intriguing.

This movie was none of those things.

The actors were all over the place. Some overacted every scene, showing way more emotion than the lines called for. It felt like an over-reaching high school production. There were no subtleties at all. It all felt forced. The lines that I loved in the book were delivered at the wrong timing or the wrong tone. (I realize I am extremely picky with this, but it's important.) The actors who weren't over doing every scene were just so awful, my husband and I were scoffing and rolling our eyes at everything they said. Case in point: Magnus Bane, who is the most charismatic and beautiful character in all the books, delivered every single word in monotone. Every. Single. Word. It was sad.

The music was horrendous. It sounded as if they took it all from a play book on ""How to make a Dramatic Soundtrack."" only it was in all the wrong places. It sounded forced as well. It was distracting to the scenes.

The direction was laughable. Actor walks in, takes two steps around characters so that he's facing the screen. Who walks into a room and walks around people to talk to them? No one. The camera work should have made up for that. They could have taken some points from The Hunger Games, which did most of their camera work and direction in a way that it felt natural and real.

The dialogue and plot were rushed and put into contexts that made no sense. I do appreciate that they used lines straight from the book, but the way that they were used seemed awkward and wrong, and I know I'm using this word a lot, but also very forced. Example: Simon tells Clary he had hoped that when he tells a girl he loves him, she would say it back - while they're right outside of the hospital room where her mother lies in a coma. If I hadn't read the books, I'd be wondering why this Simon putz was so worried about his own feelings while the girl he loved was fretting over her mother's health. Another example: Simon, Jace, and Clary are in Clary's demolished apartment. No one knows where Clary's mother is. Simon starts digging on Jace. Jace comes back with a funny quip. It's in the book, yes, but not at a pivotal time when Clary is losing her mind over her mother's welfare! There are reasons that lines need to be delivered at certain times: they need to be believable! It felt like the screen writers were just shoving quotes in where they could. It wasn't natural. The way that the Shadowhunters' history and details were explained sounded trite and stupid.

The storyline was rushed and jumbled. We didn't get a chance to get a feel for the characters before total chaos took over and then we still didn't really get to know them throughout the movie. (I'm going to not make judgements on the actors apperances and whether they fit their rolls or not. Everyone has their own image of what Jace and Clary and Simon and all the others look like.)

I understand that a movie adapted from a book is challenging. Some movies get it right (Stand By Me, Hunger Games, the later Twilight movies) and some just completely fumble the ball. For me, this was an absolute miss. They completely left out the heart of the book in this adaptation. I feel badly for Cassandra Clare, and I will not be viewing any subsequent movies, but I will continue to read her books.

The only good points for me: The demon dog (even though it wasn't like the book's demon, it was pretty creepy and made me jump), Isabelle's whip, Luke and the actor who played Luke (I take back what I said about over acting. I think he did the best job of all of them), the believably of the apartment size, and the woman who played Clary's mother.",1377993600,12,3785,4.451659451659451
5308685,3,B009AMAKWM,"First, I'd like to reveal that I have not read the novel this book was loosely based on. When I watch a movie, I just want it to be entertaining. I don't care if its adaptation is faithful or not.

Second, below is what I think about it.

- The love story has an interesting twist. That makes it distinguishing from other movies of the same genre. Even at the end of this film, this twist is still not resolved. It entices the audience to wait for the sequels. I'm sorry, I can't tell you exactly what it is. Otherwise, it will ruin your enjoyment.

- The actress is attractive.

- The special effects are scary and gripping in some scenes but they are disappointing in others. For example, the scene, where in her house, the dog turned into something terrifying and suspensefully chasing her down. In other scenes, they look less interesting than the ones in other films.

- The acting is acceptable. It's not as engaging as I expect but it's not bad either.

5308686,3,B009AMAKWM,"I guess you have to read the book before you see this movie to be able to follow it. Since I have not read the books, it left me confused in a lot of things. I kept hearing so many bad reviews about this movie, so I wanted to go see it to give it some support because I really wanted to give this movie a fighting chance. I know fully understand what all the critics have been talking about. It feels like the movie was rushed and it feels like a lot of important factors from the book must have been left out to crunch for time. And the surprise twist was just that....... a surprise twist, because it didn't have anything to help lead up to the surprise twist. It seemed like they just said....""hey, let's just throw that in for the fun of it.""
There were many times when the acting was not on point, but for the most part it was descent enough. I feel that they should concentrate more on the story line for the second one that they are suppose to be filming, instead of worrying about all the action scenes. From what I have heard, it is a good book, so I am going to go to the library and check it out so that I an give the second film a fighting chance, that is if they are still going to make it.",1377820800,,1203,3.995850622406639

5308688,1,B009AMAKWM,"I went into this not expecting much. And on that front it definitely delivered. This movie definitely could have done more to draw in a crowd who hadn't previously read the books and knew nothing about it. Characters were left unintroduced, expecting everyone who goes to see the movie to know who each of these characters are and what their part in the story is. The film tried to include too much too soon and came off feeling overly chaotic. A mishmash of other YA lit plots. And, unfortunately, it isn't a mishmash that works. It definitely felt like it was missing something, knew it, and couldn't find it.

  On top of the mishmash of plot lines (ie ""The Chosen One"", ""Love Triangle!"", ""Ordinary person finding out they have powers!"", etc.), it also manages to be everything we've seen before. There is nothing distinct in this series. There is nothing that could be considered a draw in the movie because of that. It was ridiculously easy to compare things to other, more popular franchises. Finding out about Cassandra Clare's plagiarism after the fact made it easier to both see why that was and why I really regretted spending the money on something I initially thought was unnecessarily lauded by film critics.

  This movie could have been better if they didn't treat everyone that would be forced/go into seeing it as prior fans. The way this movie was written makes up come off as a chaotic, jumbled mess that tries to hard to be believable and fails disastrously.",1377561600,9,1478,4.7315175097276265
5308689,4,B009AMAKWM,"I am a huge fan of the books and couldn't wait to see this movie when I saw the trailer for the first time. I got nervous when I saw that the movie was getting pretty terrible reviews by critics but to be honest, there are plenty of times when I completely disagree with the critics. So I decided to go ahead and pay $10.00 to see the action on the big screen anyway. That being said, I can say that I enjoyed the movie a great deal. I'm a realist and knew going in that very few movie adaptations live up to a well liked book. I was very happy with this film for the most part but did feel that there were some lost opportunities with the main character development. Nothing like the hopelessness that I felt after watching ""The Host"" on screen. I absolutely loved the book (""The Host"") but the movie was so flat and well, grueling really, that I feel ""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones"" practically triumphed in comparison.  There are some great actors who put in solid performances (I've been a huge fan of Jonathan Rhys Meyers since ""The Tudors"") and I thought that the casting director did a good job finding actors who'd portray the characters well. There was also good chemistry between Jace (played by Jamie Campbell Bower) and Clary (played by Lily Collins) and although there was the usual YA schmaltzy lines (comparable to the Twilight ""You're my whole reason for existing"" type one liners) I think they did well. So much so that I went ahead and pre-ordered the DVD/Blu-ray discs. I certainly hope that there are more movies in this series in the pipeline as the books certainly warrant films of their own. I can say that I will be one of the first people in line. On a side note: My 13 year old son went with me and now wants to read the books because he liked the movie so much and he's not a reader by any means.

I loved Robert Sheehan as Simon as well. All the actors were so great in the film that I can't get over this movie, it is perfection to me as a fan of the series.

5308691,3,B009AMAKWM,"So if you haven't heard, there's been some buzz about The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones... and most of it's not good. As is usually the case with popular YA series-gone-to-film, I'm guessing much of this comes from the series' die-hard fan base. Since I was less than impressed with the book (my review), I'm going to try and take a more objective look at the movie. I walked in to The Mortal Instruments with the hope that it would blow the book out of the water. I mean, c'mon, did you see that trailer?! It looked SO good! And while I did enjoy the film overall, it didn't wow me as much as I thought it would.

There were definitely deviations from the book, as can be expected, but for the most part, I liked what they did with it. Sure, they cut out a lot of background history on the Shadowhunters and their world, but can you really blame them there? It's a movie and most moviegoers want to see some action. So yeah, they skipped a bunch of mythology to get to all the kick-ass parts and I'm cool with that. It's an easy movie to follow for those who aren't so familiar with the series, but I can see where it would be a more difficult adjustment for loyal fans of the books. For me, the changes didn't really matter so much because they worked. I think the biggest change was where the end battle took place and I do question how they'll make that fit in future movies (if there are any).

What I did appreciate were the subtle nuances to things in the book that were otherwise omitted. Where I think it lacked was in the fact that it was missing much of the mysterious darkness that the book had. It felt too rushed and we weren't able to get that real, gritty NYC feeling. I also really wanted more from that whole vampire/werewolf fight scene. It was one of my favourite parts of the book. I was also a bummed about how they handled that WTF revelation at the end --- it felt like they sugar-coated it so that it lost a lot of its WTF-ness. Not cool because that's what really made the book stand out.

As far as the casting goes, I thought most of the main characters (Clary, Simon, Jace, Hodge & Clary's mum) were spot on. First off, I LOOOOOVED Simon. He was a total natural --- relatable and cute and dorky and friendly. Lilly Collins was beautiful and brought a lot of depth to Clary. Jace didn't look quite like I pictured but he played the serious yet snarky role quite well. Jamie Campbell Bower looks like more of a heroine-chic version of the Jace that's in my head. It's nice to finally see Lena Headey not be a total b*tch and Jared Harris always keeps it classy. I thought Magnus looked the part but the acting was SO forced. It was just bad. I'm a give or take on Valentine and Luke. They weren't what I imagined but they were do-able. The biggest casting issue I had was with Alec and Isabelle. For the two most beautiful characters (in the book), I thought Clary and Simon outshined them both. And maybe I'm just being picky here, but aren't they supposed to look 17 not 30?

Overall, I'd say the movie was pleasing. The action was terrific, the romance believable (probably because Collins and Bowen dated in real life) and most of the casting was great, but I do think they can do one better if there's a sequel. The movie had a few cheesy moments (greenhouse sappy scene, I'm looking at you!), some intense drama, offered up some laughs and provided some legitimately creepy moments. Don't get me wrong, I can see why fans were displeased but if you hadn't read the books, I think the movie is a good alternative.  My recommendation if you are a fan is to not take the movie too seriously, otherwise you'll probably feel the bitter taste of disappointment.

Food for Thought: The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones has gotten a lot of flack for not living up to the book but I kind of liked the movie. The casting was fairly well-done, with a few exceptions, and the plot was action-tastic! In terms of book-to-film adaptations, this one was pretty close to the original source material in both plot and feel. I did spend a lot of time trying to remember specifics from the book, though, so I feel like I may have missed out on some things. I'll probably go again, not for comparisons sake this time, but to enjoy the film for, well, being the film.",1377561600,32,4284,4.362155388471178

There will always be someone who has a different idea of what a character looks or acts like, what a set should be be, etc. The good thing about this movie is that even though it uses the book it is not shy about putting its own ideas onto the screen. Some people want all of the novel into the movie, which is unrealistic unless you want a movie the size of Lord of the Rings (all of them).
The movie though is very good in my opinion. The main cast have a obvious chemistry which works well. The action sequences are well shot and forward the plot nicely, Bower and Myer's past experience in period pieces shows itself in their ease with the weapons. The handheld shots work well, as does the dark shadows in the backgrounds of most of the shots giving it that eery feel. Yes the directors and writers took some liberties with the novel but it created a film that had a straightforward storyline for those people who hadn't read the series. Hopefully we find out more about the complexities of the fantasy world in the second movie.
I see no problem with this movie, it gives a good basis for the second (and maybe more) movie. As with any series this complex the first movie has fulfilled its purpose, it has introduced us to the world, characters and relationships. But as I said earlier you will never please everyone!",1377302400,3,1427,4.429657794676806
5308722,5,B009AMAKWM,"This movie is an absolute treat for fans of the TMI books series! There's no way you won't enjoy seeing this gorgeous cast portray our beloved characters really, darn accurately for a book-adapted movie. The leads are especially impressive--Lily Collins not only looks perfectly the part of the petite, pretty and spunky Clary, she really acts the part, making Clary both every-girl relatable (with keen curiosity, intelligence, playfulness and self-motivation)  and also believably brave, resourceful and able to make decisions/take actions of her own volition, guided by her own morals and priorities (which *shock* don't all revolve around her love for the brooding, hot guy who's just rolled into her life as in certain other YA series...). She's a truly engaging actress and definitely has the sort of on-screen presence that can carry a movie centered on her.

Speaking of brooding hot guys--Jamie Campbell Bower IS JACE. Whatever about the cheekbones or physical appearance that might not perfectly coincide with your mental image of Jace--Jamie has the character of Jace down PAT. (SO RELIEVED he was able to deliver Jace's many memorable, hilarious one-liners just perfectly! Simon too, actually~~) He brings to life Jace's effortless charm, wry wit, intelligent ruthlessness and even the unexpected little moments of gentleness/kindness that make Jace such an interesting, lovable character. Plus the physicality--dang, he DOES move with sleek, cat-like grace in the movie, and his fight scenes are INTENSE. My co-workers (non-book fans) who came with me to see the film were a bit ""meh"" about it overall (but they are soulless corporate types, so very little impresses them), and even they commented that they were surprised and pleased at how hard-hitting the action scenes were. The fact that Jamie did all his own stunts just makes it even more impressive. :)

Wish I could go as in-depth on how awesome the rest of the cast was with portraying their respective characters, but in the interest of time/not boring you to death, suffice to say that every one of them owns their characters, GETS their characters, and looks ridiculously attractive while playing said characters (okay, Valentine being the exception--he's very different from the book version, but John Rhys-Meyer does a great job selling his own vision of the character (i.e. a completely Nucking Futs Valentine with a raw, animalistic ferocity to him)). Also, just have to say--Simon is HILARIOUS (and yet heartfelt/sympathetic), Isabelle is SO KICKASS IT KILLS ME WITH JOY, and Godfrey-Magnus is seriously A SIGHT TO BEHOLD. He may have a small language barrier (and I think they dubbed over him to smooth it out? It's pretty seamless in the movie), but his physicality/screen presence is so powerful! (also, the tenderness with which he reached out to Alec at the end~~ very believable!) I'm just so pleased with the cast~~~~

As for the movie itself, I'll admit it did run a little long for a movie of this genre for non-book fans. Also, considering HOW MUCH INFORMATION and how many twists are revealed over the course of a book, I realize now it might have been a little over-ambitious to try to squeeze it all into one movie. Again, for book fans, it's no problem to follow along since we already know all the intricacies of the story/world, but for first-timers, I think it was difficult for them to grasp all the necessary info on a first viewing. I give props to the script adapter and director for making sure intellectually that everything was explained, even if only in a brief line of dialogue. But again, I'd imagine only the book fans would be attuned enough with the world/source material to catch everything on a first viewing. Also--there are just so MANY cool ideas in this world (i.e. Cassandra Clare wrote a book where lots of interesting things are done/discussed, unlike certain other YA series that can easily fit all their ""content"" into an under-2-hour-long movie). I understand why the writer and director wanted to squeeze it all in (and again, as a book fan, I'm really thankful for it), but I do wonder if the movie suffered as a movie because of all that.

So overall, I feel like Harald and the crew made an AMAZING and loving/faithful adaptation of Cassie's fabulous book for film, and the cast did an equally loving/faithful job understanding and bringing each of her characters to life in a way that's very close to her vision. It is 100% a treat for the book fans. As for everyone else, it's a slightly tougher experience because the movie is so long and dense with info/plot that it's hard to take in on one sitting. I do encourage non-book fans to give it a try, however, and more than one viewing, if possible--you will undoubtedly get more the second time around and, I have a feeling, ultimately find this story very worthwhile/rewarding in the end. And anyway, the action, adventure and humor will make it fun even the first time around--give it a try! :D",1377216000,104,4975,4.939068100358423
8538504,3,B009AMAKWM,"The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones is a supernatural action drama geared towards teenagers, mostly girls. The main character is a girl who learns that she is really a Shadowhunter chosen by the angel Raziel to fight demons. Personally, I didn't think the story was particularly interesting, and the influences were pretty obvious ranging from Harry Potter to Star Wars. The villain has the rather obvious name Valentine Morgenstern! And yes, the Holy Grail is there, too. At least when showed on TV, the film is too dark, so much of the demon-hunting, vampire-slashing action was near-invisible. Funny detail: the werewolves are on our side in this story",1530230400,,657,5.092592592592593
