2653269,5,B000I5X7WU,"I feel very stupid. I ordered this DVD and King of the Death matches DVD. I did not realize that this DVD is a 2 set DVD with the first DVD being the King of the Deathmatches DVD. This DVD is far superior because it has audio commentary for the matches. Also this one has a 2nd DVD!

DVD 1 1995 Deathmatch Tournament

Tiger Jeet Singh vs Gannosuke- Grade C-

Leatherface vs Terry Funk- Grade C+

Cactus Jack vs Terry Gordy- Grade B

Hiroshi Ono vs Shoji Nakamaki- Grade B

Ichihara vs Okano- Grade B-

Iceman vs Kamikaze- Grade C

Terry Funk vs Tiger Jeet Singh-. Grade B

Cactus Jack vs Nakamaki- Grade A-

The Headhunters vs Silver King and El Texano- Grade B+

Dan Severn vs Tarzan Goto- Grade C

Cactus Jack vs Terry Funk- Grade A-

Overall Grade B+ (I rated this one slightly better since it had audio, and the DVD quality appears enhanced)

DVD 2

XPW best of the Death matches.- You get the whole DVD 5 solid matches that last a bit over an hour. This was a good DVD by itself. Grade A-

Random Matches

Dynamite D vs New Jack- Dynamite actually does a good job and puts up some solid offense. New Jack dominates as always. Grade B+

Kronus vs Homeless Jimmy- Just an awesome match, and Kronus really amazes me. This match had an amazing finish.. Grade A-

Kaos vs Johnny Webb- Wow what a great match. We saw light tubes, barbwire, tables, thumb tacks, kendo sticks, and chairs. The match stayed at a great pace. Neither of them wanted to give up and each took a massive beating. Both of them had so many thumb tacks in there boots they where sliding around. A sick missed moonsault and Kaos landed on the tacks and light tubes. Grade A

Supreme vs Alterboy Luke- Wow great hardcore match. I was shocked, I assumed it would be a classic squash match, since Luke looked out of his league. Luke hit Supreme with everything he had but the monster took control. Light tubes, tables, and thumbtacks where used, and we saw an amazing finish. Grade B+

Nosawa vs White Trash Johnny Webb- Well this is a great match, but they show it twice on the DVD. This is also shown on XPW best of the Deathmatches.

The best of the deathmatches is one of the best series out there right now. This DVD is fanytastic. For what you would pay for 1 DVD you get The King of the deathmatches DVD, XPW best of the deathmatches, and then 4 other top level matches from other XPW ppv's. This is 4:30 hours long and if you haven't seen the matches, you need to get this. Grade A",1183507200,11,2456,4.281995661605206
8144062,4,B000I5X7WU,"This is a great DVD featuring the famous deathmatch tournament from Japan. Definitely leans on the slower, more old school style, but still immensely fun to watch. The commentary is somewhat lacking, but invite some friends over, pop a few beers and you've got a world class commentary team right in your living room",1458691200,,316,4.87037037037037

8144064,4,B000I5X7WU,"The 1995 IWA King of Deathmatch tournament is a interesting pro wrestling time capsule
if you take it for what it is by '95 the Dathmatch gimmick was being over played in Japan
W*NG and FMW did much more brutal insane gimmicky type of matches earlier on (so much that the deathmatch was already  over saturated by 1995
The idea of Dathmatches are cool but, these  promotions beat it like a dead horse

Overall this particular Tournament is romanticized due to Mick Foley's book  and the now classic Raw segments with the footage during the Mankind interviews
It's interesting but, once you see it once the whole thing seems anti-climatic
Two very cool stand out matches  include
 seeing former UFC Champion Dan Severn  defend the NWA World heavyweight belt against  Tarzan Goto
Severn would hold that same  belt for four years until he lost it to Dory Funk Jr
and  The Headhunters defend the IWA World Tag Team belts
all the deathmatches are a bit average (you can tell CZW was inspired by this tournament)
 Both FMW and W*ING went all out
The deathmatch crutch would later be used in  promotions like ECW, XPW, CZW  Big Japan Pro Wrestling, Onita Pro  and IWA Mid-south
If you are a die hard ultra violet fan this might disappoint
This is the second print is North America it has a much better PQ my guess it's from the original master
The audio stinks sound effects have been put in and the original Japaneses commentators are removed
(which takes a lot away from Pro Wrestling out of the far east!) If you want  bad american commentators to this tournament get ICP's  Stranglemania at least that super funny and has dumb entertainment value  7/10
This second print also is a two-disc set (The second disc has XPW footage since Big Vision bought XPW they pad everything with XPW stuff which isn't a terrible thing over-all XPW was a cool concept/idea brought down by a shady incident",1450310400,,1885,4.646525679758308
8144065,5,B000I5X7WU,Interesting to see wrestling from Japan.  Very hardcore!,1435190400,,56,6.0
8144066,5,B000I5X7WU,This is a great DVD. Thank you.,1423699200,,31,3.5714285714285716
8144067,5,B000I5X7WU,The classic Kawasaki Dream. While not the first matches of this kind they definitely pushed the bar aside and put their bodies thru hell.,1376870400,,137,4.75
8144068,4,B000I5X7WU,"I had only seen a handful of the I.W.A. Japan tournament before this, via StrangleMania (one of my favorite wrestling tapes in my collection), and was reluctant to buy the usual Japanese import simply due to the lack of commentary and edits that I had heard about. That particular release is over 2hrs and 20mins while this version of ""Kawasaki Dream"" event is just over 2hrs, so this version is actually edited MORE. Don't let that fool you, however. Of the 11 matches featured on the first disc, and yes it is the entire card from 8/20/1995, only 3 of the matches are edited. All 7 of the tournament matches are here in their ENTIRETY. Likewise, the NWA World Heavyweight Championship match between Dan Severn and Tarzan Goto is also shown in its entirety, and this is, in my opinion, one of the best matches of the card; an instant classic, brutal, stiff match. The other three non-tournament matches, thankfully (IMHO), are trimmed down and made more exciting than they actually turned out being. So yes, these three matches are edited, but not in such a way as to destroy the integrity of the match. If anything, the edits make the matches watchable. Especially the dreadful Kamikaze/Iceman match. I can still smell that match from here nearly 20 yrs later. Overall, the ""Kawasaki Dream"" event is a must-own for any pro wrestling historian, fan, or aficionado. It truly is one of the most important events to ever happen in the history of the business.

Then there's disc 2....

Disc 2 features a DVD re-release of XPW's VHS ""The Best of the Deathmatches Vol. 1"". The first four of these matches are shown un-edited. The last match on the ""tape"", Supreme vs. Vic Grimes (2001 King of the Deathmatch Finals), IS EDITED. This ""tape"" definitely shows the impact and inspiration of the original 1995 I.W.A. Japan tournament, complete with ""Beds"" of barbed wire, spike nails, and thumbtacks, as the cover of the disc implies.

There are 5 bonus matches on the 2nd disc, the last of which is a repeat of the Nosawa/Johnny Webb deathmatch from the main ""The Best of the Deathmatches Vol. 1"" feature, so there actually 4 bonus matches, each shown in their entirety.

In all, there are 20 matches, minus the repeat, only 4 of which are edited for whatever reason.

There are a few striking observations that one could make after viewing these discs: Firstly, the original 1995 I.W.A. Japan tournament implemented a tremendous amount of psychology in respect to the tournament and how it unfolded. For example, the quarter-final matches of both Bracket A and Bracket B were fought under the same stipulations. The top half, Bracket A (Singh/Gannosuke & Funk/Leatherface), is fought under ""Steel Chain and Bed of Barbed Wire"" rules, while the bottom half, Bracket B (Jack/Gordy & Nakamaki/Ono), is fought under ""Barbed Wire Baseball Bat and Bed of Thumbtacks"" rules. Though the stipulations are identical, the matches are far from such. Each match is unique to itself and tells a unique story that not only furthers the inter-tournament storylines, but the degree of the violence that follows. The non-tournament matches are also booked in such a way as to not take anything away from the tournament, which is what drew the 25,000 or so to the Kawasaki Baseball Stadium in the first place.

Secondly, American deathmatch ""wrestling"", as evinced by the 2nd disc, lacks this aspect of professional wrestling that is quite honestly vital to the presentation of the business. Sadly, having watched more than enough of the Japanese deathmatch scene, it is not exclusive to America.

Thirdly, Many of the latter day deathmatch ""wrestlers"", Supreme, Grimes, Webb, Nosawa, look like athletic wrestlers but are nothing of the sort. These particular breeds of ""wrestlers"" seem to value assaulting their opponent, and themselves, over telling any kind of meaningful story in the ring. In contrast, the eight men involved in the I.W.A. tournament were legitimate workers with legitimate track records who understood the nuances of their profession, much like a fine comedian that actually understands comedy. The difference is quite striking.

I am not a fan of the current ""Ultraviolent"" scene in wrestling. Unlike the 1995 tournament, the current day product seems to me sanctioned assault. Weedwhackers, staplers, razor boards, salt, gasoline, cacti, all of this is simply too far for me and so far from what pro wrestling is supposed to be that I doubt one could even call the hardcore ""Ultraviolent"" fan a ""wrestling fan"" in any traditional definition of the phrase.

The 2nd disc of this set is a prime example of how ""Deathmatch"" wrestling, a staple (no pun intended) of wrestling since the days of Texas Rasslin' of the early '50s, has morphed into ""Ultraviolent"". While XPW, as evinced here, was carrying on the Japanese tradition, CZW in Philadelphia was tearing the envelope wide open with violence that bordered on obscenity. This 2-Disc set truly is a glimpse of pro wrestling in a state of evolution, and a must-own for any person who calls themselves a fan.

This edition was well worth the wait as the English commentary is good, and the extra disc more than makes up for what really is a very fast-paced first disc. Skip the bootleg and go for this. You, hopefully, will not be disappointed. I know I wasn't.",1367193600,,5307,4.919553072625698
8144069,5,B000I5X7WU,"I saw the finals match on YouTube between the two hardcore legends Mick Foley 'Cactus Jack' .vs. Terry Funk
And let me tell you what that match was insane! Ladders, Barbed wire, explosions, and chairs! At the end of the match poor Terry Funk couldn't even move his hands from the explosions. 5 out of 5 insanity!",1365724800,,312,4.491228070175438
8144070,3,B000I5X7WU,"As I was owning the previous one disc edition, in which only the tournament matches are shown in their entirety, I bought this 2 discs edition who claims to present, for the first time on an official release, the complete event...I mean, the jacket sleeve is even insisting on the non tournament matches, all of this making 2 hours of previously unseen footage....This ain't true !!! The first disc is just the one disc edition, still with the same edited matches but with a better picture quality and a slightly better soundtrack (and, oh yes, those dubbed chainsaw sounds in the ""Terry Funk Vs. Leatherface"" match are laughable...

The second DVD is indeed a re-release of an old XPW videotape titled ""Best Of Deathmatches""....Yes, you buy an IWA dvd, and you get XPW matches (about which no mention is even made on the jacket sleeve !!!)

Well, I never been a fan of XPW, but the matches included here are cool, I have to admit it.

To get back to the 1995 IWA King Of The Deathmatch event (aka :""Kawasaki Dream""), well, it's an historical event, but it's not the most violent and extreme wrestling event I've ever seen....I own Atsushi Onita's FMW videotapes from the early 90's (before 1995) who are by far more extreme and violent....And I also own other events from the IWA which are so much better. Concerning the event, some people say that a full release of the event could not be possible since it never existed as the non tournament matches have not been filmed in their enterity on the master tape...While some other people claim that a true full version of the event, spanned on two discs is circulating among fans circles, but I never seen one to this day....Does someone have a clue ?

I think the 1995 edition of King Of The Deathmatch became so famous and legendary because it was actually the first time such an event was taking place in front of a so large crowd and since stars like Cactus Jack and Terry Funk were taking part, but the matches are not so good, many moves are botched, you see the wrestlers constantly calling for spots, most matches in the tournament are extremely short...In fact, this very first edition of the Tournament is like the very first WWE WrestleMania ; it became a legendary event, but is far to be the best ever put by the WWE !

Well, in the end, you get 4 hours of good to very good wrestling action (thanx to the XPW matches) for less than 20 bucks...But if you already have the one disc edition from 2005, think twice about considering buying this re-release.

And quite frankly, the 1995 IWA King Of The Deathmatch has to be owned by any true wrestling fan !",1225238400,,2615,4.529661016949152
8144071,4,B000I5X7WU,"Very clear, unedited action.  Disc 1 has the entire death match tourney, including pre-match announcements and locker room interviews.  Disc 2 has several hardcore matches from XPW, of which I have never really been a fan.  If disc 2 had contained more Japanese death matches, this purchase would have gotten 5 stars, easily.",1223942400,,325,5.09433962264151
