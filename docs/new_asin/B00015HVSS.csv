1972061,5,B00015HVSS,"if you like sci-fi this is for you. im an early adopter, out of the 5 animie titles i've bought recently this is the best i've seen yet. great special effects. some of the 3D effects are so good they allmost look real. great sound and voice acting. great character development and plot. the camera anlges and panning realy add to the shock and awe that has brought us all to anime. the story is not linear but given to you in bits and pieces out of order adding to the awe and suspence just like any well written thriller book.  I cant wait till more episodes get released.",1080777600,,573,4.256880733944954
1972062,3,B00015HVSS,"I found it to be lacking in everything I thought I would be viewing.  Witch was airplane combat and fighting, plot went no ware.  Effects were great, but left me wanting more.  Overpriced DVD.",1080432000,2,192,4.588235294117647

1972064,5,B00015HVSS,Excellent beginning for yukikaze.  The fighterjets are amazing.  The extras are nice too as it shows the viewers how the makers went about making the film.  I can't wait for vol. 2 and all the rest! highly recommended! Grade A.,1078704000,2,227,4.625
1972065,5,B00015HVSS,"Yukikaze is, simply put, one of the best anime I've seen in some time.  Based on a 1987 science fiction bestseller (in Japan; it was never published in the US), Yukikaze tells the story of a war fought between mankind and a mysterious alien race known only as JAM.  The battles take place on a faraway planet called Fairy (accessible via a strange cloud near the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica).  While the war has been going on for over thirty years, the majority of the population on Earth believes the JAM threat is just an urban legend.
  The intense action scenes are balanced with a focus on the characters.  However, you will have to pay attention when watching Yukikaze--it is not for casual viewers.  Fans of science fiction, high adventure, or aircraft buffs should give this series a look.  Another fantastic work from GONZO.",1078012800,6,834,4.703448275862069
1972066,5,B00015HVSS,The animation alone is enough to recommend this DVD.  Absolutely awesome graphics.  The plot is secondary.  Or is it?  I find myself thinking more and more about the whacked-out and interesting premise.  The bloodlessness of the main character is intriguing.  Neat-O times ten.,1078012800,2,277,5.325581395348837
8006752,2,B00015HVSS,"The anime version of yukikaze is not on the same level as the novels. The anime seems too rushed and would make no sense if one hasn't read the books. Vol. 1 has two episodes- part one tries to minimize the plot of the first book, episode two is a chapter from the second. The characters do not bear much resemblance from the novels and yukikaze has none of the draw that the books have. Dissapointed.",1360800000,2,401,4.2894736842105265
8006753,4,B00015HVSS,"Yukikaze is a great, deep, and interesting look into a conflict fought a universe away. Showing the perspective of the largely ignorant public, and that of the pilots and machines fighting in 'Fairy', so in essence two distinct sides of a coin. The show has flaws, such as the fluidity of the story and lack of real plot development. It does have awesome action sequences, with Yukikaze itself being the most ridiculous weapon I've ever seen in a tv show (besides Gurren Lagann... ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWAH!)

Really I would give this show a 3.5/5, with 2.5 being perfectly average.",1358467200,,580,4.742574257425742
8006754,5,B00015HVSS,"As in the other dvds,this anime is good to have. You would have to watch all of the series to understand it. Starting with this one. If your gonna get this dvd,get the whole series.",1270425600,,181,4.2
8006755,5,B00015HVSS,"You need to get all of the series, it is short but would make a good movie if put togather.",1235174400,,91,3.6
8006756,5,B00015HVSS,This is about a group of jet fighter jocks. But instead of Migs here they are battling an alien enemy called the Jam on an alien planet. The main character's Jet has an on board A.I. (Artifical Intelligence) system that aids the pilot and weapons officer.,1150502400,,255,4.565217391304348
8006757,4,B00015HVSS,"Yukikaze is the tale of a forgotten war on another planet, connected to Earth by an anvil-shaped cloud in Antarctica.  Apparently around thirty years ago an alien race known as the JAM invaded via said cloud, but made little headway before being beaten back into their home territory.  Currently the war is being fought by a number of rejects from across the world - and for one of them, Rei Fukai, the line between the JAM and humanity is increasingly blurred as he finds himself the target of a plane identical to his.  There's also another problem - his onboard AI, Yukikaze, begins to exercise an almost hypnotic control over him.  However, its seemingly crazed actions may be the only thing capable of winning the war.

Yukikaze's plot is deep, and there are several substories and additions that one may find quite interesting.  As the characterization goes, I find it (as one other reviewer said) a tad effiminate regarding the two main characters, the main reason being the animation style they are drawn in.  The eyes are sometimes too feminine, the hair at times appears too smooth/wavy, and for some reason the animators have an annoying penchant for drawing the legs TOO long and willowy.  However, as these things go, they are minor complaints and don't detract too much from the overall product.

For, as one will perceive from both the limited edition and the normal box covers, Yukikaze is an action-laded anime, the centerpiece of which is the fighter jets.  Being an avid fighter buff, this is the primary reason I bought the movie.  I do realize that some would prefer the seamless CG integration to be used in fantasy genre endeavors instead of ""pointless"" jet fighters, but this is a ridiculous complaint (especially when considering that fantasy is the dominant form of anime nowadays and airplanes are a niche).  The designs of the airplanes are very well done, with some resemblance to the F-35 and some experimental jets.  The combat sequences, as some have already said, are masterpieces (I do have one gripe though - there's no music. WHY?).  There are also several VERY memorable action scenes separate from the dogfights. This is a great effort on Gonzo's part.

There remains one error, though - the dubbing.  I'm normally an opponent of rabid ""subbers"" as far as anime goes, having no problem with most dubbing jobs, but the work done here is undeniably sub-par.  Some of the sentences are extremely convoluted, and the voice actors (in keeping with the dark feel, a little TOO much) are often monotonous.  At times this effect is almost comedic, such as when Rei and his boss have a ""party"" of sorts, or when the latter says ""no.  I'm...happy..."" in a borderline catatonic tone.  However, the subbed version is always available.

Overall, Yukikaze is a great anime for any science fiction fan, and for the rest, very entertaining.",1128211200,16,2862,4.859793814432989
8006758,3,B00015HVSS,"33 years ago a dimensional portal opened in Antarctica, and what came through the door was not friendly. An alien race known as the JAM began attacking the Earth. A UN force was formed from the nations of the world and successfully pushed the aliens back to their homeworld, dubbed ""Fairy"", by the humans. Since all of the battles occur there, the JAM have become almost a fairy tale to normal people. But not to the Special Air Force (SAF), a military unit equipped with almost sentient jets, who launch daily sorties into Fairy. Rei Fukai pilots Yukikaze, one of these intelligent jets, and to the concern of his best friend, Bukhar, seems to relate more to the machine than to humans. With suspicions of JAM infiltration into the Earth forces, and with doppelganger planes confusing the SAF, its getting hard to know who to trust. There is also a push to make all jets unmanned, controlled fully by computers, with all the attendant dangers that go with it.

The animation in these two episodes is some of the best I have seen, seamlessly integrating traditional and cgi techniques. It makes Top Gun look bad. It's a little hard to figure out what is going on at first so it beckons for a second viewing. I thought the male characters were just a tad too effeminate, but that's a minor complaint.

Also features a making of documentary and interviews with the Japanese cast and crew. Great sound and picture in both languages.",1118102400,7,1429,4.666666666666667
8006759,4,B00015HVSS,"Whoever said there was no plot and a lack of combat sequences in the first 2 epsisodes is completely wrong., There is an incredibly detailed, subtle plot with lots of twists, which only gets better in episodes 3 and 4. I can hardly wait for episode 5 to see the conclusion of this action-packed scifi drama. The biggest battle is yet to come!",1114646400,2,342,4.444444444444445
8006760,5,B00015HVSS,"WOW!
First Macross, Area 88, Macross Plus and now Yukikaze. The story is similar to these prior anime series focusing on the planes and the pilots troubles. The show graphically is beautiful, albeit a bit dark with muted colors. Some of the shots of the sunset/sunrise skies are just gorgeous. The CGI is well done.
The story is not overly original, man vs. machine, but the execution of the story is what makes it great. The characters are likeable and you feel sympathy for those who get shot down.
The action sequences are just great. It is a blast watching the planes turn and bank, shoot and get shot down, kick in the afterburners and do other arial acrobatics.
There was a scene in episode 1 that almost made my jaw drop, sort of something like Tony Hawk would, but with a plane.
I cannot wait until the rest of the series is out!

8006761,5,B00015HVSS,"Im an electrician for the new super hornet currently. This film totally blew my mind with all the superb aircraft inovations. The acronyms, the radar altimeter sounds effects, the aero combats scenes, were down to a ""T"". Not to mention the ending theme song is pretty hip. If you love jets and new aerodynamic technology this series has it. This series is worth every penny. Now i hope Amazon can get there hands on ""Macross Zero""...USA....u haven't seen nothing yet.........",1087344000,8,475,4.95
