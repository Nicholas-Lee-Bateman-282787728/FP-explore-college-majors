8334695,5,B001PTUNLG,"Rollo May (1909-1994) was one of the last great ""Renaissance"" thinkers of the 20th century (others who wrote with great depth and scope of knowledge such as Eric Fromm, Ashley Montagu, Alan Watts, have also passed on).  This recording only several years before his death shows May talking with a few associates about his approach to psychotherapy and his concerns for its future. I recommend it to anyone wanting to encounter a man who helped shape the field of psychotherapy with insight and humanity, and whose vision we hope will not be eclipsed by cultural demands for quick fix solutions.
The only negatives about the film are the steep price and the  production quality is acceptable but not great. I was not watching it for the production quality so that was not relevant to me, but if that factors into it for you then be aware of that. Strongly recommended.",1289520000,2,866,4.766666666666667
