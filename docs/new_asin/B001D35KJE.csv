3524527,5,B001D35KJE,"Over the years I think I have watched four other Genghis Kahn flicks, excluding documentaries.  I have just finished watching this one in its entirety using the English subtitles.  This 10-disk, 30-episode, 1200-minute production by South Korea Studios will never be surpassed in its completeness, quality of production, and pure entertainment value.  Nothing else even comes close.  It will be too expensive for any studio to ever try to top it.  The packaging of the disks is good and durable, but the disks are somewhat difficult to remove from their holders.

The subtitles are printed in bold white using a good font in appropriate size.  I had no trouble reading any of them against the backgrounds of the scenes.  One doesn't have to understand spoken Chinese to realize that the translation to English could have been improved throughout.  The errors are misspellings, word ommisions and sometimes poor word choices, but those never prevented me from understanding the meaning of the dialog.  I found my self pausing the video constantly in order to not miss dialog, without also missing some of the abundant visual candy.  It was not unusual to have to back up and replay some frames to read subtitles that had flashed by too quickly, so be warned about that.

This is not just a sword and shield flick.  The story features plenty of battle scenes, but there is good development of Genghis Khan's character (from before his birth to his death), as well as all persons in his immediate family, his major generals, allies and foes, and his most important advisors.  Indeed there are brief times when portrayal of emotion - grief, shame, devotion, etc. - even gets a little too thick; however, that did not detract from the story too much.  Some of the dialog is clearly intended to provide the viewer with cultural and historical background that the writers deem helpful to the story.  All of the conqueror's major campaigns (those represented in most brief historys) are developed, including the personal or political circumstances leading to the action.  There is even some humor in this story, including a running joke (a promise made by the Khan involving women) that propagates throughout much of the story, until the promise turns into a political embarrassment.

The sets, both inside and outside, are highly detailed and believable.  The cinematography is high quality, gorgeous and sweeping, and the costumes and props match the best that Hollywood has ever produced.

About the battles.  You won't find horses being gored or blood splattered about in this flick; in fact there is not much blood at all, nor will you find the finest sword play that's ever been depicted (the Chinese Dao is not a fencing weapon).  There are enough extras and horses to portray the battles well, and the costumes and great photography contribute more.  I'd say the battles are respectable and contribute positively to the story, but are not as good as the best that have ever been filmed.  The battle sounds are believable with one exception, which is when someone gets thwacked.  It doesn't matter what the thwacking object is (a log, a rock, an arrow, a sword), about 4/5 of the time its a smacking sound like in the kung-fu movies.  The other battle sounds (charges, horses, arrows flying, siege engines) are done better.

One more thing...if you don't understand Chinese but have some practical experience with PinYin as I do (the PRC system of representing spoken Chinese using the English alphabet), you will have an extra advantage watching this.  You will understand the names of the characters better, both as they are spoken and as they appear in the subtitles.

Overall this version of Genghis Khan is a great flick.  I will probably enjoy watching it again sometime.",1301270400,,3776,4.947619047619048
3524528,5,B001D35KJE,"This is the most accurate series on genghis khan, not only focusing on his rise but also his latter years. Unlike the other movies about GK, this one has a strong philosophical content. It also shows clearly the steppe culture in Mongolia and north asia during Genghis' time.
My wife got me the chinese version from Beijing when it first came out in 2002. We both enjoyed it , with some help from her. China should come out with a followup on Kublai and the Yuan dynasty.

8291513,3,B001D35KJE,"I've enjoyed this, but the production values are very iffy and the story takes way too long. The sub title are sometimes mixed up in the translation so you may need to pause and rewind to read again in order to get the real meaning of what is being said. You can tell it has been filmed as a TV production. Many times there are people moving back and forth in the background to give the impression of many people when there are just a few. Not really as good as ""Mongol"" which started me on a quest to learn more about this historical figure that at one time ruled the greatest land mass in history. I would say buy it if you just can't live without. Otherwise don't.",1417132800,,667,4.178294573643411

8291515,5,B001D35KJE,"I've always had a fascination with the great conquerors and military geniuses of history. What is it that they saw that others didn't or couldn't? What drove them to achieve the things they did? And once they won their battles and wars and conquered, how did they rule afterwards? What were the effects of their conquests and how did they shape history into the world that we live in today? When considering the great conquerors and empire builders, you have the usual names like Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, and Napoleon Bonaparte in the annals of Western history. So how does Genghis Khan compare?

I've read over three dozens of books about Alexander and around a half-dozen about Caesar. I've always found ancient Greek and Roman history fascinating and especially these two great icons of their respective eras. I have a special fondness for Alexander, whose youth, brilliance, and unbridled idealism coupled with amazing military genius, courage and relentless drive still define the standard of leadership in the West. Caesar and Napoleon were also brilliant geniuses in their own eras but with a more cynical political bend (and ego trips) in their endeavors.

I had studied Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire from a young age growing up in Korea and have read various books here and there but never delved really deeply into him like I did with Alexander and Caesar. So, over the past couple of years, I made a firm commitment and effort to learn as much about Genghis Khan as I could. And over that period of time, I've delved even deeper into Genghis and the Mongol Empire he established than I did with Alexander and Caesar. Each era is very interesting and fascinating in its own way, but the scale of what Genghis achieved actually dwarfs that of Alexander and Caesar. And Genghis lived to be old (by the standards of his era) and set the foundation of an empire that actually doubled in size after his death. I've studied many empires but the one Genghis established is, in my mind, the most impressive and the greatest in history.

I've read all the requisite academical history books by the likes of Jack Weatherford, John Man, David Morgan, Giovanni Carpini, etc. and also the excellent historical novel series by Conn Iggulden. I've watched the movies: 'Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan', 'Genghis Khan: To the Ends of the Earth and Sea' (Japanese production), and the Russian-made 'By the Will of Genghis Khan'. I've watched the made-for-TV historical documentaries. They're all good in their own ways and provide different perspectives of the people who created them and how they view this remarkable man who suddenly appeared out of nowhere to greatly alter and impact world history. Basically, their books, movies, and TV shows just don't have enough time and resources to cover Genghis Khan's vast life.

This historical TV series with 30 45-minute episodes (22.5 hours) provides ample time to cover Genghis Khan's life thoroughly enough. I wouldn't recommend this DVD set to a Genghis novice. It's for someone who has already done a lot of research and study and is already familiar with the general story and most of the characters around Genghis Khan's life - family, friends, associates, and enemies. This series delves deep into Genghis Khan's life from the beginning (before his birth) to the very end

The production is very good for a TV series. They put a lot of thought and money into it. Visually, the weak point are all the battle scenes. Being that it was made for TV and an audience of all ages, there really isn't much blood at all and the action isn't very realistic. The most annoying aspect is the old fake kung-fu movie noises for the ""hits' and ""impacts"". The battle scenes are all pretty decent in the aforementioned movies that were more recently produced but those movies only scratch the surface of Genghis Khan's extraordinarily dramatic and action-filled life.

In the big scheme of things, the battle scenes aren't that important. One has to try to imagine what it was *REALLY* like. The strength of this TV series is the strong acting (especially by the actor who portrays Genghis Khan brilliantly) and the development of the stories. There is a natural plot that develops over the 30 episodes and it really is an amazing story - a story that no fiction writer would have the gall to try to write. The factual history of Genghis Khan's life and the rise of the Mongol Empire is virtually too fantastic and literally unbelievable for someone to make up for fiction. Alexander's life story had that too-amazing-to-believe quality about it as well but Genghis Khan's life (which was twice as long as Alexander's) story takes it to a whole different level in scope and scale.

This TV series shows Genghis Khan as - most likely - the greatest military genius, leader of a tribe and nation, conqueror, empire builder, and even ruler the world has ever seen. Was he ruthless? Yes, but not any more so than Alexander or Caesar. In fact, I feel that Genghis was more magnanimous than not. He had to do what he did to minimize the loss of his men moving forward. He actually exaggerated his ruthlessness and the number of people he killed for terror propaganda. His main goal was to preserve the lives of his men and induce the cities to surrender.

I've come to see that his evil reputation was borne out of his success in conquest and written in history and spread by the vanquished. People say that history is written by the victors but Genghis Khan and the Mongols weren't that interested in writing about their victories and history. Most of the history about Genghis was written by the ones who lost to Genghis and got conquered - including this TV series, which seems to be joint venture between Chinese and Korean TV production companies. Of course, all of China and Korea were both conquered by the Mongols in the 13th century by Genghis Khan and his successors.

I think my favorite Genghis Khan quote is: ""Conquering the world from the horseback is easy. It is dismounting and governing that is hard."" And that's what we see in this TV series. The battles and wars all seem matter-of-fact: overall, very easy victories for Genghis no matter who he fights: the rival Mongol tribes, the Tanguts, the Chinese Jin nation, and the Arab/Persian Khwarezmian empire, etc. What's really hard is keeping the people he conquered in line afterwards - including his feuding sons, double-crossing relatives, untrustworthy local governors, corrupt officials, etc. And that's what I saw on this TV series - that Genghis had his vulnerabilities and weaknesses as well like any other human being.

But compared to Alexander, Caesar, and Napoleon who all succumbed to hubris, inflated egos, self-induced delusion, and detachment from reality, Genghis exercised self-control, moderation, humility, and pragmatism like no other emperor in history. And he had the foresight to see beyond himself, beyond his own mortality... His sons and grandsons expanded his empire to over double the size of what he created but, in hindsight, it was the momentum he created that allowed it to expand as it did. His sons were good but mediocre compared to him. His grandson Kubilai certainly achieved greatness in his own right with the complete conquest of China and the establishment of the Yuan Dynasty but, ultimately, he also rode on the legacy of Genghis to achieve what he did.

If you've read at least a few books and watched a movie or two and have a decent understanding of his history, then I highly recommend this TV series. You'll get an amazing insight into what drove Genghis Khan that you just can't get anywhere else. For me, this TV series complements all the books, movies, and documentaries I've seen about Genghis in a very complete and satisfying manner. The life of Genghis Khan is one of the few most awe-inspiring stories of human history. There is no real equal in history and there never will be. He's kind of like Beethoven, kind of like Einstein, kind of like Steve Jobs... Pure unbridled genius driven by passion to somehow change the world for the better...",1393459200,,8113,4.842105263157895

I've read many books and articles about Genghis Khan, this series holds pretty much to historical information. The series is exciting and kept me interested throughout.

8291518,3,B001D35KJE,"Pretty Good Series but not for those who do not like subtitles.  Subtitles were OK but not nearly as good as those in Red Cliffs one and two. Sometimes too fast to really read well. Battle scenes were not portrayed all that wel, but were OK. It was like watching a 1950s movie battle scene, mabe even 1940s. Overall though I thought it was pretty good but for the price, the quality should have been better. Historically inaccurate. Battle scenes show mostly masses of troops fighting with swords and spears. Mongols used their expert horsemanshp, superior bows and excellent archery to stay out of range and decimate vastly superior enemies. At over halfway through the series, archery has played almost no part in the series. one would think the Chinese would know better.",1376438400,,774,4.819548872180451
