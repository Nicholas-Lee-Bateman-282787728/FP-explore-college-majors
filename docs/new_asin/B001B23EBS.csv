8466981,5,B001B23EBS,This is a wonderful documentary for anyone interested in learning about butterflies. The videography is outstanding and the narration is informative with excellent footage of the life cycle of the butterfly and ways to differentiate the various butterflies you see in your yard as well as presenting butterflies you will probably never see.  This would be helpful to the novice as well as someone wishing to improve their recognition of the different types of butterflies and their life cycles.  This is a keeper.,1246838400,,513,5.168674698795181
8466982,5,B001B23EBS,"This video is well crafted, and provides information on the rare and common butterflies of North America.  It is a monumental work, as you can imagine, since it covers so many species over a wide swath of North America.

It provides alot of information and video of rare butterflies that most people will never see in person.  It is well made and inspiring, and it does a nice job of showing the distribution, habitats, key identification features, host and nectar plants, activity patterns, and threats to approximately two dozen species.  The video also covers common butterfly species.

The video is inspiring in that some species are doing well thanks to the Endangered Species Act and the people protecting them, yet somewhat sad, because some species are so limited in habitat, they may not survive for much longer.

A great work!",1243296000,2,836,4.935714285714286
