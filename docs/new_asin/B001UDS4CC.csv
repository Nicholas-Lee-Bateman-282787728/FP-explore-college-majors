3797980,3,B001UDS4CC,"Let's be honest with ourselves.  Randy Savage was the man.  Back in the 80's/early 90's, the three major players in the WWF were Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior and The Macho Man.  Can anyone argue with that? Since then, Hogan's on and off love affair with Hulk Hogan has given me a headache and The Ultimate Warrior has pretty much become a punchline in the ""WWE Universe"" (ugh).  Randy on the other hand has remained pretty much a recluse in terms of pro-wrestling appearances since the close of WCW, and has had literally no connection to Vince McMahon's product in the last 15 years.  No one off appearances, no hall of fame induction and most surprisingly, no DVD... until now.  The reasons for all of this will most likely never be known (although there sure are some theories out there), but alas the WWE has finally decided to acknowledge that for almost a decade, Randy Savage was one of the top draws in the company.  Randy's music entrance, costumes, interviews (the voice), intensity and incredible in-ring ability made him at times the total package (no offense Lex).  That was the difference between Hulk/Warrior and Savage... he could actually wrestle.  In fact, he gave both of those guys their best worked Wrestlemania matches ever.  Which brings me to my actual review of a DVD set that contains matches, matches, matches, and some more matches.  Now I realize that this is a wrestling DVD, and there should be matches, but for me the highlight of these WWE DVD's has always been the documentary's.  ECW, Bret Hart, Brian Pillman etc.  Those discs were all made by their documentary's, the same as Ric Flair's and Shawn Michael's first sets were broken by their lack of story.  The fact that there isn't a documentary here makes me wonder why Vince didn't throw this together years ago.  I understand Randy most likely wanted nothing to do with this, or they wanted nothing to do with him, but c'mon.  The matches here are fine I guess, many have been shown to death (Ricky Steamboat, WM5, etc) and there are some gems in here for sure (DDP!), but I sure can't sit through and re-watch a couple of dozen matches at this point in my life.  Now an hour and a half long story told by Randy and his peers... that I would watch.  Overall, this is a solid pick up, but not what it could have and should have been.  Bury the hatchet already.",1244332800,7,2353,4.599520383693045

It plays automatically when you load the page. So, if you haven't pre-ordered yet b/c you were afraid WWE was going to pull it again, it looks like you can place that order now. It's definitely coming.",1241481600,,298,4.537037037037037
3797982,5,B001UDS4CC,"In working for the Philadelphia Spectrum for 25 years I was very fortunate to be in the building and meet Randy and his wife Elizabeth on the very first night he made his debut there. I was also lucky enough to have pictures taken with him and elizabeth that night before anyone really knew who she was. Many people have made Randy out to be a nasty and violent individual. I never saw a bad side to him while I knew him from the Spectrum, over the years I became good friends with him and his wife. I also wish Mcmahon would have let Randy do the commentaries on this dvd but I guess he did not want to pay Randy,So I would not have done it either..If you want to see Randy in his greatest matches buy the new Memphis series of Dvd,s Jerry Lawler always made him and others look like pure gold..",1239753600,2,796,4.141935483870967
3797983,5,B001UDS4CC,"FIRST I HEARD THAT WWE WAS GOING TO RELEASE THIS DVD COLLECTION LAST YEAR AND THEN VINCE HAS IT REMOVED DUE TO HIS PERSONAL FEELINGS TOWARDS SAVAGE. NOW I HEAR THAT IT'S SCHEDULED FOR A JUNE 9TH RELEASE FOR THIS YEAR.  I SURE HOPE THE WWE DOESN'T DISAPPOINT THE FANS BY NOT RELEASING WHAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE A GREAT DVD COLLECTION BY A TRUE LEGEND.  LET'S FACE IT, REGARDLESS TO WHATEVER ILL FEELINGS VINCE MCMAHON AND SAVAGE MAY HAVE FOR EACH ANOTHER, THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE MACHO MAN HAS DEFINITELY MADE A GREAT CONTRIBUTION TO THE WWE AND THE SPORT OF PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING.  HIS MATCH WITH RICKY THE DRAGON STEAMBOAT AT WM3 IS WITHOUT A DOUBT A TRUE CLASSIC NOT TO MENTION THE COUNTLESS GREAT MATCHES HE HAS HAD WITH HOGAN, FLAIR, AND DDP.  VINCE MCMAHON ALWAYS SPEAKS OF WHAT'S BEST FOR THE FANS AND WWE BUSINESS, BUT HOW CAN HE SAY THIS WHEN HE INJECTS HIS PERSONAL FEELINGS TOWARDS SAVAGE AND DENIES THE FANS WHAT COULD BE A TRUE GEM OF A DVD COLLECTION. VINCE, PLEASE SET ASIDE ANY PERSONAL FEELINGS AND DUE WHAT'S BEST FOR WWE BUSINESS AND THE FANS.  MAKE THIS RELEASE HAPPEN JUNE 9. AND I ALSO HOPE YOU WOULD CONSIDER RELEASING OF OTHER 3 DISC COLLECTIONS FOR GREATS SUCH AS RICKY THE DRAGON STEAMBOAT, STING (YOU DO OWN THE WCW LIBRARY), AND CHRIS JERICHO.",1236384000,,1272,4.489177489177489
3797984,5,B001UDS4CC,"According to Silvervision:
The official blurb for the set reads, ""He was one of the most controversial superstars in history of sports entertainment, through his complicated relationship with Miss Elizabeth, his dramatic WWE championship tournament run at WrestleMania IV, the formation and explosive breakup of the MegaPowers with Hulk Hogan, his reign as the Macho King, and his shocking jump to WCW. ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage brought a chaotic poetry to the ring. He's widely considered one of the finest in-ring competitors of all time, and his interviews were always a sight to behold. For the first time ever, fans can relive the entire storied career in Macho Madness: The Ultimate Randy Savage Collection, a 3-DVD set that spans two decades of exciting and intense matchups.""

3797985,3,B001UDS4CC,"Great matches but no story or history of Randy. As someone who didn't grow up watching Wrestling during his lifetime, i bought this hopping to learn more about him. instead of a biography its just a collection of his best matches with lame interludes by two people with no connect to Savage at all. weak story telling but very strong matches. Wish it had been more of his story, who he was and why he made the choices he did. you only get a little of that from his promos, but those are only on the third disk and have very little to do with anything. if you are already a fan, you'll love the matches. if you don't know anything about him, this isn't going to help you understand him. still enjoyed it, but i can't say i loved it or that i'd recommend it.",1459900800,,756,4.184931506849315

While there are some flaws, like not being able to hear from the man himself; we all knew deep down, that was never going to happen.

I would have probably cut Savage/Yokozuna and the Savage/Flair ""Lifeguard  Match"" from Disc 3 and moved all of the Special Features to Disc 3 (and actually had them in chronological order). Yes, the segments on Disc 3 were in order, but the Match Made in Heaven segment from Disc 1 would have fit better on Disc 2, and the segments on Disc 2 would have fit better on Disc 1.

So the best compromise would have been to cut some matches form Disc 3 and rearrange things.

Oh, and I would have switched out the DDP match that's on here with the one from Spring Stampede when he put DDP over.
Like, I would have rather seen the Savage/Crush match from WM 10 instead of the Yokozuna match.  And the Flair/Savage stuff was a bit of overkill seeing as they also had both matches where Savage won the title from Flair (WWF title at WM 8, WCW title on Nitro). Plus they had a rare tag match with Savage and Bret Hart vs Flair and HBK.

 Watching this DVD brought back a lot of memories, because I was a kid during the Hulk Hogan/Macho Man era.
 First off, unlike the Undertaker DVD I reviewed, there is not a bad match on any of the three disc. Every disc has classic matches on it, I am going to go down each disk and tell you the best matches on each one.
 Highlights (Matches you need to buy this set for) are: Wrestlemania 3 Macho Man vs. Ricky ""the Dragon"" Steamboat for the IC belt, Macho Man vs. The Million Dollar Man for the WWE title, The Mega Powers vs. the Mega bucks at SummerSlam, Macho Man vs. Hulk Hogan for the WWE title at Wrestlemania 5, Macho King Vs. The Ultimate Warrior, Macho Man vs. Ric Flair at Wrestlemania 8 for the WWE title, and a tag team match with the Macho Man teaming with Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels.

Here is a 3-Disc collection of some of his greatest matches from the beginning to the end of his in-ring career. Hosted by Maria & Matt Striker (who admit they were huge Savage fans growing up), they give their insight and personal views on Macho's career in between the matches.

Disc 1

-7/9/85, Prime Time Wrestling, WWE Debut, vs. Rick McGraw: We see the birth of the Macho Man in WWE and its a good match. McGraw does get some good moves in but Randy does use some agility and of course dirty tactics on the outside to wear down is opponent. Savage does hit his trademark elbow from the top and makes the cover to win the match. 6/10.

-12/7/85, Boston Garden, vs. Ricky Steamboat: Before their classic at Wrestlemania III we get this match which is quite enjoyable in its own right. Ricky runs Savage's arm into the ring post then works it over with chops and arm drags. Randy also has a good showing here but he has to resort to using a loaded fist while being set up in a backdrop, to pick up the win. 7/10. Nice post match action between the two as Steamboat was irate at losing and got the object from Randy.

-12/30/85, Madison Square Garden, WWE Chamionship Match, vs. Hulk Hogan (Champion): A mere 5 months into his WWE run he was challenging the world champion and its not as good as their Wrestlemania encounter, but its still a good match. Randy threw a chair into the ring and even used Elizabeth as a shield and stayed on the outside to anger the champ. Hogan did get some shots in but Savage did hit a double ax handle to the outside to wear down the champ. The ref is down, Randy hits Hogan with the belt from the top rope to the outside and Hogan gets counted out, so he loses but doesn't lose the title. 6/10.

-2/8/86, Boston Garden, WWE Intercontinental Championship Match, vs. Tito Santana (I.C. Champion): Good match here between two good technicians, both do also get some hard shots in and brawl good as well. Tito was always a good worker and this match showed why as much like the previous Steamboat match, Savage used a foreign object and made the cover as Randy's quest for WWE gold became reality. 7/10.

-1/3/87, Boston Garden, WWE Intercontinental Championship Match, vs. Bruno Sammartino: Right after Savage injured Ricky Steamboat's throat, Bruno was interviewing Randy and the legend took it personally, so we have this match. It isn't a bad contest as Bruno was still able to do well even at this stage of his career and Randy tried to avoid him, while getting in some cheap shots. Savage ended up hitting Bruno with a chair behind the refs back and snuck in the ring to win the match via countout. 7/10. An enraged Bruno locked on the bearhug on Savage that not even a few refs, officials and superstars could break at least for a couple of minutes.

-3/29/87, Wrestlemania III, Intercontinental Championship Match, vs. Ricky Steamboat: Hogan/Andre may have brought the fans into the arena but this match was the best on the card. Both men just went all out and had the crowd on the edge of their seats the whole time. Tons of near falls, high impact moves and a good ending as Steamboat rolls up Savage for the 3 count to win the I.C. title. 10/10.

-2/5/88, The Main Event, WWE Intercontinental Championship Match, vs. The Honky Tonk Man (Champion): Not a bad one here as Savage was going for his second I.C. title against the longest reigning I.C. champ of all time. Honky was never the best wrestler but he was a decent heel and we all know what Randy can do. Savage prevented Elizabeth from being attacked and won the match by countout so he didn't win the title. 6/10. This match is more remembered for Miss Elizabeth preventing a guitar shot from Honky even standing between him and Savage.

-3/27/88, Wrestlemania IV, WWE Championship Tournament Finals, vs. ""The Million Dollar Man"" Ted DiBiase w/Andre The Giant: Great match here as Savage had wrestled 3 matches already, while DiBiase had only wrestled once. Randy had to deal with the Andre at ringside who even prevented him from executing some of his offense. There's good wrestling by both men and at one point, Savage sent Elizabeth to the back, she came back out with Hulk Hogan who played an key role in the end as he hit DiBiase with a chair and Randy hit the elbow to win the match and the WWE title. 8/10.

-6/25/88, Madison Square Garden, Steel Cage Match for the WWE Championship, vs. ""The Million Dollar Man"" Ted DiBiase w/Virgil: This I feel is just as good as the previous match as both make good use of the cage, while using some good wrestling moves as well. Savage tries preventing Ted from escaping but Virgil interferes on Ted's behalf whenever Randy tries to escape. Macho ends up hitting DiBiase and Virgil's heads together at the top of the cage then climbs over to retain his title. 8/10.

Extras on Disc 1

-Summerslam '91, The Wedding of Macho Man Randy Savage & Miss Elizabeth: Great segment a good time capsule for any wrestling fan.

Disc 2

-8/29/88, Summerslam, w/Hulk Hogan vs. Andre The Giant & ""The Million Dollar Man"" Ted DiBiase, Special Guest Referee, Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura: The Mega Powers took on two of the best heels in the wrestling business in what was a good match, but it was kinda marred with Ventura's shoddy work as a ref, which led to lots of dirty tactics by Andre and DiBiase. As Hulk and Savage were on the outside, Elizabeth came up on the ring apron and used her assets to distract the heels and the ref. This allowed Hogan to slam DiBiase for Savage as he hit the elbow drop, then Hulk hit the leg drop for the win. 8/10.

-4/2/89, Wrestlemania V, WWE Championship Match, vs. Hulk Hogan: Probably Hogan's best opponent was Randy Savage and this match was no exception. Randy made Hulk look great and there was the usual hulking up and all the antics both men are famous for. There's a good mix of wrestling and brawling as Hogan was looking to exact revenge on Savage for all the jealousy Randy showed when they were teaming up. Great match that saw Hogan hit the leg drop and make the cover to win his second WWE title. 10/10.

-3/22/90, The Main Event, WWE Championship Match, vs. Hulk Hogan (Champion) w/Special Guest Enforcer, Buster Douglas: Hogan was more aggressive in this match, taking it to Savage who had to rely on his manager Sherri to gain an advantage. We got the usual spots and moves from Randy and he almost had him beat, but Hogan hulked up and after the ref was knocked down, Hulk hit the leg drop and Douglas came in and made the count. 7/10. Nice post match where Randy was angry with Douglas for the count, even slapping him, but Hogan pushes Savage into a couple of punches by Douglas and Randy is down.

-4/1/90, Wrestlemania VI, Mixed Tag Team Match, w/Sensational Sherri vs. Dusty Rhodes & Sapphire: Its not the best match though the antics by all involved make it at least fun to watch. Rhodes just wasn't that great at this point in his career and Sapphire wasn't a trained wrestler, though she did throw the smaller Sherri around the ring. Miss Elizabeth was at ringside and pushed Sherri back and she fell over Sapphire who made the cover to win the match. 5/10.

-3/24/91, Wrestlemania VIII, Retirement Match, vs. The Ultimate Warrior: Easily Warrior's greatest match as Savage helped make him look fantastic in the ring. It was a great back and forth contest where the fans seemed to have no idea who would win and with a few close close near falls it was certainly tension filled. After Savage hit 5 elbow drops with Warrior kicking out, Savage gets knocked around after this, shoulder blocked out of the ring a couple of times. Warrior pulls Randy into the ring and covers him with one foot for the win. 9/10. The aftermath where the reunion of Miss Elizabeth and Savage happened was very emotional to the point it brought tears to the eyes of many in the crowd.

-12/3/91, Tuesday In Texas, vs. Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts: This was shortly after Savage was re-instated and after the attack from Jake's cobra that bit into Randy's arm. Macho attacked Jake in the entrance way and he took it to Roberts early on, but Jake ran Randy's damaged arm into the ring post a few times. He worked Savage over wearing him down but his attempt at the DDT was countered and Randy hit the elbow and made the cover to win. 7/10. However the aftermath saw Jake hits a couple of DDTs and bring the snakebag in the ring. This prompted Elizabeth to run down to prevent Roberts from using the snake, but not from hitting another DDT on Savage.

-4/5/92, Wrestlemania VIII, WWE Championship Match, vs. Ric Flair (Champion): A vastly underrated match and one of the top Wrestlemania matches of all time. Flair tries to stay away from Savage who was out for revenge for Ric making advances towards Miss Elizabeth leading up to this match. These two put on a great wrestling match mixed with plenty of brawling, Flair gets bloodied but he takes it to Savage working on Randy's leg locking on the figure four. Savage does end up getting a roll-up while holding the tights and he pins Flair to win the WWE title. 10/10.

Extras on Disc 2

-7/30/85, Elizabeth's Debut: Good segment here as Savage introduces Elizabeth as his manager.

-9/30/89, The Coronation of the Macho King: Classic heel Savage as he delivers a promo like only he can.

Disc 3

-4/19/92, European Rampage, WWE Championship Match, vs. Shawn Michaels: Very good match here, a lost classic as a young HBK takes on the veteran Macho Man. There's some good wrestling here and the usual spots, though the story here was whether Savage's leg could take a beating after how much he suffered at Wrestlemania 2 weeks prior. Shawn had a great showing here as he wore down Randy inside and outside the ring, even kicking out of the elbow drop at one point. Elizabeth came from the back and prevented Sherri from interfering, Savage hits a crossbody from the top and pins Michaels for the win. 9/10.

-7/22/92, Worchester, MA., w/Bret Hart vs. Ric Flair & Shawn Michaels: Wow this was a major treat to see as four hall of famers faced off in a classic tag team match. All four do so well here and hit some great moves along with some great tag team wrestling. Shawn gets thrown into Sherri on the ring apron, then Savage rolls up Michaels to win the match. 10/10.

-2/28/94, Raw, WWE Championship Match, vs. Yokozuna (Champion): Quite a good one here as Savage had a chance to disrupt the main event at Wrestlemania X and in the process win his third WWE title. Yoko hits his usual big man moves, while Randy has to use his quickness and even ended up hitting Yoko with a bucket from the outside but couldn't get the 3 count. He hits the elbow but Crush interferes to cause a DQ. 8/10. Good aftermath where Lex Luger and Bret Hart end up coming to Savage's aid.

-7/16/95, WCW Bash At The Beach, Lifeguard Match, vs. Ric Flair: A glorified lumberjack match with various WCW wrestlers around the ring to throw either man back in the ring should they go to the outside. Its not a bad match, there's the usual favoritism shown by some of the lifeguards, like Arn Anderson helping Flair, even DDT'ing Savage. They do hit some good moves and this pushed Randy's never give up persona as he came back and hit the elbow from the top to win the match. 7/10.

-1/22/96, WCW Monday Nitro, WCW Championship Match, vs. Ric Flair (Champion): We get a good but short title match with the usual good moves and antics from both men. Once again Savage just wouldn't give up even after being locked into the figure four, Randy came back nailing some good moves. Arn Anderson came down but hit Flair on accident, Savage hits the elbow drop and makes the cover to win the WCW title. 6/10.

-7/15/97, WCW Great American Bash, Falls Count Anywhere Match, vs. Diamond Dallas Page: DDP came through the crowd and attacked Randy from behind and we have one intense match-up here, it went all over the place with some great spots throughout. The action went into the crowd and DDP even used a fans crutch to hurt Randy. Back in the ring Savage worked on DDP's injured ribs, but DDP wouldn't give up and we have more action on the outside where they used a picnic setting and even had a BBQ grill used. There's the expected NWO involvement by Scott Hall who hits the Outsider Edge, then Savage hits the elbow drop and makes the cover to win. 9/10.

-7/11/99, WCW Bash At The Beach, WCW Championship Match, w/Sid Vicious vs. Kevin Nash (Champion) & Sting: Its a tag team match with the WCW title on the line. But Sting could cover his own partner and win the title, so its more like fatal four way, but its wrestled like a traditional tag match. If the way this is booked sounds confusing, trust me it is. Its not a terribly great match, though each guy gets their spots in. Near the end Sid hits a slam on Nash, then Savage hits a top rope elbow and makes the cover to win the WCW title. 5/10. Side Note: Kinda sad to see how Savage was clearly at the end of his run as he wasn't very good in this match.

Extras on Disc 3

17 of the Macho Man's classic promos as only he can deliver them. Pretty funny and crazy just like the man himself.

I personally enjoyed this collection of matches though I could've done without the final WCW match. It shows how Randy Savage truly was one of the greatest wrestlers of all time, just too bad there was no documentary on this DVD.",1315872000,,13598,4.498581272800973

While I'm upset that there is no documentary (his career is worthy of one), I will overlook that here as this is quite a collection of matches although a somewhat decent portion has been released before. I'm just reviewing the matches themselves (along with a few non match stuff). But will skip and the reason for it will be known once you read on.

Randy Savage vs. Rick McGraw - Prime Time Wrestling - July 9, 1985 - Randy's WWE debut. After seeing this, I knew he was ""A future star destined to shine.""

Savage's Choice for a New Manager

Randy Savage vs. Ricky Steamboat - While not the classic that was at WM3, a great encounter here. I liked how the finish happened as I don't remember the last time I've seen it in WWE.

One of the Most Hated Men in Wrestling

Randy Savage vs. Hulk Hogan - Madison Square Garden - December 30, 1985 - This was for the WWE Championship. I feel their WM5 bout was better as both men were more established by then. But this was great, hard worked match.

Setting His Sights on a Different Title - Savage sets his sights on the I.C. Title.

Randy Savage vs. Tito Santana - Boston Garden - February 8, 1986 - These two worked well. Watching this makes me wonder why they never had a feud leading to a ppv bout. The I.C. Title & a ppv match meant something back then.

Old Generation Meets New Generation - Simple. The old generation, Bruno meets the new generation, Randy Savage.

Randy Savage vs. Bruno Sammartino - Boston Garden - January 3, 1987 - I don't know Bruno much. He wsas before my time so I've never seen much from him. He's quite known though & for some reason, he doesn't get along with Vince which is probably why a DVD set hasn;t been done on him yet nor has he been inducted into the HOF yet. I read that Vince himself reached out to him more than once & he's always declined. Those who've seen him say he's HOF worthy. With that said, this was a match between 2 HOF worthy wrestlers.

The Greatest Match in WrestleMania History

Randy Savage vs. Ricky Steamboat - WrestleMania III - March 29, 1987 - The greatest till Taker vs HBK from WM25. However, Taker vs Shawn was decades later. Until that match, Savage/Steamboat was THE GREATEST MATCH IN WRESTLEMANIA HISTORY. Enough said. Rewatch this. Randy's pre-match comments are here too.

Attempt to Regain the Intercontinental Championship

Randy Savage vs. Honky Tonk Man - The Main Event - February 5, 1988 - I liked this match a lot. I recommend it.

The Road to the WWE Title

Randy Savage vs. Ted DiBiase - WrestleMania IV - March 27, 1988 - I got goosebumps when Randy won & he was announced as the WWF Champion. He deserved it. And this was a great bout. A fitting way to end the tournament. Both men really put on a show despite having to compete (don't remember how many times) before this match.

The Return Bout

Randy Savage vs. Ted DiBiase - Madison Square Garden - June 25, 1988 - The rematch that took place inside a Steel Cage. Wow, was this good. I liked it very much bit preferred their WM IV match more.

Special Features

The Wedding of Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage and Elizabeth - SummerSlam - August 26, 1991 - This SSlam had the ""A Match Made in Heaven"" tagline & this was why, Very emotional. I was waiting though for Jake & Taker to appear. But they didn't. Were their appearance cut?

Randy Savage & Hulk Hogan vs. Andre the Giant & Ted DiBiase - SummerSlam - August 29, 1988 - The main event of the first SSlam event. I really liked this match. Funny seeing Randy in yellow tights. He & Hulk were a great team.

Randy Savage vs. Hulk Hogan - WrestleMania V - April 2, 1989 - Back then, this was special. To me, still is. It's what everyone was waiting for & anticipated. The match where The Mega Powers truly exploded. There was a tease that this would happen at the Royal Rumble match when Hulk eliminated Randy. With Elizabeth's help, they seemed to patch things up. But here, their partnership/friendship & the team known as The Mega Powers were no more. A great match. One of Hulk's best WM matches thanks to his opponent.

Randy Savage vs. Hulk Hogan = The Main Event - March 22, 1990 - The third Hulk/Randy encounter on this set. I prefer their WM5 match over the other 2. But this was one was wonderful too.

Randy Savage / Sherri vs. Dusty Rhodes / Sapphire - WrestleMania VI - April 1, 1990 - Not really a favorite of mine. I could never get into Dusty as a wrestler.

Randy Savage vs. Ultimate Warrior - WrestleMania VII - March 24, 1991 - The famous Retirement match from what many feel isn't one of the best WM events. Can't say I disagree. But this was the match of the night for me. But the aftermath was more emotional than the outcome of the match.

Randy Savage vs. Jake Roberts - This Tuesday in Texas - December 3, 1991 - I didn't hate this match. But I preferred their SNME match from 9 along with any pre & post match stuff where the famous Taker face turn took place. That match was the best in their feud & much better their their Tuesday In Texas bout.

Randy Savage vs. Ric Flair - WrestleMania VIII - April 5, 1992 - What a match! Match of the night from personally one of my favorite WM's. Only complaint was when the match took place. This should have been the last match. But then again, if it was, we may not have the excellent post-match comments from the two men, which are sadly not included on this set. However, I saw it on youtube. Worth a watch!!

Special Features

Elizabeth's Debut - Championship Wrestling - July 30, 1985 - These two made quite the pair & it begins here.

The Coronation of the Macho King - Superstars - September 30, 1989 - A memorable segment for me.

Disc 3

Randy Savage vs. Shawn Michaels - European Rampage - April 19, 1992 - one of the rare & BEST matches on this entire set! Loved the finish! Enough said!!

Popularity on the Rise

Randy Savage / Bret Hart vs. Ric Flair / Shawn Michaels - Worcester, MA - July 22, 1992 - A wonderful tag bout with two teams who don't aren't officially a tag team. Four great competitors in one match with two (Bret Hart & HBK) being future stars in the middle of a singles push.

Behind the Mic

Randy Savage vs. Yokozuna = RAW - February 28, 1994 - Seems every WWE release has one if not more contesnt that is just a waste of DVD space. This is one of them. I wish the ultra rare tag bout where Macho Man teams with The Undertaker. I think this happened somewhere between 92-94. It may have been a House Show bout. I've seen it on youtube. Only reason why I wish it wash ere was because it'd be a great replacement for this match, features my 2 favorite wrestlers from those days as a team, and it's rarity.

A Change of Scenery

Randy Savage vs. Ric Flair - Bash at the Beach - July 16, 1995 - The Lifeguard match. IMO, their WWF matches were better. Still good though.

Rivalry Renewed

Randy Savage vs. Ric Flair - Nitro - January 22, 1996 - For the WCW Championship. I liked it.

The Rise of nWo

Randy Savage vs. Diamond Dallas Page - Great American Bash - June 15, 1997 - A GREAT encounter. DDP credits this match as the one that really made a main eventer out of him and it did.

Team Madness

Randy Savage & Sid Vicious vs. Kevin Nash & Sting - Bash at the Beach - July 11, 1999 - Wooo! A Sting match! Rare on a WWE dvd. Not really the best bout though. Sting & Randy had 2 singles matches in 98 I believe that I think were for the WCW Championship. One took place on Thunder. The other, Nitro I think? They should've added those. Also they had a few singles matches on ppvs (don't remember which ones) which would have been a great addition too.

3798048,4,B001UDS4CC,"Growing up as a kid and watching the WWE, there were 4 dominant wrestlers who my brother and I worshiped... Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, Sting, and the Macho Man Randy Savage.

So needless to say when I heard that the Macho Man Randy Savage had passed away, I had to pick up his Greatest Matches dvd.  I had too.

Now for the review:

The GOOD:  This dvd covers all of Macho Man's greatest matches from his career.  You can relive every Macho moment because it's all here.  They also included the Miss Elizabeth and Macho Man's Match Made in Heaven (wedding).  It also has Macho Man's debut match which I thought was very interesting since I've never seen it before.

The Bad:  The two hosts of the DVD don't really give much feedback on Macho Man's legacy, they pretty much just offer small facts which is disappointing.  However everyone knows Mach would not be doing a documentary about his wrestling career if it involved Vince and the WWE.  I'm just happy they were able to include his matches from WCW and WWE in this package.

The AMAZING:  The DVD literally starts from the beginning of Macho's Career to his final days at WCW.  You truly get a the Cream of the Crop when it comes to match quality.

Again the only disappointment was the lack of having Macho Man in the dvd, giving back stories, ect..  But seriously... I'm ok with that since most of the wrestling dvds that are coming out are all Documentaries and lack the quality of matches.

If you pick it up you won't be disappointed.

OOOOOOOOOHHHH YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!",1308614400,10,1544,4.589743589743589
3798049,5,B001UDS4CC,"Plain and simple! The most bang for your buck in a WWE product. Sure there is no interview, but Randy Poffo was very private in his later years. Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage was part of the greatest story lines in WWE history. If you are a casual fan remembering yester-year, this is the collection for you. He faced all the greats, so you get a sweet mix of them in the 80s and 90s. Other reviews go match by match so no need for me to do so. WrestleMania III and WrestleMania VII are cream of the crop.

The fact is, WWE mailed the Macho Man DVD in. It is boring beyond boring. It's just one match after another with the worst most annoying commentary ever between each one. I have no idea who the chick is that gives the commentary and I have no idea who the guy is either. But together, they offer really annoying morning radio banter and I hate both of them.

Macho Man was awesome. I feel bad that this DVD is so awful. There's literally one special feature per DVD. So in total, there are three special features and the rest of the DVD package is just match after boring match and morning show banter by two idiots.

Seriously, I am thinking about returning it even though I watched it. Not sure if this is possible but I am going to ask Amazon b/c I am a heck of a good customer and it's just ridiculous how little effort they put into this. I'm done with WWE DVD's - you can just youtube macho and save yourself the time and money from having to suffer through his DVD.",1282867200,2,1130,4.222222222222222

Vince McMahon declared we were witnessing one of the greatest moments in the annals of sports history and it was barely touched on when the entire match should have been shown.

3798057,5,B001UDS4CC,"Being a fan of pro wrestling myself, I remember watching it in it's glory days of the 1980's and 1990's. One of the superstars that stuck out in my opinion had to be Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage. Now, there is a great mystery surrounding Vince Macmahon and Randy Savage to this day. Some say it's the controversy of Savage leaving WWE in 1994 and jumping ship to WCW, some say it's the fact that Savage took his very lucrative Slim Jim deal when he went with him and others say that it had something to do with Savage coming on Stephanie Macmahon. None of which matters. What matters is I told myself I wasn't going to buy any WWE 3 disc sets unless they produced a DVD showcasing the career of the ""Macho Man"". Needless to say, I own several WWE DVD sets now and I'm proud to say it all started with the ""Macho Madness"" the Randy Savage Ultimate Collection. Now, this DVD is for pure wrestling fans only. The reason why I say that is because you won't get any documentary on here because Vince and Randy aren't on good terms. However, there are several great matches on this DVD that you can add to your wrestling library. I highly recommend this to any wrestling fan. Especially and younger wrestling fans who are unfamiliar with the likes of one ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage. The special features alone will make this purchase worth it. Randy Savage was known for having a method to his ""madness"". (Yes, pun intended.) So, check it out, you won't be disappointed.",1275609600,2,1458,4.464419475655431
3798058,4,B001UDS4CC,"Very excited to receive this 3 disc set. Macho Man was not only one of the most controversial but colorful, athletic & entertaining wrestlers of all time. Here you get to see many of his matches in FULL! From his debut in the WWF against Rick McGraw in 1995, an otherwise dull drawn out match, but Macho certainly shows us a glimpse of things to come with some outstanding matches, none better then ""The Greatest Match in Wrestemania History"", against Ricky Steamboat. There are many of Macho's promo's, on the 3rd disc alone there are 17 and as matches are shown in full, we also see promos from Macho's opponents. His choice of manager - the beautiful Ms. Elizabeth. Plus their marriage shown in the extra's on disc 1. Disc 1 also includes matches against Hulk Hogan, Tito Santana, Bruno Sammartino, Honky Tonk Man & two matches against ""Million Dollar Man"" Ted Dibiase, the 2nd being a cage match. Disc 2 has him teaming with Hulk against Andre the Giant & Ted Dibiase before another match against Hulk at Wrestlemania 5. The beginning of the Macho King era V Hulk at Saturday Nights Main Event and a classic retirement match against Ultimate Warrior with a major twist after. Disc 2 rounds out with matches against Jake the Snake Roberts and Ric Flair. Disc 3 has him up against Shawn Michaels, Yokozuna plus 2 matches against Ric Flair this time from WCW and rounding out disc 3, are WCW matches against DDP & tag team action with Sid Vicious against Kevin Nash & Sting. I would've given this 5 stars, but as previously mentioned by other reviewers, having Matt Stryker & Maria host this Collection was not only an insult to Macho but his many fans. Half the time I couldn't hear or understand what they were saying as they were talking or laughing over the top of one another. Apart from that, if you're a fan, this is an outstanding collection of the one and only ""Macho Man Randy Savage"".",1263340800,,1896,4.579411764705882
3798059,2,B001UDS4CC,"This is a great collection of matches but is lacking a documentary! When I bought this I was looking forward to hearing stories from Savage himself, but Macho doesn't even make an appearance as his current self. Also, the co-host are AWFUL! I wish this were more like the Dusty Rhodes DVD set with Savage himself doing most of the talking.",1260576000,,339,4.573770491803279

3798061,3,B001UDS4CC,"Going to make this short and sweet. The only gripes I have with the dvd set is 1. No documentary, and 2. Lots of rehashed match selections from Wrestlemania and SummerSlam. There are a few rare gems that hit this release with disc three, which one of them being Flair/HBK VS Macho/Bret Hart...what a treat! All in all this is a great set for new fans. For the hardcore fan, I picked it up for the rare gems. 3 stars from me.",1251590400,,424,4.182926829268292

3798063,5,B001UDS4CC,"Well finally all of us Savage fans get half of what we have been craving a DVD set of some of his matches. Some picked are awesome such as Wrestlemania 8's match with Flair and the WCW ones but man there's just not enough! So many of his spectacular matches were left out. Not many of his WCW matches are included which is dissapointing. But we do get a look at his WWE career pretty well. I wanted MACHO MAN VS DOINK,IRS,CRUSH,PAPA SHANGO,REPO MAN,BERZERKER and his bout with Ultimate Warrior at Summerslam as well as his televised WCW matches which i still am craving for. Comon' WWE give us another MACHO SET with these matches!",1251158400,,631,4.495652173913044
3798064,3,B001UDS4CC,"Like most, I was excited about this set. I jumped at the chance to watch one of the GREATEST wrestlers of all time in action. What I came up with are mixed reviews.

The matches are good. The subject matter is captivating, in ring. But outside there's no personal insight. You don't get to know anything about the actual MAN. WWE did the same for the Edge too. You would have thought they learned their lesson.

And then to top it off, we get Matt Striker and what appears to be an outta shape Maria Ka-sumthin on mic. lol I'm sure maybe it was the dress. But she looked like she had a pouch.

The Jack the Snake grudge matches alone make it worthwhile...plus..the extras on the second disk have tons of his interviews before matches!! something other sets leave out...
forget the bad stuff theses guys say about the hosts..i like maria..F em..
If you have even a fleeting interest in hearing macho man's OH YEAH!  again or see the wedding again..yes..its included.. as well as lots more..

This dvd is an insult to all fans of wrestling. Randy Savage is a top 5 wrestler of all time, and gets no respect by the makers of this dvd. Not one interview was done with Randy Savage, or any past or present wrestlers. I am done watching wwe. I am done buying any wwe products. As a life long wrestling fan I will only watch TNA. WWE has turned there back on all there older fans. Since WWF became WWE it has bean a long slow decline in quality of programming and talent. Bring back Bobby the brain Heenan.

3798070,3,B001UDS4CC,The Randy Savage Ultimate Collection DVD gives you a great assortment of matches. I was really shocked to see some of his WCW matches on there that I though would be left out due to his relationship with Vince in the latter part of his career. Overall I enjoyed the DVD but was disappointed to not get enough behind the scenes locker room storylines. They really didn't cover his relationships with Vince to much or the storylines with why he ended up going into the WCW. I am happy that they did release the DVD though it would of been a tragedy if they had left one of the Greatest of all-time without a legacy and backdrop to settle in to the sunset with. Overall a good pickup now all we need is a hall of fame nod for the Madness...OOOOOHHH YEAAAA !,1246924800,2,754,4.27972027972028
3798071,1,B001UDS4CC,"I was very exited when I heard the WWE was finally going to release a Macho Man DVD.  I had the release date on my calendar and bought it the day it came out.  Wow...what a disappointment.  No story at all, no interviews with Randy Savage or any other wrestlers.  The commentary by Maria and Striker is horrible, and in my opinion is an insult.  The set looks like something a high school kid would put together in his basement.  The collection of matches is the only reason I gave my rating one star.  However, I don't buy these DVD's for the matches; I buy them for the documentary of the wrestler's life and the interviews.  For example, Curt Henning, Bret Hart, both were well done.  I would not recommend this unless the buyer is simply looking for a collection of matches.",1246752000,6,778,4.422535211267606

Rating With the hosts/matches- 3 stars/ matches ONLY 13 stars. Just skip to the matches DIG IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's about time the WWF,... excuse me wwe released a dvd of 1 of the 5 greatest wrestlers in not only WWF but wrestling history. It's pathetic how Vinnie Mac chose 2 idiots like matt striker (who the H*ll is he?!) and maria (a blonde in a Hispanic body)to host this. Does Vince hate Macho so bad that he would insult him by having these 2 morons host this! It's a joke,the only reason I bought it was because it does have some hard to find matches, BUT I wish I could get my money back now.

3798073,4,B001UDS4CC,"NOTE: I UPDATED THIS REVIEW IN 2013

Normally I would give an introduction to ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage but there's nothing I can say about him that hasn't already been said about him to the point where WWE didn't go out of their way to promote & acknowledge him yet he's still remembered as one of the biggest names in wrestling history despite that. Now it should be noted that Savage & WWE haven't been on good terms with each other since he left in 1995 & had no participation in this set leading to Matt Striker & Maria hosting this DVD & did get a little annoying at times but showed they were actual fans of both Randy Savage & Elizabeth giving us some background & facts about them throughout the presentation.

Matches Include:
vs. Rick McGraw - This was Randy's debut match here that showcased how Savage just had that natural charisma that separates a wrestler from a superstar as you saw a fan showcase just how much natural heat Savage had within' the first 5 mins.
""Prime Time Wrestling"" July '85

vs. Ricky Steamboat - This was more of a mini-preview of their future classic match at WrestleMania as this was past paced & both men worked well with each other with Randy using various dirty tactics such as using Liz & attacking from either behind to take advantage while Steamboat would come back heavily working over Savage's arm with stretches & strikes along with taking advantage of the environment around the ring.
""Boston Garden"" Dec. '85

vs. WWE Champion Hulk Hogan - Hogan started out & kept his dominance throughout the match with his power advantage causing Savage to keep going to the outside or using Elizabeth to break the momentum before building his own with an aerial assault both in & outside of the ring as the match itself was a short match & nothing special past the historical factor of where Savage's career was at that time as he was main eventing in ""the world's most famous arena"" against the WWE Champion after only being in the company for around 6 months.
""MSG"" Dec. '85

vs. Intercontinental Champion Tito Santana - Tito started out with the advantage causing Savage to keep breaking it using the ropes & going to the outside before Savage was able to gain control with impactful offense like a clotheslines that knocked himself down & a top rope double axe handle half way across the ring while also using dirty tactics that caused Santana to turn up the intensity with a kick out of a pin attempt with caused Savage to land on the referee & heavily working over Savage's leg.  This was great solid wrestling match between two great workers.
""Boston Garden"" Feb. '86
[History Of Intercontinental Championship]

Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Bruno Sammartino - Bruno came in right after Savage causing Savage to use Elizabeth to protect him only for Bruno to still catch Savage & toss him around causing Savage to resort to using the ringside environment & brawling tactics to gain momentum only for Bruno to use Savage's own strategy against him with Savage responding with very desperate actions as this match was pretty short but aggressive during that time.
""Boston Garden"" Jan. '87

Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Ricky Steamboat - Ricky Steamboat had George ""The Animal"" Steele in his corner as Steamboat made it clear from the beginning that he was out for revenge for his injured throat with a blatant choke only for Savage to use a choke right back using the ring ropes as both men traded momentum with Steamboat working over the arm with stretches & his trademark armdrag along with various chops while Savage used his aerial assault both in & outside the ring along with both men with constant pinfall attempts on the other & hitting a ring post at one point in the match with a moment of ""deja vu"" occurring as the match went on.  What hasn't been said about this match that hasn't been said for over 20 years in that was the match that stole the show at WrestleMania III & is still known as one of the greatest of all time to the point where it was an inspiration to so many future talents including Chris Jericho.
WrestleMania III
[History Of Intercontinental Championship; Ricky Steamboat: Life Of A Dragon; True Story Of WrestleMania]

vs. Intercontinental Champion Honky Tonk Man - Honky's remarks of being the ""greatest Intercontinental Champion of all time"" along with his constant advances towards Elizabeth & confrontations with Savage over the past few months lead to this encounter here with Honky having not only Jimmy Hart but Peggie Sue (a ""Sensational"" woman herself) in his corner as well which he used to his advantage on more than one occasion to break Savage's early momentum after Savage took the fight to the outside quickly as Honky continued to keep making advances to Elizabeth only for him to do it one too many times with Savage gaining the advantage back taking the match both in & outside the ring.  This wasn't the wrestling quality that you got on their Saturday Night's Main Event match months earlier but was an entertaining match between both men.
""The Main Event"" Feb. '88

WWE Championship Match vs. Ted Dibiase - This was the finals of the first ever WWE Championship tournament with Dibiase coming into the match with the advantage of not only having wrestled one match less (two) than Savage had to throughout the tournament (three) but also having Andre The Giant in his corner as he made his presence known throughout the match through either physically or just intimidation leading to Elizabeth getting an equalizer in Hulk Hogan as this was one of those matches that was more about setting up future storylines more than anything else but still a good quality match considering how both men had wrestled 3-4 different times throughout the night to the point where wrestlers like the Matt & Jeff Hardy reference this match when talking about being wrestling fans as kids.
WrestleMania IV

WWE Championship/Steel Cage Match vs. Ted Dibiase - Dibiase tried to get the early advantage on Savage jumping him the moment he entered the cage & trying to escape whenever possible while Virgil would prevent Savage from escaping on the outside as both men would trade momentum & be evenly matched throughout the contest from having the same offensive move in mind to execute to trying to escape on opposite ends of the cage while both men felt the effects of the cage with Savage getting some unexpected attempt at help when they couldn't stand Virgil's involvement anymore.  This was a better wrestling match between both men than their previous WrestleMania encounter as it wasn't a bloody violent cage match but still a good quality encounter.
""MSG"" June '88

w/Hulk Hogan vs. Mega Bucks (Ted Dibiase & Andre The Giant) - Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura was the special guest referee for this match with the suspicion throughout the night being if he took a payoff from Dibiase.  The Mega Powers started off working over Dibiase & kept control with quick tags before Andre was able to tag in & use his size to his advantage working over Hogan with chokes while Dibiase kept Hogan down with a chinlock.  Savage was able to get the advantage back over Dibiase only for Andre to take it right back with eventually Andre & Dibiase working over Hogan & Andre at the same time which eventually led to Miss Elizabeth resorting to tactics that caused everybody from the Mega Bucks to Bobby Heenan & Virgil to even Ventura (along with some of the fans) to just stop dead in their tracks.  This was a fun tag match.
SummerSlam '88
[Top 25 Rivalries]

WWE Championship Match vs. Hulk Hogan - ""The Mega Powers Explode"" was the name for this match as Hogan & Savage were friends & tag partners for a year but due to the jealous of Savage over Hogan setup this match with their manager of Elizabeth remaining in a neutral corner as Savage kept going to the outside to break Hogan's momentum & went as far as to put Elizabeth in front of him when Hogan started to chase him on the outside. Hogan went out of his comfort zone against Savage executing moves like a drop toehold into a headlock while Savage also did wrestling himself like countering the hold with a back suplex but also resort to his old tricks of pulling hair & eye poke along causing Hogan to play his game using dirty tactics of his own. They traded momentum throughout the match with Hogan taking as much as he gave like press slamming Savage over the top to the floor while starting to bleed over his eye but Elizabeth kept getting in the way on the outside to the point where the referee had to make a call involving her before Savage would continue to bring the fight doing a top rope double axe handle onto the guardrail along with still taking shortcuts using the ropes & wrist tape to choke Hogan's throat. This was one of the most competitive & aggressive matches during this era of Hogan's run as Savage was able to bring out more of Hogan on a grand stage than others have in the past.
Wrestlemania V
[History Of The WWE Championship; Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology]

w/special guest enforcer James ""Buster"" Douglas vs. WWE Champion Hulk Hogan - This was built as the final encounter between Hogan & Savage over the WWE Championship with the new then-Heavyweight Boxing Champion James ""Buster"" Douglas, who was a last minute replacement for former champion Mike Tyson (he really milked those 15 mins. of fame didn't he?), as the outside enforcer & made his presence known early on stopping both men from attacking their opponent on the outside & physically removing Sherri when she got caught getting interfering in the match as Savage worked over Hogan with his aerial assault both in & outside the ring while Hogan used his power advantage with the action starting to get intense that eventually Douglas had to once again get involved.  The match itself wasn't as great of quality as their previous encounter but was still an entertaining match between both men.
""The Main Event"" Mar. '90

w/Sensational Queen Sherri vs. Dusty Rhodes & Sapphire - The first ever mixed tag match in WrestleMania history with the rules being that only the same sex can wrestle each other throughout the match while Dusty had a suprise in Elizabeth being his manager for the night as it was shown from the start that they weren't going to stick to the rules of the match as Sherri got physical with Dusty on more than one occasion & Savage did put his hands on Sapphire while Sapphire did have some entertaining moments of her own from an airplane spin to showcasing her superior ""size"" advantage against Sherri with even Elizabeth getting physically involved as well.  This match was more about showcasing the entertaining & almost comedic side of everyone involved as this was one of those matches that if you took it for what it was, you'll enjoy it as fun mixed tag match.
WrestleMania VI
[The American Dream: The Dusty Rhodes Story]

Retirement Match vs. Ultimate Warrior - The loser of this match would be forced to retire from active competition while it was noted before the match that Elizabeth was spotted in the audience which was the first time she's been seen since the previous WrestleMania while it was also acknowledged just by his body language alone how important this match was to Warrior as this was the first time he didn't run to the ring but walked as Warrior started out in control only for Savage to quickly gain it back with Sherri getting her shots in whenever possible as both men traded momentum with the action getting more & more intense as time went on with Savage at one point executing more top rope elbow drops than he ever has before while still kicking out of everything Warrior was throwing at him to the point where even Warrior started to question what his destiny truly was.  Without a doubt, Ultimate Warrior's greatest opposition was always Randy Savage & this match is the perfect example as they gave one of the greatest matches (if not THE greatest match) in both men's careers as everyone was on the edge of their seats for over 20 mins. but the most memorable moment here is what happened afterwords that led to my personal favorite WrestleMania moment of all time to this day & one of the most emotional moments in wrestling history to the point where people forgot about the match that only happened minutes earlier & cried tears of joy.
WrestleMania VII
[Self Destruction Of The Ultimate Warrior; True Story Of WrestleMania]

vs. Jake Roberts - Randy's return match after being reinstated with Jake Roberts' snake banned from ringside & Savage having his arm wrapped after being bitten by the snake weeks earlier with the match starting out with a bang as Savage attacked Roberts coming to the ring & was completely dominate with Jake only getting control taking advantage of the referee trying to get control of the action & heavily worked over the bad arm.  This was a short match that was non-stop action & intense from start to finish but this was one of those matches that was more about ""setting up a storyline"" than in-ring quality here as the aftermath was more memorable than the match itself with Roberts actions towards Elizabeth definitely making him one of the most evil villians in history but it should be noted that the most memorable moment of this post-match encounter with Roberts slapping Elizabeth wasn't shown.
Tuesday In Texas '91

vs. WWE Champion Ric Flair - Flair walked into his WrestleMania debut as the WWE Champion but with all the mind games he played with Savage in regards to Elizabeth for weeks, Savage ran to the ring & was intense from the start by attacking Flair all the way from the ring to the outside & down the isleway to the point where Mr. Perfect had to get physically involved dragging Savage away from Flair to ringside allowing Flair to get the advantage working over Savage's back before Savage was able to gain it back & continued the attack making Flair bleed on the outside resulting in Flair using whatever he could with Perfect continuing to get physically involved to the point where Elizabeth made her way to ringside despite officials trying to talk her out of it because she just couldn't take it anymore.  Savage had a reputation for being one of the wildest men in wrestling & this match was classic ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage in that regard as it was wild & non-stop action from start to finish & even after the bell an ending that really made you ask ""Who's REALLY the dirtiest player in the game?""
WrestleMania VIII

WWE Championship Match vs. Shawn Michaels - This was held shortly after WrestleMania with Savage heavily favoring his injured leg as Savage had his current & original manager Elizabeth in his corner while Shawn had Savage's ex-manager Sherri in his as both men traded momentum throughout the contest with both men having the same idea as far as using both a grounded & aerial assault along with using the ringside environment to their advantage along with the women at ringside making their presence known.  This was a rare match back when Shawn Michaels was just a few months into his singles run but showing signs of the ""Showstopper, Icon, Main Event"" Shawn Michaels he would later be known for as they two had natural chemistry here in a very competitive match that went close to 20 mins. & what was also one of the final appearance of Elizabeth in WWE.
""European Rampage"" Apr. '92

w/Bret Hart vs. Ric Flair & Shawn Michaels - A special type of encounter here with the two singles champions teaming against their top contenders as we saw a set of exchanges early before one man was singled out & attempted to be worked over either in the corner by the legal men or with the managers at ringside getting their shots in behind the referee while the other team was showing teamwork through fast tags & working over a part of the body of the opposition before the tensions between all four men lead to the match getting out of control at one point.  This was a good back & forth tag team match between all four men and for those who pay attention to these things, you'll notice that Jim Ross is doing the commentary for this match that happened a year before he actually debuted in WWE.
July '92

vs. WWE Champion Yokozuna - This was relevant in that we didn't know this at that time but this would be Randy Savage's last shot at the WWE Championship along with the fact that Savage was looking for revenge against Yokozuna for his assist in Crush's attack on Randy Savage weeks earlier. Savage started the match out with a bang early by jumping Yokozuna from behind & eventually knocked Yokozuna out of the ring but his massage weight worked against Savage trying to get him back in. Savage was able to break Yokozuna down by constantly coming off the top rope onto Yokozuna but he was able to get the advantage back from Savage with constantly chopping him down. Mr. Fuji attempted to have Yokozuna use the salt bucket against Savage but Savage used it against Yokozuna & was close to winning the championship before Crush saved Yokozuna causing Yoko's two challengers in Bret Hart & Lex Luger also getting involved.
""RAW"" Feb. '94
[RAW: The Beginning - Best Of Seasons 1 & 2]

Lifeguard (Lumberjack) Match vs. Ric Flair - This match started off as a brawl right from the start & didn't let up exchanging eye pokes & chops & punches while the lifeguards on the outside where brawling amongst each other as well with Flair taking advantage of environment send Savage to the outside so the lumberjacks & actually over them to the sandy beach at one point as this was overall a good match with Savage taking some hard bumps & having it's entertaining moments.
WCW Bash At The Beach '95

vs. WCW Champion Ric Flair - Randy Savage played his own set of mind games against Flair coming into the match as he was lead to the ring by an entourage of women (featuring an unnamed Linda Hogan & Debra McMichael) lead by former Horsemen manager Woman who had a strong response to when Flair attempted to relive old times as this match started off mostly on the floor before eventually making it back & staying in the ring with both men exchanging momentum in what was a short & average but entertaining match here memorable for end result.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" Jan. '96

Falls Count Anywhere Match vs. Dallas Page - It was during this time that Savage had joined the New World Order (nWo) and had a very personal feud with DDP leading to this return match months after the original match that left both men injured as this match started off wild & didn't let up as they used whatever they could get their hands on where ever it was from a chair & crutch in the ring to the steel steps at ringside to a waitress tray & flower pot at the V.I.P. picnic area along with any innocent bystander who got in the way or referee trying to take control of the match getting taken out in the process as well resulting in one of the best wild & craziest brawls during this era of WCW.
WCW Great American Bash '97

w/Sid Vicious vs. WCW Champion Kevin Nash & Sting - Randy Savage reinvented himself during this period with a fresh new look & entourage full of women (real life girlfriend Gorgeous George, Madusa, and ""Ms. Madness"" Mona a.k.a. Molly Holly) named ""Team Madness"" while also aligned with Sid Vicious in this unique match where if whoever pins Kevin Nash in this tag match will win the WCW Championship including his partner Sting (but for Sting to be legal in the match, Nash would have to tag out which would then make Nash the illegal man so how could Sting win the title from Nash in the first place?) while Savage's girlfriend Gorgeous George came into the match with a black eye & moved from Savage's corner to Nash's as the match start out on the floor before settling in the ring with Sting & Nash showing teamwork together while Savage & Sid focused on double teaming & while the women at ringside got involved whenever possible resulting in a nice tag match but was only significant for the end result that would end up being the final high point in Savage's in-ring career.
WCW Bash At The Beach '99

DVD extras include tons of past Savage interviews & promos along with various moments like Elizabeth's debut, him being crowned the ""Macho King"", and wedding from SummerSlam '91 which is one of the most (if not THE MOST) classiest moments in the history of the company.  In the end, I'm glad some of stages in Savage's career were completely ignored (his tag team with Zues & WCW feuds with Dungeon Of Doom & 3 Faces Of Fear and let's not mention that rap album) but also I felt so much was left out in favor of unimportant & almost irrelevant filler matches such as his final WWE feud & WrestleMania appearance against Crush, the Saturday Night's Main Event match against Jake Roberts in '92, and the Spring Stampede match vs. DDP feud. Also a few of the bonus interviews got repetitive & could have been left out in favor of some better ones like the time Mean Gene visiting Randy Savage & Elizabeth's home for their ""Randy & Liz"" VHS tape or one of Savage's interview appearances from TNT (the one where Alfred Hayes did an impression of Savage would have been gold here). In the end this a nice retrospective of Randy Savage's career that I would recommend for any Randy Savage fan but I would also recommend ""Best Of Saturday Night's Main Event"" with this as a complimentary piece because that's where you get the better quality matches against some of the wrestlers featured on here such as Honky Tonk Man, Jake Roberts, Ted Dibiase along with other matches against people Andre The Giant, with Hogan vs. Twin Towers, and a high quality encounter against Bret Hart.",1246579200,23,21650,4.641085878360741
3798074,4,B001UDS4CC,"For over 1 decade Randy Savage was the man to watch. In some ways I was expecting more from this 3-disc DVD. The entire episode of 'Macho Man' and his alliance with Zeus is not featured. This was a very entertaining segment of the Macho Man with Zeus vs Hulk Hogan and Brutus ""the Barber' Beefcake. [including a cage match].
 Yes, to everyones surprise Randy Savage decided to choose Ms Elizabeth as his manager, a move even the great Vince McMahon couldn't conjure up. From there his entire life in the WWF/WWE was worth watching!",1246579200,,531,4.589473684210526
3798075,4,B001UDS4CC,"I was in the mood to watch some wrestling and the regular wrestling PPV DVDs were all starting to repeat a lot of the same matches,so I decided to pick up this dvd. What a fun ride to remember how unique the Macho Man character was in the 80s.

Immediately I found Maria's voice to sort of grate on my brain in the opening segment, but I pretty much got used to it. The DVD collection takes the veiwer through the career of Randy Savage starting with his WWE debut. They catch all the highlights along the way and end with one of my favorite Savage matches in WCW.

It was fun to see George ""the Animal"" Steele, ""Million Dollar Man"" Ted DeBiase, Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts, Andre The Giant, Honky Tonk Man and the tons of other 80s and early 90s superstars, including plenty of Hogan, Ultimate Warrior, and Miss Elizabeth.

PROS:Macho Man Randy Savage was an entertainer and all of his matches are fun to watch again. Even people who don't enjoy wrestling get a kick out of watching him perform.

WWE gave a basic cliffs notes of Savages WWE career. Pretty much all the major storylines were there.

The special features were just enough to appreciate Macho Man's mic skills.

Cons: Too short. Just 8 hours WWE? Really? They showed a clip of the match with Jake Roberts where the snake bit Savage, but I wanted to see that one. There was space for some more, even if they only did a featurette where the current WWE SuperStars talked about his impact on their career, the business...something like that.

Overall, WWE did a better job of this one that they did with the Stone Cold Steve Austin garbage they put out. Oh my, that was pathetic.
WWE seemed the genuinely want to pay respect to the career of Savage, the lives of Sherri Martel and Miss Elizabeth. While most of these tribute DVDs need a documentary, especially if they are not going to show the highlight matches (see Stone Cold's DVD), Savages matches speak for themselves and the storylines are discussed by the narrators in a way that will keep fans informed of the activities leading to the action.

4 **** DVD, recommended for fans of the 80s era WWF or just Macho Man fans in general.",1246060800,2,2150,4.494871794871795
3798084,4,B001UDS4CC,"I am one of the few people that can admit that.....the Mr. Perfect dvd SUCKED!!! I mean I didn't wait years and years for just to get a good biography and very few matches that either ended by time limit drawer, him losing by pinfall or matches with a DQ ending. I think he only won 2 or 3 matches on the dvd by pinfall.

  Anyway there's tons of Macho Man matches on his dvd, he didn't win all of the ones that were included but he won a lot of them at least. I especially like how a rare match with Steamboat before WM 3 was included. I also liked how one of his rare matches with HBK were included. They had another that I recently saw on Classics on Demand that was just as good that isn't on the dvd though. The match with him and HBK that was included shows that Savage was actually pretty athletic.

  I wish that Savage actually beat Hogan once buy pinfall though with all the times he put over Hogan. Hogan could have at least laid down for him once. Instead, this dvd showed me how much Hogan actually stole the spotlight from Savage. Savage's first reign, Hogan barely ever gave Savage room to shine as champ. While, Savage's first 2 WCW title wins, Hogan had to come out and celebrate with him to try and steal the spotlight. 2 of Savage's WCW reigns also had him losing the title to Hogan the following night to Hogan. So yeah, I wish Savage beat Hogan just once so match could have been included.

  What actually did happen though that could have been included is a match where he pinned Honky Tonk Man in a Steelcage. I don't like how the WWE includes DQ ending matches on their dvds. But at least, I think they only did it once on this dvd with Savage vs Honky Tonk Man. Actually 2 times, his match with Yokozuna as well. But they did at least pick a match with Yokozuna where he actually did pretty good against him. I remember one where Yokozuna actually destroyed Savage.

  I think very few of his matches were left out. The best that probably was is when he beat Bret Hart on Saturday Night's Mainevent. He also had a rare good match against Jushin Thunder Lyger in Japan that I saw on youtube. But I don't think the WWE has the rights to that. They also left out his match with Crush at WM and his match with Dennis Rodman in WCW. But at least most of his memorable matches were included. It could have been worse, just look at the Mr. Perfect dvd.",1245628800,,2371,4.209713024282561
3798085,3,B001UDS4CC,"I am a huge wrestling fan and when I heard that this DVD was coming out I was thrilled, but once I viewed it I have to say I am extremely disappointed.  I understand Vince has his issues with Randy so to not have a face to face sit down interview is understandable but they could have at least gave us some background info about Savage.  They could have told us about his humble beginning in Tennessee, they could have let Jerry Lawler give us some insight to his time in that territory.  They could have told us stories from people he wrestled with like Hogan, Flair, Steamboat as well as many others who are on Vince's good side.  They could have even told them what to say if Vince is so afraid of someone spilling their guts as to his true feelings towards Savage.  No, that was too easy, they just give us commentary from Matt Striker and Maria of all people who both were just babies when Savage was in his prime so they don't have any knowledge of anything.  If Maria isn't showing off her chest and assets no one wants to see her let along hear her on a Savage DVD.  Striker isn't any better, he isn't an active wrestler anymore, and he truly sucks at commentary so no one wants to see him either.  Maybe that's what Vince wanted all along, but I still say they could have given",1245283200,,1286,4.241803278688525
3798086,1,B001UDS4CC,"Wow...I waited a long time for this Savage DVD and couldn't be more let down. Yes there are a ton of matches but I wanted the Randy Savage story. This gives you absolutley nothing other than matches we can pretty much get anywhere. To have Matt Striker and Maria do the commentary on this DVD is an insult and a joke. This is easily the worst WWF/WWE dvd I have seen. To do this right they needed a sit down with Savage and interview other guys he wrestled with to give you a story, a little behind the scenes details. I won't be happy until they give us a DVD about Savage with some substance.",1244937600,10,594,4.173913043478261
3798087,5,B001UDS4CC,"I'm only through the first disc, but it's enough to recommend.  The opening montage alone was giving me goose bumps.  Savage is treated with respect and admiration by the DVD presentation, as well as the hosts, Striker and Maria.

To see his WWF debut against Rick MacGraw, and hear how much the fans reacted to him... well, some guys just have that ""it"" factor, but you see the hard work he put into his persona pays dividends.

And this is the second cage match I've seen of his where a fan climbs on to the cage to get involved and try to sway the outcome for the hero!  The first was back in the Coliseum Video days, and I believe Savage was the heel and the crowd was determined he would not be the victor.  Not since wrestling's golden age did a performer so incite the fans that cheering wasn't enough, and they felt compelled to take action - in this case, to save Macho from DiBiase and Virgil.

And it's always wonderful to hear Gorilla on commentary, especially paired with Jesse.

I had the good fortune to attend a recent Smackdown taping, and as nuts as the arena went for Jeff Hardy, John Cena, Big Show and Batista, and seethed against Randy Orton and Chris Jericho - when you see Hogan and Savage in that ring, and hear the insanity they spun the crowd into, I don't think the WWE was ever bigger.  What a moment.",1244764800,12,1330,4.352226720647773
3798088,3,B001UDS4CC,"The matches and old clips of the ""Macho Man"" make this DVD worth getting, but the commentary between matches by Matt Striker and Maria is absolutely horrendous.  It's as if Vince McMahon agreed to produce this DVD to shut some people up and make a few bucks, but still stick it to Randy Savage by having these two on commentary.  Striker is alright, just alright, and Maria is flat out awful.  Excavating ""Mean"" Gene Okerlund would have been better than them.

That said, the matches showcase the best of Savage from his WWF debut forward.  I could have done without some of the WCW but you had to put some in here, although he was clearly past his prime by the time he got there.  I also would have LOVED to see some of his stuff from Mid-South and Memphis, which from what I have heard was the best in-ring work of his career.

All in all, however, I'm happy to have it.",1244678400,4,872,4.3128834355828225

I picked it up this morning..put it in m DVD player and thought I'd leave it on as background while I worked but it was completely entertaining throughout and had me laughing and thrilled!
Great matches, great drama and comedy and the bonus interviews alone..my goodness Randy on the couch with the shrink playing word association...(LOL) ...where is there anybody  ANYBODY in todays WWE with a half of this guys personality?

I wasn't as annoyed with the hosts as others are...and yes, current interviews with Randy would be awesome(hopefully) and a real bio would be great but I'm not reviewing what we don't get but what we do get..
and there is a lot of matches and personality. the only serious beef I have is with the WWE DVD authorers...the very fun  promos on disc 3 can't  just be run as a ""Play all"" if you choose the bonus feature which has the 17 or so promos of about 2 minutes each...you have to keep scrolling and pressing play after each one instead of being allowed to just watch them run...a minor irritant which will not reduce the 5 star review..",1244505600,4,1252,4.677272727272728

First thing ,to my suprise, the people hosting the DVD was Matt Striker and Maria. This is a legend and the best WWE could get to host it is these two? Believe me these 2 idiots try their best to make this DVD unwatchable. Matt Stiker constantly does a Macho Man impersonation. I am sure he thinks its hilarious, and it may have been if done once or twice, but its just annoying after a while. Ohh he also flirts with Maria alot. Hilarious! Maria in turn just acts like a stupid ditz the whole DVD. Then in the second DVD Matt calls Maria ""Miss Maria"" what an insult to Miss Elizabeth. Just do yourself a favor skip straight to the matches cause the stupidity exchanged between these two is unbearable. It would have been 5 stars except for the two idiots.",1244505600,4,933,4.131868131868132
3798092,4,B001UDS4CC,"It's hard to believe that over 20 years ago Randy Poffo would be diagnosed with a fatal disease called Macho Madness (Latin root Madnus Masculus) & become one of the most famed handicapped sports entertainers ever! Heights other handicapped stars such as Zach Gowen & Norman The Lunatic would never see the light of day. With the disease setting into effect in the mid 80's talking to dairy creamers & other incoherent banter were staples to his soon to be legendary persona. As the 90's kicked in the madness took a turn for the worse increasing the amount of tassles, hat shaking during interviews, taping his fists with streamers, designs on sunglasses blurring his vision, & the questionable invention of the wrestling boot with laces both on front & back proved the dementia was wearing the Macho Man thin.

Seeking help in the right places Poffo took a break from the hectic world of Pro Wrestling after a unique debate at WrestleMania VII with the Ultimate Warrior. No ladies & gentlemen, it was not suppose to be a match but how man of such thought discussed. After agreeing with the Warrior to take a break from wrestling joining the announce team with Mr. Perfect &, a then struggling commentator, Vince McMahon was a good step in his recovery. Eating normally, less banter with inanimate objects, & chairty work helped the fledging Poffo.

Noticing symptoms of Macho Madness were still evident Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts, battling his own demons at the time, dragged the Randy Poffo back into the depths of his own ""madness."" this strikingly proved beneficial & rewarding as Poffo successfully won the WWF World Championship & mended wounds in his long-time romance with Elizabeth Hulette.

Unfortunately, this Cinderella comeback of Poffo's was not to be for long as eventual divorce, a rap album, & WCW plagued his career.

Now humble, grey, & posting less You Tube videos he is now being honored in this masterful 3-disc DVD set.

If you are a fan of Randy Poffo & have been touched by his battles with ""Macho Madness"" & human beings such as Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat, Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, & countless others, you will certainly be touched by ""Macho Madness: The Randy Savage Ultimate Collection.""

Here you'll find a quick guide to early detection of Macho Madness such as finger wagging, mismatch clothes, & repeating amusing phrases ad nauseum.",1244505600,4,2483,4.855791962174941
3798093,5,B001UDS4CC,"I just watched all 3 DVD's, and I gotta say:  ""WWE, THANK YOU!""  What a FANTASTIC anthology they released, even the opening video tribute to Savage was ""spectacular"" in every sense of the word.

The video/audio quality on his matches from the mid 1980's thru the late 1990's has been well kept and transferred.

While there are some very well know matches (WrestleMania III - VIII) there are some real gems in here too.  Savages' match against HBK from England was a 5 star classic!

Macho's matches against DDP, Flair, Hogan, Jake the Snake & Steamboat were highly entertaining as well.

This leaves only 2 questions:  Will the WWE get the message from us fans about the greatest of all times being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame...  And two, when's the Randy Savage sequel anthology coming out?  Dig it!",1244505600,3,809,4.673758865248227
8343344,5,B001UDS4CC,"For me, Randy Savage is the only guy who is the equal of Ric Flair in regards to mic skills and overall flamboyance.  Where Savage has the edge however is in the way that he made changes to his character at various stages of his career.  I don't know of anyone else who was able to switch between heel and hero so effortlessly.

This 9 hour set is amazing.  From his early matches at famed venues like Madison Square Garden and Boston Garden to his glory days headlining WrestleMania you really get a feel for the arc of his career and just what an outstanding performer he was both in and out of the ring.

For me the best matches were the WrestleMania 8 war with Flair, the Hogan battle from WrestleMania 5, and a match that I had forgotten about against Honky Tonk Man from Saturday Night's Main Event.

But the fact that the matches are amazing make up for the bad hosts. There's lots info and clips of early Wrestlemania matches with Hulkster and Ultimate Warrior. Other wonderful matches and feuds include Jake the Snake, Andre the Giant, Ted DiBiase, Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat, Dusty Rhodes, Ric Flair, Shawn Micheals, Bret ""Hitman"" Hart, Yokozuna, and Diamond Dallas Page. The Wedding Between Miss Elizabeth and Macho is also included. This DVD set was also put out before his death so there really isn't a sad element about Macho Man presented here which i really enjoy. I can't imagine how good this would have been if Macho Man would have been involved with making this. Vince should have paid Macho whatever he wanted and had him host this and it would be one of the greatest DVD wrestling sets ever.
