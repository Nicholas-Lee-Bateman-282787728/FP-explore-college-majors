7859082,1,6304031599,"This was almost as bad as the 1995 event. The US title match between Konnan & Eddie Guerrero was a good solid match but still not enough to save this PPV. The Steven Regal-Fit Finlay match was a great brawl which was ruined by a DQ ending. The Man vs Woman match between Madusa & Col. Robert Parker was crud to the 10th power. the Bootyman(subbing for Johnny B Badd who left to join the WWF)-DDP match was second-rate at best. The Giant-Loch Ness match was pointless and a big letdown. The Chicago Street Fight between the team of Sting & Booker T against The Road Warriors was a third rate ECW ripoff and a bad reminder of the Harlem Heat-Nasty Boys match from the 1995 event. The Tower Of Doom Steel Cage match was nothing more then as The Nostalgia Critic would call it a ""Big Lipped Alligator Moment"". I give this ""PPV"" a 1 out of 10.",1278028800,,838,4.276729559748428
7859083,5,6304031599,"US Title match between Guerrero and Konnan was Awesome. The Regal/
Finlay grudge was just brutal. The Man/woman with Madusa and
Parker was hilarious as was the I quit Wrestling one. The Giant
collision was unbelievable! The Streetfight was the most hardcore
match I've ever seen. The Main Event was Confusing and hard to
make sense of. Why did Flair and Anderson come back if they had
already been  eliminated?",1000425600,,410,4.857142857142857
7859084,3,6304031599,"I am Michael, and I have come to give you fair wrestling tape reviews, that should be the best you read on Amazon.com. This is my first of what will be many reviews, so here we go.  The second match is between Fit Finley and Steven Regal. Surprisingly, it doesn't stink! It is a pretty  damn good hardcore match from the usually softer WCW. Next thing of note is  the streetfight which set a world record for low blows,that stood for 15  minutes. Kevin Sullivan broke the record in the Doomsday match, which is a  very unique concept and is quite excititng, but pales in comparison to  Tony's commentary. ""Luger is obviously a fresh man...he hasn't been  hit with a frying pan!"" The late Jeep Swenson(Bane from ""Batman  & Robin"") is the Ultimate Soloution, if you must know . . .",958262400,,779,4.475177304964539
7859085,5,6304031599,This wrestling video is great. I love the Dooms Day Match with all the wrestlers. It is a 3 story cage match.the price is a little to high but i can afford it.(so can you),950918400,,171,3.914285714285714
