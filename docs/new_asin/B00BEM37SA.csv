The funniest part of this 'movie' was after the biological mom got shot in the leg and then jumped off a ""cliff"" killing herself and the sheriff just turned his head. I laughed soooo loud. Not b/c she killed herself, but b/c the sheriff didn't care, didn't call for an ambulance, didn't do anything. Just left her there, I assume.",1522195200,,498,4.365591397849462

5609432,1,B00BEM37SA,"Heartwarming, if you think that drug addicts or the metally ill should be permanently separated from their children and shot.  Otherwise, this story is a hopelessly cruel farce.

Spoiler Alert:
If you accept that the woman is actually Jordan's mother, and that her story about giving her daughter up for adoption under duress because of unexplained personal problems is true, then it's hard to imagine the writer's motivation for creating such a grotesquely punitive narrative.  First, there is the implication is that her desire to have a relationship with her daughter is inherently criminal.  Then there is the apex of the story, where an incompetent cop shoots her while she is unarmed and holding her 45 pound daughter, rather than step 15 feet to arrest her, fails to provide any medical assistance at all while she bleeds, and turns his back while she jumps off a bridge.  Finally, there is the happy, sunlit ending, where Jordan is reuinted with her adoptive mother, free of any relationship or further knowledge of her birth mother.

What could be the writer's point, other than that people with personal problems deserve to be separated from their children, and everyone would be better off an happy if they were just dead?  One cannot justify the creative choices made in this film on the grounds that they elevate drama, because there is almost none throughout the entirity of the film.  The wooden acting and trivial dialogue leave nothing to wonder about, other than the nature of the relationship between the mother and her daughter.

While there is ample source material for a film to address the complexities of the relationship between troubled parents and their children, this film chooses to use none of it.  The mother merely has ""problems"", the nature of which are never explained.  Neither is the existing relationship explained, nor any justification for the trans-continental move that the adoptive mother makes with Jordan, apparently without the consent of the mother.  And yet, the audience is expected to accept the justification for the killing of the mother, and the assurance that this is for the better.

I'm glad I live in a world that at least occasionally exhibits more compassion than this film.  However, one is left with the distinct impression that the films creators would prefer a world where there is less.",1521244800,3,2349,5.005141388174807
5609433,2,B00BEM37SA,"Sat through it just because. Not well written and does not live up to its billing as horror, a thriller or suspenseful. Sorry, recommend a pass for horror fans.",1521158400,,160,4.551724137931035

5609436,3,B00BEM37SA,"The kids are what made this movie.  The little girl is darling and a good actress, and the 2 brothers are handsome young men;  brave and smart in the movie.  It was implausible how dumb the adults were in this movie though.  The ""sherriff"" was gullible and passive, the kidnapper was an idiot, and the mom was unemotional and passive.  She barely spoke the whole movie. The adults acted like they were sleep walking very dull with no personalities.  Anyway the stars were the kids in the movie. It was an interesting movie and overall I enjoyed it thanks to the child characters.  I did like the music and some of the scenery as well.",1521158400,,634,4.460869565217391
5609456,1,B00BEM37SA,"The kids are cute, they did a great job. The writing is horrible. Who was their audience? Usually movies where the children are smarter and braver than the adults in every possible way are directed to children, but this isn't a children's movie. It has a television movie feel, but it's less realistic. Seriously, the girl plainly states she was upside down in the car, yet no one questions why the ""mom's"" car has no body damage?",1521158400,3,430,4.597402597402597
5609457,1,B00BEM37SA,"There was nothing ""great"" about this movie as some viewers thought.  There was too much going on that had no answers to.  How on earth did the birth mother just ""happen"" to come across Jordan's adoptive mother in the overturned car?  That  was quite a coincidence unless she was following them, which  I doubt..  The child actors were excellent except for the actor playing the 16 year old son of the sheriff.  No way was he only 16...more like 26.  The best thing about this movie was that it lasted only a little over an hour.",1521072000,2,528,4.427083333333333

5609460,4,B00BEM37SA,"Although suspenseful I would not call this a horror movie. To those that say there are unanswered questions, the woman who claims to be Jordan's mother was following Jordan and her mother in her car. I have to assume that she was going to kidnap Jordan because she was her birth mother and wanted her back. When the accident happened, Jordan's birth mother took advantage of the situation and showed up at the police station claiming to be her mother in spite of Jordan's denial. She took her adoptive mother's charm bracelet and possibly Jordan's birth certificate from the car accident to further solidify her claim. It was an interesting movie and I especially liked the bond formed between Jordan and the sheriff's son. The only thing I found implausible is how no one but the sheriff's son took Jordan's claim seriously. A five year old child certainly knows who her mother is!.",1520553600,,883,4.777777777777778
5609461,5,B00BEM37SA,So nice to see a movie with no cuss words. That said I really enjoyed the story. All the people saying in their reviews there are gaps and unanswered questions. To me that is true to life. Sometimes you don't always find out why curtain things happen or why people do what that do. Thought the acting was good by all....including the kids.,1520380800,,339,4.396825396825397
5609462,4,B00BEM37SA,"I enjoyed watching this film.  It kept my attention the entire time.  The plot is that a mother and child are involved in a car accident and the child, Jordan, goes in search for help for her mom who is trapped in the vehicle.  A deranged woman who witnessed the accident pretends she is Jordans mom.  Jordan tells the authorities the woman is not her mom but they don't believe her.  Jordan desperately wants to rescue her real mom by escaping the clutches of the deranged woman.  Its an interesting film and I highly recommend it.",1520294400,4,532,4.489583333333333

(Example: how can a child that doesn't even remotely live in the area give an exact location to another kid.) But this was not a ""blockbuster"" with a huge budget, and still managed to pull a sweet (gag) story. If you are the sentimental type, this movie is for you.

Later, her mother is found in the damaged car and sent to the hospital, only Jordan insists it's not her mother.

5609512,3,B00BEM37SA,"Spoiler alert... Can someone explain whether the woman who abducted the child was her real mother or not? She was following the car before the accident. But was it because she was following the adoptive mother, or just random? Why would a cop even attempt to take a shot at an unarmed woman holding a child? Makes no sense. And then not try to stop her when she commits suicide by jumping over the railing? And why would she want to kill herself? If she indeed was the birth mother, doesn't she have rights in regards to some relationship to the child, despite giving her up for adoption? The whole ending is very confusing, rushed, doesn't answer crucial questions, leaves the viewer wondering, character actions unrealistic. It's an interesting, empathic film, with a frustrating, unfulfilled conclusion. Would have been much more interesting to flush out a confrontation between the adoptive and birth mother, instead of a tired, simplistic, lazy shoot out.

Was she following them? Why wasn't that story line incorporated in the plot so that it made sense? One thing the movie did show is that adults often don't believe children when they are telling the truth. Sometimes children lie, that's true, but if a child kept saying someone wasn't her mother, I would have done a little more digging than this sheriff did.

And the acting! OMG are all these people amateurs? This is one of the few movies I've seen on Amazon recently that didn't have the ""x-ray"" feature where you could look up the actors. I'm betting a lot of them are new or have very few acting credits. The little girl did an excellent job, but there were times when she tried to convey her feelings with a look but at least a word or two would have been better. For example, she could have told the sheriff's son ""thank you"" for finding her mother.

Not a bad movie, but amateurish and not very well written. And the way they achieved the HEA without going through a long, drawn-out court battle was a cheap shot, a shortcut that made the movie even less sophisticated.",1523318400,,1253,4.515418502202643
