8023999,1,B00028LRH0,"This is a DVD conversion of a video tape made back in the 80's. It looks like a bunch of guys from the local amateur theatre have got together to make a low budget action movie.
Personally whenever someone turns up in a supposed training video dressed as a Ninja (even if it is for dramatic effect) I tend to get a little worried about the validity of what's being taught.
Maybe some of the techniques would be useful if you could actually see them clearly but the quality of the video & audio is so poor that I couldn't be bothered trying to struggle through it.
Save your money, I really can't find any redeeming features on this one.",1267660800,3,636,4.308333333333334
