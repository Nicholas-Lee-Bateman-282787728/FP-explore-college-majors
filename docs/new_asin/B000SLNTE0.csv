8205774,5,B000SLNTE0,"This is a great representation of the evolution of the Enz.  You can actually see chronologically how Neil got larger singing parts and became key to influencing the direcion the band went.  ""You can really hear his voice come out in ""Bold as Brass"" and of course, their hit, ""I Got You.""  The reverb in Tim's voice is enchanting, but there's no mistaking Neil's melodic magic and what cinched his place as a hit Top 40 artist.  This is campy vintage video making at its best!  If you are a big ENZ/CH fan, you will love it.",1246752000,,524,4.360824742268041
