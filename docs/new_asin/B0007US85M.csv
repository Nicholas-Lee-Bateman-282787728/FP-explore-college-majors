8052072,1,B0007US85M,"This video is pathetic.
Eric. Von Daniken wrote Chariots of the Gods that was published in 1968. Von Dniken is one of the main figures responsible for popularizing the ""paleo-contact"" and ancient astronauts hypotheses. The ideas put forth in his books are largely rejected by scientists and academics, who categorize his work as pseudo-history and pseudo-archeology.
Von Daniken has an irritating habit of jumping from subject to subject, stating his opinions quickly and with little supporting evidence, and then suddenly switching to another ""mystery"" to start the cycle over again. Even though he makes many compelling points, he never stays on the same subject long enough to fully support his beliefs. Thats also what Gary Armagnac does in the video.
To me, Gary Armagnac and the rest of the Hollow Earth people seem have swallowed Von Danikens pseudo-science propaganda hook, line, and sinker.
With so many REAL problems in the world, why would anyone want to waste time searching for something that does not exist?",1395014400,,1021,5.193939393939394
8052073,4,B0007US85M,"This was a very interesting dvd, but the let down is that the dvd is only 28 minutes long. i was really hoping for atleast an hour or more, but alas no. Again, what little video there is, is extremely interesting but short.",1268265600,3,223,4.209302325581396
8052074,2,B0007US85M,"As a listener to C2C, I was excited about this dvd. However, the fuzzy and cheap looking images were a big disappointment. This dvd could definitely have been done better, but the information was interesting. I had already heard it all before, so there was nothing new to me, but if you don't have a lot of knowledge of the subject already, you might enjoy this dvd. Personally, I think I could spent my money better elsewhere.",1180828800,9,427,4.558441558441558
8052075,5,B0007US85M,"Now for the first time, this film presents the history, mythology & folklore that the earth has a hollow realm, a mystical and physical place, thought to house prehistoric animals, or hide alien beings bent on conquering the earth. The hollow earth theory is represented in the history of many diverse cultures throughout the world. The Avalon of Camelot, the Garden of Eden, Paradise Lost, Shangri-La and Valhalla are names assigned to a mystical and physical place thought by some to house prehistoric animals and plants and by others to hide alien beings bent on conquering the outer Earth. This fascinating video is a compilation of extensive research by the International Society for a the Complete Earth.* DVD * 40 min
