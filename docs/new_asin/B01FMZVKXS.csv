7751218,5,B01FMZVKXS,"I am transgendered myself and this film has the ring of truth. The setting in NYC was tastefully done.  Carla's interaction with her family and her love interest, Sam, were very dynamic and the screen play and acting were superb. I want to watch it again, already.",1480982400,,264,4.617021276595745
7751219,4,B01FMZVKXS,"I'd say this movie was a very accurate depiction of the thoughts, feelings & emotions a transgender has to deal with. I also agree with the other 4&5 star reviews and how they describe this movie. So if you haven't already, be sure to read those reviews.  I would just be repeating what they already said.

 I must say though, that if Joslyn DeFreece  was acting as she busted out crying, it sure looked real to me. Or at least she has experienced that mix of emotions before.
 Only people that have been in that same situation can fully understand that unique bundle of emotions from within your heart.  IMHO.",1480982400,,610,4.5
7751220,5,B01FMZVKXS,good movie,1478736000,,10,4.5
7751221,4,B01FMZVKXS,I'm a post op who has been through things getting to transition and happy in this movie it showed what many have to go through if they are lucky enough to get to bottom surgery. Only a trans person can appreciate this but I'm sure those who are cisgender can learn a lot from this film.,1478563200,,286,4.125

7751226,4,B01FMZVKXS,"Carl(a) is a very decent slice-of-life movie. The struggle of lining up how a trans person sees themself against who they are perceived to be is a story worth telling again and again. In this movie, there were a few plot holes, but I imagine that a lot of it wound up on the cutting room floor for pacing reasons. I applaud all the actors for putting real emotions into their words. If they didn't base it upon something they've been exposed to in real life, it didn't show.

The love interest kind of looks like Quentin Tarantino to me. He's cute, if a bit stiff - just like one might envision a stereotypical programmer. Cinnamon was perfect as a person who wasn't perfect and had changes of heart, based on her experiences. That's perhaps more realistic than any of the other characters in terms of life choices.

Overall, I truly enjoyed seeing a movie that can express the hardships of being trans in a largely ignorant and rigid society. It speaks volumes about how many problems society has when ""one more thing"" is seen as a problem instead of merely being different. Try not to watch this movie as a love story or a film about friendship or family. Instead, try minding what is going on in Carla's head. Some are obvious, but there are subtleties of self-talk that are given in Carla's expressions and actions that express far better what being trans is like.

This movie can be found as Carl[a] if you are looking for it elsewhere, such as imdb.com.

***SPOILER ALERT***

What I don't understand, and I'm having trouble with this, is the fortunes of Carla that are larger than life. She has enough to share, but doesn't. More than enough, really. Were it me, I'd lift up my best friend so that she doesn't have to work the streets. I think that the producers interfered somewhere and decided to multiply Carla's fortune by a factor of five to ten. Surgery doesn't cost anywhere near $400K and they all act like it will go up in a poof if Carla gets the surgery for which she's been planning. If she got every part of her body modified to make her over completely, she may spend upwards of 200K, but not all at once and it would take years. That's still two years+ of a comfortable lifestyle to recover with while she continues to produce designs. If she were to get corrective surgery and have her face softened, that would cost around 100K if she goes to the best clinics, assuming the works, which our beautiful lead obviously doesn't need. She already has breasts that most gals would consider generous, so that's a $10 - 20K savings right there.

They also kept a pimp out of the picture, which seems (I can't believe I'm saying this) unsafe to me. If Cinnamon were to choose that lifestyle and was addicted to sex or drugs, that would better explain her distance from Carla by the end of the movie and offer a reason why Carla didn't even try to help her best friend. Again, I think that the amount awarded was changed and retakes were done to fluff up the amount to something ""worth fighting for"" by the family and would explain why Carla doesn't even ask Cinnamon to move in with her to get her off the streets, which carla obviously believes is a dangerous and unworthy lifestyle.

That shows a lack of understanding about human nature on the production side. People have family fueds over 4K and sometimes less. If the amount were 40K, that would be more in the ballpark of what Carla needs to cover the main surgery she has been considering. 50 - 80K would see her through the months of recuperation before she could start working again. It would also be an amount that would be gone if she were to use it for surgery and fits the dialogue better. No one mentions the 400K except Carla, Cinnamon and Samm.

Cinnamon has a desperate life, living moment to moment and putting herself in danger so that she may one day be herself as well. It may be all ""hooker with a heart of gold"" or perhaps a point of pride to not ask for help. But I would think that as a best friend, she would offer to go with Carla to her surgeries if Carla would help with the expenses. This merits the loss of a star, in my opinion. There are many aspects of the characters that are not explored and would only add a few more minutes to the movie that is a short 1:40:00. Having said that, it is still very much worth watching, as the acting lifts it above all other trans-themed movies I've seen since Boys Don't Cry.

If you ask me, being trans is a form of being intersexed without the physical expression aspect. In our polarized society where two choices seem to be all that people can handle, we are forced to choose a side and stick to it. Male/female. That's it. Why? Even as simplified and therefore limiting as that is, Carla is choosing a side and sticking to it. Her family should applaud her for that much. Hating her for that much is as her grandpa stated; ""not that evolved."" Bigotry stems from being unwilling to imagine yourself in another's shoes and there is certainly no shortage of that where being trans is concerned.

We shouldn't make decisions about people until we know more ourselves. You've met a trans person. You might not even know it. We are small in number, but we blend in because we are just like anyone else in society. On the gender spectrum, there are effeminate women all the way to butch women and butch men all the way to effeminate men. There are even those who could be anywhere on the spectrum with a change of clothes and a change of makeup! Trans people also fall everywhere on that spectrum - even without surgeries. The cover photo of this movie attempts to show Carla at two extremes, though I would argue that she's far more feminine than the photo on the right was hoping to suggest. Darryl Hannah is more masculine-looking than Joslyn DeFreece and Darryl is not trans.

Lastly - and this isn't the chief reason I knocked a star off, but it helped - I felt that the full nudity at the end was gratuitous to the point of exploitation, since ""let's see it"" was the main driving dialogue from the sex cam scenes. It reminded me of Trans*America and The Crying Game. Look, we're not watching movies to see something we can already look up on the internet, okay? It's not edgy, nor is it helpful to understand the dysphoria that trans people feel. There were exceptions in trans movies where I did not feel it was gratuitous, such as in Boys Don't Cry and Boy Meets Girl. Still, there are far too many movies out there where a ""look under the hood"" is done for dramatic or even shocking effect.",1473206400,2,6533,4.449456975772765

8761142,5,B01FMZVKXS,"Carla is a striking representation of the struggles Trans people deal with every day.  Some family still love you, others loathe you.  Difficulties finding work; income earned through the most demeaning means possible.  Relationships established on a preconceived notion that you'll not continue your transition for the sake of their satisfaction.  Being harassed and even assault for being Transgender. Everyone wanting you to be what they want you to be without any concern for who you NEED to be.

It perfectly encapsulates what dysphoria feels like with lines like:
""You are not me.""
""This is not what I am supposed to be.""
""Do you know what it's like to live like this?""
""I've hated this body my whole ..... life.""

This movie is almost painful to watch if you're transgender because it can be triggering.  Scenes of Carla looking at her own reflection are haunting because you know that Actress knows what Gender Dysphoria actually feels like.

My only criticism of this film is that the last shot of the lead actress DIDN'T need to be there.  It was gratuitous and unnecessary.",1505865600,,1084,4.912087912087912

8761145,5,B01FMZVKXS,"I loved this movie! Carlas acting was very moving. The movie showed me a perspective that I don't have experience with and I believe it is an important film for everyone to watch to provide a greater understanding, empathy and compassion for differences, that in this way we all share. Carla brings us into her life to show us her struggles in a cruel unforgiving world and here when we all feel family provides critical support for emotional well being Carla doesn't get this from her own mother of sibling. The struggle with this alone is a challenge and hardship that would be devastating to the well-being of anyone. Thankfully, Carla has her grandfather who has an unwavering commitment to her. SPOILER I don't agree with other reviews that the story should have portrayed Carla in a way to use her inheritance to help her friend. That is a common belief that someone giving financial support will of can save anyone. Carla friend loves a high risk lifestyle and the movie displays the differences between Carla and her friend in too many ways to explain here but Carlas friend has lost herself as opposed to Carla who maintains a commitment to herself. This includes giving up the man she loves as she sees how critical it is to put her emotional health first and this means she MUST be herself and happy with this before appeasing anyone else. Again, this is a truly important film and story we should All see to come away with a greater understanding that judgement about anyone simply based on differences is beyond down ignorant, it is intentionally harmful to others that have caused no one harm with their differences rather Carla is a truly beautiful soul and this film shows we are all better having people like Carla in our world.",1498262400,2,1745,4.687296416938111
