7425151,5,B014VVNYYM,"Beautiful documentary showing what Italian citizens did during WWII to save Jews and other refugees.  Among others was the champion cyclist and national hero, Gino Bartoli, who smuggled fake ID's in the frame of his bicycle to convents and monasteries where people were hidden so they could get out of the country.  What is notable is not only did this man risk his own life to save those of others, but after the war he never spoke of his activities.  Only late in life he told his son and his tombstone bears no mention of his activities either as an athlete of his humanitarian work.

It's a heartwarming tale, that gives you faith in human nature.",1446854400,4,651,4.586206896551724
7425152,5,B014VVNYYM,"I was lucky enough to see a viewing of this at Lehigh University last week.  I never knew such detail of the effects of WWII in Italy.  This is a must-see movie / book for any historian regarding Italy and World War II, as well as those looking for the truth about the struggles of the Jewish people during the war.",1445904000,4,315,4.147540983606557

7425158,4,B014VVNYYM,"Incredible heroism and courage during unimaginably hard times.

The story is amazing, but tthe movie is slow as molasses.  It misses some of the interesting background presented in the book.  Nothing wrong with that, but the movie could've done better.  There's little archival footage; it's mostly memories.

It's not bad; it's just not for everyone - but it should be.",1457913600,2,370,5.1
7425159,5,B014VVNYYM,"The world should see what brave Italians did to save lives of total strangers,  not for fame or profit,  but for compassion for the fellow human being. Italians risked their very lives for Jews,  but has received minimum recognition for their courage....except for a film such as this.",1457395200,6,285,4.895833333333333
7425160,5,B014VVNYYM,"I bought this for my 89 year old Italian mother who had to flee from the Nazis in World War II and she watched it with my 94 year old father whom she met during the war whilst he was serving in Italy. They found the film extremely moving, interesting and thoroughly enjoyed it and are going to let me and my husband borrow it so we can watch it ourselves.",1456963200,4,355,4.014084507042254

8732061,5,B014VVNYYM,"A riveting, inspiring documentary.  There were so many facets to WWII, I find it difficult to comprehend all the terrible things that happened world wide.  This story of WWII in Italy is one piece of the puzzle.  The Catholic Church has been severely criticized in the past  for its role in the war but this film, with actual survivor testimonies, reveals that at least much of the criticism is unfounded.  For teachers/homeschoolers- one benefit of this documentary is that it avoids any graphic footage of the concentration camps/war so that it can be shown to younger children.  Highly recommend to anyone interested in history and/or wants to have faith in humanity restored!",1519344000,,679,5.017857142857143

8732065,5,B014VVNYYM,"This is a tremendous documentary that explains better than anything I have seen or read about why relatively few Jews were deported to their deaths from occupied Italy.

When a man in his nineties is asked why an entire village would risk their lives to harbor Jews he shrugs and responds simply ""they're human beings.""",1500336000,,319,4.8

8732067,5,B014VVNYYM,"Compellingly interesting. Nothing I'd known and certainly not learned during school time years.  The documentary film highlights without romanticizing actual WWII events and the role Mr. Bartali played in the redemption of a persecuted people. Gino Bartali was more than a hero; he was and still is, I am sure to many, an individual who dared to make a difference. To the many who brought the facts of this significant information to light, BRAVO!!!.",1489881600,3,450,5.081081081081081

8732070,5,B014VVNYYM,This a compelling documentary of Italian history that is not well known.  This film is opens ones eyes of the humanity of people who should have been included in textbooks and lectures.  It's refreshing to see how many people saved many Jewish lives at the peril of their own.,1478131200,,276,4.612244897959184
