8431068,3,B004IOWJKS,This Was OK but disappointing for Tiffany Shepis fans for she only has a very small role at the beginning of the film. BOOOO!,1353542400,2,125,4.25
8431069,3,B004IOWJKS,"Featuring: Tiffany Shepis.
So there this web*cam set-up in a house that hosted a mass murder.
Nothing out of the ordinary happens, Well if you're planning a re-enacting the murders from past and Don't mind dying yourself.
The house looked familiar maybe because its amazing,Lots of windows and a unbelievable pool,I think it was used for a Eric Roberts film from Maxim Media.
Great cast besides Shepis,Who leaves a little early,There is Jose Rosete who has made some movies, Alot of scary movies.
Okay,Here is the score card- Beautiful people,wild flash backs, lots of knife wounds.",1301270400,3,582,5.072916666666667
