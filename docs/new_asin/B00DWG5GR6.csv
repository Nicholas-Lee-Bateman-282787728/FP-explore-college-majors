5861702,5,B00DWG5GR6,"I  actually was invited to the BayWalk Muvico Theater here in Saint Petersburg, Florida for a VIP private screening of this movie on April 6, 2012. One of my best friends, Allen Reynolds, was one of the main actors in this movie. The entire movie was great and I am very happy to see that it is now available on DVD. This is definitely a keepsake item for me because Allen is no longer with us. He lost his battle to cancer and I will forever have a keepsake of him. Thanks guys for making this movie available for the public!!! God Bless!!!",1375228800,3,541,4.252427184466019
