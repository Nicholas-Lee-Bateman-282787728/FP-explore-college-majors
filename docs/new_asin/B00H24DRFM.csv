8629169,1,B00H24DRFM,"This is NOT Japanese Reiki.  This is Western Reiki through Takata.  The author doesnt even seem to understand that there is a difference between Western Reiki and Japanese Reiki. Obviously done by someone who JUST got their WESTERN Reiki Master attunements (that is, attunements that come down thru Takata's lineage) and who isn't even aware of Japanese Reiki or the other lineage's in Reiki.

For an absolute beginner who knows nothing about Reiki, the material presented would be okay, except that it isn't presented from the aspect of ""what is Reiki?"" its done as though being presented for a person who already has their attunements. In which case the information presented here is useless in my opinion. Anyone getting attuned should receive better information from their master during the attunement process.

I am really sorry but I cannot recommend this product. The title is completely misleading. The term ""Japanese Reiki"" implies the lineage of Reiki that continued to survive inside Japan and is seperate from the western worlds reiki that descends from Takata. THIS presentation is actually about Takata's reiki, and the people behind it don't even seem aware there is a difference between Japanese Reiki and the reiki they are presenting in this film. OR they do know there is a difference and purposefully mislabelled their film in the hopes of getting a few suckers who are looking for any additional information on Japanese reiki (ya know, suckers like me) to purchase the film.

I have been a Reiki Master for 25+ years and can tell you to skip this one completely. Whatever your level, and whatever your background in Reiki, this film will do nothing but hurt your practice and waste your time and money",1427328000,,1722,4.986062717770035
