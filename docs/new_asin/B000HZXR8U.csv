8493366,4,B000HZXR8U,"This was exactly what I wanted, infact more than what I expected. This package included the first 5 seasons not just the first four.  I thought it only had the first four seasons so I purchased the fifth season separately.  Now I have to spend time and money sending it back.",1246924800,3,275,4.372549019607843
8493367,3,B000HZXR8U,"I love this series and finally ordered all 5 seasons.  I have spent the last 2 weeks watching them in Quantum Leap Bliss.  The show itself is wonderful; however, I had problems with the manufacturing of the DVD's themselves.  Each season had at least one disk with problems (i.e. missing bonus features, episodes that won't play in the ""play all"" mode, but will if you access it from the ""episode index,"" episodes where the show gets hung up, then starts, then gets hung up, then starts, and on and on, and episodes that won't play at all (black screen), etc.  I have just done the ""exchange"" process through Amazon and hope the next set they send me will not have this problem, but that means I'll have to watch 5 seasons again in a short amount of time in order to view them all before the 30-day return period ends (in case the new set has similar problems).  If there were not any problems with the disks, I would have rated this a 5-star.",1181433600,16,943,4.396551724137931
