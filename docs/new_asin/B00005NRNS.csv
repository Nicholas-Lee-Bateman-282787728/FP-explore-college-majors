1636729,2,B00005NRNS,"As an actress Elle makes a great model. She can't act well and this is her worst offering to date. Thank god for the wonderfully precise Stockard Channing and a surprisingly adept Kate Capshaw, both of whom were acting slow circles around the nicegal Ms Macpherson.

And then there's the plot... Elle actually grovellingly pathetically APOLOGISES to her homophobic friend for being gay?! What's next? Apologising for breathing? Shockingly bad.

And then Elle whiningly tells her counsellor (Stockard Channing) that she knows she must think Elle is ""disgusting"".
Could the character be any more spineless and insipid if she tried? And don't talk to me about great lovescenes - Elle lies back, does nothing, zip, zilcho and just lets Kate Capshaw do all the work. Be like kissing your pillow. Your cold wet dull inanimate pillow. *g*
No offence to all the wonderful straight men out there, but this Elle section of the DVD seemed to me to scream ""written by straight guys for straight guys"".

Well I couldn't get past this part in my mind when watching the other parts - sorry. Better writing and a better actress and it might have been exceptional.
PS I love Elle at everything else she does. But she just does nothing here but imitate very pretty wallpaper.",1017532800,5,1257,4.837209302325581
1636730,5,B00005NRNS,This is a must see.  I stumbled upon it in the video store a week ago and haven't been able to return it since; not until I get my copy in the mail!  I've told all my friends about it already.  The entire movie is very well done with a cast of wonderful actresses.  But let's face it; Kate Capshaw and Elle McPherson together is the real topper.  It's one of the most beautiful portrayal of women together (all those between them are great) that I have seen since real life!  A true girlie-girl movie...even if you don't wish to imagine yourself as part of the scene.  :),1008547200,9,571,4.231481481481482
1636731,4,B00005NRNS,"I thoroughly enjoyed this entire movie.  I knock off only one star for what I thought to be an uneven story line in the second half, but that was more than made up for in the suberb acting, especially by the amazing Stockard Channing.  While the entire film was wonderful, my personal favorite section would be the second of the four parts.  It is this section that I related to best and I was struck by the story, the emotion and most of all the actors.  The three women, Rebecca DeMornay, Glenne Headly and Allison Janney, created a believable story that I literally watched three times before moving on to the rest of the film.  Also, in the same story, Irma P. Hall was startlingly wonderful in numerous subtle ways.  But it was Headly and Janney who drew me into the story.  Headly amazed me in countless ways and Janney, well she just blew my mind.  I found myself so emotionally invested in their story. Trust me, if you get this movie only for this part it will be more than worth it!",1007942400,,992,4.382513661202186
1636732,5,B00005NRNS,"I'll be the first to admit that I was unsure if I would be able to sit still long enough to watch this entire movie, but once I got into it, I couldn't turn it off.  I thoroughly enjoyed all of the stories and could relate to each of them.
My girlfriend and I watched it at the urging of another of our friends.  She liked the whole thing, but recommended the first story, which deals with a new lesbian relationship.  Movies about lesbians are traditionally pretty cheesey, so if we stumble onto something good, we tell all of our friends in about 2 seconds.  That's what got us to watch it in the first place.
Turns out that that first story WAS very well done, and accurately portrayed the insecurity many of us feel in our first lesbian relationships, but the rest of the movie was good enough to almost overshadow the tasteful and sexy scenes between Kate Capshaw and Elle McPherson.  Because I have sisters, I totally related to the second story.  Because I have been cheated on, I liked and understood the third story and it's ending.  The fourth story was just a shocker and had such a ""hoo-rah"" ending that I liked it, despite the improbability of it actually happening.
This is good stuff.  If someone recommends it for the lesbian sex alone, watch further, because the whole thing was compelling and relatable.  It's ""If These Walls - I & II"" with a twist.
Five stars!
P.s. I am searching for the artist who sang the ""lonely painter"" song during the first story.  (...)",1006646400,54,1480,4.4888059701492535
1636733,5,B00005NRNS,"In the tradition of films such as How to Make an American Quilt and Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her, A Girl Thing is a beautifully exquisite exploration of the complex nature of women's lives. This film first appealed to me because of its incredible ensemble cast, however the true strength of the film lies in Director Lee Rose's flawless ability to weave each individual woman's story together into a seamless work of art. There is no finite ending and beginning to each woman's individual story, but rather the transition periods leave the audience wondering whether the character ever comes to terms with her control issues, makes up with her family, or leaves her cheating husband.

I don't know how the producer managed to swindle precious investor dollars to get this tripe made into a movie, however there it is!

It was SO BORING and so badly done that after the first 1 hour and 45 minutes I had to turn it off. I don't even want to know how it ended.

The cast line up was great! That's the only 'positive' comment I can make with regards to this movie.

DO NOT watch it. DO NOT hire it. DO NOT believe anybody who thinks it is good.

The two lesbians who made love even did that scene poorly; get this, it was done in the missionary position!

1636748,1,B00005NRNS,"When a friend and I read the back of the DVD at Blockbuster, we were intrigued by the plot, not to mention the incredible cast.  We checked it out with anticipation of a great flick.  I wouldnt even consider what we were feeling as dissapointment; I would describe what we felt as pure regret!  The acting on the part of Elle McPherson was awful!  The character development in this movie was null and void.  I don't understand how other reviewers can say that this was a fabulous movie depicting real life situations about women...I don't know about you but I don't have internal conflict with everyday lesbian experiences, my mother never tricked me in to thinking I was adopted so that I'd get along with my siblings.  I don't know what happened in the other two 'chapters' because we turned this atrocity of a movie off after 2 hours of pure hell.  If you want to make a movie about womens issues, make a movie about our rights, our health issues, being a mother, etc. This was just a poorly written script with a good cast who couldn't even save it from the depths of the hideousness that is called A Girl Thing!",1095206400,5,1116,4.467980295566503
1636749,1,B00005NRNS,"This movie should have won an Oscar.  The acting was superb.  Kate Capshaw and Elle McPherson were so convincing as lesbians.  Their common interest of Jazz and love for clubs composed of all butch lesbians, but them (of course), is compelling drama unfolding before your eyes.  The writing is amazing.  The nonexistant plotline between them had me captivated and wanting more.  Stockard Channing was aspiring as a pyschologist.  She made me feel like I could go to her about any problem and she would solve it in an instant.  The stoned looked in her eyes provided a security unmatched in real life.  The twists and turns provided in The Three Sisters story was like a M Night Shyamalan movie.  I won't say anything in fear of spoiling the ultimate surprise!

All in all I feel like this movie brought me to a state of complete bliss.  With dialogue like two men saying (...) over an over again and heartwarming original characters like Alice or Claire - a nontoken black maid and homophobic turned obsessive stalker jealous needy clingy apologetic friend - I feel like I should give up writing because nothing will top a masterpiece of this caliber.",1095206400,5,1151,4.757575757575758

Elle MacPherson and Kate Capshaw are, well, so beautiful it hurts.
This is an extremely badly written movie. Clearly, no technical assistance was received regarding therapeutic practices or what lesbians do in bed. Capable actresses can only do so much with this abysmal script. At times I cringed, really cringed. This could have been so darn good.
The sad part is, I still liked it and I don't have any significant reasons why. Except:
I can watch Stockard Channing in anything and
I can watch Camryn Manheim in anything and
Elle MacPherson and Kate Capshaw are so beautiful it hurts. I know they could do better in bed if they practiced!",1064102400,15,722,4.784
1636751,3,B00005NRNS,"This mini series is not what you rent for a night in with the girls...or a date.  With a running time of about 4 hours, it's more a crash course in women's issues than a night of entertainment. Each segment does a good job of addressing some trial that comes with womanhood, but at times it feels like the story will never hit its climax.  With such a bright cast, it's surprising that the acting can get quite atrocious.  The film has its purpose and fills its role in addressing the troubles faced by women. Watching it just requires patience and a lot of free time.
Now, if you're thinking of renting for the lesbian content, things get a little brighter. When Elle Macpherson gets into it with another woman, how can you go wrong?  The action is a little canned but there are some scenes worth watching more than once. If you're willing to spring for a rental with just an hour of lesbian content, it's worth watching.  Even if it is with the sound off.

1636752,3,B00005NRNS,"Unfortunately, when you read reviews for this movie the first one you read is by a man. As silly as it sounds, a movie like this couldn't possibly be understood by a man, even the guy most in touch with his feminine side. Women don't need constant action to keep their attention in a movie, nor do we need flushed out male characters to make a movie whole. One has only to read a novel by Steinbeck or Hemingway in which all women are reduced to whores and prostitutes (yet the works are still considered classics), to realize that you don't always need equal time to make a story entertaining. Women understand women, and sometimes just anecdotal stories are enough to be entertaining. Just to watch Stockard Channing stand in front of a camera for two hours would be worth it. The movie is not Citizen Kane, but it isn't trying to be. Its trying to be a slice of every day life amongst a group of very high strung individuals. Okay the Cameron Manheim thing is a little over the top, but you can't discount the whole movie for that and it does in fact give the coffee house manager some of her best comic lines so its worth the suspending of reality for the moment. Male movies have left female characters in the dust for years, why is it men get so upset the minute their characters are relegated to the background? This was a good movie with an interesting concept, but if you are going to watch it with the men in your life you better also rent Lethal Weapon (which took three sequals before they had a real female character by the way...).",1058400000,19,1545,4.386759581881533
1636753,2,B00005NRNS,"I am a big fan of movies whether they are centered on men or women, or both. Good writing is essential anytime. Let me say that if you are interested in viewing films about lesbians, take a look at the heart-warming DESERT HEARTS, directed by Donna Deitch. BOUND is highly regarded by most critics, and GIA, starring Angelie Jolie (before her Lara Croft days), is excellent. THE HOURS which features an award-winning performance by Nicole Kidman should be required watching, and IF THESE WALLS COULD TALK. Both films are about women. Both are exceptional.
But if you insist on watching this over-rated, over-long mess about a psychiatrist (Stockard Channing) who conducts sessions with various women (Elle MacPherson, Glenn Headley, Lynn Whitfield and Camryn Manheim) who have stories to tell, be my guest, but you have been warned.
The most popular segment among (male) viewers is Elle MacPherson's story about her relationship with a bi-sexual woman (Kate Capshaw). I could never understand what either woman saw in each other. The one sexual encounter between them is a flat-out disappointment (watch how Deitch skillfully directs her actresses in DESERT HEARTS). The characters are not allowed to come alive. Maybe the director felt uncomfortable directing a story about homosexuality. Maybe she shouldn't have (chances are this was the key segment that sold the network - this I have no doubt - so they had to leave it in). And as the opening segment it should have blown us away. It didn't.
The sisters segment was really much ado about nothing. I didn't care if they inherited the money or not because I didn't care about any of the sisters - the ending was totally ridiculous.
Lynn Whitfield, Mia Farrow, Linda Hamilton are capable actresses, so what went wrong? What are they doing in this TERRIBLE segment about Whitfield's cheating husband (Scott Bakula at his sniveling best). I won't reveal the 'triangle' that involves Hamilton and Farrow, but don't expect too much.
Finally, Camryn Manheim appears as a demented woman who seeks advise from psychiatrist Channing. Eventually she decides to take her and others hostage in one of the most unbelievably bad hostage segments I have ever seen. Manheim waves a gun in everybody's face for what seems an eternity (what a drag). And when we do get to the 'climax'...!!!
And what of Channing's character? About all we know about her is that she likes two cups of coffee in the morning and has conversations with a wise-cracking coffee store manager. Maybe Channing, who is a fine actress, had other ideas when she signed on for this mess.
The actors are all wasted here. Bakula and in a cameo, Brent Spiner, are reduced to rubble. It is clear A GIRL THING is about women's issues that involve mostly women. Lesbianism, sisters not getting along, cheating husbands (and that secret love triangle) and crackpot patients. Could've had something here, but it wasn't to be.
For those who feel it is about time somebody made a movie about women, think again. Aside from the far superior films I have already mentioned (i.e., far superior to this trash), SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, THE PIANO, MOULIN ROUGE!, CROUCHING TIGER..., and so many other films that feature leading roles for women.
I love these movies because they have substance. Even THE TERMINATOR has a strong female lead (again, Linda Hamilton). Men will be men, and women will be women. This is true. But where there is a LETHAL WEAPON, there is also FRANCES (Jessica Lange) or SOPHIE'S CHOICE (Meryl Streep) to balance it out.
There is indeed a grave lack of good filmmaking today, in films and on TV. This is not news. Bad filmmakers get away with just about anything today. This is exactly what has happened with the director of A GIRL THING. She has tried to get away with passing off A GIRL THING as something with real substance, when all it really is is another attempt at shooting for ratings. A GIRL THING is a fraud. It couldn't be anything else.",1054857600,14,3964,4.865384615384615
