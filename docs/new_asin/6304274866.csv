7866329,5,6304274866,Good film.  Early Stewart Granger.  Maybe not as polished as current movies; but well worth watching.  I enjoyed it a lot.,1379030400,,122,4.714285714285714
7866330,5,6304274866,"What is charm?  Charm is that charisma that draws you to a thing, that almost indescribable something that makes one buoyant and full of joy.  Woman Hater is pure charm.  Despite its rather dubious title, it is a romantic comedy and one of those pictures that they just don't make anymore.  True, the plot or variations thereof have been used countless times in motion pictures; however, this one remains fresh and effervescent.  The script is top-notch and the cast is so good and throws themselves into the proceedings with such lan that one cannot help but feel charmed by the entire affair.  Stewart Granger is a wonderful comedian - with all of his dramatic roles and swashbucklers, one forgets how good and versatile this actor was.  Edwige Feuillere, a great star of the Comedie Francaise, is Granger's leading lady - and what a lady she is!  One is constantly amazed at Feuillere's performance - effortless and truly brilliant.  These people could really act - not just read lines, but act.  Donald Squire as the butler and Jeanne de Casalis as Feuillere's maid are hilarious and make the picture all the more fun!  The directing is by Terence Young (Thunderball, From Russia with Love) and the black and white cinematography is exquisite.  VCI Entertainment has done a good job with the DVD transfer.  This motion picture is too good to miss.  Enjoy the charm - a quality sadly lacking in most pictures of today!",1357430400,8,1421,4.794238683127572
