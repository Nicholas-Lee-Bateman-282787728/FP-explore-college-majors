8762153,1,B01G2I40RC,The problem this DVD is not the quality of the film transfer but the huge fact the the last 10 minutes of this film is not on the DVD. So you in essence have no ending.,1518393600,,168,3.6944444444444446
8762154,4,B01G2I40RC,"For what it's worth (watching it with my cousin with blankets pulled over our heads around 1962) it is terrific.  Everything a 50s b-horror film needs, somewhat cheesy effects, evil Nazis, exploding volcanos and lots of sexy girls who somehow manage tops on this desert island that make their boobs look like Pontiac tail-fins and compliments Jayne Mansfield make-up and hair-dos.  Acting is about what you'd expect.  Still fun.",1514764800,,428,5.173913043478261

8762156,1,B01G2I40RC,"don't buy this crap!!! a good movie ruined
by poor quality disc and it even finishes
before the movie ends in as much that
the disc cuts out with about 5 minutes to go
and the makers must know this so do not get
fleeced as I did!!!",1477353600,,231,3.8333333333333335

8762159,1,B01G2I40RC,whats with this nazi stuff?  no need for it.,1471305600,,44,3.888888888888889
8762160,1,B01G2I40RC,The ending of the movie gets cut off. It wasn't too bad but you don't get to see the ending,1470700800,,91,3.6
8762161,3,B01G2I40RC,i don't care to comment.,1468627200,,24,4.0
8762162,4,B01G2I40RC,This is a great old sci fi movie but the end is cut off.  The actors did a great job with the script although the make-up was a little cheezy.  The end would be happy as most of these 50's flicks were so I don't think much is missing.  If you need the whole movie don't rent it.,1466726400,,278,3.7586206896551726
