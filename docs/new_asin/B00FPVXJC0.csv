8617816,5,B00FPVXJC0,"I've always been in love with this American art school, even when it was completely out of favor. It seems it is getting a partial revival of appreciation. And this artist, Erik Koeppel, may be one of the reasons why. Passionate about the Hudson River style, he set about to learn the secrets of the painters so he could continue the tradition. This how-to-do DVD is the result.
I also love oil painting, but never had the courage to pursue it. When I saw this DVD I immediately bought it, a complete impulse buy. I'm so glad I did. I bought the bare minimum of painting supplies, turned on the dvd and began following the instructions by the artist. It is very well presented, clear and easy to follow. Even a beginner such as myself had little problem understanding his explanations. And yes, it actually shows the techniques for producing a painting in the Hudson River style with its numinous light and atmosphere. Recommended.",1473206400,3,931,4.682926829268292
