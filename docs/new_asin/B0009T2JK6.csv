8196963,4,B0009T2JK6,"Interesting look at a poorly understood part of the great dictator""s life.  One question only partially answered and partially asked;How did The first world War change Hitler""s view of the world. We know of his nationalism ,and hence his disappointment at Germany's loss but what effect did actual combat have on his psyche?",1233187200,2,324,5.113207547169812
8196964,4,B0009T2JK6,"Everyone learns about the rise of Hitler in the 1920s, the seizure of power in Germany in the 1930s and of course the World War of the 1940s... but before all that Hitler served in the trenches of the Western Front having volunteered to serve in a Bavarian regiment. This documentary looks at Hitler's service, is relationships with fellow soldiers (some of whom were Jewish), his continuing efforts as a mediocre artist and how all this might have served to shape him into the tyrannical dictator he later became.

To me, one of the most interesting bits to the story was not any spectacular experience Hitler may have had during his war service but rather how typical it was. Hitler's unit was in the fighting in Flanders but then again so were a hundred thousand other soldiers. He was decorated for bravery under fire, unusual for an NCO but not unheard of. The only real thing that seemed to distinguish Hitler from the typical Landser was that he believed he was wanted back in Austria for evading the draft.

Very well done, although it does seem to wander at times.",1171152000,4,1073,4.6421052631578945
