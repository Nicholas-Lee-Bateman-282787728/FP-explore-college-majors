8487226,5,B005V0OIEI,"I like this video very much.  I like how it is broken down into 3 DVD's each 1 to 1 1/2 hours each and each video is broken down further into 3 chapters.  You can do as little as 30 minutes or as much as 5 1/2 hours for the full 60 mile ride, you get to choose.  I am using a spinner and the tension level on the DVD does not seem to match the terrain so I just watch the grade % and adjust my tension to what I feel it should be.  First hour on DVD 1 is fairly easy then a nice gradual clinb the last 30 minutes.  The second has a harder climb the last hour.  The third DVD is very easy going back down the mountain to the flat lands.  It's great for me to get ready for outdoor cycling in a few months and will keep me in shape through next winter.  Very nice job.  Thanks!",1360627200,,775,3.705521472392638
8487227,5,B005V0OIEI,These are great dvd's to ride to on a nice northwestern PA winter day. Great information with Pauls narative track as well. Makes the time go faster than just sitting there peddling plus the scenery is nice too. Check out the others that he has either here on amazon or his websight at [....],1360195200,,292,4.425925925925926
8487228,5,B005V0OIEI,"Easily compares to your everyday spin class BUT... your on your own bike (if you use a turbo trainer). Brings the feeling of being outdoors inside. Whether you choose to listen to Paul, music or the natural sounds of the road, there's something for everyone. I'm still working my way up and figuring out how to match up the gearing and cadence but there hasn't been one time where I wasn't drenched with sweat and felt like it was a waste. Even if you just go through the motions you'll get a great workout and are bound to learn something if you choose the option to listen to Paul.",1352332800,,583,4.3577981651376145
8487229,5,B005V0OIEI,"I have a number of these cycling videos by Paul Gallas and this one is the best I have found so far.  All my others are on DVD but this one I downloaded in HD from their website.  The better resolution and full 16:9 screen ratio is a great upgrade to the DVD format.  The HD download is in 720p format (as noted on the website) rather than the 1080 that the blu ray lists, but this is of no consequence and I don't even notice the difference while focusing on the training ride.

There were three disks or files to download in the HD format and I initially had some trouble playing the second file on my blu ray player, but it worked fine on my computer and Xbox.  I emailed the support address and Paul himself responded back extremely fast with some tips on how possibly fix the issue, and that the files might just not work on all hardware.  I eventually followed one of the tips and got things working great.

As for the actual video itself, this is by far the most challenging of Paul's videos that I own.  The second disk in particular where you begin the initial climb up the foothills has three sequential climbs that are pretty much all out on the heart rate and RPM scale.  The rest of that disk is pretty challenging as well.  The first and third disks are harder than they look at first, especially if you try to keep up with the heart rate and RPM guidelines.  This HD video is the first of the series that I have where there is a power metric on the dashboard.

What I find especially nice is the full HD picture and the beautiful scenery.  The video was made on a beautiful sunny day which adds to my motivation, especially when I ride early in the morning when it is dark out.  The commentary and discussion on the audio track are good and interesting.  I used to use the the third audio track with only sounds of the ride, but for whatever reason disussion is interesting and distracts me and draws me into the ride and I've knocked off 35 minutes before I even begin to think of looking at the time.

All in all my favorite cycling video thus far.",1351814400,,2065,4.242966751918159
8487230,5,B005V0OIEI,"I just finished working out with Xtreme Calorie Burner Road to Victory, Part 2. I did Part 1 yesterday and will finish with Part 3 tomorrow.

What a workout! My hair was soaking wet when I finished. I kept busy changing the resistance and making sure to keep up the cadence. The beat of the music, even though I don't remember what it sounds like, kept me going. The narrative was informative, especially talking about calorie burning, weight loss plateaus, etc. I knew most of that already, but it was motivating to hear it WHILE I was giving it my best workout effort, kind of reinforcement. Paul focused on how your weight relates to and can affect your biking in certain instances.

UPDATE: I finished Part 3 today. The thing I liked most was how beautiful it was! Paul gave an excellent narrative on being fitted out properly with your bike. Great information. I plan on using my indoors bike, so I just enjoyed the gorgeous scenery on this one.

I'm very proud of myself for sticking with the program I developed for myself, making moderate diet changes, and using the cycling videos for motivation.

I buy just about all of the Cycling Videos Online. Paul is a pleasant biking companion and I enjoy his narrative. I get great results with these. I haven't found anything better to keep me at the level I want and need to work out.

Whatever it takes to get and stay fit. I have built it into my budget. I justify it by the fact that the money I spend on exercise equipment and videos like this is money I won't have to spend on medical care (and clothes) resulting from being out of shape. Besides, it's fun!  :)",1330214400,9,1619,4.4711864406779664
8487231,3,B005V0OIEI,Be aware: this is DVD quality video upscaled to a Blu-ray disc.  Expect it to be blurry on your big screen TV.  Otherwise its a nice ride.,1329350400,,138,4.074074074074074
8487232,5,B005V0OIEI,"I kind of stopped shopping around for cycling videos once I discovered Cycling Videos Online, and Road to Victory is an excellent example of why. It's so much more than just another generic cycling video. It's a motivating and challanging workout; it's a scenic tour of somewhere that I would love to cycle in person; it's a conversation with experienced cycling and fitness instructors; it's an insight into what it would be like to take part in an event like the Road to Victory ride; and it's FUN! I haven't been able to do the whole thing all the way though in one session yet, and I am still working on getting my gear changes to match the video, but I'm definitely seeing (and feeling) improvement. I think that it's a testament to Paul's excellent video production that whether I carefully try to follow the workout or whether I just pedal away, I still enjoy an awesome ride. I'm very happy I chose this DVD set and would definitely recommend it.",1328400000,2,954,4.584795321637427
