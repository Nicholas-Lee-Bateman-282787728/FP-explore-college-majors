4048962,5,B0031DDG9U,"I can guarantee that this will be one of the most powerful, riveting, important films you've ever seen or ever will see. I know people who have told me their lives were literally changed by it. DO NOT be put off by what you may think is the gruesomeness of the subject matter; yes, this compelling tale is horrifying (though not as horrifying as the reality of stoning), but is also surprisingly uplifting and even laced with moments of beauty. I promise that you will not regret owning this film.

As other reviewers have pointed out, the direction by screenwriter/director Cyrus Nowrasteh is outstanding and the acting is Oscar-worthy throughout - and not just by Shohreh Aghdashloo (who plays Soraya's aunt) or Mozhan Marno (Soraya).  Navid Negahban is one of the all-time best cinematic bad guys as Soraya's ruthless husband.

This is based on a true story that took place in the decade or so after the Khomeini revolution in Iran in 1979, but astonishing as it may be to believe, stonings still take place there despite an ostensible 2002 ""moratorium"" - just as they continue to take place in other places where sharia law rules: Nigeria, Somalia, Indonesia, etc.  So this movie is more timely and necessary than ever. Don't miss it.",1267747200,12,1238,4.7981220657277
4048963,5,B0031DDG9U,"""The Stoning of Soraya M."" is a must see film on all levels. This film is stunning and will leave you speechless. Tastefully done, director Cyrus Nowrasteh has made one of the most important films ever to be made about the inequalities in the Middle East.

[...]

Freidoune Sahebjam, a French-Iranian journalist (played in film by Jim Caviezel), wrote The Stoning of Soraya M which is based on his own experience of being forced to stop in a remote Iranian village after his car broke down.  He was one of the first to report on the troubles in the Bah' Faith community in Iran.

While waiting for his broken car to be fixed, Freidoune is approached by Zahra (Shohreh Aghdashloo) who is the aunt of Soraya.  Zahra notices that Freidoune has a tape recorder and asks to speak with him.  The townspeople assure him that she is crazy but he humors her anyway.  Once the recorder is placed on the table, Zahra begins telling her nightmarish story.

Soraya (played by the beautiful Mozhan Marn) is a married mother of three in the film (six in real life).  Needless to say her plate is full.  Her unfaithful husband Ali (Navid Negahban) has fallen for another woman and doesn't want to wait for a timely divorce.  He decides to find the quickest way to get rid of her and cooks up a dishonest scheme to get Soraya convicted of adultery, a crime punishable by death in their twisted culture.

Ali, with the help of others, takes advantage of a vulnerable local mechanic (Ebrahim, played by David Diaan) whose wife has just died.  They offer to pay Soraya to cook for Ebrahim and take care of his children while he is working.  This provided ""legitimate"" grounds to pressure other men to be witnesses for the prosecution.

Based on the descriptive title of the film, we know the outcome, which could lead one to believe that this could easily be another snuff film like The Passion of the Christ.  A short build up with 90 minutes of grotesque torture.  Thanks to the wonderful direction of Cyrus Nowrasteh this is not the case.  While the climactic stoning itself is difficult to watch, it is less than a quarter of the film.

The bulk of the film focused on giving us a sense of the people in this community and the corruption that it breeds.  While keeping the actual stoning to a minimum, the film gives us an important window into an overlooked part of the world.  However uncomfortable it is, we feel as if we are in this town watching the story unfold.  Several people in the audience behind me could be heard uttering passionate reactions throughout.

What makes Soraya M enjoyable (and even the hardest scenes bearable) is that our frustrations are released through Zahra's vocal opposition.  She is an outspoken female opponent to the misogynist culture in which she resides.  At one point she is told, ""muzzles should be for women, not dogs.""  With a reaction like that we know she is saying the right things to upset the right people.  The rest of the women in town are either indoctrinated into believing they are worthless or intimidated into silence.  Without Zahra's presence the film would be torturous to watch.

Interestingly, by doing a simple search on the Internet I was able to find an awkward amount of reviews unfairly criticizing this film as either anti-Iranian propaganda or a manipulative melodrama.  The people who believe this must be the same who subscribe to the idea that ""terrorists are people too.""

Even Roger Ebert blasted the director because the film ends on a positive note that he finds corny.  An important film like this must have some element that is redeeming.  If we all leave feeling awful we will never want to watch the film again (nor recommend it to others).

Instead, Soraya M ends on a positive note and allows us to leave the film scarred but hopeful that people are speaking out about the oppression of women in the Middle East (women's groups where are you?).

Many may not know that while this film is based on a true story, most of the actors are Iranian natives who fled years ago (including the outspoken Shohreh Aghdashloo).  This adds an important element of realism to the film that helps expose a part of the world that is too often referred to or assumed as a peaceful.

This film has not yet had a wide enough release.  Unfortunately, it is harder than it should be to get distribution for a film that is emphatically for the protection of women in a part of the world that leaves them helpless. Coming to DVD on March 9th, ""The Stoning of Soraya M"" is a must see!!",1263427200,8,4525,4.61

4048965,5,B0031DDG9U,"This film was released in a limited number of theaters. That was a shame because it is truely a must see movie. We took our teen daughters to go see this movie because of its true look at the treatment of many women in the middle east.

So often the arguemnet for not going to see a movie such as this one,is that it would be too hard to watch. I find it so strange how many of those same people will go to see movies such as ""The Saw"" or ""Freddy Krueger Movies"",that are horribily violent and goory and have no redemptive value what so ever. When I saw this movie, it was if I was right there with them. This is a movie that you really need to see and take your teens to go see. They need to wake up now, and appreciate the country they live in.

Get this dvd and pass it along to others or like I plan to do, buy an extra copy for someone else.

4048966,5,B0031DDG9U,...the raw power of The Stoning of Soraya M.  Films like these are far and few and I can't stress its importance amidst the current political climate enough.  Get out to your local theater and see the movie.  Get involved with the cause to stop stoning in any corner of the earth where it might still exist.  This is an amazing film with an important message.  Undoubtedly a must-see.,1248998400,21,384,4.507246376811594
4048967,5,B0031DDG9U,"This movie is a must see and one of the best movies I have seen in a long, long time.

The direction is fabulous and makes one feels that he is standing next to the movie characters.  The acting is great, the casting superb, the location and costumes are true.  It was 100% great.

It stirred emotions to my core and my mind raced during the film. The subtlety of the acting made the horrific event all the more compelling.  The actual stoning made me feel as if in the crowd and then, suddenly, I was Soraya.  It was unbelievable.

The acting is superb and real. I think all must see this movie so all will know how extremism can be deadly whether in faith or in laws. The whole world should see this movie.

Too bad it's not showing in mainstream theaters.",1247097600,57,758,4.251748251748252
4048968,5,B0031DDG9U,"This is a very well acted and compelling movie. I've seen videos of real life stonings, and although somewhat cleaned up, this movie gives a realistic face to the act.

The actors do an exceptional job at portraying the characters. Shohreh conveys with a single look, what other actress's take sentences to do. That's a real feat considering I had to read the words in subtitles at the same time!

The movie also shows what a mob mentality really is. What pressure and teaching can compel a son to do to his mother...it shows what strength really is- not being the hero like in most movies, but in what it takes in the real world, to simply speak the truth. A strength that most people don't have.

As cleaned up as it is (the movie does not deal with the underlining condoning of stoning in Islam such Muhammad demanding it in his famous confrontation with the Jews according to Ibn Ishaq, 257 and Bukhari vol 4 book 61, no. 3635- they are his first biographer, and a collector off traditions Muslims themselves consider reliable)-This movie does however show a present day reality that I fear most viewers won't have the strength to really see.

Watch this movie, and then watch how few people are even willing to talk about the subjects it brings up- how many excuses and side steps people will take, rather than confront the reality that this movie throws in your face.

It is one of the few movies that show human nature- the good, the bad and the ugly. From looters, to the ones who confront them. This movie does more in the side plots showing human psychology, than most other movies that try to protray it as a main subject matter.

In short, this is a must see, if nothing else to better understand a dark side of the world.",1246147200,137,1734,4.488888888888889

4049013,4,B0031DDG9U,"The more films that I see the more I empathize with the actors who play unheroic roles. This film is full of such actors and a great deal of the success of this story is due to the ability of these actors to be defiant and dispicable.

The writing takes the story to the inside of the kind of rural, remote place where such events are believable. The frustration of the characters is palpable as they try desperately to keep their minds occupied. Some of them characters have surrendered to the temptation to become petty liars and crooks if only to keep things interesting. Those of less theatrical talent turn their restless thoughts to the minuta of social protocol the most serious of which being that which exists between husband and wife.

The emphasis that is placed on such minuta in the desert culture is mind-boggling. The seriousness with which the men of the Village approach transgression is terrifying.

The violence of THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST was in someways tempered with the natural American familiarity with the story of Christ. I did not have nearly the same advantage while watching THE STORY OF SORAYA M. Even a lone surprising element to the gruesome ordeal was enough to make my brain reboot and as the brain reboots and rebuilds the story that has been witnessed to that point the shock of what is being done and that which proclaims to be true becomes all the more horrifying.

Good filmmaking and excellent acting adds up to an indictment of carefree consciousness, a condition to which the viewing of this film may offer a small degree of atonement. (Four and a half out of five stars)",1506038400,,1614,4.672535211267606
