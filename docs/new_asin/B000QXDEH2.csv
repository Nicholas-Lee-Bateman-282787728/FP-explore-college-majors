2850426,5,B000QXDEH2,"Steven Moffat's writing, combined with James Nesbitt's extraordinary performance has me hiding behind the sofa--but in a good way!

Rather than rehashing all the old films that came before, Moffat took the ""What if..."" route--what if there was a Jekyll/Hyde combo running about *today?*  His answer is a stylish, intelligent, scary, wickedly funny, and just plain wicked storytelling at its best.

The script is lean and mean, every line has a purpose, and one is not just invited, but compelled to try to anticipate what's going to happen next.  This is suspense in its purest form, and there is always a solid payoff.

Certain tastes, raised on fizzy diet soft drinks, are not going to react well to their first pint of Guinness.  As a writer myself, I am blown away by Moffat's handling of the material.

We are not presented with the same old ""don't mess with this stuff"" cautionary tale so much as invited along to truly see the world through Hyde's eyes.  He's a fun fellow, honestly puzzled by some things and the absolute master of others.  He is able to hone life down to its basics and enjoy himself and his carnal nature, yet Nesbitt makes this humorous as well as frightening.  This is the true definition of horror in that we are repelled but at the same time attracted.

Did I mention intelligent scripting?  That also goes for the direction, production, and a very well-picked supporting cast, able to keep up with the perfectly chosen Nesbitt.

His Jekyll (Dr. Jackman) is as solid and interesting as his devilish Hyde.  So far as this fan of classic horror is concerned he now owns the character, and someone dang-well better give him some kind of an award for his outstanding work.  It can't have been easy, yet he makes it look so.  Wow.

There is close attention to detail in this series that one needs multiple watchings to pick out everything.  In-jokes related to Stevenson's original story tickled my literary palate, such as Dr. Jackman's twin boys being named Henry and Edward.  There's more, but I'm not spoiling them for you.

It is by perfectly executed turns funny, sharp, and bloody scary and for this jaded viewer, wholly engaging.  I can't recommend it enough!",1187481600,66,2193,4.76392572944297
2850427,5,B000QXDEH2,"Robert Louis Stevenson's classic story gets a make-over, but it isn't what you'd expect. Lot's of horror, lot's of humor, plenty of over the top performances by James Nesbitt, who totally sells the potentially tired premise. A great supporting cast with equally strong performances. The writing is superb as Hugo Award-winning Steven Moffat who penned some the scariest, best written stories of the new Doctor Who series (The Empty Child, Blink) reworks Stevenson's century-old concept.

Some mild spoilers follow...

Much of the exposition is given in later episodes through flashbacks and some hyper-race memory, but the series opens with  Dr. Tom Jackman, having left his life and family behind in  a desperate attempt to protect them from his ""dark side"" eventually dubbed Mr. Hyde.

Dr. Jackman has left is family and job. ""Blackouts"" lead him to hire a psychiatric nurse, played by Michelle Ryan (the new The Bionic Woman) to oversee his transformations and serving as a mediator between Hyde and Jackman. His wife, Claire played by Gina Bellman (from Coupling), has hired a private detective to find out what's going on with Tom, while he fears Hyde even learning about his family. The private detective Meera Syal (of The Kumars at No 42 a.k.a granny) accidentally reveals Tom's family to Hyde after an unscheduled change takes place. Hyde befriends Claire and the kids as ""Uncle Billy."" Upon his ""return"" Jackman  learns that his family is at risk...other external forces are trying to draw Hyde out for their own covert agendas. While at the zoo with his sons along with shady family friend (played by James Lawson Star Wars' Wedge), Tom converses on his cellphone with his very awake alter-ego and literally enters the lion's den to save his son. A mystery woman, claiming to be his mother, reveals that Tom is a direct descendant of Dr Henry Jekyll, who had no heirs. Dr. Jackman flees, fighting his dark side as he may Hyde is still coming, as are the organization planning to catch him.

Claire eventually learns of Hyde, confronting him demanding her husband back. But there's lots more flashbacks, reveals and twists before she'll get anything of the kind. She may have to learn dark secrets and not only about Tom.

The language and mood of the series is dark and adult, but I'd recommend it, plenty of heart-pumping thriller pacing along with its grislier moments. Nesbitt's transformation into Hyde is subtle from an effects stand-point, but from an acting aspect it is rocking! Gina Bellman's performance is also stand-out good.

The series has many shockingly disturbing moments, even when Hyde isn't on screen (well Nesbitt is) like... A terrifying message in Jackman's own blood on a wall, ""When you sleep, I will eat your children,"" the children locked asphyxiating in steel caskets or just about whenever Jackman's Family is alone with Hyde.

Ultimately, the truth about Jackman is revealed and it is not as unexpected as some of Hyde's actions throughout the climax of the show. Enough questions remain support a second series, hopefully with as much of the ""surviving"" original cast as possible.

Speaking of cast, I was shocked to see that Amazon failed to list the leading actor James Nesbitt on the DVD info, I mean I love Ewan McGreggor's Uncle Wedge, but props to the man playing two roles for Pete's sake!",1186876800,22,3338,4.96415770609319
2850428,1,B000QXDEH2,"What is with the BBC and the blue background? Wire in the Blood, Dr. Who, etc all have this blue tint to their shows. I guess they can't afford but one set. Jekyll is not bad and worth a look  while flipping channels. But the entire story is so cliched as to be painful. The worst part is the mysterious 'organization' and the mysterious secret. And ""Benjamin' is such a stupid over the top villain he's painful to watch. Though it was rather fun to watch him get his in the basement. Nothing new or interesting on the whole.

There are some fun bits scattered throughout so, worth a watch on the Telly for free if there's nothing else on.

Go watch Quatermass or Benny Hill. Or maybe Joe 90. Now that was a good show.",1186790400,3,718,4.264705882352941
2850429,5,B000QXDEH2,This is an excellent update of jekyll and hyde with a detailed view of the psychological battle within the character. I love it,1186790400,5,127,4.565217391304348
2850430,5,B000QXDEH2,"I just started watching the show Jekyll on BBC America and I have to say it's the greatest version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde I have EVER seen.  It's so good I had to start watching more episodes from a British friend because I noticed there were some cuts made to the version that aired on BBC America.  Hyde is like a hyper active and malicious child who enjoys tormenting things and though is capable of love doesn't admit to it or understand it.  In a way his psychotic hyper activity reminds me of Drew Sarich's portrayal of Armand in the Lestat musical.

  Hyde, at one point, saves Dr. Jackman's (Jekyll) children when one of them is put in a lion's cage in a zoo.  He claims he only did it to kill a lion.  Later when Hyde is ranting 'They're not my family they're HIS family' someone threatens Jackman's wife and Hyde asks 'Are you threatening my family?'  and when the man says yes Hyde promptly slits his throat.  You don't know if you should be repulsed or pity this child-like sadist.

  Hyde has a warped sense of humour, listening to Disney show tunes and at one point singing The Lion Sleeps tonight after slaughtering a lion in a zoo.  It's dark. It's funny.  It's suspenseful.

  Now, I don't usually like Jekyll and Hyde stories but this is the best version I have ever seen and James Nesbitt (Jackman and Hyde) does the best duel roles I have ever seen where you really almost think they really are two different men even though the physical changes are subtle compared to most Jekyll and Hyde transformations.

  I love this. I'm hooked.",1186790400,27,1558,4.453900709219858
2850431,5,B000QXDEH2,"When I saw James Nesbit on the front of the Radio Times in a crazed almost Jack Nicholson 'Heeeres Johhnny' pose, I couldn't help thinking this had to be some kind of joke, James Nesbit playing a role as complex and serious as this?, this wasn't 'Cold Feet', but after watching every week, and now currently half way through the series, I have to say I'm impressed, he's been able to put something into the role I didn't think was in him, his dark side has to be said is actually pretty sick and incredibly violent, the fact that he is more powerful and faster than a normal man, with a sadistic nature the like I've never seen on a television programme before, is really a little disturbing, and this makes it all the better, tales of this nature have to capture that.

This isn't just some mad Doctor dabbling with potions tale, so far it is complex and intriguing, and we still don't know the full story with him, I get a distinct impression this is gearing up to go for a 2nd series or perhaps even more.

You might know the writer Steven Moffat for his previous work, the comedy; 'Coupling' and also the gorgeous Gina Bellman from the same show.
Jeykll is the best TV show I've seen since Prison Break ended, and to be honest I look forward to it every week, and and that's saying something, because with the stuff on tv these days I don't get enthusiastic very often.",1183680000,5,1373,4.3803921568627455
2850432,4,B000QXDEH2,"I just saw the first episode and was very impressed. Steven Moffat (Dr. Who) has come up with an interesting take on the old story. Lots of mysteries are set up in the episode which will hopefully be resolved in the next 5 weeks.
James Nesbitt makes an excellent Jackman and Hyde. It's implied in the first episode that he is a descendant of Dr. Jekyll but no one knows quite how. I'm sure this will be looked into in the coming episodes. The evil side is called Hyde as a joke-which he doesn't get. There is a subtle physical difference between the two-something I don't think every actor could pull off. I'm glad they didn't go for the stereotypical 'ape-man' look although there were a few quick glimpses of a more animalistic Hyde. An excellent series, can't wait for the DVD.",1182470400,15,780,4.5

And like Sherlock, the main character is portrayed by an actor who absolutely brings home the performance, with a host of memorable and well-acted supporting characters. My five star rating is unconditional.

I think the only reason more people don't know about it, is because it isn't free on Netflix/Amazon Prime anymore.

At a total runtime of about 5 hours, it's a great show to binge--and most people rewatch it multiple times.",1473984000,,526,4.965909090909091

2850533,1,B000QXDEH2,"I now understand the poor reviews. I originally saw Jekyll on Netflix years ago and loved it. I got this expecting to enjoy it again, however,I returned this version because it is missing the whole 1st half of episode one. Disk one starts just as I remembered it, with Jekyll getting ready for a change to Mr. Hyde, and then, just as the clock strikes 12:00, and Mr. Hyde opens his eyes,  the screen goes black, credits roll, and suddenly we see a car driving up to a house with Jekyll in it. What the heck? The screen has an explanatory caption: ""3 weeks later""  Yes, we actually miss the first 3 weeks. We miss the character development and psychology of Hyde, the motivations of the psychiatric nurse observing and helping him, everything which sets up the rest of the series. No wonder there are poor reviews. It doesn't make any sense without the missing scenes. Skip this version and see the original.",1459036800,,907,4.558282208588957

2850570,4,B000QXDEH2,"James Nesbitt does a wonderful job of making you forget that he's playing two roles.  He makes Hyde seem like a totally different person from Jekyll.  I purchased this to show the first episode to a class of 12th graders who are reading _Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_.  There is some profanity and some questionable situations, but if you're comfortable with that, it's a good modernization of the classic story.",1426636800,,407,4.785714285714286
2850571,2,B000QXDEH2,"Love James Nesbitt, but the show did not work for me. Lost interest at 20 minutes into episode one.

2850610,2,B000QXDEH2,"I gave this about three episodes, but just couldn't get past the cheesy Hyde character to care about the mystery they were trying to build. Perhaps if they had given me more time to like the regular Dr. Jekyll ahead of time it may have interested me, but I had no attachment to his life that made me willing to tolerate the obnoxious Hyde once he began to ""appear"" more frequently.

I also found the attempt at making him scary using the CGI (don't want to give any spoilers) effect when he was up close to people was overdone and highly unscary as a result. Between the lack of interest in the good guy and the annoying persona of the bad, the CGI seemed like it was trying to hard and I ended up rolling my eyes too much to watch it.

I might come back to this on a *very* rainy day, but I'd have to run out of a whole lot of options before that will occur.",1417478400,,859,4.076923076923077

It is not a traditional story, but it covers all the bases that has made this story appeal to readers since its inception. None of this could happen without the incredible job James Nesbitt does when he steps into this role. No make up, no special effects. He is different right before your eyes! What also makes this work is for the first time they include a wife and children. Gina Bellman is the actress who plays his wife, and is equally important to the success of this story. She steps into this role, and takes command. Intriguing and very believable in a way this story has never been done before or since.

I liked this 'sequel' to the original story but I must say the ending is a bit anti-climactic. It's not that bad but still it could have been better.

James Nesbitt seamlessly changed to the dark side of his character to his ""normal"" side and is very believable. Too bad it sounds like they will not make any additional stories. I also really enjoyed the actress from ""Leverage"" that plays the wife. She did a fantastic job!",1399420800,,341,4.516129032258065
2850735,5,B000QXDEH2,I really enjoyed the first 5 episodes and thought there was potential after the introduced and embodied the characters. James Nesbitt did a believable performance as both Dr Japman (Jekyll) and his after ego Hyde. The changes were subtle - like superman and Clark Kent - but the characters were recognizable. I really enjoyed the show but the last episode was poor in every aspect. You could tell they were done with the entire show throughout the last episode. They left enough openings for at least two more seasons but gave up on the premise.,1399420800,,545,4.747368421052632

There is blood, some profanity, and threatening situations but not much actual violence is depicted- it's more often suggested. The clever dialogue is fast paced and subtle with lots of really great one-liners delivered in the offhand, natural way that only the British seem able to pull off. (Americans play to the line too much).

2850771,5,B000QXDEH2,"This is by far and wide the absolute best Jekyll-Hyde creation ever! It keeps you riveted the entire time and constantly wondering what he will do next. Nesbitt's dual role is superbly played right down to body language and subtle facial cues, and the supporting roles are very well played to further enhance the whole experience. The script and screen-play alternately makes you laugh when you least expect it, then totally shocked by the next move, then intrigued by the next revelation. The whole story is taken in a totally new direction that is both fantastic and believable. My only ONLY complaint is that the ending leaves something to be desired. I won't spoil it, but by this point you've already figured out the point made in the end scene. It could've been left out completely without harming the whole at all.
I love a good suspense but I'd long ago given up on any good scare movies. Jekyll takes the cake on both - and keeps you thinking long after besides. Every few months I find myself watching it again. Highly recommended!
Somebody posted a comment about this show being cancelled - I always assumed it was intended as a mini-series. It's darn near perfect just as it is!",1397433600,,1190,4.671428571428572

All in all, the series ending didn't leave me with a lot of unanswered questions.  So, I appreciated they way they wrapped it up .",1393027200,,424,4.371794871794871
2850800,5,B000QXDEH2,"Loved it! I will be honest, I heard about it once and wasn't interested.  Then I watched it on Netflix and the main actor who plays Jekyll is brilliant.  I didn't think the show could pull this off with very little cosmetic change between Hyde and Jekyll, it was really all the actor.

I had to buy this DVD so I could share with my friends that don't have Netflix.  Saddened it's only one season and a short one at that but the BBC really has some incredible writing and doesn't drag on for seasons on a concept (minus Dr Who which rocks!).

This actor was also one of the Dwarves in the Hobbit movies, he needs to be in more movies, brilliant actor!",1392854400,,651,4.217741935483871

At 6 episodes long, it's a miniseries. Don't worry, there's closure at the end. It won't leave you wanting more, not in the traditional cliffhanger sense.
There is foul language, some bloody parts and some sexual situation. It's British after all.
Sometimes it was dark and scary and other times it was light and funny. I think any adult who ever enjoyed the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde would enjoy this.",1390348800,,532,4.610526315789474

I will say however, that it's tightly plotted, funny, sexy, witty, and sometimes downright scary. Some of the twists and turns in this series will leave you laughing, gasping, or both (including an absolutely classic opening in the last episode). I've watched this a number of times and it never gets tired. Simply some of the best TV to ever come out of the UK. Try not to read too many of the reviews that details the plot and watch it fresh.

So I wish I could give this five stars, but I can't, because the answers I was given to the Grand Mysteries, those deep questions about why this is all happening, what is really going on, and what is next--I simply couldn't believe them. This was brilliant character writing, but not brilliant science fiction, which is what the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hide truly is.

Watch this for the characters, the clever lines (""I have to go change""), and the satisfying romance. Forgive the ending. I'll absolutely watch more from Steven Moffat. What? What's that? He's a writer on ""Sherlock""? I guess I already have.",1380844800,,837,4.687074829931973

He would be better suited if he appeared in a clown suit.  ""Bad guys"" doing absolutely stupid things repeatedly.  the list goes on and on.

2851002,5,B000QXDEH2,"This was my first time watching a show that had been produced by the Big British Castle (BBC), and I was quite impressed. There are subtle differences in the way that this show was produced, compared to a typical U.S. show- not necessarily better or worse, just different. There is a tremendous amount of attention given to the details of the program, including the suspenseful music and the excellent pacing of the miniseries. Each episode is essentially a small mystery, tying into the larger story arc of Jekyll and Hyde. Once I started watching, I was hooked, and I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next. This was an interesting, engaging, modern take on the classic tale of Jekyll and Hyde. The way that the core of the classic story was worked into a contemporary setting was effective and intelligent, retaining a hint of its supernatural origins, but also taking the opportunity to explore the duality of man.

What really sets ""Jekyll"" apart, however, is the outstanding performance by James Nesbitt as ""Dr. Jackman"" (Jekyll and Hyde). I had never heard of him before I watched this show, but I can say without reservation that he is one of the most talented actors I have ever had the pleasure of watching. He brings the dual roles of Jekyll and Hyde to life. He is utterly convincing as the dual personalities, transforming from the timid intellectual into the aggressive, confident monster that lives within- with no CGI, makeup, or special effects. He's a skinny guy who looks like he hasn't set foot in a gym in about fifteen years, yet, when he steps into the role of Hyde, he masterfully pulls off the feat of appearing unstoppable and terrifying. How does Nesbitt manage this? I have no idea... He's just that good.",1352246400,,1743,4.752475247524752

2851045,5,B000QXDEH2,"Most BBC scifi shows are campy, under-budgeted, poorly-acted and usually just pure crap. This is the exception.

Ya know how there are some TV series that go on five or more seasons, and you wonder why, because they lack any depth and value? Then, we get one truly awesome series that only runs for one season? This is that one series, and I sooo wish there was a second season.

This show is well-acted, well-produced and has a great story line. The action scenes were awesome, and the lead actor did an amazing job. The show earned multiple awards, if I'm not mistaken.

This is probably one of the best Amazon Prime TV shows available. It's kinda funny to think about. If you click on ""Action and Adventure,"" you get 60+ shows that never should have run past Season 1, then you have ""Dora,"" which I don't really understand... and then you have Jekyll.

If you're looking for an awesome, fun, exciting, mature-audience Amazon Prime TV show, this is the one for you. Unfortunately, they only made one season, so now I'm stuck watching ""Dead Zone"" and ""Legend of the Seeker,"" which are travesties when compared to Jekyll.

Amazon: PLEASE give us better AP streaming TV shows, like Jekyll. We shouldn't be left to watch ""Highlander"" or ""Deep Space Nine"". That's just cruel and unusual punishment. Even Instant Netflix had better TV options, and I didn't think that was possible.

2851047,5,B000QXDEH2,"Tom Jackman (James Nesbitt) has a bit of a problem. On the surface, he seems to have everything he could possibly want--a beautiful wife, Claire (Gina Bellman) who adores him and a set of twin sons that he loves to death. But Tom's problem lies beneath the surface. He's just discovered that someone else is sharing his personal space, and this someone else is more than just a facet of Tom's personality, he's an entity all of his own that happens to also inhabit Tom's body. <lj-cut text=""And he's a psychopath."">

Tom leaves his family, for their own protection, but doesn't offer a reason, and takes a sleazy flat where he installs a chair with a wicked containment system, and a psychiatric nurse, Katherine (Michelle Ryan) to help him keep an eye on things. She helps him keep track of the comings and goings of his alter ego, who is basically an overgrown child as well as devilishly charming. He calls himself Mr. Hyde, after the character in the Robert Louis Stevenson story. Tom sets rules for him, and non-obedience has its consequences, primarily being restrained for long periods of time, which Hyde abhors. He communicates with Hyde by means of a Dictaphone which he always carries with him.

A distraught Claire hires a detective, Miranda, to follow Tom, who reports back that he isn't having an affair, as she feared. But Miranda doesn't tell Claire all that she's found out. Claire confronts Tom, demanding to know what's going on. He traces the photographs back to Miranda and her pregnant partner, Min. He tells her he knows she's been following him, he's seen the big black van. While Miranda admits to her surveillance, she tells him he has other problems--she doesn't own a big black van.

In searching for the truth, Tom begins to wonder if somehow he is related to Stevenson's original Dr. Jekyll, and that maybe the story wasn't the piece of fiction everyone believes it to be. All roads lead to Rome, and what he learns threatens the lives of everyone around him, as a hundred year old plot is uncovered. The lines between good and evil become blurred, and it's hard to tell which side is which, and which side will emerge victorious.

The entirety of Jekyll is six short episodes, which is a travesty. I could have kept watching for a lot longer, I was so intrigued by the characters. But the BBC, in its infinite wisdom, stopped there, for its own reasons. The series was penned by veteran Doctor Who writer Steven Moffat. Quite the pedigree, eh? Interestingly, when David Tennant announced his departure from that long-running series, apparently James Nesbitt was mentioned as a possible replacement, but he declined the role, saying he could not follow in the footsteps of Tennant and Eccleston. But I digress.

This show will pull you in from the beginning, from the first image of the chair in the flat. It'll keep you guessing and speculating and trying to keep ahead of what's going on trying to second-guess the truth. But chances are you'll still be wrong.

James Nesbitt is brilliant as Tom Jackman/Hyde. He plays both roles to perfection, and at times you forget that they aren't two different men. They look different, sound different, move differently and act differently. Hyde is a hedonist, an amoral child who does what he wants, when he wants, and has no interest in the consequences.  He is also quite charming, and fascinating to watch.

At first, I really didn't like Tom's wife Claire, and her poor me I want my husband back brand of sniveling. But as the series progressed, I saw her in a different light, and came to appreciate her as a person. By the end, I saw her as a worthy mate to Tom, and the perfect foil for Mr. Hyde. An interesting side note on the actor who plays Tom's best friend, Peter Syme - he played a pilot in the Star Wars film, and inspired his nephew to go into acting also, and years later he too played in Star Wars films. The nephew's name, by the way, was Ewan McGregor.

The acting is superb, the writing quick-witted and fascinating. There is never a dull moment, especially not when Mr. Hyde is around. It's only six hours long, but it's a fascinating six hours, and a journey I heartily recommend. In the hierarchy of films that deal with the infamous case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, I place this series at the top. If you enjoy this, find the soundtrack to the musical version of Jekyll and Hyde, as sung by Robert Cuccioli. But be warned not to bother with the DVD, for that contains David Hasselhoff in the title role and is to be avoided at all costs because oh my God, he can neither sing nor act. Just saying.

Side note: I find it interesting and sometimes amusing when British actors take on an American accent. I imagine the British feel the same way when Americans attempt theirs.",1330387200,,4770,4.627659574468085

2851049,5,B000QXDEH2,"Wow!

I recently reviewed ""Sherlock"" and gave it five stars, which leaves me in a bit of a dilemma, because if ""Sherlock"" deserves five stars - which it definitely does - then ""Jekyll"" deserves more stars.  The quality in ""Sherlock"" is uneven, with the second episode mediocre, but the quality of ""Jekyll"" never deteriorates as the series progresses.  If anything, it improves.

There's so much to love in this series: the writing, the cinematography, and above all the acting of James Nesbitt. He is superb, playing Dr Jackman (the modern day Dr Jekyll), Hyde, and the original Dr Jekyll.  He is an amazing actor who I had I had not really been aware of before seeing ""Jekyll"", despite his long filmography.

It's tough to review ""Jekyll"" without giving away spoilers, which I don't intend to do.  This series is like peeling an onion.  Each time you think they've taken it about as far as they can, they go deeper into another surprising and unexpected layer of the story, including interweaving with the original Robert Louis Stevenson story.

I wasn't a fan of any of the earlier versions of this story, and am not a fan of horror in general.  They are mostly so unimaginative, but ""Jekyll"" is in a class by itself.  I confess sheepishly that inexplicably I haven't read the original novel.  Now that I've seen this series, I'm definitely going to read it.

In my ""Sherlock"" review, I started off by saying, ""I'm fairly skeptical about adaptions that transplant classic tales into the contemporary world..."".  The same is true of ""Jekyll"", and just like with ""Sherlock"", the adaptation surprisingly works, and works very well.

The non-linear storytelling in the series is fascinating and works quite well.  I'm not usually a big fan of flashbacks and flashforwards - unless well done, they just disrupt the storytelling - but in this case, they are done superbly.

I watched the TV series, not the DVD, so I can't address any issues regarding the DVD.

The next time I'm in the library, I'm going to check out the original Robert Louis Stevenson novel.  I now have an interest in reading it that I never had before.",1325548800,2,2120,4.774725274725275

2851077,5,B000QXDEH2,"Being an intense fan of James Nesbitt in the series ""Murphy's Law"", I readily purchased this BBC miniseries of ""Jekyll"" on two (2) DVDs running 328 minutes with six (6) episodes plus extras.  Nothing prepared me for Nesbitt's outstanding performance in this updated Robert Louis Stevens' ""Dr. Jekyll Mr.  Hyde"" with cell-phones and the latest's technology for Jekyll (he's called Tom Jackman in this 2007 version)and Hyde's use even allowing for Hyde and Jackman (Jekyll) to be in contact with each other via a cell phone--marvelous touch!  Nesbitt playing of both roles is stupendous.  There are times; I thought there were different actors for each role.  Nesbitt even appears different physically in both roles.  His performance is a ""tour de force""; Nesbitt is simply brilliant.

Having read Stephen's novel and having seen many films of' ""Dr. Jekyll Mr.  Hyde"", I was completely ""blown away"" by this 2007 version that is outstandingly written by Steven Moffat and directed by Douglas Mackinnon.  It is at one moment extremely funny (especially Hyde in a very morbid and scary way)and at the next moment very scary.  Hyde is really a most frightening creature.  All of the acting is really tremendous in ""Jekyll"".  I also adored the sub-plot involving a secret organization that is keeping a ""close eye"" on Hyde to see just how he ""works"" and being behind his very creation for the orgznization's benefit-- the organization contains a bunch of very  violent and nasty characters that are willing to do anything to get Hyde including feeding Jackmann's son to wild lions.  I remained very "" glued"" to my TV all through this production.  Be advised that there are some very interesting ""extras"" on the second disc that go ""behind the scenes"" in the making of this film--splendid.",1306540800,2,1781,5.010204081632653

2851079,5,B000QXDEH2,"I'm not the sort of person who rates a show or movie 5 stars easily, but Jekyll has easily earned that and more. The story is both simple and intricate. On the surface it's the story of a modern day Dr. Jekyll who is battling his inner Hyde while trying to figure out who all of the players in his recent drama really are.

There are three complications, however, which make the series brilliant. First, it uses non-linear storytelling, not as a gimmick, but as a tool which gives the viewer the same sort of feeling of disorientation that our fragmented hero suffers. This is extremely effective, and Steven Moffat (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock/dp/B004132HZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Fifth-Series/dp/B003EV6DBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: Fifth Series</a>) is probably one of the only two or three writers working in television who could have pulled this off without it feeling like a stop-motion train wreck.

Second, James Nesbitt (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Murphy-s-Law/dp/B001Y44DKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Murphy's Law</a>) was essential. The primary risk the show takes is in the main character's transformation from Jekyll to Hyde and visa versa. There is almost no physical change (minor makeup work involving darker eyebrows and slightly different hair style are the sum total of the transformational wizardry). Instead, the actor must effect the metamorphosis himself, and metamorphose he does! There is a chill that runs up my spine when I hear Nesbitt's Hyde call his alter-ego ""daddy,"" and the way he manages to bring together playful child, sociopathic killer and lost soul into the role makes it clear that the Nesbitt-Moffat magic is clearly a result of a level of trust that writers rarely have for actors and visa versa!

Third, though the series is called Jekyll, it is actually about Hyde. When the series starts, Jekyll's alter-ego doesn't even have a name. With each episode, however, Hyde comes further into focus. He connects with those around him, even though he is unable to relate to them as Jekyll does, and he begins to develop a sense of purpose beyond the simple self-gratification that he engages in at the beginning of the series. In essence, Jekyll is the story of Hyde's transformation from child to adult.

Sadly, none of this changed the fact that Jekyll's story and continuity were a challenge for casual viewers, and a second season was never made as a result.",1306368000,2,2604,5.703608247422681
2851080,5,B000QXDEH2,"Nesbitt makes the psychopathic Hyde charming in his child-like glee while seeking his own pleasure.  Some comedy, some violence and a thought provoking essay on how well you actually know your friends and co-workers.
Fine casting, great acting even by the 'minor' characters.  Ms Bellman is letter perfect in her delivery especially in her line after striking Hyde the second time with the bottle; spoken like a true wife.
The British attitude, or at least Mr. Moffat's, toward the American 'can do' mindset comes out in the Benjamin characterization; it is a sad comment on our 'special relationship' with our British cousins.

2851081,4,B000QXDEH2,"The most intense, clever, funny take on the Jekyll and Hyde story I've ever seen to date. There were only two things that kept this DVD from being five stars, one was the language. When watched on television the language was edited, on the DVD however the F-word is dropped over and over in the first few episodes, personally I thought they over did it. The second reason for my four rather than five star rating was the ending. While I understand that they planned on making a second season, they never did, so we're left with a cliffhanger. A word of caution, this is not an excited, ""Ooooh I want to see more!!!"" Cliffhanger, it's more of an annoyed, ""What?! You can't end like that!"" Cliffhanger.

Despite those two things this was an amazing mini-series. The acting was top notch, James Nesbitt was supreme as both his Jekyll (Jackman) and Hyde , never has a psychopath been so fun.

After paying for this DVD, having to sit through minute after minute of forced previews (no skipping, no fast forward, no top menu, no ability to do anything but let it play) is just ridiculous.  This isn't a feature film, but an episodic TV series, so unless it is watched in a loooong continual multi-hour session, every time the DVD goes in or out of the player, it is time for an interminable BBC commercial for 'MI-5' and then a long trailer for ""Flight of the Living Dead"" - Really? BBC? Really? Come on, zombies on a plane?  I'd almost rather poke my eyes out than watch crap like this.  If George Romero were a zombie he'd be spinning in his undead grave.

If only Amazon had a way to let a prospective purchaser know that discs are loaded with forced previews and trailers we could stop buying them, and if people stopped buying them, studios would very quickly stop including them.  I know this seems peevish, but it is my disc.  I bought it, I should be able use it how I want to (as long as I don't rebroadcast it or exhibit it).

It was amazing how fast and furious the story unfolded without a letup. There is no taking a break from this six hour treasure, you will never make it. The writer deserves recognition for breathing life into a short story done often in different forms from classic to modern takes on the concept of duality and yet managed to keep the pace fast and frenetic with enough humour to cut the seriousness of the story yet never is the humor overdone or haphazardly thrown in.
  And best of all, though you might guess the whats and whys of Jekylls problem, when the end comes and all is revealed, no matter how much you may have guessed right, you will find out that there is always more things in heaven and earth that will leave your mouth hanging.",1293235200,3,1009,4.419354838709677

2851114,5,B000QXDEH2,"This is a great six hour fantasy film. I enjoyed it so much that I watched all six hour in a single sitting, interupted only for supper. The film captures the viewer's interest and holds it throughout without stop; there is no lag.

The protagonist, Dr. Jackman, discovers that he has another being within him while he is on his honeymoon. This being, played by the same actor with different facial expressions and a changed hairdo, is supposedly thinner and taller. He is stronger. He acts more viciously, or so it seems. However, as the film advances, we are encouraged to ask, what causes the Mr. Hyde personality? How does the behavior of Hyde affect Jackman? Does he have a hangover from all the drinks that Hyde drinks? Can Hyde work it out that Jackman has no aftereffects?

Dr. Jackman hires a psychiatric social worker to help him study his Hyde personality. But is she on his side? Has she become fond of Mr. Hyde? Who is she really working for? Will she help Dr. Jackman?

Dr. Jackman hides his Hyde personality from his wife, but she later discovers it. Will she be able to relate to his Hyde personality? How will Hyde react to her? Will he help her when she is in trouble? Where did she come from? She hires private detectives to shadow Jackman. Do they reveal what they find? will they become involved to help Jackman? How good are they?

We are told that there is a very wealthy group that want to capture Hyde and have been at it for over a hundred years. Why? What are they after? Will Hyde work with them?

We are alo told that the story of Jekyl and Hyde was not fiction. Is Jackman Jekyl? Is he a clone? Is he a descendant of Jekyl?

We are introduced to an old woman who supposedly died more than a decade ago. She says that she is Jackman's mother and that she left Jackman to be raised as a foundling. She also says that Jekyl died as a virgin. How can she be his mother if he is descendant of Jekyl? Why did she leave him? Is she on his side?

These are some of the many questions that are raised by this excellent film.",1287619200,2,2045,4.309895833333333
2851135,4,B000QXDEH2,"James Nesbitt's tour de force acting alone makes this series worth a view, but there is also the amazing performance of Paterson Joseph as a main nemesis of Jekyll, and the spot on Gina Bellman as Jekyll's wife. Speaking of the latter, all of the female roles in this series are very strong - in many ways stronger than all of the male roles - very unusual.

In addition, the script is clever and witty, darkly humorous, but most of the time not so much that it detracts from the suspense and tension which is the show's chief mood. The script also puts some intriguing twists on Robert Louis Stevenson's original story while still retaining its main themes and tensions. In fact, Jekyll was well on its way to becoming one of the best TV programs I've ever seen until the last couple of episodes. No spoilers here, but I was disappointed with some moments in episode 5, which got a bit slap-sticky and a bit full of itself, and I did not like how the series as a whole ended in episode 6. The concluding moments and explanations made no sense, not even within the show's own sci-fi logic, and the very last moment was over the top in a cheap horror movie sort of way. These are serious miscalculations which bring the whole series down a notch from 5 stars to 4.

By the 4th episode it becomes very clear that the writer had lost his focus and it quickly declined into dramatics for the sake of dramatics.  A major contribution to the weaknesses here is the unfortunate miscasting of the actress who plays Tom's wife.

2851143,5,B000QXDEH2,"BBC series are rejuvenating when compared with the standard series we have elsewhere on the Anglo-Saxon or European markets. An old, old tale is completely redesigned to the modern world, more than one century later. No descendents he had that dear Doctor Jekyll since he died a virgin. But Mr. Hyde had a lot of descendents, because he was no virgin indeed, particularly with the maid of the family. And the very classic doppelganger living inside you, me, or anyone is back on track for one more series of adventures. Of course we are no longer in a jingoistic village society when London was a loose network of big villages and New York one big hamlet in America. So the state and private interests that want to take control of the world are tracking, tracing and hunting the descendent, Dr Jackman. One of the two will have to die, Dr Jekyll or Mr. Hyde. One has a family, wife and twin boys, one Jekyll and one Hyde of course. They, the bad ones, both military and mercenary, try to capture Dr Jekyll in order to turn Mr. Hyde into a super - killing? - machine that could be used in some shadowy and dark business. They had tried to clone the man but that never succeeded, so they want the real man. But Mr. Hyde is a monstrous super-person or superman and it takes more than one bullet to kill him. Dr Jackman is weak of course but he is protected by his doppelganger who will try not to share the damage. That idea has often been used in horror literature by Anne Rice, Stephen King, Clive barker, and quite a few more. But here we are slowly, at times too slowly, moving to a dramatic end that has to be de-dramatized if there is to be a sequel one day.  But the best part of this series is not only the creative plot or intrigue, but also the great acting of these TV actors, who are not only TV actors, far from it. That's what is best with BBC programs: they use ""normal"" actors that act ""normally"", that is to say very well, and it is a pleasure to watch the episodes that never become humdrum and habitual. It is a very British syndrome: actors work both and equally well for TV and the cinema, and at times the stage. You can very well see an actor in a series tonight, in a theater in Charring Cross Road on the following night and in some cinema on the third night. And that actor, or actress, will be just as good in the three locales. So, what about the next season since we know now this doppelganger-ism can be carried by women and can be invested in twins? We are longing for the next series of six episodes, let's say ten years later.

WOW!  Jekyll just blew me away! It's such an amazing series!  I ONLY watched it because Moffat wrote it. I really would have passed this by on the tele, since it sounded like some old yawn story which I have seen many, many times.  Imagine my surprise when  I started watching it!  I never saw the actor, James Nesbitt, before (or if I had I didn't recognize him).  What an amazing portrayal of this character. His Hyde was so incredibly creepy!  Moffat is such a talented writer, he has the ability to combine horror, humor, love, and wonder, all in the same story.  He is also beyond clever.  Sometimes too clever, but I love him for it.  This is just such an amazing piece of work here, anyone who enjoys Doctor Who should watch this series, it embodies a lot of the cool stuff that people love from that show into this one.

I read and loved the book, and I don't think this adaption takes anything away from it. My problem with this series is the plot. If this had been a two hour movie it would have been 4 or 5 stars. As a series lasting over 5 hours, the plot was simply too thin. There were at least two episodes where very little happened, and the writer resorted to adding new characters to fill time.

James Nesbitt is instantly engaging as the troubled Dr. Jackman, but he's extraordinary as the cunning and feral Hyde. With a modicum of makeup and  some very precise hairstyling, Nesbitt manages to make Hyde a figure of effortless menace even as he's standing still or casually tossing off a sharp observation.

Gina Bellman plays Jackman's wife Claire and imbues her with a quiet strength as she unravels her husband's baffling life.

This is not your grand daddy's Jekyll and Hyde. The story is tight and fast paced, the core characters sympathetic and believable. You even feel better for the 'Hyde' aspect Dr. Jackson in spite of the fact that he's an uptight academic with almost no personality and the character himself claims to have almost no friends.

2851164,5,B000QXDEH2,"Jekyll is FUN.

It's not so much a modernization of Stevenson's classic The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde as it is a brilliant continuation in modern times. The series, which runs eight episodes, was created and written by Stephen Moffat, who I recognized as the mastermind behind the hilariously raunchy Coupling (the original BBC series, not the wretched American adaptation), but who apparently is a much revered writer on the newer Dr. Who series.

In addition to having awesome talent behind the camera, the series benefits from an outstanding cast, led by James Nesbitt as Dr. Tom Jackman, who may or may not be the descendant of Dr. Henry Jekyll, who has no descendants...it's complicated. Jackman is our man of dual aspect, and communicates with his Hyde via a pocket dictaphone, leading to messages varying from ""Why can't you ever leave me a message about where you parked the car?"" to ""This guy has a knife, but use non-lethal force."" Nesbitt is excellent as both sides of Jackman, and as Hyde he's electric.

Not knowing about Tom's hidden Hyde, his wife suffers through the resulting estrangement, until she too is drawn into his dual life. Gina Bellman, who played the hot airhead Jane on Coupling, is in fine form as a strong, smart, passionate wife and mother, forced to deal with the realization that she's not just Mrs. Jackman, but Mrs. Hyde...and wait till her husband gets home. And what's the deal with their twin sons...?

But this is no horrific domestic drama, it's sheer pulp wonderfulness, as Tom realizes his daily routines -- and secrets -- are under close observation by some shadowy organization with lots of money and lots of power. And they, naturally, are very, very interested in getting their hands on Hyde for their own nefarious purposes.

The resulting story is full of wit, action, humanity, inhumanity, sexiness, brutality, surprise, and most of all HYDE.

As I said earlier, the story lasts just eight episodes, but I was left hungry for more. I enthusiastically recommend the series, which I no doubt will be watching again in the near future.",1233792000,3,2096,4.873595505617978
2851180,5,B000QXDEH2,"This is a wonderful production. Simply to see the acting chops of James Nesbitt as he changes from Jekyll to Hyde makes the series worth viewing.  I think the fact that it has only one writer (James Moffit??) also helps:  there is a tight, dense, literary smartness in the script that is very rare in television dramas, even the more-literary-than-American BBC series.  The writer knows the original book by Stevenson and works Stevenson himself into the script in the most clever and thoughtful ways. The show makes you think about family, genetic engineering, selfhood, madness, violence, love, pain, loss, identity, all kinds of things... while at the same time rivetting you with a smartly suspenseful plot that engages the heart as much as it provokes the brain.

This is flat out brilliant! I see it called a ""re-imagining"" or ""retelling"" of the classic story, but that's not quite right. It's really a sequel set in modern day that expands the classic story and provides wonderful twists. For a fan like me, seeing the Jekyll/Hyde story continued in such a masterful way is a thrill.

2851201,4,B000QXDEH2,"I thought I would give this series a try since it was created by Stephen Moffet who was also responsible for Dr. Who.  I was not disappointed.

This series contains 6 episodes with the first 5 entitled ""Jekyll"" and and last one ""Hyde.""  Each episode runs a little under one hour and the time will fly by as you watch the story unfold.  I will not provide any detailed summaries as that will ruin the beauty of this very innovative show.  This series turned the usual ""Jekyll and Hyde"" story on its head, it's much more then a modern take on the old story.  Modern science combined with big business is a very scary combination.  Is Dr. Jackman a clone of the original Dr. Jackyll?  Who is his real mother?  What triggered Dr. Jackman's transformation into Hyde?  All of these questions are answered and there are some genuine twists that I did not see coming (although you can see the clues looking back).

The lead actor is amazing, we see subtle differences between Jackman and Hyde.  As violent or primative as Hyde acted, I could not help but like him.  Maybe that was just me and I should seek help?  The American heading up the ""Hyde"" task force for the super secret project was a great character.  The fact that it was an englishman playing a  stereotypical american was vastly entertainly.  All of the characters were well acted and I liked that in every subsequent episode, we see a little different side of each character.

The only problem I have with this show is near the end when Dr. Jackman/Hyde 's family is threatened.  No supersonic speed or strength was used when it could have been.  What's up with that?  I understand they used that scene to get the ending they wanted but they could have written this part a wee bit better to match the rest of the series.  I deducted one star for this disappointing section that fell short and dragged on.

Overall, I highly recommend this series for something different and great - how come we don't get to see these kinds of shows here in the States?

I got more than I expected and I found myself instantly wanting the next episode, lucky for me it was there.  ""Jekyll"" tells the story of a modern Jekyll and Hyde"".  James Nesbitt plays the dual roles brillantly, looks like a different person when he switches to Hyde.  He plays the role so well that he was recently nominated for a Golden Globe which is uncommon as it is a British pseudo sci-fi/horror show.  Word of advice with the show, don't take it too seriously.  Most British shows have dry humor and can come across campy, but really are brillantly funny and entertaining!",1198627200,,721,4.542635658914729

2851220,5,B000QXDEH2,"There are very few television events that have come into my life with such ferocious energy and wicked humor as Steven Moffat's modern adaptation of ""Jeckyll.""  James Nesbitt delivers what has to be a tour de force (a phrase I assure you I never use) with his Doctor Jackman good guy tormented by his Hyde id.  The moments of tension and humor compound one upon another making each of the six episodes better than one before.

Frankly, almost from the beginning you are rooting for Mr. Hyde.  Nesbit does the age old trick of basically just ""acting"" his transformation (a different wig and some black contacts seem to be the only prosthetics) and this is the magic of the show.  He is screaming with power simply because he has no conscience to keep him check.  In episode one, when Jackman is attacked by a kid named Billy and transforms into Hyde, we have a presentation of power unequaled in drama.  Jackman (who pleaded into his recorder for minimum necessary force while being within an inch of death) is suddenly Hyde who gives Billy three chances to kill him before pronouncing ""Let me be honest with you, I don't get a lot of pleasure out of killing children ... but I get enough!""

Hugely funny, hugely intelligent, and hugely entertaining; this is the kind of show you simply must watch once.",1196726400,6,1302,4.630434782608695
2851221,5,B000QXDEH2,"""Jekyll"" is not just a modernized retelling of the Stevenson tale, but rather a high-tech sequel. It's based on the premise that a real Jekyll/Hyde had existed and that Stevenson fashioned this reality into his famous work of fiction. Now, Jekyll and Hyde are back in action, but how did such come about? What's the insidious catch? Is this modern-day Dr. Jackman a clone of the original Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde? Is he a decendant? Why is an affluent research company, with American roots, so intent in studying Hyde?

Actor James Nesbitt expertly takes us on this journey, which is ripe with twists and turns. You know you are watching the same actor, but the variance is definitely strong between doctor and ""monster"". Nesbitt's Hyde persona is very strong and kinetic: rather like Batman's Joker/Riddler, ""A Clockwork Orange""'s Alex, with a hardy dash of an X-Men mutant. Whenever Hyde enters a scene, it's hard to divert one's attention.

The six-part mini-series also features a number of attractive women, intriguing flashbacks to the time in which Stevenson wove his yarn, and (as is insinuated above) an underlying ""superheroic"" streak. Regarding the latter, ""Jekyll"" certainly sports a tinge of ""The Incredible Hulk"", but never shamelessly mirrors its television counterpart. Ultimately, it emerges as a fresh take on an old favorite. Jekyll/Hyde fans would be wise to consume it.",1195948800,,1385,5.151111111111111
2851222,5,B000QXDEH2,"The BBC's Jekyll will keep the viewer guessing as to how the legend of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde can be ""reincarnated"" in the current time, but the series makes the viewer a believer. There are so many twists and turns in the story line, one can not miss an episode.  Some episodes are a bit ""bloody"" by American standards, but they are acceptable as long as one is prepared. Some scenes may not be appropriate for young children. The connection to the original story line is inventive.",1195516800,,484,4.5

2851225,5,B000QXDEH2,"when this miniseries came on bbc i briefly watched the first episode and thought it seemed to move too slow and proceeded to miss the next 2 on tv. about 2 weeks later with nothing to watch, i thought what the heck, i'll peek at the last 2 episodes to see if it ended weird and dvr'd those.  well, after much jaw dropping and ""oh my God""s later, i quickly looked to see when they were going to repeat the episodes as i had stupidly skipped a couple of them.  after kicking myself because there were no repeats i checked amazon and there it was.  i do not want to give up any surprises to ruin this for others, so here it goes, my review:  OH MY GOD!

just get past the first episode and it starts to pick up steam.  it was a fantastic reinventing of a much picked over story over the years. mr hyde did not need many physical changes to make you believe he was different from jekyll.  james nesbitt was outstanding and his wife (gina bellman i believe) couldn't have played a better mrs jekyll/hyde.  the 2 were just perfect.  if you weren't laughing at mr. hyde, you were admiring his wife's ballsy attitude upon discovering what she was in the middle of.  it had me biting my nails to see if jeryll was a descendant, a clone or the actual 19th century man himself still breathing somehow.  and i was praying they would answer my questions about those. well it did and added about a half dozen amazing twists to his background i hadn't seen coming.

this set of discs gives you a decisive ending with answers, but also leaves you with a need to say ""ok, what's next for this couple and their twins, because you could have another miniseries with that alone.",1194480000,,1658,4.312903225806451

2851227,5,B000QXDEH2,"This mini-series is well-written, well-paced, well-acted and leaves you wanting a sequel.  James Nesbitt is phenomenal in his portrayal of a modern Jekyll/Hyde.  This is not a re-write of the old story, but a twist that incorporates the old with modern times.  Parts of this will make you jump out of your seat.  Where you should fear the monster, you do not, but he does scare you from time to time.  Many unexpected turns.

2851229,5,B000QXDEH2,"Whether you judge a show by the acting or the storyline, this is by far one of the best shows I have seen in a long time.  James Nesbitt is incredible as the ""two"" main charactors.  The story has many twists and turns right up to the last minute of the last episode.  One of the things that I like about the story is after you watch all 5 episodes, everything is explained making you want to watch it again to see all the things you missed the first time around.  I am not going to give away the story line, it is a ""Dr Jeckyll and Mr Hyde"" type story, but not a re-telling of that story.  It takes place in modern day England and acknowledges that the original J&H story exists, if that makes sense.  If you enjoy BBC series such as Doctor Who (the first season, second season was disappointing)and Hex, then this is as well if not better written.  I hope this was helpful.",1192924800,3,874,4.166666666666667

There are certainly some uneven parts, but overall it is a well written, wonderfully acted reprise of the Robert Louis Stevenson story.  Much of the success rests with James Nesbitt, he performs beautifully in a dual role.  Alternately nerdy and Tom Jones-esque, he seems to be having a wonderful time, and drags you along with him.

The story is quirky, and the rest of the ensemble of actors solidly handle the weird situations they find themselves in.  I found myself waiting impatiently for Sunday night to see what happened next.",1188432000,,687,4.636363636363637

It may only be 8 episodes but its 8 episodes of the best show that I've seen in YEARS!!

It's scary, dramtic, and humorous all within the 45 minutes that we are given. James Nesbitt quickly became one of my favorite actors. His ability to turn into Hyde and back again seemingly with little effort is awesome. He strikes me as a flawless actor and I can not wait to see more.",1188000000,,576,4.142857142857143

8198076,5,B000QXDEH2,"To the reviewer that wrote ""I'd give anything for there to be more episodes"" I have to say me too. Part of it has to do with J. Nesbitt, who is virtually unknown over here in the US. And here, my gosh- his ability to project the grotesque AND 'comical' malice inherant in Mr. Hyde is just about the most amazing bit of acting I've ever seen. Mesmerizing, terrifying, astonishingly 'convincing'. That alone would be worth the price of admission. Add to that a brilliant script and supporting cast, particularly the good doctor's wife, who was cast perfectly and who is so vital to the story-line. Believe me when I say you can believe the reviews who can't say enough about how good this brief series is, and was. And to the geniuses at the BBC who decided it didn't merit a second season, I gotta say- What the hell were you thinking? What a missed opportunity to continue some of the greatest and most entertaining television ever.

8198082,5,B000QXDEH2,"The title of my review isn't an exaggeration.  This show does as much as you can with the concept of Jekyll and Hyde.  In fact, I'm not sure I could think of many ways to improve this production.

I watched this show a few years ago.  I happened to walk into the room, while a friend was just starting it.  I fell in love with it right away.  Recently, I wanted to show it to another friend.  I remembered how great it was and decided to buy it.  He took one look at the cover and started to judge it.  I told him to trust me.  After the first episode, he was hooked, just as I had been when I watched it.  We blew through all six episodes over the course of a day, or two.  Later, my friend told another person about it.  The same thing happened.  I let my friend borrow the DVD and the new guy was blown away.  He had to leave, but was really torn about it.  He really wanted to keep watching!

I've seen enough reviews to know that nearly any show/movie, with lots of reviews, is going to have a few single-star reviews.  Though something may be great, these reviews are going to come from people whose tastes I'll never understand.  Everyone's entitled to their opinion, and the world is so big that we can be quite vast in our differences.  How else can you explain someone giving ""The Shawshank Redemption"" one star?

To me, the quality of this show rivals that of ""The Shawshank Redemption"".  It's true that the stories are nothing alike.  However, I can honestly say that I enjoy watching them about the same.

I won't give anything away.  I'll only say that it's extremely well-written and well-acted.  It also has very fitting music.  It's too bad that I haven't been able to find a score for this show.

The storytellers capitalize on a form largely forgotten in the states, that of a story told in handful of one hour installments, in this case seven in all. The story excells in this form never having to reach for unworthy material to pad out a season, never having to worry about making a premise run farther than the premise can comfortably run. Every element of the production is successful but Nesbit as the demon doctor is what catalyzes the reaction.

Watch this series.

Hoard this series greedily.
