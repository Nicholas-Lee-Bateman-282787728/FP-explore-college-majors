8169980,5,B000MM0LDC,"I do this with my 9 year old. She just started boxing and when she saw Laila in the ring, she really started enjoying it. Her coach told me ""this girl is gonna be wicked when she gets older.""",1353801600,,191,3.923076923076923
8169981,2,B000MM0LDC,"Very short video, I use it as a warm up. For two champion fighters they're not very enthusiastic on the video.
Good warmup...that's about it.",1311984000,2,141,4.68
8169982,5,B000MM0LDC,"I was looking for a good cardio workout and this was it.  When I
finished I was sweating. I also learned the different boxing moves.",1282521600,3,132,4.28
8169983,3,B000MM0LDC,"I was disappointed in both of these dvd's.  ( I purchased the 2 pack beginner and the advanced)  Had it been anyone else I might have been less disappointed but even for a beginner workout expected a more intense workout for these two.

Sugar Ray rarely says a word and Laila and most of the crew do nothing to motivate you.  There is one girl in the back that does appear to be putting forth some effort so I tried to focus on her.

I was so shocked I took the DVD to work to show a co-worker.  We both had the same thought when we saw the box - that Laila looks fantasic on the cover and it must be a great workout, but even my co-worker who never works out had to laugh.  Her comment was that Layla does not get that body from this workout.

This would be great for someone who is very sedentary that wants to start working out.  It's very easy to follow and nothing too strenuous, but you can burn some calories.",1221955200,11,916,4.072625698324022
8169984,4,B000MM0LDC,"I would call myself an intermediate to advance exerciser.  While I still have some weight to lose I've lost 30+ lbs using exercise DVDS.  What I liked about this is, it is just as challenging as you make it.  It definitely can serve as a beginner DVD (it does have a section that shows you all the moves slowly so you can be familiar with them prior to the workout) but if you put more into it, it can go beyond.  I love the punches which is why I thought I'd like this but the biggest suprise was the AB sequence, I didn't think on a beginner workout it would be that intense.  True my abs were sore so that might have played a part but I thought the AB section was definitely solid. I enjoyed my workout and worked up a good sweat.  I haven't tried the Heavyweight workout yet but I'm thinking it might be a little faster paced which I'm sure I'll love too.  This is definitely a workout DVD worth checking out.",1179273600,41,913,4.153409090909091
