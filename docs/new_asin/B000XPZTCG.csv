8229187,2,B000XPZTCG,"As a German native, I bought this Dvd for my class, this is my 3rd German DvD and again not a good one! The sound effect is so bad, you can't hear the person talking but the backnoise is super loud! Also the top sights in cities are swans, my class got good laugh out of it. I've been to almost all cities in this DvD and there is more than 3 seconds of city and 5minutes of swans. Really bad- I wish I could get my money back!
I only give 2 stars, since is shows more than only munich, octoberfest and the hofbrauhaus!",1240358400,4,519,3.9523809523809526
