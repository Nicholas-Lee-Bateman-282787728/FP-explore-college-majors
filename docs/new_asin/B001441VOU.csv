8254215,5,B001441VOU,"This filmed concert re-imagines the songs (mostly) from the ""Jet Propelled Photograph"" era Soft Machine played by Daevid Allen and his University of Errors. The psychedelic pop songs some of us are familiar with from the 1967 Giorgio Gomelsky demos are given a very RAWK sound with an overlay of Gong glissando. Septuagenarian Allen looks like Gandolf plopped in a psychedelic suit and his voice has seen better days, but hell, he's over 70 and the band is amazing. Highly recommended. Sound and picture are excellent. Track list: That's how much I need you now, Save yourself, Hope for happiness, She's gone, When I don't want you, You don't remember, I should have know, Shooting at the moon, Stoned innocent Frankenstein, Fohat digs holes in space, Love makes sweet music. If you don't own the first 2 Soft Machine albums + Jet Propelled Photograph and the Gong ""Radio Gnome"" trilogy of albums, buy those first, buy those now.",1278115200,3,929,4.886075949367089
