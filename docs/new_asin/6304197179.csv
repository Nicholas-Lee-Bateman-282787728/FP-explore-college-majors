7866626,4,6304197179,"Key associations with the color green serves as the common denominator for this pair of episodes from the classic television sitcom ""Bewitched,"" which aired on ABC from 1964 to 1972.  Episode #106 ""Nobody But a Frog Knows How to Live"" (Written by Ruth Brooks Flippen, Aired April 27, 1967) gets going when a man starts following Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery) and Tabitha.  Familiar character actor John Fielder plays Fergus, who wants to be turned back into a frog so he can be with his beloved girlfriend.  This sound simple enough, but then there is Gladys Kravitz (Sandra Gould), the nosy neighbor from across the street, who helps compliment what should have been a simple case of flipping the old standard of the prince who is turned into a frog.
Episode #141 ""Samantha's Wedding Present"" (Written by Bernard Slade, Aired September 26, 1968) was the premier episode for the show's fifth season.  Endora (Agnes Moorhead) tries to make peace with Darrin (Dick York), and you know how well that is going to go.  To make a long story short, that is exactly what Endora does to Samantha's husband.  Make him short.  Only not all at once, which explains how Darrin ends up in a mayonnaise jar in the trash that a drunk happens to find.  Since the drunk is Irish, he is convinced Darrin is a Leprechaun (which gets us back to our green theme).  Veteran character actors Jack Griffin and Dick Wilson appear in the show as well.  This episode is the better of the pair, but I would not call either of theme classic ""Bewitched"" stories.
Final Notes: Viewers familiar with the show will notice that these episodes involve the first Darrin and the second Gladys Kravitz, but will they also notice that the phone number for the Stephens residence changes in these two episodes?  Just do not ask me why Tabitha was played by both Erin and Diane Murphy but eventually only by Erin.  Can you imagine if they had done that to Olsen twins?  As long as we are doing television trivia, let me point out that when ""Bewitched"" finished second in the Nielsen ratings in its first season it was the biggest hit the network had ever produced, up to that time.  The series also won some Emmys to underscore that this was not only imaginative but also well-written.  A lot of credit goes to the talents of Montgomery and Moorhead, who brought some rather serious acting chops to the crazy situations.",1075939200,3,2380,4.701204819277108
