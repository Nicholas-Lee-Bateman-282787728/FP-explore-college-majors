8423548,5,B004CRT86E,"When will people say enough is enough and stop this senseless abuse of dogs. It makes me sick what some people will do for money. I have a puppy mill rescue and it's sad to say he might never be the dog he should be. After living his first 20 months in a little cage with 2 other dogs. I hope America will wake up and do something.

8423552,5,B004CRT86E,"I am very impressed with the ""all sides view"" of puppy mills vs reputable breaders. I Breathe is a very balanced look at the world of commercial dog breading with a special tug on the heart strings of this dog lover. I recommend this for anyone interested in buying a dog, looking for a good cry, wanting to know more about the good, the bad and the ugly of dog breading or if you just want to watch a good documentary...Bravo!",1300838400,13,427,4.283950617283951
8423553,5,B004CRT86E,"After being involved for 20 plus years in animal rescue, I did not think I would be shocked at this video. I was wrong. I Breathe is the story of Lily, an Italian Greyhound puppy mill dog rescued in Feb. '07 by the Strader's at a dog auction in Missouri. After suffering her entire life in a puppy mill, Lily finally is able to live the life she should have had.  After a short time, the years of abuse and neglect take their toll on Lily's frail body and she dies in May '08. National Mill Dog Rescue is founded in Lily's name and the Strader's rescue thousands of puppy mill dogs who live a concentration camp existence in the name of money. Anyone who even thinks about buying a puppy at a pet store should think twice and view this video. Puppy millers are only concerned about making more money and allow their ""livestock"" to suffer their entire lives.",1300320000,17,857,4.35625
8423554,5,B004CRT86E,"This is an exceptional documentary on breeders, dog auctions, and puppy mills, and a must-see for any dog lover.

Despite the furtive behavior of the breeders, the filmmaker does her best to show both sides of the story.  Breeders are given ample opportunity to explain their point of view, but their claims seem hollow when contrasted with the footage of actual commercial dog breeding operations shown in the film.

The documentary does an excellent job of showing the conditions at commercial breeding operations without dwelling on shocking or gruesome sights.  This film will not give you nightmares, but anyone who loves animals will be moved by the plight of the puppy mill victims, and by the redemption of the lucky few.

Barb York and Frank Losey of the Missouri Pet Breeders Association (both key figures in lobbyist groups for commercial breeders) are featured heavily in the film.  Especially dramatic is the footage of veterinary treatment of a sickly, long-neglected dog, sold for one penny at auction... by Barb York.

Everyone who owns a dog or is thinking of buying one should watch this film, preferably in an animal shelter where they can see the results of irresponsible breeding firsthand.  It is a powerful statement about what happens when we treat living, feeling animals as merchandise to be sold, warehoused, and discarded when they are no longer useful.",1300060800,19,1381,5.052863436123348
