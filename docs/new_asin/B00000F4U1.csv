7906714,5,B00000F4U1,This movie is great. The description is wrong. There is no dead brother or search for his killer. I think someone may have watched half the movie. It's a 70's made for TV movie. There are a lot of young actors that you will probably recognize. Good times!,1440633600,,255,4.333333333333333
