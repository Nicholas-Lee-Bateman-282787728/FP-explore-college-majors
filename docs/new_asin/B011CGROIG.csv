7332037,5,B011CGROIG,"As mentioned in other reviews, the set number does NOT correlate with the season number. Set 12 contains several episodes from season 6 (2008)  and several episodes from season 7 (2009). So far 9 seasons have aired and there is supposed to be a new one airing in 2016. With 12 to 25 episodes per season, we have a ways to go before all seasons are available in the US! Thank you, MHZ networks for introducing this great series to US viewers.
 As for the content, the twelve set 12 episodes are as captivating and the setting and acting as charming as ever. Terence Hill as Don Matteo is delightful, his many talents, including doing some pretty fierce bicycle rides, are well utilized. Natalina continues to be unnerving at times and very funny. The Marshallo is still minding other's business, especially his daughter Patricia's and is still losing at chess with Don Matteo. The captain in this set is the new captain Tommasi. The captain's love interest  in this set is still the stewardess Amanda but  there are strong hints of the romance blooming between the captain and the marshallo's beautiful daughter Patricia. She deservedly has a larger role in this set. There is much humor in all the episodes. In each episode there is a new crime to be solved and, to the chagrin of the captain, Don Matteo always get to the guilty party first...In each episode, the final redemption scene with the perpetrator  and Don Matteo is brought about by Don Matteo' s unwavering faith in humanity.  This is a truly delightful series, suitable for young viewers as well.",1445126400,11,1560,4.716911764705882

8724068,5,B011CGROIG,"I love viewing Don Matteo episodes. I've seen all 12 sets. I am excited to purchase the next sets that include the current versions shown on TV. They are great entertainment as the episodes don't just focus on crime with gross visuals. I am not a religious person, but spiritual in nature. My heart loves the Italian language and the country of Sicily. For me, watching Don Matteo is like taking a vacation. I found the series pretty on the mark with the culture and local info. I watch them over and over. Hurry up with set 13 ++ :)",1458518400,,533,4.34

8724071,5,B011CGROIG,I love these sets as I can't find them in Australia. That being said the discs are defective so I had to return & hope that the replacement set will not have the same defects. They are also sooo behind Italy by several seasons which I think is poor form.,1449792000,,254,4.1

8724074,4,B011CGROIG,"It's a good show, but the DVDs are defective... I had to return, which stinks... You're probably better off recording the show off TV because then it won't be defective.  Plus, the sets are not the current season.",1447372800,,213,4.605263157894737
