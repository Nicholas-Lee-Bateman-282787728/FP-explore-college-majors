Coming out of the Cell Games whom Gohan saved the world from the most dangerous super android that was Perfect Cell, Gohan finds himself enrolled into a high school somewhere in Satan City 7 years later. The 25th World Martial Arts Tournament is coming up, and something's about to change after the preliminaries.

Of course you can watch it on your US Blu-ray Player since this is also not Region Coded for every Blu Ray Player in the world.
