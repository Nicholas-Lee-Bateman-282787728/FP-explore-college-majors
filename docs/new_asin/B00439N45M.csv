Ultimately all the people are frail and fragile. An excellent depiction of the human condition, made more memorable for being shown in the context of war",1431129600,,324,5.5
8414489,3,B00439N45M,"I bought this film with the intention of practicing Japanese. The spoken language and dialogues are clear and invite one into replaying the film over and over again. On the other hand, the content is disturbing because it depicts the abuse that prisoners of war were subjected to by the Japanese. Here we are able to witness a re-enactment of a brutality perpetrated by soldiers who act on the strong belief that what they are doing is right. Tom Conti (one of the film's main characters) addresses these acts in the last part of the film with his line ""You are the victim of men who think that they're right"". While this film may arise negative feelings, it also forces the viewer to wonder how a beautiful culture known for its  arquitecture, honesty, loyalty, cleanliness, and creativity among many other things, was capable of committing such atrocities against human beings. I recommend this film because it makes people stop and reflect on their perceptions of right and wrong. It is worth having it in your movie library not only for its content, but because it also depicts David Bowie's acting talent.",1309564800,2,1110,4.81151832460733
