8026785,3,B0002DRAGW,"It's basically several women taking their clothes off for the camera. Nothing wrong with that. The women are fairly attractive, but it just takes so long to get to the good stuff. The camera crew interviews each one, which is kind of boring and stretches out the length of the movie. But it's better than wading through all the bad acting of a porn to get to the good stuff. So overall, it's okay, and worth a few bucks, but it's not amazing or anything.",1394323200,,454,4.352941176470588
8026786,5,B0002DRAGW,"Don't get confused by the ""Playboy"" tag--this both worse and better than any Playboy production.

These girls (most of them) are, to me, hotter than the models that you typically see in Playboy publications. There are a dozen vignettes on this DVD, most solo (two have two girls), and most of the women are natural, and presented much more naturally than they would be in Playboy. Unlike Playboy's vids, this is stripped-down, bare-bones, cheap, shot with lower-end camera equipment. Harsh lighting, no retouching, and they still look effing HAWT. Also most aren't super-skinny but instead naturally curvaceous (there are an impressive number of bangin' booties).

These chicks also show you FAR more than you'd see in any Playboy publications--explicit nudity, even skirting hard-core in some places. Closer to being like Penthouse, really. I couldn't be more pleased.

This is quite old at this point (from 2001) and includes footage of Kitana Baker pre-15 minutes of fame.",1390176000,5,975,5.237179487179487
