8296941,4,B001E6V4UY,"I wanted a quick story about farm to fork story of chocolate.  This DVD does a great job!  It shows cacao trees, harvesting, processing, etc.  I showed this to a group of girl scouts ranging in age from 7-15, all learned something and the visuals were captivating.  One critique is that it is only the story of South American and Mexican cacao industry.  Realize that more than 70% of cacao is grown in Africa these days, with considerably more duress for farm families than is the case in the Americas.",1461628800,,503,4.544444444444444
