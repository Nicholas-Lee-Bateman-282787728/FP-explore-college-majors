7829726,5,6302682215,"Ah Buck Jones, he made some wonderful western oaters. The difference between this film and the standard Buck Jones film is that he had the young John Wayne as a co-star. You have to be an oater fan to enjoy this movie, but if you are this one will keep your interest, all the way through.",1307232000,,288,4.160714285714286
7829727,3,6302682215,"Range Feud was one of Wayne's early westerns after the Big Trail.  I've always considered it very strange why Wayne's westerns of the 1930's are not given the same sort of revered status that other western stars like Hopalong Cassidy and Roy Rogers received.  Sure they're B movies but so were the films by Cassidy and Rogers.  They might not have been as good from a pure technical standpoint, but they weren't awful either.

Well this is of course a short and sweet film clocking in at just about an hour.  Wayne plays the young cowboy Clint Turner who finds himself accused of murder.  He gets help from the sheriff played by Buck Jones (himself another legendary 30's western star) to capture the real bad guys and save the day.  The action sequences are pretty good and of course no one gets hurt too badly.  The sound is modulated pretty unevenly which is par for the course for the era.",1114041600,2,893,4.5375
7829728,3,6302682215,"Here's the Duke, in another Columbia support role, but this time he has a little more time on camera. Buck Jones is the star, as well he should be, and he plays the local sheriff whose foster brother (Wayne) is accused of  killing his girl friend's father. Buck works to exonerate him in this  well-done B-Western",964224000,12,313,4.571428571428571
