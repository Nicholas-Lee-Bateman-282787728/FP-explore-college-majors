7794321,1,097105763X,"If you are a big fan of Warren Buffett, you might be interested in buying this video. After all, it claims to show you what an annual meeting is like as well as offer insights into the minds behind Berkshire Hathaway. I strongly recommend, however, that you do not buy this documentary. Here's why:
The blip about the movie that you might have read in its Amazon description is correct--Peter Lynch and Roger Lowenstein are, as it says, interviewed. The questions though are superficial, and the amount of air-time given to them both is together less than five minutes easy. So what constitutes the main substance of the documentary? Just people--mostly random stockholders--sharing their thoughts on Mr Buffett. Everything from what they think about money to what price they bought Berkshire stock at is discussed, mostly in a boring sequence that repeats itself throughout.
Viewers will not learn anything about Buffett from this piece, moreover, that they could not easily (and cheaply) discover from one or two articles about ""the Oracle"". And this is the biggest gripe I have against it. Where the producers should have done a little bit of research on the man himself, then present that information to us, they instead chose to simply pick up a camera and ask others what they thought.
The end result is a movie that I--an avid Buffett fan--found to be unbearably boring, completely useless, and thus, a huge rip-off. I would have rather seen a home video of a single annual meeting, where what Buffet and Munger said on stage was the focus, than this over-priced video any day.
I wish I could suggest a good documentary on Warren Buffet, either as a man, a Ceo, or an investor, but I cannot. So the only advice I can give you is to pick up Roger Lowenstein's book _Making of an American Capitalist_. It will take more time, and demand more from you, than sitting through a short documentary--but the extra effort you have to expend will definitely be worth it.",1081036800,22,1967,4.788235294117647
7794322,3,097105763X,"If you're looking for Warren Buffett to discuss his theory on stock picking you won't get it here. When he does say something he's vague as usual. For example, Buffett, as always, says he chooses businesses that have excellent managers,(which is obvious, you wouldn't want an imbecile running you business); but what are the qualities that make a excellent manager? Instead Buffett's investment theory is ""fleshed out"" by Peter Lynch and Motley Fool. Thus, you only get a speculation on what Buffett thinks. You also get bits and pieces of his background from his children, Lowenstein and Kilpatrick. What makes this video interesting is the shareholders' meeting and interviews. BRK (it's not really clear if they own the A or B stock) investors all appear to hold normal jobs and live simply yet, they are, I assume, millionaires because of Warren Buffett.  (In 1990 BRK.A was selling at about $7000/share, in 2000 it was worth $40,000/share and today it went up to the unheard of $100,000/share. How high can it go?). This is a Warren Buffett cult: you see middle-age and elderly people trampling each other for good seats and for a chance to speak to Buffett. (Especially telling is that one shareholder stopped going to the meeting a few years back because he thought that an attendance of 500 was too chaotic. When he returned in 2000, attendance grew to 11000 strong). This video would be more worthwhile if Warren Buffett gave a very candid and thorough explanation on how to pick stocks. Until then we can only infer on how it is done.",1077408000,5,1544,4.826415094339622

7794324,5,097105763X,"If your into Berkshire Hathaway stock watch this tape.  This tape will help you gain confidence in the CEO of BRK.  It shows a man who has great integrity, who you can trust to manage your money through the Berkshire Hathaway stock.  Warren Buffett doesn't claim to always make the right decision and is willing to explain his mistakes.  It makes me feel that he will always try to do the best he can possibly do for the company.",1003622400,,429,4.3924050632911396
7794325,4,097105763X,"The best parts of this video come from Warren Buffett's adult children.  They are living examples and excellent spokespersons for the value of education and a meaningful vocation to experience happiness in life.  Their billionaire Father refused to become their crutch, therefore they don't need one.  Investors who treck to the annual meeting are avid learners who became believers and watched their personal wealth grow.  They've learned to stick with their disclipline as Buffett does.  The stampeed to secure seating up close and personal was a bit overplayed.  For, once in their seats, I've never experienced a more calm, respectful, attentive crowd. This year was my first Berkshire Hathaway experience.  Truths regarding the basics of sound investing and enjoying the journey of success are laced throughout the video by both the Oracle and his followers.  Weakness in the video comes from small print on the screen of important statements that are easy to miss because of the speed and difficulty required to read. This video is good for all ages to learn in a fun way the joys of successful and prudent investing.  The annual gathering to celebrate and continue the learning gives meaning and strengthens the personal ties that make the process more enjoyable.",989280000,4,1270,5.15609756097561
