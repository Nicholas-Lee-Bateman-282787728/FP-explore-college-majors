It's a good thriller, and people who enjoy supernatural mysteries should like it. The end doesn't provide a sure and reliable solution , and the viewer remains impressed ans spellbound. Brett his about forty and absolutely dashing . It's a real treat to watch him...people who want to do justice to this underrated actor should have a glance at facebook:""posthumous BAFTA for Jeremy Brett"".
Good old british series are gems.",1273017600,3,523,4.887640449438202

Many of these were seen here in the US on PBS. Jeremy Brett of Sherlock Holmes fame stars as a horror fiction writer who retreats to an isolated hotel with his wife.

 A suspense chiller where fiction and reality are one and the same. A frightening look at what happens when characters of the imagination come to life. Sheridan Owen played by JEREMEY BRETT  exhausted after the launching of his new novel a macabre 19th century ghost story, escapes with his wife to a country getaway. All goes well until events start seeming very familiar. Coincidences, at first small and seemingly unimportant unfold and multiply, unsettling Owen as he realized the growing resemblance of his novel- in which the spirit of a drowned ferryman rises from its river grave to terrorize the living. Not until daylight returns and the Owens endure a night of mystery and horror, does the novelist and his wife realize the full significance of their bizarre excursion across the frontiers of fiction and reality.  Suspense chiller unlike any other thriller written by Julian Bond (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shooting-Party/dp/B000007P7L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shooting Party</a>&nbsp;)",1211155200,4,1821,6.3603238866396765
