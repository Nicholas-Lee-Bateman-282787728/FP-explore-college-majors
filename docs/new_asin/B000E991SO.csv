I AM VERY FOND OF DORIS DAY",1155168000,3,76,3.2222222222222223
2510605,5,B000E991SO,"I found Season Three of the Doris Day Show, entertaining, delightful and refreshing.  Doris Day's warmth, charm, and optimism shine forth and that is always a lovely thing to see.  Although Doris did not want to do TV because of the grueling schedules involved, she seems to have resigned herself to doing it by Season Three, quite nicely.

The show is timeless, and could've been made yesterday, except ... values have changed.  There is no anger or obsenity in these shows, just good vibes and a sense of natural goodness pervading our existence.  There are a couple of things to be glad about once you see all the episodes, one is that you can still watch the bloopers, interviews, and a pilot show that are included, and beyond that you can can be glad about getting the other seasons of the show, and beyond that...  we will just have to wait for other energetic, bright and beautiful celebrities like Doris and her friends.",1153180800,6,929,4.668711656441718
2510606,5,B000E991SO,"As everyone else mentioned, these DORIS DAY season sets from MPI are simply great.

The only annoying feature, especially seen in 2nd and 3rd season episodes, is something that probably cannot be corrected.  Everytime Miss Day appears in close up or two-shot, the image is diffused(slightly blurred)!!  This was obviously done to hide any of Miss Day's wrinkles or other facial blemishes, but it can be jarring at times!  In a few of the season 3 episodes, the effect becomes rather strange....in some shots, like watching a 3-D movie without the glasses!  Poor Rose Marie doesn't get this treatment unless she's in a two-shot with Miss Day.  I've always heard that some of the older movie stars were photographed in this way, but never really noticed it much until watching this series again.

Still, if you can get past this minor irritation, these are great wholesome family entertainment.",1149033600,16,892,4.986486486486487
2510607,5,B000E991SO,"Doris Day is without a doubt one of the most natural actors in the history of film and television. She could play both comedy and drama with complete truth and great appeal. She translated well to the small screen and this third year of her CBS sitcom was probably its best. Doris is glamorous and surrounded by a wealth of talented co-stars and guests, ranging from McLean Stevenson to Kaye Ballard to Meredith Baxter and Tonny Bennett.

The quality of the episodes is terrific with rich, clear colors. The bonus material, as in previous Seasons 1 & 2 DVD sets, is plentiful -- new interviews with actors Bernie Kopell (Louie Pallucci) and Philip Brown (Billy Martin) plus another bloopers reel (with Doris having great fun between takes), outtakes of Doris' famous opening credit run down her spiral staircase, and lots more. If you haven't already enjoyed Doris Day's TV show on DVD, this is the best season to start with and then visit the others -- it's fascinating to watch ""The Doris Day Show"" evolve from a rural comedy in its first season to a sophisticated career woman in the city before Mary Tyler Moore came along.",1145145600,24,1127,4.720812182741117
2510608,5,B000E991SO,"Countless Doris Day fans have had cause to celebrate during the past year as the first and second season of her hit CBS comedy series have been released on DVD.  The pristine quality and great bonus features have only been part of the reason for the rejoicing. The series has proven to be even better than die-hard fans recalled and many new admirers have fallen under the spell cast by Miss Day.

Season Three will soon be out and it promises to easily measure up to the first two, as the show continued to evolve season by season, thereby preventing viewers from falling into a routine rut.

During the third season, which aired in 1970-1971, the character played by Miss Day left the farm in Mill Valley and moved into San Francisco with her two boys. The grandfather, played by the venerable Denver Pyle during the first two seasons, appeared from time to time and even directed a few episodes. Miss Day takes up residence in an exquisite apartment with a spiral staircase located over an Italian restaurant run by husband and wife Kaye Ballard and Bernie Kopell. They add their own special zest to the proceedings and the season features a dazzling array of guest stars. There is something for everyones taste from Tony Bennett in a side-splitting episode, Van Johnson as Miss Day's cousin, Ricardo Montalban, John Gavin, not looking a day older than he did when he appeared with Miss Day in ""Midnight Lace"" in 1960, the nearly 90 year old Estelle Winwood, John McGiver, Stubby Kaye and returning for appearances from the previous year, Billy DeWolfe, Lew Ayres, Edward Andrews and Larry Storch as boxer, Duke Farentino. There's a terrific episode in which Miss Day wins a Doris Day Lookalike Contest and goes to Hollywood to meet Miss Day. Henry Fonda makes a cameo appearance and you almost wish the two stars had worked together.

McLean Stevenson, Rose Marie and Paul Smith are back as Miss Day's co-workers at Today's World Magazine and the annual fashion show sequence is a sparkling display of early 70's fashions from mod to marvelous.

One of the highpoints of the season is when Miss Day renders a few vocal ditties. Her version of ""Silver Bells"" sung in the Christmas episode is memorable as is her brief coupling with Bennett on his signature tune, ""I Left My Heart in San Francisco"". Even her playful singing with Storch to ""Shine on Harvest Moon"" brightens the episode.

While the writing may sometimes be inconsistent, the one constant is Miss Day who is charming, real, and the most natural actress on television at the time.

""The Doris Day Show"" deserved the huge ratings it garnered during the third of its five seasons on the air and after watching this DVD you will not have to ask why.

As usual, the production values promised are first-rate and the extras are indeed special.

After watching the third season, you'll be crossing your fingers and counting the days till seasons four and five are unveiled.",1138752000,55,2933,4.7578740157480315
2510629,5,B000E991SO,"San Francisco...Here she comes.  In season three, Doris Martin packs up her boys and English sheepdog- Billy, Toby and Lord Nelson (guess which one's the dog), and puts down roots in the place where Tony Bennett left his heart.

Leaving the farm and her father behind, she becomes much more of the single girl about town.  She still has the family connection as Denver Pyle makes two appearances as Buck (and directs many episodes), and the boys are still featured.  But she's more focused on career, even conducting some interviews and writing for ""Today's World,"" the magazine where she works.  If anything symbolizes her new status, it's the gorgeous apartment she rents over Pallucci's Italian restaurant.  The image of her gliding down that spiral staircase in the opening screams - I have arrived and life is beautiful!!

Rose Marie, McLean Stevenson and Paul Smith all return as friends and co-workers.  New to the show are landlords/restaurant owners Louie (Bernie Kopell) and Angie (Kaye Ballard) Pallucci.  Billy DeWolfe is also added to the cast as disgruntled next-door neighbor, Mr. Jarvis, but he will always be the magician in ""Frosty the Snowman"" to me; his distinctive voice was used for that character.

There are plenty of highlights in season three; topping the list would be Tony Bennett guest starring in ""Tony Bennett Is Eating Here.""  At the end, he and Doris sit at the piano and sing; it's a dream to have that on DVD.  I also like ""Lost and Found,"" where Doris and Myrna (Rose Marie) look for a lost manuscript in a nightclub and Doris ends up auditioning as a go-go dancer.  Goofy?  Yes.  But she's very funny and it's a great slice of 1970 culture.  ""It's Christmas Time in the City"" rings my silver bells, since I'm a sucker for Christmas.  I love it when they all sing carols, and it's sweet when Mr. Jarvis finally joins the party.  ""Billy's First Date"" is very cute and Ricardo Montalban and Lisa Gerritsen (Bess from ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"") guest star.  And there's the traditional fashion show episode called...wait for it...""The Fashion Show.""  What they lacked in creativity in the title, they made up for in the show.  This year, they've gone high class and uptown with groovy music that sounds like an early 70's theme for a car chase scene, colorful spotlights and a real runway.  There are at least eight different hats and four different wigs & some great clothes that she wears to the hilt.  Once again, Doris is the only model in this show, leaving us to wonder what in the world did the audience do with the lag time while she was changing...  Except for Mr. Harvey telling jokes while they scrambled to turn a garment bag into a dress backstage, I kid you not; the audience was left to their own devices.  I can only hope hors d'oeuvres and cocktails were served.

There are 26 episodes.  Extras include:  a pilot called ""Young Love"" starring Meredith Baxter that is so bad you'll want to poke your own eyes out...then again, it is fun to watch and wonder what they were thinking; interviews with Bernie Kopell and Philip Brown (Billy) and more.

I recommend this fun season.  In San Francisco or anywhere- if Doris is there, that's where you'll leave your heart.",1334534400,,3214,4.7284172661870505
2510630,4,B000E991SO,"The third season of THE DORIS DAY SHOW saw a revamp in the series' setting and tone, with Doris Martin (Doris Day), tired of the daily commute to and from the farm, moving to San Francisco with her two boys and sheepdog Lord Nelson.  They find the ideal apartment--which includes ""That"" spiral staircase--over a cosy Italian restaurant, run by Louie and Angie Pallucci (Bernie Kopell and Kaye Ballard), whilst Doris continues with her job at Today's World Magazine.  Wherever there's trouble there's bound to be Mr. Jarvis (Billy DeWolfe), who winds up as Doris' next-door-neighbour; and best friend Myrna (Rose Marie) is on hand to offer her sardonic views on dating and men.

Part of the reason why THE DORIS DAY SHOW shed it's rustic farm atmosphere was, I'm sure, the CBS Network's decision to axe it's ""rural"" sitcoms in the early Seventies (including ""Beverly Hillbillies"", ""Petticoat Junction"" and ""Green Acres"").  DORIS DAY might have ended up on the scrapheap too, had the show not been able to transform itself with a new main setting.  Doris looks a million bucks in her custom Magnin wardrobe and fetching top-knot hairstyle.  She must have been on a very good salary at Today's World!  Kaye Ballard and Bernie Kopell inject some wacky new comedy into the show, and Rose Marie is the perfect foil for Doris.  This would prove to be the final season for the boys, Billy (Philip Brown) and Toby (Tod Starke), McLean Stevenson and Rose Marie.

2510631,5,B000E991SO,"The third season is awesome!  I love the character Mr. Jarvis (played by actor Billy DeWolfe).  Every time I hear him speak I think of Frosty the Snowman as he played the voice of the magician with the magical hat.  This season has Mr. Jarvis moving in as Doris' new neighbor and her kids and dog bother him to no end!  Also, in another episode, Mr. Jarvis warns Doris that she and her sons should be on their best behavior when his uncle visits (which is played by himself).  I also thoroughly enjoy the episode where Myrna loses her manuscript and they both end up at a go-go club where Doris stalls for time by auditioning as a go-go dancer while Myrna checks out the place for her manuscript.  Tony Bennett has a guest appearance in an episode where Doris and Tony sing together.

Another enjoyable episode is when her boys enter her in a Doris Day look-a-like contest without telling her and she ends up winning a trip to Hollywood.  VERY FUNNY!

This is a great season to own and my boys and I enjoy it thoroughly...you will too!",1280880000,,1035,4.405263157894737
2510632,1,B000E991SO,"I loved season 1 and season 2 - laughed and really enjoyed them. But seasons 3 and 4 - I wasted $40! Doris Day has done so much better! Totally different than the first two seasons.. gone were the kids, and the comedy, the ""working mother of two"" and is now the woman all men are after and suddenly she is on the wealthy side of things! I have watched both seasons today and haven't cracked a smile.  It's like they took a low budget drama storyline and tried, unsuccessfully, to put some comedy in to the story. The storylines were just to serious to be comedic. The liveliness and comedy in these 2 seasons is completely missing... stick with the first 2 seasons!",1239494400,3,665,4.362903225806452

2510634,5,B000E991SO,This is a great family show from back in my childhood. We enjoy the shows and they can be very relaxing. It's nice to look back when people took time to enjoy life without so many high tech gadgets.,1212796800,,198,4.102564102564102
2510635,5,B000E991SO,"Most likely the greatest talent ever, and that praise comes from those that have worked with her. Singer, Actor, Dancer, Comedienne, and Animal Rights Activist ...

After he died Doris felt obligated to follow through with his obligation. It turned out to be a great time as it put her finacially back on the map and she met so many wonderful and beloved co stars>She is a true legend.",1168300800,,396,4.089743589743589
2510638,5,B000E991SO,"Well I started with the thrid season because I didn't quite know what to expect.  I did expect to be entertained by Doris, who has never failed to do that, but to be entertained to the extent that I was really surprised me.  I laughed and found myself excited about watching the next show.  I am not a Doris Day freak but I really do like the lady.  She comes across as a typical, everyday, normal woman. I guess that is mostly her appeal.  Her timing for comedy is wonderful and the cast surrounding her is perfect.  I wish they still made comedies like this.  Makes you realize how much we have changed (and not for the good) in the last 30 years.  This set is wonderful, I am here to order Season II.",1156118400,6,703,4.1940298507462686
8107625,5,B000E991SO,"Last year, on a whim, I bought season 1 of ""The Doris Day Show"". It's about the day to day life of a widow who is raising her two boys with the help of her father, hired help and neighbors. After watching season 1, I decided (for the time being) to skip buying season 2 and buy season 3. In the beginning of season 3 the family moves from a house in the country into an apartment over a pizza place in the city of San Francisco and this is when the series begins to pick up speed. There is, for me, some sort of magnetic pull towards the nostalgia of the 1960's sitcoms. From t.v. series like ""The Lucy Show"", ""Gilligan's Island"" and ""The Dick Van Dyke show"" to ""Get Smart"", ""Bewitched"" and ""Hazel""... ""The Doris Day Show"" easily fits in with the other classics of that decade. And oh yeah! did I mention this series can be old fashioned, syrupy and downright corny? Well it is but that's where its charm lies and I have to say I've already grown to LOVE IT and look forward to buying the rest of the series ! And to add to that delight, not having watched  this show in its original run, I now, get to discover and watch this wonderful t.v. series for the first time!!  Add this to your collection. It's for all ages and worth the buy. I highly recommend this DVD.",1524441600,,1265,4.180327868852459
8107626,1,B000E991SO,"The show episodes that I was able to view were 5 star...the 1 star rating is because disc 4 doesn't have a main menu and bonus materials.

8107629,4,B000E991SO,"I didn't know Doris Day had a sitcom in the 70s until I saw reruns on an oldie TV channel. There's lots of familiar faces like McLean Stevenson,Kaye Ballard, the doctor from the love boat and Rose Marie from the dick van dyke show. In one episode in season 3 Doris Day's rich boss gives her a wireless rotary phone to carry around in a suitcase do he can always reach her. Lol. Great opening sequence too.",1422748800,,405,4.2727272727272725

8107631,4,B000E991SO,"I also posted this review on TCM's website.

Still a wonderful season but I did enjoy season two better.  Doris decides that the commute is getting to be too much with driving from the ranch to work so she gets her own apartment above Palucci's Italian restaurant.  The boys move in with her, there's a lot less of her father's character, and there's an occasional babysitter named Ethel.

In my opinion the last disc on this dvd set is the best.  To me personally, I enjoyed the contrast between the ranch and the office in season two and I felt the writing was better.  But the last disc of season 3 really has some terrific episodes.  In one episode Doris' son Billy goes on his first date and she ends up dating, for this episode only, his date's widowed father.  Doris and Myrna spend a weekend at a ski resort and Doris' ends up taking interest in a doctor, who is played by one of the actors in her movie ""Midnight Lace"".  Excellent chemistry between the two of them.  And Doris has to go on a camping trip with Toby as he doesn't have a father to take him.  Doris' co-star John Astin from her movie ""That Touch of Mink"" is also in this episode and it's quite funny.  Doris looks adorable in the pigtails.

There are a couple other really good episodes, and some where the writing just wasn't where it should have been.

Great special features as with the previous seasons.  Doris looks great as always and her acting is superb.",1405382400,,1435,4.403041825095057
