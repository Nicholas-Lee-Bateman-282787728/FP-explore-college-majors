Nice night vision work and good zoom shots...of course it had to feature the old washed up self proclaimed expert witness interviews and hoaky Halloween props... But I will probably buy part two, if there ever will be one.",1426982400,2,347,5.0
8649966,4,B00JDL7TBA,"Liked teamwork aspect of the presentation. It took the viewer into the experience. Video buffered a bit, but started again. Good information.",1424217600,,141,5.454545454545454
8649967,1,B00JDL7TBA,"This was not what I expected at all.  The sound quality was terrible for much of the interviews and the team didn't even physically go on the property of the Skinwalker Ranch, and instead videotaped the ranch from outside the perimeter of the property.  It was short and very amateur in nature.  I was so excited to watch this. and so disappointed after I did.",1423440000,2,360,4.507692307692308
8649968,3,B00JDL7TBA,"Very interesting subject, but way too short. Also, the sound quality was lacking in some areas.",1408665600,,95,5.0
8649969,4,B00JDL7TBA,"it was a good watch but it could of been way better
hopefully the next one will be way better.",1402012800,2,94,3.75
8649970,5,B00JDL7TBA,"To be honest, there are many Skinwalker related books and DVDs out there. However, Antonio's documentary regarding the UFO phenomena at ""UFO Ranch"" takes the extra step by providing the viewer a rich history about the Ute and Navajo legend. The API team, moreover, provides the viewer with never content about the ranch not found on the internet, they provide details about the investigative process during their expedition to Utah, and make no claims or assertions about what could be causing the alleged activity at the ranch. I also enjoyed the scary music! This DVD is a must for those who enjoy learning more about the Skinwalker legend. Can't wait for part 2!",1397865600,,665,4.893805309734513
8649971,5,B00JDL7TBA,I got this DVD straight from Antonio at the Ozark UFO Conference. I never heard of Skinwalker Ranch until I saw this documentary. Very informative and SCARY!!! This documentary is full of stories about UFOs and paranormal activity. The spooky music is also fun! I only wish it was more than 30 minutes long! Antonio says part 2 will come out soon. Cant wait!!!,1397606400,,360,4.640625
