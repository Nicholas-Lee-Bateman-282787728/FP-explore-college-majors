7843634,5,630327904X,"Whoever said that this movie did not tell much of the Red Cell story, wasn't concentrating.  I would suggest really paying attention when you watch it again.  It's there, if you understand something of the then-environment in which Red Cell was set up.  It's there, one just has to concentrate and know one's environment.",1151539200,2,321,4.907407407407407
7843635,5,630327904X,"When this was released in '94, we were more concerned about courting dictators (oops, I meant proletarian internationalists) and delivering pizzas to the Turd World. I mean, weren't we overreacting to the ""terrorist threat""? Perhaps it was just a misunderstanding between oriental and occidental cultures? Back then we lived in harmony with the rest of the world (i.e., France, Germany, and any other country with cradle to the grave socialism and legalized drugs). In '04, when the U.S. President responds to this ""desperate cry from the oppressed"", he is viewed as being more evil than the ""freedom fighters"" who decimated over 3,000 Americans in one day (before lunch even commenced). ISN'T DIVERSITY JUST WONDERFUL?",1095206400,,719,5.315789473684211
7843636,4,630327904X,"While the video did not show as much of the missions as I expected, It did show quite a bit. This, I believe was due to the fact that few people actually know where all the Red Cell tapes are. It's worth the money and full of information.",986601600,3,238,3.9791666666666665
7843637,3,630327904X,"I have been a Marcinko fan for a little over 2 years now and was not disappointed with this video. It is always great to see real warriors in action. I'll agree that this video was too short and did not show enough of  Red Cell in action. I don't know if that is because of the availability of  the real tapes or not but you still come away with a pretty good idea of  what was happening with the security of these bases. The quality of the  video could have been better in a perfect world but this is not COPS. This  was sneaking and peaking. In the heat of battle it's a little harder to  concentrate on the camera angle. You couldn't exactly yell ""Cut""  and reshoot a scene.  You do get to see and hear Marcinko for a good part  of the video. Also Steve Hartman (a.k.a. Stevie Wonder). It shows how much  we need a team like Red Cell in the future. But let them do what they are  trained to do.",949968000,10,897,4.0397727272727275
