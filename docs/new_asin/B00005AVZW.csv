1418659,5,B00005AVZW,"Road To Redemption is rare in that it has 3 great features that you do not see together too often. It has super comedy, the kind that is so popular today with a mafia theme, outstanding scenery that is colorful and majestic, and a Christian message that is so wonderfully presented that it is the best evangerlical tool I've ever seen. You can present this movie to anyone and after they stop laughing (which will take some time), they will really relate to the spititual message. The story is simple, presented well and the acting is superb. This is a can't miss flick. You will thoroughly enjoy it and want 100 of your closest friends and family to see it as well.",1005350400,14,666,4.467213114754099
1418660,5,B00005AVZW,"""Road to Redemption"" was a great movie.  It's a movie that the whole family can watch, and all you moms' who read this, it'll be a tearjerker, it was for me.  It's a heart-warming movie that makes people feel good.  I would definitely recommend this movie to my friends.  This movie was a real twist, in my opinion, because it started at 7:30 and I have never seen CBS put a movie on at an odd hour like that, next time I won't be so opinionated when it comes to a movie they put on that early again, but it was definitely worth starting early! I loved this movie so much that I may just have to buy it!",992044800,4,603,4.042016806722689
1418661,4,B00005AVZW,"Road to Redemption is dubed as a comedy movie.  Although the comedy part of the movie, allowed a chuckle now and then. The movie made a bigger hit in it's message. A young girl living with her lover works for a Mob boss. She and her lover in get in trouble  by talknig illegal money mailed to her boss. Financially dry, she and her lover blow it on fixed horse racing bets. When they loose all the money, she travels to her meet her rich retired grandfather, who by the way  has not seen her since she was a little girl. He agrees to give her the money owed under one condition. That she takes him fishing. Off they go cross country, with the mob at their heels, and her lover who turns eventually out to be her traitor. The theme is no doubt directed towards a grandfather who wanted to start a new relationship with his granddaugther, who is only intrested in getting the money she needs. A Good story, with a God inspired message, a good dvd for all young and old.",987638400,18,967,4.244565217391305

I love the movies that Billy Graham puts out!!",1366502400,,130,4.954545454545454
1418680,5,B00005AVZW,"This movie starts out rather comical and remains so most of the way through. But, takes a turn to the serious with a few near death experiences. Reminding us that we never know when our time is up. A great movie about a grandfather who desires to get to know his long lost granddaughter, when she finds herself in need of some serious money, then remembers her grandfather who she remembers has LOTS of money. When one scheme turns bad, she is running from the mafia (her boss), and plans another scheme to get money from her grandfather...one thing leads to another, in the end she gives her life over to God...and things change completely. Great movie, lots of action, but short scenes of mild violence, shooting, tense momments. Best for older children or while watching with parents who can explain.",1359590400,,803,4.702127659574468
1418681,5,B00005AVZW,"This movie is a breath of fresh air in the staleness of movies coming out of Hollywood. While it has comedy, action and romance, it remains wholesome and the theme of redemption weaves itself throughout the movie. While many conservative movies tend to be cheesy and of poor quality, Road to Resemption is very professional and nicely done. A must see!",1317254400,,352,4.786885245901639

I don't think I've ever received a DVD with such poor sound quality. The movie itself is excellent and I would recommend it to others.

1418684,2,B00005AVZW,"The movie was slow. The worst part was the way the girl was dressed. Very tight clothing throughout the movie. What were the makers of the movie thinking knowing it would be a ""family"" movie. I was embarrassed watching it with my family. I threw it away afterwards.",1279929600,2,265,4.541666666666667
1418685,5,B00005AVZW,"A big thanks to the producers of this movie, for making a Christian movie with standard Hollywood quality produiction values, as in script, crew, actors, sound, musci, sets, etc. Christian movies are now mainstream, and all the movies I have seen under the Billy Graham Presents line have been great. For Christian movie, this subject is rare, it is a comedy and a road trip movie. If you are not a Christian, you will still enjoy this movie. In the story Amanda (Julie Condra) works for a guy that is probably a mob boss, and her live in boyfriend Alan (Jay Underwood) takes money from her bosses safe. They are broke, and use the money at the race track to no good end. Amanda and her boyfriend face death if they cannot deliver the cash, so she goes on the road to locate her rich grandpa (Pat Hingle) that she has not spoken to since she was a kid. The mob boss orders his thugs to track her down, and Wes Studi is great in this as a mob hit man that seems to telepathically find his prey. When she finds Grandpa, he puts some conditions on helping her, and along the way she comes to learn that even though she has had a very empty life full of sin, God is always there offering redemption. Really fun movie, the movie is full of familiar faces, and I recommend.",1271635200,,1267,4.305439330543933

1418687,4,B00005AVZW,"this movie is billed as funny, I disagree, it is a more serious drama with a little humor- very little. But it is worth watching",1240531200,,128,4.16
1418688,5,B00005AVZW,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this film because so many Christian films have such second-rate scripting and acting.  But this film was terrific!  The story is really cute, the script is well written, the acting is good, and there was enough humor and action to keep my 10- and 11-year old boys (who often think they're too cool for this kind of film) interested and laughing the whole time.  They loved it!  I wish Hollywood could see that you don't have to fill a film with bad language and crude humor for it to be a great movie!  I'd recommend this film for any family.",1234656000,,576,4.345794392523365
1418689,2,B00005AVZW,"I bought this DVD based soley on the positive reviews I read here at Amazon.com.  I'm always looking for good family entertainment and this sounded like a winner, but we were sadly disappointed with this movie.  The acting was poor (except for the main character who is a veteran of film and TV) and the script way below average.  All of my family walked out on this one; I stayed with it till the end and lo and behold the last 5 minutes were the best part of the movie.  Finally the dialogue and people stopped being too cute and too forced and became ""real"". I've seen much better Billy Graham films than this one.",1232409600,3,617,4.339130434782609

1418695,5,B00005AVZW,"This is simply one the best movies I've seen in a very long time.

I wasn't expecting much when I sat down to watch but was surprised how much I was moved watching it.  The base of the movie is comedy but I also found myself being anxious and moved to tears, especially at the end.  It's actually a very happy ending, but it makes you cry.  It's also got some nice stunts and a cool car chase.

The Christian message of salvation is wonderfully done in this movie and I think appeals to everyone.  I highly highly recommend this movie for your collection and to give to others who need some joy and hope in their lives.",1133308800,7,619,4.203389830508475
1418696,5,B00005AVZW,"It's always a risk to buy a DVD sight unseen, but I bought this gem based on some reviews I've read and the fact that it's made by Worldwide Pictures who have produced some great movies (Vow to Cherish, Something to sing about).
Road to Redemption tells of a young couple Amanda Tucker (the lovely Julie Condra) and Alan Fischer (Jay Underwood) who are sick of struggling along financially so ""borrow"" some money from Amanda's boss who also happens to be a Mob boss, along with the money comes racing tips for some fixed races so off they go to the racing track. All does not go to plan and Amanda finds herself having to leave town to track down her Grandfather Nathan (Pat Hingle) in order to hit him up for some cash so she can pay back her boss.
There are some excellent performances put in by the lead actors as well as the supporting mobsters Tony Longo as Vincent the enforcer is very amusing as it Wes Studi as Frank Lightfoot. There are some real funny set pieces in this film and some of it reminded me of the also excellent Dumb and Dumber (minus the crudeness).
Road to Redemption  is a family friendly comedy with real heart. It's extremely amusing and a joy to watch. It also very moving and touching as well as Amanda gets to know her Grandfather and learns about what is most important in life. I recommend it whole-heartily for anyone needing a good laugh and it's refreshingly free from smut, foul language and jokes made in bad taste.
Enjoy this film and thanks for reading.",1082851200,40,1493,4.4489051094890515
1418697,5,B00005AVZW,"This is one Christian film that lots of people will enjoy. I mean believers in Christ and non-believers. It's a great insight on following the road to Christ. It's about a couple, Amanda (Julie Condra) and Alan (Jay Underwood) who found stolen mob money. They decide to gamble the money on horse racing and lose the money. The gangsters find out about this and go after the couple. The grandaughter, Amanda seeks the help of her wealthy grandpa Nathan (Pat Hingle) for the money she needs to pay back the mob. But grandpa has plans. It seems he ""got religion"" and is willing to give her the money. But she has to drive him to visit his favorite fishing hole some 800 miles away. There are some breathe-taking scenes of Utah. So they're all on the run from the mob and along the way learn a valuable lesson of choices and consequences. In the meantime, God gets Amanda's attention and God gives the mob a run for their money. The movie is rated PG for thematic elements and mild violent content, but still a clean Christian movie. It's advised that very young children shouldn't view this. For older teens and adults may find a lesson to be learned that doing something you know is wrong can only get you into deeper trouble. Billy Graham's 'Road to Redemption' is really a great movie with a great message to lead those to Christ.",1051660800,15,1330,4.522821576763485
1418698,5,B00005AVZW,"We had movie night this past Sunday at church, and I have to tell you that this movie really moved within the church. I thought it was going to be a cheesy movie, but little did I know that the movie was going to be awesome. I think that this movie would make a great witnessing tool for non-believers to get an insight of how someone would come to know Christ. God Bless All!!",1048032000,,377,4.108108108108108
1418699,5,B00005AVZW,"Yes, it's corny at times, but if you do corny just right, you can not only get away with it, but it can be great entertainment!  Most comedies end up trying to be funny by getting as close to the border of offensive as possible.  It is SOOOO refreshing to find something that makes you laugh that you also don't feel like trashing in the next scene.  The story starts out a bit weird and corny and develops into a humorous, dramatic, heartwarming tale of what real meaning in life is about.  It is unique in it's genre, in a world full of too many rapture, end-days Christian movies or the alternate end of the road, then get saved variety.  Yet, at the same time, it effectively assaults the shallow thinking of today's society with looking beyond the veil.  Try the movie, make sure you get past the 1st 10 minutes and I think you'll love it.",1019260800,12,844,4.343949044585988
1418700,5,B00005AVZW,"Road to redemption was better than I hoped for. A Christian movie with some humor. Don't miss out-Get the DVD version! You will get many extras that you won't find on the VHS. This is not a witnessing tool, but a good addition to the Christain DVD collection, try ""Vanished"" by cloud ten pictures for a witnessing tool. If you liked this movie try ""Something to sing about"" & ""A Vow to Cherish"" both are heart warming Christian movies and are also by world wide pictures. Plus they have many extras if you purchase the DVD versions.",1015286400,16,532,4.494845360824742
1418701,2,B00005AVZW,"heh well this movie wasn't that bad really.. though when I was watching it I didn't know it was supposed to be a another movie made by the door-to-door hardcore christians trying to push their religion on me :/ but I won't bash this movie just for that I guess.  Anyway I only gave this movie 2/5 stars because a) the acting of the protagonist was pretty bad.. or actually the WRITING FOR the character was unbeleiveable and cheesy.. but I guess you get what you asked for b) plot had some major gaps.. I would go into them more but I think it'd give away too many spoilers.. c) the quality of the film making wasn't so great
but I did like the performance by the actors playing the mobsters :)
I hope I don't get flamed by some christians who think that believing in any other religious besides catholic is wrong, or are very intollerant of the idea of atheists.. this is just me but I don't think I belong to any set religion, but am at the same time not athiest... so.. embrace the differences ! :)
p.s. still a bad movie",1010448000,4,1024,4.251282051282051
