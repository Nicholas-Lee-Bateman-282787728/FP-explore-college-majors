8297998,5,B001EGKYZK,"Bought for my wife, normally you can play region 2 on cheap Chinese DVD player(no region code restrictions?).  Not this one, I had to rip and strip the DVDs before she could view, so  if you don't know what I am talking about and live in North America don't buy.  Seller made region restrictions very clear.",1479513600,,307,4.446428571428571
8297999,5,B001EGKYZK,"I absolutely loved this series when it aired in the US!!  One of the best action British exports to the US and one of the remaining series I've been anxious to own for my DVD collection.  I remember staying home on Saturday nights just to see the opening credits!!  Loved, loved, loved it and I don't get it..WHY is it still not available for purchase in Region 1??  I can't be the only person wanting to purchase and own this.",1435363200,8,427,4.3
8298000,5,B001EGKYZK,"I, too, would like to see this series become available in the US market. I would be one of the first in line to buy it. This was one of my favorite TV shows growing up. I have old, nearly worn out VHS tapes recorded off TV, but no VCR. If TPTB think there isn't enough of a market for mass production in the US, isn't there something similar to ""print on demand"" where they only produce enough to fill orders?",1400025600,6,409,4.061728395061729
8298001,1,B001EGKYZK,"I really look forward to being able to find some of my favorite shows from the past that are NOW available on DVD. Sadly this one is not currently available for viewing in Region 1. I guess Region 1 is considered too small or indifferent to bother with making the product available to us in North America so we can enjoy viewing this program as well as other Regions. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!! until the powers that be  rectify this problem and make a North American version, DON""T BUY THIS!!!!!!. Take care as to not get caught buying this product if Region 1 is needed for your viewing pleasure. Otherwise you will be purchasing what amounts to be some very expensive beverage coasters.",1397001600,11,681,4.628099173553719
8298002,5,B001EGKYZK,"I enjoyed the TV series, only wish I could get the usa version to add to my collection.  One of the best series ever.",1388793600,9,117,3.875
