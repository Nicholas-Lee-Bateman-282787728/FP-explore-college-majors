4084083,5,B0038AN1WI,"I have had this DVD for over a year now and no mention anywhere of when the 80s specials are going to be released. How come? I would like to have all the specials in this one format all in one place instead of having to buy individual discs and end up with overlaps. I thought the Charles Schulz museum people were overseeing these releases.

These programs are of historical value and should be made available.",1309824000,,411,4.407894736842105
4084084,3,B0038AN1WI,"This is a nice set of episodes if you don't already have most of them.  I have the first 3 volumes (60's, 70's 1, 70's 2) and almost all the individual releases trying to get every available episode.  I really don't like it when the DVD companies release complete seasons/volumes and then just stop releasing.  I assume we won't see them continue into the 80's or it would have been out/announced by now being a year since this release and that we only went six months in between the other.

Now I'm stuck with duplicates of almost all these episodes.  A. From buying them previously, and B. now from starting to purchase more individual discs since I've realized they won't be releasing the rest in a comprehensive format anymore.

Just beware...is all.  Plus the fact that the Peanuts Specials have been liscenced to 2 different companies for release, there are 2 versions of most specials out there and alot of them carry different ""bonus"" episodes, so it can be tricky to keep track of it.

Just do some research before you buy if your just starting out collecting...not saying there's anything wrong with this set, just beaware of what's out there to avoid buying the same episodes twice.",1302134400,21,1193,4.701923076923077

4084087,5,B0038AN1WI,"Contains:
* Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown (the classic Valentine's Day special, chronicling Sally's affection for Linus being triumphed by his affections for his teacher)\
* You're a Good Sport, Charlie Brown
* It's Arbor Day, Charlie Brown (Vince Guaraldi's final score on a Peanuts special before his death)
* What a Nightmare, Charlie Brown (very odd special that contains only Charlie Brown and Snoopy, and about 3/4 of it is all Snoopy dreaming about being an arctic sled dog)
* It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown (the little red-haired girl is seen on-screen, and Charlie Brown gets to kiss her!)

4084090,4,B0038AN1WI,"Terrific DVD purchase.  I bought this DVD set for: ""What a Nightmare Charlie Brown,"" a rare show that I recall from my elementary school days.  In this episode (which I only recall seeing twice on TV), Snoopy has a ""Call of the Wild"" experience as an Alaskan sled dog.  My 5 and 6 year old boys absolutely loved it.  They also giggled and squealed their way through ""Charlie Brown's First Kiss"" and are big fans of the other episodes.  Well worth the money.  Good family fun for all.",1289779200,3,483,4.431818181818182
4084091,4,B0038AN1WI,"First the me say to those who already have the 5 previously released specials on DVD, you may want to think twice about buying this just to get ""WHAT A NIGHTMARE, CHARLIE BROWN"".
""Nightmare"" is the first real CLUNKER in the Peanuts specials.  It is not really a Peanuts special as it only features Snoopy, with a guest appearance by Charlie Brown. None of the other kids are there.  You basically have to sit through 20 minutes of Snoopy growling at sled-dogs who are trying to take things away from him.  There is almost no dialog for the middle 20 minutes as the sled-dog owner is an adult who only talks with the sound of a muted trumpet.  ""Nightmare"" would have worked as a brief throw-away segment of another special, much like the Snoopy v.s. Red Baron segment in ""Its The Great Pumpkin"".  There is just not enough to carry an entire 25 minute special.

That said, I will point out the highlights.
""BE MY VALENTINE,CHARLIE BROWN (1975)"" is a true ""classic"", you will never tire of seeing it.  The only thing I find odd about it is that by this time we already know that Peppermint Patty has a crush on Charlie Brown, the very next special continues that one-way romance.  So why does Charlie Brown not receive a Valentine Card from her?  This story seems to happen as if it were earlier in the series.
""YOU'RE A GOOD SPORT, CHARLIE BROWN (1975)"" introduces a new sport to the kids, motocross.  This may be the first attempt to update the series for modern kids. It is still a lot of fun, but lacks that classic quality.
""ITS ARBOR DAY, CHARLIE BROWN (1976)"" is sadly the last special to be scored by the great Vince Guaraldi, his compositions continue to carry you along in this humorous tale of baseball season colliding with tree-planting season.

Is it just a coincidence that the quality of the Peanuts specials take a nosedive with the passing of Vince Guaraldi? I know he was not the director or producer of these specials, but could he have had that much influence on the productions?

""WHAT A NIGHTMARE, CHARLIE BROWN (1977)"" is what you will be saying after watching this mess.  Some of Vince's compositions are repeated here, but most of this poorly conceived film is brandished with synthesizer music (popular in the 1970's). Is the new composer's name really Ed Bogus?
""ITS YOUR FIRST KISS, CHARLIE BROWN (1978)"" suffers from an all-too-serious football game story line & synthesized non-Guaraldi music.  It is still fun to watch, but does not feel like a classic Peanuts Special.  There is just not enough time devoted to fun in this one, the competition is serious.
""YOU'RE THE GREATEST, CHARLIE BROWN (1979)"" continues the sports theme of this set (3 of 6 are sports related) as the gang tries for the Junior Olympics. This one is much more fun to watch & gives hope for the continuing series.  You even start to get used to Ed Bogus' music compositions.

The bonus material about the comic strips in the 1970's tells us nothing new, but it is fun to watch the old home-movies of ""Sparky"" Schulz.  A better bonus would have been a discussion of how to handle the series with the passing of Vince Guaraldi.  There was no mention of his passing in this set.

The series really starts to fall apart with disc #2. And the 1980s would bring about more misses than hits. The series would turn to doing musicals & celebration specials, many are not on DVD.  If these sets continue, there would be two from the 1980's with 7 specials in each set (2 of which are hour long specials).  And none of these, with the possible exception of 1986's HAPPY NEW YEAR, CHARLIE BROWN, is of classic quality.  I could be wrong as I have not seen many of the 1980's specials since their original broadcast, but there may be a reason they are not repeated on TV.  So this 1970's set is the last of the ""classics"".

Oh, and somebody goofed on the disc images of this set, the picture of disc #2 is for ""YOU'RE A GOOD SPORT, CHARLIE BROWN"" which is on disc 1. And the image on disc 1, while a generic shot of Charlie Brown & Snoopy on his doghouse, is for ""ITS A NIGHTMARE, CHARLIE BROWN"" which is on disc 2.",1275696000,22,4103,4.50472334682861
4084092,5,B0038AN1WI,"Peanuts specials are timeless classics with wonderful moral lessons and clean/clever humor that you can't find presented the same way nowadays. The peanuts will always have a more adult sense of awareness but still never lose their innocence. This 1970's Volume 2 Collection will contain the following six remaining specials from the later half of the 1970's on 2 discs:

Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown (Aired: 1/28/1975)
One of the last peanut specials to become a true perennial classic. With Valentine's Day approaching, the gang prepares in various ways. Charlie Brown waits at the mailbox, Linus buys a box of candy for his teacher (while Sally thinks it's for herself), Snoopy puts on a dramatic ""Pawpet"" show, and the school has a Valentine's Day party.

You're A Good Sport Charlie Brown (Aired: 10/28/1975)
Peppermint Patty gets good ol' Chuck to participate in a motocross race which has many challenges, including a mysterious Masked Marvel.

It's Arbor Day, Charlie Brown (Aired: 3/16/1976)
While researching a report on Arbor Day, Sally enlists the gang to turn Charlie Brown's ball field into a garden and orchard, complete with a tree on the pitcher's mound and scarecrow in the outfield. During the first game of the season against Peppermint Patty's team, the plants turn out to be an unexpected advantage. This lesser appreciated classic is still shown in most elemtary schools on Arbor day.

It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown (Aired: 10/24/1977)
Charlie Brown must escort the Little Red-Haired Girl to the homecoming dance, even though he has trouble kicking the ball during the homecoming football game.

What A Nightmare, Charlie Brown! (Aired: 2/23/1978)
Making it's DVD debut on this set. Having eaten too much, Snoopy dreams he's an Alaskan sled dog. (I don't know why but this has always been a personal favorite).

You're The Greatest, Charlie Brown (Aired: 3/19/1979)
Charlie Brown participates in the Junior Olympics Decathlon, competing against several other contestants, including the Masked Marvel.

Also included in this set is an all new featurette: ""You're Groovy, Charlie Brown: A Look At Peanuts in the 70's""

These specials are being presented remastered, and so far have looked great, in their original Full Frame video format with English Mono Audio. There are also English subtitles.

I grew up in the nineties but still grew up watching these specials. Not only did I enjoy the perennial classics that aired each holiday but I enjoyed all the other specials. I vividly remember watching, What A Nightmare, Charlie Brown!, and being drawn in by the minimal amount of dialogue. I'd give anything that makes the Peanut specials available five stars but I can't recommend these particular sets highly enough for fans who finally want to own all the specials in nicely done chronological sets.

These specials are all classics and are perfect for parents looking for suitable programming for their children or for adults who grew up watching them and want a chance to reminisce on past days and simpler times. Now fans can start looking forward to Peanuts: 1980's Collection 1 (which should contain She's A Good Skate, Charlie Brown through to at least the one hour special, A Charlie Brown Celebration).

4084129,5,B0038AN1WI,"This is Volume 2 of the 1970's Peanuts specials. Lee Mendelson and Bill Melendez took proper care of Charles Schulz's characters. I personally prefer Vince Guaraldi's soundtracks over Ed Bogas', but I think Mr. Bogas did a good job on them, especially the special It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown.

Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown- Snoopy's ""paw-pet"" show is a real treat, but not for Lucy. Linus buys an expensive heart-shaped box of chocolates for his teacher Miss Othmar (which Sally thinks is for her) and Charlie Brown is hopeful to get his share of valentines. In fairness to dog owners, please don't let your dog eat chocolates but enjoy this classic anyways.

You're A Good Sport, Charlie Brown- Snoopy plays a tennis match and the game between him and his opponent is really close. Charlie Brown is encouraged by Peppermint Patty to enter the motorcross. He and the ""Masked Marvel"" have a freak accident. Since ""Chuck"" (or ""Charles"") loses his helmet, Linus quickly prepares a homemade pumpkin shell helmet and the race is on again!

It's Arbor Day, Charlie Brown- The gang dedicates a baseball field to Charlie Brown, which is more like a victory garden! Peppermint Patty challenges her buddy ""Chuck"" to a baseball game and Lucy dares to hit a home run, while Schroeder reluctanly promises Miss Van Pelt a kiss if she does. A moment of silence, as this was Vince Guaraldi's final music score.

What A Nightmare, Charlie Brown- This is basically Snoopy's story, with appearances by master Charlie Brown at the beginning and the ending. Charlie Brown plays bobsled with Snoopy and tells him things wouldn't be so hot if he were a real bobsled dog. Snoopy has a dream that night and in his dream, he must survive the cold, raw fish and some tough huskies twice his size.

It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown- Charlie Brown is supposed to give his beloved little red-haired girl a kiss. But before that, he has one misadventure after another (and guess who's holding the football for him to kick?). 1st special featuring Ed Bogas and 1st ever appearance of the little red-haired girl.

You're The Greatest, Charlie Brown- Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Marcie and an obnoxious, arrogant jock named Freddie Fabulous all compete in a track triathlon. With the proper training, Charlie Brown proves to do pretty good.

The special, You're Groovy, Charlie Brown, features interviews with family members and discusses the cartoon strips in the 1970's (back when the word ""groovy"" was used pretty liberally).

All in all, if you loved the Peanuts specials, you'll enjoy this collection. Five cents, please!",1423612800,2,2600,4.947247706422019
4084130,3,B0038AN1WI,"Note:  My philosophy on cartoons/comics is that they should be humorous, yet also serve as social commentary.... revealing the truth around us in a way that challenges our thinking and societal accepted norms.  I therefore look in each of these episodes for strong story lines that anyone can follow, humor that will connect to a wide range of ages, and something profound under the silliness.

Each of the episodes is reviewed below:

Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown -
Episode focuses on giving out valentines cards and gifts during class.  This is one of my least favorite Peanuts episodes for four reasons: Charlie brown gets no valentines and how he is treated by the other students is flat-out bullying.. in the end they give him a used valentine a day late and only was done out of guilt and not out of true concern for Charlie brown.  Three characters during the course of the show act out on their anger... Lucy destroys Schroeder's piano, Linus throws candy while yelling, and Charlie brown throws a box, a briefcase, and hits a mailbox.  Linus is in infatuated with the teacher and runs around trying to give her a fancy gift chocolate box gift only to discover she has a boyfriend.  Snoopy eats the chocolate thrown by Linus but in reality chocolate kills dogs (and you don't want kids to think its ok to give dogs chocolate for even a millisecond).  Overall, I can't recommend this episode and I will not be re-watching it.  I would give it 0 stars if i could.

You're a Good Sport, Charlie Brown -
This episode focuses on sports.  There is no overarching story to the episode.  First, Snoopy plays tennis against Woodstock.  In this section, I don't like how Snoopy acts when the game ties and when he ultimately loses - Snoopy beats his racket in the ground, runs angrily into the net, and ends up destroying two rackets.  Second, there is a very small bit of football between Charlie and Linus... then the usual Lucy pulls the football away from Charlie Brown and he flies onto his back.  Third, Peppermint Patty tells everyone that the new in thing to do is Motorcross.  Charlie and Linus buy a joint motorcycle to race (of course number 13).  During the race, two contestants crash and Charlie ends up at the vets and Snoopy at the human hospital... when Charlie wakes, both him and Snoopy return to the race.  When Charlie is thirsty during the race, Sally brings a cold drink over and drinks it herself in front of her brother.  All the contestants end up stuck somewhere on the course or their motorcycles give out... so in the end, Charlie Brown wins and earns free haircuts which he does not need.  Linus says all that matters is trying your best.  Lastly, Charlie Brown hits the baseball diamond thinking he is on a winning streak only to get hit by a ball and have his clothes fly off.  Overall, this episode has no real point and feels rambling.  Further, there was nothing profound, I didn't laugh even once, and I don't like the anger sown in Snoopy at the start of the episode (even if some tennis stars act that way it should not be shown as appropriate with kids).  I give this episode 1 stars because the only thing worth anything was how Marcie cut off all the people she was interviewing.

It's Arbor Day, Charlie Brown -
Episode focuses on Arbor day.  The kids decide to turn the baseball diamond into a garden filled with vegetables, flowers, trees, and vines... and they do not tell Charlie Brown their plans.  Charlie never checks in on the progress of getting the field ready for baseball season, so he is in for quite a surprise.  The havoc from having a garden/orchard for a baseball field actually may give Charlie's team an advantage and perhaps their first win?.. if it only they can keep the rain at bay.  Overall, I find this to be the funniest of the Peanuts episodes.  It also opens the door to discussing ecological issues and the ratio of human development to green belts/vegetation.  I give the episode 5 stars and its the only reason why bought the DVD Peanuts 1970's Collection Volume 2.

What A Nightmare, Charlie Brown -
Episode has Charlie Brown wanting Snoopy to pretend to be a sled dog and take him for a sleigh ride.  This fuels a nightmare in which Snoopy is forced to be a sleigh dog in the arctic and fight for dominance in the pack.  Overall, I don't like this episode at all and skip it completely.  I give it 0 stars.

It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown -
Episode appears to be about homecoming weekend.  First comes is a parade, then a football game, and finally a school dance/ball.  Charlie Brown is to escort the beauty queen to the ball and apparently part of the tradition is for him to give her a kiss on the cheek... and the beauty queen just happens to be the famous red-haired girl he likes.  So he is pretty nervous.  During the football game Lucy keeps removing the ball and not letting Charlie kick it (somehow no one notices she is pulling the ball away).  Because of Lucy, Charlie is not able to make the extra points so they lose the game.  At the ball, even Lucy joins in to mock Charlie on his failure and tells him he does not deserve to be at the ball or escort the beauty queen.  Charlie sticks it through and kisses the queen on the cheek.  Even though Charlie was the best dancer at the party and won over all the girls at the dance, but Charlie remember none of it not even his first kiss.  Overall, this episode is not entertaining and I am disgusted that Lucy would bully Charlie knowing full well she caused him not to make any points.  I found the episode to be pointless and will not watch again.  I give it 0 stars.

You're the Greatest, Charlie Brown -
Episode is about a track meet and Charlie Brown signs up for the decathlon.  First he has to train and he puts in his best effort.  Then he completes in the track meet and gives it his best.  Marcie and Charlie Brown encourage each other throughout the competition and show great sportsmanship.  Charlie is in position to win but then he closes his eyes, imagines the taste of victory, and runs right off the track and into the forest beyond... thus losing the race and the decathlon.  In the end, Marcie ended up winning the decathlon and thanks Charlie for being a great competitor and a gentleman.  Overall, I liked that this episode had a clear story and lessons on perseverance, good sportsmanship, and not getting ahead of yourself.  There was some humor but not as much in other episodes.  I rate this episode 4 stars.",1423094400,5,6474,4.504288164665523
