5012149,1,B006P59AM8,"The first sentence of the movie description is that its about ""Permaculture"". The only thing that really had permaculture in it was David Holmgren wearing a Permaculture t-shirt and less than 90 seconds of footage showing people digging in backyards with little explanation. There is no ""HOW"", but a LOT of bitching. Yes, we know there is a problem with resources, sum it up in 15-20 minutes, don't just drag on without showing some potential solutions on how to reverse the process. Show me HOW, not just WHY.

I really wanted to show this to my Aquaponics/Permaculture group and recommend it to my alma mater, but I'm afraid anyone I show this to will be repelled from the ideas based in this movie.

The only useful information I received was watching Michael Reynolds for the few short minutes he was on and his Earthships, and I HIGHLY recommend GARBAGE WARRIOR if you want to see people DOING instead of sitting around theorizing.

Very disappointing.",1328313600,8,957,4.823170731707317
5012150,1,B006P59AM8,"Basically I can sum up this inadequate waste of time with one of my favorite bumper stickers.  ""Save the planet, kill yourself"".  No mention of free energy systems at all, not one.  This is really just propaganda and leaves out many other potential reasons for dramatic earth changes.  Ask yourself why, just why, you can find palm tree seeds in Antarctica?  why, because the earth expands and the land portion of Antarctica was once sub-tropical.  Please do some research, free energy is real and has the potential to radically change economies and to free people too.  I did enjoy the earth ship homes but the rest is just too much.  Also, why do we find CO2 in the bottom of coal mines?  Think about that.",1326499200,4,708,4.6
5012151,5,B006P59AM8,"This is one of the most important documentaries on the market.
This along with a few others can change your view of the world and move you into a new direction in life. Some others that people need to see are.

1. Micheal Rupert's Collapse

2. Daniel Pinchbeck's 2012 Time For Change  Don't worry it's not an end of the world show

3. Escape From Suburbia - Beyond the American Dream",1325462400,11,383,4.352112676056338

8502627,3,B006P59AM8,"I was expecting better scenes and visuals. It is a movie afterall.  After reading the mixed reviews I decided to go ahead and spend the money to rent this movie anyway.  It was ok, but don't expect much to look at while being talked to.  I gave 3 stars for the people in this documentary and their good messages. You aren't missing anything special if you do not watch it, especially if you have a good understanding of the topic and have watched other documentaries on permaculture and/or sustainability.",1365465600,,505,4.651685393258427

8502629,5,B006P59AM8,"The film is another brave attempt to spark the curiosity of individuals everywhere. What can we do? There is plenty of blame to go around, this film moves the viewer toward solutions. WE can help shift the direction humanity is heading. There are individuals that have already spent decades exploring better ways to live. Many of them can be found in Anima Mundi.",1330041600,3,363,4.777777777777778
8502630,5,B006P59AM8,"This documentary is inspiring and nicely animated. The speakers lead you into deep thoughts about the connection we have with the earth. The film illustrates a very good alternative for growing our food. I really like permaculture, and i hoped to see more inside information into permaculture, but there are enough other documentary's explaining how to start doing it. It's about the message and moral of the movie, which awakens a consciousness about the roots of our nature and the earth, especially to those who are less connected with nature.",1330041600,2,546,5.0777777777777775
8502631,1,B006P59AM8,"I waited so long for this film and it was mostly talk and no substance, it was very repetitive and didn't really teach you any thing which is really disappointing given some of the amazing people who were featured on the program.",1328918400,4,229,4.476190476190476
8502632,5,B006P59AM8,"The best documentary of its type. Informative and inspirational this film walks you through minimizing your carbon foot print in a practical way - Permaculture. A must see for anyone trying to escape the ""system"" and live their own sustainable life.",1328659200,5,249,5.097560975609756
8502633,5,B006P59AM8,"this film has inspired me to a way of thinking for the future, not to talk about, but to take action on what we are doing to our world. permaculture is an outstanding way to minimise our impact and to live sustainable lives. This film is a must see for anyone who cares about the world, and would like to watch a masterpiece of filming genius while they are at it...",1328659200,5,366,4.169014084507042
8502634,5,B006P59AM8,"Many people do not realize that permaculture is much more than about growing fruit and vegetables, it is a whole view incorporating the environment, energy, resources, housing, technology, education, healthcare, the arts, spirituality, psychology, philosophy and agriculture. It provides a realistic alternative for our future sustainability, a gentler way that treads lightly on our Mother Earth. Anima Mundi is not a ""How To"" video, it is a ""Where To"" documentary showcasing alternatives like Earthship's, Permaculture, Permablitz, retrofitting the suburbs, lifeboats, localized food production and currency's, planned energy decent and Gaian philosophy. Overall, Anima Mundi is a positive film though it's deep message could be missed by many in a world society that believe human's are wrong, evil and bad. To quote John Seed, ""Whatever we're doing to the Earth, the Earth is doing to Herself"". If humans are a part of nature then what we are doing is natural, yet not all things 'natural' are good for us, like mercury.

And many people do not realize that Anima Mundi is not a big budget documentary, it was put together by one person with little money, no industry connections, a clapped out car and a home-video camera. As a production, Anima Mundi fits within many permaculture principles; it has a very low embodied energy, it took minimal resources to produce, I made do with what was local and/or at hand, and I grew something that has flourished from what was once a barren landscape. Anima Mundi is not a film that offers false-hope solutions, it is a practical film about the nature of reality, and the harsh and beautiful reality of nature. And for my first documentary, I think it came up pretty good!

As a last word, I'm having trouble deciding what rating I need to give the film, obviously being the film's maker I won't give it 1 star, and giving one's work 5 stars seems less than humble, but according to Amazon, 5 stars is for 'I love it' and as an artist I do love my creation.

8502635,5,B006P59AM8,"I loved this film! It is a beautifully filmed look at what our culture has become and why we need to change the way we view the Earth if we are to continue to live, not only upon Her, but as a part of the self-regulating organism that is Gaia. The film uniquely fuses vintage footage with contemporary interviews and breathtaking nature shots to deliver what is ultimately a message of hope for those who are ready to listen. It does not present ""airy fairy"" solutions to our modern dilemma, but instead presents a practical and scientific way of relating to the earth on which we hope to continue to live. The film is initially slow to find it's rhythm, but sweeps you into the journey when it does. The soundtrack is original, dramatic and moving in turn. Ultimately, at the end of this engaging film, you feel inspired to work for Gaia inc. A wonderful first film from Mr Downey. I hope for a sequel!",1328400000,3,903,4.445783132530121
