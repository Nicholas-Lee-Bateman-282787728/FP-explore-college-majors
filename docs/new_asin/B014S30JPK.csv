7420911,3,B014S30JPK,Yawn ....  Reality shows have so darned little reality about them ...  These people are either dumb as rocks or the Network thinks viewers are dumb as rocks.  ...  Hope they're making good money from the Network. ..  Maybe they can get that girl's front teeth fixed...,1445558400,,268,4.617021276595745

7420914,5,B014S30JPK,"I am utterly fascinated by this series that follows the Brown family: Billy, Ami, and their 5 grown sons and 2 younger daughters who live in the Alaskan Bush. At first, I thought this family must be crazy and hopelessly ignorant. The kids have grown up literally in the wild. They have odd accents. In the beginning they are all living in one room. Before long, though, I realized that they are genuine, intelligent, fiercely devoted to this life they've chosen. Ami Brown, gentle, soft- spoken, has raised 7 children in incredible conditions. When you hear her speak, you know immediately that she is intelligent, and has effectively home-schooled these children. They can, presumably, all read and write, and they are skilled builders, inventors, hunters. Billy and Ami's devotion to each other is touching. They are quirky, of course; they haven't socialized with other people much. They have an innocence only isolation can give them. But then, really, how important IS it that we know about the lives of everybody in Hollywood? Their pleasures are simple: watching OLD movies on dvd at night. They work tirelessly and hard for their very survival. They have been doing it for over 30 years by Choice. I'm a fan. I hope we get to observe this family's lives for many years to come.",1441497600,15,1285,4.845454545454546

7420923,5,B014S30JPK,"I love this show! Each person has his/her own uniqueness that I find so interesting (although Bam could lighten up a bit!).. I look forward to the show every week and have bought all the seasons. Only Season 1 is on DVD, but the rest are on Instant Video and I have all those too. I'm pretty squeamish when it comes to butchering the deer, but other than that, I love this series!",1449446400,5,380,4.219178082191781
7420924,1,B014S30JPK,"The show starts out claiming:

""Deep in the Alaskan wilderness lives a newly discovered family who was born and raised wild. Billy Brown, his wife Ami and their seven grown children - 5 boys and 2 girls - are so far removed from civilization that they often go six to nine months of the year without seeing an outsider. Recently, according to the Browns, the cabin where they lived for years was seized and burned to the ground for being in the wrong location on public land. They were devastated, but instead of giving up and moving back to society, they decided to go deeper into the wilderness to continue their way of life. Their new land is located in the Copper River Valley,""

None of this was true.

Before season one, the Brown family lived in Texas and Colorado. They had admitted it in Alaska State Court. There was no ""cabin"" burned to the ground"". They did not move ""deeper into the wilderness"" to make this show. In the first season, they moved into a five acre lot just outside of town and within short walking distance of a store. There were houses right next to them.

They have no wilderness skills. They can't even hunt or do simple construction. Toward the end, they accuse the real Alaskans who live in the Copper River Valley of trying to kill them. That was a lie too. Their neighbors built the cabin you see toward the end of season one for them. But the Browns left because they don't have the skills to even live in a cabin through the winter.

The show provides goofy scripted family comedy. Its fine for what it is. Just don't get tricked into thinking any of whats being shown is real.",1448841600,6,1614,4.4391891891891895
