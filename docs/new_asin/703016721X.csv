7899402,5,703016721X,"The most underrated film by French master Robert Bresson, ""The Trial of Joan of Arc"" is taken from the trial transcript (as was
Dreyer's very different movie). An understated performance by Florence Delay as a wonderfully defiant Joan depicts her as a significant historical figure, but also an oddly modern one. Joan of Arc helped France to win The Hundred Years War, and Bresson considered her history's greatest hero. ""The Trial of Joan of Arc"" stands in stark contrast to Carl Dreyer's view of Joan in ""The Passion of Joan of Arc""; both protagonists are fierce defenders of the faith, but Bresson's Joan is an archetypal hero.",1418169600,2,630,4.897196261682243
7899403,5,703016721X,"Catholicism and imprisonment are two themes that permeate all 13 of Robert Bresson's films and it's no surprise that in 1962 he made The Trial of Joan of Arc (Procs de Jeanne d'Arc). One of some 40 other adaptations of the same story it must be by some distance the most austere, the starkest, the most honest, the most factual and perhaps the most moving of them all. It is always compared with Dreyer's justly famous version The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928) mostly to its disadvantage, however I feel both are too different to be compared. They are equally stunning in their own ways. Bresson famously dissed Dreyer's work despising the actors' ""grotesque buffooneries"", but then he professed to hate everyone's films except his own and his opinion is not to be taken too seriously.

Joan of Arc's story is oft-told, but it's perhaps wise to remind ourselves of the basic facts (sullied as they have been particularly in Hollyweird versions). Joan was born c. 1412 and died at the age of 19 on 30th May, 1431. Her crime was heresy (she had claimed to have seen visions of the Almighty), but actually she was sentenced to be burned at the stake for political reasons. She supported Charles VII to recover France from the English invaders during the Hundred Years' War. She had famously taken a prominent role (historians dispute how prominent) in the relief of the Siege of Orlans in 1430, was captured and handed over to the English who arranged a kangaroo court presided over by the Bishop of Beauvais Pierre Cauchon with a panel of England-supporting priests who were certain to pronounce her guilty. 25 years after her death at the stake Pope Callixtus III pronounced her innocent and declared her a martyr. She was beatified by the Roman Catholic Church in 1909 and canonized in 1920. She is one of 9 patron saints of France. Known as `The Maid of Orlans', she is now not only a Roman Catholic Saint, but also a heroine of France, a national symbol of freedom. The French Resistance during World War II and Charles de Gaulle's French government in exile used the Cross of Lorraine (the symbol for Joan) in their flag. Robert Bresson fought for the Resistance and was imprisoned for a year by the Nazis - facts that made the making of this film an inevitability.

The first thing to take on board about Bresson's film is the way it is based on the real transcript of Joan's trial. The questions she is asked and the answers she gives are verbatim from the transcript. Secondly, Bresson and his regular cameraman L. H. Burel shoot the film straight as a documentary record of the trial punctuated by brief scenes in her cell. The camera stares unremittingly at Joan (Florence Delay) and her inquisitor Cauchon (Jean-Claude Fourneau) as the questions are fired rapidly and answered in a monotone. Bresson deploys his usual amateur `models' (his last film to use professional actors had been Les dames du Bois de Boulogne [1945]) to render their monosyllabic utterances entirely void of artificial melodrama. We see a dour old man fire his catechism at a poor defenceless 19 year old virgin and our hearts are touched in the most direct manner possible. Thirdly, Bresson makes inspired use of off-screen sound. We hear (but never see) the crowd milling around shouting their accusations at various points. It is significant that the antagonisms are hurled in English while the trial takes place in French. Fourthly, the brief scenes in Joan's cell are used not to relate respite from her ordeal, but rather to pour further humiliation onto the victim. She is spied at voyeuristically through holes in the wall, tied to her bed with chains and vaginally-inspected to determine if she really is a virgin. She is forced to squat on a bare wooden seat as if it were a toilet and is stared at pitilessly by English lords ogling her flesh and baying for her blood. Bresson's cold austere treatment is unrelenting in its effect on both the victim and the audience so that although we have been watching for just 60 minutes, when we are led to the stake and the fire is lit we feel we have been watching for hours. With her death comes a huge sense of release. As Joan expires she looks at the crucifix dangling in front of her on a pole (at her request) and we know that though flesh may perish the spirit lives on.

This Artificial Eye DVD is excellent. The visuals are crystal-clear, enhanced for widescreen and with excellent b/w resolution. The sound is Dolby Digital Mono 2.0 and is probably as good as it can be. It's a short film and there are some 27 minutes of extras which are good - interviews with Bresson, Florence Delay, Andre Malraux and George Duby/Laure Adler; a French TV documentary on the background of Joan. A powerful film very well-presented, it is essential Robert Bresson.",1411430400,3,4793,4.703571428571428
7899404,5,703016721X,"I bought the region 2 format DVD and could only watch it a couple of times before Windows would not let me change back to the format for this area (The U.S.).  I am dying to get a DVD in the NTSC format so I can watch it freely!  It is historically very interesting - the actual transcripts of her trial (the questions that were asked of her and the actual answers that she gave!!!) are used to make this movie.  I love that.  To know exactly how she answered.  How smart and sincere she was indeed.

If anyone knows where I can get the NTSC version, please let me know.  I would buy it in a heartbeat.

This movie should be on everyone's ""Bucket List"".

7899406,5,703016721X,"Using the words of the trial it is amazing that a simple peasant girl could measure wits and hold her own intellectually against an array educated sophisticated churchmen and were it not for political expediency perhaps have confounded them all.

The outcome was preordained but the attempts of her judges to to try and trap her into admissions and Joan's adroitness make for a fascinating interplay.

Joan's faith and belief in her divine mission confounded the cynicism of her judges she received a posthumous pardon....the film can't answer questions about Joan herself...where did a illiterate girl get the confidence to address the dauphin, win over experienced hard bitten men-at-arms and lead an army;where did she get the courage to face her accusers and not recant,how could she write to the Hussites and threaten them with a crusade...yet her words ring out to us over the centuries...a stark film, black and white, carefully crafted leaving the viewers to form form their own opinions...thought provoking",1349740800,4,1015,5.220858895705521
7899407,5,703016721X,"Although the DVD is non-USA format one can watch it on a computer.  This info would be helpful to the seller as some may not buy it because it is listed as non-USA format.  Now to the movie.  The movie somewhat adheres to the facts of Joan's trial the diretor could have added a 15 or 20 extra minutes which would have given the movie a better feel for the trial and for Joan.  The biggest complaint I have is the director did not bother to have his movie Joan look haggard after 5+ months of being jailed, underfed, mistreated and emotionally abused.  She looked as good on the day of her death as she did at the start of her trial. On the plus side though the trial in this movie is better than the popular movies about Joan; it has the advantage though of spending more time on that segment of her life.",1301011200,5,806,4.174193548387096
7899408,5,703016721X,"First at all, try by all your means to establish any comparison of this peculiar version of this Joan of Arc respect Carl Theodor Dreyer, because of the fact that Dreyer makes a powerful visual metaphor, a vigorous homage, an apology of the epic struggling and possibly the employment most expressive close ups never filmed previous or lately. The eyes of Falconetti not only reveal but embody the horrid martyr.

The very fact to carry on stage this painful, decisive and abominable crime on Joan of Arc still maintains all its flaming crudeness into the annals of what we might the primordial conscious of many people around the world. And Bresson - better than no one - made of this film an austere but incandescent reminder around a true legend and one of the most emblematic figures the humanity has kept in silent complicity for explainable reasons. This nasty crime still remains an open wound, another original sin that in hands of this unique and inimitable filmmaker (the greatest of all,to my mind) acquires a sidereal and poetic dimension.

Bresson wishes before than nothing, to establish a duel between Joan and the Bishop Cauchon, leaving aside the Englishmen and the priests as silent witnesses. His basic premise is to suggest the things and feelings, and the only requisite he wants is you -as spectator- brings your capacity of feeling.

In the famous interview of Bresson given to Andrew Sarris in 1962 Cannes he makes some clever indications. For instance, the reason why there's a  sequence in which we watch the dress burning, has just one purpose; not letting relics; on the other hand we may realize for instance the scene in which the dog that cross in the middle makes us realize that something abnormal is happening. That dramatic premise will be used by Tarkovski in the personal immolation of Domenico in Nostalgia.

It's useless to affirm we are in front of these superb and privileged masterworks in the history of cinema. More than a movie or an entertainment device, this is one these films that makes us to remind the cinema is an art, and not a mere vehicle of entertainment for the weekend or a symbol of quotidian evasion.

Robert Bresson died in 1999, but his very brief legacy will be matter of discussion for the next centuries to come.

A genius of major label.",1196726400,8,2303,4.785894206549118
