8229471,5,B000XSKS4M,"I'm a fan of the Lick Library series and especially the ones featuring Danny Gill. He's an excellent teacher and this is one of my favorites of all the Lick Library videos I've seen so far. Most tutorials on alternate picking tend to just have a series of exercises but in this DVD, Gill has written 3 songs (beginner, intermediate and advance) centered around the alternate picking approach. They are in a style similar to a slowed down version of old Vinnie Moore or Tony MacAlpine songs so when you learned them all you've developed your picking technique and have something you could actually play for someone. Though simple they are still interesting harmonically with a variety of chord changes rather than just couple of power chords. They've become one of my main warm up rituals.",1311984000,,788,4.801470588235294
