5435668,5,B00AIQKG2S,"If you're starting a collection of classic movies on DVD or just want to revisit some of your favorites, you really can't go wrong with the 20-film ""Best of"" boxes from Warner Bros. Released to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the studio's founding, they span the gamut from early to modern, from musical to thriller, and from comedy to romance. They feature many of Hollywood's greatest stars and are offered at relatively low cost. Housed in three plastic cases within a glossy paperboard box, they come with a booklet containing a photo and a brief synopsis for each film. Most of the discs offer commentaries by historians and participants, or making-of featurettes, or additional scenes and outtakes.

This set of thrillers starts with James Cagney in ""The Public Enemy"" (1931). It includes two Humphrey Bogart vehicles of the 1940s (""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""The Big Sleep""), two Alfred Hitchcock classics of the 1950s (""North by Northwest,"" starring Cary Grant, and ""Strangers on a Train""), and two antihero films of the 1970s (""Dirty Harry,"" starring Clint Eastwood, and Sidney Lumet's ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" starring Al Pacino).

Films from the 1990s compose the bulk of the collection. My favorites are Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas,"" with Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci; ""The Fugitive,"" with Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones; ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" with Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman; and ""L.A. Confidential,"" with a great ensemble cast led by Kevin Spacey and Russell Crowe. Several exceptionally dark and violent films are among these features: ""Natural Born Killers,"" ""Seven,"" and ""American History X."" There are three recent releases: ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Inception"" from director Christopher Nolan and ""The Town"" from actor/director Ben Affleck.

While not all of the 20 films are strictly speaking thrillers, they are filled with thrilling moments, popular among filmgoers, and well-received by critics. Representing the work of iconic actors and directors, this is great cinema at a very reasonable price. Highly recommended!",1387324800,21,2062,5.338461538461538

Released to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the studio's founding, they span the gamut from early to recent, from musical to thriller, and from comedy to romance. They feature many of Hollywood's greatest idols and are offered at a very reasonable cost. Housed in three plastic cases within a glossy paperboard box, they come with a booklet containing a photo and a brief synopsis for each film. Most of the discs also present commentaries by historians and participants, or making-of featurettes, or additional scenes and outtakes.

This set starts in 1938 with Bette Davis and Henry Fonda in ""Jezebel"" and wraps up with the Richard Gere-Diane Lane movie ""Nights in Rodanthe"" in 2008. Not all of these romances are essential, particularly the fluffy Sandra Bullock vehicles ""Two Weeks Notice"" in 2002 and ""The Lake House"" in 2006 (costing the set a star in my rating), but there's so much good stuff here: ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""Doctor Zhivago"" (both two-DVD sets), ""Casablanca"" and ""The Philadelphia Story,"" ""Rebel without a Cause"" and ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.""

Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh, Omar Sharif and Julie Christie, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn, James Dean and Natalie Wood, Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor: these pairings made folks swoon and personified glamour in their day and in ours. You'll be amazed at how well two films produced in 1942, the same year as ""Casablanca,"" hold up today: ""Mrs. Miniver,"" with Greer Garson, set in World War II England, and ""Now, Voyager,"" with Bette Davis, which won her a sixth Oscar nomination for best actress.

There's music in ""Annie Get Your Gun"" and ""A Star Is Born,"" Warren Beatty's screen debut in ""Splendor in the Grass,"" and from the 1970s, unconventional leading men in George Segal (""A Touch of Class"") and Richard Dreyfuss (""The Goodbye Girl""). You can recall the splash that Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner made in the cheesy film ""The Bodyguard"" and that Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks made in the thankfully less cheesy ""You've Got Mail,"" both in the 1990s. While all 20 movies feature romantic storylines, a number of them are not strictly speaking romances. But there are many examples of great cinema in this box, and if you can pick it up on sale, as I did this week ($23 new), you'll be glad you did. Recommended!",1387324800,15,2505,4.834498834498834
5435670,5,B00AIQKG2S,"This set of 20 films spans over 60 years of Warner Bros. Studio filmmaking (1931-2012).  There's no denying that Warner Bros. was a powerful and influential studio in the early days of the movie business; and I'd say they are the best studio at finding talented filmmakers and giving them the resources to execute their visions - Hitchcock, Scorsese, Fincher, Nolan... need I say more?

As a product of the 90s, I might be a bit biased toward the modern classics - but my favorite movies among the bunch are ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""L.A. Confidential"", and ""Inception"".  As far as living up the the name of thriller, I think ""Seven"" is by far the single most unsettling film of the bunch, while I find both ""Heat"" and ""The Town"" to be very effective crime films.

One of the advantages of a box set like this is that the studio has essentially curated their best work in a genre into one collection.  This allows easy access to a lot of quality films, while at the same time maintaining the vast diversity and differences between the individual titles (the films are arranged in chronological order, so you can easily mark the passage of time and see filmmaking techniques mature).  Obviously the quality of movies greatly differs, but I wouldn't say there is a bad movie in the bunch - each one has its merits.  I wouldn't necessarily classify all twenty of these films as thrillers - some I would call dramas first, while others are straight action movies... but they all have thrilling and exciting aspects that make them worthy of inclusion in a ""Thriller""-based box set.

My additonal observations on the set:
- There is quite a slant toward more modern films - 11 of the 20 titles were released after the year 1990, and only 5 prior to 1960.
- I enjoy how eclectic the movies are visually... you can watch ""The Maltese Falcon"", a black-and-white film shot in 1.37:1; and then pop in the disc for ""The Shawshank Redemption"", which uses color and the widescreen format brilliantly.
- 8 of the movies were Best Picture Nominees at the Academy Awards (although none of them won the prize).
- 8 of the films are currently in the IMDb Top 100 - ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has the #1 spot on the list.
- Only two filmmakers have more than one film included in this collection: Alfred Hithcock and Christopher Nolan.
- Many great movie stars appear in the set.  In particular, I love how Pacino is featured in ""Dog Day Afternoon"", while de Niro is seen in ""Goodfellas"".  Then the two iconic actors appear on screen together in ""Heat"" (1995).
- Clint Eastwood, who spent the majority of his career at Warner Bros, has just one film included here (to be fair, WB has put out plenty of Eastwood box sets in the past).
- It's interesting to see the the two different interpretations of Batman -- both Burton's and Nolan's take are included here in ""Batman"" (1989) and ""The Dark Knight"" (2008).
- While several films spawned franchises, such as ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""Dirty Harry"", then only sequel included in this set is ""The Dark Knight"".

This set is the way to go if you like suspenseful and thrilling movies.  But if you want a more general mix of films, I'd highly suggest this set:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-of-Warner-Bros-20-Film-Coll-Best-Pictures/dp/B009L0I8JK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best of Warner Bros 20 Film Coll: Best Pictures</a>.",1385942400,14,3400,4.883680555555555
