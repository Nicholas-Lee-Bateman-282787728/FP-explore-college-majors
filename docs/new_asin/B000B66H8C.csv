8082222,1,B000B66H8C,"I waded through two of the nine episodes of this, and those were enough.  This is the worst, most inept documentary series I've ever seen.  Consider the following:

""Curse of the Mayan Gold""  First of all, there was nothing in this about a curse.  That word was just thrown in, apparently, to hook curious readers.  The one and a half-hour ""adventure"" was about two young men who go to Yucatan in an attempt to discover what happened to two German adventurers in 1937.  For about an hour the young men go about in very brief and tight shorts.  They have with them inflatable power boats, expensive scuba equipment, backpacks, etc., and they talk to locals, wade swamps, inspect caves, and whip around in their power boats, until the father of one of the boys arrives, and then they do it all some more.  It was a kind of Hardy Boys in Yucatan, except they never discover anything except an old shoe and a broken camera.

""Montezuma's Lost Gold""  The set-up for this is a fictitious story about the Aztecs seeking a place to hide their gold from Cortez's men and going clear to present-day Utah before they found a good place.  Wasm't there anywhere closer?  There is no mention of ""La Noche Triste"" when Spaniards fled across the causeway from Tenochtitlan.  They were laden with gold stolen from the Aztecs and were attacked by the locals.  The gold was jettisoned and may still be under Mexico City.  But in this episode two young adventurers are trying to find what happened to two prison escapees who found and took the gold in Utah more than a century ago.  Again, the young men have an abundance of expensive climbing gear, jet skis, a camper, four-wheel drive SUVs, etc., and again they come up empty handed.  No gold or proof there ever was any.

This is a worthless set of three DVDs, if the two episodes I saw are representative of the rest.  Save your money.",1301702400,4,1869,4.555555555555555
