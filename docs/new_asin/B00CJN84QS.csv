8582667,5,B00CJN84QS,Great story telling of a team of hearing impaired youths who want to play baseball and strive for the national championship. Good characters and lessons about sportsmanship and cooperation for a winning spirit.,1468627200,,210,5.393939393939394
8582668,5,B00CJN84QS,"As with all ""Based on a true story"" movies you never know the parts that are closest to the actual events. Even if this had been only been some screenwriter's creation it still would have been a sweet, touching movie that made you cheer for the team. (The cynic in me is glad they didn't dwell on or possibly make up a relationship between the music teacher and the coach. That shouldn't have been a part of this particular story even though I enjoyed them together.) I have told others about this movie and I will watch it again.",1432944000,,530,4.363636363636363
8582669,5,B00CJN84QS,"Sang-nam is a renowned baseball star with a quickly failing career, especially after his most recent drunken altercation. Sang-nam is given the opportunity to redeem himself by coaching a hearing impaired high school team, and he reluctantly agrees. Glove is a mesmerizing and touching film.

The story in this film has been done before; the story and character arcs are very familiar. A reluctant, grumpy down on his luck athlete, an opportunity for redemption, an underdog team shooting for the stars, etc.; but, does that make it any less compelling? Of course not. The story is deep and will hit home for many viewers; it's motivational, as well as thought-provoking. Some scenes will make you laugh, some scenes will make you angry, and some scenes will make you cheer. The performances are all feel very authentic, which add to the emotion. The ending of the film is memorable, and may even be a bit unexpected for some viewers. The music in the film was great, really matched the tone of the film.

Overall, Glove is a powerful, compelling, and even triumphant film. It's a story that may feel familiar, but manages to have an identity of it's own by the end. As of 3/9/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, although a purchase is highly recommended.

Glove is safe for all audiences.",1370908800,2,1302,4.829596412556054
