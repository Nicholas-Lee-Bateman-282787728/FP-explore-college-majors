8368703,1,B002F190D0,"I am not rating this DVD on the content but my understanding the content is excellent. I first learned of this DVD several years ago and have been trying for some time to get this w English subtitles. But the DVD I received will not play on my (US) DVD player and it plays all DVDs that I am aware of. I have returned it to the seller for a refund. The seller's note back said something about regions that i do not understand. I am aware there are regions of the world for various DVDs but I received no disclosure when ordering that this would not play in the US.  I am not sure what region covers the US.  Bottom line, before ordering this BE SURE it will play on a US DVD player",1369699200,,681,4.037037037037037
