8303089,1,B001FY0KF0,"This is technically child pornography, I didn't buy this but I did see it online. At the beginning of the video it has a FBI warning so yeah this is child porn even if it is anime. I don't think this should be a thing. Its gross and very illegal. But in Japan child porn is okay I guess. I would give no stars!",1474934400,5,310,3.859375

8303092,3,B001FY0KF0,"Those of you who know about this series primarily from the many hilarious ""reaction"" videos on Youtube already no what this movie is about so I don't feel any need for flowery phrasing or elaborate justifications as to why one would want to watch this movie.  Obviously you want to watch this movie in some way shape or form to determine if what you have heard about it is accurate because the other explanations of why you could be watching it are to horrifying to contemplate.  Trust me all you have heard about it is correct this episode and the two episodes of equal length that follow it are in fact examples of Shotacon and given current tends Boku No Pico is probably the only example we are ever going to see in an Anime/OVA form at least in the United States.

If the concept wasn't so horrifying the overwhelming majority of the plot points would actually be quite humorous

1.  Laughingly underpopulated anime universe apart from Peko's Grandfather the man and Peko himself no one else is ever seen in apparently deserted city
2.  The entire 7.5 minutes it took Peko to eat that Ice Cream Cone
3.  In the universe in which the anime takes place occasional rape of preadolescent males is OK but cross dressing is something to really freak about.

Compare this anime to Loveless or Gigantor that deal with the same basic trends but at least have some degree of plot to go with it.",1369267200,14,1389,4.528
8303093,1,B001FY0KF0,"Words cannot describe this story, which is about 8 year-old boys finding themselves in a homosexual relationship.
Now, I'm all for yaoi, but I think this goes too far. These characters are young boys performing sexual acts - not adults. Based on my view of morality (or lack there of), this is the last thing that anyone who considers themselves to be ""normal"" should be investigating. It oozes pedophelia from every line. What could be an innocent storyline about young children has been turned into an erotic story of young children devoloping sex lives. I would not recommend this to anybody, and if this is the kind of story you go after, I suggest you seek mental help for your strange fascination with young boys having sex.",1255478400,18,730,4.755905511811024
