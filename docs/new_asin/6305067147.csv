Loved the actors, Frances Farmer, Victor MacLaglen, Jon Hall & the depiction of the ruthlessness of white traders disregarding the safety of innocent island peoples. And the sad love story then redemption. Great movie. Wanted to see it again & have it in my collection & share with family & friends. Arrived very quickly & in great shape.

Bucko finds that the islands chief Kehane(Jon Hall)is in love with island girl Malia(Olympe Bradna)The pirate had brought along trashy bar tart Ruby Taylor(Francis Farmer)and much to Buckos delight she and kehane are attracted to each other,making it easier for the divers to do the pirates dirty work by going on dangerous missions.
The village doctor(Gene Lockhart)has suspicions about Bucko. Soon,Ruby is tired of Buckos cruel,evil,selfish,ways.
As the loot pours in profiting Bucko and his gang,kehane and the others find Bucko is only looking out for himself and has little regard about the island people and the missions they go on getting the pearls.

7881782,4,6305067147,"A better-than-average action film which co-stars two attractive actors in the leads: the ultimately tragic Frances Farmer and the adonis-like Jon Hall. Victor McLaglen plays the above character, who leads an expedition to the South Seas in search of pearls, but meets with resistance from a tribal chief who is protecting his people's wealth from the fortune hunters. McLaglen uses Farmer as a ploy to attract their chief, Hall & the pair marry.  But the pearl hunt is thwarted...A hard-hitting action film with first-rate photography (colour would have elevated this to five stars).  Frances Farmer was beautiful and talented but self-destructive: her alcoholism would impede her career and force her early retirement in 1942 at the age of 28. Farmer was eventually committed to mental institutions - with her mother's approval.  Eventually, after many hellish experiences, she made a comeback in an inept 1958 film entitled THE PARTY CRASHERS, co-starring with the equally tragic former child star Bobby Driscoll.  Farmer hosted a television movie matinee in Indianapolis entitled FRANCES FARMER PRESENTS. When she slurred her words thusly: FRANCES FARMER PREVENTS on the air, she was quickly dismissed into total obscurity from the public: she died in 1970 aged 56.  Jessica Lange played her life story excellently in the biographical film from 1982 entitled FRANCES.",1032912000,12,1370,5.383177570093458
