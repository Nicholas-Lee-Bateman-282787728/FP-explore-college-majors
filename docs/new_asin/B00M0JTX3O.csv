8669413,3,B00M0JTX3O,"Very 90's style animation, it is technically three dimensional but is nothing like Toy Story or Shrek or anything back then achieved.  It is very basic, almost stop go animation style.  The whole film barely goes for longer than 40 minutes so you need a really good story when you're less than half the length of a standard DVD feature film to justify the price.  Unfortunately this seemed like it was going to be better than it was. On Christmas Eve, a couple of kids smuggle their dog into their car after they are told to leave it at home, this causes their parents to crash the car and they later break their eccentric grandfather's clock at his house after they are told to stay out of that part of his house.  The next day they wake up back at home and are relieved it was all a bad dream, only it wasn't.

This is definitely no Groundhog Day, the story is watchable but it's not great.  If you can get this for a couple of dollars maybe give it a go otherwise spend the money on a better Christmas movie.",1450742400,,1011,4.267015706806283

8669416,5,B00M0JTX3O,"This is a fun, family animation about two incorrigible young kids who reign havoc upon their parents at Christmas Time. It's sort of a kids version of ""Groundhog Day"" with Bill Murray, where Christmas Eve repeats itself over and over. We watched it over the holidays with our whole family and everyone enjoyed it. Would recommend.",1420934400,2,330,4.910714285714286
8669417,5,B00M0JTX3O,If you like Bill Murry in Groundhog Day you will like this movie about two selfess spoiled brats who breaks the clock Santa Claus uses to make his delivery in one night and causes the day to repeat itself  over and over again so it always Christmas Eve and never Christmas Day.  At first the kids like getting away with doing what they want without worry about future punishment but quickly tire of it and have to figure out a way to move time forward once again.,1420502400,3,463,4.310344827586207
8669418,5,B00M0JTX3O,"This is a super fun and cute Christmas special that's great for kids and the whole family. Frozen in Time tells the story of a mischievous brother and sister duo, Eric and Patty, who become stuck in a never ending loop of Christmas Eve! The film has a great lesson of learning the value of family and to be helpful while still keeping things light, funny and pretty action-packed. Our girls loved the character of the quirky Grandpa and the little dog Arnie. The film runs a little less than an hour. Lots of fun!",1418774400,2,513,4.410526315789474
