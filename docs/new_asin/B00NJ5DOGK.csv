8678632,4,B00NJ5DOGK,"Nudes. Yep, they are definitely in this film. Quirky stuff from a young bunch of Brit actors. Oddball to say the least, the film does not take itself seriously. It's one of those English comedies that you should laugh at but you don't want to. There are no gags as such, it's situation comedy around the every day struggle to survive in London. Twenty years ago it was Four Weddings and its middle-upper class yuppies - times have changed - in Nudes In Tartan the characters are concerned with paying the rent and having enough money to eat. A real slice of modern London life. Recommended.",1415750400,,590,4.5754716981132075
