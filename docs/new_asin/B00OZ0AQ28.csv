6777232,3,B00OZ0AQ28,"Sorry, the host/proctor just was not up to the quality of the usual Paley hosts.  Not sure who she is, but she seemed more like the president of the Castle fan club than someone there to interview the guests & to moderate discussion.  That being said, I love seeing the cast & creators in these settings!  Just need a host who has more insightful questions.",1422489600,2,357,4.461538461538462

6777234,5,B00OZ0AQ28,"I loved this.  I enjoyed getting a sense of who these people really are and how much they love the creative work they do, as well as how hard they work.  Their hours are unbelievable.  I think they all are appreciative of their success, and while they sometimes give glib answers to questions, they also voice a deep seriousness about their craft.  When you watch this video, you can understand why their fans love them so much!",1421366400,3,428,4.51948051948052
