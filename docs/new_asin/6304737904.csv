7876784,4,6304737904,"A bit dated and corny, but the movie has a good message about not living in the past, and about re-igniting love.  I happened to be an extra in it, and had a lot of fun being involved, or I probably would've never heard of it.  It was Michelle's first movie and she's more lovely in person than on screen. While others have criticized her acting in the film, in her defense, she was very young then and has paid her dues, being one of the best now.  The movie revolves around Elliott Gould's and Suzanna York's characters.  During a family vacation road trip, the husband reminisces about the days when he first fell in love with his wife. Michelle Pfeiffer has a tiny role in the beginning of the movie, and only in a few flashback scenes, her playing the role of the wife when she was young.  Some don't understand why Michelle has a British accent in the film, but that's because she's supposed to be Suzanna York's character when she was young.  If you're planning to buy the movie, know that Elliott Gould is the star and not Michelle Pfeiffer was the cover implies.",1462838400,,1071,4.411167512690355

7876786,1,6304737904,"Like Power Passion and Murder, this movie was not her best, I would like to know where they found the pig for the hams in this movie.  This was really a sleeper, bad acting, bad plot, somewhat confusing and a bit hard to follow, I rate this one about a quarter of a star.",1262995200,,271,4.018518518518518

7876788,1,6304737904,"I got this DVD for $1.99 and I still feel ripped off.  The quality of the movie was terrible, the story line was stupid, and the acting was just fair.  Do not waste your time on this poor movie.  Even though there are some stars in it in their younger days (Eloitt Gould, Michelle Piefer, David Caruso), it does not make up for the poor content of the movie.  Cheaply made---DON'T BOTHER!!!",1173139200,,390,4.375
7876789,1,6304737904,"this is one of the 3 worst movies I have ever seen.
Bad storry, bad quality of the DVD,
Just don't get it. Beleve me. Thats why it is under 10 bucks but under 2 bucks would still be a wast of money and time.",1018483200,4,207,3.6222222222222222
