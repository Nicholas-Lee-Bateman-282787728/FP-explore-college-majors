3936666,5,B002IMLSZY,My grandson was very attentive first time he watched. Now we'd have to duct tape him to a chair to get him to watch it. Still it is a nice little video that has some good lessons. Never mind he thinks it's funny to burp loudly in a restaraunt (thanks Shrek) but he is 5 and we are hoping he will grow up by the time he is 30 or so.,1283385600,9,331,3.676056338028169

8371024,5,B002IMLSZY,"My daughter who is 6 was watching it with delight and she could not stop watching episode after episode.
There are the following: Phone Etiquette, Table Manners, And Social skills.

We have watched with her and it is really nicely made. First impression is that it is about 10 or 15 years old so it seem bit older but it is so fast paced and so wonderfuly produced that the kid got full attention and no problem with style. The girls are dressed like from eighties or something but they are so well spoken, boys are so well spoken, the montague is great as there is no long scenes or boring things, it is really great. Short to the point scene after scene after scene, with songs and pictures and special effects.

Just as I would not mind to watch Barney or Elmo that is ten years old I do not mind to watch this as this ist he same quality of production that went into this thing. It is super super professional and just  smooth to watch.

It was attention grabber. The lines are written with fun, they are smart and they are cute.
My daughter is watching it daily now and tries to apply the learned things everyday. I think it is great buy.
I need to buy more things on manners as I don't think this explores in depth all topics but gives you great great great overview and intro to all of them.

I wonder if they made more movies of this sort, the same people.

I agree that this material is great for older kids because I don't think that two years old woudl get much of the action but would not be bored either and there is nothing improper for little one.

What I love the best about this dvd is that it does not show the BAD attitudes, THE bad manners to teach kids them,
it shows some flops and fopas in a fun and non offensive manner just to show the prper way or it quizes kids on the right or wrong way to put butter use fork or knife but it makes a fun of the wrong ones in such a cute way and does not overemphasize bad things to teach or made impression in a child to learn bad habbits just as once
I got a dvd for behavioral issues that showed bad behaviour and my kid picked up all ofthem so the damage was permanent. I am very sensitive now as to how mcuh and how bad things are shown so this dvd has my totall
thumbs up as it is very gentle and focuses on good and does not show anythign bad and nasty or naughty.

Very positive, very up beat, very cheerful and very funny, songs are so catchy you want to sing them with the kids.
they even show songs lyrycs on the screen.

I love it, great for homeschoolers as well as we have friends who homeschool and they are super sensitive to violence and bad stuff so watched it with delight and wanted to borrow the dvd to show to kids.

Thanks for the great production! Finally kid friendly thing without bad stuff.",1340409600,8,2778,4.137291280148423
8371025,5,B002IMLSZY,"Got this got my children, and they really enjoyed it. Best of all, they use what they saw. I can repeat and repeat all day long, but when it's a DVD, they have recall beyond belief, because it is fun. Glad I got it!",1335571200,2,215,3.909090909090909
8371026,3,B002IMLSZY,"The dvd is ok for kids, it is on table manners and formal etiquette and suitable for older kids. The production quality is ok, but it is a bit older video quality. I would recommend if you need your kids to dine in a formal setting. I had hoped it would have been more about social interaction with younger kids.",1323043200,3,312,4.216666666666667
8371027,5,B002IMLSZY,"This summer my children went on an adventure of the road to Manners.  This was one of two videos we purchased from Amazon.com.  Both were great!

It had humor in it, with children dressing up like adults to make an example of what to do or not do.

It was worth buying, and spending time with the kids to explain manners.
