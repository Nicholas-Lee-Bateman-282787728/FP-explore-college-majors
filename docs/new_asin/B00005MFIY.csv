1625563,4,B00005MFIY,"All but 3 of the other Brass I have seen were completely ruined, as films usually are, by the clumsy dubbing from the same old dubbing studio and the same old bunch of actors. They have also ruined hundreds of other films and TV series and should have been put out of business decades

But here the well known English actor Frank Finlay in the main male part appears with his own voice in the English version, and the dubbing of the rest of the voices is not so ruinous.

Although there is, strictly speaking, really no single 'great erotic scene' in the film, there are a great many very well handled 'candid' erotic scenes generously distributed throughout the entire film and the cumulative effect is truly joyous especially if seen on a projection screen from which it gains a great deal, as of course do many arthaus films despite the intimate small scale subject matter. This film shares the same life-affirming, earthy life-force that is found in some other Italian films such as those of Fellini.

What do I mean by 'candid': I mean 'real' and honest, not idealised as in Hollywood love scenes; I mean an almost detatched documentary style not avoiding the clumsyness and awkwardness found in real life; I mean distanced and yet intimate at the same time; I mean that such scenes can be occasionally a little sordid or sometimes a little absurd. That's the sort of thing I mean - and it's all too rare while still retaining an erotic quality and not alienating the viewer (in the sense of vitiating any sexual response).
A very fine example of this which is fully satisfying as an erotic poem is the scene on the plane early in the first 'Emmanuelle' film. I have reviewed this on Amazon too.
Another example is the kitchen scene in 'The Postman Always Rings Twice', which I have also reviewed.
Any more examples please?",1351036800,2,1828,4.635802469135802
1625564,1,B00005MFIY,I bought the triple box set of three english version tinto brass movies & none of them are worth watching including this one. If you are buying tinto movies stick to the italian versions.,1285027200,9,187,4.529411764705882
1625565,5,B00005MFIY,"If you watch mainstreem Hollywood  you should stay where you are.
Tinto Brass is for people who actually have brains and use it.
The Key is one of his best and is, basically, cult classic. Tinto Brass understand  how to show woman, how to understand woman and how to enjoi woman. His other rare talant is to show landscape and air in it.

Stephania Sandrelli is fantastic!

Highly recommend.

1625567,2,B00005MFIY,"I have full respect for Tinto Brass: he managed to find relatively attractive women, hire them, then shoot nude pictures of them. Unfortunately that was pretty much the plot of this movie.

The plot is thin at best. As far as I could figure, it was about a group of four people: two men and two women, and one of the men took pictures of one of the women. Love triangles and so on...

However the plot was almost indiscernable because I was not even able ot understand most of what was happening in the movie. One half of the movie, the English version, was not in English. It was in German, French, and Italian. And guess what! There was not a single subtitle in the entire film! The English was just as incomprehensible. It was spoken with such a heavy accent and in often mumbled tones that they may as well have been speaking another language.

So, ultimately, this movie is not worth picking up in its current form. Unless Tinto Brass is your favorite person ever, The Key is just plain mediocre and lacking plot and clarity.",1106611200,51,1030,4.439153439153439

7945496,3,B00005MFIY,"Good movie but the strangest choice dub / subtitles I've ever seen. I prefer dubbed but a lot of tinto brass movies are subtitled. But this dubbing I wish they just didn't both and do just subtitles if there going to do it so poorly. It's dubbed only in the way as if any of the four main characters are talking to eat other. Otherwise they didn't bother. And there are NO SUBTITLES. so a huge part of the movie you can't understand what anyone says. I can't remember when i bought a movie without the option of subtitles. They're available for the tinto brass interview in the extras but not available for the movie. It's just something else you have to consider which version of older foreign movies. You can try and find out but you never know what version you will be getting for sure. Tinto  movies have so many different cuts of the movie out there. For different country's it seemed they would cut the movie different ways. Dubbed or subtitled. What language subtitled. So it really is which version did they use as a master to make the dvd or blu-ray. I really liked the movie but it's totally insane not to have subtitles if your not going to dub everything. I could follow most things on a basic level . But I can't say that I actually saw the movie as it was intended , then no . So how am I supposed to rate this movie. Yes the movie was great but the audio / subtitles are the stupidest thing you will ever come across watching a foreign movie.",1465171200,2,1457,4.298181818181818

7945498,3,B00005MFIY,"Concur with the other review as far as erotic content - it's not at all hardcore and even the softcore is pretty tame.  Contextually it's not even all that erotic really, there's some strange fetish stuff involved with most of it and the lady does most scenes with less than full consent (or consciousness, for that matter), and the explicit nudity is fairly brief.  I got this via the UK Amazon site for about half the cost of this, too....

The story is a bit sad, as is the period.  However the cinematography is absolutely stunning and so are the locations, the costumes, the beautiful ladies.... the usual high standard from Tinto Brass, basically.",1445472000,2,653,4.701754385964913
7945499,5,B00005MFIY,"This is the only way to get a proper HD version of Tinto Brass's  the Key
The only deal breaker for some movie fans is
It's region (B)
In 2015 it's easy to get a region free player for less then $150.00
There are so many great special editions all over the place
In the US we get maybe 70% of the good stuff
Also buy it direct from Arrow Video (They run sales at least 4-6x's a year
you can pick this up including S&h to the states around $15.00us
you can also try amazon.uk

The Key is Tinto Brass first major film since Caligula
It's nowhere near the ""hardcore""  and over the top Caligula!
 It's based off Jun'ichiro Tanizaki famous novel It's a ambitious adaption for the time

It's set in 1940's and it's a strong period piece
in terms of a story it was ahead of the times
it deal with all types of strange vices (dealing with a odd-swinging lifestyle,  trying to except one another's sexual fetishes)
The husband wants he wife to have affair and reads about it in her diary! then she reads he's diary and it gets her off
There's a lot going on in this film
I'm a little shocked with a massive gamble 50 Shades of Grey at the time nobody bought the licensing rights to put this out on BR here in the states around the release of 50 Shades of Grey while there was so much media attention on this type of genre
I understand 50 Shades really wasn't made for my demo but, I can bet this film runs circles around it
The film isn't sleazy it's true art
the score is amazing and fits the film
the locations are all real everything feels organic and real
This ain't to over budget Hollywood film only made to make a profit of a fan base
Tinto Brass is a real under rated Director this is his Citizen Kane
The two main actors are great

Frank Finlay  as Nino Rolfe
Stefania Sandrelli  as  Teresa Rolfe  (beautiful woman and gives a very real performances)
There chemistry onscreen is spot on at times you'd think they were really married

Special Features:
***High Definition Blu-Ray and Standard definition dvd (also region 2)
Presentation of the film in widescreen for the first time!
** Optional English and Italian audio,
**Newly translated English subtitles for the Italian audio
*Original trailer,
**Reversible sleeve featuring original and newly illustrated artwork by The Red Dress
**Collector's booklet featuring new writing on the film by Tinto Brass scholar Alaxander Tuschinski, Illustrated with rare production stills!

The biggest and only real negative about this BR is the lack of extras
Arrow video is usually amazing at throwing everything in even the kitchen sink

This is a must see for Indie/Art house fans
Over all for a film put out in 1983 it's a stunning achievement that hits all the right notes  8.5/10",1445385600,2,2724,4.508130081300813
