8164264,5,B000LV6ME6,"This documentary was brilliantly done in a loving way. Without prying we get a rare glimpse on how Ami lives with MS. It is inspirational to see that despite being 39 pounds Ami is a participant in life and not a spectator. He has fun with his friends. He falls in love. You soon forget his health status and join his enthusiasm as he takes a road trip across the US to visit a doctor.
