2658970,1,B000ILZ6F0,I did not realize they dropped Catherine Oxenberg and Brandon Kelly.  Many of the really good characters are gone.  I haven't even opened the package and plan to return the item.  What a disappointment.  Amazon should have noted that there was major charactor changes in the lineup for season 2.,1191715200,,295,4.84

2658972,4,B000ILZ6F0,"It's been awhile that this show had been on the air back in 1997 I believe and I still remember it still today. It Does not need great acting from it's cast. Just be fun action and adventure just the way I love these type of low budget show that air many years ago. Takes place inAcapulco,and what an great place for some ACTION,girl in bikinis evrywhere and low TEC special effect.

The second series is just as good as the first one back in 1994. All the ACTION in that show was also great and I do have the first season on DVD too. Any guy or gal who loves Action Adventure in the tropics this the show to get. So rush out and buy it;or get here on Amazom.com.",1179964800,6,663,4.061068702290076
2658973,4,B000ILZ6F0,"NOTE:  The pilot episode has a commentary by Michael Worth not noted on the box.  It is very funny and gives insight into the little known background on the show.

Here is the second and final season of Acapulco HEAT.  Unfortunately, it stopped production after only two years for some reason but has maintained a sort of cult status ever since.  Now we get a nice DVD release of probably the better half of the series.  Now more honed in on the reduced team of four, these three hot looking babes and their lethal weapon male counter part (Alison Armitage, Michael Worth, Christa Sauls and Lydie Denier) get themselves into some beach battling tropical trouble like no other!  We are able to follow the characters a little more closely this time around.  Gone are Oxenberg and Fabio, but Worth and Armitage are worthy succesors to the throne.  Mindless entertainment?  Yes.  But for the price, you can't beat the heat!  Even David Carradine makes an appearance in one of the final episodes.

This set appears to have at least a couple extras as the first one was pretty bare bones.  Would have been nice to have a cast commentary at least, but we'll have to see.  So, get some skin, bullets and beautiful waves for one low price.  Episodes of note are The Raven, Dream Girl, Sister Soothsayer, Flight 401 and Juice.",1161561600,16,1316,4.632034632034632

2658995,5,B000ILZ6F0,"This is a TV series movie, rated PG.  It runs as a comedy, detective way.  No bloody fighting.  Rather, 30-something in shorts or bikini.
beach is the background.  As such, this movie is fit for a whole family watching.

Story falls on a team of 4 detectives finding justice against those smuggling jewelry and drug.  Of the 3 females, one is a computer whiz and the other 2 often post as fashion models.  The remaining guy does, here and there, Kung-Fu kicks.  Their acting skill as to facial expression and running posture is average.  Fire and bombs are from special effect, acceptably believed but not frightened.

Yes, the computer tells everyone this is a dated movie.  This movie comes with 6 disc and can be seen in irregular order.",1409702400,,740,4.658914728682171

For the Fake DHL Team Members from Nigeria and in Tampa, Florida, I say Shame, Shame, Everyone will now know your names! Acapulco H.E.A.T - The Complete Second Season is what I wanted to buy for my 53rd Birthday and I did with a smile! I'll treasure it forever until the final day I am on this earth! The Seller sent this to me in the best Possible way and it's quick and fast will be delivered sooner than I thought. I thank the Seller of this DVD Set and hope I'll see something else that I want to buy from him in the near future. As for Dr. Wombey who Stole all of my Money and never bothered to say sorry? I feel not one bit of Petty for you as you considered me your Brother? Well you are a Spammer Dr. Wombey!

2659000,5,B000ILZ6F0,Less is more and the second season proved it. Less Actors with 2 from the first season and 2 new ones and it was just as good as season one. I just wish they did more with the series!,1342915200,,183,3.717948717948718
2659001,5,B000ILZ6F0,"This is an amazing DVD collection. Like the first season, the second one is also very appealing and it's a ""must have"" for a true fan of ""Acapulco H.E.A.T."" or a simple curious viewer. The quality of image and sound is far better than the first season, but it's only because the material the producers had was far better than the one's that where used in the first season. On a special note, it's not listed on the box, but when the first and second episodes are selected, there's a screen that announces that there's an audio commentary by actor Michael Worth (who portrayed ""Tommy Chase""). We can then choose if we would like to hear it or not. It's a very interesting commentary, because the actor speaks about the first season and the second one. Also, the extras of the DVD are average, like the first season. It's a completely different kind of Extras, but still very good.",1304467200,5,879,4.534591194968553

2659003,1,B000ILZ6F0,"I watched Acapulco Heat Season One when it was on TV and enjoyed watching it on Saturaday afternoons. I puchased the first season of Acapulco Heat and I enjoyed watching it very much.

I also purchased Season Two and noticed most of the actors were gone accept two from the original cast. That was a hint that something might be wrong.  The A team in seaason one became the C team in season 2.

I have never watched a DVD which bored me more. I should have returned it but I kept thinking I would grow to like it but my dislike of season 2 has only grown. This DVD was a waste of my time and money.

They should not have made season 2.  Now I know why Season 2 was never shown on the TV network in my city. The network had it right - It was not worth showing.

This DVD is absolutely awful and extremely predictable. I will sum of my viewing experience in one word BORING!",1198800000,2,872,4.0701754385964914

8146183,5,B000ILZ6F0,"I just love ACAPULCO H.E.A.T....
Action,great script,great looking cast....
Very underrated 90's TV Series!! Was so glad that the series was renewed for a 2nd season back to 1996!!
I know most people will disagree with me but in my opinion:the 2nd season is much better than the 1st series!!: reason 1:better acting:Fabio and the computer geek at the 1st season couldn't act at all!! reason 2:having  a smaller cast gives the 4 actors more screen time and the director gave us the opportunity to see any of the 4 actors more developed in their character and life..
I was so happy that ALISON ARMITAGE and Michael Worth were the only 2 cast members to be back as they were definitely the best of the bunch!!
If you listen and watch closely the extra footage on disc 6, Michael Worth mentioned back to 2006 that a movie might come up...a 3rd series was meant to be filmed but the whole project was just canceled according to him...A pity really...
Now in 2015, only 2 of the 4 actors are still acting: MICHAEL WORTH as an actor and director and the great French lady:LYDIE DENIER...unfortunately Christa Sauls gave up acting a decade ago and Alison ARMITAGE is living in USA and cut ties with all members from ACAPULCO HEAT...Shame really!!
A must see to any fan of the 90's tv series!!",1421798400,2,1284,4.582608695652174
