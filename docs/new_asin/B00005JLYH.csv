1503935,2,B00005JLYH,I like John L and think he's a great actor but this movie wasn't up to his level. It started out real good almost like a documentary where he's talkng about life on the streets and what its all about. MONEY! The end was stupid...The trailer fooled me into believing it ws a bigger story than it was. Dry and weak.,1048032000,,313,4.147540983606557
1503936,1,B00005JLYH,"You judge a man by what he respects or disrespects. John Leguizamo, who would be otherwise marked as a brilliant talent has chosen to denigrate the best and brightest.",1047945600,,167,4.793103448275862
1503937,3,B00005JLYH,"Empire was a great movie. I really enjoyed it. John Leguizamo is unbelievably talented and he can pull off any roll. Hey, if he can do a convincing job as Luigi from the Mario Brothers, then he can do this, right? The only problem with this movie was the ending. Watching previews and promos and commercials from this movie, one is lead to believe that the ending sequence, the most CRUCIAL point in the movie, the point when Leguizamo confronts the shady banker about stealing his money, will be this long, amazing display. But I was very disappointed to see that it only lasts, like 30 seconds. It's like you're sitting there waiting for this great thing to happen, but you're disappointed when it doesn't deliver. And then John's fate in the end.. to say the least, it was disappointing. Overall, the movie was very good but the ending could use some work. It kind of ruined the whole movie. But either way, if you're a Leguizamo fan then you're in for a treat. Just cover your eyes in the end.",1047945600,,997,4.513812154696133
1503938,1,B00005JLYH,"This movie is so bad that I'm not even goign to say HOW bad it is.  Suffice to say, John Leiguzamo is rapidly goign the way of Cuba Gooding Jr., making really, really, really bad movies for cash.  Talented people in movies so bad, Sharon Stone passed.  The plot has such a simplistic point that it's a wonder it go made.  Is the dumbing down of movies going dumber and dumber to now capture the young rap lovers?  Yes, yes it is.  This movie is so bad that I was surprised someone didn't say Leiguzamop's name aloud to pander further to the audience as if we couldn't read.  Oh and he dies in the end on the run in such an obvious place---he runs from the Latin mob to Puerto Rico--------that I was upset at first when I saw he was still alive.  And when you're gratified that the lead character dies, you're in a REALLY bad movie.",1047600000,2,831,4.215189873417722
1503939,5,B00005JLYH,"First time director Franc Reyes, simply did a masterful job in writing and directing this film. Growing up in the South Bronx himself, what he saw and been through in his life was the basis for this movie, thats what made it so real and good. John Leguizamo as Victor Rosa was the perfect choice, and the all around acting in this film was one of the best I've seen. Treach as ""Chedda"" and Fat Joe as rival drug lord ""Tito"" gave great perfomances, who better to play the roles of someone tying to survive in the streets than these two. Beautiful Delilah Cotto as Carmen was a breath of fresh air and played well as Victor's girlfriend, Vincent Larresca as ""Jimmy"" gave a riveting performance as Victor's best friend and the always eye catching Denise Richards playes a good part as well.  The pacing of the movie was on point with great sequences and music, Franc Reyes heavily releyed on latin style music thorougout this movie. This film has it all, love, friendship, betrayal and the consequences of it all, this movie places in my top 5 all time. Just as a little triva.. The guy who plays ""Hector"" (Carlos Leon) who Jimmy has war with, is none other than the father of Madonna's daughter, thought that was kind of interesting. Get this movie, watch it and feel how compelling it is.",1047513600,3,1287,4.523605150214593
1503940,5,B00005JLYH,"I have been a long time fan of John Leguizamo for years thanks to his awsome comedies (specifically The Pest), but I have to say this movie canged my view of his serious acting.  The movie was wonderful!  As a small town girl, the drug deal subject enthraled me because things like that are so foreign to us in the small towns.  It was awsome!

1503941,1,B00005JLYH,"This film was terrible. Leguizamo as a South Bronx drug dealer. I was kinda shocked that as a member of the audience I was expected to take this movie seriously.  how  can a drug dealer get bamboozled out of nearly million dollars by some preppy, wetnosed, somewhat inexperienced wallstreet broker and his girlfriend? And the ending? Oh that wasn't expected. I guess you shouldn't tick off the slightly overweight Columbiana by not payin' her. She's liable to send her psychotic brother after you.",1045267200,,497,4.975903614457831

1504655,3,B00005JLYH,"A poor ghetto Puerto Rican kid becomes a self-made millionaire by age thirty by working the drug trade. He commands an army of men (okay a small army, but one non-the-less) of men from the hood. When he tells them to go murder someone at the risk of getting murdered or imprisoned for life, they do it. He is intelligent enough to strategically plan a highly successful attack on other high-end drug dealers without being murdered or imprisoned. He is of the caliber that if he wants to meet tomorrow with the head drug lord (think Mexican drug lords), he just has to dial a number on his cell phone & wallah! He's there the next day, doing lunch with the top banana. He's a Puerto Rican who grew up in racist New York and probably his parents did to. So along comes a young white dude who appears to be from the upper class and claims to be a highly successful investment banker. Within a few weeks he has conned this Puerto Rican drug dealer out of millions of dollars which was given to him in cash. This drug dealer deals in a cash-only business because money orders and checks are not accepted, yet he accepts a $2 million check from this alleged investment banker which he has only known for a few weeks. His girlfriend has told him that this guy can't be trusted, but he trusts him anyway. He doesn't have any type of background check done on the guy. He doesn't even confirm the guys place of employment. Would someone of his caliber be so naive and make such choices especially in this short time period? The actor who played the alleged investment banker played it as a con artist which makes the entire situation much more unbelievable. He'd be figured out in like five minutes. Con artists don't act and talk like con artists. They act like your best friend. Otherwise the film is great and has a great message.",1371254400,3,1823,4.444776119402985

1504659,4,B00005JLYH,"I like to compare movies and characters from similar genres. Victor Rosa is a tough hood who in the end plays out a losing hand. While Rosa is less ruthless than Nino Brown (New Jack City) and smarter than Tony Montana (Scarface) in not using his own supply of drugs, he is still not as savvy as Carlito (Carlito's Way, Carlito: Rise To Power). Carlito would never have been taken the way Victor Rosa was, and would have had connections to deal with anyone foolish enough to have dared to screw him over--no matter where the hapless fool flew to.

I loved the setting of the movie. Indeed, when I viewed it and saw the Twin Towers from a Manhattan park I had to look at Leonard Maltin's Movie Review to see when the movie was made. It looks so contemorary that I was surprised to find t had been made 10 years ago. It still looks fresh and contemporary to me.

While Leonard Maltin gave this movie only Two Stars, it is at least a Three And A Half Star Movie and I rounded it up to Four Stars as there is no 3.5 Star Rating. I loved Reyes' take on South Bronx. He is a remarkable up and coming writer and director. The sky is the limit for him.

I won't go into all the details of the plot but I will laud the supporting cast. Peter Saarsgaard and Denise Richards and ohh my goodness--Cotto! Wow! They are great in this movie and that does not mention Sonia Braga and Treach and Fat Joe. If you are a fan of gangster movies I suggest you see this movie at all costs.

1504661,3,B00005JLYH,"I had high expectation for `Empire'.  That is probably where I went wrong.  As far as a drug fueled gangster story, this does have its high points, but overall it misses a lot of marks and comes up short too many times for me.  It wants to be something more than it is capable of becoming.  I take that back.  It wants to be something more than it actually is, which is sad because it was capable of becoming all that it wanted to be.

Make sense?

The film tells the story of hustler Victor Rosa who makes a decent living being fairly indecent.  In an attempt to solidify his safety (and procure a nice future), Victor tries his hand at more complex games only to eventually be taken for everything.

Not good.

With a cast that includes some pretty heavy hitters (Sarsgaard, Rossellini), some beautiful faces (Braga, Richards) and some charismatic talent (Leguizamo), this really should have been a slam dunk.  Sadly, it fails on two opposite ends of the spectrum.  As far as becoming an intelligent drama, the script lacks any real depth or polish.  It feels rushed and unfocused.  As far as being truly engaging and exciting, it suffers again from lack of real focus.  The film doesn't really have any true intensity, and thus it loses its bite and in the end loses the audience.

The actors (outside of Leguizamo) aren't given much to build off of, which is a shame considering the talent involved.  Rossellini's role is rather thankless (UGH, she is so amazing, why couldn't they have really USED her?!?!?!) and Richards and Braga are given barely anything to do other than look pretty.  Richards nails her seductive nature, but she fades into shallow forgetfulness as the script disregards her.  Sarsgaard actually handles his character impeccably (he is good at the shady guy) but I would have loved to know more about his character.

Yes, Leguizamo carries this movie, and actually does a stand-up job with what he is given.  I just wish that he had been given a better movie to work within.

In the end, there are some themes that resonate well, they just aren't fleshed out enough.  I actually found the ending effectively chilling, I just wish that it also didn't come as such a relief for me (as in, thank god this is finally over).  I'm giving this a C.  It has something going for it, it just doesn't understand fully how to make that something WORK for it.

I hate that this should have been so much better.",1273190400,,2423,4.589743589743589

1504782,4,B00005JLYH,Watching the movie Empire again for the first time in say five years  I don't think it was half bad. John Leguamizo carries his first big dramatic starring role. The movie's director Franc Reyes does well with his first from the scenery to the Bronx locales. My only compliant about the film was the cliched ending. Other than that if you like gangsta hood movies then check this out.,1207094400,,384,4.565217391304348
1504783,2,B00005JLYH,"John Leguizamo (George A. Romero's Land Of The Dead, The Honeymooners) plays a hotshot street thug from the South of Bronx who winds up making a business deal with wallstreet hotshot, played by Peter Sarsgaard (the upcoming The Skeleton Key, Shattered Glass). Soon, Leguizamo's life turns upside down as he finds out that his business partner is trying to scam him. This is a very intriguing story but it leaves nothing to fill in the gaps except for a good performance by John Leguizamo which keeps this from going down in the dumps. Also starring Denise Richards (The World Is Not Enought, Valentine) as another ditzy woman with sexual ways, Rappers Fat Joe and Treach (Jason's Lyric), Nestor Serrano (The Negotiator) and a weird role for Isabella Rosselini (Death Becomes Her, Immortal Beloved) as a druglord...very weird and the hair.",1120176000,2,838,4.992857142857143
1504784,5,B00005JLYH,"Wow, Delilah Cotto sure can act. Her character Carmen is the best character in this movie. She's the reason we root for the main character Victor, who is played perfectly by John Leguizamo. Leguizamo and Cotto had great on scene chemistry and that was a key element to the movie. Jack, who is played by Peter Saarsgard, pitches an investment opportunity to Victor and he goes with it. But Victor's life comes crashing down as his crew turns on him and his relationship with Carmen is skating on thin ice. Carmen's friend and Jack's girlfriend Trish, who is played by Denise Richards, turns out to not be such a good friend. You'll see how evil those two are as the movie goes on. The two characters that did great in supporting roles were Jimmy (Vincent Laresca) and Chedda (Treach). They're very under-rated as actors and this movie should have gotten Academy Award Consideration. Punk ass Oscars! Movies like The Hours and Chicago are stupid boring movies that are a reflection of people with bad taste in movies and further validates the point that the haters are jealous of Empire, the greatest movie of all-time. You ain't a real movie watcher if you don't see Empire. It's the greatest ever. No questions asked!",1101859200,3,1217,4.745283018867925
1504785,5,B00005JLYH,"John Leguizamo is hot in this movie.  This movie struck me as a little of ""Menace II Society"" and a little of ""New Jack City.""  Fat Joe had a cool cameo.  Don't sleep on this movie and don't let the haters persuade you to pass this one by.",1073952000,,239,3.9375
1504786,3,B00005JLYH,"South Bronx has been divided up by four prominent drug dealers who respect each others' borders.  However, every now and then it happens that they cross each others borders, which always leads to brutal violence.  Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo) is one of these four drug dealers, and he ends up getting shot due to one of these disputes.  Victor survives, but realizes that he must quit before he ends up like his older brother who was killed over the drug business.  Therefore, he begins to do business with a Wall Street investment banker who he gets to know through his girlfriend's friend.  This leads to Victor beginning to lose sight of where he is going and before he knows it he is lost in a heap of trouble.  Empire begins with an interesting premise, which is delicately crafted.  However, the overuse of voiceover causes the intellectual angle to loose its power, and as the story develops it becomes more predictable and entangled in itself.  This then produces an over ambitious film that lacks a set path and results in an average cinematic experience.",1073001600,2,1064,4.775956284153006
1504787,4,B00005JLYH,"I'm a little biased towards this movie, because I'm a HUGE John Leguizamo fan. I'm obsessed with Freak, Super Mario Brothers, Ice Age, and just about everything else he's done. So when I saw the previews for ""Empire"", you better believe I was the first one standing in line at the movie theater on opening night.
Leguizamo plays Victor Rosa, a South Bronx Drug Dealer. The product he sells is called Empire (hence the movie title) and he's very successful in his business. Through his girlfriend, he meets a guy named Jack, an investment banker in Manhattan. Jack and Vic become chummy, and Vic decides to leave the street life behind and move into a swanky loft in Soho with his girlfriend and their unborn child.
Life with Jack is just peachy - Vic is making more money than ever before, he's happy as ever in his new environment, and things are going well with his girlfriend and the pregnancy. Then one day, Jack says he just came across a new investment opportunity, and if Vic wants to be a part of it, he needs to put in a minimum of $1.5 million dollars. Vic puts it in without hesitation, and this is where the plot thickens.
For those who haven't seen it, I won't give away the ending. But let's just say Jack isn't as legit as he says he is.
My only complaint is that the plot ""twist"" was a little predictable, and the ending of the movie wasn't as spectacular as it was made out to be in all the publicity. But if you like gritty crime dramas chock full of suspense, revenge, and JOHN LEGUIZAMO, then this is definitely the movie for you.",1068076800,,1550,4.40418118466899
1504788,2,B00005JLYH,"**1/2 In ""The Godfather,"" Michael Corleone tries to convince his ex-fiance, Kay, that the Mafia does nothing that politicians, corporate businessmen and national leaders don't do - only the latter do it in secret and call their actions ""legitimate.""
This concept serves as the premise for ""Empire,"" a film that puts forth the Corleonian notion that the ethos that operates in corporate boardrooms is no different from the one that holds sway in big time drug empires like the one young Victor Rosa operates.  John Leguizamo gives a solid performance as Victor, a good looking, exceptionally powerful drug kingpin from the South Bronx who, after he meets a shrewd white Wall Street yuppie named Jack, tries to channel his moneymaking skills into a more ""legitimate"" direction.  But Victor soon discovers that not only is it difficult for a person to leave his past behind him, but that even he isn't prepared for the venality and corruption he finds in the high stakes world of corporate greed.
With Victor providing reflective voiceover narration to accompany the action, the film feels a bit like a mini-""Goodfellas"" in style and tone.  The story is not without interest, but, unfortunately, the farther it gets away from its South Bronx setting, the less believable and more melodramatic it becomes.  The early sections of the film, in which we see Victor operating his ""enterprise,"" are by far the best.  Writer/director Frank Reyes obviously knows whereof he films and he brings a chilling realism and sense of immediacy to this darkly lit world of drug deals, shootouts and senseless killings.  Particularly interesting is the way Reyes explains the geography of the drug-dealing world, with each section of the city apportioned off to the exact square inch among rival ""businesses."" But as the story spins off in another direction, it loses some of its credibility and begins to feel less and less authentic and more and more contrived.  The film is obviously intended as a cautionary tale, but we can't help but notice how much it has to sweat and strain to make its point.
In addition to Leguizamo, there are fine performances by Peter Sarsgaard, Denise Richards, Delilah Cotto and Isabella Rossellini.  It's a pity that the film itself, for all its undeniable virtues, doesn't make as much of an impact as a whole as these performers do in pieces.",1063497600,,2356,4.977099236641221
1504855,5,B00005JLYH,This movie shed a totally new light on what is sometimes a overdone storyline.  It follows John Leguizamo as a drug dealer who is trying to survive in a world full of influences that are trying to keep him down.  It shows the real and human side of the streets.  As was stated by other reviewers the entire cast gave very believable performances.  I would definitely chalk this movie up as one of the sleepers of the year.,1060041600,,422,4.371794871794871
1504856,5,B00005JLYH,"""Empire"" is a film that revolves around the drug world in the Bronx and how a dealer (John Leguizamo) tries to make a better life for himself, his girlfriend, and his unborn child by moving to the more legit business of investing.
Victor (Leguizamo) is a the leader of Empire, a powerful drug business in the Bronx. The area is split up into four sections with Victor's Empire being the largest. Victor has a great life -plenty of money and much respect from the people in his neighborhood. One day, through his girlfriend, he meets a rich business man, Jack, from downtown who convinces Victor to start investing with him. Soon more and more money starts rolling in and Victor starts the ""good life,"" which consists of living in huge apartment in SoHo, having ""better"" friends and contacts, and having even more money than he ever dreamed of back in the Bronx. Soon things start going wrong and it's up to Victor to fix everything.
John Leguizamo, Treach, Fat Joe, and Delilah Cotto give excellent performances in this film. This film is obviously like many of the other mobster/mafia films in which there is a gangster who's trying to go legit, but this one has a latin flavor to it that makes it interesting and different. Many have compared this film to ""Goodfellas,"" and the films are, indeed, very similar, but a good movie is a good movie.
I would highly suggest this film to people who love crime dramas and people are interested in a fast-paced intriguing film. You won't be disappointed!",1055721600,,1497,4.695817490494297
1504857,3,B00005JLYH,"I love John Leguizamo and was excited to see this movie when I saw the preview. Thankfully I didn't run to the theater to see it.
Anyone who has seen ""Carlito's Way"" will remember John for his great protrayal of ""Benny Blanco From The Bronx"". In many ways this movie parrallels Carlito's Way and tries to be a 2002 version of that now classic movie. It's been a while since a really good crime drama came out - one that could take a place with Goodfellas, Scarface, Carltio's Way or Casino. This movie falls very short of being anything close to a return to the 80's and early 90's and the great crime dramas and gangster flicks from that period.
The movie is about a latino man named Vic, who runs a drug cartel in south bronx. The product is called ""empire"", hence the name of the movie. The movie also has Leguizamo narrating, much in the way ""Carlito's Way"" did - only not very good. Where as 'Calito Brigante"" really did apear an intelligent, quick witted, and admirable character, ""Vic"" comes off much less apealing and the monologue isn't anything close. You won't hear any good lines in this one - nothing like ""the street is watching"".
It's not an entirely bad movie either though. Just seeing Leguizamo on screen is entertaining because of his personality but he cant carry the whole movie and no other characters in the movie where even a slight bit interesting nor were they developed well in the plot. The ""twist"" at the end was anything BUT original too and the plot itself offers little to ponder.
In the end this is a generic movie trying to be a new version of the great classic gangster flicks. It fails badly, but isn't a total snore either. The only good thing about the movie was Leguizamo.",1053734400,2,1711,4.504823151125402
1504858,3,B00005JLYH,"and then turn the dern thing off! there are the obvious paralells to carlito's way, but without the skill in the monologue. the dialogue in the movie is terrible. the characters are not even remotely interesting, and i think it was actually kind of funny that la columbiana's assassin/brother kept showing up to kill people. he just needed to start whistling of something and then the movie would have been worth a laugh at least. it seems like someone had a good idea for the beginning of a movie, then sold the script off to someone else to finish it.
i gave it three stars because the beginning of the movie was pretty good, everyone likes a coming of age story. the ending was alright, but the majority of the movie that it had to reflect back on was pretty horrible.",1052611200,,771,4.475177304964539

Too often we see these gangsta movies that are just caught in the glue of the drug world, rarely advancing out of it.  In EMPIRE John Leguizamo makes us believe in his character, in his striving to get out of the drug world to make a life for his girlfriend and incipient family.  There are clever twists and turns and it is great to see the 'bad guy' be the uptown Ivy League manipulator.  The cast is strong, the photography is good, the narration of the story by Leguizamo is enlightening, and the movie takes us where others are afraid to go.

1504863,4,B00005JLYH,"I really have to say that I have really enjoyed this film! It had a plot to it, which most ganster films fell to give. I thought the whole idea of colliding the two worlds together was brillant! We never really get to see how the clean Business man is envolved with the Ghetto Drug Business. Which is true and this is happening everyday but we don't know about it. I thought John L, really did his part in the film and was convincing! I loved Deniese Richards part in the film. By the way Deniese has lost a lot of weight, shes looking alittle stressed out and older! The first time I noticed was in ""2000's Valentine"" and she has been incredibly skinny every since. But anyway over all this is a very suspenseful thriller it keeps you on the edge. It is like the ""New Jack City"" of the New Millenium! It really goes deep into the drug world and lets you see the reality of it. All the way down to how it is cut and how the ""Spots and Turfs"" are divided. After watching this film if you are Naive on this subject this will definitely teach you a whole lot! I will say that the ending was a bit short. I felt the confrontation between the Banker and John should have been more serious! I mean you are waiting on him to get this man back and it is over so expeditiously! I like man, it could have been a bit more suspenseful. But anyway overall it is the closest to a satifying ganster film as you are going to get. Goodness know's it makes more sense and runs a ring around ""Belly"" & ""Exit wounds"". I was really beginning to loose faith in black cinema. Now I can truley say there are still some good directors out there!
