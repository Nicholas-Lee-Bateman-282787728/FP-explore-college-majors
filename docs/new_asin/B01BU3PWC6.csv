7669331,5,B01BU3PWC6,"I bought this series to watch in my golden years as I had already seen the whole series on TV. I thought I would forget it in my dotage and so I bought seasons 1--6  so that I can enjoy it all over again. I loved the series which starts with the sinking of the Titanic and ends between the two world wars. It is so interesting to see how people lived in days gone by and of course the stately home featured in the series is still standing, the DVDs arrived in excellent condition and I am so pleased that I was able to buy them.",1461456000,6,528,3.9345794392523366

7669333,4,B01BU3PWC6,"I love this series and wanted to have every season on DVD so I could watch again with my husband.  I finally got him interested toward the end of Season 6....better late than never.  He had teased me about becoming a Downton addict, but I didn't care.  The set of 6 seasons was bought through a third party.  I am not happy with the UK version.  The quality of the production is not as clear and sharp as what I watched on my local PBS station.  I supposed if I had bought the series through them I would have gotten the USA release.  If I ever the get the money, I will do that.

7669334,5,B01BU3PWC6,Who doesn't love the Downton Abbey shows. Had to have it to watch over again a few times. Each time you find more interesting things that you didn't see before.,1457913600,14,160,4.366666666666666
7669335,5,B01BU3PWC6,"There is SO much that is good in this series, that perhaps the miss-steps stand out somewhat more (especially contrasted with BBC productions of yore); but there are few film-makers better able to create a sense of time and place than Julian Fellowes. He excels at window dressing, the details, capturing a mood, the very zeitgeist of the moment. Combine that with charismatic, personable actors who could read the phonebook and make it seem momentous (with an exception or two), and I was hooked.

I've given much thought to what made Downton Abbey so irresistible despite its flaws. The series is strong on style, weaker on substance and narrative cohesion (i.e., predictable and unoriginal with relatively few surprises to be had, among other things). By contrast, have a look at stories that ARE strong, original. In the case of Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth, Andrew Davies lent his incredible eye for detail, for time and place, to one of the most memorable tales ever written, without unduly overshadowing or imposing his own views on it, and it was a winner. Ditto with Ang Lee's/Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility. But in Little Dorrit (another Davies treatment), details and direction of the actors marred/overshadowed the elements (the very nature) of the original story. Ditto with Mr. Selfridge, which bore almost no resemblance to the true story.

I first became aware of such issues when I saw the 2005 BBC production of North and South. I was completely enchanted. But then I read the book, after, AND saw the older 1975 production with Patrick Stewart. It became clear to me that the director of the 2005 version had woven a beautiful, atmospheric tapestry, but it bore little resemblance, and in some ways even detracted from the original, wonderful, unique book. The 1975 version captured, much more vitally, truly, the spirit of the book. After realizing this, I reappraised the mini-series, and though it reveals an eye for mood, time and place (like Fellowes') it omits some of the essential elements of the book (and the original issues/feelings of the time). It does this chiefly by drawing attention to the directors own vision. The 1975 North and South affords a more legitimate view, the heady sense of plunging into the Industrial Revolution. It captures the original book, the feelings THEN, without the adapter/director overlaying a post-industrial sensibility over the proceedings. Of course this is easier to see with works written at the time. In short, the 1975 version is long on substance and integrity but short on style (low-budget). I'll take substance over style any day, but the very best productions embody both, along with narrative skill.

With Downton Abbey, we have a series penned by Fellowes, steeped in POST-Edwardian sensibilities (the goldfish keenly aware of the water in which they swim, for one thing). It's melodrama (meaning characters subserve the plot, rather than the reverse) of the highest order, given the resplendent sets and costumes, the quality of the actors and dialogue. But besides the lack of narrative skill, the seesawing back and forth in a willy-nilly fashion that often hijacks suspense (though there wasn't much to begin with, since nearly every plot-point is telegraphed in advance and a given), what aggrieves me most is Fellowes violating the injunction to ""show not tell.""

Just LISTEN to the dialogue. People are omniscient; they say things that few at the time would say. They sum things so brilliantly that it ROBS the viewer of arriving at these conclusions themselves- profound ah-ha moments. The series could've been brilliant had Fellowes not done this. Let me give you one example of dozens that made me wince (***SPOILERS FOLLOW***): Edith's soliloquy to her sister on how they must forgive each other because in the final analysis only they will remember their youth, their dead sister, their parents, the era- shared and experienced together. PLEASE. There are COUNTLESS examples of people commenting on the changing times (especially, the loss of gentrification and the privileged status of the gentried), in ways that any philosopher or poet would envy, the kind of observations made by future generations, historians, or the aged after lifelong reflection AFTER the fact.

Yes, of course, people were derailed by changing times. But they wouldn't have had the wisdom of hindsight to see through the glass so clearly- too many pithy, brilliant summations (reminds me a bit of Nora Ephron's writing in that regard, but that's another story). Poor judgement, and for me it highjacked the sense of discovery, suspense in many a scene. Such notions are supposed to DAWN on the viewer, by the craftiest, most subtle of suggestive means. That's what brilliant film-making, storytelling is all about (what I most enjoy, anyway). Note that I'm not faulting the beautiful language/dialogue itself- what a pleasure to hear such lyrical prose- the problem was in the perspectives expressed. How many wise, brilliant people can there be in one place and time (down to the last servant)?

I have other gripes: inconsistent &/or ho-hum acting by Mary, Edith and Matthew, Tom's loss of his cajones, and Mary's mystifying, unrealistic character arc over the course of the series, culminating in the simplistic, trite notion that she's mean because she's hurting, AND, she can't stand the notion of her new love being hurt in a car wreck. Really?  Thats all there is to it?  Her character development just doesn't add up. I paid close attention, and never felt like I came to know Mary (part of the problem lay in Michelle Dockery's often wooden acting). And then, Fellowes completely tosses away the opportunity to surprise us with her change of heart about her new love- talk about an anticlimax! ""Yes, I love you. Let's get married. Tea?"" Why not have him sweep her off her feet (or vice-versa)? Both the fight between Mary and Edith and their later reconciliation were equally anti-climactic. There was also the telegraphing of so much throughout- for example, of Barrow's impending suicide.

I thought Maggie Smith was glorious. Cora was a bit too mealy-mouthed, one-note, for my liking (a waste, though Fellowes did try to remedy that in the final episode).  Then there was the fact that Fellowes ""humanized"" the gentry to a preposterous extent, showing them empathizing with the help in a way that was likely uncharacteristic of 99% of the upper class.

Finally let me say that it annoys me no end (part and parcel with this) that PBS feels obliged to tell me every two minutes that this is the most brilliant series every conceived- sorry, don't agree. And even if I did, what would they mean to accomplish by it? Those whom agree already do. Those who don't are just irritated. It insults my intelligence that PBS is telling ME what's good- I'll decide that for myself, thank-you. And must I be regaled with constant, continual COMMERCIALS, for anything on PBS, but in this case for Downton Abbey? How is that any different from oven cleaner commercials and why must I be subjected to them??

All that said, regardless, I SO looked forward to each episode.  I loved the costumes, scenery, sense of time and place, the history lesson and most of all the SPLENDID actors and acting- especially the servants- (Mrs. Patmore- yeah!)- all were addictive. There were gems- twinkling, memorable lines such as Lord Grantham's rueful ""Edith couldn't get her DOLLS to do what she wanted."" And finally, I must give BIG kudos to Fellowes for giving women such prominence in his tale (productions which do are rare- in movies it's typically six male characters to every female, or somesuch). Ditto with giving equal time to people of all ages, and depicting older folks as important, loving, feeling individuals, not caricatures.  Outstanding.

Though this is better than 95% of American TV, Masterpiece Theater set a VERY high bar indeed and I don't think this is the penultimate Masterpiece Theater. VERY good, definitely worth seeing and owning, but not the best ever. I did so worry that with the final episode Fellowes wouldnt follow true to form and might load up the surprises. Instead, every development followed from the previous years, demonstrating integrity and consistency as to what had gone before.  Only three miss-steps did I notice in the final episode- Coras line (I paraphrase): Well we finally got rid of the last one, a line that no parent of a child who had died would EVER say.  And in labor or not, Anna would have been shuttled carefully but hastily down to her own room rather than being  permitted to give birth in Marys room- nor would Lady Mary have mopped up her amniotic fluid (!), shed have rung for a servant.  And third, there was dramatic license taken in having Edith and her new brother-in-law travel alone together to London, even being alone in a hotel room- simply not done, decorum would not permit it- even today it would raise some eyebrows.  Brother, yes, brother-in-law, no.

Fellowes was true to form in terms of predictability in the finale, too, but curiously that tendency felt like an old friend (even Barrows inevitable butlership- yay).  To my great surprise, I found myself tearing up throughout, easily the best episode of the entire series.  The ending was fitting all round, splendid.  I was delighted with Isobel Crawleys reconciliation with her love, among many other things.  And Mary sparkled, wonderful, if only wed seen more of that side of her throughout the entire series- ditto with Edith, who was self-assured, radiant.  The ONLY thing I secretly wished was for Barrow to find love, but one cant have everything. All else was tied up perfectly. So, what was good about Downtown Abbey, particularly in the final episode, was SO good I can overlook its flaws- but you'll have to adjudge for yourself.  Highly recommended!!",1457308800,27,9867,4.9933008526187574

7669438,5,B01BU3PWC6,"I binge-watched all six seasons via Amazon Prime Video. It was the best! It's very much like a soap opera. However, it gave me a good feeling while watching almost every episode. It seldom had episodes that were depressing. When there were, it was done in the best way possible.

It was wonderful to see a part of history that was done in an entertaining manner. It produced much interest among non-historians while the series was on TV. I am so happy to have been able to watch it for free on Prime Video.

I am 57 years old. The DVD set would make the perfect gift for someone my age. It covers WWI, The Roaring Twenties, The Great Depression, and so much more. The storyline covers the servants as well as the aristocrats. I absolutely loved it!",1466553600,3,748,4.413043478260869

This item also does not indicate whether it is the UK version, or as seen on PBS in the USA.  From the gist of other reviews, it would seem that this set offers a synopsis of the series, rather than the full experience.",1465171200,28,338,4.184615384615385
