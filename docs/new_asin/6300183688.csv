217564,5,6300183688,"Almost as obscure as the Mark Twain novel is this 1982 video.  First shown on PBS over 20 years ago, this program became an instant favorite of our family.  The acting is superb.  Fred Gwynn demonstrates his much recognized versatility as an actor  and is accompanied by a less well known, but still outstanding cast.  The on location set adds real interest to the story - a story: ""Found in a jug, and freely translated from the jug.""",1102896000,,435,4.5256410256410255
217565,2,6300183688,"Viewers and Twain fans should be warned that this is NOT based on the well  known Twain story, but based on a previously unpublished manuscript for a  completely different story sharing a few plot elements and the title.  Twain's literary executor, Albert Bigelow Paine, chose a previously written  version to edit and publish as ""The Mysterious Stranger"" after  Twain's death.  Though Paine's editing was controversial, his decision as  to which was the better story was certainly correct. The dark satire and  human insight present in the better known version are completely missing  here and replaced by  warmed over ""Connecticut Yankee"" style  adventures.  The film's producers claim this version is the version Twain  intended to publish based primarily on chronology, though the author left  all versions unfinished when he died.
Pleasant enough as family fare, a  rather bland story -- particularly in the shadow of the other ""The  Mysterious Stranger.""",968371200,13,960,5.342281879194631

7804198,5,6300183688,One of our favorite movies. Had it converted to DVD so we can watch it now. Best one of the Mark Twain classics.,1419724800,,112,3.9130434782608696

7804201,5,6300183688,"The opening explanation of the original work is most informative and the production itself is very well done.  The story line shows a side of Mark Twain many readers never knew.  Outstanding casting, acting, set selection, research for accuracy to Mark Twain's original work.  I first met Mark Twain's work in elementary school with Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, and loved it.  I wish PBS would do it as part of its Classic series.  Any who enjoy Mark Twain should add this to their collection.",1393372800,,507,4.848837209302325
7804202,5,6300183688,"The Mysterious Stranger is certainly an obscure book and very rarely do people actually read the ""No. 44"" version (the real, uncensored version).

When my friend found this film I couldn't believe it and instantly had to watch it. They adapted it spectacularly and the actors (Particularly Lance Kerwin as Forty-four) played their roles with charm and style and faithful to the text. Albeit, it is the usual form of cheesy 80's style acting, it was enjoyable nonetheless.

There are a few moments cut out, favorite parts of mine like the entire commentary on humanity's shortcomings, but it didn't bother me so much since it's a custom for most movies to do that to books. It still flowed well considering the source material jumped around a bit too. Also they focused on a couple unnecessary plot points like hunting for the hidden treasure of the castle, but in the end it worked out for the movie and gave it a bit consistency.

I'm just thrilled this exists because so many people often reference Will Vinton's claymation ""Stranger"" whenever The Mysterious Stranger comes up in conversation. (P.S. Will Vinton's ""The Adventures of Mark Twain"" is great too; worth a watch for a fan of Mark Twain.)

To be honest, I'd rate this film as three stars. While it's a very faithful adaption in some places and focuses more on the ""dream"" aspect than it does the book's commentary on human nature... I'd assume you'd have to know what was going on before you go to see it. They explain the ""mysterious"" moments well enough, but I can understand if it leaves some viewers confused.

The reason I give it five stars here, is because hopefully it will balance out the unfair one-star review blamed on the kindle viewing.",1386374400,3,1712,4.750841750841751
7804203,1,6300183688,"Although it was a struggle I watched this thing to the end. I've read Twain's 'The Mysterious Stranger' and, while this loosely followed the original, it was very different. The only good thing I can say about this is that Fred Gwynne was probably the best part of it. On the kindle closeups meant a full screen shot of the belt buckle, heads were usually lopped off, and perspective was terrible. As for the film: editing was terrible and the story was confusing. There were few if any fades in the film, the cut was the editing technique most often used and it was used poorly with scenes being chopped before they were satisfactorily completed. The story was treated in much the same way with scenes being dumped before they were adequately completed. Watching this was frustrating. Maybe this would have been better if I'd watched it on my desktop, but probably not much. The Kindle can't be blamed for a terrible movie.",1378598400,,924,4.674846625766871
7804204,5,6300183688,This should be required viewing in every school on the globe.  I had lost or misplaced my copy long ago and was thrilled to find it a few weeks ago here on Amazon.com.  This R-E-A-L-L-Y needs to be  re-released on DVD.  Truly a Classic in the true sense of the word.,1374969600,3,266,4.1568627450980395
7804205,5,6300183688,"This is a sweet, spiritual film for those who are not fundamentalist.  Pagans, you will love this movie!  Based on the last writings of Mark Twain, I give it five stars.  The film wipes-away any confusion, bitterness or superstitious vibes Twain struggled to articulate on his death-bed.  Twain was, after all, only human.  I think he would have been thrilled with the end-product!  There are allegedly two versions of the manuscript which he wrote and never finished.  These were not discovered until some time after his death.

The producers of this film went out on a limb with the controversial topics here.  The re-write of the story stays close to the original manuscripts without being pedantic or boring.  In fact, it is both inspirational and hilarious, with a surprise ending!  This film is hard to find and not available on DVD - a shame.  It is kid-friendly and was originally aired on Saturday afternoon television.  The actors are well-chosen.  The film locations, sets and costumes are fun, and the mystical-workings of The Mysterious Stranger will give you a good chuckle.  In the end, the moral of the story has a bit of a zen-feeling, freeing the viewer of the heavy-stuff laid on us by sex and the church.  (Yes, this film addresses sexuality as being something spiritual and timeless...)  The adults in the film work overtime to compensate their personal values and needs to be ""right""...  As a 40-something viewing this film for the second time, it is embarrassing to consider the self-importance of adults.  Here, they act entitled and abusive; even as they hire and depend on the boys who will get their Bibles printed on the first print press.  Twain was a master at making adults and our conformities absurd; but he was always speaking to our higher natures. This particular story is timeless, like a dream.  The main characters, forge a deep friendship that supersedes any sort of bondage.

This is a terrific film about oneness and surrender.  It is part of a series of films produced for the public broadcasting system in the early '80's, and well-worth buying.",1199145600,7,2089,4.872159090909091
