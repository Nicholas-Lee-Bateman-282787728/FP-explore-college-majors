7471143,5,B016HHKX7O,"Okay. I was a little skeptical of this movie. Quite frankly, I wasn't expecting much. But I was very surprised. Because it was from Canada, I didn't recognize many of the actors. I'm just not very familiar with the cinema of Canada. But the acting was brilliant. The story line was well crafted and brought out how complex the situation in Afghanistan really is. There were a couple of mildly predictable parts of the plot. But all in all this was a truly great movie. I'm a bit of a movie buff and am really amazed that I had never heard of this one. It is now on my best 25 list.",1525996800,,581,4.196428571428571

7471148,5,B016HHKX7O,"There have been a lot of bad movies made about war in Afghanistan, but this is not one of them. This is a very good movie.",1524441600,,122,3.730769230769231
7471149,5,B016HHKX7O,"This is one powerful movie.  Setting is present day Afghanistan.  Focus is Canadian military.  Story is about the workings of the military balancing military duties and politics in the region.  Offers one of the most realistic perspective on the war in Afghanistan that I have seen.  The sets are amazingly realistic and everything in the movie seem so real ranging from the environment to the people/characters.

The military has a need to build a major throughway called Hyena Road.  However, building it has been difficult because the supply trucks have been constantly attacked and the road doesn't have the blessing of the people to support it.  Thus, civilians are killed everyday as the supply trucks destroyed are not military.  In order to resolve this issue, the military is working with the local leaders to gain their support and blessings to speed up the construction of the road.  However, the local leaders have their own agenda and it is difficult to negotiate support from these allies as some offer the appearance of support, while others are suspicious and requires a lot of convincing to help.  In this movie it focuses on two potential allies, one has the backing of the CIA while the other is highly respectable by the locals known as the Ghost or the Lion Warrior as he defeated the Russians during the Russian occupation.  Both are opposing leaders and are in the middle of a fight for family honor.  To deal with the local leaders, one must understand the culture of the region, and the military count on one highly sophisticated intelligence officer.  This officer befriends a sniper commander who serves as his security for the negotiations that he must conduct in the area.  The two work together in their mission, but things get awry when the sniper commander failed to listen to the intelligence officer.

The movie has humor and most of that humor comes from the insider local guy who protects the intelligence officer at the most unexpected moments and he does all the local work that the intelligence officer need.  This local guy is the best ally the intelligence officer has as it seems he has uncles all over the country and can make any contact and seem to always know what's going on in the communities.  He also loves to clean (from rugs to chairs to windows to his hair) lol.

Also included in this movie is romance and family, as the sniper commander has a love affair with his female handler.  The two have a secret romance going on that's not allowed based on military policy, and due to the policy the two have an on-again-off-again relationship in which they want to be together, but don't want to get in trouble for being together.  It's a cute relationship and it demonstrates the hardship of love life in the military.  This movie truly shows you all the various obstacles military personnel must face, ranging from tempers and anger when people lose loved ones, to patriotic feelings that conflict with politics, to difficulties of team work and unexpected surprises.  This movie keeps your attention throughout the course of the two hours, and the acting and cinematography is excellent.  An added bonus is the intelligence officer's historic narration about Alexander the Great's difficulty in Afghanistan some 2,500 years ago and how that compares to the region today.  Just an all around well made movie.",1524182400,,3357,4.867957746478873

7471155,5,B016HHKX7O,Absolutely loved it.  Great movie.  It's a war movie but I enjoyed the intel. Side of it.,1522281600,,89,4.176470588235294
7471156,5,B016HHKX7O,"Extremely well done and exciting movie. The acting, directing, scripting, photography and soundtrack were top rate.

7471157,5,B016HHKX7O,"The Afghanistan conflict is nearing two decades in length. The public has long-since grown wearisome of the conflict. In large part due to it's sheer complexity. ""Hyena Road"" illustrates this complexity without losing the plot. It is insightful without being didactic. It does a masterful job of grabbing your attention without being overly theatrical and/or embellishing the facts on the ground. You grow to care about the characters and their interpersonal relationships with one another, while still being aware of the dispassionate savagery that is ever-present in a war",1521763200,,574,5.46067415730337

7471160,4,B016HHKX7O,"As the Amazon write up states, this is a story about an Afghan legendary fighter, a Canadian intelligence operative, and a Canadian sharpshooter.  The last was not have trouble viewing Afghans as people as suggested in the write-up as far in my opinion, but he was a sharpshooter and that's a terrible job that only a few can do.  The action sequences are sound, and the conflicts within the country seem reasonably portrayed and developed.  The ending too was good, if a bit contrived to me.  It was very unlikely that the sharpshooter would have ended up in the position he did given that a general was nearby.
  I deducted a star because there's an unnecessary melodrama played out, the dialogue is a bit too hackneyed at times, and the intelligence operative, while good looking and with a deep voice, lacked emotional depth as far as I was concerned.  Still, a very good movie.",1521158400,,882,4.688311688311688

7471162,5,B016HHKX7O,"Pretty good movie. Realistic in many aspects. Realistic to the point of when people die and at the end of the mission, what did it accomplish? What did all the sacrifice pay for? Not a damned thing. Not being cynical with those words but sometimes some missions end up being for nothing in the end despite all the effort and energy expended and life lost. This is what I mean about realism, not just the effects or the flavor given of an authentic deployment.",1520812800,,459,4.476190476190476

7471178,5,B016HHKX7O,"Hyena Road is a remarkable film about a Canadian sniper team fighting in Afghanistan. The realism gives you an unfiltered insight into the obstacles  the soldiers face in the Afghan war, and the difficulties of the mission and the prospects of ending the war. The acting and the production values are exceptional for a lower budget movie, and the interconnection between actual filming done on the bases in Afghanistan and the filming done in Jordan and Manitoba are fairly seamless and it gives Hyena Road almost a documentary feel in places.

The story is somewhat complicated and nuanced, and involves the challenges of the military building a road through hostile Afghan territory. The military intel service is trying to find out who are the Taliban that are targeting the local Afghans  building the road, and the sniper troops on the ground who are tasked with taking out the Taliban who are planting IEDs on the road, and gathering intel to  figure out who are the good guys and who's not.

The actors are all top notch and convincing and the dialogue gives you the feel you're watching actual battle footage. The interaction between the western troops and the local Afghan people is authentic in how difficult it must be for the two sides to come together to deal with the conflict. The film gives you a real appreciation of how hard it is for the soldiers to live their daily lives and to do their mission. It also shows you that the prospects  to end this war sometime soon are fleeting.  All this means that is not your typical war film.  It's not is a jingoistic war movie with cheesy Hollywood dialogue and fake characters, it feels much more real.

If you read the other reviews of the film on Amazon, you'll see a large number of one star ratings. That seems undeserved. The pace of the film might be a partial explanation. For some people it might be too slow,  this is not a rock-em sock-em  gung ho war movie, but I found the pacing to keep me interested through the entire film.  Some have criticized the romantic subplot, but it is fairly integral to the story and it is something that happens in real life and it was presented authentically and it did nothing to take away from the overall plot. Others have said there were obvious clichs especially where the good guys are all good shots and the bad guys are bad shots. Perhaps this is true, except the film follows a sniper team who will be excellent marksmen and the Afghans use AK-47s which are notoriously inaccurate. This can be only a minimal quibble. What probably riles up most of the folks is the politics.  While the film never beats you over the head with its perspective of the conflict in Afghanistan, the mere fact the war has dragged on for 17 years tells everyone there are fundamental problems. People who are against the war will object since the movie portrays the troops in a positive light, but those who are for the war will be put off by the fact the movie acknowledges there will never be a military victory there. As the movie said Alexander the Great failed to win a lasting victory, same with the Ottomans, the British, and the Russians.  There are no easy answers in Afghanistan, and the movie does a great job showing that.

Hyena Road is well worth watching, especially for people wanting a taste of what it must be like for the troops serving in that war. It will make you question what can be accomplished and what are the goals, but that's a good thing.",1517616000,,3459,4.574433656957929
7471179,4,B016HHKX7O,it's a good 4 star movie of war and the things that goes on,1517529600,,59,3.2857142857142856

7471183,3,B016HHKX7O,"The movie tries to insert  a romance into Afghanistan. Good effects and the only thing that made sense(unfortunately) was that some of the Afghans work both sides of the fence  for US and Taliban. Another credit to the movies is it speaks about Afghan values - panah - providing shelter/refuge to those who need, badal - revenge and their interesting code of ethics - muslims for 1400 years but Pathans since 5000. It does paint the Afghanistan war as a helpless cause. Which appears to be more and more the case.
Very few people are going to call a strike on their own position and nor will there be time for polite good byes while death is imminent. In a way the movie is like the war strategy in Afghanistan - does not add up.",1517443200,,729,4.392592592592592

As others have commented, it examines the Afghanistan conflict in a particularly Canadian way --- which means that each character has a distinct point of view and a unique place in the world. The film makes clear not only that each understands his/her situation differently, but also that each viewpoint merits the full weight of our attention and consideration. Both the nobility of sacrifice and the utter senselessness of war are captured. There have been many well-made recent films about our current conflict with the Islamic world.

7471265,4,B016HHKX7O,This was pretty good as War flicks go. I'm not sure if it tried to have some kind of moral to it but if it did it pretty much failed at that. The story line is pretty cockamamie about a sniper team and some former mujaheddin named the ghost. I gather it is at least Loosely based on something that might actually have happened but I suspect it's very Loosely based on reality. For some reason the film throws in a romantic link for the guy in charge of the sniper team. I thought that was kind of a distraction. A lot of the action was well shot even if it was a little bit on the implausible side.

Being a Canadian film makes no difference, a warrior is a warrior and and some long conversations I have had with those who served in Afghanistan and Iraq 'fit' this.  If you are looking for an action war film, this ain't it, if you have been there or have a loved one who has, this may help put things in perspective. I have 4 1/2 fingers on one hand, that is almost the number of films on war I've seen that actually have anything to do with the 'reality' of it. This goes on that list. Don't get me wrong I enjoy the heck out of a lot of 'war' films and action movies, they just ain't the same creature as real. To those who have 'been in it'.

The movie didn't have much of a plot because it went off in many directions and none of them were exactly interesting. Well there was which focused on this elite Afghani fighter who the movie revolved around and boasted about how great a fighter he was. When it came time for him to fight to finally see this great fighter in action well lets just say it was a let down just like this movie and for some reason there's just moments in the film where the dialogue gooes on for what seem likes minutes of One Nine Four Six Four Nine One Eight Quebec Quebec!

7471333,4,B016HHKX7O,"First, let me say I read some of the reviews and I cannot believe some people were so classless as to talk trash on Canada & Canadians.  Seriously, people?!  How embarrassing...

Yes, this movie is about Canadian military in Afghanistan but the nationality of the soldiers really shouldn't make a difference.  Other than the insignia, you will not be able to tell the nationality of the soldiers as you watch the movie.  In fact, unless you are military or know a lot about the military, you won't be able to tell this movie from one with American troops.

The movie was actually pretty good.  In comparison with the majority of the military / war movies currently available (and there are a LOT out there right now!), this one swings around the top 25%.  The acting ranged from decent to very good, depending upon the actor.  The action, locations, and scenes were on par with movies that have A-lister actors in them.

Two things I didn't care for: the requisite sex scene was unnecessary & ill-timed groping and the higher ups should have cut it from the movie.  The other thing I didn't like was the awkward F-bombs a couple of the actors dropped in a few scenes.  F-bombs have their time & place but I'm thinking of two specific scenes where I was like, ""that doesn't even SOUND natural.""  And I wished the screenwriter hadn't gone with that they thought the stereotypical soldier or soldier's wife would say.

Overall, enjoyable movie.",1474156800,6,1441,4.6892430278884465

The name of the movie is taken from Heyena Route, the road thatpasses through the valley past the Spur to Kandahar City. See for yourself: [...]

The story about what became the largest NATO engagement since World War II is told in the book, Lions of Kandahar. The author, an Army special forces officer, recounts the pitched battle for the Spur; a lump of dirt rising less than 100 feet above the surrounding plain. From its summit, the Taliban had a clear line of sight to the Canadian forces below, from where they could coordinate their troop movements. Whoever had control of the Spur had a decisive tactical advantage in the battle.

I could be wrong but I don't know of another film that has been shot on location during an active military campaign. In case you are wondering, that area of operations was, and most certainly is now a hot zone.",1470700800,,996,4.589887640449438

Canada's involvement, and their mission parameters, in the Afghanistan wars is the premise. This is a war story-presenting people trying to do make a difference. In some ways, they are making the best of a bad situation. This may feel very familiar, but it is a better kind of familiarity that also characterizes Hyena Road. They are a cheerful crew of well-meaning Canadians, usually hard working and competent, often unsuccessful, but never dispirited. This is a narrative, which interlinks the fluid politics of the Afghanistan people, and the necessities of military contingent on the ground.

This is a film that times can be rather visceral in its delivery, about a conflict where nothing is black and white  film worthy of a good four stars.",1470614400,3,916,5.052980132450331
7471365,3,B016HHKX7O,"Note: I have seen this movie for ""Xbox's Free Movie Weekend"" that took place on the weekend of the August 5th. So I did not pay for this movie nor I did not pay to see this movie.

The movie is ""R"" of course; there is gore, chopped off heads, body parts flying off, etc. It's your typical Army movie gore that makes you say, ""Dammmmnnn."" Hyena Road doesn't really have that many intense moments like with most Army related movies nowadays, you get a few, one or two major fights and that's about it. The acting is average, the plot was decent, the twist (can be expected) and the dialogue between characters could have been better. In some parts of the movie it was/it can be predictable, but I just wished it ended differently (but you can't change ""inspired by true events"" history).

On the Xbox app (where I watched it), there aren't any subtitles for when the people are talking. This more or less takes you out of the movie moment and confuses you at times when these characters talk. Maybe there are subtitles on different movie outlets, but I didn't see any on the Xbox app.

Hyena Road is nothing horrible, but it's an average war movie that you ""don't need to see,"" but if you do see it don't expect too much.",1470441600,,1219,4.384955752212389

Hyena Road is about Coalition Forces in Afghanistan trying to build a road deep into Taliban territory. But the film has several smaller stories going on as well that are the real focus of the film. Paul Gross is an Intelligence Officer trying to effect the ""hearts & minds"" of the locals citizens while Rossif Sutherland (I had NO idea this was Donald Sutherlands son, Kiefer Sutherlands 1/2 brother), heads a sniper team sent out on reconnaissance/security missions. There is also a love story going on which normally ""kills"" War Movies, but I found believable & heartbreaking. I was not expecting much from this film and I see every film that comes out about the war in Afghanistan/Iraq and haven't cared for many of them, (I found the similar new Danish film ""The War"" very unsatisfying), but I thought Hyena Road was just terrific on multiple levels. And I think all the credit for this really good film goes to Paul Gross. He is great when he's on screen as an Actor, he interweaves multiple story lines here beautifully as Director, and in the special features he discusses how he has no political agenda about the War, he just wanted to make a movie to honor the courage & virtue of the soldiers serving in Afghanistan--and he did that superbly in my view.",1468627200,,1435,4.675889328063241

If you like war movies and are a student of modern warfare and politics in the Middle East, you will be glad you watched this. It was beautifully shot but has moments of extreme violence and some gore. Not much, but the timing was planned to cause scare jumps...and it worked. The actors are not up to par, in my book, with Americans of the same level. Rossif Sutherland was not even passable. The greatest thing was seeing the Afghan war through Canadian eyes, seeing our courageous brothers and sisters to the north in action (in a movie kind of way). This movie kept my interest and attention the entire duration (except the 2-3 minutes involved with the love scenes). The soundtrack is extremely compelling for what one would consider a ""grade B"" movie (by US standards). From ethereal pseudo-traditional Afghan music to hip-hop Pashtun music, blues, 80's rock, and bagpipes....I found the music very effective and enjoyable.",1467331200,3,1100,4.734375

The military tactics were realistic for the most part, so it's not some Hollywood blockbuster with unreal characters. The one thing I'm curious about is why the Canadian Troops had no rank insignia on their uniforms? It was a bit hard to discern, who was an officer and who was not, and their chain of command structure. Is there a Canadian law against this? American forces always display their rank in movies, although not always accurate. This was a little bit confusing and difficult to pick up, since fraternization was one of the story lines. This was obviously not a big budget Hollywood film. It'd be nice if they pick it up, put more money into it, and develop the characters a little bit more... If they can do that without ruining it, a reach for Hollywood and their unreal unhuman characters.

That being said, the acting in this movie is pretty bad, and at times, painful. Also, the movie does portray some level of realism throughout but at other times is completely unrealistic, especially the last sniper scene.

7471556,3,B016HHKX7O,So so,1463184000,,5,2.0
7471557,4,B016HHKX7O,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Ask most movie goers about war movies and youll find that they think the only people involved have been Americans and those they are fighting against. They forget that other countries have been involved in all major wars. HYENA ROAD takes a look at the war on terrorism in Afghanistan and looks at it through the eyes of another fighting force, that of Canada. Jokes have been made at Canadas expense but the fact of the matter is that theyve been involved in most major wars as much as any other country (another example was THE DEVILS BRIGADE which showed how the US special forces were trained and combined with the Canadian team in WWII).

HYENA ROAD takes a look at the current war through the eyes of three main characters. Ryan (Rossif Sutherland) is the head of a sniper team for who the war is cut and dried. Those are the bad guys, we are the good guys, we take them out, period. There are no gray areas. They follow instructions and feel every stop of the way that they are fighting the good fight.

The second set of eyes on hand belong to Pete (Paul Gross, the writer and director as well), a member of military intelligence who fights the war as a game of chess, moving players from one spot to another, using every piece of data to make a decision. Pete realizes that there are more things going on that a straight out frontal assault. There are decisions to be made based on the customs of the land and the players involved. Of the three characters Pere probably has a better idea than most of what is happening and will happen.

Lastly there is The Ghost (Niamatullad Arghandabi). The Ghost was a fierce fighter during the Afghan war against the Russians, a living legend whose stature among his people is highly regarded. In hiding for years Pete wants to find out why he has returned, if he is there to help their cause or that of the enemy. As the story plays out it seems their connection is for the better. But more is going on beneath the surface here.

The three stories overlap when Ryan and his team bring back information on the fact that the Ghost is in the area. Having no idea who he is they are contacted by Pete and he fills them in and works with them to set up a meet. When the main bad guy Walid shows and abducts little children the team wants to take him out there and then but Ryan stops them from doing so. Their frustration is palpable and a confrontation with Pete inevitable when they return to camp. But as Pete sits down with Ryan to explain the situation, to let him know that the long game is more important, it doesnt set well with Ryan or his team even though they understand.

For the team the line has now been blurred. What is the right thing to do? Who are the fighting? And what plans are in store for both them and the Ghost? While watching the film you begin to understand all the planning and moving of soldiers that are necessary to achieve the final goals of the military but you also witness the fact that other players in the game, mainly the Ghost, have motives and moves of their own. And the main pawns being played by both sides in this game are Ryan and his men.

Not only is this movie interesting for the sake of looking at the war from the perspective of the military of another country, the story that it all centers around is fascinating as well. Far too many think of the people of Afghanistan that live in the hills as simple peasants but the truth is they are more shrewd than some give them credit for. They haven't survived for the centuries that they have by being just goat herders. This film treats them as opponents worth of stepping up to the chess board placed on the table by Pete.
There are moments in this film that will disturb viewers when they see how children are treated and sold by callous villains. There are moments that will offer glimpses of violence of soldiers in the field that are realistic and gruesome. There are moments of concern you will have for the different characters involved in this story. And in the end youll leave this film knowing youve seen a war film that tells a story, tells it well and is more realistic than most. This one is worth taking a look at.",1462752000,,4224,4.3595933926302415

7471561,3,B016HHKX7O,"Hyena Road takes place in Kandahar Province during the war in Afghanistan. Canadian forces have been building the road of the title deep in Taliban territory, creating a new dirt track that can be driven only in armed convoys protected by snipers. The road is strategically crucial to defeating the Taliban.

The combat scenes are technically detailed, with considerable use of military lingo and profanity. The challenges facing both sides in the conflict are raised. Some scenes are reminiscent of American Sniper, though smaller in scale. The cast of mostly unknown actors contributes to the realistic depiction of men in war. These are men sent to do a job, and thats what director Paul Gross focuses on.

Though the movie works as an exciting action picture, it never goes beyond to explore the mentality of warfare and/or its political ramifications. An unnecessary romantic subplot is tacked on to relieve the high testosterone level a bit. Voiceover narration attempts to clarify the motivations of characters, but is repetitive. Action and dialogue should do this job.

7471578,4,B016HHKX7O,"This is a true war film; it starts out with some serious and well realised action and manages to maintain the calibre throughout. It is set around the work of a sniper an intelligence officer and the locals. Set in Kandahar province where the Canadian Army fought, along side her allies, to secure the area for five years. It deals with the violence, corruption and the human side of the conflict and is all done within the microcosm of the effects this has on those involved.

It was written, directed, and stars Paul Gross and whilst I generally feel that you should never be so involved in a project there can be exceptions and this is one of them. The acting is all above average and the special effects are very convincing. It also manages to keep up the tension levels throughout. The relationship angle could have been stronger but the overall package somehow makes up for any perceived shortcomings.

It is in English with some Pashtu but that is not translated and for the context of the film does not need to be.

8736429,5,B016HHKX7O,"This film's viewership will grow. It speaks to the concept of HONOR, honor amongst humans, friend or enemy.  I piss on it; so it will grow. There seems to be some fast clip HD footage mixed within it. What the subliminal mind takes in from that HD footage is most interesting. I am impressed. That in am impressed is a rare thing to have happen for me, as i very much have, for all my many oh so many lifetimes, been closely allied getting rid of excess-energy-containment, yet always amplified its presence as a result of my efforts to expunge it all . I liked the movie. Thank you to all who did the hard work (and made the effort) to make it.",1534896000,,645,4.2439024390243905
8736430,4,B016HHKX7O,"Hyena Road is a well made movie. Good acting, good directing, good story line. My only dislike is that, as with all movies wanting a reaction from civilians, it HAD to have an unrealistic romance that plays no part in the operations of the film. Anyone that has been deployed will tell you that we are close enough to each other that we hurt just as much without the romantic relationship, making this part of the movie not only unrealistic, but unnecessary.",1534723200,,458,4.597560975609756
