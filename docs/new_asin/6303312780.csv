But I am the only reason it gets five stars.  The leading lady, however, was quite attractive.  The dance scene on the boat was an old rusted out barge in Long Beach.  The beach scenes were shot on a long stretch of beach north of LA on the way to Malibu.  The plot is a magic potion plot.  It is not the second worst movie ever made it's the fourth.  Let's do lunch!",1407283200,,534,3.9904761904761905
