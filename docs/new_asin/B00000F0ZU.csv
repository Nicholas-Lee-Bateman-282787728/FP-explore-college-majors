7907109,1,B00000F0ZU,"very disappointed in content; consisted of very, very brief statements by -- one sentence explanations of his books --  Sitchin, definitely not worth $20; contains nothing new that is not in the first, intro pages of the books . . . I am a fan of Sitchin, own most of his books, first time trying dvd!!",1198368000,16,302,4.392857142857143
7907110,1,B00000F0ZU,"The cover says ""Gateway-Earth Chronicles"", the label on the VHS says ""Gateway-Earth Chronicles"", however, what is actually on the tape is about 25 minutes of him giving a 3-4 sentence poromotional type description of several of his books. Not at all what the cover says is contained therein.
The cover copy states:
""In what ways do angels appear to us?
>I still don't know  what his view is.
""What are the earliest reports of spacecraft?
""How do dreams foretell the future?
>I still don't know what his view is.
""Was the biblical God actually an extraterrestrial""
>Yep, but then we already knew that, huh?
""In this fascinating program, <NOT> author Zecharia Sitchin, gives his stunning account<NOT> of human interaction with celestial travelers.
""Sitchin, author of six books in the acclaimed ""Earth Chronicles"" series and his newest ""Divine Encounters:"" believes that extraterrestrial visitors have significantly altered our history and influenced our destiny.
""You'll hear about startling evidence from scientific discoveries in planetary exploration, ancient cave drawings of spacecraft and Sumerian clay tablets that trace human origins to it's earliest times.<NOT startling if you already are vaguely familiar with his work, and I do mean vaguely.>
""Sitchin takes us on an inspiring journey <NOT> that prophetic dreams, visions, UFO encounters and other extraordinary events are the work of intergalactic emissaries reaching out to enlighten, punish, guide and comfort us in times of need.""
The jacket copy is an entire fraud.
I too, am sorry to say that I was totally disappointed with the video.
Totally wasted my money purchasing the video.",1084752000,3,1648,5.362934362934363
