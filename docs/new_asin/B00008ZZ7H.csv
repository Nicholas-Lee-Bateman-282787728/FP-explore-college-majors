7988353,3,B00008ZZ7H,"""Cracker"" is one of those series that, in my opinion, should never have played on network television; it's my belief that the show would likely have enjoyed a much longer life had it played as a cable TV series.  Since the American version of ""Cracker"" had such a limited run, it's quite possible that this may end up being the only DVD release that we'll ever see of this series and, as such, should be savored for the late Robert Pastorelli's fine performance in the title role.  This is the two-part series opener and it's a good enough introduction to the series, though the second episode tends to drag a bit, especially during Fitz's (Pastorelli) confrontation with a woman who has electrocuted several young men.  Look for Josh Hartnett as an intended victim of the killer who also happens to be Fitz's son in the series.

The DVD is pretty much a ""bare bones"" affair . . . there are no extras included and though the back cover of the DVD says ""scene selections,"" they either didn't work on my DVD player or don't exist.  Both episodes, including the opening and end credits, played straight through.

My rating for ""Cracker"" is closer to *** & .",1101772800,2,1154,4.577669902912621
7988354,1,B00008ZZ7H,"This one definitely falls into the category of ""what were they thinking?"" Robbie Coltrane made this part his in the original British series and this American remake does nothing but muddy things up. Whereas Coltrane was truly offensive but brilliant, Pastorelli is forced to turn the character into a softer ""likable"" version to fit the network sensibilities. If you saw the original, this one is unbearable. If you didn't, go get it now that it's being released on DVD.",1060646400,11,470,4.962025316455696
