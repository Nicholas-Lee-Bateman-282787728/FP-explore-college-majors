5839453,4,B00DOZNIS4,Very detailed documentary.  Very well presented.  The subject isn't often addressed in other Civil War films.  I'd recommend it to any person interested in the American Civil War.,1385596800,,179,5.321428571428571
5839454,5,B00DOZNIS4,Well prepared and informative.  This is a part of the war that is often overlooked.  Lee was lucky to get away from this one.,1382918400,,125,4.166666666666667
5839455,5,B00DOZNIS4,"Yes, just about everyone knows about Gettysburg but just how does Lee escape. Many are taught that Meade simply ""sat"" while Lee slipped away and this program clearly shows that simply wasn't the case. Well done, authoritative, and well-illustrated this documents what could have been the annihilation of the Army of Northern Virginia. It goes to show that Lincoln and the public crying out that Meade let victory slip away simply wasn't true.",1380412800,10,442,5.068493150684931
5839456,5,B00DOZNIS4,"Pace matches action described, maps and simulations support descriptions - interesting and well done. This Strategic Withdrawal models future similar actions, and is dramatically different from a retreat or rout of the fighting force.  If Lee had the sort of cooperation evident from our 'leadership' in Washington today - the Union Army would have ended this war on July 4th of 1863 in Gettysburg or nearby.  Much bravery and sacrifice was in action from both sides, and this was a fierce and hard battle [that continued from Gettysburg as Lee withdrew].",1380240000,5,555,5.087912087912088
5839457,2,B00DOZNIS4,"It was a tolerable presentation.  I was not expecting the review of the Battle of Gettysburg,  but I suppose it was necessary for folk who are not well versed in the events leading up to and including the battle. As someone with a history degree and a keen interest in the War Between the States,  I did not find it compelling.  However for the casual buff, the video might be well received.",1380240000,,391,4.388888888888889
5839462,5,B00DOZNIS4,"This was a well played out documentary. It had enthusiasm; a depth of actual information about the events, places, and people in such great detail and description.  It showed you where these places were and what these places look like today, even if the buildings may not be still standing.  That in itself gives you a feel for the history and puts you on the field. Great documentary film and loved the narrators enthusiasm.",1469923200,,425,4.72972972972973
5839463,5,B00DOZNIS4,An excellent overview of a lesser known aspect of the Gettysburg campaign. As buffs we are preoccupied with the grand movements of the armies. But the true professional studies the logistics of said campaigns. And the overwhelming logistical problems confronting Lee in a foreign land and the need to transport the wounded and the immense booty requisitioned during the campaign is fascinating.,1469750400,,394,5.370967741935484
5839464,5,B00DOZNIS4,"Little is ever mentioned about Lee's return to Virginia after his loss at Gettysburg. We often hear of a letter Lincoln wrote to Meade, but refrained from sending, where he criticized Meade's lack of pursuit. Perhaps we hear of the rains that fell and slowed down Lee's movement back across the Potomac. Well, the rains did play a roll and Meade did pursue Lee to a point, but there's much more.

For over 30 years I've been captured by the spell of Gettysburg. The story of Lee's invasion of Pennsylvania continues to inspire books, video and debate. This video was one of the most thoroughly researched and captivating on the immediate days following the famous battle. I read the book  by the author some years ago, but seeing the maps, illustrations of troop movements, and current view of actual locations, help paint a picture for me as I'm not too familiar with much of the ground west of Fairfield and have limited knowledge of western Maryland.

Mr. Brown has, with his book as well, filled a gap in Civil War history that was definitely needed. Anyone with a serious interest in Gettysburg should see this video. To quote the late Paul Harvey, ""Now you know the rest of the story.""",1466899200,,1191,4.661904761904762

5839467,5,B00DOZNIS4,A great video and a wonderful video about Retreat of Lee Army must see from anyone interested in this battle.,1465257600,,109,4.5
5839468,5,B00DOZNIS4,"One of the best, informative, data-filled, fascinating, clearly presented documentaries I've seen.  Thought I was going to like it less well than Ken Burns' Civil War, but no.  Makes that war seem appropriately horrible and concrete--supply lines, hospitals along the way, men crying out in pain, horses dying, etc.  Plus, Lee's and his staff's brilliant organizational strategies are explained, often with Brown standing where the actions happened.  Surprisingly good.",1465171200,,469,5.753623188405797

5839474,5,B00DOZNIS4,"This documentary was very detailed, so much so that it bears watching more than once. I was also impressed by the visuals that supported the narrative. This is a must-see for anyone that's interested in the Gettysburg campaign. It clearly demonstrates how the outcome of that campaign didn't end on July 3, 1863. The documentary is an important addition to the historical record of the Civil War.",1446422400,,396,4.925373134328358

5839494,5,B00DOZNIS4,"I always knew that although Jeb Stuart's raid for supplies cost the Southern Army the eyes it needed when marching in to PA that the confiscated supplies were beneficial to the retreat. I did not realize how all encompassing the plan of the South was to forage in PA for supplies to resupply its army.

This show revealed a lot I did not know about the retreat from Gettysburg and I am NOT a Civil War novice!",1425081600,,409,4.311688311688312

5839498,5,B00DOZNIS4,"Most Americans site Gettysburg as the deathblow to Lee's army.  However, it could be said the Penn campaign ended in a tactical stalemate.  This film gives remarkable detail of the logistical challenge Lee overcame to move his army with all foraged foodstuffs from Penn to Virginia.",1416009600,,282,5.108695652173913
5839499,5,B00DOZNIS4,"Excellent, well presented documentary.

We remember the Battle of Gettysburg. However, the aftermath of this horrific battle was a logistical nightmare for Lee's Army. Thousands of wounded Confederate soldiers; guarded by hungry, ill equipped, battered Confederates were forced to make the long trip back to Virginia plagued by torrential rains, Union Army attacks and often non-existent medical care for the wounded carried in the wagons.

This is story of bravery and privation that people familiar with the Battle of Gettysburg may not be aware of.",1415923200,,551,5.470588235294118
5839500,4,B00DOZNIS4,excellent detail but without drama...for would be experts it covers a lot of seldom discussed ground and presents an unusual conclusion about the retreat,1412985600,,153,5.416666666666667

5839513,4,B00DOZNIS4,"I enjoyed this since I'm into the civil war history and have visited Gettysburg several time, this sort of gave me the ending to this epic battle.  I would think though if you aren't into the civil war history and the Battle of Gettysburg this would be quite boring.",1410480000,,266,4.428571428571429
5839514,5,B00DOZNIS4,"Kent Masterson Brown reveals the logistical side of Lee's foray into Pennsylvania in 1863, and in doing so, challenges the popular belief that Gettysburg was the ""high water mark"" of the Confederacy. He reveals what happened in the aftermath of the battle and how General Meade did, in fact, attempt to locate, close with and destroy the retreating Army of Northern Virginia. Mr. Brown shows why that effort ultimately failed and how Lee actually achieved some measure of success in his campaign from a supply perspective. This video is rich in content, accuracy and gives a sense of the tension and drama involved. It is ""must-see"" viewing for both serious and casual students of the Civil War.",1410480000,2,695,4.948717948717949
5839515,5,B00DOZNIS4,"Very thorough analysis of the days after July 3, 1863.

5839518,4,B00DOZNIS4,"Being a fan(&A student)of  almost anything Civil War. This film caught my eye in suggested to watch. It didn't disappoint. Chuck full of maps,and reference points, too modern day roadways,and Various building that still stand:along with Kent Brown's vigorous retelling. Makes up for the lack of re-enactments(this is a good thing).It seems to be more fact then host's point of view.
 As another reviewer stated(I agree) much is said about how most history books,teachers,and movies lead you to believe. General Mead was lazy and over careful about pursing General Lee's retreating army. This documentary shows this just isn't so. Several  attempts made by Union General Buford ,and others such as Custer's(night time lighting raid) to stop the retreat into West Vagina and Vagina. In fact it seems to be the opion of Mr. Brown that it was on advice of his senor staff that Mead held back any full scale attacks:Along with very bad  weather over those 10 days.
  From Gettysburg too the crossing into the South  a march spanding over 50 miles. With wagon trains of Moving hospitals,P.O.W's  and supplies,reaching up to 21 miles at times. This film shows Lee's ability too turn defeat into victory. The maps show protective troop placement,and location of Hospitals ,and how they were moved with the main army. The final crossing too home and relative safety ,Lee uses trickery and the cover of night.
  Mr. Brown gives the approx #'s for each movement,raid,and the personal of Lee's army including troops,slaves,medic,wounded,and dying. The background music is a good help too the viewing .The few re-enactments shown are not to good to bad compared too other shows. Heck one scene shows a member of the Lee's retreating Army smiling,its quick but if you watch catch able .To me it seems very out of place. But all in all this is worth the watch for any Civil War buff .",1398038400,3,1869,4.923566878980892
5839519,5,B00DOZNIS4,"I just finished reading a book about the civil war describing in general detail, and using pictures and text, covering the events leading up to the war, the war itself and the reconstruction of the south after the war. It covered the battle of Gettysburg and talked about Lee's retreat back across the Potomac River. This film covered the end of the battle and the retreat in much greater detail than the book was able to convey. It showed the agony of the dying and wounded soldiers, the medical teams treating them and the logistics that Lee had to deal with in order to get his army and all of his supporting personnel back to the South. I had not known that one of the reasons for his invasion of the north was to forage for supplies to restock the empty Confederate inventories. It was imperative for him to get the long wagon trains with these supplies back to the safety of Virginia. I enjoyed watching it and highly recommend this film to others.",1395360000,2,954,4.488505747126437

5839521,2,B00DOZNIS4,"This is a good program for the real CW nut. Very technical, and very detailed. Not for the casual viewer. It's based on a book of the same title (I believe), which was equally dry and detailed. However, for those of us who love this stuff, it's very well done, and quite fascinating. As one who always wondered what happened AFTER the great battle at Gettysburg, this film (and book) explains it in great detail. It also is a good view of the leadership of Lee and his surviving generals, and their ability to escape with an intact army to fight another day. So I would definitely recommend it for the super CW nut, but not for the casual observer of CW history.",1390867200,,662,4.390243902439025

8595601,5,B00DOZNIS4,"__Retreat From Gettysburg: Lee, Logistics, & The Pennsylvania Campaign__ is a well produced and laudable work covering the often overlooked grand retreat of the Army of Northern Virginia following its tactical defeat at Gettysburg. Ambulance train spanning more than 50 miles, a sizeable commissary, nail biting rear guard movements, as well as a coordinated and orderly retreat back into Virginia, alongside brisk encounters with determined Union units, this title gives a lot of specifics and numbers for both armies, which blends well with its aerial coverage, animated maps, and onsite narration.

While many have regurgitated from the charge of Little Round Top to Pickett's assault, few have given attention to details of Lee's retreat, which was one of the most complex and grandest of the war. Professor Gary W. Gallagher once said, ""the Battle of Gettysburg was not as big a deal as people think today,"" for Lee said following the battle, the Army of the Potomac would now be ""quiet for six months."" The two armies, consequently, would not clash again until the Wilderness, which was ten months later. Lee also said, the losses sustained at Gettysburg would have been suffered if we would have stayed and fought in northern Virginia.

The fight across the Mason and Dixon, although a Federal tactical victory, according to firsthand accounts, was just another hard fought encounter with the enemy, but it was neither a turning point in the conflict nor a turning point in the Eastern Theater, for the fight would continue for nearly two more years and hundreds of thousands more in casualties. What is noteworthy, is that while Lee was repulsed at Gettysburg, Meade, besides harassing a few hospital trains, held no conviction on pursuing and pressing the fight again with a wounded, yet dogged Rebel army. Meade understood that Lee was beaten but no where near destroyed, a striking sentiment echoed by Lincoln with the words that Meade had lost an opportunity with Lee, that is to pursue and destroy him. Aside from this action being in Pennsylvania, it reminds the reviewer of the North's Chickamauga. So thought Lincoln, at least in lost opportunities.

Great watch on a subject that has long been neglected, the complex yet well implemented logistical retreat of the Army of Northern Virginia. Good commentary, color maps showing from army to brigade and rearguard positions and actions, period photos, onsite visuals, explanation of terrain influence, and lesser known facts of the exhaustive retreat.",1484784000,,2516,5.161764705882353
