2193676,5,B0006SL2X0,"Love it but the version that was shipped to me is for Zone 2, so big  disappointment I cannot use in my French class the computers are set for zone 1!
It was not visible on the cover untill I tried to vision it in my class!",1367971200,2,223,3.74468085106383
2193677,5,B0006SL2X0,"Part one is the best but part two also delivers. Part two did not have the depth of acting ( for this genre) that was so apparent in part one and this may be due to the fact that some of the supporting actors in part one were not in part two. If you want wacky situations and characters along with belly laughs plus enjoy the French sense of humor then you should be rewarded. Jean Reno shines and Christian Clavier is disgustingly delightful.
If you want a contrast rent (and only rent) the American version of Les Visiteurs called ""Just Visiting"".",1365033600,7,549,4.392156862745098
2193678,1,B0006SL2X0,"This movie is region 2 only so you have to be living in Europe or some other countries like japan to watch it on a dvd player unless your DVD player is purchased from Europe.... Does not match the product description and renders the product partially usless. The product arrived late and the wait was definitely not worth it, since we cold not even watch it yet.... I recommend  you DO NOT purchase this DVD unless you would like to change the disc drive on your computer (note on ALL computers, you can only change this 4 times and then your pc will get stuck to the region and you will never be able to get out of that region even if you delete and reinstall your entire operating system, the only way to fix is to buy a new disc drive and replace the one in your computer with that.) Remember if you want to buy this product you must have a disc drive or dvd player that has come from Europe or else the dvd will not read on your system and the shipping for this item is very slow, so be prepared to wait and receive a partially defective product)",1357689600,2,1050,4.172413793103448
2193679,5,B0006SL2X0,"I found this movie in the library many years ago and was happy when I could get it on DVD.  Having taken two years of French, it was not such a foreign experience.  The historical references mixed with the time travel theme and the ensuing contrasts make it hilarious in a very profound way.  Everything is done with thought even though some things are a little far out (the ring).  All in all this is well worth the price but you want to make sure you can play it on your DVD (region 1) otherwise I think all other regions can be played on the computer.",1333670400,3,554,4.19811320754717
2193680,1,B0006SL2X0,"I ordered two copies of this DVD; one for myself, the other for a French speaking friend.  It was one of the few movies I found in French with French subtitles.

Because of this very French-oriented purchase, I checked that it would run on a DVD player in the United States (Region 1).  The description actually read ""all regions.""

I was very disappointed when the movie arrived to find it is Region 2 only and will not, therefore play on a US-made DVD player.  I am returning both copies.

While I cannot provide a review of the movie, I have it on good authority it is a very funny movie.",1324857600,10,591,4.327272727272727
2193681,5,B0006SL2X0,"Very very funny. The use of the ""medieval"" French language is clever. The cross-over to modern day ages I thought had been well thought.
Wish there was a Visiteurs 3",1322092800,5,165,4.533333333333333
2193682,2,B0006SL2X0,"After the surprizingly successful original ""The Visitors"" (1996), a sequel was made, ""Les Couloirs du temps: Les visiteurs 2"" (or ""The Corridors of Time: The Visitors II"" in 1998). With a much bigger budget, the same director, and several of the same actors (including Jean Reno), you would expect it to do great at the box-office -- even if it wasn't as good as the original. But it didn't do well. In fact, ""Corridors of Time"" didn't even recover one-fourth of its budget in overseas theaters.

The general story begins after the end of the original ""Les Visiteurs"" (or ""The Visitors"") and immediately tries to justify the sequel with a time paradox that compleatly ignores much of what our hereos were doing before -- and has them doing it all over again. Godefroy de Montmirail (Jean Reno) doesn't really learn anything from the event depicted in the original, and he ppears to be even dumber, which isn't as charming as the character's previous performance. Actress Valrie Lemercier played the role of Frngonde de Pouille (aka Batrice de Montmirail) in the original ""Les visiteurs,"" but since she didn't want to comprimise herself in this sequel to avoid getting stuck in the bourgeoise (or a woman belonging to middle-class) role, another actress was cast in her place for the sequel. Muriel Robin tries to imitate the previous actress way too much, instead of trying to make the role her own.

There is still some fun to be had, though. Jean Reno and Christian Clavier still have a great time doing thier respective roles, and I would be lying if I said this film was devoid of humor. It has some good humorous moments, and a mixture of good and bad visual effects. Of course, this sequel is not in league with the original. Several plot points were rather contrived, and a number of the gags went a bit too far (you'll see what I mean), but overall I had a decent time watching it. There are still lots of laughs, a number of new and different crazy situations, and lots of really good ideas. You really need to see the original first. Even the American remake, ""Just Visiting"" is better than this sequel -- no lie. Fans will probably still want to see this one, but don't expect it to compare to how much fun you had with the first film (even the editing needs some serious work), and keep in mind that the film is designed for really young teenage boys, so don't expect a well-designed script. You probably won't find a proper Engligh translated DVD, so you'll need to search for the French name on the Internet. You really are better off keeping your current DVD of ""The Visitors"" and just renting/borrowing the sequel, but since this title isn't widely imported, that might be hard. At least I warned you.",1140825600,10,2717,4.658333333333333

8042640,5,B0006SL2X0,"This is crazy slap stick French humor at it's best. I have just gotten to where I can listen and understand what is said, and though they speak a version of French that is old timey, it adds brilliantly to the humor. French humor relies on timing a great deal, and in these two movies they director is brilliant.",1487808000,,312,4.305084745762712

8042642,5,B0006SL2X0,"I discovered Les Visiteurs in my local library some fifteen years ago and it's been my favorite comedy ever since.  I took two years of French in college so it's interesting also from a language standpoint.  #2 is also very good but it's in a region 2 format which is inconvenient.  Otherwise I recommend these for anyone not intimidated by subtitles and who appreciates true French, even though it's a caricature produced by liberals.",1470528000,,435,4.851351351351352

I'm going to look for this part two movie?, But I won't pay no more than $5.00 for a used DVD..and it better be a excellent movie at that. which very few are?... I once bought a Eric Clapton concert it was recorded on the PAL platform Region 2?. But I keep it because it played on my PC, since than I bought an All Region Blu-Disc player for $160.00 got a good deal on it since I was looking to buy a Blu-Ray player with a 2 year warranty.it's been a year and it works great I'm happy I can play any DVD or Blu-DVD from any country.",1379030400,,716,3.9791666666666665
