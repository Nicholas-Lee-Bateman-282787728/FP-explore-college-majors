8519899,5,B007OWUUCK,"Mel Brooks & Carl Reiner came up with this comedy classic many years ago, and according to Brooks, had to be convinced to record it by one of their colleagues. Well, they did, and the result was a comedy album that was made into a half-hour animated TV special that has just now seen the light of day on DVD. This is pure, unadulterated GENIUS. Clean material you can play for anyone, and just plain FUNNY! The answers toi the reporter's questions are absolutely priceless, and their facal expressions are just as priceless. Wonderfully presented, nicely animated and not the least bit overdone. Worth every penny even if you've never heard this material before. This is a masterpiece that was indeed a happy accident! Enjoy!!!",1336694400,6,727,4.824
