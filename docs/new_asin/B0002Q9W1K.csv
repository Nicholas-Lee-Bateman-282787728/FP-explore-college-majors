What I like is the reviews that I don't get from other vendors. That's what keep me coming back. Yes, sometimes it may cost more but you make it up in support! This Amine is not filled with all the fluff and fanfare. It's entertaining!",1290902400,,398,4.1688311688311686
8030647,4,B0002Q9W1K,"Without going into great detail about the episodes contained on this disc i am going to try and give you a good idea about what is happening with Stellvia. From what I have gathered this disc is mostly dedicated to character development where the main character ""Shepone"" (SP?) is dealing with her own self doubts and inabilities as she sees them. Through out this disc we see her grow into a more confident person who can actually pilot a Bianca without hurting herself or others. Mostly the series at this point is preparing for the ""Second Wave"" but during this disc we see that the Stellvia and the other foundations are spending a bit of time in some athletic events like the Lighting Joust. Compare it to the Olympics if you will . . . all the foundations get together and play games to see who can claim the right of champion! The dub is done extremely well and all the voice actors seem well matched to the characters that they represent. I am glad to see that this anime has a decently developing story line and best of all . . . it is great to watch because it still keeps you interested while not having much in the way of blatant fan service! Definitely one for the collectors chest!!!",1108857600,,1197,4.420814479638009
