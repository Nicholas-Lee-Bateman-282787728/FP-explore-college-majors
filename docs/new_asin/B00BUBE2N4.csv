5674589,4,B00BUBE2N4,"Yoonhee is a Korean writer who hasn't had a book published in three years.  Her editor is threatening that if she doesnt turn in something soon, shell have to pay back the advance she received.  So she is seeking new material when an old friend, Seo-Yeon, tells her of a Vietnamese curse.  Muoi was a woman who lived 100 years ago who fell in love with a painter, but he turned his back on her and she was disfigured by the mans fiancee.  A curse was born but Muois vengeful spirit was eventually trapped inside her portrait.

Yoonhee travels to Vietnam so Seo-Yeon can take her to the historical locations in the story of Muoi, but soon after arriving, Yoonhee begins to experience strange sights and sounds, and shes beginning to suspect the curse of Muoi is not only real, but has been unleashed on her.

This isn't helped by the fact that, in her last book, Secrets and Lies, she wrote a fictionalized account of her friend, Seo-Yeon, and didn't paint the woman in a very positive light at all.

MUOI: The Legend of a Portrait is a pretty suspenseful movie.  Written by Zizak and writer/director Tae-keyong Kim, MUOI is a movie that takes its time in getting where its going, but somehow manages to SEEM as if its already there a lot sooner than it is.  Yoonhee experiences ghost activity on her first night in Vietnam when she and Seo-Yeon are in their hotel room.  At first this seems important, then later it doesnt and you question the writers and directors choice for including it.  But in the end, maybe it WAS important.  Maybe it was a sign of things to come.  Maybe theres deeper meaning there.  Whatever the answer, nothing seems wasted in these 93 minutes.

An Jo as Yoonhee and Ya-ryeon Cha as Seo-Yeon give excellent performances as the childhood friends who are now trying to keep secrets from each other while pretending that everything is as its always been with them.  Yoonhees alienation at a wine party with Seo-Yeon and her friends, with everyone speaking Vietnamese, except Yoonhee who doesnt speak the language, is clear as day with just a look from An Jo, while Ya-ryeon Chas character knows what shes doing to her old friend, but smiles through it and pretends like theres nothing wrong.  These were very nuanced performances and they added a whole other level to the plot.

MUOI is a beautifully shot movie that is able to tell a story with the camera even when theres no dialogue.

Now, as a horror movie, its not the most frightening thing Ive ever seen, but there were some very intense moments and some excellent camera work with the ghosts.  MUOI: The Legend of a Portrait was worth the hour and a half.",1389571200,,2637,4.582089552238806
5674590,1,B00BUBE2N4,"Muoi is a paint-by-numbers Korean horror flick about a ghost of vengeance (a ghost with a GRUDGE, if you will) that lives in a painting (as opposed to, say, a videotape, or a cell phone). Sounds super original, right?

You can probably guess my issues with Muoi. We've been down this road in countless other Asian horror movies over the past decade or so, and Muoi has absolutely nothing unique to add to the mix. It even manages to be a slightly worse movie than the films it is so blatantly ripping off, due to wooden acting and cheeseball special effects.

Muoi almost achieves two stars, solely because it descends into comical horror schlock in the last ten minutes of the film, which is a delightful change of pace from the utterly boring and predictable rest of the film. Sadly, Muoi even manages to ruin that fun by then ending exactly how you thought it would from about five minutes in.

Bottom line: Avoid Muoi at all costs. There really is no reason to recommend this film when movies like the Grudge, the Ring, or One Missed Call have already been around for years and years and have done this exact story, only better.",1388016000,,1132,4.53921568627451

5674595,4,B00BUBE2N4,"Generally considered the first horror film in Vietnam after the Fall of Saigon and a joint endeavor by South Korea and Vietnam, the movie is a departure from the usual output of the two countries' tele-novels and romances to the local Asian markets (South Korea's horror output is usually targeted to South Korean, Japan, Philippines, and the United States).  Utilizing the local Vietnamese legion of Muoi, an vengeful spirit trapped it a portrait. The movie becomes more complicated than the description would lead you to believe.  Turns and twists come at the viewer at a breakneck speed toward the end of the movie which leaves the story open for a sequel that is not currently in development. That is not to say that the viewer cannot see the twist coming a mile away, it is obvious who is calling the spirit from the beginning and the motive for the vengeance is laid out early in the movie. It might seem that the first half is nothing but filler, but the movie takes its time to build up to the conclusion, showing just enough scares and ominous atmosphere to keep the viewer interested... and at time confused.  Take my word for it, it makes sense in the end. About the end, the movie does not stop where you would expect of current movies, but keeps up with a high speed conclusion that leaves the viewer both sympathetic and disturbed about the implications.
The acting seems to be on par with what one would find in an Asian horror movie, lots of shocked looks, confusion, and straight out terror.  Not the best acting, but better than most. The two leads, Jo An as the writer Yoon-hee and Cha Ye-ryeon as the wronged Seo-yeon, play off each other well, you are never quite sure if Seo-yeon is angry until the end of the movie.
The special effects are not spectacular but then not much is really needed for this type of story, all the scenes play well with the physical effects (though there is still some cgi sparingly used) and is a welcome break for the all-CGI laden flics.
This is a good popcorn movie to see with you date, not enough scares to throw off those less hardened to modern horror but enough for the less initiated to watch while huddled close to the significant other.",1367107200,6,2196,4.565989847715736
5674596,2,B00BUBE2N4,"I think this movie had great potential, but it got too bogged down in attempting to have the viewer guess at everything.  The problem, at least for me, is that I guessed it all so early on.  There was no real build-up for me be because I knew where it was headed and by who.  There was little for me to wonder about and puzzle together.  Now, if someone has not seen similar movies before, then likely they would find it quite entertaining and a good mystery.

The story of Muoi and her curse is very good, touching, and frightening in itself, but this film did not make full use of that, in my opinion.  I felt that the film-makers wanted to blend the past and the present and the people of the past and the present all together with the curse, but I was unable to care about any of the characters, especially in the present.

I love films that have subtle touches, and ""Muoi"" has those in abundance.  It was pretty well filmed and well acted, but the script left no room for real suspense.  Again, that is my personal opinion.

Overall, I don't think I would watch this movie again, but I would recommend it to others because I'm sure that many people would find this film creepy and clever.  While I found it to have its moments, they were just to few and far between for me because I found it so predictable.

I wish I could give ""Muoi"" 2 1/2 stars because I did not dislike it, but I don't want to give it 3 stars because I didn't find it very satisfying.",1366070400,5,1460,4.212230215827338
5674597,4,B00BUBE2N4,"Muoi is a rarity. It is a smart horror flick.

While I can complain a tiny bit up front that I would have liked to see them spend a bit more on special effects with the ghost's big reveal, the story line, character development, and overall tenseness is right on target.

It follows the story of a young Korean girl who goes to Thailand to visit a one time friend and research a ghost story. Things already seem a bit off kilter in the opening scene, but you put it aside, leaving it niggling about in your head as the main character goes onwards. As the plot unfolds, these niggling doubts start multiplying and you are torn as more and more information is given to you. At the end, the movie earns its horror title in spades as you are horrified on multiple levels. When the last scenes play, the movie bows out with a elegant twist that makes you both smile and cringe.

It is subtitled, but unlike other movies it gives you time to both read the captions as keep an eye on the action. This movie doesn't strike me as a big budget production (poor ghost) but it takes advantage of being intelligent instead. There are no huge multi-million dollar scenes of things blowing up or spurting blood. Things are small and private or common everyday scenes of Thailand. In those small private scenes and everyday life moments, this movie delivers a tiny masterpiece. Perhaps movie makers should pay attention to this one so instead of throwing gallons of blood and pricey special effects, they could focus on just how horrifying something can be when it is in your personal space. Save the big effects for one spectacular thing, like Muoi's big reveal, and let us be terrified surrounded by people brushing by in the street, pretty flowers around the dinner table, and getting dressed for dinner out with our friends.",1365379200,13,1811,4.583333333333333

5674604,2,B00BUBE2N4,"Muoi: The Legend of a Portrait (Tae-yong Kim, 2007)

I swear up, down, and sideways that I first watched Muoi: The Legend of a Portrait when I was hospitalized almost a year ago. A couple of days later when I was updating the list, I looked at the poster and synopsis and realized I didn't remember a blessed thing about the movie, so I removed it. I got round to watching it last night, and that was a good decision; if I did watch it, I didn't remember a single thing about it. I also distinctly remembered giving it three stars (which makes me think I may, in my dilaudid-fueled hospital haze, have been mixing it up with Gidam, which did get three stars, and which I watched on January 15th, a week before leaving the hospital); this watch puts it much closer to Ryeong, the other Tae-yong Kim movie I've seen (Ryeong was his first, Muoi, three years later, his second).

Considered (according to Wikipedia) the first post-Saigon Vietnamese horror film (while Tae-yong Kim is Korean, most of the film was shot on location in Vietnam), Muoi concerns the trials and travails of Yoon-hee (My Little Hero's An Jo), a Korean author suffering from writer's block. (Is there any author ever portrayed in a movie who isn't?) Her last book, a semi-autobiographical tale called Secrets and Lies, lost her most of her friends, but once day she gets a call from Seo-yeon (Voice's Ye-Ryeon Cha), who it turns out has been living in Vietnam for some years now, and so may not have read the book. She floats the idea of Yoon-hee coming to stay with her for a while and, upon hearing of Yoon-hee's problems, mentions the story of Muoi, a Vietnamese ghost whose tale is just begging to be told. Yoon-hee heads off to Vietnam, the two of them hook up, and Yoon-hee gets down to researchingbut she soon discovers that most everyone she talks to is reluctant to give her any information, fearing they will bring the wrath of Muoi down upon themselves. This is not helping her writer's block any. Neither are those strange noises, nor the things she keeps just almost seeing out of the corner of her eye...

I wouldn't necessarily call Muoi a bad movie, but I would certainly go far enough as to say it's mediocre in the worst way. Everything about it is competently done; it is well-acted, decently-directed, with cinematography and lighting teams who are experienced and good at their jobs, the soundtrack is effective if generic, etc., etc. Thus we get to the real sin of omission: if you had assembled a team this good to make a movie, why didn't you even try to do something with even a single facet of originality? This is completely faceless work, just another horror movie that looks and feels like hundreds of other movies like it. If that's what you're looking for, Muoi is certain to take the edge off...but that's all it will do.  **",1397088000,,2828,4.58300395256917

5674606,4,B00BUBE2N4,"I saw the low-star rating (and I usually don't let stars alone determine my decisions in watching something), and selected it anyway. To be honest, I was rather surprised...

I kept thinking it was over, and yet another delightful death! Not 5-stars, but definitely worth the watch. If nothing else... because you have nothing to do. =P",1393977600,,514,5.0588235294117645
