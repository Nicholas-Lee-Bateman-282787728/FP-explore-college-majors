8600712,5,B00E3QJ81O,"I have seen this movie many times and went to see the Broadway revival in 2002.  The revival had a new book by  BD Wong and changed some songs as BD and others felt the original was racist.  I find this strange as Oskar Hammerstein wrote ""You've Got to Be Carefully Taught"".  At any rate, I love the movie and the revival was a yawn.  The film has a cross section of Chinese characters.  Sammy is a gambler and a womanizer. Miyoshi Umecki plays a traditional gal who is obedient and a picture bride.  Nancy Kwan is gorgeous and a modern gal.  James Shigeta does not want to have a bride chosen for him, he wants to pick his own and is fighting  his family's desires.  The teens are fighting the old ways. The Elder in the family feels disrespected.  There are issues of illegal immigration.  So much better than the new version which wanted to push a strong woman initiative and dumped the swinger/gambler figure and the song "" Don't Marry Me"" which is a howl. Try this musical",1497398400,,977,4.366666666666666
8600713,5,B00E3QJ81O,"I first saw this play in the 1950's in an open air theater in southern California. All I remember was the song and sitting among palm trees.

This play or musical is based on a novel by C.Y. Lee. Very well adapted for the screen by Joseph Fields and Oscar Hammerstein. They made everything look smooth and natural. Even the surrealistic scenes seemed like stepping into the persons head.

There are several other dimensions to this movie such as the characters are played by well know actors such as Nancy Kwan, Myoshi Umeki, James Shigeta, Benson Fong, and Jack Soo. To add to that are many memorable songs such as ""A Hundred Million Miracles"", ""I Enjoy Being a Girl"", You Are Beautiful"", and ""Love Look Away."" Most of the scenery is of stage play quality.

The basic story is a lot of love triangle overlap In San Francisco's China Town where eastern and western culture clash. We also have generation clashes. Seems like everyone is mixed up as to who loves whom. So will they be able to straighten this out? Will we learn anything about love and family in the process?

The special edition DVD has all the standard goodies as interviews with actors. The voice over commentary has mostly Nancy Kwan talking about her role in ""The World of Suzie Wong.""",1496188800,,1254,4.609865470852018

8600717,3,B00E3QJ81O,"This was a minor Rodgers and Hammerstein show but Miyoshi Umeki is like a porcelain doll and a total delight throughout the film in a role she created on Broadway.  Also joining her is her Broadway co-star Juanita Hall and this time she is allowed to sing.
Nancy Kwan is also a charmer but is dubbed by B.J. Baker.  Marilyn Horne can  be heard on the soundtrack singing ""Love Look Away"".  A $9.99 price tag for a Blu-ray film is an absolute steal and if you don't already have the dvd then I would buy this one.",1377129600,,511,4.237113402061856
