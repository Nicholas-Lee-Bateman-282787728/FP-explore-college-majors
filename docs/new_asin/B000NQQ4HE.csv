8181123,3,B000NQQ4HE,"In this 50's TV comedy series, the private secretary to talent agent Peter Sands (Don Porter), Susan Camille MacNamara (Ann Sothern) goes out of her way to help her boss in the most convoluted schemes. Some how she always puts her foot in it; yet in the end everything turns out fine.

Either a victim of old age or bad memory (possible the world has changed); I found this series to be straining for laughs.

The DVD volume one contains:
""Cat in a Hot Tin File""
""Dollars and Sense""
""Old Dogs, New Tricks""
""That's no Lady, That's an Agent""

If you enjoyed the acting of Don Porter then you should not miss him in the Bob Hope classic ""Bachelor in Paradise"" (1961)

The version I watched was distributed by alpha video and was not remastered (it really should have been). The images do not hold up well on today's big screen TV's",1523318400,,828,4.427631578947368

8181125,5,B000NQQ4HE,"I have always loved Ann Sothern in Private Secretary, and particularly in The Ann Sothern show, as well as in her movie career - culminating in the great ""the Whales of August"" - with Bette Davis, Lillian Gish, Vincent Price, and others - including her daughter Tish Sterling and I believe the daughter of Bette Davis or Lillian Gish as well, playing their mothers character when young.

Ann Sothern was a great actress, and her facial expressions are priceless!  She is a leader for her time, a bit ahead of her time - being capable of being a great career woman - not at all ""weak"" -",1369785600,,585,4.457943925233645
8181126,4,B000NQQ4HE,"PRIVATE SECRETARY (aka ""Susie""), which originally ran between 1954-57, starred former M-G-M movie queen Ann Sothern as the meddlesome Susie MacNamara, secretary to New York talent agency manager Peter Sands (Don Porter).

The show offered Ann Sothern the chance to revive her flagging screen career, and endeared her to millions of television viewers across the world.  On a broader scale, the character of Susie, a strong self-assured careerwoman in New York, was a radical departure from the domestic housewives that had been the norm in sitcoms up until that time.  Ann Sothern's brittle, no-nonsense comedy style holds the entire show together; and her chemistry with Don Porter is very strong.

This 4th volume from Alpha Video Classics includes the following episodes:

""Elusive"" - Peter and Susie try to convince the notoriously-shy actress Inga Kovar to come out of retirement.

""Her Best Enemy"" - Cagey Calhoun (Jesse White) tries his best to sneak a client away from Peter.

""The Efficiency Expert"" - Peter toys with the idea of merging International Artists with a rival agency.

""Two and Two Make Five"" - Susie is panicked when the I.R.S. want to perform a tax audit.  Guest-starring Mel Blanc.
