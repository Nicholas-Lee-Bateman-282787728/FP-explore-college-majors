I loved the uniqueness of CS,for the characters jelled together,with all the guest stars on each episode,with the likes of Steve Forrest, Richard Boone, Broderick Crawford,Suzanne Pleshette,Jeanne Cooper,David Carradine. This western, was too sensational I guess - like The Outcasts,Lancer,The Guns of Will Sonnet,and Laredo. No actress,could be Dulcey - but Jill Townscend.",1247702400,2,495,5.888888888888889
8216955,5,B000V76SXK,"My personal favorite of the 23 episodes.  L.Q. Jones is especially memorable with a series of nice monologues.
The 23 (90 minute) episodes of the CBS television western ""Cimarron Strip"" were originally broadcast during the 1967-68 television season, running from 7:30PM to 9PM on Thursday nights. In 1967 a 90-minute time slot seemed reasonable as ""The Virginian"" (1962-1971) had enjoyed considerable success with this expanded running length; 248 episodes in total. And before that ""Wagon Train"" made a portion of its episodes this long. Unfortunately for ""Cimarron Strip"", by 1967 the television western was on its way out and viewers never really warmed up to the show.

Unlike ""The Virginian"" and ""Wagon Train"", ""Cimarron Strip"" is not structured in the anthology style, a format better suited to the longer format because it emphasizes guest stars and a large cast of intermittently appearing characters. If anything ""Cimarron Strip"" went to the other extreme, focusing on only two regular characters and a single theme; the other regular cast members rarely appear in anything more than supporting roles.

While this narrow focus is a poor match to the longer running length, it is also what makes the series so special. If not television's all-time best western, ""Cimarron Strip"" is certainly the most ambitious. The episodes are set in the 1880's and revolve around the interplay between Marshall Jim Crown (Stuart Whitman) and Dulcey Coopersmith (Jill Townsend). Crown is a somewhat world-weary lawman tasked with maintaining law and order in the vast Cimarron Strip (named after the Cimarron River and comprising parts of Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and New Mexico). Dulcey is a compassionate and caring young woman from the East who has inherited (from her father) the local inn; a combination saloon, boarding house, and jail.

Dulcey's innocence and goodness inspire the otherwise disillusioned Marshall, who in turn protects her from what he can and tries to put the rest in perspective for her. Dulcey is obviously symbolic of the arrival of civilizing forces to the frontier but in a larger sense she represents the loss of innocence process anywhere and anytime. The series is in many ways her coming of age story. It doesn't hurt that Townsend is hauntingly beautiful, with a refreshing natural look and a hair-style that swept the country during and after the premiere of the series.

Moral ambiguity is the other regular theme, with guest stars often redeeming themselves with a final act of personal responsibility. Typically these characters are portrayed as individuals who have had to subordinate their basic goodness in order to survive in this tough environment.

Almost every episode included several top quality and well-known guest stars, whose performances were always up to the task.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1217203200,3,2861,5.22004357298475
