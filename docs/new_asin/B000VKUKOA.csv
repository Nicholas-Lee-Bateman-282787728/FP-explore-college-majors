2944803,2,B000VKUKOA,"First, I loved Frasier.  And when we saw the previews for this one, we thought 'how could it miss'?  I mean, it has Mr. Fred Willard!  So what makes this so sad is with all this potential, with the great actors and producers, this one misses the mark.  The humor is forced.  If you want to see some great comedy with these actors, go back and pick a good season of Frasier.  Or Raymond.  Or Cheers.",1190332800,3,398,4.157894736842105
2944804,4,B000VKUKOA,"Perhaps it isn't exactly the funniest half hour on tv, but it does set up the situation nicely, and demonstrates clean timing, and pretty decent writing.

Some of the side characters seem mono dimensional for the moment, but perhaps that can tighten up. Really though it played well, and while things were a bit over done here and there experienced actors can really make a difference and it shows.

The real question though is where it goes from here. It is completely possible that it will become overly moralizing, overly treacly, or just overly dumb. But for this brief shining moment, it doesn't suck, and for a pilot that is pretty good.",1190246400,5,643,4.732142857142857

2944809,5,B000VKUKOA,"The ultimate proof that TV and studio executives don't always make the right decisions, By cancelling this excellent show after just 17 episodes, they stuffed up big time! To me, every episode is hilarious, beautifully written and performed. Kelsey Grammer and Patricia Heaton are the two best comedy actors of the modern era, and teaming them was a master stroke, their chemistry here was dynamite, and with a wonderful supporting cast like Fred Willard and Ty Burrel, this show had 'hit' written all over it , unfortunately, the combination of a writers strike, and penny pinching by the top brass, saw it being cancelled. A golden opportunity wasted! One of the best things I've seen Grammer and Heaton do, the only upside is they had the good sense to release the 17 brilliant episodes completed onto DVD, we can enjoy them, and only dream of what might have been!",1464566400,,868,4.832214765100671

2944816,5,B000VKUKOA,"I remain confused as to why this show was cancelled. Featuring two veteran actors, guiding this clever and very funny story week to week with an incredible supporting cast. Each actor has an essential piece of the puzzle that makes up the well-written and acted story of a news room crew. Grammer goes from pomposity to humility when you least expect it and Heaton carries us from her stressed-out mother of an 11-year-old to a professional news anchor vying for attention against Grammer. This one season will provide excellent entertainment for all the viewers.",1431561600,3,563,5.0

2944822,4,B000VKUKOA,"Two news anchors reunited for Pittsburgh news. They have a past. News room full of characters are all friends. You watch them at work and outside of work.

Very Cheer's, Fraiser, Everybody Loves Raymond, etc like. Not political at all. But, the only problem is the premise around the two main characters' interaction at this point--their history. Not very family friendly. Not mature. Not responsible. Anyway, very Hollywood, liberal, Western Civ cultural rottish. But if you can move beyond/ignore/roll your eyes at/sigh at the premise the show is not bad. It is very tame. There is witty banter. There is silliness. There is humor. But there is a point. Not just plastic trees standing around talking to make a show about nothing like Will and Grace or Friends . . . you know to pay for the actors to get haircuts and date movie stars . . . give them something to do. Discovered that Ty Burrell guy. He is so yummy. I love to hear him talk. Would love for him to wrap his arms around me while I snuggle his neck resting my head on his shoulder and listen to the vibrations off of his larynx while he talks to me. Legs intertwined on the sofa. Ahhh. I bet he has a good natural smell. And I bet he gives the best ""you are my world"" hugs. Double ahh. Anyway, it is kinda bitter sweet enjoyment though. Good show. But only one season. As I understand it Fox hesitated. Oh well. At least you can enjoy one season.",1392595200,,1411,4.426923076923077
2944823,2,B000VKUKOA,if you get a thing for Kelsey Grammer take a look but he played Frasier for so long that I think it's just hard seeing him do anything this close to the type of show that he did for so long for me probably seeing him do something out of his normal character would probably interest me more,1386547200,,289,4.0
2944824,5,B000VKUKOA,"I watched this series when it came out.  VERY FUNNY.  The case was LOADED, I mean LOADED.

2944826,5,B000VKUKOA,"""Back to You"" was, and remains, one of the most sharply written sitcoms ever.
I was not surprised Fox pulled it from it's local stations. It was way too smart
for Fox and it gave a poke to local TV production as well.",1353110400,,217,4.069767441860465
2944827,5,B000VKUKOA,"I picked this up because I remember this being touted as a major hit when it came out a few years back. Although there are only 13 episodes plus threee features, it is undeniably the funniest, witttiest and best written sitcom since ""Frasier."" No surprise that the writers were ""Frasier"" alums. The writers' strike killed the show and by the time the strike ended, Kelsey Grammer and Patricia Heaton went on to other shows,Grammer in the sort-lived ""Hank"" and Heaton in another mega hit, ""The Middle."" It is a travesty that this did not have time to blossom. The writing, acting and pacing is crisp and of the highest caliber. You will be heartbroken to realize that there are no more episodes to view after getting attached to the characters and situations. A wonderful addition to any sitcom library.",1349049600,,802,4.776978417266187

2944829,3,B000VKUKOA,"This show is fairly entertaining and was a good value because I bought it used.  However, it falls well short of the quality of the writing and the characters in Frasier.  If you are a fan of Frasier and are interested in this show to see if Kelsey Grammer can repeat that high quality performance in another sit-com, then prepare to be a little disappointed.  The main story line revolves around a love child between two TV anchors. The circumstances that led to the child's conception were rather shallow and is degrading to responsible parents. As long as your expectations aren't too high and you can purchase the Season 1 DVD set for a reasonable price, its worth a look.",1326326400,,676,4.616666666666666

2944833,5,B000VKUKOA,"Watching the 16 hilarious episodes of Back To You&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Back-to-You-Season-1/dp/B000VKUKOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Back to You - Season 1</a>&nbsp;is not only entertaining and invigorating but a warm and poignant reminder of what was lost when FOX canceled the show after only one season.  The three unaired episodes alone are worth the price.  Patricia Heaton is gorgeous, alluring and brilliantly funny, as always.  Her skills as a superb, highly professional actress render her in command of every scene, literally at the wink of an eye.  Kelsey Grammer is at his alternating smarmy and heartwarming best.  The writing evolves from the early episode one liners as characters are established to the wonderful interplay of a beautifully cast ensemble with the potential to rival the Barone clan in Everyone Loves Raymond, two of whose veterans reappear here.  In the last couple broadcast episodes the writers hit their stride with the arrival of a hip, trendy, ambitious, disingenuous new station manager, a Eurasian woman who was, I thought, a scream.  There was so much potential.  But there is a lot of fun left behind, even though only 16 episodes of it.",1300838400,2,1232,5.621621621621622
2944834,1,B000VKUKOA,"The show was boring and there was not chemistry between them and it was not funny at all, I guess no surprise it was cancelled.",1300147200,,127,4.12
2944835,5,B000VKUKOA,It is a shame that this wonderfully funny sitcom did not make it.  Kelsey Grammar and Patricia Heaton are at their best in this show and have a great chemistry.  The supporting cast is also quite funny.  Fox should have nutured this show more.  It would have had a great hit on its hands.,1294963200,2,288,4.277777777777778
2944836,5,B000VKUKOA,No reason this show should have been cancelled but if you know Fox then you know to never get attached to a Fox show that isn't animated b/c if it isn't an immediate #1 hit its getting cancelled. So just like Arrested Development and a laundry list of other great shows Fox never gave a chance this gem of a series was shown the door just as it was getting good.,1286928000,2,362,4.112676056338028
2944837,5,B000VKUKOA,"Instantly funny, with a blend of characters that jelled right away. The chemistry was great. Three episodes in I was wondering how the heck fire could this have been canceled. Maybe it tailed off in the next few episodes, and midway through there was, IMHO, an unfortunate cast change that I will not reveal. But the show picked up and finished strong. Any fan of Cheers or Frasier (or a workplace sit com like News Radio) will want this. The Chuck Darling character, played by Kelsey Grammer, is no Frasier Crane, but more like a warped mirror version him; there are hints of Sam Malone. Patricia Heaton is excellent in a role where she is not primarily a wife/mom; fans of Everyone Loves Ray or The Middle might want to pick this up.

Oddly, the 3rd and final disk has a different menu system, and it seems that the 3 episodes it contains fall elsewhere in the story line.

I think that there was a lot of gas in the tank to fuel future story-lines despite the fact the initial I-am-your-father arc had some closure. Given that Mr Grammer went on to the less successful Hank, it is disappointing that this show was canceled. I will watch it again. There are some decent extras on the 3rd DVD, with many of the cast, including Mr Grammer providing remarks in a 'making-of' featurette.",1286582400,,1285,4.5344827586206895
2944838,5,B000VKUKOA,"This show was a dark comedy masterpiece, and I have no idea why they canceled it. It seems all the smart comedy and intelligent shows they cancel, and they keep the stupid ones on instead. Patrica Heaton was much better in this than she was in Everyone Loves Raymond, and Kelcey Grammer was amazing in this. The chemistry between the two was top notch. Fred Willard was also a nice touch to this show for those like myself that remember him in WKRP in Cincinnati, and also as Roberts bible thumping father in law in Everybody loves Raymond it was a touch of Nostalgia, and almost like a reunion of some of the Everybody Loves Raymond cast.

This show could have easily went 8-10 seasons. I have no clue why they cancel all  the good shows and keep the stupid ones. They should bring this show back, and cancel one of the many stupid shows they are shoving down our throats. Also I have to mention that Christopher Lloyd co-created and wrote this show he is a dark comedy genius.",1266710400,,978,4.427777777777778
2944839,5,B000VKUKOA,"""Back to You"" was the the best comedy on that year.
I was shocked when they SAVED the un-funny ""Til Death""
and cancelled ""Back to You"".
I always wondered whose idea it was not to give the show
a chance. Fred Willard,Patricia and Kesley were a great team.
Now that Ms Heaton is on another funny comedy, ""The Middle"",
the show cannot be brought back, but I do miss it and I hope
the fool at Fox who canned it made an opening for another suit
to take over.",1263081600,2,453,4.101123595505618
2944840,5,B000VKUKOA,"Hello, I know people who cried when the plug was pulled on this tv show. I did pick up the dvd,season one, which has three never aired episodes. well worth the money.",1259971200,,166,4.21875
2944841,5,B000VKUKOA,"On a simplistic level, Back to You can be imagined as a mix of Frasier with Everybody Loves Raymond, with a touch of Murphy Brown. It is not as great as the first two, but it is as funny. Back to You is a very high quality show in all aspects, but Frasier is such an exraordinary masterpiece, it is difficult to compare most shows to it. Kelsey Grammer and Patricia Heaton give superior performances, there is good chemistry between them and they are lots of fun to watch. The supporting cast is excellent and funny, with minor exceptions. The ten years old daughter is played by two different actresses, of which the first is better.
There are very few sitcoms as good and as funny as Back to You. Considering that the show was on the air for only one season, largely due to the 2007 Writers Guild strike, it is fortunate that it is available on DVD. It is a valued addition to our comedy collection.",1246924800,2,901,4.369047619047619
2944842,5,B000VKUKOA,"Yet another great show canceled after just one season, just like Firefly or The Dresden Files. I don't know what the executives who did that were thinking. I'd have been happy to buy this show on DVD for a long time.",1245024000,,216,4.2926829268292686
2944843,5,B000VKUKOA,"a high powered cast featuring Kelsey Grammer and Patricia Heaton who play co-anchors at a news station in Pittsburgh who re-unite (professionally and emotionally) after many years; well written and fun; Fox prematurely canceled this show but it will live on thanks to the dvd which features unaired episodes. At first, seemingly predictable and difficult to get beyond the actors' former personalities from prior hits Frasier and Everybody Loves Raymond, the two stars soon develop a winning rapport and chemistry, making the show inviting and charming.
the supporting cast of eccentric staffers at the local news station (especially Fred Willard)is a winner!
Though critics complained it was similar in format to the Mary Tyker Moore Show, what is wrong with that? It's an updated and sexier version as well.
Look for it on sale, though MSRP is way too high, got it at a bargain price on Amazon and makes a great addition to one's video library as it can be enjoyed over and over again!",1242950400,,987,4.951807228915663
2944844,3,B000VKUKOA,If you were a fan of Frazier then most likely you will enjoy this series.  I felt that it should have had a second season.,1242345600,,122,3.88
2944845,5,B000VKUKOA,"Place two strong personalities as competing coanchors on the nightly  news and you have Kelly Carr and Chuck Darling.  Add the fact that a one night stand resulted in a child between them and you have a lot of different emotions to deal with. The main leads are supported with a great cast (weather girl, sports guy, news director, and reporter) that brings many different personalities into conflict as well as support of each other.

It's a battle of egos as the two former coanchors have to learn to work together again.  Plus realizing 10 years later while on the air that he has a child with his coanchor is quite the challenge for Chuck Darling to maintain professional in the workplace with the secret.  Kelly Carr had told her daughter Gracie and the fellow staff that it was a sperm donor.

Still living at hotels, Chuck is big on fun and low on commitment beyond his job.  There's a lot of growing up for all involved as they try to sort out how they feel about each other. You could say the 10 years apart has actually allowed Kelly and Chuck to grow closer together in their previous huge differences.  One of those ""not a couple"" but have the chemistry to return there as they balance each other so well in who gets the ""best"" of the other in their conversations.

The network did mess around changing Grace's actress and dropped the weather girl completely.  However even with those big mistakes, the series still moved forward with style.  If you like blunt honesty...this series sure has it.  I have not laughed this much watching a tv sitcom in years so can't understand why any network would cancel it.",1240358400,,1620,4.567474048442906

Kelsey Grammer and Patricia Heaton were just perfect in their roles and had such a wonderful chemistry between them. I'm delighted that at least the unfortunately much shortened first and only season is now available on DVD, and I'll snap it up immediately, but it's just tragic that this show was never allowed to go on to become the long-running success it surely would have been.",1229904000,2,569,4.643564356435643

I haven't laughed at a show that much in years.  Patricia and Kelsey were perfect together in their roles as ex-coworkers and one-time lovers that had a secret child.

Who do we write to so we can see this show get back on the air?  It was GREAT.  I mean, it was laugh out loud funny.  I don't understand Hollywood and maybe I'm not supposed to, but they let a great one get away.  Good job, boneheads.

2944853,5,B000VKUKOA,"Back To You will have you in stitches.  It's such a brilliant, sharp and quick witted script and the casting couldn't be more perfect.  The chemistry between Kelsey and Patricia is fantastic.  Each episode I've seen, I laugh almost the whole way through.  Fred Ward is also in this and he is great in anything he stars in.
Kelsey Grammer plays Chuck Darling who is forced to return to his old TV station in Pittsburgh, where he discovers that he and his co-anchor (Kelly Carr) had a child together.  It's made all the more funny because they 'can't stand each other' although you know that deep down, they'd jump at the chance to be together and rekindle what took place years back.
The best episode (in my opinion) is A Night Of Possibilities where the staff car pool to work (Fred Ward driving is hillarious) and Chuck wants to dine by himself and see where the night takes him, yet Ryan wants to join him.
I really love this new sitcom.  It's a fresh show with terrific characters and a smart and funny script.  I can only hope there are some Emmy nods here because I feel they are truly deserved.  Treat yourself to this when it eventually comes out.  It will be so worth it.",1212796800,37,1179,4.421296296296297

Her skills as a superb, highly professional actress render her in command of every scene, literally at the wink of an eye.  Kelsey Grammer is at his alternating smarmy and heartwarming best.  The writing evolves from the early episode one liners as characters are established to the wonderful interplay of a beautifully cast ensemble with the potential to rival the Barone clan in Everyone Loves Raymond, two of whose veterans reappear here.  In the last couple broadcast episodes the writers hit their stride with the arrival of a hip, trendy, ambitious, disingenuous new station manager, a Eurasian woman who was, I thought, a scream.

Maybe it tailed off in the next few episodes, and midway through there was, IMHO, an unfortunate cast change that I will not reveal. But the show picked up and finished strong. Any fan of Cheers or Frasier (or a workplace sit com like News Radio) will want this. The Chuck Darling character, played by Kelsey Grammer, is no Frasier Crane, but more like a warped mirror version him; there are hints of Sam Malone. Patricia Heaton is excellent in a role where she is not primarily a wife/mom; fans of Everyone Loves Ray or The Middle might want to pick this up.

Oddly, the 3rd and final disk has a different menu system, and it seems that the 3 episodes it contains fall elsewhere in the story line.

I think that there was a lot of gas in the tank to fuel future story-lines despite the fact the initial I-am-your-father arc had some closure. Given that Mr Grammer went on to the less successful Hank, it is disappointing that this show was canceled. I will watch it again.

Fred Willard was also a nice touch to this show for those like myself that remember him in WKRP in Cincinnati, and also as Roberts bible thumping father in law in Everybody loves Raymond it was a touch of Nostalgia, and almost like a reunion of some of the Everybody Loves Raymond cast.

This show could have easily went 8-10 seasons. I have no clue why they cancel all  the good shows and keep the stupid ones.

the supporting cast of eccentric staffers at the local news station (especially Fred Willard)is a winner!
Though critics complained it was similar in format to the Mary Tyker Moore Show, what is wrong with that? It's an updated and sexier version as well.

Add the fact that a one night stand resulted in a child between them and you have a lot of different emotions to deal with. The main leads are supported with a great cast (weather girl, sports guy, news director, and reporter) that brings many different personalities into conflict as well as support of each other.

It's a battle of egos as the two former coanchors have to learn to work together again.  Plus realizing 10 years later while on the air that he has a child with his coanchor is quite the challenge for Chuck Darling to maintain professional in the workplace with the secret.  Kelly Carr had told her daughter Gracie and the fellow staff that it was a sperm donor.

Still living at hotels, Chuck is big on fun and low on commitment beyond his job.  There's a lot of growing up for all involved as they try to sort out how they feel about each other. You could say the 10 years apart has actually allowed Kelly and Chuck to grow closer together in their previous huge differences.  One of those ""not a couple"" but have the chemistry to return there as they balance each other so well in who gets the ""best"" of the other in their conversations.

The network did mess around changing Grace's actress and dropped the weather girl completely.  However even with those big mistakes, the series still moved forward with style.

The chemistry between Kelsey and Patricia is fantastic.  Each episode I've seen, I laugh almost the whole way through.  Fred Ward is also in this and he is great in anything he stars in.
Kelsey Grammer plays Chuck Darling who is forced to return to his old TV station in Pittsburgh, where he discovers that he and his co-anchor (Kelly Carr) had a child together.  It's made all the more funny because they 'can't stand each other' although you know that deep down, they'd jump at the chance to be together and rekindle what took place years back.
The best episode (in my opinion) is A Night Of Possibilities where the staff car pool to work (Fred Ward driving is hillarious) and Chuck wants to dine by himself and see where the night takes him, yet Ryan wants to join him.
I really love this new sitcom.  It's a fresh show with terrific characters and a smart and funny script.  I can only hope there are some Emmy nods here because I feel they are truly deserved.

Sadly it the closest we can ever hope to seeing this sitcom returning to the TV screen.",1211846400,14,584,4.969387755102041
3179352,5,B000VKUKOA,"This show was fantastic from start to finish, even despite the writers strike! The pilot was one of the best pilots I've ever seen, the actors superb, the situation had years of exploration and story to go. It was funny, clever, charged with great character (and actor) chemistry! The best sitcom I have seen in years and I hope someone rethinks things and gives this show a well-deserved second season!!! My favorite show of 2007-2008!",1211846400,16,436,4.826666666666667
3179353,5,B000VKUKOA,I now have a new favorite. Fish Story was hilarious. Gary creshishsishki (inside joke) totally makes the show. The timing on his one liners is perfect. When is season 2 going to start?,1207785600,10,184,4.606060606060606

3179356,5,B000VKUKOA,"I'm a big fan of Everybody loves Raymond and Patricia Heaton is one of my favorite actresses. I love her as Debra Barone, and now I have another reason to love her more as Kelly Carr on Back to you.
She is so sexy! I have the complete series of Everybody loves Raymond, and now I hope to collect the complete series of Back to you.
This show is very funny, and I hope this show won't go the way of many shows cancelation. If you love Everybody loves Raymond, give this show a chance.
Thanks Alan Moore",1190764800,,501,4.122448979591836
3179357,1,B000VKUKOA,"I rarely like Kelsey Grammer, and this continues my long legacy of disinterest in his work.  I also don't feel he has had a successful movie crossover career, most of his movies falling into forgettful tandemonium (is that even a word?).",1190678400,,237,4.780487804878049
3179358,2,B000VKUKOA,"I'm a resident of the great City of Pittsburgh, and the results from my unscientific survey found that my fellow residents prefer to see more Fred Willard, more Josh Gad and less Kelsey Grammer. Interestingly, my study also found that nobody in Pittsburgh likes Kelsey Grammer, could this be true for the entire country?

Anchorman was a great movie but cannot spin off into a network sitcom, nice try Fox.",1190505600,,406,4.8
3179359,1,B000VKUKOA,"I will not even bother to watch television this year.  Dumb, campy, humor for the vast majority of the show, then at the end it attempts to tug at your heart-strings with a melancholy Kelsey Grammer lamenting how wonderful his newly found daughter is.  Yawn - a big who cares from our house.",1190419200,,291,4.471698113207547
3179360,3,B000VKUKOA,"The show was funny and entertaining.  I didn't want to shut it off like some of the other fall previews on Unbox.

I will watch a few more episodes before I make my final judgment but for now I think that it is definitely worth a download.",1190419200,,239,4.0638297872340425
3179361,2,B000VKUKOA,"Oh, this was so bad - it's yet another in a long line of sitcoms where everyone has a snappy one-liner regardless of whether it does anything for the plot or characterisations.  Nothing new, nothing suggesting originality, nothing suggesting you'll be able to tell one episode from another.",1190332800,2,290,5.041666666666667

8219240,3,B000VKUKOA,"The first episode starts with a five stars, very funny...and as you're approaching to the last episode, the humor and a quality of a show itself descends, down to three stars...perhaps even two...
It is not comparable with a...Frasier show...this is not something, that you want to watch over and over, as the Frasier show...
So...if you're expecting the same dose of the entertainment, as with a Frasier...you will be disappointed...",1474243200,,434,5.126760563380282

Limited to just one season, some stories are left unfinished, but it resolves decently enough. Funny, but contrived. The jokes could have been a little less obvious.",1473033600,,283,4.795918367346939
