8652643,1,B00ANCWME2,I am from Chios. This movies is of terrible quality. Very disappointed in this sloppy and unimaginative clip. It is neither a movie nor a documentary. Do not waste your time or money.,1395100800,,183,4.575757575757576
8652644,5,B00ANCWME2,"This film is an important addition to my historical library of DVDs.  Unbiased and rendered with incredible images and the music by the gifted Eleftherios Bournias really gives one a sense of the suffering, the bravery and the struggle.  Specific attention is also given to American sympathy and involvement.  The bottom line of the film is the most important aspect of the documentation of such a tragedy and that is -- how we must all learn to forgive.  Very delicately and very powerfully done.  I highly recommend it to those who value scholarly reporting.",1367798400,,560,4.914893617021277
8652645,5,B00ANCWME2,"Highly recommend this well-produced documentary film by historian and scholar Dr. iljan Peter Ilich which includes rare and hard to find reproductions of paintings from the period as well as images of current Chios and features music of Lefteris Bournias complementing the film with an authentic Chian sound which serves to convey the lament of the loss via the use of clarinet taxims, zourna ottoman melodies as well as songs sung by the Chian Choir of St. Markella.

8652646,5,B00ANCWME2,"A sad sad historical fact of the Genocide of the innocent Xian Greeks/Hellenes by the Muslim Ottoman Turks against these innocent souls of Xios Greece.
What Barbarians these Muslim Ottoman  Turkish occupiers were.
Total terror, death, destruction and rape by these Bloodthirsty Merciless Heathens.
To pickle the heads and ears of the massacred women, children and infants? Who or what type of a human being does things like this?

Then the USA turning a blind eye to remain close to Turkey, all the while these innocent Greeks were slaughtered mercilessly is unconscionable.
Even drug trade by rich power governments back then, the British, were occurring as today.
The inhumanity towards man is unbelievable. These are some of the most evil people in all of Humanity in the history of man kind.

Turkey should be made to give an account of the Genocide they committed against the Greeks in Xios and at Izmir and all the people of Greece they murdered under the Muslim Ottoman Turkish Empire.",1364342400,2,992,4.963855421686747
