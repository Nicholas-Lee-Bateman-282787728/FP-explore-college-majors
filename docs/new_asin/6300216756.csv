287926,5,6300216756,"""LIFEGUARD"" is one of the freshest, most poignant studies of REAL choices in REAL life I have ever seen in a Hollywood film. The film's topic transcends it's age. I have seen it many times during it's 23 year  history (including it's debut) and remain convinced Sam Elliot's portrayal  of Rick Carlson, an aging California ocean-lifeguard, is superb! - Daniel  Petrie couldn't have found a better leading male roll.  There is a  'mystery' to Rick which Elliot portrays sublimbly and expertly. Securely  caught in the net of indecision between 'doing what he wants' and 'wanting  what everyone else wants him to do', he sits on the fence 'playing the  game' with all the emotional ignobilities a 'hunk' has to contend with  while making a serious effort to find his own priorities in life -- only  Sam Elliot could have captured the 'subtle' intensity of indecision in  Rick's character.
The production gave Anne Archer (his Hi-school beau)  and Kathleen Quinlan (his under-age beach lover) a huge step-up in their  movie careers - and they were excellent in the film. Even Sharon Weber's  roll as Rick's 'Stewie' was a dash of ingenuity - Weber was totally  believable and had the talent to make 'big-time money' in her all-too-short  career -- another Hollywood 'should-have-been'.
I've always enjoyed  immensely watching Sam Elliot on the big screen - he's always had a  ""Gabel-ian presence"" (when he talks, you listen!). I only wish  he'd had more 'film exposure' in his early career. He continues to chose  wisely his characters, even in B-grade films, and still has an on-screen  magnetism unmatched by many of today's shallower, much-ballyhooed male  performers (including Hanks, Willis and Gibson) - imagine Elliot in Tom  Selleck's starring roll as MAGNUM, PI!! (...no reflection on Tom Selleck's  magnetism intended - I love the guy! - in fact Selleck and Elliot have had,  arguably, the most magnetic appeal of any duel-male performance roll on the  silver screen).
LIFEGUARD is one of those 'quiet' little films that  usually slips through the cracks of big-time promotion. But it's 'essence'  remains quality study for 21st century high-schoolers and college grads  (male and female, alike). In fact, having 'been there' as a lifeguard  myself (and only 2 months Elliot's junior), I find 'me' wondering whether I  made the right choice as a systems analyst for a world-class  missile-producing company -- it pays 'real good', but the most, and  deepest, satisfaction I get out of life is still swimming in the ocean and  riding my Harley. Maybe I should have stayed a professional 'life-saver' --  or become a licensed motorcycle mechanic.  At least I'd be where the 'real  money' is - job (and life) satisfaction.
Hooray to films like LIFEGUARD -  they often accurately portray steps required by all of us in our mostly  'wimpy' efforts at life-making decisions. At least 'Rick' made his 'right  choice' early in life and, ultimatley, had the guts to stick it out - big  paycheck or not.
How many of us in today's world, particularly  'baby-boomers' such as myself, have the intestinal fortitude to 'listen to  our hearts' as 'Rick' did and chose a profession which keenly describes and  fulfills OUR deepest desires???....huh?....how many???

287927,4,6300216756,"I saw this movie when it was originally released in theatres and have seen it numerous times since. It is a great thought provoking movie whereby it deals with an issue that still applies in the 90's.  Should a person, if  given the opportunity, have a career that does not offer much in the way of  money but is thoroughly a pleasure to do or should he/she make a lot of  money and be miserable?  What better way to ponder that thought than with  a movie that has relaxing beach scenes and music and stars Sam Elliott  looking his best in this movie.",928627200,7,551,4.29126213592233

287949,4,6300216756,Seeing Sam Elliott's 2017 movie The Hero inspired me to re-visit this 1976 charmer showing Sam at his sexiest and most appealing.  It is definitely dated in its cinematic technique but the story holds up.  I think the movie succeeds because Kathleen Quinlan's performance is so raw and real.  She is completely believable and natural as a smitten teen-ager and her scenes with Sam are lovely.  This is a nice blast from the past!,1502064000,2,429,4.756756756756757

287982,4,6300216756,"I saw this back in the day and loved it because there is nothing better than someone (Rick) being true to himself and sticking with something he loves (being a lifeguard). As someone who loves the ocean (retired Navy), being at the beach has never grown tiresome. Some movies we never grow tired of; this is one of mine (with TopGun)!  The only reason why this is not five stars is the soundtrack. Sorry, ""Time and Tide"" never worked for me.",1471737600,4,441,4.444444444444445
287983,5,6300216756,"One of my all time favorite movies.  Even though made in 1975, somehow it has not become dated.  The cinematology was superb - beautiful beach, sunsets and people.

287986,5,6300216756,"This movie is superficially just another beach party movie, but it isn't.  As we get to know Rick, we see how much he loves his job.  But the problem is that he's now in his late 30's, and for how many years can he continue doing this?  Probably a question many of us had to answer in our lives in regard to jobs we loved vs. jobs that paid well.  Should he accept a friend's offer to sell Porsches--when he's really not a salesman--or does he continue being the world's oldest lifeguard?  And, as he gets older, the girls on the beach are always 16.  When he bumps into his old flame from high school, she is amazed that he is still ""down at the beach"".  If he wants her and her lifestyle he needs to make more money.  Great opportunity to see Sam Elliott in his prime and not playing a bad guy or creep, just an Everyman.  It's compelling; I have to drag it out and let it wash over me periodically.",1461801600,9,901,4.132183908045977

Then someone told me that Sam Elliot played a much younger but similar character in a movie called 'Lifeguard'.  Wow, Lifeguard is like Part I and the former is like Part II.  I was blown away by the Kitchy 1970's Paul Williams theme song 'Time and Tide', the gorgeous beach scenes, the many beautiful female love interests - all with their unique character structures, and the theme that runs through both movies - Sam Elliott struggle with first midlife and then end of life transition.

288029,1,6300216756,"A 30+ years old man, content with his job as a lifeguard at a Los Angeles beach, unattached, chased by women who are happy to spend a night with him, suddenly realizes that time has gone by too quickly and perhaps, he needs to think of the future. As if on que, an opportunity to land a prestigious sales job and to re-establish a relationship with his high school sweetheart show up. What will happen next? Frankly, I was not too interested. The movie is  existentialist  to the point of being boring. I watched it to the end just in case if something had developed. But it was so typically 70s!  Unless you like movies  whose entertainment value is mostly in watching women on the beach dressed in bikinis and staring at the handsome lifeguard, played by Sam Elliott, whose character mostly smiles and talks in monosillables, don't bother renting it.",1435190400,,852,4.622516556291391

Sam mostly. I loved most of the movie, I thought the Rick/Wendy thing was not needed and gave the wrong message, but most
of the movie was good. I think some of the cast could have had more experience, I think some of the acting was poor. However
I'll watch it again for Sam Elliott anytime, which is why I bought it.
Speaking of Sam Elliott, I met him shortly before Lifeguard was released in the theaters. He is so nice, not to mention gorgeous.
I saw Sam at quite a few gatherings of actors, and the last time I saw him I was pregnant with my son, he patted my tummy and
told me to take care of him. He also introduced me to his Mother at that venue. I still wish Sam all the very best in every way.

I think Lifeguards everywhere do an excellent job, they risk their lives daily, just as police and firemen, but they don't get the reputation for doing so, which is a shame. They save lives, and risk their lives, they deserve recognition for their work.",1400371200,2,1088,4.156398104265403

I love all three of them to this day and feel they have all become not only more beautiful/handsome but even better actors over the years. I'm really happy I chose to rent this movie instead of buying it. I remembered it as one of my favorite movies but hadn't seen it in so many years, maybe 30? It's fun to watch, definitely worth the rental, but not a movie that if I bought would watch over and over again. It's funny, the first time I watched this, being a young teen female myself I rooted for the 17 year old girl, Quinlan, and as a woman, 30 years later I obviously rooted for Ann Archer, the 'grown' woman. But Sam Elliott's character is a little too old for one and not quite grown up enough for the other. It's a light movie, enjoyable, a great stroll down memory lane.",1398384000,,907,4.372781065088757

It is a time capsule of the era, and distills a California aesthetic that is still alive. The core dilemma of the lifeguard is actually quite universal and stands up. Lovely in the movie is a young Anne Archer. And Kathleen Quinlan carries off the role of a bored teenager with great maturity. The relationship between senior lifeguard Rick and his apprentice, winningly played by Parker Stevenson, is one of the movie's gems. Yes, there's lots of tans, teeth, blown dry hair, polyester and small shorts. But there is also a quiet center to Elliott's performance that transcends any temptation to label LifeGuard as mere period kitsch.",1394150400,,790,4.773722627737226

288102,5,6300216756,"I saw this film when it debuted at a drive-in theater as a double feature with the movie ORCA.  I just watched it again for the second time in 38 years.  It was a low budget ""B"" movie at the time but it has haunted me all these years.  I am glad to finally find it on DVD and watch it again.
You really need to place yourself in the early 1970s in order to really get the film.  If you are too young to remember the 1970s then you need to know that there was real movement to ""be yourself"" and ""stick it to the man""....blue collar was in and people were proud of it.
So Rick Carlson (Sam Elliot) is living out his dream job as a lifeguard, which he is very good at and enjoys doing...but he is aging and is feeling pressure from everyone in his life to ""grow up"" and get a real job.  His current woman friend is thinking about going to Europe with a rich man and can't get a commitment from Rick.  His father wants to know when he is going to grow up.  When his 15th high school reunion comes up he almost doesn't go but does because he wants to see his high school sweetheart.
Most of high school classmates are doing well and he feels a little shame when he tells them he is a lifeguard...""I work for the County"", he tell an old bud.
An old friend offers him a job selling Porsches that would double his salary and would please his girlfriend (Anne Archer).

Rick struggles with what to do....he knows he is aging....he is afraid to make the commitment to having a family...

The end is surprising....the decision that Rick makes will leave some sad and others happy.  I think at the time (1975) Rick's decision is probably viewed as heroic to a lot of the audience....and not to others.

I give it five stars, not for the script, but for the acting and because it is such a pure slice of the early 1970s.  I love Kathleen Quinlan's performance...I fell in love with her the minute she smiled....my heart broke when her heart broke...

This is not an epic movie, but it is one of those little films that strikes a nerve and stays with you....like ""Summer of '42"".",1391904000,,2065,4.210659898477157

Elliott plays a lifeguard who is constantly harangued about getting a real job. It is a nicely crafted script, and great performances by Sam Elliott, Anne Archer, and Kathleen Quinlan lifted a low-budget film above the commonplace. This was shrewd casting, since they all went on to become stars.

If you have never seen the film, take a gander at a unique moment in time when Southern California beaches were uncrowded and life was truly simple. Its also a great story.",1389312000,,622,4.7592592592592595

288141,4,6300216756,"I was reflecting today on some of the films from the past that were a pleasure to watch, and impacted my viewpoint on life. Two came to mind: ""Breezy"", the forgotten 1973 film directed by Clint Eastwood, and ""Lifeguard"".

So I came to Amazon and discovered their DVD release, and good reviews.

I don't think the film was designed to be profound,but sometimes an ostensibly simple storyline succeeds in touching on universal issues;aging in a career,learning about what we want in life vs.what we think we should do, based upon societal or friends' perceptions. As the career lifeguard,Sam Elliot knows that he is ""aging"" in a traditionally young man's temporary job.

He gets the message from old friends,that it is time to ""grow up"". An old high school friend,now with a Porsche dealership,offers him a job selling cars. Even 32 years after seeing the film, I remember Sam awkwardly showing up at the dealership(a bright and sunny day, unlike the beach, and probably in the San Fernando Valley),walking into the garish showroom. The viewer cannot help but wonder "" is this a better life?"".

As in ""Breezy"", a man looks at his life and what he does,and considers where he wants to go from here on.

Both films deal with timeless issues in different ways, and both stand tall above so many Academy Award recipient films since, which assault us with social messages.
The films experienced little commercial success, and at the time were likely viewed as rather ordinary. But sometimes simplicity has its own elegance, and these films have themes which speak to the viewer of any generation.

I am pleased to see these back on DVD and would highly recommend them for viewing more than once.",1294963200,,1688,4.84375
288142,4,6300216756,"This is actually a very interesting story. Unfortunately, some of the actors are not as good as the others and some characters are under developed, so there is a little bit of a cheesy feel from time to time. The film does capture that enchanting time frame between the summer and winter seasons along the South Bay beaches. If you grew up in that environment like I did, this will bring back many memories. This movie is a good companion to the original ""Gone In Sixty Seconds"", to be able to see what has been long since built over in that area of L.A.
A word of caution, although the film is rated PG, that is also a relic from that time frame, as there is a bit of nudity that I had forgotten was in this movie.",1292976000,,715,4.188405797101449
288143,3,6300216756,"Yes, Lifeguard is a severely dated film about a lifeguard who has to make a tough decision whether he wants to continue being a lifeguard on the sandy beaches of California, or get a more serious job as a car salesman.

Along the way he falls in love with about 3 different women.  Which one will he end up with?  You'll have to watch it the entire way through in order to find out... that is, if you don't become bored in the process.

This movie slightly misses the mark in a few area.  For one thing, it's not interesting the entire way through.  Like many 70's films, the storyline is designed in a way to focus on a handsome lead character (in this case, Sam Elliott).  This kind of drives me nuts because there's more to a storyline than simply focusing *constantly* on one star.

It's especially annoying because the camera work follows Sam Elliott's character as he smiles, laughs, becomes angry at something (or someone) etc.  This is more a complaint I have with 70's films period.  It's like following the lead character around all over the place is supposed to be a good enough substitute for a weak storyline.  It's not.  As a result, the majority of a movie like Lifeguard feels like complete filler.

What it comes down to however is the fact that the storyline is just really weak.  The only truly exciting moments are when Sam's character gets involved in all kinds of weird or dangerous situations at the beach in his lifeguard role.  He deals with all kinds of troublemakers and perverts.

I felt this movie just doesn't have a good enough storyline to take up over an hour and a half of playtime.  I realize it's a 70's film so we can't expect top of the line storytelling quality, but it most certainly could have been more interesting than this.",1275436800,,1767,4.5062893081761

288145,4,6300216756,"In 1975 this film was released, and at the age of 14 the movie was about everything I wanted to be, or thought I wanted to be, when I grew up. I finally saw it again, thirty years later, time of course changed that, but it's still a nostalgic film, and a very good one at that.

Like a lot of films from that era, there are aspects of it that are dated, especially in it's look, the costumes, hair styles, and attitude. But there's something wondrous about Sam Elliot's character (Rick), and the inner struggle of his character growing older as a lifeguard. And the ending was both revealing, even a little inspiring. So while on the surface, this film might look like Baywatch 70's style, it has way, way more meaning than that.

What's interesting for me is that at 14 I wanted to be the hunky guy who drives a corvette, gets the girls, and is confident, quiet and strong. I never became that, and by the time I was 30, my life, and certainly career, was in a very different direction. But a little part of me still lived that dream. What made watching the film many years later quite interesting is that while I never was a hunky lifeguard, etc. I went through my share of relationships, career changes, and difficulties of aging in a changing world, which made Rick a character I think a lot of us could identify with. That might make this sound like a guy movie, but it's not. It's a good (if a bit old) date film too, and I think a lot of women would like it as well.

The film still looks good, with good cinematography presented in a nice widescreen format, the acting is good, especially Elliot who may surprise some here, and it sounds good. It's too bad there aren't any extras on the DVD. It would have been wonderful to see Elliot, Quinlan, Archer and Stevenson reflect on the film.

And yet, I enjoyed it for its looks at a simpler time on the beach in southern California when the guys wore Speedos unembarrassedly. There's a surprising amount of smut here.

And a movie worth owning for its historical value alone. Plus, it's amusing and excruciating at the same time.

This five-star pick is an absolutely horrible movie, a shallow tale, one that I'll bet Sam Elliott is embarassed by (understandably), and probably posterity's most succinct, accurate snapshot of youth lifestyles on the Southern California coast in the 1970s. I know because I was there -- I was only a year or two older than Kathleen Quinlan's character, almost as cute, and easily as stupid. It's more accurate than a docudrama and is as timeless as it is trendy.

""Lifeguard"" is a perfect chronicle of the horrific polyester cheesy-hair-and-sideburns brain-freezing-interior-decor, free love, bad dog 70s. Those of us who lived it, who wore those faux seersucker polyester jackets and bell-bottoms, those of us whose kitchens were decked with the sister print of the flowered wallpaper pattern in Ann Archer's kitchen, calculated to elicit spontaneous shouts of horror, know that it was even worse than we remember. We may also remember how the loose morality of the times made for a lot of cheap fun and worse misery. The tortuously sappy soundtrack captures it perfectly. The movie is a profile in the worst of 1970s America.

I give this movie five stars because it is so pleasantly and unpleasantly honest and accurate. It presents authentic insight into the bad 70s. They were bad. Worse, indeed, than remembered. This movie is evidence exhibit A!",1230681600,,1680,4.904929577464789

288159,5,6300216756,"Filmed in 1975, ""Lifeguard"" relays the story of an aging L.A. lifeguard (Sam Elliott) during the summer of '75. He suffers an early mid-life crisis when his friends and family continually reveal their disappoval of his career choice. This is heightened when he attends his 15-year high school reunion where he reunites with a recently-divorced ex-flame (Anne Archer). To complicate matters Elliot runs into a cute underage teen  on the beach (Kathleen Quinlin) who makes him feel like an Adonis.

I remember cathing ""Lifeguard"" on tv sometime in the '90s and all I can remember is what a great film it was. I never heard of it before but the story took me right in and captivated me throughout. This is truly a secret gem from the 70s.

What makes it work so well? For one thing the film is truly realistic. It's like they filmed a story of real people. That's how good the writing and acting is.

Parker Stevenson appears as a lifeguard apprentice who works with Elliott throughout the summer. The fact that he's a college student and goes back to school at the end of the film adds to Elliott's crisis.

A handful of items I found interesting in the story:

-- Elliott instructs Stevenson to not mess with the underage cuties on the beach who often tend to flirt with lifeguards. He then does this very thing with a girl named Wendy (Quinlin), who says she's 17 but could very well be as young as 15 (girls are known to lie in such situations). Elliott's character in the film seems pretty mature, honest and intelligent. Was he being hypocritical? I think his actions reveal the crisis he's undergoing. He's getting older and his manhood is being threatened by the numerous people encouraging him to get a ""real"" job. Wendy makes him feel like a man and he unwisely gives into temptation. I lost some respect for the character when this happened but, you'll see, he ""sees the light"" later on.

-- The film effectively shows that Wendy wasn't ready for a sexual relationship with Elliott or anyone else. When Elliott informs her that they simply can't be together her breakdown is potent. This leads to another event that, I'm sure, drives home the point for Elliott to never mess with ""jailbait"" ever again.

-- At Elliott's reunion he gets tired of hearing negative reactions to his still being a lifeguard so he opts for ambiguity, ""I work for the county."" Have you ever done that?

-- The film reflects the loose sexual morals of the pre-AIDS 70s era e.g. ""You're hot, let's have sex! And, no, I'm not interested in marriage."" Also, one woman is shown totally nude near the beginning. Despite this, it's NOT a T&A exploitation flick; the flimmakers were obviously simply shooting for realism. To support this, the beach scenes are filled with realistic-looking people, unlike Baywatch which exclusively showed incredibly bodacious babes walking the beach in the background. I've been to numerous southern Californian beaches on four separate vacations and know this isn't true.

-- Speaking of Baywatch, that tv series obviously used ""Lifeguard"" as a prototype. I've only seen a couple of whole episodes in my life so I'm not the right person to ascertain that show's quality, but I think it's pretty safe to say there's no comparison. In other words, don't allow a negative impression of Baywatch keep you away from ""Lifeguard.""

-- Elliot's friend (Stephen Young) encourages him to take a lucrative job selling Porsches. When he goes to the dealership for an interview you can tell he's almost ready to lose his cookies at the prospect of being a car salesman despite the better money. Have you ever experienced this? I have.

The film runs 96 minutes and was filmed on location on the beaches just south of L.A. (Torrance).

The score is 70s light pop, including Paul Williams ""Time and Tide."" It's not to my tastes but it fits the film.

FINAL ANALYSIS: ""Lifeguard"" is about numerous important topics that we can all relate to -- aging, career choices, (early) mid-life crisis, manhood, staying true to oneself, responsibility, love, sex, competition, consequences, and much more. Although it's generally a ""quiet film"" it smacks of reality and is full of insights. If you're in the mood for a great drama you can't go wrong. And, yes, this is Elliott's best role and performance IMHO.

I remember seeing ""Lifeguard"" as a kid on 70's cable and absolutely loved it. Not having seen it in almost 30 years, when it came out on DVD for the first time ten years ago I grabbed it right away, and found it to be even better than I remembered.

Despite the original ad campaign that makes ""Lifeguard"" look like a soft-core tease flick, it's really a serious (but fun) study of a guy in his 30's who is having a hard time giving up what is him essentially being a teenager. He loves the beach, loves his work (and the ""fringe benefits""), but as he gets older, he finds it difficult to move on.

He has not one, but two chances at finally living a ""mature"" adult life - when an old friend offers him a career selling cars, and when an old flame re-enters his life. What will he decide?

Sam Elliot is simply perfect as Rick, the studly lifeguard, who the girls love. Add on some other fantastic characters and it all makes for a very well-made and entertaining movie.

After 40 years, ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" looks like a relic from another era, and it's considered an all-time classic.  Yet 30 years after it's release, Daniel Petrie's minor 1976 film ""Lifeguard"" looks as good now as it did upon its release, and remains as timely and vital as ever, even though noone would consider it a classic of its era.

Actually, on the big screen, ""Lifeguard"" resembled a glorified TV movie.  On TV, however, it looks great, especially in this wonderful widescreen transfer.  And it serves as a reminder that sometimes small, heartfelt films with modest aspirations can endure and be effective long after the same era's pretentious and overblown message pictures.  ""Lifeguard"" could be described as ""Baywatch"" with brains, but its much more than that.  How wonderful it is to see a movie set in Southern California and on the beach where the beachgoers look like real people and not surgically-altered superbabes.  And although all of the featured lifeguards are men, you get the idea if they hired a woman, she'd look like Alexandra Paul and not Pamela Anderson.  Even the women star Sam Elliott gets involved with look like real, average women--future Oscar nominees Kathleen Quinlan and Anne Archer chief among them.  Believe me, it's a real treat to watch normal people onscreen for a change.

Elliott stars as Rick, a career lifeguard who is beginning another summer on the beach, with a new assistant/trainee (Parker Stevenson).  He befriends a lonely teenager (Quinlan) who has just moved to L.A. from San Diego (and who has an obvious crush on him), has a few one-night stands and meets his parents for dinner, whereas his father lets him know he's tired of his son wasting his life at the beach.  This sends him into an early mid-life crisis, especially when an old high school friend who owns a Porsche dealership offers him a ""respectable"" job selling cars.  But it's not until he attends his 15-year high school reunion and reunites with his divorced high school flame Cathy (Archer) that he begins to seriously consider hanging up his trunks for good, especially when Cathy lets him know her interest depends on it.  So, obviously, Rick has some serious thinking to do:  give up the job he loves for the respectability of a job he doesn't.  It's a simple story, but as most simple stories do, it resonates still.

""Lifeguard"" is a sweet, even funny movie that will obviously appeal to women, but is also a painless date film.  The entire cast is good, with Elliott the obvious standout.  Filmed before he matured into the grizzled, tough cop/cowboy/military type he now excels at, it's refreshing to see him play such a regular, flawed guy.  My only problem with his character is that he is so level-headed, a decision he makes involving his relationship with Quinlan's character seems completely out of character and even more stupid than it is.  Maybe it's because today's morality is so much different than it was then.  Either way, it's a jolt.  Also, Quinlan is typically wonderful, and Stevenson offers able support as the rookie and Rick's sounding board.  Archer, although second-billed, doesn't make her entrance until the second half of the film and then has barely ten minutes screen time.  She's professional as always.

The photography and look of the film still look great so many years later, with none of the swimwear or fashions seemingly out-of-date, compared to other eras.  And, yes, the song ""Time and Tide"" by Paul Williams, which was cut out of the TV prints, makes a welcome return, as so many others have noted.

In all, **** (out of *****) for ""Lifeguard"".  Unfortunately, this is a typical no-frills, no-extras presentation from Paramount DVD.  But at least they continue to present these old gems in widescreen, so thanks for that.",1120348800,50,3858,4.898305084745763
288180,5,6300216756,"With the approach of his fifteen year high school reunion and the possibilty of re-connecting with his teenage sweetheart (Anne Archer), an aging lifeguard (Sam Elliot) re-examines his career choice and single lifestyle.

This is my favorite Sam Elliot role and conversely probably his least well known. It's one of those perfect little gems where everything seems to work to perfection. Much like the main character, Lifeguard Rick, the viewer subtly touches on so many different emotions during this film that it's hard to define exactly what you're experiencing at any given time. But in the end you are left with a quiet contentment, an understanding and acceptance of who you are and what is the right choice for yourself no matter what the mainstream opinion might be.

Paul Williams' song ""Time and Tide"" was removed from the soundtrack when this movie hit the T.V. screen. I hope it has been restored on the DVD release, it just wouldn't be the same movie without it.

Update 06/22/05: The DVD came out yesterday. I bought it and watched last night. All is well, the song is back. Thanks Paramount!",1116547200,78,1106,4.872340425531915
288181,4,6300216756,"The original theme song for this movie is ""Time and Tide"" it was written and performed by Paul Williams and is available on one of his CD collections.

I believe that the theme song was changed in 1992 when the movie was re-released as a TV movie.

I don't know why they changed the song, I still remember some of the words and I haven't seen the movie since 1976!!!

What's that old saying????? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

Hope that helps,

Sam Elliott is great in this movie as are the supporting actors.  The beach scenes are fantastic and the ""to thine own self be true"" theme resonates long after the movie is over. I only wish the writers would have resolved Rick's relationship with his old high school flame.  But I guess we can all imagine our own view of the ending.

I had the pleasure of meeting Sam in person on many occasions when he would come into the office as well some of the other memebers of the movie.  I have the orginal script as well and even a charaters name was changed to mine!
I have seen this movie many times and besides the personal tone of it, I think it is so entertaining and the cast did a fantistic job.  We can all relate to this movie in some way, growing older, being young, family pressure and being in love.
I highly recommend Lifeguard to everyone!",1014163200,3,648,4.201612903225806
288186,5,6300216756,"If you consider yourself a movie fan then Lifeguard is a must see. Sam Elliot's performance as Lifeguard Rick Carlson is vintage Elliot. This performance, and his perfect performance in Mask as Garr, make Elliot one of the best actors in the past 30 years. It takes place on the beaches of LA so Elliot is tan and in the best physical shape of his career. Elliot battles the pressures of the working world, while juggling several women. It has the beach, a great love story, and of course Elliot. So if you even somewhat like movies Lifeguard is for you!",1008115200,10,554,4.4950495049504955
288187,4,6300216756,"The story goes that Daniel Petrie was having problems casting the lead  role in his new movie, ""Lifeguard."" His wife had recently seen  ""Frogs"" and she suggested that he take a look at a young actor in  that movie named Sam Elliott. Bless Mrs. Petrie! Sam Elliott is so right  for his role in ""Lifeguard"" that it's difficult to imagine the  movie without him. In fact, though he's done some good work since then,  nothing in Sam Elliott's career quite matches his performance here though,  unfortunately, the movie didn't attract much notice when it was released  back in 1975. Perhaps the audience which might have appreciated it was  discouraged by an ad campaign which made ""Lifeguard"" look a bit  like those ""Beach Blanket Bingo"" movies.
Actually,  ""Lifeguard"" is a thoughtful study of a man who's happy in a job  which others consider beneath him. At one point he's tempted to change his  life in order to conform to others' expectations, but by the end of the  movie he's decided to be his own man and to follow a course which satisfies  him. This philosophy has echoes of the ""do-your-own-thing"" mood  of the 1960's but it's presented here in a quieter, more mature form.",968198400,17,1178,4.729064039408867
