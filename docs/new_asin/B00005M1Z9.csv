1623920,5,B00005M1Z9,"This is MUCH better than OVA of vampire Miyu. When I watched OVA, I found the story very confusing. Throughout these TV series all of the questions you have will get answered. Like who is Larva, why he is serving Miyu... Miyu is very serious in the series, unlike in OVA (I though her laugh was rather annoying). Larva takes off his mask pretty often, so you can see how beautiful he really is ^-^ Miyu looks very pretty too! I am half way into series and I can't stop watching it, the plot is incredibly interesting!! The music is great. One of the best anime series!!",999129600,2,569,4.327102803738318
1623921,5,B00005M1Z9,I like it . It`s different then the OAV . For one thing Larva CAN TALK! but what I love most about itis the music . Love the music.,998956800,,131,3.5517241379310347
1623922,2,B00005M1Z9,"While the original 4-episode OAV is rated among my very favorite anime shows of all time, the follow-up television series will make it to no such list. The series tells the story of Miyu, battling a new Shinma each episode with the help of her trusty side-kicks. For the scope of this series, Miyu is in one geographical area, which detracts from the ""universal"" feel of the OAV. As with many follow-ups, liberties are taken with plot points and characters that were introduced in the OAV... but not one of them worked for me, not only trying to develop things in annoying directions but actively undoing some of the great ideas of the original. For instance, does Miyu really need a cute pink bunny-demon to sit on her shoulder? Overall, the series is much more formulaic than the OAV. While the darker tone was intriguing (Miyu shows again and again that she has little or no feeling for the majority of the innocents that are destroyed around her... usually one per episode), the antics became purely repetitive. Miyu rarely succeeds in doing anything to the demons she battles without Larva first blocking their attack and then slashing them a couple times. Also, unlike the OAV, most of the demons she battles are simply demons disguised as humans and preying on the week, rather than being a variety of supernatural forces that find interesting ways to use the human world to their advantage... and they almost all look stupid when their ""true form"" is revealed. The drawing style is a little different, and the pointy noses took some getting used to, but was possible to overcome. The overall animation is better than the OAV-- after all, it's newer. But it is used much less effectively. The series builds to a climax between characters that I cared nothing for. I give the series two stars, as I did bother to watch the whole thing, and there was no glaringly offensive content or significant continuity or narrative issues. But I never plan to buy the DVDs. Rabid fans of the original 4 episode OAV might want to check this out for research value, but most likely you'll end up disappointed as I was.",998784000,,2110,4.705405405405405
1623923,5,B00005M1Z9,"Alright Tokyopop for releasing the excellent TV Series Vampire Princess Miyu. It has 26 episodes in all and the are all very well animated (better than the OAV) and more of a shoujo anime than the OAV. It is les than a horror show and more of a magical girl show, consisting of Miyu's rival, a small bunny-like ally, and a three parter about where larva came from!! Of course, you'll have to wait until future volumes come out.
This volume has the first 3 episodes on it, the first one is about a big lizard and it isn't like all the other episodes. The 2nd episode really starts the plot line going: Miyu makes some friends in an all girls school and really gts to live life as a normal human.
You should buy this tape RIGHT AWAY if you even THINK you might like this show. It won't disappoint you!",996019200,,799,4.2631578947368425
1623924,5,B00005M1Z9,"The Vampire Princess Miyu TV series features Miyu and Larva from the OAV series, but with some differences.  At 26 episdoes, there is ample time for character development, providing an alternate background story for both Miyu and Larva.  Beginning with Episode 2, the location of action shifts from Kyoto to Tokyo, where Miyu befriends (rather, is befriended by) three classmates in an all-girl school, yet she must keep her true identity and purpose from her friends.  Also, Miyu's rival appears occasionally throughout the series, adding another element of intrigue.  Most episodes follow a ""shinma of the week"" format, each with different abilities and most also receiving great character development.
Those who enjoyed the Vampire Princess Miyu OAV series will absolutely LOVE the TV series!!!!!  While not necessarily as dark as the OAV series, the improved character development and additional character interactions are a great treat.  The music is superb, simultaneously haunting and enchanting. Overall, the entire TV series - and each individual episode - is anime at its best!!!",993772800,11,1089,5.414201183431953

7944833,1,B00005M1Z9,"I loathed this rendition of this beautiful series.  This is a waste of time and money, the art is lazy and sloppy, the characters are totally lost in the awful dialogue. I felt like I was watching a version of pokemon, the defeated character at the end of each episode...wtf ?! Did they make this series to just sell dolls and t shirts? It is awful!!!!  I bought all of them and could barely sit through these. Read the mangas and watch the original 4 episode OAV.  The original 4 episodes capture the truly macabre and enigmatic nature of this work without any frills. The story is just beautiful and this dvd set is just a waste of plastic.",1317081600,,642,4.378151260504202

7944835,4,B00005M1Z9,"Vampire Princess Miyu, vol. 1 ""Initiation"" starts a series that has many volumes and many episodes. If you have never seen the OVA, fine. If you have, you may or may not be disappointed. The OVA was pure horror at its finest. This series is mostly creepy and spooky, with a few moments of horror. It is a kind of Spooky Sailor Moon, except that Miyu and her supernatural friends are completely humorless. Larva, one of anime's most fascinating characters in the OVA, is still formidable, but his bishoujen (pretty boy) face is featured on many of the series' DVD covers as a romantic Tuxedo Mask character.

 ""Initiation"" has only three episodes. Later discs in the series have four or even five. But these three get the series off to a dark start, with great stories, lovely animation, and haunting music.

 Episode 1: The Fang Knows - Miyu enrolls in a high school. A male student suspects Miyu is more than an ordinary girl. He vows to get to the bottom of it, while having a weird crush on his teacher. This teacher is being blackmailed by vicious girls in her class. All this leads to a violent backlash.

 Episode 2: At the Next Station - One of the scariest in the series. Extremely chilling; harkens back to the OVA with it's pure horror.

 Episode 3: The Forest Calls - An African mask has a strange hold on a boy.

 Each DVD has an insert of great illustrated notes by the animator. Some of his Shinma are pretty out there - one is a combination of a horse and a piano. Again, reminds me so much of the Youma in Sailor Moon. But he stresses in the notes he has wanted to remain true to and emphasize Japanese culture, which he does beautifully sometimes.",1090972800,,1664,4.444078947368421
7944836,4,B00005M1Z9,"After getting hooked with ""Cowboy Bebop"" and the movie ""Spirited Away"" (gifts from my beloved ^_^) I began my own venture into anime, deciding first to check out Vampire Princess Miyu as it sounded very interesting. I did, however, start with vol.'s 1 & 2 of the OAV's which I recommend before watching these as it will answers many questions some might have, like how did Miyu become the guardian and why is Larva's devotion to protect her unwavering?
Here is a summary of the three episodes found on vol. 1 - Initiation:
On ""The Fang Knows"" several young girls keep appearing dead. Machiyama, a young man from their school stumbles upon one of them lying in the street, drained of all her blood with two puncture wounds found on her neck. He suspects it's the work of a vampire, and he believes that that vampire is Miyu. He saw her walking away from the site, mysteriously vanishing into a cloud of mist. Suddenly she's a new classmate and so he follows her around (or tries to, anyway), determined to prove that his speculations aren't just his imagination. In the meantime a teacher is being harassed by some of her students who witnessed her doing something regrettable...something they won't seem to ever let her forget...
""At the Next Station"" is my favorite of the three. Miyu has made some friends from the school she now attends and is fitting in well, but as she tries to act normal she must also deal with a shinma (stray demon) who is behind the disappearances of many beautiful women - all of whom were last seen riding on the last car of a train (can't really say much about this one without giving everything away).
On ""The Forest Calls"" a young man is plagued with nightmares and his behavior becomes abnormally strange after his father receives an odd looking mask from Africa that a witch doctor might have worn in the past to cast spells. Larva, however, has come face to face with the mask once before yet he does not understand its magical powers. He was unable to defeat it then, obviously, but it's slowly taking over Kouichi's life and Miyu must put a stop to the shinma's evil reign before it destroys anyone else.
The TV series for Vampire Princess Miyu is a good anime, and the music by Kawai Kenji is gorgeous and haunting, but it does not live up to the amazing OAV's. I prefer whoever did the voice and drawings for Miyu on the OAV's better for they put more emotion into her voice and expressions. Here she almost seems lifeless... Also, what ever happened to spiritualist Himiko? I haven't watched every episode yet but she hasn't been mentioned, nor seen, once. As for the fluffy, recurring character of Shiina, well I'm not too crazy about that particular addition but luckily she doesn't show up much. It's a ""good"" shinma that has the ability to sense things just before they're about to happen and can see far into the distance with its red, bloodshot eye when it's no longer being covered with its long white ear (kind of resembles a bunny). Overall, though, if you enjoyed the wonderful OAV's then I'd continue with this but expect to be a little disappointed. It's not as good but it certainly has its moments.",1085270400,2,3152,4.600355239786857
7944837,2,B00005M1Z9,"I was looking forward to this, because some japanimation is very good. But that seems to be mostly movies, I have not see any TV shows yet that I found I truly liked.
And this is no exception. Beyond the titilatin of vampires and school uniforms, it really does not have much. Boring drawings, not very original concepts, and trivial story.",1072569600,,340,4.590163934426229
7944838,4,B00005M1Z9,"For those who have never seen the original OVA series, Miyu is a vampire whose task it is to hunt down creatures of evil called Shinma and return them to the dark world of their origin.  She is accompanied by Lava, a Shinma who has left the evil ways of his kind behind and serves Miyu unquestioningly.  The series was noted for its artistic and atmospheric qualities and had a strong effect on the many vampire anime that followed it.
The Fang Knows
When Matchiyama, a young high school student comes upon Miyu while she is investigating a murder he decides that she is the vampire behind the murderers.  But the truth is more complex than the boy suspects and will reveal a tragic element behind the deaths.  Sometimes things are even worse than they seem.
At the Next Station
Miyu transfers to a new high school and finds herself making friends with several fellow students. Especially Chisato Inoue, who takes an unexpected liking to the normally distant vampire.  Miyu discovers that the neighborhood has been plagued the disappearances of a series of beautiful women, all associated with the subway.  Miyu confronts the Shinma, but there is little help for the lost souls of its victims.
The Forest Calls
When an African mask has strange effects on the brother of on of Miyu's friends the vampire investigates and discovers that Lava remembers a past encounter with the Shinma behind the mask.  But this spirit is not entirely evil, just deeply angry about the ruining of the forests of its homeland.
This new, made-for-TV series has been updated considerable form the original OVA.  Among the casualties of the change is the Art Nouveau flavor of the first series.  But this isn't a real loss, as the updated work is still just as compelling, but in a different way.  Lava has been tinkered with as well, sometimes appearing without a mask.  Miyu also has an additional companion, a lesser Shinma called Shiina.  The story retains much of its atmospherics and dark plot and should be considered a success.",1039392000,4,2012,4.783236994219653
7944839,4,B00005M1Z9,"This Vampire Princess Miyu Volume showed me how much different the television show was from the OAV. Both were equally good, but they had apparent differences. The original OAV's style was more the type I depict to be a fitting style for this anime, that style being mystical, dark, and intensity through subtle-ness. My only problem was the clothing(eigties' style). The television series is more lighthearted, and with obvious shoujo qualities. In my opinion, the television series advanced in some ways, such as music, costumes, and characters, but left behind the original subtle intensity thatt made the OAV so great. This is a great buy if you're interested in the shoujo-ish anime things (emotions), and interested in vampires and demons of the sort.",1022716800,4,757,5.162601626016261
7944840,3,B00005M1Z9,"I am an avid fan of Miyu, and Kakinouchi Narumi's artwork and stories in general.  When I first heard TOKYOPOP was bring over the series, I was very excited.  I had already seen an episode aired while vacationing in Japan, and had also seen it taped from TV.  I was aware of the quality of the show and had high expectations for a company that has roots in catering to hard-core fans.  While I also much prefer the OVA story to the TV, I personally do not have as much difficulty with the difference between the two, since these differences more closely track the new manga.  My issues are more with the quality of the  DVD than the show.  I have certainly seen better transfers in picture quality, but this was not bad and did not bother me as much as the fact that the opening and closing were cut between episodes.  This might have been marginally acceptable if they had been trying to pack in 7 episodes, but I see no excuse for it here.  Also, I found it very annoying that I can only jump to the beginning of an episode and not to the mid point.  I also did not expect TOKYOPOP to alter the images; for example, where kanji are removed and replaced with english text.  If the viewer is not willing to read subtitled kanji this is not the show for him/her since stylized kanji is integral to the artwork.  I understand that this is the earliest work for them, but I was very disappointed and determined not to purchase another DVD in the series.  However, rumor has it that the second attempt has corrected some of these problems, so I will probably give them one more chance.  I give the story **** and the DVD *.",1008288000,,1619,4.317880794701987
7944841,5,B00005M1Z9,"I for one was very happy to see more Miyu beyond AnimEigo's OVA releases. I found the pace of the TV episodes a little faster than the OVAs, not really developing who each Shinma was. You get bits and pieces, then Miyu banishes them to The Dark and it is all over. But all in all it is a good buy.
One thing I found kind of annoying is that it seems none of the TokyoPop staff seemed to have read AnimEigo's liner notes for the OEM to see that AnimEigo had contacted the author, Ms. Kakinouchi, to get the correct romanizations of character names such as Larva (*NOT* Lava) and Lemures (which is actually Latin to begin with). It really doesn ot bother me since I refuse to use the Engish audio track anyways, but it does kind of mar the production.",1004054400,,749,4.244755244755245
