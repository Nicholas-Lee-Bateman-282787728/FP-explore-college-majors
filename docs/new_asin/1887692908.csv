7800912,5,1887692908,"Here is Greenwood/Koko wa Greenwood, a 6-episode OVA series based on an 11 volume manga by Yukie Nasu, is one of the funniest series you will ever come across. The only complaints you can have with it is that it is far TOO SHORT.
The story centers on Kazuya Hasukawa (""Suka-chan"" to his friends), who is arriving at an all-boys boarding school a month late because he was hospitalized for ulcers (caused by the trauma of his older brother marrying the girl he was in love with). Upon his arrival, he discovers that he will be living in the dorm called ""Greenwood"" by its rather eccentric inhabitants (because it's real name, Ryokurin Ryou, is too hard to pronounce), all of whom have reputations as the school weirdos.
From the religious cult leader to the guy who lives with his motorcycle to the guys who run a very profitable arcade in their room, everyone seems a bit strange to poor Hasukawa.. until he finds out that he'll be rooming with the weirdest one of all, Kisaragi Shun, a girl in hiding (one of the funniest points in the series). Constantly teased and threatened by Mitsuru and Shinobu (the conniving roommates next door), poor Hasukawa is fighting a losing battle to retain what little hope of sanity he has left..
This series only gets better as it progresses and viewers are introduced to such memorable characters as Shinobu's psychotic older sister, Hasukawa's school nurse brother, and Shun's confusing family. The final two episodes bring a more serious note to the series with the story of Hasukawa falling in love with a girl who wants nothing to do with him, but there's plenty of humor for everyone to enjoy in this series. Do yourself a favor and pick up this anime as fast as you can. ^_- (...)",1006387200,3,1723,4.6524590163934425
7800913,5,1887692908,"Aw, I love this series, it's so funny, and crazy! This poor kid, Kazuya Hasukawa, falls in love with this girl named Sumire. Before he confesses his love, though, she marries his big brother.  He decides to run away and go to Ryokuto Academy. But then, a train delayed due to weather got his application in late, he's nearly run over on the way to orientation, and misses the first month of the semester because an ulcer sends him to the ER.  He finally gets in and is put in the dormatory Ryokurin Hall, or Greenwood, and it's full of weirdos. First, his roomate, Shun, looks, talks, and acts like a girl (except when standing at a urinal. What are you gonna do?). The guys in the next room can't stop teasing him either. There's also the creepy guy who belongs to a religious cult and holds sermons in his room. Then there's Forusawa who lives with his gigantic motorcycle that he carries on his soldier. Some may find the guys who turned their room into a video game arcade strange, though they make a lot of money. But Kazuya seems to do okay anyway.  Of course, he may have trouble with the fact that the infirmary doctor is his double-crossing brother.
 In the 2nd episode, Kazuya, Shun, and the guys next door, Mitsuru and Shinobu, have to deal with Shinobu's whack sister, who kidnaps Shun's little pink-haired, high-voiced brother Rayna.  Shinobu can't help but tease her. He dissapears from her view, sends Mitsuru out to grab Rayna, and somehow, Shun and Kazuya get mixed up in the mess, lending a hand to the fight.  The final confrontation involves Shinobu and his sister in a gunfight(?)
