174585,5,0983789282,Sophia Yin is a good writer who conveys learning in a simple way with gentle methods. You see results quickly which means that you will continue with the training.,1402617600,,163,4.655172413793103
174586,3,0983789282,We liked the advice contained in this video but expected much better quality for $29.95. It is just a camera set up at the back of a lecture hall with Dr. Yin at the podium and a power point presentation on the screen. People get up and their heads are in the way. You can't hear the audiences questions and Dr. Yin's microphone cuts out a few times. Besides one short (less than 5min) clip that looks more professionally filmed there is no video editing. They have literally filmed video being displayed on a screen at the lecture hall instead of editing the dvd to contain the clip directly.,1402099200,3,593,4.4495412844036695
174587,3,0983789282,"Dr. Yin has some good tips & techniques to offer, but I found some of her remarks about her dad, who is 80, being too slow a bit age-ist, to say the least. Basically, if you're young, fit, & coordinated, her techniques will work great. Otherwise, you'll pr'ly have to modify what you learn here to suit.",1401667200,3,303,4.333333333333333
174588,4,0983789282,"I've never yet had a dog that's been trained properly, despite lots of hours in obedience classes.  Watching this DVD helped me understand what I've been doing wrong and how I can do better.  Dr. Yin really understands the dog mentality and what it takes to get a dog to do what you want.  Many of the things I had been taught about dog training were totally wrong.  You don't need to boss the dog, jerk the dog around on a choke collar, or any of the other rather unfriendly things that trainers tell you to do.  You just need to learn how to lead your dog to do what you want, rewarding him when he succeeds. Your key strategy is to make it easy and rewarding for the dog to do the right thing.  Dr. Yin has great insights about how you can accomplish this, and if you're like me you'll feel that all the trainers you've used in the past should buy the video too.

My only issue with the DVD is that it's not professionally made.  You are not watching a slick, cohesive, prepared training class.  Rather, for most of the DVD, you are watching Dr. Yin teach a training class in a classroom.  You see the backs of students' heads, and you get the tinny sound quality of the amateur video while you watch videos of her training dogs on the classroom movie screen.  You also get a lot of extraneous material that would have been cut out in a professionally made DVD.  My computer lost power while I was watching this DVD, and when I booted it back up, I found that instead of the usual selection of multiple scenes that allows you to get back in approximately where you left off, this one only offers two scenes--the first class (about 3/4 of the video) or the second class.  There is quite a bit of repetition in the video as well, although since it is the owner who needs this training, this may be desirable to an extent.  You do get to see Dr. Yin train a dog for her own parents, so you see how the dog is doing over time, which is more realistic than a ""canned"" video.

Overall, though, I would prefer the content to be more condensed with less repetition and better video quality.  Even so, I would still recommend this product for the highly valuable information in it.  I feel I have finally seen a dog training strategy that will actually work.  I will caution you, though, that this method will take a LOT of time spent training your dog, and you have to learn to be consistent--i.e., you'll essentially be in training mode all the time, even when you're not actively training, because you can't allow your dog to start learning the behaviors you don't want him to demonstrate.  I think you'll be pleased with what you learn from the DVD, and I have to admit that the ability to train a dog right makes this DVD worth the price.  You'll be spending your dog's lifetime with him, and for the price of this DVD, you can both have a good life or a difficult one.  I choose the good life.",1401062400,15,2893,4.300738007380073
174589,5,0983789282,"I attended this lecture and then purchased the DVD later.  She really gives fantastic advice and demonstrates how to train your puppy in a easy and safe manner that your puppy will understand.  I appreciate her insight and have found that the techniques really work!!!  I especially love the ""leave It"" command.  I would recommend that anyone buying this DVD watch it SEVERAL times before working with their dog.  I have recommended this DVD to several clients.",1393200000,6,461,4.935064935064935
174590,5,0983789282,"I love this DVD! The book is excellent but I find many people need a visual to be able to perform the exercised to train their dog.  The potty training lessons have worked every time for every clients dog and my own, (yes I took in a 2 year old, chained all his life in a yard, Boer Boel, let me tell you when a two year old 120 lb dog pees on your rug yet he has been accident free for over 8 months!  If I ever breed another litter every puppy will go home with this DVD. I now do a lot of rescue and administrate a County Rescue and rehome page and offer free training advice, I repeatedly post links to Sophia's website and this DVD. I love that this DVD offers so much info for not only puppies but new adult dogs coming into your home. If you want to adopt a puppy or older dog this is the information you need to have a happy life with your new family member!",1391212800,10,866,3.914772727272727

7795227,4,0983789282,"The DVD is a taping of a lecture that was given, so the images and audio is a bit muffled. A very good basic intro to training a puppy and well worth it for a family to watch together to all be on the same page.",1480636800,,211,3.608695652173913

7795230,3,0983789282,"Loved these concepts but 2 very important caveats:  1. Our pup had to have I.V. fluids because he was not drinking enough to go with all those dry food rewards, + 2. He doesn't appear to have grown enough, even though we were measuring out + using the prescribed amount each day.  Also, through his shih tzu stubbornness + our apparent inaccuracy in doing this approach, he now won't do what he has learned unless there is a kibble involved. Has been helpful, so we recommend it; just make sure the water is always nearby + use moistened kibbles for rewards.  As others have said, this is a novice video  of a conference lecture, yet it holds a lot for visual + auditory learners.  Nothing different from the book if you understood that.",1460332800,,737,4.511278195488722
