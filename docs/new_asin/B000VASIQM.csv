8217880,5,B000VASIQM,"This was a great documentary and mini drama on the history of one of the most haunting and spectacular forts in the world--that of Old Fort Niagara. We saw this in the new Visitor's Center nearby and I remember the computer generated images of the fort's buildings over time--from a small garrison post to the point where the walls contained an entire town complex within. I hope to get a copy up there, or here whichever comes first. (The French Castle seen on the cover is the oldest building built by white men in this part of the continent--built in about 1680--and shortly after Niagara Falls, a few miles away, was confirmed to exist by early French explorers there.) Visit it sometime too and other historic sites on both sides of the American-Canadian border, as this place will make you understand fully what it was like in the days when two great colonial empires, Great Britain, France, and the Fist Nations Iroquois/associated tribes made the Niagara region and the nearly the whole of North America among the primary theaters of the world-wide 7 Years War. Later, it was fought over during the War of 1812, between Americans and the British, as Britain/Canada tried to re-claim dominance in the region at the time. Today, the fort holds one of the largest and oldest American fort battle flags, along with other unique artifacts from the last four centuries, and it's all on display there. The reenactments are well-portrayed in the film as well, and many of these actors are employed at the fort by the New York State Parks Dept.",1340150400,,1543,4.7611940298507465
