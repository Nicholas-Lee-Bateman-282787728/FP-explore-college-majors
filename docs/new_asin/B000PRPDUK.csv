8193006,5,B000PRPDUK,"Lots of good ideas.  All the scares here are easy to build with common household items that you probably already own.  The impact, when properly lit, is well worth the effort, giving you a lot of bang for your buck.

My only concern is with their recipe for ""edible"" blood.  They thicken the mixture with red toothpaste however, toothpaste is NOT edible.  If you read toothpaste labels they will tell you to get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away if you accidentally swallow more than what is normally used for tooth brushing.  The DVD makes no mention of this warning.  You might want to check out kid's toothpaste (which takes into account that kids tend to swallow their paste when they are learning to brush) or try to thicken the mixture with something else, like cornstarch, tapioca or geletin.

But other than that, the DVD offers lots of scares for the home haunter.  My favorites were the ones involving lighting (creating fake lightning using a couple of strobe lights) and using TV's to project ghostly images.  In my opinion just those 2 tips alone were worth the price of the DVD.",1351123200,,1117,4.682051282051282
8193007,5,B000PRPDUK,"I have been haunting houses for a few years now and because I have a small video production company I've recently been thinking about putting together my own How-to Haunt DVD.  So in preparation I've been reading a few of the books out there and buying some of the other DVD's like this one so that I know my competition and don't inadvertently put out something too similar.

From what I have seen I have to say so far for the money I like this one the most, produced by the same guys who make the BIG Scream TV DVD's you can get at EVERY Halloween store it is well put together, funny interesting and entertaining.  They do plug their other products a little but not too much and clocking in at just under an hour and covering over a dozen projects it is well worth the money.

Now, while it does cover some easier projects that most people could just figure out with little to no effort (Like buying thrift store clothes to make a dummy) it also looks at some more complex aspects of higher end haunted houses like creating more realistic lightning, video illusions and creating air effects.  Whilst I would have liked to have seen more (I always want more) this DVD definitely delivers and is recommended.  (Until mine comes out anyway ;p)",1310947200,6,1243,4.453744493392071
