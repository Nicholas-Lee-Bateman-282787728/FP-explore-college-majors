My ""only"" complaint is thaw lack of John Bush material, I personally would have loved to hear ""only"", ""inside out"" even ""fueled"" or ""hy pro glo"" with Joey on this DVD , don't see why returning singers can't do their predecessors stuff!",1411257600,,276,4.431372549019608
6486313,4,B00LGQVDEY,"I don't have words to describe how I feel right now you guys are the best audience weve ever played to! Thank you so much! says guitarist Scott Ian  completely in awe  at the end of the new Anthrax DVD and Blu-Ray, Chile On Hell. Rewind to an hour and 45 minutes ago, when this disc  filmed May 10, 2013 at the sold out Teatro Caupolican in Santiago, Chile  was popped into the home player with cold beer and fresh popcorn at the ready. In the very first song, Among The Living, an audience member lights a roadside flare and proceeds to lead an absolutely huge circle pit. During Indians more flares are lit! How are such items smuggled into the venue? Even more perplexing is the fact that concert security does absolutely nothing to curb these potentially dangerous activities. But those in attendance don't seem to mind; in fact they are super enthusiastic and overflowing with energy. Although Chile On Hell doesnt feature the lavish production values of an Iron Maiden DVD, it sure as Satan gets the point across that its a Madhouse. In fact, so mad that the cameramen are actually on stage with the band, at times only inches away. As if to prove the point that the lens is too close for comfort, during the cover of AC/DCs T.N.T., vocalist Joey Belladonna actually grabs one of the video crews cameras and starts filming while singing  too funny. For In The End, Anthrax borrows a page from the Black Label Society playbook by draping their amps with flags featuring the images of Ronnie James Dio and Dimebag Darrell  the tune is written about and dedicated to both late, great metal stalwarts. Occasionally interspersed between songs is welcome off-stage footage including shots of Anthrax artwork utilized by the band over their 30 year career, very brief interview clips with Mike Portnoy, David Ellefson, and Zakk Wylde, as well as assorted random footage. Breaking into Slayers Raining Blood as tribute to Jeff Hanneman (R.I.P.) is super classy and incredibly well received. Personal favourites that made the extensive set list include: Caught In A Mosh, Fight Em Til You Cant, and Antisocial. Be sure to stick around after the credits for a cool little feature entitled Randoms & Righteous Scheduling.",1411171200,3,2216,4.803149606299213
6486314,4,B00LGQVDEY,"I love Anthrax and I REALLY want to give this video a 5 star, but it just ain't there for me. The song selection here is good, but why not include: Be All, End All, Who Cares Wins, AIR, Time, Keep it in the Family, or Belly of the Beast? I did like the inclusion of March of the SOD and In My World, though. Their new lead guitarist is kind of sleepy on stage until he spins his hair, where as the rest of the band are going nuts. The lighting on the stage often washes out the band in the wide shots. There is a bit too much camera switching for my taste, although the camera at the end of the guitar is cool, they need to stay on one shot a bit longer instead of flashing everything by so quick. As a Blu-Ray, I would have liked a few more extras, interviews, etc. The crowd has some killer circle pit moments. You could never get away with that flare in the US!

It seems to me the audio mix is really the live show, and does not contain overdubs ... I say this because Joey sometimes signs a bit off tune (who can blame him after a two hour high energy show like this!) and his vocal is very raw sounding, but overall he puts in a commanding performance. I think I would rather have the reality presented here. Joey is a great front man. Charlie is such a monster on drums ... and I like the little mini-drum solo near the end - I just want more more more ... Overall, this video is very representative of their latest tour which I have seen thrice. You can always depend on Scottie and Frankie to perform their butts off. The high energy of Scottie and Frankie and Joey show that they really earn their pay. The music is tight overall, and shows what a professional group Anthrax is.
All in all, if you are an Anthrax fan, this is a must have, but if you are considering purchasing your first Anthrax video, I like the Chicago reunion show a bit better (Alive 2 the DVD).",1410998400,3,1876,4.0978260869565215
6486315,5,B00LGQVDEY,"The quality of this live performance is amazing.  Mixed by Producer Jay Ruston, the sound quality is superb.  You can hear Frankie's Bass bounce off Charlie's Bass drum in one of the tightest Rhythm sections in the history of heavy music.  If you don't buy this, and a copy for your friend, you're a fool.",1410912000,11,305,4.509090909090909
6486316,4,B00LGQVDEY,"If you're an Anthrax fan, there's no reason to not own this. I bought the Blu-ray version so I'll be getting into the specifics of that. Plenty of people here have touched on the setlist so if you want to read about that, keep scrolling.

Sound quality/Performance- 4/5
The mix is loud, powerful and it makes you feel like you were in the crowd in Chile. The drums sound beautiful, being able to hear every single tom and cymbal hit. The performances are good, with some lags here and there. The drums speed up and slow down, particularly in Caught in a Mosh and Indians but that's just me nitpicking. The solos are pretty much on point, the bass tone is some of the best sounding bass tones I have ever heard. In so many of these live concerts the bass can barely be heard, or felt. Vocals are a mixed bag, kind of understood as these are hard songs to sing for 2 hours.

Video quality- 4/5
I dug what they did here, though I would've liked to see more Pit shots. There is also one camera angle that looks way less hi-res than the rest. It also bounces around a lot, which can make the whole presentation feel disjointed.

Extras- 3/5
Not much here, in between songs there are mini-documentaries shot in NY with appearances from Mike Portnoy and Dave Ellefson. Some behind-the-scenes footage here and there but nothing to get excited about.

Overall, this being the first Anthrax Blu-ray, it's a good grab. It focuses solely on the performance and it works here.",1410912000,6,1463,4.488721804511278
6486317,5,B00LGQVDEY,"What a great show these guys put on. Tons of energy from the band, you'd think it was 1994 not 2014. A few of the tracks I felt could have been changed to make a better setlist however. I think they could have dropped ""Antisocial"" and ended with Gung-Ho for instance, but this is a minor complaint. Audio is great, picture kinda looks a little grainy at times but still very nice. Overall a pretty awesome live show from the boys.",1410825600,3,430,4.320987654320987
6486318,5,B00LGQVDEY,"If you want to see an amazing event, get Anthrax's ""Chile on Hell"" DVD.  The band and the crowd work together to produce a true spectacle that's so emotionally charged, you can't help but get caught up in the moment.  I know if I had a metal band, I'd want to play concerts in Chile.  The crowds there go so apecrap insane, it's really incredible to watch.

The set list for this show is great if you love old Anthrax.  Among the Living, usually considered their best album, is well-represented with six songs.  They actually play five of them to start the show.  One of the highlights for me is when the crowd sings the whole pre-chorus and chorus of N.F.L. before the song starts when Joey prompts them with the first line.  These fans know their Anthrax!  They play tracks from all of Joey's studio albums, plus ""I'm the Man"" and ""T.N.T."" from two of their EP's.  There's also a short but cool jam of S.O.D.'s ""March of the S.O.D.,"" which Scott and Charlie co-wrote.  No, you won't find any songs from the John Bush era, but if Joey's stuff is your cup of tea, you'll love ""Chile on Hell.""

I often see people gripe about Anthrax's many cover songs, but the crowd loves them.  One of the most enthusiastic responses of the night comes on ""T.N.T."", which energizes the crowd like an electric charge.  Later, the band only plays about thirty seconds of ""Reign in Blood,"" but it gets one of the biggest pits of the night (which you can't really see on the DVD, but there's good Youtube footage of it).  And before they're even ready to play it, the crowd starts chanting for ""Antisocial,"" a song I always see people complain about.  It brings down the house when they finally play it to close the show. When you have songs that get the crowd going that much, you can't leave them out of the set.  I doubt anyone who attended this concert walked out complaining about the covers.

If there's any complaint here, it's the usual with live DVD's.  Yes, it's over-edited, yes it has too many quick cuts, yes it has sometimes annoying split-screens.  Over the years, I've learned to block out these distractions and enjoy the show, but I can understand how a lot of people can't.  Most shots don't hold for more than 2-4 seconds, but I have seen worse.  What matters to me here is that the band plays a phenomenal set.  They're one of the most hyperactive live bands you'll see, so they're always fun to watch.  The new guitarist, Jon Donais, does a fine job, but I swear, he seems almost tired compared to the energy of Joey, Frankie, Scott, and Charlie.  Those four guys have always been full-on, non-stop energy from the beginning to the end of their shows.  Bottom line is, if you like Anthrax with Joey, this is must-have material.",1410739200,9,2730,4.486815415821501
6486319,5,B00LGQVDEY,"For Anthrax fans this live-in-concert DVD will be a must! The band covers all the bases from classic numbers like ""Among The Living"", ""Caught In A Mosh"", ""Indians"", ""Medusa"" and ""Madhouse"" while playing some choice cover tracks like ""March Of The S.O.D."" and ""T.N.T."". Along the way there are plenty of background clips of Anthrax which were compiled from a variety of sources. Having seen the band less then a year before the recording of this show I an honest say that the band sounds as good here on this DVD as they do in living color. Simply put this is a great release from a great band and one thrash act that seems to have gotten back on track after a few ""bumps"".",1409270400,,672,4.42741935483871
6486320,5,B00LGQVDEY,"Filmed in Santiago de Chile, South American during their years-long Worship Music Tour, this DVD is the cap to the powerful trilogy of Anthrax's Worship Music album cycle.  Being their most successful album in 20 years, not since Wound of White Noise had Anthrax reach the critical and commercial acclaim that Worship Music brought back to them. Following up their album with the fantastic EP of covers, Anthems, and now this DVD completes the three-part collection of Anthrax's best era in two decades.
One must wonder what about Chile makes Anthrax follow none other than Iron Maiden's En Vivo (Their most recent live album, from 2012) in selecting that country to records their newest live venture.
Promoting the release, this is what band members have said about the decision to film it there.  ""Santiago was the perfect place to film the show for this,"" said ANTHRAX drummer Charlie Benante. ""When we'd played there in the past, we'd finish our set, play our encore and go back to the dressing room. But every time, the fans would continue to scream and cheer and clap. I mean, they went on and on, they wouldn't stop. One time Scott [Ian, guitar] and I walked out to the side of the stage just to watch what was going on in the audience, it was intense. Why wouldn't we want to film a DVD in front of an audience like that?

Considering the excitement by audiences and band members alike in capturing the magic with Joey Belladona, this is probably the definitive Anthrax live recording, following Alive 2 and Music of Mass Destruction in the chronology of live releases.

The setlist was as follows:
01. Among The Living
02. Caught In A Mosh
03. I Am The Law
04. Efilnikufesin (N.F.L.)
05. A Skeleton In The Closet
06. March Of The S.O.D. (S.O.D. [a one-off supergroup featuring members of Anthrax] cover)
07. In The End
08. Deathrider
09. T.N.T. (AC/DC cover)
10. I'm Alive
11. Indians
12. Medusa
13. In My World
14. Got The Time (Joe Jackson cover, originally recorded by Anthrax for their Persistence of Time album)
15. Fight 'Em 'Til You Can't
Encore:
16. I'm The Man / Raining Blood (SLAYER cover)
17. Madhouse
18. Antisocial (TRUST cover, originally recorded by Anthrax for their State of Euphoria album)

SHADOWS FALL guitarist Jon Donais, who has been touring with ANTHRAX since Rob Caggiano's departure in January 2013, handled the lead-guitar parts at the Santiago show.",1408233600,12,2387,4.783980582524272

My self not a big fan of worship music cd it's self I actually purchased the import version from e bay a longer 22 track dvd ( many extra video/footage to speak of (chile on hell documentary,30 years of anthrax,metal masters, the scene  and more) march of the S.O.D.'s and 2 cd set to match for about the same price more for your money! back to the dvd they have put more old school tunes in the mix(nfl,sketetons,medusa,in my world, madhouse, among the living and a excellent cover of AC/DC's TNT! sadly nothing from fist full of metal, state of euphoria and sound of white noise and even thou I love among the living there is much more of that cd than all other songs?this is much better than more resent set lists still a bit off.
a band with this kind of length in the career I want to here some of all of it example ( metal thrashing mad, air or armed and dangerous, anything but caught in the mosh, Indians and I'm the law from among the living-among and nfl are great but maybe Imitation Of Life? euphoria is not a favorite of most fans I like it be all, end all or now it's dark or even out of sight out of mind but antisocial is getting old, time gridlock, or discharge, anything from sound of white noise, fueled, what doesn't die or home safe and a few new tracks from worship music would be good too.",1429747200,,1367,4.257692307692308
