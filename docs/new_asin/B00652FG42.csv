4960374,5,B00652FG42,"""Safe In Hell""

Even for fans of pre-Code Hollywood films, 1931's ""Safe In Hell"" may prove surprisingly scandalous and raw. It's the story of Gilda Carlson, a troubled young woman who flees the long arm of the law and winds up on a lawless, remote island populated with desperate, ragged fugitives. In the first five minutes of the film, we are introduced to her character (played by the gorgeous, expressive Dorothy Mackaill, a veteran of the silent film era) who is working as a call girl in New Orleans -- her madame sends her to meet a john who turns out to be a creep she knows and loathes, and as she rejects his advances, a fire breaks out, the hotel burns down, and she is accused of murder and branded as an outlaw.  And that's just the first five minutes. Gilda's tough, world-weary character is matched by the equally rough, cynical residents of the unnamed isle she flees to, and the whole film basks in an unrepentant seediness that may shock modern viewers used to more genteel 1930's fare.

Mackaill owns the film with a performance that is both subtle and tempestuous -- director William A. Wellman gives the movie an unusual texture, both in its amoral tone and in some of the artier camera work, including the sun-haloed closing scene, and a delightful sequence where two characters hold a long dialog from inside a large shipping crate -- we can only see their mouths talking through a large crack -- and it is a marvelously odd touch which is typical of the unusual feel of this film. If you like pre-Code films, this one is a must-see. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1370304000,6,1595,4.589473684210526
4960375,2,B00652FG42,"Safe in Hell (William A. Wellman, 1931)

William Wellman was notorious for loving the ladies off camera and hating them on. He was also notorious for bullying actors of both sexes until they simply gave up and did what he wanted in the way he wanted it when he wanted, no matter how incomparably wrong he may have been. You can see how low these twin afflictions could make Wellman sink in Safe in Hell, today one of Wellman's most obscure releases. There's a good reason for that.

Gilda (The Office Wife's Dorothy Mackaill, whose career pretty much ended with the enforcement of the Hays Code) is a prostitute in New Orelans. She kills an ex-boyfriend in self-defense, but who's going to take her word for that? So she enlists the help of another old friend, Carl (The Public Enemy's Donald Cook), who whisks her out of the country and sets her up in a seedy hotel on a Caribbean island. She's safe from the American law there, but immediately becomes the enamored of every guy there, from the corrupt police chief (Murder, My Sweet's Ralf Harolde) to the local drunks. Having promised fidelity to Carl, who's posing as her husband, she tries to remain chaste and sober while he's away at sea, but it's awfully tempting to go back to her old self...

When you had an actress who was capable of standing up to Wellman, like Barbara Stanwyck in Night Nurse or Ruth Chatterton in Frisco Jenny, that particular synthesis made for a solid, strong heroine equally capable of charming the teeth off anyone else in the film and eating nails. Mackaill, on the other hand, is something of a shrinking violet--or was when dealing with Wellman--and what we end up with is a doormat, and not a very interesting one, either, who's willing to do whatever's necessary to keep her man safe. But it's not just that she's playing the doormat, it's that everyone else around town is perfectly okay with her playing the doormat; if she's going to be nothing more than a sex object, well okay, let's treat her like one! (There's one marginally infamous scene where Mackaill is ascending the hotel staircase and the town drunks are trying to see up her dress that is, in fact, synecdochic of every male in the film's attitude towards her the entire time.)

To say this is not Wellman's finest work would be something of an understatement. I can't make a claim to having seen anywhere near all of Wellman's eighty big-screen features, but of those I've seen, this is easily the worst. Unless you're a Wellman completist, you can ignore this one entirely. **",1358726400,,2535,4.651785714285714
4960376,4,B00652FG42,"Audiences who haven't been exposed to early talkies made before the imposition of the Production Code in 1934 will be shocked by director William (""Wild Bill"") Wellman's ""Safe in Hell"".  This 1931 Warner Brothers melodrama is seamy, sordid, degenerate, immoral, tawdry ... and altogether fascinating!

Silent screen beauty Dorothy Mackaill, whose career would inexplicably fade with the coming of sound, stars as Gilda Carlson, a fallen woman living in New Orleans who must escape the law when it appears that she has killed the man responsible for her descent into prostitution.  Her sailor boyfriend (Donald Cook) smuggles her to the island of Tortuga where she'll be ""safe"" until he can come back and marry her.  But it soon becomes clear that Gilda has found refuge in a living hell populated by a legion of lecherous scum (including Gustav von Seyffertitz in a particularly repulsive characterization), and has, in fact, stepped out of the frying pan into the fire.  She suffers all forms of degradation until finally -- well, I won't give it away, but let me just say that the ending is both totally unexpected and more than a little disturbing!

""Safe in Hell"" is one of the titles in the Warner Archives series of DVDs.  These discs are manufactured on demand, and burned on DVD-R rather than pressed.  The film has not been remastered, much less restored, and the print contains some noticeable dirt, splices, and other visual artifacts.  It's not unwatchable, but picky viewers should be aware that the print is hardly pristine.  Even so, this intriguing little film is something of a rarity, and its availability is decidedly welcome.  Back in 1931, ""Safe in Hell"" was recommended for ""Adult Audiences Only"", and even in today's more permissive environment, that caveat remains true.  Enjoy!",1327363200,33,1802,5.050675675675675
8493260,2,B00652FG42,"My personal opinion: 2 stars is being very generous. Not only is the storyline poor, the characters are refugees from a Popeye cartoon. Over acted ? You bet.
This is all my fault though. After 10 minutes into this movie I realized that I saw this on TMC a couple of years ago and did not like it THEN. Same reasons.",1468972800,,315,4.180327868852459
8493261,4,B00652FG42,"A confession: when I finally got around to watching Safe in Hell I was a bit disappointed. Considering its status as pre-Code cult favorite, I was expecting something more. Nonetheless, its still pretty darn good. William Wellmans fluid direction nicely underscores the sweltering, claustrophobic setting for the plot, a kind of synthesis of the fallen woman and tropical adventure story. Especially noteworthy is the collection of Gilda's lecherous would-be suitors on the island, who may be the creepiest group of characters in all of (non-horror) pre-Code. But the movie really belongs to Dorothy Mackaill as the lady with a past and Nina Mae McKinney as the no-nonsense hotel clerk. Mackaill in particular makes such a strong impression that I wondered why she didn't have a  bigger career. Despite a certain roughness around the edges, the pluses listed above allow Safe in Hell to eke out four stars.",1463184000,3,906,5.163265306122449

8493264,5,B00652FG42,"Dorothy Mackaill is one the most beautiful women at the dawn of Hollywood and once predicted be a strong competitor to legendry actresses Carol Lombard and Jean Harlow, but unfortunately her career was short lived for lack of good opportunities. This is one of the most controversial movies of the pre-code era that tackled difficult topics but managed to pass the scrutiny of the church and the public.

One of the iconic photograph of the beautiful MacKaill sitting in a scantily cladded neglig&eacute;e with legs spread is from this movie, and this has been re-printed in many books about pre-code films. In this 1931 movie, brilliantly directed by William Wellman, the story revolves around gorgeous Mackaill. With a string of bad lucks in her jobs, at the height of great depression, she is forced to practice the ""oldest profession"" to pay her bills. In addition, she had to face a false rap that she murdered her male customer. She runs with her boyfriend and lives in a remote Caribbean island. The motel is inhabited by a group of lecherous and criminal men who try to make all kinds of unwanted advances towards her when her sailor boyfriend is away. But she staves off all their advances, because she loved her boyfriend. She waits for him until he returns from his business. Unforeseen circumstances develop that puts her into much deeper trouble. This is an outstanding drama and one of the best performances of Dorothy Mackaill. A similar themed movie was made by another sensational actress Tallulah Bankhead in the 1932 movie ""Faithless"" starring Robert Montgomery. I very much enjoyed watching this movie and I highly recommend this to anyone interested in the films of Dorothy Mackaill, Hollywood history, early Hollywood and pre-code movies.",1410220800,6,1760,5.006825938566553
8493265,4,B00652FG42,"I saw this today on TCM so my comments are based on the film not the DVD.  Gilda is a prostitute who goes on the lam to flee an alleged murder rap. She is aided by an old sailor boyfriend who loves her and, traveling by boat, he takes her to an island he knows about where she'll be ""safe"".  But not just any island. This is a hiding place for criminals of all sorts because they can't be arrested there. It is apparently out of any jurisdiction. There, the couple perform their own marriage ceremony and, as she loves him too, she promises her chastity to him and him alone when he has to leave her to go back on ship. When left alone at the seedy hotel, she is on her own with all these strange,dangerous men. But Gilda is tough and proves she can outsmart and hold her own among these characters... except for one very evil man whom everyone is afraid of because he is held as ""the law"". In a weird turn of events, everything changes...forever. I found ""Safe in Hell'' to be a true Pre-code film  but not any more rough than others I've seen. Sure, it's typically frank but doesn't hold a candle to ,say, 1933's ""Baby Face"" with Barbara Stanwyck.  It is however a well acted and truly bizarre film. Dorothy Mackaill shines as Gilda , a fallen woman who recovers her values and is determined, at any cost, to stay true to the man she loves. She certainly should've had a better career. I do recommend ""Safe in Hell"" for Pre-code enthusiasts.  It's a valuable relic of a bygone era that should be restored and treated with the dignity and care it deserves.",1409875200,,1557,4.318493150684931
