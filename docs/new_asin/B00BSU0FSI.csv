5670256,2,B00BSU0FSI,"As a pastor, I'm always looking for suitable DVDs to show in church.  We've learned the hard way the wisdom of previewing everything before it's shown.  One of these comedians made a joke about his five-year-old son being more adept at ordering a male libido product over the Internet than he is.  This same comedian does an extended routine about all the things his wife stores in her bra, which she can even use to open soda bottles.  This entire comedy show for all three comedians was presented at the Ridgecrest Christian Conference Center, which made these type of jokes even more surprising.  Our family tossed this DVD into the trash as unsuitable.",1394064000,7,656,4.769911504424779
5670257,1,B00BSU0FSI,"I bought this because a couple of the reviews were so good, but when I watched it, the pace of the first two comedians was really slow.  The third comedian who juggles was better and I will admit that I stopped watching after his short performance.  He was doing a long performance as the last part of the DVD, but by then I was too disappointed to watch the rest.",1392595200,,364,4.185714285714286
5670258,4,B00BSU0FSI,"Bought this primarily for Jeff Allen.  Have seen him in concert, shook his hand, an inspiration in himself and the power of faith.  Did not know the other two but was open to their offering.  Ron Pearson was very good, had both the wife and I to giggling.  Mr Alberstadt was ammusing as well but definitely number three in our priority list to look up.",1389657600,,352,4.369230769230769
5670259,5,B00BSU0FSI,My husband and I just laughed our heads off watching this video! What great clean fun and each one is different and funny in their own right. A great way to spend 2 1/2 hours!!,1378080000,2,176,4.057142857142857
5670260,5,B00BSU0FSI,"This is one of their best. They focus on marriage and raising kids. Each one has a different style, so there's something for everyone. There's even some very impressive juggling at the end. It's nice to have some good clean fun for the family. You won't find any shock jokes here. Anyone that's married, has raised kids, or plans to, will relate to their humor. No preaching, just life experiences delivered by pros in comedy. My daughter was the one that found these guys, and we've been laughing ever since. I was happy to find a new one.",1374796800,5,540,4.520408163265306
5670261,4,B00BSU0FSI,"Jeff Allen is funny! Makes the whole family laugh. The others are entertaining, but don't recommend for under 13. Some topics broached could have been left out of the routines.",1426723200,,176,4.9

5670264,2,B00BSU0FSI,"The opening was very slow and actually not very funny. We resisted turning it off since someone recommended we watch it and because we paid for it. Fortunately, the last several comedy routines were better and made us laugh a bit.",1412812800,,230,4.634146341463414
5670265,5,B00BSU0FSI,I've always liked Jeff Allen but Keith Alberstadt (Jenkins) stole the show.  Clean comedy but very contemporary.,1411171200,,112,5.588235294117647
5670266,5,B00BSU0FSI,"I was needing a laugh and Jeff Allen was the only one who could deliver without offending me.  I'm sick of shock humor.  So, there are two more guys in addition to Jeff; I found them ok, but could really identify with Jeff Allen.",1410912000,,229,4.181818181818182

5670269,5,B00BSU0FSI,"Good clean honest and in some cases pretty raw ( clean raw ) comedy. No profanity and very thought provoking
my entire family including kids 11 and 12 loved it. We watched in twice in 24 hours. Don't understand the bad reviews
but don't understand Bieber and Hilton either.",1407628800,,273,4.591836734693878
5670270,3,B00BSU0FSI,"We weren't as impressed with this one as much as we were with the first Apostles of Comedy.  It was still good, just not the same.  Love that these guys keep it clean!!",1404864000,,168,4.0606060606060606
