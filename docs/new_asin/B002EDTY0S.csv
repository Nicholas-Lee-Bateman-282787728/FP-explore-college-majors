8367618,4,B002EDTY0S,"California's Eastern Sierra DVD is good, could have been better with more detail and helpful hints. Travel with John & Barbara on their photo shoot as they travel the region. DVD contains great footage of the Sierras. You will learn much to plan your own photo shoot to the area or appreciate the beauty with some photo tips.
