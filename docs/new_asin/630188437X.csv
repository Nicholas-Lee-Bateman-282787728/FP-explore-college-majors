7816531,5,630188437X,"Juris Podnieks was one of the most important directors to come out of Latvia and the former Soviet Union during the time of glasnost. This film is the perfect example of his talent for artistically displaying the realism of the world around him. This film tells the story of several young Latvians and their struggles to understand the world of confusion that surrounds them. Through his intense interviews, Podnieks was able to showcase critiques of the Soviet system and attitudes that were indicative of the rebellion that was to happen only a few years later in the Baltic States and elsewhere in the Soviet Union. Podnieks' style in this film is eerily similar to Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange,"" despite the fact that this is a documentary. A truly stunning and visionary film.",989539200,5,790,4.947368421052632
