No other Martial Art can compare to the raw power this system can produce and keep producing, even years after attaining it. These Maneuvers are not your typical 100 techniques to execute one move for one body part, That's a pure wast of energy and time, just one maneuver has an unlimited amount of ways of execution to neutralize a hostile individual or group. For those who are experienced in Martial Arts or those who want to learn how to be healthy and protect themselves and their loved ones should buy this product!!! Well worth the Time and Money!!",1340323200,,727,4.6434108527131785
8658418,5,B008CXUS3Q,"Turning 50 years old and studying the martial arts for several years I discovered it should be a holistic approach instead of just fighting. I'm so excited with the training in this system that not only protects  me in my daily life, but generates enormous amounts of energy to eliminate fatigue that sometimes creates a depressing mood. I'm no longer tired at work and have extra energy to workout when I get home. Qigong QI Energy Force Breathing generates energy flow in the first few minutes and continues to get stronger the more time I trained. We always hear the expression that Qigong or Tai Ji is an old man's art, but looking at the condition of Master Dodaro at 58 years old I realize it means that you get stronger as you get older. The series of DVDs work well together to create a body that naturally conditions mentally and physically, strengthens the skeletal structure with proper bone density that protects vital organs, sculptures the muscles, and energizes the mind to develop a powerful body that executes incredible force with no tension or anger simultaneously in each posture. The 7 Blows of the Dragon is the craziest and fastest System I ever saw because it creates maximum results with minimum effort instantly. I understand how Female Law Enforcement Officers in Master Dodaro's defensive tactical class are overwhelmed with their performance. Over the years I followed some of the famous hard style martial artists to discover that have had hip and knee replacements, and from all the tension in punching, some have suffered heart attacks in their young ages. I have increased my strength and power by practicing Qigong daily by stimulating my mind to develop the muscular system to react immediately. My mind ignites my imagination to start the process of transformation of the Three Secret Treasure Energies that has changed the entire structure of my life knowing more about how powerful the mind can become as it is vital to have a strong body to generate energy back to the mind. Master Dodaro is able to translate ancient knowledge and wisdom into language that I can understand through physical movement. In America we only view the Martial Arts as a fighting system that we may never use, but may find it more beneficial to include conditioning mentally and physically by promoting enhanced health. America has devastating health issues and reading a quote from Harvard Medical School it stated that Tai Chi a form of Qigong was the best kept secret in medical history and that the amount of disease it can prevent and cure is astronomical. The sad news is that the majority of teachers in Qigong and Tai Chi have promoted themselves to Masters and certified instructors with little knowledge of the arts and are destroying the system. Few people in the world besides China have authentic credentials from famous educators and have dedicated their lives as Master Dodaro has. I want to take time to explain this to you because America may not survive in the future if the population doesn't become healthy and the fast 20 minute workouts are not functional as over 80% of the population is overweight and even worse America has spent over $300 billion on prescription drugs last year that is more than the entire world combined. My education has been generated by researching Master Dodaro's teaching methodology through his DVDs, PDF Pamphlets, and Tactical Defense CD Manual. I am happy to see the DVD system on Amazon giving Master Dodaro the international exposure he deserves.",1340150400,,3518,4.912605042016807
