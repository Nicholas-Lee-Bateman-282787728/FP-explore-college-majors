1707024,5,B0000649JL,"This delightful piece relates of an unscheduled jaunt aboard a locomotive ""borrowed"" by veteran trainmen Will Henry (Wilford Brimley) and Leo Pickett (Levon Helm) after their employer, Southland Railroad, shifts its manner of freight transport to the airlanes, resulting in the closure of a railyard in Clifford, Arkansas, with a subsequent loss to many in the small town of their livelihood. Freshman director Jay Russell, invited while attending a similarly fledgling Sundance Institute's workshop to develop his script, does so very effectively, with most of the filming taking place near his hometown of Little Rock, enabling Russell's strongly regional feeling for the South to aid him in composing a very personal, well-executed work. The locomotive is being taken by Will and Leo to Chicago, wherein the pair hope to present their grievances to the parent corporation's board chairman, and Russell formulates a recipe for some delicious humour, some satirical, during the adventure, with blessedly minimal slapstick, focussing not only upon the two railroaders but their waiting families, as well. A well-selected cast is aptly directed, with particularly strong performances from Kevin Bacon, Mary Steenburgen and Holly Hunter, the last two of whom gift the scenario with delicious comedic timing. With talented supporting players helping to make possible a successful blend of whimsy and the didactic, END OF THE LINE belies its rather low budget, assisted to a large extent by cinematographer George Tirl, who here intensifies the standard colour scale while utilizing a wide range of facial lighting to help in representing performers' thoughts.",1161475200,,1656,5.5236220472440944
1707025,4,B0000649JL,"A railroad worker decides to steal a train engine to protest the closing of the freight depot where he was working for thirty years.

Looking back in our memory, we should remind the most important contribution in this sense, was given by Jiri Mentzel in ""Closed watched trains"", in the middle of those troubled years of the Czech resistance, to understand how the railroad men live in absolutely different coordinates of time and space.

Memorable performances make of this first film of Jay Russell a must-see.",1150329600,,512,4.941860465116279
1707026,4,B0000649JL,"This film is akin to The Flim Flam Man, starring George C. Scott. You'll recognize characters from your childhood, that you admired, but prayed you wouldn't duplicate.  Nevertheless the heroes in this film, have the  qualities in people you know you admire for the values you're not willing  to fight for.  You just love it when they appear in movies.",914198400,,351,4.8

7960775,4,B0000649JL,"This is a fairly good movie and I like Wilfred Brimley. He's one of those good ol' character actors that you don't see much anymore. He was doing commercials for awhile about diabetes medicine. He used to appear on a TV series ""Our House"" with a much younger Shannon Doherty. Kevin Bacon is Okay. The story of an man whose too old to seek another job somewhere else when the parent company decides to shut down and lay everyone off in a small town out the middle of nowhere. Wilfred Brimley's character fights back and they ""borrow"" the train and travel to Washington DC to argue their case to the senior officers of the railroad company and they get the politicians involved. It has a good ending. Kind of a fairy tale story when you compare it to the economy and company shutdowns going on today. It's mildly entertaining though. The picture quality of the streaming is not very good. So if you are expecting to get Hi Def you'll be disappointed.",1443916800,,948,4.517441860465116
7960776,1,B0000649JL,"We seek out bad movies and this is one of the worst that I have seen in a long time. This makes Jay Andrews look like Cecil B. DeMille. The dialog appears to be made up on the spot. Every character is a caricature-be it the shotgun toting, beer swilling, southern hick or the evil corporate executive. The ""plot"" is that an evil railroad exec decides to shut down it's rail service (played very oddly by Bob Balaban) and become an air freight company!? It's hard to feel too sorry for those who are going to lose their ""jobs"" as there is no work being done or any revenue being generated. I think Kevin Bacon spent one day filming his parts. You don't see him much. For all his acting prowess, he does not know how to pour a beer. (Hint: It's not the same as pouring water).
I was in pain as this locomotive lumbered on. Basically, nothing happens. I am pretty sure that stuff is supposed to happen in movies. You'll need the subtitles on to understand the dialog. Even the subtitles are bad. It often says ""laughing"" when nobody is. PAINFUL!!",1339372800,,1043,4.381443298969073
7960777,5,B0000649JL,This was an excellent movie on VHS tape.  The story is about a Railroad Corporation forgetting about all the people it affected by closing down the railroad and going to Air Freight.  This happens all the time by companies who out source it's products overseas thus ruining the economy of small towns and it's people.,1289692800,,317,4.745454545454545
7960778,2,B0000649JL,"I purchased this dvd because I have an all region dvd player by Toshiba.  The disk arrived and when I went to play it the picture which is supposedly in 4:3 was displayed in 16:9.  Furthermore the image was scrunched up.  I tried the various settings on the dvd player with no change.  My tv is an older JVC 27"" model from circa 1999.  I don't think it is to blame but I don't understand the result.  If this was common to all the copies of End of the Line it would have been commented on by others but no one has mentioned this problem. However, it happened to me so I pass it on as a possiblility for others.",1283904000,,610,4.041666666666667
