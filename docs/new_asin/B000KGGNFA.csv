8156564,4,B000KGGNFA,I had not ever seen this show on television- so I wanted to try it out on DVD.  This episode of Dead Tenants involves an investigation at a home where a family is plagued by what seems to be a lot of activity.  The home is on a hill near some sort of waterway and a set of railroad tracks.  Without spoiling the outcome of the investigation- I can say that the investigators are able to come up with a reasonable explanation for why the activity could be occurring in this home.  It's about an hour long- and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I would really have liked to see more than just the one episode on the dvd for that price.  Otherwise- definitely good.,1174694400,3,680,4.1603053435114505
