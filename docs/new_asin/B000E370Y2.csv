8104696,1,B000E370Y2,Feel bad. Really like this series and need it for teaching. Mine wore out so ordered this and got it in Spanish and no subtitles available. Spoke with representative and ordered it again after being told my next order would come in English. Came again in Spanish and had to get a refund. Don't know where to get this in English.,1446249600,,328,4.39344262295082
