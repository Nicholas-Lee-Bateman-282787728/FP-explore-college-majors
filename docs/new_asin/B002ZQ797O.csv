8611126,5,B002ZQ797O,This is a great DVD for those of us that do not have a closed season on muskies.  I've seen this guy before and read some of his stuff.  He knows what he is talking about.  If you can fish for muskies pre-spawn and during the spawn or if you live in one of the states that only has tiger muskies (hybrids) this is well worth the $$$ spent.,1450224000,,339,3.8840579710144927
