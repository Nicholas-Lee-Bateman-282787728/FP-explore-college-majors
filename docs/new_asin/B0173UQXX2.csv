7489237,5,B0173UQXX2,"Love the voice acting and the lore from the LN.  Yes it has one of the most irritating loli tsunderers but despite having 'some' reason to do so, she is easily dismissed and just as easily toyed with---many people think Claire is seriously as demented as her fury would define her, few realize she's simply joking.  I am only sad there is no second season.  Ren Ashbell for life!",1455148800,4,379,4.463768115942029

8738026,4,B0173UQXX2,"An interestingly unbalanced story, but one that is entertaining in a manner different than most anime.  In this case the story is used to make us create our own excuses for what happens or does not happen, and while it is not perfect it is, however, very entertaining.

If you want bang, boom, flash, kaboom, crunch crunch crunch, avoid this story.

If you like the idea of characters who are as lost as we are, this might be your cup of tea.",1525132800,,442,4.365853658536586

8738031,4,B0173UQXX2,"This one has a lot of hemlines and breast talk, but that's pretty much the extent of the fanservice. Lots of skin. Despite all that, I like it pretty well. The characters build up well. While it's obvious that they'll get together and make a team, it was pleasantly paced. I find anime that revolve around one boy - that protests the attention, and naked women offering themselves to him - annoying. But this guy is almost likable. He's got his mind on other things, and if the series had emphasized those a bit more, I'd have liked him more. He is a demon reborn, a cross dresser, someone that tested himself - but all of those things are part of his past. He's not quite developed in the now. I like the world they have going here. Obviously, the series is only 12 episodes, so there's a lot left out. The ending shows the team made, and they're off to the blade dance tournament. I'd like to see more of this series. Good animation, and, in a departure from most anime I've bought in the US, absolutely no English dubbing! Awesome. Just hit play at the menu.",1487376000,,1061,4.363636363636363
8738032,5,B0173UQXX2,I had already had the series on google but when I saw that it had extras I decided to get the blu ray and was not disappointed.,1486857600,,127,3.740740740740741
8738033,5,B0173UQXX2,"- Synopsis: A world about students contracting with spirits to test their skills in battle. The spirits users were all female, save for one Demon King. Now, the world is in for another shocker when our main character appears and has the ability to command his contracted spirits. With a mysterious background, the main character becomes the center of attention for all sorts of reasons. Tune in to find out his reasons for fighting, and his interactions with a school full of cute females.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: Though the main character is pretty typical of a lot of other main characters, at least he isn't weak and gets his butt kicked constantly. For the most part, at least. The main character is fairly mature and composed, for the most part. He also usually ends up being teased by the other characters. This may also be due to his overall kind-hearted nature.

The plot is simple. Nothing really that complex like in other animes. The interactions are silly, the girls are cute, the main character is calm and collected and isn't a push-over. It's refreshing to see a main character that isn't over-powered, but not a total weakling, either.

- Features: Japanese and English audio. Includes 12 episodes on 2 Blu-rays with a run-time of about 5 hours. Rated TV-14 for violence and sexual content.
