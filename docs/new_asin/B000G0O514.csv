The same goes with 2 out of the 3 videos, which look more like the band fooling around having fun trying to make up a vid than a pro shot.
The concert is very good musically, the camera work is ok (pro but ok pro, nothing great either, but then again it's the tight-budget, almost DIY Hermano way of doing things, which is one of the reasons i like them). My only disappointment concerns the audio of the concert. Although it's very listenable and there is nothing ""wrong"" jumping to your ears, it could have been much better. First of all, (and it's probably the biggest flaw in my opinion) the sound seems to be mono, and i really don't see any reason for that. It obviously lacks a lot of depth and dimensionality compared to what could have been achieved with a stereo mix. Secondly, probably because of the previous, the instruments are not always balanced the optimum way (for example, Dave Angstrom guitar often masks too much of Olly's work in my opinion). And also, the mixer could have made more use of spatial effects (i.e. reverb and delay) to add more depth, dimension and clarity to the mix, especially on John Garcia's vocal which are to dry and way up front IMO, and would have tucked much better in the mix with the appropriate treatment.
But overall, a great dvd by an amazing band.",1210723200,,1464,4.528301886792453

LET'S GET IT ON, indeed!",1203033600,,302,4.410714285714286
