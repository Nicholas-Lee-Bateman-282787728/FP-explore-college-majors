It is serious, tells it like it is, and is filmed in the south puget sound area.  Chris Corey and his cast did an awesome job.  Sherwood Pictures watch out, there are others out there also being used by God in the film industry.  By the way, the female detective is wonderful!!",1319673600,6,405,4.418918918918919
4526096,1,B0051T479K,"Hilarious, Cheesy,low budget film centering around white youth trying to imitate black inner city poor. Tough Obese girls that look like Winston Churchill portraying themselves off as ""Hot"". Stick to Boys in the Hood or other realistic videos, not this type
of make believe,ultra low budget trashy junk.",1318896000,,303,5.333333333333333

8453252,1,B0051T479K,"I cant believe the good reviews this movie received, I bought it because of them.  I would never show this movie to my children no matter how old they are.  How could a Christian recommend this movie?  Too much drugs, sex via the exotic dancer, and I had to rewind a scene to make sure a character didn't curse.  I am all for Christian movies, but there was no redeeming quality about this film.  Its like the makers of this film wanted to sin vicariously through this movie while maintaining a Christian veneer.

This movie is going right in the trash where it belongs!",1410307200,,570,4.4326923076923075
8453253,4,B0051T479K,"Movie slow but ok.  Might be good for someone who had a drug problem, would share if I talk to someone in that predicament",1376870400,,122,4.083333333333333
8453254,5,B0051T479K,Our family only watches movies we believe would be pleasing to the Lord. We do not watch secular TV. We buy christian based DVD's instead of TV. This movie is on our shelf. A keeper! We recommend!,1368316800,2,196,4.324324324324325
8453255,4,B0051T479K,The message of this movie is about almost every phase of what broken homes do to the people involved. It does a wonderful job at telling the story of a lost soul that finds redemption at the foot of the cross.,1354492800,,209,4.121951219512195
8453256,1,B0051T479K,"They were trying to bring a good message out. But between bad casting, bad acting, bad directing, the message was lost.  I'll give them a A for trying, but it's not a movie that I would recommend at all.  Also, I'm always looking for good material to promote to my church. And there's no way I could do that with this movie.",1325635200,,324,4.209677419354839

8453258,1,B0051T479K,"Even tho the message was excellent and even tho I am very good at overlooking film quality for a good message, this movie was terrible. The acting was too embarasssing for me even to use it as an evangelistic tool with non-Christians",1324080000,,233,4.571428571428571
