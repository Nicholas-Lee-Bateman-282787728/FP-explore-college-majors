1647037,1,B00005QAR8,"This is even worse than the original Nosferatu, a silent film. The story is not fully written, it can't seem to decide if it is a vampire story, or a distopian science fiction story. The setting is never explained, or even noticed by the actors. They dress for the 1940's with dashes of the 1990's thrown in. They behave as if it were just after WWII, so why does it seem that half the story setting was stolen from George Orwell's 1984? That there are vampires is just a coincidence. The story would have worked better without them.",1018051200,3,533,4.448979591836735
1647038,5,B00005QAR8,"I am not a vampire movie fan; but this movie hook me. Probably because it dealt less with blood-sucking & gave a different view to prejudice. Mr Paul who plays the vampire - is dark, quiet, yet you can feel his strength & anger. I have seen this movie 5 times since I first purchase & each time I see something new & pick up another what if? for conversation with friends & relatives. My family who I have driven crazy regarding Mr Paul & his others movies: Highlander-Endgame (which was killed by the editing dept); Merlin-The Return, Last Rites w/Tom Berenger, Love Potion #9 (etc) have finally agreed to what I have said for many years. Adrian Paul is one of Hollywood most underrated actors. Give him a role - & he gives it life, you forget you are watching a movie, you feel as if you were given a chance to see a moment, a day in someone else life. His talent for accents, bringing humor into whatever role he plays. Take the chance, & you will discover what I have. Thank you",1016841600,,982,4.313513513513514
1647039,4,B00005QAR8,"I like Adrian Paul and Bookeem Woodbine did an good job as well. The film suffers somewhat by its obviously small budget but it is still very entertaining and I liked the dark brooding atmosphere of the film. If you like films like ""Blade"" and ""John Carpenter's Vampires"" then you'll probably like this film.",1012780800,,308,4.722222222222222
1647040,5,B00005QAR8,"This is a remarkable movie, & has come a long way from the Dracula movies of the 50's & 60's. Although this film will not be for everyone, it is powerfully archetypal & will become a cult classic. Vampires with their own society, with their own unique personalities-- they really do "" bleed "" into a homosapien world. Adrian Paul does a good job & Bai Ling is magnificent. The photography is other-worldly in a familiar, unsettling sort of way. The sets are decadent, but also possess a timeless quality. The political overtones are fascinating as well. Only the vampire terrorists are violent, etc. This is a truly fine movie & deserves more than one viewing.",1012608000,5,660,4.698275862068965

1647042,5,B00005QAR8,"This is the best vampire movie I have seen since John Carpenter's Vampires. The old vampire story is re-vamped in this original, creative, and exciting film. It takes place in the near future and features a curious futuristic set. Techno music adds to the chilling, adrenaline filled atmosphere. I highly reccomend this movie to anyone. It has mystery, suspense, action, horror, it makes you think, its original, and even has some good touches of humor. Bokeem Woodbine, Adrian Paul, and the female lead vampire all provide mezmerizing performances. Paul is ultra cool as a new breed of police officer. THe vampire's teeth look more real then I have ever seen and the plot was impossible for me to predict (which is a good thing). I can't wait to see it again. This film was put together by some very creative people who did an excellent job! If you are a vampire movie fan you will love this one!",1009929600,11,897,4.6835443037974684
1647043,3,B00005QAR8,"This movie puts itself off as a buddy cop movie filmed in a film noir setting.  As bad as this sounds it actually comes out fairly well.  The movie only has one decent actor in Adrian Paul, who gives a decent but inconsistant performace as a Polish vampire with a tainted past trying to track down one of his rogue bretheren(point in case, he has accent throughout the movie with the very noticable execption of about two sceanes where it disappeares).  The other main character is a cop who lost his partner to a vampire on a killing spree, is an overwritten and fairly annoying role.  This is where the movie makes its main mistake.  Instead of making this character a Danny Golver clone from lethal weapon, they should have cut out half of his lines and focused more on making a more visual movie in a more film noir setting.  The movie looks good and has its high points, it just doesn't know when to shut up.  Constiring that this was a movie a saw completely by accedent, it wasn't too bad.",1008547200,10,996,4.409836065573771
1647044,4,B00005QAR8,"(...)Definitely a film for fans of vampire films, noir detective dramas, and Adrian Paul.
My complaint is that the near future resembles the fifties too much-- a director's choice, I know, to emphasize the resemblance to Nazis, but I felt it was a bit heavy handed.
(...)See this film, even if you don't care to own it.",1007164800,,319,4.614035087719298
1647045,4,B00005QAR8,"The movie starts with two police detectives tracking a serial killer.  They find the latest victim--but they also find her killer, who proceeds to attack them.  One detective survives, and reports back to his superiors the bizarre acts he witnessed.  He is informed that vampires do exist, and that he has survived an attack by one.  In addition, the vampire community wants to find the killer as badly as the mortals do, and have provided the use of one of their own detectives, played by Adrian Paul (of ""Highlander, the Series"" fame).  The mortal detective isn't thrilled to be working with one of the same types of creatures that killed his partner, but has little choice in the matter.
And so begins a movie that is part buddy-picture, part supernatural thriller, and part old-fashioned murder mystery.  In addition, the movie is set in a slightly Orwellian world--the colors are muted, and there are loudspeakers in the police station spewing rhetoric as the people go about their business.  But some things remain the same--the Nazis did still exist, as Adrian Paul's Jewish vampire will attest.  Indeed, there is a bit of metaphor throughout the movie with the vampires playing the part of the oppressed Jews.  Enough about the subtext, however--how good is the movie?
First, Adrian Paul plays one hell of a vampire.  He's got a slight Polish accent that makes the character.  He's also got an irritated sigh/grunt he breaks out whenever his partner says something really ridiculous that you won't be able to stop grinning at.  He cuts to the chase, and he has little tolerance for flippancy--but he still possesses his own wry sense of humor, and his take on both the vampire and human worlds is priceless.
And then there's his partner (whose name I don't recall).  Brash, boorish, intentionally insensitive--your typical hard-boiled detective.  He's also black, which doesn't have much to do with anything, except that the movie has a little fun with his racist attitude towards the vampires.  Watching him plow through the strange world of the vampires is entertaining, as he tries to judge them by his own standards, yet finds himself having to admit that not all vampires are bad--especially the foxy lady vamp played by Ling Bai!
For those worried that this movie is sounding too high-brow, you'll be relieved to know that the banter & social commentary are punctuated by pretty intense action scenes, featuring Matrix-esque gunplay and displays of vampiric might.  Having seen Adrian Paul's Highlander character wielding a sword for several years, it was quite a fun change to see him engaging in two-fisted handgun action!
Adrian Paul fans should definitely see this movie.  Vampire fans should also see it, as the film does a good job of portraying an actual society of vampires, rather than just a few isolated indivduals.  There are no big special effects, just lots of action and characters you'll enjoy getting to know.",1006300800,22,2940,4.977505112474438

It's a dark, harsh, unsettling story, but one that's so different from the usual vampire tale, it immediately captures the attention.  I even liked it so much I had the audacity to write a certain broadcasting network and suggest they consider it for a television series.  Did they listen? Only Time will tell.  In the meantime, if you want something extraordinary when it comes to vampires--though I will admit it's bloody--consider The Breed.  It beats Underworld and all those other tales of vampires trying to reconcile themselves to humans by a mile!",1323993600,,643,4.925925925925926
1647096,3,B00005QAR8,"How times have changed. Vampires are now considered merely as a mutated form of the human species, are only slightly irritated by sunlight and have a synthetic substitute for blood nourishment. But now, a renegade vampire is killing off humans and feeding in a more traditional fashion than his peers. One of the victims was Steven Grant's partner, so when the National Security Agency asks him to hop aboard the mission (with Adrian ""Highlander"" Paul, no less) to track down the rogue bloodsucker, he's on it. And if the multitude of F-bombs Steve drops are any indication of his enthusiasm, well, shall we say ""Mission Accomplished"" now or later? Okay, so you're dealt with a slew of overacting (and under, for that matter) and probably could've used a bit more vampire action, but the weird setting warrants enough intrigue for you to sit through it all. The NSA headquarters' decor and uniforms look strikingly old school Russian, the cars all look like models from the '40s and '50s, and our main man Steve sports a hat and overcoat ala '40s style private eye. Yet, this is set in ""the near future"". Unusual, if unremarkable viewing. Still, I can't dislike anything with Bai Ling as a vampire seductress who owns a pet panther. 5.25/10",1291161600,,1240,4.826291079812207
1647097,5,B00005QAR8,"The Breed is an edgy vampire flick with a gothic love story and a twisted plot of murder and deception in a fascist police state. Pros: Great style, great film shots and just enough emotion and unpredictability to keep you engaged. Cons: Not really any, it's a complete story that all adds up, experienced by credible characters (for this genre especially) and it has a satisfying ending. I hope we'll see more of the actors involved; each brings a unique flair to their roles. (I really loved this film; it's a keeper.)",1191974400,,520,4.663043478260869
1647098,5,B00005QAR8,From what I remember this vampire movie was really unique.  It reminded me of Pulp Fiction with the style of Anne Rice.

1647100,5,B00005QAR8,"That's mostly what you need to know about the movie - it's an intriguing notion.  Vampires have recently announced their presence to the world, now that they have a serum to take instead of drinking blood.  NSA cop Steven Grant is understandably upset about this after his partner is killed by a vampire, especially when he is teamed up with vampire cop Aaron Gray.  However, they slowly reach an uneasy truce and start to work together to figure out who it is that is killing people, since vampires are actually a peaceful people who find murder to be distasteful.  Along the way, Gray introduces Grant to the beautiful Lucy Westerna and Grant finds himself falling in love.  We meet some other very memorable characters - the character of West, who is apparently Slavic, looks and sounds Irish, interestingly enough (I guess it is because he is a slavering revolutionary?).

One of the most amusing things about this - for me anyway - is the overtones of 1984 with the constant announcements at the NSA headquarters (""The open hand does not grasp discipline"" ""Nothing is true, everything is permissible"") and the signs (""Informing on your enemy makes him your friend"" ""One step forward 1/2 step back""); not to mention that people dressed in decidedly Soviet military style or 50s style, and everyone smoked all the time.

The cinematography was beautiful; the whole film is washed out, creating almost a black & white effect, while retaining some color.  All the vampires are quite pale, of course, but other than that and their fangs, they really aren't so different - even to having children.  The acting is pretty good and who wouldn't love Grant's sexy voice?

OK, I'm a fan of the vampire genre so of course I'd like it; but also this gave us a different look at the world and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  If you like vampire flicks at all, you'll love this one!",1173484800,4,1866,4.728395061728395

1647118,2,B00005QAR8,"I rented this movie because i love adrien paul in highlander and well the premise that he is a vampire makes it all the sweeter. Unfortunatly he alone could not carry the film. The movie is set in an skewed alternate version of the reality we all know. The version we get is a neo nazi like world in a bleak black and blue hue. The funny thing right off is the human police station is littered with propaganda messages and posters. Why the filmakers put that in this movie is beyond me. I guess their trying to convey the surrealism of this world. Vampires in this ""reality"" exist and recently exposed themsleves to humans at a risk of being demonized. Then when the process is at its critical stage, a serial killer emerges from the shadows and starts picking off young college girls. We find out that the killer is a vampire and has a political agenda. Which is to stop the vampires assimilation into humanity. A great premise which is killed at the very begining. The acting at best was a classic b-film. The actors look as though they know that the script sucks but they try to make it seem as if it doesn't. Adrien Paul is very convincing in his role as vampire cop Aaron. He is the only bright spot in the film. Bai Ling is a eccentric female vampire who falls for Bookem Woodbine's character. I forget his characters name because he was as wooden as you can be. He doesn't fit the whole ""tough cop in a bad situation trying to make the most of it"" kinda guy. The scenes in themselves seem ridiculous. At one point in the film Adrien Paul's character is shooting at human cops because they attacked first i guess. He does this spinning in the air thing and you can obviously tell that he's spinning on wires. The sex scene reminded me of well a soft core porno because the music in that scene sounded just like the chessy music in such a film. Minus the nudity. You see them bumping and grinding but it never really goes anywhere. And they like showing a pillar apparently in the ""bedroom"" with ivy and water pouring down it. Maybe that is an innuendo. The nudity that is in the film is downright ridiculous and makes the audience feel embarrased to watch it. Over all i think it could have been done better and i only watch it to see adrien paul in all his sexy vampire glory. I'd let him bite me anytime.",1124496000,,2312,4.341801385681293

1647120,1,B00005QAR8,"Okay where to start. If you are considering buying this movie, let me encourage you to make your own decision. This is just my opinion. The film was incredibly horrible, as Adrian Paul's acting skills are drowned by the poor actors around him. Woodbine tried his best, but this is definitely not the role for him. Bai Ling was herself, but regardless of who played the roles the film was doomed from the beginning. They could have put Wesley Snipes  in Woodbine's role and Yoko Matsugane in Bai Ling's role, and the film still would have been a heap of putrid trash. (would have been some great love scenes though). The supposedly ""hot"" love scene between Woodbine and Bai Ling just made obvious how this story plot was garbage.

I could tell from the moment he went into her house he was going to have sex with her later on in the film. They were stairing at each other like two dogs in heat. Also, just a thought, why in the world would you want to have sex with a vampire? IF you know she is a vampire and drinks blood, why would you want to sleep with her? The action sequences were so choppy it didn't even make sense. Just how many times were they going to switch camera shots to make up for the fact that the characters lacked any real motion. Viewers may also want to note that there is a stupid computer that continues to interrupt the film with information on vampires. Instead of adding a narrator, they try to make up with it by adding a green computer monitor with spinning drunken 3d heads that form into the vampires they are searching for.

  If you want to be frightened, just go buy Jeapers Creepers II. Films like this should be in the $2.00 bin at Wal-mart. Right next to a movie about a guy having an affair with a ventriloquist dummy.

If you are a Bai Ling fan, and you wan't to see her body, BUY IT! If you are a fan of vampire films, and you want expect this film to be good. Then good luck, because it is absolutely detestable when compared to Interview with a Vampire. Whoever wrote this script must have not put much effort into it, because I think I could do better myself. This is the type of film that comes on around 2:00 a.m. on the sci-fi channel, just before paid programming.",1122768000,4,2211,4.328502415458937

If you want a cinematic masterpiece, then it's not the movie for you.

Now he must follow a string of murders with the help of his new partner, Aaron (Adrian Paul), who just so happens to be one of this ""new breed"" of humanity. Dark and filled with just the right amount of action, ""The Breed"" is a good vampire drama that also has a message about prejudice hidden within it. Woodbine (""Hard Cash"") is fine as our main character, but Paul (""Highlander: Endgame"") is the star. Not only can Paul act, he can fight. He has all the right moves to be the next big action star. All he needs is a break from his direct-to-video run. Overall, this is makes a great renter, but it's not as cool as, say, ""Underworld.""",1075852800,2,819,4.394736842105263
1647136,5,B00005QAR8,"Director Michael Oblowitz is to be credited for offering such a fresh and unusual twist to the vampire legend.  An obvious morality tale about accepting people that are different, this vampire story focuses on the vampires who have ""come out"" and are taking a substitute drug instead of blood; and of the vampires who don't want to come out, and therefore want to erase manking as we know it.  Typical (think X-Men); but Adrian Paul, Bokeem Woodbine and Bei Ling are mesmerizing; if Paul is ""stiff"" it fits into his tortured character, and he pulls it off in a sordid, campy way.
But look at some of the visuals of this sumptuos movie:  the opening scene where the vampire attacks the two cops and is then shown walking the rooftops is almost ""cartoonish"" in its beauty, but dazzling nonetheless.  Notice that in this future society, there are many anachronistic touches:  they type on typewriters; they drive old cars; even the clothing is reminiscent of the forties and beyond, and doesn't vampire Cross remind you of Nosferatu?  In the police station, a recorded PA voice spouts out some really weird euphuisms; the posters on their walls are intriguing; and in one bar scene, doesn't it recall vintage gangster movies?

1647137,3,B00005QAR8,"It's really not a bad movie.  The best part of the movie was the atmosphere.  The acting leaves something to be desired, although there are some good moments from the entire cast (except for Bokeem Woodbine, which I'm not entirely sure why he was cast because he doesn't quite fit the role - it's as if he doesn't want to be in the movie).  If you are a fan of this genre, I would recommend it.  It's kind of cheesy, but entertaining.  I think people that gave this a low rating are really just taking it too seriously.",1075680000,3,519,4.255102040816326
1647138,4,B00005QAR8,"As a collector of B vampire movies, this instantly hit my top ten.  The premise is nearly impossible to describe, but suffice it to say that you've never seen one quite like this before.  Starring the always intense Adrian Paul as a hilariously stiff Polish vampire, and Bai Ling as... well, the same sort of outrageous, overdressed 'vamp' she always plays, this dark and weird thriller is worth a look.",1052006400,,403,4.742857142857143
1647139,4,B00005QAR8,"Set in a bleak, communistic, not-so-distant future a conflicted young NSA officer whose partner is murdered by your not-so-run-of-the-mill villian. Fangs? But the report on the murder gets a surprising reaction. Apparently he is not crazy, a new Breed of humans have just revealed themselves after centuries of secrecy. But not everyone wants an alliance with humanity to succeed. And it is up to the young cop and his new partner, a vampire, to save both the breeds.
  I definitely think this is a great movie for the horror lover as well as fans of Adrian Paul. My favorite leading man does have some very exciting scenes in this movie. Some of the dialogue is a little too forced and cryptic and the choriography definitely leaves something to be desired, and you wish it would just slow down and develope the characters a bit more but overall I think this is a must-see movie. With the Forever Knight esc plot and realistic makeup it usually makes up for its dificiencys and manages to hold together as a fairly good film.",1047686400,14,1026,4.694444444444445

1647141,2,B00005QAR8,"The 2 stars I have given this film is for the the only 2 ""real"" stars of this mess; Adrian Paul and Bai Ling...As for the horrible acting (if you can call it that) by Boreem Woodbine is as wooden as it gets ! It is the near future in a dark and atmospheric almost neo-Nazi noirish world where vampires have just recently revealed themselves to humanity.  However, humanity is not ready to accept them. Vampires are now the most persecuted, feared, and hated race on earth ! One renegade vampire is on a human killing spree . It is up to a human detective (Woodbine) and a vampire detective(Paul) with the help of the beautifully exotic and eccentric female vampire (Bai Ling) to track down and capture this renegade of the vampire underworld...
Truth be told that most vampire movies in today's modern age hold very little shock or horror value as in the ""olden"" days anymore (seen it, been there, done it, kinda attitude)...However, this so-called stylish film part-time fashion show and bottom of the barrel acting by secondary or (un)supporting actors puts the vampire story and the movie's story(myth,legend, or otherwise) into complete hilarity...Some of the effects are poorly executed much like the acting by Woodbine ( visible cable wires attached to actors, Adrian Paul's character sliding on a poorly hidden track board in a shooting sequence). In time I'm sure the creator of this post mortem production will say that it was meant to be this way as a sort of tongue and cheek homage to the older vampire Hollywood films...However, this is no homage or tribute;It's just insulting to the audience and the fool like me who rented it (one born every day, right?!)...Save your time and money. Unless, you are a truly die hard fan of Adrian Paul or Bai Ling or both more power to you. Otherwise, SKIP IT !...
P.S.  Here's the hint to skipping this stinker...If you see only one VHS copy (no dvd) in one of the 2 hugest video rental stores in the nation, there's a reason ! I should have heeded such a warning.",1033948800,,2015,4.657303370786517
1647142,4,B00005QAR8,"this is more like a 3 and a half stars rating.what brought this movie down for me was the sloppy hong kong wire work.the people who was doing it seemed like they never did it before.it looked so awful it was just corny.wich brought this otherwise decent flick down.the mood and scenematogrphy was good,so was the story.but the attempts at the john woo style action failed in most scenes.some looked good but for the most part they failed horribly with the action.if they had suceeded in the action part this would have been the best strait to video movie i had ever seen.but if they make a sequel they should learn from their mistakes",1032739200,2,634,4.5701754385964914
1647143,2,B00005QAR8,"I don't particularly like vampire flicks, but am very attracted by the name of Bai Ling, so I watched this movie.  She was in Jodie Foster's ""Anna and the King"" (which I hate) and in ""Wild Wild West"" (no comment).  In both films, she was utterly ill-used, because of the misguided directors who don't know what to do.  Then this one came.
If you seek for blood-sucking vampires, ""The Breed"" is not the place.  The setting is unique, some people might find, but actually is another version of buddy movie, with one vampire (Adrian Paul) and one human (Bokeem Woodbine), both trying to catch a serial killer.  The near future society of humans has become totalitarian, like that of ""Brazil,"" and the leader of vampires, not entirely hostile to humans, proposes to stop sucking humans' blood, content with substitute food which taste very bad.  But as the investigation proceeds, the unlikely pair is about to find a conspiracy that would change the whole world.
Well, that is the sketch of the story, and it is fairly interesting.  However, the director Michael Oblowitz, too intent on styles, forgets to entertain us with coherent storytelling.  Like his previous ""This World Then the Firework,"" he shows interesting ideas and stylish cameraworks, but soon bogs down among the mire of them.  His idea of neglected vampires among cold-hearted humans has considerable brilliance, but after a while we realize the film stops there, just showing the vision which is initially intriguing, but soon losing steam.
Virtually a vampire version of James Caan film ""Alien Nation,"" the charm of the film should have come from the cast.  Adrain Paul is good as a creepy (but not evil) vampire with a slight tinge of young Christopher Lee, but Woodbine is miscast, utterly discrediting the power of the story.  But compared with misguided use of Bai Ling, whose acting is confined within a heavy make-up, it is nothing.  It is not until we come to the end of the film that we see bit of her acting skill that made her name in ""Red Corner.""  Perhaps, they wanted to take her as an exotic beauty whose only function is to decorate the screen.  Mistake.",1030492800,11,2135,4.797814207650274
1647144,3,B00005QAR8,"I, like so many others, was loathe to see another Anne Rice-esque vampire movie. And add to that the teen vampire flick. I wanted to see something sophisticated--a movie that dealt with vampires in a compelling manner as befitting the wealth of paradoxes these characters can provide. The Breed looked like it might fit the bill.
It fell just a little short. The atmosphere is wonderful; it was rich and lush in a very dark and sensual way. And the story has possibilities. But something about the whole thing is unconvincing. It moves too quickly, giving the viewer little time to care, and the action doesn't justify the pace.
The one touch of emotion, the one character that brings out feeling, is the vampire detective as played by Adrian Paul. He brings out the paradoxes I mentioned earlier more completely then any other character in the film. (And it also helps that he has the dark, charismatic sensuality that brings vampires to mind.) His performance in a particular scene towards the end redeemed, to an extent, the rest of the film and alleviated some of the disappointment I felt towards it.
If they had slowed the movie down, developed some of the ideas more grandly, and gave Paul more screen time this would have been a very solid vampire/noir film.",1019347200,,1266,4.759090909090909

If you do not know the whole story about the mad science going on by the Nazis, here are the basics: The Nazis were obsessed with the idea of breeding a race of Aryan pure people: Blond hair, blue eyes, totally of German descent.

What you see in this movie is an echo of that breeding program, brought up to more modern times. Only the breeding program has to do with making vampires acceptable in human society.

7950104,4,B00005QAR8,"In this movie we have vampire and human cops working together in a ""blended society"".  Bokeem Woodbine, a favored actor of mine, plays Detective Steve Grant and Adrian Paul plays Aaron Gray, Vampire PD(?).

This cohesive society is shattered when it seems that a vampire goes rogue and begins killing indiscriminately.  Grant's human partner is one of the victims leading Grant to want to find the killer.

Bai Ling, as Lucy Westenra, is saddled with some of the UGLIEST costumes ever.  Costume designer &Eacute;va Vass (as Vasseva) should be keelhauled... several times... daily... for a week.

This is a movie not to be taken seriously.  The acting is kind of rough and the special effects occasionally border on ridiculous.  Even so, I really enjoyed watching this movie with a twist.
