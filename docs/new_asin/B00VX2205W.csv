7113159,5,B00VX2205W,"Howling II continues on from Joe Dante's classic the Howling
i've only seen Howling II once on DVD over 10 years ago now
from what i remember pretty stupid plot
Karen white (Dee wallace) from the original Howling
after Karen transforms into a werewolf on TV and then is shot dead, and then the end credits come up
Karen's brother Ben ( Reb brown) seeks revenge and goes to Transylvania to battle & Destroy Stirba (sybil Danning)
Stirba is the Queen of the werewolves in Transylvania
very very ridiculous plot obviously
well this sequel is now on blu-ray with a new  1:85:1 HD transfer courtesy of scream factory
this would be my 2nd time watching the film considering it's pretty bad sequel in terms of the storyline & Acting
this time i'm watching it on blu-ray and the picture quality is not bad, it's very good nice sharp & clear quality
much better than the old MGM dvd for sure
there's no 5.1 master audio mix, only master audio stereo mix
ofcourse being a scream factory blu-ray there's new special features, the old MGM DVD had no extras just a Theatrical trailer
QUEEN OF THE WEREWOLVES- new interview with Actress/model Sybil Danning - 15mins
LEADING MAN new interview with Actor Reb brown -15min
A MONKEY PHASE, a new featurette about the special effects make up in the film
interviews with Steve Johnson & scott wheeler -15mins
there's also new behind the scenes footage - on the set footage from 1984- only goes for 5mins
there's also an alternate beginning scene just after the intro credits start the film
and also an alternate ending scene aswell
NEW AUDIO COMMENTARIES- 2 commentaries just for this blu-ray release
1st commentary is with Michael Fleisher & Director Phillipe Mora
Phillipe's commentary is very informative, talks about getting Christopher lee, Sybil Danning, Production difficulties etc
Phillipe says Christopher only acted in the film was because he wanted to worth with Phillipe again
so worth listening commentary for sure
2nd commentary is with Music composer Steve parsons & Editor Charles bornstein
some of this commentary is alright, the Director's commentary is more informative of course
plus the usual Theatrical trailer, TV spots, Stills Photo Gallery

personally i didn't think much of this sequel that's why i've once seen it once
Joe Dante's Howling is the best of course
but if you're big fan, time to upgrade for sure gets this blu-ray version, time to throw out the old dvd version
maybe 2-3stars for the film itself, 5 stars for this blu-ray version based on new HD transfer & new special features",1437523200,12,2547,4.852873563218391
7113160,4,B00VX2205W,"This great campy B follow up to the Howling is nothing more then mindless entertainment but a lot of fun. I see negative reviews because people are trying to watch this as a serious werewolf film like its predecessor, but that's where the mistake is made. Don't expect the same tone and seriousness of the original. If you go in watching this with a MSK3000 mind set, you're going to have a great viewing experience. It's the so bad it's good category with a lot of unique touches added. One being of course the great Christopher Lee who try's so hard to turn the film into serious fodder but just adds to campiness unintentionally. Then there is the queen of werewolves herself, Sybil Danning, who has no acting ability but the body of a goddess, prancing around nude while sporting werewolf hair. Of course, there are countless werewolves that are not very scary but cool to look at non the less. All of this plus a soundtrack so awesome that Sybil Danning has to continually rip off her shirt to the beat of it during the closing credits. It could be the best closing credits in a horror film ever!!!
Note For The Scream Factory Blu Ray:
Pic quality excellent for the most part. Some of the scenes where Stirba uses her sorceress powers could have been enhanced a little more for more vibrant color but that's about the only complaint.
Some great current interviews with Sybil and Reb plus the guys that did the werewolf effects.
Comm with the director and the special effects guys.
And my fav, a reversible cover that has the title Stirba-Werewolf Bitch title!",1436832000,13,1564,4.60931899641577

7113162,5,B00VX2205W,"Okay, let's get it out of the way right away - this is NOT The Howling.  This is it's own animal.  The original Howling is a masterful work of werewolf moviemaking.  This is like it's redheaded stepchild.  It's kind of ugly, a little meaty, but if you let yourself get to know it, you just might have a fun time!  It also makes for a fun drinking game if you do a shot every time there's bad acting, bad dialogue or someone is naked (okay, you'd likely get alcohol poisoning if you do all of those, so maybe pick just one...)  In all seriousness, this is a fun little flick if you don't take it too seriously.",1461801600,3,609,4.162393162393163
7113163,4,B00VX2205W,"The first howling movie was a classic horror film.  This one was a huge drop in quality from that one. That one was a serious and well made film, this one is a real b movie with a ton more silliness.  It had a limited release and then went straight to video release.  Still , it had a release somewhere , which the later installments didn't have.  It's a fun romp and it was filmed in europe at least. At the time the commies still ran Romania , although in 1989 the Romanian dictator and his wife were shot to death by freedom fighters. This blu ray is the best this film has looked since the early 80's.  This is no classic though , it is just a low budget werewolf movie but it is a fun one. WIth the awesome sybil danning stealing the show!  A man runs into sexy werewolves in romania and then the wildness begins.  The title song in this movie is a really cool song though. A true horror song that just rocks.  That's a plus as well.",1461369600,5,938,4.087431693989071
7113164,1,B00VX2205W,"You know when Christopher Lee apologizes to a director about being in a movie, that movie carries some serious bad juju.  Howling II is the epitome of a crappy movie from beginning to end.

7113165,3,B00VX2205W,"Though this bizarre sequel is notoriously awful, it does have a fine HD transfer and the Blu-ray has several interesting extras and a commentary track from director Phillippe Mora.",1450137600,,180,5.241379310344827
7113166,4,B00VX2205W,Shout Factory does a very good job rescuing forgotten films in need of a special edition. Howling II is a good example of a minor horror picture that needed a commentary and extras.,1447718400,,181,4.515151515151516
7113167,5,B00VX2205W,great  sequal to first one . excellent picture and sound .,1445385600,,58,4.2727272727272725
7113168,1,B00VX2205W,"In werewolf-centric cinema, ""The Howling"" is one of the classics -- a moody, ultimately tragic tale of a young woman slowly overtaken by her lycanthropic dark side.

So of course, they had to make sequels.  Horrible, brain-melting sequels.

And the first of these was the comically-named ""Howling II - Your Sister Is a Werewolf,"" which is all the more tragic because it actually has some promise as a concept. Also, it had horror god Christopher Lee. Unfortunately, Lee's dignified performance turns out to be the only good thing in this messy, incoherent, disgusting mess of bad makeup and bizarre editing, which is scripted more like a vampire movie than a werewolf movie. Since when was a stake through the heart the best way to kill a werewolf?

It takes place shortly after the events of the first movie, with Ben White (Reb Brown) attending his late sister's funeral (and no, they weren't able to get Dee Wallace back for a cameo). After the funeral, he is approached by the mysterious Stefan Crosscoe (Lee), who informs him that his sister Karen was a werewolf. Naturally, Ben doesn't believe him, but Stefan shows him and journalist Annie (Jenny (McEnroe) a videotape of Karen's on-air transformation... and later they see Karen's werewolf self trying to break out of a coffin. It's fairly convincing.

So the two of them join Stefan's crusade against werewolves, and particularly against the evil werewolf queen Stirba, who... um, is someone they have a reason to hunt down and kill. So they travel to Transylvania -- well-known for its connection to WEREWOLF lore -- and soon discover that the place is crawling with evil werewolves. Even Stefan's expertise may not be enough to keep them from getting killed, especially when Annie (like all token annoying love interests) gets captured.

I wish that I could say that ""Howling II - Your Sister Is a Werewolf"" was just a stinker of a sequel, as if it were merely one of the many dreadful horror sequels like ""Sinister 2,"" ""Poltergeist 3"" or ""Lost Boys: The Tribe."" But no, it isn't. It's a stinker of a sequel of EPIC PROPORTIONS, taking everything that was intense and powerful in the original ""Howling"" and turning it into a cheap B-movie with (from the look of it) about one-tenth of the budget, minus 95% of the plot, and with about twenty times the naked boobs.

For one thing... ""Howling II"" is more like a vampire movie than a werewolf movie. Trips to Transylvania, heart-staking, garlic and ""re-killing"" the werewolves locked in their coffins.... because apparently werewolves are now undead. Also, werewolves worship the devil and have totally random orgies. Yeah.

But aside from the absurd storytelling, the technical aspects of the movie are also pretty dreadful -- the editing is painfully choppy, often intercutting blatantly to random shots of crucifixes, skeletons and other things. The action tends towards the bizarre, with lots of shotguns blasting and the occasional hand grenade. There are also many weird, sometimes grotesque scenes that add nothing to the plot -- consider a disgusting scene late in the movie where a priest is rather, um, graphically murdered by a gross little monster.

And the special effects are comically bad. The werewolves look like hirsute humans with bad teeth, and are almost never seen attacking anyone (except for close-ups of a hairy glove or plastic fangs). Typically, fully-transformed werewolves are represented by waving fur-gloved arms from somewhere just off screen

So what is the ONLY good thing about this movie? Horror legend Christopher Lee, who overshadows the wooden Brown and forgettable McEnroe with his powerful presence, deep voice and air of authority. Sure there's a silly scene where Lee goes undercover at a rave club and wear sunglasses indoors (while looking painfully aware of how awful this is), but he also has the one spectacularly awesome scene in the entire film: he kills a werewolf with a holy hand grenade!

It's a shame that the movie is so dreadful, because Shout! did a pretty good job presenting it on blu-ray, with alternate openings and closings, behind-the-scenes footage, interviews with actors Reb Brown and Sybil Danning, details on the makeup people, and two audio commentaries.

Even as a guilty pleasure, ""Howling II: Your Sister is a Werewolf"" is a bizarre, messy sequel whose only real good point is (of course) the inestimable Christopher Lee... who later apologized for starring in it. If you watch it, be sure you have alcohol and a bunch of snarky friends handy.",1444521600,,4525,4.99468791500664
7113169,5,B00VX2205W,"Shout Factory delivers for horror fans again with their release of this obscure yet very memorable werewolf movie from the 80's. The first ""Howling"" is typically remembered as one of the greatest werewolf movies ever made. The second is what is typically referred to as a cult classic as it appeals to a certain audience. Seeing horror icon Christopher Lee battling an army of werewolves led by Cybil Danning in Transylvania is worth the ticket price alone. The fun 80's visuals and soundtrack are also worth checking out. The Blu Ray itself is terrific and loaded with interesting interviews, as is usually the case with Shout Factory releases.",1443571200,4,645,4.981481481481482

Well....its marvelous in the total opposite way. Even the mighty Christopher Lee was said to feel terrible uncomfortable with the acting. Props are terrible, costumes are terrible, acting is terrible....but, in a Troll 2 way, its incredibly enjoyable. The greatest talent (other than Mr Lee) is the house band and the title song (which they play over and over and over). Sybil Danning adds a couple of golden globes to the final mix, too.
