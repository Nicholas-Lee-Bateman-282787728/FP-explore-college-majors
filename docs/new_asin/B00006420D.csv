1699827,5,B00006420D,"(Portuguese Language) The Devil's Backbone traz novo flego para o gnero horror, que encontrava-se em franca decadncia graas a fiascos recentes como Resident Evil e a srie Pnico. Parecia que aquelas velhas e empoeiradas estrias de terror que realmente assustavam e envolviam estavam extintas mas coube a The Devil's Backbone, um filme espanhol com pequeno oramento, resgatar toda a dignidade perdida das produes de antigamente, revelando o talento do diretor Guillermo Del Toro, que surge como um cineasta bastante original e criativo. O filme narra as desventuras do menino Carlos, que na dcada de 30, durante a guerra espanhola,  mandado para um orfanato situado no meio do quente deserto, sob os cuidados de Carmen (Marisa Paredes),uma professora amarga que perdeu uma das pernas e Casares, o bondoso e camarada diretor do estabelecimento. L ele tambm conhecer os outros garotos, e o revoltado e odioso Jacinto, um rapaz de seus 30-35 anos que cresceu no orfanato e que nutre um grande dio pelo local e pelas pessoas que o criaram. Depois de algumas noites, carlos sentir a presena sobrenatural de Santi, um garotinho que desapareceu estranhamente na mesma noite em que uma gigantesca bomba caiu no ptio do orfanato, sem explodir. Os meninos criaram vrias teorias para explicar o que houve com Santi, mas, aos poucos, a verdade ir revelando-se, claro que com a ajuda do esprito do garoto, que quer se vingar do responsvel pela sua morte. Embora o fantasma de Santi exera uma funo importantssima na trama, este  apenas o pano-de fundo para a narrativa maior, que envolve amores no correspondidos, ambio, o ardiloso Jacinto e uma fortuna em ouro escondida no local. Com uma fotografia perfeita, Del Toro transporta a platia para a dcada de 30, trazendo todo o desespero da guerra visto atravs dos olhos de crianas confinadas em um orfanato amarelado, sujo e empoeirado. O deserto  mostrado em tons pastis de forma to maestral que voc quase  capaz de sentir o calor do lugar. As atuaes so perfeitas, maravilhosas, todos esto no mesmo nvel, Marisa Paredes d uma performance marcante como a carente Carmen, Eduardo Noriega brilha como o malvado Jacinto. O filme, apesar de trazer um tom sobrenatural, mais um drama psicolgico, pessimista e muito, muito triste, que certamente consagra-se como um dos dez melhores filmes de 2001.",1027123200,,2325,5.06266318537859
1699828,4,B00006420D,"""The Devil's Backbone"" is a ghost story, but it is also much more.  Set during the Spanish Civil War, the story chronicles the happenings in an isolated school for orphaned boys.  The school admininstration consists of just a few characters, which makes the school seem even spookier and alienating.  In the background, the war moves closer to the school, creating additional horrors.  A new boy, Carlos, arrives and he begins seeing a ghost.  These scenes are very chilling and well-directed, but not really scary per se.  As the action progresses, it becomes clear that the ghost is not the only evil in the school.  The plot is well-written and has some great plot twists.  The actors are all terrific, with the kids putting in some impressive work in difficult roles.  I really enjoyed this movie and highly recommend it for fans of psychological horror films, such as ""The Others.""",1026518400,14,886,4.89261744966443
1699829,5,B00006420D,"Ok so its subtitled but there are many scenes in silence where u don't have to read. Dont misunderstand this movie, it isn't a horror movie, but is frightening. The children acted to the MAX. these little guys can whoop some of our famous older actors.  . i would say they should remake this in English but it might ruin it. So get it. I don't think i have ever seen such a raw, outright treatment of children like this. SHOCKING and BRILLIANT",1025827200,2,443,4.337349397590361
1699830,5,B00006420D,"THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE is a visually elegant, beautifully photographed, seamlessly written and directed tale of ghosts.  As the film's narrator explains, ghosts are bad deeds that never go away, are like faded photographs that will always reappear. The setting is a lonely, wastelands school for boys placed there by parents for protection during the Spanish Civil War.  What these boys experience and uncover becomes a child's view of how adults react to evil.  The performances are universally sensitive and fine.  Comparisons to the ghost stories of Henry James are inevitable, but this beautifully produced movie goes beyond a simple story and somehow manages to find that duende of Spanish creativity which makes it uniquely mesmerizing.",1025654400,9,740,5.408695652173913
1699831,4,B00006420D,"A stylish, atmospheric ghost story which, unlike so many recent examples of the genre, does not rely on any climactic twist for its punch.  The chills and thrills are happily much more old-fashioned here, and quite a bit more bloodthirsty.  The performances are universally excellent, and the music, cinematography, direction and visual effects are all first rate (the ghostly rendering of Santi - the ""one who sighs"" - is exceptionally good).  Writer/director Guillermo Del Toro's screenplay is in an entirely different league to his 'Cronos' and 'Mimic'.  Sure, it has a similar level of tension and fascination, but there's a much stronger thematic vein at work here.  Viewers familiar with the history and politics of the Spanish Civil War will find it particularly rewarding, appreciating the story on a deeper metaphorical level.  Others will just admire and enjoy this film for what it superficially is: a slick, good-looking and remarkably unsettling piece.",1024704000,5,965,5.315789473684211
1699832,4,B00006420D,"I saw this in the theater a few months ago and loved it.  It is one of the best ghost story horrors I have ever seen in that it doesn't become any less engaging or scary once the ghost's motivations are explained.  I found it to straddle the line between ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""High Plains Drifter"" while being it's own wonderful story about life and love during the Spanish Civil War.",1019779200,3,385,4.333333333333333
1699833,5,B00006420D,This film is one of the best films I've ever see in years apart from LOTR of course. The plot is very interesting and will keep you gript to the film. Also it's atmosphere is a very calm and has a mellow surrounding that makes this a great film to watch. I've already seen the film because it was release in England before the US. The only disappointment is the other releases section on the dvd which is all black and white films. This disappointment makes the film look out of date. And in my opinion this section should have been left out of the release. Other than that the film is a good purchase and should be in everyone's dvd collection.,1019520000,,645,4.295081967213115

1699915,4,B00006420D,"I was living in Spain when this came out, and it's extremely well done.  Federico Luppi, Marisa Paredes, and Eduardo Noriega each give some of their best acting. The characters are strong and believable.  Not for the faint of heart, and although it is set during the Spanish Civil War it is not a film about the conflict; for that there are others.  This is horror/thriller, drama.",1499385600,,381,4.656716417910448
1699916,5,B00006420D,"An excellent film and yes, it's worth dealing with the subtitles which is what I usually want to know when sorting through the international streaming offers.

Guillermo del Toro is one of my favorite film directors.",1488585600,,274,4.288461538461538
1699922,5,B00006420D,"I am so happy with my purchase. The disc and cover had no marks or scratches, the delivery was fast, and everything went very well during this process.

(This movie is in Spanish, so there are SUBTITLES) I expected this movie to be scary, but I found it to be just so unique, but not scary at all. Guillermo del Toro (master behind The Strain series books and television show, Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy 1, 2, and many more) created a small world in this orphanage where something terrible happened. The main boy is traumatized by this horrible ghostly appearance, but wants to figure out what is happening and why he's being haunted by the ghost of this other boy. The main boy actor as well as all the adults were superb and I'd have to say that this one can be added to the list of del Toro's man accomplishments in filming, writing, and everything else that he does! Great movie.",1487030400,3,881,4.472049689440993

1699978,4,B00006420D,"Devil's Backbone is easily my favorite Del Toro film. It is quiet similar to Pan's Labryinth in many ways, but stands as more of a horror film instead of a dark fantasy. It also has a young main protagonist and takes place during the Spanish Civil War. However, the supernatural elements in the Devil's Backbone cannot be explained away by imagination.

This movie is not scary, but it is horrific. It has a lower budget than all of his other moviers. I found I liked the characters a lot, the plot was strong, the acting was pretty decent for the young actors too. It was well worth the $4 amazon rental charge.",1478390400,6,612,4.464285714285714

1700032,3,B00006420D,"I purchased THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE because I had enjoyed the similarly plotted Thai film, DORM, which may or may not have been based on this better known Del Toro movie. Because THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE is also available in a Criterion Edition, I figured it would be at least the equal of DORM. Sad to say, the Thai film is superior.
There are many aspects of BACKBONE that lack credibility, some of which Del Toro himself confesses to in his commentary, such as the ludicrously gigantic unexploded bomb sticking out of the center of the orphanage's courtyard. This facility is located in the middle of nowhere. Even accepting the projectile's size, why drop it here? Then there's the basement's cistern which at times is swarming with slugs the size of rats, and at other times is completely devoid of the creatures. Some special effects go awry, such as the makeshift spear into an arm that mushes like it belongs to Miss Piggy instead of that of the movie's villain. I could go on (scarves blowing in the wind, deformed aborted fetuses, impotent lovers), but it's plain there's a lot of allegorical nonsense here that's just distracting.
The acting is universally excellent, even the youngsters. But there is not the emotional connection that DORM inspires. For instance, it would have been nice to know why Noriega's completely soulless villain became a monster while all the other orphans raised there seem fairly normal. It certainly had nothing to do with his appearance, because Noriega is a piece of eye-candy.
So watch this for the suspense, for the acting, and because it's an original take on symbolism. Just be prepared to get hit over the head with it.",1458691200,4,1660,4.848591549295775

I'm sure that it's probably a 4 or 5 star movie, but how are you to know, when you cannot understand what they're saying? It's really upsetting, as you're not told until you've rented or purchased the movie, and by that time they already have your money. This has happened to me twice in the past couple of nights and it's really disappointing.
Again, the language that the movie uses, ie; French, Spanish, English, etc. SHOULD BE STATED ON THE EXPLANATION OF THE MOVIE, BEFORE IT IS RENTED OR PURCHASED. It's a rip-off!!

To me, this film suffers from a lack of interesting plot, laughable interaction amongst the characters and a mediocre and conventional approach to a ghost story. To me, there was absolutely nothing interesting or ""frightening"" about the ghost and the 'ambiance' was typical fare. The story concerns a child who is left at an orphanage in the middle of the desert in Spain during the Spanish Civil War and instead of analyzing his soul, which one would hope would happen, considering this is a foreign movie, we are merely given cliched storylines like ""the ghost is here for a reason,"" or ""there's a ghost in this building,"" and its really all empty. Nowhere do we get to understand the nature of the inner dimensions of the characters.

There is the typical mean kid bully, the nice teacher and then the sexual young man who is having sex with the older matriarch in one of the most brainless events in the film. Most of the effects were done with a computer and that takes away any imagination. The war planes flying above, the explosion in the rectory and even the ghost itself were ""enhanced"" with digital imaging and it further ruins this attempt at life so we are basically left with a modicum of interest.

What is lacking is something inherently interesting, or movable, so there is a ghost, so what? What does he mean to us? By the end, we are numbed by the excessive and irrelevant use of violence from one of the characters. It all fails in the end when this becomes just another good vs bad soap opera in the world film. The only commendable part was the beginning and the end, where the teacher is contemplating the nature of what a ghost is, other than that, this is blantantly unintelligent.

I don't know why I watched this movie because it was presented to me as a ghost story and I'm not a big fan of ghost stories. I trusted the person who recommended it and decided to give it a try. I thought I would start the movie and watch a little and then finish it up the next day, but I wound up being drawn into the movie and stayed up late to finish it. To say now that this movie is a ""ghost story"" is really doing it a disservice, in my opinion, because the movie is about a lot more than ghosts. What I reacted to most here were the various story lines and the characters and the fact that I was watching a horror movie that was scary, but not because of monsters. Well, at least not the non-human kind of monster.

The movie takes place in the mid-1930's during the Spanish Civil War. The story starts when a boy is dropped off at an orphanage and the plot follows his subsequent meeting and relationships with the other boys, his teachers, the school's workers, a bomb and a ghost. His first meeting with the other boys, and their developing relationships are nothing we haven't seen in other movies, but I thought it was handled with more passion and sensitivity here than I'm used to seeing. These kids weren't stereotypes or cardboard cutouts, they were complex and multi-dimensional and real, as were the adult characters.

The Devil's Backbone is well directed with an atmosphere that is enthralling and it's also very pretty to look at. The actors, all of them, turned in what I thought were excellent performances. The story is complex enough to be interesting throughout and leaves you thinking about it after you've finished watching. I could easily watch this movie again and I think I would enjoy it just as much the second time. In all honesty, I really can't think of anything negative to say about this movie which is pretty odd for me because I can usually find something to pick on. About the only negative I can think of has nothing to do with the movie, but with people who will be disappointed with this movie because they will compare it with Hollywood's version of horror and because of that they won't enjoy it.

I easily rate this five stars and highly recommended to anyone who's looking for a good movie, whether it's a drama, a mystery, a coming of age story, revenge story, or even a ghost story. In Spanish with English subtitles.

But such was the instant atmosphere of dread and immediate intrigue conjured up by director Guillermo del Toro, that I was transfixed, clutching a cushion ever tighter and at times too engrossed to breath. This for me is the best way to watch any movie - suddenly without warning, without any pre-concieved ideas. I didn't learn the title of the movie until hours after I my spine had been expertly tingled by this chilling cinematic invader in my living room.
It is simply a ghost story - a haunting, foreboding tale of innocence coupled with curiosity that can lead to only one outcome.  The story unfolds in an orphanage during the spanish civil war. The central character is Carlos, a young boy who has been placed at the orphanage, for reasons unknown, by his parents. Soon after arrival Carlos begins to have visions of a ghostly apparition, and learns of another boy called Santi who disappeared a short time before Carlos arrived. Carlos has the distinct privilege of having to sleep in the missing boys dormitory bed - no surprise then that the ghostly presence begins to coerce Carlos into investigating, at great peril to himself, exactly what happened to the unfortunate youngster. The movie sweeps along at exactly the right pace, against a backdrop of political upheaval surrounding the school, including in the unusual mix, an investigation of an unexploded bomb right in the center of the school courtyard, an ever menacing presence that seems somehow related to the mystery and intrigue of the ghostly orphan. There are many incredible dramatic back stories here too - enough to keep the keenest cinema lover interested. This is a really great psychological thriller that never loses pace.

This is a ghost story that sort of crawls along slowly, but gets better as it goes along.  I would put this movie into the same mold as such movies as The Others (2001), The Sixth Sense (1999), and The Innocents (1961).

Set against the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War there are obvious parallels between the tyranny of the orphanage caretaker over the boys and the struggle of their nation against fascism. The imagery, especially the ever-present unexploded bomb in the isolated orphanage yard, lends a poetic poignancy to the boys' plight.

I remembered that it was a ghost story and that's it.
Ok...

The good?
If you like slow burner ghost stories like ""The Others"" than you'll like this movie.
It's less a ghost story and more a war story but it's so well told, acted, directed etc...that trying to pidgeon hole the movie into one genre really doesn't do it justice.
The pacing is spot on.
The score is excellent.
The casting is perfect.
One of the best ""ghost"" stories I've ever seen.

The bad?
Nothing.
If you're expecting a slasher movie look elsewhere.
This movie is slow, deliberate and very effective at what it sets out to do....tell a good story.
And tell a good story it does.
Yes, it's subtitled, but please don't let that scare you away (no pun intended).

These films are all so well filmed, very rich & lush to look at, well written & the perfect amount of creep factor. The acting is excellent. None of them in particular have a happy ending, which doesn't always go over that well w/American audiences, although Pan's Labyrinth won multiple awards.

Devil's Backbone's main character is a boy, left in an orphanage, in what appears to be 40's wartime era in Spain. Pan's Labyrinth was also set in Spain around the same time, so I incorrectly assumed Guillermo was Spanish. He was actually born in Guadalajara, Jalisco Mexico. You'd think he was born & grew up in Spain having seen his movies. Devil's Backbone may start out slow for some but as most of his films, he sets the mood & the background. There is also the element of fantasy or supernatural, as in his other films. I was glued to the end of my seat during the whole film. The ending was very disturbing indeed & was very well done.

And while The Devil's Backbone has many elements of a horror film, it does not at all play out like a horror film.  That in and of itself is not necessarily a negative but it begs the question of why this film has won such accolades as being on more prominent horror lists such as Bravo's ""100 Scariest Movie Moments"" and Fangoria's ""101 Best Horror Movies You've Never Seen"".

I have a tremendous amount of respect for Guillermo Del Toro and the film is certainly up to par with his production, style, attention to detail, and paced storytelling.  Yet, as I sat there and the credits started to roll at the end I couldn't help but feel disappointed.  Is that all?  The film just doesn't grab me like I had so fervently hoped.  It relies almost exclusively on dramatic rather than horrific or fantastical elements and so it comes off as a 1920's darker version of ""Stand By Me"".

While the acting is all very good and the ghost looks very unique, the film presents nothing all that arresting or memorable in my opinion.  It is not often I find a film that I can praise in so many technical ways but still feel that it fails to achieve its end.  If this were marketed as a supernatural drama, I don't think I would have any room to criticize.  However, the film is lauded as a masterpiece of horror - even here on Amazon, look at all the great reviews.  (I'm sure this minuscule review will be buried deep in the latter pages.)  A masterpiece of horror?  I just don't see it.  And please believe me, I sincerely tried - I sincerely wanted to.

I fear that for many horror aficionados, this film leaves a lot to be desired in terms of tension, scares, interest, or violence.  It was on those levels that I think this movie failed to live up to its hype.  Although not entirely not enjoyable,  it is quickly forgettable and not one I will trot out when friends drop by to see something truly scary - because this film is anything but.

1700784,5,B00006420D,"Years before his Oscar-winning PAN'S LABYRINTH, Guillermo del Toro struck international success with his smaller but equally impressive THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE. Del Toro's third entry offers all of the same dark fantasy elements present in the later film without being as overstated. In the midst of a war-torn Spain, a small orphanage serves as the last refuge for a group of students and their rebel teachers. The young newcomer, Carlos, begins receiving ominous prophecies from the spirit of another boy who had gone missing. The being warns him that many of the students will soon be killed, but will their fate come at the hands of the war or the internal greed and strife found within their isolated retreat? Del Toro demonstrates more of his amazing visual style, combining rich color filters and backgrounds with fluid camera movements. The scares are all soft and subtle, with the true horror lying in the hearts of men rather than the supernatural (a common theme in each of his films). It is the evils of war, greed, disloyalty, and despair that are the most frightening. There are numerous ever-present dangers throughout the script that also lock the audience into a state of perpetual suspense: in addition to the whispered rumors of Santi, the ""one who sighs"", the fear of discovery as two of the characters engage in a secret affair is never out of mind, and a de-activated bomb that was dropped in the center of the courtyard serves as a constant reminder of the encroaching war. The significance of the title lies in superstitious beliefs and false hopes, themes that also engulf every aspect of the film. As Dr. Casares tells Carlos after Carlos approaches him about the ghost, to believe in ghosts is to believe in silly superstition; however, we soon find out that Dr. Casares, a man of science, places just as much faith in 'silly superstitions' by taking a magic elixir to try to cure his impotence. The roles of these superstitions are absolutely integral to the plot. Carlos must believe in the ghost of Santi in order to find the strength within himself to defeat the film's villain, just as Dr. Casares must drink the elixir in order to find the strength to continue on despite the impossible odds. The multi-layered themes and superior storytelling are only further accentuated by the outstanding performances found in a winning cast. THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE rivals Guillermo del Toro's masterful work in PAN's LABYRINTH, and is considered by many to be his defining work. It is an immediate Horror classic, and a must see for every fan.

1700785,5,B00006420D,"Guillermo De Toro proves with this poetic masterpiece that he is not some neo baroque surrealist with a few uncanny, Dali like tricks up his sleeve.  Certainly not. ""The Devil's Backbone"" is less of a horror film (perhaps the only real ""monster"" in the film is Noriega's janitor, a depraved brute and fuse for the flame of nearly everyone's destruction) than a meditation on human pain and mortality.

The film is set in the final days of Spanish Civil War.  Carlitos, a pre-pubescent boy abandoned by his family in the enroaching chaos, is placed in an impoverished Catholic orphanage run by a steely aging Spanish woman/war victim with a synthetic leg adorned in steel and exquisitely laced leather. It reminds the viewer that even the most extravagant of humanity's material compensations cannot replace what has been lost as a result of our own bloodlust. An equally aged scientist who loves both poetry and the human body (even going so far as to preserve aborted foetuses in jars) serves as Carlito's mentor.

The boy experiences the abuse and alienation attendant upon being the new kid on the block and also discovers that he has the unfavorable position of sleeping in a supposedly haunted bed. It once gave shelter to Santi, the orphanage ghost.

The scenes in which we actually see Santi are alternately sedate and occasionally terrifying, but in terms of his supernatural intentions he is really no more threatening than Casper. Well, maybe a bit.  Tormo employs the concept of the ghost or apparition as more of a aesthetic/moral tool than anything else.  A ghost is kind of psychic tapestry, a stain in reality's wallpaper which must grow larger and large until it is noticed and given what it wants.  Jacinto himself is a kind of ghost.

Watch out for the bomb suspended in time, the objet d'art which gives this film a push from above average to great.  Not to be missed!",1262131200,2,1887,4.814241486068111
1700786,4,B00006420D,"Nice movie of privately funded orphanage and people there as horror and superstitious following.

1700787,3,B00006420D,"This film fits into a pattern by now readily recognisable from films directed or produced by Guillermo de Toro: a plot centred on the fears of a child, some mild, very low key horror (none of it remotely scary to a contemporary audience), beautiful cinematography but fairly average special effects, and a background setting of the Spanish Civil War, which allows the director to explore broader themes designed to give the films an air of profundity.

None of this would matter greatly if de Toro's Spanish Civil War films were chiefly marketed as wartime dramas with elements of fantasy and surrealism. Judged from this perspective, they are memorable and well made, although his black-and-white depiction of Nationalists (bad) and Republicans (good) is cliched and simplistic given what we know about the moral complexities of the conflict (from Orwell's Homage to Catalonia and other sources).

The real problem is that de Toro's films are marketed as horror films, which they are emphatically not.  As a result, audiences are lured into expecting edge-of-seat shocks and the general atmosphere of tension and surprise one expects from a good thriller. Assessed from this perspective, these films invariably under-deliver. The Devil's Backbone is too slow paced to work effectively as a thriller (I found my attention wandering on several occasions, despite watching the film alone).  Once the audience has been introduced to the ghost, Santi, there are few surprises left, as it is obvious that the plot is going to work its way to a denouement of retribution and revenge.  There are no plot twists to speak of, and I had already guessed the ending 20 minutes into the film. It's like an earlier version of the Orphanage, with a similar ""is that all there is?"" ambience to it.

I have tried to approach de Toro's work with an open mind, and generally am a big fan of European and Latin American directors.  However, I have been driven to conclude that this director is overrated, especially by critics of art film who seem to believe that any non-Hollywood film must by definition be of deeper significance - the same people who, for example, continue to insist that the Japanese original of ""The Ring"" was superior to the US re-make when it was, in fact, cliched, drably directed, and profoundly lacking in tension. In de Toro's case, there is a simple formula at work which typically involves a conventional, not particularly interesting, childhood ghost story set against the background of war to lend the film pretensions of artistic significance. Clearly a lot of arthouse critics have been seduced by this, but audience reactions have been noticeably more mixed.

Having been disappointed by Pan's Labyrinth and the Orphanage, neither of which could honestly be described as belonging to the ""thriller"" genre, I wanted to watch this film because it sounded interesting and because of the way it has been marketed as a spine chilling ghost story. But like the other films mentioned above, The Devil's Backbone doesn't deliver many shocks, and the points it has to make about war and its accompanying loss of childhood innocence are neither original nor profound.  The three stars are for the undoubtedly gorgeous cinematography which is the film's saving grace.

If you want to watch an accomplished recent childhood horror film, try ""The Orphan"" which, although far less weighty or pretentious in its themes, does deliver genuine shocks and tension, keeps you guessing to the end, and also contains a brilliant plot twist which forces you to re-consider the whole story in a new light.

We should perhaps remember that Hitchcock made some of his greatest films in Hollywood, and Hollywood still knows how to make efficient, nail biting thrillers that fulfil audience expectations. de Toro may be an accomplished cinematographer, but Hitchcock or Claude Chabrol he certainly isn't.

If this verdict seems harsh, have a look at the sleeve notes of this DVD (which contain much marketing spiel about how it is going to scare the pants off you) and and then watch the film.  After you've done this, ask yourself whether the description of the film as a scary ghost story that will keep you on the edge of your seat is honest and truthful in light of what you have just seen.

As i mentioned, this film starts off quite interesting with a young boy being sent to an orphanage for boys. The kids share stories about a kid who used to live there and say he dissapeared and that he's apparently a ghost etc etc...Story goes on to reveal one of the carers is a bad guy etc blah blah blah

It's just not interesting enough to go on really. Some silly pointless story elements and overall, a long winded movie.

When you SEE the ghost-boy, it's just not as horrifying or intense as it is in the orphanage. It reveals too much too soon!

My girlfriend hated it, I pretty much hated it, and we will be trading it into blockbuster very soon I'm sure (and that's once we fish it out of the back of her wardrobe where it now resides!)

The story may work at an allegorical level for those familiar with the Spanish Civil War but, even for those without that knowledge, the characters are realistic and well-drawn enough to draw the viewer in.

1700837,5,B00006420D,"Guillermo del Toro is currently known as the guy who made the Oscar-winning ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" the ""Hellboy"" movies, and is going to direct ""The Hobbit.""

But way back in in 2001, del Toro made a movie that serves as a sport of ghost-story prequel to ""Pan's Labyrinth."" With its mysterious specter, innocent hero and a story set during a bloody civil war, ""The Devil's Backbone"" is a unique kind of horror movie -- it deftly sidesteps the cheap tricks and scares that most ghost stories employ.

Unaware that his father has been killed, Carlos (Fernando Tielve) thinks that he's being left at a remote orphanage only temporarily.

Kindly Dr. Casares (Federico Luppi) sympathizes with the lonely new boy, but Carlos soon is distracted from his troubles. He keeps seeing shadows, footprints and falling pitchers -- and when he wanders down into the vaulted cellar, he catches a glimpse of a silent ghost with a bleeding head wound. Even worse, the ghost -- which was a boy named Santi -- informs him that many people there will die.

But the most dangerous one at the orphanage is the brutal former-orphan Jacinto (Eduardo Noriega), who is searching for a cache of hidden gold. As Carlos tries to figure out how Santi died -- and what angry, miserable Jaime (igo Garcs) has to do with it -- the orphanage is suddenly turned into an explosive war zone. As Dr. Casares tries to protect the remaining boys, Carlos discovers the reason Santi died -- and what he wants now.

""The Devil's Backbone"" is a movie filled with death: the orphanage is a dying institution in a time of war, filled with orphans and surrounded by sun-burnt grass. It even has a defused torpedo stuck right in the middle of the courtyard. By the time the ghost shows up, it seems like almost a natural part of such a ruined, quietly sorrowful place.

Fortunately Guillermo del Toro avoids cheap scares -- the ghost doesn't make weird noises or leap out at Carlos for no reason. Instead he evokes the fear of a child in a dark, creaky old house who is ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN that there's something out there. Also some beautifully creepy visuals, such as blood floating in the air as if it were in water.

But the whole creepy-ghostly-factor is eclipsed about halfway through the movie. After a slow buildup of tension, everything suddenly erupts when Jacinto suddenly reveals his true self. Suddenly we've got explosions, blood, shattered glass, mangled bodies and an all-too human enemy who is slowly closing in. It makes the ghostly Santi seem suddenly very... nonthreatening.

And though the plot seems simple, del Toro spins a spiderweb of interconnected hints and plot threads -- comic books, slug collections, a wooden leg and blood-tinged water all come into play. There's loads of symbolism, and the beautiful scenes (Dr. Casares' final poetry recital to Carmen) are handled just as powerfully as the more gory, ghastly ones (the orphans' final assault).

It's kind of amazing that this was Tielve's movie debut, because he's simply incredible -- his character slides through fear, courage, sorrow and confusion, all with a kind of unshakable innocence. Garcs is equally good; at first he seems like a mere bully, but we gradually see how troubled and guilty he feels over what happened to Santi. Noriega is thoroughly nasty  as a greedy, sociopathic thug who cares about nobody except himself (even his fiancee), while Luppi is a kindly, cultured old man who obviously loves the boys as if they were his own.

""The Devil's Backbone"" is a haunting kind of ghost story, where the ghost is not the scariest thing you'll see. A powerful, striking movie.",1225411200,2,3620,4.8508914100486225

I got a little riled by Del Toro's uneven depiction of history and the fact that history had anything to do with a ""fantasy"" film.  I gave it 3 stars because, besides the slanted history and despite its artistic qualities, I took great issue with the nebulous point of the story, proven by the common misinterpretations of its ""deeper"" meaning in the glowing amazon.com reviews.  Of course, I was out of my depth to think such things.  So, you think I would have learned my lesson?  No, I buy another Del Toro film staged in the Spanish Civil War; $5 or not, what was I thinking?!

Now you might wonder; ""Why did you give this film 4 stars and the other, more revered film only 3 stars?"" and that would be a fair question.  The answer is simple; I knew what to expect.  ""Pan's Labyrinth"" was marketed as a fantasy film but that was not what I got.  ""Devils Backbone"" was marketed as a ghost story.  However, I had the sense to read up on it and realize this was just deceptive American marketing.  I had learned my lesson... ...sort of.

-WE STUPID AMERICANS
We must all be idiots since Del Toro's films are much too deep for us to understand here in America.  The distributors ""understand"" this.  So, when they package these DVD's they feel compelled to compare the films to something we can identify with like ""The Others"" or ""Lord of the Rings""; just ridiculous.  Of course, neither of those two films remotely resembles the two Del Toro films they were compared to.  This film is nothing like ""The Others"" and, luckily, I did not expect it to be.  I do enjoy that story more though.

-WHAT DO I HAVE AGAINST DEL TORO?
In a nutshell; I don't like his stories.  I like his skill as a Director.  I think he makes some of the more visually stunning films of the day.  The guy is dripping with style.  But, I don't like his stories.  If he never did anything but direct other people's stories, I'd be happy to watch.  However, his stories just bug me.  It bugs me that he can't show war without taking sides.  It bugs me that his stories pretentiously try to be ""deep"" and ambiguous to the point that even those who love them don't truly understand them.  I recently viewed Fritz Lang's ""M"".  In an interview, Lang said ""I hate giving interviews... ...because if a director has to explain his film then he hasn't done his job"".  I could not agree more.  Good stories practically tell themselves.  Does the meaning need to be deciphered?  I have ideas about ""The Devils Backbone"" but Lord knows if I'm right.  There may be nothing to interpret at all.  So, I just look at it as a story about an orphanage in the middle of the desert with a tormented ghost and ruined people lurking about.  It's not bad at being that.

-THESE KIDS CAN ACT
Despite my bellyaching, there were things that I liked about this film.  Being set in an old orphanage, there needs to be kids.  Well this is a boy's orphanage and can these boys act.  You need to give the director credit here.  They're a bunch full of character and are easy to care about.  All the actors did pretty well and their characters were fairly well developed.  However, I have to say the heavy in the film was a bit extreme.  I wasn't surprised by this since the villain in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" was also nearly unimaginable in his cruelty.

-NOT A HORROR FILM
This is not news to anyone who's read a review for this before, but I thought I should make sure you knew.  There is brutal violence, a bloody ghost, and evil people but this is much less a horror film than ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is.  The most horrific thing about this film is the constant depiction of highly flawed people.  Even the ""Heroes"" have ugly sides.  This is actually a pretty depressing film now that I think about it.

-THE FINAL JUDGMENT
I liked the acting and the characters.  I thought it was visually excellent.  I thought the story was ok until it got to the point.  It was ""the point"" that was either heavy handed or too subtle; I admit I'm not sure which.  I might be looking for something that's not even there.  Either way, it was the details that made it interesting and not the overall ""message"".  Of course, history being one of my interests, the slanted depiction of the Spanish Civil War gave me heartburn as well.  However, it did everything else so well that I have to give it 4 stars even if I did not like the story.

This movie is multi-layered, a visual feast, nothing corny here. But it is not for children!

This is not a horror film, but a coming of age story, portraying with compassionate understanding the tribally violent yet innocent world of childhood. Lust, greed, mystery, ghosts, and friendship are all explored with a deft touch. It's an tragic ugly-beautiful picture.

I was alot like you at first, skeptical of this movie. It's often listed on different lists as superb, amazing, scary as hell!

Well, I finally watched it and yes, for a matter of fact, it's all those things. Guillermo Del Toro is right up their with M. Night Shyamalan. Every movie he makes is a classic.

This movie has amazing characters, a great storyline and a good ending. The best part about Del Toro's movies is that he lures you in with the spooky stuff and mild horror and then unleashes a super story and makes it all tie in beautifully!

10 yr-old Carlos arrives at a Spanish school sheltering the orphans of the Republican militia only to discover it has many supernatural secrets.

My Review:

Albeit that Pan's Labyrinth did undoubtedly well, take it amongst yourselves to watch the first and second in Del Toro' magical trilogy. This second in a trilogy revolves around a group of boys and this time, an old-fashioned wartime ghost story. This not just because that dir. Del Toro's has a hovering and poignant ghost story to tell that harnesses more substance, 'jump-factor', and is executed with rather more style than the whole number of Hollywood' asinine lack lusting scare movies, but recent work for a major studio, working in Mimic, allowed Del Toro to refresh himself.

Our protagonist is a 10 yr-old Carlos (Fernando Tielve) who doesn't take on being bullied so easily, even after being abandoned in the school by his fathers friend and picked on since day one, all those who remember starting a new school will connect and laugh with this young witty troublesome attraction and to his likable friends that refuse to boycott him. Del Toro manages to yet again swindle directing children to startling effect. No corny-ness, but with all the decent, funny and if not typical young-to-teenage boy idiosyncrasies, that range from comics, model cars and dirty pictures.

Providing the support and adult figures to some of the disobedient children, is headmistress Carmen (Marisa Paredes), whom isn't hard, demeaning or strict but reluctant to take on more kids, she's tough despite the effect the war has had on her. The likable Dr. Casares (Federico Luppi) who provides assistance and understanding to the boys and Carlos in particular when the vivid appearances of a school-boy ghost 'Santi' make claim. He is warm-hearted and passionate towards his job, and gets to defend its keep from a man Jacinto (Eduardo Noriega) who is a depressed ex-school boy whom now works at the school for pleasurable means to the headmistress and caretaker, who could easily be compared to Captain Vidal in Pan's Labyrinth. Even the local bully Jaime (igo Garcs) has deep roots towards the complex, but there is always a reason for being brute and far too familiar with local surroundings.

The Spanish language goes to find its deeper roots for a complex horror set in a school for orphaned boys during the Spanish Civil War. Some unaware of the deaths of family members. From the crisp start to finish Del Toro manages to unite all his divergent rudiments - horror and gold, fear and infidelity and politics and civil war - to amazement.

Verdict:

If indeed Pan's Labyrinth would be the proverbial Red Wine or Bordeaux, Devil's Backbone just happens to be the fine Scotch Whisky. 8.5/10.",1203724800,,2750,4.989082969432315

It is a great movie, beautifully acted, directed and filmed with a very believable and original story line. Not so scary per se, more intensely thrilling with a supernatural twist.

'The Devil's Backbone' is a story which involves ghosts, or the skeletons that one may have in their closet, and how that motivates our present actions and decisions. It is a memorable film which will make you think, more than it scares you, one worth watching time and again.

Like most people, I wasn't even aware of this movie until after I had watched Pan's Labyrinth. Once I did some research on Guillermo del Toro, I instantly knew that this was a must-see. Del toro has said that of all the movies he has directed, this is his personal favorite. He began writing the story when he was in college and all-together the film was in development for sixteen years. The part that interested me the most was that del Toro said that this and Pan's Labyrinth were designed to be sibling films, DB being the masculine ""brother"" film, and Labyrinth as the feminine ""sister"" film. Aside from the Spanish Revolution, the plots aren't very similar, but this film definitely has the same ""feel"" as Pan's Labyrinth. They are both richly atmospheric, violent, and somewhat sensual adult fantasies. If you enjoy one it's almost impossible not to enjoy the other. The DVD itself is also great with a really cool interactive menu and a wonderful commentary by del Toro himself. Highly recommended!

Excerpts from the director's notebook, storyboards, even the ubiquitous Making Of documentary all add more substance than the usual PR filler material. Of particular interest here is del Toro's commentary, which goes beyond the usual behind-the-scenes anecdotes to delve into the artistic and historical roots of the creative decisions he made in the film.

Set primarily at a remote orphanage in the waning days of the Spanish Civil War in 1939, the film is photographed beautifully using the backdrop of the desolate Spanish countryside.  The orphange harbors boys of high ranking members of the losing Republican cause. Reminders of the conflict are all around typified by an unexploded bomb buried nose first in the courtyard.  New boy Carlos played by Fernando Tielve is dumped there by his tutor and he immediately struggles to gain acceptance.

The orphanage is administered by compassionate headmistress Carmen played by Marisa Paredes and kindly Dr. Casares played by Federico Luppi.  Sympathetic to the Republican cause they sequester of a cadre of gold ingots to be used to finance the war effort.  Mean spirited Jacinto, played by Eduardo Noreiga, the young caretaker and former denizen of the orphanage only has aspirations to steal the gold bars, mistreating the children throughout the film.

Soon after his arrival, Carlos begins to be visited by the ghost of Santi, a young orphan who mysteriously disappeared during a bombing raid.  The ghost predicts in foreboding fashion of death.

1701010,5,B00006420D,"Guillermo del Toro is one of the most celebrated young writer-directors currently working in cinema and his ""Pan's Labyrinth"" was my favorite film of 2006.

If you enjoy classy ghost stories, you're not going to want to miss this gem.  Like ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" ""The Devils Backbone"" is set in Spain during the the civil war, and like that film its main protagonist is a child and, save for resplendent cinematography by Guillermo Navarro and evocative music by Javier Navarette, that's where the similarities end.

Sorrow thrives at Santa Lucia School.  There is indeed a ghost, but most of the residents are haunted by memories of happy families, exhausted passion and life before the war.  Marisa Paredes, the aging actress in Almodovar's ""All about My Mother,"" is captivating, Federico Luppi is moving, and Eduardo Noriega a beautiful, tortured villian.  This is cinema on a grand scale.

[Just as an aside, as the Harry Potter films get darker and darker, del Toro gets my vote to helm at least one of the remaining films.]",1177632000,4,1026,4.930232558139535
1701011,5,B00006420D,"Guillermo del Toro (who directed last years phenomenal Pan's Labyrinth) seems to be at his best when dealing with the paranormal; indeed, he has the uncommon gift of making the fantastic seem plausible. This film contains some of the most haunting and believable images I've seen on screen, and their efficacy was heightened by the director's understanding of when enough is enough. Ghost stories of any kind fail when the real or imagined ghost is absurdly presented. Most of today's contemporary ""Master's of Horror"" fail miserably.

It is 1939, and the Spanish Civil War is in its final days. Carmen and Doctor Casares run an orphanage for boys (one does wonder, why no girls?). The institution has a remarkable feature: in the middle of the courtyard is a bomb, the tip of which is embedded firmly in the ground. The bomb fell from the sky during a raid, but never exploded. It sits there, disarmed yet immovable, as a reminder of the violence in the outside world.

Carlos, a ten year old, is left at the orphanage, and though Carmen argues that they have no resources for more children, she accepts him and assigns him to bed number twelve, the bed that Santi slept in until the day he disappeared, which was the same day that the bomb fell from the sky. Carlos, predictably, begins to see visions and shadows, and at first, it isn't understood whether these come from his mind or if they are real. One night, a shadow tempts him from behind a bed curtain, and when Carlos pulls the curtain back, the shadow is gone. But the pitchers of water in the boys' room have fallen from their stands and break, and when the other children awaken, Carlos and Jaime each take a pitcher to refill in the kitchen. Carlos sees footprints in the spilled water. When the boys reach the kitchen, Jaime pumps water for his pitcher, and waits outside for Carlos. As Carlos is pumping, a rack of scissors in the kitchen falls and makes a loud noise. Jacinto (Eduardo Noriega, Open Your Eyes), the young caretaker who was once an orphan himself here, comes to investigate. Carlos flees down into the cellar to hide, and there he encounters the shadow that taunted him. He is touched by his phantom in the cellar, and we see, before anyone else, that this image is real. It is a boy, no older than Carlos, with the upper left portion of his forehead cracked open, and pale, blood seeping upwards as if the body was underwater. After touching Carlos, the ghost quickly disappears, but a voice says, ""Many of you will die.""

It is a prophecy that demands fulfillment.

There is gold in the orphanage, gold that Carmen and Casares give to those that will be called Nationalists, in support of their cause. Jacinto knows of this gold, and he wishes to steal it for himself. Not only is he bedding Conchita, the beautiful young cook (and Jaime's wide-eyed crush), but he is also taking Carmen as a bedmate. It is an unusual coupling; Carmen was the principal when Jacinto was an orphan there, and she has a wooden leg that she must set aside to accept him. (Some small irony there.) When they partner, Jacinto takes and replaces one key from her large ring of keys to see if it will be the one to open the safe that holds the gold.

With Jacinto, a ghost may be the least of their worries.

This is an excellent film, one better appreciated on the second viewing. I've heard it compared to The Others, but I doubt such comparisons would have been made if the director and writer of The Others, Alejandro Amenabar, was not also Mexican. While they are both ghost stories, they operate under completely different rules. I highly recommend this.

But then, I always watch movies I like more than once: the first time for the plot, the rest for the subtleties... The movie itself has none of the ""sophistication"" and the slickness of the typical American production. It is a raw and graphic drama set during the Spanish Civil War in a physically hostile landscape that fully complements the story. Although some questions remain unanswered at the end, I did not find this disturbing because, somehow, they were intellectual questions, rather than flaws in the plot. In other words, the answers were, somehow, not essential to the story. I would recommend this film simply because it is an excellent example of a ""different"" kind of movie making.

1701013,5,B00006420D,"Like del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth"" which has made huge waves in the non-Hollywood world, ""The Devil's Backbone"" is not easily categorised. Ghost story? yes, but much more. Picture of the scary tensions in Spain in the early days of the Civil War? yes, but more. Wonderful tale of how a group of children mature amid disaster and tragedy and come to be almost their own family, to replace the ones they never had or are separated from? Yes, but more. Rich in symbols and allegory...yes, but...

The richness of what T.S.Eliot called the ""objective correlative"" gives one that sense of underlying depth. For instance, there's the huge unexploded bomb stuck in the middle of the school courtyard. What is it but a metaphor for the hidden ghastly secret that waits to explode and reveal the reason for the mysterious ghost of the boy Santi? We only find out Santi's story near the end. Then there's the Devil's Backbone itself - in reality a congenital deformity where the spine is exposed, but spooky-looking in the sample floating in a jar of preservative - doesn't Jacinto exactly match that name? An irredeemable core of evil, like a Shakespeare villain or the Captain in Pan's Labyrinth. del Toro doesn't want to claim that there's something good in everyone: he says no, some characters are just irreversibly turned to the dark side, the very backbone of evil.

Then there's the subtle end-to end connections that add more richness. In the early scene of the school classroom, the children are shown the picture of a mammoth and the teacher makes the point that in these days the creatures were so big and strong that the hunters could only succeed by working closely together as a group. At the end, the children - that have survived - do exactly that as they hunt the gunman, and with pointed wooden spears yet!

I don't really agree with the reviewers who see a strong parallel to ""The Lord of the Flies."" The children here (wonderfully acted, by the way) don't regress to a primitive kind of anarchical ritual-filled state: in fact they bond ever more closely and deal very directly with the real world around them.

One thought: having seen this, I now don't think any more that in Pan's Labyrinth we are absolutely, definitely meant to take Ofelia's fantasy scenes as all in her mind. Clearly del Toro doesn't mind creating ""real"" supernatural entities. Perhaps in ""Pan"" he just wants to leave us in a state of permanent uncertainty, though the majority view among reviewers is that it's literally just fantasy.",1174089600,52,2518,4.7949308755760365

1701015,5,B00006420D,"12 year old Carlos (Tielve) arrives to an isolated boarding school for boys closer to the end of the Spanish Civil War. New friends and bullies, a director of the school (Luppi) - old, wise doctor, who likes citing poems to his deputy (Paredes) and is clearly in love with her. Deputy director shares his love for poetry and secret sympathy for republicans (whom they're hiding some gold for) although prefers to seek sexual pleasure in the hands of a young caretaker (Noriega). There's only a blue sky above the orphanage and burnt out, lifeless Spanish prairie for miles around. Oh, I nearly forgot - children are telling stories about ""the one who sighs"" - a local ghost roaming vaults of the boarding school, and as we're to find out willing to tell some secret to Carlos.

War is in the air. There's no actual war in The Devil's Backbone, but Guillermo Del Toro's ""Spanish trilogy"" is about war so it's the main theme here. It's obvious the war is coming even to this remote corner of Spain. It's hanging over this place as Damocles' sword and reminds of itself even by way of a huge unexploded bomb sticking out of the schoolyard pavement. It serves both as a reminder and as a menace - no one knows if it's going to explode finally. As in later Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth the war is shown here through the eyes of children and is seen as troublous times when you don't know whom to trust, when a neighbor can turn out to be your enemy, when everyone is against everyone else. Children can only trust other children and try to survive relying only on themselves albeit their attempts can seem naive and helpless. The line ""They're grown-ups but we're numerous"" will stick in your mind for a long time after you're finished watching. Like the old doctor who stays by the window with his shotgun to wait for the villains - his effort also looks naive, but we know he's still a child too. That's why he shudders seeing people being shot in cold blood by the wall - child's mind can't bear such an atrocity. It's the only manifestation of war in the film so we shudder along with the doctor and at this moment think war is something that can't be rationalized by our mind.

At first glance The Devil's Backbone looks a bit strange because nothing seems to happen in the movie, but as the film goes on we try to realize there's no excessive or needless scenes and shots here. Everything is done to convey the message, and I'd say Del Toro has more than one to deliver to us. And the ghost exists not just to attract viewers' attention to ""another ghost story"" because, frankly speaking, it's not a ghost story and much less a horror film. It's one of those pictures where there's no stipulated story-line, but where you understand after credits start rolling you've just seen an extremely talented work. That is how in intervals between making Blade and Hellboy Del Toro manages to create real masterpieces. The Devil's Backbone is surely a film not to miss, already with Pan's Labyrinth it forms a very strong dilogy. There's no doubt the third picture will be as powerful and profound as the previous two.",1172275200,12,3108,4.558139534883721

Anyway, I love a good ghost story. Ghosts are still to me, the quickest and easiest way to illicit fear. Think back to when you were a kid and could stay up all night watching Dracula or a stalker movie but had a chill running down your spine when you simply heard a good ghost story. But they have to have to have to be done right. In real estate the three rules are location location location, in ghost movies it's atmospherte atmosphere atmosphere. The tricks of the trade are all old, but just like tripping on a banana peel, if done right, it works.

The Devils Backbone not only gets it right, it bravely decides to take it deeper. Calling this movie a ghost story period is a huge disservice. Yes there are sections where there is a ghost present, but the ghost itself quickly fades into the background while we are pulled into a story that  revolves around a time and an event that no American from my generation could completly grasp... and that heightens the movie from a simple chilling tale into something far more relevant.

The plot of the movie revolves around Carlos, a young Spansih boy dropped off unsuspectingly at a boys school during the Spanish Civil War after his father has been killed(which for the length of the movie he never is told). He befriends one of the older caretakers,a few of the boys, and butts heads with a former student who now lives on the premesis. Also he is informed by the students that someone else is on these grounds too, they call him ""the one who sighs"". He appears to Carlos a few times in shadow and in one particularly suspensful scene, in full body trying to tell him something, but for most of the movie,Carlos simpy does what anyone else would do... he runs. Its only when he stops and listens does he learn to stand on his own two feet and to do what must be done to become not only a man before his time, but to save the lives of the other children he's boarding with.

It would be ignorant of me to suppose I can deduce everything the director(Guillermo Del Toro) is trying to say, especially without knowing jack about Spains history(I had to look it up to find out what conflict was the central backdrop). What I took away from the movie is this-to become a man, you have to be willing to risk everything for whats right. Its also a nicely told revenge story as the true main villain of the movie comes clear and states very clearly and elegantly what lot of movies clumsily stumble over themselves trying to. That alot of times fear of the unknown is nothing compared to what evil lurks in us and what we are capable of doing to one another. This is all very surface and obvious I know, and Im sure symbolically it has alot more going on, but thats what repeat viewings are for.

Mr Del Tormo directs with a kids love for spook settings and a man who desparatly loves his countries sensitive eye. No other recent""ghost story"" that i can think of has such an accomplished visual flare while blending 3-dimensional characters into a tapestry capturing a time and place so vividly. It also has to be said that the main cast, most of whom are children ranging from 10-15 do a very good job and  he must have a gift for bringing a credible performance out of them, like Spielberg or Shyamalan.

Bottom line, the ghost sections of the movie really work, but what makes the movie is the human element. The ghost story becomes secondary and that's not a complaint, anything else would have been a disservice to a heart renching story.

Often compared to ""The Sixth Sense (1999)"" and ""The Others (2001)"", ""The Devil's Backbone"" is even a better film, the ultimate ghost story that goes beyond the genre and very successfully mixes horror, suspense, and coming of age during the war time story. Written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, the film takes place during the Spanish Civil War in an isolated boarding school for the orphans of the War where a new boy, Carlos encounters the ghost of a murdered child Santi whose body was never found and who warns Carlos that ""Many of you will die"". How did Santi die? why does not he leaves the school's courtyard, what is the tragedy he is trying to prevent? It is up to Carlos to find the answers to these and many more questions as well as to stand up to the school's bully, Jaime and to find out what is behind the violent hostility of the orphanage's nasty caretaker, Jacinto who himself was and orphan and had been a pupil in the school as a child. The movie is not just beautifully directed - it is very well written and provides the deep insight into each character, including school headmistress named Carmen (Marisa Paredes), kind and brave Professor Casares, vicious bully Jaime who would turn a lonely and scared boy and even the embodiment of evil, Jacinto with his own heartbreaking story. Along with ""The Spirit of the Beehive"", ""Devil's Backbone"" is a harrowing exploration of the war and its affect on childhood. It also brings to mind such classic as Bunuel's ""Los Olvidados"" - and this is the best praise I have for any movie. Highly recommended.",1167523200,3,1743,4.677524429967427

`The Devil's Backbone released in '01 is an intelligent, stylish and atmospheric film set in a remote orphanage in 1939 during the Spanish Civil War. The story revolves around a new arrival at the orphanage named Carlos who is assigned the bed of a missing student. When Carlos begins to hear unidentified sighs in the night he becomes determined to discover the whereabouts of the missing child.

The film begins with a short, profound narration which caught my attention immediately and got me excited about what was to follow. It didn't quite live up to my expectations. The storyline was a little slow in development and the ending was unoriginal and predictable. On the positive side, the production values are first rate and director Guillermo del Toro creates a wonderful ghostly atmosphere that will keep you watching to the end.",1167177600,3,876,5.0344827586206895

1701067,5,B00006420D,"Directed by Guillermo del Toro, ""The Devil's Backbone,"" is a film which incorporates mystery with a blend of horror. And it succeeds as both a mystery and a horror film. The atmosphere of the film is first rate, as the films narrative employs the suggestion and nuance of horror with depth, while at the same time showing the subtle and not so subtle emotions of the films protagonists and antagonists. This is turn leaves the viewer immersed in the story, as the narrative revolves around several characters. Moreover, it is not everyday one views a film where the ghost is the protagonist. This is a film I knew I was going to like from the narration in the beginning of the film, to the stunning visuals that accompany it.

Furthermore, the atmosphere of this particular film is great, as the surrealistic and ghostly images in the film, and especially the nuances of horror, were maximized to the fullest. And once again, this is a film that plays out more like a mystery and drama with the horror placed in the film. However, the horror is more intelligently done than many films of the genre. The film itself takes place during the waning days of the Spanish Civil War [1939], at an orphanage for children [boys] whose father's have been killed-in-action. And in a twist, the ghost is one of the the main protagonists in the film. Carlos (Fernando Tielve) portrays the latest addition to the orphanage. In the middle of the orphanages' yard we witness a diffused bomb, which is embedded in the earth. Possibly a metaphor for the war itself? The unexploded bomb keeps the viewers attention, and allows us to see that even in a place where children are supposed to be safe, there is much danger in the world.

Moreover, the ghost is not your typical malevolent ghost, but a ghost whose warnings of ""Many of you will die"" holds your attention as to who this ghost is. What does the ghost want? Is the ghost there to help the children? Or does the ghost see the living as merely a means to an end? Is this ghost using the children? Or is there more to the ghost than we are led to believe? This is not a mindless and directionless film---as Guillermo del Toro takes the viewer on a journey through not only the mind of a child, and the horror he views around him in his new surroundings, but introduces us to the of both apparition he sees and the true terror of the time period he is living through.

""The Devil's Backbone"" takes the viewer into the dark unknown recesses of the world of the nonliving, while using the brutal Spanish Civil War as a backdrop. And the film succeeds magnificently in its narrative. Yes, Carlos is afraid of the ghost, yet he is also fascinated by this apparition that only he can see. There is an important side narrative going on in the film, which I do not wish to divulge, and thus spoil this film for you. Carlos (Fernando Tielve) gives a great performance as the young boy whom the ghost has made contact with. At first Carlos is scared, but his curiosity is too great for him to not investigate this ghost further. Jacinto (Eduardo Noriega) gives an outstanding performance as the antagonist in the film. He is in charge of the young boys, to some degree. More importantly, however, is that Jacinto has ulterior motives for staying at the orphanage. The ending is superb, and the acting is first-rate.

The beginning narration in the film is one of the greatest I have ever heard in not only a horror film, but any film period.....""What is a ghost? A tragedy condemned to repeat itself time and again? An instant of pain, perhaps. Something dead which still seems to be alive. An emotion suspended in time. Like a blurred photograph. Like an insect trapped in amber."".....I highly recommend this film. If you like your horror films nuanced and layered with the suggestion of horror, while at the same time giving you a great story, then this film is worth the purchase. It will be a great addition to your horror cinema collection. There are tons of mindless horror films filled with blood and gore. Do yourself a favor and at least rent this film. It comes highly recommended. [Stars: 5+]",1160265600,4,4129,4.590785907859079

This really isn't a true horror film, and that's a good thing. It's not mired in cliches and has a more elegant tone than typical slasher fare.

1701072,5,B00006420D,"I guess you could say this movie is the classic old-fashioned ghost story, and really well-done.  I don't categorize this as an ""art film"" really, even if it is in a foreign language ;-).  I think the so-called surrealism is not really surreal, certainly not ""magic realism.""  (Hint: not every weird movie is ""surreal"" and not every Spanish-language film is ""magic realism,"" even if it isn't in English.) This is a plain old ghost story, and a good one.  It does have a little arty flavor about it though.

If you like scary movies but hate the schlock that passes for your usual horror film (anything with the words ""Jason, Freddy, Chucky, I know what you did last,"") then you may enjoy it.  It has a message, and a story line you have to follow, and it is really scary in places. And it doesn't have any sexy California faux-teenagers or their cars in it.  Warning: it isn't in English, and only has subtitles.

It will seem too arty for anybody that likes movies with any of above words in it however (Jason, etc.), and the fact that it is in Spanish and has only English subtitles and no voiceover, will be a serious impediment to many U.S. viewers, as attested by some of the reviews here.  If you like high quality anime though, you will probably like it, since your American anime fan has learned at least a little bit that there's something outside of the U.S., and that you don't have to speak English to be good.  And a few of the visuals are worthy of the best anime films out there.

The effects/animations are spectacular, and yet not overpowering either. This is no fireworks display; no choreographed fights or absurd gunfights. The movie has style and a message, artfully delivered.  This movie, rare among ""art films,"" uses high quality effects and animation to deliver a really chilling story.

BTW, anybody who writes a bad review about a movie because it is in another language with subtitles ... Get a life.  That is simply not a reasonable basis for a review, any more than a 300-pound woman giving a tube top a bad review because it doesn't make her tummy look good, or someone who gives a gadget a bad review because it doesn't work when you put the batteries in wrong.

I for one am grateful that those subtitles are there instead of voiceovers.  Off the top of my head I can't think of a single voiceover I have ever heard that wasn't ridiculous.  Of course that can be fun, too.  Think of the American version of ""Akira.""

1701114,5,B00006420D,"`The Devil's Backbone' is a superior horror film in Spanish (with English subtitles and director's commentary) by Guillermo Del Toro, director of such classy horror / action movies as `Cronos', `Mimic', and `Hellboy'. As odd as it may sound, the only problem with this movie is that it is too good for a conventional horror movie and not good enough for a classy surprise ending classic such as `The Sixth Sense'. It is not, for example, as pleasingly scary or engaging as `Cronos', another Spanish language film.

The story takes place almost entirely in a Spanish orphanage at the time of the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s, where the staff and headmistress is partial to the nationalists (the anti-Franco, anti-fascist side which ultimately lost to Franco with his German and Italian allies).

Part of my dissatisfaction with the film was the fact that the point of the title is not fully played out. The devil's backbone is a kind of congenital deformity which signals a child who has an evil future. Oddly, this plays practically no part that I could see in the movement and resolution of the plot. There is quite a lot of suspense and terror at young boys being put in harm's way. There is also a lot of excellent imagery, suspense, and other kinds of human drama, but it just doesn't terrify quite as well as, for example, `Halloween' or `The Shining'.

One major positive of this DVD is the fact that it has an English language commentary from Del Toro and his cinematographer. It was interesting to hear, for example, that Del Toro hates doing exposition and admires those who can do it such as Quentin Tarantino and Woody Allen!

I think I would rather see this film than any one of a hundred B-movie horrors, but it is just not as satisfying as `Cronos' or `Mimic'.",1128902400,,1776,4.664536741214057
1701115,5,B00006420D,"I had mentioned before that so many times people are so angry or uninterested in horror films because all it does is show scared people reacting to extraordinary events. It normally shows limbs flying everywhere or blood caked against the walls. Well, what would you say if I offered you a film that not only gave you a horror story, but also a very character driven stories. What if I were to show you a horror story that could possibly happen to you, or at least you feel that it could happen? Well, look no further, because I have found it in a little Spanish horror film called El Espinazo del diablo (also called The Devil's Backbone). There were several reasons why this film really worked, and worked well. I am going to list the top five reasons that this film worked so that you can take it back with you, and watch this film, and see what direction the horror genre is headed and how it will soon be a bigger part of cinematic culture.

1) The obvious -- the Bomb. This was in nearly every shot, and provided so much for my mind. Why didn't the bomb explode? Sure, there are scientific reasons, but when researched further, you may see that it goes so far beyond that. It is the root of this film. It is the biggest symbolic reference in this film. What is the bomb you may ask? My question to you is ... WHO is the bomb? When I watched this film I really felt that the bomb symbolized Jacinto. When Jacinto arrived it was like the bomb arriving. It has the power to destroy, but has yet to. It is dormant, waiting for the appropriate time to wreak the destruction ... just like Jacinto. When he arrives he does not immediately kill, but waits for the perfect time. But, like the bomb, Jacinto has the ability to kill without remorse. It kills to fulfill its mission, which is all. Also, this bomb not only symbolizes Jacinto, but also Santi. Together an unknown force joins these two. The common bond ... the bomb. In the beginning of the film, Carlos immediately runs to the bomb because there is some attraction to it. There is no fear, just an unvarnished desire to know more about it. This is the same for when Carlos first meets Santi, fear is surrounding him, but instead he would rather learn more about Santi and help him.

2) This wasn't the normal horror film plagued with beautiful scenery and screaming children, this was almost a fresh retelling of the book The Lord of the Flies. At times I had to ask myself if I wasn't watching a literal interpretation of this book in this film. There are some major differences, but some of the overall themes remain the same. Director del Toro takes a big leap with this film and succeeds where others have failed. He doesn't clutter this film with flowers or filler, he instead tells the story as it should be told, and for that I have so much respect for this film.

3) The way that del Toro filmed this movie was amazing. I wasn't expecting the second half of this film when I first began it. I wasn't ready for the death of the children, or the sudden death of the adults. I sometimes get so used to Disney-fied storytelling that it almost jolts me when I am reminded that it can be dark. A story cannot always be happy, especially when you put characters out of their element. I longed to see the ghost, and del Toro wasn't afraid to show him. So many times in today's cinemas we have to wait until the very end to catch a glimpse of the evil spirit that has been causing the chaos ... not in this film. Immediately upon arrival at the school, we see (with Carlos) the spirit of Santi. It really helps build the tension much better than waiting until the very end.

4) I loved the theme of revenge in this film. This goes back to my explanation of the common bond between Santi and Jacinto. While the bomb symbolically represents the both of them, characterally, they both are very similar. Both want revenge, both grew up in this school, and both are hopelessly wandering through life. I really though that it fit perfectly that these two characters were so similar, yet hated each other so much. There was a fear there that was kept hidden, but as you the viewer realized, it was always there. Only del Toro could have pulled this off.

5) Finally, the actor Eduardo Noriega did an impressive job on this film. I had recently seen him in the film Abre Los Ojos (aka Open Your Eyes) playing the part that Tom Cruise would later improve, and was unimpressed, but upon seeing this film ... I have been reborn. . He has this air of malevolence about him. His intense, dark eyes are windows into a tortured soul. His voice is venomous. He even has an exceptionally evil grin. If someone were to smile at me the way Jacinto smiles, I would go pale and shrivel. At first I was very worried when I saw him on screen, but by the end of the film ... I was nothing but impressed!!!

1701117,4,B00006420D,"The Devil's Backbone (Guillermo del Toro, 2001)

I'm still having a problem figuring out what it is about Hollywood that kills a person's soul. That it does, however, is obvious. Take Guillermo del Toro as a perfect example. He directed Cronos, an amazing piece of work, then was conscripted by Hollywood to make Mimic. Mimic is a painfully bad film. He goes back home and makes El Espinazo del Diablo, which is not as fine a piece of work as is Cronos, but which is certainly worth watching. Then he comes back to America and directs... Blade II, a movie most notable for taking everything good about the first Blade film, chopping it into bits, and then dancing on its grave.

The Devil's Backbone was one of the spate of ghost stories that came out early in the decade (presumably riding on the success of The Sixth Sense and Stir of Echoes in 1999). It's often compared to The Others, also released in 2001, but there's really not much of a basis for comparison between the two films. They're best taken on their own terms.

Carlos (Fernando Tielve) is sent to what is ostensibly a school, but really serves to hide the children of revolutionaries in the final days of the Spanish Civil War. It also hides the gold that finances the revolutionaries' activities, as we find out in the opening scene. There are just three teachers left in the school, plus a handyman and a housekeeper, who talk about fleeing to Granada to start a new life on a farm.  While they're all trying to stay below the revolutionaries' radar, Carlos encounters a ghost, and the rest of his part in the movie deals with the war between his curiosity and desire to help the ghost and his fear of its appearance.

It sounds a lot more complex than it really is. The Devil's Backbone is far more about atmosphere than it is about plot, which is actually rather simplistic. The movie's strong points come strictly from its atmosphere and the acting of Fernando Tielve, who's completely believable as a scared but determined twelve-year-old.

Eminently watchable. Certainly a helluva lot better than Mimic or Blade 2. *** ",1112572800,,2094,4.673913043478261
1701118,3,B00006420D,"Okay, let's see... one of the reviewers wants their horror movies with ""blood, gore, action and violence"". Okay, let's break that down. First, let's put blood and gore together - blood is the liquid stuff inside people and other animals and gore is guts & stuff. If that's what a horror movie is then all war movies, most gangster movies, many westerns, and any halfway realistic medical drama qualifies as ""horror"". If you're anything like me then you're not so much ""horrorfied"" at blood and gore. I mean, the standard response to that should be ""yuck!"" not fear. Now what about action and violence, those two go together, right? Well, right there you have me again. Isn't there a whole genre of movie  (and fiction in general) known as ""action""? What's so horrofying about ""action""? In fact, if you put too much action in a horror movie it moves too fast and you have no time for fear or horror or any other horror-related response. Just think of that remake of Dawn of the Dead. The zombies ran around so fast all the time it didn't really matter that they were zombies. I mean, what the hell is so horrorfying about that?! Sure, maybe you won't get bored, but ""not being bored"" isn't really what horror is for, is it? And as for violence, well that's just destructive action directed at living creatures, particularly people. Well, now THAT is pretty horrorfying, but once you bring in a horror element, say like a zombie or a vampire or some monster or whatever, well, you've stepped off into fantasy and forgive me, but I'm not really scared by things that don't exist, so no ammount of violence will convince me that anything is a good horror movie. That pretty much leaves violence perpetrated by insane, devious, or supposedly ""evil"" human beings. That means that the only truly decent horror movies, provided you look for your horror films to have ""blood, gore, action and violence,"" is a mad killer movie with no supernatural element to be disbelieved, an ultra realistic depiction of people killing and maiming each other. You're right that DOES sound really horrible! Add to that the fact that when you get such over the top action and violence and gore you tend to lose your sense of belief because you know it isn't true, isn't really happening so, like so many horror fans, you become really just a fan of fake movie carnage and watch your beloved (fake) ""horror movies"" like a sports fan, yelling at the screen, cheering on the carnage, never really taking time to become horrorfied or scared in any way. Well, I'm sorry, but if that's horror you can keep it! Movies like Devil's Backbone may seem more dramatic than horrorific when compared to a zombie movie, but for my money it's closer to horror than most ""blood, gore, action & violence"" fests masquerading as horror and providing mere frat boy thrill ride chills than anything resembling horror or fear. It still all comes down to story and taking time to bring about a suspension of disbelief and drawing the viewer into a state of tracelike horror and fear.

To me, this film suffers from a lack of interesting plot, laughable interaction amongst the characters and a mediocre and conventional approach to a ghost story. To me, there was absolutely nothing interesting or ""frightening"" about the ghost and the 'ambiance' was typical fare. The story concerns a child who is left at an orphanage in the middle of the desert in Spain during the Spanish Civil War and instead of analyzing his soul, which one would hope would happen, considering this is a foreign movie, we are merely given cliched storylines like ""the ghost is here for a reason,"" or ""there's a ghost in this building,"" and its really all empty. Nowhere do we get to understand the nature of the inner dimensions of the characters.

There is the typical mean kid bully, the nice teacher and then the sexual young man who is having sex with the older matriarch in one of the most brainless events in the film. Most of the effects were done with a computer and that takes away any imagination. The war planes flying above, the explosion in the rectory and even the ghost itself were ""enhanced"" with digital imaging and it further ruins this attempt at life so we are basically left with a modicum of interest.

What is lacking is something inherently interesting, or movable, so there is a ghost, so what? What does he mean to us? By the end, we are numbed by the excessive and irrelevant use of violence from one of the characters. It all fails in the end when this becomes just another good vs bad soap opera in the world film.

1701121,5,B00006420D,"One of the greatest crosses of the drama and horror genres ever made, each aspect of ""The Devil's Backbone"" is so effective it could have stayed solely within one field and still succeeded greatly.  It could have been 'just' a deep and tragic drama about a destitute orphanage during the Spanish Civil War and the orphans and their caretakers and come out a first-rate film without any of the 'supernatural' elements.  Or it could have restricted itself to being 'just' an eerie, darkly atmospheric, suspenseful ghost story and, without the elements that provide commentary of the effects of war on the innocent and all the other 'drama' elements, succeeded brilliantly as one of the best examples of the 'ghostly haunting' subgenres of horror.  As it is, it simultaneously hits all the right notes on both the paths it takes and ends up even better thn it would have been as 'only' a drama or 'only' horror, and is a credit to both genres.

  Starts off with a young boy becoming the newest arrival at the orphanage, initially being befriended by some of the other children and immediately running into problems with others.  Soon the newcomer encounters the ghost of a child who died at the orphanage some time before.  In the first few minutes it seems like the movie may come off unbearably depressing, but that turns out not to be the case thanks to the huge likability of many of the characters, including some lovable children whose plight is heartbreaking, and the caretakers who are both devoting their lives and riskiing their lives to stay in this war-torn place and try to not only keep the children alive but give them some quality of life despite the circumstances and limited resources.  Also, some of the more beligerant children who seem like they're going to be highly unsympathetic because of their behavior toward the other kids, become considerably more tolerable as you learn more about their circumstances and as bonds form between the characters and break down the hostilities.  That's not to say there aren't also some reprehensible people in here, but it's the likable characters who save the movie from being overrun with despair and gloom.

  It seems like I'm talking only about the 'drama'-type elements and giving short shrift to the horror angles, but that's only because they only come into dominant play later in the film, and I usually try not to say too much about the latter stages of a movie.  Rest assured these elements are there, waiting to rise up.

  Outstandingly acted with epic cinematography, a great musical score, and numerous other pluses that combine to make this so great, ""The Devil's Backbone"" is extremely recommended for horror fans and drama fans alike.",1100995200,6,2710,4.882096069868996

1701182,5,B00006420D,"Nowadays Guillermo Del Toro is best known for high-profile actioners such as ""Hellboy"" and ""Blade 2"" and while both of those films are excellent in my opinion they  can't hold a candle to this 2001 Spanish film.  ""The Devil's backbone"" is a sophisticated and stylish piece that effectively transposes elements of the classic ghost story, Victorian fairy tale, symbolic metaphors, and human tragedy into a bleak Spanish Civil War setting.  It is, simply put, Del Toro's masterpiece.

The action takes place in 1939 towards the end of the Spanish civil war.  Carlos, a young boy whose father was killed in the line of duty, is brought to a secluded orphanage in the middle of the desert.  The orphanage is nothing fancy but it does the trick; every child has their own bed, there is enough food to go around and quality teachers to educate the children.  The backyard of the orphanage however holds quite the ominous sight, a giant bomb stuck in the sand that somehow never exploded upon falling.  On the day the bomb fell a child named ""Santi"" disappeared from the orphanage.  Speculation ran rampant as to what exactly happened to Santi and it was speculated that the boy ran away and is now either safe with the sheppards or died at the hand of cutthroats.  But Carlos and the other boys keep hearing strange noises at night that make them think that dead or alive, ""Santi"" is still lurking on the grounds of the orphanage...

The success of this film lies in the immaculous amount of detail and meaning Del Toro injects in almost every individual scene.  The director's commentary track is a virtual lesson in the history of Spanish art, architecture and folklore.  Every scene in the film is deliberate and full of meaning.  The performances are phenomenal, especially the young kid who plays ""Carlos"".  The kid is pure genius, much better than anything Joel Haley Osmond could ever muster.  There's no ""He's scared but he looks so cute"" feel here.  He looks scared but subdued at the same time, avoiding the overacting that tends to plague performances of young children in flight flicks.

At first Carlos is ostracized from the rest of the group and bullied around for being ""the new kid"".  But when the ghost begins to appear, the group develop a sense of comraderie that becomes fascinating to watch.  The group dynamics involved in fighting a common evil are admirable and we as viewers really get to love these kids.  And then halfway through the film Del Toro throws a kicker, a major event that pulls the film out of its lull and turns things completely around.  From then on, the movie becomes a triumph of style AND substance.  And just when we start to forget about the supernatural elements in the face of the occurring human tragedies BAM! the ghost is thrown right back into the mix.  Emotional and tragic, ""The Devil's Backbone"" is the kind of gutsy film experience so rarely seen nowadays.  As well-deserved as Del Toro's current commercial success is, I hope he someday makes another film along the lines of this one.",1096675200,9,3037,4.75
1701183,4,B00006420D,"To call this Guillermo del Toro film creepy is not wrong at all, but to say so might be misleading.  It is a ghost story, sure, but del Toro succeeds in creating the convincing characters, children and adults alike who must confront the fear ... that of ghost, or whatever else.  See this one as such, and you'll not be disappointed.

But as many reviewers say, the center of the story is a ghost.  The place is in Spain, and the time is 1939 when the Civil War is getting over, with Franco's army winning.  Now a boy Carlos is sent to an orphanage in the middle of the desert, and somehow in the middle of that orphanage you see a rusted, unexploded bomb stuck into the ground.

There, Carlos must stay.  The kind schoolmaster takes good care of him, and provides a bed for him, but someone, or something, Carlos feels, is hiding and looking at him, perhaps from the old disused building.  Does this have something to do with the missing boy nobody wants to talk about?  And who used the very bed Carlos is sleeping on?

The identity of the ghost (or whatever it is) is not so  important as the truths behind the 'ghost.'  Carlos, and the audiences alike, realize that all the characters -- the schoolmaster, the greedy janitor (Edward Noriega, 'Open Your Eyes'), the sexy maid, and other orphaned boys -- are trying to avoid seeing the inevitable truths -- that is, people are dying out there, and the ghost warns; 'Many will die.'

But how?  The second part which would reveal it is unpredictable and gripping, without losing the supernatural tone that is set up in the first part, which is slow, but creepy all the same.  You may jump in your seat several times, but the strength of 'The Devil's Backbone' is not only that; it is also about the war-time people among the deaths, or those  who escaped the deaths ... for now.

This film is closer to Mexcian director del Toro's roots, a story with more gothic taste in which every small item matters.  The blue clear sky of Spain looks never more sinister than in this film, in which ghosts could be human, and humans act very atrociously.  A must for fans of atmosspheric horrors.",1094947200,4,2134,4.481865284974093

1701185,5,B00006420D,"A Beautiful, Stunning, Genre Bending Movie

 The Devil's Backbone is the antithesis of the Hollywood Big Picture. A beautiful movie, with a large cast of equally important characters who dictate the pace as the story unfolds. The amount of time devoted to character development is really quite astonishing - and may be slow moving for many American viewers. Another anti-Hollywoodism is director del Toro's refusal to confine his film into a specific genre, I've read and heard complaints from a number of U.S. viewers (and friends) ""he doesn't make up his mind if it's a horror film or a drama.""

 The beauty of this picture is that it shows that life can have supernatural elements to it; that everything can't always be explained away by science - not even by men of science.

 del Toro captures the wonderful horror and cruelty of innocence, sexual desire, romantic longings, dreams of fame and fortune, the atrocities of war and sets them in an orphanage far removed from the rest of the world - yet deeply scarred and affected by it.

 Throughout del Toro endows his film with heightened tension allowing us that giddy nervousness that the greatest horror films provide. One of the best of these occurs when Jaime and Carlos sneak out, stealing to the kitchen in the dead of night, to refill their water pitchers which the ghost has emptied out. (It'll make you think twice about getting up in the middle of the night for a drink of water!)

 del Toro isn't afraid of using an abundance of symbolism either. Far removed from civilization the orphanage is dry, parched, dust laden, yet so much of the film is filled with liquid, be it the enormous pool-sized well in the basement, the ghost Santi's liquid environment, Dr. Casares jars filled with rum and human fetuses (cocktail anyone?) or the rest of the cast's blood, sweat and tears.

 The ""dead"" bomb in the middle of the courtyard serves the same role as a statue of the Madonna would in a more standard setting, a silent observer, a mysterious presence, something come down from the heavens and is equally as dangerous as any religious icon. A brilliant stroke.

 At turns violent, heart warming, humorous and frightening, The Devil's Backbone, for those who give it the opportunity, will unfold before you like few things you've seen. Stunning.",1091750400,9,2308,4.824873096446701

there's a certain formula to a good ghost story, and that formula is a simple one: (a). spooky ghost (b). tries to communicate in order to (c). illuminate the circumstances surrounding his/her death and possibly (d). achieve vengeance and/or (e). protect others from the same squicky fate. it's a good formula, and TDB follows it with an astounding level of expertise.
for some reason, it seems that this is a set up that's easy to screw up; but when the formula is followed well, you end up with all the best elements of horror, suspense, mystery and even romance--all seasoned with a delightfully creepy paranormal ambience. this is most definitely the case with The Devil's Backbone. it is successfully spooky in parts, suspenseful throughout, and deeply romantic; yes, in accordance with the cliche, there's something for everyone.",1088640000,2,1463,5.0246913580246915

Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Digital

During the Spanish Civil War, a young orphan boy (Fernando Tielve) is sent to an isolated boarding school where he encounters the ghost of a murdered child (Junio Valverde) who warns him of impending disaster...

A masterpiece. Filmed in Spain by writer-director Guillermo del Toro following his unhappy Hollywood debut (MIMIC), this spellbinding melodrama works both as an examination of the political turmoil which characterized the Spanish Civil War, and as a simple ghost story in which a tragic spirit seeks vengeance for a terrible crime. Employing restless camerawork and atmospheric set designs to their best advantage, del Toro visualizes his own script (co-written with Antonio Trashorras and David Munoz) as the story of a vulnerable child cast adrift in a strange new world, where he must contend not only with everyday problems (such as the school bully, Inigo Garces, whose motives are rather more complex than they first appear), but also his frequent encounters with the unhappy ghost, some of which are genuinely unsettling (watch out for the heart-stopping sequence in which Tielve is besieged in a closet by the enraged phantom). Production values are first-class throughout, ranging from Cesar Maccaron's evocative art direction and Salvador Mayolas' ultra-creepy sound design, through to Luis de la Madrid's crisp editing skills and Javier Navarrete's unforgettable music score. Visual effects and makeup designs are also superb, though deliberately underplayed for maximum emotional effect.

The cast is toplined by Spanish movie veterans Marisa Paredes (a favorite of Pedro Almodovar) and Federico Luppi (CRONOS), and there are impressive turns by Irene Visedo as a young woman whose loyalties are divided by circumstances, and rising star Eduardo Noriega (the Spanish equivalent of Brad Pitt) as Visedo's boyfriend, an orphan-turned-caretaker whose volatile nature leads to a dramatic conclusion, with appalling consequences for everyone around him. Tielve is magnificent as the wide-eyed innocent around whom the entire narrative revolves, and Garces is every bit his equal as the bully who reclaims his dignity during a climactic showdown with the forces of evil. Released around the same time as THE OTHERS (2001) - another Spanish ghost story, filmed in English as a vehicle for Nicole Kidman - THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE was consigned to Art-house distribution by virtue of its status as a subtitled movie and suffered a comparative loss at the US box-office, though del Toro's magical fever dream is unquestionably the better of the two films.",1060560000,6,2689,5.454326923076923

It is this rumination which opens THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, a ghost story set during the Spanish Civil War directed by Guillermero Del Toro (Mimic, Blade 2) and presented by Pedro Almodovar.
Carlitos is an orphaned 12 year old who is sent to a boarding school that shelters orphans during the last days of the war.
One unwelcome occupant is the ghost of a murdered boy, called ""The One Who Sighs"" by the other pupils. Carlitos is unlucky enough to come face to face with the hideously disfigured apparition one night where as a dare, the other boys send him downstairs to get some water; but for some reason he ends up in the slug infested basement; where ""The One Who Sighs"" dwells in a pool conveniently located there.
The movie gets its title from the name given  to the deformed spine of dead foetuses, which is preserved in alcohol by an ecentric teacher. The alcohol is then sold in town and touted as a ""cure all"" remedy...BR>THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE is a horror thriller that takes its time getting started, but once it does it makes Hollywood's regular crop of horrors look anemic.

1701244,4,B00006420D,"The Devil's Backbone
I'm not a huge fan of subtitled films.  More often than not the subtitles tend to become a distraction for me. Often they're not done all that well and blend into the background scenery (this happened during my viewing of the Japanese film Audition) or I'm so busy trying to follow the written dialogue that I miss much of the film (this happened often during Amelie and occasionally during the Japanese version of The Ring).  And, to be honest, I despise wearing my glasses (ah, vanity) and these subtitles force the issue.  Because my experience with subtitles has been dismal at best I only picked up ""The Devil's Backbone"", a Spanish film with English subtitles, because it had been highly recommended as ""must-see"" by a reliable source.  After the first five minutes of viewing this film I was hooked and my issues with subtitles were all but forgotten.
Set during the Spanish Civil War the film immediately emits a sense of dread, desperation and hopelessness that is maintained throughout the length of the film.  The constant threat of war, starvation, death and destruction looms ever closer while human weaknesses are explored as well as strength and action in the face of all of the hopelessness.  All of these combined aspects, along with an interesting (but not terribly original) ghostly mystery, are what make the film far superior to most of what I've been viewing in the theatre.
Carlos is a young orphan.  His father died a casualty of the war but no one has the heart (or backbone) to tell him.  Instead his tutor drops him off at an orphanage and cowardly runs away without a word of explanation.  Young Carlos is left in the hands of strangers and is shown around his new ""home"" where he must adjust to an entirely new way of life.  I felt a deep sense of empathy for little Carlos right away.  As he tries to adjust a few of the other orphaned boys make his life just about as difficult as they can (starvation, disappointment and lack of compassion will do that to you).  But Carlos accepts this as his fate.  His confusion, fear and acceptance of it all seemed very true to life and all the more heartbreaking because of it.  As if this weren't enough, Carlos sees a ghost-boy who warns him of imminent danger.  Carlos flees for his life (like most of us would when faced with a ghost!).  Before long Carlos learns there are things much more dangerous than a ghost-boy lurking within the stifling confines of the orphanage.
The adult cast is relatively small but each adds interest to the plot.  There's the older schoolmarm who hides a shameful secret, an older professor in love with the schoolmarm who hides his feelings, his poetic soul and his impotence from his true love, there's a hunky, cold-hearted young caretaker who believes the world owes him big-time and, finally, there's an innocent young maiden who sees the truth of things far too late.  Her character seems unnecessary upon first view but the few moments of hope and light she brings into the dreary existence of the orphanage's resident ""bully"" make her character worthwhile.  Finally, there's Santi a former resident of the orphanage who now haunts its halls.  The boys all believe Santi ran away when a bomb was dropped (but never detonated) in their yard but deep down fear something terrible happened to him.  The circumstances surrounding Santi's disappearance are kept a secret and when revealed they aren't surprising but they are jaw-droppingly awful to witness.  Other than that I'm going to leave the rest of the plot alone.  It's something that should be viewed and not synopsized to death.
The appearances of the ghost are genuinely creepy despite the fact that his makeup is horribly bad and, much to my relief, this movie isn't stuffed with many gimmicky thrills (only one comes to mind).  I didn't jump out of my seat in fear but instead felt that wonderful thrill one experiences only when viewing a movie that maintains an intense sense of relentless dread.
I don't normally review films as I tend to forget all of the little details (and many of the big ones) as soon as I pop out the disk but this one just won't let go and its images refuse to leave me.  If you're as tired as I am of the standard cheap thrill filled dreck being shoveled out that disguises itself as horror (When Darkness Falls, anyone?) this film is a must see.  A haunting emotional experience to be sure.

1701245,3,B00006420D,"Yes, The Devil's Backbone was mis-marketed in the U.S.  This is not a horror film.  It is a suspense drama with ghostly elements.  The problem is that American film sensibilities do not provide for such a mixture.  That said....
Foreign films playing in the U.S. were once upon a time a novelty and were automatically either praised above all other films or they were denounced as insipid.  More recently, the sheep-like film reviewers have waxed poetic about any foreign film as long as it was moody or politically charged, regardless of the story, acting, or direction.  There are certainly brilliant foreign films (which one must remember are not foreign films to the country in which they were made), but there are also bad foreign films - just as there are good and bad American films.
The problem with many ""latin"" films (any film of Spanish or French derivation) played in the U.S. is that the emotional sensibilities aren't the same.  For example, in many a spanish language film, the dialogue seems over the top and the translation and acting forced.  In its native country, this would not be seen as such.  Also, ""latin"" films don't always tie up all the loose strings at the end.  You are supposed to infer from the closing what happens off screen - or decide for yourself.  This, as a typical American, is highly frustrating.
All of this is a precursor to my review of The Devil's Backbone.  It is a very moody, very well directed, photographed, and acted film.  The problem lies not with any of these, but rather with the lack of a clear linear quality to the storyline.  There are several storylines running concurrently and that is something that any good film has.  However, they do not really build on each other, but rather run concurrently without affecting each other to create the suspense, I imagine, was intended.
Finally, the ending, which solves a mystery, is less than satisfying not because it didn't tie up loose ends nicely, but rather because it did so too simply. While my typical complaint in many films is that the ending isn't explained well enough, in The Devil's Backbone, the ending is explained too simplistically and rather unsatisfactorily.  Why the ghost of a child haunts this orphanage, should be more gothic in its solution - as the ghost here is far more terrifying and mysterious than in dozens of other films.
I really enjoyed the film, but I just wanted more out of it than what there was.  I think the director is quite capable and I have enjoyed many of his other films.

The film, set in Spain during World War II, is about a young boy who discovers a vengeful ghost the day he arrives at an orphanage for the children of war victims. The ghost warns the boy, Carlos, that many will die. Confused and scared by the message, Carlos tries to gain friendship with the other boys, and soon gets wrapped up in the dangerous affairs of the war torn group.
Though this is a foreign language film, stylistically it plays out like a well made American film. The special effects are fantastic, the story engrossing and the chills spine tingling. Del Toros visual touch is unmistakable here as the camera follows flying objects, such as a slingshot bullet to its contact point. But this film isn't the action piece Blade 2 is. This has more suspense and dramatic tension, with genuine scares and a foreboding, claustrophobic atmosphere. Its clear Del Toro has a spectacular eye for visual effects and, more importantly, incorporating them into an intriguing story with fleshed out characters.

1701247,2,B00006420D,"What is about children and horror films?  There are so many scary kids running around in terror flicks these days it makes you wonder how much affection filmmakers have for their own offspring.  Kids in movies these days can predict the future, see dead people, haunt living people, talk to dead people, predict the end of the world, and say spooky things in little kiddie whispers.  Hopscotch, apparently, has became passe.  I have a theory that studio heads (even the ones from south of the border) are so unfamiliar with children, and so utterly mystified by them, that they don't know what else to do with them except use them to try and scare the living bejesus out of you.  I assume dogs will be next, and then maybe homeless people.  Either way, the gimmick is running out of steam.
So here we are with ""The Devil's Backbone"", a beautiful film from Guillermo Del Toro that looks scary, acts scary, sounds scary, but for some reason isn't scary.  And there's a good reason why: we've seen it all before.  Spooky kids, ghosts popping out of water, ghosts coming up from behind you in a old, rickety building.  Del Toro does it all well (the photography here is particularly intoxicating), but there isn't anything new about the creepiness on display here.  The most effective horror films usually scare you with thoughts rather than images.  But because the plot here is relatively standard thriller stuff (robbery goes awry, helpless victims rise up against a seemingly stronger adversary, ghost is really upset about how he went out), the film is easy to shake off once it's over.  There's one good scare, but it's a cheap one.  After that, the film is less than the sum of its parts.  A cred boost from being a foreign film doesn't make it any more surprising.
""The Devil's Backbone"" is the perfect example of how a film can be well made but still be bad.  Or, at least, not very good.

1701249,5,B00006420D,"A genuinely spooky ghost story, directed by Guillermo Del Toro.  The plot revolves around a haunted monastary in war-torn 1930s Spain; the hacienda doubles as a boy's school filled, in part, with refugees and orphans left behind by the anti-Franco partisans.  The special effects are creepy and clever; the supernatural intertwines with the temporal, and it's difficult to tell which is more horrifying.  I thought this was a great film, definitely worth checking out.  (Cast note: the kid who plays the hero looks *exactly* like Matthew Broderick!)",1039564800,4,549,5.275862068965517
1701280,4,B00006420D,"This movie is just as much a serious drama as it is a horror film. It is a ghost story, but in the tradition of The Others it is scary in parts, and terribly sad in others.
The story is set in Spain during the Spanish civil war of the 1930's. An orphaned boy, Carlos (Fernando Tielve), is dropped off at an orphanage in the middle of nowhere. It is hot and dusty there, and the nearest town is almost a days walk away. The orphanage is somewhat like a compound with buildings and fences surrounding an open air square in the middle. In the center of this is a large bomb sticking out of the ground that had been dropped several years earlier. At around 8 feet high and bigger around than a man could reach, it kind of dominates the center square. The bomb had been diffused and poses no threat, and the kids play around it and the adults have gotten used to its presence. Carlos is of course fascinated by it.
Among the 8 or so boys there is a bully who picks on Carlos and wants the comic books that he brought with him to the orphanage. Carlos does not back down from much of anything and sticks up for himself whenever confronted. During one scene where Carlos has gotten in trouble along with an unknown accomplice, Carlos refuses to tell the doctor at the orphanage (played by Federico Luppi, who also starred in Guillermo del Toro's wonderful 1993 film, Cronos). The few adults at the orphanage are composed of Dr. Casares (Luppi), Carmen, the headmistress (Marisa Paredes), Jacinto, the handyman (Eduardo Noriega) and his girlfriend Conchita (Irene Visedo) and a maid/caretaker. There is an odd love story that is presented involving the 4 main adult characters. It is not your typical Hollywood type love story however, and does not take away from the rest of the movie.
A couple nights after Carlos arrives he sees ""The one who sighs"", a ghost of a young boy about Carlos age. Some there deny that he exists and others confirm that they have heard him. Carlos seeks him out and quickly finds him but once confronted by his ghostly image finally becomes frightened.
While all this is going on there is a terrible battle being fought in the land and early on in the movie we find out that the Dr. and headmistress are sympathetic to the rebel cause (not the winning side) and have been storing several bars of gold for the rebels. Dr. Casares drove into town with Conchita to sell some rum that he produces at the orphanage (a very unforgettable scene when the Dr. describes to Carlos the rum he distills, and then sells to the townfolk). He sees a compadre who has been lined up against a wall outside and shot as a rebel. Dr. Casares huries back to the orphanage as he is afraid that his compadre might have told the Nationalists about the gold and their leftist, rebel leanings. I won't tell any more about what happens as I don't like spoiling the movie in my reviews, but I will say that while there were some surprises along the way (both pleasant and unpleasant), I did see the ending coming about halfway through the film. But It did not really take away anything as I was watching because of the excellent acting and cinematography.
I found this to be a first rate thriller, easily as good as the much more ballyhooed (and profitable) The Others, also released in 2001. Once again Guillermo del Toro has made a great movie with characters that you get to know very deeply and who gain your sympathy. Del Toro has also helmed the much more typical Hollywood fare, Mimic and Blade II. While I haven't yet seen Blade II, Mimic was at least a little more interesting than your average creature movie. But in small, low budget films such as Devils Backbone and Cronos, del Toro has found a niche that I hope he continues to be involved in.
The 1.85:1 picture on the dvd is great. A lot of the movie was filmed in darkish rooms and at night and everything was very crisp. Same with the Dolby Digital 5.1 sound: It sounds great. The film is in Spanish with English subtitles that were very easy to read. There is a making of feature that was pretty standard (i.e. nformative and entertaining), and a commentary by del Toro and cinematographer Guillermo Navarro. They mention that it is the first time that they have ever done a commentary and it kind of shows. It is informative, but fairly dry. I did not buy the dvd but rented it... It is a great movie and I wouldn't mind owning it, but it is not at the top of my list. Maybe if it gets discounted...I would consider buying it.",1039392000,4,4489,4.449029126213592
1701281,3,B00006420D,"Guillermo del Toro does a fantastic job of placing you in the small chaotic world of an orphanage on the brink of collapse.  Carlos (Fernando Tielve), a young boy, is the newest addition to the orphanage.  He is the outsider who begins to unravel the mysterious happenings going on behind the walls of the Spanish complex.  There is a bit of a ghost story here, but the main plot revolves around Carlos, and how this one boy, affects the fate of everyone at the orphanage.  I enjoyed the picture, and the atmosphere that del Toro presents to us.  Some of the characters seem a bit wooden, but overall the movie is entertaining, and keeps you glued to the end (even though it was pretty easy to figure out the mystery).",1036627200,,718,4.492307692307692
1701282,5,B00006420D,"In Spanish, with English subtitles, the setting is an orphanage in Spain during the Spanish Civil War.  It's a bleak place, run by a kindly impotent old man and the one-legged woman he loves.  When a new boy, named Carlito, is brought here, he goes through the usual torments of childhood petty rivalry.  But there is something more horrifying than the unexploded bomb in the courtyard or the meager food rations or the decrepit building or the unrelenting heat of the cruel sun.  There's a ghost here and it inhabits an eerie underground pool and permeates the atmosphere.
Against this background of a war gone wrong, everyone in the orphanage is in mortal danger.  As the mystery unfolds there is unrelenting violence with close up-shots of wounds and disfigurements and death. There is dripping water, sighs, and echoing footfalls.  I was definitely scared and disgusted. This is not a film for the squeamish. And yet the screenplay was excellent, the acting wonderful and the cinematography perfect.  I couldn't stand it and yet I know it was a fine film. Definitely a ""must-see"" for horror film lovers.",1033776000,3,1107,4.919354838709677
1701283,4,B00006420D,"The first scene of THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE demands attention. The camera is placed above an enormous aerial bomb, which, after its release, drops through the aircraft's bomb bay doors and descends through the night sky towards a large building. The doors close before we see the weapon hit ground.
It's 1939 in a Spain convulsed by civil war. Carlos (Fernando Tielve) is the son of a Republican fighter abandoned into tha care of a remote orphanage that specializes in harboring the sons of Repuplican warriors. Indeed, the governess of the place, Carmen (Marisa Paredes), states that when the Nationalists arrive, they'll find ""Reds taking care of Reds"". Carmen, the one-legged widow of a communist stalwart, is helped by the kindly Professor Casares (Federico Luppi). Upon his arrival, young Carlos must deal with the dominant male among the orphans, Jaime (igo Garcs), the bad-tempered handyman, Jacinto (Eduardo Noriega), the ghost of a dead boy, Santi (Junio Valverde), and the imposing hulk of a rusted bomb imbedded nose-down in the dirt of the courtyard. The point is made early on that the munition has been defused, but Jaime tells Carlos that one can hear its heart still ""ticking"". Additional atmosphere is provided by the gold ingots which may or may not be concealed in a hidden wall safe, the deformed fetuses which the Professor keeps in jars of very old (and tasty) rum, and the over-sized slugs which migrate to the edge of a murky pool (which contains only-God-knows what) in a ruined basement.
Every one of the characters in THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE is effectively played, though most of them remained curiously detached from this viewer's sympathies. Professor Casares, an amateur poet, was, in my mind, the one best scripted to evoke some degree of emotional attachment and goodwill. Perhaps the film's finest scene was the last dialog between Casares and Carmen. Tielve earns admiration as the plucky Carlos, who must first cope with his abandonment, then bad food, Jaime's bullying, a terror-filled hazing of sorts, an unfortunate bed location, the pesky attentions of the phantasm, and finally worse. The tension is effectively heightened by the ominous presence of The Bomb, which represented, I think, the contextual concept of destruction and death waiting to happen. While it's certainly macabre, I didn't find the film as creepy as, say, THE OTHERS (Nicole Kidman, 2001). Perhaps it's the difference beween English Gothic and Spanish Gothic. But THE DEVIL""S BACKBONE is certainly worth seeing as a change of pace to the mindless thrillers that are over-represented in the video outlets.",1030838400,2,2609,5.141176470588236
1701284,5,B00006420D,"This is a beautiful film that I discovered through recommendations here.  It lived up to those accolades.  Only the Europeans seem capable of telling ghost stories on one level yet also combining dramatic elements from the tangible world on other levels within the same film.  Here the Spanish Civil War is underway and this one orphanage acts as the focal point for the violence and brutality at large in Spain at the time.

Eduardo Noriega (II) is as good here as he was in ""Open Your Eyes.""  He is the villain of the piece from the first moment you see him but he is a deeply layered villain and Noriega presents his full complexity beautifully.  The children are wonderful in the story and the episodes with the ghost child will have you on the edge of your seat.  This is no American mad slasher film though.  It is a fully realized beautifully told tale of righting wrongs in a world gone mad.

1701286,5,B00006420D,"I'm not going to tell you what this film is about, plenty of others have done that already. Instead, I will tell you that this is a beautifully paced and constructed work of art. The acting is brilliant, the sets and scenery are brilliant; it is a very, very European film. Very intimate, very focussed, and absolutely perfect. For me to watch an entire film in Spanish, in which I am relatively but not completely fluent, with no subtitles, better believe it has to be exceptional. It is a very simple story, but so exceedingly well done that it captivates the watcher and draws him or her in.
Funny thing. I told my oldest daughter, who was raised in Spain and now is married and lives in New York to get this movie. She called me up last night and said, ""Eduardo Noriega is a GOD!"" Yeah, so for you girls out there who like really hunky guys, think Noriega. He also starred in Abre Los Ojos, the original and very good version of that turkey, Vanilla Sky.

1701289,4,B00006420D,"Well directed by Guillermo Del Toro, this is a stylish, Spanish gothic film with remarkable performances by the entire cast. The entire film takes place during the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s in a remote, ramshackle school in the middle of nowhere that houses boys who have been displaced by the war. Many of them are orphans. An unexploded bomb, courtesy of the fascists, lies half buried in the courtyard of the school, a stark reminder of what is happening beyond the boundaries of this isolated spot.

One such boy, Carlos (Fernando Tielve), who is unaware that his father was killed in the war, is brought to the school by his tutor and left in the care and custody of its one legged headmistress, Carmen (Marisa Paredes). A Leftist, she is a passionate woman who has been funding the Left in its losing battle against the fascists. Cesares (Federico Luppi), one of the professors at the school, is a kindly, older man who befriends the bereft and bewildered Carlos. He is also an incurable romantic, in love with and devoted to Carmen, yet too much of a gentleman to consummate his passion for her. She. too, however, has a secret passion, and it is not him.

As the new kid on the block, Carlos attracts the attention of the school bully, Jaime (Inigo Garces), but manages to hold his own against the bigger and older boy. It is just as well, as there is something else going on at the school that demands both their attention. It seems that Santi (Junio Valverde), a boy who has been classified as missing, is eerily making his presence felt. Moreover, the school handyman, Jacinto (Eduardo Noriega), the handsome ""prince without a kingdom"", much like the devil himself,  appears to be up to no good, while Conchita (Irene Visedo), the school's young housekeeper, has set her cap for him.

Amidst the war, the haunting, and the destructive violence of Jacinto, Carlos unexpectedly comes of age. Jaime, who is part of Carlos' rite of passage, matures into a natural leader. What they must face together will ultimately bind them in friendship. This is a complex, multi-layered film, dealing with themes of anger, betrayal, greed, love, and hate, all of which are played out and lead to the stunning climactic ending.

Marisa Paredes gives a rich, three dimensional performance, as Carmen, a woman who is tired by the ongoing civil war and who finds herself questioning the leftist cause, the very cause that she financially supports, while harboring a secret passion. Federico Luppi imbues his character, Cesares, with a depth of emotion that simmers just below the surface, as well as with an old-fashioned grace that is touching. Eduardo Noriego, as Jacinto, gives an emotional portrayal of evil, yet manages to infuse a certain poignancy in his character. The children all give very good performances. This deftly directed, well acted film is worth watching.

The DVD offers a widescreen version of the film with first rate audio and visuals. Along with a commentary by the director and the cinematographer, it offers an interesting featurette on the making of the film from the point of view of the director, Guillermo Del Toro. This is a DVD well worth having.",1027728000,5,3175,4.837937384898711
