No feldman to speak of ; thank goodness
The greatest difference between both of them is Haim could carry a movie ; feldman never could .",1360627200,,171,4.375
7854857,5,6303601219,"I personally love this film, I find it touching and sweet. maybe you have to be a fan of Corey haim to enjoy it, he played Ramsey in such a way I found myself glued to the TV, it also has some really funny bits in it. Well worth watching if you like Corey haim, and if you don't worth watching anyway.",1235865600,,301,3.870967741935484
7854858,5,6303601219,"I really hope all these other reviewers are kidding when they say this movie teaches ""life lessons"". Life 101 is one of a number of moves Corey Haim made trying to get his career on track after his drug problems. If you honestly like this movie be sure to check out Prayer of the Rollerboys and National Lampoon's Last Resort.

 At any rate, this movie is my pick for the worst movie ever made. Well, perhaps it ties with Grease 2 (they're very close) . Then why am I giving it 5 stars? Because I LOVE bad movies. And this isn't one of those bad ones you never want to see again, it's soooo horridly bad you can watch it a million times and it's still just as fun.

 This movie sucks, SEE IT!",1091318400,6,692,4.141791044776119

7854860,5,6303601219,"I must say this has gotta be a great movie to watch i bought this because i like Haim movie's and i was pleased this really is good stuff the storyline is a classic its set in the 60s plus it has Keith Coogan from Dont Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead and he is a class act in this one as Ramsey's (Haim) closes't friend on campus. The storyline's climax is an upsetting one to send shiver's down your spine as you feel sorry for the character's and the ending is very unpredictable for the viewer,Ramsey's female interest isn't played that bad by Ami Dolenz coz she is a real cutie and i thought they all played good role's and for people who read this reveiw you gotta buy this it is one of Haim's,Coogan's and Dolenz's good movie's try it out.",1010966400,,744,4.246478873239437
