4717880,5,B005KK2FTO,My husband and I are of the older generation and watched this show when it first started. You have to have an open mind and just sit back and enjoy. It had some very heart warming show's besides some that might not be to your liking. When Gloria lost her baby was one of the most touching shows they had. I have not regretted buying the set of videos and we enjoy watching them all over again.,1365120000,3,393,4.116883116883117

4717902,5,B005KK2FTO,"My husband and I are watching this for the first time around. We were just young kids when they were on for real.  We got rid of cable TV and we are watching shows from the 70's.  It is nice not to have commercials.  It is also interesting to see they had the same problems in the 70's that we have now.  It is just labeled different.  They have war, pollution, violence, and gun control.  Many others.  We sit and laugh and his kids come running to see what we are laughing at.  But like us...when we were their age...they won't get the humor.",1385510400,3,544,4.163461538461538

Sadly there is not much on TV that is decent for good Christian People to watch anymore????  So have a choice of either not watching TV or watching the older DVD's that are good shows.

Thank you that we have this choice.",1366761600,4,442,4.0344827586206895
