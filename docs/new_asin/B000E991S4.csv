2510780,5,B000E991S4,"Let me get the technical details out of the way first. The transfer is superb, picture quality excellent, sound excellent and it's letterboxed so you get it in the original ""drive-in"" aspect ratio. The only technical detail in ""Creation..."" that's sub-par is they needed better proofreading for the subtitles. There are a few errata, and if, like me, you use the subtitles, that can make the brain itch.

""Creation"" itself, however, remains eminently watchable and utterly undated. Yes, it's a low-budget ""B"" movie. But the sets are acceptable, and the acting and dialogue at least as good as any TV series of the early 60s. There wasn't a note anywhere in this that sounds out of place in the story. NOTHING in this film strained the cables on my suspension of disbelief.

But as science-fiction, this movie shines like a well-lit diamond for thoughtfulness of script, philosophical depths explored, and some very human and HUMANE moments. I've never been able to forget the line about ""Irony, the funniest form of humor."" since the first time I watched this film back in the sixties. When I found out later in the story just what Pax (a Clicker) meant by that comment and the joyous peal of laughter which accompanied it, I agreed with him, and laughed like hell.

And wait for a line that begins ""Only the memory..."" For that line alone, I would have bought this picture, because that line, perfectly delivered by Don Doolittle, contains the true humility that marks all real scientific endeavorers. It also raises philosophical questions that haunt me to this day.

I can't speak of ""War Between the Planets"". I found it unwatchable.

But I don't care. I've wanted a GOOD copy of ""Creation of the Humanoids"" in my collection even before I knew a collection was possible, and now I have it. Both my budget and my time are at a premium, but this incarnation of that picture is worth every penny I spent getting it, and every wonderful minute watching it. In my opinion, this is one of the five best science-fiction movies of all time.",1164326400,41,2036,4.756373937677054
2510781,4,B000E991S4,"I purchased the DVD for ""Creation of the Humanoids."" I was pleased by the quality of the movie as well as the entertaining extras on the disk. Over the years, I had forgotten the other movie, ""War between the Planets."" Since most good sci fi movies don't go beyond a B movie, no need to nitpick on why neither movie won an Oscar.

These two movies might be packaged together for opposites between them. First, rich special effects in `Planets' almost make up for a weak story and predictable action scenes. In contrast, `Humanoids' presents a very strong story, adequate effects, but simplistic scenery. The stark backgrounds in `Humanoids' scenes look cheap at first. Yet, the simplicity seems a deliberate way to focus attention on the sometimes-deep dialogue and excellent acting as robots.

`Humanoids' starts by explaining that a small percentage of humanity survives the big nuclear war. Over time, civilization carries on but faces slow death from a low rate of healthy births per man/woman ""contract."" Humans, and the robots programmed to serve them, adjust to the realization of slow death. People either accept robots or violently oppose their increasing complexity. Unlike Star Trek's ""What Are Little Girls Made Of"" (original TV series) where a robot is a piece of property incapable of genuine emotion, `Humanoids' takes the opposite track. A woman purchases a robot/butler/companion and pays extra for him to have a sense of humor. Even though machines lack vision, he says that no one asks to be created.

While robots in movies such as ""Star Wars"" or ""Westworld"" entertain, ""Creation of the Humanoids"" positions itself as a thought-provoking but fun experience at or near the top of robot stories. I give this B movie an A+ for science fiction. ""Creation of the Humanoids"" is a must-have for any robot fan.",1152748800,16,1822,5.006600660066007
2510782,4,B000E991S4,"I'll second everything that :Bob Eggleton said, and add that the video quality on this DVD - particularly for ""Creation of the Humanoids"" is very good.

There are muddy DVD and VHS copies of this movie available elsewhere, but I believe that they are dubs of  the 1985 Sun Cost VHS that had a bad edit glitch near the beginning.

This version is much cleaner and and sharper. It looks like a transfer from the original film. It  still has the glitch, but it's almost imperceptible.

""Creation of the Humanoids"" really is a rough gem - almost everything about it is poorly done - yet the movie WORKS. When it's done, the story sticks with you. It's great SF.

Antonio Margheriti's ""War of the Planets"" is fun to watch. The rest of the Quadrology is available on DVD as well; one or two  appear on the ""SciFi Classics Collection: 50 Movie Pack""

2510783,4,B000E991S4,"CREATION OF THE HUMANOIDS is perhaps one of the most creative and low-budgeted films ever made. Despite it's B film title, zero budget, it has alot of good ideas in it that sound alot like Asimov's laws of robotics at one point. The film is light years ahead of it's time in predicting the dilemma of what happens when robots-created by Man-think on their own, have feelings and start to make decisions-contrary to Man. And how even a ""fundamentalist"" order of humans arises from this threat and what happens when they clash. There is no action to speak of, it all comes of like a play done on minimalist sets, but shot in blazing technicolor. The acting is surprisingly well done if slightly overdone in parts. I only ever saw this on a fuzzy UHF showing in the l970's, and never saw it again-or it's ""twist"" ending which comes out of the blue. The print is quite good-gets better as it goes along, the opening credits are a bit scratchy however.  The second feature WAR BETWEEN THE PLANETS (AKA PLANETS AGAINST US) is the fourth in Antonio Margheriti's Italian space opera quartet(Previous entries were WAR OF THE PLANETS, WILD WILD PLANET and THE SNOW DEVILS) and has lots of Italian eye-candy gals and macho men in the same outfits seen in the last three films and all revolving, kind of around the Gamma One Space Station but this is one of the lackluster in action of that set of films,compared to say the really fun WILD WILD PLANET(Walter Manley, the producer on this, would later take his space station concept to Japan and make THE GREEN SLIME, in essentially the same universe, but now Space Station Gamma Three). The print on this one is from the theaterical release by Fanfare Films in 1971 that played at mostly drive-ins back in the day with what I remember was a huge ad campaign. That said, it's a fairly nice print and, the whole film is *narrated* by Norman Rose-a voice announcer who worked for NBC in the 1970's and did the introduction to DESTROY ALL MONSTERS(the AIP version) as well as Promise Butter ads.

2510784,3,B000E991S4,"Two movies for the price of one!

One a rather cheesy allegory for racism that plays rather like a dime store Twilight Zone feature length episode in color than anything else and the other, one of the lesser entries in the Italian Gamma 1 series.

Creation of the Humanoids can be respected for tackling race in it's Scifi movie, though yeah it's a B-movie and it's really cheap. And really Roger Corman could do it better and cheaper usually.

It's still an interesting watch.

War Between the Planets aka Planet on the Prowl aka il pianeta errante aka Mission Wandering Planet is the third in the Gamma 1 series of films made with Antonio Margheriti and a another production with Walter Manley and Ivan Reiner.

Giacomo Rossi Stuart (Last Man on Earth) takes over from Tony Russel as the lead and Ombretta Colli (The Blancheville Monster) takes over for Lisa Gastoni.

Basically War Between has a new set of similar characters to the last two.

Except even with the run time of this movie being shorter than the last movie at 77 minutes in counting, the movie is actually slower than the last one. Due to the fact a lot of talking occurs during the movie, in fact this version of the movie apparently snips some of the talking out of the original version as well as the original credits to the movie that took place over the rather impressive if totally toy future city. The Italian version apparently clocks in at 82 minutes according to the version I watched. Shots were re-arranged and the score was changed apparently.

Probably the most heavily changed of the series when it was brought over to America as the other entries basically went by unscathed. And I can't say the edits to the movie hinder or help the movie, I don't understand Italian much, so I couldn't tell what was said. The plot line though reminds me again of a Toho science fiction movie, in particular Gorath, except Gorath had better special effects and wasn't as boring. It's kind of like how War of the Planets reminded me partially of Battle in Outer Space with the similar plot line of aliens mind controlling humans to do their bidding. Probably the worst problem with this and War of the Planets, is the lack of an original plot to it, compared to even Wild, Wild Planet, The Snow Devils or even the unofficial sequel The Green Slime.

Still a very pleasant old school science fiction movie, if a rather slow with it's various talking scenes that I guess thankfully were sometimes curtailed in the American version probably for good reason.",1461110400,,2522,4.649438202247191

2510793,2,B000E991S4,"SPOILER WARNING

Creation of the Humanoids is a low budget film from 1962, about a post-apocalyptic society trying to survive with the help of intelligent robots, disparagingly known as Clickers. A group obviously modelled on the KKK, the Order of Flesh and Blood, sees the androids as a threat to humankind. The Order harasses and attacks Clickers on a semi-regular basis.

In reality, the Clickers are aiding humanity by resurrecting dead humans in android bodies. The neo-humans (or neo-androids) can survive the increased levels of radiation in the atmosphere, and even procreate. The leader of the Order eventually learns that he, too, is really an android. In the closing scene, the mad scientist (who turns out to be a good guy) reveals that the plot is set in mankind's past, not the future, and that *we* are the descendants of the Clickers

Thank you.

2510800,3,B000E991S4,"(The War Between the Planets)
As for the Terran forces in this fight, we're not talking Roman legions here--though the lead-character commander does have the gait of a megamacho gladiator.  His dreadful wig adds to the comic-book (and comical) look of this silly space opera, which pits the Blue Planet against a glowing red asteroid that breathes,  circulates blood, and belches vapor.  Unfortunately, this potentially interesting bug bobs up late in the action, which consists largely of space-walky stunts and squabbling among the regimented denizens of a space station.  Apparently, the military branch of the United Democracies has gotten a little too democratic, to judge by the insubordination, non-regulation behavior, and lack of leadership displayed by these service members.  Possibly the movie's slipshod dubbing is a big part of the problem, but there can be little or nothing lost to an Anglophone in the depiction of a fistfight between the commander and a captain.  The former, who somehow outranks the latter, simply shrugs the matter off.  This C.O., in fact, regularly succumbs to wheedling by underlings and even tells one subordinate that he would ""prefer"" he not do something!
Like many space movies of past decades, this one is made unintentionally diverting by pseudoscience and objects and actions that would be obsolete in societies capable of interstellar travel.  The characters communicate via telephones that have punch-in numbers on their bases.  They use hatchets to cut the veins of the asteroid creature.  And they transport from their rocketship to the rotating station by ""swimming"" through space!
The feature contains not a single scene that is not made humorous by ridiculous dialogue, absurd actions, and/or facetious-looking special effects.

2510803,4,B000E991S4,"Here is my review for 'Creation of the Humanoids':

This film has about 3 or so changes of scene, has only 1 fist fight, tells almost all the story with dialogue, and the events transpire in something very close to real time.  In other words, the script has every appearance of being written first as a play...it would be interesting to find out if it ever was performed as such, and an enterprising group of thespians could easily produce this as a play.

This unique feature of this movie, rather than being a shortcoming, I see as a virtue.  This is due to the fact that the script is extremely literate and well-crafted.  This film has a lot to say about the nature of humanity, of God, and of the soul.  And many of the messages are somewhat cryptic.  Despite the more ambiguous themes, this film provides and a clear commentary upon the issues of civil rights as they were unfolding in 1962, and gazes forward through time to our present societal difficulties with sexual tolerance.

Despite being shot on an obviously microscopic budget, this film
manages to convey an otherwordly mood, thus facilitating the willing
suspension of disbelief. The sets and costumes are often silly or
ridiculous, and there are no spectacular battles, explosions, or space
flights. Nonetheless, the creators, cast and crew turned out an
interesting and thought-provoking story.

A few dollars were wisely spent obtaining the services of make-up
virtuoso Jack Pierce, of Frankenstein fame, who created a subtle yet
effective look for the androids, a look that quietly reinforces themes.
The androids are simultaneously different, and yet the same, as humans.

Don't watch this if your major attraction to scifi is FX or space opera. But if you are interested in exploring some of themes of literary scifi, this film is a fascinating artifact.",1292544000,2,1829,4.909090909090909

War Between the Planets was made overseas. I am not sure if it is an Italian film or not. The movie has dubbed English. Not hard to follow, but the movie is endless campy space talk which sounds good but makes no sense.
A very slow plot with poor special effects. The actors have attitudes, which was part of the film, but doesn't seem to work right.  Not much story here at all.  Not recommended for a true B-sci-fi lover.
The Humanoids movie was better, but slow. No action at all in this film. There is a pretty good story but if you want action or for the Humanoids to move, you will be disappointed.
The Humanoids do look great and they did a good job of them. I did like the story but it moves along slowly.  No music, good video of the atomic explosions, just not much ""movement"" on the actors parts. Oh sure they punch and get into small fights but that is limited.

2510805,5,B000E991S4,"As a devotee of sci-fi, I was rather shocked that I had never seen ""Creation of the Humanoid"" (COTH) on television proir to about a years ago.  I only caught the last 45 minutes of it, but I was so impressed that I immediately bought the dual-movie disc.  As with other reviewers, I found the gem to be COTH, with ""War of the Planets"" watchable only with the sound off. Spaghetti and sci-fi apparently don't mix very well.

COTH, however, was an utterly engrossing film.  The atmosphere comes off as more like viewing a stage play than that of watching a movie(a comment made by previous reviewer, as well, I believe), yet it is very effective concept -- somehow lending another layer of ""realism"" to the conversations.  The film's sets are an effective composite of light and dark -- dimly-lit, futuristic-looking cityscape backdrops, in contrast to brightly lit rooms or, in the case of the meeting of ""The Order of Flesh and Blood"" (...blood works through the ages) speakers under bright spotlights (with connotations of fascism) in front of a dark room of supporters seen only in silhouette.

Much of the wardrobe spoke of a highly-advanced, space-faring humanity -- of order and discipline.

By the way, before I forget, the page for this product states COTH was made in 1962.  In fact, the copyright line displayed in the movie says ""MCMLX,"" which is 1960.  It is impressive, to say the least, that the dialog for this movie was scripted FIFTY years ago (by Jay Simms).  How many people, much less screenplay writers, even thought in terms of the issues addressed in COTH?

The film touches on the issue of the obliteration of achievement by mankind through humanity's ever-increasing dependence on ever-increasingly intelligent and helpful machines.  Other ideas explored include the melding of man and machine and what actually constitutes the essence of a person.  In the words of Don Doolittle (Dr. Raven), ""Who created your creator?""  Whether you ultimately view the end of the story as pessimistic or unrealistic will likely be rooted in that question.

Thoroughly watchable and re-watchable -- particularly with friends who remember when sci-fi storylines and dialog of that time meant something on the order of ""Attack of the 50-Foot Zombie Crab.""

It is rare to find an intelligent film that deals with deep questions of consciousness, identity, the human-machine relationship, and the future of the human race.  It is downright astonishing to discover one made in the early 60s that does so--but COTH is that film.  Indeed, it is not until at least 20 years later (with the making of ""Blade Runner"") that more modern, high budget films began to grapple with these issues in a serious way.  COTH does this very effectively, even discounting the handicaps of low budget production, cheesy special effects, and B-grade, wooden actors.  It does it by means of an incredibly well thought out, coherent script that emphasizes ideas rather than action and special effects.  There are also a number of sophisticated twists--both expected and unexpected.  As a Computer Science professor, I try to play this movie for my classes once per semester.  When I show it, there is typically is a collective groan at the start of the film.  However, after a half hour or so, the students are held rapt.  By the end, the students are surprised and appreciative--usually lining up to tell me how good the film was and asking more questions about it.  On a side note, the film is quite humorous in places for unintended reasons--typically due to the antiquated, early 60s attitudes.  This is especially true when you notice the strict attention to detail the Clickers give the male 'replacement' robots to make them identical to their human doubles.  In contrast, they don't hesitate to make the female replacement more attractive (thinner) than the original.",1266019200,4,1653,4.945652173913044

This is a ""must-have"" for all collectors of ""B"" (for BAD) cinema.  It is a guilty pleasure!",1214265600,,626,4.594594594594595
2510810,5,B000E991S4,"""Creation of the Humanoids"" is one of those vaguely-remembered films from my boyhood that I never could find over the years, but then it popped up on Amazon.

COTH is slower-paced than a lot of sci-fi movies, so don't expect much action here, but it has an interesting look and a feel all it's own, almost in the same way that ""Invaders from Mars"" does. The plot is basically a warning against bigotry, done in a way that doesn't simplify or demonize any of the characters, and unfolds gradually.

If you like classic sci-fi, but with a thoughtful storyline and some intelligent dialogue, this is a good film to get. I'm not sure what younger viewers would make of it, however.

""War Between the Planets"" struck me as filler, and I couldn't watch more than a few minutes of it.",1211760000,,777,4.535714285714286
2510811,4,B000E991S4,"(SPOILER ALERT FOR THE MOVIES, CREATION OF THE HUMANOIDS, INPOSTER, BLADE RUNNER, ROBO COP AND THE SIXTH SCENSE, AS WELL AS THE PHILLIP K. DICK NOVEL, DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP)

CREATION OF THE HUMANOIDS, can be taken one of two ways, either as a low budget, Ed Woodesque type film, with stiff, stilted acting, minimalist sets, and a total lack of action, or, as a precursor to the type of thought provoking films as, Imposter and Blade Runner (from the Phillip K. Dick novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep) where the question of artificial beings as the next step in the evolution of the human species, and what makes one human, are explored.

I was kind of worried at first that this film might turn out to be the former, a bad ""B"" movie of the lowest regards, after reading mixed reviews on amazon.com, and other review sites, but upon finishing the film, I was quite taken in by the whole experience.

First off, the over all tone of the film and it's minimalist sets, kind of reminds me of a Star Trek episode (even though this predates Star Trek by several years) in that sets are fine for what they are meant to be, nothing over the top, but not the inane cardboard sets that some have suggested that they resemble, either.

As for the acting, Star Trek is also brought to mind, and no, not in the over the top, Shatner school of acting, acting, but more in the guest stars kind of performances, in that they're not Emmy contenders, but do get the job done.

It's kind of odd, but once you get into what the movie is trying to convey, you really look past the budget and acting, and actually get emotionally involved with the story, a story that brings into question the same things that Blade Runner would tackle, 20 years later.

Imposter, raised the same sort of questions years later by gifting a humanoid robot with memories, and making it think that it was human.

CREATION OF THE HUMANOIDS, also had a nice little twist ending (M. Night Shyamalan, might have gotten a few ideas from this film as far as, The Sixth Scenes, is concerned) even past the main twist ending, which quite caught me off guard, and had me smiling, in spite of myself.

This was a definite find.

As for the second film, WAR BETWEEN THE PLANETS, I haven't watched this one, as of yet, and so, cannot comment on it, but the disc is well worth the price for, CREATION OF THE HUMANOIDS.",1197504000,,2387,4.456422018348624
2510812,3,B000E991S4,"Creation of the Humanoids is one of the worst directed smart films in history -- Even bad movie director Ed Wood could not be this bad. Yet, for all the incompetence (including much ""off camera mic"" sound work), the story is a smart and thoughtful one. It has been mentioned that Blade Runner is style over content (with a big budget) and Creation of the Humanoids is content without the competence to pull it off. Worth a look (and, more to the point, listen) to the very intelligent ideas presented, but you will not believe how badly it is executed. As for the second feature, War Between the Planets, you will likely want to give it a miss.",1197504000,3,644,4.466101694915254
2510813,4,B000E991S4,"This DVD contains two obscure sci-fi titles of the early 60's, ""Creation of the Humanoids"" (1962) and ""War Between the Planets"" (1966).  Ironically, the distributors have paired a lost gem in the true spirit and meaning of the science fiction genre against a worthless bore fest that can only attempt to look the part.

""Creation of the Humanoids"" is an intimate tale of an earth with a dying human population.  But humanoids have been developed as servants, and are now rivaling the humans in population as well as abilities, characteristics, and appearance.

This movie is not a thriller, not a staging ground for great battles, not a vehicle for superheroes.  Its special effects are minimal (but do the job, in my opinion.) Rather, it is a shining example of what science fiction does best, and is truly meant to do: to explore our human condition by depicting man in extraordinary, other-worldly environments and circumstances.

The film explores the definition of life, the meaning of consciousness, prejudice, the essence of romance -- and all in a simple story with no wasted scenes or dialog.  One cleverly constructed conversation between a human and a humanoid forces us to stop and think, just what is the scope of God's creation?  And the humanoids manage to have more charm and wit, with their pupil-less eyes and gray-green skin, than their human counterparts -- an early achievement of this now familiar persona in sci-fi films.

No, it's not slick, but you'll watch it at least twice once the full plot has been revealed.  A terrific little film, and a must-see.

""War Between the Planets"" is an English-language Italian film (with a misleading English title) having no redeeming qualities.  It takes itself too seriously, the characters are full of themselves, the dialog is contrived, and it is basically unwatchable.

But if you're a true sci-fi fan, don't miss ""Creation of the Humanoids"".",1195516800,4,1910,5.006329113924051

So, without affecting my rating for the Humanoids, I give this a 5 on Amazon's scale.  Humanoids is a classic sci-fi gem.  It would make a wonderful stage production but in today's high tech, all about special effects world, it would probably bomb.  If you appreciate sci-fi at its best, and enjoyed the TV series ""The Twilight Zone"", Creation of the Humanoids is for you.  Well worth the cost.

War of the Planets has a weak script which is propped up by Antonio Margheriti's great directing and the beautiful costumes, sets, and ingenious use of miniatures that remind me of early Star Trek. Creation of the Humanoids is a more interesting film which seems to succeed on an even cheaper budget with nice use of matte paintings and simple objects to make sets and costumes more believable. One of my favorite parts are the vintage trailers and ads for concessions that play before the movies when you watch them together like a double feature. This gave me a really fun time, definitely worth a rewatch.",1501286400,,655,4.754385964912281
