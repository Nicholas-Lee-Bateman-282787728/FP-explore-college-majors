5581513,5,B00BDSRMAO,"Real drama, pathos, human emotions. Amazingly well written and acted. My wife and I were absolutely engrossed from the first minutes.",1369872000,,133,5.380952380952381
5581514,5,B00BDSRMAO,"If this was a novel, it would be a bestseller, then adapted into a mini-series.
The Syndicate, a grocery lottery ticket buying group, wins. How will millions change 5 lives, and those closest to them. It's what we ask ourselves while scratching tickets, or checking numbers, praying for THE BIG WIN. This 2012 TV series vividly details the price of wealth. Kudos to the writer (also sometimes director, producer) Kay Mellor.

The Syndicate is a character study extraordinaire. You become enraptured with 5 leading roles, plus people close to them. Viewer emotions may include hate, love, endearment, despair, disdain, and more. You WILL be moved. The lucky winners: Brothers Jamie (Matthew Lewis- Harry Potter) & Stuart (Matthew McNulty- Lark Rise to Candleford); Leanne (Joanna Page- Love Actually); Denise (Lorraine Bruce); and Mgr Bob (Timothy Spall- King's Speech). Series filled with star actors.

SDH SUBTITLES optional for five 54min hard-pausing-between episodes.
_ _ _ Episode #1 Right Buy U Mkt is bought out, workers financially strapped. Mgr Bob is ill. Brothers, desperate for cash, take matters into their own hands. Toss in Amy's (Amy Beth Hayes- hot) preemie birth, assault, and a huge lottery win, and were off an adventure.
 _ _ _ Ep #2 Denise's hubby walks leaving her with a sick Mam (Judy Parfitt- Call the Midwife). Obese Denise spends winnings on a body do-over to lure hubby back during the Tom Jones singing of ""She's a Lady"". He returns for the money, but with a huge surprise. Bob's health worsens. Police investigate the market robbery suspecting an inside job.
_ _ _ Ep #3 Stuart visits Bob, confessing a truth Bob suspected. Bob's live-in Annie (Katherine Dow Blyton) finds a So. African Dr who might save Bob's life, but again Bob has his own surprise. Plenty of hoopla exposed by others too.
_ _ _ Ep #4 Bob's party finds Stuart and Leanne sharing intimacies. Leanne's daughter's disappearance begins a `runner.' Jamie helps rumors fly and Amy turns jealous. And more.
_ _ _ Ep #5 Bob & Annie return to Leeds (actual UK filming location) discovering Jamie living high. Bros, Amy, & Leanne are in a relationship quandary. Cops are all over the place, and action gets fast and furious leading to major conclusions for the Syndicate Quintet.

A 2nd Syndicate season was commissioned. Same writer/director with a hospital lottery syndicate looking for a financial windfall to change more lives. YES!",1363996800,3,2427,5.0

5581524,4,B00BDSRMAO,"An interesting story of five lottery winners. For Americans, the accents can get pretty thick, but close captioning is available (star key on Roku). It's a drama not a comedy.",1411084800,,175,4.866666666666666

5581526,5,B00BDSRMAO,"The premise for the show is interesting. In Season 1, you follow the lives of the people who together won the lottery Big Time. Their stories unfold in the following episodes, and they are complex. I was very involved with them all. Then in Season 2, it is totally new group of people who win Big Time; and you follow their lives, etc. I wish there were closed captions because the accents are quite thick, but I certainly followed it along.

5581534,4,B00BDSRMAO,"Thoroughly enjoyable, a 5 part series, each episode featuring one of five lottery winners and how their lives are effected. And much of it is not pretty, health problems, marital difficulties, overspending, and even a kidnapped child! A great character study, well done as usual by British tv (not sure if this is BBC or ITV). Recommended for those who like great characterization.",1406073600,,381,5.063492063492063
5581535,5,B00BDSRMAO,Loved this series. It really provoked me to think ... especially after the last episode. It really was surprisingly compelling viewing.,1406073600,,135,5.476190476190476

5581537,5,B00BDSRMAO,"You have to ask yourself, what would I do if I won I won the lottery with a group of my pals?  What would you do in the situations given in this series?  How would your relationships run their course?  Could I trust any one in my life with my fragile heart?  I Don't know how this would play out in my life, How about your life?  Would it change things?  This series is a just watch and then think about it.",1405382400,,407,3.902439024390244

5581539,4,B00BDSRMAO,Characters are extremely well-fleshed out and well-defined and  plots are reasonably believable. I really like this series. -- it's much better than I expected.  Yay!,1403827200,,166,5.6
5581540,5,B00BDSRMAO,"Wow these 5 episodes blew me away, the show follows 5 lottery ticket winners and the glum stuff going on in their lives. Really engaging and made me laugh and cry many times.  Its a drama but NOT sappy and NOT chick flick",1403568000,,221,4.1395348837209305
5581541,4,B00BDSRMAO,"I was brought to this series through recommendations after watch Gavin and Stacey. It is definitely not a comedy, which is what I expected, coming from recommendations from a comedy series. I liked how each episode focused on a different character.",1403395200,,248,5.073170731707317
5581542,4,B00BDSRMAO,The characters in the drama are all well drawn and fleshed out. We've all heard similar stories about lottery winners going off the rails. This shows encapsulates them all.,1403395200,,172,4.9655172413793105
5581543,5,B00BDSRMAO,"My wife said ""why do you want to look at a show re the lottery"" after the first episode she couldn't wait to see more. This was a funny, sensitive and suspensfull show. Highly recommend, the manager of the store was a great actor.",1403308800,,230,4.25
5581544,4,B00BDSRMAO,Like most BBC drama series this show has a great plot and interesting characters. I will definitely watch the second season when available.,1402185600,,139,5.086956521739131

5581546,4,B00BDSRMAO,"This show reminds me quite a bit of ""Shameless"".  Characters are well-developed and and believable.  Of course, the situations are quite stretched, but still interesting.  Season 1 left plenty of stories hanging to where I am quite excited to see Season 2.",1400371200,,256,5.0476190476190474
5581547,4,B00BDSRMAO,A great show to kill some time with. Nice story line and good characters. Well done for a short budget tv show.,1398902400,,111,4.090909090909091

5581553,3,B00BDSRMAO,I enjoyed this story of a group of people who win a big lottery and how it changed their lives. It was different as each person is different and their needs and/or wants change not always for the better.,1396828800,,203,4.230769230769231
5581554,5,B00BDSRMAO,Well written and well executed.  The characters are average joes trying to squeak by and keep their lives somewhat intact in spite of their own mistakes and dysfunctional family.  Most of the characters are ill-equipped to handle a stroke of good luck when it comes their way.  Watching this series is always entertaining!,1396828800,,322,5.037735849056604
5581555,5,B00BDSRMAO,"Loved watching every episode.  I had to get accustom to the accents and phrasing, but it was totally worth it.  The characters weren't perfect people, they were real people with real problems and dealt with their problems their way.",1396569600,,232,4.923076923076923
5581556,5,B00BDSRMAO,"Very entertaining.  Great to see money can't buy happiness, but still..,
Only flaw was that it seemed like a couple of the players had gone through the amount they won in the first week.
Next season the group wins higher prizes to make it more believable.",1396137600,,255,4.543478260869565

5581559,4,B00BDSRMAO,"I'm a huge fan of English TV.  They seems to get it right.  This was very good, and showed how dysfunction is only heightened by money!  Nice to watch a series without four letter words (there might have been one!).  Check out series 2 on Hulu, if you can stand the ads, every few minutes.  Series 2 was more morbid, but still worth watching.",1395100800,,342,4.28125
5581560,5,B00BDSRMAO,"Funny and touching, the characters vary from adorable to despicable and the plot stays on the right side of unlikely",1395014400,,116,4.85
5581561,5,B00BDSRMAO,"We'll cast and great subplots. Wished for more, but perfect arc. Some old faces and lots of new good ones",1394409600,,105,4.3
5581562,2,B00BDSRMAO,Can not understand the dialogue due to accent and mumbling and frankly they are all sort of lumps and bumps of characters.,1394064000,,122,4.590909090909091
5581563,5,B00BDSRMAO,"I watched the American Version (Rubbish deserving of early cancellation) and watched this series only to see if it was as bad. But it was GREAT. I really cared about the characters and what happened to them. And there was a message about money and its potentially destructive effects. Greatest line: ""The money didn't change me; it changed the people around me.""",1393545600,,362,4.854838709677419
5581564,5,B00BDSRMAO,"Laughed, cried and felt warmhearted as if I was part of the show.  Great show, bring on Season 2 soon.",1393372800,,102,4.1
5581565,5,B00BDSRMAO,I really enjoyed this show. The characters (and acting) were believable and it was easy to feel for them. I highly recommend taking the time to get to know this show. You won't be disappointed!,1393027200,,193,4.542857142857143
5581566,5,B00BDSRMAO,"What better show is there! They pulled me in very quickly, and just let me go like a bad first date.",1392854400,,100,3.8095238095238093
5581567,5,B00BDSRMAO,"I am a fan of British productions,and this one did not disappoint. The acting is great and the story line keeps your interest.",1391990400,,126,4.521739130434782
5581568,5,B00BDSRMAO,"If you've ever wondered how your life might change if you won the lottery, THIS is the program for you! In Series 1, the five main characters all work for a failing convenience store in a Leeds. The manager, Bob Davies, is a father figure to the staff but is secretly ailing. Cashier Denise is a dog-loving, overweight, heart-of-gold, woman with a cheating husband, ailing Mother and lower than dirt self-esteem. Jamie and Stuart Bradley appear as two brothers whose lives are replete with abundant sibling rivalry, a loud, trashy wife/sister-in-law and an interfering Mom. The delightful Joanna Page (Gavin and Stacey) portrays Leanne, a single Mom struggling with her past mistakes and trying hard not to show her obvious feelings for married co-worker Stuart. As I have experienced with so many British TV writers, genius Kay Mellor captures and displays the raw nuance of each character and the very human side of each situation. The characters and situations are plausible as well as interesting. As we are introduced to each character, their detailed histories are revealed and tied together with the evolving action as the story unfolds.",1391990400,,1144,5.090425531914893
5581569,4,B00BDSRMAO,"A fantastic soap opera... But worth the time to watch. The good, bad and ugly. I did like it and it got better....",1391990400,,114,4.0

5581571,4,B00BDSRMAO,I got hooked on this show during the first episode. Just had to see how it all concluded. Try It; you might like it too.,1390867200,2,120,3.84
5581572,5,B00BDSRMAO,"I really enjoyed the real factor of the Syndicate, unlike American series, not everyone is perfect.  Perfect in character or looks.  I would like to see the second season, if there is one, soon.",1390521600,,194,4.676470588235294
5581573,5,B00BDSRMAO,Excellent cast and good scripts make this an outstanding series.  It is worth watching once you get through the first episode.,1389484800,,126,5.0
5581574,4,B00BDSRMAO,It ends too abruptly for me and it looks like Series 2 has almost a completely different cast.  Maybe once I can watch the second series I'll like it even better,1389139200,,161,4.193548387096774
5581575,5,B00BDSRMAO,I really enjoyed this series.  The characters were well developed and engaging.  I tend to watch shows on my Kindle before going to bed.  This show was entertaining and suspenseful without the graphic violence and sex scenes found in many series.,1389139200,2,246,4.951219512195122
5581576,4,B00BDSRMAO,Enjoyed this series and hope for the next season when available.  British programs offer an alternative to most of the offerings on our networks. The American version was cancelled after the first episode------------a shame.  You end up caring for what happens to these people and want to follow them further.,1389139200,,309,5.16

5581578,5,B00BDSRMAO,"I was intrigued the whole time.  Characters were believable, and that was a concern as I am a Potter fan...I liked the way each episode told the story from each perspective.

5581582,2,B00BDSRMAO,"Can't bring myself to watch more than one episode. This might have made a good premise for a book, but any joker could be watching this and we don't need to generate sympathy for an average Joe who just happens to make a teeny little mistake of becoming a violent criminal!",1386460800,,273,4.372549019607843
5581583,5,B00BDSRMAO,"A superbly acted, engagingly written snapshot of a few days in and around the benefactors of a winning lottery ticket, this is a short story of character introspective, ruptured normalcy and the very human frailties that emerge when the fantastic collides with the mundane.

Does money make one's life better? The answer is unforgivingly in the hands of each of 5 winners, and for better or worse, is dictated by their own priorities in life. This is not new stuff, but it is probably one of the best depictions of this oft-told tale of rags-to-riches, realized with modern day sensibilities.

There are a couple of very touching moments, and it could have come off rather treacle if not for the outstanding work of the director and all of the actors, causing one to really feel for the moments and not just view them. It is short, bittersweet, and well worth viewing.

""The Syndicate"" will not leave you without questions, but it will give you a hard and fast drive through a richly compact arrangement of the ever-lasting tug-and-pull of family and friends,  obligations and options, right and wrong...and the impact wealth can have on the same. Watch it and enjoy the ride.",1384905600,4,1176,4.806930693069307
5581584,5,B00BDSRMAO,"""The Syndicate"" is not for anyone, just for those of us who enjoy a fairy tale, broken hearts, broken dreams, happy endings, and thick Northern England accents.  Set in the rather grim industrial city of Leeds, the five-episide mini-series tells us about five ordinary, mostly decent, working class individuals, all employees of the same discount supermarket, who form a lottery syndicate.

Their future seems a bit bleak, the supermarket has been acquired by a larger chain and all five face redundancy, that horrible British euphamism for out of a job and up a creek. Each character accepts the news differently...some with stoicism, others with panic, some are driven to acts of desperation. This is soap opera manipulation at its best, and within the first 20 minutes, I was hooked.

Just when things look especially dodgy for all concerned, lightning strikes and The Syndicate's lottery numbers come up. Each member wins one million pounds, about $2.5 million...a lot of money, especially if you've been struggling to make ends meet as a supermarket checker.

The money certainly does change everyone's life, mostly in good ways, but this would not be a soap opera if bad things didn't happen to good people. We have brain tumors, love affairs, broken hearts and broken marriages, secrets revealed, family sundered and families united, the whole wonderful schmear. I admit, I tend to be a pushover for stuff like this, but the story is very well done, the performances are subdued, genuine and effective.

Being a British television series, the characters actually look the part. Some are attractive, some are not. All of them look like the kind of people you see at Costco; no designer clad, perfectly coiffed and toned-within-an-inch-of-their-lives starlets pretending to be weary over 40 single moms eking out an existance on $187.50 take home every week. There are bad teeth, oversized backsides, tacky clothes, flashy jewelry and god-awful haircuts galore.  It makes their eventual post-lottery transformations believable and fun, but even after their new-found wealth, they still manage to real and human, despite whitened smiles and significantly better hair.

A sequel, ""The Syndicate 2013"" was filmed after this proved to be an award-winner, a critical success and a ratings blockbuster in the UK.  Since the sequel was the work of the creator of this original mini-series, I imagine it might also be good and I'm about to find out.  If you enjoy happy endings (mostly), a good cry, payback of the most satisfying (and occasionally kind-hearted) sort, you'll eat this up with a spoon. Five big fat soppy, soapy stars.",1372204800,15,2631,5.142857142857143
8566725,5,B00BDSRMAO,"My sister, niece and I watch all the episodes we can find. We really enjoy watching.",1524096000,,84,4.3125
8566726,5,B00BDSRMAO,"If youve read my other reviews here on Amazon  especially of British mysteries  you know that I really hate lengthy reviews which give plot outlines for each episode, which serve as spoilers. Im not sure it those are helpful to the buyer  especially since the reviewer has already had the enjoyment of discovering the plot turns for themselves. I try to post reviews that give you the background but I want you to discover the show the way the author/director wanted you to . This is particularly relevant to this 2012 British series. There are so many twists in the story and so many levels of character development that  honestly  the less you know the better.

Here is all I think you need to know (again this is just MY opinion).  There were three seasons of this show which was co-produced by the BBC and ITV aired on the commercial ITV network in England. This was the first.  I actually just found out about it when I watched what is really the third season just received on DVD by Acorn. It is titled  The Syndicate  All or Nothing.  Now normally youd want to watch a series in chronological order but this one is different. All three have one common premise. A group of co-workers will the lottery and we see how it affects their lives. But each has a COMPLETELY different cast and location and stands on its own. After watching the 2015 All or Nothing  youll see my five star review on Amazon  I had to watch the earlier ones. Unfortunately Season 2 is not available on Region 1 (NTSC). I hope it is some day. Meanwhile this first series (all written by Kay Mellor, with some episodes directed by her), was fun to watch and the characters all have their own personalities. There are way too many twists and turns to tell you ANYTHING more except the common ground for the 5 joint winners of the lottery (the syndicate) all work in a grocery store which is scheduled to be shut down.  Unlike the third series  which has a real who dunnit at its core  this is more about telling the trust. If I had to rank the two I watched, this one would be rated second but I still loved it enough to give it 5 stars. And this one runs just under five hours, versus the six-hours for Season 3.

The cast (all honestly new to me)is great and each will grow on you. The story does jump back and forth in time  which bothered me at first  but I realized at the conclusion that this just added layers.

There are no nude scenes (a rarity these days) and I don't remember any graphic language. There is some graphic violence in one robbery scene.
At the beginning of each episode  before you press Pay Episode  there is a synopsis on the screen. I urge you to ignore reading these. They are not a synopsis of what already happened but of what you will see next. These really are spoilers

The DVD does not have any bonus features  not even a making of featurette.

I can highly recommend this to anyone interested in British TV series which have great character actors. If its mystery you want though, start with the All or nothing season.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8566730,4,B00BDSRMAO,"I have watched a lot of British television, more so than U.S. programming for the past 10 years.  I have had this series for a while - I had grabbed it because I have liked everything Timothy Spall is in, especially Mike Leigh films. But I just got around to watching this.  It has a rather complex plot, or at least it seems that way when each episode is apt to rehash events a bit  from a different character's perspective in order to fill in back story to advance the plot.  Mostly it works.  I have watched shows that Kay Mellor has written and/or directed, and the writing is usually sharp, as it is here. If you are not used to northern British accents, you may have a bit of trouble, but I am quite used to it.

The chemistry between the characters isn't as strong as it could be, but there is enough there to see that their work and social relationships are realistic for the most part.  There were a few places where I was pretty sure I knew what was about to happen, but unlike with most shows in this situation, what I expected often didn't happen.  So I credit the writing for originality,

This is by no means classic British television, and I can't see myself watching the series again, but it was entertaining enough to be worth watching.",1444435200,,1253,4.343347639484978
