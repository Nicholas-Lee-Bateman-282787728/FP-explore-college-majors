This movie is thought provoking, intelligent and has a few surprising twists (it didn't end the way I thought it would).  However, if you're looking for a well-acted movie that will be easy to watch, you'll enjoy this one.  I waited several years for it come out on DVD because I wanted to own it.  It was worth the wait.",1393286400,5,414,4.256410256410256
8375316,5,B002NQTPYQ,"One of the best films ever! A classic, with Ashley Judd, Wow! I recommend to buy, but don't play, DVD is worth more than seller is selling! Great deal!",1268524800,2,151,4.241379310344827
