8624281,4,B000053VCR,"This is a very good video, and it would be perfect if weren't for this just one thing, the inclusion of a lousy Season Five episode as the leading episode.
""Just Desserts""
This is the lousy episode I'm talking about. This is a lamish attempt to take ""Arthur"" characters and place them in faery tale settings. However, the sequences are too short, and the episode and concept overall end up being just dumb. If you want to see the ""Arthur"" characters in faery tales, I'd recommend ""Arthur's Really Helpful Bedtime Stories.""
""Buster Hits the Books""
Ah, blessed relief. An excellent episode that as the previous reviewer so aptly described, stresses the importance of reading. Excellent fantasy sequences, nice implementation and ending.
""D.W. Tale Spins""
An old classic. D.W. can't read, so she makes up her tale based on ""a story told to her by Grandma Thora."" Again, nice work with the fantasy sequences and good concept.
Overall, I'd say get this video even with the lower-quality episode included in it. The others more than make up for it.",993600000,3,1042,4.859550561797753
