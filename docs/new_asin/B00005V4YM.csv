7955939,3,B00005V4YM,This is an ok movie. I have seen worse and I have seen better. The acting was not bad in this movie the story line was a bit over used.,1179014400,,135,3.533333333333333
7955940,5,B00005V4YM,this movie is good so far as it being a lower budget film i like it and i like that it is full of english people love the accents and the whole killer with a old timey shaver is something else.,1166400000,,193,3.731707317073171

Could have been much better.

7955942,5,B00005V4YM,"Great movie, but I'm probably a bit partial to Aussie movies, being Australian myself. I first seen it when it was shown on TV here in Australia, loved it then, love it even more on dvd. Can't get a lot of Aussie movies on dvd here down under. Most of mine I've bought from America. What a surprise when I come across this little gem. Rebecca Gibney what can I say about her, she is the best Aussie Actress around. If you like a thriller/scary movie you'll love this based in Sydney in the Rocks.",1088294400,,496,4.231578947368421
7955943,3,B00005V4YM,"This is a pretty fair horror movie.  When you see the whole thing you look back and see so many places where it could have been so much better.  The components where all there but instead of capitalizing on them, the director seemed to look for a way to tie  the loose ends up quickly.  Also it dragged in places particularly in the middle and lacked for deeper performances by the actors.  Otherwise it is a fair movie with some good twists and turns.",1016755200,5,452,4.333333333333333
7955944,5,B00005V4YM,"I've been waiting three years for 13 GANTRY ROW to be released in the U.S.This is a very classy and sinister movie. Two newlyweds move into a large house where strange things begin to happen. Sound boringly familiar?,not a chance. Among other things,they notice a strange small stain on the living room wall. Gradually,the stain starts to take the shape of a man. I can't give anything away here. Former SPIDERMAN star Nicholas Hammond stars in this superb horror movie. 13 GANTRY ROW is a very well acted horror movie that I highly recommend.",1016668800,13,543,4.787234042553192
