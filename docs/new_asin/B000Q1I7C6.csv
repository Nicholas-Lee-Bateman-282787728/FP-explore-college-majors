In some films the Trial takes place in a European setting and in some other films, the setting is an American Court.
If one made a list of the Five most outstanding Court Martial films ever made, it would prove quite a Challenge to pick the film that would be number 1 or 2 or 3.  That would be because each of the top Five films dealt with slightly different issues in terms of motives, Court Procedure and the Testimony involved, not to mention the level of Acting and Directing and quality of the Screenplay.

All that said, it perhaps is wisest to simply state that of the Five finest Court Martial movies ever produced, one must Rank the top Five as equally Great in every way.  One of the most outstanding features of CARRINGTON VC (Victoria Cross), is that there is not a note of Music to be heard during the entire film except for a brief Bugle Salute in the first minute or two as the Regiment is raising the Flag at Sunrise and likewise at the very final moment of the film as the Flag is being lowered at the day's end.

To make a film without a note of Music from beginning to end constitutes an incredible movie making challenge in the extreme.
Yet so amazing is the level of the Acting, quality of the Screenplay and Masterful Directing, that we never once notice the film is devoid of any Musical background.  Indeed, at the conclusion of CARRINGTON VC,  we realize the absence of any Music makes the film that much more powerful.  We even sense that the inclusion of Music would only have served to distract us from the incredible spoken Dialogue in CARRINGTON VC and even have somehow cheapened the mesmerizing power of this unique film, whose Hero, DAVID NIVEN, delivers the Performance of a Lifetime.

The other Reviewers have already very astutely expressed in the most eloquent terms what makes CARRINGTON VC one of the truly Great Films in all of Cinematic History.  To say more would simply be as senseless as attempting to Guild the Lily or add Perfume to the Rose.

CARRINGTON VC is Movie making at its supreme and highest level.  FIVE STARS are NOT enough for this incredible NOT TO BE MISSED work of Art.",1513900800,6,2241,4.51980198019802
8194023,5,B000Q1I7C6,"Wonderful script and great acting. Taut, tense, and believable. It is wonderful to see how a British court martial is handled. The humor interspered relieves some of the tension. Kudos to all of the cast who played their parts well!",1513296000,6,232,4.825
8194024,4,B000Q1I7C6,"I've been in situations like this fellows, shows the courage and cowardice inherent in human nature. Was this based on a true story I wonder.",1510617600,3,141,4.68
8194025,5,B000Q1I7C6,"David Niven has long been my favorite actor.  This title has been hard to find, but I bit the bullet & paid the rather stiff price for it.  It was worth every penny.  I'd say this is among Mr. Niven's best movies.",1434758400,5,213,4.023809523809524
8194026,5,B000Q1I7C6,"This a great and gripping film.  Its not that Niven is or isn't great  - its the literate script and the understanding -sympathetic I think- that the writers and producer have for the military environment.  Niven is a  flawed but great hero - not coping as well with peace time life as might be expected.  He gets caught in a ham-handed attempt to gain some money he's owed, runs in to a jealous martinet of a commanding officer and then defends himself in front of a would be sympathetic military tribunal.  I won't spoil the climax but the concept of honor -so forgotten in modern times- comes strongly into play.  It leaves you dissatisfied but hopeful. Margaret Leighton as the neuritic, near psychotic wife and Victor Maddern as the loyal, rock solid enlisted man are particularity effective.  Maddern, as Bombardier Owen, is a hoot during cross examination.",1395964800,5,863,4.8231292517006805
8194027,5,B000Q1I7C6,"This is the finest film about courts martial I have ever seen (I am 76 and have seen a lot of films.  My own collection consists of 1200 VHS and 400 DVD).  David Niven, Major Carrington, V.C., is himself a graduate of Sandhurst and served in a Highland regiment.  In WWII Niven reentered the British Army and was promoted Lt. Col. As a CA sole practitioner for 32 years, Superior Ct. Judge for 4 years and a tour with the 12th Naval District JAG I am well qualified to review this and  similar films. Further, I am a graduate of the U.S.M.M.A., Engineer and Major, U.S.Army, Ret. In England the film was released as ""Carrington, V.C.""",1200614400,7,634,4.439655172413793
