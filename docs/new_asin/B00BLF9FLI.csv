5643660,3,B00BLF9FLI,"After a couple year absence, ""After Dark Originals"" is back with DARK CIRCLES.  ADOs are indie forays into horror---some have been very good (HUSK); others not so good (SCREAM OF THE BANSHEE).
DARK CIRCLES is a pondering, occasionally eerie spookfest centering on a young couple and their newborn son who move into a rural home and encounter disturbing occurrences that lead them to question each other's sanity.  The only thing ""new' in this tale is the ominous presence of sleep deprivation as a causative factor.  Paul Soter's script attempts to flesh out the characters of Alex and Penny but never fully succeeds in establishing a credible foundation for their erratic behavior or their failure to cope with or address solutions to their deprivation---like moving the baby into their room to see why little Tanner cries all night?
Johnathon Schaech and Pell James have good moments but the script hampers fully realized performances.
Overall, an okay thriller worth a weeknight rental.",1369612800,2,989,5.16875
5643661,3,B00BLF9FLI,"Alex (Johnathon Schaech) and Penny (Pell James) move into their ""Malibu Barbie Dreamhouse"" with Tanner, their newborn. They are under stress as any new parents, plus there is construction going on nearby which makes daytime rest impossible. The film boasts a very good suspense and creep factor as a phantom woman (Lucresha Wells) appears to haunt them. Both of them have seen her and believe she doesn't exist. Their relationship becomes increasingly strained.

The acting and creep factor was done well. I really got into the film, but it seemed to go nowhere. You know everything seems to center around ""the woman"", but the film leaves you hanging about her until the very end, and then you say, ""That's it?"" The clues they give you don't allow you to piece things together. The climax doesn't do the rest of the film justice. A little more than a meh rental.

5643663,5,B00BLF9FLI,"This is a remarkably impressive film that mostly uses the good but seldom now used Hitchockian method of creating suspense without showing much blood and gore. It creates tension with expert filming, music, and writing. The story presents a very plausible explanation for the horrors that face a family. The suspense is greatly enhanced as a baby is involved. This is the best horror-suspense movie I have seen in decades.

The tensions are increased throughout the film which increases the suspense. The movie digresses into a more modern ending which includes some blood, which may be the requirements of today's audience. Fortunately, the blood is not overdone. This movie lets one ponder issues such as who is the hero and who is the villain? The script is excellent. Overall, while horror is not my favorite genre, I was deeply impressed.",1369180800,15,843,5.021428571428571

More than anything, I felt I was a part of the quiet melee, a fly on the wall in the couple's unwinding, and though the ending wraps things up a little too easily, it's still well worth the watch.",1398124800,,497,5.073170731707317
5643669,5,B00BLF9FLI,"I am a huge fan and collector of horror movies, but, unfortunately, no longer easily frightened or disturbed. One of the After Dark season one movies, ""Unrest,"" actually gave me nightmares, so I am disapponted that the After Dark series has run out of steam. I bought ""Dark Circles"" when it first became available, and was bothered enough to want to see it again, but couldn't remember the title or from which of my collections it came. I am happy to have relocated it after much thought and searching. Anyone who has ever had trouble sleeping or gone through long periods of sleeplessness for some reason (I worked back-to-back night and day shifts for several years) will relate to the feeling you get when you are exhausted even to the point of seeing things that aren't there (I nearly swerved off the road on the way to my night shift to miss a guy who wasn't there). Some terrible things happen when this guy finally gets some sleep, and the nightmarish feeling of the final scene might make you wonder if he ever woke at all. This is probably a four, but I'm giving it five so that those who stop only for highly-rated movies might consider giving it a twirl. As a tough critic of horror films, I recommend it, and am just about to watch it again myself.",1396742400,4,1261,4.48695652173913

5643671,4,B00BLF9FLI,"DARK CIRCLES

I have bought every After Dark film that they have released from the Fest to the Originals, have them all.  Imagine my surprise when I found out that this After Dark film was written and directed by a member of the comedy team Broken Lizard who you might know from Super Troopers and such. I wasn't expecting that and once I learned that I truly didn't know what to expect. It turns out that this was a really good film and the ending was great.

A couple with a newborn baby is trying to find the perfect place to watch their child grow. So they decide that the city life is no longer for them with the new addition to the family. When finally deciding upon a house in the country they settle in and look forward to their new life together. But being parents is a lot harder than they thought it would be with sleepless nights and a baby needing constant attention. They go on without sleep for so long that they start seeing things that are not there, or are they.

Writer/director Paul Soter of Broken Lizard fame does a great job with this film letting things build slowly instead of forcing things like most horror films do nowadays. He does a good job letting the tension build without things getting boring which is tricky with films like this. It was cool to learn that this film was based on things that happened to him and his wife. That is just one of many things you learn while listening to the commentary on the DVD.

Acting wise this is another high spot of the film as stars  Johnathon Schaech and Pell James did great here. They were very believable in their portrayals of a couple who go from loving and excited to tied and beat to scared and paranoid. They really carry the film with strong performances, in fact I believe that even if you didn't like the story you could still enjoy what they did. Also Jennifer Foreman was great as the babysitter and it was great seeing her again, she was also in another After Dark film called Seconds Apart. She looks just like a girl that used to live with me and the character acts just like her, so that was kinda cool to see.

Over all I think that this was a pretty good film that does what it was meant to do. Soter did a good job here and I am looking forward to seeing if he ever enters the horror realm again. If he does I will be checking it out. Of course I will own anything Broken Lizard does so I will be seeing him again, hopefully we get that Super Troopers 2.",1391644800,,2447,4.2494623655913975
5643672,4,B00BLF9FLI,Pretty good for something I've never heard of.  It is really stupid that amazon asks me to review this movie and then says I have to right Something about it as well and then tells me that it has to be so many words.,1391299200,,216,3.909090909090909

5643676,4,B00BLF9FLI,"This was a very solid horror movie, I've heard some complaints about its pace but I personally felt it moved just right. It wasn't repeated shock scenes and nonstop creepiness, but with the context of the plot I think the pacing was just right.

There are some nods to horror fans throughout, and I think this is a great take on a ""haunted house"" story. Honestly seeing the director's history (super troopers, beerfest..) I did not have high expectations beyond a standard by-the-numbers horror movie (which is kind of what I wanted at the time), but I was pleasantly surprised by ""Dark Circles.""

Under normal circumstances I would rate this kind of movie at a three. I don't have the desire to watch it again, but I did thoroughly enjoy it and consider it worth recommending. This movie is set apart from a lot of modern horror though in that all the elements are implemented tastefully, there is the crucial element of mystery throughout, and everything that happens ""makes sense,"" i.e. they weren't ridiculous plot devices to get the character in yet-another shock scare with sudden sound effects. The movie proceeded logically, and that might be part of what can make it really get under your skin.",1373760000,2,1203,4.806763285024155
5643677,4,B00BLF9FLI,"Watched the trailer thought it looked good, gave it a try had never heard of movie thought it was good very well acted I really enjoyed it great thriller great ending.",1372982400,,167,4.419354838709677
5643678,2,B00BLF9FLI,"You have probably seen this movie before. It just had different titles. It is the well-worn story of the young white couple who moves away from the city without any planning whatsoever, in order to escape/raise new child/get new job/recover from bad experience, etc. In this case, a new child caused the departure from urban existence.

Pretty soon, as always happens in this movie, things become very creepy in the new home. Next, the couple starts to fight constantly, presumably lacking the coping skills to go through stress as a couple without harming each other. They make awful decisions (one happened in a grocery store); then violence and bloodshed happen, until they finally escape the evil presence. The End.

Despite this plot being performed repeatedly, this movie doesn't even execute in a decent fashion. I can deal with a little choppiness or lack of structure (for artistic purposes), but this movie is incoherent due to a lack of thoughtfulness by the director. Many questions go unanswered longer than they should, and when they are finally addressed, the explanations are pretty anticlimatic.  Some reviewers have described the ending as a ""twist,"" but I think it was twist only by accident. The directors failed to consider how their ending conflicted with earlier parts of the movie (particularly, the ubiquitous ghostly female appearing and disappearing at will, moving objects, possessing paranormal powers, etc.).  If the creators did this intentionally, then they failed miserably.

Despite the flaws with the plot, the production was decent; the actors did a fine job; and the setting was adequate. These qualities, however, cannot overcome the weak story line. This movie could have earned a much higher rating with closer attention to the script. Nonetheless, if you watch it with these caveats in mind, you could have a decent 1.5 hour journey - good for weekend afternoon viewing.",1371427200,,1911,5.171521035598706
5643679,5,B00BLF9FLI,"Watched the film with great pleasure. Excellent movie, classic suspense made in traditions of ""Horror Fest"" and ""After Dark"".

5643680,1,B00BLF9FLI,"Confusing, convoluted and a complete waste of time.  Yes, there's a twist towards the end but its ridiculous and leaves you empty and wondering why you even bothered.

5643681,3,B00BLF9FLI,"In the interest of full  disclosure, I will admit that after living in many parts of the country in a variety of dwelling units, I have come to the conclusion that, Rosemary's Baby notwithstanding, anyone who lives in a house and not an apartment, a multi-family dwelling unit as they call it, is asking for trouble, and, anyone living in a house with no neighbors within 15 feet of them, might just as well call in the Coroner or make an immediate reservation in the local institution for the mentally ill. When I see a film like  this, I take it as only natural that the occupants will either be dead, institutionalized or, after much mental and physical anguish, departed for more salubrious housing.
I know nothing of anyone associated with the film in any way, but think that they did a decent  job within narrowly circumscribed limits. The lead male seemed already half shot before the couple (with newborn baby) moved into their new surroundings. The woman appeared bewildered from the moment they left for the ""country"". The other  parts were negligible to the central action of the film. It was OK for the creators and Director to play it low key and inexplicable throughout, but not OK for them to provide no meaningful source for the happenings
My  recommendation: if you like haunted house movies this is generally acceptable and not a grade B horror film. If you do not like unresolved puzzles, you are likely to be dissatisfied with the film. I saw it and left it with a sense of unease, of incompleteness, a reaction which the Director appears to have wanted.",1370908800,16,1574,4.688405797101449

BUT the plot was a stretch and the execution belabored to the point of being torturous for the viewer. In short, the film is just too damned slow and without anything at the end to justify the boredom.",1370649600,2,309,4.43859649122807
5643683,2,B00BLF9FLI,"The After Dark film series has offered hits and misses over the past few years with more misses than hits. This holds true with it's latest offering DARK CIRCLES.

Alex and Penny are a young couple with a new baby who decide to move out to the suburbs instead of live in the hustle and bustle of the city. Thinking this is a better way to raise a child of course we viewers know that nothing of the kind can take place and of course the child and family will soon be placed into jeopardy.

The new child is not the best at behaving and seems determined to keep the two of them awake most of the time. Why they can't figure out that they could sleep alternating shifts until the child develops a better sleep pattern is ignored so that we can have them suffer sleep deprivation. This is especially odd since Alex is a musician who works from home trying to compose music. Then again a new house is being built next door by a crew that seems to think they get paid more if they make more noise. With each passing day things seem to get worse.

Eventually things reach and extreme and the pair both begin seeing a strange looking woman in and around the house. Could this be some spectral image that they are seeing or is it just a hallucination due to their sleep deprivation? Time will tell as the movie glides along at a snails pace feeling more like it is repeating scenes rather than offer a coherent plot line.

These characters don't seem to make the best of decisions from start to finish. One that especially seemed odd to me was that they do their best to be loving, caring parents. But as the grind gets to them Alex meets a young girl working a check out counter at the local grocery and asks her to come baby sit for them. Call me crazy but I never once considered having some teenager I just met working the local grocery counter become the person I trusted with my child. Stranger yet is when they come home and she's no longer there they don't seem as upset as I would have been.

The final solution to the story here is actually fairly decent but the time it took to get there was wasted. This would have made a decent segment of NIGHT GALLERY years ago but as an entire feature it takes to long and feels more like it was padded to get it to feature length.",1369958400,2,2272,4.237875288683603

8570367,2,B00BLF9FLI,"**SPOILERS**

Where do I begin? Oh, let's start with the title. What does ""dark circles"" have to do with the movie? Is it because the main characters have dark circles from lack of sleep? Who knows. Anyway, it was a very misleading movie. From the get-go, it made you believe it was a supernatural entity that was plaguing the young parents. How did the mother dream of a woman in the first scene, when she clearly never met her before? That is impossible. Again, it makes the viewer think that a supernatural force is at play. Also, there were some things that happened in the movie that a human person is incapable of doing. For example, one minute the baby is in the house with the mom, the next minute he is being cradled in the evil woman's arms. Again, if this was a ghost it could happen. It was so annoying to see these two adults unable to cope with one baby and some noisy construction going on near their home. Um, how about one of you take turns sleeping. Neither one of them work, so that shouldn't be a problem. They were cranky and whining wimps and sorry excuse for parents. I wound up detesting this couple even more than the evil woman. On a positive note, there were some scary and jumpy scenes, which I liked.",1492300800,3,1229,4.366812227074236

8570372,3,B00BLF9FLI,"With two major, big screen films in our review section it is instead this direct-to-video release that earns the best review of the week.  Penny (Pell James) and Alex (Johnathon Schaech) have escaped the hustle and bustle of the big city and bought a home in the country to raise their baby.  Their newborn is up all night crying, however, depriving the young parents of sleep.  Anyone who has dealt with a baby who won't sleep at night knows full well that it is a nightmare unto itself!  Alex finds working on his music to be impossible due to the demands of little Tanner.

The stress overwhelms the couple.  They snipe at each other over the smallest things, and when a construction crew begins to work on a new home nearby, it makes their days as sleepless as their nights.  But with the sleep deprivation come horrifying visions.  They see a bedraggled woman in their home who seems to have bad intentions for their baby.  They dismiss the sightings as hallucinations brought on by the lack of sleep.  Hiring a babysitter to watch the infant at night fails when the babysitter disappears when they awake in the morning.  As the sightings become more terrifying, and the sleeplessness takes hold of the couple, they are at each others throats, blaming one another for all their problems.

Dark Circles is a fine psychological terror that could have been much better had it not tried to make the film a supernatural horror.  You are left to guess through much of the film if the woman they are seeing is a ghost, a hallucination, or real.  But when this issue is revealed it makes many of the previous sightings virtually impossible from a logical standpoint, depending upon how much stock you place in BOTH parents hallucinating about the same woman.

Still, there is enough to like about the rest of the film.  The film rests almost solely in the performances of the two leads since one of the two is in just about every scene and both Pell and Schaech do a marvelous job of portraying parents pushed to the brink by their lack of sleep.  I can tell you I spent many a nights pushing one of my sons through the house in a stroller at 3:00am to try and get him back to sleep and its not a fun experience.

While not overly terrifying there are a few jump out of your seat moments but the true terror lies in how real this situation can become.",1438387200,,2348,4.497641509433962
