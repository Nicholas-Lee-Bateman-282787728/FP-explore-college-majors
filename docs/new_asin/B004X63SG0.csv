4492316,2,B004X63SG0,"It has its fun moments but is largely an exaggerated portrayal of a Swedish holiday gathering.. Yes, there is lots of drinking and sex in Swedish summer holidays, but this is over the top.",1360454400,,188,4.5588235294117645
4492317,3,B004X63SG0,"A pretty good movie, sort of a Swedish St. Elmo's Fire - Luke Perry sort of stuck out like a sore thumb, but I guess any American would in an all Swedish cast.  I liked seeing the characters come to a realization of their relationships and who they are to be with.  All in all I enjoyed it because I have a hard time finding current day movies in Swedish language, so I appreciated seeing it.",1330819200,7,392,4.144736842105263
4492318,3,B004X63SG0,"Judge Daryl Loomis, DVD Verdict-- Aside from Christmas, the biggest holiday in the Scandinavian regions is Midsommar, the celebration of the summer solstice. It's no wonder; with the long northern nights and frigid winters, the longest day of the year is truly cause for celebration, a time of magic and maypoles that is ripe for romance. American director Ian McCrudden (Mr. Smith Gets a Hustler) travels to Sweden with Luke Perry (Beverly Hills 90210) in tow to portray one atypical Midsummer party and deliver a romantic comedy with just enough complication to keep things interesting.

Emil (Daniel Gustavsson, The Girl Who Played with Fire) has planned a huge Midsummer festival this year, with all his local friends coming and Sam (Perry), his best friend from America showing up for his first time in Sweden. Everything is set for a great party, but Emil has another surprise in store, one that will greatly surprise his girlfriend, Susanne (Lisa Werlinder, Munich), and make the whole party wonder if they should have come at all.

Fair warning, horndogs: despite the provocative title, this is not the kind of sex comedy that one might expect from a Swedish import. It deals with sex to a certain extent, but it's no festival of the flesh. Instead, it's a celebration of the romantic beauty of Sweden and an observance of the often tenuous status of relationships. A Swedish Midsummer Sex Comedy is a pretty film that shows of Sweden's landscapes very nicely and features a simple, economic plot but, overall, this is an insubstantial piece. It's enjoyable enough at the time but, like so many summer parties, completely forgotten afterward. That isn't a bad thing exactly; sometimes a trifling comedy is just what the doctor ordered. Excepting the gorgeous landscapes, which get plenty of screen time, there's little here that makes the film stand out at all or make me want to seek out more from the director. I absolutely won't recoil in horror from the name Ian McCrudden (he's no Ulli Lommel) nor will I expect a whole lot from one of his pictures. This is a competent film, but little more than that.

Distributed by Red, A Swedish Midsummer Sex Comedy is an average disc with a few problems. The image looks good, with nice colors and decent detail for a standard definition transfer. The sound is very average. There's claim of 5.1 surround, but it's barely noticeable; the mix is as front-heavy as it could possibly be, but it's clear and bright in all the channels that actually feature sound. The only real issue is with the subtitles, which have odd spelling and grammatical errors, as though they were written by Swedes without a strong grasp of English. It's occasionally distracting, but not that big of a deal. The only extra is a short introduction from the director, which is marginally worth a listen.

Styled as a ""sex"" (nearly devoid of anything but homosexist demonstrations) ""comedy"" (singularly NOT funny throughout).  The only aspect of the writeup that held together was that it related to Sweden and Midsummer.  Perhaps it is consistent with Swedish culture, which honored OweBowMao's request in 2010 that mere messenger Julian Asange be prosecuted for *refusing* to be object raped with con dumbs by a pair of Swedish lesbians (recently upheld by the Swedish Supreme Court), but quite unfunny for this dreary 2009 moo bee.",1474156800,,926,5.358620689655172

And just as Shakespeare shows in Midsummer Night's Dream all's well that ends well after many amusing struggles.  And this movie ends well after revealing the risks in finding the right partners and the fears  that we haven't the ability to love. It is a light movie with big ambitions and it succeeds.

This is not an XXX film, there isn't much sex or nudity, but enough to make it a ""sex comedy"" I guess.
I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a ""different"" romantic comedy.
I think it's awesome that the movie is in Swedish. It does have English subtitles.

4492462,5,B004X63SG0,"This was a movie that my wife and I watched after celebrating midsummer at our house. It's a great comedy that sheds light on the swedish tradition of midsummer festival. If you have ever been curious about other cultural celebration, this movie will show just that, except the sex, that was introduced to get your attention.",1403654400,3,325,4.821428571428571
4492463,5,B004X63SG0,"Very professionally done light entertainment, and -- despite what other reviewers have said -- full of sexual situations, the usual romantic comedy criss-crossing very expertly presented. Luke Perry does a fine, self-effacing job, and the mix of English and Swedish dialog among the characters is one of the film's best points, just like its beautiful scenery.

Sex farces in American movies have given way to gross-out features, which are good enough in their own way, but might make us forget the softer, smoother approach to love problems that this movie takes. It's old-fashioned and its laughs are gentle, but constant and winningly earned. This kind of show is much harder to put together than it seems to be. Meanwhile, the box and the English title are in no way misleading: what you see is what you get, and you get something very good.",1397606400,4,845,4.909090909090909
4492464,4,B004X63SG0,"An American joins Swedish friends to celebrate midsummer (presumably June 21) in rural Sweden.  It's nicely filmed amid lakes, trees and traditional rural village houses.  Most of the cast seem to be thirty somethings who aren't quite sure what they want in life and seem to have emotional problems beneath the surface. Although lightweight, it doesn't have a whole lot of comedy, or sex either, which disappears almost completely after the first few minutes. However some of the cast members look good and it provides a look at Swedish middle class life in the country.",1360454400,3,570,4.989473684210527
8446285,5,B004X63SG0,"I lived in Sweden for a couple of years as a child, and this movie was a nice return there, to see what life might have been like for me in an alternate universe if I had grown up there. I enjoyed just hearing the language and watching the Midsommar celebrations that were all too fleetingly part of my life. My extended family spent there summers on an island much like this one, and I did for a brief time as well. There was a nice feeling seeing this movie that not much has changed in Sweden's way of life. Summer is definitely the best season in Sweden. Although, Christmas is quite nice, as well (but the winters are dark).",1505433600,,629,4.25

8446288,2,B004X63SG0,"What an odd, odd movie!  It's not bad per se.  It's just a bizarre gathering of people in Sweden...apparently Luke Perry is one of the friends, but from America.  He looks like a worn out piece of leather, plays the same cool-kat persona he has always played - and boy is it played ;-).  He has no good lines and seems to have nothing in common with these people, in appearance or otherwise!  I'd love to comment on the story but there doesn't seem to be a specific story. There are events, but that's about it. Truly Luke Perry doesn't belong in this film and it makes me wonder why he is??  find out for yourself, watch it...it's not a total waste of time but leaves me shaking my head.",1501372800,,688,4.253846153846154
