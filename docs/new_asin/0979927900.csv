174218,4,0979927900,"I came into this film with high expectations, and I was mostly correct in that notion.  As per usual, the Botkin sisters are calm, logical, and passionate about their topic.  In this case, the highly traditional, Biblical notion that girls and young women should spend what would usually be their college years at home learning both vocational skills and more traditional homekeeping skills (such as washing dishes, working with children, cooking, etc.)  I liked that they chose a wide sample of women to interview, coming from many different backgrounds - racial, socioeconomic and religious, to an extent (it is firmly a Christian production across the board, but different denominations were represented.)  My only gripe with the film, which I'd have given five stars otherwise, is that this lifestyle, whether you agree with it or not, is at times not feasible for reasons of finances or family dysfunction, and this caveat is not touched on at all.  But overall, a very fascinating film, which will definitely make you think and inspire discussion with whomever you choose to watch it with.",1354406400,8,1095,5.094972067039106

7794926,5,0979927900,"Excellent! Some of the reviews on here make you think this film is legalistic and doesn't provide any Scriptural backing (which I found none in their reviews either).
It is true that many references of Scripture are quoted without the Book and chapter named, but almost everyone interviewed quoted direct Scripture, and all regurgitated Biblically derived concepts.
The thing is, this film is not for feminists... That includes many professing Christians. I should know, as a babe in Christ, I was heavily influenced by feminism, though at the time I would have thought that furthers from the truth.
If you spend more time asking your preacher what they think about a topic than going to the Word first, I'm afraid this won't tickle your ears.
But if you are like me, reading the Scriptures and would like some examples (not carbon copy examples), of what a daughter's role should be in her home, this is it.
I did the college thing and excelled according to their standards. Yet it taught me nothing. Our family has left what the ""church"" has accepted and have chosen to go to the Scriptures to determine the template of our home.

7794927,3,0979927900,"I am a Christian woman but perhaps this movie does not take into account the biblical struggles women had since the beginning of time.  Take a look at history and you will learn that if a woman decides to rely solely on man/husband you will be making a big mistake both spiritually and financially and this is what this video promotes.  The bible teaches us to put our faith and love in God the Father and Christ and we are not to trust no man.  Ps 118:8 tells us to trust no man.  Why?  Because we are all full of sin and because of this we often times seek our on selfish needs. For this reason women need to equip themselves with options and be able to depend our their gifts and talents just in case things don't turn out right for them in marriage.  Women that have allowed themselves to be dependent solely on their husband can later find themselves in difficulty situations.  They end up staying with men that abuse them and their children because they are unable to financially take care of themselves.  I speak as a stay home mom and homeschooler and as a divorce woman.  No one wants to get divorce.  I didn't but if your man decides to take off on you for ungodly reason then what are you suppose to do?  I am educated and have been taking care of myself and my family but if I had decided to put off my education and rely solely on man that God calls us not to trust, today I would have been living a very difficult life.

7794929,3,0979927900,"It's been years since I first wrote a review about a Botkin product, the notorious So Much More with its stay-at-home daughters and support of bride prices being the first. Now that the Vision Forum ministries, the publishing group of this film is defunct, the Botkins are on their own with their site and company, and better for them. In their second book, the girls seem more laid-back and humorous in their outlook, so I hope they continually get better and grow stronger in spine. I've also lost a good deal of my anger towards this shrunken ideology since the infamous VF's demise, and that's what enabled me to read the girls' second book in order to learn more about them and, finally, watch this film, the girls' own personal work in the family's film making. I knew by now there'd be parts that were universally appealing as well as the ugly male-centric beliefs the VF held, the majority of which I heard about some time ago, but the film itself is underwhelming in length and scope namely because it's surprisingly short. It might be better termed a testimonial than a documentary; the girls said on their site that they had a lot more footage than they planned on using, but frankly they probably should have. As it was, I'm very glad for the extra out-takes they included. The film by its design is a small jewel with superior music, gorgeous scenery and very nice interviews and testimony with several different attractive families. The young women here are industrious and creative, interesting to watch whether you just want to learn more about them or share their beliefs at least to a certain degree. There is certainly a lot of benefit from staying with family in your young adult years and the things that can be done from the home are encouraging to see. If you at all have an open heart and mind, you should be able to glean some inspiration from this.

No matter how open one is, though, there's no erasing the occasionally heavy, clunky hand of the Vision Forum patriocentric beliefs that hang around several of the comments by people in the film. The first segment centers on the large family of a builder and how his oldest daughter, Katie, helps him in his business. Katie reveals that her family wasn't always close and went through a blessed change from God to work together and find peace. A less settling, alarmingly narrow remark from Katie however is that she's happy to be helping her family rather than selfishly chasing her own pursuits and wanting her own career. This is the kind of damaging ideal the uber-patriarchal thinkers from the VF are known for: letting grown women think that wanting their own career is somehow selfish, because it just might be separate from their family. It's lovely to see Katie and all the smart women here do things with and for their family, but there's no need here or anywhere for women to have such unhealthy and extra-Biblical ideas about themselves. Her father, too, commented briefly and enthusiastically about how the Bible called women to be helpmeets above all in their lives and that's what he wanted to train his daughters to be (missing that he can't, in fact, train any of them to do this; they'd learn homemaking skills from their mother and have entirely different relationships with their husbands, apart from helping with business and house tasks). It was almost laughable when he tried to explain away the severe limits of this thinking by saying, ""This doesn't mean women can't leave the house..my daughter runs errands for me all the time!"" Dear cheerfully clueless dad, the issue is not where women go; many patrio-daughters in these rich pseudo-royal homes go to different countries, including the trophy Botkins themselves. It's not an even an issue of their living at home! The matter is the range of their beliefs and ambitions, whether they think their fathers hold the end of a rope over their sphere of activity and even ideas.

The male-revolving idealism is stated more strongly in the second segment, inspite of it centering around one of the most strong-minded daughters to ever live in the movement. Jasmine Baucham and her father, the booming pastor and speaker Voddie Baucham, discuss Jasmine's decision to live at home and have what is clearly a genuinely fulfilling life with her large family. One of the things I wish these people would do was focus more on these women serving their family as a whole, and not just the patriocentrist's mystical idea of ""father's vision"" and how a daughter lives her single years to fulfill it as though this is actually stated in the Bible. Mothers are often essentially left out of these models and Jasmine Baucham, though she's stated elsewhere her extremely close relationship with her mother, is shown primarily with her father and almost the whole focus here is on her relationship with him. Elizabeth Botkin, narrating this segment, even said that Jasmine and her father reevaluated her role, not Jasmine and both parents. This might be dismissible, except that the myopic view of daughters' perpetual place under their fathers was hammered by heavy-handed boar Voddie himself. He absurdly speaks of sending these ""helpless creatures"" out into the world (yes, he means women, even those like the Botkins apparently, who carry guns) and states that the Bible (unilaterally) commands women to be submissive instead of independent, and that this is because of Eve's sin of ""wanting her husband's place"" (he does not mention whether that was a result of her real original sin, which was wanting Godlike power, or whether she was like that all along). He says there's no way he'd foster such a sin nature in his daughter, soo..she's staying at home to avoid this, I guess? Voddie's advice could be taken in one of two ways: either it's sinful for women to want independence from men and that's why he's keeping Jasmine at home, to weed this wickedness out of her, or Eve's sin was wanting independence from God's rules and he wants to keep Jasmine from the similar ""feminist"" spirit of today. Which Jasmine apparently did have at some point, because she mentioned how her idea of success used to be far too strongly rooted in an isolationist ideal and she lost sight of the importance and blessing of her own family; if anyone wanted to be inspired by Jasmine's story and change of mind, this is the message I would take from it. Overall, it's mostly a nice chapter in the film, with Jasmine's message of fulfilling her own calling instead of feeling pressured to be an example or figurehead of black womanhood according to the world's terms.

The next segment is about Melissa Keene, whose father works as a trucker. She and her family take care of the home in his absence, even developing their own businesses, including what appears to be dressmaking. One of the biggest things she assists her father with is the arranging of the annual father/daughter Vision Forum retreat, a huge and elaborate event taking place in Callaway Gardens, one of my favorite places in the world. As gag-worthy as some of the Daddy-serving activities in the event are, there are beautiful parts as well and the footage of Melissa working during the high tea is lovely and encouraging. She's another example that these women are capable and talented in many arenas.

Immediately following the butterflies in the footage of the Callaway Gardens retreat is the shot of Lourdes Torres, the next young woman, loading a gun at a target range (this is one of my favorite things, showing the variety of women's capabilities and activities). Lordes lives in Texas with her family in a much smaller home than some of the ones we've seen and she keeps quite busy in her community. One of the most serious and rewarding things she and her family does is actually traveling to Mexico and ministering to the people there by witnessing for Christ and helping with building houses. Lordes speaks as a happy and lively woman whose father loves for her to stretch her ability and interests wherever she can.

Last, we have the Vision Forum's favorite fairytale, the courtship romance and marriage of Kelly Brown and Peter Bradrick. Kelly, up until about a year before this movie was made, was one of the well-known stay-at-home daughters in the group and now she's served as a model for the courtship ideal of the Vision Forum. Her chapter opens with wedding photos, including the Botkins' claim that pics of her first kiss at the altar have been circulated around the world (really?) accompanied with said photo of the kiss and the actual pretentious sound affect of applause in the background. The VF people love to advertise their living models of ultra-traditional thinking, and there's a reason someone asked why there were so many ""posed pictures"" in this film (such as the one with Peter standing over Kelly and holding her shoulders, while both of their extremely grim faces gazed out beyond the camera at what one could only assume was a battle scene of some kind). Some heavy-handedness aside, there was luckily a lot more to Kelly's story and their union is clearly genuine. Both discussed their courtship process with additional commentary from her parents, Scott and Claudia Brown, and while some have criticized Peter for ""bragging"" that he didn't tell Kelly he loved her or that she was beautiful during the process, he explained that he felt both these things for her but held out on expressing them until they were in a solid relationship, because he didn't want to influence her with emotional words that could sway her decision.

Aside from the sweet parts of their relationship, there was some of the unusual and odd as well. Peter went through a very arduous process to even get permission to court Kelly, which basically consisted of her father asking him to write essays about his own beliefs before he ever even spoke to her about his intentions and the two of them having ""very guarded interactions"". All of this, from the PHD-size papers about marital beliefs to not breathing a word about any of it to Kelly, was stated to be done in order to protect her. Peter's feelings didn't need protecting, you understand; if he took a virtual college course just to have a shot in Hades with her only to be rejected in the end (once she found out he was even interested, upon his graduation from Scott Brown's semester of Courting My Daughter 101), he would simply pack up and go, no further consideration taken of him. But Kelly is a woman, and we females are fragile beings who are best kept from any word of romance until the approaching male has been assessed and a carefully screened meeting taken place. I know of course how relational and emotional we women are, but we can survive crushes in the schoolyard as small girls and can certainly hear word of a church friend fancying us as potential mates without fainting from the vapors. Keeping women from romance until it's sanctioned by Daddy on a forensic level is just as much a heavy-handed part of the Vision Forum's system as presuming, from the moment of birth, that women belong only at home fulfilling Dad's vision instead of ""selfishly"", as Katie Valenti called it, pursuing their own.

Their unusual agenda is never more clear than with Peter's words that it was better for Kelly to become educated with skills she'd need as a home wife rather than work to get a nursing degree that ""she would only shelf later on and then have to learn homemaking skills all over again"". It's absolutely amazing how implicit his presumption is that she'd never have a job once she got married, or that women in general wouldn't. And besides, it's ridiculous to assume that everything you know about basic house maintenance (like cooking, cleaning, and banking that Kelly took care of while still at home) would disappear if someone began working on an outside career; in fact, it's medicine that's often changing, so a nurse would have a bigger challenge if she quit for a while in her practice than a home-wife or daughter would. Peter was right when he said many unfairly dismiss what women do by taking care of their families in the home, but he went on to just as absurdly and unjustly dismiss the vital work that many women do as nurses. In another very narrowed comment, he claimed, ""The young men that I know are not looking for women who say 'the family thing didn't work for me, I'm going to find a husband at college.' They're looking for women who want to spend the days in their father's household as a virgin focused on keeping their relationship with the Lord."" Wow..terribly specific, isn't he? Again, this is actually quite humorous; not only the fact that the men he knows are in apparently a very small group compared to the rest of the world, but the way he speaks of women who..what, exactly, abandon their families to go to college for the sole purpose of finding a husband? Is that what he generally chalks any woman's plans for college up to, I wonder?

The film concludes with pretty encouraging words by Jenny Chancey, Anna Sophia and Elizabeth Botkin and a couple of others, as well as the general exhortation to be Christian women of vision in whatever way we're called to. The extra segments included a nice piece of the women in the film talking about their relationships with their brothers, an extended portion of Kelly and Peter discussing their courtship, and a final piece of Geoffrey Botkin and up-until-now-absent Doug Phillips, the ringleader of the entire Vision Forum group. For a man from a family with such tight opinions, Geoffrey Botkin's words offered surprisingly applicable observations about the state of families and culture's ugly views of women today. Doug Phillips was another story; as is almost always the case with him, his entire focus and every word that spilled from his mouth was about authority, hierarchy, how God wants it in the family, how women are under men and wives and daughters are NOT independent people but agents of the husband. Satan WRECKS the family by attacking this blessed male-rule structure, he cried, sending my TV's volume jumping several decibels, and he finished by waxing grandly about how God even gave men the authority to severe any contracts or vows their wives or grown daughters made. The man never swells like a rotten fruit or glows like a bride quite as much as when he sings opera about women's lower place on the rung of the family ladder, and in short, I found he had nothing worthy to say and will skip his contributions from here on out.

Epilogue

Curious for any updates about the women in this film? Jasmine Baucham ended up marrying another assistant of her father's and is now a happy mother. Katie Valenti, the first daughter shown, ended up marrying Peter Bradrick's younger brother and is now Kelly's sister-in-law. Kelly herself has had a whopping five children, the first four which were born in just four and half years, and there have been worrisome hardships for her as she lived out her father's absurdly coined ""militant fecundity"" with oddly little space between her pregnancies. At one point, she was even taken with her husband to Europe after barely recovering from a C-section and suffered a medical emergency shortly afterward that, very strangely, was not mentioned by a single one of the usually trumpeting Vision Forum males (including her husband and father) anywhere online in prayer requests or anything else. For all the rich talk from the men in her life about protecting her feelings from crushes, she's physically had considerably less protection and I hope this changes a huge deal, with her husband being less absorbed in his own misapplied ideas and actually living up to his vows. There's a reason I've never been able to stand Doug Phillips for very long with his legalism and controlling extremist views about Christians and women especially, and his true nature came out a few years ago in a way that even I never expected: one of the young women in this very film began working with his family as a nanny and later testified that he assaulted her during her time there. In typical fashion he'd tried to cover this up by claiming at first he'd had an ""emotional affair"" with her, but it didn't take long for the fraudulent family man to be revealed for what he was.

 The VF collapsed under its repelling leader's disgusting behavior and now, films like this and other work by the Botkins and people like Jenny Chancy, Stacy Mcdonald and filmmaker Colin Gunn stand on their own merit without the VF to promote them, all the better for both their creators and audiences. The VF produced a lot of venomous duds in its time, but there were also books and films of greater quality that should outlast the ruins of the VF's temple to hyper-patriarchy.",1471046400,8,16760,4.783494475138122
7794930,5,0979927900,This film is wonderful. It is soooo refreshing to see the women themselves waking up to their biblical roles. In our modern day often even the Christians get the roles reversed. I bought the film as I have four boys and one daughter. The film gave plenty for us to speak of in our family. Meaning that the boys need to prepare themselves for becoming MEN one day as well. It would also be good to have a film showing what boys need in life to fulfil their role as well. Truly refreshing and highly recommended!!,1457222400,3,511,4.333333333333333

7794932,1,0979927900,"Do you want a ""Christian"" documentary that presents an extreme position, then proceeds to provide no actual biblical justification for it? Would you rather follow a man-made legalistic system than the teachings of Jesus Christ or the apostles? Are you interested in an ideology championed by someone who sexually abused his children's nanny? If the answer to these questions is NO, I would recommend you stay away from this documentary.

I hate to be harsh, since I know that most who are attracted to this way of thinking have the best of intentions and just want to follow Christ better. But I don't know how I can skirt around the truth. It's one thing for a woman to make the personal choice not to pursue a career, or even decide to live in their parents' home until they're married. There's nothing inherently wrong with this. People can glorify Christ in all sorts of lifestyle positions. But this movie, make no mistake, DOES imply that this is THE way to follow Christ, THE way for women to behave. It doesn't for a minute indicate otherwise.

And if you think for a minute that they're going to justify this position biblically...think again. They don't even TRY to. It's not even that they misinterpret verses, they almost never cite anything specific in the Bible at all. They seem to rely on vague platitudes and on the viewers being enchanted by how ""countercultural"" and therefore supposedly ""godly"" they seem more than anything. For a Christian documentary insisting on a certain doctrinal position, this is cartoonishly bad.

They do include one ""extra"" that attempts to explain the ""biblical foundations"". Guess what? THEY DON'T. They spend most of their time talking about how the Bible says ""family is important"" and ""follow God's law rather than man's law"", which few people watching this documentary are going to dispute, rather than focusing on what the Bible specifically says ABOUT families, or HOW they got their specific system from it. The small amount of time they DO seem to actually be focusing on the specific issue at hand, it's still pretty pathetic. For one thing, they only look at a chapter of Numbers, i.e. the Law that was supposed to have already been fulfilled and rendered obsolete by Christ. Even worse, though, is the fact that they actually extrapolate into a more extreme position than what the text actually says! Doug Phillips claims that the passage (Numbers 30) teaches that ""daughters aren't to be independent"" (he literally says this), and should basically never take the initiative to do things on their own, but rather follow their father's ""vision"". In reality, all the passage ACTUALLY says is that the father has veto power over his wife or daughter if they make a vow. It doesn't specify that you must ask your father's permission BEFORE you make a vow or anything like that. So yeah...the passage just plain DOESN'T say what he claims it says. It makes sense that they didn't bother putting the ""Biblical justification"" in the documentary itself, seeing as it's obviously very weak.

Daughters staying at home in no way PREVENTS them from being godly. But insisting that they do so without a biblical basis is legalism, pure and simple.

This documentary feels like it has a split personality, in some ways. They keep insisting that ""God's vision"" is superior to ""man's vision"". At the same time, they repeatedly emphasize that daughters should follow their father's vision and wives should follow their husband's vision. So which one is it? Should you follow man's vision or not? Of course, there's actually no contradiction, since they completely fail to show how what they claim to be ""God's vision"" is actually from God, so it's pretty clear that it is, in fact, man's vision.

Make no mistake: The Bible DOES say that wives should submit to their husbands, and that children should obey their parents, but it never says we must necessarily follow their ""vision"". Think about it. The Bible also insists that we should submit to the laws of earthly authorities, and in the apostles' day, the earthly authorities often OPPOSED the gospel. It also says that wives should submit to their husbands even if they're unbelievers! These patterns of submission are clearly based on God's order, not on following the ""vision"" of some human being. Just because someone submits to or obeys another does not mean that their purpose in life is to fulfill that person's ""vision"". A Christian's purpose in life is always to fulfill GOD'S VISION, not any man's. But this movie literally misses that point. It almost never talks about women in relation to God, only in relation to men. And they're claiming this is Christianity?

I know that review was harsh, but I don't know what else I could do. It's just that bad. It's not just poor Christianity, I struggle with the idea that it could be called Christianity at all. There's no emphasis on Christ, God, or the gospel. They use Christian terms like these, but without any actual substance behind them. The focus is ENTIRELY on earthly things and a specific legalistic system. If you just choose to stay at your parents' home, that's one thing. But if you listen to the unbiblical legalism embedded in this documentary, that's quite another.

Believe it or not, I feel as though I haven't begun to cover everything unbiblical in this documentary. For another thing, they constantly emphasize the daughter's relationship to the father, when in the Bible, the focus is on CHILDREN obeying their PARENTS - no genders specified. But since this review is already quite long, I'm just going to make one last point that will hopefully destroy any credibility this documentary has: One of the young women held up as a great example of following their ideology was sexually abused by the founder of Vision Forum, Doug Phillips. If that doesn't disgust you, I don't know what will.

Some may claim that's ad hominem. It could be, but in Christianity, we have to consider more carefully whether this is actually the case. Jesus says you'll recognize false teachers by their fruit. Christ clearly taught that there's a connection between what we believe and what we do. Can we chalk up this despicable act to just a simple ""falling short""? Or is it possible that a legalistic system that sees women as not deserving autonomy and having to follow the visions of men first and foremost could actually make such horrible behavior make more sense?

You decide for yourself. But in the meantime, don't be wooed by the ""countercultural = godly"" propaganda of this film. Read the Bible for yourself. Figure out what it really says - and DOESN'T say - and make your decisions based on that. Follow what this movie CLAIMS to follow: God's vision as opposed to man's vision.",1438905600,15,6749,4.865970409051349
