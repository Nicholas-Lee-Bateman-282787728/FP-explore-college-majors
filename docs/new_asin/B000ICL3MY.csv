Every movie doesn't have to change the world.
Can't go wrong with those actresses.
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.",1183161600,,165,5.384615384615385
2655687,3,B000ICL3MY,"I wasn't looking for a weighty, emotional rollercoaster and this movie definitely isn't one.  Mothers and sons and the f---ed up relationships they sometimes have is the focus of the movie.  Works for me.  It made me laugh at times and that's what I wanted.",1177286400,,257,4.666666666666667
2655688,5,B000ICL3MY,"This Spanish movie has the Gay marriage theme, but is one of the funniest movies I've seen. It's with no doubt better than most of the gay american comedies. It has also a great casting, Carmen Maura, Marisa Paredes , Veronica Forque, Jorge Perrugoria(cuban actor from Strawberry and Chocolate)

If you love Pedro Almodovar you'll love this movie too, same style, more modern, very good actors.",1173225600,,394,4.96969696969697
2655689,2,B000ICL3MY,"The production values are good, but the story and situations are really hard to swallow. The film is mostly about the relationships of the women, not the gay sons. It was confusing having so many similar-aged women, stories swapping back & forth, constantly having to identify which mother belongs to which son. The situations were far too ridiculous, without being funny. Three of the women are having sex with people that are extremely unlikely to happen in real life. Just not believable. The gay guys are portrayed as weak shells.

Clearly this film concentrates on the mothers and could easily have been about straight children getting married. As a gay man, I feel insulted that the writers think writing the children as gay instantly makes the situation something to be laughed at. There aren't many films that I find difficult to sit through to the end, but this was one of them.

Note: This DVD is actually 4:3 letterbox (they couldn't be bothered to make it full anamorphic widescreen).",1168819200,4,996,4.887573964497041
2655690,1,B000ICL3MY,"Boring, trite, overdone, overcomplicated, unmoving mess.

I'd like to say this was watchable, but I couldn't manage to get through the whole thing.  Maybe you can.

I can't imagine that the creators or performers of this film would have thought that the infantile and childish banter that passes for dialogue would impress or entertain anyone.  Almost from the beginning, this film is silly and ridiculous, and not in a funny way.

I'd avoid this.  ""All Over The Guy"", ""I Think I Do"", and ""Adam & Steve"" are all funny, interesting wedding-themed movies that are far superior to this in every way.  I'd suggest you skip this one and see them.",1168646400,3,641,4.7727272727272725
2655691,1,B000ICL3MY,"Despite taking place at the first gay weddings in Spain, don't expect any insight about marriage and homosexuality from this film.  The couples could have been straight and the movie would have been the same.  Also, despite featuring three Spanish actresses made famous by their work with Pedro Almodovar (Veronica Forque, Carmen Maura and Marisa Paredes), don't expect them to play anything that remotely resembles the gender-bending, sophisticated yet entertaining characters they portrayed for Almodovar. In this movie, their talents are uniformly wasted under the guidance of a far less talented director. ""Queens"" is just a frothy, mindless, and intermitently amusing comedy that centers of the mothers of three gay male couples that are about to get married.  The women have plenty of star appeal, and they make the whole thing watchable, but one wishes that the director had fully taken advantage of their talents.  My best advice is to get the DVDs of Almodovar's Matador, Kika, What Have I Done To Deserve This, Women on the Verge, The Flower of My Secret or All About My Mother to see these actresses at their best.  As for the gay men in the movie, they're indistinct from any other six gay men in your average US gay movie.  The movie hints at troubles between them (related to physical beauty, infidelity, social class, and nationality) but it simply glosses over them.  Still, if you're looking for close to two hours of gay-themed visual bubble-gum, ""Queens"" will be good enough for you... just leave your brain out the door.",1165708800,6,1540,4.9921875
2655692,5,B000ICL3MY,"Director Manuel Gmez Pereira has long been respected both in Spain and around the world for his edgy, hilarious, clever and wildly entertaining films.  Writing with Yolanda Garca Serrano he has hit the mark with QUEENS ('Reinas') not only in taking on controversial subject matter and creating a successful comedy out of politically dangerous topic, but he has also done so by avoiding the usual pitfalls of gay stereotypes, making the focus of this film about Spain's approval of gay marriages not on the men involved, but instead on their mothers - the real Queens.

The story is fairly straightforward (if you will): there is to be a group wedding of gay couples in which three of the couples involved have frantic problems with their mothers' attending.  Some of the mothers approve, others despair, others take advantage of the situation to meet their own needs.  The effect of these 'double mothers-in-law' on the six men involved is packed with surprises, secrets, bizarre behavior, confessions, manifestations of life patterns less than reputable, and whirling dervish spins on acceptance.

The mothers are portrayed by some of the finest actresses in Spanish cinema: Marisa Paredes portrays Reyes, a famous actress (hysterically identified as Carmen Maura) whose class refuses to accept the cat that her son is marrying her gardener's son; Carmen Maura (yes) plays Magda, the owner of a new hotel chain catering to gays; Vernica Forqu is Nuria, a sex addicted nymphomaniac whose drives don't prevent her form bringing her lusts home to her family; Mercedes Sampietro plays Judge Helena who barely tolerates the effect of a public wedding of her son on her career but ends up being forced to perform the ceremony; and Argentine actress Betiana Blum is Ofelia, a restaurant owner/worker who arrives form Buenos Aires for the wedding with her runabout dog causing antics that threaten her son's relationship.  The sons are played to perfection and without the slightest bit of stereotypical behavior we usually encounter in these films by six excellent actors: Gustavo Salmern, Unax Ugalde,  Hugo Silva, Daniel Hendler, Paco Len, and Ral Jimnez.

Manuel Gmez Pereira makes fine use of flashbacks and flash-forwards that enhance the breakneck speed the story needs.  There is enough tenderness on the part of every actor to offset the near-slapstick comedy scenes, and in the end the movie leaves the audience with a true sense of celebration - not only for the characters involved in the story but also with the forward movement of human rights in Spain.  This is a highly entertaining, polished, classy film that deserves a very wide audience. Grady Harp, December 06",1165276800,5,2674,5.112385321100917

2655694,2,B000ICL3MY,"Since most of the films that we are able to see from abroad are usually the ""best"" that a country has to offer, it is heartening in a perverse way to witness that Spain can produce a clunker as silly and inane as anything that is foisted upon us here from American filmmakers.
Director Manuel Gmez Pereira's ""Queens"" (Las Reinas) is such a film which is particularly unfortunate because the subject matter: Spain's legalization of Gay marriage and in turn a sort of public, televised gang-marriage of 20 couples is a newsworthy and important social topic for a commercial film. Also on hand are the Queens of the title, the Mothers of several of the marriage-bound couples who have arrived in Madrid to support their sons and in a couple of cases not to support them.
Veteran Spanish/Argentine actresses such as Carmen Maura (the soon to be released ""Volver""), Veronica Forque' and Marisa Paredes (""All About My Mother"") besides sharing a history with Pedro Almodovar  also do their best with their poorly written parts and their experience and professionalism often shine through this wreck of  movie in which they find themselves.
To be sure there are moments of fun but Pereira's slap-dash mise en scene and loosey-goosey editing dulls the impact of the film as a whole. ""Queens"" then is another case of first class ingredients making a very mediocre, meatless, flavorless stew.",1157932800,2,1381,4.92274678111588
2655695,5,B000ICL3MY,"Introduced to this film at Here! TV.  Can't get enough of it.  It's one of the best comedies in my collection.  Those mothers and their shennigans, delightful.  One of them also stars in Amandolvar's Law of Desire.  The sons in this film are really great - each so indiviually defined.  Beautiful story.  Prepare to laugh!  Another character is the homophobic father (gardener) also in an Almandovar film - Bad Education.  You will love it!  (Spanish with English subtitles)",1364083200,,474,4.961538461538462
2655696,4,B000ICL3MY,One great effort at depicting not only a gay man's mother's behaviour in a latin country but also the effects of money and a class system in gay life. Very entertaining.,1345075200,,169,4.483870967741935
2655697,4,B000ICL3MY,"I would typically give this type of silly movie three stars but among the cast are two of my favorite actors Carmen Maura and Marisa Paredes. Their performances are always wonderful, hence my reason for purchasing this movie.

It is a progressive movie about mothers who are supportive of their gay sons who are taking advantage of the new marriage laws for gays in Spain. It covers the lives of several gay couples (and their parents) and the problems they face such as social, economic conflict of families united through wedlock, the shock and adjustments for parents of gay sons who are trying to adjust and accept their gay sons as they are, sexual deviant behavior is thrown in the mix and all is quite humorous and silly.

It is a mixture of light, silly humor intermingled with the progressive changes for gay rights which can be a delicate topic for people. It's not a terribly moving or thought provoking movie but it was enjoyable nonetheless.",1314057600,,954,4.740963855421687
2655698,5,B000ICL3MY,"The movie obviously plays with the word ""queens"". Queens are the grooms who are planning their collective marriage soon after Spain recognition of their right; truth be told no one of them is a real ""queen"", maybe only Miguel, the son of wealthy hotel chain owner, Carmen Maura, who has problem to be in synthony with his future husband's mother and also her dog. His lover is fitness trainer Oscar who is all but not flamboyant. Then there is lawyer Hugo and his politician future husband Narciso. Where Hugo is still fighting his homosexuality, Narciso is all for being out and proud... but there will be some cheating around from both side that will put in danger their future marriage. And finally there are sweet lovers Jonas and Rafa, two former teenager fiancees that, despite social status difference and the issue between their respective parents, fought against everyone and everything to finally be able to claim their love.

BTW the second meaning of the word ""queens"" refers to all the great female actresses who play the role of the mothers.

The movie is a classical example of modern Spanish cinema, a choral movie full of situation and great actors, with a funny mood that never let go down the smile.",1278288000,2,1218,4.795238095238095
2655699,5,B000ICL3MY,"I saw this at my local video (video...oooh, I'm I dating myself?), and was really tired. It was Friday night, didn't want to go out, and too tired for to be outraged by another Michael Myers or expose film. I saw this, and thougt, ""okay, this is going to be silly, but needed a gay escape movie.

Within the first 10 minutes, I thought, ""okay, the usual suspects, incredibly happy, model couples, living a lavish lifestyle that most gay and lesbians really can't afford (at least not without racking up the cards)."" As the movie started to unfold, and I recognized many of the actors from Almodovar and other Spanish languaged, films. They kept appearing, and yet more. I thought,""Well Antonio Banderas started his career with great films, but had to do films that paid the bills too, why not these folks?"" It was clear, that the actors chose to participate in this movie, because they wanted to (sure, they got paid, but actors need ""green love,"" too). They all did a great job.

This film really surprised me. In fact, so much, that I watched it with my roommate, and later with a friend. A total of 3 viewings in 1 weekend! Everyone really enjoyed it.

I ended up buying this film. Yeah, this film will never win a Golden Globe Award, nor does it deserve one, but it was a great escape, yet left me with things to think about. In particular, the timeliness of this movie, as nations and communities around the world are starting to valid gay marriages (and Spain, or course, in the fore front). I'll leave it at that.

I'll be watching this one with other friends, in years to come. Enjoy!",1252713600,,1592,4.517361111111111

With high production values, and some of Spain's finest actresses, this film is bound to have a wide base of appeal.

2655703,4,B000ICL3MY,"'Reinas' features three significant muses of Pedro Almodvar - Vernica Forqu, Carmen Maura and Marisa Paredes.  The backstory is that director / collaborating writer Manuel Gmez Pereira wanted to feature four Almodvarian staples, targeting Victoria Abril as his fourth (which would have been a real coup).  Instead, the fourth role went to Mercedes Sampietro, not as well known to US audiences but a regal presence in Spanish television.  The fifth Queen is Betiana Blum, an Argentinian whose high-energy presence is perfect for this often-screwball comedy.

Reinas is all about these ladies. That their gay sons are getting married seems hardly the point to Gmez Pereira - those young actors are just part of the woodwork, staying mostly to the sidelines as these ladies chew through the scenery.

There are two standouts on the male side though: Llus Homar - who US audiences know as the tempted priest in Bad Education - is a Catalan ringer for Kelsey Grammer (he's Paredes' gardener/wanna-be paramour); and it's a delight to see the wonderful Cuban actor Jorge Perugorra (he's hotel owner Maura's chef/dish on the side).  [You want to see great acting?

The movie itself is like an homage to Almodvar (Paredes' character even references him directly), but in look and feel I think it's closer to the nice little movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/KM-0-Kilometer-Zero-Original-Spanish-Version-w-English-Subtitles/dp/B000OFJ606/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">KM.0 (Kilometer Zero.
