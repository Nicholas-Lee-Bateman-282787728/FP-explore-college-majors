8316379,3,B001KWK0XO,Good workout but something is lacking maybe it's the music/ motivation... something. It takes discipline to sit on a spinning bike solo and go the distance. I have lots of Coach Troys cds/and tapes. I always feel great when I'm done.,1400976000,,233,4.7073170731707314
8316380,5,B001KWK0XO,"Fell in love with the Spinervals series this winter because I can just put the DVD in and be coached on what to do.  This is exqactly what I need as you're told what gear to be in, how hard your effort should be, whether to sit/stand, in the drops/aero/on the brake hoods.  So if you're like me and have no idea how to train on a bicycle, this DVD is exactly what we're looking for!",1303084800,,382,4.0131578947368425
