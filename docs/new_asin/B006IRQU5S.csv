4990617,4,B006IRQU5S,"Da Jillians DVD's ""NMTZ"" und ""Shred"" zu meinen favorisierten Fitness-DVD's zhlen, wollte ich -auf der Suche nach einem
fordernden Cardio-Training- auch die ""Kickbox Fast Fix"" ausprobieren:
Sie hat mich nicht enttuscht!

Im Tutorial-Video werden die Punches und Kicks vorab durch Jillian langsam gezeigt und ausfhrlich erklrt.
Ich empfehle jedem, sich diese Bewegungsablufe zuerst zu verinnerlichen, denn die folgenden 3 Workouts  20 Min.
sind wirklich temporeich und nicht einfach!

Workout 1 konzentriert sich hierbei auf den Oberkrpers, Workout 2 auf den Unterkrper und Workout 3 auf die Bauchmuskeln.

Bislang habe ich nur ""Workout 1"" gebt, mich dabei auf die richtige Ausfhrung und Krperhaltung konzentriert.
Das Training ist fordernd... und ich freue mich auf die weiteren Einheiten!

Fazit:
Hat gute Chancen sich bei meinen Lieblings-DVDs einzureihen, die ""Shred"" und ""NMTZ"" gefallen mir persnlich bislang jedoch besser!",1331078400,,926,5.880597014925373
4990618,4,B006IRQU5S,"Just got this delivered yesterday and couldn't wait to try it.  Watched the entire dvd first to get familiar with some of the moves.  I've done kickboxing before but a lot of these moves are more complicated.  Not that that's a bad thing.  Jillian really keeps you moving throughout the entire workout.  I really like that it's truly 20 minutes long.  It's a quick workout but pretty intense.  I was sweating by the end of the first workout.  I did Level 1 and 3 together and felt awesome after.  Loved Level 3 with new ab moves, that's my trouble area.  Plan on trying Level 2 soon.  I'm a big fan of Jillian's workouts and love having this as part of my workout library.  Nice change of pace to keep me moving and motivated.  Will alternate with strenth training and hope to be bikini ready in 3 months.",1331078400,2,805,4.394557823129252
4990619,5,B006IRQU5S,Sending it back.. my DVD is BLANK.. just got it yesterday and put it in after doing my PUMP workout and before I go off to see the trainer.. and it was blank.. I am so bummed.. I will report later when the new one arrives ;) I'm down 178 pounds baby and no one is stopping me NOW !,1331078400,2,281,3.7
4990620,5,B006IRQU5S,"I've been waiting a while for this to come out, and I have to say, it didn't disappoint!

I love Jillian's Cardio Kickbox workout she did a while ago so I was excited to find out she was coming out with another one (I love to kickbox). I'm pretty picky when it comes to kickboxing because I want to sweat. A lot of the DVDs out there aren't bad for beginners, but I don't really sweat. I need a challenge.

I was very pleased with this workout. She has three 20-minute workouts. Level 1 works on upper body, Level 2 on lower body, and Level 3 works on abs.

Even though I did Levels 1 and 2 together, I was sweating already after Level 1.

Just a warning though; some of the moves are a little complicated. If you're just starting out, make sure you check out the tutorial on the DVD because I had some trouble following some moves/combos (although they weren't impossible or anything).

This video (compared to her Cardio Kickbox DVD) is more kickboxing whereas her first DVD is more cardio than kickboxing. There's definitely cardio involved, but you do much more punching and kicking combos.

I actually think I might combine her first kickboxing DVD (Cardio Kickbox) and then do a level from FastFix - that's a sure way to bring the sweat!",1331078400,41,1243,4.453744493392071
4990621,4,B006IRQU5S,"Wow first off this is a little different JM setup than we are used to.  In that I mean there are more girls in the video.  I like it.  Second the music can be loud at times and almost drowns out Jillian's voice!  At least if it was just music I'd be fine because I'm a visual learner so I picked up pretty much everything.  Now I'm not a fan of workouts that don't explain moves beforehand and just launch into them and expect you to keep up.  (She does go through the workout pretty fast though but there is a tutorial so you know what to expect) Thank goodness Jillian walks you through each move beforehand.  Some of the moves are a little longer than just a kick or a jab cross; it took a few times to get the moves down for me (haha as I'm awkwardly kicking or swatting at the air, and I thought I was coordinated).  I was able to do all 3 workouts at once.  They aren't too hard but they are hard enough.  Me being avidly fit (just getting into Insanity and P90X) and having all of Jillian's videos, I like this one.  She keeps saying how she had a kickboxing background and I was wondering when she would release a kickboxing video!  This is good, it is challenging and above all it is fun.",1330992000,4,1197,4.112068965517241
4990622,5,B006IRQU5S,"I bought this DVD at Target yesterday and did Level 1 (Upper Body) and Level 3 (Abs) this morning.  I found them to be challenging but also kind of fun (and fun isn't usually a word I use when describing a Jillian Michael's workout lol).  It was nice to see Anita and Natalie from 30-Day Shred again too.  These workouts really are only 20 minutes each but as usual Jillian doesn't waste a single minute.  You get a good blend of cardio (mostly kickboxing obviously but there are also things like butt-kicks and suicide runs) and sculpting (rows, flies, headbangers) and the time flies by.  Some days I just don't have time to do a long workout but now with these I don't really have an excuse because they are only 20 minutes each!  There were some exercises in the Ab workout that I've never done before which is always a nice surprise.  I am a huge fan of Jillian's workouts and this one is no different.  I highly recommend it!

Update 3/8/12: I did Level 2 (Lower Body) this morning and LOVED it!  Like the other levels the time flies by and it's never boring.  I felt so energized when I was finished and I was sweating a lot so I know I burned a bunch of calories.  I really liked the backward lunge/forward kick combo.  The dreaded jump squats make an appearance and even though I hate them I'm glad they're on there because they are so effective.  This DVD is one of Jillian's best for sure.",1330992000,211,1400,4.355212355212355
4990623,4,B006IRQU5S,"Found this on sale early at local book store so grabbed. Someone must have messed up and stocked early.

Similar to her other 20 minute workouts - there are 3 levels and kickboxing it is. I had a good sweat after doing level 1 and really good one when I did 1 & 2 together. I like that there are more girls and they do the workout with great intensity.

So while I did like it and will put in my rotation, being an avid Tae-boer did not find it extremely challenging. There are many similarities but I find I was increasing tempo on my own for some of the exercises as I'm used to being able to do more advanced versions from my Tae-bo days. It is a nice change but would not put as one of my favorite JM's one -  Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism is still top of the list for me.",1330905600,66,775,3.9870967741935486
4990624,5,B006IRQU5S,"I just did the first workout and was dripping in sweat by the end of the 20 mins (I am fit to begin with). Love the quick pace, variety of moves and how great I feel overall. I also purchased Get Ripped in 30 and plan to switch it up between the two. These are my first experiences with JM but I love her.",1330732800,4,305,3.78125
4990625,4,B006IRQU5S,"I swear by ALL of Jillian Michaels DVDs. I own almost every one of them, and 1 year later, I still frequently work out to each and every one of them. I was so excited the other day when I found this Kickbox Fast Fix for sale. Strangely enough, I came onto Amazon to find a new Jillian Michaels DVD, specifically wondering why she had never released a kickboxing dvd, being that it was where she began! Soo excited, and absolutely cannot WAIT until the release of the DVD. It is going to be a guaranteed good and hard burn.",1330041600,3,522,4.23
4990626,1,B006IRQU5S,DVD-R's are notorious for not lasting very long.  They start pixalating over time and soon become unplayable.  I have had video's in the past on DVD-r's and they do not last as long as DVD's.,1329609600,37,191,4.428571428571429
4990627,5,B006IRQU5S,"I own nearly every Jillian Michaels DVD.  I have to say, this immediately became one of my absolute favorites, and that's saying something!  Heart-pumping, adrenaline-pounding kickboxing cardio with strength built in.  I couldn't ask for more!  I often have to combine one of her strength workouts with a cardio workout to feel like I've nailed both, which is fine when I have the time, but this is EVERYTHING in just 20 minutes!  INCREDIBLE!  And it's just so much fun!

Workout 1: Cardio + Upper Body
Workout 2: Cardio + Lower Body
Workout 3: Cardio + Abs

I have a taekwondo background (ten years ago), and I still found this challenging.  The pace is excellent, the moves are engaging, and she doesn't waste time slowing it down during the workouts.  Be sure to watch her overview of the moves if you're worried about form or keeping up.  I just expected to fall behind the first few times I did it, and even while doing so, it was still an amazing workout!  I always sweat and huff when I'm doing Jillian Michaels, but this was a whole new level...and without any of the moves being too hard for my levelI come from a family of weak shoulders, so most of her more intense workouts include plank moves I just can't do yet (making progress every day, though!).  I got an advanced workout with absolutely nothing I couldn't do!

If you like kickboxing, martial arts, or just 100% cardio with your strength training built inthis is THE BEST workout DVD I've ever seen!  And I've done lots of Beachbody, Jillian Michaels, and a few others.  Get this and get ripped!

Can Jillian get a Golden Globe for this or something ;)",1519516800,4,1622,4.576388888888889
4990628,5,B006IRQU5S,Great work out. Love this one. Challenging but not so hard that it's discouraging. Also a great stress reliever!,1519344000,,112,4.947368421052632

4990630,5,B006IRQU5S,Loved it. Fast workouts. Not so hard I couldn't do them but enough to work up a sweat. I would say I'm in moderate shape. Probably not tough enough for those who are into the more intense workouts.,1519084800,,197,4.2105263157894735
4990631,5,B006IRQU5S,I love this workout!  I use this dvd and adjust to use with my heavy bag on days when i'm feeling the need to actually punch something physical rather than just air.  But it is still a good workout even without using a heavy bag like they do in the dvd.  I love that its only 22 min and not an hour like a lot of workout dvds since i don't have that amount of time to exercise.,1511395200,2,377,3.8076923076923075
4990632,5,B006IRQU5S,This dvd is hard and so so useful! Thank you jillian! I've lost 25lbs in 3 months. I'm 28 yrs old with 2 kids. Im back down to my prebaby weight and went from size 12 in pant size to a size 6. Of course this is a combination of working out 5x a week only with this DVD and eating healthy. Lots of protien!

4990634,4,B006IRQU5S,I have a handful of Jillian videos. This was my 1st kickboxing one. It took a couple of times to get the moves down & now I really enjoy. I wish the workouts were more than 20 min. I usually do 1 1/2 workouts each time & then switch it up.,1505174400,,239,3.7058823529411766
4990635,5,B006IRQU5S,"I read many reviews before buying, just because I had another Jillian workout a few years ago that I didn't like.  However, this one warrants all the positive reviews. The three 20 minute workouts are easy to follow, but difficult enough to get your heart rate up and the time flies by!  I did all three this morning equaling an hour and I was really sweating by the first 10 minutes in.  Like another review said, the upper body and ab workout are not just toning. She incorporates cardio as well in all three, which I love.  You will get a great workout if you only do one when short on time.  Unlike some workouts that claim to be kickboxing, but actually not, this one is quite bit of kickboxing and Jillian has some interesting kicking moves that keep my interest as I can get easily bored.  I'll definitely be putting this one in my rotation of dvds.  Thanks, Jillian!",1505001600,2,874,4.425
4990636,4,B006IRQU5S,"Well.. I like it in that it's a good workout..but it's quite difficult. Mind you I don't mean difficult like you need to be in stupid crazy shape to do it.. more difficult like you need a really good memory and to be really coordinated. Trying to follow along with the moves was super difficult, I'd need to do this for ages to get to the point of comfortably learning it to be able to really follow the routine.",1503532800,,412,4.227848101265823

4990639,5,B006IRQU5S,"I own probably 95% of Jillian' s body of work. This is one of her DVDs I use the most. It's a FANTASTIC combo of strength and cardio moves, and you get an awesome calorie burn for each workout even though they're short. Fantastic bang for your buck in terms of time spent. Do two or even all three if you want more out of it. I often do two, and burn upwards of 300 calories that way. I also bought a pair of weighted gloves to wear for these, and noticed a definite uptick in my upper body strength shortly afterward. (You don't have to do that, of course, but it was a way to add some more challenge for myself after using the DVD for over a year). I didn't find it hard to learn the moves, but the tutorial is good for breaking them all down. Like anything else, it gets easier with practice! I love this DVD and when I wear it down to the point where it no longer functions, I'll buy it again.",1500681600,3,897,4.016759776536313

And in fact, the last 2 months have tried other workouts from other instructional dvds, pinterest, bodybuilding.com etc. , and lo and behold I started gaining inches; not hot. So I am back to Jillian. Pretty well done. You cannot go wrong with Jillian. She has an easy modify and more advanced modified in almost every DVD and if not then she verbally tells you what the modifier is. I cannot say enough about this truly amazing instructor.",1464134400,4,531,4.6
4990682,5,B006IRQU5S,"Love this workout, as with most of jillian's workouts.  It include three different workouts focused on different areas. Each of the work outs still has a pretty good cardio mix to them since you are punching and kicking your way through them.  As with any workout--you will get the best results and get your heartrate up where it needs to be by putting in the effort (ie punching hard through each move).  Great video to get you sweating from the comfort of your own home and easy to fit in when you have a free 30 minutes.",1463616000,,523,4.371134020618556

I used it once when I got it and it DID motivate me to get into better shape! So that is AWESOME!! But, I used it again recently, and although I CAN do the moves, it is very fast paced and I can't keep up.

Jillian works all parts of the body. She does move around allot,and nothing is consistent in the workout. Some of the team members will be doing the total opposite of what she just explained to do. When she moves around the cameraman moves and unless you know the workout you will lose track of what you are supposed to be doing. I have many Jillian DVDs,this one is not made well.

She mixes some strength in there as well, but the majority of the workout is cardio. I highly suggest watching the tutorial first. The moves are fast paced and she doesn't really demonstrate while doing the workout. I saw another review that said it is a ""one-sided workout"". It's not. You do the workout in your ""fighting stance"" and she will say to either do a front or back move which means right or left leg.

4990791,4,B006IRQU5S,"This workout series is good, but my main complaint is Jillian doesn't work both sides of the body evenly. However she does do the routines in circuits, so you can simply change sides. It was just a surprise, seeing that's usually a key factor in any DVD workout. Otherwise, each 20 minute series is at a good intensity and level for intermediate to advanced. She's a little annoying, but that's par for the course for DVDs.",1437696000,,423,4.578947368421052
4990812,4,B006IRQU5S,"Even for those already in shape and exercise regularly will find any of these short workouts challenging. I think they definitely qualify as your HIIT workout, which means they're great for losing weight. They're also fun--combinations of punches and kicks along with other aerobic exercises make for a great mix. The 20 minutes go fast.

Only criticism I have is each workout claims to concentrate on one specific part of the body--upper, lower, and core--but I believe that's an exaggeration. All parts of the body are affected by each workout. This DVD is first and foremost for cardio, not building strength in one particular part of the body.",1437177600,,647,4.9907407407407405

I tried to return it and by copyright laws, after the package is opened, it cant be returned. I ended up purchasing Cathe Friedrick ""Kick, Punch and Crunch & Legs and Glutes"" DVD and it was much better. Higher intensity and slower pace. She goes through all of the moves then puts them all together. On my first time, I finished the 68min DVD and burned over 700 calories. I enjoyed it.",1433203200,,520,4.316326530612245
4990819,5,B006IRQU5S,"I got hooked on Jillian's workouts after I did 30 day shred. Now, I have 4 of her DVDs (30 Day Shred, Ripped in 30, Killer Buns and Thighs, and Kickbox Fastfix). I do a different DVD each day. This particular one is my favorite so far. The workouts are a bit shorter, but for me they are the most fun. I had never tried kickboxing until this DVD, and I find I look forward to doing the kickboxing workouts more than any of the other Jillian workouts I have. They are all hard, but I would say workout 2 is the hardest (these workouts don't get progressively harder as in her other DVDs. Instead, she works out the upper body in workout 1, the lower body in workout 2, and the abs in workout 3). Since they are a bit shorter, I've been doing them with 5lb weights so that I'm really getting the most out of them, and it has really made a difference.

The moves were hard at first but the more you do the videos the easier they get. You don't work both sides because if you were actually fighting you wouldn't punch or kick equally with both sides. You wouldn't switch your stance half way through a fight. This video is great.",1429401600,,421,4.341772151898734

I feel like I'm getting an excellent work out in the short about of time it takes to do! I'd recommend this to anyone.  Each of the three sections (arms, legs, and) have four small portions (approx 5 mins each) with a routine you repeat twice.  Some are complaining because she stays on one side the whole time but you can VERY easily switch sides since you repeat each routine twice. It's really fun and 20 mins seems very short with this video.  I used to be in great shape and I would have used this video then and now I'm unfortunately in not great shape and it is perfect now.

The hardest level to me is workout 2, for you legs. The easiest being workout 3, for your abs. That is my opinion of course. Now, if you've never kick boxed, she does have a tutorial in this one. The first time I did it, I was stupid and did not watch the tutorial, so I was kicking and punching uncoordinatedly. But, I went back and watched it and it helped tremendously. I do not think this is a beginner DVD, as in never exercised in your life beginner. You should do something more simple, like her 30-day shred, or even ripped in 30, that way you can work up to a more advanced level. When you get better, get this DVD. I recommend it.

4990875,2,B006IRQU5S,"I am a huge fan of Jillian Michaels. I began work outing at home when I bought Ripped in 30 and Extreme Shed and Shred. I thoroughly enjoy her videos. I have also consistently done her One Week Shred, 30 day Shred, No More Trouble Zones, 6 Week Six Pack, Yoga Meltdown, Shred-It with Weights, Yoga Inferno, and Hard Body. With the exception of her yoga videos, her videos are all amazing. That it why I was so disappointed with this video. I got it for Christmas and I tried it the next day. It is made up of 3, 20 ,invites segments (upper body, lower body, abs). I did the ab segment first. Although I ended the workout with a decent amount of sweat, my abs did not feel worked. The moves were rushed, so the second time I did the workout I was able to follow along better. However, the other two segments were not much more challenging. If you are looking for a challenge, you would have to do all 3 segment PLUS another workout. Besides the lack of challenge, the women she enlisted to demonstrate the moves were annoying and most looked out of shape. I was happy to recognize Natalie. If you are looking for a great workout look her up on YouTube on the GymRa channel.",1420761600,,1172,4.283783783783784

Jillian would say something like ""OK next we jab, uppercut, kick front, 2 hooks, slide up, side kick, back kick."" Well,that's not quite dancing, but it might as well be as I cannot remember all those moves at that kind of pace. I had to stop the dvd, go back and listen, watch again, then try to remember the moves in the correct order, and finally I said F-it, and I just kept moving, doing anything to keep up with the pace of the workout.

4990887,5,B006IRQU5S,"This is by far one of my favorite Jillian Michaels DVD. I happen to be a very big fan of kickboxing. I go to kickboxing class at my gym regularly, and this workout is great! There are 3 twenty minute workouts on this DVD. If you feel like working out for longer than 20 minutes, you can always do part of another or all of them. Jillian seems to ""get it done"" in the short amount of time. My favorite is the second workout on the DVD. I would definitely recommend this workout. It is totally worth it.",1414886400,,501,4.122448979591836
4990888,3,B006IRQU5S,"Sorry to be a Debbie Downer-- I have multiple Jillian videos, (6 week 6 pack, Ripped in 30, Killer Buns and Thighs and 30 Day Shred), I loved every one of them, use them consistently as my exclusive workouts with fantastic results.  Unfortunately, I can't say I even remotely liked this one. It lacks every element that has made her videos successful in the past.  1. Its not accessible.  Its just not great for anyone who has never kickboxed before, or otherwise has participated in sequenced, synchronized activities (dancing, aerobics), like myself.  The best thing about the other videos is that they were accessible to everyone regardless of fitness level due to a beginner version of the work out being demonstrated in sequence with the more advanced version of the individual exercises.  This video has a separate tutorial, that while helpful, would really be better embedded into the workout, as the terms can be unfamiliar and difficult to recall at such a fast pace.  The work out also moves very quickly, too quickly to follow.  2. Its unfairly intimidating, because of the environment. Simply, the dancers are also incredibly distracting, and even down right obnoxious.  There are too many of them. They are never in sequence at any time in the work out, and the camera angles change so rapidly to focus on individual ladies, that you can't mimic the movements in a consistent sequence, making the moves even more difficult to learn.  Part of the reason I exercise at home is because a gym environment is distracting.  I become subconsciously fixated on the people around me rather than my workout, even with headphones.  It eventually makes me self-conscious and is largely frustrating to me.  This video mimics that type of stressful environment; the ego is also dripping on the women on this video, the attitude was ugly.  3. Requires too much of a specific space.  In the one cardio sequence she has you do suicide runs, which doesn't work in a tiny living room.  Also, you need to be on a surface that allows for easy pivoting, otherwise you are going to twist your knees and ankles.  I just didn't like it.  You may have different results, but I highly recommend watching this on youtube (most of her videos are online for free, intentionally according to her facebook page), before purchasing.",1414540800,9,2312,4.857142857142857

4990890,4,B006IRQU5S,"I really like this DVD. Admittedly, I don't know anything about kickboxing, but I feel powerful and even more energetic after the workout is over.

And I know-- I know it's called ""Kickbox fast fix."" I still think the pacing is difficult to follow along with until you've gone through the paces at least half a dozen times. The short tutorial does help some, if you pause the video frequently and repeat Jillian's instructions repeatedly. I found the third workout in the set (focusing on the core) to be the easiest to follow along with and started there. Once I was familar with the speed and a greater range of moves, the more I enjoyed the DVD. A good buy overall.",1414022400,2,668,4.520661157024794

4990893,4,B006IRQU5S,"This is a 4 and a half star review. I truly enjoy Jillian's workouts and think she is fantastic as a trainer. The only reason I deducted half a star was because on occasion after Jillian has started you on a circuit half the ladies will be kicking and the other half will be doing a knee lift. It just feels a little untidy compared to her other amazing DVDs.

I also think she could have used a smaller cast which would have helped the production. While watching the DVD before actually trying it I found one of the women to be unbelievably annoying to watch. She is way too enthusiastic in her movements and claps after each exercise. Thankfully once you actually do the DVD you do not notice her much so don't ever let that put you off.

I did note how a lot of people complained it was hard to keep up with her combinations and on some level I agree. The first couple of times it was hard to follow her exactly but so long as you are doing the punches and kicks it's not the end of the world if they are not in the exact order she does them, it's about keeping the heart rate up.

I'm using a lot of Jillian's DVDs to help me get back into shape. I have put on quite a lot of weight over the past two years. I really like this because it's 20 minutes which is just long enough to make me sweat and I cannot find an excuse not to do this workout.",1413763200,2,1349,4.026119402985074

I've done the Ripped in 30 and the 30 Day Shred religiously. When my family moved homes we took too long to unpack our boxes, so, I thought it might be a good opportunity to get a new workout DVD  :) So I got the Kickbox Fast Fix. I've only done the first workout, but It doesn't go a minute over 20 minutes which is a HUGE selling point for me. I want to get a good workout in first thing and then be done for the day. I've definitely gotten this with this video. I know 20 minutes is way short, and surprisingly it feels even shorter - it goes by that quick. I like having a workout I KNOW I can and will stick to. For me, an hour a day is not something I'll stick to consistently - but 20 minutes I can.
I sweat hard with this video - which I love! I tend to believe it's not really a good workout unless your body is purging a lot of sweat!

(I'm 5'3 & I weigh 130 lbs)
Workout 1: 157 calories
Workout 2: 156 calories
Workout 3: 153 calories

All together I burned 466 calories in one hour!!! That is pretty amazing considering I only burned 368 calories doing Jillian's Banish Fat Boost Metabolism (which is about 55 minutes long).

I love that these workouts are only 20 min each; I can choose to only do 20 min if I'm short on time, or I can do a 40 min or 60 min workout if I have more time.  Jillian & her girls are great in this video & Jillian also gives a great tutorial if you're brand new to kickboxing.  Some reviewers mentioned that the workouts were unbalanced, but I didn't find this to be true.

I had a horrifying experience when my life was threatened a few years ago.  I first gained weight until one day I had enough with feeling like a victim.  I picked first 30 day shred.  Once I got through those I stacked Jillian's videos to at least an hour a day.  I began cross training.  One day I found this.  Yeah one of the girls messes up in the DVD.  If you do it a few times you never notice.  Jillian is a trained black belt I believe.  This DVD was the first to make me feel proud of myself.  And then I did it everyday until I lost seventy pounds.  Three years later I wore it out and had to get another.  This is my quick DVD if I am short for time or I do all three.  Jillian Michaels I believe saved me from a life of self pity and hopelessness.  I always get her newest DVD and always do something of hers twice a week with my other workouts.  If you listen to her you will get there.  Also love 30 day shred, Boost your Metabolism, Extreme Shred and No More trouble Zones.  Best instructor hands down.

Great for those days when you can't get to the gym and are short on time. There are 3 separate workouts, one for arms, one for lower body and one for abs. I do the abs and arms most often. If you have more time, do all 3 in one shot, great total body workout.",1398988800,,407,4.037037037037037

She especially likes that she can pick specific areas to target and choose a workout based on her mood or physical needs for the day.  We've learned to stay out the way when she's doing it, so a rear kick doesn't hit us as we walk by. The workouts are quick, fun, and a nice change of pace, especially when you are feeling a little frustrated.",1397433600,,449,4.1976744186046515
4990940,2,B006IRQU5S,"I bought this because I love JM's workout videos.  However, this one was an epic fail.  There were way too many combinations for each exercise set.  I was concentrating more on what move comes next than the form.  The pace was fast which is good for the cardio component but I needed a slowed down demo before each combination exercise began.  I watched the video more than worked out with it.",1397347200,,393,4.47887323943662
4990941,2,B006IRQU5S,"I have to first say that I love the Jillian Michaels DVDs. I already own several and wanted to switch it up with this one.

This workout is SOOOO fast. And so is the tutorial. She honestly shows you the moves tops 3 times. And not slowly. I am pretty fit and could not keep up. Rewatched the tutorial and still can't catch on. This is going in the reject pile.

If you have a little bit of experience in kickboxing or maybe some dance training, you would definitely be able to catch on. Unfortunately, I am a runner & strength training and this is just not for me.",1397260800,,564,4.165137614678899

It's 3 different workouts, upper body, lower body, and abs; very beginner level at best!! I am no advance workout pro and Jillian Michaels DVDs usually kicks my butt!!! I usually am breaking a sweat on level 1 of her DVD's. This DVD is 20 minutes of nothing!! I tried all three different workouts, and I felt like I had done nothing.  I guess kick boxing isn't her thing, she should definitely stick with the 3-2-1 interval training she does.

Some of the moves are pretty complicated/awkward so it's hard to learn (and who really wants to sit through the slow tutorial?).  Some moves really bust your knees if you are not on a gym floor (I exercise on carpet and it drags when she makes you 180 on one foot quickly back and forth.)  Some segments are weights, I was hoping for all cardio.  Like I said, I like most of her stuff, but this one wasn't my favorite.  I gave it three stars because if you don't include the awkward parts its not too bad.",1395446400,,572,4.201834862385321

I am not sure why this is, if it's planned, or a mistake  other than that, it's Jillian as usual, great, fun, workout, efficient, targeting way more than 1 thing at all times a full body workout, and the models are fun to watch.. use great form, as usual in her DVD's..",1392940800,,401,4.194805194805195

I have done Tae Bo in studio and own several Billy Blanks DVDs, and in my opinion this DVD is very very advanced.  Jillian moves you into complicated combinations very quickly. I understand that it is meant to be 20 minute work outs, but I did not feel that rushing through complex combinations without going through them slowly at least once is worth the risk of injury.  Many of the combinations require twisting back and forth with punch and front kick/back kick combinations on one leg in a way I felt could cause me to twerk my knee. It is pure anatomy.  Your knee is meant to hinge front to back, not twist from side to side. I found myself either wobbling, or modifying. I've noticed my knees afterwards were on fire as well. Not good.  I don't find I have these issues with Tae Bo. Don't get me wrong, I love her strength training DVDS, but I think that those may be her real strength.",1392163200,2,1016,4.270833333333333

Not only was it not that great of a work out, but one of the participants/ work out extras (not sure what they're called) is annoying to the point of distraction. It's like she mainlined a 20 oz of Monster right before the cameras went on.

4990967,5,B006IRQU5S,"Having done the transition from working out in a gym to a home-gym, I rely on my DVD's and equipment to workout.  I have a stack of workout DVD's that would blow your mind.  By far, this one is the one I use the most.  Mainly because it is great for a short, total-body workout.  I alternate one of these every-other-workout, because who has the time to workout for 2 hours every time?  It's Jillian, so all three are butt-kicking even though they're only 20 minutes.  She combines strength and cardio together, which is the most effective way to workout.  I LOVE these!  And really wish she'd do another DVD with new ones!!!

The only two things I don't care for is that a) she doesn't work both sides for every move, which is typical of kickboxing.  So, I choose to switch sides myself on the 2nd time of each circuit and b) since she's keeping these to 20 minutes, there isn't time to complete each circuit every time.  So, I will actually pause at the end of the 2nd time through and finish myself so it's completed (if it's one she didn't have time to complete).  Guess, I'm a freak like that!

They are all effective, but I needed a change.  This workout is fun and fast-paced, and it does get my heart pumping.  The only negative for me is that I'm not familiar with the kickboxing terms, and I really have to think about it while I do it.

I have used Michaels' workouts for at least five years.  She is safe, effective, and she knows her stuff.  However - and this is a big however for me since music is my main motivation in a workout - she has no sense of rhythm, bless her heart.  I have to learn her routines by heart and then turn down the audio and use my own music.  It's not even that she has bad music.  She just cannot keep a beat in a bag.  This obviously does not bother most people.  It bugs the bejeezus out of me; I grew up as a jazz dancer and then became a certified aerobics instructor.  Otherwise, I would give this workout a five.  Seriously, this is the ONLY reason I give her workouts anything lower than a five.  But ignoring music really, really bugs me.  I hope someday she finds the beat.

Considering that, i thought this could be another great workout, but i couldn't be more wrong.

The way the levels are done is just messy it doesn't have the usual easy to hard sequence. And the worst of all is that's impossible to mirror Jillian's movements as she does them only of one side. If you're not an experienced kick-boxer or have some backgrond on it stay away from this workout or you'll be frustrated like me.",1387670400,6,615,4.54054054054054
4990987,3,B006IRQU5S,"I like Jillian's workouts; I am always quoting her to my students--""Get comfortable with being uncomfortable"" and I have purchased all of her workouts.  But I think her kickboxing is the least of my favorites because she is just simply stubborn about insisting that we stay in the stance with our lead punch.  Because of this, she's got us doing all these whirling around and kicking from the back foot when we could just as easily just switch sides and work out both legs equally.  I have twisted my knee trying to do some of these.

I am 57 years old and in fantastic shape because I have been a cyclist, runner, swimmer, and all around athlete all my life.  I don't know how many there are of us in-shape 50-something women out there, but people like Jillian are going to need to think about us.

More older people are going to want to stay in shape, but we are not going to be whirling around and kicking behind our backs.  It's just not safe.  Still, kickboxing is one of the best ways to shape up the core and upper body and improve balance.

Also, I think these videos could use a few older people.  I can do just about anything in any of the most difficult videos and I bet there are plenty of other people who could as well.  Why not have a few of us in these videos to show the over 50 crowd what is possible.  You would sell more videos.  I've leaving my name and email because I have a lot more opinions.  I've gone from Jane Fonda to Denise Austin to Jillian and to many, many more.  I know what keeps me in shape safely.  Carol Reeves  creeves@butler.edu",1387152000,3,1568,4.27891156462585

She cuts down the prep work for the exercises and gets right to it, which allows the workouts to be about 18 minutes long without the cool down. I recommend following along with the tutorial she gives. It helps a lot. She does work very fast but you must realize you don't have to go as fast as she is! Take it slow until you feel comfortable with the movements. So far I've done two back-to-back, normally pairing either the upper body or lower body with the ab workout. It's awesome!

I have done kickboxing before and these 3x 20 mins. workouts are very light and the movements are not even for both sides of the body.  It's a shame to expend on this ""Kickboxing"" DVD.

4990998,5,B006IRQU5S,"I like the fact that this is online streaming. I purchased a DVD of another instructor's. The DVD got stuck in my computer after 4 uses...I don't think I'll buy DVD again. I'll just do online streaming from Amazon. It's a lot easier without having to worry about the DVD disk getting scratched or stuck.

I haven't worked out for a while. To me, this workout routine is hard to keep up with, especially after the first 20 mins. But I still enjoy it. I just stop whenever I can't take it any more.....I like to sweat a lot during the workout. This one definitely serves the purpose well.

Also it's probably not for kickboxing newbies. I have had experience with kickboxing but it's still hard for me to follow.  The routines get more and more complicated in a very fast pace. So if you've never done kickboxing before, don't buy this. But if you are very confident about your energy and athleticism, buy it after all. Jillian won't disappoint.

4991003,3,B006IRQU5S,"So this DVD has workouts.  The one focusing on upper body is great and wasn't too difficult to keep up with. The second workout, focusing on the lower body, is a good workout but will take a couple of tries to get down.  The third workout for abs did not impress me.  So I think I'll still use the first two, but not the ab workout.  Given Jillian's expertise and the fact that it's been proven time & time again that floor ab workouts are not nearly as effective as standing ab workouts, I'm kindof surprised that the ab workout was almost completely floor work.

I think it's really great that these are quick, 20 minute, basically HIIT workouts, and you definitely sweat your ass off during that time.

However, if you're looking for a true kickboxing workout to do at home, I'd recommend keep either a)keep looking or b) get something that is more true kickboxing & use this to supplement.",1381363200,,893,4.481481481481482

I thought that there was a major lack of direction/instruction as to what was going on, and the moves aren't choreopgraphed that well, so when they really quickly transition to another move, it's awkward and hard to keep up. It's a decent workout, but for kickboxing or martial arts, I would recommend Les Mill's Combat videos.",1379894400,,585,4.86

I did this workout in the afternoon after doing a leg workout in the morning for extra calorie burn and cardio. The 20 minutes goes by so quick, that I did it twice! At this point, I am actually not in the greatest shape of my life, and I was breathing pretty hard by the end of the DVD. As Jillian says, it's all what you give it.
A lot of people may say that Level 1 is easy, but honestly, grab some weights or do the workout at a faster pace and you will feel it. Again, I do it a lot after a leg workout for the cardio burn.

There are 3 sets of workout, 20 mins each but while it is short, it is fast-paced.  When I first started, I thought it was going to be an easy 20-min workout but no, I was wrong.  Regardless, after a 30-min strength session, I get my second wind with this kickbox fastfix.  It is just as effective, especially when you are short on time.  However, I don't believe in 20-min workout a day.  1 hour or bust!  Also, I don't think this workout is suitable for people who are new to kickboxing.  Some of the moves can be confusing.

I like that each cycle is 20 minutes, so you can mix and match for a longer workout if you like, or do just the one if you're in a pinch. It's non-stop cardio but repetitive with leg and arm thrusts for toning as well.

I would have rated 5 stars but there's a steep learning curve that goes on with this video. It's faster paced than her others and I find myself slowing down and going back over specific moves 5 or even 6 times in a row because the choreography can get complicated.

I usually do two of the workouts at a time and am sweating so much by the end.  I personally love the fast pace of this workout.  The exercises quickly change from one to the other so the momentum never goes down.  I didn't take the time to watch the tutorial because I have limited time to work out before work, but after watching them perform each move one time you're able to catch on.  Some of the moves are hard if you've never really done kickboxing before, especially once you get into 6 part movements, so I found it really helpful to say what I needed to do out loud.  Starting out you might not be able to do everything as quickly as Jillian & the other girls can do, but just keep at it & eventually you'll be able to do them more quickly and with better form.  Just keep moving throughout this workout and even if you throw a cross instead of a jab by mistake you will still get an awesome workout.

I usually do all three if I'm feeling like a long workout that burns the fat, but you can choose to do any of the 3. Each are about 20 minutes. I suggest doing the breathing and vocalizing that goes with it because it really does make you feel like you are part of a self-defense team that can kick anyone's, well, you know.

4991036,1,B006IRQU5S,"I love kickboxing workouts, but unfortunately this is one of my least favorite workout videos ever, and I have a lot (P90X, Insanity, etc.).  I have done Jillian's ""Killer Buns and Thighs"" as well as her ""No More Trouble Zones"", and they are both much better.  My complaints with this video are:

1.  Each exercise is very short.  She says 30 seconds, but it usually seems like only 15 or so.  By the time you get the hang of the move you are done.  Then there is a break while she tells you the next move, so you are just standing there.
2.  There are two circuits, but she works the same side on each circuit.  You have to remind yourself to switch sides without her prompting you if you want a balanced workout.
3.  Weird choreography.  I felt that with some of the exercises it was difficult to understand the moves.  I am not a fan of dancing videos because of their difficult choreography, and in a video like this where a move is done for such a short amount of time, there is no point in having complicated moves.  Simple exercises can be just as efficient.
4.  Incorrect names for moves.  At one point she does a squat/duck but calls it a block, which is confusing.  When she does upper cuts, she punches way too high, so her elbow is by her face and her hand is above her head.  I'm not a martial artist but I've been to zillions of kickboxing classes and I've never seen anything like that.

I also purchased this video on Amazon Instant Video, which had some drawbacks.  First, the video quality was really bad; it looked like TV from the 1970s.  Second, from reading others' reviews it looks like there is a tutorial on form, but that wasn't part of the instant video.  For someone who is new to kickboxing that would make this already frustrating video even more frustrating.

In the end, you do get a cardio workout, but at the price of being very frustrated and annoyed.  I think that Jillian is a great fitness instructor but this is not her best DVD.  I would skip this and get something else.",1373587200,23,2011,4.3584905660377355

I actually look forward to working out because I know I'll be done in 20 minutes but still feel like I really worked out!  I am sweating, panting, and sore and I love it.  I added 3 lb. hand weights to each workout (unless she calls for 8 lb. weights, as in the arm workout) and it has definitely taken my workouts up a notch.  For reference, I have done 6 Week 6 Pack, 30 Day Shred, Body Revolution, and Ripped in 30.  I look forward to using this DVD as a way to keep from being bored as I work my way back through my DVD's.  I think it would be especially good as a Cardio during Revolution, as the ones provided in the set became a bit monotonous.  That's just my opinion, though.  I would also recommend being very careful about how you do your spinning kicks - my right knee is a bit sore simply because I wasn't rotating my foot correctly.

4991045,2,B006IRQU5S,purchase this to get a work out but it's in the room with the other exercise stuff with dust so I can't give you an honest review but I do have it and will use it probably when another 10 lbs decide to stick with me,1371081600,,215,3.6956521739130435
4991046,3,B006IRQU5S,This one is OK. Which is saying something because I think I have given all her other videos 5 stars. I am used to Les Mills Body Combat and this just doesn't compare.,1370563200,,166,4.0606060606060606

4991048,5,B006IRQU5S,this is my favorite of all of her DVDs and i have almost all of them! It's so upbeat and fun...but you really get a fantastic workout at the same time. I hope she makes more kickboxing dvds! :),1370476800,,193,3.9743589743589745
4991049,5,B006IRQU5S,This is a great and fun workout for a mom who has to stay home to care for her kids and a great price verses paying to go to the gym or even buying the DVD at the store,1370476800,,168,3.3333333333333335
4991050,5,B006IRQU5S,I wanted something that had kickboxing and this is perfect it had me sweating by the time the first section was over it transitions pretty fast and was not hard to follow the combinations at all,1369872000,,194,4.416666666666667
4991051,5,B006IRQU5S,I love Jillian but honestly speaking I can never keep up with her workouts! They are usually difficult for me. I finally found one that I can keep up with and ENJOY! It is priced reasonably and worth every penny! THANKS AGAIN JILLIAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1369612800,,257,5.0
4991052,4,B006IRQU5S,"This workout is good.  I have a really hard time keeping up with all the moves, though.  I like that it keeps you going for the entire 20 minutes.  I have a friend who lost 20lbs. in 4 months just doing this series, but I have not been that successful.  Lost like 2lbs in 6 weeks",1368835200,,279,3.9285714285714284

The twenty minutes goes by super fast, but I don't feel like I've accomplished as much as some of her other workouts, does that make sense? Wicked sore after each workout though. There are a few familiar faces in the workouts, which is nice. Overall, there are three fun workouts. I'd recommend if you're a fan.",1368144000,,393,4.397260273972603

I found the moves on the ab portion a little difficult, but loved the other 2 workouts.  It's perfect for a busy mom who doesn't have a lot of time to work out.  I really enjoy kickboxing as it's a great cardio work out but not extremely difficult to follow.",1368057600,,384,4.148648648648648

I have Jillian's other Cardio Kickboxing DVD which I love love love, but her 30 day shred just about kills me so I wasn't sure what to expect. I'm trying to keep things interesting in my home gym lately so I plugged this into the DVD player this morning and WOW! I was so happy I did! I did both work out 1 (upper body) and work out 2 (lower body). I liked the incorporation of weights in work out 1 and lower body I had to take kind of easy in parts (lots of knee twisting kicks which I had to modify a bit for my body personally). But they made me sweat and I think you can do these moves as a beginner even if you modify some of the intensity to your level.

I couldn't keep up with some of the more complicated combinations b/c I'm not that coordinated, but I made up my own and kept moving. I feel great and can't wait to do it again!",1367884800,,905,3.891891891891892

I used to do Martial Arts and MAN, while this clearly is focues on Martial Arts type excersises, given that it's only 20 mins, Jillian kicks you into very fast movements and no breaks in between. If you're starting out, do like I do, and at least take one or 2 30 second breaks, just pause DVD or pause to do so.

Otherwise, it's become my primary workout- followed by my UFC Personal Trainer and Exerbeat on Wii as suplemental lighter workouts. So far, lost 2 lbs in 1 wk. Not bad.",1367193600,,656,4.333333333333333

4991064,5,B006IRQU5S,"I was absolutely astounded at how much I was sweating and how much fun I was having.  I love and hate Jillian Michaels.  She's a horrible trainer with a bad attitude and I think I own 3 or 4 of her DVDs, because she gets results.  I hate working out and she somehow inspires me to get to work.  I'm almost 42 years old and I come from a long line of obese ladies and I'd prefer not to follow in their footsteps.  Jillian Michaels is helping me keep it light and tight in my forties and enabling me to keep up with three very active herding dogs.

4991065,2,B006IRQU5S,"I have been working out with Jillian for about 5 years or so. I usually love her workouts, but this one didn't have the same quality. I felt like she threw together a workout, slapped a title on it then decided to sell it. Very disorganized. Sometimes she would do some moves with one side then not with the other. I like symmetry in my workouts so I was frustrated with the routine. It also seemed like she was trying to add about a million moves to each combo...for me it would have been so much better if she had stuck to a few moves, but really focused in on them. Very disappointed...wish I could take it back!",1367107200,,615,4.220338983050848
4991066,1,B006IRQU5S,"This video is ok, just don't expect to get quick results because the workouts are so easy. I have owned 5 Jillian Michaels videos and this will be the very last I will ever buy. I don't know what her deal is, but I have not seen one man used in any of her videos and being a man, it's quite discouraging. I am sticking with Insanity where I know it's not a workout just for chicks",1367020800,,380,3.948051948051948
4991067,4,B006IRQU5S,"I have several of Jillian Michaels' workout videos and I love them; I feel that I get a great workout without having to pay hundreds of dollars for a personal trainer. This video is equally as good but I do have one complaint, which is that she has you doing the moves on the same side all the time. She does this in her Ripped in 30 Video as well and tells us to ""get over it"" but I can't get over it! I mean she wouldn't have us do bicep curls on one arm only so why does she think it's ok to do kickboxing on one side only? (this is the main reason it doesn't get 5 stars) Other than that, you'll great workout, and the other girls in the video help me stay motivated. Plus it's nice to see familiar faces from Jillian's previous videos. I did struggle with workout 3 as she had some moves that were too advanced for me, and I have taken kickboxing at the gym and done other videos pretty regularly. All in all, I would recommend this video to anyone who's looking for a quick cardio workout.",1366934400,,995,4.081632653061225
4991068,5,B006IRQU5S,"Love it! This is a great workout for 20 minutes. I found that I love doing circuits, it makes the time go by really fast. And I like that there are 3 different workouts you can do.  I just wish the workouts were a little longer, maybe 30mins. 20 isn't quite long enough but I can't do much of another workout since I've worked so hard the 1st 20 minutes.",1366848000,,354,4.057142857142857

4991071,2,B006IRQU5S,I am a HUGE JM fan and own almost all of her DVDs.  This was not what I expected and a bit disappointing.  If you don't already know how to kickbox and don't work on the tutorial over & over ... you will never get it.  I'm not uncoordinated and in good shape ... but this was virtually impossible for me.,1366588800,,304,3.9508196721311477
4991072,5,B006IRQU5S,I really like Jillian's style and found it translated to the workout videos.  They are a challenge for me and I am sore but I do enjoy the punching and the kicking.,1366156800,,164,4.125
4991073,3,B006IRQU5S,I've been into kickboxing lately but I started with Tae Bo workouts.  Going from the high intensity Billy Blanks to Jillian was a little disappointing.  This is a good for a simple 20 minute workout but it has a lot less kicks and punches than I thought it would.  This will be OK if I mix it up with other workouts but I think I will get bored with it fast.,1366070400,,358,4.014084507042254
4991074,5,B006IRQU5S,I love this workout for a quick 20 min cardio burn! I usually do the legs and abs one in one session to get a max burn. I love the flow of the moves and how fun it is!,1365552000,,167,3.3076923076923075
4991075,5,B006IRQU5S,I am a J. Michaels fan.  I have many of her DVD's.  I work out almost everyday.  I read the reviews on this DVD and the one main complaint was she only works one side.  Knowing this in advance I adapted so that I could work the other side.  In every one of her DVD's she always shows you how to adapt a workout for your level.  You can do the same in this DVD.  Each circuit is done twice.  On the second go around just switch to the other side.  I do get confused sometimes but it is worth it.  The DVD is fast paced and you get a total workout in 20 minutes.  Who doesn't love that.  The three different routines offer variety so you don't have to do the same thing everyday.,1365465600,,677,3.933333333333333

4991078,1,B006IRQU5S,"This is rather frustrating as the actual workouts move rather quickly and if you don't know the steps beforehand, you're constantly playing catch up.

I followed the recommendations and did the tutorial first - so helpful!  I was still a little lost the first few times but now I feel great doing this!  I also do workout 1 followed by workout 2 in one session.  It's an excellent cardio workout with the upper body weights in workout 1.  I don't get much out of workout 3 so I've only done it two or three times.  The first two are excellent.  I highly recommend it!",1365120000,,579,4.238532110091743
4991080,5,B006IRQU5S,"I have done a few of Jillian's workouts (Ripped in 30, 30 Day Shred) and anyone that has done these workouts knows they are intense.  I felt that this one was also along the same lines-intense!  I love kickboxing and used to go to a class.  I was looking for a workout that would allow me to either spend 20 minutes, or a full hour.  I like the flexibility that this workout provides.  People complain about how only one side is worked, and that the workout does not incorporate both sides (left and right).  I noticed this also, but what I did was since there are 4 rounds done twice, I did left side on round one, and then right side on round two.  This worked well for me, giving me a more full body workout.  Overall, the video is fun, fast-paced, leaves you dripping and is great for when you are short on time!  As a nursing student, I greatly appreciate this aspect!  As a side note, I am glad I did Jillian's 30 day shred because it helps with getting used to the fast-pace, and gives the ability to keep up without resting!",1365120000,,1032,4.246153846153846

However, after I increased my intensity in kicking and punching, boy did I feel it.  I felt just as winded as I do with BFBM. There is some footwork that you have to get used to but other than that, it is easy to follow. I will take this DVD and BFBM when I have to travel as there are no weights required for these.  I love to get in some good cardio and this one delivers! You do get some aggression out.  Actually, one of the girls in the video with dark hair in a ponytail, like some said, I would not want to meet in a dark alley... she is way too much into the kickboxing thing...lol",1364774400,,720,3.8120805369127515

I came across this one when I was looking for something new since a lot of the Jillian DVD's while different have the same sort of moves (squats, lunges, jumping jacks, jumprope, ect).  This one caught my eye because of the kickboxing element.  I have to say that while the workouts are not that intense they do give you a good burn and tone while being a lot of fun and faced paced.  The 20 minutes seem to fly by.  I do this work out as an added supplement to my regular workout or when I'm in a hurry and want to burn a few calories before heading off to my busy day.  The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because some of the combinations moves can be a little complicated and can take a few times watching the DVD to really get the hang of.

That's also convenient if I dislike a segment, because by the time I'm annoyed with the activity we've moved on to another! So, this was enjoyable for me, but I did find myself confused by some of the footwork. I've read in other reviews that there is a tutorial section, but since I got the instant download, the menu and extras are not available. I would recommend this video, especially if you generally like Jillian and/or kickboxing.

This video is broken into 3 different workouts: work out one- focuses on arms, work out two- focuses on legs, work out three- focuses on abs.
Each day, my muscles are sore, but they aren't so sore that I can't do it again tomorrow. I feel I am benefiting greatly from this work out, and you will too! I especially like that each section is only 20 minutes. So you can either add it to another cardio workout, or do all three, or pick and choose! It's great!

How to tell your DVDs are pirated- Some pirated DVDs have the disc art, even include inserts and are wrapped as if they have never been opened... A great give away that it is a pirated DVD is that it doesn't have an insert. Your DVD has a code on the disc, you can call customer service and insure that the code on the DVD is legit.

Each legs kicks differently for karate so while each leg isn't done exactly the same, I do feel there is a balance between both sides if you pay attention and realize the proper stance for karate. You don't switch sides to do do a right side kick... you turn your body. I haven't done karate in 20 or so years since I was a kid so I am no expert, but after doing it a few times and learning the moves I feel the balance is appropriate

If you want to jump around, kick, punch, and get sweaty this is for you. If you do the form right and give it more than one or two times you will learn the steps and time really does fly by and its actually really fun.",1363564800,,734,4.027397260273973

There are three 20 minute workouts that each focus on a different area of the body: 1st - arms, 2nd - lower body, 3rd - abs.  Personally I think they are fun workouts that are very fast paced and challenging at the same time, and good for getting in a quick workout when you don't have a lot of time, or you could combine them for more of a workout when you're ready.

Maybe the other ones will be harder. It was VERY fun though, I like the pace, she goes right into each move. I DID sweat a lot! Feels good! Just wish it was longer than 20 minutes.

I've done the 1st and 2nd workouts and they are so much fun!  I've been doing them back-to-back because when I'm finished with the 1st one I'm so fired up I just want to keep going.  You really feel like you are in a kickboxing class and when you're done, you fell like you could kick some butt!

I recommend doing the tutorial first, in which she breaks down the different kicks and punches.  The workouts are really fast paced and she doesn't break down the moves.  I jumped right into the first workout and was a little lost and had a hard time following along and keeping up.  DO THE TUTORIAL unless you have previous kickboxing experience.

4991130,3,B006IRQU5S,"You may not be able to do these videos the first or second time around. Many of the combos are awkward and arrhythmic, she has three different words for the same move within one combo, and the transitions from standing to the floor are pretty brief, so I missed a few reps. Also, she doesn't build up to the combos, as I've experienced in kickboxing classes. You're thrown straight into some pretty long and complicated stuff - I even saw some of the other participants struggling to keep up. Though you do go through each circuit twice, Jillian and the others perform both on one side. You can switch it up yourself, but then it gets even more confusing.

That said, I did get a decent workout before I got too frustrated with her instructions to continue. This might have worked better as one long video to allow more time for useful instructions.",1361836800,3,849,4.549019607843137

But when I have extra time I do 2 back to back.  The first works your upper body the second works lower body.  I think the 3rd is about abs, but I haven't done it yet.  You will need to do it couple times before you get the punch sequences down.  Instead of easy to remember 4 combo sequence, in some she has 6-8 combos and it gets confusing to keep up with.  For example, she will have a jab-jab-cross-hook-uppercut-front kick-back kick-  That's just TOO MUCH to remember and I find myself making up my own combo's.

I ended up changing it up slightly just to be able to keep up with the speed.  I'd rather do that than stand there confused trying to figure it out.

I like to do the same exercise and reps on both sides of my body - especially with arms and legs.  This video confused me.  She tells you that you are going to do repeat a sequence 2 times in the 20 minutes workout.  The first 20 minute workout was correct, but the next two are all over the place.  She does one side of the body, but not the other and then she does it again in the next 20 minutes.  Not sure if she repeats the other side in the other 20 minutes or not.  Just got confused.  I have been doing kickboxking for years, so it's not because I am not familiar with kickboxing.  She either forgets her sequence or she is doing something that I haven't caught on to.

The only gripe I have with this video, is that Jillian doesn't do many of the exercises on both sides. She repeats the same sides, which is really frustrating.

It was a little too much for me. Jillian offers a tutorial, which helped, but while the individual moves are broken down, the combinations are not. I didn't get a chance to practice them slowly before trying them in the workout. This made for a less effective workout as some of the moves are complicated when you put them together at the high rate of speed presented by the DVD. I gave each of the three workouts a second chance, but I think I need a more remedial kick boxing workout first.

4991225,5,B006IRQU5S,"I read many of the reviews on here before buying this DVD. I was skeptical even though I had many of Jillian's other DVDs and had loved, loved, loved them. That being said, I really enjoy the 3 workouts on this DVD. Yes, it is very fast-paced and I would not recommend it for beginners or for anyone who has never done a Jillian DVD. Try her 30 Day Shred or even Ripped in 30 before trying this DVD. I did watch the tutorial before working out with the DVD and also watched the first workout before I attempted it. I always think this is a good idea (I know, who has the time to do this, and I don't do it for every workout DVD I have). I consider myself an intermediate exerciser; I work out 5 to 6 days a week either with Jillian DVDs, 10 Minute Solution DVDs or ExerciseTV workouts from iTunes. These 3 kickboxing workouts are great for only being 20 minutes! Just last night I did the lower body one because I was pressed for time and it still amazes me how much I sweat in just 20 minutes. I believe the lower body workout (workout 2) is the most challenging one. Yes, I have noticed that other reviewers have said she does only work one side and my suggestion would be that once you are comfortable with the workout and have done it enough to remember most of the moves, switch sides on the second time through each circuit. I did notice that someone pointed out in another review that it is hard to mirror the girls and Jillian if you are not left-handed. I immediately noticed this as well because I am left-handed, but I kind of appreciated it! Since they are doing the moves right-handed in order to follow them exactly you would have to do the moves left-handed. Anyway, I really like these workouts and don't give up on them just because they can be frustrating the first couple of times you do them. To make these workouts a little bit harder, I would suggest doing them with weighted kickboxing gloves. I used them for the first time last night with workout 2 from this DVD and I could definitely tell I was working harder - just a way to amp up the intensity!

Well, I hate to say this, but Jillian missed a very basic principle in this DVD, which is: MAKE IT WORK FOR THE USER/VIEWER! Here's what I mean. In most exercise DVDs, you mirror what the instructor on-screen is doing. Here, YOU CAN'T IF YOU'RE RIGHT-HANDED! If you're following the instructions she gives in the tutorial (which was a good call on her part, but...), based on what hand you use, that is the foot that is back for all moves. Well, she must have an entire class of right-handed people! That's not a crime, but since we're viewing the DVD from the front, everything is in reverse! She should have thought of this when filming it -- I mean, HELLO?!? How are your users seeing it? Get a few left-handers so we can watch THEM! It was impossible to follow -- I'm not (and I'll bet others aren't either) coordinated enough to transpose what I'm looking at when learning something this complicated. And I agree with some of the other negative reviewers, aside from the mirroring problem, it does seem unbalanced to always work from the same side.

4991236,3,B006IRQU5S,"I like a video that doesn't have people cheering and ""wooing"" while working out like they are having a blast - and unfortunately this video is filled with annoying girls who do just that. the upper body work out is ok - but I definitely don't work up the same sweat I do in 30-day shred. It's a good change up from the regular 30 day shred, but not as good of a work out

Try it- if you can get past the WOOOOO and YAY!! that the back ups do.",1356566400,,442,3.857142857142857
4991237,4,B006IRQU5S,"This workout entails 3 separate 20 minute workouts. The first targets the arms (you'll need a set of weights), the second targets the legs, the last targets the abdominal region. Each workout is comprised of 4 circuits and each circuit is repeated twice. The workouts are approximately 20 minutes each.

A common theme throughout the three workouts is active recovery. This means that Jillian will bring the exerciser down from higher intensity movements with lower intensity, yet effective moves like chest flies/headbangers on the floor.

The workout overall is pretty good. There are, however, two possible caveats that I would warn you of. The first is that this video, although it comes with a tutorial (not too detailed) will probably be overly challenging for those who have coordination issues. While it is not a dance video, you need to have an above average level of control over your body. Balance is also a key component of this workout as is agility.

Another caveat could be carpet. There are several movements that have a sliding and/or pivoting component to them that could be challenging if you are working out on thicker carpeting. This could also cause an issue for those who have knee issues, as the drag of the carpet with the pivoting movement may be more than your joints can handle.

On that note, there are also some jumping components that those with knee issues may want to modify or pass on altogether (ie. jump squats).

I have experience with all types of exercises, including kickboxing and I enjoyed the workout. However, from an objective standpoint, if you are inexperienced and watching the tutorial in hopes that it will keep you up to speed, you may be disappointed. The workout is fast-paced and the moves in the tutorial do not really offer a true sense of what will happen in the actual workout. It may take a few times doing it to really get it down.

Lastly, I want to address the issue that many have raised about the exercises being lopsided. I have found that for some of exercises, although the starting position is the same direction, the sliding and pivoting moves address the lopsidedness. For other exercises, one can easily turn to the other side on the next go-around to get a more even workout (at least that's what I do). While this option is not implicit in the workout, it is the logical thing to do.

Overall, this is a more technical or athletic kickboxing workout. This is not similar to Tae-Bo where you have more creative components that have you making use of all of your space. I usually do the sections back to back because honestly, the first 20 minutes does not get me to the cardiovascular peak that I seek. However, halfway through the second workout, I start to feel it.",1356480000,,2739,4.729559748427673

If you are intermediate or advanced, it can be a fun quick work out if you don't have time to do a longer one and still want to kick.",1356480000,,402,3.8313253012048194

So when I'm crunched for time or just have a day where I am not feeling like exercising, I can commit to these short 20 minutes. They're intense (level 2 - lower body is the most challenging) and get the job done. I don't think you'd like this for an every day workout and should aim for more than 20 min most days but when you just aren't feeling it, this is a great sub.

But, the frenetic pace of the workout is daunting if you don't know the moves already.  Most of the time, I could not figure out the combinations of the footwork fast enough to do the exercise with the group. I think it would be really easy to hurt myself trying to do some of these moves without instruction. There is a tutorial at the end of the video that walks you through all the moves step by step, but I at least went into this expecting the training Michaels provides in her other videos. Also, there really isn't a warm-up. In the future, I think I will run through some warm-up exercises from 30-Day Shred or the like before starting one of these workouts. I will be trying this workout again, but I am disappointed in it right now.",1354665600,,912,4.333333333333333

It takes a few times to get used to the kickboxing moves, but there is a separate tutorial you can watch that goes over the moves.  I had to watch the tutorial a couple times before the actual workout and also had to rewind/slow the moves the first couple times I did them.  But, you do get used to the combos and the moves get easier as you get used to them.  Don't expect to watch once and understand the moves.  This is definitely not a beginner's DVD, but it's doable for intermediate.  There are 3 20-min workouts and each focuses on a different area- lower body, upper body, and abs.  It's a fantastic cardio workout and is really fun to do, especially when you do it a couple times so the moves aren't so hard to remember what to do.",1354147200,2,804,4.175324675324675

I was too nervous to actually try a kickboxing class since I have never tried it at all before, so thought I would try out this DVD. I was very pleasantly surprised, and felt compelled to leave a review. I was an athlete in high school and college, and have since gained weight and gotten out of shape. I'm on a journey to lose 50 lbs and I'm already down 15 in about a month (thanks to Weight Watchers and working out). This DVD has been a big part of my workout routine, and helps mix it up and keep it interesting. I would even describe this workout as FUN! Make sure you do the tutorial first or you might be a little lost. The first time I tried it I felt like I was a little slow, but by the second try I was amazed at how much my form had improved and how much I had learned. The 20 mins flies by, and I usually will even do 2 of the workouts at a time. Anyway, try this DVD out, even if you've never tried kickboxing before.

I love this DVD because you can choose to do just one 20-minute routine or you can push yourself and do 2 routines or even all three for an hour long sweat-fest! The first time I did this routine I found it to be a little on the easier side (I am not new to working out- I workout 5-6 days/week and am an avid long-distance runner). However, I have grown to really enjoy this workout when I push myself to my limits. If you really give it your all, then you will be drenched in just 20 minutes. However, if you half-ass it like I did the first time and just kind of throw your arm out there for the punches (those of you who kick-box know what I'm talking about), then you probably won't get results from this DVD. Put some power into these moves and you'll do great!",1353974400,,803,4.153846153846154

She flings her limbs out there and does nearly every move with atrocious form.  If I had never done kickboxing, she is not someone I would want to have to follow as an example.

She does each circuit twice, so I just adjusted the workout by changing my stance to the other side the second time around so everything would be even. It's a little annoying that way, but the workout is great otherwise. It helps me burn calories, and I feel myself getting stronger every time I do it! I also like that the other girls in the video are clearly fit, and even they are struggling a little bit by the end of each segment. Makes me feel a little better about my fitness level, haha! Give this one a try and I think you'll like it.",1353283200,,719,4.179856115107913
4991260,4,B006IRQU5S,"This Jillian DVD is a good one so far. She has 3 different workouts, all full of killer cardio, getting your heart rate up and making you sweat. 1 focuses on upper body, 2 on lower body, and 3 on abs. I find workout 2 to be the most butt-busting routine! After about 2 weeks of alternating the workouts 5 days a week I already feel stronger and am excited to see the results after a month!
I will say this would be a difficult DVD for beginners as there are a few complicated kickboxing combos. There is a tutorial though to go through the combos slower before you run through the workout.
The only negative to this video for me is that Jillian doesn't alternate sides on many of the kickboxing combos. This is probably due to the fact that most of the martial arts are taught using your dominate hand/leg. However, she does moves to work out both sides. I am a fan of alternating however as the unevenness bothers me! She runs through each ""circuit"" twice, so I always simply alternate the combo on the other side the second time through for my own sanity. :)
Overall its a great workout video from Jillian! Makes you sweat buckets in 20 minutes! She reminds you too, that you get out of the video what you put into it. It would be easy to half time the video or minimize the moves, but if you try and keep up with the girls in the video you will get a killer workout!",1352937600,3,1369,4.229007633587786
4991261,3,B006IRQU5S,"First off, I love Jillian Michaels and have 4 of her dvd's. Hers are the only ones I don't get sick of. I have started workout routines and last a few months and then quit completely. I have consistently been workout out with various Jillian workouts for over 6 months now and I see the results. That being said, of the 4 dvd's I have, this one is my least favorite but I still like it. It is quick (about 20 minutes) which I love for days when I am short on time however, the 1st workout didn't leave me feeling like I got a good workout in. And I know I am not in nearly as good of shape as some of you reading this are so if I didn't sweat much, alot of other folks won't either. Workouts 2 and 3 are much more challenging but I am not very coordinated so by the time I caught up with the moves, we were already on to the next circuit but practice makes perfect so I am getting better. I like that these are 20 minutes each but if you are a beginner and haven't tried 30 day shred, try that instead. That was my first dvd and I loved it.",1352764800,,1040,3.910377358490566

However, I must also confess that this DVD was a revelation, a total blast and a great workout! You can do each workout individually or combine all 3 for a hardcore hour + of aerobic exercise. Some of the combinations are a bit complicated but that makes it challenging and appeals to the competitor inside. I want to master every combo!!!

Jillian is surprisingly engaging, motivating and sometimes right down funny. My only problem and the reason why I am not giving it 5 stars is that the moves are not taught mirror style. I find myself constantly getting out of sync because I naturally try to lead with the same leg they do on the screen. Can she not find some helpers to do the moves with their ""weak"" side, so I can follow along?

4991268,4,B006IRQU5S,"As a background, I've done INSANITY, a few other Jillian videos, and I used to play soccer. I still do an INSANITY video now and then but it was really rough on my knees, so I stay away from it unless I really feel like I need a brutal workout. My point is that I really enjoy this video compared to the others I mentioned. It doesn't hurt my joints, for only being 20 minute workouts, you get a lot done, and you feel great even after just one 20 minute segment. I was sore the next day, but not so much as to not want to do it again. Because it is so short, it goes by so quickly. I normally find Jillian a little obnoxious, but in this video she is fun and I really like her background girls.

I do have a few issues with it though. A lot of her combinations feel awkward and are hard to remember or they are too long and not natural feeling. Sometimes they're great, but more often than not, she is doing a weird combo. Maybe it just isn't what I'm used to in the kickboxing classes I've taken, but either way I feel awkward doing them her way, so I just change them a little to fit the way that feels like a natural movement/rythm. For example, she switches from a back kick to a round-house kick in the same direction... very awkward. But if you do a similar movement like a simple front kick and back kick in the opposite direction, it's comfortable and just as effective.

I wouldn't get this if you are unfamiliar with cardio kickboxing workouts, but all-in-all, it's a fun and effective workout video.",1351382400,,1511,4.206896551724138

For those who say she doesn't work both sides evenly - in real kickboxing, you don't switch sides to balance it all out.  You usually have one stance depending on whether you are left or right-handed, or with your lead leg being your 'weakest' side.  Don't worry, you will work both legs and both arms doing these workouts.  For kicks and punches on the back leg, she has you pivot and use your hip.  I actually find it awkward doing workouts where you have to switch stances - it makes me feel uncoordinated.

Within a few weeks, not only are my arms BETTER than they were pre-pregnancy, but my thighs have lost a few inches and I can actually see definition in my thighs which has NEVER been there before (I guess I was kinda untoned-skinny). I do the workout about 4-5 times per week on average. I'm confident if I keep doing this my body will be better than ever.

The best part is it is fun to do, and its ONLY 20 minutes. With a breastfeeding baby that I barely ever can set down for more than 30 minutes at a time, plus going to school fulltime and working, my 30-45 minute workouts were impossible to fit in (Without stopping every 20 minutes to console the baby). This gets your cardio up and your fat burning FAST! Be careful, though, it can be hard on your knees. Try this workout it really is amazing!

Update: I am in great post baby shape. I have a four-pack lol and awesome tone in my legs. Thanks entirely to this dvd. I also bought low profile cross-fit shoes and no longer have trouble with my knees (I was previously working out barefoot, duh).

4991280,3,B006IRQU5S,"I purchased this since I moved to a new state and am craving serious cardio.
Martial Arts is definitely one of my favorite ways to get cardio and I love Jillian, so I thought this would be a perfect mix.
Unfortunately, while these work outs are super fun, I don't see this as being heavy cardio.
I even added hand weights to up the difficulty and found it pretty easy.
The work outs are definitely fun though so I'll keep doing them, adding more weight and ankle weights.
I am experienced in martial arts and have pretty good cardio (the first time I did these work outs, I did two back to back and barely felt winded) so I think this might be good for an intermediate level person.
The moves are quick and can be dangerous if not executed properly.
I suggest watching the workouts a few times through and practicing the moves because I admit that I was lost a few times.

Will anything ever come close to an in person core fusion cardio class? Probably not!",1347926400,,958,4.351955307262569

4991287,3,B006IRQU5S,"I am surprised how great the reviews are for this dvd.  I have all of Jillian's DVDs and I have always loved them. This one, not so much.  The workouts are too short.  20 min just isn't enough.  It isn't at all like 30 Day Shred where you can work out for 20-30 min and feel like you worked out.  On this DVD I find I have to do all three workouts together.  If you do that, than yes, it is a good DVD.  But there isn't an option to play all three in a row.  You have press one, do the whole thing, wait for the DVD to reset and then press the next one.  It is annoying.  I liked how in Shed and Shred you can play both workouts without having to go back to the main menu.  In all I will use it as one workout but it isn't what I expected.  This is the first Jillian product I have ever been disappointed in.  Maybe if you are more beginner than this would be a good DVD to start with.

The instructions are clear, she gives you time to do the workout twice, and her voice is not annoying like some other trainers I've tried. Best of all, she is motivating. I do the workouts on this DVD six days a week and I have not gotten bored. I saw results in the first two weeks. Another good thing about the workouts is, it's only 20 minutes per workout which is reasonable, becuz I'm a busy mom of two. I have been alternating it with some Taebo and it's great.

  On this DVD you will find three mini workouts, which are all good workouts, but they are similiar to one another. It would have been nice to have them be more different. Some of the combos in the workouts seemed a little complicated and fast paced for a beginner. I found myself getting lost at times, but with practice I'm sure things will be smoother. The tutorial is some help; but I would have preferred something geared more toward true beginners that's a little slower in pace.

I love that i can also double up on some days. Right now I've only done the lower and upper body workouts and not the core workout, but I have seen amazing results.

Now that I have, I have to say that each of the workouts are pretty good, but the second is by far the best.  Your heart is pumping the entire time and you are ""panting like a dog"" as Jillian promises.  I think if you did all three workouts back to back, it would be an incredible workout, but being short on time most of the time, they really help me get a quick workout in before I have to start my day as a stay-at-home mom.  I've also used them, then added in a short weight training routine after.

4991297,2,B006IRQU5S,"I really enjoy most Jillian workouts, I find them to be engaging and fun.  After watching the tutorial and taking previous boxing classes at local gyms, I was very excited to try this dvd.  I knew it was fast paced/intense and after doing several intense Jillian workouts previously, I thought this would be a challenge but nothing too crazy.  She started off all 3 workouts with a quick cardio workout then jumped right into some kickboxing moves.  No big deal. Then she started shouting off combinations.  The first few were relatively easy to follow.  All of the rest required me to pause the dvd, count out the moves myself, master them, then try to follow the combinations with the group of girls. I ended up pausing each workout about 5 times to figure out the combinations.  Even if you watch the tutorial, you will still neeed to pause the dvd. At the end of each workout she does a very quick cool down that doesn't really give you a chance to stretch out your muscles properly.  If you're into kickboxing already, and are looking for a quick cardioblast, this dvd may suit your needs. If you're used to Jillian's previous videos this probably isn't a good one for you.",1344902400,3,1178,4.6028708133971294

4991304,4,B006IRQU5S,"I got this DVD last week and have now done all three workouts.  #1 (Upper Body) and #2 (Lower Body) are definitely a little easier to do, as the combinations aren't as complicated.  #3 is challenging, and I know I need to go back and just WATCH some portions to figure out the moves.  Every workout has made me drip sweat, even though I'm pretty in shape (run 15 miles/week, workout every day for ~30 minutes).  If you like kickboxing but don't have a lot of time for it, this is the DVD for you!  It was also fun to see a couple of the girls in the background from other videos (e.g. Anita and Natalie from 30 Day Shred).

PROS
1.  Fast and effective
2.  Definitely gets your heart and muscles working HARD
3.  With such fast change overs between activities (30 seconds per activity?), you don't get stuck doing something horrible for extremely long periods of time.  Quite refreshing!

CONS
1.  Some combinations are confusing and take a lot of study to figure out (maybe that's just me).
2.  It's FAST.  REALLY fast.  Like, so fast that I'm pretty sure my DVD player is playing it at 1.5 speed instead of normal (kidding! but it is fast).
3.  Psycho-Into-It Girl.  She's the one with the long dark ponytail and is just WAY too into it.  I don't see how she can do each workout with that much intensity all the time.  Would definitely NOT want to meet her in a dark alley.

Also, I'd caution parents about doing this DVD workout with young children around.  My toddler was constantly sitting down right where I needed to be for various activities, and my preschooler was constantly trying to join in while repeating everything Jillian was saying at a yell.  Nothing like trying to do push-ups with one child sitting on your back while the other is shouting ""FASTER MAMA, FASTER!""",1343952000,6,1781,4.482866043613707

Some of the combinations were complicated and so fast that it was hard to get a hang of them; I am sure this would get easier in time but was frustrating on the first time trying the workout.  My main complaint is that she only works one side of the body.  Jillian starts all her moves on the left leg throughout all three workouts.  She doesn't reverse the move to start with the right leg.  So if you want a balanced workout you need to remember to alternate legs yourself OR redo each workout using the other side of the body.  This is a pain when you have some complicated combos that take concentration and then you are trying to reverse them.

There's no real warm up but you start with cardio which is basically your warm up. The 3 workouts target different muscle groups: arms, legs and abs. So you're toning while burning major calories in a short amount of time. I was surprised how hard the workouts were; I expected them to be really easy to be honest.

But...this one truly rocks. I would not suggest this for beginners. I love that there are 3 workouts, 20mins each and how they increase upon levels. I combine Workout 1 and 2 for my kickboxing experience and skip Workout 3.

Workout 1 - Easy on the joints and a great way to break into the DVD itself. I really like how you can use hand weights as she suggest, 3lbs, but I use 5lbs during some of the reps. It is really a great introduction of what is to come for workouts 2 and 3.

Workout 2 - My favorite! It is more intense than Workout 1. You do a bit more combinations and although they can get confusing, you can still follow the rhythm and get your work out in! It is the perfect medium between Workout 1 and 3.

Workout 3 - Least favorite! It is extremely hard on the joints. Advanced or not, if you have had issues with your knees, skip this Workout. A lot of hopping and jumping.

Jillian delivers as usual. I still hate her ego, junk talking approach because it's not motivating but I can't hate on the fact that her DVDs work...period!",1341532800,2,1213,4.283842794759825

I was looking forward to learning some new skills and kick up my workout routine another notch. I was VERY disappointed by this DVD. The short tutorial is simply not enough to teach a beginner these complex kickboxing moves and the pace of the routine is simply ridiculous! it goes so fast that form is completely neglected and some of the girls in the background are not even doing them properly. There are also many names for the moves that you can easily get confused if you're not an expert. Also, there are too many ""workout buddies"" on this DVD for my taste, and I really didn't like the entire attitude/atmosphere, with the screaming, the showing off, etc...It was kind of the opposite of what I look forward in my at-home DVD workout, which is to de-stress, not to be in the company of a bunch of annoying loud workout nuts! In the end, for the first time since I have been doing Jillian's workouts I gave up and felt really inadequate. not so much because it was physically hard (which it was) but more because I found it a bit dangerous and irresponsible to be doing these moves without proper form and at that insane fast pace. That DVD may help some people burn off stress by ""going crazy"" but I don't think it is as efficient as well performed, slower moves. There is also no room for improvement over time, which is really a departure from her previous DVDs where you could work you way up. I would recommend this DVD to someone really advanced or who has already done some kickboxing before.",1341014400,13,1671,4.5
4991328,2,B006IRQU5S,"I recently bought this and her 30-day shred. I am in good physical shape, and I go to the gym 3-4 times a week. I was looking for a quick 20 minute kickboxing routine that could suffice on the days I just couldn't drive to the gym for 20 minutes...I figured if anyone would be intense in 20 minutes, it would be Jillian. The workouts do get you sweating, but I am seriously annoyed at the fact that she does basically every sequence on one side only. Really? Was this when you knew nothing? How can you do all the sequences on only one side of the body? My right arm is going to be ripped. My left, that's another story. Also, she cools you down so quick it's from 60 to 0 in .2 seconds. That's bad for you. Overall, to make this a good routine I'll have to switch sides halfway through sequences myself and cool down slower and longer. I wouldn't buy it again.",1340928000,26,861,4.161676646706587
4991329,3,B006IRQU5S,"I LOVE Jillian and I have all of her other videos but this one just doesn't do it for me. The moves are good but it felt lopsided and made me feel very uncoordinated. The punches and kicks just didn't flow and felt very awkward. I ended up just doing my own combination since it all burns calories. I do love the 20 minute segments when you are short on time or when you are using this in addition to something else but on it's own, it isn't my go to workout.",1340755200,2,459,4.0
4991330,4,B006IRQU5S,"Another customer stated that there wasn't a smooth transition into the moves and that I agree with. Once you get them down you are good to go, but theres not really an intro to them, you just do them and try and keep up. I am not an experienced kickboxer so that could be why. I.e, some people complain the same thing about Zumba, but bc I dance that in my normal life I can catch on quickly but I've NEVER kickboxed before. Regardless I give this vid 4 stars bc it is a workout and you are definitely sweating and working your body which is the entire point right? Just don't expect, if you are a beginner at this to get it right the first time around.",1340755200,,653,4.109375
4991331,5,B006IRQU5S,"I'm a huge fan of JM workout DVD's - I own several, some I like more than others.  I purchased this to use as additional cardio to some of the other 20 minute workouts of hers that I have been doing.  I am SO pleased with this purchase!  This helps get my cardio in and burn 250+ calories in a very short amount of time.  Before buying, I was spending over half an hour on the treadmill - BORING!  This workout is fast and fun!  FUN?  I know, right!  It's still HARD work, don't get me wrong - the first day I did it I was on the verge of tears trying to keep up, but now that I've done it a few times I actually ENJOY it!",1340582400,,622,3.8046875
4991332,4,B006IRQU5S,"I like many of Jillian Michaels' workout tapes. This one is fun to do, and different, which helps if your motivation is lagging. I agree with some of the earlier reviews that there are some problems--she doesn't equally work each side, there are mistakes shown where the model is using the wrong leg when kicking (fixed several frames later), and the choreography is a little tricky at first. Jillian insists that you pivot and get set in an awkward manner before one kicking sequence. I am on carpet and just ignored that. Overall, though, if you tweak a few things this is a fine workout. You can do all three segments at once (about 60 minutes), but I do Segment 1 and 2 one day, and Segment 2 and 3 next time, then 3 and 1 for a 40 minute workout. Just doing one segment is really too short unless you are supplementing with other exercise. Glad I bought this.",1340582400,,864,4.40625
4991333,5,B006IRQU5S,I like the workouts.  They are truly only 20 minutes. It is a good cardio workout and I have been enjoying it.  The only problem I have is that Jillian tends to only work one side of the body and doesn't do the same thing for the other side of the body.  I usually alternate on my own.,1340582400,,285,3.8793103448275863
4991334,2,B006IRQU5S,"I am not a big fan of this workout video.  I love kickboxing on the Wii and was hoping this was going to be something a little more like that.  I like that Julian works you out and you feel like you just worked out, but I am new to kickboxing and would like her to demonstrate a little better.  However, in a lot of her videos I find she doesn't show/demonstrate very well and once I feel lost or unable to do something I get upset and lose interest.  I think she doesn't grasp that everyone on the other side of the TV are not one of her girls and jsut learning for the first time.  Very disappointed and feel I wasted money.",1340150400,,626,4.016129032258065
4991339,5,B006IRQU5S,"I never watched the Biggest Loser but it seemed like Jillian Michaels was a good motivator so I bought a bunch of her DVDs. (Kickbox FastFix, Killer buns and thighs, No More trouble zones, and the only one I didn't open yet: 6 week 6 pack)
I couldn't be happier with them!  I started using them once or twice a week for a month now, and even though sometimes I can't complete the workouts (I have a 3 month old baby who sometimes interrupts the routine) I still feel the workout for one or two days after.

I am fighting to get the baby-weight off, and along with a kind-of-healthy diet, some walking almost daily, and these DVDs, I already lost 7 lbs in a month.

She is very good at explaining the moves, at giving you cues, and she keeps changing the workouts so that you don't get bored (and your body works out more).  She also explains which muscles you are working out so you can visualize which area will get stronger (you will feel it later anyway :-)) and that makes you feel like you are finally doing something for those problem areas.

The exercises get my heart pumping,and I work out under the ceiling fan at max.

Jillian is great, I'm a fan now, and I will keep using the DVDs because they are really working for me.  Turns out that what I needed to burn the fat was more that just taking daily walks, and this exercises get your heart rate up and you move the right muscles you need to exercise as a woman, especially after having a baby.  I highly recommend it.  It really works.",1339718400,2,1498,4.283687943262412
4991340,5,B006IRQU5S,"This is excellent! Unlike Jillian's other videos (I've done them all) she uses more than two girls to show you the moves. Some of the girls are overly hyper - constantly jumping and moving while others actually enjoy their rest time. This DVD is so perfect for getting out all your frustrations and, after a few viewings, is easy to follow. I admit that some of the footwork is tricky at first but what's great about Jillian is that it's really up to you how hard you want to push yourself. Another great addition to my collection!",1339459200,,531,4.484536082474227
4991341,5,B006IRQU5S,"I bought this DVD and Extreme Shed and Shred together.  I love both.  I like to have a lot of Jillian Michaels DVDs so I don't get bored and the kick boxing DVD is perfect for the weekday mornings when I can only do a 20 minute work out.  It is fast but jam packed with movement.  Each move is 30 seconds and 3 or 4 moves repeated make up a circuit.  And then four circuits gets you done in 20 minutes.  Did I say it moves fast?  The time flies by so quickly but you feel it. There are 3 workouts concentrating on upper body, lower body and abs respectively.  Because the work out moves change so quickly her pep talking is short but strong.  Jillian Michaels makes you feel like a kicking machine.  Fast Fix is the perfect title.",1339200000,,730,4.113475177304965

What I like the most that is it 20  min. 3 set workout, and you can do legs exercise while recovering arms the next day.

Like any work out, you have to not only  do it physicily, but also be in the state of mind to go for it and to feel good and healty. Everybody is individually build, and on her DVD you can see the crew of the girls who look differently from each other that I find very unique and useful. I like the music or a bit too, cause it is a work out and not a dance party, if you want to focus and make it work, just follow her and feel a stong, beautiful, and powerful woman you are.

All the best,

Personally, I find it very hard to follow along as it moves very fast and doesn't provide much time to get the moves down. I've done this workout twice now, 1 and 2 back to back, (20 mins is NOT enough!) but I think I'll stick with rotating other Jillian videos.",1338681600,,352,4.115942028985507

Do not buy it from Amazon. They burn it to a DVD-r when it ordered and is not the highest quality. Okay if you are only going to use a few times, but if you are like me, and like this workout (I like adding one of the 20 minutes segments at the end of my p90x workouts for extra cardio, and some days I'll do all 3 for a 60 minute workout), I have the feeling the DVD will not last as long as I need to. so BUYER BEWARE.. Go for the DVD, but don't buy it from Amazon!",1338681600,,628,3.7293233082706765
4991346,2,B006IRQU5S,"I was very excited to get this DVD.  When its too hot to run outside with my son, I have to squeeze in a workout during nap time, so I am very attracted to the quick and fast workouts like the Shred.
The first disappointment was the tutorial.  You pretty much should go through it unless you are an avid kick boxer.  Having taken live instruction kick box classes I thought I would be fine without it, but I had to go back and watch it which limited my actual workout time.
Second, this workout is super fast with zero learning curve.  You are expected to know the moves and go right into complex combinations, which just led me floundering around trying to get the steps correct.  If you are not already well versed in kick boxing, I think it would be hard for most people- and the tutorial didn't do much to help.
Third, the workouts seem ""one sided"", which bothers me- I seem to be working one arm and leg more then the other.  I don't want end up lopsided.
Fourth, there are WAY too many extra people in the video, half of which are showing off or not going in time with the others or Jillian.  It is very distracting and makes it hard when you're trying to figure out who the heck to watch and what you should be doing.
The plus was that it goes super fast when I'm motivated enough to flail around to the DVD for 20 minutes
I'm not out of shape- I work out 4-5 days a week, but I am definitely not a ""kick boxer"".  I am interested in getting a pretty good workout in a short period of time.  I just thought this would be a fun change up, but it wasn't.  If you're looking for what I was looking for, I would look elsewhere when it comes to this DVD.",1338422400,6,1655,4.111801242236025
4991347,5,B006IRQU5S,"I absolutely love this DVD. I have almost all of Jillian's workout DVDs and I have to say this is by far the most fun one. The three workouts available are great to do alone if you are short on time, but I typically do one right after the other to get a longer workout. I love how I feel while doing the workout and after when I am drenched in sweat!
I think this is a great DVD that everyone should have in their collection.",1338422400,,425,3.953488372093023
4991348,3,B006IRQU5S,"I hate to exercise and I don't have much free time so I'm a sucker for any fitness DVD that claims to be able to deliver results in less than 30 minutes. At around $10 at Wal Mart, the price was right so I bought this DVD.  I'm an on and off (lately mostly off) exerciser who has long since given up on the dream of finding a routine that I like well enough to do on a daily basis that will also melt off the pounds.  Due to my ongoing love affair with chocolate and fast food, I don't expect much in the way of weight loss anyway, but I would like to remain reasonably fit and mobile for my golden years, which are decades away so it's hard to remain focused on the goal.  This DVD isn't a dream come true, but it does what it sets out to do - give one a vigorous workout in 20 minutes.

The moves are fast and slightly complicated if you're not accustomed to kickboxing moves.  I can see how someone new to it could get discouraged, but if you do it for a few days, you'll be able to pick it up.  The cues come quickly with almost no time for thinking.  I'm not a huge fan of Michaels.  I prefer the perky cheerleader type of instructor.  Michaels is more no-nonsense and abrasive.  As far as the moves go, this workout is similar to the Beach Body programs I have tried - Turbo Jam, Turbo Fire, and Slim in 6.  The Beach Body programs, especially Turbo Jam and Fire, are, dare I say, more ""fun"", but they are more dancey and the workouts are longer.  The Slim in 6 line is sort of in between this DVD and the Turbos.  It is less dancey and more like working out with a personal trainer, but most of them tend to run long.

This DVD may not be appropriate for people with injury or age related issues.  For the most part, either you keep up or you get left in the dust.  Adjusting the height of the kicks is about the only way to modify it.  For an uncomplicated fitness program that takes less coordination and can be done at any fitness or skill level, I recommend Leslie Sansone's walking DVDs.  If I had to choose one program and be forced to do it every day, I'd pick Sansone's.",1338336000,2,2085,4.081081081081081

I FOUND OUT THAT WITH KICKBOXING YOU NEED TO START OFF WITH A GOOD STRETCH WARMUP, AND BECAUSE SHE DIDNT REALLY HAVE THAT ON THE VIDEO I JUST DID IT AND SERIOUSLY HURT MY BACK.

4991351,3,B006IRQU5S,"I have all of JM's DVDs and I love about 80% of them. Kickbox Fastfix does not fall into that 80%. It's good, but it's not great. This is because your heart rate doesn't get high enough. I like to kill myself in JM's workouts, and I was really pushing myself following these moves, and I still didn't feel challenged. This was even though I had 4 pound weights in each hand whenever feasible. I think she needed to add some more plyometric intervals.
However, the workouts are pretty fun. Just ignore the over-acting by the actress wannabes, and focus instead on Natalie and Anita, who really should have stood at the front the whole time.
If you want JM workouts that kill you, Level 2 of Six Week Sixpack, Level 3 of 30 Day Shred, Level 1 of Extreme Shed and Shred and the whole of Killer Buns and Thighs is where you should be focusing your energy. And if you want to shake and burn, try Yoga Meltdown. Kickbox Fastfix is fun, and I'll definitely add to it the mix, but if you want really good results try the aforementioned workouts instead.",1338163200,9,1045,4.391752577319588

Each are only 20 min long. I have been doing two workouts back-to-back each time. I sweat so much with these. My calorie burn is pretty high (about 200 calories per 20 min workout using a HRM). So I burn approx 400 calories in 40 min (2 workouts) of kickbox fastfix as compared to about 450 calories doing 55 min of ""Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism."" It is definitely one of her higher calorie burning dvds.

If you did Jillian's body revolution, you'll notice that much of the same cast is included in this one (Mimi, Anita, Terry Ann, and Natalie) with two new women (not sure their names).",1338163200,,754,4.2

This product was designed for the busy woman, however in order to get the most after burn it is suggested to exercise for at least thirty min so I combine workouts one and two. I just wish it was a little longer and had more workouts. Overall I am extremely happy with this purchase! Jillian always says ""do what you love"" , and I love kickboxing.

I give this 4 stars only because I've noticed that my front knee hurts when I do the spinning round kick. I have never had knee problems before or since doing that move, so it's probably bad form or something. I've tried to correct my form, based on her explanation and tutorial; however, it feels like I am over-exerting my front knee and for some reason, I just can't get that move down.

I suggest taking the time to watch it through whatever level you plan on doing before you actually do it. Practice the moves.

I previously favored the most Banish Fat Boost Metabolism, and No More Trouble Zones before this video. This kickboxing DVD gives a massive burn, and great results. The only suggestion I make is to do all 3 videos back to back for maximum results.(Which may sound crazy, but hear me out.) Video 1 is for targeting arms, and has three sections where weights are required, this first video will start to make you sweat, but not intensely. video two is to target legs, this video is the most difficult of the three. It will make you sweat a ton by the end, but I still challenge you to do level three. level three is easy compared to any Jillian workout. It is mostly ab moves, and butt-kick type familiar type moves. It is actually a great way to cool down, after video #2. At the end of workout 2 I always have thoughts of being done, I have always ended with 3 and have never regretted it. 60 minutes with all 3 workouts.

Try the challange people,you will not regret it.
60 minutes of kickboxing burns close to 530 calories depending on body size.
Have fun!

Ps: the moves deffinatly get a lot easier after practice. Do not get frustrated, just keep moving your body even if you get a litle mixed up at first.

4991412,5,B006IRQU5S,This DVD is definitely a workout!!! This is the first Jillian Michaels workout dvd I have owned and she really kicks your butt!!! I would recommend this to anyone and I will probably buy more of her dvds in the future.,1335484800,,218,4.341463414634147
4991413,5,B006IRQU5S,I thought this would be a quick 20 minute workout but it kicks your butt!!! It challenges you which appeals to me because usually I get bored with the same routine.  I cant say enough about this work out and what I like its that there are three work outs one focuses on upper body two focuses on lower body and three on abs.  It a great video try it out and if you don't like it which I think you will you won't be out much cash because its inexpensive.,1335484800,,453,3.967032967032967
4991414,5,B006IRQU5S,"I am a workout DVD junkie, have most of Jillian's (as well as many MANY others) and this is the one that I keep coming back to. I love how fast paced it is! There is a much larger group of girls in the video, and more energetic music and those two elements improve the energy of the workout so much! I don't find myself getting bored, skipping moves, or slacking off, because the ladies are all so into it, and that is contagious! I only wish there was a longer workout, sometimes I end up combining two of the workouts because 20 minutes just doesn't seem like a long enough sweat session... and trust me, you will sweat!",1335484800,5,622,4.235294117647059
4991415,5,B006IRQU5S,Jillian really gets you sweating in 20 mins. Have only done the first two workouts and love them. I would highly recommend adding this DVD to any collection.,1335312000,,157,4.642857142857143
4991416,5,B006IRQU5S,"Let me start by saying, I have a large amount of JM's DVDs, including her new Body Revolution. Kickboxing is one of my favs and I do it prob the most BUT, there are going to be negatives on this DVD, I am sure bc it's not her typical workout AND it's Kickboxing which I think some people have misconceptions about. Many will complain she doesn't work both sides equally, but I disagree. She DOES work both sides, but in your fighting stance. This is how you would be taught in any martial arts class, so she's not incorrect in teaching in this manner. But, you're not going to do say, a front kick, the same way, on both legs. If you are very concerned about this (I am not), then check out Billy Blanks DVD's. IMO, he's one of the best in terms of equal w/out on both sides w/kickboxing. That being said, I love this DVD- The dvd is 3, 20 min workouts that are divided as Arms, Legs and Abs. When you first start, it will seem easy bc you are learning the moves. After a few times, I had the moves down and it was one of her sweatier workouts for me as long as I push myself. That's the key. Use heavier weights and push yourself. If you're just haphazardly punching, it's mild. But I put everything I have into it and it's sweaty! I typically do 2 workouts and aim to do all 3, if I can. Each segment has 4 circuits that are repeated 2x's. Some moves are not repeated and those are typically her combo moves as I believe she extends her time on these so as not to repeat them later. Each circuit contains a strength training/ply move. Each segment features arms, legs or abs, but you work arms, abs, legs regardless. So each workout can be a stand alone OR you can do the whole DVD. I like this bc it's so workable with my other workouts. On my strength training days, I do one-2 segments. On harder cardio days, I do the whole thing. I also like that the music is more up to date, studio nice, many students. I prefer cardio and most of her dvds are circuit/STing heavy at times, so I love this one. My favorite used to be BFBM, but has been quickly replaced by this DVD. BFBM changed my body and literally changed my cardio ability. It is my first great love of w/out DVDs. This DVD reshaped my quads though. The lunge/kick move in the Legs segment made my legs BURN and changed them. FYI- I've done the RI30, Extreme Shed and Shred, BFBM, NMTZ's, etc...But this one made my legs burn a bit more. For me, I tend to rotate this DVD w/her Cardio #2 on her Body Revolution along w/BR workouts, occassionally dipping back to the RI30 (I'm on week 3 for reference)and the BFBM/NMTZ's workouts.  I really mix it up. I tend to do 2 Kickboxing segments and her NMTZ's first half for a good workout or week 5/6 of her BR workout. Really depends on my mood. Negatives, I think, would be that it's faster paced (you will catch on after a few times though), doesn't work both sides equally (which I disagree with), some moves not repeated a second time (again, I feel this was done on purpose), and just different than most kickboxing DVD's as she puts STing and plyo moves into each segment. A positive for me as I find some kickboxing too easy for me at times as my cardio level is just up there.",1335312000,4,3190,4.229508196721311
4991417,5,B006IRQU5S,"I've used The Shred many times over the past ten weeks. I recently bought this on Amazon streaming and love it. It's a longer, harder workout. I know I burn more with this one. When an exercise is too hard for me I pick one that I know but that is lower impact and keep my heart rate up, all the same. If you like The Shred, you'll love this.",1335225600,,342,3.9
4991418,5,B006IRQU5S,This dvd is very fun but a good workout at the same time.  I've never kick boxed before and I was able to do everything but not at the speed of the dvd at first.  Took some coordination.  As always Jillian's new dvd is awesome!,1335139200,,227,4.0
4991419,5,B006IRQU5S,I own almost all of Jillian's workout DVDs and I must say this one is my favorite! I've always had an interest in kickboxing so I was quite excited when it came out. The moves can be complicated but I just go with it and after a few run throughs you'll get it down. I never did do the tutorial though so maybe that would help. The only downside to me is that the dvd is broken up into three 20 minute workouts but there is no feature just to do them all in a row which is what I always do. Once the cool down starts I stop it and move into the next one which isn't too bad since the warm ups are fast and still keep the heart rate up. With all three workouts combined I burn around 600 calories! It's a really fun workout and it goes by really fast. I definitely recommend it!,1335052800,2,776,3.9177215189873418
4991420,1,B006IRQU5S,"I like Jillian Michaels but I did not like this workout DVD.  All three workouts seem strikingly similar.  As another reviewer stated, the moves are way too quick so they don't flow well and Jillian doesn't work the other side of the body for the second circuit. I also agree that Cathe Friedrich's DVDs on the same topic are the best...",1334880000,9,337,4.508196721311475
4991421,4,B006IRQU5S,"I am a huge fan of Jillian Michaels and am always impressed by her workouts. This one did not fail to deliver. It's high intensity cardio and I found myself having a great time learning kickboxing moves along the way. The one negative thing I will say is that by the time the 20 minutes were through, I felt like I hadn't really started. These workouts are exactly 20 minutes as opposed to her other videos which tend to run over. This video starts strong and ends strong. If you are in the intermediate to advanced stage of your fitness, I would suggest doing at least two or all three of the workouts. If you are a beginner, I would suggest trying one of the circuits. She doesn't really give you too many ""beginner moves"" but, the encouragement from the girls helps to push you along. Bottom line: I didn't waste my money.",1334793600,,825,4.398692810457517
4991432,5,B006IRQU5S,Jillian has never disappointed me with her workouts.  Each one will challenge you and you will end up in a pool of sweat when you are done.  Each of the 20 minute work outs are VERY fast paced and keep you moving the entire time.,1334534400,,229,4.066666666666666
4991433,4,B006IRQU5S,"I must confess having a love/ hate relationship with Jillian. I am not super in love with her personality (and after hearing her say that she would never have children because of how it ruins your body, I was a little put off), but you cannot deny the greatness of her workouts. This video definitely brings on a sweat. I just had a baby 7 month ago (hence the touchiness of the previous Jillian comment) and am trying to work off that last 7 pounds of my baby weight. And this video definitely helps me to feel like I am well on my way to getting there. I have tried other trainers, but Jillian, I must confess always seems to have the best workouts. I LOVE her 30 day Shred and was really excited about this video.

My problem with it is that I haven't quite caught on to the moves yet. I did the tutorial first, but I think I may need to do it a few more times before I can keep up with Jillian and the girls. It is just a bit too foreign to me. However, I don't think it is impossible for newbies. I look forward to adding it into my rotation.

Did I mention that it was FUN to throw a few punches????

**** UPDATE **** I stand corrected on her comment about pregnancy. The article was taken out of context. Sorry Jillian!

4991434,5,B006IRQU5S,"Okay, truthfully, this isn't the hardest workout I have ever done. It's not even close, unless you do all three back to back. But here's the truth: you do break a sweat, you can make it harder by adding weights or pushing yourself to give more. If you are one of those lucky people who has time, do three of them together and you'll get results fast. I am not one of those lucky people. I have a family. I have a full time job and I attend school on top of that. Yes- I am a little busy. In order to work out at all, I have to get up super early- and talking myself out of bed is not easy, either. When I got this DVD and it said ""20 minute workouts"", I thought they were probably more like 30. (I've done enough Jillian workouts to know that she only counts the actual workout when she says it's 20 minutes- the warm up and cool down do not count) So imagine my surprise when it actually was done in 20 minutes. I was relieved! I have had to stop doing workouts in the middle of them so I didn't run late in the mornings getting ready for work and getting kids ready for school. So, I love these, because it feels worthwhile to get up in the morning, because I will have time to do the whole workout. I can also talk myself out of bed much easier for a 20 minute workout.

The thing I will say about this is, this is probably best for maintenance and not weight loss. You need to work out longer, you need the interval training with weights if you are going to really change your body. For me, these prevent me from gaining more weight, but they don't help me lose weight and it doesn't do much in the way of toning.

Workout one focuses on upper body, and the first couple times, I felt a little sore. Not so anymore. I do still break a sweat, and will soon need to add the three pound weights to the entire workout to feel a burn at all. That's okay, though. Like I said, I just do this to maintain my weight where I am at.

Workout two focuses on lower body, but it doesn't do a whole lot for me in that regard. This is the best cardio workout of the three, though. If you just want to sweat a lot, this is the recommended workout. After Killer Buns and Thighs as well as the Extreme Shed and Shred, my lower body is immune to this workout. No muscle pain after completing this workout to remind me all day that I worked out. Again, good for maintenance, not for fat shedding.

Workout three focuses on the abs, and after 6 week six pack, this workout is child's play. Still helps you work up a good sweat. Worth doing, but I wouldn't count on this workout to be the one to finally get those ripped abs you've been wanting. Not even 6 week six pack did that for me and THAT is a killer workout.

All in all, I give this a 5 star rating because I can keep myself from losing the progress I have made. When I finish school and just have the one full time job and a family to take care of, I can do the more time consuming workouts and not have to start from square one. The energy in these workouts is positive and upbeat. I like Jillian in these workouts, I like that Natalie and Anita are back. I like that there is a bigger group, and most of all, I like that they are really 20 minute workouts. Kickboxing is a fun way to start the morning. This will be my go to workout on days I don't really feel like working out.",1334361600,5,3322,4.034901365705615
4991435,5,B006IRQU5S,"The first time I used this DVD, it kicked my butt. I've used it several times and have worked through all the workouts. I'm still learning the moves, but I definitely get a great cardio burn with this.",1334361600,,201,4.315789473684211

Like most JM vids, this is broken up into 3 20 minute workouts (Upper Body, Lower body, & Abs). For me, there is just something about kickboxing. Not only is it a great workout, but its a great stress reliever! There is never a boring moment in this video, and if you want to increase the difficulty add weights (weighted kickboxing gloves are AMAZING)!",1334188800,,585,4.4672897196261685

I've always enjoyed Jillian's workout DVDs. This one is definitely no exception.

Jillian is definitely my favorite. I have also tried Tae Bo and I think it is OK. Billy Banks to me is annoying and never stops talking. Also a lot of his moves I couldn't see using in any martial arts. I like how Jillian has the tutorial and really breaks down each move. She even tells you when you would use each move in a fight. It is now one of my favorites. Even though they are only 20 minutes you do get sweaty and out of breath. I do more than one at a time. I just hope she comes out with more kickboxing DVDs.,1334016000,,671,3.9051094890510947

Even though each workout is 20min, by the end of each you are sweating...alot! It is very effective.

4991441,4,B006IRQU5S,"I like the Jillian Michaels 20 minute workout series and use them a lot. With this one, you just jump right into each one, no warmup for any of them, which I found I needed to stop and warm up myself beforehand - that part is a little strange. But, they are no more than 20 minutes a piece, so nice for a weeknight workout when in a timecrunch. I found with each level, the first time I did them I didn't get much of a workout because I spent so much time trying to figure out the complicated moves. But, with a couple of tries, I got the hang of it and the workouts are much more effective now. It makes me feel better that even some of the girls in the video don't seem to be able to figure out some of the moves. :)",1333670400,,718,3.891156462585034

4991473,4,B006IRQU5S,"I was looking forward to this workout video. I really love kickboxing, and thought it would may the time go fast. I study two martial arts and I'm familiar with kickboxing moves, so I had no trouble following along for most of the workout. Jillian only tells you the sequence one time, and then you're on your own. It would have been better if she spoke the moves for the rest of the sequence: jab, cross, hook, uppercut etc. You can follow the tutorial until you get the moves down.

I did two of the workouts for 40 minutes because 20 minutes wasn't enough to get a sweat up yet. The harder you work and focus, the more you'll sweat. Some of the kicks were somewhat complicated for an exercise routine. Modify and make up some stuff on your own if you can't do the moves exactly. I thought straight kicks would have been just as effective without worrying about twisting my knee. Jillian only works the dominant side for most of the kickbox moves. I work both sides since that's what I'm used to with my martial arts classes.

She does a pretty good job at making sure to review good form, as she usually does. Her other workout videos have uppercuts looking like you're hitting Larry Bird or something, without any correct body mechanics. So, I'm assuming she has someone on the sidelines now consulting on the martial arts moves. The last thing I would mention is that this is an exercise video. This is not a self defense video. This video will make you stronger and more fit so you can fight back in an attack, but don't slip into this false sense of security that you are some kung fu master because you do this video or any other kickboxing video, like Taebo. Take an actual martial arts class.

If you like Jillian's other videos, you'll like this one. Fast, fun, and efficient.",1333411200,2,1787,4.458715596330276
4991474,4,B006IRQU5S,"I am a complete JM addict. I have completed 30 day shred, Ripped in 30, 6 week 6 pack and also have Banish Fat Boost Metabollism. I love doing Body Combat classes at the gym, but that's all I really go to at the gym these days as I have so many home workout DVD's, so when I heard this was coming out I thought 'hallelujah! maybe this is the answer to getting out of that gym contract and doing combat at home!'

The workouts themselves are split into 3 x 20 minute workouts, but I tend to do it as a full hour. So here lies the down side for me - each 20 minute workout contains a warm up and a cool down, so I wish there was an option to combine the 3 workouts. I quickly flick back to the main menu and start the next level before the cool down starts, but the warm ups aren't traditional warm ups they get your heart pumping straight away so you don't feel like you're stopping and starting too much.

The DVD is good for all levels of fitness and I'd say if you haven't already got a JM workout DVD, I'd do this first and then move onto the resistance/weight workouts like Ripped or Shred. It's a fantastic DVD to mix in with your resistance training. Some of the combinations are a little tricky at first and I got a little frustrated with the flow, but after a few go's of this DVD I am much more comfortable with the routine.

This is a high energy, good cardio workout, on my HRM I get a good 700+ calories burnt for the full hour, but alas, it will not be replacing my gym Body Combat classes, which are alot more high impact, but that's just my personal preference.",1333324800,,1576,4.093851132686084

Level 1 is for beginners and let me tell you, it really gets your heart rate up! This is excellent for when you only have 20 minutes to workout or you can do more than one workout together to really sweat! Jillian is very motivating and ensures that you are learning proper form.

4991478,3,B006IRQU5S,"I like that Jillian is always trying different styles of workouts and moves - it keeps me interested and since I usually love her workouts, I thought this one would be great. I'm reviewing this DVD on my first impression, based on trying the DVD 1 time through, so keep that in mind. I'm in good shape, exercising 4-5 times a week and do a variety of different types of workouts. I haven't done much kickboxing, but I'm generally pretty coordinated. My first impression of this DVD was that the music was way too much louder than her instruction. That bugged me a little, but its not a critique on the actual workout. I liked the workouts okay, but I found that some of the combinations were too complex to pick up on the first time through. I'm sure I'd get it after a couple more times, but I prefer, when complex moves are introduced, that the instructor progressively add in steps so that you can follow easily. So if its ""kick, punch, punch, squat, back leg kick, punch,"" you start out with just a couple ""kick, punch"" then you move on to a couple ""kick, punch, punch, squat,"" then you do the whole progression. I felt like the first time I did the DVD, I didn't actually get as much of a workout because I was trying to follow the moves. I will, however, try it again and may actually end up liking it more after getting down the moves.",1332633600,3,1342,4.350597609561753
4991479,5,B006IRQU5S,"I have to be honest and say that I wasn't one to jump on the Jillian bandwagon right off. I tried her 30 Day Shred DVD and let's just say, wasn't a fan of it.  I have very weak wrists and that workout focused way too much on the plank position.  However, with her Kickbox Fastfix DVD, I find that I look forward to popping that DVD in to get the sweat dripping and the blood flowing.

Workout One focuses on the upper body.  If you are new to kickboxing, don't be discouraged.  Before you get started on the actual workouts, she has a tutorial you can watch to get familiar with.  Even if you feel you haven't mastered the art of kickboxing, she does a great job of demonstrating how to do the moves.  There are several other girls that you can watch as well.  At first I felt lost, and I've done kickboxing before, but now I feel I can do it smoothly with no problem.

Workout Two focuses on the lower body.  There are some awesome kicks and maneuvers that will definitely keep your heart rate up, even if it is just 20 minutes, you'll definitely get what you need out of it.

Workout Three is for your abs.  Whew, it's probably my favorite out of the three.

The workouts all have four circuits, with 2 sets of each movement, lasting 30 seconds each.  It's a great, beneficial exercise you can do, especially for those who are pressed for time and can't make their way to a gym.  I definitely recommend this and I am definitely on the Jillian Michaels bandwagon now.  Kickboxing has now become my favorite way to get my fitness in!",1332547200,,1533,4.289198606271777
4991480,4,B006IRQU5S,"Just to give you an idea of my viewpoint for this review - I am a midlevel exerciser and have lots of JM DVDS, my favorites being NMTZ and BFBM which I do three times a week each (occasionally changing around with others) I've been doing this for around 4 months.  So I'm not super advanced or super beginner. I've done a bit of Muay Thai training, not a lot. I'm also 10-15 lb overweight.

So anyhow, this workout is really fun and flies by. I did workout 1-3 all together which comes in just under 60 minutes. To me it didn't seem as intense as BFBM (which has me huffing and sweating by circuit 2), and in kickbox fastfix I didn't start really feeling it as much until the 3rd workout.(40 mins in) However, I think part of that is still learning the moves, and the first time you do something with more complex combination, you cant do it full effort since you're trying to get the moves down. I think once I have the combos it'll be a great all over workout that flies by in 60 mins. My only complaint is that there is no ""play all"" option . I think 20 minutes isn't long enough , but all three together is great. I just wish you could choose that option instead of having to go to main menu after each mini segment.",1332547200,3,1220,4.165254237288136

I just think Jillian knows her stuff, and she shows that with the variety of DVDs she provides. I agree with the reviewers who say she repeats moves in her various DVDs, but how is she NOT going to when she has so many DVDs and she wants to do quality exercises that work fast?! I found this DVD a lot different from Ripped in 30 (which I also do enjoy) in the way that it's more fast paced and cardio based. You are kicking nad punching a ton, and it moves VERY fast. If you're someone who gets bored easily, this workout should be good for you because it is no joke 20 minutes, and it's a fast 20 minutes! IMO, it's one of her fastest moving DVDS, and I've done the ones I mentioned plus No More Trouble Zones and Banish the Fat. (her longer workouts) These workouts are challenging but not so strenuous that you can't choose to do 2 out of the 3 or even 3 (that's my next goal) in a row. She has them divided into a lower body, upper body, and abs focus, which is nice to change up depending on your desired areas to target/mood. I love Jillian as I think she understands the value of exercise for overall self-esteem and mental health as well as physical fitness! Spend the 10 bucks-you'll be glad!",1332374400,,1358,4.167300380228137
4991502,1,B006IRQU5S,"I like Jillian Michaels for the most part but I did not like this workout and I've been doing cardio kickboxing for years. The moves are way too quick so they don't flow well and Jillian doesn't work the other side of the body for the second circuit.  If you want a good kickboxing DVD Cathe Friedrich is the best!!! I own three of her DVDs and love them.  Cathe's DVD are a little more expensive but don't forget, sometimes you get what you pay for.",1332374400,27,450,4.22093023255814

4991504,5,B006IRQU5S,"I love this workout. I""m a HUGE Jillian fan...owning I believe my daughter counted 9 of her DVDs.  This is my new fav!  You can do 20 min, 40min. or a full 60.  Yes, the moves are challenging, but once you do it a couple times it's not hard to do the moves anymore.  The audio is not the greatest.  The music is too loud, so you can't hear JIllian as well.  Jillian changed it up a bit.  Instead of 2 girls there are a bunch.  they are kind of annoying in their facial expressions and grunts and ""wooohoo""s.  But I can get past it if it's a great workout..which it is!",1332374400,2,568,4.0
4991505,5,B006IRQU5S,These workouts are great. It is amazing that she can make you sweat that much in just a 20 minute workout.,1332201600,,106,4.095238095238095
4991506,5,B006IRQU5S,"I very enthusiastically LOVE this video!! I checked it out from my local library first and, within one workout, decided to order my own copy. I have done it a few times now and really enjoy it. It is a little different for Jillian-- very fresh approach for her. Sometimes her 'tough love' approach does not thrill me (though I own and regularly use many of her videos). This one is just plain fun to do! I have been doing Tae Bo for many years now and also have the previous Jillian kickboxing video. This one is my current favorite for either a quick add-on workout to my regular routine, or combine all three workouts for an hour-long sweat-fest. I personally feel as if the moves do work both sides of the body fairly evenly. I am extremely satisfied with this product. Well done!",1331942400,2,783,4.444444444444445
4991507,5,B006IRQU5S,"Whoa, are you ready to pay attention? If you have trouble focusing I'm sure you won't have any trouble during Jillian's latest. I'm so thankful that she finally came out with a kickbox DVD, since she has some moves and combos in other workouts but nothing as complete as this. I did workout 3, the abs workout, early in the morning and it was not nearly as painful as some of her other workouts. If you've ever done Six Week Six Pack first thing in the morning, you know what I'm talking about. The workouts in this DVD make me feel like I'm in a class rather than watching two athletes model the moves. The pace is nearing frantic, the music is constant, and Jillian as usual cheers you on during the whole thing. Before I knew it, it was over and it was time for the cooldown. I've got about ten years of martial arts experience, and while I'm familiar with these many of these moves and combinations, it took me a few times to move as fast as the women are moving and get into the groove. If you're new to kickboxing or this type of workout it might take you a few times too, but it's so much fun and will leave you exhilarated at the end (and no doubt in great shape in no time). And a side note: the group of women doing the workouts are not smiling the whole time as you see in some other DVDs, so another element of reality is added. I don't smile jumping in and out of plank pose...do you? Enjoy!",1331942400,2,1404,4.165441176470588
4991508,3,B006IRQU5S,"I'm sorry JM, but this just was not one of your better videos, in my opinion. First off, let me say I understand it is not the same, but I am very familiar with Tae Bo and I think that made this video much easier for me too be able to do. I think if you are not as familiar with such kinds of workouts it might take some time too catch on. That being said, for the most part I found these work outs quite doable (I did get rather confused with some of the combos but more on that later.) I do not think there is any reason someone who is new to kickboxing (or does not have a martial arts background, I don't) could not do them. As described, there are three twenty minute work outs (I find usually Jillian's workouts are longer than she says they are,)and a tutorial. I did do all three work outs, but too be honest I did not see very much difference in intensity between the levels. Jillian really just jumps right in; there was no real difference between the warm ups and other circuits I felt. This kind of annoyed me because I don't want to do a warm up before I even start a video, I think it should be included on the video. And I would rather gently start warming up my body gradually, than just jumping right in, with high knees for example. This is not as well organized as her other DVDs are. She does circuits with a combination at the end and I noticed that the second time through a circuit she leaves off the combination, in the level two and three work outs. As for the people who have been upset that she stays on the same side, she explains why she does this repeatedly, she even explains why she does this in her other videos. I stayed on my left and had no problem with it, it was not uneven. However, if you really want to do it on both sides there is no reason why you can't do it on one side in the first circuit and switch sides for the second, or play the video twice so you get a longer work out. As others have mentioned, she is not as instructional during these videos as she is in her other videos. She also has a lot more girls in this video than she usually does, so she does not 'pick' on the girls the way she does in her other videos. I did break a sweat doing these videos, but I did not find them to be as challenging as I had expected (I did level one on a day I had already worked out for the day and was easily able to do it. I did levels two and three back to back, again on a day that I had already worked out, and was able to do them.) What I did find to be a challenge, were the combinations. I felt that some of them were really awkward, consequentially my heart rate went down while I slowed down to go through them properly. As I said I did not find these work outs to be as challenging as hoped for, however as JM always says: if it's so freaking easy, add weights and go faster. So, you can definitely make them more intense on your own. Interestingly, level one was the only video in which your instructed to use weights, and the girls use them. (I used 5 lb weights, I did not add them for levels two or three.) The cardio moves were standard Jillian moves (jumping jacks, butt kicks, high knees, mountain climbers,etc) and some new moves (IE suicide runs.)And the cool downs was also very similar to her other cool downs. Overall, I am not thrilled with this new DVD, but I am going to keep it. It can definitely be intensified with added weights, range of motion and speed. And can be a fun supplement to other workouts. It's also convenient to have shorter work outs that can be done together or separately. Would I recommend this DVD? If you are a diehard JM fan and have an open mind about trying workouts that are not her typical style, yes. If you are interested in trying kickboxing and have the patience, or are looking for a short, fun, less intense (but modifiable) workout, yes. If you are looking for classic Jillian, not interested in trying an 'outside the box' work out, or looking for a very intense workout, no.",1331942400,3,3979,4.135483870967742
4991509,2,B006IRQU5S,"After watching the tutorial portion of this DVD yesterday (which, in itself, was challenging, trying to remember ALL of the punches and kicks!), I ATTEMPTED to do the workout (almost completed it) and found that I honestly just HATED it! Unlike ""ripped"" or ""shred"" (both of which I LOVE and have been doing for about 2 years, with GREAT results!!), the pace is just too fast, with very little (if any!) in-progress instruction, and if you pause for a second to try to clarify a move, you're already behind!! Yes, I expected kickboxing to be fast-paced, but so is ""ripped"", and THAT'S still easy to follow! This is just a FRUSTRATING DVD if you have NO experience with kickboxing or martial arts! Plus, having gotten such great results with ""shred"" and ""ripped"" (but just wanted to add something into my routine, for variety), I feel that the learning curve on this one is just too high, meaning that all the time I'd have to spend learning all of the different punches and kicks and then trying to go smoothly from one into the next, I COULD simply be spending getting a great heart-pounding, high-intensity, exhaustive workout from ""ripped"" and ""shred""! Why put that kind of time into it?? PLUS, and this is a BIG one for anyone who's over 40 and/or who has had any prior shoulder, hip, or knee injuries (as I do - all of that youth-fueled craziness of weight-lifting, mountain-biking, etc.), there is WAY TOO MUCH PIVOTING AND TWISTING - no WAY my joints will stand up to this!! Overall, a frustrating workout and just not worth the time or energy! Sorry, Jillian!!",1331856000,5,1567,4.681159420289855

Update i had to come back and update about this workout. Wow my abs are so tight and flat i can't believe my eyes. I use to do taebo but jillian workout got my abs in better shape. At the beginning i did not like this workout due to the moves. Boy im i glad i did not give up because once i mastered the moves, i now cant go a day without do it.

I love kickboxing and Jillian makes it fun, effective and a fast burn.  It has 3 different workouts, each are 20 min. long so it gives you no excuse to get a great burn in on any day.  The 1st focuses on the upper boby, the 2nd on lower body, and the 3rd on core.  I highly recommend this dvd to everyone.

4991524,5,B006IRQU5S,"I own ALL of Jillian Michael's DVDs.  She has kicked my ass into SUPER shape..and I just love everything about her workouts.  I especially LOVE this DVD. All three workout are so much fun and energizing..and super great for a day where things didn't go ""quite right"": nothing fixes a bad day like kicking and punching the air!

 I haven't sweat this hard in AGES.  The workouts move SO FAST--you're constantly moving, breathing hard..by the time you know it the workout is over!!! Just like that!  20 minutes?!  You can do it!  In fact, I bet you'll be so pumped up like I was, you'll want to try another work out when you finish the first one!!

Just a slight change compared to her other DVDS, these workouts do not have a separate/traditional ""warm-up""....you really just jump right into each work out..so if this worries you, maybe do a light warm up on your own before kicking the hell out of the air!

I highly recommend this workout DVD...and ANYTHING by Jill...she is really the best and has changed my life, and she can change yours with these awesome exercise DVDs!",1331683200,3,1075,4.5811518324607325
4991525,5,B006IRQU5S,"For the past year and a half, I have made a sincere effort to work out 5-6 days a week in order to improve my fitness and lifestyle. While I don't mind strength training, working out has not always been easy for me because I seriously hate cardio. Hate is probably a vast understatement, as my endurance and stamina have always been lacking and most kinds of long-lasting, strenuous aerobic exercise are not fun for me. I've been trying to work on that but have yet to find a form of cardio that I can somewhat enjoy instead of suffer through. With that being said, I have been absolutely thrilled with this latest DVD from Jillian. I tried kickboxing a few years ago and did like it, but I made the mistake of never sticking with it. After completing each of the three workouts on this DVD, I am confident that this is something I can keep up with. Each work out is fast paced but full of energy and tons of fun! The first time I completed this workout I couldn't believe how quickly the time flew by! Granted, each workout is only 20 minutes, but I am usually looking at my DVD player in disbelief at the 10 minute mark and wondering how much longer I have to push through. What's great about this DVD is if you're pressed for time you can just do one of the workouts - however, if you have more time available you can push through two of them or all of them and not feel like you're going to fall over and die at the end. Even if you only have time to do one workout, you will start to heat up and sweat like crazy in no time. This is definitely different compared to you average Jillian workout, but you will see a couple of familiar faces (Anita and Natalie from 30 Day Shred and Killer Buns & Thighs), and I liked how she added more girls to help demonstrate throughout the workout. I felt more like I was in an actual class than alone in my garage, which is a nice feeling. As usual, Jillian is very motivational, upbeat, tough yet encouraging. Another great part about this DVD is the tutorial you can (and should) watch prior to beginning any of the workouts. A problem I've had with other newer Jillian workouts is I have found them to be complicated and hard to keep up with due to lack of instruction, but the tutorial you can view and work along to in this DVD solves that issue! Overall, a fantastic addition to my workout routine and I will continue to do this 2-3 times a week. I highly recommend you add this to your exercise regimen as well, because not only will you have a great time, you'll get a good workout out of it too!",1331683200,,2545,4.238683127572016
4991526,5,B006IRQU5S,"In short. It's fun, new, fast, different, hard but not impossible. Jillian is effective, but she doesn't get a chance to talk to much since the video moves so fast.  I am sure those of you who find her voice annoying will like that fact. The workouts are smart and there is no wasted time. I recommend this dvd as a great addition to any fitness library. The last thing I love about it is that you can make these workouts stand alones or you can add them to other dvd's as a bonus. I have been using this to add cardio to her Body Revolution program.",1331683200,,550,4.140186915887851
4991527,5,B006IRQU5S,"I am pretty fit and I still felt worked over after these workouts even though they are only 20 minutes. Jillian never lets you rest the entire time and I like that the workouts force you use your entire body. I also like that this dvd is all about a quick calorie burn. Not 45 minutes to an hour of strength. I have those workouts and this one is really different which is nice. It's the best kickbox workout I have tried to date. I did turbo fire and it was to long and too crazy. I like tae bo, but it's too dated. Jillian gets it just right with this one and anyone can do it.",1331683200,,579,3.9572649572649574
4991528,5,B006IRQU5S,"I ordered this before it was even released, and did it for the first time this morning. I own many, many Jillian videos, and this one absolutely did not disappoint me! It is a great cardio video. Be aware, if you want to really sweat, you will need to do 2 or 3 workouts. They are only 20 minutes, so it was so easy to just go onto the next one. I could never just do a 20 minute workout; I would not feel like I actually worked out! I did all 3 in a row, but could have stopped after 2 and been happy with my effort. My only criticism is that she has you do a lot of punching and kicking, but she never has you switch sides. So since you go through the cycle twice for many of the moves, I switched sides myself so both sides of my body got to punch and kick equally. Congratulations on another wonderful workout, Jillian!",1331683200,,823,3.993939393939394

The workouts are only 20 minutes each. They are predominantly cardio based, but jillian does make sure to offer strength moves into each workout to make sure we maintain our muscle tone.  The girls behind her are all easy to follow and high energy. The workouts are also really fun. The music is even good in this dvd. My only complaint is that you might struggle to follow the moves the first time you watch. But after I went back and watched her tutorial (which is quick don't worry) and did the dvd two times I had it all down. LOVE IT.",1331683200,,712,4.235294117647059

I like that there are more people behind Jillian in this one. Makes it feel more energetic. I checked my calories and I burned 307 calories in the 20 minutes. Not bad!

4991531,5,B006IRQU5S,"Wow. It's definitely intense, but it's totally doable. It reminds me of a cooler updated hardcore tae bo. Unlike Jillian's other dvd's the three levels aren't progressively more difficult. Instead they strength train different parts of the body in conjunction with the hardcore kick boxing routine. I love the combinations. It took me a few workouts to get the moves down, but after the third time I had it down. Fresh, fun and kick ass.",1331596800,,437,4.84
4991572,5,B006IRQU5S,"I love that it's different to anything Jillian has done. It's only 20 minutes per workout. It's definitely ""fast and furious"", but she gives a tutorial separate from the workouts so you can learn the moves ahead of time. I felt really empowered after I did the workout. There are three. I have done 2 of them. I also found this workout to be really fun because it isn't tedious. you have to think about what you are doing and I like that.",1331596800,,438,4.289156626506024
4991573,3,B006IRQU5S,"If you are a big fan of Jillian's and want a little flavor of kickboxing, mixed in with sit-ups, squat jumps, mountain climbers and the like to kick up the cardio you will love this one.  For me, I have to rate it as a three star and I'll tell you why, I would prefer an ALL kickboxing routine, one that gets you in the flow and then adds on pieces until you have a nice long kicking and punching sequence at the end.  You still sweat and get a great workout but without adding the other elements.  To me it just flows better.  I would say that as a daily exerciser I appreciated the intensity, but did add a couple sequences together, because even at a high intensity I really can't stop at 20 minutes, so the first day I did the first sequence and the next day I did two and three together.  That was a good length for me.  The other item I thought could use some improvement was in her cuing the punches.  She only does them for a very short spurt, but normally when I do a kickboxing workout they cue the punches at least a few times so you get in the rhythm.

The workout itself is 3 20 minute workouts, the first concentrating on toning, the second for lower body and the third for your abs.  No doubt you will torch calories, it is just whether you like the boot camp style or not.  I find I sometimes like the intensity but I could live without the drill sergeant attitude, but that is just a personal choice. I would consider these to be intermediate/advanced so if you are a beginner, you should probably try another dvd first.  I have found that Patricia Moreno's kickboxing/yoga fusion was a very well cued video that my husband could follow along with too and that we both got a great workout from.  Also, in the intermediate area would be Guillermo Gomez's dvd's.  His are well cued, and stick to just the kickboxing in the Kickbox Cardio dvd.  If you are looking for more kickboxing and fewer additional exercises that may also be one to look at.

For Jillian fans though or those who would like a variety of moves, this may be just the ticket.  I borrowed this dvd from the library and have decided it was not quite what I was looking for, but I may try it again some time for variety.",1331596800,3,2201,4.242206235011991

4991576,5,B006IRQU5S,"I really like this workout.  I worked up a sweat in a v brief amount of time.  I like how Jillian uses new circuits to work our bodies.  She is fantastic: engaging, warm and fun.  The music, while loud, is inspiring and makes you want to go!

She provides a very good tutorial at the beginning of the video which I urge you to watch before you begin.  I use several of her videos and have found that even I benefited from her how-to lessons.  I have watched the tutorial several times and keep learning.

I have read criticisms that she doesn't offer enough cuing.  With repeat viewing, you won't need it.  I know that on some of her tapes (once I learn the steps), I find myself bored w too much cuing.  These really are pretty easy combinations, once you get the hang of them, and if you are in good condition.  If not, stick with it, and it will come.

Criticisms:

1.  The tall woman w the black ponytail is extremely distracting and annoying.  She whoops and jumps around and I found myself really have to focus to listen to Jillian rather than this other woman.  I am a little surprised that Jillian didn't recognize it as a problem.

2.  Each circuit is comprised of two repeat sequences.  Some of the editing on the circuits is uneven.  I found myself having to compensate.  For instance, on the abs circuits, one circuit sequence includes a double-elbow punching routine, yet its second sequence does not.  On another circuit, in the first sequence, we do donkey kicks on one leg.  In its second sequence, we do both legs.  Strange that no one caught this before the tape was released.

I love this tape.  Am so glad that Jillian is in my life!",1331596800,,1653,4.40531561461794
4991577,2,B006IRQU5S,"I really wanted to like this DVD and was so excited to get it, as I'm a huge Jillian fan who has all of her workout videos. Not the case with this one. It's extremely difficult to pick up the steps even after going through the tutorial. It's like learning dance moves. I gave it a few trys before I gave up and returned it. I spent so much time fumbling over my feet trying to get the correct tap here and a step there that I didn't focus on my workout and burning calories. It's also not as hard and rigorous as her other DVDs. Each level only burns about 150 calories. She only works one side of your body for most of these workouts which seemed odd to me, always starting and using the same side/same leg for every circuit. If you're not an experienced kickboxer or you want a cardio thumping workout do not buy this. Get her Banish Fat Boost Metabolism, 30 Day Shred, or Ripped in 30. It seems like she made this way more intricate than it had to be as far as the steps go.",1331596800,8,977,4.09375

I really feel like I have had a good workout. Having said that, I do all three levels at once, and for me (who is quite fit), I feel like I am sweating and have got alot out of it. I think combining this with other stuff of hers and other workouts, it adds an different cardio workout. I have done it twice now, and really love it. It's cool to do something a bit different and i think if you did the whole DVD 2-3 times a week you would notice a difference. I also think you need to do it a bit to get the movements (I am not a kickboxer) and not very coordinated but I reckon after a few more sessions I'll be able to add weights and make it even more hardcore!

4991579,4,B006IRQU5S,I enjoyed the video. I did workout one and I have to agree with another reviewer about the music being too loud. I had a hard time hearing what she was saying and doing the correct moves because I wasn't sure of what I was hearing. I viewed workout 2 and 3. I gave up on 3 because I was having a difficult time getting the moves down. I am a former martial art student and taboer and I found that frustrating. I need to go back and watch the tutorials. I am not sure if I missed something or of if really wasn't there but I also felt like I was only working out one side of my body so I was attempting to alternate on my own.,1331424000,,625,3.852713178294574

4991581,1,B006IRQU5S,"Under the Amazon pricing box for this DVD, it states the following: ""DVD-R Note: This product is manufactured on demand when ordered from Amazon.com.""  DVD-R's are an inferior product.  DVD-R's pixilate over time making them virtually unwatchable, thus rendering DVD-R's a waste of money.  Thanks to a previous review, I did not waste my money on this DVD-R version and instead purchased the new Jillian Michaels Kickbox FastFix at a local retail outlet.  The Kickbox FastFix workout itself is GREAT, just like other Jillian Michaels workout DVD's.  If you're a fan of Jillian Michaels, then you'll love this new workout as well!  Just remember not to waste your money on a REWRITABLE DVD (aka DVD-R) such as this version.  Instead, purchase this Jillian Michaels workout DVD at a local retail outlet (for example, Target or Best Buy.)  As suggested by another reviewer, you can also buy an iTunes digital copy which will never go bad.  DVD-R's are not worth the money and Amazon should reconsider offering a DVD-R such as this one for full price.

4991592,4,B006IRQU5S,"If you do the entire workout (3 videos) it burns over 600 calories. I just wish it was made into one workout and not 3 separate ones. I love kickboxing so I was very excited about this... glad I purchased it, but nothing over the top great.",1331424000,,240,4.127659574468085
4991593,5,B006IRQU5S,"I pre ordered this DVD and it landed on my doorstep yesterday, I was ssssoooo excited!!! I've anticipating it's release for a long time.  I immediately popped it in and began with the tutorial which is a must if you are not a kick boxing pro.  The only kick boxing I've ever done was the little bit Jillian incorporated into her other DVDs.  I've been dedicated to Jillian for 1 1/2 years using her work outs 5-6 days a week and alternating between the 7 JM exercise dvds I own.  The Kickbox Fast Fix is by far the BEST and is my new favorite.  I have done all three workouts on this dvd and all three are hard, fast, and very intense.  I love that there are more girls in this dvd, it makes the workout fun.  Never thought I would say that about a Jillian Michaels workout! This dvd is an absolute must have!!",1331337600,,810,4.187096774193549
4991594,3,B006IRQU5S,"i got this dvd yesterday and today i did all 3 workouts back to back...and yes, i am starting to feel the soreness. lol. but it's worth it. definitely fast paced, fun and alot of sweating. i'm familiar with jillian's other workouts and i've done kickboxing before years ago so i was really excited about getting this dvd. i have to say i thought some of the girls were a little dramatic. i mean some of the moves weren't that difficult and these chicks are yelling and crying...i was like, really? thank goodness for the mute button. it was nice to see natalie & anita from the 30 day shred dvd but these new chicks they got for this one i wasn't too crazy about. so fake and acting so ""tough"" i would like to see how tough they would've been in jillian's other dvds. i know it's a kickboxing video but save the acting for your next audition. overall i like the workouts. since i prefer to do all 3 workouts back to back, this is something i would do 3 times a week.

*UPDATE May 17th 2012 - i'm not gonna lie but i've become very annoyed with this dvd. i haven't done the workouts as much as i like too. I really wanted to like this dvd but after a while it wasn't very fun to do. the combos were confusing and it was a very uneven workout. and i didn't think it was necessary to have so many girls in this workout. i found them to be very annoying including jillian.",1331337600,2,1368,4.162264150943396
4991595,3,B006IRQU5S,"I consider myself in a high intermediate to advanced level on working out.  I do a lot of workout dvds rather than go to a gym.  The main reason I gave this workout 3 stars is because Jillian does not evenly work out both sides of your body.  She starts every kicking or punching combo with her left side forward.  I would expect her to start on the right when doing the circuit the 2nd time through but she does not.  This means you do a lot of punches or kicks only with 1 side.  Even if she does a front kick with the left and then comes around from behind with a kick from the right, it is not the same motion and should be reversed on the 2nd round.  There were several combos where she did roundhouse kicks only with the front leg and never the back. And uppercut punches were only on the back arm.  This just totally baffles me as to why she does not do both sides.

For those who are more advanced in working out, I think the 20 minute routines are short. I decided to do all 3 together, even though it was kind of annoying that she did not put it in the menu options that way and I had to keep going back to the main menu to get to the next routine, but I did break a sweat by adding a lot of energy to the workout and really pumping up the cardio.  But I felt that she was at times trying to reinvent the wheel with her kicking/punching combos.  I've done a lot of kickboxing videos.  It doesn't have to be so fancy or complicated.  She wastes more time adding little steps in between or trying to mix the kicks and punches in between each other.  Some of them didn't flow together well and I spent too much time trying to get the combo right and not enough time kicking and punching.

I might add it to my rotations every now and then with modifications but my mainstay on kickboxing workouts will still be Cathe Friedrich. Sorry Jillian.",1331337600,2,1849,4.111420612813371
4991596,5,B006IRQU5S,"This DVD contains 3 fast paced and high impact workouts.  Jillian Michaels works with 6 other lean and toned ladies, doing boxing and kicking moves.  The first two workouts are fairly easy to follow, with the third workout containing challenging and more complex moves.  There is also a tutorial.

In all workouts, each exercise is done for about 30 seconds.  Ms. Michael moves fast and you do need some space to move your body and kick your legs.  The workouts got my heart pumping and my body sweating.  Finally, as others have mentioned, both sides of the body are not always worked evenly, (but I think that's normal in regular kickboxing, where one side is more dominant than the other).

Here are the time outlines.

Workout 1 (20:59)
Workout 2 (20:47)
Workout 3 (21:57)
Tutorial  (14:25)

Workout 3 is another kickboxing workout, with a few abdominal exercises.

Here are most of the abs exercises.

Bicycle crunch
Mountain climber
Fast situps
Tuck and sprawl
Back kick (donkey kick)

Workout 3 contains both simple moves and more complex kickboxing moves which  confused me because it contained quite a few steps.  If I could not memorize the moves, I just kicked my legs and jabbed my arms.  For those who want to study the moves or do prep work for the workouts, there is a tutorial.

The Tutorial covers the following topics.

Stance

Jab
Cross
Hook
Upper cut

Front kick or push kick
Round kick
Spinning round kick
Outside crescent kick
Stepping outside crescent kick
Slide-up side kick
Spinning side kick

4991597,5,B006IRQU5S,"O.k. so i did the Level 1 workout and it was fantastic, I'm an advanced ""workouter"" ( inventing words) I had a really good sweat i also added P90X Back and Biceps just for effect!!!! i cant wait to do all 3 levels today.",1331251200,,220,4.0227272727272725
4991598,4,B006IRQU5S,"I'm a huge fan of Jillian Michaels and I have many of her workout DVDs and use most of them in my rotation (along with Jackie Warner).

There really isn't anything new in this DVD that's been done before in previous JM DVDs. There's nothing inherently wrong with that (unless of course you have all the other DVDs). Workouts here are designed to work out different sections of your body instead of having progressively more challenging workouts like other DVDs. The kickboxing moves are pretty fast and may be a bit complicated at first. Jillian and the other trainers jump into the moves without pause but a tutorial in included to help walk you through the moves.

I was hoping for some kind of follow-up to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Biggest-Winner-How-to-Win-by-Losing-Cardio-Kickbox/dp/B000B7PNHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Biggest Winner: How to Win by Losing- Cardio Kickbox</a>&nbsp;which is my favorite pure cardio DVD and helped me trying to keep up my stamina without having to hit the treadmill or jogging trail. This workout has a lot more strength training designed into the workout but will still get your cardio going.

One thing that I found a little annoying which is more common with a lot of JM's DVDs than with Jackie Warner is that some of the moves require a lot of space and jumping (suicides, jump lunges, lunge kicks) which is a con for those of us with bad knees and/or small apartments. I don't think this is a severe issue as long as you know your limit.

I love Jillian Michaels and think that she's pretty inspiring so I don't mind a new workout with her (even if it's not that new). Overall, I'm pleased to add it to my collection but if you have an extensive workout DVD collection like I do this one probably isn't necessary. If you do end up purchasing it, it's good for a quick and intense workout for those days when your schedule is tight. If you're looking for a pure intense cardio workout to really get that heart pumping, this DVD probably isn't it.",1331164800,8,2047,4.941860465116279
4991599,5,B006IRQU5S,She just never disappoints!!!  Each workout is 20 minutes with warm up and cooldown and I burn on average of around 300 calories and I am average sized!  I have only had this for two days and only did first two workouts but after the first workout I knew this was worth every penny!!!  If you are a Jillian fan or love a workout that maximizes the calorie burn in minimal time...you need to buy!,1331164800,,395,4.24
4991600,5,B006IRQU5S,"I have all the Jillian Michaels DVDs and this one was awesome like the rest of them.

It literally is a 20 minute workout (not 24 minutes, like Ripped in 30, which I highly reccomend.

Very fast paced so if you never kickboxed before DO THE TUTORIAL.

Jillian makes all 3 workouts both strenght/cardio, and the DVD really goes by quick. Jillian and the girls are entertaining so you won't get boared.(and the moves are fun aswell)If you have her ""Body Revolution"" workout system you will see all the girls from that series on this DVD.

The 3 workouts are all at the same level. They are not called ""level 1"", ""level 2"" and ""level 3"", there simply just ""workout 1"", ""workout 2"" and ""workout 3"".

If you are a very busy person these workouts are for you! I do 2 of them a day, but only because I'm a high school student so I don't have kids or a job to spend my time on.

I'm 102lbs and burnt 150 calories in 20 minutes!

Overall, this is a great DVD and I highly reccomend it.

However, this is not my favourite DVD or hers. My favourites include: Ripped in 30(24 minutes), No More Trouble Zones (40 minutes) and Shred It with Weight(30 minutes).

Buy this DVD and you WON'T be disappointed!",1331164800,4,1191,4.328828828828829
4991601,5,B006IRQU5S,"I looooooove kickboxing.  I went to a class 1-2 times a week for a few years before I had kids and it was one of my favorite parts of the week.  This is the only DVD I've found that is close to what a class was, even if it's abbreviated.  I did levels 1 and 2 back to back this morning and was dripping sweat at the end of level 1.  I think I'm just a glutton for punishment.  I have a very small frame and am an intermediate-advanced exerciser 5-6 days per week (mostly interval training, fusion, etc) and my HRM measured 309 calories burned total after both levels.  YOU'RE GOING TO WORK.  That being said, one of the reasons that I thought this DVD was so great is because you never stop moving - no time to get bored, no lag time, etc.  One of the things that makes these quick transitions possible is that she doesn't break down the moves or define the kicks or punches during the workout.  If you're not super-familiar with each type of kick or punch by name, you're going to have to watch the tutorial at the beginning or you will get frustrated.  I have quite a few of her DVDs loved the fact that she had more girls in the background for this DVD - it made it feel more like a class setting, there was a higher energy level, and you could easily see that not everyone performs the moves exactly the same way.  This one is definitely going in the regular rotation - I'll be doing it at least once weekly.  A great workout for someone who's ready to sweat and take out some aggression!",1331078400,8,1492,4.178321678321678
