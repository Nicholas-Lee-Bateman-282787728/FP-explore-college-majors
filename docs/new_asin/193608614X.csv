7801994,5,193608614X,"Another excellent episode of Adventures from the Book of Virtues.  I just think that parents should be aware that the story about Ulysses and the Cyclops, has the cyclops devouring some of Ulysses' men.  Though it's not graphic and is, of course, true to the original tale, my son became very upset when we watched it.  I'm not writing this as a complaint about the episode or series, just to warn other parents of young or sensitive children who might react the same way.  Otherwise it is a fine episode.",1486080000,,505,4.5777777777777775
