8107945,5,B000E9X3AQ,My daughter just loves this DVD! Paige is so adorable and the DVD is so much fun for my daughter and her friends! The Paige's Workout Party series is just wonderful and the dances are so much fun!,1242777600,,196,4.184210526315789
8107946,1,B000E9X3AQ,"I completely agree with the other reviews I saw after I bought this DVD.  My poor daughter was so disappointed!  it is absolutely impossible to follow if you have no background and, my daughter said it best when she said ""what is she doing? It's weird"".  The five minutes of watching Paige do her thing were awkward.",1236902400,,316,4.508771929824562
8107947,2,B000E9X3AQ,I read all the other reviews and most of the comments were that the workouts were too hard and they were right. My daughter only used the dvd once.,1229731200,,147,4.103448275862069
8107948,2,B000E9X3AQ,"The menu gives only the workout & Bonus. I didn't check out the bonus, you'll see why. There are no chapter choices.
The production values were good, good lighting, good stage, good editing & camera work & sound. They even tried their best to make Paige look good by editing her dance withe her changing outfits mid dance & moving camera back & forth.
Starts with Paige showing off her dance moves. At first I wasn't sure if that was the routine or not since she she moved slower & stiffer then how the dance moves are usually executed. Pagie's dance ability would be above average at a local club, but she does not have enough talent, fluidity, grace, enthusiasm, style or coordination to teach anyone how to dance. She reduced any great moves to a lame simplified core. Hence thinking she was showing modified version that you will learn. I was wrong, that was her at her best.
It then has about 2 min of her drawing on paper with her 2 guy & 2 girl ""friends"" her age & some stiff acting with some young kids asking what they are doing. ""Were about to dance... we have a lot of work to do....""
The teaching (if you call it that) is very quick. ""Ok, stand like that, now strike 3 poses..."" (Prearranged old school stage posing) ""Like this?"" ""Perfect, next..."" She then shows 20!!!!! moves in 7/8 time at ONCE. ""Ok, stand, jump out, jump in, step out & in, strike a pose, girls only nod your head & shoulder, boys stay, step kick, side up, walk in a circle, jump back...."" She was barely slower teaching then she was dancing her normal speed. You then do it 1x w/music... learn another 20! steps at once, do it 1x with music, learn another several steps & then do the WHOLE routine from the top about....5x? then they get all dressed up like they're on stage & do it all again about 10x. That's it.
The song is bubblegum pop cute, you dance to the chorus over & over & over.....
There were some great moves, but they way she (the other dancers has the same amount of talent) did it, she took all the coolness out of it. She obviously has had professional dance instruction, she called out some ballet French names & she does call out ALL of the dance moves with great timing when doing the dance. She just has no style or much grace or spirit or love for dance. Or understands you can't just show something once in almost true tempo time & expect a person to know how to move their feet.
This dvd was only 16 min INCLUDING her showing off in the beginning, the (what seemed like) 2 min of her drawing with friends & bad acting & credits.",1182729600,6,2537,4.309623430962343
8107949,1,B000E9X3AQ,This DVD was very disappointing.  All you see is Paige flitting around with her friends.  Her demonstration of dance steps is horrible.  She only gives instructions once and you put it together immediately making it nearly impossible to catch on unless you are a professional hip hop dancer and already know most of these moves.  I would never buy another of her DVD's.,1170806400,4,369,4.809523809523809
8107950,3,B000E9X3AQ,"My 9 year old daughter begged me to buy this DVD for her.  Although potentially enjoyable, the moves are difficult and even I had trouble following along.......",1168300800,8,160,4.925925925925926
8107951,1,B000E9X3AQ,This video lasted about 15 minutes and featured one very-hard-to-follow dance. Do not waste your money. I am very disappointed that I bought this for my daughter.,1167264000,7,162,5.037037037037037
8107952,5,B000E9X3AQ,Great DVD! My daughter loves all the DVD's in the Paige's Workout Party series and Paige's Workout Party...Let's Hip-Hop brings the child into another great story and another great dance routine. Paige is a really GREAT role model for kids and teens...and she is just CAPTIVATING! Even my two year old loves to follow along! These DVD's are really great for building self-esteem!...,1141344000,10,382,5.079365079365079
