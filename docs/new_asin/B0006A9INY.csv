2180026,5,B0006A9INY,"This type of story is a difficult one to pull off, but this movie does it.  Not a dull moment.  Things keep changing all the time.  The emotional tension remains tight all the way through, yet the movie never becomes oppressive.  There are a number of relieving moments of achievement, of aid from other people, of being befriended by strangers.  The characters, especially the father, are all realistic.  No stereotypes here.  The father is a real horror.  Unfortunately, such people are not only real but not uncommon.

Rick Shroeder does an excellent job with the acting and with the Georgia accent.  Not a trace of his natural southern California accent comes through in any of the scenes.

Good movie for the whole family.  Worth watching again.",1182038400,45,750,4.865079365079365
2180027,5,B0006A9INY,"WONDERFUL movie starring Ricky Shroeder about an older brother trying desperately to hold his siblings together as a family, despite an alcoholic father who tries to defeat him at every turn, and greedy people who try to take advantage of his good fortune when things start to turn around. Ricky portrays an older teen with just the right mix of confidence, confusion, exhaustion and frustration. He definitely makes you believe in the character.",1178409600,65,446,5.123287671232877

2180040,3,B0006A9INY,"A Son's Promise is the touching, true story of an iron-willed Georgia boy who accepts the burden of a man on his young shoulders. Fifteen-year-old Terry O'Kelly (Rick Schroder) is fatherless, and his remaining parent, his mother, is dying.

Anguished, the soon-to-be orphan makes a surprisingly grown-up decision: Terry promises to care for his six brothers and vows to keep the family together - no matter what. Steadfast to his word, Terry takes on the struggles of parenthood, which yields some difficult and unpleasant surprises. But when the family suffers a series of grim misfortunes, including: starvation, deprivation, and natural disaster, Terry's will is tested to the limits until he reaches his breaking point.

Tempted to just walk away from it all, will Terry break his vow, or will he continue to fight against all odds and keep his family together as promised?",1392163200,,877,5.125874125874126

2180060,5,B0006A9INY,I saw this movie when it first came out on TV and it was the best back then and even to this day I still watch it. And at some points thru the movie I still tear up. Ricky Schroder is and has always been one of my favorite actors. and in my opinion has done a wonderful job on this one has well. It is a very touching moving about a young teenager in Georgia that is trying his best to keep his brothers all together and the hardships he faces.

2180062,4,B0006A9INY,"THE MOVIE WAS WORTH BUYING. GREW UP WATCHING RICKY SHROEDER ON SILVER SPOONS. NEVER DID LIKE HIS CO-STAR ALFONSO THOUGH. ALWAYS THOUGHT HE WAS HIGHER UP THE SOCIAL LADDER THAN THE CHARACTER SHROEDER PLAYED. REFUSED TO WATCH HIM IN HIS LATEST ENDEAVOR WHERE HE PLAYS THE COP.  DID LIKE HIM IN THIS MOVIE THOUGH. TOO MUCH RESPONSIBILITY ON RAISING HIS FAMILY. KEPT FINDING HURDLES IN THE ROAD. TOO MANY HURDLES IS YOU ASK ME. SURPRISINGLY, THE BROTHER JUST UNDER HIM IN AGE, HAD LESS OF A PART THAN THE NEXT BROTHER IN LINE. GOOD STORY THOUGH.",1338163200,,541,4.635416666666667

2180065,5,B0006A9INY,"If you want to watch a real down-to-earth-movie this is worth the time. Well-acted by an older
Rick Schroeder and well-written. The ending is uplifting. Recommended. CharleyB",1299024000,,174,5.481481481481482

2180067,5,B0006A9INY,I have always thought Ricky Shroeder was a great star and this movie just adds to his greatness in my mind.  As an older brother he was determined to keep his promise to his dying mother to keep his siblings together.  Feeling he had failed at times did not stop him from pushing forward to accomplish his goal. The odds against him were great but he made you believe in the boy and his fight. I would recommend this highly and I have watched it over and over again.  He also did a great job of acting with Brad Pitts in Across the Tracks another great movie about brothers.,1219622400,11,574,4.247706422018348
2180068,3,B0006A9INY,"As I watched this rather predictable movie, I realized I saw it when it
first played on TV.  It is about a teenage son (Rick Schroeder) trying
to keep his siblings together after his mother dies, and his father has
never been a stable influence or presence.  Done competently if formulaic
and based on a true story, it holds the viewers interest, if the subject
matter is relevant to you.",1202428800,4,388,4.5285714285714285
