3531818,5,B001DJ7PR8,"While I wouldn't place this film in the highest echelon of cinematic masterpieces, it is extremely enjoyable and well written.  Though not funny in a ha-ha sense, it is consistently witty and had me and my friend chuckling at almost every line.  The Barcelona setting and the physical attributes and charisma of the cast are fully exploited to make the film a visual feast.  And, if you ever fell in love while spending a summer abroad as a student, it will pack plenty of nostalgic resonance.",1219795200,3,493,4.709302325581396
3531819,4,B001DJ7PR8,"It's been a LONG time since Woody Allen gave us a film that was truly meaningful and had something ""deep"" to say about life, love and the human condition.  My favorite is HANNAH AND HER SISTERS, but CRIMES & MISDEMEANORS and HUSBANDS & WIVES (with Sydney Pollack's and Judy Davis' greatest performances) are Allen's most recent classics.  Since that time, almost everyone would agree that his work has been pretty mediocre.  In recent years, MATCH POINT saw Allen moving to London and the change in locale seemed to energize him into making his most ""un-Woody"" film in ages and a darn good psychological crime thriller at that.  But SCOOP and CASSANDRA'S DREAM (also London based), offered rapidly diminishing returns.  So Allen has moved to Barcelona, Spain with VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA, and once again, the rewards of this new location have jazzed up the Allen formula.  However, the film still fails to reward on a philosophical level.  It is a surface level delight, with a wry irony about the human condition.

In brief, the story starts with two rich, bored American girls coming to Barcelona for a summer.  Vicky (Rebecca Hall) is engaged to marry a nice, safe, boring stockbroker type...a man who is mostly interested in picking their perfect home in the perfect NYC bedroom community.  Her friend Cristina (Scarlett Johansen) is more a free spirit.  She scorns the idea of settling down.  Early in their visit, they meet  Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), a somewhat well-known artist.  He's something of a lady's man, and he brazenly invites them to come to his country villa for a few days, where they will see beautiful sights, drink nice wine and make love.  This is after he's known them for 30 seconds.  Vicky basically tells him to bug off, but Cristina accepts, and Vicky finds herself going along, ostensibly so that she can keep an eye on Johanssen.

I'm sure you won't be surprised to hear that ""romantic"" (or at least sexual) entanglements follow.  They are made far more interesting with the return of Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz), Juan Antonio's ex-wife.  To say that she is a ""fiery"" personality is putting it mildly.  She is looney tunes...but also very artistic, sensual and intuitive.  She and her ex have one of those relationships where one is the moth and the other the flame...they constantly burn each other yet instinctively they can't avoid each other.

I've tried to reveal little of what actually HAPPENS in the film, because part of the fun is to kind of guess who will fall into bed with whom and when and why.  Suffice it to say that this is all frothy fun.  While the characters endure some pretty gut-wrenching, soul-searching times...for the viewer there is nothing to take terribly seriously.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing...but it's what puts this film just below ""classic Woody"" status.  It's a vigorous and fun film...looser than his movies have been in awhile.  But perhaps it's the Spanish flavor that has made it all seem a bit trivial.  The characters are all impossibly witty (when AREN'T they in an Allen film?) and there is also a narrator (and this device, of course, makes it a little tough to get drawn in deeply).

But the good outweighs the bad, for certain.  Allen's script is VERY fast-moving and really pretty darn funny.  His characters are all fairly likeable and there are ample opportunities for all four lead characters to shine.  To me, Rebecca Hall was the eye-opener.  She is pretty much unknown to me, and I don't know how or why Allen cast her...but he had a pretty good eye with this one.  She reminded me of Frances O'Connor (another obscure name, I know...but perhaps a little less so to some).  She's strikingly intelligent and she plays her character with a believable mixture of reserve and vulnerability.  When unexpected deep feelings hit her, she is ""unmoored"" from her image of herself, and it's fun to watch her grow and change.  It's also GREAT fun to see her in the last scene of the movie...the point she arrives at in the end is the closest Allen comes to poignancy in this film.  Javier Bardem is very charismatic.  His character is barely more than a caricature (a hot-blooded Spanish artist with amazing skills in seduction!)...but Bardem makes us believe that Juan Antonio really is this person.  But what Bardem also does is show that while Juan Antonio wants to seem deep and warm and intuitive...he is really quite shallow and ineffective.  Also, if the last time you saw Bardem was as Anton Chigurh in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN...you'll be amazed at  how very, very different this guy is.  Penelope Cruz has been receiving a lot of accolades, and she is certainly a character who truly stirs the pot when she arrives.  To me, the part is the most underwritten of the four, and thus a little less successful.  However, I don't blame Cruz...she really pulls off the almost manic/depressive personality of Maria Elena with great energy.  It is Scarlett Johanssen who comes off the worst here.  I'm not a  huge fan of hers to start with...she can be a remarkably still and self-possessed actress...but I actually find her stillness not so much representing an inner life, but to show dullness.  I'm sure Scarlett is sharp as a tack and probably great fun in real life...but her acting, very effective in roles like GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING, leaves her feeling stiff and unconvincing in parts like in VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA that call for vivacity and some raw sensuality.  She is a contrast to the other women on the screen...but it's not really a contrast between fire and ice.  It's a contrast between fire and another fire that has been doused with water and is now just a burnt-out ember.

If you've never liked Allen's movies before (and I know many people who can't abide him)...I feel there's a chance you might actually enjoy this one.  Except for the VERY Allen-like voice of the narrator, the Spanish setting creates a warmer, more colorful tone than we've seen in awhile.  If you're a fan of Allen, then I believe this is a must-see.",1219190400,4,6035,4.779710144927536
3531820,5,B001DJ7PR8,"It was probably after Bullets Over Broadway (1994) that I became weary of Woody Allen's films and avoided those that followed. Then, while reading various reviews of recently released films, I was encouraged to see Vicky Cristina Barcelona and thoroughly enjoyed it. Apparently content to write its screenplay and then direct it without appearing in it,  Allen's unique influence continues to be significant but inconspicuous as he allows his characters and plot to develop naturally. Here's the situation. Two young and attractive American women, Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johannson), arrive in Barcelona to spend much of the summer with Vicky's older friends, Judy and Mark Nash (Patricia Clarkson and Kevin Dunn). For reasons best revealed in the film, they become involved with a local artist, Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem),  and develop separate, quite different relationships with him.

Several complications gradually and sometimes suddenly occur. For example, Vicky is engaged to Doug (Chris Messina) back in the U.S. who impulsively decides to visit her in Barcelona and marry her immediately in a civil ceremony there, to be followed by a lavish wedding later in the year. He represents everything that the analytical and grounded Vicky repeatedly claims she wants (i.e. wealth, status, stability, security). However, he lacks the passion and sensitivity that she has found irresistible in Juan Antonio. In stunning contrast, Cristina is a free spirit, ""up for anything,"" who also finds the artist irresistible and eagerly moves in with him, to Vicky's predictable dismay. Meanwhile, Judy Nash confides to Vicky that there is no love in her marriage and urges Vicky to follow her heart, not her carefully calculated life plan. Nonetheless, Vicky marries Doug soon after he appears and they remain in Barcelona for awhile.

Unexpectedly, Juan Antonio's former wife whom he still loves, Maria Elena (Penlope Cruz), appears.  In fact, after her failed suicide attempt, Juan Antonio insists that she move back into the home they once shared and live with him and Cristina until she (Maria Elena) recovers. He loves all three women and they love him. It would be a disservice to those who have not as yet seen the film to reveal more plot details in this review of it.

I think this is Allen's most coherent and engaging film since Hannah and Her Sisters (1986). His direction is crisp and sure, the dialogue is appropriate to various situations (e.g. there is an almost total absence of Allenesque quips), and the performances by the lead actors are outstanding. It is impossible for me to take my  eyes off Cruz whenever she is onscreen. Given her pyrotechnical personality, she is capable of literally anything. Clarkson does the best she can with her role as Judy Nash, one that allows her few opportunities to display her talents. (The same is true of her role in The Untouchables as Catherine Ness.) As for Bardem, he transcends the stereotype of a ""Latin Lover."" Heaven knows his Juan Antonio is charming but he is also a caring person who is completely truthful with others. (Note the direct approach he takes in his first encounter with the Vicky and Cristy who can't take their eyes off him in a restaurant  after first seeing him in an art gallery earlier.) He challenges other characters to examine their values and, perhaps, trust their feelings more than they would otherwise be willing to do. Also, credit Javier Aquirresarobe with superb cinematography. When portraying life in Barcelona and (briefly) in Oviedo, he and Allen provide a visual feast of gourmet images.

I also appreciate the fact that questions remain as the film ends. Will Vicky experience the same disillusionment that Judy has? Will Cristina finally find what she wants in life, having experimented with and then eliminated so much that she doesn't? Will Juan Antonio and Maria Elena ever be able to accept each other (as is) as they love each other?

3531821,5,B001DJ7PR8,"But honestly, it was one hot fantasy... and a great movie besides.  Now about his allegations of sexual abuse.  Probably true.  It happened a long time ago.  Does that make it okay?  No.  Does it mean that he should just die in the street and that no one should pay him any mind?  I'm conflicted.  Assuming it even happened, a person can make a mistake and move on.  This is heavy stuff to think about.  I don't know the right answer.  Most of us have done something wrong at some time.  But if you were watching this for the first time without any previous knowledge of Woody Allen in any way, you'd probably think this was a very well done movie.",1512777600,,648,4.264462809917355

3531942,2,B001DJ7PR8,"The pluses: The film is lushly shot in a beautiful Spain.  The vistas are unparalleled and Barcelona I doubt has ever looked this good.  The acting is competent, and the roles are fleshed out adequately.

The minuses: What's the point here?  Vicky and Cristina are both attracted to the same man, and they each have him in different ways, and at different times.  So there's little plot.  Other than the four lead roles, the other actors are really cameos.  It's vintage Allen; the dialog seems lifted from one of his films years ago.  You can tell that Allen wrote the film, because his style is imposed on the actors, and they spout off dialog that doesn't fit with their characters.  Allen is now too old to play these types of roles, but he obviously hasn't moved on from his 40s.  It's the same verbiage, coming out of other people's mouths.

Really, Woody, it's time to move on.  Can't you do better than to take a few characters from 'Annie Hall', dumb them down, move them to Spain, and go from there?",1434758400,,1009,4.513812154696133

3531944,1,B001DJ7PR8,"Woody Allen makes the nth version of the movie he's been making since before Annie Hall.  How does he persuade actors to play his alter-ego time after time.  Some scenes are quite obviously Allen's masturbatory fantasies.  But most egregious is setting a movie in Barcelona with Catalan themes important to the development of various characters and the movie and totally conflating it with Spain and Spanish culture. If you are studying Catalan identity, you don't attend Spanish lessons, or write poetry in Spanish,. Disrespecting culture is not funny, just ignorant.",1434412800,3,568,5.288888888888889

I recommend to anyone who loves Scarlett as much as I do to check her out in the incredible film Match Point also written by Woody Allen where he is not in it; Match Point is an amazing thriller and Scarlett is incredible in it.

3531982,4,B001DJ7PR8,"I'm a huge Woody Allen fan, and I agree that this film isn't his finest. That being said, I think it's a good film--with great acting--that explores the paradox of love. On the one hand, one can have a stable and enduring, yet ultimately dispassionate, relationship. On the other, one can seek out passionate and volatile relationships that can only last so long. While the two main characters, Vicky and Cristina, illustrate this disparity (Vicky choosing the stable and enduring relationship in lieu of her heart's passion, and Cristina choosing tempestuous relationships that end as quickly as they began), the suave artist Juan Antonio and his ex-wife illustrate a possible--if not fleeting--balance between these two disparate states. With the aid of Cristina, the couple rekindles their passionate relationship, bolstered by stability, through a threesome of minds and bodies. Yet even when this balance is seemingly achieved, the perfect harmony is only transitory.

The theme of this film reminds me of the Beach in some respects. Both films explore the desire for perfection, as well as its ultimate elusiveness. Even when the perfect state is seemingly achieved, it can only be maintained for a brief moment. If you like Woody Allen films, you may also like this. But if you liked the Beach, you may love this movie.",1428019200,,1326,5.110599078341014

It was like Woody Allen had lunch with Wes Anderson to discuss a movie and this was the result.  Those are two of my favorite directors.  I especially identified with the idea that relationships can include whatever situation the people involved desire and not just romantic relationships either.  Friendships too.

And then there is Penelope Cruz.  Such a forceful actress in anything I have seen her in.  She is also one of the few that makes you feel like you could actually fall in love with her.

I also wanted to mention that this would make a great double feature with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fading-Gigolo-Blu-ray/dp/B00JLDT9OA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fading Gigolo [Blu-ray</a>]"".

3531998,4,B001DJ7PR8,"""An American foreign"" film capturing, not a story line over time, but temporal romances, sexual habits of people built over a lifetime, acted out neurotically. This film reminds me of the Pices twin fishes. One blond, one brunette, the other brunetter is the mirror image of the first brunette who cannot do as she wishes sexually, so the 2nd brunette ""The bat-shit crazy chick,the stick of dynamite that explodes with sexual intensity"" fills in for her. The Pices fish swim counterintuitively, intuitively, either leaving a relationship, or staying in one they want to leave but, conflicted, don't. This isn't a story, or is the oldest story. Acted idiosyncratically, this film captures the very essence of human sexual confusion, restiveness, monogamy in the style of the French foreign films. I always knew Woody Allen's mind worked in a foreign manner, and this film cracks Allen's skull open again to reveal another twisted,section of his cortex, the gray areas of human morality, sexuality, joy and misery. Not a spectacular achievement, but Allen's writing, acting and directing set the bar so very high and he's bound to miss a leap every so often. This film is worth seeing, just don't expect a brilliant film. Expect to see yourself, your spouse, your parents, your teenagers crisscrossing the territory of desire and ambivalence.",1426982400,8,1340,5.151376146788991

Woody is an expert at exploring relationships, and he nailed it with this movie. He has the characters saying exactly what they are thinking, which is not the usual these days, as most people do not know how to describe their true feelings.  Woody Allen has a real talent for expression.  The camera work was excellent, and the setting gorgeous, as I have been to Barcelona myself, and it is as beautiful in real life as it was in the movie. Highly recommended, if you want a movie that is honest, TASTEFULLY sensual, and beautiful location. Guess it's more a ""chick movie"", but my husband loved it too.",1425945600,,722,4.398496240601504

3532017,5,B001DJ7PR8,"Vicky Cristina Barcelona

Finally we have a winner after several dreary weeks.  Vicky Cristina Barcelona is an acting tour de force.
 Woody Allen wrote and directed this film.  The first half hour or so could just as well have been done with Woody reading the script with the actors moving around, but mute. We all read Albert Camus in high school.  Woody just never got over it.  For him life sucks and then you die.  Once you get past this nihilistic gloom and just watch the actors going through their paces, the move comes alive.
 Javier Bardem plays a Spanish painter with Woodys philosophy put in his mouth.  He is the antithesis of Woody Allen. Where Woody is all hand wringing and neurosis, the painter plans to put every scrap of joy, beauty, love and excitement into what he believes to be a pointless and finally doomed existence.
 In pursuit of his goal of living life to his very fingertips, he romances three beautiful women in the course of two short months.  These are not just cheep one night stands, but three, apparently-the painter may just be a fraud, though he seems sincere enough in his philosophy -emotionally charged interludes with the possibility of genuine love in each of them.
 The acting is wonderful.  Bardem is handsome, compelling and soulful.  Rebecca Hall, who has the smallest of the three leading lady roles, has one scene that is a carefully faceted gem.  Scarlett Johansson is not just spectacularly beautiful but also an actress who can deftly handle a character that would be reduced to caricature in other hands.
 But Penelope Cruz is the star.  She plays the painters ex-wife who is passionate, brilliant, exciting, crazy and occasionally homicidal.  Hers is truly a Brava performance.
 This terrific movie is rated PG13 for adult themes.  It runs one hour 49 minutes.  It should handily return the $20 million budget to make it.  Four saw blades.",1425772800,,1892,4.8105590062111805

It is about 3 love affairs: a man, his wife, and two young women. Despite being still married (his ex considers herself still his wife), the man invites the young women to stay in his home outside Barcelona (his wife is away) and proceeds to have affairs with first one and then the other of the young women. At times I found myself wondering if all of the characters were just idiots. In the end I decided they were all just very self centered and willing to believe whatever it took to justify what they wanted to do.

3532050,5,B001DJ7PR8,"Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a romantic comedy/drama that centers on two American women,Vicky and Cristina while on vacation in Barcelona. It was written and directed by Woody Allen.

The story starts as two American friends, the cerebral and somewhat uptight Vicky and the heedless and free-spirited Cristina arrive in Barcelona to spend the summer. They stay with friends of Vicky's family she can further her work as a grad student in Catalan cultural studies. While Cristina goes there to pursue an interest in photography. Because they are young and beautiful and artistically inclined, it is only a matter of time before they run across Juan Antonio, a hunky artist who is still enamored of his mentally and emotionally unstable ex-wife Mara Elena. Cristina is smitten. Vicky is not for she is engaged. The three depart anyway on a spontaneous weekend journey to the scenic town of Oviedo. Sex happens and that complications ensue. Soon after they return to Barcelona, Cristina is ensconced in Juan Antonio's house and Vicky is awaiting the arrival of his beau, who thinks it might be romantic to get married in Spain, to try out the show in the provinces before opening for family and friends in New York. Then Maria Elena appears on the scene, penniless and in emotional upheaval. Though their marriage ended when she literally stabbed him in the back, Juan Antonio feels obliged to take her in. And Cristina goes along with the new arrangement.

This is one of the best Woody Allen movie in years. It has great dialogue. It is refreshing to have pretty people who say witty and sometimes interesting things. Besides Allen's amazing dialogue, he also had the most perfect musical score and some great ideas on how to shoot certain scenes. Also worth mentioning that this movie was shot on location in Spain that provided the film a beautiful cinematography. The acting is also commendable. Penelope Cruz is definitely superb as Maria Elena by elevating what could be stereotypical role into indelible characters. Obviously,her Oscar for Best Supporting Actress is a testament to that. Overall,it was definitely one of the most enjoyable and best films during its time of release.",1420588800,,2186,5.019283746556474

3532058,2,B001DJ7PR8,"The evocative musical landscape found in Woody Allens neo-erotic comedy Vicky Cristina Barcelona probably provides as much mood lifting magic and charm as the splendid postcard sites of Cataluas capitol.  Barcelona and not Madrid serves as Spains center for pornographic films, but this known fact has remote relevance to the Woody Allen universe.  Foreign music drives the action if not the philosophy of the Vicky Cristina Barcelona and that observation saves the story.  The presence of brisk, acoustic guitar sets numerous scenes, transitions, and signifies time and again the ironic cultural journey of the two beautiful and susceptible American women who have certain romantic needs to visit a comfortable, Latin nation during summer.  The summer of love was once a state of mind for the recent college graduate and the young age quickly in Vicky Cristina Barcelona.  The whole is not necessarily greater than the sum of its parts for this junket of three improbable love triangles.  Far worse, the whole can be insufferable.
Allens mise-en-scne of flirtatious moments, Mediterranean sun, and classical guitar strike more successfully than spoken word, mannered behavior, and conscious plotting.  After several viewings, Allens buoyant, libidinous film seems to be fighting with its dour, overwritten screenplay.  Allen as auteur probes his familiar theme of illicit intimacy with the impossibility of sustained intimacies.  Clearly, Allen is introducing an idea of innocent cultural trespass as a rite of passage for two young souls looking to escape from the mundane of their lives and of their sterile American culture.  His film rewards neither Vicky nor Cristina for their respective escapades by the final credits and he may be doing this perhaps to offset his personal ennui as an American and to please his own waning sexual whimsy.  Happily, the overplayed Woody Allen character in his oevre is not present in Vicky Cristina Barcelona although we hear his characters diction and precise rationalisms in the fluid responses from Vicky to the madcap propositions aimed at her.  The Allen motif of lusts temptation would be naked without the power of music.  The essential idea in this movie can be found in the acrid residue of each womans memory of abstract painter Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) and Juan Antonios absurd plane ride to the small village Oviedo.  Juan Antonio trespasses with wild abandon to feed his sexual appetite for a menage-a-trois while the two American women cross a quirky, moral demarcation aboard the ill-considered flight.  A smaller, less safe prop plane does not exist in all of the Iberian Peninsula.",1419897600,,2643,5.274463007159905

That said, I considered the plot very weak besides a glamorous scenery and an escapist bent. It's great to see (some) people are not living paycheck to paycheck and can just go for a holiday for two months with short stints to various cities and countries. True, travel within Europe is not expensive....

The character of Judy was interesting but the painter guy was too one-dimensional (well, perhaps based on a real person, lol); interested only in having a warm body in his bed. I did not find his relationship with his ex-wife believable, not because they gravitated towards each other and he took care of her but because he was supposedly showing concern for the other women, as well.

Scarlett Johansson'r character was the one that was most true to herself; I can imagine and have known people like that and I can see how her friend was envious of her courage.

This is more of an reflection than a review but many others have described the plot.

The movie was worth watching for the Barcelona song, and I wished more of the views of the city were included since I have never been there.

The open ending was a cop out - I expected better, no matter which way it would go. Maybe Vicki and Cristina could live together and get (another) guy to share, someone unexpected - like Judy's husband :).",1416700800,,1480,4.52808988764045

Other than that, the movie failed to deliver a strong plot or message worth holding a trip to the rest room. Believe me...you were NOT going to miss anything interesting.

Woody after all these years find a subject matter that's not so shallow and narcissistic. The world doesn't revolve around neurotic, selfish people. The bad guys, or at least the ones at the fringes of your story, are always the most dependable, salt of the earth types. While their steady, normal lives aren't as interesting as severely disturbed people, they provide the basis, or at least the actual money, all your quirky characters are able to sponge off to display their insecurities and destructive behavior.",1414627200,,666,5.009009009009009

Two American tourists, one think she knows what she wants, another only knows what she doesn't want. It turns out that the romance is a contradiction and the stretch between freedom and control. No matter how to control one's desire, like Vicky does, or set free ones desire, like Cristina does, the puzzle of love is unsolvable. Should we ignore the moment and regret what we hasn't done? Or should we go with the moment, follow one's heart, and in the end find out this is just the moment? Maybe the solution is laugh about it, makes the pessimistic life turn into a farce.

Great acting and touching music. The crazy Spanish lady is amazing and somehow hilarious. The only problem is the film narration weaken the power of the image and makes it a more illustration of a literature than a reality-illusionist film.

It portrayed the passionate personalities of the Spanish culture vs. the American puritanical views.  I like Scarlett J anyway, so I was drawn to this film.

3532248,2,B001DJ7PR8,Good acting except for Scarlett Johansson.  Hers felt put on rather than coming from within.  My rating is mostly based on the story while sensationalistic was weak in insight and meaning and felt empty.,1403654400,,203,4.9411764705882355

3532253,2,B001DJ7PR8,"So I watched VickyChristinaBarcelona friday night, and I decided to write about what I thought . Warning this post will contain spoilers so if you haven't seen it don't read my review.
So first I have to admit, I knew nothing about the movie and my initial interest in watching was for Chris Messina. With that being said lets talk about the movie. First off I did not know that this movie would be narrated, it was interesting at first but that then grew boring. I don't like people reading to me, because I am a fast reader and prefer to read to myself. That being said its no wonder that I don't like that in my movies either, so the narration quickly became an annoyance that I wish I could tune out. Once I realized this was a movie about cheating, I grew apprehensive and curious to see what the approach would be. In 28hotelrooms, there was also a cheating, affair storyline, but it was done so well, the acting, the little view into pieces of the affair and how realistic the emotions were, that I didn't mind it was about two people cheating, something I highly dislike. With VCB though it was like watching a pretentious telenovela that was trying to present its self as some intellectual, existentialist view of love . As you can probably tell from my previous line, I was not impressed. And the male lead was not attractive at all, some may have been drawn in by the accent, I was not one of those people. At the point of the affair and aftermath I continued to watch the movie solely to capture the small glimpses of Chris Messina. That last scene with the gun was my last straw, and what compelled me to write a review, it was utterly ridiculous and crazy, see my line above about the telenovela. This movie started out promising but at the end fell very flat for me, that being said I give it 2/5 stars and I give Chris Messinas performance 4/5 he did the best with what he got. I also have to say I did love the music, in fact I enjoyed the music and Messinas random appearances more than the actual plot of the movie, this is one movie hes in that I will NOT be rewatching. This is just my honest opinion of the movie, I know many will probably disagree with me, but they are entitled to their own opinions as am I to mine.",1403481600,,2240,4.297872340425532
3532254,3,B001DJ7PR8,I expected more from this piece given the director and actors but the story line never developed into anything beyond a pessimistic look at relationships and people.  Barcelona looked beautiful!,1403222400,,194,5.466666666666667
3532255,4,B001DJ7PR8,"Some plots are thin as air, but great acting more than makes up for it.  Both Javier Bardem and Rebecca Hall are standouts, the other two actresses, Penelope Cruze and Scarlett Johanssen are good, but they tend to ham it up, which after a while gets plain ""BORING""  like same old, same old.

Over all makes you want to spend a Summer in Barcelona and taste the good life.  Great job Woody, Javier and Rebecca!",1403136000,,409,4.413333333333333
3532256,4,B001DJ7PR8,"Love Scarlett Johanssen and her character. Shows the path that different lovers take and how it can all come up as you would least expect, or completely expect.",1403049600,,160,4.75
3532257,1,B001DJ7PR8,"Wow! Woody Allen is really starting to repeat himself here, and he never really had anything to say to begin with. I'd say there is a clear line drawn straight down the middle-if you like Woody Allen, you'll like this movie, if not, you'll hate it. It is very ""Woody Allen,"" in that the movie centers around what? Infidelity. Snore. This has all the pitfalls of a Woody Allen movie: the harmless, obnoxious music and dialogue and the boring plot twists. So many of the scenes are low energy and end with you thinking ""is THAT what this movie is about?"" and then it fails to get any more exciting. You can't believe that the rising dramatic question is whether or not this person will cheat on their spouse, and what will happen if their spouse finds out. The dialogue is also wholly unrealistic and wooden and sadly far too intellectual for real life. It is also incredibly awkward. It is just boring to see Woody Allen be defensive about his intelligence and his fear that he is a phony intellectual. Sadly, Woody Allen made one pretty good movie 40 years ago (""Annie Hall"") and he has now become a legend for putting out 40 years of mediocre drivel. I'm going to try to never see another Woody Allen movie again. Tedious. Frustrating. Boring. Sorry. 1 Star.",1402963200,,1259,4.5506607929515415
3532258,4,B001DJ7PR8,this is a typical W. Allen's movie with lots of funny moments and crazy situations. The acting is great from all three main actors and for the supporting cast. It is perfect to watch for a night alone (as I did) or if you want something light to watch with friends.,1402963200,,265,4.215686274509804
3532259,5,B001DJ7PR8,Lovely movie. One of my favorites. Scarlett is wonderful as always and a gorgeous setting. And a good looking man Javier.,1402963200,,121,4.809523809523809
3532260,5,B001DJ7PR8,"I absolutely hate Woody Allen because I believe he is a sexual predator. I hate to contribute to his success in any way. However, I love this movie so much. There isn't really that much to it, either. Not much of a story, not terribly brilliant dialogue, just sort of nondescript but so memorable. I love the Spanish backdrop and music and the actors. It's a wonderful movie and stays with me for days after I watch it.",1402617600,,419,4.384615384615385
3532271,5,B001DJ7PR8,All these actors are great. I have watched this movie over and over and each time I see something I missed before. Last night I just gave it to my neighbor to watch. I know they will love it too.,1402444800,,195,3.9
3532272,5,B001DJ7PR8,"The story here has plenty of twists and turns, aided by a voice-over narrative that is useful and not intrusive, and the actors are well-cast and convincing in their roles.  What steals the show, for me, is the beautiful filming of Spain, particularly Barcelona and Oviedo--scene after scene perfectly composed.  I've never been to Spain, but this movie really makes it look very inviting.  It's nice to have a Woody Allen movie without the over-the-top comic anxiety that is usually a trademark.  This movie is a good story with a nice point to it about love, life, and finding happiness or not.  The female characters are confident and forthright and nuanced, too.  I wonder if this is something of an homage to Almadovar by Woody Allen.  If so, it's very successful at it.",1402358400,,775,4.7819548872180455

Yes, some good life lessons for the characters, and some lessons for the audience about what's important in life. But other than the hour and half spent watching the characters interact through different situations, there wasn't much point to it. The movie just sort of fizzled out at the end. Maybe that was the point. Maybe it was meant to portray existential pointlessness in life, reflecting that pointlessness in the movie. If so, bravo, Mr. Allen.

I will say, it was enjoyable, entertaining and featured gorgeous locales that inspired me to add ""visit Barcelona"" to my list of dreams.  In true Woody Allen fashion, it was light fare that almost dug deeper, but not quite. I quite enjoyed the narrator and for that reason, it really rambled on much like a short story, where the facts are indisputable but the interpretation is up to you. In the end, all of the grand topics of love, happiness, obsession, friendship and the meaning of life are figuratively shrugged off my the main characters, choosing to live in the present, in their lives and remain perpetually and passively undecided about them all. As does most of the audience. Perhaps there is the dark truth, that most of us will be too afraid to ever leave our bubble and those that do risk disappointment when they realize that there is no real love, passion, alternative satisfaction, just another bubble.

Film is supposed to be a visual experience, and by that I mean that we are supposed to learn the details of the characters and plot through a series of visual images.  There was far too much talking going on in this movie.  The narrator explained, then the characters explained what the narrator had just explained, and then the narrator explained what had just been explained.  With the voice over, there was no need for the actors to act.  There even was narration over the visual montages!  In any normal film, that's all the information you need.  But in this film, there is a narrator telling you what you're looking at.  If Vicky and Christina are eating chocolates, the narrator will tell you, ""They ate chocolates.""  If they're in a plane, the narrator will tell you that they flew somewhere.  There is really no reason to watch this movie at all.  You can just listen to it if you want.

Small, complicated and captivating plot that if you look carefully at is plucked straight from the 70s - Play it Again Sam; Annie Hall, etc.  It's a beautiful piece of recycling and repackaging:  Same dilemmas about love and loyalty and indulgent perplexity about what life is supposed to be about; close your eyes to the splendor of the settling and its the same dialogue even.  But plucked from 70s California or New York and plonked in gorgeous Barcelona and Catalonia where ""all the women are strong (if terribly confused), all the men are good looking, and all the personal wealth is above average - and inexplicably just there in abundance.

I was expecting the focus to be more on Johannson, but her Cristina came across as scattered and somewhat bubble-headed compared to Hall's Vicky who portrayed a woman truly undergoing a rush of both delightful and agonizing emotions in a short period of time. And Woody surprised me with having her still end up with the safe choice. The dual focus of Hall's Vicky (no pun intended) and Bardem/Cruz, who were like a human electrical storm simply overshadowed Johannson--probably not quite what would happen today since Johannson's steady gains in experience and confidence.",1396396800,,650,5.259615384615385

(Just let the narrator deliver the major developments and fill in the rest with ridiculous and unappealing dialogue.) What I saw served as a constant reminder that I was watching the most beautiful and talented of actors performing a script that they should have refused. I have better things to do with my time, but I had to take a time-out to leave this review because Rebecca and Scarlett are amazing and I am so disappointed with this film. They did the best they could with what they had, but again, they should have refused. That is easy to say from my perspective as I am not an aspiring actor, but neither are they. They are actors.

3532457,4,B001DJ7PR8,"Barcelona, with its gloriously rich architecture and European sensibility, is the star of this movie. Woody Allen filmed in only the most beautiful sections of this Spanish city, and in so doing, makes us fall in love with it as well. The story line is a familiar one -- how many of us have been in a beautiful vacation spot and longed to stay there and build a life? While on vacation, a couple of friends, played by  Rebecca Hall (Vicky) and Scarlet Johanssen (Christina) meet the painter Juan Antonio, played by the very sexy Javier Badem. He invites them to join him on a short plane ride to another city. He's very forthright in his invitation: he wants to sleep with them both. Christina agrees, but Vicky, who is engaged, is horrified by the boldness of his request as well as her friend's willingness to run off with a stranger. These characters are two sides of the same person. But it's when Penelope Cruz arrives on the scene that the movie's plot comes alive. Penelope's Oscar is well-deserved. She plays Maria Elena, Juan Antonio's unstable, emotional ex-wife, also an artist. I enjoyed this film, but it's not for everyone. The movie has a narrator, which can be irritating, but seems necessary to explain the settings and to move the plot along. Woody Allen is a romantic whose focus on the beautiful cities of Europe gives us a glimpse into the culture and loveliness of this part of the world. I'm glad I saw this movie. Now I need to go to Barcelona.",1394150400,,1468,4.581749049429658

I seldom have time to watch movies so I try to select those I can carefully. This, to me, is a wonderful movie. The three main actors do a fantastic job, the pace is good, the story line clear and the ambiance seductive ( I am a hopeless romantic). The only thing that is a little odd is the voice over. While it serves its purpose of explaining the plot well it, somehow, seems a little distracting. A minor complaint that is offset by the fact that its presence causes me to reflect upon it.",1394064000,,601,4.234782608695652

It had all of the great director's customary touches: a witty, worldly script; excellent performances all around; beautiful cinematography; and an extraordinary, evocative soundtrack, all in service of a story that was at once poignant and wryly observed. This is another beautiful addition to Woody Allen's non- New York filmography, joining ""To Rome with Love"", ""Midnight in Paris"" and ""Blue Jasmine"" as films that should be seen by any lover of movies and their ability to convey the puzzling vicissitudes of human relationships.",1394064000,,682,5.153153153153153

3532461,1,B001DJ7PR8,"It's hard to say you hate Woody Allen movies.  People think you long for the old days when he was ""funny"", or that you have a problem with his sex life.  I hate his movies for the past 25 years because he has really only made one movie in his life.  Each one is about an annoying neurotic narcissistic whiner nebbish, which is to say, him.  The first ten times or so it was good--funny, interesting.  Manhattan is a great film, in fact.  Making the same movie over and over and over gets pretty tedious.  Hiring other actors to play you again and again after you are forced to admit you are too old is also tedious.  Most Woody impressions in his films are truly awful.  Owen Wilson stands out as being particularly horrifying.
So I forgot this was a Woody Allen movie until it started, and then I thought ""What the hell, let's try another one.""  Javier Bardem is good.  He's already demonstrated that he can even play a demon and bring something enjoyable to the role.  Here, he's the hunky fantasy guy for girls on vacation in a romantic locale.  This is probably as much as you need to know about the plot.  The brunette has the Woody role, by which I mean she starts expressing angst at some point.  She's better (slightly less annoying and/or putrid) than most of the male Woodys over the past couple of decades.
What makes this movie truly awful is the narration, which is constant and pointless.  When a character is taking photographs, he says ""She took many more pictures"".  Thanks.  Whatever slight entertainment value this film may have had is eaten alive by the endless and purposeless narration.  That's what you get when your ""art"" is a never-ending orgy of self-indulgence.",1393977600,,1688,4.566666666666666

In the case of Vicky Cristina Barcelona, while I didn't always like the characters, I think the film had a lot of gritty truth in it, well and artistically expressed.",1393459200,,656,4.487394957983193

The plot, twists and turns of the characters, was a take on a common theme in romantic movies set in European countries such as boy meets girl and boy meets her best friend.  However the course of actions between this triste is made more complicated by a needful ex-wife who won't go away because of the codependent relationship she has with her ex.  Despite his efforts to find love...he only finds sex with other women...who ultimately go away due to the crazy antics of his ex-wife played superbly by Penelope Cruz.

3532495,2,B001DJ7PR8,"Are people in general still aware of ""traditional"" story telling? Does Allen remember how he got here? Is there a moral answer to our human problems? Do right and wrong still exist? Are there good people in the world, even one? By accounts in this movie, ""no, no, no, no, and nope.""
Missing from this film is - Woody Allen; as actor, as writer, as director. I actually missed the fact that this was an Allen film at first; I happened to pause and save; when I came back to it, I stared at his name and then restarted the film - it couldn't be an Allen film; but it was him, only it was not him.
This has ""beautiful"" people in it, doing really ugly things, without any moral compass, satirical or otherwise; this film has no pace, no fuel, no destination, and no resolve; not that those are all necessary, but at least one should be there. This film really is a waste of everything that went into it, in terms of movie-making; it's just another film; it's in color, sometimes they speak English, the women are gorgeous to see, the men handsome, and the sets voluptuous; but the film is as empty as the lives they pretend to reveal. The viewer's perspective is ignored; we are not allowed into this movie.
Watch it for the bling, watch it for the nice sets and pretty faces, and then just forget it; for it is simply failure resolved by failure. If his name were not on it, you never would have guessed Allen had anything to do with it, other than his obsession with whats- her-name. By making it about ""artists,"" he may have felt relieved of justifying/explaining these failed people in their failed lives, drifting from failure to failure by failing. When it was over, all I had wasted was a little time; and the actors are easy to look at - but there is nothing ""Woody Allen"" in this movie that I could recognize, and now there is nothing worth remembering about it, except that he seemed to waste an incredible amount of talent saying... nothing.",1392854400,2,1948,4.428969359331476

3532503,3,B001DJ7PR8,"Was interested to see this Woody Allen movie, as enjoyed Midnight in Paris that exceeded my expectations. This romantic drama, however fell short for me. Two best friends, Vicky and Cristina (Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson), share a summer together in Barcelona, Vicky engaged, Christina resisting to fall in love.  Their paths cross with Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) a divorced artist, who later takes in his suicidal ex Maria Elena (Penolpe Cruz), after Christina had ended up living with him. I've skipped over details as it's not worth detailing.

I felt the performances from Penelope Cruz was the best, found it difficult to watch Javier, tired of Rebecca Hall, and indifferent with Scarlett Johansson. Did enjoy the cinematography and the romantic dynamics of Juan, Maria Elena, and Christina. The end of the movie couldn't come to soon for me, due in part to the constant ""announcer"" type dialog that permeated throughout.",1392681600,,935,5.185430463576159

3532555,3,B001DJ7PR8,"I enjoyed this movie, though for me it was a little different than most movies that I watch. Being that my Dad was born in Spain, I wanted to watch it mostly for the scenery and I wasn't disappointed in that. But, the story was a little lame for my liking and there was too much narrative and not believable. For me it was hard to relate to any the characters, though would be nice if I could have related some to Juan Antonio. Acting was good though.",1391126400,,451,4.136363636363637
3532556,4,B001DJ7PR8,Enjoyed watching how this story developed.the changes that occurred during the film were unexpected and a nice change from rather blas story lines. The feeling of being in Spain and touching on the beauty and music was haunting. The dynamics between these people was not typical but more than likely more real than most would want to admit.,1391126400,,340,4.879310344827586

Once again, Woody Allen gets jammed into this groove in which women and men cheat on one another. I miss the funny Woody Allen and I wish that, for once, he would direct someone else's material. His work is getting more and more moribund. Pass it by.",1391040000,,336,4.184615384615385

3532581,4,B001DJ7PR8,"Woody always has such interesting story lines that are so much like our lives. I think that has a lot to do with his directing style... hands off, letting the actors 'go with the flow'. I especially enjoyed Javier Bardem's character and thought Penelope had a great performance. Scarlett was good too though her character was not nearly as complex as Javier's or Penelope's. I am not familiar with Rebecca Hall but her performance was also noteworthy as the conflicted fiance'/wife.

There is no right way to love and any way you look at it love can't be understood.  Its not for everyone but the actors did a good job, I wasn't amazed but it was ok.

3532684,1,B001DJ7PR8,"Rarely is a movie so bad I want to write a review about it! This was a rare find: atrociously written, acted, and produced. The ""narrator"" reminded me of movies that are dubbed for blind viewers- as if we were listening to someone read the script and state the obvious cues the actors are following. The acting was awkward and painful. These aspects were so awful I didn't even mind the entire lack of development and 360 of a ""plot"" which ended exactly as it began. Waste of every minute.",1389657600,,489,4.444444444444445
3532685,3,B001DJ7PR8,"Oh Woody. You wrote and directed films that were breathtakingly original - without even breathing hard - but Vicky Christina Barcelona is yet another ""man's fantasy about who women are and what they experience"" and so can't help but fail. The three principals are very, very good in their roles, giving surprising life to one-dimensional characters; Javier Bardem is actually able to sell the ""straightforward"" come-on for a threesome, Scarlett Johannson convinces easily how magnetic Bardem is, and Penelope Cruz (such an under-rated actor!) breathes fire with the tidbits the script provides. Well-made, well-performed and very watchable thanks to its performers, the movie is decent enough. It's Mr Allen that needs the touch of Barcelona (and Gaudi's amazing organic surrealism) to snap him out of these adolescent three-way fantasies...

The plot, however, runs in a big pointless circle, without any redemption or even insight gained by the main characters. About as empty and unsatisfying as a vacation fling, which it is. Javier Bardem is sexy as ever, but even that wears thin after the first hour or so. I want my time back.",1389657600,,388,4.402777777777778

3532715,4,B001DJ7PR8,Woody Allen is best at expressing angst from a male perspective.  Here it is from female and not as effective.  I loved the movie more the first time seeing it when newly released.  On second viewing it did not seem to be as good and I saw it from a new perspective which is why 4 stars instead of 5.  The scenery in Barcelona is spectacular and the acting by Javier and Penelope was excellent.  It was after this movie that they were dating and then married; a beautiful love story.,1389398400,,483,4.263736263736264

3532760,1,B001DJ7PR8,This movie is portrayed as more interesting than it really is.  Bottom Line:  Two girls go to Spain on vacation and are wooed by Spanish Don Juan archetype.  Now you've seen the whole movie.  End of story.,1388880000,,205,4.45945945945946

3532762,1,B001DJ7PR8,"I keep wanting to like Woody Allen films: the two documentaries about him -one about his music, one a two part about his films- intrigue and in the case of the former, charm. But his films. Each is a broad caricature of its predecessors. How does he manage to get such a range of talented actors to channel himself, and to speak in Woody Allen accents? When they talk in the hilariously mis-subtitled Spanish, Bardem and Cruz overcome the Allen speech impediment, and throughout much of the dialogue they rise above their director in English, as well.  Scarlett Johansson reliably plays Scarlett Johansson, which worked under the brilliant Sofia Coppola in ""Lost in Translation"", but continues unchanged, without growth or nuance, in ""Match Point"" and here. Has Allen really made 40 films? In a pandemic of redundancy, it so often seems he's made one film 40 times.",1388793600,,865,4.884353741496598

Luckily, Javier Bardem was there to save the day.  It went downhill when Mr. Bardem took down the girl from The Town too (Rebecca Hall).  But he has my full respect leaving no prisoners in this Rom-Com-Dram about a couple of American co-ed's taking in the sights in Barcelona.  It's a lesson for traveling American Bachelorettes not to fall for the Euro guys.  The fight scene with Bardem and Cruz in the streets of Barcelona is not to be missed.  My wife expects Cruz to be just like that in real life.  I give it five stars.",1388016000,,694,4.251908396946565

I don't really know what this movie is about, but I don't think it's about love. I think it's about perspective. And also maybe normative versus individuating choices.

Anyway, just watch it. It's funny, sexy, beautifully shot, set to good music, etc. so you have no excuse. And men--this movie revolves around two women who don't know what they want, so that should be a relatable topic for you lot as well. Then you can ask yourself what the movie is about--and really this question makes for a tasty morsel for thought.",1387756800,,712,4.5625

The continuing banter among the characters is pure ""Woody"". The subversion of Vicky, and the intensity of Maria Elena, as a result of their relationships with Juan Antonio, is fun to watch, as is the continual morphing of Christina. Juan Antonio's father also adds subtle interest as a ""Woody"" character; he writes beautiful poetry that he refuses to share with the world because he hates people. All in all, a great movie!",1387584000,,572,4.846938775510204

Such considerations probably arise from taking the typical Hollywood romcom as the archetype. You will not find that here. And if your palette is suited toward such movies, there is plenty to choose from. However, if you are hoping for a movie that will captivate you with exquisite cinematography, acting, and music seamlessly interwoven to indulge your senses, you will not be disappointed. If you have watched some European cinema and liked it, you will probably enjoy this movie.

Woody Allen has no idea what life for regular folks is like. And this is the result. It actually is something like insulting soft porn. You are like Christina with the food poisoning, just barely able to keep your stomach in check. It is not quite bad, but actually yeah it is. Should make you upchuck in disgust. Gutteral, honest disgust. The craftsmanship is it almost doesn't. The failure is the almost, because ultimately it is gut level disgusting. Quite an achievement for a story with two young, vibrant, very beautiful women who nevertheless end up as vomiting disgusting women with a vile man at the center of the story. A crock of crap most beguilingly presented. By no less than a child molester in fact. I can even see the influence in this story. An immoral evil person in the actual shape of Woody Allen. A person whose early movies inspired, but who is a disgusting old man who should end his existence or at least keep it out of public view.",1387238400,,1118,4.7384615384615385

He explores the varieties of angst found within romantic relationships, especially those that are over-analyzed by the participants.

His work is funny yet poignant, but don't come to this movie looking for some great moral lesson. That's not what what his work is about. But if you are looking for a delightful distraction, a glimpse into the madness known as romantic relationships, then this is your movie.
The story follows two American women during a short, yet very event-filled visit to Barcelona. Both young ladies think they have their lives figured out, albeit their plans are quite different...think oil and water. But their plans are interrupted when they meet an intriguing painter and his equally intriguing ex-wife. Passion and possibility fuel this plot from beginning to end.

3533058,5,B001DJ7PR8,"The randomness and plot twists of this movie were consistent with what one would expect from a Woody Allen film, but the casting of some of today's finest actors and actresses (Cruz, Bardem, Johansson) made the exploration of the concept of love feel fresh and interesting.

The movie centers around Vicky (Hall) and Cristina (Johansson), two New Yorkers who spend the summer in Barcelona staying with one of Vicky's relatives.  On one evening, the girls are having dinner at a restaurant when, by chance, they encounter Juan Antonio (Bardem), a charismatic, womanizing painter.  In short, both women become sexually involved with him, though the nature of each woman's relationship with him could not be more strikingly different.  Vicky is engaged to her loving fianc in New York, and Cristina is a perpetual wanderer whose constant restlessness precludes her from commitment.  Vicky comes to Barcelona happy and secure about her upcoming marriage, but a one-night-stand with Juan Antonio leaves her ambivalent and unsure of her intentions.  By contrast, Cristina finds a committed relationship with Juan Antonio that turns tumultuous, and then unconventional--when his ex-wife Maria Elaina (Penelope Cruz) shows up.

Though it didn't leave me with any philosophical questions or strong emotions, it was an entertaining film and the backdrop of Barcelona made it visually engaging.  Like many Woody Allen films, there wasn't a clear ""moral of the story"" here -- just a melange of art, sex, and beautiful women--it is, after all, a Woody Allen film--but I didn't mind.",1386115200,,1569,5.2730923694779115

He didn't say a thing that can't be explained without narration!..
Have to concede though beautiful actresses; the back drop of Spain is breath taking and makes u go to Spain on vacation right away. Penelope has done a good job.

3533108,2,B001DJ7PR8,"In many of his films Woody Allen has portrayed the cities he loves and knows well -how can you love something you don't know?- with supreme sensibility and soulful understanding: New York first and foremost, -to wit, the iconic Manhattan- but also London, Paris, and even Rome. But something must have happened to Woody on his way to Barcelona, he just does not have the slightest idea of what the city is about, and so the film is an endless sequence of faux clichs and quick desultory shots to a ridiculous background of Spanish guitar music. Ridiculous because everything that is supposedly evocative of Barcelona is wrong: the two main Spanish actors, Bardem and Penelope Cruz, have no connection whatsoever with the city. You could argue that the population of Barcelona is diverse, and that you could find characters like Bardem and Penelope there, but that would be missing the point. Neither actor is quintessentially Barcelonian.

Why would anyone wishing to set a film in say, Glasgow or Edinburgh, pick English actors for the leading roles? And yet Woody Allen must know that Barcelona is the capital of Catalonia, and that that fact deserves more than just a passing joke in the introduction of the film.",1380844800,,1216,4.902912621359223

No, but it's entertaining and thought provoking at the same time.  This is mind candy for people with IQ's above room temperature.  A pleasant break from the dreary doldrums of the now ubiquitous genre of indie-misery movies, where the perception is that you can't be artistic without wallowing in a dark horrible chasm of life's lowest reaches - where the concept of being entertained and enjoying entertainment is somehow considered ""beneath"" people.  This is smart and entertaining - plus it makes a plane trip go a lot faster.",1379376000,,667,4.765217391304348
3533110,5,B001DJ7PR8,"the performance which makes this film come to life is penelope cruz's for which she won an Oscar. she plays javier bardeem's ex wife.  the two of them are both artists.  she is the more talented of the two but also the crazier...way, way crazy.  she has spent time going in and out of mental institutions. the film does not open with them though.  it opens with two women, vicky and christina, who come to barcelona, spain to partially work and partially vacation. they are both lightly allied to the arts but nothing like the other two. because bardeem is now single he begins romancing both vicky and christina and even starts living with one of them.  this is when his ex show up on the scene and the film really takes off.

then the meditation on art and relationships begins.  having a sane person around stabilizes the two spanish artists so they work best on all levels in a threesome.  they even can teach the less talented and bring out their smaller talents! leave them on their own and all hell breaks loose. there are many levels going on here.  i thought the whole art relationship dichotomy was brought into sharpest relief when one of the woman thinks of leaving her boring banker husband UNTIL she discovers just how crazy these two artists can be.

this was one of allen's most popular films in years and helped establish his period spent filming in Europe instead of New York.

The story traces the lives of two women with peculiarly different personalities; one engaged to be married and searching for a place to reside and the other, being more adventurous, finding herself engaging in a love triangle with an Italian artist and his estranged wife, she being the inspiration behind the rekindling and maintenance of their relationship. However, when she decides to leave the love triangle, the relationship between both husband and wife characteristically begins to fall apart again.

That said, the movie is worthwhile to see just for Penelope Cruz, who together with Javier Bardem, is the best part of the movie. She showed real commitment to her role in spite of the weak story, and was highly entertaining to watch. Her chemistry with Bardem was apparent as well. Scarlett Johanssen was a weak link aside from the narration gimmick, her performance to me feeling like she wasn't getting the character, who was supposed to be a flighty, bohemian dilettante sort. She comes across as too grounded and confident to be the person she was portraying.

(1) Title Arrived In  Damaged Packaging (2) Blu Ray Picture Quality Was No Better Than DVD
I recently gave away my DVD copy of Vicky Cristina Barcelona, with the hope of upgrading to a Blu Ray, given the gorgeous locations and colors in the film. Jumped at the first great deal that came along on Amazon. But to my dismay, the Blu Ray copy turned out out to be a real disappointment.

(1) Firstly, the title arrived in a badly damaged packaging with a deep gash running through the plastic jewel-case, as if it had been deliberately disfigured for disposal (perhaps marked as ""not for sale item"", perhaps a pirated copy) yet somehow found its way into the legitimate channel. Perhaps it was a pirated disc that was somehow resold. THIS SPEAKS TO THE QUALITY CONTROL THAT AMAZON DOES ABOUT ITS PRODUCTS, AND ALSO THE QUALITY OF ITS SUPPLIERS.

(2) Upon playing this gorgeous movie, my experience seemed all to familiar.

3533168,5,B001DJ7PR8,"People often think that I don't have a sense of humor. This is mainly due to the fact that I don't tell jokes, and I rarely find comedies funny. Slapstick humor only works if it involves Peter Sellers, or similar genius. Most comedies are so predictable that I see the jokes coming, and they aren't very funny when they arrive. But that doesn't mean that I don't like to laugh. I look for comedy within other genres because I find that humor works better for me when it is witty, and buried within a believable situation. That's why I turn to directors like Quentin Tarantino, the Coens, Martin McDonagh, Wes Anderson, and Woody Allen when I want to laugh.

Woody Allen's humor won't work for everyone. His earlier work did contain significant amounts of physical humor and jokes, but I think he's at his best when he writes more seriously. Vicky Cristina Barcelona falls into that category. It's an examination of human nature, more than a comedy, but there are still plenty of amusing scenes.

What qualities do you find attractive in a romantic partner? Allen asks that question, and uses Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) to show two very different views. Vicky seeks stability, and likes to know what to expect from her man. Cristina is more of a free spirit, and wants her partners to have a similar outlook on life. Vicky has her future carefully planned, and is due to marry, whereas Cristina is still exploring and trying to find exactly what it is she is looking for. The thing is, she isn't sure what that is.

Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) is an artist, and boldly asks the two women to take a trip with him. He openly says that they will all make love during the trip. This proposition is attractive to Cristina, but Vicky is shocked by his brazen approach and wants nothing to do with him. Needless to say, the three do eventually make the trip. Juan Antonio is not a conventional man, and still has feelings for ex-wife Maria Elena (Penlope Cruz). Like him, she's passionate and unpredictable, as well as being an artist herself.

The story uses a narrator, and it's a great vehicle for some of the humor. Allen assembles a fantastic cast, as always, and the principals all give strong performances. Other notable appearances come from Vicky's husband-to-be, Doug (Chris Messina), and Judy (Patricia Clarkson), who is an important part of the puzzle.

Penlope Cruz won an Oscar for her supporting role, and she certainly steals most of the scenes in which she appears. Her character is a catalyst for the events that unfold in the second half of the movie, and it's during this time that Allen raises the most questions about the motives of his characters.

The writing is superb and left me thinking about relationships I have been involved in, and also some of the relationships that I have watched develop between my friends and acquaintances. Human interactions are unpredictable, complicated, and fascinating, and Allen weaves an interesting tale featuring all of those elements.

If you enjoyed such movies as Closer, Midnight in Paris, (500) Days of Summer, or The Graduate, you'll probably find something to like in Vicky Cristina Barcelona. I think it's up there with Allen's most enjoyable work.",1364688000,,3240,4.816546762589928

People poo poo it for some of the dialogue and perhaps delivery thereof, but then they'll say that the
scenery and shooting is what one would expect.  That type of positive comment balances out the stuff
that they have to make up that's ""bad"" about the movie.  I don't quite get her affinity towards Woody Allen,
but that's just fine.  In this movie, she's the character that I think we all love her as.  The supporting cast
is extremely able and Penelope's character is scary and intense.  As the story really sets, the relationship
between these 4 is really unusual, but extremely Barcelona-esque?  It's a love story, and kind of a chick flick
but there's no sense in missing out on the scenery, either of surrounding landscape or the women themselves.
I don't know what keeps me from giving it 5 stars, but for the fact that it would become a Top 10 quality of movie

As an arm chair traveller (and real traveller every chance I get), the  cinematography is spectacular and makes it seem as if you're right there with them.  You can definitely tell that Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem fell in love on the set of the movie, which of course makes the story all the more believable although it is definitely not meant to be that.  Javier Bardem's character is fantastic from the moment he tries to pick up on the two of them at the restaurant, , as is Penelope Cruz' passionate crazy woman portrayal.

Woody's done this kind of story before, and breaks no new ground here. The Catalan scenery is scrumptious, and the acting superb. I think he downplayed the amount of pain these characters actually suffered, something he has not done in other films. It's as if he wanted to walk to the cliff, but decided to pull back and go light, while enjoying the scenery.

My only real problem was that the film had numerous interruptions while streaming it on Amazon's Prime Video. We had to stop watching and pick it up again a day later. This isn't my normal experience with Amazon Prime streaming, but it did occur this time.",1346889600,,800,4.594405594405594

It is also aa beautifully filmed movie, taking advantage of gorgeous locations.  I disagree with some of the folks here saying that the summer the ladies spend in Barcelona all comes o naught or that no one changes.  (Cristina certainly does, becoming more confident.)  Perhaps the writers are just disappointed that the characters don't change into characters they would be more comfortable with.  I also disagree with those who reduce the film to the ""uptight americans come all undone when meeting the freer europeans"",  Another reviewer said that this is about the transitory nature of romantic love.  If anything, I'd say Woody is just showing us different ways that people get stuck in relationships after that love has evaporated.

Bardem and Penelope Cruz, a very good one by Rebecca Hall, and a decent one by Scarlett Johanssen.

The key flaw -- Johanssen's character comes off as very shallow, so the complexity of her relationships with Bardem and Cruz never seem more than adolescent. I realize that's ultimately part of the point of the film, but for me it's way too obvious from minute one, and keeps the film from ultimately feeling deeper and more complex.

None-the-less, a romantic bittersweet film I've enjoyed well enough to go back and re-watch.

I do admit, I have never been a fan of Mr. Allen's movies. I just don't get them. They've never touched me, or moved me, or made any sense for me. I respect him as a business man though.
The story follow two young American women, best friends, as they to Barcelona, in a type of ""coming of age"" or ""self discovery"" time of their lives. And both are transformed slash exposed to other worlds and possibilities beyond their own. They have a chance, to change their path, forever.
The acting was good, incredible actors. Obviously, the story and characters fell way short for me. I'm not sure for me, I felt the characters were really pushed beyond their comfort zones, to the point where they changed. There was a lot of intellectualizing, which doesn't really do anything for me.

3533225,1,B001DJ7PR8,"A friend recommended this film to me because of my academic and personal interests in polyamory (literally ""many loves"") and, particularly, how love is negotiated in film. Many films feature and/or follow a character who authentically loves more than one other person, but I thought ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" would be different (better) since this is actually a focal point or central theme. Sadly, the film barely scratched the surface of the complex issue. Instead, the film was boring, predictable, and... trite. It offered nothing new. While there were a couple of good talking points between characters (on love being transient, counter-intuitive, and/or hard to define), the conversations never went anywhere and the issues were never explored. I've seen other reviewers say the film is about ""youth"" or ""self-discovery"" but these are individuals in their late twenties to early thirties thinking about and making huge, life-changing decisions (like marriage - or going off with a stranger) and hardly taking any of it seriously. I find the characters largely irresponsible, inconsiderate, and shallow -- if not just dull and predictable.

What is supposed to make the plot interesting is the fact that Vicky and Cristina are so unlike each other and even more unlike Maria Elena [Juan Antonio's ex-wife] - and yet all three of them have or develop feelings for Juan Antonio. He's the glue, the one thing all the character's have in common: their interest in him. Unfortunately, efforts to step out of their usual way of doing things or explore new ways of arranging relationships are short-lived. For example, (SPOILER) Juan Antonio, Cristina, and Maria Elena wind up in a triad that seems to work really well, with reciprocated love between all three of them, but Cristina leaves the triad because it ""doesn't work for her"". Then the dyad between Juan Antonio and Maria Elena falls apart because they no longer have Cristina, the mediator. That was the only somewhat interesting glimpse into non-monogamy the film offered, unless you count the one--almost two--times that Vicky has an affair with Juan Antonio and all the distress that causes her (especially since it becomes clear that she emotionally favors him over her husband). (/SPOILER)

These characters were not interesting. The plot was not interesting. The script was not interesting. The acting was not good or inspired. And the narration was extremely annoying. The only real saving points were the beauty of Barcelona AND PENELOPE CRUZ. GOD YES. She looked radiant and her acting *almost* got the film a second star. Almost.",1333411200,,2597,5.180952380952381

But what should we expect from that master of self-indulgence, who in life (and art) practices pedophilia and incest.  You can see why he walked out on his family. Raising kids?  I need to get back to my artistic vision!

One weak spot in Allen's direction was his use of a narrator, which seemed a short cut around developing the plot and characters.

Finally, I don't see why Scarlett Johansson made it so big.  Part of a woman's sensuality and character come through in her voice, and hers sounds like a disaffected teenager, husky and unappealing (see Rachael Ray).",1316995200,,764,4.6992481203007515

Thankfully, he finally made a movie outside of that bubble and gave us what most of us want--a sensual pic set in a beautiful foreign locale (Barcelona natch!) and occupied with a range of characters running from the gorgeous and mysterious to the plain and mundane.

Even so this movie falls so flat. The ending just seems like he ran out of money and shut the camera off. Plus the way he actually treats relationships is almost cartoonish. the potential in the story is there but he's unable to weave multiple storylines (hey, Woodman, go watch a guy Ritchie caper flick to see how it's done in the 21st century) without seeing them simply left hanging and unresolved.

Also, stop treating us adults like we can't figure out the gaps in scenes. the voiceover narration is like some sort of instructions to the blind. It's beyond annoying. First rule of cinema, if you have to use narration, especially a third person one, to explain what is going on you've done a terrible job in filmmaking and are flat-out lazy.

3533233,5,B001DJ7PR8,"Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a Woody Allen film, but in his new mature style. His style has evolved over the years. It is a comedy, but not so broad--it is a sophisticated comedy. In a way, it is almost a panel discussion about why it is so difficult to define love. Vicky and Cristina (Rebecca Hall & Scarlett Johansson) are two young American women who have radically different approaches to love. Cristina knows what she doesn't want, and that is a stable but boring relationship. She wants to gamble with her feelings, putting them at risk, for the sake of grand passion. She has accepted that love might cause her great pain, but to her it was worth it. It is significant that prior to the film's beginning, she has made a 12-minute film about why love is so difficult to define. She felt her film had failed in its objective. Vicky, on the other hand, values stability above all, and has picked her fianc, Doug, because ""he was decent and successful and understood the beauty of commitment."" While Vicky and Cristina are in Spain on vacation they meet a dashing painter named Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) who tries to seduce them both. Cristina is interested, but Vicky is having none of it. However, against her better judgment, she agrees to accompany Juan Antonio and Cristina on a side trip to a small Spanish town. This little snippet sums up the dynamics of the situation:

Cristina: [Looking at a sculpture of Jesus] Are you very religious?
Juan Antonio: No, no, no, no, I'm not. The trick is to enjoy life, accepting it has no meaning whatsoever.
Cristina: No meaning? You don't think that authentic love gives life meaning?
Juan Antonio: Yes, but love is so transient. Isn't it? I was in love with a most incredible woman... and then in the end...
Vicky: Yes?
Juan Antonio: She put a knife into me.
Cristina: My God, that's terrible!
Vicky: Well, maybe you did something to deserve it.

Maria Elena (Penlope Cruz) is the woman from his past. She doesn't even appear for the first half of the film, but when she does arrive, she is a force of nature. Bardem and Cruz made a charming, if troubled couple. Their relationship was nothing if not tempestuous. Cruz earned a supporting actress Oscar for this role. Javier Bardem and Penlope Cruz ended up married two years after this film was made.

Woody Allen had Javier Bardem and Scarlett Johansson in mind when he wrote the script, and he never even considered anyone else for the role Bardem played. The script was originally set in San Francisco, but Woody Allen had a deal to make a film in Spain, so he dug out an old script that could be reset there. It seems such a perfect location that it is surprising it wasn't originally set in Spain. Woody Allen films used to always feature the writer/director in a leading role, but as he got older, it became problematic. At one point he tried using Larry David, one of the creators of Seinfeld who later had the show Curb Your Enthusiasm. This substitution of one curmudgeon for another didn't solve his dilemma. But with someone like Bardem in the leading role, or as in his latest film, Owen Wilson, all of that is changed. Bardem plays well the dashing Spanish artist who can proposition two women. Bardem can get away with propositions that would make you cringe if it was the aging Woody doing the propositioning. No country for old men, indeed. Bardem totally gets away with it. Another point in Bardem's favor is that in spite of his good fortune, his luck with the ladies, there is always a cloud on his horizon. Even while living with both Cristina and Maria Elena, things aren't perfect. He is always brooding. This makes him much more likeable. If he were just a suave womanizer he'd be totally and irredeemably insufferable.

The lush Spanish setting is beautiful and the Spanish guitar music evokes a transcendent mood. Why is it so difficult to define love? Woody Allen has really matured as a director and he knows how to tell a story with film. The actors are all excellent, with my personal favorite being Rebecca Hall, who played Vicky. I really enjoyed Rebecca Hall's portrayal of Vicky. It was fun to see her initial hostility to Juan Antonio melt. She was so judgmental, so condescending, so sure of herself, but then... she questions all the fundamental beliefs she has held so firmly up to this point.

The Bottom Line is, even if you don't like Woody Allen films, you will probably like this one, and don't worry, Woody stays behind the camera at all times.

Cristina: If you don't start undressing me soon this is going to turn into a panel discussion.

I thought the movie was too silly the first few minutes and was starting to doubt the wisdom of the Hollywood Foreign Press for giving the best comedy and musical award to this film but after listening to the narrator and soaking in the beauty of Spain and the cultural differences between polite Americans and romantic Spanish painters, I was hooked. As I write this, I'm watching it for the second time.

Juan Antonio is everything I'm not, confident, forward, colorful and an artist. His candor makes him interesting and he is not afraid to act instinctively. Seducing the two American tourists in the restaurant is a classic scene and should be required viewing for any man wanting to get over inhibitions and breaking the ice with women.

The movie makes me want to drink a large goblet of red wine and rethink my conservative, Catholic views of sexuality. Set against the beauty of ancient Spain, flamenco guitar cords and Johansson and Cruz's charm and beauty, Woody Allen does a great job of contrasting our American everyday insipid lives to the volatile colorful ups and downs of Europe's artists.

If you are feeling somewhat down and need a shot of confidence against the backdrop of colorful paintings and the small flower shops in Spain, this romantic comedy will surely inspire.",1297641600,3,1381,4.965367965367966

The tall rangy broad is a sort of pale Keaton character with the same delivery and lines that might've been recycled from Annie Hall. Penelope is an angst ridden loca whose outbursts and violence are right out one of her Aldomavar films. While Scarlet is a angst ridden blond who has cruised through life on her good looks. Javier Bardem plays an artist whose ex-wife is Penelope and in the course of the movie bangs all three of women (nice work if you can get it).  The comedic complications derive from the tall rangy broad being engaged/married to someone else and Scarlet, Penelope and Javier forming a short term mnage a tois with titillating girl on girl action.

3533250,4,B001DJ7PR8,"Woody Allen's recent relationship movie with Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz, Rebecca Hall, and Scarlett Johansson was a nice surprise. I'm not a Woody Allen fan, but occasionally he crafts a movie that appeals to me. Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008) is one of those films, along with Match Point (2005). Both films get 3.5 out of 5 stars from me. I think what I really liked about Vicky Cristina Barcelona was the complexity and absurdity of the love triangles between the main characters. From my point of view and experience, Allen does a great job of capturing the craziness that can come with love triangles and relationships in general. Relationships are messy and undefined at times, especially in the early stages. All of the actors in this film have spectacular chemistry with each other and it really comes through in their performances throughout the film.

Of course you can't beat the setting in Spain for the film. The golden saturated cinematography is very pleasing to look at. You feel like you're on a European summer vacation while watching the film (as the still images below showcase). I even felt a little sun-burned at the end of the film! What Woody Allen specializes in is movies about people and their interactions with each other. This is definitely an ""adult"" movie in terms of its topic...it probably wouldn't interest anyone under 30. I never would have watched this film 5-10 years ago, but now that I'm in my 30s, I find myself interested in social dynamics, relationships, romance and love.

The bike ride to the picnic is a dead give-away, as is the narration.  Watch that classic movie again and you will get more out of this one.  That being said, I enjoyed this movie even before this dawned on me.  On the surface, it's about beautiful people in beautiful locations involved in artistic pursuits.  Basically, the fantasy life of any thinking person who wants something other than the shallow pop culture that we are continually inundated with.  Yet somehow all the major characters wind up unhappy or unsatisfied.

I've watched it about 3 times since.
I think the film is unrealistic as some people have mentioned here.  A poet who lives in a beautiful Spanish villa, no one else seems to be short of money.  I don't know many artists who live like the lead character here in a beautiful home with a swimming pool with large rooms.  But there is something very interesting here.
I think I like what is says.  Sometimes we think we know what we want but it's not really what we want.  It's what we think we are supposed to do.  What everyone around us expects us to do. What would happen if we just said 'to hell with it' and did whatever we wanted with whomever we wanted to do it with?

3533253,4,B001DJ7PR8,"Woody Allen takes us to a beautiful place and introduces us to beautiful people, all of whom are contending in one way or another with love, lust, longing or some combination of the three. Allen has some sharp things to say, I think, about our confounding refusal to be happy with what we have, about our futile and often-destructive tendency to be on constant lookout for something or (more to the point) someone who will bring us a lifetime of unbroken joy and fulfillment. It's fun to watch actors as skilled as Javier Bardem, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Penelope Cruz and Patricia Clarkson sparring, romancing and searching for happiness while trying to maintain a semblance of personal dignity. And I've added Barcelona to my list of cities to visit. But I eventually found myself wondering if, in the end, this movie didn't just amount to a ridiculous male fantasy: Bardem manages to effortlessly bed some of the world's most beautiful women, sometimes two at a time, while remaining a basically decent, grounded guy. The two main characters here are essentially living a fantasy themselves, despite the tumult in their personal lives. Fresh out of college, Vicky (Hall) and Cristina (Johansson) spend a summer in Spain, dining in fashionable restaurants, visiting museums and hanging out with artists. This lifestyle would cost a fortune. No doubt, some families can afford these indulgences. But are their troubles really worth the attention of such a talented writer and filmmaker? Wouldn't the vast majority of people on this planet gladly trade places with characters simply exempt from the some of the biggest challenges of ordinary life - financial pressure, bad bosses, compromised career dreams? But that, I finally decided, may be Allen's point precisely: These characters have everything - beauty, brains, money, youth, freedom, artistic passion. If even they struggle to find love and happiness, what chance do mere mortals have?",1285891200,3,1953,5.1835443037974684
3533254,3,B001DJ7PR8,"Some critics have praised the use of a voiceover narrator in the film, while others, like James Berardinelli, have condemned it. The truth is that it's neither here nor there. Yes, there are moments when it is needlessly recapitulative, but others where it makes for handy elisions of superfluous moments. The voice of Welch, though, is perhaps too much like a young Woody Allen's, and given that Hall's Vicky is clearly the designated neurotic Woody character, this vocal affinity of Welch's subliminally biases the viewer toward feeling a certain way toward Vicky that otherwise might not exist- i.e.- it makes the screenplay seem more about Vicky because she is seen as the Woody character- pro or con, depending on the viewer's preconceptions of the real life Allen and his neurotic onscreen characterizations. The film's strongest point, however, is its anti-climactic ending, wherein all the characters return to where they were. If only the rest of the film were as spare and poetic, then Vicky Cristina Barcelona would have been a film that could be argued for greatness.

  As for the actors, the best performance was likely given by Bardem, although he also had the least complicated part- the slimeball user (best described by Vicky as a `charmingly candid wifebeater'). Hall and Messina actually had good chemistry together, which made a viewer wonder why Vicky would give a damn about the slimy Juan, except for the obvious; that Allen was pandering to the Lowest Common Denominator Hollywood ideal of romantic love (being in love) somehow being better than true love (being loved). Scarlett Johansson was again misused by Allen. Her best role was in Allen's light comedy, Scoop, where she proved to be quite an adept comedienne- surpassed in the Allen pantheon of female comic talents only by Diane Keaton. But where this idea arose of her as a sex symbol is mystifying. She's simply a rather average looking young woman, far more suited to the girl next door roles that would have once gone to Donna Reed or Doris Day than the roles she gets, which would have once gone to Marilyn Monroe or Jayne Mansfield. It's truly mystifying, as Johansson simply lacks the sexual `It' factor. But, worst of all is Penelope Cruz. Putting aside the character's stereotypes, I have seen her in a handful of films and a) she cannot act (despite claims that she is far better in Spanish language films than English ones, for over 50% of her role here is in Spanish), and b) like Johansson, she is almost always cast as a sex bomb, despite the fact that she's just an average looking woman and, in this film, looks scrawny, if not outright anorexic. Despite, at times looking like a younger, prettier Mackenzie Phillips, the best looking female in the film, by far, is Rebecca Hall, the least known of the trio. She also is, easily, the best actress.

  The film also benefits from some great cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe, and by that I do not mean merely that Barcelona was beautiful to look at. There are numerous well framed shots, and shots from interesting angles, such as when Cristina and Maria go around the city photographing sights and people. Aguirresarobe is not a cinematographer I've seen the work of before, but after this film, and given his great surname, his is work I will look for in the future, despite whatever director he works with in the future. It is because of the strengths of the film (the cinematography, Bardem's and Hall's performances, the sometimes great deployment of ellipses and narration) that I can recommend Vicky Cristina Barcelona as, at least, a good way to spend a couple of hours in filmic revery. Don't expect a masterpiece from Allen's Golden Age, and you will do ok. Go in thinking it's another Hollywood Ending, though, and you will end the film smiling. Given the lows of some of Allen's work post-Golden Age, that's as close to a rave as you will find, at least from me.",1282780800,,3928,4.837797619047619

A perfect ensemble piece with note perfect performances from all concerned - Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Penelope Cruz and a particularly charismatic Javier Bardem who is clearly a really fine actor. (Contrast his charming animal magnetism in this movie with the eerily impassive psychopath Anton Chigurh in 'No Country for Old Men.')

The silent star of this movie of course is Barcelona, ravishingly photographed in luminous sunlight. The flamenco guitars on the soundtrack complement the atmosphere perfectly.

The narrative is deftly handled with no pat conclusions and just leaves you feeling the better for having spent some time with real people (albeit, in the case of Bardem and Cruz, people who are clearly very unusual.)

of her relationships with Bardem and Cruz never seem more than
adolescent. I realize that's ultimately part of the point of the film,
but here it's way too obvious from minute one, and keeps the film from
ultimately feeling deeper and more complex. None-the-less, a romantic bittersweet
film I've enjoyed well enough to go back and re-watch.

Like those classics and several lesser efforts, this 2008 romantic dramedy is a distilled examination of why men and women long for romance and how we fluidly fall in and out of love as a result, often with dire consequences and not without personal humiliation. What makes this entry particularly welcome is the full-blooded infusion of Spanish art and architecture that brings an emotional ripeness to the story. It also helps that Allen has gathered a more eclectic cast than usual to inhabit the richly developed characters. This is easily the most enjoyable film he has made since going abroad and probably his funniest since at least 2000's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Small-Time-Crooks/dp/B00003CXGS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Small Time Crooks</a>.

The plot focuses on two American college friends, polar opposites on the subject of love, as they vacation in Barcelona for the summer. As the conservative one who values stability and devotion, Vicky is there to study ""Catalan Identity"" as she waits to return to the states to marry Doug, an ambitious young man who maps out their future with a stifling lack of spontaneity. Failed filmmaker Cristina, on the other hand, is a romantic adventurer who craves unbridled passion with no limits. Their differing perspectives on love clash immediately when they both catch the eye of renowned abstract painter Juan Antonio. He makes a supremely self-confident proposition to Vicky and Cristina to join him on a romantic weekend trip to Oviedo, a picturesque town near the northern coast. Naturally, Vicky is appalled and makes no bones in telling him so, but Cristina is excited by the idea of being seduced by him. They agree to go with him and face unexpected consequences. Things get even more complicated when Juan Antonio's tempestuous ex-wife Maria Elena shows up and forces him to face his weaknesses.

Part of the resulting roundelay feels like a throwback to Allen's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Midsummer-Night-s-Sex-Comedy/dp/B00005O06K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy</a>, but there is also a palpable sense of melancholy more reminiscent of his mid-period films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crimes-and-Misdemeanors/dp/B00005AUJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crimes and Misdemeanors</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Husbands-and-Wives/dp/B000062XE6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Husbands and Wives</a>. What remains consistent throughout is the filmmaker's incurable romanticism, a freshly optimistic viewpoint that makes the film thoroughly pleasurable despite the familiar set-up. The performances are terrific beginning with Rebecca Hall, a surprising find as Vicky, a young woman who thought she knew what she wanted only to find out too late that it's not what she wants at all. As a typical Allen heroine, Hall lets her initially strident manner as Vicky give way to a resonating sadness. As for Scarlett Johansson, the third time's definitely a charm.

As Cristina, however, she gets to blend together her carnal allure and comic insecurity in a more seamless fashion. She has a wonderfully funny moment when she just can't control her titillation at Juan Antonio's proposal in the restaurant.

For those who have only recently been introduced to his mesmerizing work by way of his maniacal killer in the Coen Brothers'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Country-for-Old-Men/dp/B00118T63C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Country for Old Men</a>, Javier Bardem is completely convincing as Juan Antonio, a man who effortlessly controls the fates of the three women enraptured by his sensual manner and open soul. Unlike a shallower actor like Antonio Banderas, Bardem manages to move between smoldering and vulnerable with fluency. As Maria Elena, Penlope Cruz finally comes into her own in a non-Almodvar film. Taking the concept of a tortured artist to an extreme, the actress blazes with dangerous vitality, even though the role is relatively minor. She brings visceral life to the combative relationship between her and Juan Antonio, and at the same time, displays a sharp Allenesque wit, especially when she slyly ridicules Cristina in Spanish during their tension-filled conversations. The always-reliable Patricia Clarkson is quietly effective as a family friend of Vicki's with secrets of her own, while Chris Messina conveys the right level of unctuous smarminess as Doug.

The film is beautiful to look at thanks to the luscious, sun-dappled cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe. With Gaudi's most famous work on display, Barcelona could hardly look more appealing on film. Just as evocative is the atmospheric music by a bevy of contemporary Spanish composers. The one aspect that doesn't work quite as well as intended is Christopher Evan Welch's stentorian narration, which lacks the right level of irony to make the ploy worthwhile. Most of the time, it comes across as a conceit to explain parts of the narrative that seem clear enough from the scenes.

3533276,4,B001DJ7PR8,"I bought VCB on DVD a couple of months ago, but delayed watching it as I wasn't sure what to make of the mixed reviews and also because I wasn't sure if my wife (who generally doesn't like Woody Allen films) would enjoy it. I needn't have worried because VCB is easily Woody Allen's best film comedy since Husbands and Wives. Everyone in our household enjoyed it immensely.

When I say 'comedy' I don't mean mildly amusing, I mean laugh-out-loud funny. Admittedly it does take a while to get into its stride, but the scenes between Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz in the second half of the film are absolutely hilarious in exactly the same way that the unfaithful husband and his embarrassing astrology-obsessed girlfriend were funny in Husbands and Wives. I think overall this is what impressed me most about the film: it marks the return of Woody Allen as the razor sharp observer of human frailty, something we have seen too little of in recent years. Watching the film also made me realise why Allen struggles to find a mass audience these days. Far more than other directors, he uses body language - or to be more precise the discrepancy between what a character is thinking (privately) and what he or she says - rather than the screenplay to create dramatic tension and drive the narrative forward. We have grown so used to directors who spoon feed us with special effects or obvious plot devices that we are fast losing the ability to appreciate those who use more subtle techniques.

The central theme of the film is the nature of erotic desire, its connection to art and, more specifically, the conflict between erotic desire as the longing for something wild and seemingly unattainable and erotic desire as the bond which nurtures loyalty and long term relationships. This is essentially the same theme that Allen explored so adroitly in Hannah and Her Sisters and Husbands and Wives.  Vicky does genuinely love her fiance, but he can't satisfy her longing for aesthetic fulfilment; in the end, she has to make a choice and she chooses to remain unfulfilled. Cristina is more bohemian and experimental, but eventually realises she is in way over her head in a complex menage-a-trois that isn't working. Some critics complained that, at the end of the film, Vicky seems to have learned nothing from her experience, and that this is a weakness. I think this misses the point. Vicky has learnt that she is much more like Cristina than she initially imagined. Cristina has benefited from her experience but is (one suspects) sufficiently American in her values not to want to repeat it. Both girls are left with a longing for something that remains out of reach. The film appears to lack a clear resolution because that it what real life is like. If Woody Allen had been making a conventional romantic comedy, it would presumably have ended with a wedding scene in which the bride abandons her 'worthy but dull' husband-to-be for the man she really loves. We can all feel grateful that he chose instead to make a film about the restlessness of the human condition.

The key message for Woody Allen fans who haven't yet seen VCB is that the critics who praised this film on its release were right: it does represent a genuine return to form. It is not as strong or assured as his best films from the '70s and '80s, but it is recognisably by the same director and exhibits most of the qualities that made those films so special. For most of us, that will be more than enough.",1258329600,,3479,4.689034369885434

3533279,4,B001DJ7PR8,"Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a Woody Allen movie that offers three of the most luminous presences in film today: Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz, and Scarlett Johannson. Because this is a Woody Allen film the characters are cheesy, and the plot very flimsy. The plot centers around two American best friends who are polar opposites of each other: Cautious and prudent Vicky (Rebecca Hall) who is about to marry a successful and stable man who loves her very much, and wild and voluptuous Cristina (Scarlett Johannson) who is on a journey to discover and enjoy life. In Spain for the summer they run into a Spanish artist who just came out of a literally bloody divorce, and who promised the two fun, sex, and self-discovery. After a weekend with the artist Vicky has made love with him, and now questions the very foundation of her life, and Cristina decides the artist is very fun and sexy and so moves in with him. Then the artist's ex-wife Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) shows up, and after some initial tension the three fall in love with each other. Maria Elena tells Vicky that before the couple was always fighting, and even though they were madly in love with each other they just couldn't be with each other -- something was missing, and that person was Vicky. Vicky completed them, and as the summer comes to an end Vicky sits by the sparkling Spanish coast, and thinks to herself, ""Well, that's all very good -- but what's in it for me?"" So she leaves, and after some more misadventures everybody and everything ends up the way they and things were in the beginning.

This is an enjoyable movie, and it's enjoyable because Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz, and Scarlett Johannson are truly great screen presences. Javier Bardem has had a long and storied career, and one of our greatest living actors. He was scary and eery in ""No Country for Old Men,"" and now he's charming and nice.

Penelope Cruz made some interesting movies in her native Spain before Hollywood stole and abused her. She was very good in ""Ham! Ham!"" (where she starred alongside Javier Bardem) and very bad in everything that she's made for Hollywood. In ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" she is very much the star. She's startling beautiful, and when she's posing for Vicky's camera she's incredibly sultry and sexy. And when she's crazy she's even sexier.

If there's a role that Hollywood leading ladies can play extremely well it's that of the psychopath. Angelina Jolie was absolutely mesmerizing in ""Girl, Interrupted"" -- and acting the part of a teenage psychopath you had to think she wasn't acting at all. Ditto for Salma Hayek. She's a terrible actress, and the one good solid credible performance she delivers is in ""Lonely Hearts"" where she plays a deranged psychopath who kills as passionately as she loves. In Woody Allen's movie Penelope Cruz playing the part of the neurotic and moody, violent and deranged artist comes across so eloquently and naturally we have think she must be like this in real life as well. Whatever the reason Penelope Cruz is just so fun and pleasant to be with in this movie.

And then there's Scarlett Johannson. Of late she has become Woody Allen's muse and leading lady, having starred in his previous two films (""Scoop"" and ""Match Point""). Seeing her alongside Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz we see her limitations as an actress -- she just doesn't have the presence and charisma of these two brilliant Spanish actors. But she does have Woody Allen who gives her more screen time than anyone else -- even though in this film she is by far the least talented of all the actors.

Once upon a time Woody Allen made fresh and energetic and clever movies. Then he turned his film-making into psychotherapy for himself, and from then on we had to endure Woody Allen's neurotic navel-gazing and mental masturbation. And now Woody Allen's filmmaking is motivated by something else entirely.

For the first thirty minutes of ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" I really couldn't figure what it was. Woody Allen was never a good writer -- his jokes were too forced and too artificial. In this movie all the dialogue is wooden and stiff, and decidedly unfunny -- and we only tolerate the bad dialogue because of Woody Allen's overuse of narration which does keep the film moving at a fairly fast clip and because the bad dialogue is delivered by some of the most accomplished actors we have today. And even though the actors are very good about one-third in I started to get itchy because the movie, quite frankly, just didn't have a story.

Allen's also a very limited film-maker. Many of the transitions in the movie were clumsy and amateurish. Most of the time the cinematography comes across as succinct and economical but there are some moments when the movie looks clumsy and haphazard.

So if Woody Allen's got nothing to say and he's not particularly adept at the technique of film-making why is he still making movies? I was struggling with this question before I finally awoke to the answer staring right in front of me: Scarlett Johannson.

Woody Allen has fallen in love with Scarlett Johannson -- just like the way the artist couple played by Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz fell in love with her. Scarlett's sexy, she's young, she's unmolded and extremely impressionable, she's self-absorbed, and at the end of the day she's going to use you and then dump you and then completely forget about you. When Vicky (Scarlett Johannson) tells the artist couple that she needs to leave and discover more of herself Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) becomes angry and says she knew that Vicky would just use them and then when it was no longer fun for her she would just leave. Woody Allen is by far the most narcisstic filmmaker we have today so we have to believe that Woody's subconsciously saying to Scarlett: ""I love you, I worship you, I've made you into a star and given you more screen time than what aesthetics and audiences would permit but you don't really care about me right? And you could leave me at anytime, right?"" And how does Scarlett respond to Woody Allen's surrogates in the film? ""It's not about you, it's about me.""

So arguably ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is about Woody Allen's romantic frustrations with his leading lady. Woody Allen's psychotherapy sessions masquerading as films worked commercially because they articulated the phobias and anxieties of his loyal audience. And we're willing to tolerate Woody Allen's new obsession with Scarlett Johannson because let's face it -- we're also obsessed with her. There are many actresses more talented and more beautiful than her -- but she's easily one of the sexiest. And on the big screen she's like a magnet, drawing us in, unable to take our eyes off her. You go, Woody.",1257811200,,6740,4.792598967297763

There comes a time in one's filmmaking career when he becomes bland and overused to the point where he needs to stop. Well, that's basically Woody Allen in a nutshell- his movies have gotten more and more boring (I would say ""Boringer and Boringer"" but that's bad grammar) as he's gone on. Joke's on me, I guess? I dunno. I'm only a mortal, not a god like Woody.

Vicky Christina Barcelona is a movie that's every bit as annoying and ""gritting-teeth-to-sit-through"" as it's title. Well, title first- why not just ""Vicky and Christina Go to Barcelona""? Oh right, I forgot. Allen has gotten so old that he's decided to combine words now.

Basically, Vicky and Christina go to Barcelona on a vacation, they meet this guy who Christina finds attractive, they follow him to this one place outside of Barcelona, Vicky likes him, CHristina likes him, he likes Christina more, Vicky gets married, etc. etc. etc. Oh! I forgot! Penelope Cruz is in this movie!!!! Except she plays an unlikeable bitchy character who Bardem was married to in the past. Oh, and a love triangle begins... are you able to follow this at all? Because I'm not.

Thank God I rented this. I gave it 1 out of 2 stars mainly for Penelope Cruz's awesome performance (although her character was an unlikeable headcase) and the other star being for the gorgeously hot Scarlett Johansson. I think Javier Bardem is a great actor and I loved his performance as Anton Chigurh in the spectacular ""No Country For Old Men"", which remains to this day as the best movie I've ever seen in a theater. However, not even he could save this movie. His performance is a very bored and tired one, he goes through the motions and never changes his experession on his face.

I am also going to have to tear the narrator to shreds too. The moment the narrator's voice came on, I began laughing. He sounds like a spokesperson for Mac!!!!! What kind of drugs was he taking when he decided to hire the narrator? I am also going to tear down the ""tension building"" argument too. What tension was there? Were sentences like ""They had lunch"" or ""2 Days later, she apologized"" supposed to be tension builders????

In short, I have not seen Whatever Works yet, but I currently have no plans to. This movie was a severely missed opportunity, and proof that Allen's clearly getting too old to be doing this kind of cinema, let alone any cinema.",1257724800,2,2448,4.6160919540229886
3533281,4,B001DJ7PR8,"**THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**

In his early days, after he gave up writing comedies such as 'Bananas' and 'Sleeper', Woody Allen desperately anted to join the ranks of the world's great directors such as Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini. He churned out pretentious drivel such as ""Interiors"" in an attempt to emulate his beloved Bergman but deep down he always knew that he could never approach the great director's depth. So he turned to a mixture of romantic comedy and his own brand of 'art house fare' in the films that made him famous: 'Annie Hall', 'Manhattan' and 'Hannah and her Sisters'. Unfortunately, until the impressive ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", he was never able to muster enough sympathy for his characters to make them credible enough or engaging. There was always that flash of arrogance underneath the surface that Allen was unable to hide; he was always one step above his characters, looking down on them rather then striking the necessary balance between sympathy and contempt.

At a certain point, Allen threw up his hands and decided for awhile that maybe he should go back to his strong suit as an 'entertainer'. He churned out fluff pieces such as 'Bullets over Broadway' and 'Manhattan Murder Mystery' but made one last attempt at joining the great directors' pantheon with ""Deconstructing Harry"", another failed attempt to emulate Bergman. Allen floundered until 2005 when he came out with 'Match Point' which marked a welcome move to the mainstream. No longer starring in his own films and filming in England, Allen decided that he no longer had to prove to the world that he was the next Fellini or Bergman. Up until the unconvincing climax, 'Match Point' was a taut drama chronicling the machinations of a lower-class retired tennis pro as he manipulates family members in an upper class milieu.

Vicky Christina Barcelona is content to examine all strictly middle class characters from both sides of the Atlantic. Before Allen shows us the 'dark' side to his characters, he wisely builds sympathy for them. Both Vicky and Christina are adventurers. Vicky, the more conservative of the two, is extremely skeptical of Juan Antonio's proposal to fly in his private plane for a weekend of wild abandon in a picaresque Spanish town. Her skepticism and conservative nature are her strong points. Christina, in contrast, believes in taking chances without thinking about the consequences so she convinces Vicky to accept Juan Antonio's proposal. While Christina often acts recklessly, her desire for freedom often leads her to new, interesting experiences which the average person would never dream of entertaining.

Juan Antonio, the suave Lothario, who sees nothing wrong in seducing as many women as he can, also has many likable attributes. Not only is he a 'smooth operator' but he has that 'senstive side' that women are drawn to. Vicky finds Juan Antonio's proposition to visit his father his ""first genuinely interesting proposition"". Juan Antonio's startling account of why his father won't share his poetry with the world draws Vicky to him. Juan Antonio's ex-girlfriend, the volatile Maria Elena, can hold her own with her ex in regards to creative pursuits. Not only does Juan Antonio claim that his strength as an artist can be attributed to Maria Elena but she is genuinely helpful to Christina when she teaches her how to become an accomplished photographer.

The plot of VCB never bores. The break into Act II occurs when Juan Antonio takes Vicky and Christina on a wild weekend. Up until the midpoint there are many twists: Christina becomes sick right before making love; Juan Antonio's seduction of Vicky; Doug's proposal to get married first in Spain and his arrival and Christina's decision to move in with Juan Antonio.

The midpoint marks escalating tension. This is when Maria Elena attempts suicide and moves in with Christina and Juan Antonio. More twists and turns occur in the second half of Act II: Maria Elena's terrible jealousy toward Christina; The revelation of Juan Antonio's infidelity which led to Maria Elena attacking him; Vicky's confession to Ben that she doesn't know why she's attracted to Juan Antonio; Judy's affair with Doug's business partner and her misguided encouragement of Vicky in continuing the affair with Juan Antonio; Christina's decision to leave the mnage a trios and Maria Elena and Juan Antonio's dispiriting breakup.

Woody Allen does a much better job with his climax than in Match Point since Maria Elena's 'crime of passion' is more believable than Chris, the ex-tennis pro's foray into full-blown murder.

Just as he views his characters with sympathy, Woody Allen doesn't hesitate to criticize them. Vicky admits that her husband Doug is a wonderful guy, someone who she's always wanted but cannot throw off her irrational attraction to Juan Antonio. Even at the end, she's about to be seduced by Juan Antonio AGAIN but is brought back to reality when Maria Elena's gun goes off and she sustains a flesh wound to her hand. Christina seems naturally drawn to vacuous affairs. Even at the beginning, she's telling Juan Antonio she'll go up to his room but ""you'll have to seduce ME"". She's also a bit arrogant when she tells him, ""You're home free, unless you blow it"". Christina never knows ""what she wants"" but does know ""what she DOESN'T want"".

Juan Antonio seems to go from one woman to another but is unable to make a commitment. His narcissism seems to always lead to bad feelings of jealousy amongst the various women he seduces. And of course Maria Elena is the ultimate narcissist in that she can't accept others unless they give her 100% loyalty.

The overuse of the narrator in VCB is perhaps the film's major flaw. One wonders why Woody Allen doesn't trust his audience to draw its own conclusions. Nonetheless, VCB marks a comeback of sorts for Woody Allen. It's a perceptive and critical look at European and American sensibilities regarding relationships and how they can go awry.",1257206400,,5996,5.017085427135679
3533282,5,B001DJ7PR8,"This is one of my favorite movies! The music and scenery are a treat to the senses.  The cast is perfect, particularly Scarlett Johansson's neurotic, but carefree, character.",1256601600,,174,5.214285714285714
3533283,4,B001DJ7PR8,"The reviews of this movie are all over the place, which tells me that a lot of people just don't get Woody Allen's distinctive approach to making movies.  Yes, of course the plot and characters are exaggerated, to the point where the plot seems implausible and the characters seem like caracitures.  They're meant to be that way.  In a Woody Allen movie, the plot and characters are intended only as vehicles to bring particular themes into sharp relief.

In this movie, the theme is indeed quite clear.  If you were wealthy enough to have financial freedom, how would you live your life?  Most of us can't relate to that situation, but we aspire to it, so it's worth exploring as a thought experiment.  Would you go for passion and adventure, throwing yourself into unfamiliar situations, thereby risking physical and emotional harm for the hope of a life filled with uniquely rich experiences and self-expression?  Or would you instead go for an (upper-class) mainstream life of material consumption, social networking, stability, and security, all at the expense of predictable and monotonous conformity?

This movie explores these two options, revealing the pros and cons of each, and showing that neither option is ideal, with tradeoffs involved either way.  For some people, the choice is clear, so at least they don't have to worry about making the wrong choice.  For other people, the choice isn't clear at all, so they at least have a genuine choice, but either choice will come with a painful awareness of what was given up.  Not surprisingly, what the movie fails to point out is that both of these options are relatively hedonistic, whereas there's also the option of living according to a purpose which transcends the self.  In fact, the inadequacy of the two presented options could be considered evidence that a self-transcendent option may make more sense.

Despite this major limitation, I still think the movie explores its theme in a worthy and stimulating way, and the acting and scenery are also very good, so I recommend it and I'm happy to give it 4 stars.",1256428800,4,2079,4.902857142857143

3533286,3,B001DJ7PR8,"Knowing that the movie is written by Woody Allen, there was a risk of wasting time watching it. I took the risk knowing that the nice scenery in Barcelona and Scarlett Johansson's performance would help redeem any plot defects, and I wasn't mistaken.
The plot is simply every man's dream of having beautiful women chasing after him, which can be easily explained, knowing that Woody Allen is the writer. What is so wonderful though is that this story reveals how delusional we ladies are for falling for stupid bad boys, who have nothing to offer (not even wit or looks) and compromising our self respect and even our simplest rights, while turning down good guys.

Johansson's performance and her emotional conclusion at the end makes this film worth watching in order to find out that even if we make mistakes, we don't have to suffer and keep repeating the same mistake and if we can't or don't know what we want, we can at least find out what we don't want.",1254182400,,961,4.619883040935672

Penelope Cruz is his volatile x-wife, while Rebecca Hall (Vicky) and Scarlett Johansson (Christina) portray two American friends visiting Barcelona who decide to accept Juan's invitation to spend the weekend in Oviedo.

The movie's voice over comes across like a narrator telling us a fairy tale. This enhances the whimsical, and fantastic tone of the movie. In this fairy tale for, and about, adults, we learn about the passions, ambivalence, love interests, and illogical decisions that fly about creating ever more delirious scenes.

3533291,3,B001DJ7PR8,"There was enough in the film to keep me watching it---beautiful shots of Barcelona and the countryside, charming outdoor cafes, warmly lit intimate interiors, etc.  Lots of eye candy.  A nice travelog with characters and a sexy plot.

Allen is obviously highly enamored of Scarlett Johansen and who could blame him---she is gorgeous and lights up every scene she's in, even if you can't call what she does ""acting.""  Penelope Cruz is her match and the scenes with the two of them are probably the most interesting.  Javier Barden is appropriately swarthy, sexy and Spanish and fills the bill for the role, which is pretty one-dimensional. Rebecca Hall who plays Vicky really plays Scarlett Johansen, who is sort of playing Woody Allen.  I found Ms. Hall's performance slightly better than execrable and I have to assume that the only reason she was cast was that she resembles Ms. Johansen a lot....just without the star quality.  All of them do Woody's stumbling word shtick that was cute about thirty years ago but now.....no!

The story concerns two young American girls spending their summer in Europe and find romance, or something like it, and then....go home again.  It's a story that has been lived out countless times by countless American college girls.  It seems that drinking and romance with Europeans with looser morals than the ones they left back home is a mandatory coming of age ritual for lots of girls with enough money to make the trip.  All under the pretense of art.

It did remind me of Henry James' wonderful novels in which naive Americans found themselves over their heads with decadent Europeans, but James did it much better!

I do give it three stars for the visual beauty of the film.  Maybe just play it without the dialogue, if you can get it free from the library and you can have a glass of wine or two and some interesting friends to chat with while it's playing.",1252540800,,1899,4.75
3533292,3,B001DJ7PR8,"3.5 stars. Javier Bardem won an Oscar for playing an essentially sexless, emotionless murderer with a supremely dorky haircut. Here he displays his Continental sex god charm to full effect as a bohemian painter who romances not one, but three separate women over the course of a summer in Barcelona. Mr. Bardem espressed wonderment in a magazine interview that he got paid to make love to three gorgeous women in the same movie. Why not, say I? This Spaniard is sexy as all get out. Woody Allen's muse du jour, Scarlett Johansson can't even compete on the sexy scale with Bardem, though she tries a lot harder. As if we needed further evidence that Woody Allen is a lecherous old man, here it is! Though it is contrived and self-conscious in the manner of all Allen films (was a Narrator really necessary? I say not), I ended up liking this anyway. Penelope Cruz channels Frida Kahlo to chew the scenery and what scenery it is. You will want to do two things immediately after watching this movie: book your ticket to Barcelona and run, don't walk, to the store to get a copy of the dance-tastic Latin soundtrack.

3533295,2,B001DJ7PR8,"This is more of a empty-headed travelogue than a movie. Woody Allen's film was reportedly funded by the Spanish government to create a film that would encourage tourism to Spain (Woody must have been desperate to get financing, considering his last turkeys).

In this mission, he succeeded (Barcelona looks delicious, and the Spanish music is used to good effect), but otherwise it's a trifle. None of the characters ring true - we have the hot blonde, ready for anything, the hesitant, neurotic brunette, the bohemian, sexually liberated artist (of course!) and the psycho wife. And worse, there's the incredibly irritating narration that reminds that yes, this is indeed a Woody Allen movie. It's as if Woody had to leave some kind of fingerprint on this mindless trifle, and it makes the film worse.

As mindless entertainment, it works - superficially. You have beautiful people, beautiful scenery, and Spanish music that is deeper and more soulful than the film itself. But why should we care about this movie, why bother making it? Oh yes - to sell Spain as a tourist destination.",1248134400,2,1086,4.994475138121547

It's about three women pondering their existential selves and their love lives.  The existential angst is serious and is dealt with through life experience which is mostly their love lives.  Their love lives create the angst that they deal with and so forth.

Javier Bardem plays a charismatic Spanish artist who was married to Penelope Cruz.  Their marriage could not last because it was too tumultuous.  Scarlett Johansson and her friend are visiting Spain and Javier Bardem invites them to his small town for a weekend romp.  What ensues is the meat of the movie.

I loved the narration but I imagine that others might find it a bit cloying.  It's a fun movie for a late summer's night.  You'll think of your youth, the sun and stars, and the passions that cry out in all of us.",1247443200,,846,4.58
3533297,2,B001DJ7PR8,"Woody Allen movies are nearly always can't-miss affairs. His humor can be broad or dry, but it's always a treat to watch the endless combinations of the common neuroses and foibles of his New York characters. In ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona ,"" he launches three personalities into his comic maelstrom. There's conventional and soon-be-married Vicky (Rebecca Hall), nutty/slutty Cristina (Scarlett Johansson ) and volcanically sexy Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem). Vicky and Christina are in Barcelona for a vacation before Vicky's wedding to a rich but dull stocks analyst. A chance encounter at an art show and a restaurant brings them into the orbit of Juan Antonio, who quickly and nonchalantly offers to make love to both of them. Vicky and Christina find the offer simultaneously repellent and intriguing, setting the plot into motion.

I'm not sure what caused this movie to fail. The voice-over narration, used lamely to lend comic irony to the characters' inner feelings, did not help. That a film needs narration to explain itself is always a bad sign. Perhaps Allen asked too much of Bardem and Hall, who seemed incapable of portraying the complexity of character that makes Allen's characters so memorable. An hour into this comedy, my wife and I both wondered what we were missing. Penelope Cruz provided a ray of light, playing Maria Elena, Bardem's sexy and unstable ex-wife. Oscar notwithstanding, her performance was so-so, though in comparison with the dullness of her co-stars, it was positively brilliant.

""Vicky Christina Barcelona"" was a real disappointment. Let's hope that this is simply a rare miss on Allen's part and not the sign that his creative days have come to an end.",1247184000,,1694,5.134057971014493
3533298,3,B001DJ7PR8,"On first hearing about this new Woody Allen film - Vicky Cristina Barcelona, marked up as a comedy and listed as Woody Allen return to form, I was certain to see this on release date in the UK. But life once again had me side tracked and I've only managed to get around to it now. Even though I've heard good/bad opinions from friends it was still a film I was always going to view for myself; so rented this film to draw my own conclusion.

The whole film is interwoven and shaped so that different storylines are voiced together by a narrator who fills us; the viewer; with a bigger picture of what happening at all times. Vicky Cristina Barcelona, three characters are placed in the title, starting with two americans who have different attitudes to life and love. Victoria (Rebecca Hall) plays it straight laced; a no nonsense attitude; questioning everything; her sensible cerebral life is her. Currently working on a Master's degree in Catalan Culture she leaves a well-off fiance behind in New York and travels to Barcelona with Cristina to stay with friends for the summer. Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) free spirit; sexually adventurous; committed only to herself; knowing what she doesn't want in life rather than what she does. Cristina's art is photography. The third character Barcelona with amazing architecture, music, cuisine, a beautiful enriched festively soak up the sun atmospheric city.

Living in Barcelona; Juan Antonio Gonzalo (Javier Bardem) plays the moody, seductive Picasso-ish artist who in turn sets out to seduce both girls alone or even both at the same time, a distraction part time, using what he needs to remain creative. Juan might even be looking for a re-placement of losted love as he clearly has not gotten over Maria Elena (Penlope Cruz) the passionate muse and fiery ex-wife who returns when mood suits.

Before long Victoria begins to question her own life; could she live on the other side like Cristina; Carefree. While Cristina questions commitment to any life with either one or two people in it. As for the artist and his ex-wife fire and passion holds the bond but realistically a third party is needed for them to remain harmonic. Could happiness be elusive?

One thing I did notice from the off: Woody Allen had chosen not to give himself an acting role but British actress Rebecca Hall; (Vicky) who does a great american accent for her part, seemed to be playing Woody's part in this film, the mannerisms are more than recognizable here. Other film trademarks are visible like encounters in the street also Cristina's artistic bent, like Annie Hall's so long ago, should be for photography. Also the fact Vicky and Cristina speak in that distinctive indulgent conversational babble which worked quiet well from both actress.

But there is no doubt the Spanish players have it; presence and forthright energy, Javier Bardem as the artist; alpha male; Penlope Cruz clearly stealing the show; everything she does and says seems to mean more, count for more, she certainly walks off with the film and an Oscar.

Summing up: What I loved mostly was the beauty of Barcelona on film, the photography was marvelous. Things I could relate too in this; Victoria taking in the local music played, this is certainly something I'd do; seek out and find wonderful acoustic guitar outside a Caf or Bar. It deals quiet nicely with modern day relationships; in tune with our times this film is PG rated; which would not have been the case maybe ten years ago; dealing with sexual topic's on a PG shows life; moving forward. Overall perfectly watchable; evening in; glass of wine. Three and a half stars I'd give this; I wouldn't put this down as a return to form for Allen; comically speaking, but it's more than a likable film to watch; worth seeing.

But his take on relationships is exceptionally skewed toward the hyper-sexual, and that's even more true here. Some might compare this to his private life, but I'll leave that alone ...for now.

***CONTAINS SPOILERS***

This time we have two women, Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) on vacation in Barcelona, Spain. The two are good friends and Vicky (Hall) is taking a break in preparation for marriage to Doug (Chris Messina), whom she leaves back in the States. Cristina isn't even close to being ready for marriage, and rips through relationships like a laundry woman through sheets. Then the two ladies meet Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) who approaches them with a unique proposal: fly away with him to his house in the north and have sex with him; both of them. At the same time, perhaps. This doesn't surprise Vicky, who immediately labels him a troll with artistic aspirations. But Cristina is intrigued by his forwardness, and the two ladies go with him to his beautiful Spanish home. But Cristina gets sick after eating some bad food, which leaves Vicky and Juan Antonio together, and opposite sparks fly. Then, after Cristina gets better, Juan Antonio takes her into his bed, too. But then a phone call in the middle of the night leads to Juan Antonio's ex-wife, Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz), coming to stay with them after a suicide attempt. Cristina and Juan become closer. His ex-wife and Cristina become closer. Juan Antonio and his ex-wife reignite their passions ...with Cristina getting involved with both of them, if you know what I mean.

Meanwhile, Vicky is struggling to deal with her feelings on the night when she weakened and had sex with Juan Antonio. She begins questioning whether she's ready for marriage. But then Dough, her fianc, comes to Spain with the option to get married there before returning to the States and ""doing it up right.""

***END SPOILERS***

There are quite a few twists and turns in the multiple relationships that wind and unwind themselves. And that is what made most of the story interesting (that and the beautiful people surrounded by the beauty of Barcelona). So you can see why I started my review the way I did. It's mainly about how sexually charged relationships can change (or maybe not change) who we are. Which brings me to my next point: Penelope Cruz's Oscar win for Best Supporting Actress. I'm not gonna take anything away from her. She did a fine job. But she wasn't on-screen very much. Personally, I think Rebecca Hall got gypped during the Oscar's. Her battles for her emotional stability were what kept me watching, not Penelope Cruz. Hall's character was so conflicted that I could empathize with her. While Cruz's character only made me laugh because she seemed almost like a caricature.

Still, it's an interesting film to watch. But it's really just another Woody Allen sex-take on relationships.",1242777600,2,4383,5.828393135725429
3533307,3,B001DJ7PR8,"Hmm I was really interested to see this movie because I figured it could turn out to be anything, I really had no idea what it would be like. It surprised me how light the movie sort of was, I mean it was no chick flick romance comedy but it wasn't nearly as heavy as I thought it might be. Woody Allen is all over the place so I had no idea what to expect. I would definitely compare it to Scoop and also a bit to Matchpoint.

One thing that was kind of weird and distracting to me was that the movie had some narration in it. Not like The Royal Tenebaums Alec Baldwin narration but like the Shopgirl Steve Martin narration, it was just distracting. I think it would have been better with a different voice but I had a hard time following along when there was narration.

I liked all the characters and surprisingly to me I kind of liked Penelop Cruz in this movie, she usually just doesn't do it for me, but this time she did. I loved the scenes between her, Scarlett Johansson and Javier Bardem. Those were the best to me.

Anyhow, the movie was interesting. I feel like ranking it. I thought it was better than Scoop but not as good as Matchpoint. So there is that.",1242518400,2,1169,4.1866666666666665
3533308,2,B001DJ7PR8,"I have never written a review... but this movie really made it mandatory to do so... I was surprised at how bad this movie was... I read the reviews and thought I would still give it a chance- after all it had good actors and although the reviews spoke of their bad performances, I thought they were maybe just dull- instead I actually found watching the movie made me feel just awkward and uncomfortable - all the actors except penelope were very jolty and did not fit with in the setting... Originally, I didn't even get what the reviews meant by this, because it is really hard to imagine just how awkward and terrible it is until you watch it for yourself...
I gave this two stars just because at the end of the movie I understood what the plot had tried to accomplish, but I really almost didn't make it past the first 10 minutes-
In the end it was really a waste of time... Do not watch the movie.. not only is the plot dull but I have not seen this awkward of acting since seeing a movie in a bin of free unknown movies from the early 90s",1242000000,5,1045,4.203980099502488
3533309,5,B001DJ7PR8,"Woody Allen has lost a lot of his initial spark from years past. His self-effacing cynicism has evolved into a somewhat mean-spirited display of cruel behavior. Each of Woody's films have been an homage to one classic director from cinema's past. ""Match Point"", a tribute to Hitchcock, was cold and bleak, with none of Hitchcock's wit and charm. If ""Vicky C B"" is an homage, I would say it is to Eric Rohmer, always devoted to that enigma that is ""love"". Woody has done a fine job here, and the casting is flawless. Rebecca Hall is especially good, but she's ably supported by Scarlett Johasson and Javier Bardem. The DVD I watched had NO extras. It's all silly, and rife with bad decisions, but it isn't until Penelope Cruz explodes on the scene, as the mysterious first wife, Maria Elena, that the film takes off. Unfortunately, her role wasn't as fully realized as I would've liked, but all of her scenes were enjoyable. I have no problem with her Oscar win. All in all, I thought ""VCB"" was more entertaining than most of Woody's recent films. He's still got it, but may be grasping for ideas. I would like to see him parody Alain Resnais as a comedy; that existential confusion of films like ""Last Year at Marienbad"" ('62) could be quite accessible in the hands of the brilliant Mr. Allen. Anyone remember ""What's Up, Tiger Lily?""? NOTE: I read the script of ""Last Year at Marienbad"", with director's notes, and it made sense. First-time viewers of that film can only be perplexed and bored.",1241913600,2,1495,4.645283018867924
3533310,4,B001DJ7PR8,"In his latest romantic escapade, ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" Woody Allen, that wry purveyor of modern relationships, turns sexiness into a purely aesthetic experience.  Of course, that's not all that hard to do when you have a cast of drop-dead gorgeous actors exploring the fine art of love and lovemaking in a drop-dead gorgeous setting.

The two main women in the story represent diametrically opposed views of love and men.  Vicky is the clear-thinking pragmatist who, when it comes to the opposite sex, opts for the stodgy and reliable type over the dashing romantic ideal - a preference reflected in her choice of fiance, the stuffed-shirt Doug, whose dutiful dullness makes him a perfect fit for Vicky`s middlebrow conception of domestic bliss.  Cristina, on the other hand, fancies herself more as the free-living Bohemian type, a gifted amateur photographer who prefers the more ""dangerous"" breed of man - one whose propensity for living life in the moment simmers just beneath the surface of a handsome appearance and a smoldering sexuality.

When they travel to Spain for the summer, the two best friends almost immediately find themselves entangled in a complex romantic relationship with Juan Antonio, an abstract painter who inflames the women with his cultured temperament, his devil-may-care attitude, his smooth-talking ways, his raw animal magnetism and his Old World passion for life.  And as if all that weren't enough, we get a fourth ingredient added to the already spicy brew:  Maria Elena, Juan Antonio's beautiful, volatile and possibly mentally unbalanced ex-wife whom the artist has clearly never gotten over - and apparently never will.

As always, Allen achieves a remarkable complexity both in his characters and in his view of how romantic and sexual attraction actually work.  This is reflected most intensely in the character of Vicky who, after a brief but sizzling encounter with Juan Antonio, comes to question her old willingness to settle for staid conformity and emotional security over all-consuming passion and romance.  This, of course, puts her whole future marriage in jeopardy as well as her friendship with Cristina, once the latter becomes the live-in lover of Juan Antonio.  But Cristina has problems of her own to contend with when an emotionally distraught Maria Elena pops up unexpectedly, taking up residence with the newly formed couple in Juan Antonio`s home.  With each additional twist of the plot, Allen brings new color and depth to his canvas, as now the complexities of Juan Antonio and Maria Elena's self-destructive love/hate relationship suddenly come racing to the fore.

At times the emotions are so raw and close to the bone - and the truths about human relationships so pinpoint in their accuracy - that the movie becomes almost unbearable to sit through.  Or at least it would if the tone itself weren't so consistently scintillating and lighthearted and the setting so eye-popping and sensuous.  In fact, I predict that Barcelona - so richly photographed here by Javier Aguirresarobe -will be experiencing a tourism boom for years to come thanks to this film.

Although Penelope Cruz earned a number of awards (including the Oscar as Best Supporting Actress) for her work as Maria Elena, all the actors in this film - Rebecca Hall, Scarlet Johansson, Javier Bardem, Patricia Clarkson and Chris Messina - deliver rich, outstanding performances.  And it may just be me, but the singsong, deliberately simplistic narration that Allen has attached to the story appears to be an homage of sorts to Truffaut`s ""Jules and Jim,"" probably the most famous romantic roundelay ever committed to film.

The conclusion ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" seems to come to is that NEITHER approach to love really works in the long run - that while too little passion in a relationship may lead to a life of endless regrets over unrealized possibilities, too much passion can result in burnout, serial infidelity and mutual self-destruction for the individuals involved.

Perhaps, Friar Lawrence's advice to the impetuous Romeo and Juliet - ""Therefore, love moderately: long love doth so; too swift arrives as tardy as too slow"" - was right after all.",1241827200,4,4195,5.178994082840236
3533311,2,B001DJ7PR8,"Thank goodness this movie was set in gorgeous Barcelona and gave us something interesting to look at while suffering through this lame story (it has been too, too long since Allen has told a compelling one).  Penelope Cruz out-acted everyone else, stealing every scene she was in and dwarfing the usually wonderful Scarlett Johansson.  The best moment in the film was the expressions on Vicky and Cristina's faces as they left Spain.",1241481600,,433,5.0
3533312,1,B001DJ7PR8,"A totally plot-less and pointless movie with shallow characters and ridiculous dialogue.  I rented this to watch with my wife because we love Woody Allen and she loves romantic comedies, but this film was a complete disappointment.  This was nothing more than a tedious ""art film"" lacking the art.  It was neither sexy or poignant or sensitive or even fun.

When the movie ended we just looked at each other and said ""what the hell was that?"".

One of the worst movies we've seen in many years.",1241481600,9,494,4.632183908045977
3533313,4,B001DJ7PR8,"Before I saw this film I wondered about the strange title: Vicky, Cristina Barcelona.  The title refers to two young American women, Vicki (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johanssen), lifelong friends who travel together to Barcelona to spend a summer of discovery.  Vicki, engaged to a straight as an arrow, tightly controlled young corporate executive, is a graduate student researching ""Catalan Identity"". Cristina, more free-wheeling and open to life's opportunities, is in search of adventure and her own identity.

They meet an uninhibited, passionate artist (Javier Bardem), who ultimately seduces them both and exposes them to a culture, lifestyle and thinking that has profound impacts on their lives and dreams.  Penelope Cruz as the artist's ex-wife, Maria Elena, is exceptional as an artist driven by wild passionate moods, unable to live with or without her ex-husband.

Like most of Woody Allen's films, this is a story about angst, insecurity and relationships.  It is one of his best and the background of Barcelona is magnificent.  Oddly, all the women reminded me of different aspects of Mia Farrow, Woody's ex-wife and muse who starred in so many of his films.  I could almost see or hear her in each female role.

One of the things I enjoyed most about this film was the narration.  Allen has used this technique successfully before and it enhanced this film as well. It is as though someone is reading a story to you, yet the Director is providing the necessary visual images.  This is neither a happy or sad film but rather a realistic view and acceptance of life without rose colored glasses.",1241308800,2,1620,5.0299625468164795
3533314,3,B001DJ7PR8,"The film was interesting, all the acting was good, the tiring Woody ""too much talking"" was typical, Penelope was cast well in this role - but nothing ""oscar worthy"" here . .???  Disappointed in that.",1240876800,,199,4.685714285714286
3533315,4,B001DJ7PR8,"Penelope Cruz might have won the Oscar for her brief but explosive performance, but it's Rebecca Hall that dominates this film.  Having seen it, I'm stunned more people aren't talking about her performance.  It is nothing less than brilliant, shaded with complex nuances and emotions right down to the last fade-out scene with the anguished look on her face as she walks away from her what-might-have-been with Javier Bardem's character.  Of course, the excellence of her performance is thrown into greater relief by the near-in comparison with Scarlett Johansson.  Woody Allen is obviously smitten; many of the rest of us...not so much.

I'm not a great fan of Allen, but he's in top form here.  I especially loved the way that the initial presence of Bardem hovered off-screen while the female characters whispered excitedly and furtively about him.  You think:  this guy better be something else.  When he's first shown -  wordlessly - my wife gasped.

The same with Allen's direction of Cruz's appearance:  45 minutes into a move clocked in at a tidy 1 hour 38 minutes, the divine Ms. P had yet to make an appearance.  I thought to myself ""Wow, she must come into this film like a ball of fire.""  Indeed.  For those of us used to Cruz' knockout performances in her native tongue (see Pedro Almodvar's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Volver/dp/B000N3T0DW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Volver</a>&nbsp;foremost), it's wonderful to see her ability on display in an English language film.

By the way, the sleeve blurb on my rented copy described Cruz' character as ""insanely jealous"" about her ex-husband (Bardem).  Viewers will agree: she's not insanely jealous, just flat-out insane.

One additional observation:  parts of Christopher Evan Welch's voice-over could serve as a commercial for Spain.  The country itself is like a fifth main character in the film.",1240704000,12,1904,5.389830508474576
3533316,1,B001DJ7PR8,"I am glad that I saw this movie on a plane and didn't spend good money to see this turkey.  I think that what Woodie Allen had to say he said years ago and should be banned from ever making another film.  I am a fan of all the actors and they did well with the stupid script the had to work with, but none of the roles were even worth a nomination.",1240531200,8,348,3.7534246575342465
3533317,2,B001DJ7PR8,"We usually like Woody Allen.  But this movie lacked a point.  I would say it was a waste of talent but it was the type of movie that made me wonder if the actors WERE talented.  Scarlett Johansson always plays a cool, detached character and she was no different here. She is good to look at but there was no passion.  Javier Bardem is an attractive actor but his characters are easy to dislike. And there was no chemistry between most of them.  The Americans in this film are all archetypal.  Penelope Cruz deserved her award; she added a much-needed spark.  But this film went nowhere.  And to think I used to be annoyed when English teachers would say, ""What is the purpose of this story?""

If one cannot really like ANY of the characters, it is very hard to like a film.  I don't like to accuse the truly great Woody Allen of self-indulgence but I think here he needs focus. The photography aspect (Cristina's) could have and should have gone somewhere.  I got the feeling that this was an old script, resurrected.  It was not, unless it came from the bottom of the writer's trunk, but it was anachronistic.

The scenery was delightful.  Wish there had been even more Gaudi.

So I'll give it two stars.",1240272000,3,1205,4.463302752293578
3533318,2,B001DJ7PR8,"What an insufferable film from an equally insufferable director.  Woody Allen has lost whatever humor and cultural significance that he may have once had, if only tenuously.  Barcelona, the city and its spirit, are reduced to a Let's Go postcard under his care.  Not comical, not provocative, aesthetically conventional, the film essentially smears Europe's most beautiful ""ciutat.""  Let us count its many oozing blemishes: a flat and not effectively ironic narrator (the technique and voice nauseate), a pervasive neurotic New Yaakness (ie. Allen's tired aura) which infects all the actors, including Bardem, and the now tiresome comparison of bohemian and bourgeois values.  The actors don't have the humor or presence to hold up such a trite plot.  Unintentionally, we Americans, represented here by some truly abyssmal acting, are once again seen as uniformly banal.  The scene in which Johannson kvetches ad nauseum on the plane trip back from Oviedo is truly painful.  The one saving grace is Penelope Cruz.  With a matador's stare she jabs her nymphfetish ""guapa"" rival, played by Johannson, who can mutter just one foreign phrase, in Chinese: ""You think that sounds pretty?""  In customary form Cruz sizzles, her hair dishevelled in a tangle of black, a cigarette dangling precariously from lips that speak without speaking.  She's the only thing worth watching in this disaster, save the architecture and light of the Catalan capital.",1240185600,3,1442,5.308370044052864
3533319,4,B001DJ7PR8,"With Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Woody Allen has created yet another drop-the-viewer-in-the-middle-of-someone's-life story.  I like it.

If nothing else, there's much to love about the setting of the story.  I love Barcelona...lot's of fond memories.

But back to the movie. With a cast of strange and engaging characters (though only superficially), it's easy to let the light storyline string you along.  The extent to which we come to know each of the characters is limited to the voice over narration of following each.  Of the actors, Penelope Cruz was superb, but I love most anything she's in.

Allen doesn't really make any effort to delve into the real implications of the choices each of these people make, but that didn't bother me as such.  I felt like I was reading a dime-store pulp book and perhaps it's the guilty pleasure feeling I got from watching this movie that made it so fun in the end.",1240099200,,907,4.8441558441558445
3533320,2,B001DJ7PR8,"Under the veneer of a tale of interwoven relationships, this is an attempt to glorify dysfunctional and self-destructive behavior at the expense of what one of the actors calls ""puritanical values"". Characters that live a traditional lifestyle are portrayed as empty and vapid, while those engaging in spurious casual relationships are presented as exciting and self-fulfilled. Despite this, things do not go well for the 'wild ones'. My suspicion is that in real life, things would have gone even more badly.

Penelope Cruz does a wonderful acting job as the psychotic ex-wife; Javier Bardem does nearly as well as the contemporary Casanova. I don't get the point of Scarlet Johansson, but maybe that's just me. Bottom line - it kept my attention for the duration, despite 'chick-flicks' not being my usual genre.

I really hated this movie.  I couldn't relate to or understand any of the characters and found their lack of morals sad and off-putting.  Rebecca Hall was good as Vicky, but Scarlett Johansson wasn't believable at all as Cristina.  She looked like she was just sleepwalking through the movie, adlibbing her lines without emotion.  As the artist, Javier Bardem was supposed to be completely irresistible, but he didn't appeal to me at all.  Penelope Cruz had a small part as the artist's ex-wife; she was exciting and passionate and I wish her part had been bigger.

Though the movie is all about sex, it was tedious and distasteful. It wasn't funny enough to be a comedy and it lacked any truly touching  moments. The DVD has no extras.  All in all, a disappointment.",1239840000,,963,4.712574850299402
3533322,5,B001DJ7PR8,"It's a thorough delight.  Scarlett Johansson said in an interview that working on this film with Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz was even more fun because they came to the set having spent a lot of time improvising together and developing their problematic film relationship.  The result is more fun than a circus:  Bardem and Cruz are radioactive on the screen, teasing up the tension and riding it like a pair of daredevil surfers on a cresting wave.  Johansson contributes the missing ingredient to the film just as to the fictional relationship, nevertheless sliding through the thorny plot as if Teflon-coated.  Rebecca Hall and Bardem's continuing game of ""No, I mean maybe"" & ""Why are you lying?"" creates an undercurrent of unease throughout the film, and the sly male voice-over is delightful.  I see something new in this film every time I watch it.  And, the musical score is wonderful.  We all want to go to Barcelona now.",1239321600,,933,4.860759493670886

Vicky Christina Barcelona is no exception. While some reviewers found this movie `sombre' in fact I laughed a lot, much more than in `Match Point' for example, but there is no doubt that Woody Allen has a dark side. I get the feeling whenever I watch a film of his that underneath it all there is something unhealthy going on. This is well disguised by the humour but pessimism and sexual hang-ups as well as genius blend in with this very interesting, very flawed and very brilliant director.",1239321600,,655,4.6068376068376065
3533324,4,B001DJ7PR8,"The movie Vicky Cristina Barcelona, produced in 2008 and starring Rebecca Hall as Vicky, Scarlett Johansson as Cristina, Javier Bardem as Juan Antonio and Penelope Cruz as Maria Elena, is a story about two good friends, Vicky and Cristina, and their summer getaway to Spain. Once in Spain the two girls meet Juan Antonio, a sort of Spanish Casanova with very liberal views on love and relationships. Both girls get involved with Juan Antonio and eventually with Maria Elena, his somewhat crazy ex-wife. Vicky has one night of passion with Juan Antonio and develops feelings for him but is torn between him and the commitment to her fiance whom she eventually marries in Barcelona. Juan Antonio then starts a relationship with Cristina which leads to great chemistry, since they share a passion for life, art, and similar views on love. Then, Maria Elena comes to live with Juan Antonio and Cristina after she overdosed on pills and that starts a strange three-way relationship between Cristina, Juan Antonio and Maria Elena. Everything seems well until Cristina realizes this is not what she wants and decides to return to America with Vicky, who has settled to remain with her new husband rather than follow through with her feelings for Juan Antonio. Both Vicky and Cristina return to America feeling the same way they had at the beginning of the movie.

Vicky is presented at the beginning of the movie as a girl that knows what she wants.  She knows what she wants, plans for it, and gets it.  She like stability and predictability. In love, Vicky values much the same things like stability, commitment and even predictability to some extent. She is very sensible even though sh pretends to not be the type to get carried away with the right romantic setting. Cristina likes many of the same things Vicky does we are told at the beginning of the movie but leads a completely different lifestyle. Cristina likes spontaneity and avoids predictability at all costs. She is not sure what she wants out of life and tries her hand at many artistic pursuits in search of her niche. I love she is only sure of what she does not want: Vicky's love life. Cristina seems to expect any truly passionate and worthwhile romance to inevitably lead to pain and so seem s to prefer these types of risky romances.

Throughout the movie, the two girls seem to serve as each others balancing opposite. Vicky is the voice of reason that Cristina needs to hear from time to time and Cristina adds a little excitement to Vicky's rather predictable life. It is strange to see just how well these to characters get along together being so fundamentally different and this may be the reason that they work so well together. They understand each other, perhaps, because each one is what the other wishes they were like. Towards the end Vicky almost takes that risk to go with Juan Antonio, as Cristina would have done, which shows that despite her better knowledge she was willing to take the risk. In the end reality sinks in to both girls and they return to their normal lives. Vicky playing it safe and Cristina still only sure of what she did not want.",1239062400,,3133,4.732600732600733

3533326,5,B001DJ7PR8,"The first serious filmmaker who paid full attention around the complex feminine world was Ingmar Bergman (""The silence"" and ""Persona""), but when Robert Bresson threw his hat to arena with Mouchette (1967), we should wait for Francois Truffaut, Luis Bunuel, Lina Wertmuller, Liliana Cavani The Von Trotta sisters, Percy Aldon  and Rainer Fassbinder during the seventies and eighties the feminine affections resided in Europe as the main gravity creative center. But since the middle eighties, (since Fassbinder's death) the old continent seemed to have given up as main creative exponent (until the successful arrival of ""The scent of green papaya"" and ""Amelie"") and since then only a fist of selected films have dealt with the emotional feminine universe. As a matter of fact, after the extraordinary Robert Van Ackeren's  ""The woman in flames""(1984), the American cinema has turned its attention around the countless narrative possibilities of this genre. We could cite Norman Jewison's ""Moonstruck"" (1987),  Donald Petrie's ""Mystic pizza"", (1988), Herbert Ross' ""Steel magnolias"" (1989),  Rob Reiner's ""Misery"" (1990)"", Ridley Scott's ""Thelma and Louise"" (1991) and "" Paul Verhoven ""Basic instinct"" (1992).  But besides, it would be convenient to remark : in South America there were two names of egregious significance:  the unforgettable Maria Luisa Bamberg's  ""Camila"", who passed away in 1992 and the Venezuelan Fina Torres (Oriana our maxim awarded film in Cannes). Both of them explored the feminine nostalgia from different perspectives.

Allen has bet again for this distant and European gaze project. The first release was ""Match Point"". A worthy and honest proposal, that intends to give birth a new and warm breadth to a variegated crowd of commonplaces in his beloved and admired NYC.

 ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is far to be an original proposal. After having explored the conflictive and tempestuous relation in ""Mighty Aphrodite"" with Mira Sorvino (who coincidentally won the Academy Award as best Supporting Actress) Woody Allen seems to have been inspired by two almost forgotten Truffaut's films ""Two English girls"" (1972) and Ken Russell's ""Women in love"" (1970) and a more recent Romantic comedy starred by Diane Lane, ""Under the Tuscan sun (2003).""

So he retells a contemporary amorous quartet. An underground painter (Javier Bardem) (signed by a dark affair with her conflictive couple; Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz)) establishes direct contact with two North American girls the alluring Cristina (Scarlet Johansson) a girl who really knows what she doesn't want, a liberal and free thinker, avid to experience in own flesh the Spanish passion far beyond the architecture and the guitar, a modern Aphrodite and her friend Vicky, the mother Goddess who is committed with her North American fianc&eacute;e.

This painter is not only a self biographical depiction of his director ; besides epitomizes the ancestral seduction codes and arouses in both of them the mysterious ""taste of the forbidden"". In last instance, Allen once more, carves in relief the impossibility for reaching the happiness through the love, due every one of us - and specially the complex feminine universe - expects of this feeling. The arresting landscapes work out and invite as silent background in which the relation of power and self destructive possession, the fascination for the exotic and the breakthrough of the quotidian find in Maria Elena, Cristina and Vicky an interesting but unexpected cocktail of unthinkable passions and a web of questions without answers.

The last shot of the film is hardly eloquent. Those missing gazes of both of them talk by themselves.",1239062400,,3673,5.36695652173913
3533327,3,B001DJ7PR8,"I have been reviewing Woody Allen productions in this space over the past year or so. I have highly rated such old Woody classics as ""Annie Hall, ""Manhattan"" and ""Radio Days"", those memorable films with New York City its trials, tribulations and traumas as an epicenter. I have also given mixed reviews to some of his later productions like ""Manhattan Mystery"" and others based in other geographic locales (""Purple Rose Of Cairo"", etc.). I was, however, fully prepared to fulsomely praise the film under review, ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"", after having heard the hype about Penelope Cruz's performance as, Maria Elena, the talented estranged artsy wife of the central male character, Juan Antonia (Javier Bardem), a Spanish avant guarde artist. After viewing the film Ms. Cruz's performance was certainly Oscar-worthy. Nevertheless the overall production falls flat. And here is why.

Woody Allen has created an important cinematic niche for himself as a performer, director, writer and producer in that netherworld of the alienated modern urbanite, especially of distracted women unsure of their place in the world and their ability to navigate it with (or without) a man. The classic examples of such angst and confusion were various film vehicles created for Diane Keaton (""Annie Hall"") Mia Farrow (""Broadway Danny Rose"", ""Stardust Memories"") and along the way Woody himself, his doubts and his inhibitions (in about six billion of his films starting with ""Take The Money And Run""). Here Woody has gathered the old familiar concerns about sexual inhibitions, the vacuity of upper middle class suburban life, the eternal problems with the opposite sex and various social conventions like bisexuality, adultery, threesomes and the like. All very familiar Woody material, although not always set in Barcelona.

With the above-mentioned exception of Ms. Cruz the other characters are Woody's stock and trade of late: young woman with various personal and social problems, with or without Woody as conduit. The truly beautiful and talented Scarlett Johansson is wooden here as Cristina. The lesser known actress, Rebecca Hall, playing Vicky's role is the same. In the end I did not care whether the two women (or three, if we include Ms. Cruz) got their issues resolved, or not. That is not a good sign in a Woody Allen film where in earlier, better films , if nothing else, we are at least left wondering about their fates. Woody, come back to your New York hearth and home with all its tangled energies, excitement, enigmas and hangups. There you are ""king of the hill"". Leave Europe for the kids.",1238976000,,2597,5.137115839243499
3533328,3,B001DJ7PR8,"Although this movie has garnered more than its share of rave reviews I confess myself somewhat puzzled.  It's a pleasant romp through familiar Woody Allen territory, though thankfully minus Allen himself as the primary protagonist and thankfully not set in Manhattan.  There are essentially three human characters in the movie. The first is The Romantic Artist, here incarnated in cliched form as Juan Antonio and his ex-wife Maria Elena. Then comes American Woman, here incarnated not only as the two young American tourists but also as their elder female hostess.  Finally comes American Man, uniformly drab and materialistic and rather dim, incarnated as the the male host and the guy from New York whom Vicky will end up marrying and additionally, in case the point wasn't made obviously enough, the male half of a couple that makes a brief over-dinner appearance full of chatter about expensive houses and entertainment systems. The fourth character - if we want to stretch the point just a little - is Barcelona, or at least a tourist's notion of the city-as-backdrop.

Allen's point seems to be that American women are incapable of really engaging with life.  Vicky holds life at bay through a series of elaborate quasi-intellectual charades in which she always misses the key point. Christina, who seems more willing to throw herself into the stream of life and let it carry her, in fact always extricates herself at the moment when she'd have to commit to really living.  As the movie puts it, ""she didn't know what she wanted, but she knew what she didn't want."" And finally the hostess is living one of those lives of quiet desperation, too afraid to leave a dead marriage and too afraid to begin an affair.  Likewise American Man is the walking dead.  Only the Artist - in this case the Spanish binary star of Maria Elena and Juan Antonio - is willing to risk all (health, sanity, relationships) to swim with the currents of life.

This is, however, a fairly humdrum theme around which to try to wrap a movie.  Barcelona, which is one of the world's great cities, makes a vague and fleeting appearance from time to time but the air pollution precludes sweeping panoramas and the camera work is so uninspired that the street shots could have been done almost anywhere.  The dialog is authentically banal and without great camera work there's little to draw us into the movie and carry us along.  The overall issue is that there simply isn't much of interest in the tale of two American female tourists who are so wrapped up in their own neuroses that they utterly fail to be changed by their summer experiences.  We already know that Americans are, in general, repressed and that they cling to sterile and restrictive ""appropriate"" norms in order to navigate the strange world that otherwise might overwhelm them.  We already know that people who work in Manhattan are, for the most part, acquisitive empty shells. And frankly few of us will buy Allen's thesis that The Great Artist holds the keys to anything other than a barn full of pretentious canvases.

On the bright side Penelope Cruz does yeoman work as the histrionic Maria Elena and the quite dramatic consumption of cigarettes in the movie must have boosted the share price of at least one tobacco company.

This is an inoffensive but essentially empty movie in which little happens and less is achieved. If this is all Allen has to say after so long, perhaps it's time to head for the Old Moviemakers' Rest Home.",1238976000,,3485,4.812395309882747
3533329,1,B001DJ7PR8,"I rented this movie not knowing it was directed by Woody Allen.  I will from now on make sure I look at who directed the movies I get.

3533330,5,B001DJ7PR8,"In ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"", Woody Allen explores yet another variation on his central theme of complex sexual relationships, but this time through the lens of the tourist's camera. The tourist is Scarlett Johansson in her role as the restless Cristina, who has no idea what, exactly, she is compulsively seeking through the lens of her digital camera (Metaphorically, she begins to catch a glimpse of it only after she exchanges digital for film.). Both Cristina and her intellectual best friend, Vicky (Rebecca Hall), arrive in Barcelona, where they are quickly captivated by the attentions of an aspiring artist (Javier Bardem), who is encumbered by baggage--the baggage in question being his suicidal/homicidal wife, Maria Elena (played to the hilt by Penelope Cruz).

Through the splendid cinematography of Javier Aguirresarobe, Allen makes it evident that the two friends are seduced as much by the spell of Spain in general--with its ""gently weeping"" guitars, midnight tapas and golden wines--and Barcelona in particular--with its magnificent art and architecture, ingredients that render the scenario, which in a more mundane setting would seem improbable, plausible. In other words, the city--the third ingredient of the title--works its magic both on characters and viewers, who are able to suspend their disbelief as one tends to do when actually traveling to the enchanting cities of southern Europe. Allen demonstrates this proposition with Vicky's husband and his friends who discuss nothing but computers and business affairs while her thoughts drift away with the notes of a classical Spanish guitar.

Some reviewers have criticized the voice-over, but as far as I'm concerned, this straightforward device lent the film an old-fashioned charm. Others have criticized the intrusion of Woody Allen's narrative voice into the dialogue. And yes, there certainly are lines that one can ""hear"" Woody Allen reciting, but such intrusions made the film all the more enjoyable for me; and I suppose that the enjoyment of this film will depend on whether one likes Woody Allen's humor, or not. To some it may seem like the same old schtick; to others [as in the case of his title ""Vicky Cristina""], Allen's idiosyncratic brand of humor represents the third ingredient without which his film would not seem complete.",1238889600,4,2322,5.341530054644808
3533331,3,B001DJ7PR8,"I won't delve into the plot, acting, scenery, editing and everything else that constitutes a movie. Plenty other reviewers do that. This movie didn't have to be believable (the grad student who knows little Spanish and spends no time in the library) or particularly witty (wow, did a character actually use the phrase ""turgid argument about the categorical imperative""?)....I was just irritated that every character sounded like Woody Allen! Whiney, self-absorbed, quick to moralize about everything objectionable....could the man get out in the real world and listen to how other people talk? Heck, even reading a book by Richard Price might help him....",1238803200,2,655,5.368932038834951
3533332,3,B001DJ7PR8,"I do not understand why there is a voiceover narration in this movie.  It is distracting.  The narrator's voice itself is rather nasal and not at all pleasant on the ears.  It seems as if Woody Allen was attempting to emulate the ironic detachment and science-doc parody narrator of the far superior&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Children/dp/B000N3SU92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Children</a>.  He fails.  The voiceover is NEVER used appropriately.  At times, it actually impairs the performance of the actors.  In one scene, for example, it tells us that a character is drunk.  When you hire an Oscar winner like Javier Bardem, it seems safe to assume that he can play drunk convincingly, and that we don't need a narrator to tell us this.  And if for some reason he can't do it, maybe all the empty wine glasses helpfully supplied by the prop department can clue us in.  At other times, the voiceover carries us forward in time, or sets up a scene.  A good writer can accomplish that with a few lines of exposition hidden in the dialogue, and a good director can accomplish it with a montage or some nifty editing.  If I could ask Woody Allen one question about this movie, it would be why he suddenly felt he wasn't equal to that task, and instead needed this wholly intrusive narrator to do his job for him.

Narration aside, I enjoyed the film.  It's just a fun, frothy, frisky romp though the Spanish countryside.  The background is even more attractive than the cast.  The premise is a little trite and the characters are paper-thin, but it certainly met my entertainment quotient, and my expectations.  This in spite of the fact that, as is apparently usual with Woody Allen's DVD releases, there are zero extras.

Oh, and as for that recent Oscar win?  Penelope Cruz didn't deserve it.  Her performance is all flash -- no substance, and no heart.",1238716800,,1914,4.996835443037975
3533333,3,B001DJ7PR8,"It's nice to see Woody shooting in an exotic setting, but there's little here of Barcelona proper aside from a brief sampling of Gaudi architecture and a scenic street/alleyway.  Several scenes appear to be of the Rambla, but they are tight shots, not long shots, so one does not have the full effect.  That is not to say that the film is not beautiful.  It is simply not an extended, loving portrait of Barcelona.  That is somewhat surprising, since the film is part 'Americans Abroad' in the sun, getting into romantic situations they would otherwise avoid and part Almodovar, with passionate lovers fondling one another one moment and shooting at one another the next.  The 'Americans Abroad' theme dominates.  Its separate scenes are linked by an ongoing voiceover which I found to be intrusive and inauthentic.  The film comes alive when Penelope Cruz enters, but the film lacks the exquisite script, urgency and momentum that one expects from Almodovar.

Sadly, the film is very disappointing. The premise is somewhat ridiculous, with two American women in Barcelona being crudely propositioned at a restaurant by a moody Spanish painter with a ""past."" Soon they're in a private jet with him for a little interlude in a quiet town.

The character Cristina (Scarlett Johannson) is a scatterbrained neurotic who will sleep with anyone who gives her attention, so it's plausible she would fall for the Spaniard's tired line. But it's absolutely incredible that the level-headed, and engaged, Vicky (Hall) would hit the mattress with him. Is Vicky so bored by her one-dimensional husband-to-be that she'll bed a total stranger? Is this a ""what happens in Barcelona stays in Barcelona"" scenario?

As to Penelope Cruz's performance as the painter's estranged and suicidal-homicidal wife, it's OK, but it's nowhere near the stellar acting of Amy Adams or Viola Davis of Doubt. Both ladies were robbed at Oscar time this year.",1238457600,,1167,5.067708333333333

He is quite simply our Ingmar Bergman and as such deserves all the praise he gets and then some. From the low farce and Catskill schtick of Bananas and the Sex comedies through the darkness of Crimes, Hannah and Her Sisters and Manhatten, no one in American cinema has the range of Woody. While I liked Matchpoint I thought it finally a Woody gimmick piece not unlike Purple Rose of Cairo (which I really loved anyway) and Broadway Danny Rose.  But this latest piece Vicky Christina Barcelona was truly an exercise in modern existential loneliness and isolation.  It isn't so much about Henry James' lost Americans abroad as it is about how none of us can find the happiness we seek even when it is there for the taking.  Sartre says, ""Each man must undergo his own death"" and for all the laughs and romance VCB is finally about the aloneness that is the human condtion and even when we are surrounded by beautiful music and beautiful art we will finally go to the airport in search of the unhappiness we so richly deserve.

3533344,5,B001DJ7PR8,"Woody Allen has produced an excellent film for thinking adults in Vicky Cristina Barcelona. I say this because he is able to capture much of the paradox of relationships as two young women in their 20s begin to explore what they want from life and from their relationships.

The character of Vicky, played wonderfully by Rebecca Hall, is a young woman who plays it safe most of the time. However a short and unexpected fling with artist Juan Antonio, played by Javier Bardem, opens up emotional doors for her that she can't close with her rational mind. Vicky and her good friend Cristina are staying at the home of Vicki's family friends, where Vicky accidentally sees the wife in the embrace of her Spanish lover. Patricia Clarkson plays the middle aged woman who tries to explain to Vicky why she has taken a lover and then begins to take the role of advisor to Vicky so that Vicky doesn't make the same mistake of marriage for stability rather than passion.

Cristina on the other hand moves in with the artist and his mentally unstable wife, Maria Elena, played by Penelope Cruz.  Despite all the freedom, drama and sex, in the end Cristina sadly learns that they are a highly dependent couple, passionate about each other, but so unstable that they can not maintain a solid relationships.

In the end we might expect Vicky to learn from her experiences with Juan Antonio and drop her wealthy privileged boyfriend, Doug. Or we might expect Cristina to learn some lessons about dependency and stability from living in a 3-way relationship with Juan Antonio and Maria Elena. But this is a Woody Allen film and behind the wry humor Woody is a wise philosopher. For in the end we can only learn from our own mistakes and unfortunately we often have to make the same mistakes repeatedly before our foolish hearts get a clue.

This is excellent film making. The film is warm and sunny and often shot outdoors, exploring the Catalan landscape. The architecture of Gaudi pops up here and there in scenes in Parc Guell or Sagrada Familia.

All the actors were in top form with Rebecca Hall emerging to the top with a subtle performance of a naive and insecure young woman playing the role of a determined and stable woman. Scarlett Johansson is excellent as the risk taking young woman who gradually understands that she is the third party to a highly dynamic mutually dependent relationship which really holds no future for her. Javier Bardem is very good as an intelligent, intuitive, man who finds he can't live in peace with his soul mate. Penelope Cruz is superb as a volatile dramatic creative woman who struggles against her own dependency needs. Last of all, Patricia Clarkson is excellent as the older woman who has been there and done that and now wishes that others would not make the same mistakes.",1237680000,10,2806,4.716326530612245

3533351,5,B001DJ7PR8,"The self is not something one finds. It's something one creates.

""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a fun and funny satire on America's mainstream culture. Love, sex, female/male identity in search of the meaning of life, and the possibility of passion. It is definitely just a beginning of the journey. Young, we just start scratching the surface of who we are. Men are dull and women are clueless.

In an authority based society man thinks that woman knows something and waits for instructions on what to do or for an approval. Woman believes that man is in control and fight the phantom. Just like in politics we think that the government knows something or that banks are in control and pass the responsibilities to someone else. And then we suffer, and we feel sorry for ourselves and wait for something else to come alone.

In today's financial crisis, it may look like America is suffering from greed but if you get a closer look, you may see that it is more likely that we are suffering from boredom and a identity crisis.

Think about it, what would even the best of the best American men do if he did not have a ""money game"" or a ""war game"" to play? Nothing right?

So far ""The Star Wars"" is the only common ground for Americulture. What do we believe in besides  war? What do we stand for besides money? So, maybe by the good fortune, solving the Global Environmental crisis is the next adventure that will redefine US culture, and will give it unity.

Crisis is always a good thing.

In literature the word crisis has another name - ""climax."" Climax is when the hero changes his value system through new action.

Action has been a measure of truth across all ages.

""Vicky-Cristina"" is drifting, man is bored in the board room. Strangely American man will do anything to get the money but would not lift a finger to get a woman, or understand the woman, or to hold on to the woman. Who was it that said that the family is the basic unit of society and that the easiest way to change society is to change the family dynamics.

Change creates change.

To change a personal or cultural identity will take tons of self-awareness and internal power. The good news is that being a young culture, America also has all the benefits of the youth - abundant energy, flexibility, and puppy enthusiasm for the new. This time, the new is a new game, and the one who makes the new rules is the one who will lead the game.

Where is no passion there is no compassion.

We understand what we love, we love to understand. Like a soldier is never ready for peace the businessman is never ready for love.

Strangely only sex makes American man more human, and connects him to a woman. No wonder we confuse sex with connection and glue ourselves to every passer by or a computer screen.

We stroke our troubles with the feather of small talk, we afraid to cut through to the heart of the problems to split it open. We search for proof of life in money, and objects, and forget that only connected world is real.

There is a slight sense of irony in the movie: life is passing by just like a cloud on the blue sky. What would it take to bring these people to life? Maybe it will be a world economic crisis, or it could be green revolution. WiserEarth needs wiser people, just a bit more curiosity, passion and trust in its own power. Freedom simply means flexible rules and flexible actions to get what you want and know what you need. Time to raise the bar.",1236643200,,3445,4.434231378763867

The acting is superb and the scenery of Barcelona is just absolutely beautiful; felt like I was actually there. The cinematography is outstanding!  It is also one of the better moves I have seen in years, and I sometimes think movies just are not that great anymore. However, this is no action movie and the dialog is very important.  My husband did not like the movie - so I have to assume it is more of a ""chick flick,"" although I am sure many males would also appreciate this one.",1236470400,,598,4.36036036036036

3533354,3,B001DJ7PR8,"... Okay, okay, the twits are not bad looking, but I learned long ago, the hard way, that looks aren't everything. I could, if I wanted to start a fight in the comment thread, propose that Woody Allen intended us to take his two escapees from ""Friends"" as a biting satire of the airy-fairy mentality of young American women of a certain generation. From that perspective, I'd call VCB a great movie, or at least ""not bad at all."" Honestly, though, I can't say that I would have chosen to spend almost two hours ""in the company"" of that pair of vacuities! Hey, here's this product of American education, this tall willowy walking proof that at least 'one woman IS an island,' who is majoring in ""Catalan Soul"" or some such recreational pretense of learning, who can't speak Spanish at all! Not even as much Spanish as a Guatemalan gardener speaks English after a month in Scarsdale! That's Vicky. Then there's Christina. I'd believe the portrayal of Christina if only she had 'cutter' scars on her arms.

The tour guide isn't Javier Bardem, if that's what you're thinking. It's that mealy-mouthed narrator! That twangy American accent, let's suppose generously, is part of the satire, which is intended to remind of of the pedagogical films shown in American foreign language classes. Oh, you think it was a stylish touch of cinema, do you? Que nocin tan ingenua!

As for Bardem, well... Woody Allen's projections and wishful self-images have gotten tedious long since, but perhaps this time he's over-reached.

I've lived in Spain, by the way, in the university city of Salamanca. I found nothing very evocative or realistic about the sketches of Spain in this film, from the few scenes involving Spaniards other than as passing pedestrians, to the living spaces of the characters, to the travelogue photography of Barcelona and Oviedo.

This is the sort of film that I like less and less the more I think of it. It was watchable, in a desultory way, given that I'd paid for it, but if I'd been watching it alone, I would have turned it off in favor of a book.",1236384000,5,2060,4.713888888888889
3533355,3,B001DJ7PR8,"Woody Allen's ""Vicki Cristina Barcelona"" is a frustrating mix of a movie.  On the surface, it is smart (Woody Allen, after all), beautifully shot in one of the world's most gorgeous locations - Barcelona and the surrounding Spanish countryside - and filled with talented, glorious actors.

But ultimately, the movie has an emptiness at its core that rankles - namely, why are these people so unhappy?

The story revolves around two ladies who just don't know how good they have it.  If you are beautiful, rich, and able to ""live well,"" you should be thankful and able to suck the marrow out of life.  And yet Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) perpetually frown and quibble with life's minor details as they spend the summer in Barcelona (for free!) as they crash at a friend's spectacular villa.

Most of us would feel as if we'd won the Lottery of Life to spend a summer like this.  Things get even better when gorgeous artist Juan Gonzalo (Javier Bardem) propositions the duo with a sex romp - coming from him, it's charming rather than sleazy.  This ultimately leads to romantic crises for both Vicky as she cheats on her hum-drum fiance with Juan and Cristina as she gets involved in a love triangle with Juan and his ex-wife, Maria (Penelope Cruz, in her Oscar-winning role).

Throughout the movie, you want to scream at these beautiful people living beautiful lives - why aren't you happy????  Things are just too good to be believed - nobody seems to lack for funds, nobody has a bad job, and everybody is a cover model.  The nagging unreality of it all ultimately undermines the movie's ruminations on life, happiness, and relationships.

Imagine, if you will, you strive to be a bohemian artist in Europe.  You find yourself living in a villa with Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz, developing your art and having sex with two of the most beautiful people alive (as a friend of mine said, the scenes with Bardem and Cruz had both her straight and lesbian friends throwing [.........] at the screen).  How on earth could you ever conclude, ""this is not enough for me""?  Yet it happens in this movie.

I really, really wanted to love this movie, and while I can admire its craft - can I be the location scouter for Woody's next movie, or help light the sets? - the fact that these people are so far removed from any real universe neuters the movie.  The blame lies not with the actors - they are each radiant and talented - but with the yawning void of self-centered narcissism inside each character.  When Vicki and Cristina waltz off in the final scene, all I could say was ""good riddance.""",1236384000,,2618,4.666666666666667
3533356,3,B001DJ7PR8,"Let me start with saying that, despite the overall premesis of the movie which I found rather degrading, unrealistic, and a bit confusing, I actually found the acting to be decent(well . .they made implausible personas almost seem plausible . .almost) Second of all, I must admit that I did not the entire movie . . .I friggin LEFT after awhile (I stayed for most of it as it turned out....)...I just couldn't take it anymore. The main dude, the Spanish ""artist"" is pretty much is a hedonist aka ""man-whore"" aka ""man who is self indulgent, cares only about his own pleasure, and only gives vague facades of actual caring...

Main characters I shall mention:
*the main guy whathisface aka the ""artist"" or ""man-whore"" [I apologize if this word offends you in any way but it's true....]
*the main guy's ex-wife aka ""the bipolar chick"" (this is Penelope Cruz' role that was nominated for an Oscar . . .I can't remember if she won or not...)

Lord knows why . . .he never actually seemed that interesting to me throughout the movie . . .It's the girls and their personas that really made the movie at least slightly tolerable if you ask me)

Basic summary:
*Artist meets with two American girls and they ""bond""/ he seduces them/wins them over/whatever and basically, they both end up sleeping him at different times . . .I wasn't surprised that Cristina did, but the fact that Vicky's character suddenly did a 360 for a brief moment (in that she slept with the artist) confused me . . .Why would you sleep with a guy who's involved with your good friend and who also has a crazy knife-weilding ex-wife with whom he as a love-hate relationship with? I guess it's because the guy's just ""that"" wonderful . . . .And there's drama, drama, and more drama until the very open-ended finish of the movie . . .Seriously, it leaves either confused, flustered, or hungry for passion that you can't ever get . . .Does anyone /really/ want any of those? I would say more but I don't really want to ruin anything for the (desparate) souls who want to actually put themselves through this tragedy (at least I think it's a tragedy .. with a tad bit of comedy that you kinda have to dig for or be in the mood for..) . .. Maybe I'm a prude for not liking this film, so I suppose if you like the intensely wild, free, and erotic lifestyle then maybe you'd be more open to this movie than be  . .. I don't know . .maybe you should watch the movie yourself instead of basing your opinions on others' reviews [sorry if I sounded harsh .  . . I mean . .I'm just saying that because, personally, I've loved a lot of movies that other people hated and I've hated a lot of movies that others have loved . . .Everybody has different tastes...]

Honestly,I wouldn't waste your time with this movie . .There many other Oscar nominated ""fish"" in the ""sea"" (Personally, I enjoyed Milk and Slumdog Millionaire . . .I like Australia too, but I can't remember if it was nominated for any type of Oscar or not) . . .

If You're looking for a good Scarlett Johannson movie I'd suggest the Island . . . .

*If You're looking for a good Penelope Cruz movie (though I did find her role rather ""entertaining"" in this movie) I'd suggest Volver [Volver is in Spanish by the way] or Blow

*As for Rebecca Hall (Vicky), I haven't seen any of the other movies with her . .same goes for Javier Bardem (the artist) . . . though I've been meaning to see ""No Country for Old Men"" for awhile now . . .

3533357,5,B001DJ7PR8,"I'm so excited to be writing a review for Woody's latest film `Vicky Cristina Barcelona'.  This was one of the more rewarding cinematic experiences for me this past year and I just melt every time I think about its splendor.  There are few films that ignite in me a warmth that is of the delightful kind, mostly because I relish more brooding fare, but every once in a while I find myself smitten with a film that has the ability to transport me to a happy place, and this film does that very thing.  Instead of wrecking me emotionally, `Vicky Cristina Barcelona' manages to revitalize me, making me feel refreshed and anew.

The film tells the story of two young friends, Vicky and Cristina, who travel to (you guessed it) Barcelona for a summer of freedom before Vicky marries her boyfriend Doug.  Vicky, who is getting her major in Catalan Identity, is intrigued with immersing herself in the culture all around her while Cristina, who is flirtatiously trying to find herself, is ready to immerse herself in just about anything.  When the girls meet the mysteriously charming painter Juan Antonio Gonzalo they have very differing opinions of him.  Vicky is immediately turned off by his rather blunt offer (to take them away for the weekend to eat, drink and make love) while Cristina finds him interesting and intriguing and is ready to jump right in (literally).  What sparks next is a love triangle that becomes a square when Juan's feisty ex-wife Maria Elena walks back into his life.

Vicky, who has always felt that all she wanted was a stable life with her very ordinary boyfriend Doug has found that all she thought she wanted has been questioned by her unpredictable affair with Juan, and Cristina, who has never really ever known what she really wanted, has found that all she knows is what she doesn't want when her relationship with Juan and Maria, which seems to be going so well, fails to keep her satisfied.

Some have baulked at the films blatant stereotyping and seemingly banal view of relationships, but what those complainers are failing to see is that the whole point of this film is that nothing is what we as typical Americans (or even typical humans) expect it to be.  The film attacks our narrow view of what is normal and bizarre by giving us two very opposite extremes of our perspective of relationships.  There is the cookie-cutter idea that man loves woman, man marries woman, they live happily ever after and then there is the free-love idea of woman loves man who loves woman and another woman and that woman loves the other woman so they all get together and live happily ever after.  There is no balance because the film is attacking the simplistic and exacting view of modern society who at times fails to see that there are many types of relationships and many types of lives.  Cristina, who knows that she doesn't want what Vicky has, is quick to plunge herself into something new, something out of the box, with Juan and Maria.  This is her idea of what she thinks she wants, beings that she only knows what she doesn't want.  She herself doesn't realize that just because she doesn't want the `ordinary' life doesn't mean that she has to want to `extraordinary' life either.

When you understand why the stereotypes are there then you can appreciate the film much more.

The acting across the board is superb.  A lot of people have attacked Scarlett Johansson as of late for her supposed throwaway acting.  They accuse her of not trying, of playing it safe; but when you exude the type of sensuality needed to play Cristina without having to try, why should she be panned.  She is perfection here, capturing the spirit of Cristina magnificently.  Rebecca Hall is also stunning here as Vicky, the complete opposite of Cristina.  She balances her characters standoffish almost snobbery with her natural curiosity and confused emotional breakdown very well.  Javier Bardem is charming and entertaining and engaging as Juan, but the women around him steal his light.  No one steals the light quite like the breathtaking Penelope Cruz, who just sizzles and pops as Maria Elena.  Her feisty take on the angry ex-wife is stunning.  She may be the biggest stereotype, but like I said, it is that stereotype that propels the films message.

I am in awe of this film and it is truly one of Woody Allen's greatest films.  This feels very fresh when you consider that a lot of Allen's films can carry the same vibe.  He attacks his favorite subject, that of relationships, but he does so with a different spin, with a refreshing cast and with a very bright, sunny and enjoyable result.",1236038400,,4615,4.7182044887780545
3533358,5,B001DJ7PR8,"Life around Mount Vesuvius before it erupts is very much the same as after - anxious, nervous, normal. The lives in this 2008 Woody Allen film are in many ways reminiscent of a hot and treacherous Italian volcano, alternating between grand, sensual, sleepy, beauty and fierce, explosive, irrational and uncontrollable eruptions.

Two women (Vicky and Cristina), the best of friends, sharing an abundance of common interests except for their impression of love, went on a long summer holiday in their friend Judy's home in Barcelona. Cristina, a sceptic of true love, ever willing to take risks in that regard, was also highly lacking in confidence in her talent as a photographer. Vicky, the steadier friend, engaged to marry Doug, had a conventional view of love. She believed that marriage is the consequence of love. Then they became attracted to Juan Antonio, a Spanish artist divorced from a tempestuous and multi-talented woman, Maria Elena, who keeps going back to him. Vicky, Cristina, and Maria Elena (estranged but no stranger) take turns to find sexual love with Juan Antonio, and Cristina even had a dalliance with Maria Elena. We can attribute the episodes of human exuberance to a combination of Spanish air, Spanish wine, and Spanish guitars; but one suspects that humans everywhere are the same. It is not in the air. It's in us. At the end of summer, Vicky and Cristina return to America. They were in the same positions as they left although Vicky had married Doug in the meantime but that seemed so irrelevant. We could see it in Vicky's eyes when they arrived at the airport back home. Everything on the surface seemed unchanged, even the gunshot wound on Vicky's hand was superficial.

 It would only have the mark of general accuracy to describe this film as an existentialist effort. What would be the precise meaning of that? It is like two men agreeing with the statement ""What a beautiful day!"" The glorious sun would be the same to both of them; the soothing breeze would have been felt by both; and the birdsong enchant them both. Yet how can it be the same beautiful day if it struck the one when he had just got out of love, and the other when he was about to leap into it? Is it honesty or courage that gives us the chance to experience something new, uncomfortable and pleasurable in turn, and ultimately transforming us? That is one question the film invites us to think about. The other is love. Vicky, like most conventional people, believed that marriage is a consequence of love. She discovered on a hot, balmy evening in Barcelona that that was a false premise. It was false because one cannot attribute a consequence to a cause that one cannot know, understand, or even define. Occasionally, one might discover clues to its nature. Juan Antonio described his relationship with Maria Elena thus: ""We were meant for each other; we were not meant for each other. It's a contradiction."" It applied equally to Vicky and Cristina; and to all of us. Juan Antonio had all the qualities of a libertine and yet we cannot condemn him for it. Was it because all the women saw him as he was and took him as such; and so expose all that lies suppressed in each of us by fear and hypocrisy?

The voiceover was annoying and the cinematography looked like a home movie, and totally failed to capture the beauty of Barcelona. Except for the occasional shot of Parc Guell or Sagrada Familia, it might have just as easily been Los Angeles. And if you think its gonna be erotic, think again.",1235260800,17,518,4.641304347826087
3533370,3,B001DJ7PR8,"I thought this movie was well-paced and that the dialogue was interesting and quirky, but somehow it felt lacking in substance by the end. To be sure all of the actors turned out great performances, especially Penelope Cruz, and the eye candy of Barcelona and Oviedo, not to mention the sultry, fun music, was exciting. But the actual plot is so thin and the character development so lacking, that once I reached the end I felt like there was nothing to carry away from this film.

Vicky and Cristina both face separate problems when it comes to romance. Cristina wants someone to settle with. Vicky wants someone to ignite her passion, which she isn't getting from her nice but dull fiance. Both of them think they might find solutions to their problems with the refreshing, exotic Juan Antonio, but neither of them can because they can't change themselves. The change of scenery can't change their habits in dealing with romance. Maria Elena and Juan Antonio have the passion, but not the stability. And the film is pervaded with the sense that they will never find that quality, and are shackled to a kind of half-love.

It seems like Woody Allen is critiquing all forms of romantic relationships as ultimately unsatisfying if not outright doomed to failure, and I found this to be cynical and unfair. Vicky and Cristina seem to go through a series of potentially life-altering experiences, but in the end they are the same as they were before they came to Barcelona, except maybe a little unhappier. It seems like a terrible waste of opportunity. And without question, Maria Elena and Juan Antonio don't develop at all, and you just know that they will continue on as they always have.

And I couldn't help but feel that the narration was in place because the feelings and actions of the characters weren't relatable enough without it, and that's not good, especially in a film; either not enough work went into showing, or else there was little to show in the first place. I think it was a little of both in this case.

This movie was saved by a seductive sensory experience of Catalonia, but it couldn't quite make up for the lackluster story or the static characters. Any deep revelations it tried to make were muddled and fell flat. The only thing this movie leaves you with is that relationships fail and people are too complicated to work through it. To sum it up with a line from Juan Antonio: ""Love is so transient."" That's just not true, but the characters will apparently never understand that. Even if they do see that they have to reconcile the problems within themselves before they can succeed in love and life, they won't try. And I didn't find that inspiring or even worthy of sympathy.",1235174400,11,2706,4.7025316455696204

""Vicki Christina Barcelona"" is more of the same, but done, as always in Allen films, deftly.  The absurdity of the situations was amusing, and I found myself smiling frequently during the film.  Penelope Cruz was outstanding among a number of good performances.

Plus, due to the cinematography, I'm probably going to have the fork over some cash for a vacation in Barcelona with my visually inspired wife.

So, essentially this is a film about two women, one in search of the utopia of relationships and the other well along - and quite willingly - the path to upper middle class angst and regret, who decide to spend the summer exploring the flora, fauna and architecture of Barcelona. Lo and behold, in short order each is sweet talked out of their [....] by the dulcet intonations of an unapologetic womanizing artist.  Add to the mix equal proportions of obsession and opprobrium between the womanizer and his passionate, high strung (read borderline psychotic) ex-wife who somehow manage to cultivate a symbiotic connection with the flaxen haired bohemian and what you end up with is a putatively subtle yet ultimately unremarkable Woody Allen comedy.

There are some good performances. But it's also  Woody Allen at his most cynical. As he did nearly three decades ago with ""Interiors,"" Allen gives us a world in which happiness is impossible and love is a cruel little joke played on the upper crust. Every character here, you see, is some combination of beautiful, wealthy, educated, artistically gifted and entitled. The fact that they have lifestyles and assets we only dream about does make them a bit annoying when they wallow in their discontent. Honestly, it's just hard to work up much sympathy for someone who looks like Scarlett Johansson and gets to spend her summers vacationing in Barcelona when the sum of her problems seems to be, well, she doesn't quite know what she wants in a boyfriend. In this movie, not only do money and beauty not buy love, but love is unreal anyway. So, yes, it's a good movie in a sense. But, as with the characters themselves, it just ain't all that likable.",1234656000,6,1106,4.614213197969543
3533375,3,B001DJ7PR8,"I used to be a huge fan of Woody Allen back in the Annie Hall days but that was a long time ago before he turned into a caricature of himself. I'd heard this was his best for years so I decided to give it a try.
It wasn't bad; lovely photography of Barcelona and four very attractive main characters providing ample eye candy. The plot is as simple as it is absurd. Vicky and Cristina come for two months to Barcelona and are propositioned by a handsome painter (Javie Bardem) who wants to sleep with them both. Cristina played by a Scarlett Johansson, is up for it but Vicky (Rebecca Hall), who is engaged to a boring American guy, is not. Nevertheless, after Christina comes down with a stomach complaint, it's Vicky who succumbs.
Later, Juan-Antonio's beautiful but disturbed ex-wife (Penelope Cruz) makes an appearance and a love triangle with Cristina develops. In the end, everyone emerges from the complications a little older but no wiser.
The problem I found is that every single character in the movie sounds and thinks like Woody Allen. Several of them even affect his nasal, self-satisfied yet anguished whine. This is a man of monumental ego who cannot imagine anyone else in the world but himself.
Ultimately, I found this movie mildly amusing but hugely pretentious. If that's damning it with faint praise, so be it.",1234569600,11,1331,4.716738197424893
3533376,4,B001DJ7PR8,"I thought this film was fantastic - aesthetically, in script, in casting, and in storyline. Yes, the film is a bit slow and winding, and No, it does not give into a fantasy-happy American ending. That's the best part. Penelope Cruz was beautiful and quite funny at times. If nothing more, this film made me open my eyes to the ways of love and lust, as well as made me want to visit Espana as soon as possible.",1234224000,,410,4.269230769230769
3533377,4,B001DJ7PR8,"Woody Allen Films tend to always be very refreshing. Filled with zany experiences and the quirks that come up along the way, shaping the path of the character's life.

I recommend this movie, especially if you are a fan of foreign film as this falls more in category of the story-telling style of such.

If you're looking 4 the strict Hollywood movie formula, this is not it.
This is a nicely-done artistic portrait of the interaction of 4 people, at different stages of their emotional lives in their quest for love and how it all plays out over the backdrop of Barcelona.
 *SPOILER ALERT*
A few commentors here complain about things I believe were supposed to be comedy and they haven't realized it:

Javier Bardem telling Penelope Cruz to speak in English was a comedic point, especially when he continued to speak Spanish despite telling her not to do so. It was a sign of the couple's confusion, imperfection and beautiful messyness of their relationship - like their paintings. The dynamic of their interaction was beautiful and highly engaging.

The narration in Vicky Christina, was a joke also, I believe. Kudos to Woody Allen for being so bold and confident in making this choice.

The Narration was hideously hysterically funny and I think more of an inside joke to the film-maker's industry. It was also a testament to how life should be more lighthearted when it comes to love, to search for what you want. And how if you were looking at this from an outsider point of view, all of the confusion, anger, sexuality, worrying, chance-taking, the mistakes, were just a story - just life and in the end, not as serious as it all seems when living it first-hand.

Like ""family issues"" were Yasujiro Ozu's theme in his films. Love and the search for happiness are Woody Allen's focus.

I ENJOYED this film tremendously. It was fun, adventerous, a breath of fresh air. Penelope Cruz just cranked out a kick-butt performance as the explosive but brilliant, hurricane of a woman, Marie-Elena constantly sweeping Javier up into what was to him, her magnificence.

If you let a film tell it's own story in it's own voice, youll be better equipped to see the brilliance of the Director. Don't try to stuff everything into a Hollywood format - and saying it sucks.

This is a great film, a piece of art in it's own unique right making actually is like sitting down to a nice, smart but whimisical and turbulent symphony. SEE IT.",1234224000,,2428,4.718676122931442
3533378,2,B001DJ7PR8,"Definitely carried by the strength of the actors and some intelligence of the dialogue, but in the end the story melts away like an icicle.  Once again Woody shows his lack of skill in writing overly dramatic material.
More dissapointing, in the end it's fairly misagynistic on women as all three either self-destruct or wander aimlessly thru life.  A brief hand full of comic moments douse the emotional banality of the story.  I enjoyed the spanish locale as a twist of the allen discography, but that ultimately didn't save this lemon.",1234137600,5,538,4.8901098901098905

I felt the same way about ""The Remains of the Day"" back in the 90's and that film turned out to be excellent.  Instead of renting Vicky Chr... I decided to buy it sight unseen which I don't take lightly being unemployed.  That mistake cost me $22.

Twenty minutes into Woody Allen's latest had me asking ""when is it going to get good?""  I was asking myself that all the way to the end.  I usually like ""slice of life"" films such as the aforementioned ""Remains of the Day"" or ""Un Coeur en Hiver"". Those films have scenes that you want to see again such as when Emma Thompson wants to know what kind of book Anthony Hopkins is reading and backs him into a corner.  In VCB there's not one scene I want to see again and the only couple who have any chemistry together is the male lead and his ex-wife, Penelope Cruz, and that's only when they're not fighting.

I gave this film two stars.  I would have given it 2.5 if it were possible.  It would be an OK rental but I don't recommend buying it.  Sorry Amazon.",1233964800,5,1093,4.181818181818182

It is not that he brings a light touch to the set. And (gracias a Dios) cleverness and humor take a second seat in this film to something much more juicy and profound. Makes me think Woody's 'got it' - this is about the art of being with people, humanness, celebration of uniqueness and imperfection. And also about observing, experiencing, participating ... and making films. The Craft.

These days it seems that in Woody's hands even a cliche becomes poignant, like a wink from a beautiful passerby. He creates a paradise and then takes it away; after all, this is about life.",1233878400,,736,4.705426356589148

The film itself is a victim of poor editing as some of the
glue that should have held this story together was left on the
editing room floor.  The actors worked with the material they had but
I don't believe the characters were fully developed, particularly
that of Penelope Cruz. I enjoyed Woody Allen's Match Point much more as it was a complete story.  In the end, this was much like many Euro

The script meanders, and the constant voiceover was unnecessary and irritating.  You don't need to have the voiceover tell me that they spent their evenings drinking wine and eating in cafes if you're showing the actors drinking wine and eating in cafes.  At the end of the film, the characters had not evolved and nothing came of their time together.  The entire series of events was of little consequence and so was this film.",1233878400,19,576,4.72
3533383,1,B001DJ7PR8,"Woody Allen has been known for his greats and his not-so-greats.  This movie is an example of the latter.  This is not to say that this film is not cinematically beautiful; the composition, the locations, and the choice of a warm tone throughout certainly provide a bed for romance to ensue.  However, too much forced dialogue and a poor, pre-pubescent sounding narrator who ends his sentences too sharply prevent the sheets from ever getting tossed.

 Allen does not allow silence to play its part in the film or allow his audience to play out the thoughts of the characters.  He believes that with enough words you can describe the emotions each character is feeling.  He gives his actors too many lines to remember that are written to be spoken to the audience and not to one another and consequently the acting suffers.

 These facts are undeniable and I invite the prior reviewers who gave this film high marks to reconsider their thoughts on this film given my review.

All too often we want to believe a film is good because we've invested our money, time, and sometimes high expectations and hopes.  When we're let down, we unconsciously play devil's advocate to protect ourselves from being outcast and victim of comments like,  ""How can you not like this film?  It's directed by Woody Allen!"" and the like.

As for story?  In short, predictable.",1233619200,29,1355,4.780172413793103
3533384,5,B001DJ7PR8,"I watched this with my wife and we both enjoyed it a lot.  It wasn't hard for either of us to suspend belief, go along with the story and enjoy the delicious scenery. Javier Bardem is extremely sexy without being macho or pushy. The two women are a nice mix of adventurous and staid. The three of them form a very interesting dynamic of sensuousness and sensibility. I liked it because it was easy for me to identify (i.e. want to be like) Javier Bardem and my wife enjoyed the movie from the female (Scarlett Johansson/Rebecca Hall) point of view ... being courted by Javier. It's been a long time since I have enjoyed a sensuous  romantic film as much as I enjoyed this one. The beautiful intimate view of Barcelona was a real bonus and inspired to want to visit Barcelona as soon as possible and to get this on BluRay immediately. It was like a mini romantic vacation I was very glad I took. I would highly recommend this film. Watch it with someone you love.",1233360000,2,962,4.398876404494382
3533385,3,B001DJ7PR8,"This movie strikes me as worth at best 3 stars. The first is for the acting of Bardem and Cruz which rises above the mediocrity of the material given them. The second is for the beautiful photography, in this case of Barcelona. The third is for the tentative hints of irony which fitfully peep out in the course of the numerous betrayals among lovers this film apparently accepts as standard operating procedure for sophisticated contemporary persons.

Woody Allen's judgment - or lack of it - is clearly inferior to his talent. His characters have experiences, yet neither he nor any of them seems to seek after, much less grasp, their meaning. Theirs are lives only of sensations, not of thoughts; they can resist everything except temptation; adultery, for example, is presented here consequently as less a betrayal of integrity than a logistical inconvenience.  Eschewing judgment of actions lest he be thought ""judgmental"" of persons, Allen - and by extension his characters -  emerges as less sophisticated than as diminished by arrested development, one whose vision remains embarrassingly that of an overly-hormonal teenager.

An infinitely greater artist Henry James, when he dealt with the international scene, saw that the key to a character's wholeness and maturity often rested with the ability to sacrifice, to renounce a less than finely human course of action. I wonder if Woody Allen, here so at home in the world and eagerly accepting of human failure simply because it's human, would have any understanding of what an artist of high standards like James was talking about.",1233360000,7,1591,5.107692307692307
3533386,1,B001DJ7PR8,"Why using a narrator when everything is clear and is flowing smoothly? The same old themes revisited, why? I find Penelope hideous and Bardem unbelievable in his role of an artist. What's more, it is annoying to find these Spaniards trying to convey their ideas in English just when they are having an argument. I don't see a solid reason to make their arguments in English in front of Scarlett. It's annoying seeing Bardem repeating his IN ENGLISH, SPEAK IN ENGLISH!
Very silly indeed. Not a movie for starters in Woody Allen. Please refer to the movies of the 70s and 80s, Annie Hall, Crimes and Misdemeanors, Manhattan, Hannah and her Sisters or more recently, Match Point.

3533387,2,B001DJ7PR8,"Clearly, one has to be a fan of the sad world of Woody Allen to enjoy this film. Unfortunately, I'm not. I found the premise interesting: Two American young women, propositioned by an attractive, charming, Spaniard, actually do fly away with him for the weekend. But even though both end up in bed with him (although not at the same time, as he proposed) the experience - and the surrounding drama, seem to produce no changes in anyone. It's almost like a porno film, where people have sex, but it doesn't matter.

Beyond that, there are only questions. Why does Vicky (Rebecca Hall) seem to be such a depressive that even an affair with handsome Spaniard can't jolt her out of her stupor? Why is Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) never satisfied with the love she has? These are some of the issues the film raises, but never really explores. The downer ending wouldn't bother me if the film provided some resolution to the conflicts it has set up. But it doesn't, except for Woodyphiles, who seem willing to accept whatever the master offers. Yes, life doesn't always offer a resolution, but art should. As for the voiceover narration, it isn't needed. All it does is add proof that the film lacks a dramatic structure.",1233273600,6,1216,4.708920187793427
3533388,4,B001DJ7PR8,"Woody Allen has written and directed another European based film that feels like a view across the pond toward America: Allen is still Allen, but with the comparison of European attitudes with American narcissism makes this little film a bit more bitter than most of his others.  As with most of Allen's movies, as fine as they are there are usually some annoying elements.  In VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA that element is in the presence of an unseen narrator (Christopher Evan Welch) who provides the bridges among the various aspects of the film, bridges that in the presence of such a fine cast are unnecessary in fleshing out the characters and their odd situations.

Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) are best friends who have elected to spend a summer in Barcelona: Vicky intends to pursue her studies of Catalan art and architecture while Cristina needs to recover from her completion of a disappointing 12 minute film.  Vicky is a pragmatist engaged to a 'good prospect' named Doug (Chris Messina)  while Cristina longs for the unusual - something that will fill the gap in her perception that she is without talent.  The two girls meet a famous artist Juan Antonio Gonzano (Javier Bardem) who, recovering from a strangely abusive marriage to the flamboyant Maria Elena (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz), puts the make on the two girls for a m&eacute;nage a trois. Vicky is disgusted, Cristina is fascinated and somehow the trio is off for a wild weekend that turns into a strange interplay of even stranger personality types. Juan loves both, beds both, and problems arise - especially when his still beloved tempestuous Maria Elena arrives on the scene.  Just about every variation of relationships is explored during this film with the audience more than willing to go along with the twists and turns that never cease to surprise and entertain.

Once again Javier Bardem proves he is one of our strongest actors on the screen and Pen&eacute;lope Cruz lights up the story like a rocket.  Watching them both is reason enough to see this film.  As for the script, Allen allows each of the characters to reference an aspect of Allen's own quirks, and in the end we have indeed heard yet another diatribe of how Woody Allen sees himself and the people who enter his sphere.  The film is colorful, rich in fine music, and blessed with an impeccable cast.

3533392,3,B001DJ7PR8,"I have been a frequent visitor to Barcelona. It is one of my favorite cities. In this Woody Allen movie there are beautiful clear but all-too-brief shots of Barcelona and the surrounding area. The photography in Blu-Ray is crystalline and sharp filmed with bright sunlight in beautiful settings. The bright colors of the movie collide with the dim opacity of the script.
 The premise of the movie I did not believe for an instant. The acting is fine, but the story is ridiculous. Javier Bardem's character invites two young American women, brand new to Barcelona, to fly to a nearby village for the weekend so he can bed them. The women go, and one gets seduced there, and the other gets seduced on the return to the city.
It's an adult fairy tale with absurd situations. It's not strictly a romance nor is it a comedy, but it is farcical, laughable in the sense that anyone who believes such nonsense deserves this new Woody Allen posturing.
 When I failed to suspend my disbelief, I lost all interest in the plot and merely stayed with it for beautiful shots of the Catalan area. Vacuous well-off people were merely indulging themselves, and the viewer gets conned into a meaningless ride to nowhere.
 Critics in general liked it partly because Woody Allen was behind the camera, not in front of it. I hope his next annual outing will be more credible and less pretentious.",1233187200,4,1375,4.6970954356846475
3533393,4,B001DJ7PR8,"Woody Allen doesn't make great movies anymore, but he does make good ones once in a while, and ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a fun little romantic comedy that brings a sexy sense of adventure to the sun-drenched Spanish coast. Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) are twenty-something women, best friends since college, who spend the summer in Barcelona while Vicky works on her master's thesis on Catalan identity. Cristina's flirtatious nature encourages a local painter named Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) to invite the ladies on a spur-of-the-moment romantic tryst in Oviedo. Vicky, the sensible woman with a staid fianc back in the States, is taken aback by Juan Antonio's effrontery. Cristina, a woman who thrives on passion and new experiences, is intrigued, setting in motion what will be an uncommon and unforgettable summer in Barcelona.

Penelope Cruz gives a nice performance as Juan Antonio's volatile, talented ex-wife Maria Elena. Cruz is always much better in her native Spanish than in English, and here she speaks both. It's nice to see her playing this jealous, slightly scary woman instead of her usual protagonist. Vicky is torn between her plans for a sensible marriage and her capacity for spontaneity and romance. Cristina is unconventional, throws herself into her passions, but her restlessness won't allow her to be happy with anything for long. Neurotic on both counts, but played more for light irony than drama. Javier Bardem doesn't have much to do except be charming and generous with his affections, but he does both with flair. ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is just good bohemian fun at a jaunty pace with an attractive cast in an exotic locale.

3533395,4,B001DJ7PR8,"Woody Allen likes to let the movie speak for itself.  He's never been one for extras, and the fact that this edition has none should be no surprise.

The picture quality is excellent, and makes it worth buying this over the SD version.  You won't be disappointed on that front.

The audio is not 5.1 as the specs suggest.  Dialogue and most sound comes through your main front speaker, and the front surround speakers are used for the musical portions of the film.  Again, though, this is typical for Allen films.  The dialogue is clear and easy to understand, and that's all that really matters with a movie like this, right?

3533398,5,B001DJ7PR8,"I think has a special ressonance for me, as both a writer, and a traveler.  As a young college student, I wouldn't claim to have watched Woody Allen's entire ouevre, but from the twenty or so that I've seen, some I've liked, some I haven't liked, some I loved, and some I wish I didn't waste my money with, but this movie seems to be unlike anything he's done, while being so similiar to all of his films.  The dramatic display, the performance he gets from the actors, is so spot on, it is no wonder the film won best comedy at the Golden Globes.

Vicky Cristina Barcelona is on first viewing, a travel film.  Two young American women who fall for the same spaniard painter Juan Antonio (played by Javier Bardem). Vicky (Played by Rebecca Hall in an amazing performance), is engaged to be married, likes responsibility, and doesn't like something that effects the norm, finds herself alone with the painter when Cristina--who was first drawn to the painter--gets sick, and they share a night together.  She says nothing however and the two women go back to Vicky's Aunt's house, where they are staying.  They don't hear from Juan Antonio for some days, and when they do, he calls for Cristina.  Cristina (wild, artistic bohemian, played by Scarlett Johansen in such an erotic and beautiful performance) is instantly taken and starts a relationship.  Unlike many American/Hollywood movies, Vicky neither shows bitterness nor anger, though some despondency.  What seems like a tamed love story that you begin to wonder where it will go, quickly becomes something completely different.  One night, Maria Elena (Juan Antonio's ex-wife, played by Penelope Cruz, with a fierceness that deserved the Golden Globe Nom) tries to commit suicide, and Juan Antonio picks her up from the hospital and brings her home.  Without revealing too much, the film begins to become male fantasy, and a meditation on art and connection and friendship and self-discovery.

On the second viewing, you start to pick up the subtleness of the cogitation on love and romance, the possibilities and restraints of romantic love (unrequited love is the only form of romantic love) as the movie espouses, for neither Juan Antonio nor Maria Elena can stand each other, but then neither can they stay away from each other for long (odds are, and you might get this feeling also) they'll probably one day end up killing each other.

On a third viewing the film becomes a meditation on art, on beauty, on how those two things coincide with love.  The tears from the Spanish Guitar, the emotion driven upward from the playing of such gentle music.  Vicky can be seen reading Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides (the book is on her bedside table), and Cristina can be seen reading Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer.

The voice over, this has been a point of discontent for some on the message boards on IMDB.  This voice over, some say, shows what a hack Woody Allen has become.  But I must disagree.  The Voice over I believe aides in the story, it describes in a flat tone sometime the most erotic of scenes, but this aides in keeping us grounded in the story of the girls, and not in the lust, or sexuality that's portrayed in the film.  It helps develope and move away from American Travel movies, away from the actual events, and allows you to remember to watch the girls, watch their lives, watch the film, and not get drawn away into your own imaginations.  I believe the narrator was used much more effectively than it was in Little Children.  It also helps you understand where you are in the movie, through this foreign country, and gives the feel of a book.

This movie may very well be my favorite Woody Allen film, with some excelent performances as only Woody Allen could pull from an actress (what director in the world has gotten fifteen nomination for writing--two wins--sixteen of their actors nomination for acting--five wins--and six for best direction--one win).  It was funny, romantic, intellectually stimulating, and each viewing there's something new.

If you like Woody Allent, I do believe you will like this movie, and I do believe you will adore these characters.  For me, still in my twenties, an artist with large aspirations, in a moderately upper middle class family, this film seems to be made exactly for me.  Besides Adaptation and Wonder Boys, I haven't felt like that about a movie, and I go to see one to three movies a week--not to mention rentals and old buys.  So I feel I have a certain credibility to my opinion--but again, it is only my opinion.  I say buy it, if you don't like it, give it to someone who is the exact opposite of you, give it to your Cristina (we all have a friend that's exactly opposite of us and so much the same), and maybe you will be giving them a film that they can love as much I love it.",1233014400,3,4814,4.684085510688836
3533399,5,B001DJ7PR8,"What a staggering experience, this film. Like several of Woody's recent scripts it has its own ebb and flow, but his varied musings over the years come together into this sunny little tale that carries you naturally through a mishmash of quietly whimsical characters.

And some characters they are! Javier continues to astonish with his versatility. After the eerie gravitas of ""No Country for Old Men"", he is sensational here in his buffoonery as an uber-suave artist, just as devoted to an epicurean life as he is cynically convinced of its worthlessness, his deadpan yet extravagant screen presence making him a perfect foil for his perpetual Flirt mode. Johannson is what only she can be, bemused and befuddled, although expect some distance from her usual sultry exuberance as her coolness seems oddly stunted.

Rebecca Hall as Vicky, to me, seemed a bit grating in her attempt to fit the glove of a Woody Allen film too snugly, scattered speech patterns and all, but fortunately that seemed to go with the righteous ennui of her character. Penelope Cruz is fiery! I am sure her histrionics in the film will make critics buckle and heave, although I'd venture to suggest that shrieking tour-de-force parts are relatively easier to enact; embodying the ordinary on camera is what presents a challenge. But she is painfully convincing nonetheless.

It's the natural groove of these protagonists that makes the film what it is. If I were to nitpick, a couple of aesthetic choices puzzled me. For instance, an omnipresent voice-over starts off giving the impression of being glib and satirical, but quickly becomes run-on, and then abruptly disappears for almost the rest of the film. And then there's the overuse of certain musical motifs that gets a bit repetitive.

But the setting is gorgeous and makes up in spades. Spain gets its own visual paean, and what a lyric it is! No cultural stone is left unturned: photography, drawing, music, poetry, food, architecture, fashion. It's a fine ensemble.

While it's not your garden variety ""Juno"" brand of comedy, there is wit in the evocative undertones. The film oozes something visceral. A comedy for grown-ups perhaps. Whatever your views about  menage-a-trois (or polyamory, or whatever they are calling it these days), the denouement is so natural and so untouched by pat pretenses that it is, well, sublime.

This is a departure for him and his body of work. The narrative and characters are guided along by a narrator which is an inspired touch (and a first for allen, i believe). The script was more dramatic and nuanced rather than outright funny and the characters were much deeper than I anticipated. The visual style is fantastic as always and the movie is seriously, dizzyingly, beautiful. The acting here is fantastic, everyone turned in terrific performances and Cruz stole the show with her every scene. This is a thought provoking and extremely complex piece of art which fits perfectly into the fantasy world Allen has created for himself.",1232755200,,777,4.762962962962963
3533401,5,B001DJ7PR8,"Woody Allen can never make Manhattan or Annie Hall again. Simply put, the world isn't smart enough for that brand of movie being made. people don't get that way of communicating, studios don't get why anyone would make a movie for the art and so on. Woody himself isn't that person anymore. he is a man in his 70s, and he can't keep stooping these young women. That being said, it could be nice to see him as an old man, married to a woman his own age, in some sort of adventure, not unlike Manhattan Murder Mysteries again, but, what with the US studios not fronting him the cash, I guess he won't make movies where he ties up parts of Manahattan again?

All that being said, Woody Allen is timeless, yet he keeps fresh, and keeps up with current actors and so on. His language may at times seem a bit archaic, but I don't think we suffer from hearing people talk properly. The actors he works with adore him and the freedom he offers them. He is an actors director, trusting that they know their craft. That shows, also in this movie.

Should you preffer humour and cringe at drama with people behaving in a... sexually embarrassing way,w ell then this is probably not the movie for you.

If you love watching movies where the relationship between human beings, with all their beauty, all their faults, desires, cruelty, egotism and horny behaviour out there for all to see, well, then this is the movie for you.

Sure, Woody doesn't have a real grasp of Europe anno 2008, or for that matter, New York, but I love him for it. The fact that he ignores what people think he should do, and ignores the bland movie making going on these days, and just does his thing. He is my hero, and I am not ashamed to say so.

I loved this movie, it was a real shot in the arm for his body of work (I couldn't stand Cassandra's Dream), and I reccomend it warmly.

However, my top 3 Woody Allen movies of all time, are still Manhattan, Stardust Memories and Broadway Danny Rose.",1232668800,,1964,4.352459016393443
3533402,5,B001DJ7PR8,"My fun trip continues, I have been mostly lucky with my latest movie choices.
Here we have two American girls carousing in Spain and catching Bardem, this time in his charming incarnation, not as a crazy mass murderer. He is not hard to catch, neither is Scarlet. Her friend plays hard to get but is lost when the going gets tough. We pity her poor, mentally  underdeveloped American fiance. Bardem's ex-wife Cruz adds screeming European hysteria to the lovely light-handed fun about love and pretensions.
It seems to me, Woody Allen got it right with this satire on cultural stereotypes. Some of the situational comedy is just classy. The parallel in both girls' failed planned encounter with Juan Antonio: Scarlet is entirely willing to go for it, but has not counted on her stomach weakness after all the wine. Her friend is entirely willing as well, but nobody expected the jealous ex to show up with a gun and shoot her in the hand. Hard to explain to the new husband, but the poor sod buys anything. What else can he do.
Quite possibly the only entirely sane person in the story is Bardem's father, who refuses to learn English.",1232582400,,1134,4.67
3533403,5,B001DJ7PR8,"I always look forward to the next Woody Allen movie.

Many of his films are great.  Others are very good, and a few are just okay.  Personally, I don't think he's ever made a ""turkey,"" though the few films in which he's written a part for another actor and had him deliver his lines in that unique ""Woody Allen rhythm"" (e.g. CELEBRITY, ANYTHING ELSE) don't really work that well.

His latest, VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA, is certainly Allen's best film since MATCH POINT (2005).  The picture might best be described as ""a seductive romantic comedy with a dark side"".

Best friends Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johnasson) travel to Barcelona, Spain, for a summer-long vacation.  Vicky, engaged to be married, is the practical one and Cristina is a failed artist with a free spirit.

Shortly after their arrival, the girls meet Javier Bardem, a sexy artist with a jealous ex-wife (Penelope Cruz), who immediately invites them to come away with him for a romantic weekend.

Vicky is appalled, but Christina is game, so Vicky goes along to keep her friend out of trouble.

It isn't long before the handsome Bardem beds both of the girls, but then the unstable Penelope appears on the scene, which definitely complicates matters.

Allen has written some marvelous, restrained and humorous scenes for his film, which examines the volatility of human relationships.  The scene in which Bardem proposes that the girls go away with him is classic.

Director Allen has also extracted fine performances from his cast, particularly Cruz who appears late in the film.

Also impressive is Rebecca Hall, who might very well become a major star.  Whenever she is on the screen, your eyes are focused on her.

3533404,5,B001DJ7PR8,"After you get past the rather long narration, and the beautiful postcard images of Barcelona, an amusingly supple story emerges of an artist's taste for beautiful women.  You never quite know who is at the center of this story but Vicky, impeccably portrayed by Rebecca Hall, is the one who ultimately has to feel the impact of the consequences of these interlocking love stories.

Javier Bardem plays the rugged artist that proves irresistible as Vicky's and Cristina's summer trip to Barcelona turns into quite a battle for affections.  Woody Allen has a difficult time keeping Penelope Cruz under wraps.  Filled with seething passion, you find yourself waiting for Maria Elena to explode.  Ultimately, Scarlett Johansson proves to be the ""salt"" that keeps these simmering emotions in check, while unlocking new feelings of her own.

The story moves around quite a bit, taking in some lovely countryside as well as a Gaudi-inspired tour of Barcelona, with Vicky having to navigate a now turbulent sea of emotions in regard to her betrothed.  She may have ceded Juan Antonio to Cristina but now finds herself with many misgivings when her fiance turns up in Barcelona pressing her for an early marriage.

Light, yet filled with many trenchant observations, Vicky Cristina Barcelona is one of those movies that casts a magic spell, as Woody Allen searches for the meaning of love in sun-dried Spain.",1232323200,,1399,5.052173913043478
3533405,5,B001DJ7PR8,"""Vicky Christina Barcelona"" is a wonderful, eclectic and typically Woody Allen film.  In some respects, it could be seen as a chic flick but it is more.  There is a rambling story told against the beauty of Barcelona.  It is also the story of American innocents abroad.

In brief, the film has four attractive stars in Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem.  Indeed, there is a m&eacute;nage a quarte and it is how the characters interact that is the core of the film.  Bardem is the modern Lothario, Johansson the footloose lover, Hall the conservative modern woman and Cruz the crazy Latin woman.  There is little in the way of plot.  Instead, the viewer is entranced by the characters themselves.

The film is full of amusing situations.  The dialogue is quintessentially Woody Allen.  As such it is a film of words rather than action.  However, the film is set against the backdrop of beautiful Barcelona in summer.  Indeed, as with so many of Woody Allen's films, we almost get an architecture lesson as an added surprise.  Usually, it's New York; this time, Barcelona.

It is hard to say which of the four main actors actually stars in the film.  It is very much that each actor has his or her own role to play and they are all equals.  Bardem is so different from his previous film with the Coen brothers, while of the women, Cruz is certainly the most volatile.  Yet Johansson and Hall are also excellent.

One cannot leave this film without feeling that they are better for the experience.",1231545600,4,1526,4.690566037735849

3533407,3,B001DJ7PR8,"If there is a message to be garnered from the 2008 film, ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" its that director, Woody Allen, at 72 seems just as confused about life as he did way back in the 70s when he first pondered life and romance in his classics, ""Annie Hall"" and ""Manhattan."" Instead of focusing on life from his seasoned vantage point by portraying characters that are a little more chronologically concurrent with his personal experience, Allen resorts to having a cast of relative youngsters--in particular Rebecca Hall as Vicky and Scarlett Johansson as Cristina--voice his quintessential New York angst. No longer his own leading man, he remains the same old Allen, posing the same questions from out of the past as he did as the strange befuddled uber-middle-class-head-scratching thinker paralyzed by the constraints of his identity within the sky-scrapered confines of his beloved metropolis.

What has Allen learned about human existence? Plenty, I am sure and not in the sense of a vacuous coffee shop conversation complete with plenty of cigarette smoke and accompanying pseudo sophisticated scowls. Yet in this film set in glorious Antoni Gaudi-studded Barcelona under the ersatz innocuous guise of two American tourists doing the Henry James Europe thing before facing their lifestyle crossroads--settling down to either a staid predictable convention or a reckless feckless bohemia--in terms of theory, he seems to be starting out rather than finishing up which leads me to think that he has revolved along the periphery of his own mindset for far too long. Then again, I doubt that this reflects the truth, as he knows it. Perhaps it's just a case of senior citizen heartburn where old ideas badly digested keep resurfacing like some awful garlic-tasting ""agita."" Allen's own art/life is fraught with fear regarding growing older and dying; his experiences have taught him something--yes? Somehow I think he is too afraid even at 72 to explore them.

Not that I don't like this ensemble of wonderfully talented actors set against the dreamy Catalan backdrop. The character of Vicky played by Rebecca Hall (""the Prestige"") strikes me as the most uninspired. With her almost nave intonations, she sounds and acts like Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow (who both spout Allenesque quips like a Greek chorus), two wonderfully mature actresses portrayed forever bewildered in their prisons of WASP repression by Allen's films. Graduate student, Vicky chooses the safe route as explored by Allen back in the 70s when he started his cinematic quest for self. Secure behind the structure of routine with no surprises, she acquires a husband who makes oodles of money, has already planned his retirement before he has reached the age of 30, researched the best neighborhoods to help him reach middle classed nirvana ASAP and has conditioned himself to believe that his way is the only sensible path to attaining the best that life has to offer. How sad that Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem without his ""No Country for Old Men"" air-gun and Dutch boy bob) of the hooded lids and sensually accented English comes along, releases her from the entrapment of stepping outside her safety net and in one weekend destroys her happily-ever-after delusion.

Johansson, on the other hand, slides deliciously into Allen's role of blonde muse of the moment as she has now in this, her third Woody Allen film. As wannabe actress Cristina, she barely acts. Her luscious body lazily moves along with the same insouciance that it did in 'Match Point' and 'Scoop.' Yet in spite of the fact that she is portrayed as being comfortable in her own skin, sexually and in terms of her willingness for adventure, she is similar to other Allen heroines as she hangs a little too tightly to a world fraught with manners and reigned-in emotions. When she speaks, she sounds as if she is intoning about a recipe at a garden party rather than big questions that actually mean something to her in the grand scheme of things. Like her creator, she seems a voyeur rather than a participant, unsure of who she is or what her talent is, she examines herself critically and although impulsive in her desire to live a more exciting alternative life from Vicky, her friend, is similarly perplexed and stuck in her own boundaries of unevolved self-identity.

Bardem slithers into this role as the Latin Lothario with the same startling authenticity he applies to Anton Chigurh the loathsome Terminator in ""No Country for Old Men."" As the resigned artist Juan Antonio, he sizzles with enough testosterone to equalize nearly all the estrogen emitted by this almost female cast--that is until Penelope Cruz hits the screen as his slightly overly passionate ex-wife (thank God she packs only a pistol and not Chigurh's trademark air-gun). Cruz's wild restlessness perfectly offsets Johansson's voluptuous indolence; she appears in only half of the movie, but quite literally steals the show in a performance that smacks of effortless perfection.

Allen begins his film with a shot of the two girls arriving at the Barcelona airport and ends with them departing for America. The experience of the summer now said and done results in a reaffirmation of the same mindset Allen ponders over and over again in all of his films. Life's pleasures and pains are indeed ephemeral, but one's overall sensibilities remain confused no matter what the exposure or how intimate the contact.

Bottom Line? In general, ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" entertains once one gets past director Woody Allen's insistence on revisiting themes that he should develop now as seen from his older vantage point. Utilizing a third person male narrative voice-over, this film seems an innocuous fable about a life changing summer in beautiful Barcelona, but actually comments about Allen's own unwillingness or inability to let go of some of his lifelong phobias. Although Allen's queries are timeless, I would like to see him shed some of his thirty-something-year-old angst and write and direct a film that truly reflects him as artist and a man in the 21st century rather than hide beneath the skin of the young and restless. Let's face it, old and restless is okay, too, and beats the alternative of old and dead. Recommended. Performances by Bardem and especially Cruz are well worth the price of admission

3533408,4,B001DJ7PR8,"VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA is a film about youth, about self-discovery, and about the anything goes freedom and spontaneity that Americans feel (or try to feel) when far from their own homeland and therefore liberated from their own cultures notions about love and life. Abroad one escapes the tyranny of ingrained convention and habits of mind and one gives oneself permission to experience another version of self and life in another land, or such is the promise of travel.

The problem with Vicky and Cristina (and perhaps with this film) is that Barcelona does not really liberate either of them from anything. Both seem too self-conscious and/or too self-occupied to step outside themselves and what they know. Both have a comfort level with themselves and each other that is never breeched. And so although Barcelona promises and delivers a certain amount of adventure, it does not really deliver either girl from themselves. During their stay, they are exposed to a passionate Spanish culture and introduced to a fiery tempered Spaniard but ultimately they both make the same kinds of choices that they made back home. Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) has always been an impulsive free spirit who starts things, loses interest, and does not finish them. It does not matter what country she is in, she is the same, and so the Spanish trip ultimately changes nothing for her. Vicky (Rebecca Hall) has always been conservative in matters of life and love. Although she is attracted to others that feel things and act on those feelings (like her friend Cristina) Vicky does not altogether trust emotions and is afraid to have them and, therefore, is never certain what she feels or if she feels anything at all. Vicky is very much like a classic Henry James male and she is driven by the same fear that drives James' male characters which is a fear that they are missing out on life. Although engaged before she embarks on her Spanish holiday, and apparently immune from the advances of strangers, she, nonetheless, remains fearful that she is missing out on something. Its really only when her friend enjoys a spontaneous summer with the painter Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) and his former lover Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) that she wishes that she too could live so passionately, so recklessly. The fact that she holds everything in is what makes her so alluring to the passion-drunk Juan Antonio. But she is who she is, neither Spain nor Juan Antonio have the power to changer her.

And so there is something sad about this trip (and this film). Woody Allen is one of the few directors who gives us genuinely interesting characters and stories and that should be applauded. In this film the two main characters, Vicky and Cristina, are ultimately incapable of being anything but who they are and who they are is Vicky and Cristina. Whether Woody thinks that their inability to live or think outside of their own comfort zone is an affliction that is peculiarly American is not exactly clear, but likely. Marie Elena's view of the Americans is that they are too self-involved to really live. Of course Maria Elena who does allow herself to live also opens herself up to suffering. I'm guessing that with Vicky Cristina Barcelona Woody is perhaps analyzing the American psyche (which is what he does best) and that what he finds is a psyche that is firmly rooted in and addicted to self and that resists any kind of self-surrender. This seems to be the sober reflection of an artist who has seen and contemplated America and Americans for many years.

Despite the location this is a very sober film and, despite a few well-placed laughs, also a very somber one.",1221523200,70,3660,4.8528
3533409,4,B001DJ7PR8,"In ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" Woody Allen begs to contradict another pundit of his age, Mick Jagger. Woody demonstrates in his latest movie that you can't EVER get what you want, and you also can't get what you need. He demonstrates this in the story of how Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson), two lovely young Americans staying in Barcelona for a few months, react to the romantic overtures of the dashing, primally sexy artist Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem). Vicky--a master's candidate in ""Catalan identity,"" although she is not Catalan and barely speaks Catalan or even Spanish--finds that sex with Juan Antonio shakes up her previously solid feelings for her dullish American fiance, Doug (Chris Messina). Cristina--a dilettantish photographer/filmmaker who is defined by the fact that she only knows what she DOESN'T want in a relationship with a man--finds greater satisfaction with Juan Antonio, at least until Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz), Juan Antonio's volatile, insanely jealous ex-wife, shows up.

Some critics have opined that ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a hackneyed blast at naive Americans left at sea by European sexual sophistication. However, I think it's more a delineation of Woody's basic belief that happiness in love is transitory at best. How can you possibly hold up Juan Antonio and Maria Elena--who are constantly at each other's throats, to the point that Maria Elena brandishes knives and guns--as an example of sexual sophistication? They can't live with each other, they can't live without each other, but she may end up killing him, herself, and a few innocent bystanders. As enacted in a scintillating performance by Cruz, Maria Elena embodies the eternal irrationality of love, a blind craziness that--at least in Woody's view--stamps an irrevocable expiration date on even the tenderest, most ardent love.

Not quite a comedy but certainly not a tragedy, ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a rueful commentary on the constant dissatisfactions of love and life, made all the more bittersweet by the heartbreakingly beautiful scenes of Barcelona and Catalunya wrapped in golden light by photographer Javier Aguirresarobe. The film offers us multiple pleasures--not least the excellent performances--yet, in the end, it feels slight. There are too many of Woody's familiar tropes for us to take the film at face value, especially the overly familiar characters; personally, I'm tired of the gorgeous, nubile young ""Woody women"" who are drawn vaguely toward a career in the arts yet are completely confused about everything except their need for hot sex. And, yes, Woody, we got the point decades ago that you consider life and the Universe meaningless; why do you always have to have one character in every movie (in this case, Juan Antonio) declare that belief baldly? ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is worth seeing, but it falls short of being one of Woody's masterpieces.",1220745600,116,2918,5.313852813852814
3533410,4,B001DJ7PR8,"People have been waiting for years for Woody Allen to make another ""Annie Hall"" but it is not going to happen. Allen has moved on and sometimes up from that classic: the benchmark of the 30+ years of his making films.
Without putting too much effort into it, I can think of a number of very fine films that Allen has made since ""AH"": ""Another Woman,"" ""Hannah and her Sisters,"" ""Manhattan Murder Mystery,"" ""Manhattan,"" ""Broadway Danny Rose"" and on and on. But he has also made some clunkers like ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" and ""Small Time Crooks."" All in all a great career: one made up of hits and misses, par for the course with someone who has been making films for a long time.
Now comes his newest: ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" made in Barcelona and redolent of that beautiful city: hot dusty, passionate, sultry, crazy, always bursting forth with life and love...a city in which all is possible, everyone is open to experience everything...or should be.
Into this milieu comes two American women: Vicky (Rebecca Hall: pretty yet bland) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson: beautiful and luscious) both looking for something: but what?
Vicky is the more realistic of the friends. Working on a Master's on Catalan identity which she is pursuing despite knowing almost any Spanish!
Cristina (Johansson), on the other hand, is into suffering, passion and risk. She recently finished a 12-minute film on why love is hard to define and has just broken up with the latest of a string of boyfriends.
It's Cristina, a bodacious blonde who naturally catches the eye of painter Juan Antonio (a womanizer: charming and sexy Javier Bardem) at an art opening. He's just been through a difficult divorce from Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz in a chew the scenery with relish performance), a wife who stuck a knife in him, but that doesn't stop this unabashed seducer from chatting them both up and inviting them to spend a mnage--trois weekend with him. ""Life is short and full of pain,"" he candidly explains, ""and this is a chance for something special.""
Juan Antonio, who eventually romances both, teaches them about Love and Life and leaves them both with a richer knowledge of themselves and a working knowledge of the world in general. Juan Antonio is the Voltaire of Lotharios.
The Spanish duo of Bardem and Cruz bulldoze their way through this movie with their wit, charm and unwitting knowledge of what works in film acting often over-powering the relative blandness of Hall and Johansson.
""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is not the best film that Woody Allen has ever made but neither is it near the worst and as such it is a pleasure: rich with the patented Allen world vision and irony that makes us smile with recognition of something both familiar yet unusual and remarkable.",1220659200,4,2769,4.843881856540085

When I go to Europe, I get propositioned-a lot-in metro cars, in cafes, on the street. It's not because of my looks but rather because passion, beauty and sex are a function of life Spain, France and Italy. And so it happens for Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Christina (Scarlett Johansson). While spending a summer holiday in Barcelona, Vicky and Christina are given a ""best offer"" from Juan Antonio (the dreamy Javier Badem), to fly away for the weekend. Vicky is hostile to his offer-she knows what she wants-a drama free relationship with her fiancee. Christina finds the offer and the man interesting and states her desire to go. To protect her friend, Vicky goes along for the ride, but finds herself caught in the undertow of love and succumbs unexpectedly to Juan Antonio's gentle seduction.

The three return to Barcelona and Vicky returns to her work and her plans for marriage. Christina begins a relationship with Juan Antonio. Juan's ex-wife, Maria Elena (the gorgeous Penelope Cruz) tries to kill herself and Juan tells Christina they have to take care of her until she gets on her feet. Oddly, the ethereal Christina acts like a salve in the tumultuous relationship between Maria Elena and Juan Antonio. The three of them fall in love and life is going along swimmingly until Vicky begins to feel a familar desire-one which Maria Elena correctly labels ""perpetual discontent"" in an emotional tearful moment.

In the meantime, Vicky continues to yearn for Juan Antonio, and her discontented Aunt schemes to set the two up. They meet for a seductive lunch, but seduction is in the head as much as the heart and taking from an earlier scene where Christina tells Juan Antonio that he shouldn't blow it with with something small-the wrong pair of shorts for example, he blows the seduction of Vicky completely with the wrong kind of life-a life of drama which the staid Vicky can not really imagine being a part of.

This film has it's problems. First and foremost, Christopher Evan Welch talks over some of the scenes-almost like he was presenting script direction, ""Vicky felt x, while Christina felt..."". I'm a fan of ""show, don't tell"" and would have preferred to ""get it"" on my own.  With this style of presentation, Allen feels a bit controlling, as if he's going to tell his audience his message because we're too dumb to infer it on our own.  But whatever the problems with Vicky Cristina Barcelona, I loved it. I love Allens exploration of culture. I saw Annie Hall when I was five and I've been intrigued with Allens brand of dysfuction ever since.
