7822776,1,6302246962,"Imagine your teenaged relative insisted that you go to their high school to see a play but when you got there you found out that the play had actually been written by the fifth grade class at the local elementary school and was being performed by the kindergarten class. Now imagine something about fifty times worse and you've got an idea of how bad this movie is.
Most of the film looks like it was shot with a 55mm lens from the 15th row of a theater with only the occasional close up to show that someone has been stunned (but usually not by something that should stun any normal person). Really, someone dissolves/decomposes right in front of you and you just stand around looking like, 'Been a while since I seen that happen'?
In the stories and novels John is portrayed as intelligent, brave, strong, selfless and righteous but not self-righteous. In the movie he's something of a moron who just wanders into trouble and gets out of it by hiding behind his guitar. In the beginning of the movie he sleeps with a girl and then lets her follow him around the country for most of the film because he's too much of a jerk to just tell her that he doesn't want the sedate, married life that she does. He's constantly being overpowered by men who pretty much just look at him and the most action you get from him is playing his guitar or ducking behind it.
Stephen King said something to the effect of, a bad adaptation doesn't do a thing to ruin the source material and thankfully, that's true but it can certainly kill the interest in other adaptations. As far as I know there's never been another film adaptation of Manly Wade Wellman's works, which is a shame, as many of the are quite cinematic.
By the way, the stories so poorly adapted here were O' Ugly Bird and The Desrick on Yandro (Mountain?). I have no idea where the 'Saving the Poor Black Cotton Pickers' story line came from. I guess you're just not a proper hero if you don't duck behind your guitar to save a few Black folk who only appear to be in danger of being forced to look at bad artwork up close and personal.",1393804800,6,2085,4.390180878552972
7822777,4,6302246962,"I just watched this movie on my VHS tape. Boy, is it ever an aberration of Manly Wade Wellman's Silver John (sometimes also referred to as John the Baladeer)Character (from his written stories, most appearing in various Pulp Magazines).
In one sentence, it is a 1970's hippie-ization of the original character. I'm sure the producers thought they were updating the character and story for the current 1974 audience. And truth be told, it does have it's charms, despite the lack of truth to the original.
The original John in the stories is a Korean war vet, very wise, strong, intelligent, witty, and polite. I always pictured him as late 20's, early 30-ish. The actor in the movie is very handsome, fit, early 20's, and naive and idealistic, in a country-boy, 1970's youth movement sort of way. Not a bad character--very likable, but certainly not the original.
The original stories are set in the 1950's North Carolina, but usually take place in the backcountry that is 15-25 years behind the times, so one gets a 1930's sense of things. This movie has a weird mix of late 19th century and 1970's costumes in the beginning. There is NO traveling back in time as someone stated. As the movie continues, it is all 1970's hippie, live on the land sensibility.
The original stories had John confronting evil in the guise of wicked witch women, and Hex men, and non-human entities and bad spirits, who preyed upon the ""good mountain people"". This was almost missing in the movie. The sense was more of greedy men, who exploited the people by gold lust, strip mining, that sort of thing. The stories had a dominent sense of folk magic, mostly dark, but this is almost invisible in the movie, except for Silver John devotees who can pick out some of it. The movie had 2 vignettes based on ""The Desrick on Yandro"", and ""O Ugly Bird"", but had a totally invented beginning and ending, with characters Wellman never wrote. There were no wild fantastic creatures in the Yandro vignette, only some roars in the background. If I was not familiar with the story, I would probably not understand what was going on. The ugly bird vignette was more interesting, and followed the story, but was very short. Ugly bird made an appearance, and was the special effects highlight of the movie! Yay!
The movie totally jumped the shark in the last quarter, and became very 1970's hippie-ish. It ends with John leaving his hot, blond hippie girlfriend (who wants to settle down on a farm, with vegetables and fruit, etc.) and traveling to, -wait for it, ---Washington DC. John is seen from behind walking up the US Capitol lawn (!!), with his guitar, hippie clothes and hat--with a feather in it, presumably to use his magic silver guitar strings to root out the evil in Washington and set the country straight. Amazing.
Anyway, I liked it in a cult movie sort of way.
I loved John's dog--he acted very well--growling, talking, whining his lines very well, and looking very happy and content thru-out.

A comment to inject is that the VHS tape is rare and hard to find, so it is hard to watch this movie even if you want to. It would be great for someone to make a movie that is true to the original stories, and someone will someday, if the film rights are not an insurmontable issue. Considering the rash of comic book character movies in the last 10 years, with writers and producers digging ever deeper into pre-comic book fantasy characters, it is only a matter of time before Silver John comes again to the big screen or TV.

Oh, and other things that I forgot to mention--(1)-The authentic hillbilly, Appalachian dialogue, that was such a big feature of the stories is almost absent in the movie. (2)-Also, in the stories, John is a polite true son of the mountains, and all the good people that he meets recognize this. They accept him as one of them when his travels take him to their door as a stranger. I always thought that this was a key and very attractive part of the tales. You guessed it---it is totally absent in the movie. While the actor, John, is very likable, there is more the sense of the generation gap between John, and the older people he meets. This, too was a staple of the late 1960's, early 1970's movies, espicially for movies trying to appeal to the youth market. ""Do not trust anyone over 30"", was not a feature of Wellman's John the Baladeer. (3)-The music John played was not bad, but was more 1970's folk than old time, traditional mountain music. (4)-The acting was not bad at all to me thru-out the movie. There is a pletora of veteran character actors of the time that play their roles very well--as written for them.

Need I say anymore?
Watch it if you have the opportunity or have read the original stories, just don't expect the movie to follow the sensibility of Wellman's original stories. You may end up liking it, in a 1970's low budget good-hippie cult film sort of way.",1345593600,12,4894,4.622988505747126
7822778,4,6302246962,"This movie must have had a budget of $1.98.  For such a low budget, though, it is excellent.  It has the feel of Manly Wade Wellman, although the added Grandpa John, and the girl who isn't Evadare, don't fit.  Other than that, it's decent.  It's also rather antigovernment, but then, most intelligent people are, I guess.  The greatest evil has got to be Congress, right?  It's cheesy, but it's well worth watching.",1129939200,4,415,4.694444444444445
7822779,4,6302246962,"I'm crazy for Manly Wade Wellman's writing. I saw the only other video available - an episode of the twilight zone and an episode of Night Gallery; so I had to watch this movie. The music is excellent as it really fits the mood of the Silver John books.

But the special effects are so cheesy that they are comical especially to me as I grew up sneaking bad horror movies when the baby siter was talking on the phone.

You can check out [...] for more info.

You should watch it for the music and the beautiful mountain scenery. The effects would have been better served by taking a BLAIR WITCH approach and not showing very much.",1094083200,7,630,4.322033898305085
