1808571,2,B00007G1Y8,"Now that I've seen a lot of these mid 1970's giallo thrillers, I'm starting to lose patience with the ones that confuse being mysterious with being just plain incoherent, and that's what Spasmo is. A man named Christian finds a young woman called Barbara unconscious on a beach and they begin an affair, but almost immediately, weird things start happening. An intruder breaks into Barbara's bathroom, and Christian kills him, but the body vanishes. Life-sized female dolls are found around the countryside, in various ""just murdered"" poses, and Christian starts meeting people he recognises, all of whom deny that they have met before. This goes on for around an hour until finally an explanation is revealed, but it's a very poor one.

The film never manages to arouse your real interest because the events happening are not really that interesting. And the script is terrible, most notably when Christian and Barbara are flirting and there's all this stupid talk about his beard...you'll know what I mean! The life-sized dolls look great, but they are never used with any real impact and have about 1% relevance to the plot's end revelations. Suzy Kendall looks lovely as Barbara, despite having such awful dialogue to read out...she acts with sincerity, but the script destroys her performance, as it does for most of the other actors too.

Spasmo, therefore, is nothing more than mildly diverting. The widescreen photography is nice, but with no gore, only a tiny bit of nudity, a confusing plot and a weak ending, it ranks several notches down when compared to the many other, better, giallos out there.",1172188800,3,1609,5.0
1808572,4,B00007G1Y8,"I agree with the other reviewers that all of the plot intrigues are a bit much with this film.  But the basic set-up is great: an apparently innocent man is being pushed to the brink of a nervous breakdown by various parties, all or some of whom may be working together in an effort to send him over the edge.  Throw in some great music (by Morricone, of course), a cast of over-the-top characters, and tons of suspense, and you've got a great film.  But the writer and/or director went a little too far with all the various twists and turns here; there are only so many surprises a viewer can withstand in one 94-minute film.  Having said that, I enjoyed the movie quite a bit.  I have watched 10 or 12 Giallos over the past few months, and of those I would put this one near the top of the heap, just below Dario Argento's films but far above some of the stylish but superficial Giallos that were made.",1161043200,2,904,4.294117647058823
1808573,3,B00007G1Y8,"The other reviewer is right.. It is a bit confusing and muddled in the middle but the movie as a whole is satisfying. I'd rather a movie be too complicated than too simple. At least it makes me want to see it again. If you like twisted mysteries and/or 70s Italian cinema, this is a nice choice. It's not up there with The Case of the Scorpion's Tale or any of Argento's movies but still, it's worth a look.",1140480000,,407,4.1645569620253164

7975976,5,B00007G1Y8,"the great umberto lenzi made this giallo film in the 1970's.  This blu ray upgrades the picture from the dvd that was out years ago.  It's not perfect but it's higher contrast sure looks good.  A giallo is a italian slasher crime film that was one of the most popular types of export and Italian homeland film from 1966-79 , when it promptly died mostly , with a few being made into the seventies.  including the great ones by argento. But mostly it was dead throughout that decade.  Lenzi , made many great films and this is mind twisting one.  Which will give you spasms of enjoyment.  There are many other giallos out there that need to be put out on blu ray.  Including lenzi's classic 'eyeball'.  SO where is that one?  Anyways grab this great horror giallo film on blu .",1461110400,,776,4.401408450704225

7975980,5,B00007G1Y8,"""Spasmo"" was directed by Umberto Lenzi and his work has been inconsistent, but he does score on the high end, especially with ""Spasmo"" that he probably deservedly stands to be a ""maestro.""  Other giallos by Lenzi, probably the best known, ""Seven Blood-Stained Orchids"" and the trilogy with Carroll Baker providing Lenzi's personal favorite, ""Orgasmo"" and ""Eyeball"" were rather formulaic.  Lenzi uses his better techniques to full advantage in ""Spasmo"" providing without an admitted disuse of blood and nudity a perplexing story-telling and provides rewarding and clever ways to satisfy with twists.  Suzy Kendall, Robert Hoffman and Ivan Rasimov star, and the Scorpion Releasing Blu-ray edition (with different packaging than pictured on amazon) provides a decent Blu-ray transfer in both English and Italian then an English and Italian ""unfixed"" versions, but it does not really say what was ""fixed.""  The packaging calls it ""non-dnred"" and in the interview included in the special features, director Umberto Lenzi is asked what he thinks about the practice of other filmmakers interspersing scenes to add to the gore factor, etc. to another director's finished work.  It becomes a mystery more perplexing than the plot of the movie.  The 1974 movie is presented in high definition widescreen, in color, 94 min. and is a very advanced and different giallo in the norm of the giallo.  Ennio Morricone provides one of his finest themes.  Lenzi has directed in many genres.  An earlier effort with Richard Harrison called ""Sandok"" AKA: ""The Mountain of Light"" and ""Spasmo"" were the best I've seen.  Although ""Orgasmo"" AKA ""Paranoia"" has some really great things about it, the ultimate effect with the outright demoralizing ending keep it from being seen for its assets.",1442966400,6,1767,5.2785714285714285
7975981,1,B00007G1Y8,"""Spasmo"", Umberto Lenzi's 1974 giallo misfire, is chock full of beautiful people, lush cinematography, gorgeous Italian locations and missed opportunities. Anyone remotely familiar with this genre of filmmaking knows that plot often takes a backseat to the more exploitative elements of sex and (sometimes graphic) violence. In the hands of more capable directors, this is not always a hindrance. Both Dario Argento and Mario Bava, just to name two, have blended plot inconsistencies (a charitable description) with potent imagery to create memorable, and sometimes classic, examples of the giallo. Not so, ""Spasmo"". Featuring lovely Suzy Kendall (briefly the giallo queen du jour), handsome leading man, Robert Hoffman, a weirdly interesting storyline and Ennio Morricone's haunting score, all the pieces were in place for director Lenzi to have cranked out a serviceable, if not exactly formidable, entertainment. Yet, that didn't happen and, unfortunately, it's more than mere plot inconsistencies that sink Lenzi's film. With precious little of the sex or bloodshed that most giallos traditionally rely on, the central ""mystery"" of this story is too convoluted to hold up under the weight of all the histrionics of its lead characters, their fervent comings and goings that, ultimately, add up to very little.

In ""Spasmo"", we have someone running around the stunningly photographed Italian coast stabbing store mannequins and leaving them lying around to be discovered by the area's disparate citizenry. At the same time, wealthy young Christian (Hoffman), out for a stroll with some young lass, comes across the unconscious Ms. Kendall, who has been unceremoniously deposited on a local beach. She awakens with no apparent memory of what's happened to her and then speeds away in (I think) Christian's car. Instantly smitten, Christian wastes no time in dumping his current companion and hurries off to woo this mystery woman. There's a romance, of sorts, although that really doesn't stop our hero from bedding down with another mysterious woman, who appears to be the wife of a local tenant. But, are any of these people who they claim to be? There's a lot of chasing around, people seemingly die and come back to life, more slashed mannequins pop up, Christian becomes bug-eyed and fears that he's going mad while Suzy Kendall moans, ""I'm not a strong woman...""

If all this sounds interesting, it isn't. It's an absolute bore. And that's Lenzi's (and the film's) downfall. You can put together a giallo that doesn't make a lick of sense but if you don't include the vital genre ingredients, you'd better have an intelligent script, a lot of action or something that moves the story along. Otherwise, you end up with a torpid time waster like ""Spasmo"".",1441411200,3,2761,5.216216216216216
7975982,4,B00007G1Y8,I enjoy Italian horror movies of this era. This one was a bit different from the rest.,1439942400,,86,4.117647058823529
7975983,5,B00007G1Y8,"""Spasmo"" gave me quite a surprise.  It has unseated ""Seven Blood-Stained Orchids"" as my favorite giallo from Umberto Lenzi, director of the notorious cannibal movies such as ""Eaten Alive"" and ""Make Them Die Slowly.""  Surprisingly enough, you wouldn't think the same man directed ""Spasmo"" and ""Eaten Alive.""  There is very little gore or nudity.  What you do have is a lot of weirdness and strangeness from beginning to end.  While watching this giallo, I kept asking myself, ""What is going on here?  Where is this leading?  Why do these people keep acting so strange?  Why are there so many plastic female mannequins hanging from the trees with nooses around their necks and knives in their bellies?""

  The first murder doesn't take place until nearly two-thirds into the movie.  I was beginning to wonder if ""Spasmo"" was truly a giallo.  My patience was rewarded, however.  Towards the end there are numerous twists and the bodies pile up.  All the loose ends are nicely wrapped up.  The plastic ""dolls"" are explained, and it wasn`t a fraternity playing tricks.

  You won't soon forget the ending of ""Spasmo.""  It will haunt my dreams for a long time.  I never saw it coming.  Whereas the plot for ""Seven Blood-Stained Orchids"" was more linear and predictable, the plot for ""Spasmo"" was wildly unpredictable.  (In all fairness, some of the death scenes in ""Seven Blood-Stained Orchids"" were truly gruesome and unique.)  It is unlike anything I've seen from Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci, Mario Bava, or Sergio Martino.  ""Spasmo"" is a truly unique giallo.

  Furthermore, Giallo queen Suzy Kendall (of Dario Argento's ""The Bird With the Crystal Plumage"" and Sergio Martino's ""Torso."") gives an excellent performance in ""Spasmo.""  Legendary composer, Ennio Morricone provides a beautifully haunting score.  The ocean scenery is breathtakingly gorgeous; the stone beach house is very gothic.

  ""Spasmo"" is a must have for giallo fans.  It has been made a permanent part of my collection.  The revelation ending is to die for.",1210464000,11,2023,5.08256880733945
