7199493,5,B00XT383CW,"A great movie! I recommend the companion book, by the same name.

 This movie is the story of how the creator of animal shelters truly loved animals, and saved every one he could. Then, throughout the years, the ""shelter"" business became more concerned with politics and the status quo, than with saving animals. They began lying to us, getting lazy and greedy, and animals paid the lethal price. That has changed, and the No Kill Revolution is bringing love and dedication back into animal sheltering, and lives are being saved. But many more need to be saved. Please watch this movie, and get active in YOUR community to ensure that it is one where Pets are loved, and revered, to the point of becoming No Kill!",1436745600,8,713,4.650793650793651
7199494,5,B00XT383CW,"I have seen this yesterday evening in a public viewing in Huntsville, Al, where the No-Kill Huntsville group is trying to change over from kill to no-kill Shelter with much resistance (as for I can tell) from the local Pound.
The movie is about the history and how the humane treatment of animals/no-kill started with one man in a big City and after his death it went all back and the spark got lost. For a while that is. There are some sad pictures, not to many, so I would  not recommend this with very young children.
It is definably very interesting for anyone who loves, rescues, cares for and has pets.",1435017600,11,608,4.428571428571429
7199495,5,B00XT383CW,"A powerful and inspiring film that documents how the animal welfare movement was born in the USA, how it lost its way, and how a grassroots movement is working to bring it back to the core mission of saving lives. The film is not graphic, but has some disturbing content that is very much over-powered by the incredible stories of redemption - how animal shelters all over the USA have ended the systemic killing of healthy and treatable pets and, instead, have become true centers for life-saving. Really a great story!",1434326400,20,520,4.725274725274725
7199496,5,B00XT383CW,"I do a Shelter Animal Project with an argumentative essay and donation earrings and refrigerator magnets with my students every year and it's stunning to see how heartless a few of them have been over the years. For the first time this year, I had this movie to show in addition to my countless other photos, videos, and stories. ""Redemption"" was a game changer! I have a much higher percentage of real advocates this year and no snotty comments.",1458777600,5,446,4.658227848101266

7199498,5,B00XT383CW,"This film shows how all ""dog pounds"" should be run. There is no need to kill most of the dogs and cats that get taken in by these facilities.

7199500,1,B00XT383CW,This could have been a good movie but all it does is bash shelters.  It totally skipped the key points of how to get to No Kill which were covered in detail in the book.  It gave a brief mention of Spay/Neuter and that was it.  VERY Disappointed.,1438560000,3,246,4.083333333333333

7199502,2,B00XT383CW,This video is about shelters in wealthy areas of the United States and seems to be unaware of the small towns that have little population to support an animal shelter and fewer people to adopt the animals they must rescue and care for. We all work hard for a common cause and it hurts when some infers that we are not doing a good job when we are working as hard as we can with the little income we can muster up and the population demographics we must deal with.,1437091200,7,463,4.155555555555556
7199503,5,B00XT383CW,"An animal lovers need to stop the killing in shelters nationwide shows that it is possible and has worked wherever it is tried. Historical background about the founder of the SPCA is fascinating and should be heard.
The film has only be shown at special screenings, but should get a theatrical or cable release to help spread the movement.",1437091200,7,339,4.762711864406779
7199504,4,B00XT383CW,Moving documentary of the No Kill movement. Chronicles the early days of the ASPCA and how they abandoned their founder's vision. Rebounds the fight with municipalities and unsympathetic shelter management that results in a veritable killing field for animals they should be healing and re-homing.

8716565,1,B00XT383CW,"What a load of complete and utter BS.  These people are clueless, No-Kill = Slow Kill.

Thanks to no kill the leading cause of death for healthy cats is being flattened by a car tire.  5.6 Cats run over by cars each year compared to 1.5 million humanely euthanized in shelters.

""No kill"" is a fraudulent program run by short-sighted, selfish, biologically-illiterate people incapable of facing the inevitable reality of death, and who under the guise of being ""humane"" inflict untold suffering on abandoned domesticated animals and pose an increasingly deadly threat to public health.  They are irresponsible criminals who value their delusional self-image as 'animal saviors' more than they do the lives and safety of their human neighbors, or indeed the animals they claim to 'care' for.

Here's an example of their sick ""priorities"" from just recently: the director of a Hillsborough County, FL 'no-kill' shelter left a three year-old child in the company of a PIT-BULL in her office, which promptly attacked the child when he got too close.  The dog bit the child's arm and lunged for his face, but was restrained by personnel witnessing the attack on the shelter's CCTV system.  What was their response?  They stacked CAT CARRIERS up in front of the CCTV camera so, if this happens AGAIN, there'll be no PHOTO RECORD of it!  THESE are the kinds of idiots who represent the 'no-kill movement'!

And that's just for starters.  Thanks to 'no-kill' one-third of all rabies exposures in the US annually are due to people being bitten or scratched by feral cats.  That's about 13,000 exposures a year, each one requiring PEP--post-exposure prophylactic inoculation--at a cost of from $3,000-$26,000 per person--for which the alternative is almost certain death to anyone proving positive for rabies but not receiving treatment in time.  The greatest rabies outbreak in US history was due to the fraudulent 'no-kill' practice known as ""trap-neuter-return"", where cats from a ""managed"" outdoor colony exposed 665 people in one NH town to rabies in 1994.  It cost that municipality $2 million to treat the victims.

(Gerhold & Jessup, Journal of Zoonosis and Public Health, 2012; CDC 09/26/16)

Thanks to 'no-kill' a cat-vectored parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, has proliferated to densities of 3 to 434 per square foot, and persists and remains infectious in the environment for 1.5 to 4.5 years.  Toxoplasmosis has contaminated our food chain and improperly protected municipal and rural drinking water supplies.  It has infected 50% of the deer population in Ohio and other parts of the northeast US.  It's even contaminating filter-feeding mollusks and fin-fishes in nearshore marine waters (the parasites egg-cells survive in seawater), is causing chronic miscarriages among Native North Americans in the Pacific Northwest who subsist on whale meat, and is killing whales, dolphins, seals, walrus, sea otters, waterfowl and shorebirds from Canada to New Zealand.  The egg-cells encyst in both animal and plant tissues. They contaminate vegetable gardens, row crop soils, pastures, livestock forage and feed lots, game animal browsing areas, parks, schoolyards, children's play areas--ANYWHERE an infected cat defecates, shedding tens of millions of T. gondii egg-cells each time

(Aramini, Stephen et al, Epidemology and Infection, 1999; Ajmal, Maqbool et al, African Journal of Microbiological Research, 2013; Grigg, Raverty et al, University of British Columbia Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 2014; Massey, Ware et al, Veterinary Parasitology 2010; Gerhold/Jessup ibid; CDC 2014).

Thanks to 'no kill', toxoplasmosis is second only to Salmonella as leading cause of fatal food borne illness in the US.  4,500 Americans are hospitalized from it annually, and 300-400 of them die.  70 people a year--mostly children--are blinded by ocular lesions caused by this parasite; it can and does become aerosolized--inhaling or ingesting ONE egg-cell is sufficient to blind, permanently debilitate or kill a child.  It is passed from mother to fetus via intrauterine transmission and causes up to 4,000 stillborn, blind, hydrocephalic, microcephalic and severely mentally-retarded newborns in the US each year.  It is transmitted through breast milk from mother to child and is sexually transmitted with semen.

(Ajmal/Maqbool ibid, Gerhold/Jessup ibid, CDC 2013-2014)

As many as 60 million Americans are infected with toxoplasmosis.  While fully-functioning immune systems suppress major symptoms in healthy adults, children, the elderly and otherwise immunocompromised people are vulnerable.  Which means that all of us who survive to reach old age will become vulnerable to any T. gondii egg-cells embedded in our tissues as our immune systems weaken with age.  And once they embed in our tissues, they're there to stay (CDC 2014).

Thanks to 'no-kill' and its irresponsible proliferation-by-neglect of homeless dogs and cats, one out of every three black children living in poverty in the US are infected with either Toxocara catii or T. canii--parasitic roundworms that adversely affect development of no one knows how many of these children.  And these are only three of over thirty potentially fatal cat-vectored diseases transmissible to humans--including but by no means limited to bartonellosis, tularemia, MRSA (an antibiotic resistant strain of Staph aureus called 'the flesh-eating disease'), a likewise antibiotic resistant strain of Salmonella, Leishmaniasis (another flesh-eating disease) and pneumonic, septicemic and bubonic plague (Hotez, Baylor School of Medicine, 2016).

It's hard to decide whether it's most apt to compare these criminally irresponsible ""animal-lovers"" to Jeffery Amherst, ""Typhoid Mary"" or Michigan governor Rick Snyder in terms of the egregious harm they inflict on us and our children.  Perhaps it's best to simply call them out for what they are: domestic terrorists.
 What passes for the ""logic"" of no-kill is that it's somehow ""inhumane"" to send an animal to sleep with a painless sedative but ""humane"" to allow abandoned animals to die cast-off, forgotten and alone from untreated injuries and diseases. There is nothing whatsoever logical--or humane--about such perverted, heartless and ill-conceived ideology.  Putting suffering out-of-sight by driving it into abandoned lots, alleyways, sewers or ruined buildings doesn't end the suffering.  Only misguided people get to 'feel better' about it.",1495497600,,6451,5.517276422764228
