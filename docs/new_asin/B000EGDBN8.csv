8109357,5,B000EGDBN8,"I will first preface with saying that I am not a major opera fan but I am a MAJOR Placido Domingo fan.  These scenes are well chosen to show him at his most dramatic and most photogenic.  All of them made me wish more had been included in the chosen scenes.  The costumes are wonderful and when Domingo sings, he reveals an intimacy in his face that adds to the perfect sound of his voice.  For any Domingo fan this is something you will really enjoy.",1306972800,4,451,4.209302325581396
