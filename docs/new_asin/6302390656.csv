456965,5,6302390656,"While many compared this Samurai flick to the movies of Akira Kurosawa, I feel that this is an unfare comparison. It's like measuring every mafia movie made against the Godfather trilogy.

While the storytelling is some what disjointed at times and it is a bit liberal with historical accuracy, the scenery and battle scenes are well worth viewing in this epic. It will definitely help any viewer to have an actual knowledge of the real-life history behind the stories two main characters (Uesugi Kenshin, Takeda Shingen). These two great warlords armies met 7 times over 15 years at the same plain in Northern Japans Alps. It is a truly fascinating story typical of the era known as Sengoku Jidai, or the ""Age of the Waring States"" in Japan.

The cinematography and acting are excellent. The battle scenes however are the true gem in this film. I have not seen medieval battle scenes done as well as this in film with the one exception being Braveheart.

Of note: Much of this film was shot in Canada using several thousand college students as extras.

Besides folks, how many ""epic"" samurai films are there to begin with (dont even mention ""Last Samurai"" to me!!!) and how many of those ever make it to the US or are available with english subtitles. Trust me, if you like films about samurai history/battles (not just lone/wandering/angry/pissed off samurai)you will dig this flick. For REAL fans of this movie, you can now (after 14 years) find the DVD on EBAY for $5. Why so cheap? Its only in Japanese w/ Chinese subtitles. Oh well.

Want to see it on DVD w/ English subtitles? Then start emailing Lionsgate Films to get off their butts and get it done!!! Here are two emails for them to send your thoughts to:

456966,3,6302390656,"If it weren't for the elaborate costumes and the massive battle scenes, this would have been a below-average B movie. On second thought, even with the elaborate costumes and massive battle scenes, this is a below-average B movie. The plot is superficial, totally unrealistic (even with my limited knowledge of 16th century feudal Japan), full of continuity holes, logical inconsistencies, and is just plain stupid and unbelievable. The movie takes itself way too seriously, from the hilariously ponderous English narration (courtesy of Stuart Whitman) to the pseudo-strategic battle sequences. The acting is atrocious, the editing amateurish, and the music... there are no words to describe THAT abomination. Even Kurosawa's somewhat dubious musical tastes appear like Mozart to a crazy monkey at the keyboard on a broken organ. Surely nobody does jidai-geki like Kurosawa, but they should at least try.

The worst offender has to be the supposedly epic battle scenes. The director does not skimp on the numbers: there's hundreds of soldiers running in all directions, horses galloping, lancers prancing, and musketeers firing. Some people also fall to the ground. But nary a drop of blood is spilled in the entire film, not even when someones throat is apparently sliced open. Nothing. Na-Da! I am not bloodthirsty, and I certainly think that it's possible to make an engaging battle scene without gallons of red sauce, but Kadokawa certainly can't do it. Oh, and by the way most filming was done in Canada using Native American Tribes for Samurai, Give-Me-A-Break!!

The Takeda side of the story,is told better by Inagaki Hiroshi in his SAMURAI BANNERS starring Toshiro Mifune. That's the one you want to see anyway.",1104796800,5,1718,5.243636363636363
456967,5,6302390656,"I already own a shabby version of this film in VHS format.  (Recorded off of television.)  I would not reccommend buying this film until it becomes available on dvd.  A movie this good should be available in the best format possible.  If all of us customers make a stand and not buy (or watch) bad movies until the good ones are finally released in dvd format, the world will be a much better place.  Personally I like watching bad movies, there is no shortage of them!",1083888000,5,469,4.406976744186046
456968,5,6302390656,"This is a somewhat difficult film to dissect. This indeed should be regarded as one of the great samurai films.  I first saw this when I was 13 on Bravo Channel, and after 2 years of seeking it out, finally owned it on video.
  This was the movie that got me my love for samurai movies.  It is, however, bound to be tested against Kurosawa.  Kurosawa's films, mined you this is coming from an historian, is based on the scrolls from the Japanese Warring Daimyo period; rivers of blood.  You can notice, and this is most evident in his movie ""Ran"", almost literal rivers of blood flowing from the dead, almost to the point where it is disproportional for a human.
  This is not sick delight behind the director, but a tribute to ancient Japanese art, and to reality if you think about it.
  One thing you will also notice about Akira Kurosawa's films is the fact he avoids showing in depth melee scenes.  Plenty of charges, barrages, arrow volleys, and men dying, but I can't remember too well people actually getting up close and clashing spears in ""Ran"" and ""Kagemusha"".  That is where this movie has a strong point.  You actually see combat.  Granted this is where there is a check and balance between the two movies: ""Ran"" and ""Kagemusha"": Lots of blood, no combat
""Heaven and Earth"": Lots of combat, no blood
  Off of the direct comparison, this movie succeeds on many levels; it has great scenery (and I don't think the word ""great"" is giving this movie's scenery due justice), it has fantastic armor, and stunning, and I do mean, stunning and epic battle scenes.
  Most people who have seen this film are fond of the musical score, and it does suit the film, but it's really a matter of musical taste.  The soundtrack to ""Kessen"" (a Japanese-made PS2 game with a breathtaking Oscar-worthy musical score) has quite and serene music for the calm scenes, whereas this, during a quiet love scene, has music that seems somewhat obnoxious.  When on surround sound, everything would be quiet except for chirping birds, and then the first note of a song would, randomly and unexpected, appear at full blast, like a soap opera effect, and more than one times it made me jump.
  On the note of historical accuracy, from a person who has many years in the study of this period, I can say this movie follows what happened very well.  The 4th Battle of Kawanakijama is almost exactly like it happened.
  I do think the narration should have been in Japanese, some of the actors could have done a slightly better job, and yes, they could use some blood when stabbing someone or slitting their throats.
  Overall, I can say this movie is among the great samurai films, and any collector or someone with interest like me should not go without it!  This may not exactly be pleasing to say, a Lethal Weapon type of audience, but for people who can appreciate good cinema, and epic movies with powerful stories, this is a must have.",1074124800,7,2919,4.593810444874275
456969,4,6302390656,"Inevitably people compare this to Kurosawa's works. While the characters are not as realized as the standard Kurosawa film, Heaven & Earth has superior choreography and costumes. Visually it appeals more than Kurosawa's work just because the editing and camera work is crisper and more active.
As far as direction goes, while Kurosawa is usually better it is not the difference between a master and apprentice. It's more like the difference between a legend and a master.",1067817600,5,471,5.12987012987013

456972,3,6302390656,"I watch this movie this weekend on a movie channel. It was interesting... but not as good as a Kurosawa film. The battle scenes were wonderful. The colour of the film was stunning. Beautiful eye candy. Some of the actors could have acted better I would say. Well I judge that on a scale which has Toshiro Mifune at the top, and after watching many Mifune movies it is disappointing to watch one with out him it seems to me. I really don't think the english guy who talks between scenes was needed. Well, they should have made the guy Japanese and it would have worked better. It was still a good movie but I wouldnt rate it up there with Seven Samurai or Yojimbo or Hidden Fortress or Ran.",1026086400,,689,4.3076923076923075
456973,4,6302390656,"A visually stunning film with sharp cinematography, beautiful use of colors, and lush scenery.  A true feast for the eyes.  There are also plenty of battle sequences on a large grand scale that surpass what was seen in Kurosawa's RAN in scope, but not necessarily in intensity or emotional impact.  Still, this film based on the infamous struggles between two great warriors(Takeda Shingen & Kagetora/Kenshin) should be required viewing for those into these types of films.  Also, check out Kurosawa's KAGEMUSHA for his take on the conflict between Shingen and Oda Nobunaga.  And if you'd like to re-inact these battles, check out the pc game SHOGUN:TOTAL WAR.",1017273600,6,660,5.130841121495327
7825000,5,6302390656,"One of the truly great Japanese movies. Not a fantasy, which I usually love, but this is based on history, and is emotionally compelling.  Great war scenes without being very bloody!  The drama is naturally built up, and the scenes are, to me, stunningly beautiful.  I love the cinematography of oriental films.",1408060800,,311,4.9423076923076925
7825001,5,6302390656,This is a spectacular film visually.  I had seen it years ago and made a copy off the tube but it had deteriorated and so I sought another copy for home viewing.

I found to my sorrow that there isn't one available here int he US. The cinematography is wonderfully done, the scenery is gorgeous (Alberta, Canada) and the story is absorbing, even with subtitles. It was filmed in Canada in the hope of trying to capture the look of ancient Japan before the heavily populated scenes we know today. I applaud the makers for doing this, as many parts of Japan are mountainous and must have been even more lovely in ancient times.  I hope to see this on DVD soon!",1327363200,,632,4.401709401709402
7825005,5,6302390656,"A very good friend I have worked with for years was born in Japan. I told him about this movie that I captured to DVD on the IFC channel and he immediately knew of it. He says this movie is accurate and is a story as well as a history lesson. Aside from that stimulating fact, I think the film is well acted, well shot with beautiful scenery at all times and action packed. I am glad I have it and am more interersted in history like this than just a good story someone made up in their mind.

My Japanese friend gives me the impression that historic times like this are as important to Japanese as say the Civil war is to Americans. It is how their country was shaped. Strongly recommended.",1323993600,,691,4.195488721804511
7825006,5,6302390656,"I really enjoyed Heaven and Earth.  The battle between the two warlords brings tension. You get emerged in the battle strategies.  You see how power can destroy a friendship. You see how each warlord loses ones he loves because of war.

If destiny brought the two warlord into battle then it would be it would not be the destiny for each warlord to destroy each other.

Lord Kagetora takes the position of the mountain. Kagetora believes he will win by worshipping the Mountain God and inspiring his men to fight to unify Japan. The black flag of Kagetora moves against the red flag of Takeda.  Takeda believes he has Kagetora trapped on the mountain and finds Kagetora unwillingness to fight him on the plains disturbing.  Takeda has generals that know Kagetora strategies, men who believed Takeda more powerful than Kagetora.  Kagetora burns Takedas bridge and then escape off the mountain in the early morning fog.  Takeda is waiting for reinforcements and a battle ensues.  Kagetora general shoot a lead woman warrior off her horse.  Takeda women warriors are killed as they try to inspire Takeda to launch an ""all out"" offensive.  Takeda shot foolishing advances forward and Takeda's general can not protect the son, who dies, after being surrounded.  Takeda realizes the battle is lost and retreats.  At the river Kagetora and Takeda fight with swords and Takeda is injured.  However, Kagetora is warded off as reinforcement troop magestically arrive and push back Red.  Kagetora rides through like Alexander the Great through through the retreating Takeda army.

One of the saddest scenes was the betrayal by Kagetora's friend. Kagetora discovers the betrayal and challenges the friend to a duel.  Kagetora wins the duel and kills his friend. Kagetora had to be powerful in front of his men and kill his friend.

Nami plays her flute to remind Kagetora of her suffering and desire to find harmony.  The two can never be together.  Nami could never betray her father by loving his executioner.  Both parties have to depart from each other because of duty even though they love each other.",1323820800,2,2094,4.9426934097421205
7825007,5,6302390656,"I love this film. First saw it on TNT and later on FLIX & SUNDANCE - gripping story that won't disappoint. Too bad it is not more well known in USA I think it would be a cult classic here if it were. Just wanted to let people know it is avaiable on DVD but i don't think in the USA. My family actually found it form a Euro DVD shop for my birthday and said it wasn't an easy find but if you buy overseas make sure its a Region 1 DVD or it won't play on your DVD player. The menu is in Japanese so make sure you have a subtitles button on you remote, other than that the narration is in English and the subtitles are easier to read on DVD than on TV. I love everything about this movie and would recommend it to anyone. I really would like a copy of the love theme, is there a soundtrack available?",1276646400,,797,3.8658536585365852
7825008,4,6302390656,"I just watched this movie for the first time literally five minute ago.
This film has some very good points and a few very bad points. I'll be brief.

Good -
Fairly good story, some decent character development, very dramatic battle scenes (the black army versus the red army stood out well even on a worn VHS tape), and an all around interesting time period.

Bad -
No blood to the point where it was ridiculous. Battle scenes are big but not very realistic looking.
Thoroughly pointless attempt at adding a love story. This is particularly unrealistic if you know anything about the samurai and the political climate. HORRIFIC 80s SYNTHESIZER MUSIC.

SPOILER ALERT-
The worst scene is the 'climatic' battle between Kagatora and Takeda. Besides being historically inaccurate, (Kagatora in the real battle charged Takeda who blocked the sword strike with his war fan and Kagatora took off) the final battle just came across as ridiculous. The two actors swing their swords wildly on horseback and look like they aren't even trying. Takeda at one point looks as though he could get Kagatora in the back easily and just kind of twirls his sword in the air.

Overall a good entertaining movie if you like the samurai genre. I'm not going to compare this to that one famous Japanese director because no one makes movies like he did. If you are a student of the time period it's interesting to watch for the visuals but be prepared to be annoyed by the historical inaccuracies.",1240790400,3,1472,4.76078431372549
7825009,4,6302390656,"'Heaven and Earth' is laudable for the fact that it brings a chapter of Japan's Sengoku Period to life. What I found disconcerting was the use of the environs of Canada to set this movie in. While the shots are gorgeous, you know well you are NOT looking at Japan. I know there is little space to film such an epic there. However, I also must submit that Kurosawa was able to convey such a world and he filmed [to my knowledge] almost exclusively in Japan.

The battles between Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin [Kagetora] truly are legendary. Some of the sub-plots are...fiction. As something of a student of Takeda Shingen, I have never come across a character such as the 'Lady Yae' shown in this film. Nor is there an account of 'Lady Usami Nami' in the history of Uesugi that I've read. I might have not seen the actual source if it is true, but I find it hard to believe that a devoted followers of Bishmonten [Uesugi] and Fudo [Takeda] would take up women for more than the obvious needs men have. The practice of 'male love' [a.k.a. 'shudo'] was far more common among the samurai of this period.

While Uesugi and Lady Nami's platonic relationship is better done, Takeda could have done better without the so-called Lady Yae in his retinue. Perhaps the director was attempting to balance Shingen's character. However, a Daimyo would have not been inclined to let such a woman into his ranks unless she had more than toy soldier-women to offer. There simply would have to be a solid, historical source for this to have been the case.

There are some truly striking scenes, but the final duel between Takeda and Uesugi is so false that it left me speechless. Takeda was reputed [by accounts] to have fought off Uesugi directly with his iron warfan, within the confines of his enclosure, in 1561. They never fought, as shown in the film, in the Chikumagawa River. There also were instances where the use of western-style saddles were all too prominently shown on the horses and that throws the viewer who has even a scant sense of Japanese history.

Heaven and Earth is not the worst of films about this period. Indeed, some of the shots and scenes are quite gorgeous to behold. Just don't come into it expecting historical accuracy. Save such discernment for good, written accounts by learned scholars.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samurai-Banners/dp/B00095VKCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samurai Banners</a>",1179532800,5,2454,4.963503649635037
