7177252,5,B00XNMY10M,"On a whim, I decided to take a chance on seeing A Royal Night Out  and Im very happy that I did. The film centers around the characters of Princess Elizabeth (Sarah Gadon) and Princess Margaret (Bel Powley) wanting to get outside of the palace for a little while to learn more about the real world around them. They both successfully convince their parents Queen Elizabeth (Emily Watson) and King George VI (Rupert Everett) to allow them in order to get a sense of what the general public thinks of the royal speeches. Along the way, both Elizabeth and Margaret get themselves into various type of adventures.  Princess Elizabeth also ends up befriending  Jack Hodges (Jack Reynor). Princess Margaret ends up getting help from a local man named Stan (Roger Allam) after getting caught up in a situation.  I want to say more yet must avoid doing so for others who read these words and want to see the film. However, what I do feel comfortable saying is that one reason why I enjoyed the film is that it put a multi-faceted spin on how even women from a prominent family would want to at least briefly enjoy life in a way that they perceive as ordinary. As a writer, I liked how the movie shows the multiple ways that the characters are connected to each other plotwise (such as when Princess Margarets character is shown getting help at a pivotal moment when things could have turned out completely different). One of the bonuses to A Royal Night Movie include The Making of A Royal Night out. The dvd also had some movie trailers to such movies as Mistress of America and Belle.",1477180800,,1578,4.565371024734982
7177253,5,B00XNMY10M,"Believe me. It's very good part of the movie. I love it. How can I tell you it must be true story or not. But in fact, The palace is such like as fish in the bowl in years without freedom. The King and Queen who decided to let their daughters to be break away from the palace for one night. during the War 2 at the time. When the war was over so they needed to go out for pleasure and fun. It can be very dangerous for them by the public eye but in end up they arrived back to home as safety. The young Elizabeth who always depend on her sister Margaret without guard men in every way where Margaret is running away without the guard men till finally Elizabeth catch her in other place where the party was danced by the people. I was pleased to have watch on it. Very Excellent.",1474329600,,778,3.9935897435897436
7177254,4,B00XNMY10M,"This movie is a comedy of errors with romantic tension and a pinch of drama. The pace, great soundtrack and charming actors makes it highly entertaining if you like British humor or if you enjoy classic comic plays with a little  slapstick. This is a movie I can see over and over again. If you're looking for high drama or something historical, this isn't it. If you enjoy big band/swing music, romantic comedies, the styles of WW II and you can't resist a good-looking man in a uniform, this is the movie for you! I think this movie delivers on what it set out to do- to make an entertaining, funny film with a great ensemble cast.",1473465600,,633,4.410256410256411

7177266,5,B00XNMY10M,"I loved it!!!  The characters are amazing!  One of my favorite scenes was when the King gave his speech.  While detractors may say
not believable, I say based on what.  I felt it was totally believe. As a mom who has raised kids, everything and anything can happened and these two may very well have sneaked out of a bit of fun.  The daughters were adorable. Can't decide which one was my
favorite.  If you watched the trailer, it delivered exactly what the trailer said it would deliver.  Loved the gloves, the clothes, the King and Queen.  Is a perfect mom, daughter movie night or a family night movie.  Excellent fun movie to introduce  young people with the subject of WWII, the before and after of the war.",1465516800,,712,4.4921875
7177267,3,B00XNMY10M,"A mildly entertaining film about the story of the end of WWII from the perspective of the Princesses Elizabeth & Margaret.  It is based very  loosely on the true story of the night they joined Londoners incognito to celebrate the end of WWII.  They both longed to feel normal and convinced King George & the Queen Mum to let them join the public.  They were assigned two military officers who were to protect them from harm.  They had their eyes on drinks & ladies and the two precocious princesses gave the officers the slip.  The two princesses got quite an education that night!  The acting was subpar,  I'm afraid.",1465344000,3,618,4.605504587155964
7177268,2,B00XNMY10M,"An absolutely unbelievable, silly film!  A mythical story of how Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret persuaded the King and Queen to let them leave Buckingham Palace for VE Day celebrations!  Of course, they have two officers to escort them to the Ritz-----get separated and Elizabeth with the help of a disgraced enlisted guy tries to locate Margaret.  There is a lot of running around, going to pubs, brothels, back alleys, and it all is just so made up and not even done very well.

Rupert Evert is totally unsuited to play King George VI and Emily Watson as Queen Elizabeth isn't much better.  These are two very talented actors and it's a shame that their skills were wasted in this movie.  I wasn't familiar with the actresses who played Elizabeth and Margaret but they were totally out of character---except for the Princess Margaret role as she did get into the party scene even in her later years!

I thought this would be a fun mad-cap movie, but it was truly a waste of time.  I watched for about an hour and gave up!  Much more interesting and more accurate films about the Royal family are out there------The King's Speech tops them all!",1465171200,3,1148,4.6716417910447765
7177269,5,B00XNMY10M,"A Royal Fantasy of a romp through 1940 London that is just lots of fun .  Princess Elizabeth and especially Princess  Margaret  are delightful and  ever so funny in such an upper crust British fashion .  All the actors are perfect  as the Royal Family  .  It is also visually a beautiful film .  As the English say ""Jolly Good Fun!""",1463011200,9,332,4.311475409836065

7177272,3,B00XNMY10M,"This might be the only chance she gets. It is V.E. Day and the entire country of England is celebrating the victory over Hitler. Princesses Elizabeth (Gadon) and Margaret (Powley) want to celebrate like the rest of the country rather than stay home in the palace. When permission is given they are excited. When they give their chaperons the slip the two experience something that most royalty cant. True anonymity, and all the troubles that come with it. Before I begin I know I am not the target audience for this so take my review with a grain of salt. That said, the movie wasn't as bad as I was expecting, but it was still fairly generic and really felt like a PBS movie. Im not sure how historically accurate this was but I have a hard time thinking it's even 50% right. That fact aside I was actually able to watch this without my mind wandering too much. The movie wasn't terrible but it wasn't something that made me rethink the genre either. This is watchable but really just flat and generic. If you like movies that are essentially period pieces or a fan of Downton Abbey then you will enjoy this much more than I did. Overall, not as bad as I was expecting but nothing all that amazing and really just too generic and flat for me to even have a real opinion about. I give this a C+.",1462060800,5,1295,4.355371900826446

7177274,5,B00XNMY10M,"Saw this movie on a Princess Cruise. Just loved it. A great movie, well written and directed. The actors were outstanding. They were so natural that you truly believed their characters. My sister and I watched this movie 5 times during our 2 week cruise. It was that good. We had 60 movies to choose from but going back to this one. Pls bring the proper DVD format for the USA.",1451952000,6,377,4.323943661971831
7177275,3,B00XNMY10M,"Here's the first thing you need to know about A Royal Night Out if you're going to enjoy it at all: throw the history books into the fireplace.  This frivolous and spunky trifle is set in London in 1945 on VE Day when Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret were allowed celebrate the end of WWII on the streets of London with the commoners. What happened that night? Apparently lots of dancing, flirting, and making out with handsome soldiers. Chances are nothing like this happened at all, but imagining that it did turns out to be quite a lot of fun.

Directed by Julian Jarrold, whose refined tastes veer from the stuffy Brideshead Revisited to the cheeky Kinky Boots, the film stars Sarah Gadon as the future queen, Elizabeth aka ""Lillabets"", and breakout star Bel Powley as Margaret aka ""P2"" because she's like the runner-up princess. While it takes a bit of convincing for King George (Rupert Everett, bringing the famous stutter seen in The King's Speech) to convince the current Queen Elizabeth (Emily Watson), the girls are allowed to hit the streets incognito for a night of frivolity, music, and questionable decisions. Basically, they get to be real girls not figureheads stuck behind Buckingham Palace's walls.

Part of those questionable decisions involves ditching the stick-in-the-mud guards assigned to them, but it also leads to Margaret and Elizabeth getting separated. Not good since Margaret turns out to be a drunken tart, hilariously slurred speech and all, who throws herself at any handsome soldier boy within reach. Margaret is the semi-responsible but impassioned one, and even she falls under the gaze of a cynical infantryman (Jack Reynor) who has just enough of a good heart to escort her throughout the night. Isn't he just such a gentleman? They argue, mostly in broad strokes about the war and its meaning, but never enough to snuff the romantic sparks.

There isn't much in the way of conflict to speak of, but then that's probably a good idea. The two biggest sources of tension are whether Elizabeth will *shocker* kiss that handsome soldier at the end of the night; and if the King will punish them for staying out too late. Can you ground a royal princess? Set against a jazzy big-band score, A Royal Night Out breezes along effortlessly with a fanciful spirit. Gadon, who too often plays buttoned-up and serious, gets to loosen up a little bit. Just a little. Powley is fantastic once again, but it would have been nice to see more of her and Gadon together. They're separated far too long when its the dynamic between the two princesses, finally out and free in the world, which is of greater interest than Elizabeth's first taste of puppy love.",1450656000,2,2680,4.857768052516412
7177276,4,B00XNMY10M,"I really enjoyed this movie.
Probably, as a movie, only three stars (not bad, but not spectacular).
Four stars for enjoyment factor (Five stars for Anglophiles - which I am).
Five stars for the performances which are very good.
So... four star average.
The first two thirds is fluffy fun but the last third is where the heart of the movie really takes hold. I actually have seen this movie twice. It is not perfect movie making, but great fun, and touches on some interesting (albeit not original) ideas. It's not revolutionary, but that is fine. I like sentimental.",1450051200,2,566,4.7272727272727275

8716361,5,B00XNMY10M,"Queen Elisabeth II should be very pleased to have been portrayed by Sarah Gadon in this movie. It takes place on 8 May 1945 into the wee hours of 9 May when WWII officially ended in Europe. Princess Elisabeth was then 19. This story is based on an imagined adventure shared by Elisabeth and her younger sister Princess Margaret. In fact Margaret was then only 14 and was not allowed to go out that night as England celebrated VE Day, but the myth is fun. When the myth is more fun than the fact, film the myth!",1517875200,,510,4.268041237113402
