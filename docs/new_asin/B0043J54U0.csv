8415013,3,B0043J54U0,"The picture and description shows 30 dvds.

Currently it shows only one seller selling it for $249. However when you read the details the seller provides, it states ""This is the Veggie Tales DVD Library - Includes 30 VeggieTales episodes on 10 themed DVDs in carrying case"".

Based on their details, that is the same set you can get on here for a little as $99.

Also as to the value of the dvd's. The creators website sells 46 dvds for $449 which includes the whole collection excluding penguins and larry boy series.

The best value buy you can make is to buy the 10 dvds with 30 episodes then purchase the remaining 14-16 episodes individually for around $5-7 each depending on where you purchase them. That saves you over $230 for the same whole set on creators website for $449.",1352764800,19,783,4.531914893617022

I purchased this set for my grandson and love to see his face light up as soon as he hears the music. Wonderful product!",1329177600,4,243,4.304347826086956

I would agree with you about the price of this product, but if you examine the two products closely on both websites this is a different product. The product on Christianbook.com is a set of 10 DVDS with 30 episodes compressed into themed DVDs: western, princesses, heros etc. The product on Amazon is a set of 30 DVDs with at least two episodes on each DVD which makes at least 60 episodes in all and they are mostly the originaly released DVDs not compressed themed DVDs like on Christianbook.com, so this is actually a pretty good deal. You pay less than $5 for each DVD :o)",1303776000,40,597,4.486238532110092
