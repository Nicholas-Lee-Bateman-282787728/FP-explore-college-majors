4846191,3,B005NFJATO,"First of all, Planet Earth is awesome. I wish I could say the same for ""Life"" but I couldn't watch it!!

The Disc didn't work in my Sony Blu Ray Player. I contacted the seller, Simon Tang, and he said he'd ship me a replacement.

The replacement never came.

I contacted him and he said there must have been a mix up and he just shipped it out and I should have it in a week.

Again, 3 weeks later, still no replacement. Now it's way past the 30 day return policy and I got scammed out of half my purchase because the seller, Simon Tang screwed me.

BEWARE OF Simon Tang. Buy from some other reputable vendor.",1345939200,9,609,4.127118644067797
4846192,5,B005NFJATO,"this boxset is amazing and very educational, first off , the picture quality on
these blu-rays are amazing, its hours upon hours of high def glory plus you are
learning while being amazed, i highly recommend this set",1345939200,,216,4.7105263157894735
4846193,5,B005NFJATO,"This collection is excellent. I have watched this series in other oportunity and I think than this edition has two of better nature series that I have watched. Although this edition is on Blueray, both documentals are in 1080i, but video quality very is good and  sound is great.

I really have enjoyed it again.",1344729600,,312,4.654545454545454
4846194,5,B005NFJATO,"Don't know what I can add that hasn't been said, but to reiterate ...

The cinematography on this set is simply out of this world! If you're watching on a blu-ray player, with a quality Hi-Def TV, you're going to feel like you're there!! If you're watching on a DVD player, with a mediocre TV, you will see the production level on this set is such that it will STILL make a viewing difference.

The production quality of these two programs is of the best quality. And David Attenborough is one of my favorite narrators.

So, in short - if you're at ALL on the fence (why, when the reviews are so high!?), simply do yourself a favor and buy this set!",1344643200,,649,4.30327868852459
4846195,1,B005NFJATO,"Before I go on, note that I'm not knocking the content of either series in the least.  We all know how amazing the production is, and I do prefer David Attenborough over Sigourney Weaver as well.  I purchased the original Planet Earth set when they first came out on Blu-ray and absolutely loved them!  Apparently I loved them too much, as the 2nd disc in the set got a scratch on it and would no longer play, much to my chagrin.

Then I saw this awesome set for a great sale price on Amazon!  I bought it, eagerly awaited it's arrival, and when it came popped them right into the player.  Something was wrong though... something was... off.  Was this a bootleg copy?  Why was the picture quality lower?

Then I saw on the packaging that it's 1080i instead of 1080p.  If you're not familiar with the difference, let me explain.  'i' stands for interlaced, which means when the frames change, instead of the whole frame changing at once only half the frame changes (in a 'window blinds' pattern), then the next half etc, so that the motion is staggered.  Back in the heyday of interlaced television, when you were dealing with a 19"" tube TV with low-definition, relatively static imagery this actually made for a smoother transition.  Nowadays, when you're on a LARGE, HD screen with a lot of motion--which is the situation most people are going to be in when buying blu-rays instead of DVD's--it makes a staggering negative impact.  So you know that awesome shot of that howler monkey flying through the trees?  Well now he leaves behind a stripey trail.  That amazing opening video when it's zoomed in on the flock of birds and then slowly zooms out to show the MILLIONS of them?  Now when it zooms out all the tiny birds are lost in lines and you don't get the sense of the enormity of it all.

If you're not buying this to take advantage of the amazing detail and clarity that normally comes with blu-ray discs, then by all means enjoy your purchase!  If you are, you may want to think twice about this set, do a bit of research through Google to find out which sets are 1080p (and believe me, there's plenty of discussion about it), and grab one of them instead.

To me, when you're buying the newest blu-ray set of something, you're expecting the highest quality video and audio.  The bottom line is that this particular set is the worst quality of any of the several Planet Earth packaging out there.",1344124800,8,2406,4.523148148148148
4846196,5,B005NFJATO,"This is so awesome! My husband and I love watching every episode of these two series, and my son 20 months old loves it too. I would recommend this to everyone!",1343088000,,160,4.193548387096774
4846197,5,B005NFJATO,"Beautiful on my new Sony BDP-S590 paired with a great Samsung TV.

Pros:
Don't have to hear Oprah narrate Life.
DVD extras are finally on the Blue-Ray discs.  Bout time!!
Amazing footage and narration.

Cons:
Can't think of any",1342828800,,227,4.769230769230769
4846198,4,B005NFJATO,"Just bought this complete set when I come over to US, it's almost half price compared to HK!!

Going back to the topic, I read through lots of comment, not only in Amazon, also some other sites. People arguing about the video format (1080i vs 1080p), I took a chance to test a few disc with PS3 in the office right before my flight, I picked 2 discs from Life as well as 2 from Planet Earth. Both discs picked from Life are in 1080p format while both I picked from Planet Earth are 1080i. Outside the box only 1080i is mentioned, so the description is partially correct.

From my research, the only 1080p version of Planet Earth should be the one selling in UK, and it's a 5-disc version (still 1 disc less than the US version), and with region code restrictions.

I do find little quality difference among Life & Planet Earth, but this price I would say it's unbeatable!! The only 1 star deducted is about the packaging, can it be a more rigid box rather paper?",1340150400,5,962,4.333333333333333

4846207,3,B005NFJATO,"5+ stars for content and -2 for the overblown price-tag.  This is basically re-packaging of two existing BBC documentaries with some extras thrown in.  The extras and the new packaging would surely be a gem for some people and my intentions are not to demean the content of this package but to point out it's high expense in comparison to other options on Amazon.  Usually the first two documentaries someone purchases after being introduced to the world of BBC nature documentaries is Planet Earth and Life.  This particular set would not be the best way for most people to start their collection.

If you're interested in getting the most for your money then this would be an extremely bad choice.  At the time this was written the price was $91.  In comparison, at this time for $95, you could get The BBC High-Definition Natural History Collection 1 and 2.  These are both Blu Ray box sets with multiple documentaries included in each.  The BBC N.H.C. 1 has -  Planet Earth, Wild China, Galapagos and Ganges.  The BBC N.H.C. 2 has -  Life, Nature's Most Amazing Events, South Pacific, and Yellowstone.  The version of Life included in N.H.C. 2 is the same version offered here, narrated by David Attenborough.  In this alternate route you would get 8 documentaries instead of two.  I wanted to pass this information along to those who may be new to these incredible BBC documentaries and to those who are looking to add as many as possible within their budget.  Another pointer to anyone new to these BBC documentaries is that you should avoid any of the ""Americanized"" versions because there are truly inferior.  In the American version of Life, narrated by Oprah Winfrey, they take a BBC masterpiece and transform it into an average piece of work.  I hope this info is helpful to some or you out there.",1453161600,9,1808,4.722044728434505

4846212,5,B005NFJATO,"Great TV series's for anyone that isn't already familiar with them.  Only annoyance is that for the spines of the sleeves to face outwards, you have to put the sleeves in facing the opposite direction of the box - in other words, when resting the box face-up, you have to put the sleeves in face down to expose the spines.

Blurays add some behind the scenes features and stories that I haven't noticed on TV broadcasts or Netflix.",1432598400,2,431,4.512820512820513

4846244,5,B005NFJATO,"Make sure you get the David Attenborough narration.  The Sigourney Weaver and Oprah ones aren't the worst I can imagine, but I just think Attenborough is a much more appropriate and knowledgeable narrator for this program.

4846249,1,B005NFJATO,I did not buy the life documentary to constantly hear about evolution.  If you want to make a documentary on evolution please do! But don't hijack a documentary showing the beauty of our current natural world!  Their was no point to constantly discuss evolution.  It just made the documentary more boring and seem like a propaganda tool.  Which I guarantee their agenda was to use this to push evolution.  Not everyone believes in or even cares about evolution.,1408492800,3,461,4.858974358974359
4846250,3,B005NFJATO,"I got this set back in April (brand new) since it was on a good sale, but just opened it up this week and found out I had multiple scratches on multiple disks - some of them looking pretty severe.  Thankfully I have not had any playback issues on the disc with the most severe scratches, but I still have a few more disks to go through before I can rest easy on the matter.

This is a great series collection otherwise.",1405900800,,419,4.097560975609756
4846251,5,B005NFJATO,"I own the standard DVD American-market version of Life, and I watched all episodes of both series on Discovery Channel.  I am ecstatic that David Attenborough's versions are now available to Region 1.  Don't miss out.  The watered-down scripts and the annoying commercial-break fade-outs in the American-market DVDs are gone.  And having watched each of the Life episodes many times on American TV, I noticed right away the extended scenes on the Blu-ray discs.  Naturally the resolution is much crisper than the standard DVDs and can be appreciated with all the necessary close-ups needed to film small animal and plant life.  In Life ""Plants"", you can almost touch the dew droplets on the sundew, and the Venus flytrap looks like it will jump out and grab you.  And I've never seen a fly's eyes with such clarity!  Sorry Oprah, sorry Sigourney.  I love you both, but Sir Attenborough needs to handle this business.  He brings both experience and gravitas to his rich narration.",1402531200,2,979,4.950920245398773

There are a few downsides but they are very minor. ""Life"" recycled a fair bit of content from ""Planet Earth"" and they almost constantly used a film grain effect that hinders the image quality. Too many films use it. XD

Another issue is that the ""Planet Earth"" discs are packaged in sleeves. Scratch magnets. XD

Overall though, both of the documentaries are great. Anyone who loves nature will love this package. Go for it!",1495324800,2,600,4.588785046728972
