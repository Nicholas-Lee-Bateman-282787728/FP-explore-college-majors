8213422,1,B00005K9F3,"Look, we're all aware that there are predators in nature, but with a title like ""Living Edens"", we just weren't prepared for the carnage this documentary offers up.

If watching monkeys rip baby squirrels limb from limb, snakes devour bloody rats, and a variety of animals pick the meat from the bones of migrating turtles is your idea of paradise, then this DVD is right up your alley. Not only does it portray Costa Rica's deadliest predators in disturbing detail (and little else), but the accompanying music is jarring and eerie to boot. We made the mistake of watching this during a meal, on ""date night"". Big mistake.",1295136000,,623,4.768518518518518
8213423,5,B00005K9F3,"I am a huge fan of nature programming - watching for almost half a century now (all the way back to the early day's of Marlin Perkin's Mutual of Omahas Wild Kingdom ! ) If you have seen any program from the Living Edens Series you will unnderstand when I say that it's some of the best, if not the best,nature programming ever produced.

The only problem with this series is that only a couple of episodes have been released on dvd. If anything deserves to be released on dvd it's the entire Living Edens series.",1149033600,,512,4.333333333333333
