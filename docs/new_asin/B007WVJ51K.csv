Absolutely good San Soo Kung Fu dvd.

One of the best San Soo Kung Fu dvds that I have personally encountered. There are very good Kung Fu San soo dvds available however Kung Fu San Soo is frequently trademarked under a different name, marketed and sold at a much higher price, often hundreds of dollars for each dvd set.

This is a very good San Soo Kung Fu dvd.

FYI Kung Fu San Soo  is now trademarked , after production of this dvd, I assume this dvd is dated

I have never heard of either of these Kung Fu San Soo masters, unusual for this time period, Kung Fu San Soo is a relatively small community

A good dvd, with good techniques

Not ""advanced"" Kung Fu San Soo ... Kung Fu San Soo it is...every Kung Fu San Soo technique is advanced to an advanced practitioner of Kung Fu San Soo...Advanced Kung Fu San Soo practitioners know this

I recommend this dvd...A great value at 20$ US

FYI a Kung Fu San Soo instructor was denied entry into the United Kingdom, quite recently, to specifically teach techniques. He markets and sells it under a different name. In fact, a three dvd set is currently available under his trademarked name on Amazon for $150.00 US.

I cannot, in good conscience disclose his name or product here. His seminars are thousands of dollars per student for attendence for three days. His dvd series is good but a premium price.

Finally and again good dvd, value for your money",1487462400,,1418,4.4324324324324325
