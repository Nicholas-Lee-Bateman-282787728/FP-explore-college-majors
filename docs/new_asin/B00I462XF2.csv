6249266,4,B00I462XF2,"The review you are about to read is on the Blu Ray of Godzilla vs The Sea Monster/Ebirah Horror of the Deep released by Kraken Releasing on May 6th, 2014.

Video:
Kraken Releasing delivered the goods. The transfer on this disc is nice and clean. Nothing on this disc comes off as out of place, sloppy or unprofessional. The colors are bright and vibrant, which makes it pleasant on the eyes. A part of me however wishes that they would've used the original Japanese credit sequence instead of the international title sequence, but at the same time it's very trivial, for I feel it doesn't ruin how beautiful the transfer is.

Audio:
The audio quality is very nice as well. Both the Japanese and English audio tracks are mastered into DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 mono. Despite sounding a bit boxy at certain points, both tracks come off very smooth, with no signs of damage. The volume on the English audio track is lower then the Japanese audio track, but not by much, and they're both pleasing to the ears. The Japanese language gives the option of subtitles.

Extras:
The only extra on the Blu Ray is a Theatrical Trailer to the movie with subtitles. Nothing too special, but still a nice bonus that the Sony DVD didn't include.

Overall:
It may be a budget buy considering that there isn't much in the way of special features, but I'd say that it's a good budget buy that's worth picking up if you don't have the Sony DVD, and can't afford it. Kraken Releasing also released this and their other two Godzilla movies on DVD as well, so incase you don't own a Blu Ray player, you have an alternative. I recommend it.",1399593600,22,1613,4.5326460481099655
6249267,5,B00I462XF2,"I was hoping this could possibly have been an AIP dub, which it wasn't. To be fair, nothing in any of the advertising anywhere SAYS this IS an AIP dub, so I took a chance and ordered it. I already have this inferior dub on another disc.
  There's a lot to like about this movie, if you're a fan. Non-fans will groan over it, but this isn't for THEM in the first place. The print is VERY clean, and the sound is as good as 2.0 ever is. Great packaging---solid case, and nice artwork on the front. If you don't have this movie, see it. If you're looking for the original AIP dub, this ain't it. The price is right.",1399507200,2,612,4.091666666666667
6249268,5,B00I462XF2,"This is a well made re master.  Good quality and color saturation.  Comes with scene selections and original Toho Studio credits.  The movie Title in the opening credits is Godzilla vs. The Sea Monster.

I enjoyed watching not only do you find the Sea Monster and Godzilla, also Rodan makes a cameo appearance along with Mothra.  My kind of movie all the monsters in one place.",1399334400,3,377,4.651515151515151

6249316,5,B00I462XF2,"While a lot of people may complain about the lack of Godzilla in this film, I find it to be one of the most well-rounded flicks that he's featured in.  It's true, there isn't a whole lot of Godzilla in this film, and if you go into it expecting a monster throwdown, you'll be disappointed.  However, if you watch this expecting a fun island adventure, you'll love it.  It follows the story of some kids who get led out to see and stranded on an island after their ship is attacked by Ebirah.  Throughout the movie, it chronicles their attempts to escape the island and eventually cross paths with Godzilla.  It's just an all-around fun movie, but don't expect a lot of focus on Godzilla",1464307200,,686,4.456

6249324,5,B00I462XF2,"BOTTOM LINE: I was really pleased that I took the plunge and double-dipped for this spiffy Blu-ray upgrade. GODZILLA VS. THE SEA MONSTER remains one of my all-time favorite G-films and it look & sounds superlative in this 1080p hi-def edition from Kraken Releasing. 5 STARS

THE STORY (contains spoilers): Ryota, a hard-headed young man desperate to find his older brother, (who was lost at sea a few months before), commandeers a well-stocked yacht and sets sail for the south seas with two newly-made friends and a cryptic stranger aboard. The four eventually end up shipwrecked on mysterious Letchi island. But rescue or escape may prove extremely difficult as they soon discover that the island contains a secret base for the Red Bamboo, a nefarious paramilitary organization that is using their island complex to manufacture heavy water, a key ingredient in nuclear weapons. They have been kidnapping peaceful natives from nearby Infant Island, forcing them into slave labor. One of these, a beautiful girl named Daiyo, encounters our four castaways while attempting to escape from the patrolling Red Bamboo soldiers. As a means of insuring that no slaves escape and to keep all others away from the island, the Red Bamboo use the monstrous mutated lobster creature Ebirah, a by-product of their radioactive skullduggery, to patrol the deep waters offshore. Adding to the intrigue, Infant Island just so happens to be the sanctuary of benevolent insectoid demigoddess Mothra. And further complicating matters, (and unbeknownst to the Red Bamboo), Godzilla is slumbering in a seaside cavern on the far end of the island. The sinister schemes of the ruthless Red Bamboo are about to go up in smoke, at least if Daiyo can contact Mothra AND her plucky castaway friends can figure out a way to awaken the mighty Godzilla!

THOUGHTS: A sentimental favorite out of all the G-films, as it was the very first one I ever saw. The plot is straightforward & energetic, and things snowball quickly to the rousing climax that sees the three Toho titans mixing it up while our human heroes scramble to keep from being crushed underfoot in the conflict. Originally written as a third vehicle for Toho's version of King Kong, the idea was scrapped and eventually re-tooled, with Godzilla taking Kong's place. This explains the very anthropomorphic behavior Godzilla engages in throughout the movie. The film is full of lush seaside vistas and impressive island scenery. The color palette is bright and eye-catching. The actors are playing it straight but also having a good time. The monster bouts are splashy & imaginative. First-time G-director Jun Fukuda keeps the proceedings moving quickly and the overall tone light. A bouncy surf-rock infused musical score from Masaru Sato helps further distance this movie from other more somber G-films and, combined with the tropical south sea setting, it makes for a refreshing change of pace. This atypical entry in the Godzilla series is an enjoyable way to spend a breezy 87 minutes.

THE BLU-RAY: Brought to us by the crew at Kraken Releasing, this hi-def version of GODZILLA VS. THE SEA MONSTER looks & sounds amazing. The audio & video quality of this Blu-ray is as impressive an improvement in comparison to the DVD from Sony as the DVD was to a VHS tape. Colors pop. Details & textures lost in all previous home video versions are now crystal clear. Location scenes and the gorgeous seascapes are now truly, breathtakingly impressive. The rich musical score fills your speakers. Simply put, the film has never looked or sounded better. In fact, the only negative is that the beloved English dub track from AIP has once again not been included. The substandard English language track created for Toho's International version of the film, (the same track that Sony used for their DVD release years ago), is what we're stuck with on this new format release. Purists can also enjoy the film in its original Japanese language w/ English subtitles.",1455926400,5,3984,5.033333333333333

Definitely voice over is terrible. Yea I know all zilla movies had bad lip syncing, but this is much worse than the original. The voices don't match the characters at all, one guy in particular sounds like he's been kicked in nuts the whole film.

I'm so upset at this , I may just use this for skeet shooting or put it thru my paper shredder. Major disappointment from the original.

The giant lobster Ebirah lurks offshore, waiting to pick off unwary travelers.  But lo and behold, Godzilla is using this island as a rest stop.  Big ""G"" is awakened by our heroes, and goes at it with Ebirah.  The evil doers are destroyed, the missing brother is found, and all is right with the world.  A very enjoyable film in this series.

6249368,5,B00I462XF2,Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster was the first Godzilla movie I owned as a child and still have the VHS tape. Going from a 22 year old tape to a beautiful blu-ray with Japanese audio made going back a major treat. The film was Jun Fukudas first chance at directing a Godzilla movie and it's lighthearted and fun. If you have small children it's a good measuring stick to see if they'll like Gojira and become lifelong fans like many people do.,1419724800,,439,4.365853658536586
6249369,4,B00I462XF2,There isn't a whole lot of Godzilla here as this may have been written with King Kong in mind. However if you love giant monsters you're going to be pretty happy with this one too. The picture quality is really top notch on this one which easily makes it a better pick than any dvd offered previously. Some stowaways and a criminal run afoul of the Red Bamboo organization on an island patrolled by a giant...shrimp? Godzilla and Mothra show up and the Big G takes on the giant future scampi dish before everything blows up.

As along as I hear his voice, I KNOW that the audio is the ORIGINAL A.I.P. dubbing.  He performed for A.I.P. up until about 1971.  The video quality is absolutely superb.

6249426,4,B00I462XF2,"(Note: This review is for the DVD version of this new Kraken release, NOT the Blu-Ray)

I'm not going to comment on the quality of ""Ebirah: Horror Of The Deep"" (better known in the US as ""Godzilla vs. The Sea Monster"") too much, seeing as how others have done so more effectively than I ever could.  Suffice to say it's a fun little Bond-inspired Godzilla flick from the 60s, a time when the franchise started taking itself less seriously but hadn't yet devolved into the total camp of the seventies.  If you are a Godzilla fan and haven't seen this movie yet, you should.

The big question for those who HAVE seen this movie is this: should I buy this new DVD release from Kraken Publishing, especially if I already own the old 2004 Sony DVD?  The answer to this is: yes, and sure, if a slight upgrade is worth the money to you.  Let me explain.  This is a perfectly adequate DVD presentation of this movie.  In many ways it is the same DVD as the ten-year-old Sony disc (which was a good video and audio presentation of the movie).  Both the Sony and the new Kraken versions use the exact same International print of ""Ebirah"", meaning that the title and credits are given in English instead of Japanese.  The colors are exactly the same.  The print damage that occasionally shows up is exactly the same.  The picture on the Kraken DVD *is* slightly sharper, but that is the only visual difference.  The audio - both the English and Japanese mono tracks - are exactly the same.  Even the subtitles use the same translation (although they do look slightly different).  The only big difference between this disc and the old Sony disc is the fact that the original Japanese trailer is included as an extra... also there aren't ads for other DVDs before the main menu (so kudos for that).  Oh, and the cover art - which reproduces the original Japanese poster - is better than the old Photoshopped Sony cover.

Conclusion: If you own the old Sony disc and you feel that it's worth the money to get a slight picture upgrade along with the original trailer and better cover art, then go for it (this DVD isn't that expensive anyway).  If you don't have the old Sony disc and are wondering whether to pick this up, then again, go ahead - this is a cheap but perfectly serviceable DVD of a fun old Godzilla movie.  Get some fried shrimp takeout and this disc and make it Seafood Movie Night.",1400544000,8,2384,4.476851851851852
6249427,5,B00I462XF2,This version is the same as was released a few ears ago by Sony only in the Blu-Ray format.  If you are looking for a review of the film then look elsewhere.  I only say that because unless you like this kind of fair then you wouldn't want another from a long line of classic Godzilla films.  It does have a Japanese language track which you could see from the product description.  I really enjoy the packaging and I hope that Kraken gets a hold of some more Godzilla movies to put on Blu-Ray.,1400112000,,494,4.223404255319149
6249428,4,B00I462XF2,"The first run of Godzilla films peaked in 1965 with Monster Zero. Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster (1966) marks the point in the series in which budgetary constraints really began to show. By setting the film on a faraway tropical island, Toho was able to scale down the budget by using fewer miniatures than in previous kaiju films. The Godzilla suit from Monster Zero is re-used again here and looks worse for wear. Due to excessive water damage and taking a beating from the pyrotechnics, the suit looks pretty shabby in the scene in which Godzilla attacks the Red Bamboo's base, which was shot late in production. Jun Fukuda makes his directorial debut here and it's one of the better entries he would direct for the series. Composer Masaru Sato returns to score his first Godzilla film since Godzilla Raids Again (1955) and for the most part it's a pretty neat soundtrack, perfectly matching the tropical island setting. The only time it flops is the sequence in which Godzilla battles a squadron of jets. The accompanying music sounds like something that The Ventures would've recorded. Still, of the 3 Godzilla titles released by Kraken to dvd and blu-ray, Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster is technically the best-made film.

So how does this new DVD compare to the original Sony release? As far as the video, it's neither better nor worse than the image quality of the Sony release, which was already pretty good. As with the Sony release, the only dub included is the Toho International version. The flier design is an improvement in my opinion, being similar to Classic Media's cover designs, with the original Japanese poster and both the Japanese and American titles on the cover. The plot synopses are cool and good for a chuckle. As for extras, there is only the original Japanese trailer with subtitles. The Sony dvds didn't even have that. Menus are step up, with music from each film playing over them.",1400025600,6,1911,4.808510638297872

I think this is well worth the money. The 50th anniversary (of Godzilla) version has got nothing on this release. Just don't tell anybody I said that. As far as the movie is concerned, I always liked this movie ever since I was a wee lad. It doesn't involve one of Godzilla's greatest foes, but I think the story is pretty good and it has Mothra too. It also has Japanese with English subtitles, just like the previous release. For me, It doesn't get any better than this release unless you want a bunch of extras. Great movie at a great price.
