2610929,4,B000GGS1Y0,I also had my children watch by calling it adult manners and so it helped the whole family.,1257379200,5,91,4.111111111111111
8131949,5,B000GGS1Y0,"I was looking for such video for ages. Our son is 10 and has a diagnosis of autism. While he is performing at or a little above the grade level in an academic setting, his social skills are far worse for the age. We have been training him a lot at home. While he understands everything that we tell him, he can not visualize it and hence fails to follow it in an actual real-life setting. It was remarkably frustrating.

I came across this DVD at the library and borrowed it. He decided to watch it unprompted and viola, what we have been wreaking our heads for almost a couple of years, one hour of DVD and now he tells us if did not follow any routine suggested in the video. Wish I would have found it earlier, would have saved a ton of headache for me.

Never thanked anyone for any product but this product is a gem for our family. Definitely outdated but did a job for us.",1523577600,,878,4.158823529411765

8131953,5,B000GGS1Y0,"I use this video with my middles school students & my wife uses if with her high school students. It's good for any age group. It's very engaging, somewhat funny, and very relevant. If you use the remote to pause for discussion during segments, you can get a lot of mileage out of this DVD. The topics covered in the video have birthed a lot of interesting discussions with my students. Totally worth the investment.",1408147200,2,416,4.56
8131954,5,B000GGS1Y0,"As a school counselor, I often teach life skills classes.  I developed a course around communciation and manners for 7th -12th grade students.  I use this DVD.  The student respond well to it.  It's every well organized and easy to develop supplemental matterials around.  Glad I purchased it.",1384300800,2,293,5.020833333333333
8131955,4,B000GGS1Y0,"I got this from the library, after another teacher recommended it.  It was a great springboard for further discussion of how to act in all kinds of situations.

My 8th graders found it funny, but they did get the messages.

I thought I would actually buy a copy for the school, but it is way, way too pricey for what it is worth.",1348704000,,329,4.190476190476191
8131956,5,B000GGS1Y0,"This DVD was made by a person who has a son with Asperger's syndrome, and is created partly with that audience in mind. People on the autism spectrum require direct instruction on social rules that others pick up without really noticing. But Manners for the Real World isn't limited to people with high functioning forms of autism. Many students will benefit from this humorous refresher.",1328486400,5,388,4.984615384615385
8131957,2,B000GGS1Y0,I realize manners is always a boring subject matter but this is sad. Bought it for high school students and rather than face the groans of the classroom decided not to show it.,1298246400,,176,4.363636363636363
8131958,5,B000GGS1Y0,"I purchased this DVD to use at our private high school for an etiquette training seminar. I had 11th and 12th grade boys in my group and found that they actually paid pretty good attention. We had good reports from the girls' group and the younger boys' group as well. The DVD has good information and is presented with the right amount of humor--they aren't groaning at the jokes! The information was also presented from a point of view that was very compatible with our Christian viewpoint (not overtly religious, but set a good, respectful tone). It's divided into short sections, which would lend itself to stopping for discussion. We skipped one or two sections that were going to be covered in another session, so it's also easy to tailor to your particular needs. We were very pleased overall.",1264982400,20,800,4.762589928057554
