8150266,2,B000JGEICG,"I bought this DVD a while ago, and watched it a few times. It is what it says it is, a workout video. Not so much an instructional video.
I would recommend it to people interested in fitness, not so much if you wanted to get in the ring and fight.",1388448000,,247,3.8627450980392157
8150267,5,B000JGEICG,"I like this video very much. I have trained with Richard Bustillo on various occasions. And this is like training with him at his J.K.D. school in LA. Richard was a boxing champion and in this video he shares his training method and technique. This video teaches warm-up, exercises, punches, blocks, the Shoulder Roll, the Bob and Weave, the Slip, footwork, equipment training  ( Focus Mitts and Heavy Bag )and more. If you are interested in Boxing for fitness, exercise and fun this is a good product. If you get this dvd prepare to sweat and learn how to Box.",1348704000,,561,4.61
