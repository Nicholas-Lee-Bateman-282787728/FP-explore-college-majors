7908360,5,B00000FE0C,"It was good to see these old John Wayne westerns remastered to eliminate jerks, spots and streaks.  The colorization was well done and was a bonus.  These were B-shorts shown before a main movie; but, John Wayne shows the old movies were not that bad with some stunts that still look good today.  As was the norm back then, on screen romance is more hinted at than done.

A unified song and music have been added in to give the whole series a sort of a family resemblence.  If you like westerns, and if you like John Wayne, you will love these additions to your collection.  The same ones in 3 or 4 movies to a disc are available in B&W for comparison.

The movies have been renamed on this Young Duke disc; but the original titles are there too.  The only lack is the original dates are not given on the package.

I look forward to more of them added to my collection.

For the real western fan.",1172707200,3,896,4.2485207100591715
7908361,3,B00000FE0C,"This is another edition in The Young Duke Series that contains

3 colorized John Wayne westerns from the 1930's. The movies have been drastically edited for time and retitled (although the original titles are given in parenthesis). The colorization is great, so I don't understand why they would want to go and ruin a good thing by cutting so much out of the movies. Even if you had never seen the original B&W versions, you could still tell that something is missing from the movie. However, if you'd just like to see the ""young"" Duke in color, it might be worth the price.",1111968000,3,574,4.572815533980583
7908362,2,B00000FE0C,"This is collection of three of John Wayne's Lone Star Westerns, made in the early part of his career, a short time after he was released by Warner Brother's.  They are remastered in color.  The color is outstanding, especially when compared to the black and white prints of these three movies that are available.  There one serious draw back, however, to this DVD.  All three of these movies have had 33 minutes edited out of them.  Each is only 22 minutes long.  Because of this, each of these films has been renamed.  Rodeo Racketeers is the Man from Utah.  Claim Jumpers is the Lucky Texan.  The Shadow Gang is the Star Packer.  Also there has been a musical song track added to each of these films.  In the originals, there was no music.  One wishes the producers of the YOUNG DUKE SERIES, who attempted to refurbish these old film, would not have cut them as they did.  The music may appeal to younger audiences, but it is not how these films should or ought to be seen.  I give 5 stars for the color, but only 1 for the other changes.",1086048000,2,1040,4.37696335078534
