8524264,5,B0082RBIO0,"I HAVE HEARD ALMOST EVERY FAMOUS SONG THAT TRIBUTES TO AMERICA BUT NEVER ONE SO PROFOUND IS THIS ONE. THE VOICE AND THE WORDS TO THIS SONG ARE WRITTEN BY SOMEONE SO LOYAL AND SO IN LOVE WITH HIS COUNTRY IT IS UNBELIEVABLE. WHY THE HECK ISN'T HE ON ALL BROADCASTING VENUES AND FAMOUS. TOBY KEITH CAN'T DO IT ANY BETTER AND NEITHER CAN GEORGE STRAIT. THIS MAN IS FABULOUS. GUESS THAT'S WHY HE WON THE SILVER TELLY AWARD. I HAVE NEVER MET THE MAN AND RAN ACROSS HIM ON YOU TUBE. I BOUGHT SEVERAL OF THE CD'S TO GIVE AS A PRECIOUS GIFT TO FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES. HE IS DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM SINGING BEAUTIFULLY OF THIS WONDERFUL COUNTRY AND OUR HOME. ALL AMERICANS SHOULD OWN THIS SONG . IT IS AMERICA PURE AND SIMPLE.. HAT'S OFF TO ONE OF THE BEST SINGERS AND SONG WRITER'S I'VE EVER HEARD AND I'M OLD, HEARD ALL OF EM. CONGRATS TO MR FLUD. AMERICAN MAN. MS MARIAN BOLSTAD FROM NORTH DAKOTA.",1336867200,,888,4.260355029585799
