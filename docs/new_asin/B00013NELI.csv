8006162,5,B00013NELI,"I go this for my grandparents, I think it's the first dvd they've ever owned. I must say that the description is misleading, I expected it to have quite a few more episodes than it did, but I'm not at all displeased with the dvds. My grandparents LOVE Abbott and Costello and they were so excited to get this. And we had such a great time watching this together and laughing, and my grandpa who never watches any thing but the news and ball games says that he's watched it over and over again. Definitely worth the purchase",1284940800,,523,4.346938775510204
8006163,5,B00013NELI,"I have received the product in excellent condition and prompt, speedy delivery.  The films in Abbot and Costello took me back to the days of the 1950's when I was a child in my grandmother's house and enjoy their funny antics. I never missed a show in those days and I am glad to see them again.",1281312000,,295,4.175438596491228

8006165,5,B00013NELI,"These inexpensive Cds (2) are far better than the full 52 half hour TV series. The boys are live here and have  an audience, not that lousy canned laughter. They obviously loved playing for a live audience and it comes through. There are fluffs, mistakes, messed up props and even, occasionally, comments from the audience and it's great seeing A and C handle this. They really enjoyed themselves and this is the closest anyone will ever get to their pre Universal days. Many of the skits were unknown to me. The ""Who's On First"" skit was the longest I'v ever heard. Even the old ones seemed fresh. How nice to see Veola Vonn who was often on the boys radio show and was Mrs. Frank Nelson. Just skip over the noon A&C material, about 30% of each show. This is a must for any A & C fan, even missing the Chaney segment from the first show.",1095379200,12,838,4.337579617834395
8006166,5,B00013NELI,Not the Abbott & Costello Show but 6 Hours of the Colgate comedy hour with Abbott and Costello. I expected the worst because of the low price but was pleasantly surprised. The picture quality could be better on some episodes but overall quite good for AMC.As mentioned in other reviews there is no appearance by Lon Chaney Jr. The set does contain Many classic A&C routines that will keep you laughing...,1083369600,15,404,4.704225352112676
