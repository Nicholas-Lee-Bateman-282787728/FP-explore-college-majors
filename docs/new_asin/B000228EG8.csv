2056144,5,B000228EG8,I watched this movie back when I was a kid and thought it was funny and watching it as an adult it is still a classic comedy.,1256083200,3,125,3.6666666666666665
2056145,4,B000228EG8,"Did Richard have an obligation just to finish a film for the studio. Personally, I think Richard Pryor's talents were never fully used in film. Check him out in Harlem Nights. The man could be the embodiment of Cool. If they only knew.",1205712000,3,235,4.488372093023256
2056146,3,B000228EG8,"I feel a special love for this film since it was filmed in the old hospital where I live before they tore it down to build a new one. And my dad was one of the extras in the movie too. He played one of the psych patients in the basement! So I always get a kick out of hearing my dad's stories about playing dominos with Bob Saget and Rich (as my dad called him)Pryor on filming breaks.

This is not Pryor's best film, but this film is chock full of characters that keep you laughing all the way. Pryor is going to be missed! He was a comedic icon. 12-10-2005",1134172800,8,558,3.982142857142857
2056147,5,B000228EG8,"Pryor is excellent in this classic from the 80's.

Richard plays a guy who is a pawn in setting up a criminal, in New York.  The criminals go to prison, along with Pryor, and they swear that he'll be a dead man when he's there in prison.  So he does the only thing he can do to prevent himself from going to prison, at this point:  pretend that he's crazy.

He is admitted to a psycho ward at a hospital, and is just about to be released to go to prison, failing in convincing them that's he's crazy.  But problems occur in the ward, and the lead administrator at the hospital is held hostage.  And Pryor can't escape the hospital due to horrible flooding, brought on by a storm, so he has to stay there.  And wouldn't you know it, he has to pretend that he's a doctor now.

This movie has it's funny moments, I tell ya.  But some serious ones too, concerning the bad conditions at the hospital.",1097539200,10,895,4.211764705882353

2056149,3,B000228EG8,i feel this film was Hit&miss.more Hits but the misses are there. Richard does a good job but the material isn't fully developed for his character.like with his Love interest Rachel Ticotin.and what about  Garrett Morris? as funny as he is he should have gotten more ad-libs at  least.should have been a better film.,951609600,3,316,4.833333333333333
