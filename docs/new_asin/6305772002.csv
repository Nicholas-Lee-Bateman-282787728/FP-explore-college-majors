If you have to come up with some story line to link together a bunch of hot sex scenes, you might as well have fun with it. But unlike a lot of over-the-top softcore ""comedies"" (mostly from the John Bacchus division of Seduction Cinema) this movie never forgets what the viewer wants to see. This movie is quality sex and T&A from start to finish. There are roughly nine sex scenes. Four are boy/girl, two are girl/girl, one is girl solo, one is two girls solo, and one is boy/girl/girl. I use the word roughly, because some of the scenes are pretty short.

The women are all beautiful and super hot. This is an A list cast all the way. Maria Ford owned this movie. She was in three scenes that were as good as anything she's ever done. And when she wasn't participating in sex scenes, the producers made the excellent decision to have her running around in the skimpiest outfits available. Juli, Doria, Amber Newman, Nancy O'Brien, and Stephanee LaFleur all did great as well. Doria and Amber were in one of the lesbian scenes. Juli and Nancy were in the other one. Amber Newman also had an excellent masturbation scene.

However, I can't say I was completely blown away by it. As I said above, some of the sex scenes are short. Too short for me. And although there was plenty of skin on display between the sex scenes, skin alone does not make a great softcore movie.

I still recommend it though.",1103241600,5,1482,4.4212454212454215
