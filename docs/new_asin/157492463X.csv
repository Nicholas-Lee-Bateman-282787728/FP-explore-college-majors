195168,5,157492463X,"I was absolutely stunned the first time I saw this one. DON'T pass up your chance to see this one (or better yet own it) before it fades from the market. Better yet, share it with anyone who believes those mysths about homelessness and poverty in American - that the poor are simply lazy, shiftless, unwilling to work hard and make a go of it. If anything is likely to change their minds, this movie could.  Beau Bridges shines as Bill Januson, a young widower and father who is struggling to make ends meet while caring for his two children. Bridges shows the depth of pain and confusion felt by a man who has never been poor before, who has never been unemployed before and, as a result, is too proud to accept charity, even if he fully deserves a hand up. His 11 year old son decides to take on the role of bread-winner, coming up with an ambitious scheme to raise money, a courageous decision that nearly results in complete tragedy.  But this is a mere bare-bones sketch of a rich, detailed movie. The pace is slow enough to show all the decisions faced by this family every day - the times when a simple meal, clean clothes and a safe, comfortable place to live can't be taken for granted. The pain, despair and self-reliance required to get through each day is portrayed without sentimentality or manipulative drama and the young actor and actress playing the children in this one are superb and keep the movie solidly grounded. A rare heart-tugging film that makes you think about deeper issues in our society and culture.",996019200,15,1530,4.5398550724637685
195169,4,157492463X,"This movie was amazing. It really makes you think. Anything can happen, one day you are living comfortably, eating where and what you want. And then the next day, you are wondering where your next meal is coming from and if you will lose your home. This movie can also teach children that everything they receive should be respected as well as the person(s) that make it possible to have it. For parents, this movie can help us to not teach our children that material things is the be all and end all of life. It also goes to the heart of how people think of the homeless and unfortunate. Not everyone that receives public assistance, food stamps, or some kind of government aide is lazy and won't work. Although this movie is a few years old, the reality is very significant for today. I am very thankful for everything I have and hope to not take my advantages for granted.",1269216000,2,875,4.440993788819876
195170,5,157492463X,"The night that I received my DVD I sat down and watched it and to be honest with you I could not leave the couch I was so entranced by the story this DVD is about. It is so very, very true in regards to people that live in The United States.

It is very, very hard for some people to ask for help. I know that because I myself and my family have been there. To be told to put our pride aside is something we just cannot do. Yes, I like the man in this DVD eventually had to accept help from an outsider for the sake of our children. Children should and must ALWAYS, ALWAYS come first no matter what. If you children are in jeopardy of being hurt because of something that happened that is not in your control then you must stand up and put your pride and feelings aside for the sake of the children. That is exactly what the man in this DVD does even though it took him a long time to do so and affected many people.

The United States of America, although generally a great Country to live in sometimes turns a blind eye to their own citizens and this DVD reflects exactly that. I personally have always felt how unfair that is. After all, we have paid our taxes to this Country for many, many years and often times when it comes to people needing the Countries help they are refused are made to feel as though they are low life scum because of their need for assistance however it is alright that we give billions and billions of dollars in aid to help other Countries. Something definitely needs to be done about this.

This story portrays a man that was just to hard to reach out and when he finally did he was treated like he was nothing more then just another number, another beggar and that is not the way this Country should act. We definitely need to take care of our own before we begin taking care of people from other Countries.

I definitely think that every body should watch this movie.",1249344000,5,1901,4.185792349726776
195171,5,157492463X,"Beau Bridges is heartbreaking as a single dad who has never experienced poverty and now must struggle as a newly widowed dad with two pre-teen children.  Bruce Davison is so sensitive as the rich doctor, and the film shows that society, not individuals caught in different social classes, is to blame for our children who go hungry.  The scene at the Food Stamps office is very realistic and although the movie was made in 1996, it is still accurate in 2009.  It does make you appreciate what you have and the son in this movie makes us wake up to the hopelessness of poverty.  But it is not a downer - just a great film with lovely moments and totally realistic.  Bravo to the Bridges brothers!",1242777600,2,695,4.484126984126984
195172,5,157492463X,"This is the type of movie that will make you appreciate what you have in life. Beau Bridges gives a remarkable performance as a man who loses his job and wife at the same time and has to fend for himself and two small children, one of whom has a bad medical condition, and he severely struggles throughout the movie to make ends meet, and his pride prevents him from accepting handouts from a well-meaning doctor. Before you start to think that your life is too tough, watch this well-made movie.

195175,4,157492463X,"Too many people take starvation in this country far too lightly.  This movie brings to life the very certainty that kids do without the common necessities here in the USA.

  This movie shows how one doctor, raised and living in the upper class of wealth, gets over his feelings regarding a man who struggles with a restaraunt job just to make ends meet for his two children.  This is a very good movie about friendship beyond the bonds of class.",1149724800,6,446,4.525
195176,5,157492463X,This film shows some of the true problems that face people who fall on hard times.  The mother in the family dies leaving extensive medical bills which plunge the family into poverty.  The father is too proud to ask anyone for help including a doctor who is the father of his daughter's friend.  This movie is fraught with drama and emotion.  It tore my heart out when I watched it.  It shows that not everyone who is poor becomes that way because they are lazy.,1081209600,2,462,4.3882352941176475
195177,2,157492463X,"this is an ok film,i suppose.not a classic,but merits a watching.it involves a middle class family,the wife of which dies,leaving the father to provide and raise his children alone.it charts the problems he faces rather simplistically though,and doesnt really get into the deeper problems and psychology involved.also,the characters themselves are too one dimensional and stereotypical.why would the guy refuse help from the doctor?yeah ok he might be proud,but he would know in his heart of heart it was for the best.also,the ending is very poor.halfway between standard hollywood happily ever after,and the rather depressing,it finishes abruptly and questions are left unanswered.all that said,at least some thought was given to this film.sans for the few gaping plot holes,this is an acceptable film. 2 out of 5",1078876800,,814,5.52
195178,5,157492463X,"I've used this film with high school juniors for five years, and it has been a great success every time.  In fact, as much as I appreciate this film, my students love it even more, and refer back to it continually.  The film is a powerful tool for teaching students about the reality of poverty and hunger in America - the reality that most who are poor in this country work full time.  (I only wish it could be issued in DVD format.)",1019779200,8,434,4.204819277108434
7798627,3,157492463X,"very very dissapointed with this film number one, when it comes to feeding your kids, there is no room for pride ! that's what food stamps are for, How can you as a parent say to your child , oh you can,t have another can of chef boyardee for a buck, or tomorrow there will be nothing to eat! when you have envelopes of cash down in that china cabinet !! A lousy 20 dollars would buy rice ,beans, and oatmeal that would healthfully feed them for 2 WEEKS . It borders on child abuse to starve your kids, they eat FIRST , if nothing is left over then i don`t eat!!  There is just NO EXCUSE to justify not providing good cheap food to your kids . IF you want to learn the healthiest most satisfying and CHEAPEST way to eat . check out the video on you tube by Dr John Mcdougall called THE STARCH SOLUTION ! Now that being said, I would just like to add that I really found the dialog of this film in my opinion , was awful and at best,predictable,BUT, the performance by Bruce Davison (the doctor) was excellent ,should have gotten best supporting actor, 5 STARS !",1525651200,,1061,4.175609756097561
7798628,5,157492463X,"Terrific  movie, as so many other reviewers have said. I want to say something about the two lead children. They touch the heart as does the entire movie. Excellent acting from Shelton Dane and Jena Malone. I am often amazed at the depth of acting young children are capable of achieving. The emotion can really tug at the heart. This movie does just that and more. I used a tissue or two before it was all over. Please watch this movie.",1485907200,,437,4.395061728395062

7798632,5,157492463X,"One of my favorite movies with Beau Bridges. The other favorite movie is called ""The Other Side of the Mountain"" with Beau Bridges. This movie really is good for people or children to realize how good they have it and count their blessings!

Pros: Jeff Bridges plays a Doctor. Another Doctor (don't recall his name), who played in the movie ""Willard"" he does a great job; being sympathetic and kind to Beau's character. A good movie for single parents that can relate to making it alone with their kids.

Cons: Beau Bridges plays a Prideful man. He doesn't discipline his son for saying something to him that was very disrespectful.",1406678400,,632,4.736363636363636
7798633,5,157492463X,"This came on my radar from watching the excellent documentary ""A Place At The Table"".  This is not an easy film to watch but it goes through a difficult time in a family's life trying to get enough food.  This title may be harder to find but hopefully it will have an effect of moving more to compassion and action for those who need help.",1385078400,4,339,4.2
7798634,4,157492463X,"If you earn $50,000.00 a year, you pay $36.82 in taxes toward food stamps annually.  But if you earn nothing, as the widower father of two played by Beau Bridges does in the 1996 television film HIDDEN IN AMERICA, you apply for food stamps.

Welfare?  That's $6.36 of your tax dollars every year.

Subsidies for Big Oil and other corporate welfare?  $870.00.

Yet Bill Januson, portrayed by Bridges in HIDDEN IN AMERICA, beats himself up for being unable to find work that does not even pay nearly as well as the auto plant job he lost.  With the resulting bare cupboard of his home making his daughter sick from malnutrition, Januson sees he is now the kind of man he once viewed as taking handouts so he didn't have to work.  I don't want to blow the story but will say HIDDEN IN AMERICA keeps it real when Januson's son tries to take the bull by the horns, cutting school to scrounge some work at a car repair shop where he learns hard work does not necessarily pay off.

And this was the Clinton `90s, when America supposedly was enjoying renewed prosperity.  Well, Big Oil was, especially with its handouts from taxpayers.  As for regular people, when Bill Clinton left the presidency in 2001 minimum wage earners were making 90 cents per hour more than they were when he took office eight years earlier.

Beau Bridges is in top form in HIDDEN IN AMERICA among a fine cast including Bruce Davison, who steals every scene in his role as Michael Millerton, a successful physician Januson meets because their daughters are friends.  Januson's the one humbled by the reality of the eroding middle class and a government policy of inadequate response.  But while Millerton does not look down at Januson's situation, it's so foreign to him his embarrassment shows.  Had HIDDEN IN AMERICA been built around Millerton's point of view as the well-off doctor to whom a poor family like the Janusons might have remained invisible if not for their children's friendship, I think it would be that much more memorable.

Nonetheless, I won't forget HIDDEN IN AMERICA because what it does well is more than enough despite what it could do better.",1383955200,,2135,4.698924731182796
7798635,5,157492463X,I saw this movie years ago on TV.  It was very moving.  It so clearly shows how the average middle class American can quickly go from secure to homeless.  If nothing else it gives one more compassion for what many are going through today.,1364428800,,238,4.363636363636363
7798636,4,157492463X,"A moving drama about the under-explored tragedy of hunger among those out of work, or under-
employed in modern America - especially how it effects the children of those families.

However, unlike Bell's great earlier films ""American Heart"", which explored an ex-con trying
to re-integrate into society, or his documentary `Streetwise' which unblinkingly studied runaway
teens in Seattle, this film feels a bit soft, and just a a touch preachy.

Of course, this was a TV movie, not a feature, and that could explain the slight lack of edge.  It's
still bravely dark compared to most American films, but there's never a question of the film's
agenda here.  Of course that's partly due to the difference in subject, but it effects everything;
the lighting, the music, even the supporting cast (producer Jeff Bridges appears as a rich doctor,
and while he's one of the best American actors of our time, there's something distracting about
seeing him in a cameo in a film starring his brother, where the two men are treated as unrelated
and never even meet on screen).

Beau Bridges does his usual very solid job as the father, likable and human if headstrong and
too prideful to get the help his family needs.  And generally the acting is all quite good.  I just
felt a little manipulated - to a good cause and a good end mind you - something I never felt in
Bell's previous work.  In the end, though, the importance of the story, and the strength of the
performances win out, and this is still very much a film worth seeing.",1331683200,,1522,4.695488721804511
