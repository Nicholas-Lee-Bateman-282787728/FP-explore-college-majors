8442032,4,B004UQLVTY,"I love movies about the movies, and this one is a standout.
well the movie starts with a maverick man who has left his good printing business and is working as magician doing street shows....he happens to see a ""motion picture""..well normally you won't give a damn about this word...but this movie will surely tell u what it really represents......after watching this cinema..he decides to do his own motion picture or ""a drama on screen"" as people first used to call motion pictures....

movie then goes through his efforts to make his dream real...the best thing about movie is not actually the story but the way it is presented on the screen.... there are few scenes which are truly remarkable ..specially where Phalke sells his cupboard to buy books and people started making a big deal out of it..as if someone has died... part where phalke is looking for women actors to portray Taramati and mustache saga....

Nandu Madhav has played character extremely well but one thing i couldn't stop noticing about his acting was..it kind of looked like Chalie Chaplin...i dnt know if its true...but u have to c it yourself.... another beautiful aspect of movie was how relation between phalke and his wife is handled...its shear pleasure watching the couple together....Vibhavari Deshpande who enacted Saraswati Phalke has done well job too....

Director Paresh Mokashi has done beautiful job in writing as well as directing... portraying a life a man in 97 min is really a tough job.... so in all a nice movie... and a nice tribute to the originator of Indian Cinema which currenlty is biggest film industry in the world....",1304467200,2,1622,4.912408759124087
