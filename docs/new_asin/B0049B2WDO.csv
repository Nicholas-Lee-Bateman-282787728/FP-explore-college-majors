8418931,5,B0049B2WDO,"This movie is a documentary about the overthrow of the King of Nepal. I found this movie to be extremely instructive concerning the Nepalese culture, history and these political events. The actual footage of the street uprising are amazing and the interviews are insightful . I recommend this movie to any one who is interested in Nepal , would like to understand the nature of popular uprisings or has a curiosity about  Nepal and its people.
I loved the video of rural Nepal and the story development surround the uprising. We always look at the world through the filters of our experience , in listening to the interviews with Nepalese women and their struggles for liberation , it brought home to me the great strides we have made here in America (we can still do more) .
All social revolution are chaotic and the video of running street battles and police response bring these events right into the viewers home.  After watching the movie I felt I better understood Nepal and the reasons for the overthrow of the king.",1295222400,3,1023,4.709497206703911
