2005627,2,B0001I55AG,This was not what I thought it was going to be. The person in the video would have been better if she was not speaking with a british accent. The quality of the dvd was great however as far as the picture was concerned.,1284768000,,219,4.0
2005628,1,B0001I55AG,"This video is horrible. Its the worst I've ever seen in the field of reading faces. Its a poor attempt at trying to make some science out of the way a person's facial features are set. It is not about reading facial movements. And as a science, the idea that you are a certain kind of person because of the placement of any facial feature is pure nonsense. Secrets of Body Language from the History channel is a much better representation of how to read people. In fact watching a couple episodes of ""Lie to Me"" would give you more insight to reading a person by their facial expressions than this horrible DVD. If I could rate this DVD with a negative number of stars I would give it a negative 50.",1275264000,6,699,4.303030303030303
2005629,1,B0001I55AG,"Sevwn reviewers have written before me, and I fully agree with them: this DVD does NOT teach you how to interpret facial expressions. It just follows the now discarded notion that you can guess people's personality from their physical face attributes.
What a waste of time and money!!",1274572800,3,284,4.9375
2005630,1,B0001I55AG,This is not about how to read facial expressions but how a person will act or feel based on genetic characters.,1273622400,,111,4.333333333333333
2005631,1,B0001I55AG,If I could have given less than 1 star I would have done so. This is a terrible video and not at all worth the cost. I recommend the professionally produced Body language video from the History Channel. That was much better than this garbage.,1262476800,6,242,4.4
2005632,1,B0001I55AG,"For the gentlemen looking for interview and interrogation, try Wicklander associates or look into Paul Eckman resources. I've only formally studied the subject matter for 15 years, but it took less than 15 minutes to figure this was a fraud.

I'm sorry to say I will not put in enough time to determine the root cause of the bunk, or for her benefit, poppycock and balderdash.

Tying experience with a facial attribute is impossible. This is neither scientific nor valuable in any way.

It's possible she's stupid enough to believe this. It's possible that it's just a send me money DVD. It's possible she's mentally infirm, as that is the way she appears at times.

Whatever the case, after watching this I only feel like I know less than I did before. Watching this will only destroy valuable brain cells that you may need later. I've only met one person I couldn't read in the last 5 years. Now, I'm afraid I won't be able to read any.",1257638400,8,938,4.565476190476191
2005633,1,B0001I55AG,"This has nothing to do with reading facial expressions. I bought it for a class I teach on interpersonal skills thinking it would be about how to read facial expressions. Its not: The woman says things like: If a person has a wide forehead their personality is like xyz. If a person has a wide chin they act like this. I am amazed that amazon even sells stuff like this- This video has NOTHING to do with body language/ facial expressions. The statements are no more scientific than saying that if a person has brown hair they are smart, if they have blonde hair they like ice cream.....",1254355200,45,587,4.444444444444445
2005634,1,B0001I55AG,The product name and subsequent narrative on this product leads one to believe that you will learn how to read facial expressions of those you deal with versus a book about genetic facial structure having little to do with understanding those that you're dealing with.,1252281600,4,268,4.977777777777778
2005635,1,B0001I55AG,"My interest is for interviewing and interrogating crime related persons.  I know reading body language is a good tool, but this DVD is not about body language.  I place it in a category with stereotyping people based on physical atributes, something the courts frown on.  It did not provide anything useful.",1198713600,41,307,4.980392156862745
2005636,1,B0001I55AG,when amazon recomended this book to be coupled with a body language book i imagined the two items to compliment each other.  In actuallity this dvd is not about reading the emotions or reactions based on facial expressions.,1188518400,35,223,4.868421052631579
2005637,4,B0001I55AG,"Why so many negative reviews??  Lighten up!  It's not meant to be serious and scientific, but rather interesting entertaining.  With the prolific amount of violence and gore that seem to be the mainstays of today's entertainment I found this to be refreshingly pleasant and positive.  How can anyone dislike Ms. McCormick's sweet, soft-spoken demeanor??  I'd love to see MORE videos by her!",1506124800,2,390,5.225806451612903

2005639,5,B0001I55AG,"This stuff is real. The teacher is a lot of fun too. Fun to watch on a date. But this is not about reading someone's expressions, this is about how the shape of someone's face is a window into their soul.",1498003200,2,204,4.0
2005640,1,B0001I55AG,"I was just forced to watch this video in a meeting that I thought was serious. At first, I thought the video was a joke and it would stop at any moment.  It was pure torture!!  ""Joy"" the actor actually said that she healed someone from having hanging eyelids just by knowing how to help his personality by looking at his eyes . This is bare bones prejudice based on people's looks alone. This is a dead science. The only good thing about it is we laughed all afternoon at the absurdity of it.",1440547200,,492,4.223404255319149

2005643,1,B0001I55AG,"I have never ever wasted my money on a porduct as bad as this dvd.

Its a bunch of bull from the beginning to the end... no scientific facts or arguments just a 50 year old lady telling stories like.. if your upper lip is fat then you like to share you're feelings,  while if you have a slim upper lip... than you like to be left alone! and this kind of bull will go on for 50 minutes.

It is far worse than my English writting. Thats how bad it is!!",1326758400,8,450,3.869565217391304
2005644,1,B0001I55AG,"I'm like to think I'm open minded, but this ""...if his nose points up at the end this he's a mean person..."" junk is total BS.  I thought this was going to be about interpreting facial expressions, but instead it was about how people with sloping foreheads like to go fast and if you have a high belly button you prefer to sit more than others.

Whut?!

Don't waste your time with this ignorant voodoo.",1306108800,4,402,4.333333333333333

2005646,5,B0001I55AG,"I haven't bought this so I can't review it but I must say I'm a little surprised that so many people are complaining that this product doesn't teach you to read facial expressions. Some even say the product was misleading.

Here is the product description:

""If you deal with people you need to watch this program. Imagine the advantages of knowing how another person will think, behave and respond just by looking at their face and the way it's structured. This video gives you that advantage!

Face reading has been around for hundreds of years. It has now been refined into a miraculously simple science that can be learned by anyone. The Face Reading skills you will learn have been proven to be 98% accurate!

Face Reading will improve your communication with every person in your life, enabling you to understand their behavior without taking that behavior personally. In your professional life, your personal life, in every relationship you have, this information gives you the ultimate communication advantage. ""

Can anyone point out where it says you will learn to read expressions? In fact, they specifically say you will learn how people will respond based on the way a person's face is STRUCTURED. Expression is not structure.

Regardless of whether you believe face reading is real or accurate, I don't believe this product was labeled as misleading.",1291852800,8,1364,4.986784140969163
8013187,1,B0001I55AG,I can't tell if the video is supposed to be a parody or a prolonged hallucination.  It is quite entertaining in the realm of comedy.,1523923200,,132,4.28

8013189,1,B0001I55AG,"The most unlikeable aspect was that the presenter maintained a bizarre forward tilt of her forehead down toward the camera THE ENTIRE TIME. The content of her claims notwithstanding, the video was painful to watch because of her creepy head tilt and facial expressions. It pained my neck to watch her never change the jutting position of hers!",1519689600,,343,4.931034482758621

8013193,1,B0001I55AG,"I'd like to say she's right on, because apparently all my characteristics signify a 'high brow' mind, according to Sammy here. Sadly, all specific traits she attaches to my looks don't apply to me at all. But that's really the thing about these kinds of observations. It can easily become a measurement of a better or worse person. Then that idea becomes firmly cemented in a culture. These are dangerous ideas. They start out fun and interesting and even sometimes based in fact. But then it will inevitably become something darker. I don't deny there are methods to better reading a person's character and intent. But Sammy's just spouting some serious non-wisdom over here.",1511395200,,676,4.93859649122807
