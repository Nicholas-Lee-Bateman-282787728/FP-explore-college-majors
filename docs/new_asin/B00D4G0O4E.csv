5774569,3,B00D4G0O4E,"Picture looks great but be prepared to read subtitles if you want to watch the uncut version. The English audio version is cut by about 15 minutes and there are some important scenes missing. Still a great movie worth adding to your collection, just disappointing that they dropped the ball on the audio for the uncut version.",1386979200,5,326,4.7368421052631575
5774570,5,B00D4G0O4E,"This is possibly my favorite western of all time and I have gone through several versions over the years that were usually bootlegs due to it not even being available on DVD in the US. This version trumps all though, unless you're someone who prefers the Franco Cleef version that mixes the English and Italian dub for the uncut version. If you're one of those people, the German blu ray release will suit you fine. For me though, I sometimes liked to just watch the US cut of the film without all the Italian parts and sometimes I liked to see the full uncut version in Italian, so the fact that this set gives you both version over two blu ray discs is truly the best way to appreciate the film. Oh, and the film itself has never looked better and is truly stunning in HD. The sound offered is only the original mono, which is great, as I love to see the original sound preserved, but it would have been nice if they could have tried to create a 5.1 mix for this release. Still though, I can't complain.

The extras included are also fantastic. There's multiple interviews with Sergio Sollima, Thomas Milian, and Sergio Donati, which are all quite interesting for the fans of this film and the Italian western genre. Then there's a commentary track by two people I'm not familiar with, but seem to have a lot of knowledge on the film and the genre. They mainly talk about things that were cut from the American release, but also go into some other interesting aspects of the film. Then there's just the standard promotional materials as well.

Oh, and before I forget, this also includes a soundtrack CD which seems to be the most complete version of the soundtrack I've found to date. Truly one of Ennio Morricone's best scores, if not his best. It's certainly my favorite, and any fan of his would be glad to pick up this set for that CD alone.

I don't usually write up reviews, but I felt like should let people know not only about this fantastic release, but about this fantastic film that not only stands the test of time, but can easily be held up to the best of Sergio Leone and other western classics.",1386806400,34,2112,4.438144329896907
5774571,5,B00D4G0O4E,"Excited to finally see a hi def release of this most significant film in the long career of Lee Van Cleef. A cut down version of THE BIG GUNDOWN with faded color shown in pan & scan on the Encore Western channel cannot do justice to director Sergio Sollimas classic Western. Lee Van Cleef turns in probably his best performance as an egotistical lawman with political ambitions who engages in a brutal hunt for the Mexican peon Cuchillo (Little Knife. his weapon of choice.) Tomas Milian gives a very energetic performance here as Cuchillo. As a frustrated Van Cleef fails to capture his prey he begins to doubt his abilities, a dangerous development for him as he must soon face an eccentric Prussian gunslick (The Baron)who is determined to murder Cuchillo and is every bit as capable and deadly as Van Cleef himself.
  Also, in a too small role, is actress Maria Granada as Cuchillos wife and part time prostitute. Surely one of the most beautiful creatures to ever walk the face of this earth.
  Apparently this set has a (two?) CD soundtrack of the movie score, one of Morricones best, which makes the asking price more than reasonable. Hopefully there are other extras as well. Perhaps some other reviewers can reveal them if they are more knowledgeable about the product.
  If you are a collector who can appreciate great films don't even think twice about purchasing this product. Just do it!",1381622400,27,1400,4.764462809917355

5774575,5,B00D4G0O4E,"While I've been wanting this video for a very long time, what I wanted even more was the soundtrack on CD to replace my old vinyl LP. For over half a century Ennio Morricone has been composing some of the most creative music imaginable by the mind of man becoming in the process a veritable genre unto himself. Not just a tough act to follow but a tougher act to beat. Indeed, about the only person capable of topping Morricone at this stage in the game is Morricone himself and even he can find that challenging. Case in point, THE BIG GUNDOWN, his best score since THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY. Original, hypnotic, jaw droppingly beautiful, it may not push the envelope as far as THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY did, but it certainly puts a first class stamp on it.

5774595,5,B00D4G0O4E,This film completely lives up to the hype. Can be watched right alongside The Good the Bad and the Ugly or Once Upon a Time in the West.,1403654400,,136,3.892857142857143
5774596,5,B00D4G0O4E,"THE BIG GUNDOWN was one of my favorite post-Eastwood/Leone Italian Westerns.  Apparently it may have been released on VHS Tape at one point but I was unaware of it.  Though I saw it several times in theaters on its first US run, I've only seen it a few times since on cable.  Why it took so long to be restored and released in digital form is beyond me, but I was so very happy when, for a lark, I checked on Amazon one day and discovered it had finally been created.  And what a fine work this is!  Thanks to Grindhouse Releasing, this production is the clearest, cleanest version of the movie I've seen, with the benefit of added scenes.

Lee Van Cleef is at his best in this role of Jonathan Corbett.  As a performer in this genre no one was better than him, for his ""look"" on the screen transcended any acting ability he had.  The excellent acting prowess of Cuban actor Tomas Milian as Cuchillo Sanchez helps round out this story of a poor peasant who is a master with a knife, being accused of a heinous crime he didn't commit.  Van Cleef passed away at the early age of 62 but was featured as a star in many of the Italian westerns produced after his role in ""For A Few Dollars More"" and ""The Good, The Bad & The Ugly, but none of the later features had the quality, cinematography or stunning music as did ""The Big Gundown"".

Also included is an extensive booklet with notes on the production, still photos from the movie and advertising poster images, a BluRay of the Italian 110 Minute Director's Cut, a DVD of the US version and a CD of the Motion Picture Soundtrack.  I have owned the soundtrack on vinyl since the '60s and I find this to be some of Ennio Morricone's best work, which is saying quite a bit since Morricone is my favorite composer.  The haunting opening theme, ""Run Man Run"" (vocalized in English by ""Christy"") is my favorite piece by this composer.  This is truly a masterpiece collection, economically priced for all that it contains, that shouldn't be missed.",1401926400,3,1990,4.419178082191781

Grand Duel was good no more than that and Kid Vengeance was absolutely dire so i was kind of unsure about this one but I'm glad i took a chance. He gives a tremendous performance matched all the way by Tomas Milian. This has a great story is superbly directed and has fantastic cinematography that looks stunning on blu-ray the depth of vision is breathtaking.throw in an exciting score by Morricone and some great extras and really this is a must buy. There is an interview with director Sergio Sollima where he describes trying to shoot a scene with Lee and a horse that had me in stitches of laughter. 5 star release all the way from content to packaging.a must have for fans of Lee Van Cleef and Tomas Milian.,1393891200,4,908,4.410714285714286

5774604,5,B00D4G0O4E,I hope Grindhouse revises more classic movies! The modern technology really adds to an already fantastic quality that is not captured in the newer movies -my opinion of course.,1392768000,,176,5.103448275862069
5774605,4,B00D4G0O4E,A spaghetti western with a twist. The excellent soundtrack by Ennio Morricone. Lee Van Cleef and Tomas Millian at its best. One of the best movies from director Sergio Sollima. This Grindhouse releasing is great and the movie deserves it.,1392163200,,238,4.975
5774606,5,B00D4G0O4E,"For fans of either Lee Van Cleef or Spaghetti Westerns the wait is finally over and well worth it.  The Big Gundown gets a better-then Criterion-like treatment from Gindhouse.  The sound color and quality of The Big Gundown is nothing short of spectacular.  From a fine print or negative that is absolutely speckle free with deep rich color, and a crisp, perfectly defined picture and excellent sound.

Van Cleef is an x-sheriff/saloon owner turned bounty hunter named Jonathan Corbit. Corbit takes on the task of hunting down a Mexican near-do-well named Cuchillo played by Tomas Milian. Cuchillo may be a child murderer. Corbit's reward will be a senator-ship promised by a railroad tycoon named Braxton played by Walter Barnes.

The film boast a sometimes beautiful, sometimes crazy and always imaginative film score by Ennio Morricone, excellent wide screen photography, rich atmosphere, authentic looking old western and Mexican towns, huge scenic landscapes and lots of horse back riding and shootouts.  Very good performances by Van Cleef and Walter Barnes. A very energetic if a bit over-the-top performance by Tomas Milian - something about his monkey walk and mouth hanging open for almost the entire film is a bit distracting.

The only thing unfortunate about the movies on this beautiful DVD is the choice of an extended Italian version with an exquisitely filmed shoot-out in the opening scene that has all but been excised in the American version - for no good reason. A short scene where Corbit collects the reward money for the outlaws he ""chose"" to kill is also missing.

The missing opening shoot-out and Corbit's collecting the bounty are pivotal to the rest of the film. These scenes set the mood and show Corbits character - a person of ""convenient-fair-play"", confident, talented, calculating, and a deadly mercenary.  The way the shoot-out takes place foreshadows numerous ""gun downs"" and the decisions Corbit makes throughout the rest of the film and is the jump-off point as Corbit begins a transition from cold blooded opportunist to a somewhat more enlightened human being.

The Italian version, although having these important scenes intact, has the disadvantage of a questionably dubbed Italian language soundtrack.  The music is the same and wonderful but we don't get to hear Van Cleef's, and Barne's distinct voices and an appropriate English dub for Tomas Millian that are far more fitting to their characters and matches their lip movements. Instead we get disembodied overly macho Italian language voices that changes the personalities of the characters.

There were numerous other missing scenes from the American version such as Mormon prayers and a ""day of the dead"" parade in Mexico. These scenes, though not pivotal to the plot add a great deal of atmosphere and commentary to the picture. The two religious scenes also added a bookend effect to the film.

The choice of the versions of the film is absolutely not the fault of Grindhouse which did a wonderful job with these DVDs but instead is the way the films were originally produced for Europe and the US. Even with the shootout and a few other scenes missing I still prefer the English language version of the film for nothing else but to hear Van Cleef's natural cool gravely voice. And unless Rich Little dubs in the missing English language scenes - these two versions are the best cuts of the film that we will every have.

On a couple of side notes - I have never read anything on a couple of interesting aspects in the story. There is an almost surreal and rather long vignette in the middle of the film where Thomas Milian is tortured by some ""animals"" at a ranch owned by a sadistic woman rancher. The entire vignette is strange and yet oddly familiar. I realized that this vignette closely resembles a portion of Homer's Odyssey. In The Odyssey ship-men are turned into pigs either by eating food served by the goddess Circe or by bedding down with her. In the Big Gundown the ranch-owner invites ranch-hands into her house, feeds and beds them. The ranch-hands certainly behave like pigs and Cuchillo and the ranch-hands discuss killing Corbit from a pig sty amidst pigs and Cuchillo later refers to the ranch-men as pigs. It is lucky for Corbit that he never had the chance to drink the ranch-woman's tea. In Homer's Odyssey one of the ship-men warns Odysseus about Circe. Cuchillo warns Corbit. Begs the question - is Corbit's character and journey to disillusionment and then enlightenment based loosely on the Odyssey?

Secondly - The opening scene.  The film opens with Corbit and three outlaws standing on a Colorado mountain side having a discussion about a robbery.  Corbit points to a body once belonging to an outlaw named Meulich swinging by the neck from a tree. There is no mention as to why Muelich would have been hung and it would not be in Corbit's interest or character to hang anyone. On top of that the Muelich is swinging rather high in the tree. It's hard to imagine that Muelich climbed up there and jumped on his own. Maybe he was hung from the back of a giraffe? This is not a put-down of the film but rather just one of many off kilter aspects of this great wild western.",1391904000,4,5204,4.868778280542986

5774610,5,B00D4G0O4E,"Finally Director Sergio Sollima's elusive political western 'THE BIG GUNDOWN' aka 'LA RESA DEI CONTI'- 1966 has come to the Blu-Ray format and in its original 110 minute cut showing how Columbia Pictures was just interested in the shoot-em-up value at the time rather than a complete story.  You've read about this magnificent film in the reviews contained within but I just had to put in my two cents (once again) because not only has it been over twenty years since I saw the wide screen American cut  on Turner Classic Movies but now the full story can really be appreciated by the reinstated scenes deleted from the American version.  Lee Van Cleef's portrayal of Corbett is fully realized as a man only resorting to the way of the gun when he has to kill.  Running for political office as Senator, he's boxed into a corner by going after an innocent man to further the careers of others including his own.  The film becomes Corbett's odyssey by putting him through memorable set pieces making him realize his purpose in life and also the way of life of Cuchillo played brilliantly by Tomas Milian, one of Europe's greatest actors. The theme of pedophilia is ironically used when Corbett finds out that Cuchillo has accompanied a thirteen year old girl for a swim at a river in a Morman camp. After he gets shot for his troubles, the priest asks Corbett why he bothered.  When told that he wanted to save his daughter from the clutches of the rapist, the priest shrugs and says,'Sarah is not my daughter, she's my fourth wife' leaving Corbett stunned into realization. This is what makes this film stand out from other Spaghetti's at that time.  Only the works of Sergio Corbucci  would come close to the visions of Sollima and Sergio Leone in this respect.  It is also impossible to imagine the film having the impact that it does without the brilliant music score by the master Ennio Morricone who fills every frame with a memorable theme including Beethoven's 'FUR ELISE' during the climactic shootout between Corbett and the Baron. It is preserved in a bonus CD included in the package to allow you to feel its magnificence on its own.  The flawless cinematography by Carlo Carlini seals the package especially in 1080p 2.35 wide screen. Unfortunately, some may be disappointed in the full version because it is in Italian with English Subtitles and you do not hear the voice of Van Cleef. The film is peppered with great actors : You'll see the most memorable role of Lee Van Cleef's career utilizing his famous eye glare to the hilt;  Tomas Milian would go on to other memorable characters in his career including Nico Giraldi and the psychotic villain Giulio Sacchi in Director Umberto Lenzi's scathing 'ALMOST HUMAN' aka ' MILANO ODIA; LA POLIZIA NON PUO SPARARE'- 1974 . Milian would play Cuchillo again in Sollima's inferior sequel 'RUN,MAN,RUN ' aka 'CORRI, UOMO ,CORRI'- 1967 and also star in Sollima's best Western 'FACE TO FACE' aka 'FACCIA A FACCIA' -1967 which as yet has not seen a digital release.  Gerard Herter plays the sadistic reptilian German Baron with just the right touch of evil and the gorgeous Nieves Navarro aka Susan Scott as the black widow leaves a memorable trace of perfume long after the film fades to black.  Navarro would grace many memorable Giallo thrillers for her husband Luciano Ercoli in the Seventies.  You will also spot Fernando Sancho, Nello Pazzafini, Antonio Casas, to name but a few memorable faces.

5774614,5,B00D4G0O4E,"I have been waiting for this to get a proper American release. I've had a burned copy of the extended version (English with Italian deleted scenes) on DVD-R that has been suitable given the circumstances, but no more.

Now Grindhouse has given it the due it had coming to this classic. As a Spaghetti Western fan, this is a must own and one of the best non-Sergio Leone or Sergio Corbucci Euro westerns. The package is well worth the price: 2 Blu-rays, a DVD copy and the soundtrack on CD.

My only complaint, though slight, is that the remastering wasn't 100% complete. The scene where Cuchillo escapes Corbett the first time -from the barber- has some camera cuts that are not remastered, but given that it all passes relatively quickly (and no one else has tackled this project) it can easily slide.

Get this now!",1389830400,2,817,4.620689655172414
5774615,4,B00D4G0O4E,This B/R set is what they say it is. Great picture quality and sound and if not the best spaghetti western ever made. If you like this type of western I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND it,1389830400,2,178,4.114285714285714
5774616,4,B00D4G0O4E,"If you ask me, the watchable spaghetti westerns can be counted by the fingers and toes of one person. Sollima's ""The Big Gundown"" definitely is one of these. It's a real pleasure to notice there is a production company that has taken such an ambitious attitude to publish as gorgeous a release as this Blu-ray + DVD + CD combo of ""The Big Gundown"" is. Not only is the picture crystal clear, with fine color tones, but they also have included an extra CD of Ennio Morricone's truly great soundtrack to go along with the package. With the price of this whole set just under 25 dollars (!), this is clearly a work of love from the Grindhouse Releasing, not merely business. The amount of copies is limited. So, better hurry, if you want to get this very essential spaghetti western into your collection. I doubt if a better release after this one is possible!",1389571200,4,856,4.529032258064516
5774617,5,B00D4G0O4E,"Easily one of the top five Italian Westerns. Entertaining, well directed and exciting. Lee Van Cleef was never better. A classic that deserves to be seen by a much wider audience.",1389052800,,179,4.806451612903226
5774618,5,B00D4G0O4E,"It's Awesome to see this movie again,after years of glimpses from late night TV and in a bar somewhere with no sound. They've done it justice in a nice package with the original score thrown in. Believe me,it is not a throw in. Morricone's score is Beautiful.",1388188800,,259,4.531914893617022
5774619,5,B00D4G0O4E,"This Grindhouse 4-disc package is terrific and includes both a Blu-ray Disc and DVD of the English language 95minute version of The Sergio Sollima written/directed film, THE BIG GUNDOWN (1968) and the Blu-ray complete 110 minute directors' cut, LA RESA DEI CONTI (presented in Italian with English subtitles,) as well as a CD of the original music soundtrack by Ennio Morricone. The 2.40:1 widescreen transfer is gorgeous. Up until now, this amazing film had only been available in crudely abridged 85-95 minute English language versions which cut out early and middle sections of the chase, including the brilliantly constructed showdown at the opening of the film where star, Lee Van Cleef's character shoots three robbers at his campsite. Thankfully, now the story in its entirety can be enjoyed in a beautiful looking transfer on a format playable on typical American Blu-Ray players. A comparison of the differences between the edited film and the original European version can be found in the audio commentary on the Blu-ray English-language version and in a section of the liner notes (booklet.)  Other extras include an in depth interview with the director/writer of the film, Sergio Sollima, actor Thomas Milan and Sergi Donati and extensive still galleries, TV advertisements, and trailers.

THE BIG GUNDOWN is a fascinating story about a freelance bounty hunter, (Lee Van Cleef) who is hired by a rich railroad tycoon to find a wily Mexican outlaw (Thomas Milan,) with knife throwing skills who has supposedly raped and murdered a 12yr-old white girl. Each time Cleef is is about to capture him he is outwitted by Milan who always manages to get away.  Their adventure follows the two across the West as the renegade hides out with a group of Mormons and then a sadistic female rancher who rules with a whip, after that a monastery in Mexico and eventually his hometown where he meets up with his wife. It is in his hometown that the Mexican outlaw finds himself pursued by not only Cleef but also an Austrian henchmen, the railroad tycoon's son-in-law, and a posse of Mexican rancheros who flush him out of a sugar cane field and corner him in the desert.  It is at this point that the real culprit of the 12yr-old girl's murder and rape is revealed and a climactic gunfight ensues.

The driving force behind Sergio Sollima's gun-slinging epic is the inter-relationship between two men.  The two incompatible characters i.e., the white American bounty hunter (Van Cleef) and the Mexican thief (Milan) at first are in opposition but through the course of their adventure empathy develops as similarities between themselves are revealed. Milan's nonconformity clashes with and compliments Van Cleefs' rigid sense of justice. Both have killed men but usually in self-defense and never in cold blood. Both men are products of their backgrounds and reflect their social status. Both are quick, Milan like an alert wild animal, Van Cleef like a well-trained militant.

With themes that condem racisim, class bias, abuses of the law, and opposing characters that learn they are less different then they seem, THE BIG GUNDOWN is a fascinating story filled with action that is definitely worth watching and thanks to the impressive 2K digital transfer and stunning bonus features it is more pleasurable than ever.

*** IF YOU WANT THE 110 min. DIRECTOR'S CUT IN ENGLISH... ***
Unfortunately, for some, the 110 minute director's cut on the incredible Grindhouse, limited 4-disc package is only available in Italian-Language with English subtitles. If this is a problem for you, maybe because you hate reading movies, an English language version of the directors' cut is available. I own a German released, 3-disc Blu-Ray & DVD Combo by Explosive Media, DER GEHETZTE DER SIERRA MADRE (now also available on Amazon) which is similar but the 110minute Blu-Ray version is presented with English-Language audio throughout (except for a few scenes that were never overdubbed in English.)  Although both Blu-Ray and DVD are listed as Region B, on the Explosive Media release, the Blu-Ray (despite what the package says) will play on any American Blu-Ray equipment however, the 2 other DVDs; one with Bonus Material and the other with a 106 minute version of the movie, will not. This too is an excellent and worthwhile release. BTW: If you're a fan of Euro-westerns, as I am, you may want to consider purchasing an all-regions player. It's worth the small investment since many of the best releases of Euro-westerns are in non-American formats.",1387756800,16,4539,5.07372654155496

8589555,5,B00D4G0O4E,"This has been called the best spaghetti western that wasn't directed by Sergio Leone (of the Clint Eastwood trilogy). I heartily agree. Plus it has a Ennio Morricone soundtrack. Although the big name star is Lee Van Cleef, Tomas Milan steals the show as the thief who always says, ""You'll never catch me."" We see some interesting character development on the part of both principals.",1527638400,,383,4.907692307692308

8589557,5,B00D4G0O4E,"Three Stars for the product pricing range. No Blu-ray that is not a box set or series/trilogy should be priced this high. The movie gets 5 stars! ***** One of the best Spaghetti Westerns you can get your hands on. This edition does include much and I give it to Grindhouse Releasing for presenting this kick-ass film in this remastered condition with a little extra. Now there are other versions out there at equal compare, (I have them all) so this price is not justified, don't know if is in low quantity? Its OK at $25-27 (the price I got it for), good extras, but no reverse poster cover. Hard core collectors already have DVD versions, so adding that on should be a free bonus. The sound track bonus is great! But again if you are an avid Spaghetti western collector, you might already have the soundtrack (In my case I do) so It boils down to the presentation and extra features like interviews, Audio commentary and more about the film. A few dollars under 30 bucks was a good deal. I recommend ( for this price as of now) you get two other versions from France and Germany and you'll have a handful for a few dollars less, until they re-print this release, or price goes down.
