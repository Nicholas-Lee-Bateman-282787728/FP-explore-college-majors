6285260,5,B00IQ8TT82,"someone give it a 2 star? and didn't like it? Clearly not a fan!! this is an Awesome concert! Great stage setup, great picture quality, incredible sound! awesome setlist of songs! must have for both White and Rob Zombie fans alike. I Also recommend the Book, The Rob Zombie picture book! very limited with fantastic photos of the concert on hard back cover!!",1400889600,,358,4.698412698412699
6285261,5,B00IQ8TT82,"Rob Zombie said before that he didn't want to do a concert film, but it was inevitable. So as expected, he pulled out all the stops to make it worth watching. Clearly because he was the director as well as the performer, he included his own film-making style in the production of this film not solely devoting the use of digital equipment, or so I assume he didn't as certain shots feature grain found on film. These techniques give it the look you would expect from his movies. As far as sound, the Blu-Ray gives you three options: DTS, Dolby True HD, and stereo. Zeuss (Shadows Fall, Crowbar, Earth Crisis) did great with the live mix, so it's totally up to you which audio option you prefer. The band performs a lot of songs that fans have come to know from over the years as well as a couple White Zombie hits. I personally wish there were a couple more songs, but I think they cover enough ones to satisfy my craving. This Blu-Ray is highly recommended.",1400803200,2,958,4.418079096045198
6285262,2,B00IQ8TT82,"I'm an RZ fan back to the White Zombie days and also a huge John 5 fan, so buying this was a no brainer.  I was excited to see it.  Well, it pains me to say it but it's just not very good.  Rob sounds like he's out of breath a lot and he omits words all over the place.  The stage overshadows the players with screens that are brighter than the stage lighting.  As if it weren't hard enough to watch already, RZ adds layers of Instagram-style effects to the video footage to render it muddy.  Don't waste your money on the blu ray, for sure.

I know other fans will slam this review, but it's the truth.  This isn't a good show and it isn't a good video.",1400803200,9,654,3.976923076923077
6285263,5,B00IQ8TT82,I can't wait to see this concert film. I was there in the sweltering heat for one of the shows he filmed!  I was a magical night!,1400803200,,129,3.7777777777777777
6285264,5,B00IQ8TT82,"I figured that Metal Icon Rob Zombie's Concert Movie would be ""off the chain"", and I was right! His music alone was enough to blow out the windows, and peel the paint off my trailer's walls! And the costumes and FX were a fine tribute to everything grotesque and macabre, in addition of homage to Rob's feature films. Of course this DVD is not for children! It contains both adult language, and gratuitous boobie flashing, which are the staples of many concerts of late. Make no mistake, Rob Zombie is a Metal God, and his legions of fans, as shown, are testament to this! A keeper of a DVD, for sure, one that I will play late at night on my home theatre. It will go over good in the quiet trailer park that I live in!",1400716800,4,719,4.255474452554744
6285265,2,B00IQ8TT82,"Had the potential to be a master piece, however failed miserably. I purchased the Blu Ray version of the concert & was disgusted to witness in crowed, shaky, grainy, B-Grade concert footage mixed into the ridiculously chaotic on stage footage. I bought a Blu Ray to witness Hi Definition & only Hi Definition. The on stage cameras are flooded with unnecessary special effects & are rapidly changing frames which becomes not only tedious to watch, but truly annoying as well. The only thing the concert has going for it is the sound quality, which is undoubtedly top notch. The concert footage however, you can throw in the trash. There are no special features or interviews with the band either, just a cheap, black & white, on screen photo gallery. The staple when it comes to a live concert recording is Rammstein's Live Aus Berlin.",1400630400,11,834,4.798611111111111
6285266,5,B00IQ8TT82,A must have for any Zombie fan!! ZOMBIE delivers again! PHENOMENAL showmanship! It has all the elements of great Zombie performances to relive again and again! Unbelievable stuff from one of the greats!,1400630400,2,202,5.151515151515151
6285267,5,B00IQ8TT82,"Yes sir, it is finally here! The document we all waited for after the release of the Zombie Live album years ago. For anyone that has seen the man and his band in concert, this is the perfect memory scene-setter. And for anyone who hasn't had the pleaseuse, encompassed herein is the best way to see what you've missed.
But after that, I have to tell you, this is so, so much more. This is the first concert film i've seen where the artist has turned just the replaying of a concert into what resembles a movie. Not just a band documentary with some interviews thrown in between songs. No, this is absolutelly pro. Zombie has never been one to release a film without going through the cutting room with a fine tooth comb, and putting his seal of approval on each and every piece. This concert (or pair of concerts) is no different. Stuffed together from two nights in Dallas, this show includes the very best moments from each. The sound is crisp, the guitar buzzes loud, the bass thunders, and the drums shake the walls. This band knows how to put on a show, and to have Rob Zombie as the master and commander really throws this thing into overdrive.
You really do need to see it, in order to understand fully, what is going on here. Can you enjoy it just as a Zombie show? Yes. Can you enjoy it as a Zombie film? Yes. Is it an experience like no other? YES!
Zombie fans, Metal fans, Music fans, Film buffs, come one, come all, and behold the magic and horror metal mastery that is Rob Zombie, John 5, Piggy D, and Ginger Fish!",1400544000,16,1528,4.327526132404182
6285268,5,B00IQ8TT82,"First off I would like to point out that the Blu Ray is all regions and does not include the DVD. For some reason Amazon has this listed as region B and multi-format. Only the single Blu-ray Disc is included. Now on to my review.

This is an awesome performance by a truly unique artist. Rob Zombie is an original in today's music scene, and this video helps prove that. This is more than a music video, it is a document of amazing proportions. The film is stylized in many different ways that make it more unique than any concert video I have viewed recently. The picture ranges from crystal clear HD to old looking monster movie film effects all while still proving to be a modern production. The stage costumes and stage effects are truly remarkable. Sound is also amazing on this blu ray. Three choices are available on the menu, including a rumbling DTS master 5.1 HD option that will rattle your walls. A short note for any parents out there, this video does include a fair amount of female nudity from some of the more adventurous concert goers. Doesn't bother me any, just wanted to point it out. Language, as expected, can also be strong at times. I would strongly suggest checking out this video from one of the most original musicians around today.",1400457600,43,1259,4.546255506607929

6285275,3,B00IQ8TT82,"This DVD is well produced and features John Five and Ginger Fish, so what's not to like? To me this felt like a caricature of what a metal concert used to be. Gone is the sense of danger and darkness. People were right up to the front without and pushing of crowd surfing. There was an occasional quick shot of some lamely tame mosh circles...""now don't get hurt boys!"". UGH! And whats with Zombie's energeticaly choreographed dance moves? Metal meets the Back Street Boys? I thought that about half of the songs really cooked and the rest were play by numbers. I saw Zombie years ago during the Hellbilly Deluxe tour. Now that was a metal show! Sadly this is not. Masks, flames, Nosferatu clips and Devil's horns (do they even know what they're doing?) can't compensate for dark energy and freedom. Safe family viewing.",1478563200,,820,4.662068965517242

6285315,4,B00IQ8TT82,"Why almost  ? The main reason I knocked off the 5th star is the vocals; they sound too high in the mix for my taste and are drenched in a lot of reverb making them sound harsh. Also there is too much intrusion of the audience mixed in during the songs and in-between them I found myself plugging my ears with my fingers till the next song started again. So if you want to hear the instruments at a realistic volume level you'll have to put up with these flaws.

Show : hellacious; 81' of relentless RZ and WZ material with a Grand Funk Railroad cover of We Are An American Band consisting mainly of the national anthem played on guitar with the teeth !! The editing is fast but cool, you won't get dizzy from it and yes there are a lot of low-def takes for effect but are very short and wisely intercalated not to ruin the overall experience; matter of fact as a fan of his movies and used to his videoclips as I am and knowing the man himself directed the movie I totally loved the whole videoclip, shock-rock, comic-book aesthetics and never expected clean, sterile footage to begin with. Rob even rides some animatronic, high-budget sci-fi animals on stage, the show was surely very expensive to produce!!!

 Some reviewer pointed out the band can't be seen because of either the low light or the strong light emitted by the led screens behind them but if your tv is properly calibrated like mine none of that is true. Most people use overdriven brightness and contrast so this kind of shows just won't look good. The show really pops with colors; the chroma is just perfect.

Sound : loud and clear and the overall tonal balance is just perfect in 2.0. Can't comment on the other mixes because I love frontal sound and just hate surround for concerts.

If you want something akin to a Rush concert, give it a pass. But if you are a fan and understand and share  Rob's idiosincracy, you gotta buy it, period. You won't regret it, guaranteed.",1408579200,5,1944,4.443820224719101
6285316,5,B00IQ8TT82,"This is the first concert DVD ROB ZOMBIE has put out.  Believe me, if your a ZOMBIE FAN EVEN IF YOUR NOT BUT LIKE THAT TYPE OF MUSIC.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.  I pre-ordered this on Blue Ray months before it was released.  Don't know why it took him so long to put a live performance on DVD.  But it was definitely worth the wait.  It was everything I expected it to be & more.",1408492800,,383,3.973684210526316
6285317,5,B00IQ8TT82,"Finally we got what we've been waiting for for years!  A live Rob Zombie concert dvd/blu ray.  I've scanned a few random reviews on here, and I think the reason some didn't like it is precisely the reason I did!  I love the weird strange camera cuts and going from B&W to Color to grainy to crystal clear.  It looks just like what you would expect from Zombie if you are a fan.  It's TOTALLY his style!  You can tell he cut it together himself as his vision is written all over it.

Sounds amazing.  Great song choices, one of his biggest shows ever.

Nothing really bad to say about it, although I wish he would have loaded it with backstage extras/interviews/them hanging out, etc...

Rob zombie's albums are amazing experiences: in my experience, you either get it or you don't. To see the translation of the album experience into the visual is beyond brilliant. The costume changes, the guitar designs, the clothes design show a superb visual dynamic. Some of the criticism of what I saw in this Blu-ray is kind of nonsensical, simply because if you have any familiarity with the album titles, then they must be some expectation of what the audience behavior is going to be.

Anyway, the band behavior is great; from song to song, the presentation is different, and appropriate for each song.
And the lead solo when Rob is out in the audience is just immaculate. If you know and love Rob zombie's music, this visual document is a great supplement to the music video extra in PAST PRESENT FUTURE, and you will love this: turn it on, crank it up and party it out with your living dead girl.

6285383,5,B00IQ8TT82,"The good:
Excellent Sound Stage, Performances, Camera Angles, Song Selection.
This is probably one of the most entertaining Heavy Metal Concerts I have seen only bested by Pink Floyd and Led Zep.  I was surprised Devil's Man and More Human than Human were played in the first half of the concert instead of the encore, but all worked out good.

The Bad
Rob Zombie is truly a physically debased human being.  He actually scared me watching him on certain footage.  A very talented character on stage.  The editor decided to go into a 1960's type film production on long shots.  I figured out why in  the Ugly.  Devils Man and More Human Than Human could have been better personalized, but that is my personal take on it.

The Ugly
Rob Zombie apparently decided to hire a bunch of strippers in the front center rows of this concert.  You can tell they are strippers by there unabashed demeanor and going topless.  Oh, yes, they're are many-many topless females which all appear to be strippers.  Regular bodied females are seen in the concert footage, but never go topless.  Also, most of the audience at Rob Zombie Concerts are males due to the nature of the music.  Very similar to AC/DC and NIN audiences.  Rob Zombie and company decided to edit close up stripper girls and put distant footage in 1960 filmography to mask the mostly male audience.  They appear to promote any future male concert audiences to believe the females will go crazy and be like Girls Gone Wild.  I didn't knock off a star for this as I was lmao too much over this observation and appreciated the concert.",1400889600,,1582,4.633093525179856

6285385,3,B00IQ8TT82,"I couldn't wait to finally get to see this one, Rob's first official live concert video. He's never toured here before, so I was excited to see how his shows look live.

Visual (   )
After seeing it now, look, i'm not trying to sound bitter or anything like that, but some parts of this things visual representation is over used and I was sick of seeing it by the end.

I understand that Rob produced this himself.. and I can understand using either an effect to recreate, or perhaps even using an 8mm cmaera for that old grainy 60's/70's home video effect. But honestly, I think I wouldn't have minded had Rob just used it during one song, and not made it a continues theme throughout the whole concert. It became pretty annoying by the end when it goes from HD to that and back again constantly. I don't get what Rob's fascination with using those angles was for the duration of the whole concert? He didn't use the split screen effects in anything but one song, so why continually use that annoying one? Especially since for most of the time it's shooting into the audience and showing fights happening in the crowed by drunken idiots. Who the hell wants to see that?

Also some of the footage seems to be out of place. I have a feeling the 8mm footage may not actually be from this show recorded in Texas. As when you look into the back of the stadium, there is no outside, but then it cuts to footage from a grassy outdoors area. Still, no biggie, who cares, right? Just an observation.

Audio (   )
The sound is mostly perfect. There was a couple of times now and then I thought there was too much bass in the mixing, but the sound for the most part is fantastic... for what they recorded anyway. Sometimes Rob's voice sounds out of breath, but i've known that for years. I think what it comes down to is we mostly listen to the recorded versions and forget they had 100 goes to get a pitch right, or mixing and effects can really make certain things stand out. So I do admit, it was much more popular numbers like ""Living Dead Girl"" & ""Dragula"" is where I noticed it mostly. But I won't deduct stars away from the performance just because of that, it's just something singers do and are victim to, so I can except it as something out of their control... not to mention you probably grow tired of singing the songs night after night the same way, so you do change things up. So don't go into this thing expecting to hear word for word the way you hear it on albums. However Rob's energy through the show is much higher than I thought! You can tell he's drained by the end of the show, but he puts on a hell of a show!

Cons (   )
- Only thing on this disc, DVD or Bluray, is the concert with 3 audio options... then there is a photo gallery. Come on Rob, you're a movie director, you should know by now fans love bonus footage. Why is nothing else included here? One idea would have been to have an option to watch the movie the way you cut it... then have another version fully in HD without those 8mm shots, and then one you can guarantee no one will watch from start to end with the all 8mm version. But then again, even if it had that, we would still complain we want more. Couldn't we have bonus performance footage, like when Rob joins Alice Cooper on stage, or vice verse? A few older live performance shots of songs not on this set list? Anything would have been nice. But no one considers trailers or photo galleries to be bonus features, so technically this release has zip bonus content.",1400889600,3,3504,4.285930408472012

8644596,4,B00IQ8TT82,"The Zombie Horror Picture Show is a live release by the Industrial Metal band Rob Zombie. It was filmed in Texas and released in 2014 on DVD and Blu Ray, his first full concert video release. The Blu Ray version is in 1080p with DTS HD Master 5.1, Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and PCM stereo options.

Live CDs are great, but Rob Zombie has always been about spectacle, about visual, about putting on a show. It just makes more sense to release it in a visual medium. Heres a list of things you can find on this concert film: Multiple costume changes (including prosthetic Nosferatu ears and a light-up mouth-guard) when the band are already decoratively dressed and wearing make up to begin with; Multiple screens (showing a mixture of crowd footage, scenes from the music videos and dedicated footage such as horror imagery, strip tease, psychedelic visualizers and karaoke sing along prompts), light-up guitars, a see-through drum kit (which also has pentagrams projected onto it at one stage), balloons, confetti, fireworks and pyro and steam cannons, lights and lasers, customized mic-stands, fake snow falling, hired dancers in big puppet costumes, a giant prop that says Zombie on it, a giant radio prop, a giant skeletal podium prop and even a giant steampunk-robot-chariot that drives around the stage and can move its head around. Thats more than most bands do in a whole career these days.

Its a very visual concert, with a lot to take in. The editing and camera work is all very high-budget stuff, lots of different angles available, movement, concentrating on the right parts of the song. Theres the occasional grainy film filters, or psychedelic looking screen mirrored down the middle or what have you, and during the intro, outro and a small selection of the more quiet parts itll cut to footage from the road. Its a very good looking film, well put together, not too stylized but not to plain. Very in keeping with Zombies tastes and artwork (Which makes sense seeing as Zombie himself directed it). Perhaps, theres a few too many titty-shots.  a much higher proportion than normal really. If thats off-putting to you then this aint the concert for you I fear, as theres no getting around it here.

The band, featuring drummer Ginger Fish and guitarist John 5 (Hey, remember how cool Marilyn Manson was live when those two were in the band!?) as well as bassist Piggy D are all on top form, no free rides! Rob himself performs well and enthusiastically, really getting into it, dancing, interacting with the audience, going into the crowd etc. His vocals, which have been criticized on previous live releases are very strong here, and not a weak link at all. From everyone involved its a good performance, and the crowd seem into it.

The setlist is great; out of all of Zombies live albums this has the most wide-ranging setlist, covering five solo albums and two White Zombie albums. Across its 80 minute length youll find all the hits youd expect like Dragula, Living Dead Girl, Never Gonna Stop (The Red, Red Kroovy), Sick Bubblegum etc. Theres material from the then-new album Venomous Rat Regeneration Vendor (including a really storming rendition of Dead City Radio). Theres also a brief drum solo and a slightly longer guitar solo where John 5 really gets to shred. Theres the popular Grand Funk cover of Were An American Band. The Educated Horses album is the least drawn-from album but then there was already a live album from that touring cycle so its good not to just repeat the same setlist twice. Everyones tastes are different and Id personally have loved to add in Scum Of The Earth and Werewolf Women of the SS but otherwise it is a pretty amazing selection.

Sound wise, its is decent. The White Zombie covers sound nice and thick, and the more organic material from his solo catalogue fairs really well. Some of the more industrial sections maybe sound different live than on record but not in any way that spoils them. My only minor gripe is that my favourite Zombie song, the very catchy Ding Dang Dong De Do Gong De Laga Raga isn't just as crunchy and massive live. Its good, but not just as satisfying. I think its just because theres only one guitar track live and in the studio they can beef it up with more. Minor nitpick at most though.

There isn't much in the way of extras at all, just a gallery, not even a booklet with linear notes or anything, but to be honest I bought it for the concert in the first place so thats ok I guess.

Overall, in terms of set,sound, performance, spectacle, visuals and editing this is a very good concert film and I highly recommend it. If you are a fan already it is pretty perfect and as an introduction to the band it serves as a pretty high quality greatest hits package with a nice career spanning collection of songs to give you a flavour for different eras.",1496361600,,4832,4.683156654888104
