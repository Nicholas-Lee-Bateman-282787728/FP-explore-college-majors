It was so good to see Dan Stevens as Captain Gilbert Evans, someone whose appearance and character was so similar to Matthew Crawley in Downton Abbey.

5785905,4,B00DB43PLI,"Lovely, and heartbreaking.  Well acted period film about real people in the early 1900's.  Fine job of casting, and beautiful cinematography.  I never understand why people who don't care for this type of film watch and then criticise.  Not certain what you were expecting.  It's a movie, and really, does such a small amount of your time really make your life that miserable?  Let's move on to the next film, shall we?

5785911,3,B00DB43PLI,"Like many other reviewers here, I found the acting & production value to be amazing.  Dominic Cooper is great as the volatile, unpredictable artist AJ & Dan Stevens gives a nice performance as decent, earnest Gilbert Evans, along the same vein as Matthew in Downton Abbey.  What gives me pause is the story that is told of the love triangle.  It's hard to sympathize with Florence when she obviously makes the wrong choices over & over.  This is based on a true story so perhaps the screenwriters were bound by the truth somehow, but if they had tweaked the script to show the attraction between AJ & Florence initially & explain why she chooses to stay in the marriage, it might have been better.",1458000000,2,697,4.596774193548387

5785920,2,B00DB43PLI,"Based on a true and famous artist who apparently had as ugly a personality and character as the painter Turner (I couldn't stomach that British movie at all) -- the book has to be better than the movie.  The point of view is not clear in the movie. I now want to see if the book confirms my suspicions.

It is supposed to be based on the diary of a wealthy soldier from South Africa who finally takes action, but does not do enough to make a difference in the life of the woman he claims to love.  Is he drawn to the masochism of the female character as a voyeur in the book also?  If he really loved her why couldn't he act? He knew her life was in danger. There could be many reasons, but none are given in the movie.

We used to commonly believe it was natural for woman to be masochistic.  Freud told us so.  With feminism, more woman have found they don't have to act out self-destructive urges or make such gestures habitual and a part of their character. I think both men and women are happier without such false beliefs and attitudes.  Spoiler alert: Yes, such relationships still happen but fully acting out sado-masochism to the point of suicide is no longer glamorized.

This movie is a throw back to another time. Yes such relationships could easily have happened.  Yes it could be made interesting but you must show how. But this film does a lousy job of handling the true nature of masochism.  Florence never seems at all attracted to AJ, the self-centered, loud, rough and rude artist.  Neither is the artist shown as attracted to her. Masochism as traditionally expressed as a pleasure, however mixed with painful drama and however sick it appears to us now.  The couple never seemed to have any pleasure.

We as viewers have to make up an unseen life that must have happened between them or why would they get married?  We shouldn't have to do that.  The movie gives us no motivations for their behavior.  In fact in shows them hating each other from the very beginning.  AJ destroys her face in his painting.  And she immediately sees that he will never help her with her career or have respect for her views and needs.  Whenever she's around him she's clearly unhappy, always ill at ease, and we always are expecting the worst behavior at any moment.

The characters, especially AJ, seemed not to see or hear Florence.  It was as if they were acting in separate rooms. This was unreal.  Even if you hate someone, you will respond to their behavior and reactions in some way.

I'm not sure the film's producers even knew they were creating a movie about masochism, but that is all the movie is about.  Their lack of awareness is obvious.  Perhaps they were distracted by the beautiful coast of Cornwall and the history of this ""real"" artist.  Nevertheless, their primary focus should've been on the effect of the story, what it's saying and weather it's said well. The movie fails to communicate anything well except sentimentality about death and a sweet sick sentimentality about missed love.

I was left feeling no one had really loved anyone.  Spoiler alert: The painting of Florence given as a momento to the lover by the husband at the end communicated the opposite of love.  She was no longer alive -- what a waste -- and that was sentimentalized as a warm memory to hang over the fireplace. There is a sadism to the behavior of the men, both men -- and the film producers, including the audience by extension.  The soldier was the voyeur watching a sado-masochistic relationship, and ""loving"" Florence all the more for the role he could play as her temporary savior/lover from what she was suffering.

Perhaps another woman artist who (it is hinted) learns something from the behavior of Florence could have saved the movie.

Another thing I don't like about these real-life artist movies is that they seem to be saying artists are more messed up than most people and in an irredeemable way.  I'm not convinced that's true. And even if it were true, I don't feel a need to ""experience"" directly such ugly lives in a movie or book.  A film producer who wants to take on the dark facts about a jerk who happens to be a great artist, has to bring a unique and startling vision of hope or contrast to him with a stronger point-of-view character.  This one didn't quite make it.",1457222400,,4299,4.544863459037711

5786044,3,B00DB43PLI,"It's not a terrible film, but it's not what it could have been either. The plot itself, which is factual, is paper thin and the three leads aren't charismatic enough to give it the dramatic power it should have. Alfred Munnings actually went on to become of of the greatest painters of horses in action, so we could have done with a bit more of that in the screenplay. The big plus is the photography, which is beautiful. The Cornwall coast looks stunning, and the production values are top. But you need stars for this kind of film, and what you have here are are actors who are not in that category, so at times it feels like a prestigious Sunday night television drama. If you check out the real story of this odd triangle, and the confusing behavior of the central female character, which does at times seem inexplicably neurotic, you'll probably get more out of this film. It's trying to be a Merchant Ivory - production, but the polish and brilliance of that pair at their best, is lacking here. But if you area fan of Downton Abbey - which I'm not - you will probably enjoy this. Some of the comments on this site are hilarious.

The main female lead is not someone I wanted to relate to.  At least in horror films, I yell at the screen and tell them to not be so ridiculous...but with her, man, I just didn't care about her at all.  The supporting roles and extra characters did not seem to have purpose and were just there to fill space.

It doesn't flow.  It doesn't make you like the characters.  It seems to spend more time focusing on a character without complexities (or too many complexities that the script decided to not reveal).  The two male leads could have been fascinating, as well...but they just seemed to exist to show that the female lead was more intent on playing a victim.  Woe is her.  It does not do actual victims any good and just plays into a sad stereotype.

She actually tries to kill herself on the day of their wedding with some liquid in a bottle marked ""poison"".  Well, it doesn't get any more obvious than that.  Stevens rescues her, and she recovers.
Stevens' character, meanwhile, volunteers for a stint in the army in Africa.  Before he goes, they have a hot and steamy night of great sex.  She becomes pregnant.  Stevens leaves for Africa, and during a party some months later, it is obvious that she is beginning to show.  Her husband calls her a whore, she confesses to a friend that the baby could not be his, and then she goes into a room, takes out that same bottle marked ""poison"" and drinks it.

He's an educated person - the version of the DVD I own has an interview with him in the ""Extras"" section.  However, every time he appeared on screen, I half expected his character to say, ""Oh, drat!  It's really time for me to head up to Downton today!""  THEN when he's being driven in the car away from the hotel, all I said outloud, ""Don't go into that car!  It's a death trap...oh wait...that's something else Dan Stevens was in.""

I didn't quite ""get"" the issue with Emily Browning's character.  Why stay married to somebody when they try to kill themselves ON THEIR WEDDING DAY (or so it appeared in the film).  Was it because her husband was one of those WILD and UNTAMED talented artist types?  I found his character more interesting than Emily Browning's.  Which isn't the fault of the actors, obviously.

5786283,3,B00DB43PLI,"Trigger Warning(s): Scene of attempted rape

It has been almost a year since I have last seen an Emily Browning movie, and while I could have certainly watched Pompei, I didn't want to since it seemed so bleh. However, with Summer in February I thought this was going to be a cute period drama, something which could work well for Browning since she seems destined, due to her porcelain doll looks, to be in quite a few British period dramas. But with her not having the best record when it comes to movies, at least with me, does this one continue the trend or break it?

Characters & Story

After having a fight with her father about a man who was the perfect match for her, Florence (Emily Browning) runs away to live with her brother Joey (Max Deacon) in the pursuit of not just getting away from their father, but also to paint. And what better a place to end up for with the great AJ Munnings (Dominic Cooper) sharing the same circle as Joey, as well as Harold Knight (Shaun Dingwall), there are many possible teachers and mentors in town. Though it seems with Florences beauty, these artist would prefer her to replace local model Dolly (Mia Austen) over really providing tutelage. So she has to force the point she came to learn to paint.

However, in the pursuit of justifying her stay to her father, she ends up attracting two men. The first being AJ, the wild and passionate painter, and then Gilbert (Dan Stevens) who is this calm, cool, and collected military man. And while the film, at first, presents Florence as a girl who isn't looking for love, just good company, knowledge, and maybe someone to match wits with, she soon falls for one of these boys and the quality of the film falls with it.

Praise

As noted in the introduction, Browning certainly has the perfect look for a period drama. Add in the right amount of cheekiness she possesses in her voice, as well as a look which screams naivety, innocence, and perhaps privilege, and I think you have a prime candidate for a Jane Austen adaptation. However, in terms of this story, while Austen-esque sarcasm isn't on display, for the first 40 or so minutes Browning is quite a sight and her character Florence seems like someone who demands to be taken seriously. With this you are presented a rather interesting picture in which a woman seems to not mind male attention, even enjoys it a bit, but seems committed to becoming a better artist over anything else. Which, for me, I thought was a perfect direction for the film. Though with it being based on a true story, and set in the early 1900s, I should have knew it was too good to be true.

Criticism

If just because, unfortunately, with Florence falling in love, or perhaps more so in great admiration, her story as an artist slips away as she ends up a love interest. One who seemingly picked the wrong man, slowly loses reason to draw, and becomes a bore to watch. Mostly due to all her wit, and any sense of moxy, just disappearing. Making the hour after she becomes married, at first, a bit interesting since we see her deal with insecurities and what not, but after a while things feel like they are just dragging on and it makes you wish what happened in those first 40 minutes still was going on rather than the mess you are left with.

Overall: TV Viewing

Despite rarely giving any Emily Browning film an overall positive review, I do remain a fan. Not just because I think she is attractive either, if anything I think it is because she certainly has talent, but the issue is she doesnt find films which are good throughout. They start off strong but once the drama starts to really kick in, usually the film falls apart. Which is what leads to the TV Viewing label for this film since the film started good, not strong but good, and I liked seeing Browning use her great ability to seem vulnerable, a bit cheeky, and certainly someone who could hold her own against not just the male gaze, but all the talent around her. However, once she got diminished to a love interest it was all downhill. Her life became about who her husband may have been with, her wondering if she made the right decision, and then her wanting to escape from her husband. All making for the type of drama done far too much for this film to not put any effort into trying to stand out and make things interesting.",1410652800,2,4327,4.479695431472082

5786291,2,B00DB43PLI,"Don't put too much store in this film's proximity to WW1;  it ends before the War really becomes part of the script---had we gotten that far it would be all but de rigeur to kill off one of the romantic male leads, if not both of them, that being the nature of WW1 movies with a romantic feature.

No, this film is about a love triangle between two male artists and the woman who rather capriciously marries one of them.  The wrong one of course.  Then, she gets depressed, and finally, she kills herself.

Was that a spoiler?

You'd think a love triangle between artists would be a lot steamier, with a whole lotta nudity.  There is some full frontals, but...  well if you're a straight guy or lesbian who's found modern movies frustrating---all that full frontal male nudity----you should love the early part of this film where most of the female leads show everything but their ankles!  For the women and gay guys, with these two hunky male leads, Dan Stevens from ""Downton Abbey"" and Dominic Cooper who showed most everything in ""Mama Mia"", well, I hope you like period suits and overcoats.  Stevens basically reprises his Cousin Matthew job by mooning over the woman who ends up marrying the other guy.  I look forward to seeing him in his action movie role, where he seems to be trying to show us something different.

Disappointed that the story did not deliver, the director did not deliver even though he has this talented group of actors. They tried to add nudity and for what? Added nothing to this movie. Poorly written. The connection of the script writing to screen just was not there. The connection between scenes and the actors not there.

5786303,3,B00DB43PLI,"This uneven pre-World War I romantic drama features a good enough cast, including Dan Stevens of Downton Abbey fame, in a leading role. The cinematography is gloriously rich, featuring the wind swept coastline and hills of Cornwall England. The acting is solid, and the 3 lead actors are developed enough to carry the screenplay past its, at times, abrupt shifts in this love triangle story-line. Although based on the notorious, but now celebrated, Lamorna art community of the early 1900s, the ""back story"" of this movement and its contributions to British art is underplayed, in my opinion. If you know little or nothing about that movement, you might find yourself, as I did, struggling to piece together the significance of the Lamorna community. That shortcoming was briefly mollified after the last scene of the film when it was revealed on screen that 3 of the real-life artists featured in the story had been inducted into the British Royal Academy of Arts -- Sir Alfred Munnings (AJ in the film) and Laura & Harold Knight.",1408924800,,1032,4.936781609195402

5786307,2,B00DB43PLI,"None of the character choices make much sense in this film about three essentially weak people.  It may be the fault of the screenplay, since the acting was solid, but I really felt no connection to or investment in the characters.  Just because something is based on a true story doesn't mean the story is particularly worth telling.  In defense of the full frontal female nudity mentioned by several viewers, I found it to be about as repulsive as viewing the Venus de Milo or some other classic nude portrait.  It was intended to depict the beauty of the female form in a film about art, and was not presented sexually, although there was a nude sex scene in addition that some viewers may want to avoid.  The cinematography in this film is gorgeous, but there are far more compelling films if you're looking for a beautifully filmed, tragic, romantic period drama love-triangle: I'd recommend watching ""The Painted Veil"" or ""The House of Mirth"" instead if you haven't already seen these films.",1408665600,,997,4.773255813953488

We thought it was part of the movie, that she was wearing a mask that would later reveal her beauty was not as plastic perfect as her husband thought. The story line didn't go beyond the first scene, it was repetitive and oh so boring!

5786322,4,B00DB43PLI,"I love period pieces and movies about art: why people make it, how they paint, what their studios are like, how their minds work. This movie was a little about that, but more about the friendship and love triangle between the woman who marries the wrong man (a brilliant artist) and the man (her husband's ""best  friend"") she should have married. I would watch Dan Stevens in anything. His character is very similar to his Downton Abbey character. We don't know what happened to Florence, also an artist and the love interest, before she arrived on the scene, but as the movie progresses, we can imagine that she was suicidal. She marries AJ, a brilliant artist and not-a-very-nice character and tries to kill herself on her wedding day, when she realizes her mistake. As the movie progresses, she finds happiness with Gilbert, a stand up gentleman. Their happiness is short-lived, when he leaves for Africa. He promises to write to her and return. We believe him. Unfortunately, now Florence is pregnant with Gilbert's child and when her husband finds out and calls her a ""whore,"" she can think of nothing else to do but kill herself and her unborn child. What a sad tale. Even sadder, when before the credits roll, we learn it was based on true characters.  The plot was subtle, as were the shifts in relationships. It's a British movie, after all, and no one is clobbering the viewing audience with the obvious. Left me feeling sad knowing Florence was clearly suicidal the entire time and no one really knew what to do about it in those days (obviously, keeping poison out of her hands and maybe rethinking that house on the cliff?). Felt sadder for those left behind and the innocent she took with her. Even in those days, divorce happened, and children were conceived.

One falls for her but she ends up marrying another, an individual that turned out to be an awful husband driving his wife to suicide.  The movie's first half takes great pains to build up the idea of Munnings as some kind of monster but, in the post-wedding second half, Florence's paranoia and possessiveness garner audience sympathy towards the pugnacious painter. She accuses him of acts we never actually see him commit, which makes her come across as little more than an unreasonable harpy.

Dan Stevens played pretty much the same character here - I would have preferred he'd stayed with DA as he now seems to have been type cast. Anyway, I thought the development of the friendship between the two men was lacking, and therefore it was hard to understand the rivalry for the girl. Also, the girl was obviously in love with Dan's character, yet she (spoiler alert here) agreed to marry Dominic's character - an ill-fated decision.

I'm a fan of British period pieces and can't believe I had missed this one.  Rather like watching a Cornish Downton Abbey feature starring my favorite DA character.

After viewing this film, I was interested enough to spend a couple of hours reading everything I could find on the main characters.  Gilbert Evan's family has a particularly interesting website to find out what happened to him in the remainder of his life.  He didn't marry until almost 50 years old, seemed to me he carried the torch for Florence for many many years.  AJ Munnings didn't even acknowledge his marriage to Florence in his own biography.

5786438,4,B00DB43PLI,"Set in Cornwall in the early 20th century (think Downton Abbey), Summer in February, based on a book by Jonathan Smith, tells the story of a dark love triangle between British artist, Alfred Munnings, his friend; Gilbert Evans, his friend and a soldier; and Florence Carter-Wood, an artist-in-training. It gives you a glimpse of the Lamorna Group composed of Munnings (Dominic Cooper); Laura Knight (Hattie Morahan); and Harold Knight (Shaun Dingwall).  I watched it because Dominic Cooper, Hattie Morahan and Dan Stevens were all cast in the film, just as they were in the 2008 adaptation of Sense and Sensibility. This movie was beautiful in setting and the acting was so engaging, I kept watching even though I was thinking there has to be more to this story. I have not read the book. I believe the book will be infinitely better. Emily Browning is a striking woman, so I was captured by her performance as Florence Carter-Wood, the woman Munning and Evans are at odds over. Dan Stevens as Gilbert Evans got to wear a newsboy cap, just like in Downton Abbey, and he and Dominic Cooper really convey more through expression than in words the undercurrent between them. The lack of story though had Gilbert Evans wanting to propose to Florence and he just met her. At 1 hour and 41 minutes, I saw it was ending and thought, ""This can't be good."" When I saw in the credits it was a true story, I was so upset. The movie is very dark and raw in its emotional landscape, but so poignantly beautiful in it's truth. I gave it four stars because of the story, which needed to follow more of the book. I will have to watch Sense and Sensibility again tonight just because I've felt so low since finishing the movie yesterday. I felt like I was in my women's literature class again shaking my head over a woman who not only is stupid enough to marry a man she's clearly afraid of while a man who clearly loves her and wants the best for her is right there. And she carries around a bottle of cyanide to take her out of that world that she's building when she's had enough. Madame Bovary came to mind.

I realize that this movie is based on a true story so events can't be changed but I found this movie quite depressing and wish in the end I'd never watched it. From the unspoken love between Florence and Gilbert, to AJ's narcissistic and abusive behavior, to Florence's multiple suicide attempts. This movie was not redeeming in any way that made me feel like it was worth watching. I didn't understand Florence's behavior in any way. I don't understand why she agreed to marry AJ when it was obvious that feelings had already developed for Gilbert. She had plenty of opportunity to back out before marrying AJ. The only conclusion I can make is that Florence was mentality unstable which ultimately shone through when she committed suicide. What was the point in Florence and Gilbert finally getting together near the end of the movie if Gilbert was just going to take off to Africa for years and Florence was just going to kill herself and Gilbert's unborn child???",1402444800,2,986,4.8

I felt that it could have been ""implied"" that they were nude if that was needed for the context of the story, but it was not necessary to explicitly show it.  (One time was an artist painting a female and another was swimming in the ocean). Also there was around 4-5 ""F"" words, violence towards a female character, a lot of drinking/smoking, sensuality and other mature content. The plot was underdeveloped and depressing. The thing that made it more bearable, I suppose, was that it was based on a true story so there wasn't perhaps a lot they could do to make it better/different.

5786506,3,B00DB43PLI,"Director seems to have lost his way mid-movie.  Throughout the movie, the POV changes for no reason, the characters change for no reason and the dark scenes are dark enough I thought my screen had powered off.  It's pretty, the costumes are lovely, the horses are handsome, and the environments are top notch.  That said. It takes more than pretty for me to enjoy a movie (though it goes a long, long way).

Slight Spoilers inferred ahead:  While I am sure fans of Downton Abbey will wander by for a view of Dan Stevens in early 1900s garb again (and he does look great in it) his talents are wasted.  Yes he does some attractive pining and kissing, but there is little that isn't found in DA (I think they may have even re-used his hat and some hunting suits).  Just go re-watch that, unless you are terribly bored. Then, don't say I didn't warn you. Dominic Cooper plays an attractive rake who likes to prove his genius through the recital of Poe and Longfellow from memory.  I'm not really captured by his appeal, which is problematic to enjoying the movie I think, but if you like him, perhaps this would be enjoyable? Emily Browning is the ""moody"" (lots of mood, only about half of which is related to anything) and lovely lead and dresses well in white. While I found it to be passable, this seems to be a waste of a talented, lovely ensemble (including the supporting cast) into a bit of English Coastline drama.

If you are looking for something dramatic and lovely, there are a host of British dramas from a variety of periods and featuring actors of all sorts.  I'd recommend most of them over this. Fair warning, I am rather put off by stupid characters making dumb choices as entertainment.

5786513,2,B00DB43PLI,"If you are still mourning over Dan Stevens dying in Downton Abbey, here is a picture with the blond-haired, dreamy eyed Englishman.  However, don't expect much when it comes to the story, except that Dan comes across pretty much the same as Matthew Crawley.

Where do I begin? Hum, well, it's a period movie, apparently about a factual event.  Dominic Cooper plays A. J. Munnings, a talented artist who went onto to be a famous English painter.  Set on the Cornwall coast in England, it's a story of a group of artists who do nothing but paint.  Dan Stevens, who plays Gilbert Evans, is not an artist, but a friend of A.J. and in the military.

The story is a strange and nonsensical  love triangle.  Enter Florence Carter Wood, another young painter. She arrives in Cornwall to be with her brother and meets both A.J. and Gilbert.  Gilbert quickly falls in love with her, but A.J. wins the spoils instead. However, the entire affair is nonsensical.  Florence, who comes across as a pretty, young aristocratic woman, finds A.J. fascinating because of his talent.  However, he has a dark side. Even though it comes out before the wedding, she for some odd reason proceeds with the marriage as if she is helpless to do otherwise.

Of course, her decision reaps an unhappy life, while Gilbert broods over his loss of his true love.  Since I don't want to give the ""spoils"" away on this plot, I'll keep my remaining comments minimal.  The location on the Cornwall coast has spectacular scenery. There are a few unnecessary scenes of total frontal female nudity, which added absolutely no value to the story whatsoever.

Unfortunately, I cannot come away with anything lasting about this movie.  Though well acted, the story itself turned out to be a melodramatic affair that made no sense to me whatsoever.",1399766400,,1802,4.764516129032258

Emily Browning is perfectly cast in the role of beautiful and fragile society girl Florence. Dan Stevens makes a dashing gentleman, -much like his role in Downton Abbey-, portraying her shy upper class suitor Gilbert.  Less intriguing and void of charm, is Dominic Cooper in his portrayal of the arrogant and intolerable painter AJ Munnings. Though this is indeed based on a true and ultimately tragic story, it seems unlikely that Florence would fall for and marry Munnings. Moreover, that a close friendship between Munnings and Gilbert evolved, also comes across as rather improbable. Unfortunately, the script is bland and poorly executed. In the end, ""Summer in February"", fails to engage and drags out beyond tolerance.

There wasn't a valid reason, for the girl to marry the man she didn't really love, and that she knew was a womanizer.  The fact that she tried to poison herself on her wedding day, was a give away to what her married life might be like.  I just thought it wasn't a good story, but, as I said visually beautiful, and well photographed.  Guess I am just not sympathitic to artistic types involved in destructive behavior.",1398988800,,510,4.462365591397849

The film should be judged on the basis of how well both it and the actors presented the historical facts of the event.  In my opinion, it was done admirably and the characters were portrayed in a most sensitive manner.  While almost all should regard her (Florence Carter-Wood) choice when it comes to matrimony (choosing AJ Munnings over Gilbert Evans) as rather ridiculous, well, it was, but this is what she did.  The film recounts a sad tragedy in regards to life choices...if one leaves this film feeling depressed and frustrated, then so be it.  It has succeeded in 'taking you there'.",1398556800,2,715,4.925

You decide it was a mistake on your wedding day and try to end it; but chicken out and go for help? You manage to keep your husband from consummating the marriage (amazed he allowed that) and are brave enough to have an affair with his best friend who you really love. You get pregnant and contemplate suicide again, but power through until you husband figures out you're pregnant and calls you on it. Then, rather than go to your father (who wouldn't have been sympathetic), rather than go to your lover (who was in Africa working and you probably didn't have money), rather than go to a friend, or create and sell your own art, you finally succeed in killing yourself.

Dominic Cooper is, as usual, very strong in his performance in this uncomfortable triangle, first as the smitten suitor, unaware of the depth of conflicted affection from the object of his attention, and later as the frustrated husband who cannot fully understand his wife's seeming indifference to his love and his need for her.

Dan Stevens, whom most viewers will have seen as the almost painfully good Matthew in Downton Abbey ends up playing a similar role in this film and becomes less convincing each time he does it.  There were a few too many shots of his longing gaze or his wounded one, which were virtually identical.

The really meaty role here went to Emily Browning as Florence.  She is a flirting enigma when she first appears in Cornwall among the artists but as her relationships with the two friends becomes more complex and to her, insoluble, she becomes sad, brooding and desperate.  Unlike Mr Steven's performance, Ms Browning manages to convey complicated emotions.

In the end, I don't think this was a really good movie, but it is an interesting and little known story about two men who were well known in the first half of the 20th century art scene in England.  Where the performances might lack some much needed layering, the story is fairly compelling and was worth an evening's watch on Prime.",1397347200,,1579,4.737226277372263

Had no idea what the movie was about before watching it. It draws you in as you watch the development of the characters. Even though I had an idea who she would end up marrying and the consequences of that, I still hoped I was wrong.

It reminds us of younger times when we did things that we might not have done if we were older and wiser. Maybe things we might or might not change if we could.  All a part of the learning experience called life. If we are lucky we don't make decisions that cause real harm to anyone including ourselves. Sometimes we do.  The movie reminds us of a ,couple of things, that young people make rash decisions without thinking, and that everything is an opportunity to grow and change.

This is not a light, fun love story like in most of the movies that are just for fun but for someone who also likes to think during some movies.

5786701,1,B00DB43PLI,"Warning: Contains spoilers, because there's no way you'd want to watch this movie, so I won't be ruining anything for you.

This is, by far, the worst movie I have ever seen. Overall, the acting was pretty well done. However, it was somewhat confusing at first which character was which (I thought AJ was the married man, and eventually realized he wasn't). There was a definite lack in plot and character development. I kept waiting for the movie to have some kind of point. It didn't. I kept waiting for the storyline to get better. It didn't.

As the synopsis states, this movie is about a love triangle. Unlike most love triangle movies, however, there was no contest between the two suitors. One was a kind, caring, gentlemanly, wonderful man who was a great friend and took wonderful care of her. He loved her in the truest sense of the word, didn't push her beyond her boundaries, and was overall just the perfect option. The other was the complete opposite: a selfish, self-absorbed, complete and total jerk, who got drunk about every day and was verbally and physically abusive. Imagine my complete and utter consternation when she agreed to marry the jerk (AJ Munnings).

There is no logical reason for her accepting him. Yes, Gilbert (the fabulous Good Guy) had been interrupted (by AJ, of course) when he was going to propose to her, but still, she had no earthly reason to accept AJ. The movie doesn't even make it realistic - it literally doesn't give you a single reason why she says yes. She keeps insisting that AJ loves her, when it is so obvious to the viewer and to everyone in the movie that he does not because he's a selfish slob who only thinks of himself (which she actually tells him, more or less, a few minutes before he proposes and she accepts). This movie lacks human reason. There is NO connection between viewer and protagonist. Florence is the most unsympathetic protagonist I've ever encountered, and I've encountered plenty of protagonists I'm not fond of in both movies and books. She is by far the worst protagonist ever to have existed.

I think if the movie had given just one reason - just one - that she fancied herself in love with AJ, then I could have possibly understood just a little why she accepted him. There is no such reason, except possibly because he's an artistic genius and she feels important because she is the only woman he actually asked to marry him, although it's quite obvious he's had his way with plenty of women before.

As it is, I hated AJ, I hated Florence, I felt profoundly sorry for Gilbert, and I hoped in vain that the movie would have some sort of a satisfying twist at the end where human reason could be mildly mollified.

Very near the end of the movie, Florence finally realizes that she loves Gilbert, who is about to ship off to Africa with the army. She sleeps with him, he leaves, she finds out she's pregnant with his child, and she conceals it from AJ, with whom she has not slept with in the entirety of their marriage - in spite of myself, I felt sorry for the guy. He's male, he's human, it's only fair he expects his wife to sleep with him, and she won't. Being the jerk he is, he doesn't try to woo her into it, but almost rapes her. I didn't feel too sorry for him then. AJ realizes she's pregnant when she can't hide it any more, he calls her a whore in front of all their friends at a party, and she runs off and kills herself, and of course, her baby.

I have never seen such a despicable movie in my life. There was no point to it. There was no understandable sense to Florence's motivation. Any good main character has to have motivations that drive them rather consistently. Florence didn't have any. It appears she didn't have a brain.

The only logical reason I could come up with for the horrible storyline was that it must have been based on a true story. In which case, this is a story best left untold, because its idiot of a main character has no logic or reason, and she didn't make a single sensible decision the whole movie through.

There is one other concern I'll mention, as others have: the nudity. I was quite shocked, given the PG-13 rating, to see full-on, complete, no-holds barred nudity. We're talking everything there is to see in the female body, brazenly displayed. And, contrary to one reviewer's opinion, a movie about artists and art doesn't have to have such gratuitous nudity. Not to mention the fact that the movie synopsis didn't even mention that this was even a movie about artists, anyway. All it says is that it's a romance.

If you're looking for a romance movie, please do us all a favor and watch any other romance on the planet. I'm quite sure there isn't a worse one than this one. It's not worth your money, and if you're going to watch it on Prime, it's not worth your time. There is plenty of quality media out there; don't waste your time on this one.",1396828800,27,4891,4.479236812570146

I'm not sure who created this movie, but it is now one of my favorites. Let's begin with the scenery, absolutely gorgeous landscapes with the sea and the cottages, and the play of light and the music were perfect. The actors did an excellent job of drawing you in, taking you with them and telling a story that lets you see how decisions and emotions can effect your attitudes and accomplishments for the rest of your life. This was an outstanding job of showing you the life of a very famous artist, also makes you ponder if he would have become as famous and celebrated if he had not been smacked in the face with unrequited love. If things hadn't turned upside down for him, he may have carried on as usual at the shore- riding horses; drinking; and painting. Summer In February touches your emotions, gives you much food for thought and takes you back for a history lesson all at the same time. Great way to pass a little time.

5786714,3,B00DB43PLI,"This sad tome, is a true story, based upon the first marriage of the British painter Alfred Munnings with a painter, who inexplicably marries Munnings, even though it is obvious that she is in love with another man, who happens to be her husband's best friend.

The film is set in Cornwall in 1913, in an artistic community, the star of which is Alfred Munnings (AJ) as it appears he has the best shot of all the artists to become famous (which is indeed what happened) AJ is played by Dominic Cooper, whom you might remember from The History Boys and Mama Mia. Emily Browning plays the doomed and perpetually sad heroine, and the third part of the triangle is Dan Stevens, from Downton Abbey. Stevens is one of the weaker actors in Downton, in my opinion, and he doesn't shine much brighter here. He would do well to pick his next projects outside of early 20th century Britain before those are the only parts he will be considered for in the future.

As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a sad piece, and while the action is very subdued, the star of the film is the cinematography. It is exquisite. Each frame is gorgeously crafted, and that alone makes the film worth the watch.

This is apparently an adaptation of the novel of the same name, and perhaps I shall read the book to find out just why the woman married AJ instead of the man she seemed to truly love. It just was not handled very well in the film, and when she attempts to kill herself on her wedding night, that should have been a sign that this was not going to turn out terribly well.

Other reviewers mention the nudity, which did not bother me in the slightest. It is not gratuitous, and frankly, if they had not mentioned it, I would not be mentioning it here. Don't let it put you off.",1396742400,,1766,4.391437308868501

5786722,5,B00DB43PLI,"""Winter in May""

In the final analysis, this true story transformed from ""Summer in February"" into ""Winter in May"".  I found this movie to be an intriguing example of ""Art Imitating Life"".  The producers and actors created a masterful presentation on many emotional levels.

I read many of the reviews and it seems that some people ""didn't like the story"" because they could not grasp the underlying messages, and also because it didn't have a ""happy ending.""  Besides being a true story with a real life miserable ending, obviously the producers intentionally portrayed this.  For the many who stated in their reviews that they ""could not relate"" to this story, perhaps they are coming from a background of normal healthy relationships, and have not married a self-centered arrogant egotistical person, who is talented and entertaining on the surface, but sorely lacking in the ability to love anyone other than himself.  Perhaps this is why I CAN relate to this situation, because I lived it myself in some aspects.

Considering that the divorce rate is more than 50%, and a conservative estimate of those who are consumed by alcohol and/or drugs is at least 10%, I don't understand why anyone would say that they ""can't relate"".  Even those with good marriages have witnessed friends and/or family members who have married the wrong persons for the wrong reasons and then struggled with depression and despair due to feeling trapped in a situation they can't seem to escape from.

I don't know if this famous artist drank as much alcohol in real life as this film portrayed, but the point for young women is that if the guy drinks this much and acts this bad, don't ignore it and just focus on his ""good qualities"".  This artist was looking for someone to ""civilize"" him, and she found that challenge inviting.  She wanted to escape from her father's control, but her father appeared to be genuinely concerned for her future welfare.  Even though he found the artist to be unstable and unsuitable for his daughter's happiness, he still received him at his home with courtesy, and then gave them a lavish wedding.  Sometimes daughters marry the exact opposite of their fathers and sometimes they marry men just like their fathers, and the results are often influenced by what kind of man their father is.

If we could somehow figure all this out when we are young, we can avoid a lot of future misery and suffering, however most of us don't really understand ourselves until we are older, therefore youthful marriage is a big gamble.  Sometimes we learn our lessons in a bad relationship and get another chance to do better, however this artist's wife sadly believed that she wasn't going to have another chance at life, and her depression and despair drove her over the edge.  She was also publicly shamed for being pregnant by another man, which we have to remember that 100 years ago in British Victorian society, this was unthinkable and entirely unacceptable.  There wasn't much room for compassion and sympathy in that cultural environment, even though she was surrounded by the more liberally minded artists' community.

As she said, ""I made my bed and now I have to lie in it"".  My mother said those same exact words to me, and many years later she admitted to me that her mother said these same exact words to her.  My mother got pregnant before she was married at a young age, but fortunately for her, my father was a wonderful caring and responsible husband.  Lucky for her since her mother made it crystal clear that she wasn't going to be there for her if things didn't work out.  I also got pregnant before I was married at a young age, and my mother made it crystal clear to me that she was not going to be there for me if things didn't work out.  History repeats itself, but our stories had opposite endings, since my husband turned out to be the exact opposite of my father.  Thankfully I didn't kill myself, but back then there were times that I thought about it.....

So in many aspects this female character has my sympathy, but I just wish that she could have seen it coming, since her fiancee's behaviors were blatantly obvious to every one else except for her, the classic case of ""Love is Blind""...until it was too late by the time she realized it.... ""too late"" in the sense that in those days engagements were written in stone, and shame was lavishly dished out on those who dis-engaged.  She was a woman resigned to her fate, although she showed streaks of independence and self-preservation. Today's modern society would have applauded her if she left Mr. Wrong at the altar and flew into the arms of Mr. Right, but it sure as heck wasn't like that back then.  I think what some viewers are missing is knowledge of the extreme social constraints of that time period, and the British dictate to ""carry on with a stiff upper lip""....which she did attempt to do.  Perhaps the producers mistakenly took it for granted that movie viewers would be aware of this background history, which contributes to the understanding of this woman's distressing situation.  The actress who portrayed this character, has a unique gift of revealing the underlying emotional turbulance while this talented woman attempted to live her life in spite of disappointment and heartache.

A.J. had the most challenging multi-faceted role to convey, and that he did royally.  The artistry, the poetry, the enthusiasm, the charm, the drinking, the brashness, the impulsiveness, the arrogance, the insults, the conceit, more drinking, the disatisfaction, the dark side, the anger, the underlying emotional cruelty....

Dan Stevens exemplified the proper British gentleman of that time, who was also imprisoned by his social upbringing and military standards as a soldier.  In many aspects he was admirable, however if he could have spoken his heart to his beloved instead of retreating in defeat BEFORE she married Mr. Wrong, they might have lived happily ever after, even if they had to run off to Africa together....

Movies like this are not created solely for the entertainment value, but for the messages they convey and the opportunity for insight and reflection about ourselves and others.

""Summer in February"" actually became ""Winter in May"" because in real life, what should have been a ray of sunshine in a dark winter, transformed into cold bleakness in the heart of Spring.",1396742400,40,6384,4.840846366145354

5786738,2,B00DB43PLI,"I wanted to love this movie.  As a fan of British literature and film, I thought this would be the perfect film for a quiet Sunday by myself.  The British perfected the story of the tumultuous ""love triangle"" long before Twilight came around.  Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, every Austen book: they all have a beautiful and ""rebellious"" type female at the center of their stories with a man who seems perfect for her and a ""misunderstood"" brute who ends up being the one who really ""understands"" her. So in essence, this film could have been really good.  However -

Spoiler Alert:
I think all the actors / actresses in the film are talented in their own right, but they just lacked any chemistry with one another.  The setting is amazing - an artist colony in Cornwall overlooking the wild ocean.  A pub where all these artists get together and recite poetry to one another and drink and sing - Um, sort of my idea of heaven as a literature nerd.  But its the characters that kept killing this story.  The ""brutish"" artist played by Dominic Cooper is really a jerk with no redeeming qualities although everyone keeps referring to him as a genius just because he can recite poetry and sort of paint.  He doesn't seem to have any real feelings for Emily Browning's character although at first you think there might be some kind of ""spark"" between them.  However, they act more neighbors who barely know one another throughout the entire movie.  She ends up marrying him even though she seems to hate him and I kept thinking, Why? Just because you told him you would marry him, doesn't mean you have to.  I mean, she is supposed to be this forward-thinking educated ""bohemian"" artist.  Her father hates him, so why go through with it if you hate him too? I think the premise of the story called for them to have a love/hate relationship - but there is absolutely no sexual or romantic chemistry between them AT ALL.

And Dan Stevens was good at playing the nice, sympathetic friend to Emily Browning's character, however, there is no chemistry between he and her either.  They are more like brother and sister. The description of the film says this is a ""tumultuous"" love triangle???? Huh.  I have seen more romantic heat in a cereal commercial.  The English Patient features a really ""Tumultuous"" love triangle.  This film features more of a watered-down version of a Louisa May Alcott short story.",1396569600,,2396,4.675417661097852

Do not proceed unless you want the plot spoiled.
Here goes...
I'm sorry, but this was a pathetic waste of my time. True story or not, it was just dumb.
The lead female character had 2 men competing for her affection. One loved her and was a fine young fellow who respected her. The other said he loved her, but he was unstable, self-centered and verbally abusive. Guess which one she chose to marry. Chose. Not forced. Chose. Right up to the wedding day, she was unhappy with her decision, but she CHOSE to marry him anyhow. On her wedding day, she asks him to do something important for her, he blows her off, so she gets up and goes and drinks some poison. She survives. She proceeds to deny herself physically to her CHOSEN husband and sleeps with the one she DIDN'T marry, This fellow then volunteers for some far away military assignment. She finds out she's pregnant, her husband calls her a whore, so she goes and drinks some more poison and kills herself and the baby. THE END.

Well acted. Fabulous cinematography. Sweeping musical score. Incredible setting. Lovely period costumes. Even the horses were gorgeous. Dan Stevens was magnificent and he did an amazing acting job.

Sadly, the script was tedious and no real bits of lasting happiness for the protagonists. The morsels of brief parts of joy were just marred by trying to stick to reality and basing this on the poor choices of real people of the upper class, who apparently had more money than good sense.",1395792000,3,533,5.114942528735632

The quintessential ""woman choosing the wrong man for her and then having a fling with the guy she ought to have picked in the first place"" story line.

5786856,3,B00DB43PLI,"Been there, done that, as they say. Boring and seen many times. Even the actors could not pull this film out of the doldrums and the music was not helpful.

The film brings us an artists' group in Cornwall, known as the Lamorna Group. Most of the group are painters, and this film takes place pre World War One. This is a true story about the artist A.J. Munnings, played by Dominic Cooper. Munnings was famous for his paintings of horses.  Munnings falls in love with a new young painter Florence Carter-Wood played by Emily Browning. Florence has feelings for an ex-army officer Gilbert Evans played by Dan Stevens. Fate intervenes and tragedy occurs but not before this film loses its audience. This is not a Jane Austen film, as one reviewer tried to relate. I am not sure what kind of film it is, but had difficulty getting through it. The film is still in theatres, but it is part of Amazon Prime, which shows us how badly this film has done. Not even Dan Stevens and his great good looks could save this film. A superb book I am told, but it did not transfer well to the film.

5786861,5,B00DB43PLI,"I chose the 5 rating based on the acting in this film. The story was another example of the immense, almost invisible
power, that women seem to hold over men, mostly due to the seemingly uncontrollable effect that male hormones
have on male creatures, animal and human. It was pretty obvious that playing with fire, in the form of a man of
violence, was a turn on for the woman who was the object of desire, for not only one, but three men. Personally, this
sort of story doesn't appeal to me, perhaps because it is far too realistic of similar incidents that can take place in
this emotionally charged world of human beings who have the powerful ability to reason, but who for one reason or
another, misuse and abuse that magnificent asset that sets us apart from the animal kingdom.",1395273600,,784,4.528169014084507

A bit of a strange slice of life in a small corner of the world.  The performances are solid, but the story jumps a bit between growth and seeing the changes in certain characters feels a bit stilted and forced (but that's more of an editorial or director issue not so much the actors performance).

Not all nudity is about sex, nor should a naked body be a shock, yes even to children. (Sex a whole nuther matter) And yes it does have a sad ending. It's a true story about a celebrated artist.

5786866,2,B00DB43PLI,"I've enjoyed seeing Dominic Cooper and Dan Stevens in other dramas, but, except for the scenery, this is a very weak film.  The narrative is hackneyed and predictable (young, vulnerable woman marries the wrong man, knows it before the wedding, but still goes through with it; has a love affair with the man she should have married, gets pregnant, and ""has"" to die to make things right).  Why?, you might ask.  Ask indeed, as many viewers must.  And why does our erstwhile hero (the lover, not the husband) decide to take a job in Nigeria just when his beloved is the most vulnerable to her impassioned, immature husband?

5786871,3,B00DB43PLI,"I have a degree in painting, so it was interesting to see this film; the art end of why someone paints, finds models, lives as cheaply as possible, etc., was true to life.  A.J.'s studio looked realistic, and the way he worked was true to life.  Perhaps people were disappointed with the fact that AJ horned in on Gilbert's budding romance.  This plot reminded me a LOT of Far From the Madding Crowd in which the female character, Bathsheba Everdene, falls for Frank, a man in a fancy uniform, marries him, and lives to regret it BIG TIME, while the steadfast shepherd, Gabriel Oak, who proposed to her early in the film, and whom she spurned as not good enough for her, watches the marriage of Bathsheba and Frank fall apart.  Gabriel eventually gets the girl, but in this film, the girl kills herself.  I think Dan made the film because he knew the author of the book.  And since it was a true story, unless they wanted to change the plot to create a happier ending, this is the plot they were stuck with.  There was no real way to make it anything but a character study of a painter who will stop at nothing to get what he wants, who doesn't really know how to love anyone or anything other than himself, and of a rather faithless, depressed girl who falls for him and marries him on a whim.  This also reminds me of Catherine in Wuthering Heights, spurning Heathcliff and marrying someone else, while Heathcliff self-destructs.  As to the nudity, painters paint nudes.  I would prefer to see a few nude bodies than gratuitous car crashes, murders, throat slittings, killings and destructive explosions.  THOSE are much more harmful to children.
Since it was not rated, parents have the responsibility of prescreening films before their children watch them.  Not everything is going to be as you expect.  And if you are a depressed person, avoid this film.",1395100800,67,1859,4.613981762917933

5786881,2,B00DB43PLI,"This film tells a true story that has great potential. Unfortunately, the horrid morals of even the best of the characters has left me questioning whether or not this is a story worth repeating. There was no warning of the full-frontal female nudity (three times), the male backside being flashed, nor the constant cussing done by 'AJ' (Dominic Cooper). (At least 3 F-bombs, and an S word here or there) I watched the film because of seeing Dan Stevens, Hattie Morahan, and Dominic Cooper in 'Sense and Sensibility', but this is a far cry from the alluring and beautiful world of Jane Austen. The attempted suicide wasn't enough - they had to add adultery, and spoil the better of the suitors. The only good side of the film was the minor characters Laura and her husband, for their devotion.
I personally don't find this film of any importance to watch again, nor would I recommend it to a friend. This film took an intriguing story that could have been told as a warning for those who commit adultery, yet I was left with the feeling that their actions were being condoned. The only reason why this film has been given two stars by me is because the acting was okay, and the scenery and art were very well done. The cinematography of this film was superb - but as long as the nudity, swearing, and condoning of adultery is contained I would not ever consider re-watching this.

For parents:
Be warned of the:
swearing (3 F-words and an assortment of S-words)
Adultery
Full frontal nudity (Two women were shown at three separate times bearing themselves to be painted, skinny dip, or just look at themselves in the mirror)
Back nudity (a man and a woman are seen skinny dipping in the ocean. Both backsides are seen clearly)
Attempted rape (A husband tries to force himself on his unwilling wife but trying to undo her dress buttons - nothing is seen, and she overpowers him)

Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,
 Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,

 Only this, and nothing more.'

to make love to each other in peace.
Everyone pries under your sheets,
everyone interferes with your loving.

all sorts of compunctions,
do something unique,

5786910,3,B00DB43PLI,"If you know the story, the film adds the visual dimension. Gorgeous to look at, but skimpy on characterization and dialogue, it lacks the subtle, nuanced storytelling of the book. Instead the author sexes up the script to play to a wider audience, and gives some minor characters such as Knightie a larger presence - not a problem -  in the film. But the omission of the opening scenes of the book limits the storytelling focus, and handily eliminates the need for flashback and aging of the principal actors.

Many of the lines are lost in other sounds or mumbled, yet the overall acting is very good. Dominic Cooper makes a splendidly raffish young Munnings and Dan Stevens a believable melancholy Gilbert Evans. Munnings' paintings from the period of the story are quite possibly his best, and we didn't see the best of them. The ""recreated"" Morning Ride portrait of Florence showed the much shorter actress, Emily Browning, and showed a very poorly painted shoulder and upper sleeve of her jacket - FOR SHAME. While other real Munnings paintings of Florence show her to be tall and aristocratic in her bearing, Emily Browning was right in height for Cooper (the real Munnings was taller), and her interpretation of the character was believeable as someone who was barely fledged and unable to handle what she wanted (a famous artist husband) and what she chose (a voracious consumer of life, warts and all).

Cornwall is the real star of this picture - the powerful sea and storms underscore the drama of lives played out there. The musical score is lovely and perfect. And, finally, to see this story dramatized in the real location and many buildings in which it took place is just great.

Read the book, it you've seen the film. If you've read the book, give the film a go bearing in mind that the picture in your mind's eye and ear may be challenged.",1394150400,,1858,4.707692307692308

I thought at first that she was going to be a strong independent woman -  she did leave home to go against her father's wishes to study to be an artist.  But once she does, she doesn't seem to have any confidence in her artistic abilities then she somehow mistakes the obvious drunken antics and lust of the revered resident artist for ""love"".  She recognizes her mistake before her wedding day even ends & then makes another dumb choice to escape from it.

I don't know if her character was written this way in the book because I didn't read it but I did not like her very much.  She was beautiful to look at sitting on top of that horse surrounded by all that greenery in that gorgeous light but if I'd known how this was going to end & if I'd been there I would've been tempted to push her off that horse & trample her with it.

The movie, based on the book written by Dan's English teacher at Tonbridge School, is very dull with a very thin plot.  The storyline is depressing and not interesting at all.  There simply isn't very much material here to make a movie about this very weak love triangle.  We never know why Alfred and Gilbert are even friends.  SPOILERS: Why was Florence so depressed?

Instead it just ended abruptly without really showing the impact of the events on the characters.

I absolutely adored this movie... I generally don't enjoy light, fluffy,romantic movies (anything close to a Nicolas Sparks in nature), but this was delightful. This a wonderful romantic tragedy that is well acted, and true to the time period. The characters are amazing, and Dan Stevens' role is perfection.

I will say that if nudity bothers you on any level, there are 3 scenes that can be skipped without taking away from the plot... keep in mind this is an artistic community, with female models being painted, so there are scenes with full frontal nudity. Think that one scene from Titanic with Kate Winslet... you know which one I'm talking about. Even so, the story is beautiful, and this movie is worth owning.
