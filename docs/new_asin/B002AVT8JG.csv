8360432,5,B002AVT8JG,"Wonderful, if somewhat tongue-in-cheek version of the Sardou play that Puccini turned into one of the most popular operas ever written.  Tosca is a hard-headed, soft-hearted realist, Cavaradossi is a commanding, sympathetic, and VERY sexy revolutionary, and Scarpia ... well,
Scarpia is a swine.",1425600000,,295,5.704545454545454
8360433,5,B002AVT8JG,"No this isn't Puccini's masterpiece Tosca. It's Victorien Sardou's play on which the opera is based as a 1973 Italian movie. The costumes, sets, etc. are sumptuous and appropriate for Rome in 1800. There are no subtitles and it requires a region free player. There is an enhanced presence for Cesae Angelotti, the Italian royalty, and The Church. There is a little music and singing but nothing you'll remember 5 minutes later. Thoroughly enjoyed it. One of the problems with the opera is the woman singing the title role usually just isn't attractive enough to be credible as an object of desire. No problem here. The actress playing Tosca, Monica Vitti, was born in 1931 which would have made her 42 when this was filmed. Even at that age she was an astonishingly beautiful woman capable of generating torrents of lust in any male from 9 to 90. Nowadays you can get a region free, 3D, Blu-Ray DVD player for less than $ 100 bucks. Go for it. So I'm giving 2 stars for the play, 2 stars for the costumes and sets, and the Hercules Super Cluster for Monica Vitti.",1400976000,2,1063,4.570680628272251
