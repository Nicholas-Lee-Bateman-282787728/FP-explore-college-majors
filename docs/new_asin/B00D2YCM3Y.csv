5769768,5,B00D2YCM3Y,I loved it. It was everything that I expected out of this movie. If indie horror is your cup of tea then look here.,1385769600,,115,3.8333333333333335
5769769,2,B00D2YCM3Y,This movie should be a $1.99.  There were six people running around and no acting to speak of.  I did not watch the movie again. lI thought The first scene was the only action I found interesting.  The end scene was maybe close to good but it ended leaving you hanging,1385337600,,268,4.215686274509804
5769770,2,B00D2YCM3Y,"Students sign up for a military lab experiment that goes horribly wrong. Some scary stuff in here, then all was lost in the running around, trying to find an escape, and trying to escape the creatures that the experiment created. I got bored.",1385337600,2,242,4.651162790697675
5769771,3,B00D2YCM3Y,"Although a bit campy, and the attempt that was made to inject some silly anti government points in to the mix towards the end was kind of stupid, as a whole, the flick is worth a watch if you like semi bloody violence. The acting was fairly good, and the effects were pretty good. Definitely low budget stuff though. Not that there is anything wrong with that.",1382400000,2,360,4.388059701492537
5769772,2,B00D2YCM3Y,"This story centers around Lacie Donovan (Tuckie White) a college student who could use some money. In her ethics class they discuss ""the greater good"" as a theme for the film. (Note: Most film class discussions relate to the theme.) She signs up for a military experiment to earn some cash during break, along with 7 other students. They are told they will be given an experimental anti-anxiety drug with some minor side effects.

40 minutes into the film things start to happen as the military lied.

The characters were decent. There was a quick and effective build-up while they sat around a table. The opening scene with a slow motion bullet and blood splatter made for a promising film that never reached its potential. Once the film got going, I got bored with bloody people running around the halls screaming, hiding, and chasing each other.

There are better ""I signed up for an experiment"" films out there.

5769773,2,B00D2YCM3Y,"This movie is slow.  The plot and dialog are poor.  The acting is sad.  I would like to be able to say something good about this, but there isn't anything I can offer.  I would like to go into more detail, but its really not worth my time or yours. Rent Cabin in the woods instead. That's a fun ride.",1381363200,3,300,3.95
5769774,4,B00D2YCM3Y,Really good movie with good acting and good special effects. Besides you can't really go wrong with a zombie movie now can you?,1381363200,4,127,4.565217391304348
5769775,4,B00D2YCM3Y,Saw this at a screening last year really scary film! Production quality is strong always love a good film with zombies,1379462400,5,118,4.666666666666667
5769786,3,B00D2YCM3Y,"Well, I watched it twice so it was at least a 3 and half stars movie. Now, I'm all for a zombie film and it has plenty of potential the end indicates that it will probably be a sequel part 2, so watch out for that. The move centers 8 people looking to make some extra cash ,by being a human science study. They each had there own reasons on why they chose to be a part of this study, however, the government is trying to create a bio weapon for the president that has at least fail twice already.  Long story short , they are looking for other participants as the story ends that's how we can conclude it will be a part 2. Hope this helps!",1404950400,3,639,3.9921875
5769787,5,B00D2YCM3Y,"This one is very canny. Could be anything the way it starts out. A group of young adults all eager to earn an easy thousand bucks sign up for an experiment held by...um...who is it exactly? An academic organization? Medical? The government? Well, we'll all know more by the end, but on the way our minds will be blown by some mind-bogglingly frightening scenarios. This one deserves a lot of recognition!",1402790400,,404,4.704225352112676
5769788,3,B00D2YCM3Y,"This wasn't a bad movie, it was more or less an ok film about a government test that turns college students into ""Rage Virus"" type zombies.
I bought it for my vast collection of Zombie DVD's, and wasn't disappointed.
It is a good movie, there are a few ""Zombie"" moments in it, but not too many or much.
It is a good dvd to have in your collection if you're an avid Zombie Genre collector.
If you buy it you will like it, but loving it will be something different.",1402704000,2,463,4.155555555555556
5769789,4,B00D2YCM3Y,"As usual, I didn't expect much going in, and so that definitely helped the experience. The pace was good and kept me engaged in what was going to happen next. It didn't drag at all. The acting was competent. The production values fine. I liked the story, which I won't spoil, as half the fun was figuring out what was up. The blockhead military guy was a nice touch. Good comedic value there. I liked the ending, unsentimental, as I prefer my horror. I rented this at the end of the night, getting ready for bed and it was perfect for that time slot. Worth a watch for the junkie looking for a fix in these dry times.",1396915200,,617,4.237288135593221
5769790,2,B00D2YCM3Y,"I was into the movie enough to watch it until the end. It could have been so much better. I love independent films, but I didn't become endeared to any of the characters, so I couldn't care what happened to any of them. Better camerawork and direction could have improved the experience. The actors were ok, but when so much is wrong, it no longer matters what's right. There's plenty of gore, but since I'm not into lots of that, the film fell short for me. The storyline was solid but not executed well. I wouldn't recommend it. It's like a long ride to the doctor.",1395360000,,567,4.3584905660377355
5769791,5,B00D2YCM3Y,Well produced movie with a little twist and turns at the end. The actors were believable in their roles. I recommend others to purchase.,1394928000,,136,4.708333333333333
5769792,3,B00D2YCM3Y,"This movie was okay.  It took me a few times watching it to really grasp what was happening.  Overall not a bad movie, just out there a little bit for me.",1392163200,,154,3.935483870967742
5769793,3,B00D2YCM3Y,"This movie plays on the urban legend once used in Stephen King's Firestarter of a government-run paid experiment where evil was done.  It's not terrible, but definitely save it for a night when you're in the mood for a schlockfest.",1391126400,,231,4.775
5769794,4,B00D2YCM3Y,I thought the movie was good entertainment. The movie was fast paced and kept my interest. The length is perfect for a late night flick before hitting the sack.,1389916800,,160,4.551724137931035
5769795,5,B00D2YCM3Y,"The woman in the first chase scene is awesome!  Stunt work was great - well done, good zombies.  Loved it.",1386892800,,106,4.25
8588800,4,B00D2YCM3Y,A whole lot better than I thought it would be. I enjoyed watching it. May watch it again down the road.,1474761600,,103,3.9523809523809526
8588801,3,B00D2YCM3Y,Not very impressive.,1467158400,,20,6.0
8588802,1,B00D2YCM3Y,"Stay away!!!  So, so bad",1466380800,,24,3.8
8588803,2,B00D2YCM3Y,No to good,1461024000,,10,2.6666666666666665
8588804,4,B00D2YCM3Y,I liked this one! I think what makes it stand out (spoilers ahead) is that the gas doesn't quite transform the exposed into zombies so much as mindless killing machines. I also like that it doesn't transform everyone in exactly the same way. Not bad at all!,1459468800,,257,4.48936170212766
8588805,2,B00D2YCM3Y,Did not like.,1455580800,,13,3.6666666666666665

8588808,2,B00D2YCM3Y,Do not waste your time.,1421193600,,23,3.8
8588809,1,B00D2YCM3Y,"Dull, predictable, uninspired. Lacking any significant plot twist that hasn't been done before. I'm sorry but after reading the description i had much higher hopes. My friend that does nothing but (special word here) games would probably enjoy it a tad though. I'm sorry but even the movie's thumbnail looked more exciting. Please let me know if you find something better. Thanks for trying.",1408060800,,391,5.125
