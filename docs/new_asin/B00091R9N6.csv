8492784,3,B00091R9N6,"This really should be titled ""Official AMERICAN Battlefield Films of WWI."" This is mostly film shot by USN and USA cameramen arranged into a narrative for an audience that already knew the official story: German submarine warfare, brave allies with their backs to the wall, the US throws itself into war material production and building an army of eager civilians, then the Yanks come to Europe in droves to save the day.

Without knowing the context of these films, the viewer would have no idea that most of the war had been a static bloodbath. There is almost no trench footage, but a great deal of artillery batteries firing and the puffs of shelling landing in the distance (as well as a town being shelled while the camera is in it). We see several shots of US troops moving in mass across fields, and tanks in action. There is even a scene in which a British raiding party returns walking over open ground in the day time.

The strength of this film is the seeing through contemporary eyes (with contemporary sensibilities). Many titles are decorated with the work of  Abian ""Wally"" Wallgren, a Marine who drew cartoons for ""Stars and Stripes"" that are light years away from Mauldin's Willie and Joe.  The film makes of the experience a great adventure that seems more suited to 1914 than post war, reflecting the limits of American experience. Americans did see some heavy action, but one can argue that the Great War was already coming to its end by the time US troops arrived.

There are no extras here. No menu, no booklet, nothing but a DVD in a naked jewel case. It uses TV rather than film ratio, and the `score' is a sort of light classical/easy listening/light jazz hodgepodge that is wildly wrong for the period--but I have had to sit through worse sound tracks slapped on silent films. At least there are no faked in sound effects. (And, no it is NOT listed in IMDb.)

For the general viewer this is probably not the best place to start. Those with a particular interest in WW I will find this a facinating contemporary document, and worth the price.",1158192000,2,2068,4.62125340599455
