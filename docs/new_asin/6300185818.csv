I laughed my butt off!!!! THAT'S the copy I wish to purchase--the MST3K brand lollololol",1351209600,,291,4.615384615384615
7804494,2,6300185818,"And it still isn't as good as the MST3K version. Anyway, as someone else noted it's not the same cut that MST3K has. Abby isn't seen in flashback in the 2nd half, Buffalo Bill's song at the Pit Stop is cut out and there's a whole backstory to Sam's invisibility at the beginning. But there is more of ""the elusive Robert Denby"". My guess is MST3K was a cut for TV (where you have to clear time for commercials and clarify things quickly) and the commercial release may have been a cut for foreign markets to introduce the show or pass it off as an actual theatrical production.",1163721600,,577,4.351851851851852
7804495,3,6300185818,"When you watch this film, take it for what it is worth and realize that at the time of its production a lot of campy pictures were made and some much worse than this. You have to be a big admirer of Ben Murphy's (and I am) and a child of a certain era to appreciate a government agent with the power to disappear who looks like he would be equally at home on the cover of G.Q. The friendship ol' ""Buffalo"" and ""Lazy Rider""(Ben Murphy) develop is fun to watch. When Buffalo is about to save Lazy Rider as his truck is a runaway, he informes Lazy Rider that he is carrying a cargo of eggs. Lazy Rider, approaching Buffalo's back door at 67 miles an hour and about ready to make contact says, ""I sure hope you like 'em scrambled."" Ben Murphy sure knows how to deliver a line!",1050192000,4,772,4.119205298013245
7804496,4,6300185818,"Maybe it's because I'm a Ben Murphy fan that I actually enjoyed this movie. OK, it wasn't brilliant but if you just sit down and allow yourself to relax I think you'll find it enjoyable.
I don't think it was meant to be a masterpiece but in this day and age of sex and violence in movies, it's nice to see a bit of wholesome fun.",1014854400,2,329,4.0
7804497,1,6300185818,"The really bad thing about this film is a surprise.  It's not the acting, though that's atrocious.  It isn't the writing, even though that is worse than the acting.  No, it's that the cover of the video displays a ""crashing plane.""  There isn't a plane in the entire mess - let alone a crashing one!  Sure, there's a semi, a race car, and a helicopter (it doesn't crash, either).  Where's the crashing plane?  They make it look like ""Riding WIth Death"" is one of those airport disaster films by the cover, but it's worse - Ben Murphy in a couple of episodes of a failed 70s tv show!
Perhaps the crashing plane on the cover refers to the movie in a more metaphorical way.  Films have been called train wrecks before, too.",1000080000,3,720,4.401515151515151
7804498,5,6300185818,The story line and acting alone make this film Oscar worthy.  Ben Murphy IS the man!  Riding with death is a must see film!  This action packed secret agent movie will blow your mind!  One of the best 70's movies EVER!,991353600,5,218,4.2439024390243905
7804499,1,6300185818,"I watched this movie on Mst3k. Great job guys! This film is consisting with 2 plots that don't fit well together. And,how about that redneck driver Buffalo?Oh my,what an actor""Yu better get on that there road before you get the handbar off my musclaps.""EUU!Funny Mst3k episode. Horrid Film.",980121600,,290,5.0625
