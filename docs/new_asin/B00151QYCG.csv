8257036,5,B00151QYCG,"I'm proud of the man Jeff is.  I feel as though I've KNOWN him since the ""Rainbow Warrior"" days.  My collection of 1:24 scale cars is at 10 & I have A 1:64.  Oh!  I have the teddy bear Christmas tree ornament, the 3 Daytona coin, t-shirts, jersey for Dupont but I have no where to store stuff any more.  So, Jeff, WHEN you win YOUR 5th Championship, I'll get THAT shirt.... I know Jeff's probably not reading this BUT, I can HOPE....  :>)

Nice job on the DVD.  <3",1307232000,,464,4.0777777777777775
8257037,4,B00151QYCG,This is a collection of interviews and features with some actual race excerpts. I think over 4 hours in all. Nice collection but the quality of the video is whatever it was at the time - going back to the 1990's. Recommended for any Jeff Gordon fan,1236816000,4,248,4.297872340425532
