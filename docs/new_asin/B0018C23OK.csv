3414908,1,B0018C23OK,"I thought that the man who played Batman when everyone thought he'd bomb in the role would be better than this.  But in this film, Michael Keaton gives us what can best be described as his attempt at an impression of Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector.  Unfortunately, Mr. Keaton fails dramatically at this and the movie, which was teetering on the edge of this fate, falls over and becomes nothing more than a action/slasher movie...""psychological thriller"" is a term too good to use here.  Apart from a supremely underwhelming performance from a man playing a supposedly dangerous, unrelenting, and remorseless killer, this film was above and beyond in terms of plot holes and overused clichs.  Seriously, is every unstoppable serial killer a super-genius?  There was really no other possible donor?  This film just played out convenient plot points and clichs to try and make its plot work.  Well, it fails dramatically.  If you want to watch this film, you can go right ahead and do so...see what desperate measures the filmmakers went to make this plot and its plot holes work.  I do wonder if, like NASA did with Armageddon, doctors are called upon to spot the mistakes in this film.  Should be easy enough.  Enjoy.",1402444800,,1221,4.878640776699029

3414910,2,B0018C23OK,"This film was on ""free"" TV tonight, so I decided to watch it.  I believe that I saw it once before, right after it first released back in 1998; you'd think that I would have learned my lesson the first time.

What. . . a. . . crock.  And that crock ain't full of butter.  This has to be one of the most contrived scenarios ever in film.  What?  You've got a cop named Frank -- Andy Garcia -- who has a son Matt -- Joseph Cross -- where that son needs a bone marrow transplant, and the only person in the whole wide world is a psychopathic killer -- Michael Keaton -- who's a match.  Sure.  So we know that both the psycho and the son will have surgery, and you know things will go terribly wrong, and you know that Mr. Keaton's gonna go all Silence-of-the-Lambs (SOTL) all over everybody.  ""Clarice, and what did you think about while watching this film?  How b-a-a-a-a-d it was?  Perhaps you should have slaughtered it yourself and saved everyone the misery.""  Har har.

Talking about SOTL. . . .  Obviously, the writer and director ""borrowed"" from that far superior film here, what with some of the stupid stuff with the Keaton character being a Hannibal Lecter-like dude.  But really, if you're going to ""borrow"" something, why don't you take the best parts while borrowing, not the worst parts?  I was laughing out loud in a couple of scenes where I was supposed to be hiding under a blanket, I think.

Well, I think that 1998 was about the same time where Mr. Keaton -- who was in some really funny movies way back when, remember?  Like ""Night Shift"" and the whole ""let's feed mayonnaise to the tuna fish!"" line? -- and his career decided to take a swan dive.  And this film does a horrible belly flop of its own, right into the tank.

If a doctor came to me and said, ""You need a bone marrow transplant to save your life, but to get that transplant, you'll have to watch 'Desperate Measures' first.""  I think I'd respond, ""Get me my lawyer.  I need to write my last will and testament.  And quick.""",1398902400,,2004,4.342318059299191

3414918,3,B0018C23OK,"I missed the first 10 minutes of this so I don't know how Michael Keaton's character, an incarcerated murderer, ever got on the bone marrow donor registry. Maybe they test everyone in prison, who knows. But he's the match for Andy Garcia's son, who without this transplant, will die. Also, as the boy points out, he might die even if he gets it.

Unfortunately Peter McCabe (Keaton) is a sociopath which should surprise no one. Frank Conner (Garcia) is a police officer promising him anything to get his marrow.

McCabe is a tricky planner who can outsmart almost anyone and is determined to get free (but he doesn't plan too far ahead).  But Conner is more determined to save his son.

Conner steals a police car to chase McCabe. In what would have killed about 30 people and caused about 100 wrecks, everyone and every car is totally unscathed. There are some very close calls though. In a way, it's exciting, but so unrealistic it distracted me.

The ending was a joke, which did not fit in with the rest of the movie.

Michael Keaton is almost mesmerizing in his role as the sick killer. There is some decent action in here, too, but suspense is the name of this game. Once you've started in, it's very difficult to put down. Andy Garcia and Marcia Gay Hayden turn in solid performances as well.

It was nice to see a tough-but-loving father (Garcia) go to any lengths to save his kid.

3414923,4,B0018C23OK,"A good film indeed but it does not compare to any Seven or Silence of the Lambs. It has punch, rhythm, inventiveness, creativity even. It has some good dramatic stuff with a kid who is going to die of leukemia as the main stake. It has the antagonistic situation needed for a good film with the only donor being the serial killer who is going to try anything he can to escape. A criminal donor for the son of a cop. We avoid the easy tear forcing unreal situations like when the child is confronted to the escaping criminal who had taken him hostage, but we are not far from it with a child of 9 slightly too mature for his breeches. The female doctor, or rather surgeon is quite valiant and faces danger with elegance and courage. But in spite of all it is nothing but an adventure film more than a thriller because we know the transplant will take place, hence we know the end and we also know that the killer is going to try to escape again and the last scene is outrageously amateurish on the side of the security forces. Well done, good rhythm, good suspense but not more than  good, a few creative ideas but nothing really poignant with pathos at any moment.

3414924,5,B0018C23OK,"Finally, a movie that helps explain why I'm so unusually nice to homicidal maniacs - one man's homicidal maniac might be another man's son's bone marrow donor. Happens all the time!",1175212800,,181,4.870967741935484
3414925,2,B0018C23OK,"I'm wondering when it became a federal crime to have a PLOT in a movie anymore. The writers of ""Desperate Measures"" apparently thought an interesting and coherent storyline would get them a seat in the death house because they avoided anything even remotely connected to reality in this movie.

First, there's the eminently annoying Andy Garcia. His usual tics are in full bloom - this guy has more twitches than Clint Eastwood on speed. His son needs a bone marrow transplant, and the only human being on the entire earth who is a match is psycho killer Michael Keaton.

The movie is about how Garcia tries to keep the nutcase alive after he torches the hospital personnel and shoots all the cops in his escape attempt. The boy who plays the son is adorable; one of the few kids who actually ACTS like a kid. And Michael Keaton really has a knack for psycho parts (although I still miss his ""Batman"" hero performances.) Both Keaton and the kid are the only reason it even merits two stars.

But it's the idea that no matter what this guy does, who he kills, he MUST live so Garcia's kid can get a transplant. After one of the many slaughter scenes in the movie, the police captain says to Garcia, ""How many cops have to die so your son can live?""

Good freaking question!",1155686400,,1272,4.4935064935064934
3414926,5,B0018C23OK,"Michael Keaton puts in another excellent turn as a bad guy.  This time he's a multi-murdering felon in a maximum security prison.

Overall, this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat to the very end.  I agree that the plot is a bit unbelievable, but why should movies be believable anyway.  Aren't movies supposed to transport you to another place where reality is temporarily suspended.

3414927,3,B0018C23OK,"Admittedly preposterous and implausible, DESPERATE MEASURES is nonetheless a tidy and engaging thriller.  Director Barbet Schroeder eschews his usual heavy handed drama for this action thriller in which Michael Keaton plays a very vile criminal who happens to be the only donor available for the dying child of cop Andy Garcia.  Brian Cox is underused in his role as Garcia's boss, and Marcia Gay Harden has done better than this role as the persistent doctor.  Garcia's performance is dedicated, and Joseph Cross as the young boy is charmingly effective.  Keaton, however, seems to be playing his role as a comic character instead of the outlandishly evil man he is.  The ending is one that will probably irritate you, it did me, but overall the movie does what it was probably supposed to do.",1129852800,,794,4.93984962406015
3414928,4,B0018C23OK,"Michael Keaton does a great job of acting in this role. He plays an intelligent psychotic killer. By far one of his best performances. I could actually believe him as a sociopath. Andy Garcia delivers a good performance as a father who will stop at nothing to save his sons life. But his acting does not come up to the same standard as Mr. Keaton's in this movie.

The movie is about a father who is trying to save his son's life. His son is dying of cancer and needs a bone marrow transplant. But we learn at the begining of the movie that there are no donor's that match. Garcia, as a police officer, and the boys father illegally breaks into the FBI's computer in order to use their resoures to find a compatible donor. And he does, in the form of an inmate played by Keaton.

Keaton's character has the right blood type to give the boy the required bone marrow. He finally agrees to help the boy. We see him prepare for what he hopes will be his escape to freedom from the hospital. Will he escape or decide to take his one chance at redemption by helping this boy. And if this would have been played out as a story of redemption, it would have easily gotten a five star rating.

But it seems a suspense thriller was wanted instead of a great drama. So Keaton escapes. And we have the time critical chase. The police just want him caught dead or alive. Of course Garcia's character needs him alive, in order to save his boy. Would any of this happen in real life....no chance. But it does make for a fast pace thriller. You will be caught up in the great direction and wounderful cinematography. This film has been underrated and does deserve to be viewed. I found it entertaining.",1118793600,,1685,4.3428571428571425

When Garcia as a police officer finds that inmate Keaton has the right blood type to give his son bone marrow, the plot thickens.

3414931,4,B0018C23OK,"Were it not for the use of the ""F"" word, a number of times, and a few violent scenes, like showing a closeup of a needle being injected into a person, I would class this as a very enjoyable family film (for mature children over 12).  It was probably classed as ""Restricted"" because of some scenes where the criminal threatens the child.

I watched this film on TV with my 11-year-old daughter, and we both really enjoyed it.  I thought the actors' performances were fantastic.  The reason my daughter enjoyed the film was because it was about a child's situation.  I had to explain a few details to her, as we watched, but she was caught up in the story of the child who needed a bone-marrow transplant, and all that happened leading up to it. Andy Garcia plays a very loving father, who will do ANYTHING to help his son, thus overshawding the violence in the film.  This is not a film kids under 15 should watch by themselves, but with parents, it would be quite OK.

Michael Keaton turns in a really masterful performance as a serial murderer with a super-high IQ, who manages to turn his supposed aquiescene to the bone-marrow donation into a masterful escape plan.  The whole movie is a super piece of suspense.  It kept both my daughter and myself on the edge of our seats.

3414934,4,B0018C23OK,"It's easy to see why DESPERATE MEASURES got bad reviews.  The plot might have holes large enough to sail a barge through, and yes, it is quite implausable, but it's hard to completely diss a movie with performances and direction as good as this.
Michael Keaton is eerily menacing as Peter McCabe in this film.  He's smart, dangerous, and unpredictable, just like the character requires.  Keaton easily does his best work yet as a serious actor.  Andy Garcia proves once again that THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD was not a fluke, and that he really is capable of turning in one fine performance after another.  While a couple of the supporting performances aren't up to the level they should be, it doesn't pull down the film.
The direction by Barbet Schroeder is brilliant.  THe noir style that the film was shot in works extremely well for the type of film this is.  His odd camera angles and dark, brooding shots work perfectly with the dark story.  The look of the smoke and fire is perfectly shot, and he should commend his cinematographer.
The suspense, however, is what keeps this film kicking.  Even though the lack plot tends to drag down a little bit of the film, it's still a guessing game most of the time, and Schroeder knows how to play this up.  It's a shame that critics like Leonard Maltin couldn't look past the implausability at the truly excellent moments of the film.  After all, they give truly implausable movies like CON AIR good reviews, and this film is FAR more realistic.
DESPERATE MEASURES is a greatly underrated film that deserves a look.  It's decently smart and a hell of a lot more entertaining than a lot of the drivel that Hollywood produces nowadays. *cough, Pearl Harbor, cough*",1006387200,,1724,4.672185430463577

3414936,3,B0018C23OK,"Desperate Measures (Barbet Schroeder, 1998)

I'm never sure whether I'm going to like a Barbet Schroeder flick when I sit down to watch it. Half the time he pulls off amazing feats of grace under pressure (Barfly, Reversal of Fortune), and the other half of the time he crafts enjoyable if mindless fluff that stands one viewing well, two viewings passably, and pales by the third (Single White Female, Kiss of Death). Five minutes into Desperate Measures, I was convinced it was the latter; a day after watching it, I'm still not convinced it's the former, but I'm farther along the road than I was at that point.

Peter McCabe (Michael Keaton) is a highly intelligent psychopath, a less likable Hannibal Lecter, whose bone marrow happens to be a match for the dying son of Frank Conner (Andy Garcia). All Conner has to do is convince McCabe to be a donor to save his son, and keep McCabe from escaping somewhere between going out of his cell and going back into his cell. Needless to say, that doesn't work, or it would be a very, very short film.

Much of the movie's appeal rests solely on the head of Andy Garcia, one of the best actors in Hollywood right now, and one of the most underrated as well. He's not as engaging here as he is in his best roles (Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead, Black Rain, Dead Again, etc.), but his acting ability is enough to make the film watchable. Keaton seems constricted by his role, but one gets the impression that has more to do with the director than the actor himself. A number of decent minor roles also show up in the film (Marcia Gay Harden is especially pleasing as the doctor slated to perform the operation, who gets caught up in the whole mess).

If plot's more important to you than acting, however, don't bother with this one. Each ""twist"" can be seen coming a mile off, and if the ending doesn't make you want to seek Schroeder out and smack him personally, I'll eat my review. Perhaps the most predictable thing I've seen in the past five years. Oh, well, you can't have everything. ** 1/2",982540800,,2052,4.478609625668449

I will admit that Michael Keaton played his character well, however, the plot of the movie was thin at best. All I can say is that buyer beware. If you like Micheal Keaton - then get it.

The cast is suburb leaving you on the edge of your seat. Loaded with action and suspense. Quality acting on Michael Keaton and Andy Garcia. Give it shot you won't be disappointed.",1479686400,,320,4.262295081967213

8269333,2,B0018C23OK,"The two stars is for the acting--Keaton is very good as a psychotic killer, Garcia good but burdened by a totally unbelievable role.  The plot is reprehensible.  Garcia's character is the father of a 9 year son that has terminal leukaemia and needs a bone marrow transfusion from psycho killer Keaton.  It seems this kid's life is quite valuable, as untold deaths litter the landscape in Garcia's mad dash to get Keaton to help his son.  If you enjoy plots that have absolutely no connection to believability, that fall well outside the realm of even the remotest possibility, then this is your  movie!",1454371200,,602,4.805825242718447
