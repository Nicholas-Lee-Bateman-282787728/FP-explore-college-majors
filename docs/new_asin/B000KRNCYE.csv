8158899,5,B000KRNCYE,"This was truly an awsome concert that brought back so many memories. I saw Papa Doo Run Run a bunch of times in the late 70's and they were always great live. No disrespect to the Beach Boys but Papa Doo Run Run are so much better live. They did the soundtrack to ""Dead Mans Curve"" a tv movie about Jan & Dean, I wish they would release it on DVD, it was an awsome movie. Anyway, I highly recommend this concert.",1214438400,5,412,4.036585365853658
