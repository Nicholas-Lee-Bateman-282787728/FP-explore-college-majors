6029912,5,B00FRIMJG8,"Splendid production, superb performances, both musicians and actors... Excellent bonus!!! I strongly recomend to see and hear it in a big display with a nice sound equipment. I did not like that it lasted such a few seasons.",1393545600,6,224,4.921052631578948
6029913,5,B00FRIMJG8,"Treme is the best TV series I've ever seen. The settings, in all their honesty and lack of sugar-coating, of course run like a thread through the episodes. But so does the music (paramount for a lifelong professional musician like myself), and the gut-level humanity of the characters. We really CARED about what happened to each person, as well as the whole blessed city. I confess to being a huge NO lover, and hope to witness a Mardi Gras for myself before I'm too old to enjoy it (if ever...). Treme is the closest I've gotten yet to really experiencing and understanding a city I could visit again and again, and will. By the way, in my opinion the producers did a really good job winding up the complex story with the truncated final season they were stuck with. All in all, a class act all around.",1393372800,17,804,4.476190476190476

6029915,5,B00FRIMJG8,"Tremendous is my favorite series.......... It is indeed sad to read about low ratings when this show and the music rules running thru it as well as the honesty of the historical defences blew me away. It is indeed sad that they could not still be in production to see Mayor Nagon found guilty of corruption during and after ""Katrina!""  I am still working my way through the series and will cry when it ends - the music alone makes this series remarkable and yet it seems that what is pushed and promoted are series so dark that I cannot watch them for long.  Sad to see Treme come to an end!",1392595200,5,591,4.267857142857143
6029916,5,B00FRIMJG8,"Treme debuted to modest ratings and kept losing viewers as it progressed. Most networks probably would have canceled it after the first season, but HBO stuck with it as long as they did simply because A) they could afford it, given the ratings success of blockbuster shows like True Blood and B) they had a great deal of respect for the show itself and were proud to have it as part of their lineup. Even so, by the end the ratings were so low that HBO decided to cut the final season in half, giving Simon only five episodes instead of the usual ten or twelve to bring things to a close.

It's easy to understand Simon's point-of-viewwhat good is universal adulation if it mostly comes after your show has already been yanked off the air?but it's arguable that his work is easier to appreciate once it's completed. More than any other showrunner, Simon has a tendency to craft episodes that feel less like self-contained stories and more like chapters of a novel (even moreso than Game of Thrones, which adopts a very similar approach). It must have been a neat experience to read Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities in weekly installments when it was first being published, but surely reading the complete novel from start to finish in a more condensed period of time ultimately proved a more satisfying way to digest that story? So it was with The Wire, and so it is with Treme.

In fact, Simon and co-creator Eric Overmeyer turned Treme into an even more open-ended showit begins after the drama has started and concludes before it's finished, which is only natural given that the story of post-Katrina New Orleans and its residents is one that is still unfolding to this day. Life tends to avoid wrapping everything up in a tidy bow, and while the series finale does indeed carry a certain weight of finality, it's hard to escape the sense that these characters will experience many more ups and downs that we'll never get to seeand honestly, that's a good thing. It's a virtue that only adds to the feeling that this show permitted us to live in New Orleans for a few years, to experience its overwhelming pleasures and its heartbreaking realities. For all of its plot strands about corrupt cops, useless government officials, greedy capitalists and broken dreams, the series really is a love letter to the people of New Orleans and the culture they so enthusiastically preserve. For this viewer, it's impossible to watch a few episodes of the series and not feel a great urgency to spend some time immersed in that beautiful mess of a city as soon as possible.

The show isn't flawless. Simon has a tendency to turn just a bit too preachy every now and then (from the overcooked John Goodman political rants of the first season to the contrived auto-tune bashing during the series finale). A host of musicians, chefs and other real-life individuals are frequently called upon to play themselves, and some of these folks are better actors than others. Every now and then, a character will get trapped in a subplot that just feels too conventional (Sonny's drug drama in the first season) or too disconnected from the rest of the show (Kim Dickens' assorted culinary adventures in New York), though it's worth noting that in almost all of these cases the plots feel a bit more satisfying when viewed in the larger context of the series.

So no, the series isn't quite The Wire 2: New Orleans in terms of quality (it became obvious fairly quickly that it wasn't going to be the same thing in terms of subject matter), but it's nonetheless one of the most valuable and underappreciated shows of the past few years. It seems unlikely the series will ever gain the sizable audience The Wire has in the years since its cancellation, because Treme doesn't offer the sort of addictive drama that might inspire countless binge-watching sessions. You have to take the series at its own pace, adapt to its languorous rhythms and learn to roll with its occasionally passive-aggressive attitude (an element that turned off many viewers early on, but a crucial piece of its authenticity).

When you do manage to get on the show's wavelength (and you almost certainly will, as long as you're attentive and patient), you'll be treated to a host of remarkable virtues: incredible music, skillful long-form plotting, delightfully naturalistic dialogue and one of the best ensemble casts on television. I could offer individual superlatives to each of the actors, but let it simply be said that almost all of the major players truly inhabit the characters they've been asked to essay. Okay, and let it be said one more time that Wendell Pierce's Antoine always has been and always will be my favorite charactera good-natured yet flawed man who is similar to and yet entirely different from The Wire's Bunk.

If you've been purchasing the individual seasons on Blu-ray as they've been released, Treme: The Complete Series (Blu-ray) doesn't have a whole lot to offer. Each season is given its own simple, sturdy Blu-ray (they're much slimmer than the individual releases, which is a good thing for those who value shelf space) housed within a simple, sturdy cardboard box. Nothing has been altered in terms of the audio or video, but that's a good thing given that HBO has done a customarily excellent job in that department from the beginning. All of the original supplements have been included, though season four feels short-changed in contrast to the rest (it only receives two audio commentaries, while the other seasons boast many commentaries and featurettes). The only new bonus material is a disc featuring fifteen ""music videos"" (though most of these are merely extended scenes from the show itself). The music is splendid, but you can hear all of it within the context of the show and not miss a whole lot. Unless that's something you really need, hanging on to your individual seasons is probably the best way to go. Still, for those who haven't seen or purchased the series yet, this simple-yet-effective box set is a good option (especially considering that the individual seasons vary in size and packaging quality).

6029947,5,B00FRIMJG8,"What a wonderful show this was. Of course I must say I am saddened by how HBO treated it. They just gave up on it after the second season. But none the less, the setting, acting, music and costumes are tops!
I found that if you are able to watch the great Spike Lee documentary ""When the Levees Broke"" you should do so before watching Treme. It just gets you ready.
Even though, like in The Wire regarding Baltimore , you see the corruption and violence in NOLA, you want to experience the place for yourself (unlike Baltimore haha).
It's a great show to own. You can put it on and just enjoy the drama, laughs and amazing music anytime.",1457049600,4,637,4.316666666666666

6029950,5,B00FRIMJG8,I love this series! My husband was born and raised in New Orleans and this was just what we need when we want some N.O. flavor.  It also is a reminder of one of the greatest tragedies in American history.  Also the resilience and determination to bring the great town back from the hurricane and its distruction.

6029952,4,B00FRIMJG8,"When you finish watching Treme you'll be ready to go to NOLA, if not move there permanently. The highly idealized portrait of the cultural scene and local charm drowns out the depictions of corruption and poverty, but it's easy to play along and enjoy the music and scenery. The characters are engaging and so are the storylines. The series moves at a leisurely pace with many musical interludes, which may not be for everyone. It's refreshing that the original storylines are for the most part followed through to conclusion without the writers ginning up new crises in the third season to excite people. Fun stuff.",1435363200,,616,4.876190476190477

6029967,2,B00FRIMJG8,"This series is most difficult for me to review.  I purchased it because of D. Simon's work on The Wire, a series of great critical acclaim, and a strong personal favorite.  Thus I was predisposed to favorably savor this series.  I almost quit after 3 episodes, but forced myself to ""carry on"" until character involvement and a semblance of plot appeared.
  I'm a life long Classical Music fan-advocate and am fortunate to have both a dedicated audio room and a home theater.  This has been a life long hobby with the home theater involvement covering the last 15 years.  I have a high def projector with a 120"" screen and a 5.1 system with speakers which cost approximately $25,000.  It is something that I'm able to afford and I value quality sound.
  A few years ago, aware of my ignorance about Jazz and my inability to really involve myself in that musical body of work, I purchase and watched Ken Burns' ""JAZZ"" PBS series; a ten episode opus.  I was educated but still lacked the ability to immerse and appreciate.
  Hence my problems with ""Treme.""  Compressed music and advertisments are LOUD because of compression, as in MP3 files. In viewing this series, I found myself sitting with my remote control lowering the volume for jazz sequences ( definitely compressed ) and raising the volume for dialogue.  For me, the music interrupted the fragments that became the series plot(s).
  For those that don't know, Treme is a District in New Orleans.  The 2000 Census counted 8,853 people, 3429 households, and 2064 families.  Katrina hit on 8-28-05.  Because of an early retirement, I was transfixed by the live coverage of that disaster, the suffering, and the lack of a governmental response.  It was just another nail in the GOP coffin that Bush the Younger hammered home; we suddenly appeared to be a 3rd world nation... ? a Harbinger.  Treme's Census in 2010 was 4,155 people, 1,913 households, and 827 families.
  The Treme Series does a good job of painting the overall picture of Federal and Local authorities' efforts to alter... maybe forever... the fabric of Treme's social culture.  More nails driven home.  It is said that the Treme District is the actual home of both Jazz and what's called the Rebirth of Jazz, hence the strong emphasis on Jazz in this series.  But that emphasis coupled with Compression diminished my ability to become deeply involved and enjoy the ""Treme"" series.
  The Katrina catastrophe, coupled with deeper alienation and resentment by Blacks, and anguished sorrow over it all among Whites truly added more nails.  Without that, the economic collapse, and the bailout of the ""banksters,"" Barack Obama would most likely still be a Senator.  Perhaps those final musings are incorrect and most likely will offend some or even many but such strange things are often interwoven to make History.",1422489600,2,2831,4.8844537815126055

6029973,4,B00FRIMJG8,"Fantastic series, great writing and great acting; great cinematography, music, costumes too. Not just entertaining, but thoughtful.

But for all its forays into the 'real' or 'dark' side of New Orleans (dirty cops, carpetbaggers, etc.), if Simon and crew were to be honest they'd have held up one more mirror: to THEMSELVES and other well-meaning outsiders who in the process of well-meaning attempts to support New Orleans culture, may have actually watered it down. Confront the idea that the void created by the diaspora of New Orleans locals -- some of whose families have been in NOLA for generations -- is being filled with well-meaning but culturally inauthentic douchebags from SF, NY, LA, StL, etc. (Try going down Frenchmen St. these days vs. what it was like pre-""Treme"" (pre-2010); try seeing what the crowd is like at the Candlelight Lounge these days vs. pre-""Treme""; try seeing how many awesome local bands do a half-arsed version of the ""Treme"" song now as part of their setlist and as a cheap pandering for tips; what kind of people are living in Bywater now as opposed to before the storm; what kind of Burning-Man-exhibitiionsts/attention-seekers masquerading as ""bands"" are coming out of the 9th Ward these days; look at where rents are going in New Orelans).  Thanks for trying, but it's not good enough.

That all being said, I'm glad it was David Simon who made this, and he and the rest of the Treme team did do a bang-up job.  The film is definitely 4-stars; its effects on dumbing down New Orleans culture are arguably much lower-rated.",1401321600,10,1562,4.90530303030303
6029974,5,B00FRIMJG8,"a fantastic document of culture and historical significance for New Orleans.

6029975,3,B00FRIMJG8,"I found Treme disappointing.  After watching the first two of four series I decided to give it a rest.  Appropriately, I, a Catholic, began watching just before Mardi Gras, and continued during Lent.  Maybe after Easter I will resurrect the third and four series.  All in all it is a depressing task.",1396483200,2,300,4.711538461538462
6029976,5,B00FRIMJG8,"Treme is as compelling and dramatic as The Wire was plus Music.  The actors are all excellent, even the musicians who play characters in the long-form play.
The music is wonderful in all its incarnations - in the Complete Series set are several performances as music videos.
Blu-Ray is the way to go for a clean colorful picture.
""Blues-Ray""(DTS Master Audio) gives extra punch you never heard when the series ran on HBO.
What manner of dramatic entertainment will Mr. Simon explore next?
I can barely wait.",1395619200,4,507,4.827586206896552
8618315,5,B00FRIMJG8,"Much like the Wire, Treme breaks new ground in television.  Through a series of characters, it is about the revival of New Orleans after the hurricane but also brings out the culture and the type of people who chose to make it their home.  There is hope, anger, frustration, and beauty.

The characters, most of whom are normal people, are locked in a huge struggle to rehabilitate the city and make it better or just livable again.  They are all compelling, flawed, and giving in their own unique ways.  You really feel like you are witnessing their gritty lives.  The acting is uniformly first rate.

My favorite part was the music.  Even though it skips around, often before a song is finished, it worked perfectly for me, spoke to the deepest part of my soul and love of jazz.

8618319,4,B00FRIMJG8,"Once again, like The Wire, David Simon presents us with a quite unlikeable white male protagonist whom we're--somehow--supposed to love.  In fact, this time, two: the loser Davis and the jerk Sonny.  It takes a lot of patience to endure some of their scenes, and even more to not to become almost outright resentful at Sonny's happy ending.

While the Wire liked to bring up cop show cliches in order to deliberately undermine them, Treme often goes for the cheap shots--taking those very cliches at face value, playing them straight and thus creates a far more black-and-white moral world than the previous show, which removes a lot of the moral complexity of the show.  ALL the cops in New Orleans, except one, are apparently just bad and/or incompetent; everyone in the music industry management is a sleaze, etc. And don't get me started on the whitewashing Kid Ory bit. Of course it's offensive, but man, really?  Couldn't have handled that in any way that, you know, trusted your audience to get it?

I agree with other reviewers--the preachiness got intrusive in places, such as the needless dig at autotuning. I'm glad they dropped the YouTube viral element of the first two seasons--it felt forced even with the acting powerhouse of John Goodman behind it and got even more awful as they tried to continue it.

Albert's plot is the one that got me through all four seasons--it's the only one with a solid arc.  Many of the other characters aren't quite as arc-worthy--Toni, despite everything, doesn't change much over the seasons (not that I think she needed to) despite everything, and while a few of the characters have 'grown up' a bit by the end, it's hardly a straightforward road. Second to Albert's plot is Janette's, which, though I really loved her character, seemed uneven. SUDDENLY she turns into Hell's Kitchen chef for half of an episode, just so the plot could create a rift between her and her investors? OUR Janette?  And let's be honest 'opening a restaurant is a tough business' isn't exactly the sort of new or nuaced plot we got in the Wire.  LaDonna's a great female character, but the rape-and-revenge that occupies several seasons is, again, cliche.

The music, though, was lovely, and it's clear that just about everyone loves both the city and the music of New Orleans--not only do we get exposed to a whole host of classic songs and artists, but we also see Jazz Fest, Lundi Gras, the Indians, second-lines, etc. For this fact alone, the show is worth it and these things redeem many of the show's weaknesses.

Another plus of the show, and here I do see Simon's strength, is the overarching narrative of recovery. When it's not overwrought and cliched (stranger from outta town's gonna come in here and graft his way into money while  screwing the good people of the city), the question of how does a city recover from a disaster like this, and what makes a city unique are absolutely heartwrenching.  I had the pleasure of being in NOLA pre-Katrina, and then again 2 years ago, and this show captured exactly how I felt the second time--the place I remembered was gone, but not entirely, and I'm still not sure if that's a good thing.",1486166400,,3172,4.743636363636363
