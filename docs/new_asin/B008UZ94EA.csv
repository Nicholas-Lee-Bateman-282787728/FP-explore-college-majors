8530675,4,B008UZ94EA,"My comment is about the dvd presentation.  The container says that all three films are fully letterboxed, but the first film, International Man of Mystery, is not.  It fills the screen, making it 16 x 9, or around a 1.85 to 1 aspect ratio.  The other 2 films are letterboxed, as described on the box. I've read the blu ray of IMOM is letterboxed, but I don't have it so I can't confirm.
