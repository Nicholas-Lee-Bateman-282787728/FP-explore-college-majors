8624514,2,B00GM79HFY,"Starting with the opening chords, slurred by Rattle, I began to get a sinking feeling when the cast filed onto the stage (covered in astroturf) and sat with their legs hanging into the orchestra pit, with looks on their faces saying ""for the money you wankers have spent, we could have given you something really great, but what do WE know.""
The watchword for this production is ""inconsistent"".
The staging is astroturf (sorry I don't have a copyright symbol) and rear projections of forest scenes, the costumes are contemporary to thrift shop, with a skeleton thrown in, and the orchestra is focused - sometimes.
The singing is generally quite good but not comfortably in the Mozart idiom and not well focused in a dramatic sense. The Queen of the Night is wearing a Little Black Dress, plain straight hair, and bright red lipstick, is rubbing herself erotically and appears to be having an extended physical orgasm on stage facing Tamino during her first aria. As she ends the aria she kisses him full on the mouth and then walks offstage. She also has to vibrate her jaw in order to get some of the coloratura out. In contrast, i just watched Damrau in the Covent Garden BluRay - her singing, her costume, her makeup, her movements are all dazzling!
The main character in this production who is costumed is Papageno (played by Michael Nagy), but he is decidedly low voltage in area of magnetism, and that is how Papageno usually puts his character across. They both have the voice, but Keenlyside at Covent Garden really fills out his character through his voice - we see so much of his humor attitudes and outlook on life communicated in his voice. Nagy us able to turn it on later, but not consistently, and strangely, when we see him offstage in the bonus features he is much more ebullient.

The Tamino and Pamina have good voices, but don't seem well involved in the drama or with each other.
The Director Robert Carsen is up to his usual tricks, and in the bonus feature following the program he makes some explanations of the concept that he was bringing to this production. He has rewritten Schikaneder so that all the inconsistencies of the first Act are almost forgotten when the Queen of the Night switches sides without explanation in the second Act, as do her minions, the Three Ladies (who nevertheless act like cabaret entertainers). The Queen is now lovey with Sarastro, who she was just plotting to murder (and continues to do so). Carsen's explanation is that in his mind they are all working together to initiate Tamino and Pamina into enlightened adulthood. She continues to play this schizophrenic role throughout the act and encourages Pamina in taking the initiation she was saying would steal her forever. After cuddling with Sarastro on the astroturf at the end, she and the Three Ladies calmly walk offstage presumably to Hell as in the original production script. Carsen has interfered with the primary tension in the drama here, and for no real reason except ""look at me!""
We are used to a fair amount of cutting and rearranging in Mozart opera's because he wrote so prolifically and never really left final editions of his works. If Carson wants to reshape and rewrite the second act to come out with a different concept in a different ending then he should just do it and take his lumps. Instead he's writing in stage directions calling for actions that are clearly contradictory to the original and he does nothing to integrate them to make sense of the story.
Which brings me back around to inconsistency.
Most of the costumes are normal clothing, orchestral style is variable, and they don't sound like the Berlin Philharmonic.

With weak characterizations, weak costuming, weak sets, weak dramatic values, it's not really clear whether this is a concert  performance or meant to be a full staging.
Mozart deserves much better, and I would recommend the Colin Davis production from Covent Garden on BluRay, plus.many other older productions now on DVD; start by looking for your favorite singers, they are well represented among the Queens, Sarastros and Papagenos.
You could go as far back as 1937-39 to one of the greatest Magic Flutes ever, also with the Berlin Philharmonic led by Sir Thomas Beecham, that has never been out of print in 75 years. It features one of the greatest Papagenos ever, Gerhard Huesch, with a truly great cast. A worthy secondary choice on CD, in mono sound.

I realize that this is the Easter Festival at Baden-Baden and it appears that this was not staged in Berlin, home territory.
But a few hours of editing could have helped the production. There are several interviews that explain some of Carsen's ""alterations"", but don't excuse the confusion caused by his erratic changes. At some point, a good production, should be self-contained and resolve its own questions and inconsistencies as it goes along. At best, it is unnecessary distraction that serves no end purpose.",1413936000,,4940,4.835697399527187
8624515,2,B00GM79HFY,"I'll admit that I've never liked that old line that people throw at conductors they don't particularly like, that they make the music more about what they want than what the composer wanted.  Karajan seemed to attract that kind of criticism a lot (undeservedly, in my opinion).  It's not as though the conductor adds or takes away from the score (usually).  It has more to do, I think, with a person's views as to how the piece ""should"" sound.  If the performance doesn't meet their pre-conceived notions, that criticism is used: it's not what the composer intended.

I don't  like this criticism for a whole host of reasons.  But mostly, I don't like that it is used to lend credence to a listener's opinion, when in reality it is just an opinion.  In the case of this recording though, I have to use that criticism: the music has little to do with Mozart and everything to do with Sir Simon Rattle.  I don't say that because I don't like this or that aspect of the performance, but because he so blatantly twists and abuses the score.

This is evident from the very first three measures.  Despite the given tempo of Adagio, the sixteenth note pickups of the so-called ""Dreimaliger Akkord"" are taken completely out of rhythmic context and sound closer to an accacciatura.  That kind of sets the tone for the rest of the opera.  Sir Simon consistently plays around with the tempi, speeding up, slowing down, etc. when there is no indication of such in the score.  Dynamics are another area that seem to be fair game; a never-ending stream of additions and alterations.  Some may not object, but I do not believe that the music is enhanced by this.  It's as though Sir Simon is saying to the audience, ""Look how clever I am,"" rather than letting the music speak for itself.

I had high hopes for this recording.  Sir Simon hasn't recorded very much Mozart, but what he has done has been exceptional.  The 2013-2014 season opener for the Berliner Philharmoninker is a great example of this.  His interpretation of the final three Mozart Symphonies is a marvel.  It is well worth the cost of a ticket to the Digital Concert Hall just to listen to them.  But his Magic Flute falls flat.

The performance is not without some redeeming qualities.  The Berliner Philharmoniker is exceptional.  The singing is also generally quite good.  Pavol Breslik is a very good Tamino.  Ana Durlovski is an exceptional Queen of the Night.  The rest of the cast (with the exception of the Drei Damen) is outstanding.

The staging wasn't much to my liking.  It follows the trend of giving operas a modern setting.  Sometimes it works, sometimes not.  This is by no means the worst (or strangest) that I've seen, but I didn't particularly enjoy it.  Mozart is famed for saying that the text/story should serve the music.  I think this kind of setting turns it the wrong way around; the music becomes subservient to the on-stage action.  The stage director Robert Carsen follows Sir Simon's lead: make it more about what I want than what the libretto indicates.

If you are looking for a good alternative, I would recommend Sir Colin Davis's 2003 production from Covent Garden.  It has an outstanding cast with some very big stars (Simon Keenlyside, Will Hartmann, Dorothea Rschmann, etc.).",1410393600,,3267,4.71858407079646
