8241309,4,B0011AU7JW,"I enjoyed this video but felt there was information for the beginner that wasn't in the presentation. Vital info like meltpoint of the wax for embeds and the best wick sizes for her projects. She did list size for 9"" pie but not for ice cream,rootbeer etc. I was a bit disappointed as this is the info I needing most. Great ideas though. I don't think it was worth as much as I paid for it.",1317600000,,390,4.144736842105263
8241310,5,B0011AU7JW,"Gel candles are beautiful, but they are expensive.  This DVD has great instructions and ideas that will get you not just making gel candles but feeling you can experiment and create on your own.  Even my kids and husband enjoyed making gel candles after seeing Marie Kauffman's demonstrations.",1209772800,,293,5.083333333333333

I really loved this video!  You can tell that Marie Kauffman loves working with Gel candles. This is the 5th video from Gatehouse Candles that I have seen (although not all of them are for sale here at Amazon), and while they have all been very good, this one is just outstanding. The video takes you from the most basic type of Gel candle through fairly involved candles that use other type of waxes as well.  One lesson builds on the next, giving the needed experience to tackle the more complicated candles.  The advice on working with embeds and how to use ""scrap"" wax was worth the cost alone. I just love the Maple Pecan Sundae and Ice Tea Set Projects, but I think the Strawberry Pie and Fruit Preserve candles will sell better for me.

Pros:
Very detailed instructions
Overhead shots during the detailed parts help a lot
Great Tips and Tricks
Great safety advice
Every major type of Gel candle included

Cons:
None! This is the best candlemaking video I have ever seen (and I have a lot of them)

If you are interested in Gel candles, or candle making in general, this video is for you! Highly recommended.",1202169600,,1149,4.553398058252427
