7913719,5,B00000JWWZ,"This, along with volumes 2 & 3 of the Image DVD collections of Chaplin Essenay comedies, are the best versions of these classic films available. The recent Flicker Alley Blu-rays slow the image down to a jerky looking motion, but these Image DVDs are presented at a perfect natural speed. The black levels are rich and strong, as opposed to the Flicker Alley Blu-rays which show shades of gray instead of black. The music is also better on these DVDs, so I recommend these Image DVDs to everyone as the very best Chaplin Essanay collection available.",1466035200,,550,4.739583333333333
7913720,5,B00000JWWZ,"After having established his Little Tramp character at Mack Sennett's Keystone Studio, Charlie Chaplin signed with the Essanay Film Manufacturing Co. in 1915 where he was to enjoy greater freedom in expanding his potential as a filmmaker.

During that year, Chaplin produced 16 comedies, all of which concentrated on performance style which allowed the gags to build, thereby sustaining laughter. Chaplin also began to introduce the element of pathos with THE TRAMP and THE BANK, and this became a trademark in his later work.

If you're looking for definitive versions of Chaplin's Essanay comedies, you need not look further than Image's DVD volumes 1, 2 and 3. With restoration and tinting supervised by David Shepard, the transfers look wonderful, having been obtained from the best surviving print sources gathered over nine years of searching American and European collections. The delightful musical accompaniment features piano scores by Eric James and orchestral arrangements by Robert Israel.

No silent comedy enthusiast should pass up this marvelous collection of films that represent a vital chapter in the career of the greatest pantomimist in cinema history. My highest recommendation.",1409356800,2,1200,5.510869565217392
7913721,5,B00000JWWZ,"Charlie Chaplin might not have been the first on the scene, but he undoubtedly made the biggest impact on film comedy as he & his alter ego The Little Tramp gained enormous world-wide fame within the short span of a year. It was only a matter of time before both popularity & ambition made Chaplin spread his wings & leave the famous Keystone Studios for greener pastures. When Chaplin left the frenzied environment of Mack Sennett & signed with Essanay Studios, he settled into different surroundings which granted him creative control over his work. This is where his artistry first blossomed, as he could now slow down the pace of his comedies & allow stories to play out more naturally. At first, it wasn't easy to break away from the Sennett humor; their pie-in-the-face formula still lingered with Chaplin as his sometimes hostile character would frequently engage in such casual violence as shoving, punching, kicking & using his cane as a weapon. But what was noticeable at Essanay was that while The Little Tramp was rough around the edges, he was also instinctively graceful. Chaplin's approach to comedy set him apart from other comics of the day with his unique mannerisms. He could turn the simple lighting of a cigarette or the twirl of his cane into comic poetry.
Thus follows the beginning of Chaplin's growth as both performer & filmmaker with this first batch of Essanay comedies. ""His New Job"" mines its humor from the rituals of The Tramp trying to gain employment at a film company. There's the long frustrating waits in rooms for auditions; temperamental actors & bosses; and the actual work itself. Chaplin's comic gifts help lift what could have been a routine slapstick satire into something worthwhile. ""A Night Out"" could almost be a prelude to his Mutual comedy ""One A.M."" He & his pal get soused to the gills and do their best to disrupt one establishment after another. Highlights include Chaplin's drunken harassment of patrons in a restaurant; his ""freshening up"" at a lobby fountain; his pal dragging him by the collar down sidewalks (as Chaplin picks flowers along the way); and his drunken attempts to get ready for bed. ""The Champion"" is a lively slapstick comedy from start to finish, showcasing Chaplin's amazing physical comedy gifts. As a down-on-his-luck vagabond, Chaplin participates in a boxing match against the title character. This is really the climax worth waiting for, which is almost an early blueprint for Chaplin's classic feature ""City Lights"". ""In the Park"" is pretty much a standard ""park bench comedy"" you'd find Sennett making at Keystone. But Chaplin plays it out for all its worth, embellishing flirtations & other funny gestures. ""A Jitney Elopement"" is sort of a departure as The Tramp pretends to be a count & thus used as a ""ringer"" to impress a girl's picky father seeking a proper suitor for his daughter. The first half of the film relies on situation & subtlety, then becomes a more familiar slapstick comedy in its last half, climaxed by a madcap car chase.
The term ""film history"" really applies itself here, considering that these rare films are about to celebrate their 100th Anniversary. Can't wait to see Essanay's volumes 2 & 3!",1350950400,2,3203,4.911439114391144
7913722,5,B00000JWWZ,"Silent comedies of the 1910's have long been associated with off-speed flickering images, of ghostly low contrast and nitrate decomposition. Not the case with this series of restored Chaplin Essanay comedies. The images are (for the most part) crisp, clean, and full of life. The music tracks keep up the pace and provide a finished viewing experience. This is a precious time capsule from a bygone age and a unique opportunity to watch Chaplin develop his ""little tramp"" persona.",1269129600,,480,5.0886075949367084
7913723,4,B00000JWWZ,"This first volume in the set of 1915 Essanay shorts presents Chaplin's first experiments with the gags and situations that he will refine over the years in his mature films. Although in 1915 he had only been in the movies for one year, he is clearly fully confident of his talents as a comedian, and he is unafraid to test new ideas at a furious pace. Watching these films is like listening to Louis Armstrong's early ""Hot Five"" sessions -- a non-stop flood of mostly completely new ideas, not all of which work, but enough do to make the experience enjoyable. Unfortunately, we are somewhat burdened in not being able to fully appreciate the freshness of this work -- we have seen the humor either repeated by Chaplin in later films or by other comedians. Still, even today it's possible to sense the spontaneity, the improvisational nature of these scenes.

Part of Chaplin's creative spurt is no doubt the result of suddenly being endowed with more freedom than he was able to achieve at Keystone, the studio he had recently left. In fact, the first film in the set, ""His New Job"", is a thinly disguised poke at his old employer, about working as a movie actor in the ""Lodestone"" Film Company. This film shows how Chaplin's approach to comedy differs significantly from the Keystone formula -- the pace in the action is noticeably slower. By slowing the pace, Chaplin can better mine each scene for more comic gold, and he characteristically bases the humor more on pantomime than on pure slapstick. Even a simple act such as changing into a costume he wears to shoot a scene in ""His New Job"" provides a wealth of material for comic invention. In these movies, people and things supply a continuous supply of props for Chaplin's creativity.

Along with the flurry of new ideas, the character of the tramp is still under development in these early films. This tramp character is still closer to the Keystone tramp -- quite simply, a nuisance. There is no heroism toward the down-trodden, no sense of the hopelessness of poverty, no resentment towards the oppression of authority here. The tramp of these films is driven purely reactively by his senses, flirting with every hour-glass figure he encounters, fighting with anyone who looks at him the wrong way, and willing to do anything, honest or otherwise, for immediate gain. Even when he gets the girl, he has already won her, as in ""A Jitney Elopement"". Really the only moment in this collection when the character shows an inclination towards something more noble is in the opening scenes of ""The Champion"" where he shares a humble meal with his lowly dog.

One final word: the quality of the films is superb, which is especially important in appreciating the flood of new comic ideas that emerge from the mind of the master.",1100131200,6,2782,4.755693581780538
7913724,5,B00000JWWZ,"Okay, this review is for the Image dvd of the Chaplin Essanay Comedies, Volume 1. If this review appears on any other product, with the exception of a Kino product, then know that this review has NOTHING to do with whatever you are looking at. If you are looking at Madacy or Koch videos, then just go away now, and look for a good video, because Madacy and Koch videos of Chaplin are garbage.
ANYWAYS...
I give this five stars, because the restoration, music, and presentation are awesome. The films are the most complete they have been in over 80 years, and are mastered from the best available materials. David Shepherd worked on these for a decade or so, and some of the films come from as many as five different sources. This can be a little odd sometimes, as the picture will change in quality and framing every so often, which is a bit of a jumpy sensation, but it's either that or just miss the footage altogether.
As far as the films go - well, this is not Chaplin's best work. ""His New Job"", ""A Night Out"", and ""In the Park"" are slight, derivative, and not terribly interesting. ""A Jitney Elopement"" is fascinating for the fact that Chaplin relies on a lot of tracking and racing shots for the chase, which all happens in cars. ""The Champion"" is a very good film, and is the best of this lot.
Chaplin made better films than these for Essanay, which can especially be seen on Disc 2 of the series.
This is NOT a good disc for the person who is just getting interested in Chaplin or silent films. You would be better of with the later features, such as City Lights, The Kid, The Gold Rush, or The Circus, which should all be reissued in 2003 in gorgeous quality - I can't wait!
But if you are acquainted with Chaplin, and have read a good book or two about his career and development, then this is a fine dvd to get.
Enjoy!",1040515200,21,1831,4.341107871720117
7913725,2,B00000JWWZ,I don't believe that Chaplin achieved comedic excellence until his features. These shorts are crude physical humor and totally unfunny. Dated stuff.,1025827200,3,148,5.7727272727272725
