THE EXERCISES ARE WELL EXPLAINED AND DEMOSTRAIGHTED. NOTHING THAT IS IMPOSSABLE TO DO. THIS DVD GIVES U TIPS DURING THE WORKOUT. I LIKE THE TIPS PERSONALLY, I THINK ITS GOOD INFO BUT MAYBE NOT DURING THE WORK OUT BUT AFTER WOULD BE BETTER. I LIKE HOW THE VIDEO IS WIDE ON THE INSTRUCTORS WHOLE BODY AND NOT ZOOMED IN THE FACE WHILE THEY'RE DOING A NEW EXERCISE LIKE OTHER VIDEO DO. (I REALLY HATE THE ZOOM TO THE FACE! YEAH WE ALL KNOW THESE INSTRUCTORS ARE PRETTY BUT I DIDN'T BUY THE DVD TO LOOK AT THEIR FACES, I WANT TO SEE THE EXERCISES!!) THEY SHOWED ME SOME STRETCHES THAT ACTUALLY STRETCH AREAS OF MY BODY I COULD NEVER GET A GOOD STRETCH IN BEFORE!

THIS WILL MAKE YOUR LEGS VERY SORE!!! BUT IF YOU DON'T GO DOWN (SQUATS) SO FARE EVERY TIME AND TAKE IT EASY THE FIRST COUPLE OF TIMES U DO IT, U JUST MIGHT BE ABLE TO WALK THE NEXT DAY. JUST REMEMBER TO TAKE IT EASY, TIME AND TAKE BREAKS IF U NEED TO. U DON'T HAVE TO KEEP UP W THE VIDEO, JUST DO WHAT U CAN!

DON'T FORGET TO STRETCH! STRETCH! STRETCH!! THIS WILL SAVE YOUR LEGS FROM SOME PAIN (I STRETCH BEFORE AND AFTER LIKE 45MINS)",1268265600,,1230,4.032786885245901
