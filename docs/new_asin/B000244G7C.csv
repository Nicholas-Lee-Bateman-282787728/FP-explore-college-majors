2061830,1,B000244G7C,"This film is not really a film at all. It's extended footage of a concert with Rita Coolidge and a few other people singing at some resort in Colorado. There is a loose story taking place around the concert about Alan Thicke wanting to be a professional skier and Jim Carrey wanting to learn how to pick up girls. Ultimately, though, the plot makes no sense.

The entire film is around an hour long and about 40 minutes of that is concert footage. The rest is a watered down meaningless plot. The film and sound quality are terrible to boot.

Jim Carrey is the main character, and it's interesting to see him as a young man working the schtick he would later become famous for, but it's not worth the price of this DVD, unless you are a hardcore Jim Carrey fan. There's not that much good material here.

Also, the DVD doesn't have any special features, or even a menu, even though it advertises as much on the box. The movie just plays as soon as you put the DVD in. This film is simply a production company that made a pointless terrible film with an unknown actor named Jim Carrey cashing in and making some money off the fact that he is now famous. But this movie has no redeeming qualities. Don't buy it.",1167868800,,1209,4.34070796460177
2061831,1,B000244G7C,"The only thing worse than seeing this movie is the fact that it plays automatically all over again when it's over. This is a glorified music video of horrible music. Jim Carey should not be on the cover of this movie either, as he is in about 15 to 20% of the whole thing. They should have had whoever the musical artist was. I honestly don't even know the plot of this movie, and I'm not kidding. I laughed so hard out loud ... when I had to read the back of the DVD case to remember what it was supposed to be about. The sound? They interlaced two songs (one in your right speaker, one in your left) that don't even match. If you want an idea for a good movie, read the back of this DVD case, and follow that plot, as the director sure steered clear of it. Alan Thicke ... I thought I knew ye! Oh, and I gave it one star only because I couldn't find the ""Give me my money back"" option.

***EDIT*** It's currently selling at $.16 in the used section. That says something right there. It's almost tempting to buy to give to people. I go to a university out in OKC, and we've passed it around the dorm telling everyone ""It's the best movie ever! It's SO funny!"" blah blah blah ... then, they get mad after they lose an hour of their life, but have no problem passing it around to others and doing the same to them!",1109980800,20,1313,4.089147286821706
2061832,1,B000244G7C,This movie is awful. Sound and audio are terrible. Jim Carrey should be embarrassed. The only thing that could help this movie is to turn it off.,1105056000,10,145,4.407407407407407

2061834,5,B000244G7C,"This movie is so freakin' COOOOOLLL!!!  Check it out, I grew up 6 miles away from where this was filmed, and it really did take place at Club Med in Copper Mountain, Colorado!  They even drive through the Eisenhower Memorial Tunnel on their way there!!!  My roommate owns a condo in Copper like right next to the Club Med and you can totally check out the exterior of his building in this amazing film!!!  For all you Colorado ski buffs you need to check this out because it's so bad it's amazing.

Mr. Bojangles is the man!",1101600000,6,524,4.360824742268041
2061835,1,B000244G7C,"The acting was stiff and vapid, the filming was grainy and amateurish, the story was non-existent. A good Rx for insomnia, this forgettable piece of rubbish has only one redeeming quality: Seeing young Jim Carey trying to make the most of a boring script and insipid role.",1091836800,12,272,4.808510638297872
2061836,1,B000244G7C,"This thankfully brief title cannot even be called a movie; it is a glorified ad for the ski slopes and entertainment at Club Med. It is only worth a viewing if you REALLY have to see a young Jim Carrey doing good impersonations of Steve Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. singing Mr. Bo Jangles. And if you want to see what Get Smart's Hymie the Robot has been up to! Otherwise, you would have to be a fan of skiing championships or the musical performers (see other reviewer's comments for musicians' names; I forget who they are) that dominate this overlong commercial.",1088985600,3,563,4.529411764705882
2061837,1,B000244G7C,"I bought this video because it was closeout cheap and had Jim Carey (the early years) and that I knew could be bad, and it was.  I can't believe someone rated this 5 positive stars.  Young inexperience comedian Jim Carry was at his worst.  As they say ""his stik was broken"".  This was a music video gone wrong...someone called it a movie. And what was the sheet and rope used for?  I have no idea.  I may have missed the best scene.  I really like Carey in SOME OF HIS LATER VIDEOD, HE WAS SUPER!  However, I tossed this  disk in the trash. P.S. I have no idea what ""piece of shaith"" means, but it  but it came up as a suggested tag and it sounded bad so I used it.",1298160000,,665,4.00763358778626
2061838,3,B000244G7C,"I live in the old Club Med building at Copper Mountain Resort and when I saw this movie I had to have it. It is old and kind of boring, but still an entertaining item to own.",1294272000,,174,3.72972972972973
2061839,5,B000244G7C,i will have to agree this is not one of jim carrey's best movies. but it was still good. jim carrey is hillarious. this movie is about two bachelors who go to a ski resort in colorado to seek out hotties. but jim carrey's character Bobby has a proplem everytime he sees trys to meet a hottie everything backfires and his buddy Jackson is a playboy so he don'yt have a problem with girls at all. so join these two characters on thier adventure to see if they score or not. This Movie Stars Jim Carrey(The Mask) and Alan Thicke. this movie is funny to some extent.,1269302400,,562,4.261682242990654
2061840,1,B000244G7C,"""Copper Mountain"" is hands-down the most phenomenal, brilliant and electrifying thing I have ever seen. Of course,  that is complete bollocks. I am lying. This has to be the absolute worst movie of all time. It is a garish blight on the history of film. I remember when I pulled it out of the bargain bin at Wal-Mart. I should have known then by the $6 sticker that there was no way. But i popped it in anyway. After getting over the initial shock that my DVD player didn't spontaneously combust in repulsion, I came to the conclusion that not only would I not pay six dollars for this utter waste of plastic, I would not pay 19 cents!! I am honestly surprised that I didn't gnaw my own leg off purely for a distraction. In retrospect, I am happy that I purchased this agonizing piece of rubbish as I now have the antidote to happiness itself. The ennui produced by this film is so great that you can effectively show it to house guests who you don't want ever to return and they won't. Get ""Copper Mountain"" today, or alternatively, repeatedly drop a bowling ball on your left big toe.",1259539200,4,1086,4.402985074626866
2061841,1,B000244G7C,"I rented this strictly out of curiosity since I heard it was bad. Guess what? IT IS. The plot here is almost non-existent. Jim Carrey and Alan Thicke, in Before They Were Stars mode, star as two single guys who go to Club Med Copper Mountain for fun and thrills. Jim can't be himself around women and scares them off, and Alan wants to be the world's best skier. That 20 minute plot is wrapped around 40 minutes of music. It is almost makes no sense. The film (all 59 minutes of it) also makes the now-defunct Club Med Copper Mountain look like a pretty boring place. This also reminded me of those specials they used to release in syndication to independent television stations during the 80s. The DVD does not have a start menu, no features, and repeats after it is over (which I guess is to torture the viewer).",1239148800,5,814,4.397350993377484
2061842,1,B000244G7C,"This supposed comedy is only 60 minutes long. And that's the one good thing about it. Much of the time consists of concerts with various artists I haven't heard of. The rest is a series of unfunny scenes with no plot. It's not worth wasting your time or money on, even if you're a die-hard Jim Carrey fan. Even he isn't funny in this one.",1195689600,,338,4.2153846153846155
2061843,1,B000244G7C,"I watched this movie after my brother - a condo owner at Copper Mountain - bought the DVD for a whopping one dollar, 50 cents. All I can say is... my brother got robbed on this purchase. The bad plot is only equaized by bad sound editing and really bad performances by a young Alan Thicke and Jim Carrey.

Funny thing is that I would at least expect it to be a good ad for Club Med since it appears this was sort of an early version of an infomercial. It doesn't even do a good job at that or showcasing Copper Mountain for that matter. It's bad plot, bad movie, bad infomercial, bad, bad, bad.

Interesting side note: The (at the time) super-deluxe Club Med at Copper now serves a different purpose... It's used for employee housing. I guess that goes to show how far luxury lodging has come since this movie was made.",1194566400,2,819,4.27741935483871
2061844,3,B000244G7C,"Ok, this movie is not a real movie but a promotional advertisement for the Club Med. Bad script, bad acting, bad everything EXCEPT if you're like me a big fan of BILL CHAMPLIN, songwriter, musician and singer member of the Band Chicago. In this movie you will enjoy to see him performing 2 entire songs from his album ""Runaway"" (""Sara"" & ""Take it uptown"") on stage. The movie also features Rita Coolidge performing the Boz Scaggs song ""we're not alone"".",1173484800,2,453,4.675
2061845,1,B000244G7C,"This was Jim Carrey's first film and suprisingly not his last.  Thankfully he found work in films that are actually worth watching.  Copper Mountain has to be one of the top ten worst movies I have ever seen.  The majority of the movie focuses on that no talent band that plays at the resort.  Jim Carrey is listed first on the IMDB cast list, even though he has very few lines.  The bottom line of the plot doesn't amount to anything more than Carrey's character Bobby Todd can't be himself around women, flies down a mountain on skis with his arms flailing around, he wipes out and two girls help him up, then all of a sudden he can be himself.  And Alan Thicke's character Jackson Reach wants to compete in a skiing competition, and gets beat by an overweight bartender in a race for the final spot in the competition. The bartender Yogi later drops his spot in the race and gives it to Jackson.  If you have read this there's no need to watch the film, unless you don't believe me.",1171756800,3,985,4.3497267759562845
2061846,1,B000244G7C,"This movie is terrible.  Do not buy it.  Really, I'm not exaggerating.  I will give you this movie free of charge.  You'll have to send me a SASAE, but other than that, it's yours for the asking.  After you watch it, we can go for drinks and talk about how truly terrible it is.

Jim Carrey is basically how he always is, great at doing impressions. Seems like a 15-20 minute short film stretch beyond comfortable limits.",1512345600,,280,4.62
8021894,1,B000244G7C,More than half of the movie was just a stage performance and the rest was bad jokes and a club med advertisement. Just awful,1509235200,,124,4.208333333333333

8021896,1,B000244G7C,"My brother recently came back from a trip to Copper Mountain.  While Googling Copper Mountain, I came across this DVD title.  I thought, why not watch this?  It could have some beautiful ski scenes and look really great on my 50"" flat panel.

Boy, was I wrong.  Not only was the video quality fuzzy and grainy, but the audio quality was muffled and distorted.  On top of that, there were not even very many good ski scenes!

Jim Carrey and Alan Thicke head to the mountain to ski and meet hot women.  But nothing happens.  First off, we find out when they arrive that Carrey does not even know how to ski.  Totally lame.  On top of that, Thicke, tries to ski and is terrible at it.  We don't even see very many hot women in the movie at all.  Carrey is totally boring as his character is completely flat.  The whole thing is just stupid, and was not even that funny.

Several musical numbers are in the film.  I was personally surprised to see Bill Champlin, who sang in the band Chicago, performing in the film.  Also Rita Coolidge and some completely forgettable guy named Ronnie Hawkins.  Gotta be honest here, I never even heard of Ronnie Hawkins before I saw this movie!  Who the hell is he?

We didn't even learn much about the whole ""club med"" experience either, there was no real effort to inform the viewer about the club med scene.

All in all, a stupid and dull film.  No good ski scenes, no real comedy, no real scenic views of the Colorado mountains, no hot women, no strong acting, no real plot, just a total flop.

THANK GOD I borrowed this from my local library.  I wasted an hour of my time watching it, but at least I was multitasking on my laptop and getting some work done at the same time.

Please, please, please, save your money, and don't waste your time  SKIP this movie!",1458777600,,1796,4.350453172205438

Yes, it has it's good and bad parts but Jim Carrey is pretty funny in this movie.  Jim does his Sammy Davis Jr. impression on this movie which is pretty hilarious.  Other than that, it's just a boring movie.  I'd recommend this movie to 80's buffs or anyone who loves to collect oddball movies that you don't see to often.  However, I wouldn't recommend this movie to Jim Carrey fans because they would be disappointed to say the least.",1385683200,2,551,4.20952380952381
8021900,1,B000244G7C,After watching this movie for 5 minutes I swore my DVD player had to messing up at the songs played loud and clear and the voice acting was terrible.  I checked the reviews here and it's clear is indeed the disc.  I bought this for a dollar thinking it would awesome to own Jim Carrey's first movie.  Boy was I wrong this want worth it. I'd they teenager it maybe but in its current state it seems like an extended advertisement for ski resorts.,1368316800,,445,4.273809523809524
8021901,1,B000244G7C,"There are bad movies that are entertaining because they are so bad, and there are bad movies that have no entertainment value whatsoever. Copper Mountain is one of the latter. There is absolutely no reason to watch this, not even if you are a die hard Jim Carrey fan. This is half lame plot about a ski competition and half really talentless and annoying country music concert. Of all the bad movies I have seen this is the most boring and pointless of them all. The production values aren't as bad as Z-movie sci-fi classics like the Beast of Yucca Flatts, but the production here is still crap. This has to be in anyone's list of the top 5 worse movies of all time. For me it's the very worst.",1302393600,,695,4.3538461538461535
