285581,5,6300216748,"Redford and Dunaway are a classic duo in this older film, which has a surprise at every turn.  I have seen it many times and have recommended to  others, who have loved it, too!
The pace is fast enough to keep you  interested, yet slow enough to delve a bit into the characters'  personalities.  Redford's double takes are priceless. You'll find yourself  wanting to see this more than once, because you will certainly not catch  everything the first time around.
The elevator scene is my  favorite.
I'd dub this one a sleeper and a keeper.  If you like a non  glitzy and suspensful story with some twists and turns, this one will not  disappoint.",943228800,3,647,4.587719298245614
285582,5,6300216748,"This is a very absorbing movie with first-rate performances by the entire cast.  You'll see Robert Redford at his best in this one.  I was also impressed by Fay Dunaway's performance.  She was terrific as the vulnerable  kidnapped victim.  Max non Sydow was his exceptional self, playing a cool,  calculating hit man, Cliff Robertson was perfect as CIA director Higgens,  and John Houseman's screen presence was never so obvious as in this film.  Honestly, there wasn't a bad performance in the entire movie.  This  intelligent spy thriller will make you sit up and pay attention as you  wonder who in the heck the good guys are, and who, if anyone, can you  possibly trust?  Between 1 and 10, ""Three Days of the Condor"", one of many  wonderful Redford/Pollack vehicles, gets a well-deserved 9.  Rent it, or  buy it.

285583,5,6300216748,"I had to watch this film a couple of times before I figured out all the ""who's"", ""why's"" and ""what's."" It is a somewhat complex tale of  government cover up and truth seeking, full  viewer attention is required to piece it all together (no going to the rest  room or leaving for a bite to eat while this film is running).
A person  can probably identify his/her outlook on national politics by identifying  whose character he/she most closely identifies with. Is it  Robert  Redford's character, Cliff Robertson's character or (lord forbid) Max Von  Sydow's character?
While most movies are not usually as good as the  books from which they are taken I believe ""Three Days of the  Condor"" is much better than the  book from which the story is taken,  ""Six Days of The Condor.""

He takes Faye Dunaway as a hostage so he can hole up in her apartment while he tries to figure out what's going on.  And who he can and can not trust.  As the movie goes on it is pretty suspenful.

285688,5,6300216748,"Hollywood produced some of the best social-commentary movies during the 70's. This movie is a fine example of that. The performances are great, Robert Redford does a very convincing job on his roll. Max von Sydow is excellent as usual and so are Faye Dunaway and Clift Robertson. The pacing and direction of the movie is also brilliant thanks to a great job by the late Sidney Pollack. He would eventually get the best director Academy Award for his film Out Of Africa. I liked Pollack's style as a director. He's done some of my favorite movies like They Shoot Horses, Don't they?, The Firm, Jeremiah Johnson and Tootsie.

To me this movie belongs with some of the great movies form that era. Movies that had more grit, more substance and top-notch acting. I would paint Three Days Of The Condor in the same brush as movies like, Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, The Day of the Jackal, The Eyes of Laura Mars, Marathon Man, All The President's Men, Network, The Godfather (1 and 2), One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest, The French Connection, Taxi Driver, Apocalypse now, etc. The seventies was the decade when Hollywood had something to say. People were attracted to the theaters to be engaged in a story that spoke about our society. These days it's all about CG, Superheroes and remakes. Seldom do we get to witness movies with some meat like the Three Days Of the Condor.

I recommend this film (as well as all the ones I mentioned here) very highly if your idea of entertainment requires some reflection afterwards. This movie has been one of my favorite ever since I first saw it back when it first came out. The performances are so good that it holds up brilliantly today.",1519776000,,1670,4.619528619528619

This one has Redford being a desk jockey that gets entangled as an Everyman into the Machiavellian machinations of the ""higher ups"" with real spies doing their best to remove him.  Some will say that there wasn't enough explanation (at least laid out prior to it happening) of the Inciting Incident.  This might be a deficiency for some but the story is really about Redford's character figuring out someone wants him dead (doesn't matter who originally did) and how to survive the onslaught of professionals out to make sure it happens.
This movie was made previous to Jason Bourne, Taken, and Die Hard so yes, its pacing heats up at a different rate but it is effective and it is quicker paced than Frantic.",1508889600,,968,4.540229885057471

285742,3,6300216748,"Review of Three Days of the Condor
Hot Toasty Rag, September 25, 2017

No one can make a suspenseful political movie in the 1970s like Robert Redford can! If you liked All the Presidents Men or a slightly older Redford in Truth, add Three Days of the Condor to your list this weekend.

In this one, he plays an analyst for the CIA. He turns in a seemingly innocuous report, but soon afterwards, everyone in his office gets killed. He tries to reach out to the CIA for protection, but finds out no one can be trusted and nowhere is safe. . .

Besides that slightly cheesy plot description, theres really nothing cheesy about this political thriller. Its not an action comedy; you're not going to hear Robert Redford cracking jokes after killing someone. This is a strict drama, with tensions mounting slowly like a modern-day Hitchcock movie. And, in true 70s style, theres lots of fluffy hairdos, aviator sunglasses, mustaches, and Faye Dunaway. Also, Im not going to give anything away, but Cliff Robertsons famous social commentary speech is from this moviein case youve seen that clip on tv or during a political film montage. This is the kind of movie that will make you think, and its just as relevant today as it was forty years ago.",1506297600,,1239,4.648401826484018
285743,5,6300216748,What a classic gem. I highly recommend.,1505692800,,39,4.714285714285714
285744,5,6300216748,"One of the great Watergate-era, paranoic thrillers. In some ways ""Condor"" updates an earlier generation of filmmaking: the plot is a potboiler, held together by stars (Redford and Dunaway) with whom the audience immediately sympathizes. The supporting cast, which includes Cliff Robertson, John Houseman, and (in a most interesting turn) Max Von Sydow, are excellent, giving texture to the plot-twists. Sydney Pollack directs with flair; the musical score by Dave Grusin is both jazzy and haunting. For this viewer, who saw it in a theater when first released, ""Condor"" holds up after repeated viewingsif you're in the mood to watch beautiful people spooked by their own government's machinations.",1504656000,5,697,5.462962962962963
285745,5,6300216748,I love it!!!!!!!,1503360000,,16,4.666666666666667
285746,5,6300216748,"Condor is the code name for an employee of the CIA. His mission is to read, read everything he can to see if there are any subversive codes being posted in innocuous looking literature.

In the book he discovers that the number of packages shipped to his location do not match the bill of lading. He brings this to the attention of his superiors.

One day he leaves by an un-recorded unauthorized back door for lunch. On returning he finds everyone dead.

Who did this and who can he trust? To survive he must use his wits and what he has learned from his reading.

The movie ""Three days of the Condor"" is based on this book, which is really first in a series of books, sort of like the James Bond series. Naturally being film media the story needed cutting down to size, hence three days instead of six.

Robert Redford has to squeeze James Grady's ""Six Days of the Condor"" into the Redford mold. The book plot of drugs and Viet Nam are out. Redford's substitute plot of oil and Arabs is in. Bad guys differ.

Great acting, great actors and a few faux pas, such as if they knew there was a back door to the location, don't you think it would be watched?

Tina Chen (Janice) can be seen again in the movie ""Paper Man"" (1971) where her computer prints out ""DEATH DEATH DEATH""

Now in Blu-ray for those obsesses with technology. I made the switch until something new comes along. This does not change the story or acting.",1502755200,,1419,4.3688212927756656

When Redford brings Dunaway back to her apartment, doesn't anyone need the bathroom?  And that would have been an issue for Redford since he couldn't afford to leave her alone for a minute with either of them in the bathroom (so they decided to not even go there but it would have been more real if they did).  Then Redford ties her up and leaves for awhile.  Wouldn't she have been unable to hold it in any longer?  She probably would have pissed herself.  Also, just how well did he tie her up that she couldn't wiggle free after an hour?  Lastly, he threatened her with the gun a few times but I think she could tell that he wasn't going to murder her and thought she would have screamed at some point or even told her boyfriend over the phone to call the police for her.

Max Von Sydow's character articulates this simplistic, serpentine and corrosive worldview in conversation with protagonist R. Redford. The film is another in-your-face cynical conditioning by the Illuminati who traumatized the American People with President Kennedy's horrific assassination just 12 years earlier.

285922,1,6300216748,"Classic Robert redford film from the 70's brilliantly Directed by Sydney Pollack
3 DAYS OF THE CONDOR about classic suspense and espionage
based on the novel 6 days of the condor which was about Heroin smuggling
but Sydney pollack thought it was better to make the film about
what was going on with the CIA back in 1974-75

Paramount's blu-ray version is terrible, the HD transfer given for the film is Good but not excellent
looks more like DVD transfer than 1080p quality plus the sound quality is also terrible 2.0 stereo mix
the only extras is the original Theatrical trailer that's it
however U.K. Distributor Eureka have given this film more respect than Paramount that's for sure
Eureka have given the film an excellent HD transfer in 2:35:1 ratio
very nice sharp & clear picture quality for sure plus Eureka have also boosted the sound quality to new 5.1 master audio mix
which sounds really Good
plus there's also new extras aswell
THE DIRECTORS-SYDNEY POLLACK which is a 60min Documentary about the Director himself & his movies
you get interviews with some of the Actors that have worked with sydney
NEW INTERVIEW WITH SHELDON HALL, film Historian Sheldon Hall talks in Great Detail about 3 days of the condor
about Sydney pollack, Robert redford, Cliff robertson & Faye dunaway- 20mins
there's also 32page booklet about the film and the HD transfer
and the original Theatrical trailer is included aswell
tragically no new interview with Robert redford or Faye Dunaway
but atleast Eureka's blu-ray is much better version in terms of picture quality & big sound quality boost
it says region B on the back so i tested it on my player that has region option
so i changed the option to region A and and the Blu-ray Disc seems to play region A
so U.S. fans can buy this U.K. blu-ray aswell

But she's busy going through Helsinki syndrome, and it WAS the seventies, so basically everyone involved with the film was like, ""eh, F%&# it!""  But, yeah, you might wanna watch this one with a pretty big grain of rapist salt...  NOT Hollywood at it's finest, and certainly not it's least misogynistic...  Dunaway's character even refers to herself as ""spy f#%&er,"" the idea being, ""well, hey, if SHE'S being self deprecating, then I guess it's ok.""  No guys, it's not, it's really not.  So either fast forward through that scene, or use it as a moment to discuss gender in film roles in the 1970's, but don't watch this one lightly.",1465776000,,916,4.729559748427673

286078,5,6300216748,"Sandwiched between Alan J Pakulas, The Parallax View (1974) and All the Presidents Men (1976), Sidney Pollacks, Three Days of the Condor belongs firmly a member of the 1970s paranoia trilogy.  They clearly foreshadow the much more recent, Enemy of the State (1998), directed by Tony Scott, in that they deal with the uncomfortable issue of the accountability, or otherwise, of non-elected government officials and the seemingly limitless paramilitary and technological power relinquished to their control by our supposedly responsible government representatives.

Condor is the official alter-ego of CIA operative, Joe Turner (Robert Redford).  Except this is no Howard Hunt or Gordon Liddy: we have bookworm Redford, a kind of nerdy golden-boy, losing out in the whos turn is it to get lunch stakes but winning in the context of the bigger picture!  He works, ostensibly, for an innocuous quango, The American Literary Historical Society which, in reality fronts for a CIA department that searches books, newspapers and other documentation for coded message communications to and from hostile foreign agencies. Basically Turner reads books for a living.  Returning from a trip to buy everyones lunch  there are only eight employees working in this New York townhouse  he finds, to his horror, all of his colleagues have been ruthlessly slaughtered, including his girlfriend.  Understandably spooked, he goes on the run and calls in to the CIA who tell him theyll bring him in: which is when he gets suspicious about who was responsible for the mass murder he just narrowly escaped.  He decides he needs time and a place to think, which is where the unfortunate Kathy Hale (Faye Dunaway), proves useful: a complete stranger, she just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.

The blu ray looks okay and is just about worth upgrading from the DVD.  What nails it are the three documentaries among the extras: one, a potted horrible history of the CIA and the odious Dulles brothers; another, a potted biography of Pollack the film-maker, and the third, a short exposition by Redford and Pollack on how the film project got going.

Its a beautifully shot film, by five times Oscar nominee, Owen Roizman, that makes full use of the luminosity of the two stars at its core, capturing Dunaways fragile beauty perfectly.  This, together with an exquisite score by Dave Grusin, and wryly amusing turns by both John Houseman and Max von Sydow, make it a uniquely pleasurable viewing experience.",1450310400,,2497,5.090686274509804

Redford is the only survivor of a massacre carried out at his place of work (he's a CIA analyst) and whilst on the run tries to solve the riddle before the worst happens to him. I won't give the ending away but the storyline is certainly absorbing. As conspiracy thrillers go this movie ranks up there with ""All The President's Men"" for compulsive viewing. 3 Days is a wonderful movie on a good quality DVD that in my opinion fully deserves a 5 star review rating.

The acting is very good, but that is not a surprise given the stars involved.

It is a government conspiracy movie, not a realistic depiction of espionage operations.

** beware: spoilers follow **

The star is a bookish lad who recently started working for the CIA at a covert location.

He goes off to lunch one day and comes back to find his entire office wiped out.

He moves out briskly trying to figure out what to do and who to trust.

In the end, it turns out that some bad, but senior officers in the CIA are trying to destabilize some countries without top cover.

Anyone who knows must be eliminated!

A good movie if you believe that the US government is bad and filled with amoral senior leaders.

It doesn't work for me.  I've worked with a lot of senior folks over the years throughout the US Federal government.  Nearly all of them are good hearted, smart people who deeply love the USA and moreover really believe in freedom as a core value.

286148,5,6300216748,This is one of my favorite movies. It shows how innocent actions unfold into a sequence of thrilling events. It depicts the complex world of intelligence units and spying. Robert Redford's acting is outstanding. Faye Dunaway also does a great job. It portrays the Stockholm syndrome in a clear way. Mas von Sydow plays the role of a hit-man (psychopath) that only obeys to specific instructions and has no emotional links to his victims or customers. Great movie,1442275200,,462,4.935897435897436

286150,4,6300216748,"Please bear in mind that this movie is more than 40 years old, and that it was a much different world than the one we live in today.  It's not a Schwarzeneggerian action adventure full of explosions and clever witticisms.  It's slow, it's dark, and you have to pay a little attention if you want to keep up.  If you accept that, then you will find that this is a very good movie.  It's not quite a classic, but if you like intelligent conspiracy movies, it should be right up your alley.

And yes, the romance/rape scene was pretty deplorable by todays standards, but again...movies were very different then.  If they ever remake this film (and I for one wouldn't mind if they did) then I'm sure that scene will be very, very different.  Please don't dismiss the rest of a very solid film because of how they handled one scene.",1441152000,,827,4.437086092715232

The acting is fine, but Redford's character's treatment of Faye Dunaway's character is deplorable. He terrorizes and abuses her, demanding (literally) that she be grateful he didn't rape her (only, you know, held her at gunpoint, invaded her home, tied her up, etc)... and then 20 minutes later he proceeds to do just that - rape her. He tells the terrified, crying woman that ""he only wants a few hours"" and proceeds to have sex with her without her consent. I guess because it's Robert Redford and he's hot it's okay?

286214,4,6300216748,"The book, Five Days of the Condor, was very good.  The film had to trim down the days for obvious reasons.

This film still holds up years after it was made -- during the cold war days when government (post-9/11) wasn't allowed to spy on its citizens for no reason -- although they did it anyway -- see J. Edgar Hoover's files!

Redford does a very nice job as the sort of average but very smart guy who just happens to be a nerd/geek for the CIA who reads and analyzes books for a living.  What a great job!  Faye Dunnaway gets dragged into his world when he kidnaps her while trying to avoid the guy who is trying to kill him and he needs to get away.  She ultimately helps him go after the truth.

The plot in this film is a bit convoluted.  It makes more sense in the book, but the film does a good job of making one feel a bit claustrophobic, a bit paranoid and a sense that Big Brother is either watching or might start watching at any moment.

Although the technology has changed dramatically over the years -- no cell phones -- no desktop or laptop computers -- the story itself still holds up.  This film is worth a look.",1431388800,3,1130,4.1658986175115205

286269,4,6300216748,"A revisit to an old film I enjoyed. This was filmed shortly after Watergate when conspiracies and hatred of the government was nationwide. Until that time, belief in government and its beaurocracies was strong, however, it soon changed.

Robert Redford plays a CIA operative, a little bit smarter and able to put one and two together. He is a reader for the CIA in a building listed as a Literary and Historical Society.  At that time, a secretary sat at the front desk and buzzed people in after looking at a monitor. Security was in a little hidden wall to her right. Not smart, when one day three men, one posed as a mailman walk in and shoot everyone in the building. All except, Redford's character known as the Condor. He comes back from picking up lunch to find the entire crew dead. He calls central headquarters and is told to meet in an alley in an hour. He runs into a man with a gun,mand he knows all is not well.

Condor kidnaps a young woman, steals her car and keeps her captive with him until he can figure things out. Of course, a romance develops, and she ends up assisting him. The woman us a young Faye Dunaway. As the film progresses Condor starts to figure things out, his  research has turned up a book translated into just three languages: Spanish, Dutch and Arabic. By the time we figure out those are the languages of major oil-exporting areas, he is on the run. Sharing info with his head cheese gives him a few steps ahead, and to the rescue comes a hitman. This is really an excellent spy thriller, written, well, acted well, and the tension remains high. It is a good film to revisit,especially since we have oil nations to blame for a war or two.

286273,4,6300216748,"In the day this was probably a lot better than it is now. Not because the movie itself lacks in any significant way but because the 'energy' landscape has change so much since then.

Here's the scoop. Condor (Robert Redford) works for the CIA as a reader. He scans books, articles and whatnot for things that might be plots or can be turned into plots. One day, while he's out getting lunch for the rest of the office, someone comes in and kills everyone. Now he needs to figure out who did it and why. He engages the help, against her will, of Faye Dunaway.

This is really quite good. It's an interesting idea that the CIA needs to go up against a guy who does nothing but read. He knows all kind of stuff to not only help him in his investigation but also to elude capture by them. He's a clever guy but knows he needs to step up his game and play as rough as those he's up against. His recruiting of Dunaway and their developing relationship is pretty cool as well. She's a photographer and her work says there's something wanting or lonely in her. Judging from a brief conversation she has with her boyfriend on the phone Redford might fill that want much better.

Cliff Robertson is the CIA guy trying to reel Condor in and Max Von Sydow is the hitman orchestrating the on the ground doings. Both do a fine job. Dunaway is gorgeous and plays her role well. Redford has his usual hairstyle and is good enough. Dave Grusin penned a nice music score and Sydney Pollock was already a veteran director when he helmed this. His talent is unquestionable.

The only downside is the end, and again, it was probably good in its day, but those days have changed so it no longer has the impact it once did. This is definitely worth seeing so don't let me put you off. Have at it.",1426377600,,1773,4.315315315315315

286372,4,6300216748,"I recently viewed ""Three Days of the Condor"" for the first time in over a decade and had forgotten what a fascinating film it is. The 1975 suspense thriller has aged well, a subtle tribute to the brooding espionage epics of yore including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casablanca/dp/B002VWNIAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casablanca</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Third-Man-Blu-ray/dp/B003ULW74S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Third Man [Blu-ray</a>]. But the film's issues are unusually contemporary, including governmental greed and wars created for the purpose of securing oil.

It's a beautiful production, not just because Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway are at their peak of alluring prowess, but the late-great director Sydney Pollack always had a creative eye when making his respectable entertainments. He won an Oscar for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Out-of-Africa/dp/B001VLKWUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Out of Africa</a>, but I argue this is his greatest film, along with his all-time classic comedy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tootsie/dp/B000I9X53W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tootsie</a>. He worked well with Redford, most famously in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Way-We-Were/dp/B000W453KQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Way We Were</a>&nbsp;and the touching western&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jeremiah-Johnson/dp/B0030CV22A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jeremiah Johnson</a>. ""Three Days of the Condor"" is trademark Pollack, spiced with an excellent musical score by his favorite composer Dave Grusin.

Based on the popular James Grady novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Six-Days-of-the-Condor/dp/B0064T4ZPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Six Days of the Condor</a>, Redford plays Joe Turner, a youthful New York intellect adorned in stocking cap zooming through traffic on what appears to be an electric bicycle. He works for the innocently named American Literary Historical Society, a minor branch of the CIA. He and his colorful, shaggy-haired co-workers sip coffee, debate and read international spy novels looking for potential clues. Redford's character is literally out to lunch when a team of assassins executes everyone in the office. In perhaps the film's best scene, he returns to a dreadfully silent building to find all of his friends dead.

Trembling with paranoia, he calls the CIA office by pay phone (of course) and is connected to a suspicious director played with cool menace by Cliff Robertson. A rendezvous is set up so they can ""bring him in."" Redford's Turner, who has evidently been on the job several years reading about just such situations, knows full well he is expendable.

Eventually he's on the run and forced to randomly kidnap a woman on a New York street. That he is fortunate enough to find a loner who looks like Dunaway is pure Hollywood, even if their scenes together crackle with sexual tension. Here be two of the most attractive stars in history, performing on the storied stage of 1970's cinema. It should be noted they are being stalked by an assassin-for-hire, brilliantly played by Max Von Sydow in a performance that almost steals the film.

""Three Days of the Condor"" has been packaged into a clique of paranoid thrillers of the era including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Parallax-View/dp/B000I3SVT6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Parallax View</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-The-President-s-Men/dp/B000I3U2WU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All The President's Men</a>. I'm not sure this film is on the same level of eerie contemplation, even if the concluding scene will chill you to the bone. It does predate our troubles with the Middle East by decades, not to mention a considerable amount of action taking place within the World Trade Centers. The result is a work that has evolved into an uncomfortable thriller, with a taste as pleasurable as fine wine, a reminder of just how great this era of American filmmaking was.",1423008000,,4331,7.0278293135436

286387,5,6300216748,"3 Days of the Condor Blu ray: Let me start by saying that the Blu ray picture and sound quality is fantastic. I normally worry about Blu ray movies from 1970s and 80s as my experience tells me that sometimes production companies simply copy the standard DVD onto a Blu ray disc which results in poor picture quality (ok, so the pixels are 1290 to 1080 but this doesn't necessarily mean great picture quality). I was very pleased with 3 Days of the Condor picture and sound quality.

The movie: I remember seeing this long time ago in my 20s but I was surprised to notice how similar the plot is to Bourne Identity. I am not kidding, this movie and Bourne Identity could have been put together in a double-feature disc. I am not sure which novel was written first but similarities are eerie. In both movies, there is a secret service agent being pursued by his own people and at the same time trying to figure out a mystery regarding his own organization. In both movies, he kidnaps a woman with whom he later develops a romantic connection. Probably the biggest difference is that Bourne begins with an amnesia not remembering his own identity. Aside from that, both movies are very similar. But they are both unique in their own way.

I definitely recommend this movie to anybody who is interested in spy thrillers; this is one of the best examples of the genre. It doesn't have the same pace and action sequences as Bourne movies, but the story, the characters, they all hold up pretty well. I also enjoy seeing Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway in their best (Faye Dunaway also starred in Network, which is one of my favorite movies from that time, and Robert Redford in All President's Men, another great movie). Another interesting thing, I noticed, is all the shots of the world trade center. It is a great nostalgia and somehow sad at the same time to see the world trade center in the 70s",1421193600,3,1894,4.535087719298246

286439,4,6300216748,"This movie's reputation has slid a little over the years; neither is it so widely viewed. I wonder why? My only guess is that the film-makers took a first-rate thriller and tried to dumb it down for mainstream Hollywood audiences. Connoisseurs will say it could have been better; the average guy looking for something to watch on Friday night will pass it by.

The premise is first-rate. Redford steps out of the office to get some lunch. When he gets back, everyone else in the office is massacred and already he's on the run. Many people from within the CIA contact, but he learns quickly that most or none of them are to be trusted. In a sinister twist of fate, the one person he can rely on for accurate information is the guy who's been trying to kill him for the whole movie.

Max von Sydow was the best choice for the opaque and sinister Mr. Joubert. All the way to the end of the movie, we can't completely read his intentions. Max von Sydow manages to convey this menacing character with no exaggeration or scenery-chewing whatsoever. It's a master performance.

The only possible weakness in the movie might be Faye Dunaway. She's a wonderful actress who can play a wide range of emotions, but I'm not sure vulnerability is one of them. Redford is a classic smoothie who puts all of his charms into seducing her for his own purposes. I don't think their ad hoc relationship is completely satisfying, however.

Finally, the fight scenes in the movie are very dated. Redford and one of Joubert's heavies get into a tussle that looks more like a delicately choreographed ballet performance than a fight between government agents. A generation used to the glories of The Bourne Trilogy will have trouble taking it seriously.

Other than those caveats, you can't go wrong with this movie. At the very least, see it for Max von Sydow's performance and relish his old-school menace.",1418515200,,1885,4.682779456193353

I mean they were supposed to be young, just-out-of-college, 25-year-old-something, and yet it was clear they were in their 40s.  Also, the bad guy behind the scenes was too far removed from the plot - He was only shown in the last scene.  I think that the movie would have been better if John Houseman had been the bad guy pulling the strings; he certainly was the one in most of the scenes!  Another deficit was that alot of the movie was just spent on the actors doing nothing but running around town and what an ugly town New York City was - and I imagine still is today.",1415404800,,720,4.311111111111111

286500,5,6300216748,"THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR is a complex suspenseful political thriller directed by Sydney Pollack. A shroud of relentless paranoia permeates the entire film from beginning to end. It is set primarily in New York City and Washington DC and this adds to the drama in a very credible way. Robert Redford is a CIA research reader. He reads books and all forms of written material essentially looking for ideas that his branch may find useful. He reads everything and reports anything pertinent with his team he is stationed with. Things go very wrong and he soon finds that he is a man on the run and he is a target. Why? That is what he has to find out and turn his situation around if he can.

Besides Robert Redford, the cast includes Faye Dunaway, Cliff Robertson, John Houseman, Patrick Gorman and Max von Sydow. Redford's character is full of energy and once he directs that energy for his very survival, he becomes a very formidable player in the world of covert affairs. Interestingly, Max von Sydow has such a subtle yet incredibly powerful screen presence. On screen he effortlessly puts Robert Redford's energy and daring aside with such ease that you will be amazed. Max von Sydow's performance is brilliant and he steals every frame of this film that he is in. And on another note, Sydney Pollack once more proves he was on of the cinema's best directors.",1414972800,,1362,4.651452282157677

286503,5,6300216748,"This is one of Sydney Pollack's 1970s films that put him on the map as a major film director. He and Redford would continue to make films together for years. Redford plays a quiet analyst for the CIA who doesn't do any of the flashy stuff. One day he goes out the back entrance to pick up lunch(one no one else knows about) and by the time he gets back, his entire building of agents has been gunned down. They were in a small building where they posed as a bunch of historical researchers. This wasn't that far off as they spent all day every day reading reports.

Redford has a big problem because he realizes very quickly that the gunmen must come from inside the CIA as they knew the setup of the building too well. It was only by using the exit he shouldn't have used that he escaped their notice.

He realizes that the minute the gunmen realize they missed one, they will come after him. So he is on the run but he has no experience out in the field. He needs help so takes Faye Dunaway hostage. That is where the film's chemistry really takes off. The two of them are just fantastic together. I've seen this film several times and it never gets old. I tried reading the book once but it lacked the chemistry of the film so I didn't finish the book.

The kidnapped woman, Kathy Hale, is a photographer who ends up believing Condor and aids him in figuring who is behind his problems.

Cliff Robertson plays CIA New York section chief J, Higgins and the cold blooded contract killer Jourbert is played by Max Von Sydow. Directed by Sydney Pollack all performances are outstanding and the film is a first rate thriller.

In spite of its age, this film is believable and perhaps more believable now than ever. The film does not end with everything being all right. It is more realistic that that. Highly recommended.",1409270400,,947,4.698795180722891

As Redford's character flees the ruthless and systematic termination of all those who might stand in the way of a rogue force in his own camp, survival for him is also at stake .  A chance encounter with a female desperado of a different kind grips both of them in a sudden turbulence of lives flowing uncontrollably toward their various fates.

286602,4,6300216748,"Somehow, I missed this thriller from the early 1970s, but I finally caught it through Amazon Prime. It was well worth the time. It has a simple premise that is presented well , along with a great cast. Redford is solid in the lead as a low-level CIA analyst whose section (disguised as a historical society) is hit by unknown assailants. His struggle to ""come in"" safely, figure out who did the killing and whom to trust propel the story along. The technology used to do the spying must have been cutting edge for the time period and I was fascinated by a suspenseful spy drama that did not need huge action sequences to pay off. The characters and their relationships stay in the foreground in CONDOR. The ending comes to a satisfying conclusion and provides just enough ambiguity to make it resonate after the credits roll.
Faye Dunaway, Cliff Robertson and Max con Sydow make for excellent support of Robert Redford.
On a side note: NYC, circa 73/74 is also a character in the film as well as the main setting. Seeing the city as it was then, with the prominent World Trade Center Towers, give the movie an extra chill-factor.",1406937600,,1129,4.594059405940594

286660,4,6300216748,"Sidney Pollack's 1975 ""Three Days of the Condor"" is an effectively slick contribution to two of the sub-genres of thriller -- the trials and tribulations of the low-level operative who discovers a conspiracy, and the story of an apparently ordinary man who finds within himself unlikely resources and skills.  The protagonist of this mixture is Joe Turner (Robert Redford), a desk-bound low-level CIA operative who does nothing but read (anything, everything) and look for clues about possible encoded enemy plans that might harm the US.  He finds something worth reporting and reports it, and in pretty short order, all members of the team with whom he works are killed, Joe himself being lucky enough to have been out of the office buying lunch for his group.  He discovers the carnage when he gets back with the sandwiches.  Joe knows the chain of command to which he reports, so he figures out that something is rotten in ""the company"" and he takes steps to find out what that is before he can be tracked down by the hit squad who killed his fellow-workers.  It's a situation where, although he is in touch with his chain of command, he fears that he cannot trust any of them.  The suspense of the movie comes from the ingenious and very careful ways in which Joe protects himself, while making progress on finding out what's going on.  I'll say no more about the plot, in case there are folks out there who have yet to see the movie, beyond saying that it is well-worked out and that the suspense is well-maintained.  Redford is hardly stretched by the demands of the role, but he is effective and appealing as the puzzled and antsy hero.

The plot has affinities with Le Carre's kind of stories from the 1970's, but where in Le Carre one is made aware not only of the issues of trust but of the morally compromised status of the ""good guys,"" in this movie the focus is exclusively on trust, and it remains so until the end.  The trust issue plays most obviously into the suspensefulness of the movie, and that is where Pollack is happy to leave it.  What makes the movie a bit more than just a well-oiled piece of machinery, however, is the role of Kathy Hale (Faye Dunaway), a woman whom Joe grabs at gunpoint and forces to drive him to a safe place.  He has to convince her that he's on the side of the angels, and eventually she believes him and becomes his abettor in his scheme to get at the truth.  Kathy is a photographer, who seems to be in a troubled relationship.  A history is hinted that gives her the possibility of a bit more depth than the other characters, and Dunaway suggests that quality of interestingness by look and gesture -- she is arguably the most interesting character in the movie.

The other potentially interesting character is Joubert, a hit man (arrestingly played by Max von Sydow).  His relation to the CIA is one of the things that Joe has to figure out to protect his own life.  I say ""potentially interesting"" because the part is underwritten -- deliberately, I think, to enable a twist at the end to be brought off.  So . . . an entertaining movie, with good music (Dave Grusin) and some lovely New York and Brooklyn settings.  It resists being what we would now call an ""action movie,"" and that's all to the good.",1404604800,,3258,4.5479452054794525

You you may find yourself belly laughing at Cliff Robertson"" hat, pimp daddy coat and bad toupee. If you think Redford is a good actor, this may very well change your mind. If you were not around in the 70s, this movie may seem goofy to you, if you were, nostalgia time.  All that said, this is worth watching.

The story line reveals itself slowly from the opening moments, developing the characters and interactions of an office work place soon to be interrupted by an unexpected attack.

286685,5,6300216748,"The mid-60's going into the 70's were a turbulent time for political thrillers. Americans were quickly losing faith in their government. JFK was assassinated, his assassin was assassinated, Bobby Kennedy was assassinated, Vietnam was a train-wreck, and Watergate seemed to be the straw that broke the camels back. Alan J. Pakula was at the forefront of the political thriller genre with his trilogy Klute, The Parallax View, and All The President's Men. Francis Ford Coppola's 1974 film The Conversation is another notable entry in the genre. In 1975, Sydney Pollack, hot of the trail of his two diverse hits, Jeremiah Johnson and The Way We Were, joined the ranks of Pakula and Coppola with his paranoid thriller, Three Days of the Condor. Based on a novel by James Grady, the film follows Condor, a CIA 'reader' who is on a quest for truth after he discovers that his office building was raided and all of his coworkers were killed. In typical fashion of the genre, 3DOTC chooses a suspicious atmosphere in lieu of straight-forward storytelling. To complement the paranoid aura of the screenplay, cinematographer Owen Roizman creates a wonderfully dark world to accompany the characters. Roizman, who also worked on The Exorcist and Network, is no stranger to grim material. Through low lighting and sharp camerawork, he achieves the ambience needed to convey the unease to the audience. Robert Redford, a frequent collaborator of Pollack's, works wonders as the Condor. Redford never collapses under the paranoia, and his strong screen presence adds much needed realism to his character's determination. Faye Dunaway plays Kathy with a surprising amount of subtlety. Unfortunately, the romance between her and Condor comes off as completely unnecessary steam in an otherwise taut film. Max von Sydow is truly brilliant as the complex CIA-hired assassin, Joubert. His uncharacteristic cordiality makes him an endlessly compelling character and von Sydow is physically perfect for the role of a considerate assassin. The music is one of the film's only missteps. Why use funk/jazz fusion in a movie that is trying to induce paranoia in the viewer? Other than that, Pollack's effort fits snugly in the string of exceptional post-Watergate thrillers.",1402358400,,2249,5.25

286702,2,6300216748,"liked the first act, Robert Redford is great, but couldn't buy the Faye Dunaway character as bound-captive-to-sex-partner-to-kidnapper accomplice, not as written, and not over the course of a few days. first, you're a woman living alone and a man kidnaps you. terrifying, absolutely terrifying. you don't know whether he will cut you into little tiny pieces and that you'll never be heard from again. then, in the course of that kidnapping, you and he have sex. the film shows it to be consensual, but I so do not believe that. I'm a woman. Robert Redford is one of the most handsome men I've ever seen, but I don't care if the most handsome, seductive angel came down from heaven (for the sake of this argument, let's agree that there are angels and that there is a heaven), I am not having sex with him. a person would be too traumatized from being bound and kidnapped to be able to make a sensible decision. the Faye Dunaway character is too traumatized to make a rational decision with regards to taking a lover and so, to me, their intercourse is a continuation of the Robert Redford character's violence against her. then, after apparently enjoying sex with him, and after they are both attacked by a hitman and Robert Redford protects her, she believes what he's been telling her and agrees to help him, instead of escaping. hogwash. a more believable story would've been to not have these two characters have sex. he could have kidnapped her, which would've been bad enough, gone to her apartment and everything could've played out except for the sex. then have the hitman attack them at the apartment. somehow have the Faye Dunaway character no longer bound (the storytellers would have to figure how this happened), and after the Faye Dunaway character sees for herself that he's telling the truth, and see's that he protected her during the attack, it'd be okay for her to lose some of her fear of him, but not all her fear because she wouldn't know this guy and what is going on; heck even he doesn't know what's going on. And for sure, she would not agree to help him kidnap another person; how the writer even came up with that is beyond me. A victimized woman, morphs into a lover, morphs into a criminal herself? On what basis? She'd have to be established as a risk taker for this to be even remotely believable. Robert Redford is handsome in this movie, but there is not a man handsome enough to move a rational lawabiding woman not under the influence of drugs, into a criminal after one sexual experience over the course of a day or two - and especially not a woman the age of the character Ms. Dunaway plays in this film: she's at least 35 and long past the age of silly romanticism and ignorance of men. Thirty five year old women are not experts on men, but the average 35 year old woman would not behave as the Faye Dunaway character behaves with regards to having sex with her kidnapper and after a day or two helping him kidnap another. She has her own apartment, presumably her own income, appears to be sane and not on drugs, so why in the world would she throw in her lot with him? makes no sense. So her character kills this story for me even though the actors/actresses are all great. 2 and 1/2 stars.",1401667200,2,3232,4.526495726495726

All of these films contain the idea that an evil government agency is out to get you and you better run.  And you better run with a hot chick whom you tie up and abuse until she decides you're okay and has sex with you because you understand her.  Robert Redford plays a nerd (yeah, right) working for a CIA book reading section.  When his section is slaughtered by a dead-eyed postman and a stolid foreign guy while Turner is out getting lunch, the fun begins.  Something's wrong at the CIA.  Turner is being tailed.  Cliff Robertson can't eat a sandwich without being disturbed.  John Houseman makes judgements at a table.  Faye Dunaway takes pictures of empty benches.  This all should be great fun, but somehow, this film drags to it's inevitable conclusion.  So the CIA wants oil.  Big news, there chum.

The written screenplay had to make sense with ALL the characters and their individual motives. It's eerie and strange to see the WTC buildings in the film, but they just add mystic to the film. I doubt they could make another film like this today, it couldn't get past the young age demographics. There's not enough zombie action, transformers or aliens for their taste.

Modern films such as Minority Report (also starring Max Von Sydow) and the Bourne Identity just heighten the tension and move along more quickly. I am sure this film had an influence on them though and it is good to have seen.

Good acting, But the most interesting is the contrast of early 70's technology to today. Phone booths, and computers with programming cards, and Redford's character begging for ""computer time"" really dates it. But it is fun to watch, Dunaway was stunning. Her acting was ok too, but the role was a bit strange. The ""love interest"" that did leave an opening if there were sequels. Well paced entertainment.

You need to take some lessons from Netflix.
First you don't have closed caption for ALL of you titles.
Next the menu of Genre titles on the computer is different from the menu on the television, as well as the location of titles. Very confusing.
There is no place to set up a list of titles you want to view in the future. Such as the ""my list"" on Netflix.

My one complaint is the pathetic romantic subplot. They did a terrible job of developing that aspect of the film (can't speak for the novel since I haven't read it), so it just comes off as gratuitous and awkward. If you're a screenwriter, see this movie for how NOT to do it. See The Bourne Identity's Jason and Marie plot line for comparison.",1393891200,,566,4.4423076923076925

286872,5,6300216748,"I'm not a big Redford fan. His acting is often too wooden for me. But he was perfect here, and so was Dunaway. One of Sydney Pollack's best. Great soundtrack, too.

The times, they were a-changin'.... This time period was on the heels of Watergate and the Church Committee. We the people could believe almost anything about the duplicity of our politicians and government institutions. The CIA assassinating its own? Sure. Why not? It's not paranoia if they're really out to get you. Thus begins a race against time for Redford's character, Joe Turner, to root out the corruption and, not coincidentally, try to stay alive.

Part of the plot suspense is watching Redford and Dunaway's characters evolve and try to figure out who to trust, including each other. There's a nice little twist involving Max von Sydow's character, Joubert. Then there's that ambiguous freeze-frame ending. Given the times, though, the heroes in popular culture were usually reporters (as in Redford's other high-profile role at the time, All the President's Men, directed by Alan Pakula). Speaking of reporters...

This film makes a nice bookend to another classic '70s paranoid spy thriller starring Warren Beatty as... wait for it... a reporter! If you prefer your paranoia darker and more cynical, your multinational corporations even more corrupt than government agencies, your villains more transparently evil, then The Parallax View (also directed by Alan Pakula) is the film for you.

286901,5,6300216748,"I love this movie. It is so evocative. When I watched it today for the umpteenth time, I couldn't help but notice the things that screamed '70s to me. Mopeds, the National Bell system (before the breakup into the baby bells), computers taking up whole rooms and saving data on rolls of magnetic tape and printing on sprocket-fed paper, phone books, dial TVs with rabbit ears and no remotes, store clerks calling in a customer""s credit card over the phone to get authorization. It was a simpler time and easy to think Condor could fade into the crowd without being tracked. I doubt such a movie could be made today. Also worth noting - this movie features prominent shots of the brand-spanking new World Trade Center from the outside, from the lobby and from one of the higher offices. Eerie, especially considering one of the main plot points which I won't give away here. Also interesting - this is a case where life imitated art - after the KGB became aware of this film, they actually created a large agency to do just what Condor's section did. Pollack is a great director and this movie is a masterpiece in the spy thriller genre. It's not an action-packed punchfest/shootout, but it's not slow either. The action is just right and it fits the plot - nothing gratuitous here. It's interspersed with quiet, introspective moments which provide a nice contrast. And the ending leaves you with some disconcerting questions about absolute power. It's the thinking man's spy movie. It's the first spy movie featuring a ""regular joe"" instead of a polished professional (a la James Bond). Even though he ""only reads books"", he's whip smart and would make a great field agent. I can't think of any other spy thriller quite like it. Highly recommended.",1393027200,,1747,4.768976897689769

286938,5,6300216748,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo Nest swept the Academy Awards in 1976 when Three Days of the Condor (TDOTC) came out but this Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway thriller should have at least been given a nod for either Best Picture or Best Actor.  If you like cloak and dagger, spy stories that pick you up out of your seat, and carry you along on a whirlwind of intrigue, treachery, and overstepping government bureaucrats this is the seminary film that similar films are measured.  You can't say it any better than this: superb acting by Redford, Dunaway, Max von Sydow, Cliff Robertson and John Houseman.  In particular, von Sydow as the intellectual, charming, sophisticated but heartless killer keeps you spellbound and never sure of his next move.  One minute he's out to kill you and the next, offers you a ride into the city.  First rate stuff.  Both Redford and Dunaway are at the top of their game and their portrayal of a studious spy and average woman are right on the mark.  The unexpected opening action scene, that leaves Redford's character in a bind, and out in the cold, sets the stage for the rest of the film--who can he trust and when can he trust them.  Back then, the idea of the U.S. Government carrying out assassinations against U.S. citizens seemed hard to believe but now, TDOTC rings too true. We trust the Government a lot less now than we did then.  All in all, if you haven't seen this film--you have missed out on a truly marvelous gem of a film and I would recommend it to everyone.

Second, his ability to outwit everyone from assassin squads to his own CIA section chief comes down to ""he reads books"". Third, the romance mixed with stark black-and-white images may really be making a statement about the need for connection (fill in any Paul Simon song here) - but this short-term fling between the sometimes violent and rattled agent and the Bohemian girl gives a weird Stockholm Syndrome feel to the film.

Watching again, for the first time in 38 years, I realize now just how far back the ""War for Oil"" BS lies go and understand better why the Anti-American American has become so prevalent in our society. Leftist elitists love this genre and will continue making these Marxist propaganda films to ""re-educate"" Americans. Why? Because it works. Question: How can one get Americans ready and willing to give up their rights? By making them believe we are the worst country in history, of course.
It's simple folks. When they keep making these propaganda films (Ala Dr. Goebbels) telling the entire world ""America will do anything, tell any lie, kill anyone, START A WAR, for it's own greedy benefit!!!"" and you do so for DECADES, how can the entire world NOT come to believe the lie?

Maybe technology has passed it by (I used to work with those computers at the beginning), but the story and issues are still relevant today... murder, CIA and oil in the middle east.

Not much of a hit at the box office in 1975 as it was up against Jaws/Cuckoo's Nest/Rocky Horror.  (Nominated for editing.)
This was made in a time where you didn't need crazy stunts and blow everything up; don't look for a chase scene here.  Its a smart film and expects you to be smart and pay attention.  It doesn't show you a clock that's been shot when a still burning cigarette on a dead woman is better.

Suspense, intrigue, betrayal and feelings of isolation flow effortlessly in and out of the story.  The plot twists confuse the ""book reader"" spy but some basic easy tricks enable him to stay alive and figure it all out.  Extensive character and relationship development allow the audience to be uncritical of some of the action later.  Contrasting the audience's high anxiety during contact with a completely relaxed Joubert is done very well.  I particularly like the dialog after Attwood's study scene where the relationship has shifted and Turner gets his gun, advice and a ride.  (and the advice is right on)

Can't say that I like the end (only 4 stars) but this was just after Watergate so people were waking up to Government oversight and the NY Times was a weapon.  Its better than Turner just getting killed.

While it has a bit more detail, there is noticeable film grain--in some cases significant grain.  Some scenes actually look out-of-focus at times.  It is difficult to know whether the issue was with the transfer, the condition of the source materials or simply the way it was filmed.  Colors are not strong--a feature of many movies from that era.  The sound was adequate, but nothing special.

287211,5,6300216748,"THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR is a complex suspenseful political thriller directed by Sydney Pollack. A shroud of relentless paranoia permeates the entire film from beginning to end. It is set primarily in New York City and Washington DC and this adds to the drama in a very credible way. Robert Redford is a CIA research reader. He reads books and all forms of written material essentially looking for ideas that his branch may find useful. He reads everything and reports anything pertinent with his team he is stationed with. Things go very wrong and he soon finds that he is a man on the run and he is a target. Why? That is what he has to find out and turn his situation around if he can. Besides Robert Redford, the cast includes Faye Dunaway, Cliff Robertson, John Houseman, Patrick Gorman and Max von Sydow. Redford's character is full of energy and once he directs that energy for his very survival, he becomes a very formidable player in the world of covert affairs. Interestingly, Max von Sydow has such a subtle yet incredibly powerful screen presence. On screen he effortlessly puts Robert Redford's energy and daring aside with such ease that you will be amazed. Max von Sydow's performance is brilliant and he steals every frame of this film that he is in.

The film is effectively directed by Sydney Pollack who would work with Redford many times, including later on ""Out of Africa"" where Redford's character was over-shadowed by Meryl Streep's.  The script of ""Three Days of the Condor"" is based on a book by James Grady and written by Lorenzo Semple, Jr. (""Pretty Poison"" and TV's ""Batman"") and David Rayfiel.  The film is somewhat dated, but quite relevant even now and makes riveting entertainment at any age.  Also excellent in the film are Faye Dunaway and Max von Sydow.

287306,4,6300216748,"Three Days of the Condor, 1975 film

The story begins in an office building. A man rides a motor scooter in city traffic. A man in an automobile watches people enter this office. [It looks like an old mansion converted to offices.] Workers talks about a novel. What productive work do they do? One worker goes out to lunch by an unauthorized exit. A postman approaches the door. People are shot down with a silenced sub-machine gun! When the man returns from lunch he finds the bodies. Turner takes a pistol for defense as he leaves the building. [This tells about that era.] He telephones in the news and receives instructions. A cleaning crew arrives to tidy up the mess and confirm the report. Condor stays on the street until he visits another victim. Turner is warned about two visitors to his flat!

A known friend is used for identification when they meet. But something goes wrong! Condor flies away and enters a store. He says hello to Kathy and takes over her car, she drives to Brooklyn Heights (a trendy location). Upper level management discuss this problem (Condor was blamed by Wicks). He explains his work: reading adventure stories and putting them into a computer so they can be checked against real operations. [Sort of like this review?] The assassin reports to his employer. Wicks will be done next. [Can you believe everything you see on TV?] Turner goes to visit a friend's wife. He takes the elevator down, and gets people to accompany him to his car. Is the license plate read? Turner returns to Kathy in Brooklyn Heights, they talk about things. The next morning Turner read a memo copied to Wicks. Two nurses monitor a patient in the hospital; the warning buzzer goes on. A mailman shows up with a package that has to be signed for. [Note the trick to gain entrance.] Are his shoes unusual? Turner survives, then telephones Washington. We see the Twin Towers in lower Manhattan.

Kathy goes to an office building. She is unescorted (believable?). Kathy delivers a message to Addison, who gets to meet Turner for a talk. Wicks died in the hospital. Turner knows how to trace a key to a hotel. Next a phone message is traced. Turner learns a fact and acts on it. He visits the Deputy Director of Operations. Is there a connection between those locations? That Alsatian shows up to perform his job. Attwood won't embarrass his employers. Turner is warned what could happen back in New York city. He meets Addison, who speaks to him about plans and games. What happens if there are future shortages? Turner wrote a report and gave it to a newspaper. [Like the ""Pentagon Papers""?] Will they print it? Who knows? [Their Board of Directors cooperate with Government agencies at times.]

Some scenes were filmed in downtown Manhattan next to the World Trade Center Twin Towers. The idea of a novel that could echo a real intelligence operation is interesting. I'm sure some novels could, a work of fiction is better if is based on reality. ""Double Indemnity"" was said to be based on the Snyder-Gray murder (a husband bumped off to free the wife). But wasn't there a story in the Bible about King David? I liked this movie better when I first say it in 1975. Parts of it seem implausible today. How much danger can come from a low-selling novel?

He reads books and all forms of written material essentially looking for ideas that his branch may find useful. He reads everything and reports anything pertinent with his team he is stationed with.

Redford did a fabulous job, and Dunaway was incredible.  The storyline was unique, and the characterization was believable.  Instead of a highly trained and skilled marksman for an operative that went around shooting up everyone in sight, we got a normal-Joe type CIA employee who was barely qualified with any weapon--other than his mind.

287343,4,6300216748,"I liked the movie, but there was something that bothered me.

I thought that the movie was a very accurate prediction of what has actually happened in the middle east, about thirty years later.  In the ending, Redford raised the question about whether we would invade the middle east over oil, and that is exactly what happened.  Even Cliff Robertson's argument that the plan would work and that the people won't care, they will just want our government to ""get oil"" was eerily predictive of what what this country did.

The part that bothered me was, whatever happened to the mail man that Redford killed in Dunaway's apartment?  how did she explain to her boyfriend (when they returned from heir skiing trip) what that body was doing in her living room and what were all those bullet hole in her apartment all about?",1372809600,2,818,4.6923076923076925

Your classic hero who is not a macho guy but is smart and doesn't play by the rules.  The story touches on many of the fears we have today about Big Brother operating illegally within our country and what could happen if you expose any of it.  Robert Redford's character gets caught in the middle as a reader for the CIA, a seemingly mundane, safe job.  He stumbles onto something he shouldn't have uncovered.  Once he goes on the run he is hunted down by the very government that is supposed to be protecting him.  The assassin who is contracted by the CIA is a brilliant character and has some twists and turns in the movie you don't expect.  All the way around this movie will grab you and take you on a ride.  It strikes at the heart of many controversial issues with our government today, making this almost a perfect movie to watch as we read in the news today.",1371945600,,1046,4.317948717948718

The movie is a reflection of the times as you will notice right away with the clothing, music, and cinematography. However it was not cheesy or a detractor of any sort.

If you are fascinated by the subject of espionage and intelligence, aka, the CIA, as movie subject matter, you will no doubt enjoy this movie. Robert Redford's character is tenacious without being overbearing. His search for the truth makes him a target to be dealt with, and quickly, but by whom, or what?

This review is ambiguous for a reason. Watch the movie and you will find yourself drawn into a world of code names and self-indulgent motive from start to finish.",1371859200,,815,4.575342465753424

287371,5,6300216748,"Three Days of the Condor has always been one of my top 10 movies.  It has seemed realistic in that the number of people involved in the conspiracy was small, no one (not even those involved) really quite knew what was going on (or  much cared), and everything did not end cleanly.  The character played by Max von Sydow is one of my favorite villains, and the ""it will happen this way"" (about not accepting a ride) speech one of my favorite speeches.
  One quibble though: ladies too, do not get in the car! : If someone comes up to you and points a gun at you, throw the keys away, scream and run!  You may get shot, but the people around will call 911.  If you get in the car with him, even if he looks like Robert Redford, you will likely die after some very bad things happen to you.  Do NOT get in the car!
  Given today's technology compared to the antiquated systems in the film, this scenario could very well happen; and in fact, the central mystery which everyone was trying to hide HAS happened.

287403,5,6300216748,"THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR is a complex suspenseful political thriller directed by Sydney Pollack. A shroud of relentless paranoia permeates the entire film from beginning to end. It is set primarily in New York City and Washington DC and this adds to the drama in a very credible way. Robert Redford is a CIA research reader. He reads books and all forms of written material essentially looking for ideas that his branch may find useful. He reads everything and reports anything pertinent with his team he is stationed with. Things go very wrong and he soon finds that he is a man on the run and he is a target. Why? That is what he has to find out and turn his situation around if he can. Besides Robert Redford, the cast includes Faye Dunaway, Cliff Robertson, John Houseman, Patrick Gorman and Max von Sydow. Redford's character is full of energy and once he directs that energy for his very survival, he becomes a very formidable player in the world of covert affairs. Interestingly, Max von Sydow has such a subtle yet incredibly powerful screen presence.  On screen he effortlessly puts Robert Redford's energy and daring aside with such ease that you will be amazed. Max von Sydow's performance is brilliant and he steals every frame of this film that he is in. And on another note, Sydney Pollack once more proves he was on of the cinema's best directors.",1369785600,,1362,4.651452282157677

And I've always been a really big fan of Mr. Redford's, so I always watch his films whenever I get the chance.

I have to admit, this film came across as a little too conspiracy theory to me.  Naturally, in a political thriller, you need the ""good guys"" and you need the ""bad guys,"" and so the screenplay decided to use some of the people who were supposed to be ""good guys"" and made them the ""bad guys.""  You always need conflict to make any film work, and so they had to go the conspiracy-theory route to achieve that conflict.  It could also be argued that they threw in the Redford-Dunaway matchup just because American audiences always seem to demand a love interest -- something that can really get in the way of good filmmaking, and it surely tries to do that here -- so that argument might be valid.  However, I do have to admit that there was some real chemistry between Ms. Dunaway and Mr. Redford.

Still, a pretty good movie, minus perhaps for some of the music.  For me, more like a 3.5.  But I'll round up because of the outstanding cast.",1362441600,,1862,4.445427728613569

Joseph Turner (Redford) works for a CIA unit assigned to glean through books and periodicals looking for signs of anything nefarious or suspicious.  Operating out of a low profile office in New York City, Turner leaves the building to get lunch for his co-workers.  When he returns, finds that they have all been shot dead.

Following protocol, a shaken Turner phones the CIA, and identifies himself by his codename ""Condor"".  Eventually he speaks to deputy director Higgins (Cliff Robertson), who arranges a meeting to bring Turner into headquarters.  The rendezvous in a back alley turns out to be a double-cross, but the bookwormish Condor manages to shoot his would be assassin.

Desperate, and in need of a place to hide, Turner abducts a woman named Kathy Hale (Faye Dunaway), and forces her to take him to her home.  Turner later ties Kathy up, and leaves to visit someone that he feels may be in danger.  On this excursion he meets Joubert (Max von Sydow), the leader of the hit squad that murdered his friends.  Joubert is there to kill him, but Turner's remarkable instincts for survival once again saves his life, and eventually leads to his uncovering the truth.

Three Days of the Condor is a brilliant mix of violence, paranoia, and intrigue, that fits perfectly within context of the cover-ups and political dirty tricks of the Watergate era.  The dialog is sharp, and always appropriate.  The story is nicely paced, and mostly stays within the bounds of reality, with the major weak point perhaps being the relationship that so quickly develops between Hale and Turner, as she becomes an overly willing ally.  With an amazing ability to put the pieces together, and adapt to various situations, Turner is someone that you get totally behind.

The cast is loaded with Academy Award winners and nominees.  Robert Redford gives a brilliant and believable performance, as a desperate and resourceful, man on the run.  The perfectly cast Max von Sydow (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Exorcist/dp/B001992NW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Exorcist</a>, The Quiller Memorandum), is fabulous.  Faye Dunaway (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bonnie-and-Clyde/dp/B002VWNIAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bonnie and Clyde</a>, Network, Chinatown, The Thomas Crown Affair,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Eyes-Of-Laura-Mars/dp/B004DFQ6SI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Eyes Of Laura Mars</a>) demonstrates again why she was one of the top actresses of her era.  Cliff Robertson (Man on a Swing) is solid as a CIA company man, while John Houseman (The Paper Chase) has a small supporting role.

Lacking the pyrotechnics of a modern thriller, Three Days of the Condor may seems a bit tame, and the film's ambiguous ending may not completely satisfy, but the story plays out in a very realistic manner for 1975, again harkening back to Watergate, where the efforts of Washington Post reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, eventually led to the resignation of a President.",1357430400,,4053,6.4

287531,3,6300216748,"I enjoyed this movie. I had heard it was a great film. The pacing was excellent and the intrigue kept me wondering what Turner was going to discover. The violence looked realistic for the most part. In other words, the gunshot wounds were not overdone, as they are today where a pinprick causes a fountain of blood. I thought Redford gave a solid performance. Dunaway seemed like a stand in. Sorry if that offends.

1. At the midpoint of the movie, Redford's character has sex with Dunaway's. To me, this was unbelievable given the circumstances. The actual sex scene was campy and unbearable to watch. It felt wedged into the movie and way out of place. Furthermore, it was unnecessary. The characters could have bonded in better, more believable, ways. I thought it was lazy story telling. Lastly, Dunaway's character seemed too comfortable over all with Redford's situation. They're up making coffee like hubby and wife on the morning after? I just can't accept that storyline. It could have been lots better.

2. (Spoiler Alert) Watching this movie from the perspective of 2013 caused me to roll my eyes at the ending. The whole mess was caused by the CIA planning a ""War for oil"". This is so clich to me and it's become a Hollywood default reason to find fault with the USA or the CIA etc. The mind-boggling ignorance story writers must maintain is astonishing so they can continue to write as if the USA is always up to no good. It started back then and almost 45 years later Hollywood is still at it.

3. (Spoiler Alert) Act III of the movie is a little loose. The ""murders for oil"" should have, in my opinion, been the doorway into Act III, instead we learn that in the last few minutes of the movie. With that said, the very last scene of the movie was top notch.",1356998400,,1772,4.54858934169279

The genre certainly has evolved in the near-forty years since this hit the screens, and seeing the genre's earlier members shows that evolution.

This film is not a classic, but it is worth watching to see Robert Redford & Faye Dunnaway in their primes.

The story line is good until the very ending -- then it yields to the paranoia of the times (1975): Big Government & the CIA controls everything, even the New York Times.

Then in the end we discover that it is not her apartment, but a ""safe house"" and she has been sent to kill him (unbeknownst to the first assassin, Max Von Sydow).

He also epitomized the ""hacker,"" similar to the upperclassmen physics and engineering majors I knew in college--guys whose exploits including designing and fashioning master keys that could open almost any door at the university, misdirecting incoming phone calls to the jock dorm, and perverting the timekeeping function of the computer science building's Univac 1108 to grab free computer time.

287603,5,6300216748,"""Three Days of the Condor"" is a political thriller released in 1975, based loosely on the novel ""Six Days of the Condor"" by James Brady. Joe Turner (Robert Redford), codename ""Condor"", works for the CIA researching foreign literature in New York City. Section 9 Department 17 has set up offices in a brownstone under the guise of the American Literary Historical Society. Joe recently sent a report to his superiors about a mystery novel that has been inexplicably translated into an odd assortment of languages despite its commercial failure. Joe goes out to pick up lunch for his co-workers. When he returns, he finds them all dead, murdered. He calls the CIA's ""panic office"" to report the incident, and they tell him that his superior in Washington, D.C., Wicks (Michael Kane), will bring him in. But Wicks tries to kill him, so Joe is on the run with no one to trust.

This is one of those terrific political thrillers made in the 1970s on the heels of Watergate, the Vietnam War, and the oil crisis that capitalized on the public's distrust of government. The CIA is plagued with rogue operations and morally bankrupt. The intelligence community just plays games, as Deputy Director Higgins (Cliff Robertson) explains to Joe. The good guys use the same methods, and often the same ""free-lancers"", as the bad guys. The assassin responsible for the carnage, Joubert (Max von Sydow), is the ultimate pragmatist. He has no need to believe in a side. He takes no interest in his employers and believes only in his work. Morally bankrupt, he is the only player with an objective viewpoint. The CIA is portrayed as a bastion of cynicism more than an agency of Cold Warriors.

Watching ""Three Days of the Condor"" in 2011, I was forced to conclude that reality is darker than leftist filmmakers of the 1970s imagined. That surprised me. Of course, the real CIA is not so goofy as to countenance high-level rogues who massacre their own agents in the middle of Manhattan. But I was taken aback when Higgins says that the American public would not object to the invasion of a Middle Eastern nation if we ran out of oil or, worse, food. In reality, it didn't take nearly that much for Americans to approve a war or two in the Middle East. Watching these old movies reminds me of how different global politics was during the Cold War, when the competition of two superpowers constrained their options to a large extent. And Joe's thinking is that the New York Times, freedom of the press incarnate, will save the day. No one would think that now.

There is a charming naivet amid ""Three Days of the Condor""'s over-the-top cynicism. And Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway, who plays Kathy Hale, a woman whom Joe abducts on the street because he requires the use of her car, make a good-looking couple. For a man who's not a field agent -he just reads books- Joe is pretty good at phone hacking and breaking and entering. This is a paranoid political thriller, but it's smart, tightly written, and an interesting trip back to the skeptical 1970s. The DVD (Paramount 2006) includes a theatrical trailer (3 min).

287626,4,6300216748,"My husband could not believe that I had never watched Three Days of the Condor and so we watched it together tonight. I have to say that I was quite impressed by it - the nostalgia of the 70s (ok, so I was a kid then, but it was fun watching the rather archaic methods of research, i.e. no Google, the big old computers, and good old book-based fact-finding!); excellent casting, i.e. Robert Redford as a CIA reader/researcher, Faye Dunaway as Kathy the spunky captive turned love interest; Max Von Sydow as the cool and ruthless assassin Joubert; John Houseman as a high-ranking CIA officer with an agenda of his own.

The movie succeeds as a thriller as it maintains a high and credible level of suspense throughout. The various plot threads weave together almost seamlessly, enhanced by the great acting by the various actors. Redford is quite believable as the preppy researcher turned man on the run though I found his talent for handling weapons and dodging experienced assassins a bit hard to swallow given his earlier claims of not having any field experience. Dunaway shares credible on-screen chemistry with Redford and I really liked that her character showed such spunk. Sydow is excellent as the assassin and he delivers a predictably compelling performance.

It's amazing that almost four decades have passed and yet some of the themes touched on in this movie are still relevant today - conspiracies, deception, the role of oil (ye gads!). Final verdict - a taut and suspenseful conspiracy thriller well worth one's time.",1279238400,,1536,4.903846153846154

All ideas are fed into a computer that compares with CIA plots and international issues and threats.  Joe is just a researcher, not a CIA Agent, but learns a lot about espionage, just reading books and other materials through his job.

Joe is late to work one rainy day in December and his boss corners him to let him know that a letter he sent the Langley CIA office was dismissed.  Joe folds up the letter and puts it in his pants pocket to deal with later.  His letter noted a realization that strong relationships were developing between Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and other oil producing countries and thought it was worth the CIA's effort to look into it.

We meet all of Joe's co-workers - 6 of them besides Joe.  He starts his work and feeds pertinent information into the computer.  Around 11:30 he is the designated person to do the lunch run to the Deli a block away. He ducks out a back entrance to avoid much of the rainy areas.  While he is gone, the mailman is rung in the front door security.  Other men come with him as they tear up the security tapes.  Everyone in the office is killed within minutes and the killers leave.  When Joe returns he finds the front door open and his co-workers shot.  He soon realizes this is a hit and takes the receptionist's gun to protect himself as he runs to a phone booth to call the main CIA office.

His CIA code name is Condor - and he calls to give his section chief the information of the hit.  He is told not to hang up the phone and to call again in two hours.  The CIA ""clean-up"" team arrives within minutes to clear the carnage.  They verify the killings to the main office.  The New York section chief is stunned and wants to know why a research office would be gunned down.  He calls his supervisor at CIA Headquarters.

Joe in the meantime is totally paranoid and dodges and hides until he is to be brought ""in from the cold"" - but realizes a set up in a back alley is meant to kill him.  The agents he was to meet are an old friend (he trusts) and another CIA department head.  He realizes his own department head is trying to kill him and shoots him with the gun he picked up.  The Department head then shoots the other unknowing agent (a friend that Joe trusted). Now Joe feels he can trust no one.  He is desperate and kidnaps a woman that he saw in a clothing store, Kathy (Faye Dunaway).  They drive to her apartment and she lets him hide there, although he uses the gun to scare her.  He just needs time to figure out what to do next.

The plot thickens and the action escalates.  There are exciting twists and turns.  Eventually Joe has his revenge.  A very rewarding spy movie!

I really enjoy watching this film. It has first-rate suspense and is definitely entertaining. I have seen it multiple times and will continue to watch it.

Having said that, I have to admit I laugh when I read critics (elsewhere) writing about how ""intelligent"" this movie is. Intelligent? Yeah, right.

Let's see. A man goes out to lunch and comes back to discover (after walking into an open front door that previously shuts and locks automatically) that all his co-workers have been murdered. Shortly afterward, he is shot at by a professional killer, who, conveniently, misses! OK. Now on the run, our hero (Robert Redford) kidnaps a woman at random in broad daylight and forces her at gunpoint back to her apartment. (Nobody sees any of this.) About two hours later, the woman is making love to the man and is instantly in love with him!!

It gets better. The man - a professional reader, a bookworm, instantly turns into James Bond and the woman is instantly transformed from a lonely, shrinking violet into an international spy, boldly breaking into the CIA and talking tough to an agent. Wow, yes, that sure sounds plausible to me!

Well, I''ll repeat one thing, for the readers here who forgot my opening paragraph and think I am panning the film. I am not. I like the movie. it's entertaining. It's fun to watch, and that's the name of the game. It's nice to see it's out on Blu-Ray.",1243814400,3,1436,4.682539682539683

287694,5,6300216748,"In Nov. 1975, ""Three Days of the Condor"", a suspenseful conspiracy thriller based on the novel by James Grady (titled ""Six Days of the Condor) was adapted to film and directed by Sydney Pollack (""Sabrina"" (1995), ""The Firm"", ""The Way We Were"") and a screenplay by Lorenzo Semple Jr. (""King Kong"", ""Flash Gordon"", ""Sheena"", etc.) and David Rayfiel was released in theaters.

The film which received positive reviews by critics was nominated for a 1976 Academy Award for ""Film Editing"" and also a winner of multiple awards.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""3 DAYS OF THE CONDOR"" is a 1975 film that is featured for the first time in 1080p High Definition on Blu-ray.  Because the film was created in 1975, the film quality does show a bit of age but the transfer is actually better in picture quality that some 1990's and early-2000 films that I have seen on High Definition.

The film does showcase a few dust but there are a number of dark scenes and a few compression artifacts were detect but again, for a film over 34-years old, the colors were strong, blacks were good and overall, a very good transfer of the film to Blu-ray.

As for audio, the film is featured in English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD (and also French Mono).  Truth be told, this is a front channel, dialogue driven film.  If there was use of any bass, it's that old 70's bass picking style that was popular at the time that utilizes the bass.  As for the action sequences, the gunshots and everything else seems quite bland but I was not expecting thrilling audio directionals to come from all speaker channels with this film, so I found the audio satisfactory for a film this old.

Subtitles are featured in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""3 DAYS OF THE CONDOR"" has only one special feature and that is the original theatrical trailer with scratches and dust galore.  The trailer is in HD but it would have been nice to have someone do a commentary or revisit this film especially how relevant it is in today's modern world.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""3 DAYS OF THE CONDOR"" is a very good conspiracy thriller.  What is quite shocking about this film which was released in 1975 is how it actually predicts the government's involvement in future affairs.  I don't want to go into too much into the film without spoiling it but I will say that what Turner is able to find out, it's what's happening in today's modern world, especially with the United States.

What is also a bit numbing to see is the few shots of the Twin Towers and the film featuring the two buildings not long after they were built.

Robert Redford's performance was fine but there were some lines that almost echoed a John Wayne style of acting which was acceptable around that time but for today's modern viewers, it may not hold up.

Stars that did shine in this film were Faye Dunaway, who did a great job playing the role of Kathy Hale.  As a captive hostage turned woman who is willing to aid her abductor, this was a film that seems to utilize ""Stockholm Syndrome"" and not surprising considering that the Patty Hearst-SLA bank robberies in real life happened in 1974 or perhaps its a woman who agrees to help Joe Turner because both share a side of sadness and loneliness in their life.

Max von Sydow as the assassin Joubert is also quite effective in his role, especially during the big reveal near the end of the film.

In reviewing this Blu-ray release, although a few artifacts and dust are seen on the video quality, this is probably the best transfer we will get of the film.  The audio quality is uninspiring but considering this is not a modern film which we come to expect full utilization of audio channels, ""3 DAYS OF THE CONDOR"" is quite clear in dialogue and for a 1975 film, taking all things into consideration, this is a pretty good transfer on Blu-ray ala HD.

My main peeve with this Blu-ray release is that a film with so much relevance for today's modern world, it would have been wonderful to have interviews with the stars or having some sort of special feature included other than the trailer.

The film is a well-written, well-edited and captivating thriller with a storyline that I don't know if Sydney Pollack or even novel writer James Grady knew how relevant it would be over 30 years later.

Overall, ""3 DAYS OF THE CONDOR"" is definitely an action-thriller classic definitely worth recommending!",1242691200,20,4368,4.6170763260025875

He made the 1973 classic ""Three Days of the Condor"" (1973), with Cliff Robertson and Faye Dunnaway. He plays a CIA reader, a kind of pre-Tom Clancy research guy, a benign fellow among other benign CIA fellows, all of whom are murdered in a fuzzily explained hit by bad CIA fellows. After escaping, Redford tries to get to the bottom of it. Since he is a genius he has the intellectual tools to outwit his chasers. This is the film's highlight, revolving around the sexual tension between Redford and the redoubtable Faye, who he ""kidnaps"" in order to have a place to hide out, her apartment. The movie goes off the deep when the whole conspiracy turns out to be about the CIA's covert operations in the Middle East, where the U.S. apparently is planning the invasion (that never actually occurred) to take over OPEC. The message is that The Company murders innocents, the U.S. is a warmongering empire, and tool of capitalist greed. It is Redford's answer to Guatemala, Iran and Chile, where the people killed were generally Communists.

In the 1950s and 1960s, it was all about the Soviets. (Oh, for the days when we knew our enemy so well!) In the 1960s, we also started seeing Bond movies, which were heavily about the Russians, but also about different (if often ridiculous) enemies.

However, I've always felt that the 1970s was a truly great time for spy films. The decade is filled with fantastic spy stories:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tinker-Tailor-Soldier-Spy/dp/B00006A8T4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marathon-Man/dp/B00005M2CO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marathon Man</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-the-President-s-Men-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000CEXEWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All the President's Men (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;and this one:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-Days-of-the-Condor/dp/6305511055/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three Days of the Condor</a>.

One day, he goes out for lunch and comes back to find everyone in his office murdered.

287780,5,6300216748,"The spy adventure film ""Three Days of the Condor"" was released in 1975.  This was a period when the American government and the commercial sector were in a panic over our access to oil.  This was when President Gerald Ford, mindful of the power of the Oil Producing Export Countries, announced that in the future we might actually consider taking oil by force if it should be denied to America.

On the subject of Ford, we know that he followed Nixon, and that it was just one year before ""Condor"" was released that Ford's predecessor resigned in disgrace.  What did him in?  The Watergate Scandal.  What was that?  A series of clandestine activities, which once again lead back to the central point that this was a timely film.

Why is ""Three Days of the Condor"" even more timely today?  Because of all that we have been through and what we know about the CIA and its clandestine activities that we did not know then.  We have experienced 9/11 and skepticism increases over its causes and who put the plan into effect, much like those same questions being asked about the assassination of President Kennedy.

The reason why this film is even timelier today and can be better understood in a context better than three decades after its initial release is that we are much better informed about a major point discovered by Robert Redford, a book reader for the CIA who goes by the code name of Condor, is that there is an official CIA and another CIA.  Often the latter will superimpose itself on the former.  John Le Carre made the same point relative to MI5 in British intelligence.

Redford, working out of a New York office purporting to be an historical society, leaves one afternoon to order and bring back lunch for himself and the rest of the crew.  After a little chitchat at the restaurant he returns to discover that everyone in the office has been fatally shot.

Just where does he go from here?  Redford explains on the phone to headquarters that he is no agent, and is just a research man who reads books and makes recommendations.  He hopes to be brought in before he meets with the same fate as his office colleagues.

A smooth and suave Cliff Robertson is his contact operating out of the CIA's main headquarters in Langley, Virginia.  When it is arranged for a station chief to come to New York to ""bring him in,"" more trouble ensues.  Redford has every reason to wonder if he has any allies left in ""The Company"" as he runs away from tragedy once more.

In an effort to secure at least temporary safety Redford kidnaps Faye Dunaway after she leaves a store where he has gone to temporarily hide from pursuers.  A professional photographer who lives in Brooklyn, Dunaway at first resists Redford, but ultimately becomes an ally when she realizes that he is telling the truth and his life is in danger.

At one point Dunaway tells Redford that she is afraid to get to know him since he is not going to live very long.  He disagrees, telling her that sense of danger is a driving interest force within her toward him.  Ultimately they became romantically involved and she is willing to accompany him to Langley so he can confront Robertson.

The film was released not long after Daniel Ellsberg became famous for leaking what came to be known as the Pentagon Papers.  In a fascinating twist at the end of the film, Redford uses the New York Times as a type of insurance policy.

Some of the film's most dramatic scenes involve Redford and Robertson, with the former speaking for the best of America as he states the case for decency and accountability in government while the latter states the proposition for secrecy and an ""end justifies the means"" mentality.

Sydney Pollack in his director's role keeps the pacing fast as befitting a spy mystery involving pursuers and pursued.  The camera work was magnificent.  Some of the long shots are particularly fascinating in displaying New York City and Washington D.C. as large cities in the midst of winter amid the ongoing tension of Redford's tense battle to survive.

Two prominent character actors render solid performances; John Houseman as a veteran CIA officer and colleague of Robertson's and Max Von Sydow as a contract assassin who performs his tasks with consummate professional detachment.",1171324800,,4265,4.704851752021563
287781,5,6300216748,"This has been a favorite movie of mine for years.  This 1975 flick was right in keeping with the cold-war spy stuff that so permeated the lives of people at that time. I remember all the spy TV shows and spy movies. Heck, I even remember as a kid going down to the basement when the warning sirens went off (East Coast).  I think that was the 1950s. In the 70s, spies were heroes and covert activities were going on everywhere. I wanted to work for the CIA, too, just like in the movies. (I do work for the government, but not CIA.)

Anyway, as you've probably read already, Redford is in his prime and is a spy (Joe Turner) working for the CIA.  He just reads books and analyzes them.  He looks for things that are out-of-place in the writings, which may point to a covert operation taking place somewhere in the world.  If he finds something, he writes a report and (as typical within the government) sends the report forward up the chain-of-command.

Well, guess what?  He submits a report on something wierd he finds in the books, goes out to pick up lunch, and returns to find everybody in the library office whacked. This was a somewhat secure location, too. Necessity is the mother of invention, and since Joe Turner feels the need to stay alive, he calls in to Headquarters and goes on the run. As he starts running, he begins to realize that people are after him too.  He can no longer be sure who to trust. Joe's cover name is Condor, which he never thought he would use, and Condor becomes a cloak-and-dagger guy, on the run. He enlists the help of Kathy (Faye Dunaway), just someone he picked at random and sensed was harmless. The head bad guy cold-blooded-killer is Max von Sydow (Jobert), and he is outstanding, as always. Jobert really doesn't particularly care who he kills; it's just business. But somehow, you kind of like Jobert. Cliff Robertson works for the CIA as Wiggins and Condor is talking back and forth with Wiggins to try to get to safety somehow. Condor is running from Jobert (and others), hiding and running with Kathy, and trying to work something out with Wiggins.

Well, remember that book report Condor wrote that we talked about in the beginning? Turns out there is something going on.  That's why all those people got whacked! (Duh). What's going on has a bunch of people involved, so there are twists and turns and surprises, and there is running and hiding and being clever all over the place.  Condor turns out to be quite clever because ""he reads books"" all the time. Well, knowledge is power.

This movie is based on the novel ""Six Days of the Condor"" (1974) by James Grady.

This movie is about a man named Joe Turner (Robert Redford) who ""just read[s] books"" with six others at a place called the ""American Literary Historical Society"" (ALHS).  Turner and his literary colleagues are also non-practicing CIA agents with Turner having the code name ""Condor.""

On this particular day it was Turner's turn to pick up lunch for the others at the office.  He exits through a rear door of the ALHS to do so.  On returning with lunch he finds all his colleagues murdered.  He now runs for his life.

Turner reports this massacre to his superior (Cliff Robertson), a man he has never met.  He suddenly finds himself the target of both his employers and the unknown murderers of his associates.  He randomly abducts a lonely photographer (Faye Dunaway) who is forced to hide him and later helps him discover the answer to the following question:

""What's the secret worth murdering everybody at the ALHS house?""

This movie was an unexpected surprise for me.  While starting out tame, it turns into an intense thriller with excellent acting.  Redford, Robertson, and Dunaway give good performances.  However, my biggest kudos must go to someone I never mentioned in the above summary--Max von Sydow who ruthlessly and chillingly plays a maverick hit man.

The background music adds to each scene.  I found the cinematography of mid-seventies New York interesting.

Finally, the DVD (the one released Aug. 1999) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has one extra.

In conclusion, after watching this movie, you'll be asking yourself the same question Turner asks:

""Do you believe the Condor is really an endangered species?""

The film starts out very well.  Condor slips out the back door (and leaves it open!) to make a food run at lunch time.  When he returns, he finds everybody gunned down inside - his girlfriend too!  Boy is he angry!  He can't wait to find her killer.

But wait. . .  he can wait!  Oh yeah.  He finds Faye Dunaway and they throw a private lust party, while trying to stay a step ahead of his girlfriend's killers.  Finally, his girlfriend's killer catches up with him.  Condor thinks he's a gonner.

But wait. . . the hitman, named Jobair, informs him that he's been hired to kill the boss instead of Condor.  But he warns Condor that they will get around to killing him too.  Condor somehow contains all his anger and revenge towards his girlfriend's killer and says ""You seem to understand it all - what would you do?""  Jobair says ""Personally I prefer Europe"".  After chatting like newfound friends, Jobair gives back Condor's pistol.  Condor doesn't shoot Jobair, instead he lets Jobair give a lift to the station.

287795,5,6300216748,"This film has long been one of my Top Ten favorites for the quality of the acting and the screenplay, and for the importance of the theme: that a secret network could operate within the intelligence community beneath the radar of legitimate agency oversight.

The film seems especially prescient now, given that the fictional network's goal was planning a U.S. invasion of the Mideast. Voila, 30 years later, the U.S. has invaded the Mideast. When the Redford character finally confronts the rogue C.I.A. leader of the plan, he connects the dots and says, ""This whole damn thing is about oil, isn't it?"" Exactly.

Let's be clear about why the U.S. Armed Forces are in Iraq, rather than, say, Ecuador or Nepal: it's the strategic importance of the region's oil. Yes, the plan is to transform Iraq into a democratic nation, which will lead the entire region in that direction. But the U.S. isn't committing its treasure and citizenry to all troubled regions of the globe equally; we are in Iraq because it is the strategic linchpin of the region. Without access to the Mideast oil reserves, the world economy would be shaken to its foundations.

There are many troubled, undemocratic regions in the world--for example, much of Africa; yet we fight now to establish democracy in only one troubled region, the Mideast. Coincidence? No. Simple self-interest. As the Cliff Robertson character says at the film's conclusion: ""When the people are cold and their engines stop running, they're not going to ask us why; they'll just want us to go get it.""

Realizing that he is an embarrassment to the C.I.A. (the inevitable role of any whistleblower, even a reluctant one), at the film's end Redford gives the entire story to the New York Times. The Robertson character, a C.I.A. station chief who was caught off-guard by the hidden conspiracy, says, ""But will they print it?"" Redford is taken aback at the implication--that the government could pressure the media to suppress the story--and then he avers, less confidently, ""They'll print it.""

This is the core of democracy: that a free press keeps a government answerable to its people. Without a free and skeptical press, all the elections in the world mean nothing.",1147996800,16,2210,4.946091644204852

The hit team is coordinated by contract assassin Joubert played by a cooly professional Max Von Sydow.

He kidnaps the innocent Kathy Hale, a photographer played by Faye Dunaway, who he recruits to shelter him in her place while he figures out his next move.  A meeting arranged with his station chief arranged by deputy CIA director Higgins played by Cliff Robertson results on an attempt on Redford's life.  All the while he's being stalked by Von Sydow and his team of killers.

He realizes that there is a clandestine branch of the CIA running an operation which a speculative report filed by Redford had unwittingly revealed.  The game of cat and mouse continues until Redford gets answers finally from Robertson.  He however has no assurances that his life will be free of danger even after he reveals the mechanisms of the illicit operation to the press.

Sydney Pollack does an excellent job in representing the secretive tenor of government operations during a sensitive era in U.S. history replete with orchestrated coverups like Watergate.

Quickly phoning HQ, Condor is ordered to rendezvous with a pickup only to be speedily thrown into a game of cat and mouse with shadow agencies and his own competing against one another. Although there are some surprises in store, plot twists and the memorable tense elevator scene (did you drop these gloves sir?), 3 Days of the Condor is sadly let down by a lack of depth in the plot and some unconventional breaks in the pace, such as the overlong kidnapping background love story with Kathy, Faye Dunaway, and the Scooby-doo explanation ending that never really seems to answer much, leaving the viewer with a sort of half-satisfied explanation for the high body count shadow operations being witnessed. Although playing itself somewhat well to the tune of cold war atmosphere, this `man on the run' leaves many loose ends open and much to the imagination. This is mostly due to the very interesting confrontation between Turner and Joubert that is downplayed by the final scene where Condor confronts his boss.

With a high television replay count 3 Days of the Condor has shown itself to be a very popular movie and Redford does his bit well, bringing out the bookworm's military manoeuvres now and again, this is a 70s conspiracy thriller highlight, although there are now better and deeper movies that revolve around the same theme.

287825,5,6300216748,"This review is for the 1999 widescreen release by Paramount.

The story involves a man named Joe Turner (Robert Redford) who works in a New York brownstone building that poses as a private literature society when in fact its an undercover operation for the CIA.  His job is decoding possible enemy secrets found in publications printed anywhere in the world.  Turner runs an errand by leaving through the back of the building, and minutes later the office is raided by assassins and the 8 or so remaining employees are all killed.  Turner returns to his office and finds his fellow employees dead and contacts his superiors at the CIA Headquarters.  He begins to realize that things are not adding up and goes into hiding.  As the film moves on, he essentially kidnaps a woman (played by Faye Dunaway) and with her help, they devote their time together figuring out what has really happened.

The movie is filled with twists and turns.  Since Turner is an avid reader and has vast knowledge of intellegence operations, he does a magnificent job protecting himself as well as uncovering information about his advocaries.  There is one unforgettable scene where Turner meets a professional assassin (Max Von Sydow) and the contract killer describes his work and with a straight face he mentions that he finds his job rather peaceful.  This is definitely one of the best thrillers from the '70s.

Earlier reviews have fairly well constructed and described the plot but what's interesting is the unbelievability of it. Sydney Pollack keeps the heat on and the emotional cul de sacs plentiful as Redford tries to whittle down not so much the who killed all his coworkers but the why.
I believe alongside ""Bullit,"" ""French Connection,"" ""Body Heat"" and a few others, this is an essential movie both for it's time and our time. In light of Vietnam and Watergate, we just didn't blindly trust Uncle Sam anymore and were frequently reminded of the protest idiom, 'love your country; fear your government.' And for a captivating two hours, Redford is 'everyperson' ever profiled, searched, audited, traffic stopped, drafted and perhaps far worse. We didn't have to read George Orwell to know big brother was and is watching.
Cliff Robertson, a gifted actor denied his peak years because of pseudo-administration influence (do you remember 'Flowers for Algernon/Charley?), ironically plays the government role, as you would expect, brilliantly, and Max Von Sydow, is as always, superlative.

Those are two outstanding films, and Pollack's effort doesn't hold a candle to either.  This movie is a disaster.  Despite a dynamite opening act and a somewhat intriguing conclusion, together with a modicum of timeliness and poignancy with regard to real-world goings-on at the CIA, the vast majority of the film is spent slogging through dated fight choreography, awkward sex scenes, and some of the most atrocious dialogue ever committed to the silver screen.  Faye Dunaway is particularly off-putting in a muted and emotionally confusing performance as a photographer who always blathers on about metaphorical pictures she keeps hidden away and only lets some people see.
Only Cliff Robertson and Max von Sydow escape unscathed from this silly, dated picture, resisting Redford's overacting and turning in fine performances (although Robertson's hair is perhaps the film's greatest mystery).  To make matters worse, the soundtrack sounds like pornography, a perfectly awful mix of xylophone and smooth jazz.
For a much better time, please consider The Parallax View.  If you have your heart set on Pollack, just watch The Firm, and you'll get the paranoia, the chasing and spying, and the pretty male lead, while what you sacrifice in political overtone you will gain in character development.  I really thought I had something special when I took this home to watch it; it began with such promise.  Truly it does not compare to the emotional wallop of Gene Hackman's Harry Caul, nor the mind-blowing psychadelic tension of Pakula's government coverups.

He plays a CIA reader, a kind of pre-Tom Clancy research guy, a benign fellow among other benign CIA fellows, all of whom are murdered in a fuzzily explained hit by bad CIA fellows. After escaping, Redford tries to get to the bottom of it. Since he is a genius he has the intellectual tools to outwit his chasers. This is the film's highlight, revolving around the sexual tension between Redford and the redoubtable Faye, who he ""kidnaps"" in order to have a place to hide out, her apartment. The movie goes off the deep when the whole conspiracy turns out to be about the CIA's covert operations in the Middle East, where the U.S. apparently is planning the invasion (that never actually occurred) to take over OPEC. The message is that The Company murders innocents, the U.S. is a warmongering empire, and tool of capitalist greed. It is Redford's answer to Guatemala, Iran and Chile, where the people killed were generally Communists. Redford would rather show the CIA killing Chinese- and African-Americans and other non-threats.

287857,3,6300216748,"Released the year after Watergate, this was among the first of the ""paranoid thriller"" films involving conspiracies, rogue CIA agents, and whatnot. While it probably seemed groundbreaking and fresh in 1975, three decades of similarly plotted movies have dulled Condor's edge.
Robert Redford plays an agent, code name ""Condor,"" who works in a scholarly-appearing CIA front organization in New York that analyzes world literature for significant patterns (whose significance to the spook agency isn't spelled out very convincingly). While he goes to the deli to pick up lunch for his crew, a team of assassins gains entry to the office and wipes out all of his colleagues there, as well as another who is at home. Redford, realizing he was supposed to be among the victims, goes on the run and plays cat-and-mouse with various CIA officers, any of whom could be behind the killings.
He chooses at random a woman photographer (Faye Dunaway) as his unwilling accomplice while hiding and trying to penetrate the evil cabal within the ""Company."" In one of the screen's unlikeliest romances, Dunaway finds her fear and distrust of Redford's character yielding to belief in his story and then a dangerous liaison with him.
The director, Sydney Pollack, has often blended the elements of commercial cinema with intelligence and taste (e.g., Out of Africa).  This is another such attempt, but not one of his better efforts. The genre has worn thin, as noted earlier, and the script staggers from cliche to cliche. I won't be giving away anything important if I tell you that the denouement is, yes, ""It's all about ... oil!""
I am usually unable to warm to Redford, and this was no exception. There is no ""there"" there, as Gertrude Stein said about Oakland. He strikes poses and lets his golden hair do his acting for him. There is also a featured (but minor) role for John Houseman as a sour, cold-eyed case officer. He lays it on thick.
Still, several of the performances give Condor what distinction it has. Dunaway is better than I would have expected, quite credible and sometimes touching as a lonely introvert. Cliff Robertson, one of the underestimated actors of the '60s and early '70s (what ever happened to him?), is strong as the CIA officer assigned to ""bring in"" Condor. Best of all is the great Max von Sydow, who starred in many of Ingmar Bergman's films, playing a freelance assassin. Watch how a master actor makes a meal out of a feebly written part.
Several scenes were shot outside and inside the World Trade Center, which was then brand new. They are chilling in a way the filmmakers could not have conceived.",1086307200,7,2620,4.861297539149888

I agree with the reviewer that, after countless viewings, I can't put my finger on why it is so mesmerizing.  There is Redford's performance, probably his most nuanced and all round best on film.  There is Pollack's direction, which keeps the film moving so well that you don't have time to think about some of the questionable parts of the script, which nonetheless, serves the film well.  The plot, while a bit convoluted, is superior in my opinion to that of the book on which the film is based.  Max van Sydow is superb as usual, as a hitman who actually finds his job relaxing, and whose hobby is painting little ceramic figurines.  He does not worry about the right or wrong of the cause ... only who is paying him.  John Houseman in a small part plays a menacing career bureaucrat in the CIA.  And Cliff Robertson is excellent as Condor's contact.  You wonder if he is Condor's friend or not.  Well, watch the film.
This is not one of those films that, because it is a suspense film, you might not view again after you know the ending.  ""Condor"" is delightful upon repeated viewings, even if you know the ending and can recite many bits of dialog by heart.  Again, I can't exactly say why, but has to do with the contributions of the people I enumerated in the previous paragraph.  In ""Condor"" the whole is more that its quite considerable packet of parts.  It is one of my favorite films of all time.  I'll never tire of it.  I don't think you will either.",1083974400,4,1551,4.431095406360424
287859,5,6300216748,"Like Klute, this is one of those thinking man's movies that works because of the actors. Little violence, much drama. Robert Redford is believable here as a bookish CIA type, and Faye Dunaway is excellent as a beautiful woman we all see on the streets, but hiding behind large clothes and hats.
I liked this movie a lot.

287860,4,6300216748,"Since September 11th two years ago, most of us are probably more willing to believe that there can be evil (albeit unseen) forces active within our society which can suddenly result in death and destruction. What sets this film apart from most others in its genre is the introduction of  a guileless central character (Joe Turner played by Robert Redford) who seems to pose no threat to anyone and yet he becomes involved in a deadly situation which neither he nor we understand. Director Sydney Pollack was perhaps influenced by Alfred Hitchcock who, in so many of his own films, subjects an innocent person to undefined but nonetheless nerve-chilling terror. After obtaining take-out lunches for himself and his associates, Turner returns to their small office in Manhattan and finds all of them dead. What happened? Who did it? Why? The situation is complicated by the fact that he and they are employed by the C.I.A. There is no indication that their research has any special significance. Security precautions for their office seem perfunctory. Turner flees the scene, later meeting with his supervisor Higgins (Cliff Robertson). After someone attempts to kill Turner, he again calls Higgins who urges him to ""come in."" By now, Turner correctly senses that he is in great danger but from whom? Why? What to do? He also realizes that he can no longer trust anyone, including Higgins. Still in flight, he (his code name ""Condor"") enlists the reluctant assistance of a stranger named Kathy (Faye Dunaway) who becomes his only ally. Enough about the plot.
Based on James Grady's novel Six Days of the Condor, this is one of several films from the 1970s which portray distrust of institutional authority because of various assassinations, the Viet Nam War, and Watergate. However, it is important to keep in mind that Joe Turner is not a major political or religious leader; rather, he is a relatively insignificant research analyst in a relatively insignificant C.I.A. field office. For me, the key point is that literally anyone anywhere can be selected for elimination at any time. Worse yet, we won't know who's involved, much less why. Redford delivers a solid performance as Turner, the focal point throughout the film. As for Dunaway, she does what she can with Kathy, not much of a part. Of special note is the work of Max von Sydow (as Joubert) and John Houseman (as Wabash). Theirs is a cold-blooded professionalism which views people merely as ""assets"" to accumulate or liquidate per orders from unidentified authorities. This is not the best of the political thrillers but it does portray some thought-provoking situations which still seem relevant 28 years later.",1063238400,43,2676,5.027027027027027

I loved this film the first time I saw it on TV. The start
is so downbeat, I thought it would just fill a couple of
hours while I was babysitting. Then it took off and didn't
let up until the very end.
I was so impressed that I spent 3 years looking for the
book by James Grady ('Six Days of the Condor', which was
out of print at the time).
I eventually got a copy of the book and went on to get an
NTSC VHS tape (I live in PAL-land) and eventually a Region 1
DVD (I'm in R2). I don't do that for many films.
I cannot understand how this film got so little notice and
isn't regularly shown on TV; I think it's fantastic.",1031356800,5,660,3.8248175182481754

Once the film starts you won't be able to leave it for a minute. From start to finish it is compelling.

287864,5,6300216748,"I had never heard of this film before picking it up, and now I realize I had been missing out.  Three Days of the Condor is an amazing piece of work which finds all of its participants -- Robert Redford, Faye Dunaway, Max von Sydow, director Sydney Pollack -- in top form, in a mesmerizing, briskly paced, and smart thriller that relies on tension rather than violence to do its job.
Redford is absolutely brilliant as lead character Turner, or Condor, a researcher who finds himself the unwilling participant of a dangerous spy game.  Redford and Pollack smartly infuse the character with both a devilish charm and occasional viciousness that makes a great contrast to the character's outward repression, and complicates his role as reluctant hero.  His dynamic with Faye Dunaway is an intriguing mix of sexual chemistry, confrontation and violation, and it makes the relationship far more interesting than most ""Stockholm Syndrome"" setups of this type.  Max von Sydow makes for a formidable, intelligent, and creepy opponent, and Pollack's shooting and editing are just about perfect.  Throughout the movie's substantial, sprawling plot, Pollack maintains a stifling sense of tension that engrosses you into continued attention.  True, I found myself quite lost in the maze of character relationships and motivations, but Pollack's dramatic sense is so unfailing that I never really care.
Nearly as good as All the President's Men as far as political thrillers go -- and that's saying a lot.",1029456000,10,1493,5.148760330578512

287888,5,6300216748,"I first saw this suspense/spy thriller when it was first released in the theaters sometime in the late 1970s, while living in London and working for the American government. There's nothing that compares with the paranoia associated with seeing a taut spy thriller, only to exit the theater into a cold, foggy late evening in downtown London.  The picture it paints of a murderous renegade network operating within the Central Intelligence Agency is both frightening and plausible, and is delivered by Robert Redford with the terrific direction of Sidney Pollack and his production team in a tight, well-developed tale with a convincing thread of interconnecting events that spins way out of control as the protagonist tries desperately to figure out who is at the center of the plot and why he and his cohorts at a special studies institute sponsored by the Agency are targets.

For me, this movie is a nonstop roller-coaster ride, with Redford trying in vain to jump off the damn thing before it crashes below! The level of paranoia as well as the multiple levels of deceit and deception depicted in the film seemed a bit outlandish at the time, but given the temper of the times, it somehow seemed much more plausible in the backwash of Watergate and all that was revealed about the machinations of the so-called ""invisible government"" then. The hero's ability to parse together the facts and learn and adapt as he progresses makes the movie work especially well, and one can relate to his growing frustration as he realizes there just may not be any way out alive. And between the margins of the scenes lie some intriguing questions regarding the role of secrecy in an open and supposedly democratic society that add a measure of intellectual acumen and ""gravitas"" to the tale.

So popular was this movie at the box office that it spawned a number of other spy thrillers in its wake. The film's cast included not only Redford as the hero, but also starred Fay Dunaway, and Cliff Robertson. This movie makes for an absorbing evening of entertainment, and a surefire way to escape the humdrum of everyday life with a stunning tale of murder, mayhem, and betrayal. I highly recommend this flick. Enjoy!",1021852800,145,2203,4.8537234042553195
287889,4,6300216748,"Here are the seventies again ! At that time, Hollywood was ruled by such directors as Alan J. Pakula, John Frankenheimer or Sydney Pollack. The bad guys were the C.I.A., the F.B.I., the Big consortiums or the Army and the good guys had the face of Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Warren Beatty or John Doe. It was one of the only periods in the history of cinema during which Hollywood was the champion of morality. Alas, times change...
THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR stands very well the test of time with a solid plot involving a Faye Dunaway smiling for the first and last time in a motion picture, a Robert Redford gaining with this role a star status and a Max Von Sydow impersonating an official hitman. Nevertheless, there are a few gaps in the screenplay ; for instance, Robert Redford can a little bit too easily enter the Bell Central building and Faye Dunaway hasn't any difficulty to meet one of the C.I.A. big bosses. But, after all, it's only cinema !
THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR is a classic political thriller of above-average quality which deserves a place in every serious movie lover's library. Sound is very well balanced and clear and images reflect the sadness of an early winter.<P...",1017878400,15,1196,4.619718309859155
287890,5,6300216748,"What is it about this movie that makes it so compelling?  After countless viewings, I still can't put my finger on it -- but let's consider the crucial elements of ""Condor.""
First, the paucity of dialogue -- in other words, what Redford displays and emotes rather than says -- is powerful.  It seems that for the first time in his career, Redford is really challenged to act instead of being just another pretty cinematic face.  If ever a man could give the impression of being both haunted and hunted, Redford's a cinch in ""Condor.""
This is also a great New York City film.  Its streets, back alleys, and buildings -- in particular, the World Trade Center -- all play supporting roles.  Sidney Pollack makes good use of the then-newly finished twin towers in ""Condor,"" and this viewer lamented their destruction after watching scenes featuring the main lobby and a top-floor office inhabited by CIA deputy director Cliff Robertson.
The grainy quality of the film, matched with an often funky, sometimes melancholy soundtrack scored by Dave Grusin, also adds to the aura of ""Condor.""  It's as if Pollack attempted to do an American sendup of a French intrigue film.  Grusin's music also is not what you'd expect in a spy film, in that it has not a hint of the James Bond sound.  Then again, the film is not a romantic spy thriller, so it works.
In fact, Pollack and Redford successfuly convey a post-Watergate paranoia that the citizens' government is 'out there' and will stop at nothing to hunt down the truth-seeking rogue.  Phone taps and plumbers (disguised, this time, as mailmen) abound.  Suitably, ""Three Days of the Condor"" ends with a very anti-establishment message.
This film deserves to be placed in the list of top twenty great American films of the modern cinematic era (however one judges that).  ""Condor"" is good the first time around and seems to be more enjoyable with subsequent viewings.  Far from being a period piece, it stands the test of time as a thriller that is also thoughtful.",1010534400,92,2006,4.799418604651163
287891,4,6300216748,"Wire-rimmed glasses and a slight stubble of beard isn't enough to make Robert Redford completely convincing as a bookish CIA researcher, though he gives a terrific ""movie star"" performance (partially the result of co screenwriter David Rayfiel being brought in to customize some of Redford's dialouge).
Also, Director Sydney Pollack (""Tootsie"") doesn't seem to have the feel for suspense-thriller pulp (the way someone like Peckinpah had), so ""Three Days of the Condor"" is a little too monotone and flat at times to be a completely successful representative of the genre.
No matter.
""Three Days of The Condor"" had all the timing in the world going for it.
Released in 1975, just on the heels of Watergate and in the midst of the Church Committee hearings on CIA excesses, ""Condor"" became the only box office success of Paramount Pictures ""Conspiracy Trilogy"" (the others being ""The Conversation"" and Parallax View"").
It's also worth noting the cinematography (done by the great Owen Roizman) is spectacular...the rainy Manhattan streets never looked so beautifully moody....and the score by Dave Grusin avoids all the usual thriller movie stabs and sting.
The transfer quality of the DVD is superb, but the special features are non existent (all that's included is the original theatrical trailer--hardly a ""special feature"" in today's DVD world).

All he has going for him is his intelligence and the fact that he reads spy novels and murder mysteries for a living. He makes mistakes, but he also makes several brilliant moves that a sesoned operative would never consider, which is one reason why he survives. His actions seem believable. He's an ordinary man having to cope with an extraordinary situation. Max von Sydow and Cliff Robertson are also very good and though it is a small part John Houseman shines as one of the grand old men of the CIA. Though the technology has aged, as well as some of the field techniques ,much of it is still very relevant as is the motivation for wiping out Condor's entire department.
