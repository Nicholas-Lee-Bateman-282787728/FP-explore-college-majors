6476335,5,B00L905EVK,"Great stuff !!! Muta, Rocky Johnson, Kevin Sullivan, Lars Anderson, Mark Lewin, and a ton of great matches. Unreal how much talent went through that area on the way to Japan. A true look at a promotion who could have had success on PPV. Stars from all 3 major US and Japan promotions all on one DVD.",1411776000,5,299,4.2631578947368425
8664514,3,B00L905EVK,"Update 6/28 as I actually watched it I realized a lot of matches have no ending , one even cuts out after only a minute or so plus they are all within the same time period as they keep talking about a particular upcoming show! It would be nice to see a Dvd covering this area in full as they had a lot of stars come through here Got this yesterday, just skimmed through to see who was on it and how the video quality was . For the most part it was good looks to be early to mid eighties. The only match that didn't have good quality was Ric Flair Vs Samu so that was disappointing",1529625600,,580,3.9237288135593222

8664519,2,B00L905EVK,"Worth a few bucks to rent for the diehard fan, but... I think it's really over the top to list The Shiek and Bruiser Brody as "" the stars"" here. There is very little footage of either one.",1423353600,,188,3.973684210526316
