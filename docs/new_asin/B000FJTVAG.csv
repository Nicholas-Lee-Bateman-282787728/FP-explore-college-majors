8554255,5,B000FJTVAG,All seven of these troop orientation films were made or supervised by Hollywood director Frank Capra.  Every soldier leaving for the war saw these films.  They were also shown to the public in limited release.  Make no mistake these are masterful compilation documentaries designed to rally our troops and prepare them to fight a sinister and cruel enemy.  Great historical material from 35mm film copies preserved in the National Archives.,1226793600,2,440,5.242857142857143
