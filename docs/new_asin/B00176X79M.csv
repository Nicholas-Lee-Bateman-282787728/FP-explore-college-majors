8265277,1,B00176X79M,"I purchased all the DVDs on Astrology and the Zodiac I could find in order to learn the basics of Astrology, and this one is by far the worst.  Do not waste your money on this DVD, as you do not learn Astrology 101 in this... what get is an unprepared instructor in a poorly thought out production standing there with a few miniature and unreadable posters talking ""about"" a few astrological things to a handful of people, but certainly not teaching you the Astrology 101 fundamentals.  In fact, the instructor completely ignores half the outlines she had taped to her bookcase.  Instead of taking you step by step through all the basics and all the terminology and building on it each step of the way to really give you a thorough overview (e.g. what is the precession of the equinoxes, how does that relate to years and cycles and constellations?  Forget it!  You won't find out!  What's a sun sign?  She won't tell you, just assumes you know what that means from the beginning as if it were to basic to mention for a 101 course!).  Then, you at least hope the instructor would be able to competently answer questions from the audience, but you won't get that either.  The instructor tells you how things may be different in other astrological systems and that different works have different answers, or simply that she does not know, leaving you no better off and in fact more irritated than before the question was asked.  A DVD that by title and description comes off like it is going to be an Astrology 101 ""course"" and does not have any clear learning objectives and an organized and clear presentation of the basics is a rip off!  Regardless of how noble the instructor's intentions may have been, this is a subject that doesn't need any further damage from unprepared presentation.  The DVDs from the History Channel and the BBC on the Zodiac are more satisfying... but the best one from the U.K. still remains sold out.",1227571200,6,1929,4.608187134502924
