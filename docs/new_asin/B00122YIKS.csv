8243643,5,B00122YIKS,"I absolutely LOVE this DVD! It is the best money I have ever spent. I watch it all the time and usually keep it on as a background while I do other things. It makes you feel like you are on the tropical island with them. The music that goes along with the DVD is so soothing and relaxing.

You also get a bonus MP3 format of the musical soundtrack that is played on Tropical Tranquility. I put it on my iPod and burned a CD of it to listen in my vehicle. Love it! My puppy dogs love it too. It relaxes them when they go for car rides with me. :-)

I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who loves the tropics and wants to relax. It's great for soothing the winter blues too! A must buy for sure!",1328659200,,700,3.9225352112676055
8243644,5,B00122YIKS,"I love having this DVD playing in the background when I sit around and read. The images are extremely beautiful -- tropical beaches, swaying palm trees, sunsets, etc. These are real videos, not computer animation.

You can literally sit there and feel yourself relax.

THe music is fairly good, although I tend to mute it and play my own selection of music while using this for visuals only. There's a bonus MP3 file but I've never played it since I'm more interested in the images.",1226102400,,482,4.658823529411765
