7005923,5,B00TF7KYXC,"I have always loved Clint Eastwood and have most of his movies now on HD Blu-ray. This US set is a nice one put out by Universal. It is basically 2 individual sets put together in a nice black sleeve box. Clint's name in white lettering is ""raised"" so that when you  feel the packaging, you can feel the lettering and the midface photo underneath.
Set one is the ""Thrillers"" set which includes ~
COOGAN'S BLUFF
THE BEGUILED
PLAY MISTY FOR ME
THE EIGER SANCTION
* The Special Features on this set are pretty much ones that carried over from the ""Play Misty For Me"" Special Edition DVD and a few theatrical trailers for the movies themselves. The picture HD quality is pretty good and the sound is as well. There are a few subtitles as well for each.
Set two is the ""Westerns"" set which includes ~
TWO MULES FOR SISTER SARA
JOE KIDD
HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER
These are well done as well and look fabulous on the UHD 4K TV. If you have an upscaling 4K bluray player, the resolution will be 2160p.",1425600000,13,987,4.335135135135135

7005936,5,B00TF7KYXC,"This is a good mix of seven movies that weren't his biggest hits, but show his range as an actor. What should appeal is these are not usually part of the Spaghetti Western or Dirty Harry collections. All seven are very good movies and have great casts, story, music, scenery, and sets. Clint was first in this style movies and I still enjoy these movies over TV and movies that tried to copy them.",1508371200,,397,4.378378378378378

7005943,4,B00TF7KYXC,"Universal Studios'  sharp new transfer for bluray sold me on these. I've been Eastwood-deprived in my collection for reasons I can't quite express, other than for ages I have not liked the under-lit environments most of his directed films take place in. Its like he's trying to move the crew so fast he's limiting what the cinematographer can do. But these studio films are all pretty good ones; Coogan's Bluff is a lot of fun and while certainly  dated by the hippie-psychedelic scene that plays a part, it is still a strong Eastwood performance with a fine Lalo Schifrin score to accompany it. Those opening scenes in the desert do it for me.

The bluray transfers are all stellar, even those darker scenes come across much brighter than on standard def; the colors pop nicely on so many occasions I gave up counting and just enjoy. I made a good choice and it was very fairly priced.",1487116800,5,886,4.630573248407643
7005944,5,B00TF7KYXC,I  received this collection as a gift and I must say its a great mix of Clint's best films.  Definitely essential for the collector!,1487030400,,132,4.458333333333333
7005945,5,B00TF7KYXC,"I already had the four film Icon series set of 2011 and because I wanted the westerns to add to my collection I wasn't about to pay the exorbitant fee sellers wanted for the three film western icon set. On the other hand I had the choice of buying the westerns separately, but since they date to 2010 I was a little leery of their look. So I dove in a purchased this set;I wasn't disappointed. All the films are sharp and look fantastic. It doesn't say they have been remastered,but they have certainly been cleaned up.
I had seen the Leone westerns, but it was these films that caused me to latch onto Eastwood permanently. I usually do a synopsis for each film but I will forgo that this time around,due to the length of a review it would create. The only""clunker"" in this group,if you can call it that,is Beguiled. It was/is a strange concoction of a film and one of Clint's weakest. There are several featurettes in this set and trailers for the films. In conclusion I would recommend this set highly for all Eastwood fans. It shows a rising star on the cusp of super stardom and which now are part of the huge Eastwood dynasty of film work.",1483747200,,1145,4.380281690140845

Note that the discs are NOT double sided and contain 2 movies each except for disc 4, which contains only Play Misty for Me in one disc. DVD pack contents include: Disc 1: Two Mules for Sister Sara/The Eager Sanction, Disc 2: High Plains Drifter/Joe Kidd, Disc 3: Coogan's Bluff/The Beguiled, Disc 4: Play Misty for Me. Language audio options for ALL movies: English and French. Subtitles in English only. Widescreen presentations. Picture and audio quality very good and improved from other previous versions. Some of Clint Eastwood's best westerns are in this collection such as Two Mules for Sister Sara, Joe Kidd, and High Plains Drifter. These trio of westerns are among the best of all time that is for sure. Play Misty for Me and the Eager Sanction are excellent thrillers. Included too are Coogan's Bluff, which is a police story, and The Beguiled, another thriller. Good DVD pack from Universal Pictures!",1459900800,8,955,4.901234567901234

7005957,4,B00TF7KYXC,"I will let others review the packaging and the movies themselves.  I assume if you are looking at this set you already know the movies so reviewing them seems a little ridiculous.  The packaging as I noted I will leave to others.  Prices change, but at the time, 7 Blu-Ray movies (some that are fairly uncommon in BR) for about $44 is a very good deal in my opinion.  But this is a review of the conversion to Ultraviolet.

Most or many movies these days can be converted to Ultraviolet (not ""ripped"") but converted into a cloud library which is very convenient.  Most people are familiar with the codes we get in many newer movies, we enter the code and movie appears in our library and that movie is now owned in a digital format.  It can be streamed or downloaded to almost any device.  Many or most people are no aware that in addition to the codes, and in addition to paying the $7-$12 to purchase digital copies you can do a ""disc-to-digital"" conversion.  To do that you open the application, the application verifies that you actually have the physical disc and not an illegal copy, and for a cost of either $1. or $2. depending on how many you convert you can add Blu Rays in hi def your library.  The problem is some discs, particularly those that have been put together in new packaging like this are not coded correctly and they are not recognized as new and original copies so being able to convert them is a hit-or-miss prospect.  Additionally, some moves do not have license for the conversion.

Many of Clint's movies are approved for the process, I purchased a different set of 20 of his movies here at Amazon and 18 of 20 converted without issue (a pretty good conversion rate).  However, out of this set of 7 movies, not a single movie was recognized, not one.  So if planning to do an Ultraviolet or Vudu conversion look elsewhere this set is not for you it will not work.  If wanting this set simply to watch the Blu-Rays as it is designed it is perfectly fine and the price is good.  But this set does not work for conversion.",1447027200,24,2047,4.418666666666667
7005958,5,B00TF7KYXC,"This is an excellent collection from Universal studios covering the first period of Mr. Eastwood's growth as an actor and his first times and trials as a director. On the acting side Clint takes on a few roles that stretch him into the territory of being either a charming manipulator (The Beguiled) or self-centered womanizer who gets in too deep just when he is trying to settle down (Play Misty For Me). On the directing side the previously mentioned Misty is his first film directing and, while a bit clunky at times, it does have some clever framing and flows very well story-wise. His following directing job is on High Plains Drifter, a spot-on tribute to the director who helped Mr. Eastwood breakout, Sergio Leone. The remainder of the set (Two Mules For Sister Sara, Joe Kidd, Coogan's Bluff, and The Eiger Sanction) continues to showcase this important period of growth for Clint. The films all look magnificent on Blu-Ray, as you would expect. Highly recommended!",1442102400,14,975,4.879518072289157

THE BEGUILED, COOGAN'S BLUFF, PLAY MISTY FOR ME, THE EIGER SANCTION, HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER,
TWO MULES FOR SISTER SARA & JOE KIDD, keep them, no point waste of money buying this boxset

all Universal have done this time around is re-issued all 7 films on blu-ray as usual in box set packaging thou
not sure if the Discs have their own blu-ray case/artwork or if all 7 Discs are packed into one big fold out Digi-pak
but i am sure of the special features/extras, there are no new extras
all you get is the exact same special features from the original blu-ray releases that's it
about the picture quality & the Audio all 7 films have High Definition widescreen transfers of course
i can't comment on all the Eastwood Universal blu-ray's, cause i don't have them all, i love his western films
so i can tell you about High plains Drifter, Joe Kidd, Two mules for sister sara, i do have the Eiger sanction thou
with High plains Drifter the HD transfer looks beautiful actually, very sharp & clear quality in 2:35:1 ratio
universal made lots of effort with the picture quality for sure, much better than the old dvd version
the sound quality has been boosted to a new 5.1 Master audio mix, which sounds really Good, again better than the old dvd audio
no extras of course except for original Theatrical trailer
i would've been surprised if Universal made an effort to an interview with Clint eastwood about this film

Joe Kidd- is the same i believe is the same treatment as the High plains drifter transfer a beautiful HD transfer
audio quality is the same 5.1 master mix
again no new extras except for trailer- what a surprise
Two mules for sister sara- again same HD treatment as the other 2, same 5.1 mix, no extras thou
The Eiger sanction, the same HD transfer & same 5.1 mix
the only difference between this new re-issued box set and the original blu-ray versions is the packaging that's it
no new special features at all
so if you don't have the original blu-ray versions, then buy the boxset or
buy the individual titles which have their own case & artwork anyway, so up to you
4-5stars for the Eastwood universal films
1-2 stars for this new boxset, cause there is nothing new about it, just a recycle-understand.",1435276800,3,2267,4.5675675675675675
