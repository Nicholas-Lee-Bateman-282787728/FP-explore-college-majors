2402875,5,B000B6CO3O,"Yes Christmas in Summer down under, and in a long gone era.  I first viewed this film when I was about eight or so, with my Grandpa stating how he actually filmed this movie.  It is a long gone era in Australian history with everyone having a slight British accent, but northern hemi-sphere viewers do get to see Christmas in the summer instead of winter.  As for some of the references to Aboriginals.......my kids didn't even pick them up (6 & 7 ages), funny to think how half these lines would now have this movie poorly judged, but as I said my kids didn't even pick them up and laughed with the jokes.  And my kids are black!  This movie also featured the late Chips Rafferty who was one of Australia's most premiered stars, and always portrayed that so called ""Australian look and sound"".",1105920000,14,794,4.486111111111111
2402876,4,B000B6CO3O,"This film is a light-hearted film that kids and adults will enjoy.  I had a laugh at the way Australians were portrayed - It was so exaggerated. It made it funny in a nice way- I reckon if they re-released the film, it would almost get cult status. Mum in the kitchen cooking and all perfectly made up in the middle of the Bush.  The stereotypical portrayal of Aboriginals  (which are referred to as blackefellas believe it or not) as good stockman and trackers. (which they were but there is alot more to ABoriginals than that - ie their culture, spirituality).  The Aussie kids all blond and freckled with names like Snow (How original!)

2402932,5,B000B6CO3O,"Ben Mankiewicz made a big deal out of Chips Rafferty's star billing in the movie, as though his presence was enough reason to see any movie he appeared in.  But in this one Chips is subdued rather, and plays one of three horse thieves who make life miserable for a bunch of white farmers scattered over the bush country of Australia during Christmas week.  The other two thieves are comically dumpy and round, and at least a head sorter than Chips, so when he walks among them he looks like a maypolethey call him ""Long Bill,"" and you can see why.  When the three thieves are together they invariably resemble a phallus and two testicles, no matter which way they disport themselves.

The real magic of the film is an enchanting cast of kids, one Aboriginal boy called ""Neza,"" one English boy visiting Oz called ""Michael,"" he 's the one with the eye-glasses rather like Piggy in Lord of the Fliesand a white boy and his two sisters who are Australian born and bred, independent beyond belief, feisty, realistically not always perfect angels.  The younger girl, ""Snow,"" is so much like a little boy that I'm sure many who watch the movie think she is a boyI've read the other reviewers' comments here and see how they could stumble into this error, because you would simply never see as androgynous a character in any movie made for kids today, in this country or in Australia.  She is amazing, a performance that could stand next to that of Margaret O'Brien in Meet Me in St Louis, or little Jean-Pierre Laud in Les quatre cent coups.  I guess ""Snow"" is ironic because in Australia, Christmas arrives in igh summer when the kids get off of school for summer vacation.  The Christmas tree the parents decorate is so cheap ad garish looking, it makes the one from Charlie Brown's Christmas look ready for the White House lawn.  I never did figure out why the tree is so crumby, especially when the mother and father are drop dead farmer chic, the mother in particular wearing the ""new Look"" of Christian Dior way out in the Bush, rolling pie crusts with her hair perfectly styled and maquillage just so.  They are surprised when their kids, none of them over ten I guess, don't show up after three days off on horseback from the back country.  I guess kids just had more freedom in a wild country.

Starving, the kids wind up cooking over an outdoor fire a big skillet of snakes, and then live grubs, wriggling in closeup like the most horrifying science class you ever took in middle school.  Then you see them disappear down the kids' throats.  I hope all concerned got hazard pay for that one scene.  Nothing else in the movie is half as disgusting, but it is a tense movie and makes later Disney ripoffs like ""Spin and Marty"" look flat and malnourished.  Hail to ""Bush Christmas,"" with ""Love Actually"" the best Christmas picture I've seen in ages.",1388275200,,2849,4.578740157480315
2402933,5,B000B6CO3O,"My husband and I enjoyed this story.  There were some things that reminded me of my childhood.  My sisters and I had some of that glorious freedom.

2402937,5,B000B6CO3O,"For one horrible moment when I received the DVD, I thought it had been ""colourised"", as the photos on the cover are in colour.  Thank heaven I was wrong; it's presented in the original black and white.

This film, made in 1947, was a smash hit children's movie in Australia and Europe when it was released.  It has remained popular ever since; I remember that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation used to screen it annually sometime before Christmas (which is where I got my scratchy old video copy from).

I love this film.  It is a nostalgic trip down memory lane for me as I grew up on a remote sheep / grazing property in the 1960s.  This film take us back to a simpler time when - in rural Australia - children were an integral part of farming operations; they could ride, muster and undertake all aspects of farm work (and were expected to), regardless of gender or race.  There was little mollycoddling and they were given a level of independence and self determination that is totally unheard of today.  Imagine someone today sending a 6 year old off on a horse, with minimal equipment, for several days camping in the bush (with all those nasty snakes & waterholes & things) under the supervision of a 11 - 12 year old!!  Unlikely I think.

Some people have found the Aboriginal references ""not PC"".  I disagree with this opinion.  Take the young Aboriginal boy, Neza.  Who finds the horses' tracks, and recognizes the fact that if they don't follow NOW, they'll lose them?  Neza.  Who feeds them whey they have run out of food?  Neza.  Who suggests that most effective strategy, stealing the horse duffers' boots?  Neza.  He is a little hero; his superior bushcraft is vital to the whole movement of the film.  His difference (i.e. when the children are smearing their faces with charcoal to carry out ""night operations"") is not treated in a pejorative way.  He has got black skin, so the charcoal is more than somewhat unnecessary.  It is funny, and you are allowed to have a chuckle.  The children are all in this together, so race or gender are not really issues; it is more the skills that each child has, even young 6 year old Snow.  They all make valuable contributions.  However, the background adults - the children's parents and Neza's Aboriginal stockman / tracker father) - are much more 'stock' characters, but their character development throughout the film is basically unnecessary.  They are part of the background.

The cast is very well chosen, with the standout character being Long Bill, played by that quintessential Aussie actor, Chips Rafferty.

The film's charm arises from many sources.  The children are endearing, clever and inventive.  The baddies are funny.  They get their just desserts (and how!!)  There is a thrilling finale.  The story moves along at a gentle pace, not too fast for children, but not too slow for adults.

This is a great Australian film, well worth the watch.",1361318400,10,2923,4.745526838966203

2402951,5,B000B6CO3O,"Back in Holland while I was a young girl in Highschool, my sister took me to see Bush Christmas.  This story is so believable and the characters are real.  These children are not going to let some bush rangers steal their favourite horse and spoil Christmas.  Christmas in Australia is a wonderful time, it's about being free and relaxed.  That's what this story is all about.  The typical Australian courage to tackle anything, anywhere. Even the English boy Michael loves to be part of this adventure.  Australia is adventure and the bush even more so.  Watch this movie and enjoy the Australian way of celebrating and taking charge.",1307491200,5,635,4.824074074074074
2402952,5,B000B6CO3O,"5 stars all the way.  I love this movie and have watched it many times.  Chips Rafferty is brilliant in his role as the horse thief.  But, I must be fair......the whole cast is brilliant.  The only downside, for me anyway, is the tendency back then, to have overseas actors playing Australians.  This time, the actors were mainly British.  Chips Rafferty was a real dinki-di Aussie though.  Excellent family movie with comedy thrown in.....what more could you ask for.  A must have for any collection.",1296691200,,501,4.811764705882353
2402953,4,B000B6CO3O,"'Bush Christmas' is a movie filmed down-under in the Australian outback around the mid 1940's or the early 1950's. Four young children have just broken up for the summer school holidays and find themselves caught up in a pre-Christmas adventure of trying to rescue one of the children's parents prized horses. This movie is not only a trip down nostalgia lane,it is also a historical record of how we celebrated Christmas during these times. I found this movie to be a little gem to keep for those of us whom do not celebrate Christmas in the northern hemisphere. I know this film does not contain the razzmatazz that the Hollywood blockbusters lay claim to, but it is for this very reason because of its simplicity and innocence that I think is worth having in one's Christmas collection.",1286496000,7,789,4.766423357664234

2402958,4,B000B6CO3O,"Don't be scared away by the title, ""Bush Christmas"" (1947) has nothing to do with George W. or his father. They are referring to the Australian ""Bush"" and this is a children's film that no doubt was a heavy influence on Nicholas Roeg""s ""Walkabout"" (1971); as well as its source novel by James Vance Marshall. In both a small band of children find themselves in the bush country and out of their element, getting survival tips from a native boy. ""A Far Off Place"" (1993) and ""Alaska"" (1996) also appropriated many elements of the story. ""Bush Christmas"" is the least gritty of the four films but the most believable and the least manipulative.

It should remind the viewer of the modern Australian television show ""Saddle Club"" as the kids are around horses all the time; even riding them to and from school. And the plot involves Grinch-inspired horse thieves who almost ruin Christmas for the family when they steal their prize mare, leaving her young colt behind. So the five children head into the bush to track down the horse thieves, while their parents and the police search for them. There is even a Ghost Town (also found in ""Walkabout"") although you have to suspend disbelief when the until now very perceptive children inexplicably take too long to recognize that the horse thieves are its only residents.

Worth noting is that Helen Grieve plays the only girl in this group of adventurous children but there is no condescension to her, she rides better than the boys and takes on a kind of ""Wendy"" from ""Peter Pan"" role in the group.

Christmas in the southern hemisphere is a summer event but the holiday is still celebrated with winter wonderland decorations, presents, and a tree.
