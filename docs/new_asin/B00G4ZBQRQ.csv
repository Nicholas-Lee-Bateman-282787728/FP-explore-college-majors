8620819,5,B00G4ZBQRQ,"I was looking forward to watching ""Paris Countdown"" and was pleased to find that there is an English-language audio version on the DVD (the original French is there, too, along with English subtitles.) LOADS of action, suspense and a few scenes which are a bit difficult to watch, because of the graphic nature!

This is what happens when the bad guys meet the REALLY bad guys. Enjoy!",1389398400,2,384,4.731343283582089
