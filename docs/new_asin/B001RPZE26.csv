3777781,4,B001RPZE26,"What an incredible depiction of those horrible events. The story (and DVD) are very cut and dry, no additions or dramatic overtones/liberties taken with plot lines - just a solid portrayal of horrendous events.

The story follows Albert Fish towards the last 10 years of his life as he devolves into the convicted homicidal cannibal. The police end of the story is concise and centers mostly on the lead detective King, who intermittently narrates his part of the film. Bauchau's display of Fish appears to be very authentic, down to the painful self mutilation he became known for. Even the supporting roles were abrupt but relevant for the film.

The camera work and period recreation were done articulately, and there was never a time of picking apart cityscapes or props. Nothing distracts from the overall story, even when it came time for there to be chances for gory scenes, they instead chose to go with suspenseful angles and figuring on the viewer would know what happened. The sound is unfortunately 2.0 and DVD is devoid of anything supplemental. Typically, films that cover these topics have at least epilogues, informative supplementals, period design pics, etc. But nothing here. The cover art is frustrating as they keep trying to push this as a Hannibal Lecter attachment, but this stands on its own. The R rating is strictly for themes as almost everything is assumed (no actual butcher/bloodbath footage or kids in distress - like Changeling).",1240876800,33,1462,5.012345679012346

Fish came from a brutal orphanage.  As an adult he was a self-mutilator and gave his back lashings, which are horrible to see.  He kidnapped children, murdered them and ate their flesh.  A good part of the movie involves the detective on his case and the family of one little girl he took away and killed.  The mother is quite human as, after Fish is convicted, she enjoys the publicity she gets of posing for newspaper photos.  This movie is not for children.

3777885,2,B001RPZE26,"While I'm not a fan of the true crime serial killer genre--the movies tend to be depressing without working as thrillers or entertainment on any level--The Gray Man has elements to recommend it.  Albert Fish was one of America's the first and most notorious serial killers--a child molester, cannibal, and murderer who operated in the early 20th century when such horrors were likely unimaginable for most people.

The Gray Man boasts fairly solid production values and period details and a surprisingly nuanced performance by Patrick Bauchau as Albert Fish, who seems like a kindly old man, although his attentiveness to children does alarm more than one mother who senses that there is something off about the man.

Unfortunately, The Grey Man is a pretty dry film, not really getting very far inside the head of the killer after a promising start and spending an inordinately long amount of time on the problematic police investigation that eventually nabbed him without generating any real tension along the way.  The police detective on Albert Fish's trail is admirably tenacious to the point where he ends up having a nervous breakdown, but that doesn't make that part of the film any more interesting dramatically and it would have been in the film's best interests to focus on Albert Fish more and the police investigation much less..

The Gray Man might please fans of the true crime genre--but if you are looking for insights into the mind of a monster, this movie will inevitably disappoint.  Albert Fish remains an enigma, although he is still pretty much the only interesting character in the film.  The last section after Albert Fish is captured feels unnecessary and rushed--it would have been better to just end the film earlier and say that he was executed for his crimes.  Instead, we get a few minutes of courtroom scenes that aren't very illuminating, no sense of how the Fish trial was treated by the press and a dramatically flat scene of Fish's children arguing about whether they should have known what their father was doing or not.  It's all very blah, with no dramatic punch whatsoever.

Patrick Bauchau's portrayal of Albert Fish is ultimately the only reason to sit through this film but he's largely absent from the second half of the film, taking with him The Gray Man's only real dramatic interest.  This one is not recommended unless you happen to be a big fan of the true crime serial killer genre.",1470787200,,2432,4.878640776699029

3777921,5,B001RPZE26,"This is actually a decent film. There were a slew of recognizable actors who did a better than decent job.

The Gray Man is a fairly accurate historical account of the sadomasochistic serial killer Albert (Randall) Fish, aka the Gray Man, aka the Werewolf of Wysteria, PERHAPS he was also the Brooklyn Vampire. (Who comes up with these monikers?) He was active from 1924 through 1934, when he kidnapped and murdered multiple children, namely Francis X. McDonnell, aged 8,  Billy Gaffney, aged 8 and Grace Budd, aged 10. He is alleged to have boasted about perpetrating crimes against more than 100 kids, but it's unknown whether he meant sexual molestation or murder and cannibalism. (Perhaps it was both?)

This film focuses on the final 10 years of this life, although we're given glimpses of the childhood events that helped shape him. He frequently engaged in self-flagellation, and is reported to have inserted more than 20 needles into his pelvic region. (Ewww!) It was very obvious that he suffered from some kind of religious mania.

We're taken through the painstaking investigation of the disappearance of 10 year old Grace Budd, whose vanishing is initially handled as a stranger kidnapping. The investigation was hampered by the mis-identification of the perpetrator by Grace Budd's mother. (What lay people don't know is that eyewitness identification is horribly unreliable and has definitely sent more than a few innocent people to prison, and very probably more than a few innocents to the gallows.)

If you are interested more in the chronology of events of his crimes, you'll appreciate this film. I'm trying to figure out if I liked this one so much bc I've seen far too many duds, or because this was a gripping movie. I can say that the script was well written, nothing seemed overdramatized, and most of the parts were played by talented, recognizable actors. There isn't a lot of gore and most of the gruesome aspects are subtle. If you know the basic facts behind the Fish story, you'll find this an interesting adaptation.",1457740800,7,2047,4.956268221574344

I do not know anything about the ""real case"" of Mr. Fish; therefore, it did not bother me to know--or not know--what the exact details were. An old man, severely beaten as a boy by a woman he learned to hate, had grown into a monster who took revenge. He replaced the innocent of the young and punished them in the most severest way imaginable; he defiled his own body to take revenge upon the woman who beat him into some sort of submission. The ones he killed represented those who had inflicted pain upon him. He took revenge in the most grotesque manner known to humans--eating each other. Regardless of the exact details, I should think that this is a movie to learn from; that child-abuse, in any form, results in more of the same and/or worse. This film is about the affects of such punishment in our formative years and how the pain is manifested later in life. The brain is a complicated organ; it has a mind of its own and none of us actually thinks exactly alike. The lesson you should learn is--think before you whip your child; think before you use belittling remarks; think before you scold unfairly.",1452643200,9,1257,4.641255605381166

""Werewolf of Wisteria"", named after a region of New York City.  Not widely known were his travels to islands where he learned
his cannibal  tendencies, and perversions, loosely woven with religious beliefs that he felt were cleansing him and absolving him
of all murders and atrocities. Of all 16 sexual perversions, Albert Fish was involved in pretty much all of them, including eating human flesh, drinking urine, and eating human feces. He was a traveler in his early life, where he accessed these tendencies and then released his bastion of violence afterward wherever he went.  A true study in Psychological classes, teaches that the true to life devil, and evil, lives inside people that look normal and operate in society virtually unnoticed. No real tally of all his murders were ever realized., being scattered around the world and continents. And even then, the realization of the term Serial murderer had not crossed the minds of sane, rational people.

3778125,5,B001RPZE26,"I've seen the film ""Silence of the Lambs"" (SOTL) quite a few times, and I've always thought that it was really good, especially for the genre.  And while I gave that film 5 stars, perhaps that rating was a little too high.  After all, I'm going 5 on this one as well, and I believe that ""Gray Man"" is better than SOTL.

This is surely more realistic, but of course that's not completely fair, as this is based upon a true story about Albert Fish, a Depression-era ""gentleman"" who who had a bad habit of sending disgusting letters to women, and had a worse habit of killing and eating young children.  On the other hand, Hannibal Lecter and his sidekick ""Buffalo Bill"" were a couple of fictional characters based upon an amalgam of assorted real-life serial killers, such as Ed Gein and maybe even Gary Ridgway.  So you'd expect this story to be more realistic.

I think that ""Gray Man"" didn't actually get the kudos that it maybe deserves from an artistic standpoint.  I really like the camera work here -- note the dramatic camera angles in some key scenes that create a real sense of dread -- and the colors and costumes are spot on.  The attention to period detail is fantastic.

But the acting in this film is also surprisingly strong.  In particular, it's hard to imagine that the producer and casting director could have chosen anyone better than Patrick Bauchau in the lead role, even though he most likely is more refined than Mr. Fish ever was.  And I was pleasantly surprised to see that Silas Weir Mitchell plays Mr. Fish's son as well; he's the Werewolf-like-Wessen guy in ""Grimm,"" a show that I really like.  Even though Mr. Mitchell will most likely never win an Oscar, he's very good and is very likable.  But the real star here is Jack Conley, who plays the lead detective who will even sacrifice his health in his six-year quest for the killer.

I watched a documentary several years ago entitled ""Albert Fish.""  And while that documentary is only so-so, it is so shocking that not only did my mouth drop open several times, but it got me interested in the true-crime genre in the first place as well.  I also just finished reading ""Deranged,"" an aptly-titled book by Harold Schecter that was also really good.  So naturally, this movie was nearly a must-see for me, although I believe that this will be the end of the Albert Fish story for me after this.  My hunger for this story has luckily been satiated; too bad Mr. Fish's never was.

It is interesting that it seems to be more socially acceptable to appreciate films such as SOTL over films such as ""Gray Man.""  The writers of SOTL avoided one subject that makes that film more palatable from a societal perspective:  no children were killed in that film, from what I remember.  (A young girl was held captive but was eventually rescued, is all that I will say to avoid most spoilers.)  Here, while the director never actually shows children being killed, you know that they are.  And you do see some evidence of it after-the-fact, in a few grisly scenes.

While the story is not exactly the same as what happened in real life -- the way that Mr. Fish first meets Grace Budd I believe has been modified a bit, and a few other liberties have been taken here and there, none that seem to really matter -- it is mostly true to the real tale.  But what I really liked:  the way that the writer/director tell parallel stories here, one from the perspective of Mr. Fish, and one from the perspective of the detective chasing him.  So it's not simply some boring police procedural.

I'll give a strong recommendation on this film if you know anything about this story.  But for modern-day parents of young children -- I have none of my own -- this should be required viewing.  After all, it shows social engineering of the worst kind and may give a few hints on what to avoid.  But I'll add that ""Gray Man"" does it in a very artistic and tasteful way, at least as much as is possible with one Albert Fish.",1389139200,2,3971,4.5027932960893855

3778128,1,B001RPZE26,"Albert Fish is probably the most monstrous of our known human monsters.
Although he was convicted and electrocuted for the murder of one little girl, he taunted his captors that he was also responsible for a hundred more missing child/person cases.
The Gray Man comes across as a movie that's very careful not to shock anyone.
Portraying this human nightmare is handsome, talented, charming Patrick Bauchau. In no way does he suggest darkness, psychosis or evil. Granted, a few scenes depict his violent masochism when he beats himself with a belt, but other than that, everything in this movie is all clean, glossy, sunny. It could almost qualify as a movie fit for the Disney channel.
Even the main event--when Fish persuades the parents of a pretty little girl to accompany him to a picnic--is glossed over. We see the couple going to an isolated farm house. Fish enters first and goes upstairs to prepare for the human butchery. Then he sticks his head out the window and asks for the child to join him.
This is a  movie that should shock and unnerve the viewer to hit home the diabolical evil of this man.
Research shows that physically, Fish looked strange, thin, grizzled. Bauchau is like a romantic lead from another movie.
The Gray Man needed an Alfred Hitchcock to be in charge--or some of the up and coming horror experts.
This movie shouldn't be presented as a glossy looking little peek into the l920s with everyone nicely dressed and the weather always sunny. I was expecting to be scared and repulsed--in a cinematic way--when I read that this movie was based on the life of Albert Fish.

3778129,5,B001RPZE26,"This movie, which could have been done with the horrendous gore and spectacular vividness of today's special effects teams, was very tastefully done instead. The film tells the awful story without dwelling in the sensational, but taking the real life characters to present them as nearly true to life as possible. Having watched the filming of this movie made me aware of this early serial killer in America that has escaped the modern world's attention. He killed and cannibalized children. He was evil personified, yet...he was a father of six children himself, a single parent who was so tortured by his obsessions that he punished himself in gruesome ways to try to atone for the murders. Albert Fish, a name known to only those who study aberrations in humans, is portrayed brilliantly by Patrick Bauchau. Jack Conley plays the almost washed up detective who actually puts together the random molestations and disappearances of children in the 1920's, working the case of one child. He follows leads that take him on a six year mind-bending mission until he finally is able to track down the amazingly twisted Fish.

3778134,3,B001RPZE26,"The Gray Man (Scott Flynn, 2007)

Interesting if minor film about one of America's most notorious serial killers and the manhunt that brought him to justice. Flynn's first (and to date last) directorial effort, and it shows, but there's actually quite a bit to like here if you're willing to look under the amateurish hood.

Albert Fish (Patrick Bauchau, recently of 2012) is the nice, if kind of creepy, guy next door. That is, unless you have a small child. Then he becomes the not-so-nice, really creepy guy next door, because he wants to have your tots come over for dinner. As the main course. Fish also has himself some pretty nasty anger issues, which he usually vents in long, rambling letters to the local papers. As we pick up the story, Al is on the hunt for a new victim, when the law gets a whiff of what he might have been up to. This is the law in the form of Will King (Fast and Furious' Jack Conley), the kind of obsessed detective you find in just about every serial killer movie (if you were one of the unfortunates who saw The Black Dahlia, you know what I mean). With the cops hot on his tail, Fish spots what he believes to be his perfect victim: Grace Budd (Lexi Ainsworth, currently taking a turn on General Hospital). Parallel tracks run in the movie as Fish seduces Grace and the cops close in on Fish.

Fish was right in at least one respect; Budd was his perfect victim. It was her murder for which he was put on trial and executed. As such, it does make sense for the movie to focus on his relationship with Budd and her family (though despite the movie's R rating, it soft-pedals pretty much every aspect of that relationship), though that leaves a gold mine of known and suspected information about Fish to be mined for future films. In any case, as I said before, this is Flynn's first directorial effort, and it shows; it stumbles on a fairly regular basis in at least one aspect (pacing is a big one here, to the point where every once in a while it seems Flynn doesn't quite know where to end a given shot), but the acting from the principals and the material is strong enough to make this at least worth watching.
