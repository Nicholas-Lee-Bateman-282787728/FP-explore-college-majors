2679336,3,B000JU8HEW,"This is not remastered and it is B&W.
The film is washed out to the point I had to turn my brightness down to 40% to see facial features.
Still seems like it still has too much contrast but on a 60 inch screen I found it tollerable.",1475366400,,232,3.8541666666666665

2679344,5,B000JU8HEW,Rock Rock Rock ! was released in 1956. It starred Tuesday Weld as a girl trying to buy a new prom dress. Connie Francis did her singing. Good support is provided by Tony Randazzo.,1436659200,,179,4.294117647058823

2679347,4,B000JU8HEW,"For those of us ""oldies""-in our own rights-this film should be looked upon as a terrific historical piece. The story's o.k., but the highlight is seeing so many of the early rock acts perform...it's well worth the space on your DVD library shelf-honest! Just a note: early ""Rock"" films seem to have been written to show the views of adults in that era...so we get potential white gangers/hoodlums/and ridiculous behavior. The '50's really weren't nearly so exciting as the movie industry made it out to be...and Sal Mineo hardly represents the era-nor will he ever...",1431561600,,567,4.978947368421053

2679352,5,B000JU8HEW,"This film needs a proper release. This is a very poor transfer. It looks like a 16mm dupe print transferred to VHS, and then that VHS transferred to DVD. It's really a shame to see this film in such poor condition. The film itself - GREAT 1950's rock and roll movie with the sweet Tuesday Weld. She could be interviewed as one of the special features.  I would like to see this film given a proper DVD and Blu-ray release.",1406937600,,422,4.275

2679368,1,B000JU8HEW,"What a disappointment. But, ALP is notorious for putting bad transfers on DVD. They used to be sold for one dollar in Walmart stores too. They never restore any title and they use whatever they can for their source, 8mm, 16mm and copying from a VHS tape. I tossed this one away. Faded picture and it looks like it was copied from a kinescope from TV or else another source. They have a lesser price then people won't bother to return them when they see how bad they are.",1340582400,,470,4.292134831460674

2679370,1,B000JU8HEW,"I should have gone with the Remastered DVD, as this DVD is worse than the one I made using my old VHS tape of Rock Rock Rock. Many scenes are so light and bleached out that you can't see the detail of the faces or clothes. Apparently an old, worn copy of the film was used for this DVD transfer. The music used is great as always, but I recommend you purchase the remastered version. It is almost twice as much as this version, but it would be worth seeing this film restored, especially with all the rock 'n roll acts featured on this film. The plot is silly and mindless, the acting stiff and wooden (especially by a young Tuesday Weld), but all this adds to the innocence and charm of this cult classic. It's a shame the picture quality is so poor.",1314316800,15,751,4.222222222222222
2679371,1,B000JU8HEW,"This D V D's Image transfer from the original film is extremely poor quality. So much so, that is should not be sold by Amazon.com. I returned the d v d.",1310688000,10,153,3.967741935483871
2679372,5,B000JU8HEW,This is a slice of early 60s Americana. Some of the better known acts of the day compliled into a fun DVD. The drama features a very young Tuesday Weld. (Connie Francis is doing her singing for her.) The plot is pretty simple and some of the acting is laughable but for some reason it adds to the overall appeal of this production of a less complicated time in our country. The footage of Frankie Lymon and Laverne Baker are rare jems that are worth the money you pay for the DVD by themselves.,1296518400,5,494,4.26595744680851

2679374,1,B000JU8HEW,"the story line is what to expect from early rock films - weak, but contains performances of a number or rock stars and of course includes a look at Alan Freed a real co-inventor and promoter of rock and roll.
This film is of very poor quality transfer and I would search for another company for a decent remaster.",1263772800,28,313,4.322033898305085
2679375,5,B000JU8HEW,"A true classic from the dawn of Rock and Roll.  In addition to featuring the lovely Tuesday Weld, this film delivers some seminal performances from the early giants of the genre.  Most notable are Chuck Berry and the highly talented Little Frankie Lymon.
Adding to the nostalgic joy, the bonus feature, Rhythm and Blues Review, puts some of the talented, overlooked artists of the era on glorious display.
If you love the music that started it all, these two films are a must!",1242259200,9,476,4.72289156626506

8153127,3,B000JU8HEW,"""Digitally Remastered"" mon oeil ! La photo couverture peut-tre. Si quelqu'un a rellement ""remasteris"" le film,  sa place je ne m'en venterais pas. Cela dit, le tout se mrite quand mme 3 toiles. Pourquoi ? entre autre parce que la majorit des chansons sont interprtes au complet, sans insertion de dialogue des comdiens. Par contre, sauf l'poustouflante interprtation de feu Chuck Berry, aucune des autres chansons n'a survcu au passage du temps. C'tait une suite de chanson absolument non-mmorables. Le scnario est pauvre, mais c'est ce  quoi je m'attendais d'un film d'ado des annes 50. Les personnages sont strotyps, les situations convenues, et les valeurs proposes compltement dpasses ; mais encore une fois, je m'y attendais.",1503532800,,730,5.2844827586206895

8153129,1,B000JU8HEW,"This is the worst dvd I've ever purchased.  I saw the movie once on tv.  The story line is stupid, but the old music groups were great.  The film on the dvd is all washed out, but the program I saw on tv was just fine.  It looks like a bad bootleg copy.  The image on the dvd freezes many times.  I could put up with that, but half way through, the movie it just quits.  No, I don't have issues with my dvd player.  It's just fine.  In my opinion, if you get this dvd for free, you've still paid too much.  Wish I could give it zero stars.  I wish I got around to viewing it before my return rights expired.",1501977600,,607,3.8536585365853657
8153130,3,B000JU8HEW,"The second feature, ""Rhythm and Blues Review"" from 1955 is the better of the two movies, from my point of view.  The singers in ""Rock, Rock, Rock"" may have had a certain degree of popularity but, for the most part, these are not their hit songs.  Probably their next record release and this was just a publicity effort to get sales for the new record.

The plot is nothing more than Tuesday Weld's scheming to get a new dress for the prom.  Pitiful!  Sort of like Ozzie and Harriet where Ozzie cannot make up which sweater he should wear.  Seriously, it was nice to see LaVerne Baker, one of the all-time best R&B/R&R singers.  I think Bo Diddley is on guitar as one of the Moonglows.  I saw Teddy Randazzo perform at a big rock and roll package show in Honolulu in around 1957 or 1958, after this movie was made.

The ""Rhythm and Blues Review"" (71 minutes) is pretty good music and entertainment except for the atrocious picture quality.  You get to see Big Joe Turner doing ""Shake, Rattle and Roll"", Cab Calloway doing ""Minnie the Moocher"", and my favorite was the Delta Rhythm Boys singing ""Them Dry Bones"".  So good!  Also you see Herb Jeffries about 15 years after he was the first and only black singing cowboy back in 1939 - 1940!  Sarah Vaughn, Nat King Cole, and so many other great entertainers of the day.  Nipsy Russell and Mantan Moreland do the routine where they are holding a conversation but neither lets the other finish a sentence, as they already know what the other is going to say.  Funny.

Picture quality ranges from acceptable on down to terrible.  But where else can you get this movie?  Go ahead and spend the few bucks.",1501545600,,1647,4.488215488215488
