2258443,5,B0008ENIR0,"I'm a huge fan of LFN, have been since it came out on USA. And I would have to agree that it is far superior to such shows as Alias. And I can't wait to see more of Peta Wilson as she does more film roles. Any fans of her's should check her out in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. She's also had roles in a few other films such as Mercy and Loser. Her filmography can be looked up on imdb.",1117929600,10,395,3.8292682926829267
2258444,5,B0008ENIR0,"I really wish people would stop comparing LFN to other tv shows, especially Alias.  I love Alias, am a huge fan of the show, but while I have only seen the first 2 seasons of LFN so far (since I just bought them on DVD in March when the 2nd season was released) I would have to say that the 2 shows just aren't comparable...  They are both spy shows but that is basically where the similarities end.  Alias is a great show (a little slow and boring through this past season since it was acting as filler until they could get around to the good stuff) but I would HATE it if they tried to make it more like LFN, and in turn, I would hate LFN if they had gone on and turned it into something like Alias (or 24 or MI-5 etc).

LFN takes you through the life of someone that had nothing to do with that lifestyle, and basically throws that person into it without a choice, oh well, she did have a choice, Live and do it with their rules, or Die... Not much of a choice which is what was great about it (and the original movie as well). The great part of the tv show was that they took the main basis of the movie and then were able to not only expand on it some, but have a whole 5 seasons to do whatever they wanted with it. They focus on Nikita with ""jobs"" being just that... They never really seem to have a whole lot to do with the main plot or at least not for long.  They whole point is about HER and how she evolves as she needs to, to stay alive ...  Alias focuses more on Rambaldi and the Prophecy and evil/good power with all characters and they like to throw in eye candy clothes with cool moves, and great music to help draw people in (no problem in that as long as you don't take it for more than that).

But this is about LFN, so let's cut back to that.  I first jumped into the LFN fan pool, drooling over the 2 seasons and knowing (or at least hoping for) the 3rd to be released this summer... I had no idea in the beginning just How Many seasons there were and then found out there were 5 (you lucky b@st*rds that got to see all 5 on tv).  I am going crazy waiting for the next month to go by, and I know I will totally drive myself insane waiting for the next 2 seasons over the next 2 years...

I never got to see the series when it originally aired on tv since I was homeless at the time (and I am a punk rocker).  Seeing the French movie version(on cable in February) then the series (in March) has made me feel a little odd and wonder if that could actually happen and possibly happen to some of the people I know... Hmmm, the conspiracy theories that could evolve.",1117152000,18,2582,4.003891050583658
2258445,5,B0008ENIR0,"This show is definitely a unique one. That's probably why the show didn't have a lot of success throughout Europe, and probably why it did not attract the huge audience like the incredibly stupid show Buffy or Charmed, and why it took so long for it to be released on DVD.

Not a superficial show like others (Smallville, Alias or what you call it, O.C.). A very convincing storyline with very credible actors who really fit the role in the show. How can somebody even try to compare Jennifer Garner to Peta Wilson?? Though Wilson obviously has not appeared on the big screen so far (whatever the reasons are), she did a fantastic job in here role as Nikita. Needless to mention the amazing performance of Roy Dupuis as Michael.

And more importantly, what's rare on TV these days, the show is about a serious relationship between adults, not teenagers. Though the story is very creative and exciting, the love between Nikita and Michael overshadows all other elements of the show.

Overwhelming score music by Sean Callery.

LFN, a show that has already become a classic.

LFN forever",1116374400,20,1085,4.75
2258446,5,B0008ENIR0,"La Femme Nikita was the FIRST television show to ever have a strong, intelligent female as the lead.  The actors are all of the highest caliber and the plots/story lines are so engaging, you'll be hooked after just one episode.  If this series had been on a major network at the time it originally aired, it would have been on MUCH longer.  Alias doesn't hold a candle to this show (as a matter of fact, they steal a lot of their stories from LFN).  Jennifer Garner only wishes she was as believable as Peta Wilson is in this type of role.  Roy Dupuis (Michael) is also an amazing actor and is HUGE in Canada.  This was a show that believed it's audience to be intelligent, but can be enjoyed by everyone.  It has the right mix of romance, action, intrigue, and technical gadgets so there is something for everyone.",1115769600,61,815,4.429530201342282
2258447,5,B0008ENIR0,"In my opinion, this is the best of all 5 seasons. All the characters have been fully developed. In Season 1 and part of Season 2, it seemed a bit like they weren't in these characters as well as later. Plus, it starts off with an incredibly emotional start. Major insight into the character of Michael, finally some of the intense emotion we all knew he had under the layers he hides under. What more can I say?",1115337600,21,411,4.282051282051282
2258448,5,B0008ENIR0,"I faitfully watch Nikita when I was in high school and when I went to college, I schedule my studies around Nikita. I made sure regardless what I was doing, I made it home to watch it. Peta and her supporting cast are awesome and I don't know why the series got cancel but I do know that I can't wait for this season to come and the rest of the seasons. I caught a case of the a$$ last year when WB change the release date on season 2, hope it doesn't happen with this one. But for those that like Alais, you'll love Nikita. I have a friend hook on it because she loves Alais and didn't think she would like it but changed her mind after the 1st season. So give it a try",1115078400,12,670,3.897810218978102
2258449,5,B0008ENIR0,"I've watched La Femme Nikita since the day the show started.  From the very first episode, I was hooked.  Peta Wilson plays the role so well, I can't wait until she breaks out on the big screen.  The only sad thing is that it had to end before it really had a chance.  So, from a true fan of the show, I say everyone who likes action series should check this show out.  Trust me, you won't be disappointed.",1114560000,35,406,4.0886075949367084

I watched the show when it was network/cable TV and was bummed when it ended, so turned to getting some of the DVD's.

2258499,5,B0008ENIR0,"Based on the movies Nikita (by Luc Besson of the Fifth Element, Transporter and Leon the Professional fame) and Point of No Return (the Americanized version) this Canadian TV show was developed and guided by Joel Surnow and Robert Cochoran who gave us Nowhereman and 24) produced on a next to nothing budget yet they still managed to have ground breaking effects with their above the table video screen.  They couldn't afford chase sequences so they relied upon character development and clever dialog.  Peta Wilson (remember her from League of the Extraordinary Gentelmen?), Alberta Watson (who'd later show up in the updated Nikita with Maggie Q), Eugene Glazer (who plays such a brilliant bad good bad guys, I forget now, which was he?  Good or bad?), Don Francks as the aging hippy supply guy who I remembered from that short lived show of Norman Felton's ""Jericho"").  Nikita was the killer with a heart who didn't always kill if she thought it was morally wrong.  This show introduced chilling elements to TV including the concept of ABAYANCE and CANCELLING.  One of the most chilling episodes came from Star Trek NG Alumi Maurice Hurley who had a rat cage put over Nikita's face as she sat in a floating cell next to Michael was torchured for information.  Man, that came from the same guy who gave us bikini babes in Baywatch Hawaii!  Morey!  But that doesn't forgive you for replacing Dr. Crusher!  Non-the-less for Television that episode was totally shocking!  La Femme Nikita did that.  It pushed the bounds of television back in the end of the 20th century.  The show made us think.  The show made us winch!  It still stands up today because of writing like Hurley's, supervision like Surnow's and Cochran's and the production of Jay Firestone and Jamie Paul Rock.  What these people, including the FINE cast, did with their budget was equal to what Gene Roddenberry did with year on Star Trek and what Sam Rolfe Did with year one Man from UNCLE and what Michael Garrison did with year one Wild, Wild West.  It is a classy classic.",1391212800,2,2043,4.7585227272727275
2258500,3,B0008ENIR0,The dvd's are ok thankfully. When received I was worried because the case had a piece broke and also was something rattling around inside so thought might have scratched the dvd's. I think they should protect product better for shipping.,1389571200,,237,4.95

Writing production and directing on this Canadian produced series that ran from 1997-2001 is outstanding, and holds up beautifully. Award winning costume design from Laurie Drew is still beautiful and on trend.
Watch out for Alberta Watson's new short 'do.' The actress was recovering from chemo treatments that she endured through out part of season 2 (and still worked! Brilliantly too) and her hair was now long enough to go without a wig.

2258521,1,B0008ENIR0,"Fans of the current ""Nikita"" TV series should be warned that this earlier version of the show is much darker and more violent. From the end of Season 2 on, it takes a very different direction as Nikita gradually becomes a willing member of Section 1 (Division). Also, this show makes frequent use of graphic sadomasochistic themes, and there seems to be at least one torture scene in every episode. In fact, Section 1 often behaves more like the Gestapo than a rogue branch of the CIA. The suggestion here is that this is justified, and there is a strong neoconservative political undercurrent to the show. Many of the episodes end in tragedy, and I found this series to be a major turnoff. Two much better programs in this genre are ""Alias"" and ""MI-5."" I would recommend both of them over this show.",1342051200,,800,4.601398601398602

Season one is the very best in my opinion, but the rest keeps that same flow .(2and3) four and five will surprise you a little but they redeem themselves. Still waiting for a finale all Nikita fans deserve. Just a note, don't compare to the new nikita on the wb. puhlease, won't even watch it.",1313366400,,615,4.451327433628318

2258532,5,B0008ENIR0,"Viewing the show, and season three in particular, I often find myself wondering if the creators, producers and others ever grasped the amazing potential of the show; (See my review of Season one).  Season three should be called ""Le Femme Nikita: How Many Ways Can We Drive A Wedge Between Nikita and Michael (After We Spent Two Season Getting  Them Together)?""  If it were not for the awesome performances by the cast the show would have slipped into oblivion for me.  The writing, editing, directing, and composition of the episodes were not even close to that of season one.  Conversely, production remained outstanding and the ""B story lines"" continued to expand, although Carlo Rota's unexplainable character--while exceptionally well performed--was too uncharacteristic of the Nikita environment.  The commentaries state the character was intended to instill some humor; well, in my opinion, it failed to do so.  Moreover, it is clear from the commentaries that the powers that be had become overly confident it the liberties they could take in what they did with the story line.  I, for one, grew disgusted with the ""psychological"" fantasies portrayed in the episodes because it corroded the interpersonal relationships into silly, impossibly unreal characterizations.

So, why the five star rating?  Because of the brilliant performances--especially by Peta Wilson, Don Francks, and Mathew Ferguson--and because at its' core, Le Femme Nikita is great entertainment.",1204761600,,1472,5.416666666666667

2258539,5,B0008ENIR0,"As we left section, Adrian tried to take over Section One but failed.  Season three is the season that the show really took shape and the supporting characters came into their own.

There are 22 episodes on six discs.

Under the Influence - A subject is brainwashed to believe that Nikita is his fianc.  Nikita has also been drugged to feel for the subject.

All Good Things - Operations is off on assignment and Michael is now in charge.  Michael promotes Nikita to tactical.  George puts a chess game between Michael and Madeline in action.

Third Party Ripoff - Madeline has decided to penalize Michael's betrayal by ordering an end to his relationship with Nikita.  Walter and Birkoff are played by a beautiful operative.

Any Means Necessary - Birkoff is sent into the field to break into a sneaker black hat crew.  The question is has he been turned?

Three Eyed Turtle - Tensions between Operations and Madeline intensify.  As do those between Birkoff and Hillenger, even after Birkoff covers for Hillenger.  George looks to capitalize on the tensions.

Disc Six -

Playing With Fire - Operations and Madeline are not sure if Michael and Nikita have really broken up and set a trap.

On Borrowed Time - Operations and Madeline continue their quest to stop Michael and Nikita.  They send them on a mission to remove Nikita and treat her.  It appears to have worked.  For helping them, they send Walter to ""retirement"".

This is a great show with Peta Wilson and Roy Dupuis bring up the heat and head a great cast.  But this year Alberta Watson as Madeline found her niche. Let's talk cold and scary.

2258545,3,B0008ENIR0,"As a hit TV series is dragged on year after year, authors begin to run out of fresh ideas but hey, as long as someone's watching, the show must go on. La Femme Nikita is no exception to that.

There are two essential rules for a spy story with a hint of science fiction: a strong plot and consistency with the rest of the story. This third season seems to break them both. It just doesn't make a whole of a lot of sense anymore, as presumably dead villains are exhumed and dramatic turns of events come as no surprise: overall, pretty disappointing for espionage aficionados.

On the other hand, this season digs deeper into human interaction between the main characters: the dilemma between loyalty to a friend and self-preservation, between living life to the fullest or just surviving. Michael and Nikita finally face their feelings and it's not too long before they start bearing the consequences. For LFN fans this is definitely worthwhile.

Many questions that have been taunting us for the whole second season get an answer, as Michael's enigma is unveiled and Oversight emerges from the shadow. But many more questions are raised, like who's Nikita, and why's she really there? Will Michael's ambition be fulfilled? For an answer to that I'm afraid we're going to have to wait for yet another season.",1124236800,,1308,4.778761061946903
2258546,5,B0008ENIR0,"Extraordinary television continues in this third installment of the La Femme Nikita series.  The creative staff again succeeds in taking us ""five minutes into the future"" by painstakingly maintaining the successful LFN platform in every detail.  The characters, guest actors, scenery, location shots, and Section protocol are coherently maintained throughout.  Have you ever noticed that one seldom sees a piece of paper in the series?

As the season opens, the complexity of the small ensemble of the six central characters begins to unfold.  We learn that Michael, smoothly portrayed by Roy Dupuis, has a family life on the ""outside.""  Nikita begins to question the circumstances behind her recruitment and considers the possibility that it was no accident.  Meanwhile, Birkoff and Walter struggle to survive within the brutal disorientation of the Section hierarchy.  Throughout the season, Operations and Madeline successfully deceive everyone-including the viewers-with an exceptionally devious plot to control a greater piece of geopolitical policy.

Entertaining?  You bet.  Just when things appear to be clear to the viewer, it soon becomes apparent that not everything is what it seems.  That is the magic of LFN.  The viewer becomes almost a participant in the story because of its design to bring the audience into a well-spun web of skillful storytelling.  The viewer's intelligence is never insulted in this series and should stand as an example that there is a market for higher standards in television content.

The DVD set continues to be packaged in the identical format as the two previous seasons ensuring a sharply cohesive no-nonsense approach to LFN marketing.  The single flaw in this reviewer's opinion is the cover art of Pita Wilson.  This particular choice of our protagonist scantily clad in a fringed black bodice belies the true nature of the Nikita character.  Perhaps Warner Brothers will give credit to the entire ensemble of six by utilizing a group promo shot with the release of the season four DVD set.",1123891200,5,2039,5.279503105590062

It was also good to see the development of Nikita and Michael relationship.  I never missed any episode, and to be able to see this anytime I want to is really great.

2258555,5,B0008ENIR0,"Nominated for 18 Gemini Awards (which honor the English language achievements of Canadian television), La Femme Nikita established itself as a stalwart on the USA Network in the late-1990s. Based on the 1990 motion picture of the same name, La Femme Nikita changed its cast, but not its edgy characters and exciting underworld setting. A forerunner to the successful hit series Alias, the show features all the intrigue of its successor coupled with the fast-paced action of 24. An hour-long action/adventure drama series, La Femme Nikita premiered on the first day of 1997 and quickly built a loyal fan base that followed the series for five stellar seasons before its premature cancellation in Spring 2001...

La Femme Nikita follows the life of Nikita (Peta Wilson), a woman wrongfully convicted of a brutal murder. Sentenced to life in prison, a top-secret government agency known only as Section One sets its sights on the woman it believes to be a ruthless killer. Faking Nikita's suicide, they usher her out of prison to train and program her into a willing and obedient assassin. But the conspirators at Section One didn't bank on Nikita's innocence. Now, they're stuck with a bloodthirsty felon who's not as bloodthirsty as they thought. Nevertheless, Nikita (now code-named 'Josephine') must carry out the orders of her superiors or else face her own death at the hands of an organization intent on keeping its secrets from the outside world. La Femme Nikita boasts an excellent cast to compliment Nikita's numerous adventures, among them are Michael Samuelle (Roy Dupuis), Davenport (Lawrence Bayne), Seymour Birkoff (Matthew Ferguson), Walter (Don Francks), and Paul ""Operations"" Wolfe (Eugene Robert Glazer). Together, they create an intriguing atmosphere of mysterious identities, ruthless assassins, and government conspiracies that is certain to entertain even the most discriminating of viewers...

The La Femme Nikita (Season 3) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Looking For Michael"" in which Operations deems Nikita to be a threat to the continued life of Section One. So a plot is hatched to assassinate Nikita on one of the Section One missions, but Nikita survives, and when she returns to Section One headquarters, she learns the truth about Michael... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Outside the Box"" in which Section One recruits a new operative with a photographic memory, and ""Third Party Ripoff"" in which Michael's relationship with Nikita threatens to cause his loss of hard-earned power within the Section One hierarchy...

2258556,5,B0008ENIR0,"I used to be a fan of ALIAS. Until I saw the first season of La Femme Nikita. Nikita makes ALIAS seem like the generic grocery store brand of this genre, while Nikita is the name brand original in all its glory. Peta Wilson plays the lead to perfection in this the third season of LFN. In some ways the third season is my favorite season because it really breaks a lot of ground with the characters. In this season everyone gets the chance to behave in a way that they typically just do not. The entire cast really gets a chance to stretch and grow in their roles, giving them even more depth. I love this show, and though the price is a little high for a TV series on DVD, it is well worth it.",1121644800,4,694,4.072992700729927

It's too bad Season 2 had so many negative reviews due to the unfortunate first release of this DVD box set that was taken away from all of us at the last minute in July 2004 because of WB.

There is a lot of clearly visible artifacting in any of the open spaces of light color in the background of shots (which are used a lot with white and silver expanses) all through this season. I've even been seeing distressing halos and shadows on faces writhing around when people move. The second season looked exquisite. This one definitely does not. For a show of this calibre (the very highest) and with such a focus on visual elements, that is a major flaw. I'm very disappointed.",1121299200,7,629,4.779816513761468

Opposed to the first two seasons where some support is nessecary (loyalty), everyone seems to find the ""it"" that makes this season phenomenal.

I agree with several previous reviews, this show is deffinetly the vanguard of female lead anti-terrorist themes. Other shows (Alias) the viewer sees a Hollywood version of LFN.

Never stale! And what is more: a series that offers food for thought.... and layers of meaning/choice of ""readings"". That is a classic/cult by definition! And the third season is the best one -- a certain ""maturing"" was achieved. Can't wait to have DVDs for seasons 4 and 5 (this last one a bit of a disapointment, I must say as far as writing goes) and I certainly bet large screen would be a huge success in the right hands, with the right actors. But, how to make still another Nikita.... after 2 or 3 or I don't know how many? Perhaps possible as our perception of moral dilema evolves? A challenge.

Yes, poetic. Every human interaction and piece of dialogue in each show of the La Femme Nikita has so much layers of meaning. The first layer is what you see, which is just an illusion. The second level is the the layer of lies as each character jockeys for position and power and survival. The 3rd level is the ""truth,"" or what we think is the truth. As you see more and more shows, especially the 4th and short 5th season, you realize that there is a 4th level of truth, and nothing was ever what it seemed to be after all.

2258563,5,B0008ENIR0,"I've loved LFN since it's debut for one reason only, they never took the easy way out and dumbed it down for Jethro (ref. Beverly Hillbillys).  Happy endings are few and far between, bad stuff happens and people pay the price.  As far out as the show goes, I think at it's core it's one of the most real shows ever produced.

Season 3 is without a doubt my favorite.  Just when you thought they couldn't mess with your head anymore, BAM!  Straight to the moon!  LFN Fan-attics know what I'm referring to, so kick back and enjoy.  And please, tell your friends...",1120003200,6,562,4.398058252427185

I still love the acting, music, and storyline.  No other show has mezmerized me like this one.  And yes, I am still hoping for a big screen production of Nikita.",1119916800,2,318,4.431034482758621
