8639833,5,B004FN279A,"I recieved my video one day earlier than originally promised for Monday. Would you believe, it was delivered day before on Sunday. The video played as well as expected on my Samsung Blue Ray player. Some scenes, the current interviews were very clear and 'some' of the old film footage was blurry. For most part I am very satisfied with the DVD video. In the video, I got to see my Battalion Commander Lt. Col. Hal Moore, my company commander Captain John D. Heeren and a Buck Sargent that I trained with many years ago at Fort Benning (<-The Invantry Capital) in Georgia. Thank You, for your Service Lt. Col. Hal Moore (retired as General), Captain John D. herren (retired as Colonel) and all who served back then, prior to and since.",1448236800,,735,4.575757575757576
