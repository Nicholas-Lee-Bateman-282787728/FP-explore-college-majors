6839433,5,B00Q05GFHQ,"I saw this by invitation at a pre-release screening by Salt and Light TV. It came with Introduction by Father James Martin, S.J. author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jesus-A-Pilgrimage/dp/006202423X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jesus: A Pilgrimage</a>&nbsp;and Rev. Thomas Rosica, C.S.B., the Chief Executive Officer of Canada's Catholic Salt + Light Television Network. It was followed by a very rich and informative Q & A session with Father Rosica, who knows the Holy Father well.

Since his election, Pope Francis has taken the world, its people, and the media by storm. Surprised by his authentic-ness, while displaying his different-ness, the Pope has created a unique curiosity about himself, a tremendous following by those who satisfy this curiosity, and a love by the people who follow him and see him as a unique Christina leader who they confidently can choose as a stable mentor in this unstable world. Still, it's more than all that.

This film does an excellent job in capturing the gist of what happens to people who somehow fall under the influence of this man, directly or indirectly. It examines how he sees the Church and plans to lead the Church. Everyone is realizing: it's not business as usual! Seemingly defying complete description at this point, it's simply called ""The Francis Effect!""",1424131200,4,1359,5.5603864734299515

6839439,5,B00Q05GFHQ,"A great DVD. Anyone who wants to know about the current Pope's background and future should watch it. It gives a good insight into what's going on in the Vatican with Pope Francis. He  will become a saint someday. In some ways I feel he is and incarnate of st. Francis, his name sake. You do not have to be Catholic to enjoy who this new pope is and what he's about.",1439942400,,366,4.083333333333333

8689960,5,B00Q05GFHQ,"This documentary gave me clearer insight into the person and vision of pope Francis uncontaminated by political posturing both secular and religious. The most poignant question of the piece for me came at the end with the question, ""HOW should Christian's act in the 21st century?"" Pope Francis seems to be answering the question with his actions which center on the intimate, merciful, and loving encounter with Christ that becomes the basis from which all other Christian actions unapologetically arise.
