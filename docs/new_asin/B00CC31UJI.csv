5713544,2,B00CC31UJI,"Hi Friends,  everyone loves a good zombie movie!  This one
isn't about zombies, more like rabies infected people.
It is a movie, but it wasn't good.  Typical plot with
some young people that go on vacation and when they get
to their destination, a terrorist attack with some biological
or nerve agents turn people into rabid killers.  Mostly,
they hide in the house and say things like (I kid you not)
""We need to get out of this house."" says one guy. ""So what
are you saying?"" says the other young guy.  The big mystery
in this movie for me was how it got funding.  With the misleading
movie box cover, it might break even. The young actors in
this movie are fairly well known, and this wasn't their
first film job.  If they ever break into the big time, maybe
they can laugh about it, or cry.",1375401600,2,794,4.324324324324325
5713545,3,B00CC31UJI,"Anchor Bay's most recent zombie flick, THE DEMENTED, is sure to continue a bit of discussion that has plagued the zombie community over the past several years:  can a creature be classified as a `zombie' if it runs?  To me, I don't suppose I really care whether or not they move quickly, as long as they haven't been dead for a while (I think a body that has been rotting for 10 years would have a hard time getting around at any speed).  But regardless of which side of the fence you are on, this is one film you should check out anyway.  Be forewarned, however...it does not introduce anything new and barely has any gore.

THE DEMENTED caught me by surprise.  I wasn't expecting what I got, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.  I wanted to like it up front because the beautiful and talented Sarah Butler is in it, but I was surprised to find out she was not the main character.  And although I enjoyed it on the whole, the film does have some glaring flaws.  Even so, the movie is pretty good overall and a decent addition to the modern-day zombie canon.

The acting in this film is good, with the aforementioned Sarah Butler doing a fantastic job in her role.  But Kayla Ewell, the woman portraying the main character of Taylor, is who really steals the show.  Ewell tackles her role with enthusiasm, and is a true talent to watch for in the future.

THE DEMENTED is also shot well and the production value looks fairly high.  However there are two major issues that I have with this film.  First, the ending is beyond horrible.  I initially thought the filmmakers had messed up and sent the wrong thing to print...but from what I understand, this was the way they intended to end the film.  I will not disclose any spoilers, but I seriously hope the production team never does anything like this in future films.

Secondly, there is practically no gore in the film at all.  For me, you can't make a good zombie flick without gore.  It simply has to be there.  Period.  I don't know if budget constraints kept them from adding any, but I would have been happy to see chocolate syrup and corn syrup all over the place as opposed to nothing.

These two issues with THE DEMENTED should not be enough to dissuade you from seeing the film, though; on the contrary, I would love for more people to watch the ending, just to make sure I'm not being critical for the wrong reason.  And, aside from the two problems I noted, there's nothing else wrong with the film.  It has tension where needed and moves at a nice pace.  The `zombies' will eat you if they catch you, and there's really not much else you need.

I recommend giving the film a look next week when it is released.  And after you watch it, hop back here or on Facebook and let us know what you think.  After all, regardless of whether they are shambling or sprinting, zombies always make great conversation pieces.",1374710400,11,2878,4.428571428571429
5713546,2,B00CC31UJI,"This is a low budget wannabe zombie flick. Three bikini teases and their boyfriends spend some time away from their college studies to have some fun in rural Louisiana. While a slow motion camera films them playing on a kids water slide (the hill wasn't that steep and the slide wasn't that long) and tossing a Nerf football (can't you feel the adrenaline rush?), NuBuck (Michael Welch) gets a call from his father claiming that terrorist missiles are on the way.

Our couples are spared a direct hit, but a biological agent is spread about causing a rabies like infection in people and animals. The zombie craze has turned from slow foot dragging, return from the dead, zombies to fast moving unthinking pack animals that attack uninfected people. Our couples' goal is to escape the quarantined area without being bit by anything.

The film boasts a metal sound track, bad dialog, with stiff characters played by actors that haven't reached their potential. I did like the infected dog.

This is the first attempt by writer/director Christopher Roosevelt, whose resume includes being the producer of ""Ninja Cheerleaders."" It shows promise. It would have been nice if he had created clever dialog characters. The boyfriend cheating drama went nowhere and I am not sure why that was even tossed in. We could have had another two minutes of bikini girls on the slip and slide.

5713547,5,B00CC31UJI,"From the creative minds behind I Spit On Your Grave and A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Demented is a terrifying excursion into a plague-infected world...where one moment off guard is all that keeps us from becoming them.

With a hot cast including Sarah Butler (I Spit On Your Grave), Brittney Alger (21 Jump Street), Kayla Ewell (""The Vampire Diaries""), Richard Kohnke (""The Carrie Diaries"") and Michael Welch (The Twilight Saga Franchise), The Demented will have you on the edge of your seat until the very last frame!

The Demented follows six college friends as they meet up for a carefree weekend in a beautiful rural home. A terrorist missile attack in a nearby town infects much of the townspeople with a deadly virus that induces rabies-like symptoms...with devastating consequences. Ravenous and fast, the infected townspeople turn their sights on the vacation home where the friends are gathered...and are now barricaded. How long can they hide? Even with the infected ""sleeping"" in the streets, can they make their escape? If so, to what?",1368489600,4,1049,5.057803468208093

5713553,3,B00CC31UJI,"This is far from the greatest walking cadaver film ever made but this ""Miricle Mile""/""Night of the Living Dead"" hybrid, in spite of its flaws, does grab your attention span- especially near the end. After getting off to a bad start (who cares about some melodramitic love trangle crap) the Miricle Mile warhead hits followed by a walking dead dog and the usual walking (more like running) corpses. The characters aren't too bright, at least not at first (horror movies with smart people are RARE!), but as they make their escape you're suddenly no longer groaning at them but actually routing for them!
Much like the French WW2 film ""Train of Life"" ""The Demented"" has two endings- at least I'm assuming that's what the producers had in mind. You choose either the happy ending or the not-so-happy one. You decide...",1408752000,,815,4.828571428571428

Later scenes made me jump.  My heart was racing soon after.  Suspense scenes start out great, and keep going for a short time, but lose steam.  When the group of teens tries to save themselves, there are a couple of ""Why don't they just ..."" situations that will have you slapping your forehead.  Overall, a scary movie worth watching... especially for a low budget one.",1376784000,,525,4.580645161290323

5713570,3,B00CC31UJI,"Does the world really need another zombie movie? Walk into any store that sells DVDs and most people would scream ""No!"" I've said it before and I'll say it again. There must be three zombie movies coming out every week. The hard thing for viewers to do is try to pick which one they should devote an hour and a half of their time to. Thankfully, you have a guy like me who wastes way too many moments watching movies like Anchor Bay Entertainment's ""The Demented"" to keep you from doing the same.

Six college friends meet for a fun weekend at a Louisiana bayou estate for beers, water sliding (yes, water sliding), and good times. Just as the fun begins, the group is warned that the U.S. is being attacked by terrorists using biological weapons. Their hopes of being far from the danger zone are dashed when one of the enemy bombers crashes outside the nearest city. The chemical the plane was carrying infects the entire community by turning them into ravenous flesh-eating killers.

If this setup sounds familiar it should. It's been used in 95% of every zombie film you've seen. The problem with ""The Demented"" is it's a zombie movie with no ""oomph!"" Sure, the ones here are wild-eyed, bloody fast-running zombies and all. None of that matters, though, without some solid headshots or real gore.

""The Demented"" is edited like the ""Friday the 13th"" movies in the late 1980s and early 1990s. All the graphic violence happens off-screen. While that ""less-is-more"" technique works with some horror thrillers, it really doesn't with films featuring the walking dead or undead.

I will give credit to Director/Writer Christopher Roosevelt for one thing. The guy tries to get you to care about his characters. Even if they all come across as a bunch of whiny rich kids, he takes the time and attempts to give them some sort of personalities and backgrounds. This always helps to get the audience connected so we care when these people die horribly later on.

There's also an interesting characteristic the zombies have that sets them apart from their counterparts in other movies of this nature. They freeze when they can't sense any activity around them, resembling the disturbing nurses in the ""Silent Hill"" movies. The concept is intriguing, even if it does borrow a bit from the zombies that sleep while standing up in ""Steve Niles' Remains.""

Director/Writer Roosevelt pulled out all the stops when picking an affordable cast that would appeal to horror fans and teens. ""The Demented"" stars Michael Welch (""The Twilight Saga""), Sarah Butler (""I Spit on Your Grave""), Kayla Ewell (""The Vampire Diaries""), and Richard Kohnke (""The Carrie Diaries""). They'll all no doubt grab individuals familiar with their separate works in those movies and TV shows.

""The Demented"" is rated R because of its strong language. I've seen more gore and violence and heard heavier sexual innuendos in a PG-13 film. No flesh is bared besides the girls running around in their bikinis.

There are no special features to be found for ""The Demented."" I usually comment that it would be nice to see how the movie was made. However, if you've seen any ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette for any zombie movie, you already know in this case.

If you're hanging out with someone who doesn't like overly graphic movies but is looking for some scares, ""The Demented"" might come in handy. True gorehounds looking for decapitations and gunshots to the head need to move on to something else. There's nothing to see here.

""The Demented"" is available now on Blu-ray, DVD, and as a Digital Download.",1376697600,2,3563,4.85502471169687
5713571,2,B00CC31UJI,"""The Demented"" follows six college friends meeting for a carefree weekend in a beautiful home in the Louisiana bayou. A terrorist missile attack on the Gulf Coast infects many of the townspeople with a deadly virus that induces rabies-like symptoms with devastating consequences. The area is quarantined as the madness spreads. Ravenous and fast-moving, the infected, rage-crazed townspeople turn their sights on the vacation home where the friends are now barricaded.

The main characters are hardly engaging, despite a slow opening geared to offer at least some background, largely because the actors are wooden.

With so many zombie films being turned out, a director should put a unique stamp on his, but Christopher Roosevelt, who also wrote the screenplay, resorts to one cliche after another, though he does know how to handle the action and gore sequences.

There are no bonus extras on this feature, available in both Blu-ray and DVD formats.",1376611200,,951,5.243421052631579
5713572,1,B00CC31UJI,"Do not buy this movie.  I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE! This movie was made to make a quick buck. Don't be fooled by the awesome case art.  The so-called ""infected"" on this movie look nothing like the zombie on the case art sleeve, they're just a bunch of extras with torn clothes and cheesy looking fake blood smeared all over their faces.  This is an extremely low budget film made by someone who obviously didn't know what they were doing.  To top that off; the actors and actresses did a horrible job at acting.  Apparently they were trying to make a ripoff of ""28 Days Later"".  They failed miserably.  It's sad that there are more s***ty zombie B-movies than there are descent zombie movies out there.

The story line to this movie is absolutely horrible.  As soon as the movie started I knew it wouldn't turn out to be a good movie.  It also has the aged class of characters that most American horror movies have.  The snotty prep teenagers hanging around at some house acting like idiots when suddenly something goes horribly wrong.  Do I have you on the edge of your set yet? No? Good! Do yourself a huge favor and support Adam Green and his team of film makers and go buy ""Hatchet"" and it's sequels.

5713574,2,B00CC31UJI,"Caught this one on PPV; want my money back!!  As someone in an earlier review pointed out, this really isn't a zombie flick so much as it is a tale about a bioterrorist attack somewhere in the middle of Louisiana.  The people do not turn into zombies; they are just really manical and savage.  Six 30-year olds (playing teens) decide to get together at somebody's mansion for boozing, losing, and lord, I don't know.  One of the things I thought was so hilarious was they played on a water slide!!  I know we're trying to save money, guys, but couldn't you have found a swimming pool somewhere?  Anyway, a terrorist attack happens and the little animals and people suddenly become savages.

I cannot agree with some of the others about this film.  I found the production values near nil, and the acting--for the most part--just did not cut it.  In these types of films, there is ALWAYS the brainy one, the nymphette, the horn-dog, and Sister Mary Virgin.  Trouble is, not ONE of these characters did I care about.  There is ABSOLUTELY next to no violence and certainly no GORE.  Why this was rated R is again a question for you guys to figure out.",1376352000,,1147,4.541463414634146

8580139,3,B00CC31UJI,"The Demented is another entry into the zombie film genre, this one drawing its inspiration from films like 28 Days Later where the zombies are actually people who are infected with a rabies like disease making them crazed and attacking anyone they see with abandon AND full speed but also meaning they can be killed as normal humans are as opposed to just shooting them in the head.  The Demented has a couple of things going for it that other low-budget films of similar ilk do not. Often times in zombie films we hear about the infected being the result of some viral or biological outbreak but rarely do we see it actually happen.  This is not the case with The Demented.

Six college friends have gathered at the friend Howards home in Louisiana (while their parents are away) for a weekend of sun, fun, and beer.  Howard receives a call from his father about a possible terrorist attack along the Gulf Coast but the phone goes dead before he can gather any details.  Soon after, a missile strikes in the distance, causing a plume of green smoke to mushroom up on the horizon.  As the group of friends debate their next move the first indication of trouble comes in the form of a dog with a chewed off ear and flies buzzing about its head that attacks them, causing them to take refuge in the house.  Soon after, several salivating maniacs come crashing through the windows of the house, scattering the group.  As the small group of friends takes refuge in an upstairs bedroom, they realize that they have to somehow get to their car and get away to find safety.

I mentioned a couple of things that the film has going for itthe second is that the infected stand absolutely motionless when they don't have a target on which to focus.  In this regard they are similar to the Nurses in the Silent Hill videogame and film franchise.  This adds an element of creepiness to the infected as there are several scenes where the group attempts to sneak by them while they are motionless.  Director/Writer Christopher Roosevelt keeps the action moving for the most part, giving us just enough character development even though it might be stereotypical such as the white kid who is going to be a lawyer while the black kid is the football star.  Theres an unnecessary bit of drama involving one of the girls sleeping with anothers boyfriend that ultimately goes nowhere.

The male actors are frankly boring and wooden in their delivery but the female leads including Kayla Elwell (The Vampire Diaries) and Sarah Butler (I Spit on Your Grave) are vastly superior and fun to watch.  The makeup effects are strictly bargain basement but the infected run so fast that you rarely get a decent look at them anyway.",1438387200,,2702,4.635220125786163
8580140,4,B00CC31UJI,"The Demented story is a typical one with arrogant yet reflective youths looking to bond fighting unimaginable horrors. I didn't find any real holes in the plotline or characters stories which happens a lot in films. The terrorist attack is a familiar one but it is fresher than the standard schlock for how zombies are made. It plays closer to the viral outbreak in other more powerful zombie tales like 28 Days Later and The Devils Playground. However this is a new geographical location of the outbreak-bayou country and small town America. The actual outbreak happens over the New Orleans area but the college kids are at a family home far outside the city in a smaller community. It allows for the action and story arch to maintain an affective level of entertainment without seeming redundant or boring. I found the characters likable and believable. I actually connected with them and the story managed to keep my attention through the whole film.

The special effects and action sequences in The Demented are intense and very commanding as the cast fight (and as some die) to get to the safe location of extraction. The thrills and even chilling moments are evenly spaced and timed well enough to create tension enough for excitement. The zombies are not the tradition creature we expect but more bleeding rage virulent humans with homicidal tendencies similar to The Crazies-fast movers that created even more thrilling action packed moments on screen. I enjoyed the added little element of the zombies suspended state when the smell or sound of the living wasn't stimulating them. The Demented isn't really anything knew for the zombie genre but the film gives a solid story and plenty of intense action. The acting is as good as some big budget flicks and for the most part The Demented delivers a good level of entertainment. I enjoyed this one as much as the other zombie films I mentioned in this review.",1432512000,,1917,4.862385321100917
