5735152,5,B00CQW2XQE,"I received Castle Season 1-5 on a special.  Prompt delivery.  Loved that you had a choice of viewing all the episodes in secession or just a selected item.  Didn't care for all of the ads that were on some of the episodes.

Loved watching all of the Castle episodes.  He is such a kick.  Bought all of these episodes after watching just a couple of episodes on TV.  In my opinion, Castle is one of the best detective shows on TV right now.",1385942400,,439,4.216867469879518
5735153,5,B00CQW2XQE,"I absolutely love the whole team on Castle!! I ordered the season 1-4 box set and received it quicker then my 3 month mail order prescription. Completely satisfied with the timeliness of when I received it and packaging. One issue though, season 3 disc 3 will not play on my play station. I have no idea why, kinda upsetting, but all the other discs work fine. I will be ordering more stuff and more than likely Castle dvd's in the future. :) :)",1385251200,2,445,4.373493975903615
5735154,4,B00CQW2XQE,"I'm a Castle fan,would have gave 5 stars except the 3rd season discs were kinda messed up, one or two movies in each of the 5 discs had glitches,digitally,freezing up,not wanting to play. I even bought another dvd player to check it out. Same results.",1384819200,2,251,4.6
5735155,5,B00CQW2XQE,"My wife and I really enjoy the television series Castle, and so we ordered the Castle Season 1-4 Box Set.  The set was shipped promptly and was received in excellent condition.  I was a little surprised to find that it was not a ""box"" set, but individual DVD's.  By no means was this a problem, but maybe it should be advertised as just individual seasons 1 - 4.",1384560000,,362,4.294117647058823
5735156,5,B00CQW2XQE,Castle is my favorite show was anxious to have my own copies.  I will certainly want more shows when available.,1384041600,,111,4.55
5735157,5,B00CQW2XQE,"Have not watched ALL DVD's yet, but am starting on them.  Have watched many on tv.  The writers of this tv show certainly
have to be acknowledged as the lines are great.  Nathan Fillion totally delivers lines and ALL other nuances so perfectly.
This show has just the right amount of skullduggery, interspersed with humor, caring, great team work, seriousness, sadness.....
Each actor does excellent.  Great detective show.",1382054400,,423,5.176470588235294
5735158,5,B00CQW2XQE,"You can see Castle on tv through reruns, but you never know the sequence of what you are seeing.  When you watch the episodes in order, it is so much more fun.",1382054400,,159,3.96875
5735159,1,B00CQW2XQE,Not happy so far seasons 1&2 are flawed I have no paper work to follow through . Also unhappy with Hija del Mariachi one disc is flawed don't think I'll order anything else,1381881600,,172,4.242424242424242
5735160,5,B00CQW2XQE,Castle series is great.  Fillion's acting is perforect for the role.  Katic seems to get prettier every season.  Glad I bought the series.,1381104000,,138,4.913043478260869
5735161,5,B00CQW2XQE,I like having the entire series.  I missed quite a few episodes the first couple of years and have really enjoyed watching them sequentially.,1381017600,,141,4.875
5735162,1,B00CQW2XQE,"When we played the DVD sets there are multiple flaws on the discs.  Example, First season - first disc, does not play.  Nothing comes up.  Others you can see the episodes but have no sound.  Some have the previews of other films which play perfectly, and then the screen goes blank.  All 4 seasons have something wrong within the discs.

We have purchased many DVD's from Amazon with no problems, and have been satisfied with all of them.  However, the Castle Box Set has been a disappointment.  I'm not even sure how to return these.",1380240000,10,534,4.5473684210526315

5735166,5,B00CQW2XQE,"I love Castle. And to be able to watch any one of the episodes at any time is terrific! I cannot wait until the 5th season ships, I already have that on reserve! Each DVD was perfect in condition and I truly appreciate the quick delivery I received.",1378166400,,249,4.208333333333333
5735167,5,B00CQW2XQE,"This series is truly unique - I get bored with most cops shows but this one does not take itself too seriously, although some episodes are quite serious.  It's intelligent, funny, naughty, not always PC and just a little bit sexy.  All the characters have really well developed back-stories which gives the series depth.  These characters are people I'd love to meet and be able to call friends (unlike that other crappy show called that).  I love this show and the books ""written"" by Castle!!!  It's very meta at times keeping up with all the layers (lol).  Keep up the great work.",1377129600,,582,4.6568627450980395

I recommend it highly!",1377129600,,124,5.25
5735169,5,B00CQW2XQE,I started to watch this show when it came out and then lost track. Just saw re runs and said why not try to get a few seasons. Saw this seller selling the first 4 season and has to try it. Used Handbrake to put them on my mac and now and watch on any device I like. Lunch hour at work just got a lot better.,1377043200,,307,3.5970149253731343
5735170,5,B00CQW2XQE,"I did not even know about Castle until about a month ago.  I now own the first 4 seasons, and the fifth season is on order.  I love the dialogue, and the actors are FANTASTIC!",1376352000,,175,3.9714285714285715
5735171,5,B00CQW2XQE,I just love this series.  Hope it goes on forever!  It is one of the best cop shows I've seeen.  Right up there with NCIS.,1376006400,,122,3.8
5735172,5,B00CQW2XQE,"I am a late comer to this series but since I started watching the show I have thoroughly enjoyed it and especially the great chemistry by the two leads. Their interactions really make you believe that they truly have a thing for each other. These two are great actors and the rest of the cast is also fine. I am a fan of old time Hollywood movies and such wonderful stars as Hepburn, Bogart, Bacall, etc. The interactions Beckett and Castle have remind me of them and some of their movies. Great show and I can't wait for the new season to start !",1375660800,,547,4.269230769230769
5735173,3,B00CQW2XQE,"I guess you get what you pay for. but in this case, I wondered if it were professional/legal. there was an extremely annoying ""crunchy/popping"" sound just before the cut for the commercial break in every episode, every season. at the final season, toward the end it did seem to not be there. but, oh my goodness, the vast majority of breaks started to really get annoying. I love this series and am sad to think twice before watching it on these dvds again.",1374969600,,457,4.518072289156627
5735174,5,B00CQW2XQE,"Well, I usually see the serie, and my mother language is not English, so I want it to review it. I like it a lot.",1374624000,,113,3.56
5735175,5,B00CQW2XQE,I haven't followed Castle on ABC during its five seasons. I decided to check out the reruns on TNT and i'm so glad I did. I've enjoyed them so much I had to buy the DVD's. I will be getting season 5 as soon as it's released and I can't wait for season 6 on ABC! Now it's my favorite show!,1373414400,,288,3.737704918032787

8585211,5,B00CQW2XQE,"Castle is my favorite network TV series, and this collection of the first four seasons was a fun blast from the past. As Kate and Rick prepared for their wedding in the season just ended, I liked going back to their rocky beginning and watching them fight their feelings for each other.
