8177349,5,B000NDI5BU,"To hear Nick Pope tell his stories of what he saw, what was concealed, and what is out there today is an eye opener.  I've read his books, but hearing these things from the horse's mouth brings such reality to his experiences, it sent shivers down my spine.  Chilling and informative, and very interesting.",1374883200,,306,4.648148148148148

8177351,5,B000NDI5BU,Anyone who is an X-Files fan should watch this.  This real version is just as intriguing with the benefit of reality behind it.  This is not just a documentary by a UFO enthusiast but a renowned author and former employee of the British Ministry of Defense with a very convincing story to tell.,1206576000,,294,4.528301886792453
8177352,4,B000NDI5BU,"They're Out There...
Wow.  An incredible series of interviews with former British Ministry of Defense UFO Investigator, Nick Pope.  It's amazing that he ever went on record with this type of information.  A rare, fascinating film for alien affectionados or anyone the least bit interested in this topic.  You will learn a lot!",1205020800,,326,5.09433962264151
8177353,3,B000NDI5BU,"He's called the real life Fox Mulder by some. If you believe in and/or have an interest in UFOs, this interview with Nick Pope, who investigated UFOs for the British Ministry of Defense will definitely be of interest. The MOD's project began in the 1950s during the anxiety over the war, and continued to track aircraft and fireballs by radar. Pope began his post with an open mind; hear how his opinions evolved with experience.",1198627200,,429,4.733333333333333
8177354,4,B000NDI5BU,"I did not give this five stars because there wasn't much new information.  The only new thing I remember is that I didn't know air traffic radar is computer-programmed to hide aircraft traveling at high rates of speed.  I found that interesting, but not worth five stars.

If you haven't attended any UFO conferences, or read too many UFO books, but do have an interest in this subject, you will definitely find this interesting.  He focuses on what I would call ""high-value"" sightings - sightings by trained observers - meterologists, airline captains, police officers, etc, who have made official reports, and then he talks about the follow-up research, or lack thereof.  It's a good introduction for someone who has a real interest in getting some reputable information.

I thought much, but not all, of the music was appropriate, and added to the strength of the movie, but I found some of it to be too jarring and spikey.

The basic format, two people sitting in a room staring at each other, is intrinsically a difficult format to keep an audience involved, but Nick Pope has a compelling voice of authenticity.

One thing I noticed in the interview is when Pope was asked if he were a disinformation agent - he definitely had a reaction to that question. I also noticed that the film went from black-and-white to color at this point.  I wonder if there was a subliminal message in that.

One other point I have to make is that the beginning newspapers were headlines from the early 1950s, which, although relevant to the subject of UFOs, had nothing to do with the work that Nick Pope did.  I kept wondering, throughout the movie, when that would be tied in, and it never was.",1180396800,3,1683,4.690476190476191
8177355,5,B000NDI5BU,"Fascinating insight into the Ministry of Defence with this in-depth interview for the first time of Nick Pope - the British Fox Mulder. Nick candidly provides his unique perspective on the UFO phenomena from within the MOD and how his own attitudes changed once the incredible truths about the various sightings and information came to light. Pope is underated and underused by most television documentaries, but this DVD actually gets to grips with his own thoughts and beliefs and is very cleverly shot and edited with some nice and even funny music. Another great DVD from Reality! Well done guys.",1175731200,3,600,5.01
