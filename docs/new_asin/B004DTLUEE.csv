4334710,3,B004DTLUEE,"'1st Furry Valentine' aka 'Princess and the Pony' is a mixed bag of kid friendly entertainment with a young princess in need, cute animals and some silliness; however, it also contains scenes of child endangerment and some unsavory characters.

The story involves the princess essentially going into protective custody, hiding out with her goofy but fun aunt and little dog.  The princess is 10 and doesn't fit in at the local school and runs off and discovers a pony at a carnival which is run by the villain whose goal is to capture the princess.

It's a low budget film with mostly ok acting, the young star is good, and, in general, the filming and music are ok as well. There are plenty of weak spots where the comedy and characters struggle to amount to anything, but no matter, it's the animals that are the highlights.

What bothers me are the scenes where children are threatened with a gun, and the princess is constantly concerned about her life.  I skipped over the scary parts with my elementary aged children.

For what it's worth, the movie earned 4 out of 5 Doves for family friendliness. OK. My children liked it(edited) because of the animals, some adventure, silliness, some controlled danger where the hero wins out in the end, and did I mention the animals?  I found it boring and inane, but I'm a dad.  Preview it and make up your own mind before the kiddoes watch.",1337212800,,1387,4.63265306122449
4334711,3,B004DTLUEE,"Hmmm- how can one not like a family film titled 'Princess and the Pony' and with such an adorable cover; plus, 4 out 5 Doves for family approved friendliness?

This well intended flick teeters on the edge between fun, adventuresome, sit down with the whole family, enjoy another princess story with cute animals or warning, warning there's been a royal assassination, and there are bad guys with guns and threats and a constant underlying theme of child endangerment. Whew!

There's trouble in a mythical kingdom and the princess must go into hiding.  She goes to live with her goofy, country aunt and her cute, little dog.  The princess tries to pretend to be a normal 10 year old, goes to school, doesn't fit in, runs off and finds and befriends a pony at a carnival run by a malevolent rube.

The scenes involving the animals are the best part.  She trains the pony to jump and learns about friendship and about being oneself.  The music and the editing are fine for a low budget film.  Some of the acting and jokes are a bit forced, but no matter.

What bothered me was the villains threatening the kids.  I know 'The Wizard of Oz', 'Spy Kids' and other family movies have stressful, dangerous situations in them.  You must decide for yourself.  I just can't handle movies showing guns being pointed at children. Am I wrong? My solution: view ahead and skip through those scenes when watching with little ones or just forgo the show completely.

Overall, my elementary age girls liked this movie(edited)- some adventure, some comedy, lovable animals, some controlled danger, kids taking charge, happy ending.  Me?  Too boring and inane, but I'm a dad.",1337126400,4,1655,4.757894736842105
4334712,1,B004DTLUEE,"As a common b-movie night, my friend and I decided to watch Princess and the Pony because it's the first family movie from The Asylum (infamous for their awful Titanic 2 and monster VS movies) and let me just say... it's equally as bad. Aside from the main character, every other actor is AWFUL!!! There's no real plot other than the bad guys wanting to kill... yes, kill... the little princess. There's a scene where the villian is actually pointing a gun at 2 little girls... ugggh. The pony has no real effect on anything... the girl just encourages her to jump. Does it reflect the princess' self-esteem or makes her a better person???? NO! There's this character that actually looks like a meth addict and IS a rather bad thief in the film. Fake moustaches (with obvious glue around the guys upper lip), atrocious one liners (Oh, I like me some black licorice!!""), and a specific rainy night shot that looks like somebody's hosing the car in their closed porch (LOL)... if you're up for some laughs due to really bad production... watch this film. But if you're looking for something ala Princess Protection Diaries, then rewatch that movie instead.",1314144000,3,1154,4.746268656716418
4334713,4,B004DTLUEE,"You didn't think I was gonna skip this one, did you? You didn't assume that just because this is a massive thematic departure for The Asylum, their first, full-on venture into family filmmaking (overlooking Sunday School Musical - incidentally from this director - and Pirates of Treasure Island; the former is aimed at teens and the latter has too much cleavage for anyone under 10) that I would choose to ignore it? Oh no, my friends - in for a penny, in for a pound, that's practically the colloquial definition of ""committed,"" and I'm nothing but. These guys could release a knitting instructional video and I'd watch it. Twice. So here we go:

When a privileged but sheltered princess (Fiona Perry) is threatened by a breach of palace security, her mother the Queen (Kim Little, in her first Asylum flick since 2009's Countdown:Jerusalem) makes the decision to send her to America where she has an aunt (Bobbi Jo Lathan) living in the heartland, far from suspicious or pernicious eyes and hands. Once there, immersed in the decidedly plebeian culture, forced to pretend she is the opposite of herself, a normal little girl, our princess naturally has trouble making friends, at least of the human variety; when she discovers a carnival pony, however, it's love at first sight. But this love is soon threatened when the ne'er-do-well carnival owner (Bill Oberst Jr.) discovers her true identity, thus her true worth.

I'm not ashamed to admit, nor do I think it's weird, that as a grown man with no kids I found this to be an enjoyable film. Everyone loves a good fairy tale, and that's exactly what this is, a parable about virtue and friendship modernized for today's kids while retaining enough classical elements to feel timeless. The script, by director Rachel Lee Goldenberg (Sherlock Holmes) and Bill Parker (an Asylum editor), is balanced nicely between sentimental and adventurous, hitting all the right emotional chords without lapsing too much into being wholly either. The result is a fun, sweet, lively and uplifting film that - oh yeah, I'm going to say it - the whole family can enjoy.

Fiona Perry, a relative newcomer with a credit here or there, is the perfect princess, a child actress capable of portraying a burden most grown folk couldn't passably carry, that of being royalty, and the pressures, restrictions and in fact short-comings, socially and practically speaking, such a life implies. Miss Perry shows an emotional range well beyond her years, and is exactly the sort of little girl every other little girl would want to be friends with. The Asylum might have just found itself a Fanning-esque prodigy.

Ms. Lathan shines as Aunt Fay, as does Ron Hajak as Lawrence, the princess' American paternal figure, but it's the performance by Bill Oberst Jr. as despicable carnival owner Theodore Snyder that steals the show on the adults' end. As a sort of cartoonishly further-demented Daniel Plainview (click here, then here), he takes wickedness to a delightful new level and transforms what could have been a generic villain into a memorable adversary. They should shuffle this guy into a regular Asylum flick - he'd make a heck of a space marine platoon leader or serial killer.

All in all, then, the verdict on this one is positive. For a guy who doesn't really watch a lot of kid-oriented stuff (at least not the stuff made after, I don't know, 1987?) I wasn't really aware of the fact that I was watching something intended primarily for kids. A good story is a good story, and this was just that. Throw in some great performances and an uplifting ending - not something all Asylum films come with; I'm looking at you, When a Killer Calls and Sex Pot - and you got yourself a positive 85 minutes. If I had a daughter, I'd totally let her watch Princess and the Pony, and she'd totally love it. Committed from birth.",1298851200,5,3850,4.818456883509834

8426097,1,B004DTLUEE,"So my eight year old daughter picked this film and I knew it would probably be bad but I wasn't prepared for how bad.  The story was awful, the acting horrendous (except the main character, the 10 year old girl outshone the amateurish adults around her) and the production values... unbelievable!  I am so shocked that this was written, funded, approved, distributed etc by grown adults.
Please don't waste a dollar or a minute with this movie no matter how appealing the cover is to a young child.  The only thing I thought was ok was the children's pictures in the credits but to be honest a tour of my daughter's school hall would have the same effect.
Oh and did I mention there was guns!  And they were pointing at children and horses!  I'm now lost for words...",1379030400,,767,4.489208633093525
