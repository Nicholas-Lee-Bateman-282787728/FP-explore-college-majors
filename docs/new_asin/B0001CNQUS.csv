1988822,5,B0001CNQUS,"Basically an animated version of The Honeymooners set in the Stone Age, The Flintstones was the first prime-time cartoon series made especially for television. Created and produced by animation pioneers William Hanna & Joseph Barbera, The Flintstones remains one of the most globally recognized animated programs to date, with an opening theme song (""Meet The Flintstones"") that practically everyone knows the words to.

The original first season Flintstones theme was the instrumental 1960 main title ""Rise and Shine""  composed by musical director Hoyt Curtin, who provided the show's distinctive musical cues. ""Meet the Flintstones"" emerged in 1961 with lyrics written by series co-creator William ""Bill"" Hanna.

The exceptional voices were provided by Alan Reed as Fred Flintstone, dino-operator/quarry worker; Jean Vander Pyl as Wilma Flintstone, his wife; Mel Blanc as Barney Rubble, Fred's bosom buddy and lifelong pal; and Bea Benaderet as Betty Rubble, Barney's wife. June Foray provides Betty's voice in the Flagstones pilot which is included in this collection.

Despite the notoriously simple art direction (thick black lines, etc.) presented in the first season, it remains my favorite because the simple art style complements the Honeymooners-inspired dialogue and situations, in addition to Hoyt Curtin's uncanny musical feel of the show. A classic show inspired by a classic show!

1988823,5,B0001CNQUS,"First and foremost, I'm giving this box set a 5 star rating based SOLELY on the rerun episodes I've seen on TV.  ""The Flintstones"" simply rock (no pun intended)!  They are, in my opinion, the best classic cartoon series ever -- with ""The Jetsons"" a very close second.
Now to the DVD contents:
  -All 28 season one episodes (not just 14 as
  reviewer ""agentcastle"" may lead you to believe
  -Two featurettes
  -Early TV promo spots (this should be cool)
  -The original pilot episode called ""The Flagstones"" (very
  cool!)
  Now stop reading these stupid reviews and buy this box set!!  Oh, and buy ""The Family Guy"" box sets while you're at it!",1075939200,2,643,4.648648648648648
1988824,5,B0001CNQUS,"Before Matt Groening and pals introduced us to ""The Simpsons,"" Joseph Barbera and William Hannah produced a little show called ""The Flintstones.""  Season ""1"" was first aired on ABC during 1960 and has been syndicated in perpetuity throughout the known universe ever since.
Episode Guide:
(Screen Test) The Flagstones:  Admittedly, I've never seen the screen test (discovered in 1993) and cannot even vouch for it's inclusion in the DVD set-one can only hope.
(1) The Flintstone Flyer:  Barney invents a flying machine (the Barney Copter) which he later loses to his over-bearing best friend.  The duo uses the machine to ditch their wives and go bowling, thus setting the stage for years of adventures.
(2) Hot Lips Hannigan:  Fred relives his glory days as a singer in his high school band as he jams with an old pal.
(3) The Swimming Pool:  Fred and Barney construct a pool spanning across their backyards...a hilarious power struggle ensues.
(4) No Help Wanted:  Having cost his friend his job, Fred finds Barney a new job as a repo man.  Enter Dino.
(5) The Split Personality:  Following a blow to the noggin' Fred becomes his more refined alter, Frederick.
(6) The Monster from the Tar Pits:  Gary Granite is filming in Bedrock and lucky Fred finds a part in the film..., as his stunt double.
(7) The Babysitters:  Fred and Barney shirk their responsibilities and bring a baby to a friends house to watch the big fight.  BYOB?
(8) At the Races:  Fred and Barney rely on gambling for a quick-fix solution.  Do you think they win?
(9) The Engagement Ring:  Barney purchases a ring for Betty but Wilma discovers the ring and assumes it was for her... Instead of spending five minutes explaining the situation, Barney decides to enter a boxing contest with The Champ.
(10) Hollyrock, Here I Come:  The girls come up with a winning slogan and a trip to Hollyrock.  Lost without their better halves, Fred and Barney aren't far behind.
(11) The Golf Champion:  Fred demonstrates his prowess at golf, earning a trophy.  Barney, however, pesters his buddy as Fred neglected to pay his membership dues.
(12) The Sweepstakes Ticket:  Both the guys and gals purchase lottery tickets unbeknown to their spouses.  As they forever remain strapped for cash, I think you know how this one ends.
(13) The Drive-In:  Fred and Barney secretly quit their jobs to fulfill a short-lived dream of business ownership.  The gig is up when one of their attractive employees pays a visit to the Flintstone residence.
(14) The Prowler:  Terrorized by a neighborhood prowler, Betty and Wilma decide to take Judo lessons, despite Fred's objections.",1075593600,167,2622,4.880090497737557
1988825,5,B0001CNQUS,"I remember as a small child the FLINTSTONES had a different begginning and ending, as opposed to ""Meet the Flintstones"" which I later found out only came out for the 1963 season, but was later tacked onto ALL episodes for syndication purposes.{ So I guess this means that all the credits were wrong }.My big hope is that whoever compiled this set saw fit to restore the original opening and closing credits and music. BRING IT ON !!

1988866,5,B0001CNQUS,"For those of you who are looking into buying the Diamond Collection release of this show, here's the straight skinny: It's only the episodes, no bonus features.

The bonus features that you are missing are:

1) Original Opening and Closing Titles (Including sponsor plugs for One-A-Day Vitamins and Alka Seltzer!)
2) Original Opening Titles (These *were* different from the intro that everyone knows and loves, where they go ""Flintstones, Meet the Flintstones..."")
3) Some original Post Pebbles (Fruity and Cocoa) commercials! Only thing is, there's no audio. Dunno if that's intentional or not.
4) The original lost pilot episode where the Flintstones are ""The Flagstones"" (which got nixed because of the comic strip Hi and Lois)
5) Two commercials promoting a change to Thursday nights (after Pebbles came into the picture), which is a nice little footnote in TV history that I am glad was acknowledged.
6) One very barebones making of featurette (only 5 minutes max)
7) And one really neat thing talking about the wacky inventions they used on the show.
8) The packaging on the original releases (the 'picture window') is probably superior to the new release, though it doesn't entirely fit on the shelf very well.

So, really, if you're a fan, you're *probably* not missing all that much. If you just want the easiest route to the episodes themselves and don't care all that much about the bonus material (which on some of these releases is remarkably scant), then these new bare-bones Diamond Collection rereleases are the way to go. But if you *do* care? Then track down the original picture window (or Hanna-Barbera Golden Collection) releases. I may or may not track down the Diamond Collection rereleases wherever possible.",1500422400,3,1732,5.0701754385964914

I also noticed it is not available on any online streaming service. Oh well, for 14 bucks you get endless shows to enjoy and minus the commercials, as well as special features galore, I also bought Season Two and plan to buy the others as paychecks allow. I am pretty sure these have been restored too, as the sound is clearer and colors more bright and animation seems clearer than what I remember on my TV screen ....ever.

1989020,5,B0001CNQUS,"It is such a blast to revisit our childhood with our own children and enjoy the classics...The Flintstones has been an enjoyable throwback for us and our kids love a great ""drive-in"" movie night where we put down a picnic blanket and watch a couple of Flintstones episodes while we have dinner.  It was funny to see Dino in various colors as they tried to figure him out..and the opening song was completely different (not just for the Pilot!)...so many things that my husband and I had forgotten!

Still, even many many moons later (ha ha) we chuckle at the creative explanations the writers came up with for how to make various modern gadgets work in the ""prehistoric"" Flintstone era.  While many people might consider it a misogynistic show, I think it is imperative to point out that while Wilma and Betty stayed home and worked hard for their ungrateful husbands...they are the smarter characters on the show!  ha ha!  They are a prehistoric version of the classic 1950's-60's housewives..always looking well coiffed and adorable in their dresses and pearls/choker...and you can see who REALLY runs the show.  I'm a stay at home mom and former CEO and I am not offended by how they are portrayed.  ;-)",1461024000,3,1206,4.769230769230769

Waste of $$$$$!  You would think it would open up at least with the song & music, introducing The Flintstones but NO!!  It is jumps around episodes and poor sound quality. It is NOT ""From the first moment they arrive on scene""  and I quote from the package!  BEWARE to return this item!  $4.98 to return shipping..which is fair & I was aware of  BUT when my account was credited an extra fee, which I was NOT informed of was $11.93 to RESTOCK!!

1989236,1,B0001CNQUS,"this show is how old?????
from the 1960's?
and we are living now in the 20th century 2014
so this show may very well be over 50 years old, that is literally older then me.

I used to love this show as a kid, and one of the only places to find it is amazon or sometimes hulu, but even though this show is over 50 years old, they still don't include it with prime, you still have to pay for the season or individual episodes which is a complete rip off and totally not worth it at all.

How they have that new show ALPHAS probably not even 5 years old and season 1 and 2 free to watch on amazon prime...but then a show over 50 years old and its a cartoon not real people acting out infront of a camera and this is not free but expensive, amazon is so ridiculous they must have a 5 year old doing this price guide or whatever, only matter of time till they go out of business, or get sued for not fixing that mistake with the rentals, like when you first rent a movie and it says you have it for 28 days and you can even print out the detailed that says that you can view it for 28 days and then they make it expire in 2 days which is not only false advertisement false everything for that matter, its ridiculous, and every comment that exposes them they delete trying to say ""oh its not related"" even though there is a review of the actual show.",1399507200,3,1343,3.9888475836431225

1989274,3,B0001CNQUS,"This set is nice.  Images and sound are good.  The shows are from the first season (1960-61) that were a Friday evening distraction from the week's struggles.  These may not be the classic best Flintsones shows you are hoping for.  The shows are as complex in script as a typical American TV 'sitcom' series, but done with animation. These shows were before Pebbles and Bam Bam hit the screen, but Dino is there and loves Fred as he overpowers him.  The sabre tooth cat ""Baby Puss"" is there in these closing credits as Fred wakes up the neighborhood with his frustrated calls to Wilma when he is put out and the cat goes back in.

  The theme song and 'bumper' portions for the opening and ending are OK, but not as fun or polished as later years.  I think the 1964-65 shows have better humor and production.",1368748800,2,808,4.442176870748299

I really like each year to be in a separate box, much better Packaging, and no problems getting the DVDs in and out of the box, no scratches, The Flintstones Season one has 28 Episodes in 4 DVDs with Special Features, All about the Flintstones, Wacky Inventions, Early TV Commercials the Studio and the people who worked on the Series, Trailers and so much more, all very interesting

I particularly like all the colorful Drawings all over each box, they are Cool. Considering the shows were done in the 60's they are beautifully restored and look so good, so Crisp and with a Great Sound; Since this is the First Season every Episode has that Old Big Band Music Theme Song which is very similar to the new one the difference between them, in the First and Second Season it's only Instrumental, and in Season Three that's when they start to sing the old Familiar Song, I Posted the lyrics in Season Three, Each Episode is Entertaining and Fun to watch, even the story lines are much better than many Cartoons now days.

I received the first season of the Flintstones which I ASSUMED was from when I was little (80's). It was not. The first season was released in 1960. It was not geared towards children AT ALL and is more of an adult show. I guess they started gearing more towards kids in the 80's.,1282176000,,421,4.341772151898734

As an adult now u hear and see some of the gags different as when you were a kid but its fun for all ages. Hanna Barbera cartoons are great. I don't think there was ever a better cartoon sitcom than this. While the new ones today ...now get noticed by pushing the envelope they aren't really appropriate for kids in many cases . You cant fo wrong with this classic . They say the older cartoons have alittle political incorrectness . I would say its very mild here. Kids and adults will always enjoy rhese .

This cartoon promotes the Christian science Creationism, which declares that the Earth is 6000 years old and humans lived with dinosaurs. And lo and behold, there is Dino, living with the cavemen. It makes me sick to think that once upon a time, all our children were watching this smut. And believe me, all the Creationist preachers probably watched this show daily in the 1960's.

If you want your children to believe this lie, go on ahead and purchase this. But I know my kids are never going to have a gay old time in Bedrock.",1240358400,4,722,4.340740740740741

1989345,5,B0001CNQUS,"I have been a big fan of the Flintstones since watching their episodes first-run in the early 60's on ABC when I was a small child and have been an avid watcher since.  Happily, this DVD set does not disappoint!  Not only does it include all 28 episodes from the first season, but it also includes some vintage commercials that were run during that first season(ones that I vaguely remember), as well as the original, original pilot when it was still called ""The Flagstones.""  The other extras are worth seeing as well, including the history of ""The Flintstones.""

Taking ""The Honeymooners"" premise and putting it in a stone-age setting, ""The Flintstones"" pokes fun at suburban life in the early 1960's.  Even though one reviewer complained that they didn't remember Fred's behavior being so boorish, nor of him & Barney fighting so much or lying to their wives, just remember that this cartoon series was originally geared toward ADULTS (especially considering that three of their earliest sponsors were One-A-Day, Alka-Seltzer and Winston Cigarettes!).  This also harkened back to an earlier time when life was simpler and people could laugh at themselves more easily.  And, no, the ""adult"" plot lines did not affect me as a kid -- I just enjoyed watching the goofy-looking characters, clever sight gags, stone-age contraptions and slapstick humor!

Even though the drawings may look a bit cruder than those in the later seasons, the animation itself was more fluid and stylized, and less stilted than in the later seasons, and the timing, as always, was impeccable.  Notice Fred's overly expressive face, his and Barney's eyes bugging out upon discovering they have been drafted to the army for a 3-year term in ""The Astra'Nuts,"" the tuba player in the orchestra pit in ""The Flintstones Flyer,"" Perry Gunnite's ""strut"" in ""Love Letters on the Rocks,"" or Left-Foot Charlie's ""dancing"" with Wilma in ""The Golf Champion.""  And who of us could forget Fred & the 4 cops -- with Barney at the piano -- singing the William Tell rendition of ""Happy Anniversary"" in ""The Hot Piano""?

Probably the biggest thrill for me -- much to the dismay of other reviewers -- was seeing the ORIGINAL (""Rise and Shine"" instrumental) leader and trailer that was used for the first 2 seasons after more than 40 years!  (For those of you who grew up with the syndicated versions of ""The Flintstones,"" the ""Meet the Flintstones"" theme actually didn't appear until Season 3!)  I hadn't seen nor heard the original instrumental theme since I was 7 years old, but I vividly remembered seeing all the lights in the neighborhood turning back on when Fred was banging on the door and yelling ""WIL-MA!!""  But whenever I mentioned there being a different leader and trailer than ""Meet the Flintstones,"" people looked at me as if I were crazy!  What a kick it was to see it again after all these years -- and feeling vindicated at the same time!

I Yabba-Dabba-Do recommend buying this DVD set.  You'll have a ""gay old time""!",1229472000,5,2992,4.8698224852071

Barney & Fred seem to fight more than I remembered- do I want my kids watching that? They always make good in the end though. The biggest disappointment was the theme ""From the Town of Bedrock..."" is not sung in the first season- That's half the fun, the sing along!
Thus, go for the second season.",1192665600,5,415,4.265822784810126
1989350,5,B0001CNQUS,I love the Flintstones. I still remembered most of the episodes on the first season from when I was a kid. I cant wait to get the second season.,1192579200,,144,4.0
1989351,5,B0001CNQUS,"I received my DVD set last Friday, and within 30 minutes was watching the first episode.  This was a true classic in it's time.  It really is amazing that this is from 1960.  It could be from last week.  Well, with one major difference.  100% less crudeness.  Compared to today's, and even ""yesterday's"" current animated shows, this one is heads and shoulders above it's competition.  I watch this show with my young, under 10 kids, with no fear of them being offended, or grossed out.

I love the very start of this show, it's looseness, and care-free funny nature.

One thing, I notice already is it's old fashioned-ness.  The show is supposed to be back in the 60's, when young men and women married young, and because ""settled"" at a young age.  Fred seems ""old"" to me in today's terms.  He seems settled, but he doesn't even have any kids yet, in this first season.  Pebbles shows up later, around 3rd season.

If this were modern times, we would have seen Fred and Barney take a trek to a strip club, perhaps called: ""Flint Brothers' O'Farrell Theater.""  Something racy like that.

I really love the sound effects.  When Fred bowls, and runs toward the bowling alley, on his toes, we hear this adorable little scampering sound on a keyboard, to make the sound effect of his ""toes running.""  The Flintstones is filled with these little treasure treats.  I recommend it highly for any fan of good television, animated sorts, or clever humor.

Very nice.

1989352,5,B0001CNQUS,"After watching the first four seasons I can definitely say that my favorite is the original season. It is complete and utter fun. You can tell that the people doing it back in 1960 had a really good time (artists, voice actors, and writers).

In these episodes, the artist's lines are more loose and fun, the slapstick is actually very funny, and the action and situations are truly ""cartoony"", meaning impossible to duplicate in reality. This is the season that established so many things we love; Fred's angel and devil on his shoulders, practical and smart Wilma being the complete foil to bumbling wiseguy Fred, all the prehistoric animal ""appliances"" and household items, Barney and Fred's friendship through thick and thin, and veteran actors of the time doing assorted voice parts. How many times have I detected Floyd the Barber from another program of the '60s playing Fred's doctor, or Otis Campbell's voice coming from a minor character in Bedrock...

The sound effects alone are brilliant, as is the wonderful Hoyt Curtin's incidental scoring, of which he did endless amounts. I wish that all those background cues and melodies were available in a collection to buy.

In no other season after this one would you witness something as silly as Fred walking across his backyard, over the stone wall into the Rubbles' yard, while remaining perpendicular the whole time, as if the wall had its own gravity.

So if you buy just one season, I would recommend this one, the debut. Don't expect the theme song we all know from syndication; that comes in later seasons. But it's no big deal.",1186444800,,1593,4.867158671586716
1989353,3,B0001CNQUS,"I grew up watching the Flintstones, so when I wanted to get some episodes to show to my children I bought season one.  The biggest suprise from season one is that I was not greeted with the familiar Flintstones theme song (I assume this comes in a later season).  The animation seems a little ""rough"" on some of the early episodes too.  But the more we watch and the further we get into the discs, the more it improves.  My suggestion for anyone purchasing the Flintstones is to throughly read the reviews and descriptions to find out what that particular season contains.",1183766400,3,572,4.578431372549019
1989354,4,B0001CNQUS,"I bought this as soon as I saw it for two reasons: the opening and closing sequences and the commercials. I was happy with the former, disappointed with the latter, which connects with the one overall beef I have with this DVD set.

As for the episodes, you'll notice they're drawn differently than in later years. The characters seem to be larger in relation to their surroundings. I find the animation, limited animation though it is, to be funnier than in the later eps. You'll also notice no Pebbles or Bamm-Bamm. They wouldn't enter the picture until the third and fourth seasons, respectively. It's nice watching Fred and Barney carry the action during the early seasons.

For years, the original openings and closings of the first season were replaced by the better remembered scenes and songs of the later seasons. So generations of Flintstone fans didn't know that the phrase ""someday, maybe Fred will win the fight/and that cat will stay out for the night"" actually referred back to the original closing. Or that, like Mary Tyler Moore and The Dick Van Dyke Show, The Flintstones' most famous theme song wasn't the original one.
Also, the opening scenes might remind younger viewers of The Simpsons opening. There's more than a little irony there, as The Simpsons long ago surpassed The Flintstones as the longest running animated prime time show and that the very creative Matt Groenig might've been ripping off Hanna-Barbera, a team that ranks just below Linda Ronstadt as ripoff artists.

Speaking of which, that's one disappointing thing in the extras. Maybe I missed it, but nowhere does anyone acknowledge that The Flintstones is The Honeymooners taken from the 1950s to the Stone Age and set in the suburbs.

But that's keeping with another little manipulation in the extras. Big ups for including the commercials, a reminder of when television shows were sponsored by one or two sponsors, the cast did commercials for those products in character and sometimes images of those products dominated the closing credits. Most shows altered those closing credits for syndication and DVD release. Here, we see the ads for 1-A-Day and Alka Seltzer, clearly done to be placed just after the opening sequence and before teh closing credits. But the commercial for Winston cigarettes? Nowhere, as if to deny that part of the show's history.

Yeah, yeah, kids will be watching this, blah, blah, blah. Hey, if Time Warner can put some of the classic Warner Bros. cartoons with politically incorrect racial images on a DVD with a ""it's wrong, but that's the way it was"" disclaimer, then Time Warner can let us see Fred and Barney hawking ciggies. As with Joe Camel, if your kid starts smoking because some cartoon character is pushing the product, the problem ain't with the cartoon character. And, trust me, I'm a major anti-smoker, but I find cigarette ads fascinating.

This is, to me, still the best of the Flintstone DVDs I own. Maybe it's because I'm OD'd on the seasons with the kids because my daughter loves those, so they've been in Heavy Rotation for the last year. But I think it's just because the early seasons of The Flintstones were the best.",1183248000,5,3162,4.889925373134329
1989355,5,B0001CNQUS,"I knew I had great memories of this series for a reason.

I can remember watching this series in prime time when I was a kid with my parents, and all of us laughing. I think it is difficult now, after the glorious onslaught of great prime time animation like the Simpsons and Family Guy, to appreciate what a revolutionary show the Flintstones was. These 28 episodes aired in 1959-60, and the concept of airing an animated situation comedy for adults was pure lunacy - not to mention that the show was set in the Stone Age. I can only imagine the blank stares or nervous sideways-glances cartoon geniuses William Hanna and Joe Barbera must have gotten in television's executive boardrooms.

Luckily, sometimes cream really does rise to the surface. All I can say is if you are a baby-boomer like me, watching the first season of this classic series is a pure pleasure. Not to wax nostalgic, but man - what a great rush. The writing on this series was always sharp with a hip edge (not quite as caustically brilliant as the Bullwinkle Show, but more warm and human). The vocal talent was unbelievable.  I can remember feeling as a boy that the gentle yet sometimes sarcastic voice of Wilma (Jean Vander Pyl) and the sweet, bubbly voice of Betty (Bea Benaderet) were somehow the template for how adult women sounded and talked.  And somehow whenever Barney spoke, it was funny, for which we can credit the acting prowess of Mel Blanc.

Finally, as with all the currently released Hanna/Barbera DVD sets, these cartoons look fantastic. The colors are brilliant and the sound is beautiful (remember that fantastic sound Barney always made when chomping into a pterodactyl drumstick or sandwich?).

If you were too young to catch this series the first time around, do yourself a favor and meet the Flintstones. They're a modern, Stone Age family and they live right down the street.

All in all, a real gift on DVD. --- Mykal Banta",1182816000,7,1926,4.6973293768546

This show centers around loudmouthed Fred Flintstone, his feisty wife Wilma, his lovable best friend Barney Rubble, and Barney's wife, Betty. Some of the episodes are funny; others are sweet; still others are both.

One of the funniest episodes is ""The Hypnotist,"" in which Fred makes Barney think he's a dog and can't get him back to normal. Even the vet doesn't seem to notice he's a human. (You know, with all the new breeds of dogs, it's getting harder to tell all the time.)

To the people that said there aren't many extras: you're right. But the main stuff is so great that I honestly don't mind. In fact, I can only think of one thing wrong with this set: once you see all the episodes on here, you'll want Season Two. Trust me; I speak from experience.

1989382,5,B0001CNQUS,"Turning the television world flat on its head, The Flintstones became the first animated hit series in prime time history. Set in the Stone Age town of Bedrock, the show explored the lives of ancient cave dwellers through the lens of a modern lifestyle, with bird beaks acting as phonograph needles, elephant trunks as vacuum cleaners, and fireflies as light bulbs. With its measured use of top-grade humor and clever visuals, The Flintstones became an instant smash hit - spawning decades of syndicated re-runs, spin-offs, and thousands of derivative products...

Loosely modeled after the hit show The Honeymooners, The Flintstones follows the lives of burly loudmouth Fred Flintstone (who has a heart of gold) and his wife Wilma (who puts up with him). The couple lives next door to best friends Barney and Betty Rubble, and they have a dog (a dinosaur) named Dino to keep them company. Following in the footsteps of shows such as I Love Lucy, the show's characters are always inventing hair-brained schemes, attempting to cover up little white lies, or engaging in some other form of behavior bound to get them in trouble. The Flintstones also features numerous cameo appearances parodying famous personalities from the early-sixties... In the show's later years, each couple would add a child to the mix with Fred & Wilma having Pebbles (a little girl) and Barney & Betty adopting Bamm-Bamm (a little boy)...

The Flintstones (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""The Flintstone Flyer"" in which Fred pretends to be sick so he and Barney can get out of going to the opera with Wilma and Betty. Escaping in their Stone Age helicopter, the two go bowling, but it isn't long before Barney spills the beans on what they really did... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""The Swimming Pool"" in which Fred and Barney build a pool together only to have it strain their friendship, and ""Hollyrock, Here I Come"" in which Betty and Wilma win a trip to Hollyrock as a television game show prize...

1989383,5,B0001CNQUS,"I recently cheked this out from the library and had not seen a complete Flintstones episode in about twenty years.

I loved it as a child and it's STILL great! The episode where Fred and Barney accidentally joined the army is filled with great gags. Fred's public debut in ""The Flintsome Flyer"" was far funnier than the ""Swimming Pool"" (which was actually the first one produced). The latter episode is a little too heavy on Fred's cruelty to Barney to be funny.

But I digress, much has been said about these great episodes, so on to the special features. We get THE FLAGSTONES (1959, the pilot) with the original soundtrack. Our beloved foursome look extremely crude in this one, but we see a good glimpse of what was to come (this segment was later expanded into the swimming pool episode). The Alka seltzer ads are interesting, but why are the fruity pebbles commercials included without sound?

For those looking for the (in)famous Winston Cigarette commericals with the Flintstones, these may be found on the ""Classic Commericals"" DVD.

The original openings and closings are here. Interesting for historical accuracy, but less netertaining than our man sliding down the dinosaur, taking the family to see ""The Monster"" at the drive-in, etc. that strikes such a chord in the memory of most Flintstomne fans. That wasn't until 1962, so I guess we'll have to wait for those.

But in either case, this is well-written timeless, funny stuff that can be enjoyed by multiple generations. You don't have to be a baby boomer or Gen X-er to love this, so bring the family in the living room with some snacks when this DVD arrives and as the theme says, have a gay (oops!

Having not yet seen this DVD set (but look forward to!), but having much experience with ""The Flintstones"" going back to its first-run days, I can assure Ms. Gibson that the ""weird 'new' music"" she complains about is indeed the *original* program theme (as many reviewers have pointed out). When ""The Flintstones"" was first syndicated in 1966-67, the first two seasons' original themes were lopped off and an edited print of the 1962 theme was added on. Don't believe it? Look at the copyright date at the end of the syndicated first- and second-season episodes: ""COPYRIGHT (C) 1962..."" Also, note that part of the *audio* in the opening theme is excised (""...courtesy of Fred's two feet"") and at that point picture and sound no longer sync. There is no 'pop' as Dino's head pops through the car roof, and *silence* as the ""camera"" goes to and zooms into the movie screen. For YEARS I had hoped to once again see and hear the original theme, and only recently (on the Cartoon Network) did I finally get my wish. Now, with this DVD, I can see it at will. Looking forward to getting a copy!

1989399,5,B0001CNQUS,"This is the 1st season of one of the longest running animated TV shows (as far as I know, only the Simpsons has surpassed it).  These are the early days of Fred (voiced by Alan Reed), Wilma (voiced by Jean VanderPyl), Barney (voiced by the multitalented Mel Blanc) and Betty (voiced by Bea Benederet).  Dino would be introduced in the episode No Help Wanted but wouldn't become a regular until The Snorkasaurus Story.  There are references to Tuesday Welch (Wednesday Tuesday), Cary Grant (Gary Granite), and Arthur Murray (Arthur Quarry).  Also, it took until the middle of this 1st season for Mel Blanc to perfect Barney's voice (originally, it was higher pitched and more nasally, rather than the dopier sounding voice, with the hiccuppy laugh).  Fred originally shouted ""Yahoo!"" (as he does quite frequently in the 1st episode ""The Swimming Pool"").  Alan Reed thought ""Yabba dabba doo!"" was perhaps more fitting and that became Fred's line.  Also, the openning and closing theme are quite different from what you probably remember seeing on reruns, a song called ""Rise and Shine,"" which sounds similar to The Bugs Bunny theme, ""Overture- This Is It."" At the beginning, Fred comes home from work, grabs a large sandwich from Wilma, kisses her on the cheek and turns on the TV.

Highlights from this season include Fred and Barney using an invention of Barney's called the Flintstone Flyer, a helicopter which looks like an eggbeater (they use it to go to the bowling alley even though they have a date with Wilma and Betty at the opera), Fred and Barney sharing a swimming pool (which causes arguments over whose turn it is to share the pool with their friends and a visit from the cops when the fun gets a little too noisy), Wilma thinking Fred forgot their anniversary (featuring the ""Happy Anniversary"" tune, sung a la William Tell Overture), Wilma and Betty rent their empty rooms out to 2 college students (whose musical talents drive both Fred and Barney crazy!), Fred trying to lose weight with the help of Food Anonymous (""Oink! Oink! Oink! Oink!""), Fred and Barney sneak out to meet up with Hot Lips Hannigan (not knowing that Wilma and Betty are also at the nightclub in disguise), Barney getting a job as a repossessor (the best part is where Fred turns the TV on and Barney is inside!), Fred and Barney open a diner (with 2 waitresses with Brooklyn accents ""Here we come on d'run with a boiger on a bun...""), Barney is President of a country club and confiscates a golfing trophy of Fred's since his dues aren't paid (""What's amatter with Flintstone?  He's alright!""), Fred and Barney find a big bag of cash and get mistaken as bankrobbers, Fred gets hit on the head with a bottle and takes on the alterego of Frederick, a sophisticated aristocrat who loves opera and hates bowling (""Please, you are wrinkling my fur!""), Wilma and Betty enter their recipe for the Upside Down Flint-Rubble Bubble Cake but can't compete in person as they both catch the measles (so Fred and Barney, in drag, try to save the day), Fred is confused as J.R. Gotrocks and asked to double for him (""Whose baby is that?  What's your angle?  I'll buy that!""), Fred and Barney accidentally join the army wind up as test pilots for the 1st ever rocketship to the moon and in another episode, they lead a cave scout jamboree on a camping trip.

The extra's may not be as good but there are plenty of great episodes, all shown uncut (I can remember as a kid getting angry because certain scenes were cut out).",1101600000,15,3495,4.702127659574468

Where are the beer and cigarette commercials which were part of the original program???????? And why do the ""Pebbles"" commercials have no sound....let alone, why are they even included? ""Pebbles"" didn't come to fruition until the later years of the program.",1096934400,6,490,4.845238095238095
1989402,5,B0001CNQUS,"As a ""Flintstones"" fan from birth who's seen all 150-plus episodes at least twice over (I think), it's great to see this animated classic appear in full-season, DVD form. This package from 1960-61 is, for me, classic Fred and Barney: pre-Pebbles with great dialogue and more than a little bite. You really can catch the Gleason-Carney spirit in episodes like ""Arthur Quarry's Dance Studio"" and ""Hot Lips Hannigan"", and Wilma isn't exactly a shrinking violet either. The animation was fresh then, too, with the H-B team creating its first batch of animal, bird and fish-powered appliances. My favorites on this set are ""Drive-Inn"" with the two singing car hop girls (who have a Brooklyn accent to die for), ""Astro-Nuts"" with Fred and Barney blundering into the Army (complete with a great Bilko-esque sergeant), and ""In The Dough"" with Fred and Barney in drag (special guest stars: the Tasty-Pastry Flour man and the immortal ""Upside-Down Flint-Rubble-Double-Bubble Cake""!). And, of course, nobody ever forgot the late Alan Reed and his lovable, blustery, kind-hearted voice for the world's favorite Stone Ager. Quality is about as good as you can expect for low-tech '60s animation, and the title sequence- minus the vocal theme song we all know- is actually more interesting, with Fred climbing up the dino-stairs to the cleaners (not the first time he got taken there!). Not much on extras except for a cute little clip of the prehistoric, usually bird or monkey-powered gadgets. In all, you pick this up for the shows and they're all here- the birth of what, to me, is still the first family of TV cartoons...and maybe the first family ever!",1096070400,6,1644,5.0036496350364965
1989403,5,B0001CNQUS,"Well, maybe having just celebrated a milestone birthday, I was feeling like re-capturing my youth.  Perhaps that explains why I put this set and the ""Jetson's"" on my wish list and was given them on my birthday.  Regardless, this is one of the best DVD sets around.  The artwork and picture quality, especially the color, is amazing.  Being too young to see this as a prime time show, I enjoyed it as part of after school cartoons.  One possible explanation on why the color is so amazing is that I watched the show in black and white as an adolescent.

I have to disagree with some other reviewers here in regards to the extra material.  I think it is outstanding.  The bonus material includes the original pilot called ""The Flagstones"" and some wonderful time period commercials and promos for the show.  That is my favorite part of the set.

The episodes are longer than I remember, as they have been restored to their original length.  Like the ""Jetson's"" one can really see the 60's influence.  From the music to the terminology it is easy to see why this was simply an animated sitcom for the time.

I have not had the chance to view more than just the first disc and bonus materials, but will be glad to pop this in when I need that nostalgia fix.  The DVD packaging and presentation is simply superb.  If you have fond memories of this show, then it is worth it to buy the set.  Well done.",1093046400,84,1396,4.437007874015748

I come from a big family and we all love the show and my son who is almost 20 also loves it. He too is very excited that I have  bought this dvd. We will all wait patiently for the following seasons and then buy them too. I am very disappointed that they are not on tv for us to watch anymore like it used to be. Shame on the cartoon network.

1989410,3,B0001CNQUS,"I glad this series has made it to DVD, but to be honest, the picture quality is lower than I expected, and I didn't expect much considering the age of the cartoon.
Granted, the image is mostly sharp and the colors are bright, but the digital compression artifacts and pixelization that is present at all times is pretty bad, and is fairly distracting... the cartoon looks pretty 'dirty' alot of the time, and its not from the original prints... upon inspection using pause and zoom, its evident that its just compression artifacts, which Im assuming were caused by mistake, cus I can make a better, cleaner looking mpeg2 file on my obsolete home pc using a software encoder. :P
Ive also downloaded plenty of 'home-made' VCDs and SVCDs that looked 100% better than these Flintstones episodes, which brings me to the conclusion that someone forgot to enable some sort of 'image processing filter' during the mastering of these cartoons for the DVDs or something..
Still, it is better than nothing I suppose, and I sincerely hope later season sets will look cleaner. Im also keeping my fingers crossed for the Jonny Quest box set image quality to be better than the first season of Flintstones, or I may have to stop buying the HB Golden Collection sets...",1084060800,2,1253,4.778801843317972
1989411,5,B0001CNQUS,I have seen all the episodes at least three times over.  One of the funniest series to grace television.  The Prowler is my favorite episode.  While the extras aren't much I really don't care.  Just having the complete first season at my disposal at any time is enough for me. Can't wait till Season two!,1083974400,4,304,4.472727272727273
1989412,5,B0001CNQUS,"Finally got this DVD and from the minute I watched the first episode I immediatly loved it. The colors are crisp, bright and sharp (I wonder if they enhanced them or is a broadcast making them look bad?) and although the sound is in mono it still sounds good. Besides that, they kept the intros and outros to every episode and there's even a snippet of every cartoon just before the one you selected starts to play.
People are complaining about the lack of certain extras... well... even one bonus film is already an extra. You buy this set for the 28 episodes and not for the bonus stuff, so having all the commercials or the pilot shot is just a nice filler. When they weren't on the last disc I might not even miss them.
Anyway, I love this set and I expect to see more volumes some day (why else would they put a number '1' on the side of the packaging?). Keep it coming!",1081987200,23,875,4.245508982035928

1989414,4,B0001CNQUS,"Warner Home Video did an excellent job in putting the Flintstones on DVD, the audio and visual are fantastic. However, the extras are lacking. The Flinstones are, for better or worse, a time capsule of the early sixties. The extras would have been better, and the entire series would make more sense to younger viewers, if Warner Home Video explained some of the pop culture that the Flinstones poked fun at. For example, Arthur Quarry's Dance Club was inspired by Arthur Murray's Dance Studio which was very popular in the sixties; Hi-Fye was a caricature of Buddy Holly and ""that Georgia Boy"" was Elvis; The Creature at from Tar Pits poked fun at the Creature from the Black Lagoon and the list goes on. Also there were other voices in the series that appeared in other cartoons or TV series: Paul Frees was Boris Badenov, Hal Smith was Otis the Drunk in the Andy Griffith Show, Daws Butler was Yogi Bear. There's also some mistakes in the Flintstones for example in the Sweepstakes Ticket there's mention of sneakers but the Flinstones don't wear shoes!

Out of 28 episodes, 5 were dubbed in France. For a big fan of the Flinstones from Quebec, it is unacceptable. Moreover, I know that the episodes dubbed in France have been dubbed in Quebec as well.

The series is great though and Flintstones fans will love it.  Another odd thing...the last disc is double sided.  But you're guaranteed to enjoy!",1080432000,,483,4.783132530120482
1989419,4,B0001CNQUS,"In terms of animation and story line today's cartoons ( yes, that includes ""The Simpsons"") pale in comparison to the 1960's. The cartoons of the '60's imparted a moral lesson without being corny; the animation was vivid and lifelike. ""The Flintstones"", which was inspired by ""The Honeymooners"" and aired on prime-time on ABC from 1960-1966, depicted the day and the life of a cave construction worker and his stay at home wife. It's helpful to view ""The Flintstones"" as a sort of social commentary of the '60's: dinner was eaten at home, rock-n-roll was crazy teen-age music, dance studios were popular, husbands had jobs and wives stayed home etc.
  Watching ""The Flinstones"" was fun. Granted some episodes wouldn't be aired given today's politically correct nature (for example the short, buck-toothed, bespectacled, heavily accented judo instructor), however, each episode imparted a moral lesson (usually honesty is the best policy).
  Some little tidbits about ""The Flintstones"": Cesar Cedeno an outfielder for the Houston Astros in the early '70's learned to speak English by watching ""The Flintstones"". Floyd the Barber from the Andy Griffith Show never spoke on the Flinstones, but rather this was an impersonation by John Stephenson. Other guest voices included Hal Smith (Otis the drunk from the Andy Grffith Show), Daws Butler (Hokey Wolf), Don Messick (Muttley) and Paul Frees (Boris Badenov).In Hollyrock, Here I Come,  Fred refers to the producer as ""J.B."" . This is an inside joke (""J.B."" are Joseph Barbera's initial). In The Sweepstakes Ticket, there's a reference to ""sneakers"" which is a bit strange since the Flinstones don't wear shoes.
  ""The Flinstones-The Complete First Season"" brings back the joy of watching Fred, Barney, Wilma, and Betty again. I agree with earlier reviewers that the extras are lacking and if if it were a little better I would have given the DVD 5 stars.",1080432000,2,1901,5.172638436482084

I grew up with this prime time show that aired from September 30th,1960 on ABC at 8:30 Friday night  to September 2nd, 1966. The teem of Hanna-Barbera sure did well with this and numerous other shows. Anyone who grew up in the sixties as I did sure had some great shows to watch, and now they're classics. This DVD set is in a beautiful and colorful package. It's well designed. Another GREAT feature is that they use the original opening and closing for the show. They used this opening for the first two season before going to the all too familiar open and song. This set is a MUST FOR ever house hold. Please buy this DVD set...you won't be unhappy.

1989436,4,B0001CNQUS,"While it is terrific to have the first season of this landmark series on DVD, connoisseurs and diehard fans may be disappointed.  I know I was.  The picture and color quality are superb, but the all-important laugh track has been removed from a number of episodes.  Why ""all-important""?  The addition of the laugh track gave ""The Flintstones"" legitimacy as a primetime series, boldly conforming it to live-action situation comedies.  You wouldn't remove the laugh track from, say, ""The Beverly Hillbillies,"" now would you?
Let's hope that seasons 2-6 appear on DVD, too.  But please, Warner Video, present ""The Flintstones"" with the laugh track, as William Hanna and Joseph Barbera intended the series to be seen.",1079913600,3,713,5.156521739130435
1989437,5,B0001CNQUS,"Like so many others who remember watching these classic Hanna-Barbera when they originally ran in the sixties and seventies, I'm so glad that Warner Bros has seen fit to distribute these classics of good, quality american animation.
While most anime shows concentrate on extensive dialogue and fancy computer animation, watching these classics on DVD with the simple animation and easy to follow simple plotlines, it's take me back to an easier time of my childhood.
While I haven't seen most of these episodes, this DVD set really made me laugh because of the obvious connection to the Honeymooners television series that it seems modeled after. If you're a fan of classic animation and of simpler times without the violence that occupies so much animation these days, this is the ultimate in family entertainment any any fan would truly feel deprived if they passed this one up.",1079827200,2,880,5.034246575342466

I guess I might be a little spoiled by the Looney Tunes Gold set, but I was expecting much more. When they wait this long to release a show of this calibur they better throw in a lot of fun extras.

Yabadabadoo!!",1079481600,3,423,4.384615384615385
1989442,4,B0001CNQUS,"First of all, it is important for me to say how much I support Warner Brothers Home Video for FINALLY getting some classic Hanna-Barbera titles out there on DVD. I am already looking forward to Season 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Please keep them coming.
This is a long-awaited set of what HAS to be, (arguably) the best season of The Flintstones' six season run, (do in most part to the brilliant writing of Warner Brothers story veterans Warren Foster and Michael Maltese, the superb timing of the animation and excellent casting, (Alan Reed, Mel Blanc, Jean Vander Pyl and Bea Benaderet). In fact, one of the reasons I became an animator is because I was exposed to these shows as a child when they ran in prime time. And still, over 40 years later, they remain fresh, VERY funny and remarkably well produced for television. I am now working in television animation, after decades at Disney Features, and watching these shows just makes my jaw drop (right to the ground), because I know how hard it is to make a good show on a limited budget and time schedule. It just goes to show you what can happen when a group of people who know and understand FULL animation (Tom & Jerry, etc.), get together to do LIMITED animation. There may not be as many drawings, but what's there is choice!
The Extras on this box set are marginal and seem slapped together haphazardly. There are also fewer of them then there were on the famous Laser Disc set from a few years back. Some are the same as on the Laserdiscs, but there are a few new ones. In the end, there is nothing really very noteworthy in the ""Extras"" section EXCEPT a very fun little bit under ""Wacky Inventions."" This short, ""Mockumentary"" is outstanding in that it uses clips from the shows to describe the stone-age gimmicks and gadgets created for the episodes. It is done in a style very similar to the series and features nice voiceover commentary by someone that sounds VERY much like a young John Stephenson, (who provided many voices for the original series including a voice for the many faces of Mr. Slate, Fred's boss at the quarry).
Overall, this series is wonderful to finally have on DVD, the only reasons I hesitate to give this set a full 5 stars is because we get little more than what is currently broadcast on television. A number of the shows have been completely stripped of their laugh tracks, the end credits are generic and inaccurate, the shows do not seem to be listed or shown in the order that they were produced or were originally broadcast, and there are some inaccuracies in the ""facts"" presented about the show, (Dino, does in fact appear well before ""The Snorkasaurus Hunt"" but he only talks (like Phil Silvers), in that one episode.
One can only hope that future sets earmarked for release (notably The Jetsons and Jonny Quest), will find the episodes restored to their original length with their original soundtracks and credits intact because they are currently shown, (particularly The Jetsons) hacked to ribbons when they are broadcast on television. If Warner Brothers Home Video, who now owns the original Hanna-Barbera library, is going to go to the trouble of releasing a special box set of these famous series (and what about Top Cat?), please put back the missing footage taken out to make room for more commercials on television. Otherwise, folks, what's the point?
At any rate, hats off to Bill, Joe and their fantastic crew of animators, designers, painters, musicians and actors for their brilliant work on ""The Flintstones"" a series that truly stands the test of time.",1079481600,13,3559,4.686900958466453
1989443,5,B0001CNQUS,"At last, maybe the best animated prime-time series EVER is finally getting the DVD treatment.  I bought ""The Flintstones - The Complete First Season"" the day it came out, so far have only watched a couple of episodes but WOW!  The color is vibrant, leaps off the tv, and the sound quality is great as well.  WOW.
The first season, contrary to what you've read here, does not contain 14 episodes, but ALL 28 OF THE FIRST SEASON!  YAY!  Some of the best known and loved are on this set, and the episodes are in their original running order:

1. The Flintstone Flyer -- Fred pretends to be sick so he and Barney can get out of taking their wives to the opera. Using a prehistoric helicopter as a means of escape, the two of them join their bowling team for a night of fun. They almost get away with their scheme, until loose-lipped Barney gives away their night's activities.

2. Hot Lips Hannigan -- Believing he has made Wilma and Betty disappear through magic, Fred capitalizes on his newfound freedom by taking Barney to a nightclub, the Rockland, where an old friend, trumpeter Hot Lips Hannigan, is performing. The jazz is cool until the wives show up to teach their wayward husbands a lesson.

3. The Swimming Pool -- Fred and Barney jointly build a swimming pool, but Barney hogs the pool time, angering Fred. To get even, Fred hires a pal to pose as a police officer and break up one of his neighbor's pool parties.  NOTE: This was the first episode to be recorded.  It incorporated the original forty-five second network ""pilot"" sequence produced to sell the series.

4. No Help Wanted -- Fred uses his influence with a business friend to obtain a job for Barney, who becomes a furniture repossessor. To the dismay of both, Barney's first assignment is to repossess Fred's television! Unwilling to betray his friend, Barney pays off Fred's delinquent television bill with his first paycheck.
5. The Split Personality -- A conk on the head turns Fred into an aristocratic sophisticate - ""Frederick"" - whose behavior manages to disrupt the entire city of Bedrock.
6. The Monster from the Tar Pits -- A Hollyrock film company goes on location in Bedrock to film its new feature, ""Monster From The Tar Pits,"" and gullible Fred is enlisted as stand-in for star Gary Granite. But Fred's real problems begin when Wilma and Betty audition for roles in the film and end up going ga-ga upon meeting movie stars Rock Pile and Wednesday Tuesday.
7. The Babysitters -- Roped into babysitting little Egbert, the child of a friend, Fred and Barney take the baby over to pal Joe Rockhead's house to watch the fights on television. Egbert befriends Joe's pet runtosaurus and dresses the creature up in his baby clothes, which results in chaos when the pet--whom Fred and Barney mistake for the baby--escapes from the house and dashes up a tree.  NOTE: Veteran voice-over artist Paul Frees provides the voice of Barney's boss (the only time we ever catch a glimpse of Barney's workplace).
8. At the Races -- To finance their dream of opening a pool hall, Fred and Barney visit the dinosaur racetrack where Fred bets his entire paycheck on a long shot. He tells Wilma that he has lost his check. When the long shot pays off, Fred and Barney are initially elated, but they quickly realize their problems are only beginning.

9. The Engagement Ring -- Barney decides to surprise Betty with a belated engagement ring, which he gives to Fred for safekeeping. But Wilma discovers the ring and assumes it is a gift for her. Not wanting to shatter her illusions, Fred decides to buy a second ring, but doesn't have the cash. He cons Barney into going several rounds with a boxing champ in order to win a $500 prize.

10. Hollyrock, Here I Come -- Wilma and Betty win a trip to Hollyrock from a television contest. Finding themselves lonely and bored, Fred and Barney take vacations from work and follow them out. When Wilma is ""discovered,"" Fred muscles his own way into the world of television to bring her back.

11. The Golf Champion -- Fred's victory in The Loyal Order of Dinosaurs golf tournament is soured when club president Barney withholds his trophy for nonpayment of club dues. Fred retaliates by demanding that Barney return every item he has borrowed over the years. The stalemate continues until Wilma and Betty manage to bring their husbands back together.

12. The Sweepstakes Ticket -- Barney hides the sweepstakes ticket he and Fred have bought in the lining of an old coat, which Betty subsequently gives to a passing hobo. While the boys try to recover the ticket, convinced it is the winning one, Wilma and Betty have their own winning ticket stashed away at the Rubble's house.

13. The Drive-in -- Fed up with their jobs, Fred and Barney secretly plan to buy a restaurant, but then Fred has to deal with a suspicious Wilma who wants to know why two young girls (carhops who are seeking a job) are calling for him, and what the messages regarding two tons of dino-burger meat mean.

14. The Prowler -- With a prowler on the loose in Bedrock, Betty decides to take judo lessons to protect herself. When Wilma wants to take lessons also, Fred ridicules the idea, arguing that one glimpse of a burglar would send her running in fear. To prove his point, Fred poses as the prowler and sneaks into the Rubble household, on the same night the real criminal shows up.

15. The Girls Night Out -- Fred and Barney decide to treat their wives to a night out at an amusement park. Fred cuts a song at a recording booth as a souvenir but misplaces the record. It is later discovered by a group of teens who pass it along to a deejay, and Fred is suddenly transformed into unwitting rock star ""Hi-Fye.""

16. Arthur Quarry's Dance Class -- Fred and Barney sign up for dance lessons at Arthur Quarry's so that they do not humiliate themselves at the charity ball. Their excuse that they have joined the volunteer fire department falls apart when Betty and Wilma realize that the all-stone town of Bedrock is fire proof. The wives then suspect that their husbands are slipping out to meet other women.

17. The Big Bank Robbery -- When he discovers a bag containing $86,000, Fred's dreams of being a wealthy man finally seem to be coming true. But the money has been stolen from the bank, so Wilma and Betty force Fred and Barney to return the money to the bank, and unwittingly set them up as the primary suspects! The wives set a trap for the real culprits and Fred ends up saving the day.

18. The Snorkasaurus Hunter -- Would-be hunter Fred convinces Wilma and the Rubbles to spend their vacation time in the mountains, hunting for snorkasaurus. Fred is successful in his hunt, but he gets more than he bargained for when the wives insist that the snorkasaurus be taken home as their new pet, Dino.

19. The Hot Piano -- Who HASN'T had that ""Happy Anniversary"" song going through their head!  To commemorate his tenth wedding anniversary (which he only remembers because it falls on ""Trash Day""), Fred wants to buy Wilma a Stoneway piano. He finds a hot deal--ultimately too hot--from a shady, cash-only businessman named 88 Fingers Louie.

20. The Hypnotist -- While attempting to demonstrate his skill as a hypnotist to his wife and the Rubbles, Fred manages to hypnotize Barney into thinking that he is a frisky puppy, and is then unable to bring him back.

21. Love Letters on the Rocks -- Jealous Fred's discovery of a love poem that was sent to Wilma prompts him to hire Bedrock's top detective Perry Gunite, to find out who the home-wrecking poet is. Gunite's investigation mistakenly points to Barney. Fred plans revenge against his friend until Wilma reminds her husband that he had written the poem himself years earlier, during their courtship.

22. The Tycoon -- When industrial tycoon J.L. Gotrocks decides he wants to rub shoulders with the common people, dead-ringer Fred is hired to fill in for him in the board room. Fred savors his new lifestyle at the country club, but the plan begins to unravel when J.L. demonstrates little tolerance for the common folk.

23. The Astra' Nuts -- Thinking they are undergoing an examination for a physical contest, Fred and Barney mistakenly sign up for a three-year stint in the Army! After a tearful goodbye to their wives they enter into the service, where they quickly blunder their way into volunteering for the first lunar landing mission.
24. The Long, Long Weekend -- Friend Gus Gravel invites the Flintstones and the Rubbles to his seaside hotel for an all-expense-paid vacation. But upon arriving, the four find that the hotel's planned ""activities"" seem more like work. Gus finally confesses that his entire hotel staff has just resigned on the eve of a huge convention.

25. In the Dough -- One of the best episodes EVER.  Wilma and Betty are finalists in a television bake-off, but on the eve of the event, they contract measles. Donning wigs and dresses, Fred and Barney take their places in the contest.

26. The Good Scout -- Assuming the command of a Boy Scout troop, Fred quickly learns the hazards of a ""routine"" camping trip. Fred blunders his way through until an overnight flood leaves him and the troop hanging on a tree limb over a treacherous waterfall, hoping a ranger will rescue them.

27. Rooms for Rent -- Tired of hearing their husbands complain about finances, Wilma and Betty rent rooms to piano and bongo-playing student musicians. Fred and Barney go along with the arrangement, unaware that their wives are providing the lodging in return for music and dancing lessons.

28. Fred Flintstone: Before and After -- Fred agrees to appear in a before-and-after weight reduction commercial, but is humiliated to learn that he is the before example. An offer of $1,000 if he can drop twenty-five pounds in a month fails miserably, as does every other diet plan, until an overeaters group takes him on as a challenge.

The great bonuses include a special on how the show was created -- and the original pilot that sold the show, ""The Flagstones,"" which appears on disk 4 as well; and again, it looks great.
The only complaint is that the 4th disk is a two-sided disk - a bit of a pain, they should have done a 5-disk set.  But it's a small complaint; otherwise, the set is beautifully packaged.  And what a gem, to have this on DVD!  I even skipped on groceries a bit to afford getting it the first week -- at the sale price -- and it was worth every penny.  There is, and never will be, another ""Flintstones"" -- and let's hope Hanna-Barbera and Warner Bros doesn't sit on releasing more seasons; you can hear the ""Yabba-Dabba-Doos"" nationwide at the release of season one alone!",1079481600,26,10652,4.664354322305229
1989444,5,B0001CNQUS,"I don't have cable. Here, on regular TV it seems the Simpsons come on, oh, lets say every other hour. At some point you begin to believe that Matt Groening (creator of the Simpsons), as far as animation is concerned, is 'all'. Somewhere along the way, network TV either lost the rights, or the interest in animation, and therefore, the public has lost touch with the BIG PICTURE.
I grew up watching Hanna Barbera productions, never really realizing how much they did for the art of animation. With all the press Mr. Groening gets you would have thought he would be the one who accomplished what Hanna Barbera did. The Simpsons is great, no question. Futurama, not so great. Now, how about Scooby Doo? Jetsons? Yogi Bear? Huckleberry Hound? The Flinstones? ...And on it goes. These hallmarks of americana came from the hearts and minds of William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, not to mention the other 30-50 or so MAJOR icons I haven't even mentioned. It's almost unbelieveable that two individuals could have come up with so much. It's a lot like the Beatles, but without the recoginiton.
If you have even a question of whether this set is worth the money, erase that thought. The packaging itself is worth the price to me. Besides, the transfers are clean, the sound is worthy and the comedy seems to hold up well. True, comedy has changed since H/B began creating these so long ago. Comedy itself seems to have taken on a more adult edge, even in animation, but maybe that's why these H/B shows are so refreshing. So, kick your shows off, put down the remotes, forget the car bills and the leaky roof and return to a time when comedy wasn't taken so seriously.",1079481600,9,1658,4.623728813559322
1989455,5,B0001CNQUS,"only second to the simpsons, the flinstones is the best animated tv show.
a jewel in animation history. a great plus is the original tracks in english. spanish and french. for mexicans like me this is as best as it gets. it takes me back to the golden age of american shows dubbled in spanish, when the translation were done with real quality.listening to Pedro(Fred)in its original track is pure delight.
best dvd ever.",1079395200,5,420,4.6891891891891895
1989456,5,B0001CNQUS,the show had great balance&Chemistry all the way through. The Flintones appealed because it was very centered on a particular time period&enviroment. Fred&Barney were Cool Home Boys that were Solid. Wilma&Betty both had an edge to them but had a wit about them. Dino will crack you up. I always enjoyed these shows as a Kid&still do.,1079136000,2,333,4.859649122807017
1989457,5,B0001CNQUS,"It took them long enough but they finally did it! I have seen every episode of every season, including the pilot which was released on the Cartoon Network dvd ""Cartoon Crack-Ups"" in 2001 (unfortunately with new voice-overs. I hope this version has the originals). This has to be the best animated tv series of all time and still appeals to kids and adults alike. I Can't wait to see all the extras! Speaking of extras, if anyone from Hanna Barbara is reading this, there was an LP released in the early 60's (pre-Pebbles & Bamm Bamm) entitled, ""Songs of the Flintstones"" by Golden Records which includes all the original cast members. The dialogue and songs (which include ""Rise And Shine"", ""Bowling Alley Blues"") were recorded specifically for this album and did not appear on the show, making this a rarity. This would make an excellent audio-extra or easter egg on a future release of this series.",1079136000,,900,4.7756410256410255

We are extremely excited that this series is going to be released...and hope someday our kids will grow to live it as much as we do.  Unfortunately, Cartoon Network has taken all of its carton classics off the air,placing lots of trendy new garbage in its place. Boomerang is the new classic cartoon network, and Comcast does not carry it in our area. If you miss seeing this classic on tv, email your cable provider and let them know! ...

1989462,1,B0001CNQUS,"Jackie Gleason threatened to sue Hanna-Barbera over this show, and well he should have. So what if it was the first prime-time animated show in history? That doesn't change the fact that it's an uninspired, second-rate rip-off of the Honeymooners. It succeeded then because it was a novelty. Now that we have the Simpsons, who needs the Flintstones? Certianly not me; Warner Bros. needs to offer up some more Looney Tunes or Batman DVD sets instead of this prehistoric dreck.",1076716800,5,475,4.95
1989463,5,B0001CNQUS,"DVDs have been around for a while and have quickly become the most popular format for video.  Without regard to quality, you can be sure that most recent theatrically releases will come out on DVD, but there is no predicting if and when, your favorite classic TV program or cartoon will appear on DVD.  The recent revolution in packaging TV programs in complete seasons or other large collections, has clearly demonstrated that marketing strategy has shifted from attracting the casual viewer, to targeting the dedicated fan willing to spend substantial dollars on a favorite program.
Believing that the fans most willing to buy sets are in a younger demographic, most of the sets released are of programs that are less than ten years old.  Passed by to a great extent, are most of the classic TV programs and cartoons from the 50s to 80s.  Only recently are programs from this era beginning to receive the same treatment on DVD commonly accorded to popular contemporary series like 24.  Finally some truly classic TV programming is making it to DVD!  Hanna Barberas The Flintstones, is a cartoon deserving of royal treatment.  This cartoon modeled on The Honeymooners, ran in prime time, and was aimed at adults.  It featured Fred Flintstone, a middle class working man, dealing with modern issues in a stone age setting.  The cartoon provided a window into suburban American life.  A view that was so clear and familiar, that millions had no problems identifying with what they saw.
The slapstick humor may have drawn in kids, but The Flintstones was a cartoon about married life.  The perspective was not always idyllic, with Fred and Barney often scheming to keep their activities secret from their wives.  While perhaps not always providing a perfect example, the humanity of the characters made them lovable.  At its best moments, The Flintstones had a message.  It not only made you laugh, but think and reflect about life as well.
The 28 episodes in Season One, explore topics and themes that would reoccur in the series.  These include gambling, pop music, get-rich-quick schemes, contests, and crime.  Fred is typically at the center of the action, with his big mouth and brash personality often getting him into outrageous situations.  In one episode, he is singing sensation Hi-Fye, in another hes a stunt double in a movie.  After being conked on the head he becomes the ultra refined and snooty Frederick.  Role reversal is another reoccurring theme, as Fred impersonates a rich tycoon who looks just like him.
The quality and character of the talent providing the voices, contributes massively to the success of the program.  Alan Reed provides the unmistakable voice of Fred Flintstone, and voice over giant Mel Blanc, gives life to Barney Rubble.  Wives Wilma, and Betty are voiced by Jean Vander Pyl and Bea Benaderet (Petticoat Junction) respectively.  Two of the sweetest voices in animation.
The Flintstones is a landmark event in animation.  It is truly wonderful that some of televisions all time classic programs are at last being made available.  If not already, hopefully in time, your favorite program will be too",1076716800,19,3140,4.994230769230769
