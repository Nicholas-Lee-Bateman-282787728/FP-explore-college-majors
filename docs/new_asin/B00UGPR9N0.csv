The 3-disc set will contain 3 re-releases: Ghost Breakers (1940), Road to Morocco (1942), The Paleface (1948). There are more bonus features than most Universal sets as of late, though some may be recycled.
The most ponderous thing here is the fact that they are including exactly one of the Hope/Crosby/Lamour Road movies.

These films are seldom televised since the only two channels that show older movies - Turner Classic Movies and the Fox Movie Channel - do not have ready access to the Universal/Paramount library. That used to be the domain of AMC back when it meant American Movie Classics and not the American Merchandising Channel as it does today.  Thus if you don't already have these films, this set is a welcomed treat.",1269820800,60,1278,4.925581395348837

The only version I could find on DVD for the longest time was the 70s version, which was much grittier and more of a horror.  When I saw this on Amazon I got so excited and ordered it immediately!  I love that there are several other great Bob Hope movies on this collection, and plan to watch them all over and over.

The quality of the movies on the DVD is very good, and the DVD box is like a nice little collector's box set.",1345680000,3,552,3.8157894736842106

This series contains 6 fabulous movies, but we find ourselves watching two over and over again--those are The Ghost Breakers and The Cat and the Canary.  These are two hilariously funny, spooky stories.  Paulette Goddard also stars in both and she and Bob Hope have excellent chemistry together.

This set isn't just for us ""old folks"" either.  My granddaughter, who is 11 is hooked on the two movies I mentioned above.  She has seen them numerous times, and my son-in-law confiscated The Paleface and The Road to Morocco.  A must have set.",1339804800,,605,4.704761904761905

7038436,4,B00UGPR9N0,"While each of the films on this collection are worth watching, I primarily bought it for The Ghost Breakers and the Cat and the Canary. Unlike the Paleface and Road to Morocco (and all the other Road to films with Crosby) Hope plays a romantic lead in the Ghost Breakers in particular and he does a fantastic job. It's still the goofy spot-on timing Bob we love but in a slightly less slapstick manner. I wish he'd made more films where he's a man instead of a punchline, actually. Willie Best plays his assistant and even if the rest of the story doesn't appeal, see it for Best, a highly underappreciated, underused African American actor with timing and deadpan comedic skill equal to Bob Hope at his finest. It's a crime that Best mostly got racial stereotype roles in Hollywood (StepN Fetchit in The Monster Walks with Mischa Auer is a great example. Wasted wasted wasted). He's spectacular.",1313798400,,896,4.677215189873418

7038441,5,B00UGPR9N0,"If anyone ever deserved the moniker of ""Mr. Entertainment"", it was Bob Hope. In his lifetime, he conquered all mediums, flew all over the globe to tirelessly entertain troops, and he was a reliable laughmaker at the box office. It's the latter point which this DVD collection focuses on. ""Thanks for the Memories"" showcases the versatility of Mr. Hope in this handsomely-crafted DVD package. While there are some offerings which have been out on release for some time now, there are also some nice surprises...
DVD newcomer ""Thanks for the Memory"" (1938) re-teams Hope with ""Big Broadcast of 1938"" co-star Shirley Ross as a writer & wife running into domestic problems. A great supporting cast rounds out the film, which closes with Hope & Ross singing the film's title, and what would become Hope's lifelong signature song.
The seldom-seen ""The Cat and the Canary"" (1939) is an old-fashioned scare comedy which has been done before on-screen. The first to pair Hope with the beautiful Paulette Goddard, it casts Hope (who walks the fine line between leading man & wisecracking comic) as a radio star who winds up protecting Goddard as a relative poised to inherit a fortune from her grandfather---provided she can survive the night in his creepy mansion in the Louisiana bayou. Filled with classic cliches--dead bodies, trap doors & secret passages--it still holds up surprisingly well today.
Hope & Goddard return for ""The Ghost Breakers"" (1940), another scare comedy as successful as the previous film (it was later revamped into a Dean Martin-Jerry Lewis vehicle called ""Scared Stiff""). Again, Goddard plays a woman falling heir to a Cuban estate. But this time, it is frought with voodoo & ghosts. Hope plays a news radio personality who mistakenly believes he's shot & killed someone, and stows away on her ship. As with TCATC, great atmospheric chills in this one, and even Willie Best has a plum comic supporting role here.
Another newcomer is ""Nothing But The Truth"" (1941), a delightful situation comedy (a welcome change of pace from the scare comedies) that casts Hope as a stockbroker who foolishly bets his colleagues that he can tell the WHOLE truth for 24 hours. Naturally, things snowball as the truth brings nasty consequences, particularly with the girl of his affections (Goddard).
""Road to Morocco"" (1942) is an all-too familiar Road comedy, but nevertheless, the dandiest of the bunch. Probably the most famous of them all, this is where the series really hit its stride as Hope & Bing Crosby traded insults, shared in-jokes with the audience, camels magically talked, and the boys fought over lovely Dorothy Lamour.
""The Paleface"" (1948) brings us back to more broader, more familiar Hope fare as Bob cuts loose in the Old West. Playing hopeless Easterner dentist ""Painless"" Potter, he unwittingly marries dangerous gunslinger Jane Russell who's using the marriage as a cover to track down a renegade gang. One of Hope's best (alongside the even wilder sequel ""Son of Paleface""), it gives Hope every comic opportunity, from his bumbling skills as a dentist to masquerading as an Indian.
All-in-all, there's something for everyone in this Hope collection!",1296000000,3,3177,5.088122605363985
7038442,4,B00UGPR9N0,"The Bob Hope: Thanks for the Memories Collection is a nice grouping of some of his earlier pictures from 1938 to 1948. They each add a very nice addition to any ones collection of Hope classics, even if several have been released already as either stand alone movies or part of another collection.

All are excellent quality with the exception of ""The Ghost Breakers"", which happens to be one of my favorite early Hope movies.  It's just that the picture quality is horrible.  It's very grainy and so different from the high quality of all the other movies of this Collection.

I happen to own the stand alone version of ""The Ghost Breakers"" as well and it's picture quality is excellent.  Very clear for a film that's 70 years old.  It's hard to understand how Universal, which produced both the Collection reviewed here and the stand alone version of ""The Ghost Breakers"", can have the same film be reproduced so differently.

Overall, this collection rates 5 stars but the fact that ""The Ghost Breakers"" picture quality is so poor takes it down a notch.  I hope it's just my copy but somehow I'm doubtful of that.  I wouldn't shy away from buying this for just that reason, though, especially because it includes ""Thanks For The Memory"", which is somewhat different from what I'm used to from Bob Hope. It's possibly different because it's one of his earliest film and he hasn't yet fallen into the stereotypical Hope role.

This Collection is highly recommended regardless of any flaws in ""The Ghost Breakers"".",1295568000,14,1514,4.766283524904215
7038463,5,B00UGPR9N0,"Bob Hope is probably mostly remembered for entertaining the troops, which he did tirelessly from 1941 on. But that word ""entertaining"" also applies to his movies. Especially these six. Although some Bob Hope films have been available previously on DVD, the packaging has been hopeless. What does one require in a DVD set? Exactly this. Six films, with extras, on three one-sided discs in a three part fold-out, with a slip case for a reasonable price. Universal has gotten it right. This set is great to own or as a gift, or to pass around to various family and friends. But what of the films?

A number of reviewers wanted to see ""The Cat and the Canary"", the 1939 suspense-comedy film (all six are comedies) make it to DVD, but 1940's ""The Ghost Breakers"" is to me an even better film. Like that other Brit, Cary Grant, Bob is the epitome of easy style. He doesn't try too hard to get a joke, and carries his lines off effortlessly. Watching these movies, it's obvious where the ideas came from for later films, and many of these films came from plays.

Not that I always agree with Leonard Maltin (he call's ""Mame"" a bomb, while I think Lucy pulls it off just fine), but I include his comments anyway, as he is one of the few reviewers with any sense for classic films. ""Thanks"" (1938), gets two and a half stars; ""Cat"" two and a half stars; 'Ghost"" three stars. Maltin calls it a ""first-rate film"", noting it was remade as ""Scared Stiff"" in 1953. Willie Best, who plays Hope's valet, is also a master of easy, comic style, and ought to get ""Best Supporting Actor"" in my view; ""Nothing"" (1941), three stars. Maltin notes it was filmed before, in 1920, and is also the ""ancestor"" of ""Liar, Liar"".

""Road"" (1942), three stars. Maltin calls it a ""typically funny Road picture"". Part of the fun of the ""Road"" pictures is that, like cartoons, they were self-referencing, playing off the common elements audiences looked for. This one, in 1942, followed ""Singapore"" and ""Zanzibar""; ""Paleface"" (1948), I was surprised to find, is in color. Three stars, Maltin calls it an ""enjoyable comedy-Western"", noting it was remade as ""The Shakiest Gun in the West"", with a sequel, ""Son of Paleface"". Made for the big screen, this film shows what could be done turning the huge casts and sprawling sets of dramatic film fare to comedy send-up. This film has the playful interaction matinee audiences had come to expect from Hope, which became a staple of the ""Road"" pictures. Everyone now knows about the devil's bargain of the studio system, but as these films show, somehow Hope came out on the side of the angels.",1293321600,,2601,4.65
7038464,4,B00UGPR9N0,"The Bob Hope ""Thanks for the Memories"" collection features six Hope films made in the 1930s and 1940s.  Three of the films, ""Thanks for the Memory"", ""The Cat and the Canary"", and ""Nothing but the Truth"" are making their DVD debuts.  While the six films are not Hope's BEST six films, they all are very good and the set features a nice array of extras.

""Thanks for the Memory"" (1938) is titled after what would soon become Hope's well-known theme song.  He plays novelist Steve Merrick who is struggling to complete his book.  His wife Anne (Shirley Ross) decides to take a job to help pay the bills.  She goes to work for Steve's publisher who also happens to be her former fiance who still has a thing for her and wants to get her out of the house.  This is the weakest film in the set.  It's a romantic comedy that might have been better suited for William Powell and Myrna Loy.  Eddie Anderson, better known as Rochester on the Jack Benny show has a bit part as a janitor.

""The Can and the Canary"" (1939) this was a comedy/horror remake of the 1927 silent film of the same name that virtually invented the `old dark house' genre.  Ten years after his death, the relatives of Cyrus Norman gather at his estate in the Louisiana Bayou for the reading of his well.  These include Hope as Wally Campbell and his frequent co-star Paulette Goddard as Joyce Norman.  The will stipulates that if the heir goes insane or dies in the first thirty days, the estate goes to the next person, whose name remains a mystery, setting up the perfect scenario for murder.  Rounding out the cast is veteran horror film star George Zucco as Norman 's lawyer and Gale Sondergaard as the sinister housekeeper.

This is Hope's first truly great film.  He is at his best with the wisecracks and protecting Joyce (in his cowardly way) when she is named the heir.  The film works equally well as both a comedy and horror.  The old estate is filled with spook-house trappings like painting with the eyes cut out, secret panels, sliding bookcases, etc...It's also a well done mystery as you try to figure out who is trying to kill Joyce.

""The Ghost Breakers"" (1940).  Hope and Goddard are back again but playing different characters.  Goddard is Mary Carter who inherits an old castle on an island off Cuba .  She gets mixed up with Hope who plays crime reporter Lawrence Lawrence who flees Manhattan when he mistakenly thinks he killed a man.  Several menacing men, including a young Anthony Quinn, are trying to convince Mary to sell the castle by telling her the place is haunted and that zombies roam the island.  Lawrence is determined to find out why they are trying to make her give up the place.

Another fine horror/comedy, Ghost Breakers features a scary (for the time) zombie who tries to kill Lawrence .  The only problem with the film is that it's a long set-up.  We don't actually even get to the castle until the last 25 minutes or so of the film.  Willie Best steals almost every scene he is in playing Lawrence 's valet, Alex, in the typical black stereotype role.

""Nothing but the Truth"" (1941)  Once again we've got Hope, Goddard, and Willie Best back for this comedic farce that served as the inspiration for the Jim Carry film, ""Liar, Liar"".  Hope is Steve Bennett, a new partner in an investment firm.  After a discussion about honesty in business, Hope makes a bet with his partners that he can go 24 hours without telling a lie.  He bets the $10,000 given to him by Gwen Saunders (Goddard) who wanted him to invest it to raise more money for a charity.  His partners refuse to let Steve out of their site for the day, throwing every sensitive question at him to try and force him to tell a lie.  Steve does his best to stick to the truth, no matter how much it hurts.  This was Hope and Goddard's last film together.

""The Road to Morocco "" (1942) This was the third in the `road film' series starring Hope, Bing Crosby, and Dorothy Lamour and one of the best.  Jeff Peters (Crosby) and Orville ` Turkey ' Jackson are a couple of castaways who was ashore in Morocco .  Broke, Jeff sells Orville to a rich Arab sheik.  Feeling guilty he tries to find Orville only to find him living in the lap of luxury in the palace of Princess Shalmar (Lamour).  Orville marries the princess but later tries to get out of the marriage when a seer tells him the prophecy that the Princess's first husband will die.  Once again Anthony Quinn is on hand as the villain Mullay Kasim who wants the Princess for his own.

This film featured everything that made the Road pictures so enjoyable...hysterical performances by Hope and Crosby, the beautiful Dorothy Lamour and wonderful songs like ""The Road to Morocco "" which was parodied on an episode of Family Guy.

""The Paleface"" (1948)  This is generally regarded as one of Hope's funniest solo films.  The timing of his one-liners is spot on throughout.  1940s sex symbol Jane Russell plays Calamity Jane, who is released from prison in exchange for her helping the government find out who is selling guns to the Indians.  Hope is ""painless"" Peter Potter, a correspondence school dentist who poses as Jane's husband.  Potter gains a reputation as a gunslinger when he displays some fancy shooting (courtesy of Jane) which gets him into trouble with the outlaws.  The film featured the song ""Buttons and Bows"" sung by Hope which one an Academy Award for best song.

There are a number of short extras in the set including highlights from the Command Performance Radio show that was broadcast over the Armed Forces Radio to troops in World War II.  There's a short, nineteen-minute film called ""Hollywood Victory Caravan"" that features Hope and Crosby helping a young lady get to Washington to see his brother who is on leave.  There's also sing-along, trailers, and photo galleries.

Early Hope films like ""Caught in the Draft"" or ""Never Say Die"" are better than ""Thanks for the Memory"" but all in all it's a great set of Hope comedies.",1286841600,4,5967,4.579245283018868

7038466,5,B00UGPR9N0,These movies are priceless!  We have introduced our 21 year old son to Bob Hope and the idea that comedy can be clean. The next generations are missing out on these classic films.  Would recommend this to anyone.,1282435200,2,212,4.552631578947368
7038467,3,B00UGPR9N0,"The Cat and The Canary gets all 5 stars!  However, I moved it to 3 stars because of the package.

I found The Cat and The Canary on DVD some time ago from a vendor on Amazon, but since, I have noticed that its price has skyrocketed, so for $10 more you can get this set with the other movies. You just have to weigh how much you want the new movies. For instance, you could say that the 3 new movies end up being about $10 each, and the other three are thrown in as a bonus.

The Cat and The Canary was such a delightful surprise for me. I love Bob Hope as the vain and cowardly hero, and I thought I had all those movies until someone on the radio mentioned this one. Here he is pretty much the same wise-guy, wanting to impress the heroine but frightened of his own shadow. He shows up in a creepy house on an island in a swamp with other distant family members, gathered to hear the will of a relative. Then people start dropping like flies, everyone is a suspect, and Hope and the heroine must survive the night in the house. Featuring a menacing housekeeper who served the old master and the requisite hidden wall panels, this is a classic-comedy-in-a-horror film. I suppose I'm naive when it comes to the studio releases, but I can't understand why this hasn't already been mass-released on DVD.

If you don't want to pay $30 for 6 movies, keep the individual ones on your wishlist and visit your account page occasionally to see if any of them have dropped in price.

I guess whether I would spend this amount would depend on how much I want to see Nothing But the Truth. :)",1281916800,2,1581,4.239202657807309
7038468,3,B00UGPR9N0,"The print of The Cat and the Canary is pristine; absolutely beautiful (I would give this film 5 stars). Unfortunately, the other movies in the collection did not get the same restoration treatment. The Ghost Breakers looks awful - full of 'sparkles' and other film artifacts - it has definitely not been restored.. The others vary in quality. I bought this collection for Canary (which has been a favorite for years). But you should be aware of the variation in quality of the different films here.",1277856000,25,498,4.8023255813953485
7038469,5,B00UGPR9N0,"For anyone not familiar with the famous comedian, Bob Hope, this collection of films provides the perfect introduction to his golden period on film. Hope established a character who was part braggart, part coward but very human and likeable. The films fall into 3 categories: the rare ""Thanks for the Memory"", 3 forgotten classics with the vivacious Paulette Goddard and the familiar classics, ""The Road to Morocco"" and ""The Paleface"".

The earliest film in the set is the rare ""Thanks for the Memory"" released in 1938. It teams Hope with charming Shirley Ross, using as its inspiration the song of the same name which was such a smash for the pair earlier in the year in ""The Big Broadcast of 1938"". Hope plays a straight romantic lead as a newlywed writer trying to establish his career while adjusting to his marital status and his wife's role as the major breadwinner. While the film has a fine supporting cast including the famous gossip columnist Hedda Hopper who is very good, the stage bound roots of the verbose script betray the stars and the film is dull entertainment. The highlights are the 2 songs, the superb ""Two Sleepy People"", another huge hit, and a touching reprise of the title song at the climax of the film.

Two of the films with Paulette Goddard, ""Cat and the Canary"" and ""Ghost Breakers"", are spooky thrillers of the ""old dark house"" genre. Both have outstanding supporting casts, beautiful art direction and are very entertaining. These were the films which solidified Hope's film stardom. ""Nothing but the Truth"" is a more conventional but hilarious comedy about a man who agrees not to tell a lie for a day on a bet. In this role, Hope plays a ""Cary Grant type"" of leading man. These films were impeccably produced by Arthur Hornblow with top class sets, directions and costumes. Goddard looks gorgeous too.

Of the familiar classics, ""The Road to Morocco"" is the 3rd of the famous Road pictures when Hope teamed with Bing Crosby on a zany adventure to an exotic location, usually sending up a familiar film genre along the way and vying for the glamorous heroine, the deadpan and droll Dorothy Lamour. This one sends up desert epics and is full of topical gags and one liners as usual. The major delight of the Road pictures is the smooth rapport with Crosby who is galvanized out of his normal inertia. They are a justly celebrated team.

The final film is ""The Paleface"".  Hope plays a dentist out west and this famous comedy co-stars the deadpan Jane Russell in the film which secured her stardom. It is an hilarious farce.

Most of the films are presented in excellent prints, ""The Paleface"" in glorious technicolour. Only ""Ghost Breakers"" shows evidence of dirt and popping and obviously has not been restored. There is an unusually generous set of extras, something not common to similar star sets from the Paramount vault. All theatrical trailers are included and there are some on-set and marketing stills for some of the films. ""Morocco"" contains a neat documentary on the evolution of the Road pictures. The rest of the extras focus on Hope's efforts with war time entertainment of the troops. ""Paleface"" and ""Ghost"" contain excerpts of Hope from filmed episodes of ""Command Performance"", a wartime weekly radio show performed by stars in Hollywood specifically for the troops. ""Ghost"" also contains a short documentary on Hope's involvement with the USO and a wartime short film promoting Hollywood's Victory Caravan, a large scale war bond drive. The short contains 3 musical numbers from Betty Hutton (OK), pianist Carmen Cavallaro(excellent) and Bing Crosby (dreadful).

Hope was also a competent singer and associated with a few very famous songs such as ""Buttons and Bows"" from ""The Paleface"".  The DVDs contain sing-a-longs for these songs and they add to the amusing genial nature of the set which is good value.",1277596800,12,3860,4.891437308868501
7038470,5,B00UGPR9N0,"This Bob Hope set, rightly knocked by so many reviewers for including a plethora of duplicate issues, would have been much better off as a simple Hope/Goddard box set of their three movies, with the slightly better known ""Ghostbreakers"", already available on DVD, rounding off ""The Cat and the Canary"" and ""Nothing but the Truth"". A special presentation and notes and extras would have been nice.

Although a set filled with endless duplicates - such as here - remains a really lousy way to offer previously unavailable films, it could be far worse. At least we get one good to very good Hope film new to DVD - ""The Cat and the Canary"" - and one of Hope's greatest - meaning funniest - films, ""Nothing But the Truth"". So 28 dollars isn't too bad, particularly when buyers are forced to pony up 20 to 25 dollars - plus shipping - for films in the WarnerArchive sets.(""The Mortal Storm"",<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mortal-Storm/dp/B003552QWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mortal Storm</a>, is certainly a wonderful film, and worth the full price, but you can find a nicely restored DVD of the same leading couple, Stewart and Sullivan, in ""The Shop Around the Corner"" for less than half Warner's 'special offering' price for the tragedy, and on a real DVD issue!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shop-Around-the-Corner/dp/B00006FDCV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shop Around the Corner</a>&nbsp;The full price Warner Archives aren't even real DVDs, but rather what Warner's call 'Mod' discs.

At least this Bob Hope issue under review is for legitmate DVDs, even if the producers cram way too much material in per side. And for your 28 dollars you receive a heck of a lot more than, say, 62 minutes, as is the case with my WarnerArchive issue of Garbo in ""The Kiss""!!!

Among the movies new to DVD, the musical does little for me. And while I enjoy Goddard and Hope's first film together, ""The Cat and the Canary"", a classic haunted house story updated as a comedic vehicle for Hope, the unquestioned star of this set is the first DVD release of the riotous, ""Nothing But the Truth"". Derived from the oft-produced and adapted 1916 play by James Montgomery from Frederick Stewart Isham's novel of the same name, this film captures the young Hope at his absolute zaniest. For good reviews of the plot and quality of this terrific movie - including one review by me - see the Amazon reviews under the Video issue. (The ASIN number is 0783214456 - but Amazon won't give an internal link so you'll have to search a bit.) This great Hope movie EASILY deserves FIVE STARS - and is the reason I give this hodge-podge offering the highest rating. If ""Nothing But the Truth"" was issued by Criterion you'd gladly pay 30 dollars, and you'd think it well worth it! Best of all, this is a film you can pull out and watch again - unless of course you can't stand Bob Hope, but then if that was the case, you wouldn't be here!",1277251200,5,2996,5.0120481927710845
7038471,5,B00UGPR9N0,"Two years ago my father and I sat down to watch The Cat and the Canary and he started saying the lines with Bob Hope, so I asked him when he last saw this movie. He replied, ""I saw it once when it first came out, I was eleven years old.""
The lines in The Cat and the Canary are exactly that memorable - it's a great movie.",1273536000,35,322,3.75

But I hate this habit these DVD sets have of putting one decent unreleased film in a set with a lot of repeats and filler. The Paleface? Road to morocco for the 11th trillion time? Hell, why didn't they include 'I'll take Sweden'?",1270512000,19,389,4.1866666666666665
