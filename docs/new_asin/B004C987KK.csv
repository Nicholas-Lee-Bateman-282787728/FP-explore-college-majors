There are Man-only and Lady-only sections for each step. The instructor drones the count over and over until you hear it in your sleep. The only fault I see in this series is that I want to see the couple put everything together and dance for me to watch.  (I'm only part of the way through the lessons. The DVD always returns you to where it was last viewed and I recall that there WAS a comprehensive dance sequence at the very beginning of the DVD. Maybe there is another one for me if I finish?)

Since I wrote my preliminary review, I have discovered that my father reviews this particular set of instructional DVDs in my absence. (I bought the 2-disk set -- which is pricy -- because I knew that my father would ask for more steps once he had mastered what is offered by the simple Shawn Trautman and Vicki Regan products.)  This particular set of tango instruction disks is not for the absolute beginner -- unless you can follow instructions carefully. The steps are more like a refresher course. For my needs, Slow Dancers offers the must-have set of instructional dance DVDs to own.  I bought several of their instructional products -- all in 2-disk packages -- so that there could be some variety on the ballroom floor when I dance.

I think that the ""big basket"" package -- which contains several diverse dance instruction DVDs -- would make a great wedding gift!",1358294400,,1501,4.666666666666667
8422862,3,B004C987KK,this couple presents a good number of tango steps which are very impressive. the only drawback is that they only gave detailed step by step instruction to a couple of dance sequences.  other steps were only demonstrated but did not break down into men's and ladies footwork .  i would only recommend this video to those who already have a foundation in American style tango or those who already took actual basic ballroom classes in tango.,1317340800,,439,4.7631578947368425
