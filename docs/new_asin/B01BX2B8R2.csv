7670134,3,B01BX2B8R2,"This six part drama started off very well.  The settings and costumes are gorgeous plus the Victorian time period is very compelling as they straddle old ways with the rapidly approaching 20th Century.  Its very well acted with Collin Morgan doing a fine job as Nathan Appleby who's return to his childhood home after his mother's death.  That said, the plot gets increasing disjointed and scattered as the series progresses to the point in the last two episodes its almost laughable ridiculous.  The worst part is that why these happenings are occurring on this Somerset farm to this family over the generations, plus the various townsfolk and farm hands is NEVER fully explained.  I enjoyed it, but given the plot holes I'm glad I saw it for free on BBC America.",1477785600,6,764,4.801526717557252
7670135,5,B01BX2B8R2,"This first season was fantastic!  Well written, perfect cast of excellent actors, and a gripping story that will keep you guessing until the end.  The cinematography is beautiful and becomes a character of the show in and of itself.  The soundtrack fits perfectly.  If you enjoy supernatural TV shows, you'll enjoy this!",1470787200,9,320,5.096153846153846

7670137,4,B01BX2B8R2,"I found this series strong in some respects and weak in others. It involves ghosts and hauntings back in the 1890s in England. It is genuinely scary in parts plus the creators have followed all period details so that you feel you are there. They have also used great effects for when a ghost makes an appearance. This is what enhances the scare factor.

On the weak end though, there are too many ghosts in this story. I don't see why so many were needed. This made the tale increasingly murky. By the end of it, I no longer knew where I was narratively.

There is another BBC ghost story, THE WOMAN IN BLACK, which is not only scary but you are acutely aware at every moment of what is going on. There is only one ghost but no others are needed. She is plenty. I could barely sleep after watching that one it had scared me so thoroughly.

By contrast, with this one I just felt frustrated at the end. There were so many fine aspects to this product that I was perplexed as to why the story had been so needlessly convoluted.

The basic plot is that a couple moves back to his ancestral home. There is plenty of superstition in this place because bad things have happened there. This couple seems to push the occult there into overdrive. There is one ghost story after another affecting the farmers who work for the couple. Alongside those hauntings is the husband's obsession with a male child of his who drowned there. He becomes more and more obsessed about this. The child begins appearing to first his father's new wife and eventually to the father. He even appears to future generations of this family!

The series has a lot going for it. The acting is very good along with the setting and era. But I for one could have used a simpler narrative arc to the storyline.",1468108800,7,1772,4.4067278287461775

7670154,5,B01BX2B8R2,"Amazing!  I knew Colin Morgan was a good actor from watching Merlin, but I had no idea he was this amazingly brilliant!!  The characters are likeable and the story is believable and scary, but not in the blood and guts way.  It is purely a psychological thriller and it will have you thinking about it for days after you watch it.",1488672000,,330,4.377049180327869

7670156,5,B01BX2B8R2,"Wonderfully eerie show.  Colin Morgan is always a pleasure to watch.  Considering the title of the show, I was worried it was going to be another Walking Dead - all gruesome effects and stupid plots.  But this was a real gem.  A real old fashioned ghost story, where the tension and fear builds.  The characters are well defined, the main characters likable.  I also was pleased that the local vicar wasn't the usual pretender that you see in so many scary films.  He's actually a good man who believes in what he preaches.  All in all, a wonderful series.  I strongly recommend it to anyone disappointed by what passes for  modern horror.",1486252800,2,639,4.625

7670158,1,B01BX2B8R2,"Not intense, not scary, there needed to be more explanation in some parts and the ending did not make sense, there is no way the people in the past could have found what they did in the bog. It doesn't make sense. The theme song is terrible, the guy can't sing. It's not worth the time you would spend watching it.",1486166400,,314,4.163934426229508
7670169,5,B01BX2B8R2,"I am so upset this series was cancelled after a single season, but trying to figure out what the BBC thinks will do your head in every time!

Anyway, if you like creepy ghost stories and mysteries, this will do it for you. And Colin is very, very cute. Worth the time for the dreamy Eye Candy....",1486080000,,296,4.192982456140351
7670170,5,B01BX2B8R2,"Although there was an uneccessary tacked-on scene at the end, my husband & I found this tv series to be absolutely compelling.
It occurs in the 1890s in Somerset, England. The village had been viciously attacked by Cromwell's soldiers so that violence resonated through the centuries.
The main characters are a much-in-love husband & wife. He is a psychologist, she is a photographer. They leave London to take over the family farm. They interact with the villagers. Many fascinating characters fill this series.
There is a young woman, seemingly possessed, who the husband treats. He ends up having her baptised, which frees her.
But due to some bad, selfish deeds by his ancestors (the Applebee family) the village is haunted by young boys.
There are numerous paranormal events in this series, along with fascinating character studies.
The cinematography is as gorgeous as Terrence Malick's beautiful work. The acting is brilliant.
I won't give any spoilers but I will say that (aside from that tacked-on ending) the series is complete, rich, full & wonderful.",1485129600,,1062,5.144508670520231
7670171,4,B01BX2B8R2,It was well written and acted.  The scenes were suspenseful and kept my interest.  The show was about a man trying to cope with the loss of his mother and child.  He (was a well-renowned psychiatrist) and his wife moved from London to his hometown.  Strange things began happening and he thought he was losing his mind.  He slowly was able to find closer and deal with his losses.,1485043200,,380,4.449275362318841

7670173,5,B01BX2B8R2,"The Living And The Dead is a gorgeous, jumbled ghost story. It is basically a supernatural drama series about a farmer who yearns to prove the existence of the afterlife.
Worth the watch!
Tensely eerie and classic made, The Living and the Dead has potential to become a running franchise.
A clever, emotionally-charged ghost stories best ingested in the company of those like-minded looking for a fright by the television screen's flicker.",1481760000,3,439,5.111111111111111
7670174,4,B01BX2B8R2,"In the summer of 1894, Nathan Appleby's mother dies and he inherits Shepzoy House and farm in Somerset. Nathan's 1st idea is to sell the farm. He has a successful London career in the flowering science of psychology. His wife, Charlotte, is a thoroughly modern city girl who is interested in the possibilities of the new cameras. But Charlotte wants to take on the challenge of modernizing the farm and starting a family in the country. She wins, and six weeks later they move in.

And that's when the troubles begin. Each episode has a new supernatural horror to be dealt with. And the current running underneath all the episodes is Nathan's guilt over the death of his 6 year-old son by his first wife. They both died at Shepzoy and something is very very wrong with this farm. Not just ghosts and possessions, but madness and something that shouldn't be there.
No spoilers! ""What lies beneath should be left beneath.""

""The Living and the Dead"" originally aired June-August 2016. The six episodes total 360 minutes. The BluRay/DVD of the series have the option of English SDH subtitles on the episodes and the Bonus Features. BBC has announced that no series 2 will be optioned.

I am not a horror aficionado, so this TV series has the right amount of creepiness for me. Most of the acting is good, and some of the supporting cast are very good. The pacing can be a little slow. The cinematography is exceptional for a TV series, especially the overhead shots in the woods. Last, but not least, I much enjoy the music, including the songs sung during the opening credits. The mournful and even sinister ballads lend to the creepy atmosphere. Episode Two, dealing with young Charlie and the boys calling to him, is particularly well written.

Bonus Features:
....A.  ""The Making of The Living the Dead"" (5 minutes) Commentators include Colin Morgan (plays Nathan), Charlotte Spencer (plays Charlotte), Ashley Pharoah (writer, producer), Sam Donovan (director), Matt Gray (DOP), Alice Troughton (director), Phoebe De Gaye (costume designer), Vickie Lang (hair & makeup), Malcolm Storry (plays Gideon) and Kerrie Hayes (plays Gwen).
Colin Morgan says, ""We've had cameras on 100 foot cables, shooting through gullies for action, high-impact shots.... I think it gives it a real scale and cinematic quality.""
....B.  ""Shepzoy"" (6 minutes) Commentators include Ashley Pharoah, Nicholas Woodeson (plays Rev. Denning), Dee Gregson (location manager), Colin Morgan, Pat Campbell (production designer), Malcolm Storry, Charlotte Spencer, Tim Barker (sound), Talullah Rose Haddon (plays Harriet), Kerrie Hayes and John Collin (National Trust).
Horton Court, standing in for Shepzoy House, is supposedly haunted. Ashley Pharoah describes filming the ""ouija board scene. As soon as Colin started saying the lines from the script, you know, 'Is there anybody here?', papers flung off the desk.""
....C.  ""Behind the Scenes"" (9 minutes) Commentators include Ashley Pharoah, Charlotte Spencer, Colin Morgan, Malcom Storry and Kerrie Hayes. Pharoah says, ""The way I sold it to BBC was 'Thomas Hardy with Ghosts'. ""

Trivia:  Horton Court, a National Trust holding in Gloucester, stood in for Nathan and Charlotte's Shepzoy House. It has been owned by many different families. Records aren't clear, but the hall is Norman and believed to have been built around 1150. Horton Court was also used as a location in the series ""Wolf Hall"". As it is currently empty and not open to the public, a film company can do a lot with the interiors to make it look different for each series. See if you can catch the carving over the front door, especially the two sorry-looking mermaids.
Trivia Two: I was fascinated by the traction engine shown. It seemed rather cumbersome to me and not much faster than a horse-drawn plow. However, according to wikipedia, the traction engine ""revolutionized agriculture"" and  ""became popular in industrialized countries from around 1850."" This means that Shepzoy House in 1894 really was behind the times.

7670175,1,B01BX2B8R2,"Because I am half British I love old British movies. I thought this would be an awesome ghost story in the English countryside which I would love. Instead within the first few minutes I realized it was a dark evil movie and very upsetting. I was very upset because I buy many British movies and love them all. This was dark and foreboding and it showed a man spirit, evil get into the body of a young girl and she spoke in his voice. that upset me a lot. I love suspense and ghost stories. I am a Christian and not into evil. I would love to send this movie back. I am not going to watch it and it wasted my money. I spend a fortune on Amazon and on British BBC movies and some other movies. I am very unhappy about  this whole experience. I do not do evil. If you do not want a dark evil movie you will not like this, Carol Howard I finally watched this movie. I love it. I am very uspet because it has 3 more episodes that this does not have. why Is that? I want to see the other 3 episodes. I am now hooked on this fabulous British show. Why does this DVD not contain Episodes 4 through 6 on other countries DVDs? very very upset with this.

8751790,3,B01BX2B8R2,"We watched this on Amazon Prime. The story has some high and some low points, hence 3 stars. The cinematography is wonderful with many engaging and atmospheric shots of the late 19th century English countryside. The acting is also wonderful, nuanced and moving. There are several themes which the writer and director play with: science vs superstition, modernity vs traditionalism, public propriety and private wantonness, and rationalism vs emotionalism. But at bottom this is series of ghost stories with every imaginable trope and cliche the genre ever put into a movie: ghosts in the mirror, writing on the wall, unexplained mischief, sightings of the dead among the living, amulets tied on a wishing tree, the soul tortured by guilt and remorse, and the descent of various characters into madness. If the writers had left this in the 19th century and brought about some kind of closure among the main story lines, it would have been a much better production. But they decided to wander off into the truly absurd and crossed genre lines into sci-fi or fantasy with the grand finale which made the entire experience seem like a waste of time. The very last scene was an obvious hook for a second season but the BBC decided, and I think rightly so, that one round was enough.",1507420800,,1277,4.862385321100917
