3003211,5,B000XJD30M,"As I get older, these veteran actors are appreciated more to me. I laughed, and that is no small thing to me. Thanks for the laughs.",1394755200,,132,4.115384615384615
3003212,4,B000XJD30M,"It is a cute comedy, with good laughter. The real reason I bought it was that I was an extra in the movie.",1376697600,,106,3.652173913043478
3003213,5,B000XJD30M,"i love the movie,a old movie but good movie .i will tell people about this movie,was very hard to find",1361664000,,102,4.15
3003214,1,B000XJD30M,"More of a diatribe than a review: ""The Final Hit"", ""The Maddening"" & ""Big City Blues""..I thought these were Reynolds' 3 bottom of the barrel performances...but after seeing ""Forget About it"", this is the sludge that burned through the bottom of the barrel... It makes Reynolds' Studio Bombs from the mid to late 80's look like masterpieces.. The only thing missing from this horribly cliched corn dog movie was the stick (pardon the Reynolds movie title pun). A script & story so lousy that you'd expect to see it in some unknown or forgotten movie while flipping through channels at 2 am or on a weekend afternoon. The production value was incredibly poor (even when filmed outside).. and the acting isn't good enough to be considered interesting or campy - it's just annoyingly bad. I'm embarrassed for everyone associated with this project... everyone should just retire and just go far away.... The single good thing about ""Forget About it"" was the last 1 second of the end credits.. because it was finally over....",1328313600,5,1019,4.895953757225434
3003215,3,B000XJD30M,"Ok, this isn't the greatest movie ever made.  It isn't the worst movie ever made. Somewhere in the middle is ""Forget About It"".  I am biased, as some of the film was shot at the airport where I worked (except for the terminal and airline the movie was shot at Mesa Falcon Field).
The plot line is thin, the acting would do a ham proud, but it is entertaining and funny.  Odd part is that a couple of swear words were edited out, but there is a scene in a ""adult"" bar that wasn't.  So not for young children.
Have some popcorn, a soda and enjoy the movie",1279152000,6,553,4.092592592592593
3003216,1,B000XJD30M,"Yes, this is a sweet film. And yes, the folks associated with this movie have done other fine work...but this is one of the most amateurish films you will ever view. It features poor production values, wooden acting, and a stilted script. A better film would be a documentary about how and why this film was ever made. See ""My Blue Heaven"" or ""Married to the Mob"" or ""The Whole Nine Yards"" for goodness sake...but please pass on this one and preserve your memories of what a great actor Charles Durning can be.",1201737600,,510,4.494623655913978
3003217,5,B000XJD30M,"I am not a critic and all I have is my opinion.  I thought this movie was very excellent.  It seems when Burt and Raquel get together something special happens.  And with 4 other stars of equal caliber to enhance Burt and Raquel's performance, nothing but fun, laughter and the shennanigans of three retired kids makes this movie great.  While this movie is funny it is skillfully put together to make a good story. I will enjoy watching it over and over.",1199577600,13,455,4.512195121951219

3003239,3,B000XJD30M,"I bought this only because my girlfriend was a background actress when this was filmed.  (But she was lost to the cutting room floor.)  But because of her, I know this had originally had what I believe was a more interesting plot.  The producers had completely scrapped it after filming because they felt it was a flop, but later revived it.  I like that this version has several surprise twists I hadn't seen coming.  However, it's not clear to me what the heck happened in the end.  Seems like they skipped something.",1485043200,,519,4.586956521739131
3003240,3,B000XJD30M,"Hilarious farce as advertised.  Especially farcical was the presentation of the Freaky Burro of Instigation as a ""law"" enFARCEment agency with a pair of YGBK hetero agents.  Same FBI that slaughtered 76 American citizens in cold blood at Waco Texas for refusing to allow their children to be sent to be homosexually regimented in the local schools in conformance with J. Edgar's known homosexual orientation.  Same FBI that prosecutes individuals who steal from banks while refusing even to take information when one of the organized crime felonious bunkos uses instrumentalities of interstate commerce to steal from individual humans.  Meanwhile the ""Italian Mafia"" is presented as a group of independent individuals as distinct from the real organized crime Wholly Roman Umpire engaged in felony tax evasion, slave mongering, hate mongering against male citizens, war mongering for purposes of ""sacrificing"" yet more males in foreign wars created for the purpose, male baby raping, belligerent blaspheming gang euphemizing itself as ""religion"".

him. I would have liked to see a few more scenes with him inter-reacting with the village retirees and their prosaic lives. The two amorous FBI agents were a bit much and all their scenes could have been left on the cutting room floor. Not a great movie, but OK. I would suggest 'The Crew' (with Burt Reynolds again part of an ensemble cast) and Steve Martin's 'My Blue Heaven' are both much better movies in this genre. Even 'The Boynton Beach Club' (though a stretch, but about retirees) can be considered.",1475193600,,665,4.459016393442623

3003307,1,B000XJD30M,"A mistake on my part. It was late at night, I was alone, as usual - I don't drink, I don't do drugs - I can't blame impairment - I was probably fooled by the cast listing - names from my youth - Burt Reynolds, Raquel Welch - I chose this amateur level production hoping for, maybe, a boost of nostalgia endorphins. I have to admit, I only got a quarter of the way through when I gave up on this utterly insipid and pointless assemblage of random electrons hoping to become a production. I wasn't expecting anything grand or virtuous - I was hoping for grace - perhaps a throw-back to the days where a small film could bring a small delight - even if in a narrow view. However, no grace, no elegance - or even pride.
I do feel sorry for Burt Reynolds. I know he must feel embarrassed and small for having to resort to these types of staged engagements of drech. it is no secret he needs the money - and he is trying to pay the bills as honorably as he can. Someone should offer him roles that are befitting of his standing and abilities. Burt Reynolds has always been an underrated and underutilized actor. It is a true shame that he has come to this late stage in his life being unfulfilled.",1473465600,,1191,4.205240174672489

3003551,3,B000XJD30M,"I really wanted to love this movie, and it looked so promising on the surface.  Unfortunately, when you take a top-notch cast like this one and force them to deliver poorly written dialogue, then provide editing with all of the polish of a high school AV club project, the final product isn't what you would expect from a project with this kind of (albeit aging) star power.  It plays out like a lackluster after-school special from 1985.

Add a storyline that's a haphazard patchwork quilt of other plots that have been done to death, hold them together with bubble gum instead of thread, and you get this movie.  Things just don't flow smoothly.  It has it's moments, and it's not the worst thing in the world, but I can't say that I'd recommend it to a friend or consider watching it again.  It's just sad to see something so average come from a cast with so much talent and experience.

My favorite example of the bad dialogue, though you really have to see it in the movie to fully appreciate how awkward it sounds:

Becky:  ""I am close to 18.  I don't have to listen to anyone.""

Sam:  ""Close only counts with horseshoes and hand grenades. Besides, you ain't 18 yet.""  (redundant much?)

Becky  ""Close enough. (rides off on her bike) Get a life!""

There are many other examples, but that one is permenantly stuck in my head.",1412899200,2,1330,4.525210084033613

It makes Reynolds' Studio Bombs from the mid to late 80's look like masterpieces.. The only thing missing from this horribly cliched corn dog movie was the stick (pardon the Reynolds movie title pun). A script & story so lousy that you'd expect to see it in some unknown or forgotten movie while flipping through channels at 2 am or on a weekend afternoon. The production value was incredibly poor (even when filmed outside).. and the acting isn't good enough to be considered interesting or campy - it's just annoyingly bad.

The plot line is thin, the acting would do a ham proud, but it is entertaining and funny.  Odd part is that a couple of swear words were edited out, but there is a scene in a ""adult"" bar that wasn't.  So not for young children.

him. I would have liked to see a few more scenes with him inter-reacting with the village retirees and their prosaic lives. The two amorous FBI agents were a bit much and all their scenes could have been left on the cutting room floor. Not a great movie, but OK. I would suggest 'The Crew' (with Burt Reynolds again part of an ensemble cast) and Steve Martin's 'My Blue Heaven' are both much better movies in this genre. Even 'The Boynton Beach Club' (though a stretch, but about retirees) can be considered.",1475193600,,665,4.459016393442623

It was late at night, I was alone, as usual - I don't drink, I don't do drugs - I can't blame impairment - I was probably fooled by the cast listing - names from my youth - Burt Reynolds, Raquel Welch - I chose this amateur level production hoping for, maybe, a boost of nostalgia endorphins. I have to admit, I only got a quarter of the way through when I gave up on this utterly insipid and pointless assemblage of random electrons hoping to become a production. I wasn't expecting anything grand or virtuous - I was hoping for grace - perhaps a throw-back to the days where a small film could bring a small delight - even if in a narrow view. However, no grace, no elegance - or even pride.
I do feel sorry for Burt Reynolds. I know he must feel embarrassed and small for having to resort to these types of staged engagements of drech. it is no secret he needs the money - and he is trying to pay the bills as honorably as he can. Someone should offer him roles that are befitting of his standing and abilities. Burt Reynolds has always been an underrated and underutilized actor.

Unfortunately, when you take a top-notch cast like this one and force them to deliver poorly written dialogue, then provide editing with all of the polish of a high school AV club project, the final product isn't what you would expect from a project with this kind of (albeit aging) star power.  It plays out like a lackluster after-school special from 1985.

Add a storyline that's a haphazard patchwork quilt of other plots that have been done to death, hold them together with bubble gum instead of thread, and you get this movie.  Things just don't flow smoothly.  It has it's moments, and it's not the worst thing in the world, but I can't say that I'd recommend it to a friend or consider watching it again.  It's just sad to see something so average come from a cast with so much talent and experience.

My favorite example of the bad dialogue, though you really have to see it in the movie to fully appreciate how awkward it sounds:

Becky:  ""I am close to 18.  I don't have to listen to anyone.""

Sam:  ""Close only counts with horseshoes and hand grenades. Besides, you ain't 18 yet.""  (redundant much?)

Becky  ""Close enough. (rides off on her bike) Get a life!""

There are many other examples, but that one is permenantly stuck in my head.",1412899200,2,1330,4.525210084033613
