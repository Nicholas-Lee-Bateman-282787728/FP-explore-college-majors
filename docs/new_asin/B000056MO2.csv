1399449,3,B000056MO2,"I bought this video because I've lusted in my heart to a dancer's body.  You know the type, perfectly symmetrical, long lean muscles, perfect stature and not an ounce of fat.  So, I buy this even though my dance background consist of Saturday night gyrations after too many vodka tonics.  I really wanted to love this video, it has a great look, great music and gorgeous dancers!  But, without any ballet experience I was lost.  I'll probably continue to try and plow through-just for the sake of my own ego.",990403200,7,508,4.6
1399450,1,B000056MO2,"I bought the book of this workout and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I was hoping there was a video and am happy to see there is.  I read some of the reviews and it was indicated that the workouts weren't explained well or not at all on the video.  Buy the book!  It explains the positions and, of course, has pictures.  There are tips for each workout.  I am hoping the the video and book will compliment each other.  I've only given it one star because I am just ordering it now.  I thought I give a tip.",990144000,5,499,4.072164948453608
1399451,5,B000056MO2,"I love this video! As a former professional dancer, this is one workout video that works for me. If you like pilates...this would work for you.",989280000,3,143,4.538461538461538
1399452,4,B000056MO2,"After experiencing a serious exercise burnout in the last year, I began looking for workouts to supplement my usual step aerobics/weight training regimen. I added yoga several months ago, and then a friend mentioned the NYC Ballet Workout book. Since I'm not one for exercising out of a book, discovering that a video would soon be released was very exciting. I have not been disappointed.
I have never studied ballet formally, but was familiar with the five basic positions and many of the other common ballet exercises. As a result, I fell in step quite easily and was able to concern myself more with proper form than might otherwise have been the case. The three warm-up segments had me laughing at my own clumsiness the first time around, but were much easier the second time I did the tape.
This workout won't be especially difficult for anyone who's either studied ballet or is in fairly good shape. I found certain things challenging (like holding the arms in second position for the whole of the tendu segment), but overall, I think this tape is aimed more at helping the viewer develop flexibility and strength without taxing the cardiovascular system to any great degree. I have found that I can do this tape at 9:00 in the evening and fall easily asleep at 10:45. You will be perspiring but have an overall feeling of tranquility at the end.
Even though I love this tape, I gave it only four stars because of what I perceive to be some minor problems. There is one bad edit in the stretching segment that threw me off at first. Peter Martins's cueing leaves a bit to be desired, and his instructions of ""right"" and ""left"" are from the dancers' point of view -- not from the perspective of the person following along. (I'm used to simply mirroring the people in workout videos and disregarding the narrator, so this is not a problem for me -- but could be confusing for others not experienced in doing that.) And finally, the dancers aren't always shown full-length, which makes it harder to know what the parts of their bodies that aren't being shown are doing at that particular moment.
But, as I say, these are minor matters in an otherwise terrific video. They certainly do not keep me from recommending the New York City Ballet Workout!",987552000,320,2252,4.675062972292191
1399453,4,B000056MO2,"This is a wonderful workout--I've taken years of ballet and I was exhausted by the time I finished!  I'd rate it, however, between 3 and 4 stars for two reasons--first, the narration doesn't keep up with the actual video so if you are doing a movement that requires looking away from the screen, you miss what the dancers are doing.  Second, for someone who has taken ballet, it might be a bit repetitive or boring in parts.
Despite those nitpicks, I was very impressed with the scope of the video.  Every muscle group gets worked.  I felt taller, thinner and more graceful after the workout and look forward to recapturing my ballet body!",987465600,10,639,4.628318584070796
1399454,4,B000056MO2,"The New York City Ballet workout is the best ballet tape I have seen. Elegantly narrated by Ballet Master Peter Martins, this video takes you through a challenging, and thorough warm up and stretching routine. Seeing the elgant line of a dancers body, and their truly amazing flexibility and muscle tone is inspiring. The workout is shot on feature quality film, with feature quality sound, not the grainy video and off sync sound we normally find in workout videos.
The soundtrack is classical, although with the DVD version, you can listen to something more upbeat and contemporary, and you can see every move from several different angles, demonstrated by male and femal dancers. The ab exercises are really challenging, I could barely get through them, but you keep going. Maybe it's because there is no overly perky barbie doll making veiled attemps at encouraging you. I did not find the moves to be hard to follow, but as with any artform, practice makes perfect, and if you want to perfect your technique, then you should do the video regularly. Just take your time, and listen to the music, and enjoy yourself.
All in all, this video makes you work hard, and looks like an actual ballet production. I highly recommend it.",986342400,98,1230,4.834123222748815
1399455,5,B000056MO2,"I LOVED this workout. It's beautiful to watch, the music is lovely and the workout is quite easy to follow.(I haven't taken a ballet class since I was in second grade.) The Editorial Review really describes the tape perfectly. I highly recommend The New York City Ballet Workout.",986169600,15,279,4.833333333333333
1399456,3,B000056MO2,"i very much enjoyed watching this beautfully shot and choreographed video, but as an exercise tape, it is sorely lacking.  It assumes that the audience has a background in dance (ballet in particular) and does not demonstrate any of the moves and uses alot of technical words.  my problems:
1.  there is not alot of instruction- you watch and imitate which can be dangerous if you do not how the technique involved. alot of the shots are framed that you are unable to see quite clearly what you are supposed to be doing
2.  it focuses on leg and abd exercises and emphasizes the long lean physique- not at all realistic fo the average viewer
3.  the exercises are done to classical music, which while soothing, is not the upbeat tempo most would prefer during their workouts.
All in all, i enjoyed watching the exercises and the end features a biography of the 4 dancers which was interesting. i certainly appreciate the soothing quality and beatiful arrangement.
 for a workout video, i think that fellow dancers would appreciate this but the average user should probably pass. the exercises are too specialized.",1054512000,26,1113,4.801047120418848
1399457,5,B000056MO2,"I used to take dance lessons for years, but it's been almost two years since I stopped. This seemed like the perfect video to help me get back in shape. It's wonderful! It goes at a slow pace which makes it both relaxing and more difficult at the same time. It tends to focus more on the lower body, but I've found that by the end my arms are killing me from holding them in position. The dancers are, of course, in perfect shape, which can be a little intimidating (nothing like seeing a ballerina twisted like a pretzel while I can barely do the move!), but with the classical music and quiet tone, it's very relaxing and refreshing. If you're not familiar with ballet terms it will probably take a few times to get the hang of it, but it goes at a slow enough pace that it won't confuse you too much. I'm definitely going to recommend this to my friends back at the dance studio!",1048723200,6,882,4.255952380952381
1399458,5,B000056MO2,i am a dancer.  and i know how these excercises affect my body if done right because i have been doing ones similar if not identical to them for the past 14 years.  dance is a passion and great for your body.  when i became more busy with school and work i wasn't able to take as many classes as i would have liked or was used to.  my body changed as i became less active and running was a great excercise for me but still something was missing...conditioning.  so i got the New York City Ballet Workout tape and i loved it.  I also think it is practical for people who don't dance to even enjoy.  It has improved my tecnique immensly and i would reccomend it to any one out there who is looking to improve their body image.,1046390400,2,724,4.092198581560283
1399459,5,B000056MO2,"This video is wonderful! You do not need to know anything about ballet to do it. It takes a little time to catch on, but not more than any video. Once you get the warm-ups down the rest is easy. The second half of this video is MUCH more challenging. I usually only do the firs half, but it has a perfect place to stop right in the middle. So in a half an hour, I feel wonderfly stretched and relaxed, my posture is improved, and i'm ready to take on the day. Also, the music and narration are very plesant. I highly recomend this for anyone!",1044403200,3,542,4.074766355140187
1399460,3,B000056MO2,"Having spent more than 20 years as an amatuer barre-fly I have very mixed feelings about this video. It is VERY challening as the floor barre and stretches are usually only done daily by pro dancers as they are slow, monotonous and painful. Amateur classes usually do them once a month or so for pin-point conditioning. They do give a fantatstic workout, which you WILL feel. Unfortunately, there is little actual movement or dancing in this video, and its the moving combinations which are my greatest love. This is all of the slow, painful, challenging stuff that pros use to hone their craft, without the joyous sense of movement that inspires and encourages us to dance when we feel awful, can't seem to stick our technique or had a lousy day at our day job. I would recommend it only as an addition to a regular routine with a ballet class on video tape like one of Melissa Lowe's or David Howard's, never on its own and never for someone with no ballet experience. Actually, it is most beneficial for high level amateurs bored with their class routines and pros in small companies who need additional strengthening, NEVER for beginners.",1043452800,14,1142,4.715
1399461,5,B000056MO2,"No, I have no coordination, no dance experience, and I'm beginning this working by tape thing.  However, this tape is great.  I do feel it helps with toning, and it is a very relaxing video.  The first time I tried the video it appeared intimidating.  By the second time, I was picking up the ballet terms and beginning to almost be in 'form'.  I felt great when I was finished, but it's definitely a video you should do behind closed doors.  That is assuming that you're as ungraceful as I am.  :)",1041292800,8,498,4.3478260869565215
1399462,4,B000056MO2,"This workout requires extra focus and concentration simply to stay balanced while doing some of the exercises. I have arthritis and I found it helpful in working out some of the stiffness I experience in the morning. It is somewhat aerobically challenging, but this video really does work on strengthening muscles all over the body. I find it challenging to hold my arms up the whole time in the ballet positions for some of the exercises. It is definitely challenging for me, who has never taken ballet, to do repetitive tendus and degages. I noticed my posture feels better all day after I do this tape. Doing the ballet exercises also makes me feel more graceful as well. The workout can be done barefoot or with dancer aerobic shoes.  The dancers are shown with and without shoes.  I enjoyed learning the ballet terms and the classical music is a refreshing change from the usual exercise video soundtracks. Peter Martins instructs the class in a easy to follow, soothing voiceover. This is a good tape to buy if you have always wanted to take a ballet class but never did. The tape features short bios on each dancer, (four of them,) after the workout. It is interesting to watch at least once.",1041033600,7,1199,4.677725118483412
1399463,1,B000056MO2,"This workout may help with your flexibility, but you will NOT gain strength or cardio-respiratory endurance, or lose weight. It all depends on what you are looking for in a workout. If you are looking to sweat and burn calories, get a cardio video or go for a hard run. If you are looking to increase your flexibility and balance, this tape may help a little. Overall I did not like this tape, mostly bacause of the lack of instruction. They do very difficult moves and do not tell you how to do it. Personally I would recommend that you didn't waste your money on this, but, hey, it's cheaper than a ballet class.",1040256000,7,614,4.394736842105263
1399464,5,B000056MO2,I loved this video! I used to dance when I was in high school and missed my ballet work outs! It was like going back to my dancing class. It's a fun video and a good work out to stay in shape. I think some ballet knowledge is necessary to follow this video. I could do every excercise without any problems but I must admit that people who never did this before could get confused with some exercises and with the terminology used in the video. It's a hard work out and you'll be exhausted when you are done but you'll see improvements soon!,1039478400,,540,4.201923076923077
1399465,4,B000056MO2,"This is a different kind of workout but one that you don't have to be a dancer to do.  Although it was difficult to follow at times, I found that I still enjoyed doing it, even when I knew that I looked nothing like the dancers on my screen.  There were two male and two female dancers dressed in workout clothing; at times they were wearing shoes and at other times not, but this was not explained.  An accented voice gives voice-over instructions, although these are often pretty minimal and the cueing is poor.  The music is classical.  The workout itself broke down into 17 sections as follows:
1-3:  Three short warm up sessions.  #2 especially had some complicated choreography, but the warm ups were pretty easy overall.
4:  Stretches.
5:  Abs.  This is mainly traditional crunches.
6:  Floor Barre 1.  This moves on to some nice leg stretches for things and buttocks.
7:  Floor Barre 2.  This part continues with butt and inner thighs work then moves on to some Pilates-like exercises.
8:  Floor Barre 3.  These exercises are for upper back and chest, including push-ups; it was hard to keep an eye on the screen.
9:  Plis.
10:  Tendu.
11:  Dgag--basically lifting your toe off the floor.
12:  Pass--similar but lifting knee.
13:  Front Attitude--balance moves on one leg.
14:  Grand Battemant Front--leg lifts to the front.
15:  Arabesque Raises--similar lifts to the back with some balance work.
16:  Little jumps--moving from plis to toe raises to small jumps; the instruction is especially poor in this section.
17:  Reverence--this means ""bow,"" and it's a stretching and relaxation sectin that includes yoga-like bends and lunges.  The voice-over says to ""just follow the dancers,"" but again, it's kind of hard to see the screen from some positions.
Overall, I found this to be a fun little change of pace; it's doable for anyone with some basic coordination and flexibility.",1031270400,32,1888,4.84012539184953
1399466,4,B000056MO2,"This is fun if you always wanted be a ballerina but never had the chance. The set, the dancers and the music were beautiful. I am not sure why they decided to have Sarah Jessica Parker do the intro, it was pretty pointless. I recommend watching the video first and then trying the moves if you don't know ballet moves and lingo. This is fun if for a once in a while workout, I personally prefer Grace Lazenby's ""All the Right Moves- Yoga, Pilates and Dance Conditioning"" video for better results.",1029196800,3,496,4.461538461538462
1399467,3,B000056MO2,"UPDATE on 9/7/01 - NEW YORK SPORTS CLUB VERSION BETTER:
The quality of the NEW YORK CITY BALLET WORKOUT at NEW YORK SPORTS CLUBS in NYC has taken a nosedive. Only one of the instructors I mentioned is teaching and all the others I have taken with around the city are not worth a repeat visit. It was once such an incredible workout, but without the right instructors it is very lame!  Bring back Rebecca Mesker and Stas Kmec(the best)and more quality instructors!",1027900800,,463,4.578313253012048
1399468,1,B000056MO2,The tape broke as soon as I put it in the VCR.  So I didn't get much of a work-out.  Other than trying to remove the tape.,1027468800,,122,3.4814814814814814
1399469,2,B000056MO2,"maybe it was just me but it seemed that this video misleads people. the cover is appealing and it sounds great to be toned without becoming bulky. unfortunately, the video itself is extremely boring and hard to follow. there's no excitement to get you motivated, only a plain white room and a narrator with a voice that could put you to sleep in a minute. i also found it very hard to do and i felt like an idiot prancing around not one bit as graceful as the dancers.it goes on forever and i can never seem to finish. i only give it two stars because it is not the video's fault that i am not coordinated enough.",1023753600,3,613,4.203389830508475
1399470,4,B000056MO2,"I am 37 and have always been thin but not toned lately, especially after having three kids. I wanted to firm up but not add any bulk. I have been very frustrated with different yoga tapes because the pace is just sooooo slow and I have NO interest in meditating. I went online to find something new to try and came across this video. I immediately knew I wanted it because I have always envied dancers bodies. The first time I tried it I merely watched while eating chips on the sofa. The second time I felt like a fool because I just could not follow it much, especially the warm up. The third time I was able to follow it better and was able to complete most of the moves and I have to say it made me feel healthy, beautiful and sexy. Just looking at the beautiful bodies makes you feel motivated. The pace is perfect for me and were it not for the impossible to follow warm up I would give it five stars. I actually really look forward to doing this tape every day -- and this from a chip eating, t.v. watching, lazy gal.",1023321600,7,1024,4.150753768844221
1399471,5,B000056MO2,"I did this video today for the first time, and, Wow, I loved it.  This is one exercise video that I can imagine working out with for years.  These are the same exercises (or layman's modifications) that have been creating killer dancer bods for as long as there has been an art form called ballet, so you know they are effective.  But what immediately impressed me were the high production values. I really appreciated the excellent classical music selections, chosen to keeping tempo with the movements, the neutral black background, and the lack of exercise-guru attitude displayed by the awe-inspiring four dancers who demonstrate the exercises.  In other words, this is a breath of fresh air after too many exercise videos displaying distracting MTV-style camera work, with music, sets and costumes that are sure to look as ridiculously outdated in a decade or two (and to be as impossible to work out to without laughing hysterically) as vintage 80's aerobicizing is today.
So, there are the refreshingly un-tacky production values.  There are the stunningly well-toned dancers in form-revealing exercise wear.  (My three-year remarked, ""Some of the people are naked.""  Well, not quite...)  There is Peter Martin's deep, calm, European-accented voice, giving the instruction in voice-over.  But how does this rate as a workout?  I would say ""five stars.""  It was do-able the first time but leaves plenty of room for growth; after all, these are some of the exercises that these dancers, in such peak shape, do daily.  Surprisingly, I was the most challenged by the ""Warm Up"" section, as the choreographed little floor combination left me feeling like I had two left feet.  Then the video moved on to mat work, done lying down, such as the Abs section, and standing ""barre"" work, involving lots of plies.  So, luckily for an somewhat uncoordinated person like me, there were not many more sections of speedily combined actual dance steps.  Overall, it was definitely work, and I felt it aerobically, but there were good stretches in between the exercises throughout, and the entire workout flowed well and never lagged.  It felt as though it went by quickly, while at the same time being thorough and addressing every area of the body.
My only real criticism is that the five foot positions are referred to in passing during exercises, without having been previously broken down and defined.  So, one might find oneself standing there saying, ""Wait, what does he mean, 'feet in fifth position'?"", without necessarily getting it just by looking at the dancers' feet.  It might have been a good idea to demonstrate these in an introductory segment.  Other terms, like ""plie,"" ""releve"" and ""tondue"" are briefly but effectively defined, however.  I liked how the workout ended with a section entitled ""Reverence,"" which had to do with bowing in respect to the art form of the dance.  It's a full hour long workout, which I also appreciated; some of the newer Yoga and Pilates videos I have turn out to have only about twenty minutes of instruction, which is a bit of a rip-off when they are not advertised as ""quick version for days when you have no real time.""  After doing this workout, I felt really uplifted and expansively euphoric.  I must have had an ever-so-beginner/amateur Ballerina's Exercise High.",1020470400,14,3309,4.987249544626594
1399472,4,B000056MO2,"Though many reviewers would not describe this as a workout video, it is definitely exactly that...you truly need to WORK to get the most OUT of it.
For everyone that is not familiar with ballet terms, you will be somewhat lost with the lingo. It will not explain fully or sometimes at all what the ballet terms mean so you will have to guess as you watch the dancers. For some, it will not be too difficult to learn what a plie or tendu is.
The narrator mentions proper form during the workout, however, the viewer will not learn what the proper form is by this video. You will probably need additional instruction elsewhere to learn the form if you have no ballet training. But, there are times when the narrator will remind you to tuck in your tailbone or do not stick out your buttocks (which I find hilarious every time I hear it). Overall, the vocal cues and instructions are very poor and minimal. For example, he often does not cue you as to which side or what movement is next. For some routines, I had to watch it first, and then I was able to follow the sequence. There is an option on the DVD that allows you to turn off the voice over if that is helpful.
If you have some background in ballet, then this video would be a good accompaniment to your ballet training. You can strengthen your muscles, improve your posture and line, and increase flexibility. Inexperienced dancers can learn basic ballet skills and grace along with what I just mentioned by following the dancers. For the slightly experienced dancers, the majority of video would seem too simple but the abs and leg darts exercise would give you a good burn...I found it to be very challenging for me.
The music and the flow of this video are very slow and relaxing. You will sweat but you won't be dripping with it afterwards. It has a very different style and tempo than other workouts you might be used to, but I think that is appropriate because it is based on the ballet theme. There is only one exercise or segment I consider that works your cardiovascular system, and that is the little jumps. Each segment is about 3-6 min long. Short but very effective...wouldn't want a burnout. There are warm-ups and a cool-down (aka reverence). I recommend the DVD so you may choose which exercise you want to do or skip without delay. There is also a section where they offer combinations of exercises that are good for a particular type of sport like racquetball.
The video is not very amateur friendly production-wise if you are not familiar with dance or dance classes. For example, all exercises are done without supports (i.e. chairs or barre). Stressing and encouraging balance I suppose. However, if you need the extra help, I recommend doing some of the exercises with a support next to you that will not hinder the purpose of the exercise. The exercises don't require a large amount of space so you do not need to clear the room. The video also does not offer alternatives for novices. It is basically ""watch and do"" except for one of the stretches and the push up, where they offer a modified version. And do not be confused with their narration when referring to lefts and rights. Many reviewers found this to be a problem. The narrator refers to the movements according to the dancers' point of view. This should not be a problem if you have the narrator's voice off or if you are familiar with this type of instructional training.
I would have given this a 5 star if not for the production flaws. Overall, the workout fulfilled its purpose--it tones your arms, back, abs, sides, buttocks, legs, chests, etc. A note, though there isn't a specific exercise that targets the arms, you will feel a burn in your shoulders and triceps from holding your arms out at second position during most of the exercises.",1019347200,26,3788,4.572058823529412
1399473,5,B000056MO2,I used to take ballet when i was younger and i still love it alot! When my sister got the book i was like oh id like to try that but i hate working out to books. So when i saw the video i was so happy and bought it. I remember alot of the moves and it was very fun for me. But also ballet is wonderful for strength excerises and gets you super toned. It is a wonderful workout even for people who never took ballet. It introduces you to all the positions. But i would like to say one thing i wish this video would deminstrate the moves more. The ballet dancers just do it the excersies like they are in a class not like they are demstrating a class. But they go slow enough that if you are paying attention you can do it with them at their pace. So get it if you are interested.,1016928000,2,778,3.86875
1399474,3,B000056MO2,"I am a 26-year-old runner with an ongoing acheilles injury who is starting to vary my workouts alot so thought I would try ballet.  Although I like this tape, I would have to agree with other reviewers-- it is too slow between exercises (has a screen introducing the next exercise), the warm-up is too fast (and the stretches are not very thorough), there are not enough repetitions of each exercise, the cuing is the worse I have ever heard, and there is no description of what the ballet terms are (until after you start doing them) and very little on proper form.
That said, the production is quite nice and ballet is challenging (I have a new respect for how athletic ballet is) so I do do the video for a change of pace (and continue the exercises over the breaks between screens to make it more challenging).  You will have to watch the video at least 2 times to get the form and take it upon yourself to tuck your pelvic bone in (it is very easy to slip into sticking your [behind] out with ballet!)  Overall I would say this is a good video to practice form and control (the exercises can be hard if you push yourself for greater flexibility while maintaining proper control).  It is not a video to lose weight (you may not break a sweat after the first few times) or significantly shape your body -- try pilates or yoga for that.
The video also includes a little documentary at the end about the ballerinas -- very interesting and a nice addition.",1016064000,4,1456,4.4216417910447765
1399475,2,B000056MO2,"I bought this video when enrolled in weekly exercise-ballet classes the the local club. i found this video to move way too slowly between the exercises, and too ""markety"" in how it presents them all. i was constantly fast forwarding to get to the next one. and each exercise itself it not repeated enough to be useful... far too many moves with too much time between them. overall, just not very useful or helpful.",1015804800,4,414,4.608108108108108
1399486,3,B000056MO2,"I'm not sure that this tape was seriously meant to be a workout tape. The cuing is bad, with insufficient explanation of the moves, form, and positions the dancers use. Using professional dancers as the models, exercises are demonstrated in their most extreme difficulty, with little explanation of possible modifications for those who are not as limber or fit. For instance, it is never even suggested that a beginner might like to use a chair back as a barre for the floor sections.
As entertainment, this is about as beautiful an exercise video as you could hope to watch. The dancers are undeniably attractive and graceful. They are photographed artfully. Because of the minimalism and repetition of the movements--it is a workout, after all, not a ballet--dance steps are pared to a geometric abstraction that is very pleasing to watch. The segment at the end, with profiles of the four dancers who demonstrate the workout, is an added bonus.

1399487,5,B000056MO2,"This tape is great for anyone who is an intermediate-advanced exerciser. It's 1 hours long and it's divided in 17 sections, each focusing on specific movements/muscles. All exercises are performed with beautiful classical music in the background.
The video contains a warm-up, lower-body stretches, abdominal exercises, and then ""floor barre"" (which are basically middle and lower body toning exercises), upper body and back toning and strengthening exercises; then you have several sections that include ballet movements, and then a cool-down.
This video is ideal if you want to shape your body and sculpt your muscles without ""puffing them up"": I never liked those hard, bulging muscles! I like better lean, long muscles like these dancers have. As one of the dancers observes, the NYC ballet dancers' bodies are different from other ballet dancers, and they truly are: these dancers have very beautiful, athletic bodies, rather than just being very thin like most ballet dancers.
Another dancer says that ballet is a very athletic discipline, but most people don't notice that, because the bodies of the dancers are developed nicely and they move gracefully: we all know ballet is characterized by elegant moves and great posture and balance, and who wouldn't want that? That's why I would suggest this to anyone who wants to feel and look better thanks to exercise",1011225600,7,1368,5.222727272727273
1399488,5,B000056MO2,"I love this tape!! I don't have any ballet dancing experience, but found the dancers easy to follow!! The music is relaxing and the exercises are truly fun and I can really feel that it's helped me tighten up already!! Great all over body workout! I couldn't be happier with how it has helped me improve my posture and gracefulness (REALLY!!), too!! This is definitely a video I would recommend any serious fitness buff add to their collection.",1011139200,4,444,4.705128205128205
1399489,1,B000056MO2,"I purchased this video about 6 months ago and have used it several times, here are the reasons I don't like it:
1) They take the most beaufiul dancers in the world and put them in bike shorts and exercise bras, on the bleakest set in the history of videos. They have bodies that Michelangelo could not do justice to, but in this video they look as lovely as one of those medical texts showing starving children in stark black and white. Other people have said how much they liked the black and white effect, but I think it was a terrible choice and wish they might have integrated just a little color.
Also, it seems someone threatened to shred the dancers tutus if they smiled even once during the filming because never have I seen four people so determined to keep their faces a mask of boredom.
2) David Martins is no Denise Austin (okay, that can be good sometimes, but not in an exercise video). It is obvious that he doesn't use these sorts of videos very often, because he doesn't seem to know that the purpose of the narrator is to help the viewer follow along. He seems to prefer letting you figure it out on your own.
3) He never explains a lot of the ballet terminology. If you are a dancer, you'll be fine when he tells you to releve, tendu and plie. If your whole experience with ballet is that your mom dragged you to the Nutcracker when you were five, you might be a little lost.
4)The music really is lovely, but not very invigorating. The steps themselves are not very exciting, but rather boring. Some exercise routines leave you pumped and ready for the day. Not so with this tape. I find the reverence (the cool-down at the end) to be the most fun of the whole tape. Otherwise it's just repetition.
5) He has you do tendus with flexed foot, which as a dancer, bothers me extremely. If you are trying to learn ballet, you should always do tendus with very pointed feet and I think showing them flexed, especially for a beginner, can foster a bad habit.
What redeeming qualities does this video have?
1) The interviews with the dancers at the end of the tape are an interesting view into the life of a professional dancer.
2) During the interviews, they show clips of the dancers actually dancing instead of boringly working out. In these clips they look happy, engaged, beautiful. If only the whole thing had been like that.
3) The exercises will help develop leg, abdominal and buttocks muscles as well as flexibility, if you can stay awake.",1010707200,7,2461,4.458980044345898

Even those with little training in ballet (like me) can pick up what's going on and try to follow along without feeling like an idiot. But it's the four dancers themselves that are the highlight of this program--you see them and want to look like them so much that you keep going, and before you know it, your workout is done!",1010016000,5,464,4.658536585365853

People who don't stretch or exercise will probably have a hard time at first but nobody should count on being as limber as the dancers on screen. It might also be hard to do some of the moves in first position rather than standing normally. You start wondering when the exercises are going to end but after the first time watching this video, it goes a little faster. You come away from it feeling graceful and a lot better, but you should probably try to do this every day if possible.",1009756800,5,643,4.235772357723577

There is one tiny dance section (if you can call it that), and the rest is the dancers going through very slow, very boring stretches.  I did not break a sweat or even have tired muscles afterward.

I used to take jazz dance class and many of the moves were familiar to me.  They are simple and really give you a good workout.  I sweat more than I did doing 30 minutes on a stationary bicycle.  After the workout, which goes by really fast, I felt good that I actually stuck to it to the end and I didn't feel worn down and beat and I am looking forward to doing it again!

I am a lifelong fan of ballet, especially the New York City Ballet and thought this workout would be just what i needed as i was looking for something to balance yoga classes with. I had taken adult ballet classes just two years ago in college but was not prepared for how much actual background you need to follow many of the excercises. Poor editing left me confused while watching as to whose right or left I should be following. Unfortunately, I was left by the end, on my couch, watching and admiring these limber dancers. Realized how rusty I am. This is a beautiful and effective workout but not for those with limited or no ballet technique.

Because maybe, just maybe, if you do what these incredible athletes tell you to do, you can achieve a small bit of the grace and beauty that they possess.
The workout is easy to follow, and a lot of it is ""floor barre work"" that is done lying down (great for apartment dwellers who can't get away with aerobic stomping.) The workout is narrated by voiceover and alternates between visuals of male and female dancers doing the exercises. Everybody looks and sounds very serious which makes you feel very virtuous and Serious About Your Body even on the first try. It takes 60 minutes.
I've fallen off the health wagon, and this video, for less than the price of a single walk-in ballet class, has helped me snap out of a cable news channel-induced zombie trance. I'm grateful for that.",1006128000,,1054,4.7650273224043715
1399499,3,B000056MO2,"After fifteen years of ballet, I took a 'break' in college and admittedly lost lots of technique.  I thought this video might be fun and I was intrigued by the book as well.  However, I was disappointed by the disjointed way that segments were combined and movements were introduced.  It seemed too advanced for someone with no prior knowledge of the technique and terminology and lacked the fluidity of dance class.  It also irked me that the narration and the dancers were not synchronized.  At some point I just gave up and started moving to the music, which worked just fine.  However, if you want a good workout, you cannot beat floor barre - we used to dread that part of class.  Also, I found the abs section suitably challenging.  While not pleased with the video as a whole, I would recommend parsing it up and using only the parts that are right for you.",1005782400,6,864,4.529032258064516

This work-out most certainly will lengthen and refine the muscles, as promised, IF the proper placement is maintained thoughout whether standing or lying on the floor ... AND if given enough time to do its job.  Ballet dancers spend years developing long elegant bodies and even the excellent NYCB Workout will take dedicated attention to achieve truly significant results.

1399502,3,B000056MO2,"I must admit, when I first tried this tape, I had to stop about three segments into it to catch my breath.  Not from working so hard, mind you, but from laughing so hard.
It starts off easily enough, but before you know it, the dancers are leaping around the stage with little verbal instruction for the at-home klutzy novice (i.e., me).  After the initial warmup confusion, though, it gets a bit better - the ab work was excellent, and on par with a good Pilates workout.  And the finishing ""Little Jumps"" segments did really get my heart rate going.
This video will definitely improve flexibility, core strength, and posture, if you can follow the moves and get past the lack of instruction in some parts. If you've had some cursory dance training, it will help. On the whole, though, it's a pretty good workout video, especially if you're looking for something different than the standard Kathy Smith or Denise Austin aerobic fare.",1002499200,13,934,4.717791411042945

However, I would suggest anyone trying this work-out have at least some ballet training under their belt.  I could see it could be too difficult and perhaps daunting for those who have never studied ballet and wouldn't understand the basic concepts of ballet form, alignment, and vocabulary.  The exercises require a certain amount of pre-existing muscular foundation to be done correctly, otherwise there may be potential for injury.

The shots are not designed for people to follow, unless you have a background of ballet.
However, I gave this a 4 star rating because it does have wonderful qualities to it, as well. If you have the workout book and are familiar with the stretches and movements, the video takes it up to another level. It helped me to take what I had gotten from the book and continued to improve upon it. The music used makes it easier to flow with the movements. One last caution, this is a fairly difficult workout.

Perhaps this is the way ballet is taught, but for those who are use to video workouts that fully guide you through the program, you will find yourself a bit frustrated.

After sitting at a desk far too much without exercise, I needed something to put me back into shape - and fast!  I tried Pilates, and Yoga, and some aerobics too but I became bored and unimpressed and at times felt I could end up being carried off on a stretcher.  Then I saw the video of New York City Workout on a shop shelf and bought it.  What a gem!  Don't buy it expecting to be the next Fontaine or Nureyev.  Buy it and expect to resculpture your body.  The tape indicated with a prior warning that you should be in good health and seek doctors advice first - which is normal procedure.  Within only 2 weeks I saw the difference in my body.  I felt stronger, healthier, more flexible and full of wellbeing.  I even feel taller although I have always had good posture anyway!  Psychologically, the exercises are soothing in a way that reminds me of yoga.  The narrator has a nice smooth English accent, never patronizing, and although he needed a bit more synchronization (possibly an editing fault)with the dancers' movements and although I agree that, at times, it was physically impossible to follow the exercises and look at the TV screen at the same time, these problems are not insurmountable.  By repetition, over a short period of time, I soon learned the names of the various ballet positions and was able to do the various exercises without watching the dancers.  I didn't feel it important to be fully synchronized with the dancers when I could not see the TV.  What I thought was important was to use their guidance from memory and do the exercises correctly to get the most benefit.  Don't expect to be able to do everything exactly as they do; not in a short space of time anyway (you should be so lucky!)  All you need is to do the best you can, without overdoing it, and enjoy it.  It's fun.  Some people might be disappointed that there are no exercises standing at a barre, giving a feeling of attending a ballet class, but the ""floor barre"" exercises do work and you will feel the benefit.  I can easily do the full, approx. 1 hour exercise routine both before work and after work.  I don't feel too tired nor do I work up a ""sweat"", but there is a bit of cardiovascular exercise in the ""little jumps"" which are more demanding than they look.

The unique thing about this workout is that it changes my posture, so that I stand up really tall.  It is magic.  The ""floor barre section"" is excellent.  It strenghens the legs and posture too.  The abdominal section while hard, becomes easier if you do it everyday, like Peter Martins says, ""This is what we do everyday"" and so I do it everyday, 7 days a week, even when I have class. My back problems have disappeared too.  I feel more centered.  This is the only video that doesn't seem like a chore to do. And the music is enthralling.

This video rules !!!!",1086652800,10,1078,4.520618556701031
7932599,2,B000056MO2,"as ex dancers, my wife and i were hoping this video would be as much fun as our old dance classes, but the instructors were bland and difficult to follow. It was not smooth and graceful, and the pilates refeernces seem unfounded. We did not like it and think it only sells beacuse of the name. Try somehting else instead.",1072569600,2,321,4.366666666666666
7932600,5,B000056MO2,"i think this video is a good idea if you've got a background in dance and need a slow class to recover from an injury or something. (which was my case) it isn't as good as taking a live class OF COURSE but it does a decent job. If you DONT have a background in ballet, don't even bother- there isn't much instruction. and more than likely if you don't know the steps, you'll do them wrong, and not get a workout, and complain about it. really, in the end, this is a ballet dancers touch up course.",1069804800,,497,4.081632653061225
7932601,1,B000056MO2,"Thank god for the library. I was excited when I came across this tape at the library. I took dance classes as a child and have lots of rhythm. None of that mattered with this tape.
There are too many gaps, so the 'workout' doesn't seem consistent. The narrator is horrific. It's impossible to follow his instructions. If you follow him, and look up, you realize that the dancers are doing something totally different.
Do not waste your time on this tape unless you are a prima ballerina who can't get enough.
Otherwise, use it to balance out an old table.",1060560000,4,555,4.5049504950495045
