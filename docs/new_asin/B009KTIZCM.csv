8542624,4,B009KTIZCM,"The content itself is good.  My frustration is with the way the DVD is set up.  When playing the different DVDs, they only play one part at a time.  It then reverts back to the menu list where you have to select the next clip.  This wouldn't be a big deal on the interviews, but the DVD that contains snippets of various debates are only about 1-3 minutes long. It takes longer to navigate the CONFUSING menu than it does to watch the clip.",1415750400,,440,4.2023809523809526
