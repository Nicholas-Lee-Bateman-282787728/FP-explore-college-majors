3136762,5,B001504T7E,"For all of you fascinated by the Ballets Russes or Balanchine. Or those of you who have a child in ballet class.  I only knew Doubrovska from those photographs of her as the Siren in the Prodigal Son, or as the first Polyhymnia in Apollo (if you can take your eyes off of Danilova and Lifar), and from anecdotes from friends who went to SAB, who found her inspiring and endearing, albeit eccentric.  After viewing this excellent DVD, I finally understand her allure as a dancer and brilliance as a teacher.
Maria Tallchief, Allegra Kent, and Maria Calegari speak about this woman's impact on them...and it is marvelous to notice how their body language (and even cadence of speech) alters as they describe Doubrovska.  Each begins to pull their body into a more erect position, to alter the way they hold their heads. They become even more elegant.  John Taras provides thoughtful insights and continuity.  Best of all, Tanaquil Le Clerc's off-camera smoky voice adds shrewd observations which are smoothly integrated into this tale of a woman whose performing career spanned from ancien regime Russia to Diaghilev and Pavlova's adventures, and ended up bringing the best of these worlds to her American students .
Doubrovska herself-- caught on camera in 1978 --  talks charmingly about her great roles (and about working with those who created them):  Nijinska for Les Noces and Les Biches; Balanchine for Apollo and Prodigal Son ( for the last of which she demonstrates a section in someone's living room, trapped between a vitrine and a coffee table!)
And there is more.  Footage from her classes, demonstrating and giving corrections.  The process of transmission at its best, and god, is she in shape.
And then the funniest moment arrives. footage of  Alexandra  Danilova and Dubrovska in a studio in a passive/aggressive show & tell quibble over who remembers best Michel Fokine's choreography (and style!, that is of the essence) while reconstructing a section of the 1907 Le Pavillion d'Armide.  You wish they had not tried to be on for the camera and had instead spoken to each other in Russian -- to be subtitled later.  That would have been truly juicy!
Which brings me to a quibble. (Every rave review should have one).  As some of the interviews were conducted in the early days of modern technology (and thank god they were made!) the sound quality is sometimes the best it could be for then but not perfect.  Friends here in France that I've shown it to have wished for even English-language subtitles at times.  But if you are American and patient, you can get the words, so don't worry.
Now the shocker.  I could not believe the entire thing was only 36 minutes long!  I was so immersed in it, and each moment was so rich and well selected,  I thought at least an hour and a half had gone by.  Don't hesitate about buying this.  Instead of a long and fat and watery Hershey bar...you get a small and perfect and delicious truffle from La Maison du chocolat!",1233187200,8,2975,4.760233918128655

8256849,5,B001504T7E,"This is a charming little film.  After seeing the film, I could see how Madame Doubrovska influenced generations after generations of dancers. Although there was no footage of her dancing, thank God there were some footage of her teaching.  It is definitely a treat for anyone who is interested in Balanchine or NYC Ballet",1418083200,,322,4.944444444444445
8256850,5,B001504T7E,"An enchanting video. I'd long known about Felia Doubrovska  and her work with the first era Ballets Russes (1907-1909), like her creation of the role of the Siren in 'Le Fils Prodigue'.

This film brings her to life through film of her teaching in class (and she still had some actual technique!) and through interviews.

She is so sweet and shy and warm ... honestly, one of my favourite videos!

8256851,5,B001504T7E,"Wonderful, in depth, short documentary of Mme Doubrovska, who taught at the School of American Ballet!  Superb footage of her teaching and demonstrating... she could still dance beautifully well into her 80's!  For anyone interested in the Russian Ballet teachers whom George Balanchine brought over to teach at his school!  And just those interested in ballet! Fascinating!",1282521600,,374,5.526315789473684
8256852,5,B001504T7E,I purchased this for my son-in-law for Christmas. His mother was in the video. He was well pleased with it.,1265414400,,107,4.4
8256853,5,B001504T7E,"This film is wondrous.  I read some reviews about this documentary when I was doing some research about Diaghilev.  It was shown at a film festival in the United States. The reviews were wonderful and I moaned miserably to myself because I didn't think I would ever be able to view the film myself.  (I live in Australia)  Well, imagine my delight when I was searching Amazon for ballet films and this popped up.  I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY LUCK.  I COULD OWN THIS FILM???  UNBELIEVABLE!!!  I couldn't get my order in quick enough, it arrived within days (thanks Virginia), I stopped everything, put on the dvd and just enjoyed. After the first viewing I made myself a mug of tea and, with mug of tea in hand, WATCHED IT AGAIN.

Virginia Brooks has done a wonderful job.  Comment has been made about the audio quality when Madame Doubrovska is being interviewed.  Fair enough and sub titles may have been helpful (and perhaps are still a possibility), however, after you have watched the film a couple of times (and you will watch it many many many times) you will understand her a lot better. Don't be discouraged from buying the dvd. She speaks in that charming way of elderly Russian ballerinas and one day, after watching the film a few times, you will understand and get the general idea. Perhaps one could suggest that she is so modest she doesn't want to talk about herself.  Don't be put off, this rare footage of her is a must for every one interested in Diaghilev, Ballets Russes, New York City Ballet and so on.

Thank goodness there is film like this.  Think how miraculous it is that there are snippets of film of Madame Karsavina, Madame Spessivtseva and Madame Danilova (to mention but a few).

Madame Doubrovska was obviously an elegant, gentle, modest, beautiful lady and, I think, very shy.  This was evident when she was talking and especially so when she was shown teaching at the School of American Ballet.  What precious film.  Madame Doubrovska must have been in her middle 70s when the film of her teaching was made.  The gentle loving way she taught, the absolutely delicious pleasure she got from teaching, her quiet humour, it is all there to see and a joy to behold.  Her legs....TRES MAGNIFIQUE...and she was in her mid 70s!  I wish I had had legs like hers when I was 20!!!  At one point, in order to demonstrate, she stood facing the barre, extended her right leg, turned at right angles to the barre, leg still extended, and stretched backwards.  Exquisite.

As has been mentioned by another reviewer there was a marvellous sequence with Madame Danilova as they worked out some of the choreography from Armide's Pavilion for Mikhail Baryshnikov.  How I wish there was some film of Baryshnikov being coached and performing the solo.  The encounter between Madame Doubrovska and Madame Danilova was wickedly delicious.

I envy any dancer or student who had the honour of being taught, coached or guided by this gracious and charming lady.

I just don't know how to adequately describe this film. It is a treasure, a very important document and congratulations to Virginia Brooks.",1264636800,,3104,4.72998137802607
8256854,4,B001504T7E,"Since I purchased ""Ballets Russes""....<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ballets-Russes/dp/B000G5SIBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ballets Russes</a>....I have purchased other documentaries, and this is one of them. It is certainly not as good as Ballets Russes, but if you are interested in early ballet and it's beginnings, you need this one too. The sound quality is it's main defect, so you will need to view it several times to get an understanding, but still it is worthwhile. Felia Doubrovska was a beautiful human being. The world needs more like her. It is just too too bad there are no films of her dancing, but that's another good reason for getting this DVD. We do get to see her interacting with her students at the American Ballet School, and personal interviews with and by those who were intimate with her.....Richard.

P.S.  Since they won't let me change my Star Rating above, at least I can add a change of mind here. This Docu is 5 star in content and I should have rated it that way to begin with. OK the sound quality isn't perfect, but the material is. So, buy this disc and enjoy it......Richard.",1246060800,3,1153,5.160427807486631
8256855,5,B001504T7E,I purchased this bio from Virginia Brooks. She did a fine job of this bio of a great ballerina and teacher. I don't regret buying this. If you love ballet you must have this. It is a fine part of my collection.,1238889600,,210,4.023809523809524

8256857,5,B001504T7E,"Madame Doubrovska *is* remembered.  I just received this incredible DVD in the post from Virginia Brooks and I cannot recommend this DVD enough to dance lovers, historians of dance, theatre lovers, but especially to young ballet dancers who would have so much to gain by understanding the contribution a small handful of Russian dancers made to the history and genesis of modern American ballet and dance - Madame Doubrovska being a major influence and one of them.  She taught at Mr. Balanchine's School of American Ballet and brought the Russian Imperial Tradition to the United States with Mr. Balanchine, and we love and remember her for what she and Mr. Balanchine did for us.  This DVD includes utterly precious interviews with key players and creators in modern American ballet history, and if you collect and treasure videos, DVDs or anything else to do with ballet, the arts and theatre in general (but New York City Ballet and George Balanchine in particular) you will want to own this DVD. I try to explain to people what great ballet is, and what great tradition is, but one really has to see it and experience it ""one-to-one"" to really ""get it"". Some of Madame Doubrovska's energy, grace, and dignity are preserved here for all of us thanks to the efforts of Ms. Brooks.  If you care about NYCB, Mr. Balanchine, ballet, or dance at all you will want to own and experience this DVD.  I remember a story of Mr. Balanchine and NYCB being in Russia for the first time since Mr. Balanchine left, and the Russian dancers and NYCB's dancers were in the studio together, and Mr. Balanchine said to John Taras:  ""Let's show them how it's done.""  And NYCB did their thing, and the history of Russian theatre was changed.  Now Madame Doubrovska shows us ""how it's done"" on DVD.  Don't miss this!",1235347200,4,1797,4.733974358974359
