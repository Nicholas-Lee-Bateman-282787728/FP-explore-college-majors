290428,4,6300269833,"Sure it's over the top. Sure Shelley Winters' character is absurd. But this one is a lot of fun. In the genre of blaxploitation movies, this movie is closer to ""Shaft"" in quality than it is to ""Foxy Brown"". ""Foxy"", while enjoyable, is a very amateurish production. ""Cleopatra"", on the other hand, is very well done. The car chase rates as one of the best of the era.
As for the transfer, it also is very well done. My only complaint about the DVD is the lack of any additional features. In fact, it is so bare that the menu is a generic Warner Bros. logo instead of related to the movie.
Regardless, even if you aren't a big fan of the blaxploitation genre, this one is great entertainment....exciting and funny at the same time.",1074643200,13,729,4.407407407407407
290429,2,6300269833,"If you liked the trashy Blaxploitation films of the 70s, you'll love this. If you're like me and hate this junk-filled genre, it ain't for you.
Bad acting (especially Shelly Winters and the ubiquitous Antonio Fargas), overdone story (main character getting revenge for framing by the (of course) racist crooked cops), ad nauseum. Good for laughs, but not much else.
However, there are some redeeming features that raise this from one starts to two for me. Bernie Casey comes off as a very sincere and redeeming character who tries to rid th eneighborhood of drug abuse. Cleo Jones herself shows that women can be smart as well as sexy (though she's not quite as charasmatic as Pam Grier's characters and Pam's a better actress). But in either case, this is one of those films best watched with a bunch of your friends over and a cooler filled with beers nearby.",1052870400,2,861,4.746666666666667
290430,5,6300269833,"I have always really liked this movie since it came out in 1973.  I have watched it countless times through the years on TV, but haven't seen it for a while on TV so I picked it up on DVD.  Although the DVD doesn't offer a lot of features, the picture quality is good and it's presented in it's original cinemascope format.  This was one of the higher budget ""blaxploitation"" flicks from the '70s.  Seeing it as a kid I thought it was the coolest movie.  Now that I am a lot older, it's still cool, but in a campy/fun way.  The plot consists of a government agent named Cleopatra Jones (Tamara Dobson)who is hired to rid the US of drugs.  She goes after one of the ""Queenpins"" of the drug trade called Mommy, played by Shelley Winters.  The one thing I never forgot about this movie was Cleopatra's kickin' Corvette complete with a cassette deck, which was really high-end at the time! (Most cars had 8-track players) Along with this was her funky fashions!  If you like the '70s action genre, this is a great addition to your library.",1049241600,33,1035,4.405263157894737
290431,3,6300269833,"As a good example to see how a major studio handles topics in vogue, ""Cleopatra Jones"" is worth watching.  I mean, there is nothing new in this film except the fact that more money is invested than in ""Coffy"" or ""Foxy Brown,"" small, independent company's works.  The formula is basically the same as those of so-called blaxploitaion films, but the shoot-out, car chase, or explosion scenes are all updated.
This movie is about Cleopatra Jones, or ""Cleo,"" sexy, cool, no-nonsense secret agent for government, who fights against drug syndicate.  And she uses karate (a bit).  Well, the rest is as you guess.  Tamara Dobson is remembered as Cleo, and rightly so.  Her tall, slender body fits exactly Cleopatra's character, and she is pretty impressive, and her acting is not bad.
However, much, much more impressive is Shelley Winters (Oscar winner!!), who plays ""Mommy,"" ruthless mastermind behind drug business.  Her hammy performance -- wearing a black leather jacket, yelling ""I will kill HERRR!!! -- is something you see in your nightmare.  She overacts so much that if Golden Raspberry Awards had been there back in the 70s, she surely would have win the prize of the decade.  The final scene, in which Cleo fights Mammy (yes, they fight!!) in a junkyard, will become ... well ... a bizzare memory for you.",1009670400,4,1309,4.913636363636364

290574,4,6300269833,"Back in the '70s leggy fashion model Tamara Dobson was the only one to really challenge Pam Grier for the title of ""Queen of Blaxploitation."" Standing at 6'2"" Dobson cut a striking figure. Didn't hurt that she looked so fine, either. Maybe Hollywood during that period was too grungy for her, but, for whatever reason, Dobson's film career wasn't so robust. Her signature movie is this one, 1973's Cleopatra Jones. It's rated PG, but you could've fooled me, son.

Grier's Coffy (out a month earlier) tracked an inner-city vigilante, a revenge-minded nurse who achieved her goals courtesy mostly of her damn good looks and her savvy street smarts. Conversely, while Dobson's Cleopatra Jones relied on those same traits, she was a glamorous globe-trotting adventuress, a narcotics government agent whose badge simply read ""Special Agent to the President."" It's a hell of a lot of leeway. As she informs a crony: ""My jurisdiction extends from Ankara, Turkey to Watts Tower, baby.""

And, yeah, the story opens in Turkey as Cleopatra Jones, in all her swanky finery, hobnobs with foreign military officers and curtly orders an air strike on a poppy field in Turkey worth $30 million on the streets. It's a loss that so incenses loopy Los Angeles drug lord ""Mommy"" (Shelly Winters) that she calls for a police raid on the local rehab center which happens to be Cleo's personal charity, seeing as how she was born just around the corner. Sadly for Mommy, she's just one more box to check off in Cleo's ongoing war to stamp out the world drug trade.

Okay, fine, the plot is structured in slapdash fashion. Characters show up and then get shoved to the side for the longest time so that you'd forgotten who they are when they resurface. But it doesn't matter. What matters is that director Jack Starrett manages to string along a series of entertaining sequences. Shelley Winters, very much in the twilight of her career, hams it up like she's in a silent movie or something. Antonio Fargas - a familiar face during the blaxploitation era and immortalized as the street informant, Huggy Bear, in Starsky & Hutch - is fun as the flashy Doodlebug, one of Mommy's distributors who is feeling his oats. Bernie Casey, on the other hand, is the model of restraint and dignity as the neighborhood activist who runs the rehab center and with whom Cleo sometimes hooks up.

But it's the Tamara Dobson show all the way. The director takes advantage of Dobson's gorgeous looks and impressive physique, dressing her in one runway chic outfit after another. She's got such a presence about her that I easily overlooked her crap martial arts technique. (Her karate grunts, though.) Yeah, son, the action bits are pedestrian stuff. Dobson makes up for it with her natural charisma. Doesn't hurt that she's imposing and statuesque and that her ride is a sweet black-and-silver Corvette equipped with its own phone and magnesium wheels and a cache of weapons hidden in her passenger seat door. Cleopatra Jones had a bigger budget than Coffy, so the production values are slicker. But it's still a blaxploitation flick, meaning that we get that urban cornucopia comprised of that funky brown-chicken-brown-cow soundtrack, posturing goons, dirty cops, and plenty of jive talk (""See you around, super honky.""). I'm glad, though, that the movie does present a white cop who's a good guy, someone that's solidly on Cleo's side. Not that she needed him. As someone remarked, ""Man, that broad is ten miles of bad road."" Dang, I enjoyed this movie and how the sheer elegance of Dobson surmounts the campiness of the genre.

290613,5,6300269833,"I love Tamara Dobson as Cleopatra Jones.  She fights for what is right and she holds no prisoners.  She's a Federal Agent in Turkey having a female drug boss's poppy field (which is worth a whole lot of money)  destroyed, which pisses the woman (Shelley Winters) off royally, of course.  I love Cleopatra Jones films (there are only two of them) and I wish more had been made though they're violent, of course, yet there's a great car chase  and Cleo Jones is excellent at martial arts.  I like seeing a woman be tough and able to take care of herself in any given situation, especially very dangerous situations.  I like seeing what outfit Cleo Jones will wear next, too.  It's a good, action-packed film with some comical scenes.  Antonio Fargas is great as Doodle Bug.  I love his death scene (he did another great death scene in Pam Grier's film ""Foxy Brown"").

290694,4,6300269833,"Dig it, man.  Cleopatra Jones (Tamara Dobson) is 6'2"" of black corvette driving, machine gun firing, karate kicking, outta sight wardrobe wearing government agent soul sister dynamite, and she's back in LA after burning a field of Turkish poppies (in the first scene), to put the town's biggest drug lord, Momma (Shelley Winters, yes, Shelley Winters) out of business.  Though Shelley seems more interested in her bevy of young lesbian lovers, and Cleo has to spend the first part of the flick confronting the local cops over a sting they put on a drug rehab house run by her sort-of boyfriend Reuben (has to be Bernie Casey, doesn't it?), a confrontation is inevitable.  But before we get there...

Cleo puts the heat on various dealers and enforcers working for Momma, to the point that her biggest employee, Doodlebug (Antonio Fargas, forever to be identified as a pimp though he isn't really playing one here) decides to split.  Uh-uh, Momma's not having that, so she decides to rub him out.  Cleo feels protective of Doodlebug's girlfriend Tiffany (Brenda Sykes) and on learning that Tiffany has escaped the massacre sets out to find her...which leads to that final confrontation as the two are taken by Momma's men to a junkyard to be disposed of.

The intimidating Dobson looks gorgeous and tough throughout, though at first she seems to vacillate between her obviously educated background and the street-smart character she's supposed to be playing, sometimes in the same scene; and her martial arts don't really cut it except in one scene where she takes out a bad cop with some choice kicks.  But there's a fair amount of gunplay, better done than the hand-to-hand, and a pretty solid 5 1/2 minute car chase around the halfway point through LA back alleys, a warehouse district, and canals.  The music is solidly funky if not first-rate, the supporting cast a lot of fun, and the photography by David M. Walsh is good enough to help compensate for the dullness of Max Julien and Sheldon Keller's scrpt and the just-above-average direction by Jack Starrett.

It's also a fairly mild example of the genre with a rather light amount of language, no sex or nudity whatsoever, and pretty low-key violence; overall it's not far off from a PG-13 and probably would have been cut just a little to get that rating had it existed in 1973.  Very much an anti-drug, stay off the streets message combined with a black power attitude that is a little softer than many of it's contemporaries; it's interesting that both the top cop, Crawford (Dan Frazer) and drug lord Momma are white, and in the end not only is the white momma bested by the black momma, but the top cop (who seems to have a subtle crush on Cleo) gives a black power salute in the final shot - indicating that he too has met his match.  Working with the Man...showing she's better than him....and having him admit it, happily.  That's the fantasy world of Cleopatra Jones - pretty silly if you stop to think about it, but ultimately it's a better fantasy than you find in most action movies.

I can't claim to be an expert (yet) on the blaxploitation genre, but this is definitely one of the best of the ten or so examples I've seen, and I'm eager to track down the sequel, CLEOPATRA JONES AND THE CASINO OF GOLD.  The Warner Brothers DVD for this first film is contained in a cheapo snap-case, with no extras at all, but it is a surprisingly good anamorphic transfer and at this price I'd sure recommend it.

290698,4,6300269833,"The 1970's gave rise to the female Blaxploitation cinema creating many cult favorites like Coffy, TNT Jackson, Get Christie Love and Cleopatra Jones. The allure of ""Cleopatra Jones"" was that once again the studio cast a beautiful black woman in the role of the heroine at a time when there were only a few black women who had successfully pulled it off while starring in the leading role. Several actresses in the 1970's such as Pam Grier, Theresa Graves, Playboy Playmate Jeanne Bell all proved they could carry a film and entertain an audience and Tamara Dobson was no exception.

While on assignment in Turkey ""Cleopatra Jones"" orders the destruction of a poppy field with a street value of 30 million dollars seriously hurting the drug traffic trade and Mommy's drug business back home. Hearing of this devastating news ""Mommy"" sets out to even the score with Cleopatra for good. Mommy with the help of some dirty cops orders a raid at an inner-city drug centre in order to get Cleopatra back home so she can eliminate her, or so she hopes. Upon Cleopatra's arrival home and a failed attempt by Mommy's stooges to kill her at the airport she learns of the raid and sets out to take down the people responsible by any means necessary and destroy ""Mommy"" in the process.

Looking ultra fantastic in everything she wore Tamara Dobson the six foot two inch beauty / former model portrayed a squeaky clean government agent named ""Cleopatra Jones"" who kicked butt and looked great while doing it. Cleopatra drove a sleek black and very menacing looking Corvette with a personalized license plate ""CLEO"". The corvette also came complete with an arsenal of weapons neatly tucked away and a modified roof for the six foot two inch beauty as she set out in style to take down the local drug trafficker known as ""Mommy"" played by (Shelley Winters) and put her out of commission once and for all.

Warner Brothers have done a decent job with this DVD release providing a really nice wide screen video transfer. The film still contains some minor debris and blemishes but nothing to take away from the overall enjoyment of the movie. The film also benefits from a first rate musical score by jazz arranger J.J. Johnson. He manages to create a soulful but stylish 70's funky sound that comes across clear and crisp on my sound system. All we need now is ""Cleopatra Jones and the Casino of Gold"" on DVD.

290743,4,6300269833,"As bad as a man as Shaft is, he wouldn't play with Cleopatra Jones if he thought for one minute she was on her last nerve, and it was shredding fast.

Tamara Dobson portrays a special agent who is busting up a drug pipeline from Turkey to the United States that is operated by Mommy (Shelley Winters). I hope I don't ruin the ending for you, but keep in mind the movie isn't titled, Mommy.

I always found the film a parody of James Bond and the other tough white heroes back in the day who would gently set the lady aside before punching out the villains, with the hero capturing her heart in the end. Cleopatra Jones disarms the bad guys with her charm, but is also cooking up some knuckle sandwiches to take them out with when the time is right.

Dobson does a great job in a role that may have been nearly impossible to pull off well. Such over-the-top characters have to be difficult to portray - there is a fine line between acting well or making the character the buffoonish Rambo - but Dobson does a great job.

The DVD cover is a pretty poor updated version to the original artwork. The movie is from 1973, not 2003 and the artwork should make that point.

If you are looking for a movie that packs a punch, run quickly away from the usual suspects and get Cleopatra Jones.",1171756800,4,1282,4.2809917355371905

290746,5,6300269833,"Tamara Dobson was fabulously stylish, sexy, and intelligent in her role as Cleopatra Jones, the Karate/Kung Fu kicking United States Special Government Agent (""jurisdiction from Turkey to Watts Tower baby"") who battles Drug Lord Mommy (Shelly Winters).  Cleo ruffles Mommy's feathers by burning her Turkish poppy field that has a street value of $30 million.  Mommy retaliates by getting her bad cop friends to bust the B&S House which is run by Cleo's boyfriend Rueben (Bernie Casey).  The B&S House helps local drug addicts kick the habit.  The B&S House staff have a Black Panther Party mentality.

To add action and humor to the movie is Mommy's odd crew of gay beauties that cater to her every whim; clutsy henchmen; Pusher Doodlebug (Antonio Fargas, best known from ""Starsky & Hutch"").  Doodlebug has his own odd crew that includes his high maintenance girlfriend Tiffany (Brenda Sykes, also played in ""Black Gunn""), Pickle (Teddy Wilson who went on to star on tv shows like ""Good Times"", ""That's My Mama"", and ""Sanford & Son""), white chauffer/butler Mattingly (real surname).  Don Corneilus (Soul Train) has a cameo as himself.  Ester Rolle (""Good Times"") has a cameo as the mother of Cleo's two Karate kicking friends, The Johnson Brothers.  This movie has a plethora of actors, both black and white, who went on to have extensive acting careers.

The well written story and screenplay is by Max Julien, who is best known for his role as ""The Mack"" and ""Thomasine & Bushrod"".  The soundtrack yielded two hits, one by Joe Simon and the other by Millie Jackson.

Dobson portrayed a strong black woman with a positive character.  Outside of driving the James Bond type Corvette complete with phone, personalized plates, government issued weapons concealed in the door and a top that automatically raised (awesome in 1973) to accomodate Dobson's 6 foot, 2 inch height... she displayed motor bike riding skills and a little bi-lingual capabilities that must have been needed for her traveling abroad.

The ending scene, the Bon Voyage party for Cleo ends with her white friend Police Captain Lou Crawford (Dan Frazer who has a very extensive acting portfolio with the likes of ""Kojak"", ""Law & Order"", and ""As The World Turns"") saying ""Right On"" while holding up a clinched fist (black power sign) as Cleo drives off into the sunset for her next big assignment.  His actions amaze the other party people and is a priceless ending that should leave a smile on your face to go with this happy ending.

The disconsolate news of Tamara Dobson's death in October 2006 smothered the flames of my nostalgic dreams of her reprising the Cleo role for a third time (second time circa 1975, ""Cleopatra Jones and the Casino of Gold"").  All biographical accounts document Tamara Dobson as having studied fashion at the Maryland Institute College of Arts before her professional modeling career.  Her acting career included film appearances in ""Norman... Is That You?"", ""Chained Heat"", ""Come Back, Charleston Blue"", ""Murder at the World Series"", ""Jason of Star Command"", and ""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century"".  Beyonce appears to have paid homage to ""Cleopatra Jones"" when she played Foxxy Cleopatra in the Austin Powers movie.

Tamara Dobson's role as Cleo was a hit and this movie is a classic that would add value to any so-called blaxploitation (Soul Cinema) era movie collection.

290749,4,6300269833,"Tamara Dobson is no Pam Grier, but she's pretty sexy, and she'll smack the taste right out of your mouth too.  As Cleopatra Jones, she's a special agent on a quest to wipe drugs and drug dealers off the face of the planet.  She pisses off drug kingpin Shelly Winters who wants her reduced to a pile of Cleopatra Bones(sorry), but Cleo is out for vengeance coz Winters messed with her rehab house as well as her man.  This is a pretty cool gem from the Blaxploitation era.  Cleo is a very comic bookish character.  Everyone in town knows her, she has authority over the entire police department, men swoon as she walks by, she has a real telephone in her car, and she knows kung fu.  She has a tendency to yell ""AAAAAAH!"" or ""EEEEEEE-JOOOO!"" every time she hits or kicks anyone.  One villain is Doodlebug, a pimp-like gangster who's obsessed with his hair(In the film ""I'm Gonna Get You Sucka"" he's the guy with the goldfish in his platform shoes that recites the poem ""Bitch Better Have My Money"").  He's a funny, yet creepy looking dude.  Shelly Winters has made a career out of playing grating and annoying characters, and this one suits her perfectly.  She's a lesbian drug lord with bright red hair and a riders crop.  How a woman like this becomes a feared drug queen is anyone's guess coz she's as scary and threatening as the Three Stooges.  Will Cleo kick some butt and make the streets safe again?  Watch it, it's more than worth your time.  Dig?",1134950400,2,1455,4.482889733840304
290750,3,6300269833,"Whenever I think of 1970s blaxploitation films, which is probably far more often than the average moviegoer, my brain instantly kicks calls up several images of the curvaceous Pam Grier. Pam Grier--what a gal! I suspect few women can wear plaid pantsuits with flairs topped off with a three foot Afro as well as the marvelous Grier. ""Coffy"" and ""Foxy Brown,"" the two Grier films that kicked the blaxploitation genre into high gear back in the early 1970s, are masterpieces that still endlessly entertain today thanks to her magnetic screen charisma. Sure, her acting chops weren't the best, but the scripts wouldn't win any awards either. Blaxploitation succeeded for several reasons, the most important of which was showing African-American characters fighting to defeat racist and corrupt social institutions on behalf of all citizens. Another element key to the triumph of this intriguing genre is somewhat seedier: the action sequences in these films drew in viewers of all races who hungered for over the top violence delivered in a raw, no holds barred manner. Predictably, the appeal of these low budget films had everyone jumping on the bandwagon for their piece of the pie. Cue ""Cleopatra Jones.""

""Jones"" is a different creature altogether, an anomaly in blaxploitation in that it carries a 'PG' rating and its main character works inside the system. Many of the themes, however, are the same. Cleopatra Jones (Tamara Dobson) is a globetrotting government agent with a penchant for fine clothes and finer cars. The film opens with her overseeing the destruction of several poppy fields overseas, poppy fields that supply a lot of the heroin that finds its way back to the streets of America and into the hands of an evil woman named Mommy (Shelley Winters). Predictably, Mommy expresses dismay over Jones's latest activities and vows revenge. In order to lure Cleopatra back to the States, Mommy comes up with an interesting (and convoluted) plan involving a drug rehabilitation house run by Jones's caring boyfriend Reuben (Bernie Casey). The cops burst into the building with vague accusations about drugs on the premises and predictably find them. Of course, these crooked cops planted the narcotics at the behest of the infernal Mommy. Cleopatra swoops into town to set things straight with her Afro, an ultra cool car with weapons stashed in the door panels, and karate moves that would make Chuck Norris blanch.

With the help of informant Mrs. Johnson (Esther Rolle!), a couple of kung fu toughs, and an honest cop Cleopatra prepares to kick some serious you know what. Her task won't be easy. Mommy's temper assumes legendary proportions as she screeches, threatens her underlings, and works her way through several garish wigs that may well give Cleopatra's Afro some serious competition. In no time at all Mommy is sending out waves of goons to drop the hammer on our heroine. A fairly slick car chase ensues, which Jones easily wins thanks to her souped up Corvette. An assassination attempt involving several heavily armed thugs--you've got to see their disguises to believe it--also comes to naught. What is it going to take to bring down Cleopatra Jones? A lot more than Mommy can muster, apparently. The movie closes with a battle sequence rivaling anything seen in any of the Star Wars films as Jones and Mommy, along with many underlings, square off at an auto junkyard. Of course we know who'll win before the first fist flies, but the scene is important because it's quite entertaining to watch Shelley Winters fall down. Rest assured that all will end well, the bad guys will go to jail forever, and Cleopatra will continue to bring down the baddies here and abroad.

""Cleopatra Jones"" is surprising in that the movie contains quite a few developed characters and some rather complex plot threads. Unfortunately, it's not a great movie in any way, shape, or form due to a number of reasons. One is Dobson's horrible acting ability; she makes an early Pam Grier performance look Oscar worthy by comparison. Moreover, her kung fu moves resemble more a series of laughably spastic movements than a serious form of martial arts. If these are the sorts of moves taught by instructors at Quantico, no wonder we're losing the war on drugs. The movie's biggest crime is shooting for a 'PG' rating, virtually assuring that the sort of gritty violence usually found in blaxploitation films is sorely missing. But there are a few positives here--well, one positive known as Shelley Winters. I've gotten a big kick out of watching this giant ham ply her trade in potboiler schlock like ""What's the Matter with Helen?"" and ""Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?"" and it's no different here. Winters chucks nuance out the window as the power mad Mommy, and it's a treat to watch. Although the procession of young woman through Mommy's headquarters hints at an unsavory theme that should not be in a 'PG' film, Winters nonetheless carries the film. Look for Antonio Fargas in the small but critical role of Doodlebug, an employee of Mommy who rebels much to his detriment.

While ""Cleopatra Jones"" will never hold a candle to Pam Grier's sleazy triumphs, it is a genre staple most people seem to know about. An interesting aside: Dan Ackroyd made a film in the 1980s called ""Doctor Detroit"" in which he stole considerable elements from this movie. The villain in that film also went by the name of Mom, and the final scene was a knock down drag out fight in (you guessed it) an auto junkyard. What goes around comes around, I guess. Sadly, the ""Cleopatra Jones"" DVD contains no extras, not even a trailer, and although I found the film pedestrian I would have liked to see a commentary track and maybe some interviews with the principal actors. Give this one a shot if you're interested in journeying through the hilarious world of blaxploitation.",1111190400,3,5849,4.93502538071066
290751,4,6300269833,"I have loved this movie for a very long time,
and no matter what your movie tastes may be,
this movie is very entertaining. In this film,
what has always interested me most was how,
in 1973 of all times, a black woman was able to
flex so much power in a government agency.
Cleopatra Jones moves with such grace and
power you'd think the FBI worked for her.

Nonetheless Tamara Dobson is a refreshing
alternative to the fierce and sometime maniacal
characters portrayed by Pam Grier. While both actresses
displayed power, Dobson comes across more classy
and refined, whereas Grier wasted no time getting
down and dirty. This movie is not high cinema, but
it is by far one of the best films of the blaxploitation genre. If you have little or no experience with the
genre, ""Cleopatra Jones"" raises the bar astronomically and
everything afterwards will be a staggering disapointment.
I wish there were more action, and the martial arts
sequences are laughable at best (trademark blaxploitation).

This is a very fun film, not to be taken too
seriously. I would recommend it just for the
sake of watching Dobson in action. I have never
seen anyone else in films who is as captivating.
Mind you, I said captivating, not beautiful
(although she is that and more). Beautiful
actresses are a dime a dozen, but
how many of them could make you turn the volume
down completely and be content just with watching her
graceful movements and total control of every
scene. Not many.  Tamara Dobson is a delight in
this film, and in the sequel, Cleopatra Jones and
the Casino of Gold. I wish she had been more
succesful in her acting efforts, but at least
this film stands as a gem of the blaxploitation era.",1107820800,2,1690,4.645484949832776
