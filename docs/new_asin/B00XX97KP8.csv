7203650,5,B00XX97KP8,"This is one of the best anime I have ever seen and I am so happy the bluray collection is finally here! For whatever reason, the picture shown is not the same as the picture on the box (which I provided a picture of). The cd art is also pretty lacking, but whatever, I'm not buying this for pretty cds.",1439856000,44,302,4.05
7203651,5,B00XX97KP8,"I love this series so much!! Heres my reasons why!

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers only) The story beings with a 14 year old boy named Yukiteru Amano aka Yuki. Yuiki is a loner who writes in his cell phone diary about his day and what goes on around him. His parents are mostly never around so hes alone most of the time. When hes alone at home he goes into his own little world in his head to talk to his imaginary friend Deus (full name Deus Ex Machina). The next day when he wakes up he finds his phone already having been written in it about the future, as he does his normal stuff he finds out that everything written in his diary comes true. When he is leaving school he is followed by a girl named Yuno Gasai whos phone also tells the future. After an insident with Yuki and Yuno, they both get transported into Deus's world where Yuki finds out that his Imaginary friend isn't really imaginary at all, that is because Deus is really god/the creator/the bender of time, space and reality/the one who can do anything and no one can oppose him. Along with Yuki and Yuno, 10 other people appear in Deus's world and are all told that they are in a last man standing death match where 12 people go in and 1 comes out alive, the winner takes over Deus's spot as god and can do anything their heart desires.

Pros: The story is so amazing!! I was sucked into it at minuet 1 because it keeps you guessing what happens next and never ever ever gets boring. All the characters are very well made up, the voice actors are amazing and they put their souls into making it amazing! The comedy hits at the right moments to really make you LOL. The action is first rate, you are taking twists and turns like no tommrow and its all exciting. This is 100% UNCENSORED and UNCUT, so you hear all the swearing and blood and violence that there should be in here. It comes with all 26 episodes

Cons: sadly NO OVA with this on. Sorry :(

How it differes from the Limited edition series: this contains all the episodes, and it comes in one box. I like the limited edition version better because it came with a hard cardboard box to fit both parts 1 and 2 inside the box. This one is also nice because its the only blu-ray edition of this out there for now

Side note: I'm just warning you that this series is quite bloody, people are dieing in many ways and blood gets spilt everywhere, if you are NOT a blood fan than this series may not be for you.

Overall: I LOVE THIS SERIES!! BUY IT!!",1439510400,3,2480,4.232558139534884
7203652,5,B00XX97KP8,"I've been waiting so long for a Blu-Ray Release for this series. It's also awesome that it's not broken into two parts like the DVD release was. So as a product this could not be better (OVA notwithstanding).

As for the show, hopefully most folks will have heard of it by now, but to simplify and avoid spoilers: It's essentially a Hunger Games/Battle Royale setup with a twist- each contestant has a ""Diary"" that can see into the future in a unique way. The winner gets to be the new God (or Deus in this show). I don't want to say more about the plot, but I will say this show as pretty damn great character development and one of the few wonderful relationship developments in all of anime. Definitely worth buying.

P.S. Yuno is crazy awesome.",1438732800,13,748,4.452554744525547

7203661,5,B00XX97KP8,"Likely one of the best shows of it's kind out there.
I've seen shows where the boy tries to win the girl who is strong and willing to kill cause she has to do it. This isn't one of those shows.
I've seen two lovers fight for the love they share from the very start never being able to love deeper. This isn't one of those shows.
This is a show of boy is somewhat drawn to a girl that will kill anyone and everyone that tries to keep them apart. Insane is putting it mildly for this girl. never have to worry with her cheating on you but love is far from normal here. That said you still want to see the two of them make it together. Now the sad part, there is one more show out there that isn't in this set. Not only that but I can't find a dub of it anywhere. There is a copy of it out there with English subtitles though.
Killer Series in more ways then one.",1505001600,,860,3.8920454545454546

7203672,5,B00XX97KP8,"This anime is a very interesting one that somehow perfectly mixed romance, gore, and drama. It will show you something very intense such as classrooms full of kids being blown up, then transition to something sweet long enough for you to drop your guard, only to surprise you with more gore. This is obviously not a starter anime at all, and should be seen with the utmost caution. You have been warned.",1481587200,4,403,4.611111111111111
7203673,2,B00XX97KP8,"I've watched plenty of anime series since I was young, but among all of those gems... Future Diary is one of only two that I'm not fond of. Here's my pro's and con's for this anime:

Pro's: Beautiful two openings and one ending done by Yousei Teikoku; just one of two things I DID like about this series! The other is Yuno Gasai's character... she definitely captures the Yandere stereotype, and because of her sweet, outward appearance, you wouldn't expect her to really be a homicidal psychopath! (If the series was about her, I'd probably be more interested in this franchise, because she's more of a hardcore, unexpected protagonist than the leading man -_-)

Con's: First off, Yuki's CHARACTER!!! He just comes across as one of those wimpy protagonists with no valuable qualities. I mean, he's so much of a wimp, that he tends to rely on Yuno to get out of a grisly situation alive!!

His mom also acts nonchalant about his ""relationship"" with Yuno, and encourages him to eventually marry her - especially sleep in the same room with her. Not to mention, whenever a catastrophic incident takes place - like Yuki's school being bombed - the citizens just act nonchalant.

This is one anime/manga series that suffers from poor character development, a tangled plot, the main character making TOO MANY foolish decisions, and far too many plot holes. I only gave this review 2 stars instead of one ONLY for the few pros I gave in the above section!",1481155200,,1449,4.738095238095238

I must admit, I received a different expectation when I read a brief summary of the series. The iconic image at the end of episode one would be enough to make new anime viewers run in terror. But i saw the entire show to the very end.

While it is a bit of a psychological thriller, it does have some rather deep, emotional, and meaningful moments.

I would highly recommend checking it out.",1474761600,,570,4.461538461538462
7203677,5,B00XX97KP8,This anime was great! It starts out steady but slowly rolls down hill full throttle with the e-break disabled and the break lines severed. There's no stopping it.

This psychological thriller, based on the manga written and illustrated by Sakae Esuno, is about Yuki, a loner who's not very good with people. He prefers to write a diary on his cell phone and talk to his imaginary friend, Deus Ex Machina  The God of Time and Space. However, Yuki soon learns that Deus is more than a figment of his imagination when he makes Yuki participate in a battle royale with eleven others.

7203719,5,B00XX97KP8,"I don't make reviews often but I had to for this show but nonetheless, I will keep it pretty simple and spoiler-free.

This anime has a simple enough premise: Win the game by being the last one standing and become the next God. The two characters you see in this cover are Yukiteru Amano (The boy who's blushing and a little freaked out) and Yuno Gasai (The pink haired one who looks like she's having a blast). Both of these characters are essentially the main protagonists and you will be following them as they try to survive against the other opponents and hopefully win the game. I won't go into further about the plot because anymore is redundant and anything that isn't will be a spoil, but I do want to mention something that made me love this show.

The character interaction in this show is amazing. They start off very familiar but they are truly anything but that. Every one of the characters who are in the game are different from each other, both in motivation and in methodology. These characters also do something that a lot of anime don't, and that is they allow even the most unrelated characters to interact with each other in entertaining ways.

Overall this show is something that will be entertaining almost to every one and is really just an all around great anime, with the only weakness being in one character: Yuki. He is someone I tend to love, then hate, then love again (not in that order). Without being too critical I will say that his character is a very pathetic one, with his every motivation being based off very bad naivety or something else equally annoying(again trying to avoid spoilers). Depending on your personal preferences Yuki will be someone you will admonish by the end or continue to remember as someone who was annoying. To this day I am still mixed.",1445817600,,1799,4.598130841121495

7203725,5,B00XX97KP8,"Future DIary is one of the most unique animes I've seen.  The story involves Yuki, who is the protagonist of the story who is somehow entered in a contest in which one of the main assets to helping him win is a Future Diary which essentially tells him which is going to happen in the future!  To win he has to kill all the other contestants. The winner becomes God!

He teams up with another Future Diary owner Yuno Gasai.  Yuno is one of the most complicated characters I've seen in any form of entertainment, let along anime.  You don't know whether to love her, hate her or what she is?  The show is bloody, violent, crazy, scary and romantic at the same time.  It's a great series.",1442188800,,685,4.3046875

7203729,5,B00XX97KP8,Smart show with some incredible twist.  Give it a shot.,1440979200,,55,4.5
7203730,5,B00XX97KP8,"I had not heard of this anime until very recently. I enjoy battle royale and death note, so I bought it on a whim.

This anime kept me guessing the whole time what would happen next. It's story, writing, and english voice acting are top notch.  The series demands multiple viewings.

This is a great anime if you like death note, battle royale, or hunger games. This is intended for mature audiences though.",1440806400,,407,4.5479452054794525
7203731,5,B00XX97KP8,"I've been watching anime for nearly 20 years now, and while I have plenty of favorites in different genres, ""The Future Diary"" is probably the all-around best one I've ever watched. It's heart-poundingly suspenseful, utterly creative, and operates on a sort of ""nightmare logic"" that draws you on like very little else out there.

The official product description is excellent, so I won't rehash that and will just jump into what makes this series so freaking good. Essentially, ""The Future Diary"" has two core story elements: the survival game and a twisted love story. The survival game element is similar to ""Battle Royale"" and ""Hunger Games"" in that a crew of strangers have been pitted against one another in a battle to the death -- this time by no less than the god of space and time. The human element in the story, Yuki's battle to maintain morality and decency in a Hobbesian ""kill everyone"" nightmare, will be familiar to fans of this setup, and this show pulls it off very well. Where ""Future Diary"" diverges from (and surpasses) those others is the eclectic weirdness of the contestants and the creativity of their weapons. Each contestant is given a ""future diary,"" a record of the immediate future that allows them to see attacks coming... but no two work the same. Yuki's tells everything except what affects him personally. Another diary displays a record of the activities of victims, and yet another only maps out escape routes. These diaries are wielded by a crew of deranged weirdos, mostly, but also by a few noble and decent people drawn into something awful. You will care deeply about the cast, and many of your long-term favorites will likely be people you least expect. Expect to cry like a baby when they get violently offed.

The second core element, the twisted love story, somehow manages to be one of the best romances in animation despite being deeply disturbing. Yuno loves Yuki to distraction, and at first he's flattered by this, but the more he learns about his would-be girlfriend, the more terrified he becomes of her. Yuno is worryingly good at killing people, and pretty-much unfazed by doing it. It soon becomes clear that this pink-haired cutie may be the scariest contestant of them all, and she can seldom be trusted to do the right thing. But this is literally a ""can't live with her, can't live without her"" situation, made all the more painful by the fact that there's genuine affection between this couple despite the deep distrust. Several massive plot twists occur that make the prospect of long-term happiness bleaker and bleaker, but the whole time, you, the viewer, start to subconsciously root for ""Yuki X Yuno"" to make it. And when it all wraps up, you... well, I won't spoil it. But reference the ""cry like a baby"" part above. Your heartstrings will be bent all out of shape, but it will be totally worth it.

I also wanted to give special props to the music, which is beautiful and always hits the right emotional notes for the scenes it accompanies. This release also contains both subtitled and English-dubbed vocal tracks, and the latter is really, really good. Though this is always a matter of debate, I feel the English voice actors surpassed their Japanese originals in almost every case here. The English voice actors and actresses for Yuki, Yuno, Minene, and Murmur deserve special props for quality.

This particular release (whole series on Blu-Ray) is well-worth buying if you haven't previously purchased the two DVD sets -- it's cheaper, and the Blu-Ray quality ensures higher-fidelity picture. If you do already have the DVDs, though, the motive for buying this new set is less clear. There have been zero new extras added to this new release, and it has no ""collector's-edition"" style bells and whistles. Most aggravatingly, it doesn't include the ""Future Diary: Redial"" OVA which has been out for several years in Japan but has never made it into a release in the English-language market. ""Redial"" does a great job explaining the abrupt and confusing last few seconds of the anime, so it would have been a wonderful inclusion to this set. Its continued absence from Funimation's release, even after the passage of several years, is sort of baffling and is perhaps the only let-down of this set.

All the same, if ""Future Diary"" isn't part of your collection yet, you owe it to yourself to pick it up, and this is the most affordable and high-quality way to do it. As a parting anecdote, this is one of the few anime I have always had success hooking non-anime-fans with once I explain the premise. A coworker who wouldn't be caught dead watching ""cartoons"" asked me for an update on the plot every day when I came to work while I was watching it. It's simply that good... CRAZY good!",1440547200,34,4758,4.797560975609756
7203732,5,B00XX97KP8,"Although this show may not be for everyone, i have found myself loving this show. The anime itself is action packed, intense, bloody, yet still can find in it some humor and moments filled with deep and complex emotion. The characters itself are fun and not at all one dimensional due to the fact we are able to see some of their backstories throughout the series. However, for me, the main attraction of this show was the weird but fun chemistry that the main characters Yuno and Yuuki have throughout the course of the show. Definitely worth the buy for the blu ray quality , but it is disappointing to learn the ova will not be included.",1439856000,,640,4.478632478632479
