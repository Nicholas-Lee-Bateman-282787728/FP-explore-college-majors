2616936,5,B000GRUQJW,"Being a fan of early cinema and unusual films with clever plots, I was particularly pleased with this set of 6 films; packed neatly in slim cases with nice artwork and bonus features such as expert commentary to 5 of the 6 films.  Each film is different and has its own unique highlights; some of which are obvious due to the legendary stars in each one; others are brought out in the audio commentary track which also gives excellent background information on the film's cast and crew, as well as the film industry and newly-emerging Horror genre in general.  Although the cover boasts ""6 Masterworks of Terror"", it's unlikely that any modern-day viewer would find them terrifying, but no doubt for audiences of the 1930s these films were quite a sensation, and due to their high quality of production, direction or acting, can rightly be viewed as classics or prime examples of 1930s horror/thriller/mystery movies.

Far more than merely intending to shock and frighten audiences, these films still have a busy plot and interesting story, albeit unrealistic and even a bit silly at times.  My personal favourites are ""Mad Love"", based on an earlier silent film, ""The Hands of Orlac"" about transplanting the hands of an executed murderer onto a pianist whose hands were injured in an accident, (echoes of Frankenstein here) and although the story is interesting enough in itself, Peter Lorre is simply brilliant as the mad doctor.  His uncanny bald-headed appearance is already unnerving, and he uses his foreign accent to its absolute creepiest effect.  And in the same league, Boris Karloff as the evil Fu Manchu is the best I've seen him so far, making this exaggerated character almost believable, and certainly very entertaining.  I found the commentary to ""The Mask of Fu Manchu"" particularly interesting for its detailed explanations of censorship and how many scenes had been removed at some time.  Fortunately, this is the complete and restored version, and putting political correctness aside, simply great fun to watch.

Another personal favourite is ""The Return of Doctor X"" with Humphrey Bogart in an early role before he found fame when he usually played the role of a villain.  In this film he is very convincing as the strange, pale-faced doctor's assistant, experimenting with the use of synthetic blood to restore and sustain life - some intriguing ideas taken from both scientific work and the vampire legends.  I also enjoyed the commentary to this movie which features a lengthy interview with the film's director, Vincent Sherman, who at age 99 can still vividly recall and tell of his experiences in early Hollywood.  Also very intriguing and worth mentioning is ""Mark of the Vampire"" which is a remake of a lost silent film ""London After Midnight"" starring the legendary Lon Chaney, but is not at all what one would expect of a Chaney film.  In fact, ""Mark of the Vampire"" is meant to keep you wondering and guessing til the very end; much in the same vein as ""Cat and the Canary"" and other slightly comical mystery whodunits.  Last but not least, Lionel Barrymore puts in a very entertaining performance in his old woman disguise as he plots revenge on former associates with the means of more freaky science in ""The Devil Doll"".  Sound and picture quality on all 3 discs is very good, and I'm sure this set will satisfy most early cinema or 1930s film enthusiasts, not to mention horror-genre fans as well, of course.",1162857600,19,3444,4.913793103448276
2616937,5,B000GRUQJW,"'The Hollywood Legends of Horror Collection' (2006) offers viewers six excellent little-seen thrillers from the classic Hollywood era; as a set, it in many ways surpasses 2005's 'The Val Lewton Horror Collection' in quality.

Though Jacque Tourneur and Val Lewton's 'Cat People' (1942) is generally credited with introducing monsters and horror to the modern urban landscape, Michael Curtiz's atmospheric 'Doctor X' (1932) proves this assertion to be untrue.

Produced in an era before the Hays Code was enforced, 'Doctor X' concerns a series of strangulation murders in New York City and Long Island in which the killer partially cannibalizes his victim's bodies. Known in the press as ""the Moon Murderer"" due to the period of the month during which he is active, the killer's eventual unmasking and subsequent transformation into the ""Moon Monster"" is still chilling today. Though the murderer's explanation for his actions seem both forced and unnecessary, the version offered here was printed in an early, eerie version of Technicolor, making a film already long on shadows also weirdly tinted in shades of green, red, and yellow.

Curtiz, of course, would go on to direct 'The Adventures of Robin Hood' (1938), 'Casablanca' (1942), 'Mildred Pierce' (1945) and 'White Christmas' (1954). A fairly young Lionel Atwill stars as the title doctor, and Fay Wray as his daughter.

Also produced by First National/Warner Brothers, 'The Return of Doctor X' (1939) is a sequel to 'Doctor X' in name only. Humphrey Bogart, who seems to be channeling Andy Warhol in several early scenes, stars as a murderer revived from the dead and now badly in need of continuous transfusions of a rare type of blood. Also starring Dennis Morgan before he rose to stardom as one of the most popular leading men of the 1940s, 'The Return of Doctor X' is a surprisingly well-made and effective thriller.

Interestingly, the original film trailer, which is present as an extra feature, shows numerous scenes not included in the final cut, suggesting that the producers originally had quite a different film in mind.

Also produced during the pre-Hays era, MGM's 'The Mask of Fu Manchu' (1932) stars the post-Frankenstein Boris Karloff as the would-be Asian world-conqueror and Myra Loy as his beautiful but perverse daughter, Fah Lo See. Beautifully produced but anti-climatic, the film is remarkable for its sexual undertones, including the homoerotic scene in which the athletically-built Charles Starrett, who portrays the young hero, writhes under torture while strapped to a table and wearing nothing but a scanty loincloth.

Tod Browning and MGM's quirky 'The Mark of the Vampire' (1935) is a fascinatingly disjointed and almost surreal remake of Browning's now-lost silent film, 'London After Midnight' (1927). Starring Lionel Barrymore, Lionel Atwill, and Bela Lugosi, who only has several actual lines of dialogue, the film is actually a murder mystery disguised as a horror movie, and one which continuously cheats at the misleading game it plays with its audience.

However, instead of detracting from the finished product, Browning's mischievous use of the editing process and evident joy in subverting viewer expectations make 'The Mark of the Vampire' a horror film classic. Visually stunning throughout, the father-and-daughter vampire team, as depicted by Lugosi and Carroll Borland, remain one of the archetypal representations of the vampire in cinema.

MGM's ghoulish 'Mad Love' (1935) stars Peter Lorre as love-obsessed surgeon Dr. Gogol and Colin Clive as Stephen Orlac, a world-renowned concert pianist who loses his hands in a train accident. When Lorre, who is in passionately in love with Orlac's beautiful wife, Yvonne, is called in to operate, he replaces the pianist's crushed hands with those of a recently-executed murderer whose specialty was knife-wielding. Before long, Orlac has the uncontrollable desire to kill, and Gogol, who keeps a life-size wax effigy of Yvonne in his home, hopes an imprisoned Orlac will finally make Yvonne available to become his bride.

The brief scene in which Orlac confronts what he believes is the reanimated figure of the decapitated and now-handless murderer is one of the great moments of 1930s horror. The film was a critical and popular failure upon release, though Lorre excels as the pathetic, love-sick Gogol, as does Clive as the potentially neurotic pianist, and lovely Frances Drake is extremely impressive as the devoted Yvonne.

The collection is rounded out by the wonderful special-effects extravaganza 'The Devil Doll' (1936), produced by MGM and again directed by Tod Browning. Equal parts fantasy, science fiction, and thriller, Lionel Barrymore stars as wrongfully-accused banker Paul Lavond, who escapes from Devil's Island and subsequently disguises himself as an elderly female Parisian doll maker.

Having discovered how to miniaturize and mentally control human beings from an eccentric husband and wife scientist team who hope to save the world by ending starvation, Lavond sends a pair of 8-inch apache dancers out on missions of revenge, robbery, and murder, before being exonerated and reunited with his daughter, Lorraine, portrayed by the lovely Maureen O'Sullivan.

'The Hollywood Legends of Horror Collection' is an extremely satisfying set of horror and 'fantastic' films. The screenwriting, acting, directing, photography, art direction, and set design for all six films are exquisite.

Hopefully, the success of this collection, as well as that of the earlier 'The Val Lewton Horror Collection,' will see further collections become available. Still awaiting collection are James Whale and Universal's 'The Old Dark House' (1932), 'White Zombie' starring Bela Lugosi (1932), and Michael Curtiz's 'The Mystery of the Wax Museum,' among many others of the classic era.",1161648000,10,5840,5.389254385964913
2616938,5,B000GRUQJW,"This is a great bargain, a collection of various classic horror films when art design, music and acting were counted on to provide the atmosphere instead of the sophisticated cartooning of computer generation. The greatest here is Peter Lorre in his best US performance in ""Mad Love"", filmed as if it were a Murnau German silent and the template visually for much of ""Citizen Kane"" (in particular Welles lifted the parrot). Worth the price of admission alone.

""Devil Doll"" and ""Mark of the Vampire"" are actually better films by Todd Browning than his ""Dracula"", though not up to his Lon Chaney silent masterpieces. ""Mark"" was a remake of the lost Chaney ""London After Midnight"", though seeing the still reconstruction of that it is probably superior. The end will not thrill die-hard horror fans but Lugosi is actually better here, if less screen time, than in his signature role. ""Devil Doll"" gives Lionel Barrymore (in one of his last standing roles) a chance to do drag, and the acting and period special effects lift what could be a potboiler of a story. There is real emotion in it, rare for a horror film. Rare for Browning, too.

""Doctor X"" is exemplory in its early use of Technicolor, and that floats it alone. The sequel is fun to watch Bogart try to be a ghoul - he's much more frightening without the dead makeup in ""Sabrina"".

""The Mask of Fu Manchu"" should be off-putting in its ugly xenophobia, depicting an Oriental monster bent on destroying the white race. But Karloff and Myra Loy (barely recognizable as his succubus daughter) dig so deep into their talents to play their parts that somehow they take the curse off the material, even now. Kinky Art Nouveau racist horror - I'll take it over ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" any day.

Which begs the question now - where is ""Island of the Lost Souls"" with Charles Laughton and the original ""Wax Museum""?",1161043200,6,1870,4.7446153846153845
2616939,4,B000GRUQJW,"From the moment LEGENDS OF HORROR was announced I was looking forward to it with great expectation but I already had a few qualms regarding it. As has been well covered elsewhere Boris Karloff's THE WALKING DEAD from 1936 should have been included in the set but I can live with THE RETURN OF DOCTOR X for a few reasons. 1) It does offer Humphrey Bogart the opportunity to show what a good actor can do with what for him was a thankless role. 2) The director Vincent Sherman was still alive to provide commentary on the making of the film as well as background on Bogie and others. 3) Most important of all it shows how censorship imposed on the movies in 1934 changed the style and content of the first great cycle of horror films.

The way the films are coupled is another issue. I understand the reasons for coupling Karloff and Lugosi together from a marketing standpoint but thematically MARK OF THE VAMPIRE should have been coupled with THE DEVIL DOLL as both are Tod Browning films which were heavily cut by MGM reflecting the aftermath of the FREAKS debacle. THE MASK OF FU MANCHU and MAD LOVE would have fit together nicely as portraits of over the top manaical mad doctors which are beautifully photographed with fascinating art direction.

Finally there are the commentaries themselves. I have already talked about Vincent Sherman on RETURN OF DOCTOR X as being of historical interest. The other commentaries are a mixed bag. Greg Mank's one for THE MASK OF FU MANCHU is a prime example of how it should be done. He is obviously watching the film as he narrates telling us what to look and listen for which greatly enhances the viewing experience. On the other hand Kim Newman's and Steve Jones' commentary on MARK OF THE VAMPIRE, while demonstrating that they know their stuff, comes across as very distracting as they don't coordinate what they are saying with what is going on during the film. And why is there no commentary for THE DEVIL DOLL? It was Tod Browning's last great film and has a colorful history of its own (it's a curious combination of Browning's THE UNHOLY THREE and THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO).

Nevertheless this is a first rate set of rarely seen 1930's horror films done the way it should be that no early horror fan should be without. It is attractively packaged and features great transfers for the most part (the color print of DOCTOR X looks as good as can be expected). It's also a joy to have the 6 minutes of censored footage restored to THE MASK OF FU MANCHU in all of its politically incorrect glory. Now Warners should get to work on Volume 2 with the same sort of packaging. It could include THE WALKING DEAD, MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM, KONGO (or better yet a restored version of WEST OF ZANZIBAR), FREAKS, and a double feature of John Barrymore's SVENGALI and THE MAD GENIUS.",1160784000,8,2821,4.571146245059288
2616940,5,B000GRUQJW,"Everyone has already covered this one well.  A couple of notes about the prints, though.  DR. X(1932) is taken from an original 2 strip Technicolor print restored by the UCLA Film & Television Archive.  Warner chose to include the print, which is far from perfect, so that we can see it in the original 2 strip color.  Apparently, the Warner archive contains only a B/W print of this film.  The UCLA print is very rare and is a treasure.  Same can be said for MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM(1933), available on the flipside of the separately available HOUSE OF WAX(1953) DVD.

MASK OF FU MANCHU(1932) contains some previously censored materials, which is an updated print compared to the previous video incarnations.

RETURN OF DR. X(1939), which I agree has nothing to do with DR. X(1932), is a nice addition.  A very unusual role for Bogart, who apparently hated this film.

Glad that Warner has released these on DVD.  Not the best horror, by any means, but some interesting films with interesting casts.",1160524800,9,1002,4.767441860465116
2616941,4,B000GRUQJW,"Warner's was headed in the right direction with this collection of classic horror, but somehow ""The Return of Dr. X"" was considered a ""classic"" when it's not. The only thing to really recommend this low budget thriller was the early film appearance of a young Humphrey Bogart as the mad doctor. And it has nothing to do with the included 1932 ""Dr. X"". This pre-code film is a classic although a creaky one. It's filmed in the early two-tone Technicolor and features some wonderfully bizarre sets and a grisly plot line involving mutilation and cannibalism. It also features Fay Wray and Lionel Atwill and a truly wild transformation scene with Preston Foster turning himself into the ""full moon killer"" via ""synthetic flesh"". Unfortunately, there's too much comedy relief and the print is scratched throughout. That's a bummer because the story itself is fun and I could only imagine what a great experience it would be with a good clean print. Still, it's a must see for the positives that I have mentioned. My next favorite is 1935's ""Mad Love"" with the great Peter Lorre as the mad Dr. Gogol menacing Frances Drake and tormenting Colin Clive. It's a beautiful print and worth the wait to have it on DVD. The films come two to a disc with each disc in it's own neat slim keep case with the original poster art on the covers for each film. The other films are fun too with wonderful casts ( Barrymore, Lugosi, Karloff et al.) and look good. All the films have commentaries. My only wishes were a better print of ""Dr. X"" and 1933's ""Island of Lost Souls"" included instead of ""Return of Dr. X"". Now, THAT would have been a classic horror collection. But it's still a worthwhile investment for classic horror lovers.  Enjoy.",1160524800,4,1722,4.683168316831683
2616942,5,B000GRUQJW,"This is a wonderful collection of horror pictures made by MGM and Warner Brothers during the Thirties. Neither studio was noted for horror pictures, but the ones they did make are unforgettable to fans of the genre as well as late night movie addicts. Following is a synopsis of the films contained in the collection:

THE MASK OF FU MANCHU (MGM, 1932) - Boris Karloff is wonderfully creepy as Sax Rohmer's evil genius, Dr. Fu Manchu. It would not be the last time Karloff played a Chinese, as he later starred as Mr. Wong in Monogram's low budget detective series later in the decade.  The plot concerns a race between good guy Lewis Stone and Fu Manchu to find the tomb of Ghengis Khan. If Fu Manchu gets there first he will possess the magical relics placed there which, in turn, will allow him to enslave the world. Look for a young Myrna Loy in a delightful turn as Fu's diabolical, and scantily-clad, daughter.

DOCTOR X (WB, 1932) - A good early effort by Michael Curtiz concerning the ""Moon Killer"" murders in which the victims are strangled, cannibalized and surgically dissected under the light of the full moon. Wise-cracking reporter Lee Tracy traces the clues to a spooky seaside mansion, where Dr. Xavier (Lionel Atwill) and his colleagues are conducting strange experiments. Made in early two-strip Technicolor, the film is wonderfully atmospheric, and the sets themselves will linger in your mind. Aside from the irritating Lee Tracy as reporter Lee Taylor, the acting is crisp and to the point. Atwill in particular is eerie. Fay Wray is good as Xavier's daughter. I won't give any more of the plot away, but just remember the phrase ""synthetic flash."" Once heard, it will linger in the mind always.

MARK OF THE VAMPIRE (MGM, 1935) - Tod Browning's remake of his ""London After Midnight"" with Bela Lugosi as the vampire, Count Mora, and Lionel Atwill as Inspector Newman. In the original, both roles were played by Lon Chaney. The plot concerns the death of Sir Karell Borotyn, who appears to have been killed by vampire Count Mora. Fearing that the vampire's next victim will be Borotyn's daughter, Irena (Elizabeth Allan), vampire expert Professor Zelen (Lionel Barrymore) is called I to protect her and shed some light on the goings-on. Look for Carroll Borland as the Count's daughter (a role played by Edna Tichenor in the original).

MAD LOVE (MGM, 1935) - One of the great plots in horror film history, and one that has been repeated many times. Colin Clive plays the brilliant concert pianist Stephen Orlac, whose hands are crushed in a train accident. His wife, Yvonne, is a noted stage actress whose ardent admirer is Dr. Gogol (Peter Lorre). Although she rejected Gogol previously, she is forced to seek his help in restoring her husband's hands. Gogol replaces Orlac's hands with those of executed knife thrower Rollo, and the fun begins. Clive is his usual tortured, neurotic self and Lorre is brilliant as the oily monomaniacal Gogol. Pauline Keal, in her book on Citizen Kane, stated that Welles copied Lorre's look for the older Kane.

THE DEVIL DOLL (MGM, 1936) - Tod Browning's last great film is about as respected Parisian banker (Lionel Barrymore), who is framed for robbery and murder and sent to Devil's Island. Years later he escapes in the company of a scientist who has discovered a way to shrink living things to one-sixth their original size. Barrymore finds a new use for the scientist's discovery as a means of revenge on those who had framed him.

THE RETURN OF DOCTOR X (WB, 1939) - The famous Humphrey Bogart punishment picture! After years of complaining about his one-dimensional gangster roles, it was said that Jack Warner decided to teach Bogie a lesson and put him in the role of a vampiric lab assistant who needs freshly drained blood in order to stay alive. Bogart is a hoot in pasty-faced white makeup and a grey streak through his hair. Wayne Morris play the wise-cracking reporter who exposes Bogie as the killer. (Tough job considering the makeup). Look for Olin Howard (Jensen the drunk in Them! and the Blob's first victim) as the undertaker. This film has never before been released on either VHS or DVD, so it is a welcome find for horror fans and Bogart fans as well",1155168000,107,4234,4.791780821917809
2616943,5,B000GRUQJW,"Classic horror fans should grab Warner Bros up-coming ""Hollywood Legends of Horror"" collection, featuring 6 classics ""new to dvd,"" including my personal favorite, ""Mark of the Vampire"" coming October 10, 2006!  Titles include:

""The Devil Doll"" (1936): Paul Lavond (Lionel Barrymore) was a respected banker in Paris when he was framed for robbery and murder by crooked associates and sent to Devil's Island. Years later, he escapes with a friend, a scientist who was working on a method to reduce humans to a height of mere inches (all for the good of humanity, of course). Lavond however is consumed with hatred for the men who betrayed him, and takes the scientist's methods back to Paris to exact painful revenge.

""Dr. X"" (1932): A monster lurks as New York newspaperman Lee Taylor (Lee Tracy) investigates one of the ""Moon Killer"" murders, in which the victims are strangled, cannibalized and surgically incised under the light of the full moon. The trail leads to the cliff side mansion of Dr. Xavier (Lionel Atwill), where the doctor and his colleagues conduct a strange experiment. Fay Wray of ""King Kong"" fame plays the good doctor's daughter, Joan Xavier.

""The Return of Dr. X"" (1939): New York newspaper reporter Walter Barnett (Wayne Morris) finds himself out of a job after he claims to have found actress Angela Merrova (Lya Lys) dead in her apartment - only the next day she showed up alive and threatened to sue the paper. Determined to investigate he discovers her involvement with a strange doctor (Humphrey Bogart) who is an expert on human blood. Barnett then finds a connection to a series of gruesome murders where the victims were all found drained of blood.

""Mark of the Vampire"" (1935): Sir Karell Borotyn (Holmes Herbert) appears to have been killed by Count Mora Bela Lugosi), a vampire believed to haunt the local village. Now his daughter Irena (Elizabeth Allan) is the Count's next target. Enter Professor Zelen (Lionel Barrymore), an expert on vampires who is sent to prevent her death. At the same time, secrets are revealed surrounding the circumstances of Sir Karell's death.

""Mad Love"" (1935): In Paris, the great surgeon Dr. Gogol (Peter Lorre) falls madly in love with stage actress Yvonne Orlac (Frances Drake), and his ardor disturbs her quite a bit when he discovers to his horror that she is married to concert pianist Stephen Orlac (Colin Clive). Shortly thereafter, Stephen's hands are badly crushed in a train accident- beyond the power of standard medicine. Knowing that his hands are his life, Yvonne overcomes her fear and goes to Dr. Gogol, to beg him to help. Gogol decides to surgically graft the hands of executed murderer Rollo onto Stephen Orlac, the surgery is successful but has terrible side-effects...

""The Mask of Fu Manchu"" (1932): Englishmen race to find the tomb of Ghengis Khan. They have to get there fast, as the evil genius Dr. Fu Manchu (Boris Karloff) is also searching, and if he gets the mysteriously powerful relics, he and his diabolical daughter, Fah Lo See (Myrna Loy)will enslave the world!

Also of interest is Universal Studios September 19, 2006 release of ""The Boris Karloff Collection,"" featuring 5 Karloff classics, ""Night Key,"" ""The Black Castle"" ""The Climax,"" ""The Strange Door,"" and ""Tower of London.""  With Warner Bros and Universal Studios releasing these classic collections, the production values should be very high and the dvd transfers should be at their best!  These films could never hold up against today's CGI and computer generated fair for ""special effects.""  However, the acting talent and the incredible ""atmosphere"" of these films, as well as those released in the wonderful ""Val Lewton Horror Collection,"" and the Universal Studios' ""Legendary Monster"" collections are far superior to today's artificial talents.

Many of these ""boxed sets"" contain films that have been long overdue for a dvd release.  It's nice to see them finally making it to dvd!  Now if only we could have the 1960 b&w jungle voodoo classic ""The Leech Woman,""(1960) and a ""Hammer Horror Collection Volume 2"" featuring more great Hammer Studio classics, including the ultra-creepy ""The Gorgon,"" my expectations in classic horror will be somewhat met.",1153699200,44,4225,5.069164265129683

All the the movies in this set are surprisingly good.  Video quality is better than one has any right to expect for moving pictures of this vintage.  I won't go into detail about each movie because; I think other reviewers have covered that aspect of this Hollywood's Legends of Horror Collection far better than I ever could.  I'll stick with what I know.  The sound quality while not the best I've ever heard is not bad at all.  The video quality is in the good to superior range.  There is no real projector noise or artifacts on the film with exception of the reel change flashes which just add to the charm and character of old movies.

All of the movies deliver a good creep out factor and are well acted.  The black and white is rich in shading so one can appreciate the time taken to light everything just so. In black and white movies the greatest care was taken to light sets to perfection because; lighting was a vital part of telling the story.  Lighting set moods, lighting revealed faces and hid dangers just barely visible.  Lighting in old horror movies like these was often especially good because shadows of commonplace objects and things take on a gruesome appearance when properly lit.  Today all the blood and gore are shown in detail with little if anything left to the imagination.  In the Hollywood's Legends of Horror Collection light or its absence, sound or its lack thereof helped set the mood and tell the story.  Black & White horror movies challenge the imagination because; the people making films in this Hollywood's Legends of Horror Collection know the most horrible things that haunt our souls live within our imaginations.  I always say Black & White horror movies teach the audiences to scare themselves using their own inner demons and psychotic thoughts.

The Hollywood's Legends of Horror Collection is a great series of awesome vintage horror you just need to supply an active imagination and your full attention. It will be worth the tiny price paid for this Hollywood's Legends of Horror Collection because; a good bone bracing fright is priceless for its like is experienced too rare in these times.  This Hollywood's Legends of Horror Collection earned my five star rating.",1406246400,,2344,4.7481481481481485
2616989,4,B000GRUQJW,"Hollywood's Legends Of Horror is worth your purchase if you enjoy '30s horror. There's a couple that are just OK but it's still worth your while. Part of the reason I enjoy it is for the actors; being a fan of Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray, Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre and Lionel Barrymore. The Devil Doll is easily the weakest of the bunch but it's an alright Lionel Barrymore film and an alright sci-fi/horror movie. Mask Of Fu Manchu wasn't a favorite of mine but it's still an entertaining one and Karloff plays a good villain. Mark Of The Vampire is an interesting one with Barrymore along with Atwill in the supporting cast, the one thing that I found interesting is how the film ended. Return Of Doctor X is actually quite good considering, Humphrey Bogart plays the villain who comes back to life after dying in the first film. Mad Love is one of my favorites with Peter Lorre as a mad scientist, this was actually his first American film as well. Doctor X and Mad Love are a toss-up but Doctor X would have to be the stand-out film for it's cast and interesting plot, not to mention it was shot in color back in 1932. Lionel Atwill plays a scientist and Fay Wray plays his daughter. The plot is about a killer who is strangling victims and cannibalizing them, it was during the pre-code era and it has more questionable elements than anything that came from the mid '30s and even up to the early '60s. Another film I'd recommend which is related and one of my favorite horror movies is ""Mystery Of The Wax Museum"" (remade in '53 as House Of Wax) which is the follow-up to Doctor X, stars both Atwill and Wray, directed by Michael Curtiz and shot in 2-strip Technicolor as well.",1405728000,,1679,4.454545454545454

2617005,4,B000GRUQJW,"It's difficult to look at these 6 films without automatically thinking about Universal Studios Horror Films from the 1930s.  No question about it. MGM, Warner Bros and several other studios wanted to grab the attention (and pocket money) of moviegoers who wanted MORE!  So they gathered the recognizable stars (Karloff, Lugosi, Lorre, and Lionel Atwill), sprinkled some gothic ambiance and created Program Pictures running between 60 and 87 minutes. Surprisingly, a few of them breathed while the others got 'buried!' .

MAD LOVE is an interesting film.  Directed by Karl Freund (who provided atmospheric chills in ""The Mummy""), Peter Lorre portrays Dr. Gogol.  Gogol is a famous surgeon who can do the impossible when it comes to reconstructing body tissue.  An emergency occurs when a  concert pianist, played by Colin Clive, has his hands crushed in an unfortunate accident. It looks like Clive will never play again.  Enter Francis Drake who plays Clive's actress-wife. I forgot to tell you that Gogol is obsessed with her to the point of purchasing a wax figure of her image.  She appreciates his attention, but is devoted to her husband. When a convicted murderer is sent to the electric chair...Dr. Gogol attempts to 'score' with the lady by grafting the convict's hands on to the wrists of Clive. Most pianists can't perform and strangle at the same time! I won't spoil the ending, but the conclusion is satisfactory.  To take full advantage of this film, watch the trailer FIRST!  Lorre is flirting on the phone with an admiring caller.

THE RETURN OF DR. X was the sequel to the original DOCTOR X.  This was clearly a case where the sequel surpassed the original!  Humphrey Bogart was still a Warner Bros contract player when the film was released in 1939.  Chalk white and ghoulish. Bogart's Dr. James Xavier is a true villain. I loved the music, the mystery and the fact that the running time was 62 minutes.  The only drawback was that some of the authority figures were portrayed as morons. Under Director Vincent Sherman...Wayne Morris, Rosemary Lane & Dennis Morgan managed to keep a straight face while keeping this film together.

DOCTOR X (1932) really looks dated.  Maybe (Director) Michael Curtiz was just getting started or was told to make this?  But despite an excellent cast including Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray, and Preston Foster...I kept waiting for something to happen. The acting was mostly wooden. Lee Tracy's aggressive reporter was pathetic. The idiots in the police department who overreacted to everything---also pathetic. An armchair detective could easily spot the murderer 30 minutes into the movie.

MASK OF FU MANCHU was one of the reasons I bought this set.  I'd never seen this Boris Karloff film and liked it. Fu Manchu (Karloff) is on a quest for the mask and sword of Genghis Kahn. WHY? Because both contain magical powers that will assure him of world domination.  So whatever it takes...including a death ray borrowed by Universal's wizard of life-restoring machine specialist, Kenneth Strickfaden...Manchu is going to get what he wants.  Of course, there's a group of archeologists who also want the sword and mask too.  MGM Contract Players Lewis Stone & Jean Hersholt are part of the group, but the casting of Myrna Loy as Manchu's kinky daughter is fascinating.  Even though she's evil and deceitful like her old man, Loy wasn't born a boy!  The film looks good and there's a commentary by Greg Mank included.

MARK OF THE VAMPIRE was clearly a case of the trailer being better than the movie itself.  Bela Lugosi does the set-up and audiences expect the same chills he gave us in Universal's ""Dracula!""  Unfortunately, Tod Browning's direction can't save this overcooked turkey!  Just about everything is clearly staged in spite of the 'old dark house' atmosphere and the presence of actors Lionel Barrymore, Lionel Atwill, Jean Hersholt and Bela.  We're set up for surprise, but we get a bunch of explanations along with a cop-out ending!  Why Metro felt that they had to lighten up most of their horror films with stupid humor still puzzles me?

THE DEVIL DOLL puts Tod Browning's directorial efforts to better use.  Ditto Lionel Barrymore who plays a falsely accused man who was imprisoned for crimes he didn't commit.  He escapes from prison with his cellmate whose wife has been working on a formula to shrink live people to the size of dolls. These are the 'tools' for Barrymore to get revenge on the 3 men who sent him to prison.  Disguised as a doll shop madam, Barrymore is excellent.  Unfortunately, he has a daughter (Maureen O'Sullivan) who feels her Father abandoned her (and her Mom).  It's a touching horror film and much to my surprise, I enjoyed it!

2617008,5,B000GRUQJW,"Universal was famous for horror movies during the 1930s, but they didn't have a lock on the genre: almost every studio took a crack at it, including glossy MGM and gritty Warner Bro.s. HOLLYWOOD'S LEGENDS OF HORROR consists of three DVDs and six movies, four from MGM and two from Warner.

Very loosely based on a mildly popular New York play, the 1932 DOCTOR X finds reporter Lee Taylor (Lee Tracy) on the track of a serial killer who cannibalizes his victims. The killer is tracked to a medical center headed by Dr. Xavier (Lionel Atwill), who sets out to unmask the killer via a bizarre experiment that forces the suspects to watch recreations of the crimes. At the time, audiences hadn't been subjected to a glut of cinematic serial killers, much less cannibals. Such ideas were gruesome beyond imagination--and they were backed by beating hearts, blood spattered lab coats, strange experimental devices, potential rape, burning bodies, synthetic flesh, and a particularly grotesque bit of make-up. What's more, it was all in early Technicolor. Although it may not be as famous as some, DOCTOR X is indeed a pre-code landmark, and any fan of 1930s horror should seek it out. The film has a nice audio commentary by historian Tom Weaver.

And then there is THE RETURN OF DOCTOR X, which has absolutely nothing to do with DOCTOR X. The story concerns a reporter (Wayne Morris) and doctor (Dennis Morgan) who team up to uncover a killer known for draining the blood of his victims. The role of the killer was originally written with Boris Karloff in mind, but when that didn't pan out Warner Bro.s crammed an extremely unwilling Humphrey Bogart into the zombie-like role. Bogart despised the film and didn't mind saying to anyone who would listen, and indeed it is a very silly movie and Bogart is very silly in it. THE RETURN OF DOCTOR X is watchable, and even amusing at times, but ultimately this is the sort of thing you watch in order to say you've seen it, nothing more. The film's audio commentary comes from historian Steve Haberman, who is very scripted, and the film's director, Vincent Sherman, who was ninety-nine at the time and understandably a little repetitive.

MGM's offerings include MAD LOVE, THE DEVIL DOLL, THE MARK OF THE VAMPIRE, and THE MASK OF FU MANCHU. The studio was best known for family fare, glossy dramas, and intelligent musicals--so it is a bit of a shock to find that it could generate truly perverse fare, with 1935's MAD LOVE a case in point. The film, which introduced Peter Lorre to American audiences, was more or less based on Maurice Renard's ""The Hands of Orlac."" In this version, Stephen Orlac (Colin Clive) is a noted pianist, his wife Yvonne (Frances Drake) is a noted actress, and Gogol (Peter Lorre) is the brilliant surgeon Yvonne calls in when her husband's hands are destroyed in a train wreck. Gogol performs a hand transplant, using the hands of a knife killer ((Edward Brophy.) Gogol is also psychotically obsessed with Yvonne, and when she rejects him, he sets out to frame Stephen for murder in a way that implies the transplanted hands have a life of their own. The movie has a shocking streak of sexual sadism that can still provoke winces seventy years later, and it comes with a commentary by Steve Haberman, which would be quite good except for the fact that he persistently imitates Lorre's speech.

The 1936 THE DEVIL DOLL is on the same disk. Seventeen years ago Paul Lavond (Lionel Barrymore) was falsely accused and conviced of robbery and murder; now he has escaped and returned to Paris, determined to take his revenge on the three business partners who conspired to frame him. He teams with mad scientist Malita (the memorable Rafaela Ottiano), who is working on a means to reduce the human race to one sixth its size, and he uses Malita's minature beings to attack and kill his false accusors. Along the way he also intervenes in daughter Lorriane's (Maureen O'Sullivan) romance, which has taken an unfortunate turn. It is perhaps significant that this is the only film in the set that does not have an audio commentary; THE DEVIL is, quite frankly, a well-made bore, and even if you are a hardcore 1930s horror fan, you can skip this one and miss nothing.

The third and final disk includes what may be, aside from the notorious FREAKS, the single most infamous horror film of the 1930s: 1932's THE MASK OF FU MANCHU. Based on characters created by novelist Sax Rohmer, Dr. Fu Manchu (Boris Karloff) and his daughter Fah Lo See (Myrna Loy) seek to gain power by obtaining the mask and sword of Gengis Kahn. When an English expedition actually obtains the mask and sword, Fu Manchu and his daughter resort to torture to obtain the items--and the tortures are memorable indeed, ranging from an endlessly tolling bell to a crocodile pit to moving walls of silver knives. Perhaps the single most disturbing torture sequences involve the handsome young expedition member Terry (Charles Starrett.) He is first stripped half naked, hung by his hands from the ceiling, and viciously whipped while Fah Lo See screams ""Faster! Faster!"" Later he is reduced to a loin cloth, secured to a table by clamps, and wiggles in an effort to escape as he is pawed by Fu Manchu, who seems to like Terry as much as his own daughter does! ""Kill the white man and take his women!"" Fu Manchu shouts to his leering Mongol horde. The DVD has the bonus of a particularly interesting audio commentary by film historian Greg Mank, who notes that Karloff seemed to regard the film as a lark and Loy described the script as ""obscene.""

The last film in the collection is THE MARK OF THE VAMPIRE, a 1935 flick made when censorship was in full force. Based on the ""lost"" Lon Chaney film LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT, the story finds dangerous forces gathering about Irena (Elizabeth Allan), whose father may have been killed by a vampire several years earlier. Unfortunately, the script is ridiculously uneven, so much so that it is a little difficult to follow the plot. Even so, it further develops the ""Dracula"" imagery in a number of remarkable ways, particularly in the form of a deadly female vampire. But as Dorothy Parker so infamously said on a different occasion, ""There's less here than meets the eye,"" and the end result is singularly unspectacular. Fortunately, THE MARK OF THE VAMPIRE is at least entertaining in a visual sense, and it also has a memorable audio commentary by historians Kim Newman and Steve Jones.

Ultimately, HOLLYWOOD'S LEGENDS OF HORROR includes three films that are classics of the 1930s genre: DOCTOR X, MAD LOVE, and THE MASK OF FU MANCHU. THE RETURN OF DOCTOR X and THE MARK OF THE VAMPIRE are at least entertaining, and THE DEVIL DOLL is the only real clunker in the lot. Strongly recommended for some midnight fun.

2617010,5,B000GRUQJW,"Hollywood's Legends of Horror Collection is an affordable anthology of six surprisingly memorable horror films, each the recipient of high production values, top notch actors, directors, and/or cinematographers, and each delving into more dangerous/risque pre-code territory than their comparatively ""safe"" Universal Studios brethren.

If you're interested in this volume primarily because of Lugosi/Browning's Mark of the Vampire or Karloff's Mask of Fu Manchu (as I was), then you should probably hedge your expectations.  Truthfully, each of these films is flawed in some way, and most are more memorable for individual scenes and performances than for the film, as a whole.  Still, these ARE absolutely worth a viewing and offer a nice contrast to the better known horror films from this era, for better and for worse.

Doctor X is the true high point of this set for me.  Filmed in Technicolor Phase 2 in 1932 (who knew!) it is essentially a who dunnit in which all the suspects are quirky/eccentric mad scientists trapped in a castle together.  The tone is rich, the sets elaborate, the premise grisly (a serial cannibal/rapist who is drawn out by the full moon and looks like Emperor Palpatine from Star Wars), and the climax is downright shocking and full of eerie shots amidst steaming test tubes and bubbling chemical compounds.  Oddly enough, a good amount of humor is worked in for relief and rarely detracts from the tone of the film.  If it weren't for the non-sensical solution to the mystery at the end and some slightly awkward pacing throughout, Doctor X would have been an absolute Hollywood legend. Grade = A

The Return of Doctor X (not an actual sequel -- it's the ""return"" of an entirely different character named Doctor X) is a decent horror film with no real flaws and no real memorable qualities beyond a young Humphrey Bogart playing a surprisingly ghastly mad scientist.  The film is worth viewing for his performance alone, never mind the thrill of watching him play completely against type. Grade = B

Mad Love is a confused reinterpretation of the novel ""The Hands of Orlac"" (previously adapted to film only ten years earlier in Germany with Conrad Veidt in the lead) that is thoroughly rich in tone and dominated by Peter Lorre, disturbing the heck out of us as an obsessed lover/stalker, and ably supported by Collin Clive (Frankenstein) who is already showing signs of fading as an actor by this point, but still manages to make us pity and resent him as the tragic Orlac.  However, while the plot of the film is compelling at first, it quickly becomes highly confused in its focus, never sure whether to focus on Orlac and his murderous transplanted hands or on the obsessive Dr. Gogol and his pursuit of Orlac's wife.  It's essentially two badly juggled plots in one, and thus fails to resolve in a satisfying way.  Still, Lorre and the film's overall tone are unforgettable.  Incidentally, this is Karl Freund (the godfather of modern day cinematography)'s final film as a director.  Grade = B-

The Devil Doll is the low point of the volume.  With Tod Browning (Dracula) directing, and Lionel Barrymore in the leading role, you'd expect great things to happen, but the script, supporting cast, and special effects are so bad that the film just falls apart fast.  Unless the idea of Barrymore playing a murderous Mrs. Doubtfire is appealing to you, or unless you feel like fast forwarding all the way to the surprisingly (out-of-left-field) touching ending, this film has little to offer.  Grade = D+

Mark of the Vampire is a must see film if for no other reason than that it's the unofficial sequel to Dracula.  Filmed by the same director (Todd Browning) and starring the same lead (Bela Lugosi), this film has far more in common with Dracula than any of its official sequels (and, in fact, the idea of Dracula having a daughter, first introduced here, was stolen in the official Universal Studios sequel a year later).  Beyond that, this is a brilliantly shot film, with countless haunting shots, all adding an unforgettably ethereal tone to the film. So long as I live, I doubt I'll ever forget the shot where the vampire's daughter descends from air with beating wings to be at her father's side.  How Browning pulled this off in 1935 is beyond me.  This is also one of Lugosi's best performances of all time.  He's genuinely scary at times in this film, which is hard to imagine of the often parodied actor who spent much of his later career in B films.  Unfortunately, what tempers all of this praise is that the script for this film is ABSURDLY BAD.  I mean ""yell at the screen and proclaim 'WTF???!!!!!'"" bad.  Don't even try to watch this one for the story, and ignore the ending all together.  This is a truly terribly written film, wasting what could have been the pinnacle of both Browning and Lugosi's careers.  And, incidentally, the third and final semi-credible Lugosi vampire film is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Return-of-the-Vampire/dp/B0000694WM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Return of the Vampire</a>, a more boring but generally adequate film.  Grade = B-

The Mask of Fu Manchu is good for curiosity's sake, but little more.  It's fun to see Karloff in a totally different kind of role, but he doesn't do a great job with it.  Truly, none of the fun of the Fu Manchu franchise carries over into this thoroughly generic film.  Grade = C

All in all, you're getting one GREAT film in this set, three ""you've got to see this once!"" films, and two pretty forgettable films that might still be entertaining enough to suffice for a late night viewing.  But, more importantly, you're seeing the other side of 1930s horror films -- the higher production films, the stronger actor films, the more risque subject matter films.  No, nothing in this set is going to rival Frankenstein or Bride of Frankenstein, but I'd put Doctor X in my top five from this era, and most of the rest are still unforgettable, even while they are flawed.",1346112000,4,6036,4.9151873767258385

2617032,4,B000GRUQJW,"My primary intention was to review only MARK OF THE VAMPIRE. This collection seemed the most cost effective. I have seen the other films included & they're fine...with a particulat nod to THE DEVIL DOLL. Lionel Barrymore is a hoot as an old woman with a particularly interesting mode of revenge. Incidentally, actress who plays the maid in Dr. X is the same maid in MARK OF THE VAMPIRE.

MARK OF THE VAMPIRE was an attempt by MGM to capitalize on Universal's DRACULA. It's almost like a cut & paste job where whole scenes are lifted from the original, albeit with a larger budget. Bela Lugosi reprises the DRACULA role, this time as Count Mora. The funny thing is that Lugosi looks younger, more virile as if he had a good...blood transfution!

Many people have said that this film is even better than DRACULA. It certainly has all the atmosphere--and then some. The plot is ridiculous & completely implausible, but isn't that true of most horror films? You like it or you don't. I happen to like MARK OF THE VAMPIRE, even knowing the ""surprise ending.""

If you're a new collector, this set is worth the $$$. It would be a good PG rated collection for kids at Samhain..I mean, Halloween.

Oh, yes...Luna, The Bat Girl steals the show.

PS: MAD LOVE is a bizarre little story focusing on amputation & very obsessive desire. The supporting actors are very good, but Peter Lorre really standouts as the brilliant & frustrated surgeon.",1322265600,6,1431,4.685258964143427
2617033,5,B000GRUQJW,"From the studios that weren't particularly known for horror movies ----Warner Bros. and MGM---- comes this well chosen collection that despite their limited entry in the genre proves they could compete with the behemoth Universal when it came to doing quality horror flicks.
I bought this set because it contained Devil Doll, one of my favorite horror movies. Starring Lionel Barrymore as a disgraced banker who did a long stretch in jail because he was framed, it is the story of turnaround as he gets back at the real crooks who let him hang out and dry. Through some diabolical process he miniaturizes people to a size that is smaller than a Barbie doll and mentally controls them to carry out his dastardly plan to extract pain and suffering ----- and even death against his enemies. This movie is great. He plays a lot of it in drag as he assumes the identity of a female toy shop owner who looks like a sweet and doting grandmother. Barrymore's performance as the old lady is every bit  as slick as Lon Chaney's drag granny in The Unholy Three. The grandmotherly alter ego serves Barrymore in good stead; after all he needs to maintain a low profile after he escapes prison in a tropical hell hole replete with swamps and what better way to distribute those cute little devil dolls. All horror leads need a requisite crippled side kick and Barrymore's is Rafaella Octaviano who is a female cross between a mad scientist and Igor. This woman deserves the Dwight Frye Award for creepiness.
Another movie in the set is Mad Love. Peter Lorre pulls off his role as the obsessed madman(and an intensely creepy nut case at that) who is enamored with virtuous Frances Drake and unable to take no for an answer. Drake's husband is played by Colin Clive, known to '30's cinema viewers primarily as Universal's Dr. Victor Frankenstein who unleashed the monster. In this go around he's a pianist whose hands were crushedand was the recipient of the first movie double hand transplant.
The rest of the roundup includes Dr. X which features horror favorite Lionel Atwill as a nefarious doctor who is definitely antisocial and gets off on creepy  activities that don't seem to be for the betterment of society. The Return of Dr. X  gives Humphrey Bogart a chance to play a grayish/white character in serious need of a full blood transfusion. Mark of the Vampire plays on the blood sucking phenomena that started with horror biggies Nosferatu and Dracula, and The Mask of Fu Manchu features Boris Karloff as the Asian master of horror with poor Myrna Loy as his daughter in what was surely one of her last Asian roles.
With no clunkers in this set, I am going to have a fun movie night on Halloween. This collection complements the Universal horror classics that most of us love and provides more great entertainment for horror fans young and old alike.",1318550400,2,2843,4.716297786720322
2617034,5,B000GRUQJW,"This is an excellent set of horror films. If you have started collecting classic old films definitely add this to your collection. It has  great actors Karloff, Lugosi and a slew of others.
Start with Mask of Fu Manchu. Karloff as the demented perverse villan is at his peak. Myrna Loy is so beautiful and sexy. Remember this is pre hollywood code so sex and torture were in. Great film with a fun commentary to boot!
Next go to Mad Love with Peter Lorre and Francis Drake. Again pre code and very disturbing. But what a great film.
Humphrey Bogart in his only horror role is in here also. Return of Doctor X is the movie not the best of the bunch but immensely fun and great to watch.

2617035,4,B000GRUQJW,"In 1935, Browning requested to remake London After Midnight as Mark of the Vampire, starring Lionel Barrymore, Bela Lugosi, Lionel Atwill and Carol Borland.  Browning's  status at MGM was sensitive at best, even though he was still under Thalberg's protection.  Neither Mayer nor the studio had forgiven Browning for Freaks (1932) and his salary for Mark was cut to half of its former amount, which he humbly accepted.  Thalberg's protective umbrella vanished when the producer died prematurely, shortly after the release of Browning's The Devil Doll (1936).

After that film, Browning sat dormant for two years until he was able to direct Miracles for Sale (1939), an uneven film that featured yet another Browning depiction of below-the-waist mutilation.  It was to be his last.  He was unceremoniously fired by MGM producer Carey Wilson, whose early career Browning had greatly assisted.  So much for loyalty.

For Mark of the Vampire, Browning worked with cinematographer James Wong Howe (who later photographed Citizen Kane-1941). Howe's work in the film was praised, but Howe did not care for working with Browning, who he said ""did not know one end of the camera from the other"" (but, then, neither did Luis Bunuel). Browning, however, was a hard-driving perfectionist and took great care in the craft and design of the film; the expressionistic, winged descent of Borland is strikingly impressive.

Browning always grumbled about the finished state of his Dracula (1931). In his original edit, Dracula was ten minutes longer and was even more deliberately paced, with Lugosi's count almost entirely invisible during the second half, which, according to Browning's sensibilities, made perfect sense.  The Count, as Browning's ""Living, Hypnotic Corpse"" (an act the director played in his carnival circuit days ) pulls a disappearing act. But, Universal spoiled that by cutting  several scenes and adding close-up shots of the vampire grimacing, much to Browning's permanent dismay (he refused to ever watch the film again).

Browning got his way regarding the presence of the Count in Vampire.  As in  Terence Fisher's Dracula, Prince of Darkness (1966) the vampire is mute and predominantly an unseen spirit.  Lugosi is even more effective here with his reduced, minimal presence.  He is made up to look like Dracula, but projects increased savagery in his silence, making for a highly effective, grinning demon that differs from Chaney's look but emulates the former's pantomime. Lugosi's Count Mora also sports an unexplained bullet wound to the temple.

Unfortunately, Browning once again fell prey to unimaginative producers, who butchered Vampire by excising some twenty minutes, which is evident throughout this highly incoherent film.  The result is something akin to a fascinatingly flawed, unintentional surrealist egg.  In the original script, the Count and his daughter were  incestuous lovers who committed suicide with bullets to the head, thereby incurring the curse of the vampire.  Not surprisingly, that part of the story was  cut, but Lugosi's bleeding temple remained untouched, sans explanation.  Borland is equally impressive.  Her Luna tops the look of Tichenor's, and her portrayal inspired Charles Addams' Morticia.

Guy Endore (Werewolf of Paris) wrote the script from Browning's story.  Mark of the Vampire is saturated with sensational Gothic texture (which includes possums inhabiting the castle).  The visceral editing somehow add to the film's appeal, even if it is a bit too talkative, bogged down with moments of forced comedy relief and Lionel Barrymore's on-the-sleeve acting (although sometimes he seems more villainous than the vampires, which is beneficial to the overall milieu).  Vampire adds up to an outrageous, hallucinatory film with genuinely perverse personality and a surreal, ominous style, far more so than the average Universal genre potboilers.

When released, critics generally praised the film, but many complained about the  ""trick"" ending, which is stupefying since it is hinted at fairly early on.  Plus, it has the same ending and story as Midnight, which was a  huge box office hit only eight years before.  Perhaps critics from the period all suffered from long term memory loss.  The ending actually makes the film, giving a facetious, Addams family-like sheen to the proceeding austerity.

Browning ended his collaboration with Lugosi with this film. Their work together started with The Thirteenth Chair (1929) when the director was scouting around for Dracula (despite rumors, Chaney was not set to be cast as the Count and there is no evidence that he would have been, even if he had lived, although Chaney would have been an obvious choice to consider).

Browning's long term association with Barrymore would come to an end in the following  year's The Devil Doll. It was also the beginning of the end for Browning's unparalleled brand of artistry.

In his next to last film, Tod Browning revisits the same territory as The Unholy Three (1925) with a surreal twist.  The Devil Doll (1936) is based on Abraham Merritt's  novel ""Burn, Witch, Burn,"" with a screenplay by  Guy Endore, Erich von Stroheim, and Browning.  Lionel Barrymore, who had a long collaborative history with Browning, stars as escaped convict Paul Lavond.

17 years earlier, Lavond had been sent to prison after being framed by three banking partners.  Lavond has escaped with a fellow convict, Marcel (Henry Walthall, another Browning regular) who just happens to be a mad scientist.  Together, they make it to Marcel's home and wife, Malita (the hammy Rafaela Ottiano),who also is, conveniently, a mad scientist. Marcel dies, but not before showing Lavond the scientific discovery that he and Malita have been working on for years. They are able to shrink animals and people to a sixth of their normal size.  Considering all the problems with world food shortage, anyone could see the value of this discovery (!). Anyone except Lavond, that is, who is a bit leery when he finds out the shrinking process wipes out memory cells and the subject's willpower.

The three bankers who betrayed him are a new Unholy Three, a reprehensible trinity driven by love of money.  Lavond, Malita and Marcel are three societal outcasts who are despised and rejected.  Browning is committed to making sure we root for the underdog; quite the reversal of contemporary, evolved reality shows that deify the affluent top dogs.
Seeing a new potential vehicle for his revenge, Lavond is accompanied by Malita with a case full of shrunken critters in hand.  Lavond sets out on a Count of Monte Cristo mission, but considering this is a Tod Browning production, Lavond hardly dons a chivalrous persona like Robert Donat in the 1934 film.  Rather, he gets in old lady drag (a la Lon Chaney in The Unholy Three) and takes on the identity of Madame Mandilip, proprietress.

With a couple of six inch Tweedledees, Lavond, in his best Sweeney Todd fashion, opens up a doll shop (rather than a parrot shop or pie shop), exacts revenge, steals jewelery (which he hides in a toy, just like in Unholy Three) and sets out to find the holy child: his  long lost daughter, Lorraine ( Maureen O' Sullivan, aka Tarzan's Jane). This is yet another frequently used Browning subplot of a severed father/daughter relationship.
What makes The Devil Doll unique is the science fiction angle and a female mad scientist in Ottiano (who has an Elsa Lanchester like streak in her hair).  By the time of The Devil Doll, Browning was comfortable with the sound medium and the film benefits from this newfound familiarity, fluid camera work, and the charmingly rudimentary FX for the incredible shrunken people.

As Lavond, Barrymore delivers a subdued, controlled performance.  In drag, Barrymore raises the ham meter considerably.  Although a sympathetic character, Barrymore conveys genuine creepiness in the revenge scenes as he enforces his will through the dolls by intense concentration.

Ironically, to proves his innocence, Lavond must again go into exile at the film's end and must forever forsake his daughter.  The Devil Doll is a surrealist delight in its sheer lunacy.

2617036,5,B000GRUQJW,"I won't belabour the point but, as other have pointed out, this is a fine collection and in excellent presentation. What one or two people hail to understand about ""Wax Museum"" is that, until a few years ago, it was a lost film. The only known copy was found in Jack Warner's personal collection. Hence the scratches. I can live with the scrathes to have this superb film available. As to ""Return of Dr X"", ok, it's not a masterpiece and, yes, ""Island of Lost Souls"" would've been a far better choice (and needs to be on DVD), but it IS marked as a sequel to Dr X and is worth watching because of Bogart. It's also a fun movie because of Bogart and the camerawork of what was probably considered too bad of a script to be filmed but had to be because of the studio assembly line of the day. Hey, look, there have been far worse films (like almost anything at the cinema today).",1288310400,3,877,4.25748502994012

I completely forgot about the unusual ending in ""Mark of the Vampire"" since I last saw it in the early 60s on TV.  That was worth the price alone.  ""The Devil Doll"" plot was quite good for the 30s...only to be somewhat reprised in the 50s with ""Attack of the Puppet People"".  I like the eerie-ness of ""Mad Love"" with its focus on Peter Lorre's role rather than on Colin Clive's.  (I was surprised to find out that it didn't make it at the box office when it first came out.)  Just a GREAT COLLECTION all around!!!",1278201600,2,627,4.316239316239316

2617040,5,B000GRUQJW,"The Hollywood Legends of Horror Collection is worth every one of the twenty seven hundred pennies that go into its purchase. For true fans of vintage horror or those looking for a perspective on it, you cannot ask for a better sampling. Usually in boxes of three or more films, you encounter some chaff, but in this case, all of these movies are worth watching, all of them an insight into a different time or career. The beautifully tinted Doctor X is at once simple and convoluted, deviant and innocent, the story of a neurologist under police investigation who gathers his colleagues to figure out which of them is a cannibal killer. This is livened up by an unnecessary reporter character and the divinely gorgeous Fay Wray. Ghastly subject matter combined with Monogram style tea parlor intrigue makes for a winner. On the same disc is Return of Doctor X, which has nothing to do with the first film, but showcases a phenomenally creepy undead Bogart. Undead Bogart. Are you buying this yet?
  Also included is the nigh peerless Mad Love. Colin Clive, famous for his (mediocre) portrayal of Doctor Frankenstein plays a pianist who loses his hands. Peter Lorre plays the schizoid surgeon who replaces Clive's hands with a criminal's and comes up with a plan to win over the man's beautiful actress wife, with whom he is in love and sexually obsessed. Under the watchful eyes of Karl Freund and Greg Toland, this is stunning to look at and becomes a fantastic meditation on art, love and madness. Criterion stuff. On the same disc is The Devil Doll in which Lionel Barrymore in sinister old lady drag tries to save his reputation by having the men who sent him up the river killed by tiny homonculi. Are you buying this yet?
  The final disc might be the least of the set, but it is still relevant and cool. Mark of the Vampire is a hackneyed retelling of London After Midnight and a masterclass in illogic. But Bela Lugosi's silent vampire and Carroll Borland's vampiress are images that will remain with you forever as symbols of the power of early horror. Also on this disc is yellow-peril pulp actioner The Mask of Fu Manchu. It might be politically incorrect, but I like it when Boris Karloff is Chinese. If somebody sold a ""Boris Karloff is Chinese box set"", I would buy it as soon as gaps appeared in the oubliette of poverty in which I live. Boris Karloff is Chinese, Peter Lorre is insane, Humphrey Bogart is undead. Halloween is coming. You need this.",1252972800,,2464,4.657471264367816
2617061,5,B000GRUQJW,"The only film in this set whichI have not yet seen is Karloff's ""The Mask of Fu Manchu,"" so I shall not comment on it as yet. The other films are at least enjoyable, some great, but my main interest in purchasing this set was Bogart's ""The Return of Dr. X."" Legend has it that this was Jack Warner's punishment for Bogie's protests against being typecast by the studio. I remember seeing it on TV, on a program called ""Chiller Theater,"" and it impressed me from the very start, not merely because of Bogie's offbeat role as the murderous-medico-brought-back-to-life. It is in fact a taut, fast-moving and chilling tale, for the most part very well acted (superbly by John Litel as the well-meaning if obsessed hematologist who revives Dr. Xavier (Bogart), and stupendously by Bogart as the cruel, chilling child killer physician who ruthlessly murders people for his continued existence through blood transfusions). The only weakness is Wayne Morris' endlessly bumbling and wisecracking reporter, a concept that by 1939 has been done to death as an obnoxious stereotype. The musical score is outstanding, tense and atmospheric; I wish that the composer had been mentioned in the film credits. Anyway, this ia a film that has been neglected and underrated far too long; I am glad it is avaliable so that viewers can make their own judgments about its merit.",1221868800,,1356,4.925764192139738
2617062,5,B000GRUQJW,"In the early 30's, Universal was the leading exponent of the horror genre on film with such classics as ""Dracula"", ""Frankenstein"" and ""The Mummy"". MGM and Warner Brothers also cashed in on the craze and the results are really good. Utilizing such iconic stars as Lionel Barrymore, Peter Lorre (in his first US film) and even Universal legends Karloff and Lugosi the companies made some fine entries into the genre. The weakest is DR. X. Using a gimmicky 2 strip color format, the print transfer is the worst of all the 6 films. The movie itself is dull and stagy despite the efforts of ""scream queen"" Fay Wray and Lionel Atwill. WB fared much better later with a follow up THE RETURN OF DR. X using a relatively unknown Humphrey Bogart in white face and skunk streaked hair.

Lugosi and Barrymore turn up in a clever MGM Vampire tale with a twist THE MARK OF THE VAMPIRE. Lugosi of course plays the vampire but the movie sports one of the greatest warped endings in movies.

Karloff is always great and breathes life into ""FU MANCHU"". I believe this was the first film incarnation and if not, it is certainly the best. All the predecessors pale under Karloff's brilliant understated performance. Watch for a young Myrna Loy as Fu Manchu's equally villianous daughter.

The best movie of the lot and the worst titled DEVIL DOLL, stars again, the great Lionel Barrymore in drag no less as a Devil's Island escapee who disguises himself to exact vengence on those who sent him up the river. This is one of his finest performances in a career built on great acting. A young Maureen O'Sullivan of TARZAN fame appears as he bitter daughter.

All the movies are two on one disc (3 total) and housed in a box. They are not dual layered, both movies play on the same side as none of them are much longer than an hour. The transers considering the age (with the exception of Dr. X) are great as is the sound quality. There is however little to no bonus material (some theahtrical trailers).

The movies were directed by several horror greats, Tod Browning, Karl Freund, et. al and  for a nice price you have so many Hollywood legends in one package (Karloff, Lugosi, Barrymore, Atwill, Jean Hersholt, Myrna Loy, Maureen O'Sullivan, Humphrey Bogart--well, you can't ask for more than that now can you!",1194825600,2,2290,4.6419753086419755
2617063,4,B000GRUQJW,"This collection from the vaults of Warner Brothers and MGM, studios more famous for other film genres, contains some great stuff but it could have been better with a few changes.

First, the good - the prints are generally excellent, the theatrical trailers are included and the commentary for ""Fu Manchu"" is outstanding, with ""Mad Love"" and ""Doctor X"" close behind.  ""Mad Love"" benefits from stunning camera work, not surprising when the director is the famous cameraman Karl Freund.

Second, the mediocre - the print of ""Doctor X"", an early example of 2 strip technicolour, is probably as good as it gets but that still does not make it clearly visible. ""The Return of Doctor X"" is a B film and the plot is dumb in a typical B way. It does not really justify a commentary except that the director was still alive so we get a few first hand comments from the geriatric Vincent Sherman.

Third, the bad - ""The Mark of the Vampire"" was butchered before release and the film is arrant nonsense, a remake of a lost Lon Chaney film.  The theatrical trailer promises much more than the film delivers. The commentary attached to the film is appalling so at least the commentators have matched the film.

As for the films themselves, ""Mad Love"", ""Devil Dolls"" and ""Doctor X"" are ripping yarns with excellent casts and good scripts. ""Fu Manchu"" is an outrageous pre-code gem and best, of all, the DVD has been cut from the original print with all the censored bits restored.

The Set is good value but I would have flicked ""Mark of the Vampire"" and included Michael Curtiz's ""The Walking Dead"", a far superior film.  Also, a good commentary about ""Devil Dolls"" would have rounded out the set nicely.",1187654400,6,1691,4.67003367003367
2617064,5,B000GRUQJW,"These films are such gems, each of them, and the restored prints are so beautiful, that this collection should not be missed whether you are a seasoned archivist or just discovering the Universal Horror Canon.  The bonus features are sparse, comprising mostly commentary tracks from film historians and critics (although one,The Return of Dr. X, which stars a very creepy Humphrey Bogart, has commentary that includes the 100-year-old director!) and sometimes the theatrical trailer. But The Mask of Fu Manchu alone is worth thet price of the set for the chance to see, uncut, its pre-code craziness, high camp and very overt erotic and sadomasochistic overtones!
Barrymore, Atwill, Karloff, Lugosi, Lorre, Myrna Loy, Fay Wray... the list goes on. Whatever they're asking for this delightful box set, it's a pittance.

2617065,5,B000GRUQJW,"Rather than just focusing on a few horror franchises and milking them for all they were worth with five or six B quality sequels apiece as Universal did with Frankenstein, Dracula, the Mummy, and the Invisible Man, in the 30's and 40's Warner and MGM would usually take just one good idea and make just one good horror movie. This is a collection of six of Warner and MGM's better excursions into the horror genre during that era.

Everyone else has gone into the plots of these movies in detail, so I will not do the same. Let me point out, though, that ""Return of Doctor X"" is not really a sequel to ""Doctor X"" at all. The two stand alone. The only thing they have in common is the theme of a wise-cracking reporter on the trail of what turns out to be a mad doctor. As far as transfer quality, ""Mad Love"" has noticeable artifacts in the video, at least through the first half of the movie. It's nothing too distracting, though. With ""Doctor X"" you have to get used to the peculiarities of two-strip technicolor which includes occasional green skies and also green skin tones when people are shown in the dark. The rest of the films look quite good, and the audio quality is very good on all of the films. The extras that come with the films are as follows:

Although not really a complaint, the packaging of this set somewhat surprised me. In particular, each DVD comes in a slim case rather than the thicker and sturdier keep case in which most of the DVDs in Warner DVD sets are packaged. At any rate, the set is a great deal for the money and I highly recommend it.",1181606400,5,2238,4.66243654822335
2617066,5,B000GRUQJW,"I won't go into the plots of all of these fine films, but will say that I bought it because of ""Devil Doll"". Those special effects are amazing. None of the films could be considered ""Horror"", though they all involve some terrific mystery plots. I was especially impressed with ""Mad Love"", and Peter Lorre was a very underrated actor. (See ""The Beast with 5 Fingers"" to verify this.) Early experiments with color also enhanced ""Doctor X"". This is, indeed, an excellent mystery collection, and any aficianado of the genre should have this in their collection.",1170547200,4,557,4.873684210526315
2617067,4,B000GRUQJW,"This set has nice clean video, and of course you can't lose with the actors and titles. One of the most interesting to watch is MAD LOVE which was Peter Lorre's US film debut.  The devotee of the old Universal Horror movies will see certain scene similarities to The Phantom of the Opera, The Bride of Frankenstein, The Mummy, and Dracula in Mad Love, and the commentary track picks up on some (not all) of this. Interesting when you consider this is an MGM work. The only downside to this set, and it is a minor point, is the commentary track for Mark of the Vampire, where two obnoxious brits talk over each other saying little of worth. (I've noticed that on DVD commentary tracks when you put brits together, they continually talk over eachother, and it's hard to understand what they're saying. Perhaps that's why we won the Revolutionary War).

Anyway, if you love old horror movies, if you remember Famous Monsters of Filmland, if you want to see the US film debut of the man who said ""You deespize me Reek, don't you?"" in Casablanca--buy this set.",1165363200,8,1055,4.576719576719577
2617068,5,B000GRUQJW,"The cover art to Warners' Hollywood's Legends of Horror Collection features images of horror legends Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre and Humphrey Bogart. Humphrey Bogart ... what the heck? Yes, although Bogart was about as much a legend of horror as John Wayne was a musical comedy star, he did appear in one horror film (""The Return of Dr. X"") included in this collection. Maybe it is a little erroneous and misleading to describe Bogie as a legend of horror but thankfully Warners' has included his one and only rarely shown thriller. The other films included in this collection feature Hollywood's true horror legends in an array of interesting roles.

""The Mask of Fu Manchu"" (1932) may not be a real horror film but it does have the incomparable Boris Karloff in fine form as the demoniacal Fu Manchu. This engaging pre-code film features some delightfully racy scenes and insinuations. A young Myrna Loy as Fu Manchu's lascivious daughter is especially entertaining. Her very obvious goal of making the young male lead her own personal sex slave would surely have been censored from the script just a few years later.

MGM reunited Bela Lugosi and his ""Dracula"" director, Tod Browning, for 1935s ""The Mark of the Vampire."" This film was a remake of Browning's own silent classic ""London after Midnight"" which had starred Lon Chaney (and has been lost for 40 years). The image of the vampire had solidified in the public consciousness in the form of Lugosi's Dracula. MGM, obviously hoping to profit from the Dracula image, hired Lugosi to play the lead vampire character in a departure from the horrific and creepy, shark toothed vampire Chaney played in the original film. The final result is a well-mounted and moody horror offering with all the eerie trappings you'd expect from a 30s thriller including lots of fog, cobwebs, shadows and screams.

Maybe the best 30s horror flick included on this set is MGM's ""Mad Love"" from 1935. This film features a very young (and very creepy) Peter Lorre as a demented surgeon who torments a highly-strung concert pianist played by Colin Clive. Clive seems even more neurotic here than in his role as Henry Frankenstein in Universal's first two Frankenstein films. Lorre has been lusting after Colin's wife and uses a horrible accident as a means to destroy Clive's life and steal his bride. This is a first class horror film from MGM that rivals Universal's best horror classics.

The two Warner ""Doctor X"" films have no connection other than a similarity in title. The first film is a pretty slow-moving and dated 1932 thriller. ""Doctor X"" was filmed in an early two-strip Technicolor process, just like 1933's ""The Mystery of the Wax Museum,"" and is presented here in a restored color version. Even if it is a bit creaky, ""Doctor X"" is an interesting Hollywood artifact and worth at least one viewing. 1939's ""The Return of Doctor X"" is the one with Bogie. It's more of a B-movie but very fun to watch with Bogart as the villain of the title.

Rounding out this collection is Tod Browning's 1936 ""Devil Doll"" from MGM. This one features Lionel Barrymore as a vengeful soul who miniaturizes humans to do his bidding. It's an interesting addition to the set but by no means the primary reason to purchase the collection.

As you would expect from Warners' all the films are high quality transfers from the best available material. There are some trailers and film commentaries (not for all films though) including one with the late film director Vincent Sherman. Overall this set is highly recommended to fans who wish to add to their film libraries of horror films from Hollywood's golden age.

Side note: Some other reviewers have commented on the absence of the Warners' Karloff film ""The Walking Dead"" (1936). I too was mystified until I realized that this may have been done deliberately. Perhaps Warners has the future intention of offering their own collection of Karloff films. Since both Universal and Columbia released Karloff sets this fall I would guess Warners would have held back. If they choose to release their own set they would only need to take ""The Walking Dead"" and add ""West of Shanghai"" (Warners 1937), ""The Invisible Menace"" (Warners 1938), ""British Intelligence"" (Warners 1940), ""Devil's Island"" (Warners 1940), and maybe even ""You'll Find Out"" (RKO 1940). Let's hope Warners does put out a nice salute to Boris.",1164672000,13,4395,4.9071332436069985
2617069,4,B000GRUQJW,"The 1930s had its share of classic horror movies.  Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, The Invisible Man, The Mummy and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde may be tame by today's standards, but they are still good, eerie movies.  Beyond the classics were other movies that may not be quite as immortal but still have their good points.  Legend of Horror is a boxed set that contains six such movies.

Disc One has Mark of the Vampire and The Mask of Fu Manchu.  Mark of the Vampire reunites Bela Lugosi and director Tod Browning from Dracula.  Lugosi is the vampire who is apparently killing off local townspeople and Lionel Barrymore plays the Van Helsing-like role.  Unfortunately, while this movie has a nice eerie feel, the plot is hopelessly muddled, due especially to a plot twist that doesn't really work.  On the other hand, The Mask of Fu Manchu is a delight, with Boris Karloff playing the title villain with joyful glee and Myrna Loy as his daughter who gets aroused by torture.  Yes, there are a lot of racial stereotypes (as in the source books), but they are so over-the-top that they aren't quite as nasty as in other films of the era; in addition, despite the stereotyping, you somehow want to root for Fu Manchu and his daughter, who are much more interesting than the ""good"" guys.

Disc Two has Doctor X and The Return of Doctor X, two movies that have almost nothing to do with each other.  Doctor X (directed by Michael Curtiz) has its horror elements, but seems to be more of a mystery-comedy in the vein of The Cat and the Canary or The Old Dark House.  The ""science"" of the story is outlandish, but it does have its moments and it features a pre-King Kong Fay Wray (yes, she screams); it is also the only color movie in the set, albeit a rather washed-out looking two-strip Technicolor.  The Return of Doctor X is most notable for being Humphrey Bogart's one excursion into horror.  Bogie plays a killer brought back to life, but who now needs human blood to survive.

Disc Three as Mad Love, directed by The Mummy's Karl Freund, features Peter Lorre (in his first American role) and Colin Clive (from Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein).  Clive is a pianist who loses his hands in a train accident.  Lorre is the doctor who gives him new hands from a knife-throwing killer.  Clive starts taking on the killer's traits, and Lorre, obsessed with Clive's wife, tries to goad his patient into self-destruction.  As usual, Lorre's eccentric villainy helps make the movie a good one.  The final movie is The Devil Doll (another Tod Browning movie), featuring Lionel Barrymore as a framed man who has escaped from prison and seeks revenge.  His fellow escapee is a mad scientist who has developed a method for shrinking people and animals.  Unfortunately, these living dolls lose their intelligence and must be mentally controlled by a full-grown person; Barrymore, however, has his ways to make this work to his advantage.

In quality, Mark of the Vampire is probably a high two stars, Doctor X and Return of Doctor X around three, the Devil Doll a high three stars, Mad Love four, and The Mask of Fu Manchu a high four.  With commentaries for all the movies except Devil Doll and some trailers as extras, the set overall rates four stars.  It's not a perfect set, but it is overall a pleasure to watch, especially if you're a fan of classic horror.",1164326400,4,3360,4.654237288135593
2617070,5,B000GRUQJW,"HOLLYWOOD LEGENDS OF HORROR COLLECTION, from Warner Home Video, restores the pleasure of Halloween horror to children of all ages.  These six gems are from a 1930's era when horror movies were downright fun and not slasher films.

We have six movies on three slim volumes.  DOCTOR X (1932, Warners) is a two-color Technicolor delight about moon killings at a lab inside the estate of Lionel Atwill on Long Island.  Lee Tracy is the wise-cracking reporter, and Fay Wray is Atwill's daughter.  Preston Foster is also in the cast.  The password is ""synthetic flesh.""  On the same disk is RETURN OF DOCTOR X (1939, Warner), a 62 minute programmer most notable for Humphrey Bogart's performance as a zombie.  Both of these movies come with audio commentaries by film scholars.

Volume two has Karloff as a Chinese warlord sadist and Myrna Loy as his Oriental play thing in the wonderfully campy and outrageously politically incorrect MASK OF FU MANCHU (1932, MGM).  Lionel Barrymore, Elizabeth Allan, and Bela Lugosi star in MARK OF THE VAMPIRE (1935, MGM).  Tod Browning directed this sound remake of his own ""lost"" silent LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT (1927).  It is a lot of fun, with a twist ending.  Both movies come with film scholar audio commentaries.

Volume three may be the best, with the macabre and eerie MAD LOVE (1935, MGM).  Concert pianist Colin Clive loses his hands in a train accident at the same time that killer Edward Brophy dies by guillotine.  Psychopath Peter Lorre grafts Brophy's hands onto Clive's, with bizarre results.  Karl Freund (THE MUMMY) directed with great visual flair.  And Tod Browning's THE DEVIL-DOLL (1936, MGM) is an outright lulu.  Lionel Barrymore, falsely convicted of a crime and sent to Devil's Island, escapes after several years, with a plan to miniaturize toys for psycho revenge.  He wants confessions from the true killers.  Wait until you see Lionel dressed up as a sweet old lady committing homicide.  The climax is dazzling and the ending, with Maureen O'Sullivan and Frank Lawton as lovers, is unexpectedly romantic.  Both movies have theatrical trailers, and MAD LOVE has an audio commentary.

The three disks all have beautiful color poster art covers, plus a very colorful box.  Play the set over three nights and realize how subtle and eerie horror films can be.  Make them to antidote to the FRIDAY THE 13TH and SAW slasher films.  Return to an era when horror movies were downright fun.",1164067200,3,2438,4.940886699507389

While the packaging was nice for a multi-set of old pictures, as compared to the lower quality mill creek packaging, the video quality was nearly identical to the editions of these films I had recorded (using a cheap dvd recorder) from TCM (the low def/ 480 version they put out on cable) and was actually much lower on three of the films than the quality I had saved on my TIVO, again, from TCM. Very disappointed given what I spent on this set. The sound was about what I expected on most of the films though two were, again, lower quality than over the air. It seems many of the reviewers here have never seen these films post remastering and, as a result, didn't know how bad they look here. So, if you have only seen a really bad old VHS transfer, this set will feel like an upgrade but if you have seen these on TCM in the last five years or so, it will feel like you got scammed and wasted your money. I hope this helps you with your shopping. Good luck.

Update: I bought one of the single discs (new in shrinkwrap) for a friend who wanted one and it was NOT the same disc as in the original set. The packaging was the same, insert and slimline case, but the disc was a dvd-r burned copy, not a pressed disc. Essentially, the single discs, even though they are sold individually and shrinkwrapped, appear to be different and suspect. In the three disc set, the same friend bought one (here) and had the same experience with all three discs. In other words, it seems that some of these sets were dvd-r (MOD or are suspect) and did not contain original pressed discs. Just a heads up. So, I paid too much for this but at least it had the original discs, so that is something.",1459900800,7,1734,4.286585365853658

8134246,5,B000GRUQJW,"This is like a one-stop collection of MGM's offer's to the horror genre in the Hollywood Golden Era of the 1930s.  Jumping on the bandwagon that Universal got rolling,  MGM (a studio more widely know for glossy -- and gorgeous-- musicals and important human dramas)  turns out some surprisingly GOOD chillers that are still a lot of fun to watch -- each picture in this collection received the same TLC that MGM provided to their other productions, and the 2 tone early Technicolor process gives ""Doctor X""  a cool comic book feel.  The collection got an equally TLC treatment in the transfer as these DVDs are simply gore-geous!",1435622400,,629,4.787037037037037
8134247,5,B000GRUQJW,"A great collection of classics! Perhaps not what many might consider ""A"" list items, but all are very strong nonetheless (and you get the bonus of seeing a true inspiration for Ren Hoek with Peter Lorre in ""Mad Love"" :) ).

""Mark of the Vampire"" was a Browning film, and in it he seems to work out some scenes that he did not achieve in ""Dracula,"" while duplicating some from the former as well. An interesting study.

Of course, how can you miss with ""The Return of Dr. X?"" Humphrey Bogart, on studio contracts, had reportedly complained of some of the same cheap crook roles he had been assigned, so he was given this! Lauren Bacall said in the ""Bacall on Bogart"" documentary, ""....here's one you may have never seen...."" Well, now is your chance. The great Bogart as a re-animated doctor who seeks blood. :D Ain't nothing like it.

All of these films are well worth seeing many times; the price of the box for 6 features makes this a bargain, and the transfers look great.",1431388800,,975,4.497175141242938
