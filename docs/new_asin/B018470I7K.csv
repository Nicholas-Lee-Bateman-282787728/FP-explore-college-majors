The film is beautifully shot, with many coastal vistas celebrating the unique features of that part of the Irish coast.  But the best part is its portrayal of the culture role of the pub in the life of the village and the surrounding countryside.  Not only did it make you want to go to Ireland, it made you wish for a pub like that in your own community.  The most moving scene for me was the publican in the church graveyard. I could not help but think that my own ancestors are buried in a similar place.  This film was a wonderful experience that made me eager to see the next entries in the series.  Keven set a standard that will be hard to maintain with this first film.",1464652800,3,845,4.310126582278481
