7892745,5,6305636389,"I bought this for the film The Gorilla.  Comedy-mystery that runs only about 66 minutes, so it doesn't wear out its welcome.  The Ritz Brothers, an acquired taste, are rather funny here as three bumbling detectives trying to protect a businessman threatened by a murderer known as The Gorilla.  Bela Lugosi doesn't have much to do except look menacing.  Patsy Kelly is funny as the frightened maid.  Amusing, fun film.  I bought a used copy of the Roan Group Archival Entertainment DVD release.  Though scratched it played beautifully.  The quality of the transfer is very good and it is probably as good as it will ever get.  Highly recommended.",1393545600,,646,4.853211009174312

7892747,3,6305636389,"This is another worthwhile release in the Roan Archival series. The A picture is a nice clean print of 20th Century Fox's The Gorilla (1939), an ""old dark house"" farce featuring the Ritz Brothers. There are some nice directorial touches by Allan Dwan and good performances from a solid cast that includes Bela Lugosi, Lionel Atwill, Joseph Calleia and Patsy Kelly. How much you enjoy it will depend on how you respond to the Ritz's, a slightly higher brow version of the Three Stooges. The B side of the disc is PRC's Nabonga (1944) with Buster Crabbe, Barton McLane and a very young Julie London. Produced by prolific low budget veterans Sig and Sam Neufeld, the film has all the disadvantages of a no budget jungle picture - cheap sets, potted plants, a familiar looking gorilla suit and grainy stock footage of people on safari and various jungle critters. On the plus side, Sam keeps the story moving, Crabbe and McLane turn in solid performances and London looks good in a sarong. However, it's easy to see why she never had much of a career on the screen. This is actually one of Sam Neufeld /Newfield's better B's - it has more action than you usually see in a PRC, some nice comic bits and a surprisingly modern portrayal of a black African servant. While tthe print is worn and a little ragged in spots, it is certainly watchable.",1001030400,8,1339,4.606694560669456
