8417897,5,B0047BEZAE,"I have great respect and admiration for Master Tan based on his writings and previous DVD's. I purchased this one the second I heard about it.

This is not a how-to on traditional Tiger Claw Kung Fu, but exercises, theories and techniques to utilize the formidable tiger claw in conjunction with modern self-defense. Clearly and soundly presented with great production values, this should be added to your DVD library if you're a traditional tiger claw practitioner, or if you're a self-defense student and you'd like to add the tiger claw technique to your arsenal.

Everything furthers. Thanks, Master Tan!",1378252800,,608,5.1313131313131315
8417898,5,B0047BEZAE,"Lawrence Tan did an excellent job of explaining and demonstrating his progressive system of martial arts based on the movements of the tiger. He has shown respect for the past while moving the art forward to meet the needs of today's
changing times and the individual martial artist.
Thank you for doing what few other martial arts DVD's do........Presenting something that can actually be applied and
most important, Creating a Balance of the past and present.",1368057600,2,461,5.078947368421052
