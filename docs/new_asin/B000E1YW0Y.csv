The DVD is broken down into 2 parts with 32 minutes dedicated to The Last Supper preparation in Part 1 and a 53 minute bonus teaching on ""The Miracle of the Holy Temple"" including the history of the Temple shown in computer animation of what it would have looked like over 2,000 years ago. The Temple Institute of Jerusalem give a guided tour and great history of The Holy Temple including objects and furniture that were used as well as the garments worn by the High Priest.  I found the teachings to be very informative and easy to understand. This DVD can be useful to both Jews and Christians because it shows that we have more in common than we may think and are all nourished from the same roots.

Personally, I would have loved a longer section of The Lord's Supper, since I am very interested in the foods eaten during Biblical times and that are still eaten to this day. Only about the last 8 minutes of this section of the DVD is spent on discussion of the actual foods with brief mentioning on preparing for the unleavened bread, stuffing of grape leaves, spices used, figs, dates, fruits, lentil, vegetables and rice. Part 2 begin by showing a modern day Jewish family sitting down at the table in observance of the Passover Seder with a great explanation of what is taking place at the table. The way Jesus and his disciples would have celebrated the feast is covered as well. Overall, the message taken from the teachings is that the blood of the Lamb saved and delivered the children of Israel out of the bondage of slavery from Egypt and that is the significance for the Passover Seder; Last Supper meal celebration.

Aerial views of Jerusalem are shown during the Spring time with the Almond trees blossoming, beautiful terrain, mountains and lush greenery is breathtaking to watch.  The 1 month of pre-planning and preparation prior to the Springtime feast is discussed in a little more detail by showing how Jesus and his 12 disciples would have spent that time preparing for the Passover Seder meal that took place in the Upper Room. Biblical stories are told of the Israelites leaving Egypt on Passover night and marking of the doorposts with the blood of The Lamb explaining the reason for the Passover celebration. I found this DVD  to be very helpful and highly recommend for use in Bible Study and if you are personally interested in learning the basics about Biblical foods and the Passover Seder; Last Supper.",1364169600,,2587,4.714601769911504
8104476,1,B000E1YW0Y,"This dvd is called ""The Amazing Story of the Last Supper""...that title is simply misleading. There is no ""story"" here....just what foods might have been eaten at the last supper, and how they were prepared. I was expecting a great dvd w/up-to-date interviews w/ Bible scholars, etc., but this dvd delivers none. Sure, it tells the basic story of the last supper, but it spends more time on the food! I'm sure that people would like to know what kinds of foods were eaten that day out of curiosity, but not watch a dvd where it's the focal point. I bought this dvd expecting a faith-based documentary, not a biblical version of a cooking show!",1195257600,5,642,4.591304347826087
