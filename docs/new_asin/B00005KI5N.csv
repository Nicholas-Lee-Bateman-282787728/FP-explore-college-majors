7943345,2,B00005KI5N,"I've never been to Oregon. I planned to go there after travelling in north California because I heard that Oregon has a very beautiful nature. But after watching this video there was no desire to go there. Maybe the state is really beautiful, I don't know, the video does not show it. There was not a single place shown in the film which provoked my nature-loving feelings. It is not a professional filming. Operator(s) mostly did not film places waiting (or coming early) for a nice sunlight, rather shooting nature during peak sun hours which created harsher shadows and very pale colours. The quality of image is mediocre at best, and it looks like this is not because of the quality of DVD, but because of the quality of equipment they used. This is a review of the DVD, not of Oregon state!",1343779200,3,795,4.566433566433567
7943346,5,B00005KI5N,"This DVD is aptly subtitled because Oregon truly is a state of wonder! I feel qualified to make such a statement because it is my place of birth, where I grew up and where I have my roots firmly planted. This DVD shows and describes beautifully the many facets of this gorgeous state in a clear, well-organized, succinct manner. It is a beautiful synopsis of a truly magnificent state. I brought this DVD back with me to Germany, where I have been living for many years, in order to be 'home ' at the touch of a finger and I have ordered two more, one for my sister, who also lives in Germany and one for my travel companion.",1290297600,2,625,4.260504201680672
7943347,4,B00005KI5N,"I received this DVD from a prospective employer wanting me to move to Oregon.  It must have worked in part, since I did.  I would have no problem sending this out to anyone I want to entice to move to, or visit Oregon.  It does a fairly good job showing all of the salient points of interest in Oregon. Each major region of the state is represented, starting with a view of the state map for reference, including highlights of the bigger cities.  It is filmed in a travel-log style with the requisite narration that you would expect.  It gave me a better appreciation on the differences of each region and what they had to offer.  There is some history on the state thrown in as well.  The picture quality is adequate.  The information presented kept my interest throughout the film.  After viewing the other DVD on Oregon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oregon-Splendor-PBS/dp/B002IGHX36/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oregon Splendor (PBS)</a>), I found this one to be the best out there.  Yes, it would be great if it were cheaper and had a better picture quality, but I would have no problem recommending this DVD to anyone who wants a great overview of what the state has to offer.",1263081600,7,1221,5.0
7943348,2,B00005KI5N,"This film manages to show some of the natural wonders of the state of Oregon, but spends way too much camera time on trashy side-of-the-road ""attractions""...and the makers also had a thing for showing intersections in the middle of small towns and the traffic lights therein for some unknown reason, and boy does he have a thing for lava fields too - one or two were quite enough, thank you...not very professionally done at all...and the narration will drive you insane if you listen to it all the way through...my advice - don't. Want to see Oregon? Visit sometime...it's gorgeous, but don't waste money on this thing.",1229817600,2,620,4.803738317757009
7943349,4,B00005KI5N,"This program takes you all through the scenic points of Oregon with some very quick stops in major cities. I bought it primarily to get a better idea of the state since I was going up there later that year, but found that most of it was focused on the natural beauty, rivers, lakes, forests, waterfalls, open road, animals, etc. of the state. Don't get me wrong, all that is very lovely and beautiful, I just had the impression that I would get to see more of the cities themselves. While the program does feature some sights of Portland and a few other major cities, its extremely limited and left me feeling like I was missing a lot.

Its a nice program, and yes there are glimpses here and there of cities and museums, but really about 80% of it is forests, nature, lakes, etc. If you're not really into that, you will become bored....really fast. I happen to not mind it, so that's why this gets 4 stars, one star short of perfect because there's not enough of the city life, the people, music, culture, etc.",1178064000,7,1012,4.411764705882353
