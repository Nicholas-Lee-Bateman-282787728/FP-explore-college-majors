7816609,5,6301911806,"Jonny Quest was an action-adventure cartoon series from 1964-65. This vhs was released by Hanna Barbera in February of 1991, packaged in a cardboard slipcover. There is one 30 minute episode on this tape, a terrific choice and considered by many to be in the top 10 of all the 26 episodes produced. Originally aired on Dec. 24, 1964, this was the 15th episode in the series.

The episode occurs in an exotic location as usual, this time the jungles of South America near the Amazon. In the episode a maniacal white slaver named ""Deen"" (in a wheel chair) has trained a flying dinosaur pteranodon, ""Turu"" to be his muscle. On command, Turu can swoop down on local natives and fly them back to Deen's cave, the local population lives in terror of this beast.. Deen has a mine where a large number of kidnapped slaves are forced to work. Turu is well trained and will do anything for Deen, and his master loves him like a pet. (They never do tell you where you get a pteranadon). Naturally Deen uses Turu to attack the meddling Quest team, when they start poking around. The gang gets to use really cool rocket packs to fly in the episode, and that had to be every kids dream when they saw it.

The images in this episode are incredible. Turu is a pteranodon, and he is scary in flight with his screams as he hunts down the Quest team. In the credit sequence that is used for all the episodes, they have bits and clips from various episodes. This episode was one of the most widely used for this purpose.  Four clips used from this episode in the series opening/closing sequence include the pteranodon flying  through the sky; Race and Dr. Quest flying with portable rocket packs; the crocodile and panther shots, (these 2 animal shots are also used in another episode, it's a practice used by animators to save money.)

A team consisting of Jonny Quest, an 11 year old boy, his father the brilliant scientist Dr. Quest,the doctors govenrment provided bodyguard Race Bannon; and the mysterious Hadji, who was informally adopted by the team when he saved Race from a dagger in India. Jonny Quest is an action-adventure show. The reasons for its success are simple, a dramatic storyline with realistic characters that travel the globe solving mysteries. Unlike most cartoons of the time period, it took its audience seriously rather than talking down to kids. It had gentle humor just the same. Lots of hi-tech gadgets and transportation, as well as exotic places and culture, and a cool soundtrack made it one of the most exciting shows ever released for kids.

7816610,5,6301911806,"In this episode the Quest Team flies in their jet to a village in Tibet, where the natives are terrified of mysterious snow creatures no one can prove exist, basically abominable snowmen.. But some at the local monastery seem to have a different view. First aired on March 4, 1965 on ABC during prime time, it was the second to last episode made. (There is a title flub on the vhs box by the way, and it is a common one. If you view the film and credits you will see the real title is not plural ""Monsters"", but singular ""Monster"".) This vhs has only one 30 minute episode, but it is a very exciting one. This copy was released in 1991 by Hanna-Barbera Video, prior to a 1996 release of episode videos from Turner Video/Cartoon Network. That set has cleaned up images and two episodes per tape, but not this episode. If you are a big fan, check the 2004 release of the boxed dvd set, contining all 26 episodes.

Jonny Quest is an action-adventure-spy cartoon series from 1964-65, that has seemed to carry a strong flame in the hearts of its fans. The reasons for the shows success are simple, a dramatic storyline with realistic characters that travel the globe solving mysteries. Unlike most cartoons of the time period, it took it's audience seriously rather than talking down to kids. Lots of hi-tech gadgets and transportation, as well as real exotic places, and a jazzy soundtrack made it one of the most exciting shows ever released for kids.

Word of warning, if you have vhs tapes of this show, hang onto them as the 2004 dvd set butchered the titles and they do not match the episodes.",1113782400,,1594,4.5121107266435985
7816611,4,6301911806,"Because the company was known for producing animated cartoons on a shoestring budget, Hanna-Barbera dramatically changed directions somewhat with the groundbreaking adventure series ""Jonny Quest"" in 1964.  Although the show only lasted one season (being revived in the 1980's with a new version), it presented the exploits of a young teen, his Indian companion Hadji, his scientist-father Benton, and their protective bodyguard Race.
This particular episode features our band encountering a remnant from the prehistoric past in the form of a pterodactyl that somehow managed to survive into present-day South America.  As a pet to a deranged wheelchair-bound megalomaniac, the ""bird"" provides many hair-raising thrills as the crew tries to escape its murderous talons.
While the animation lacks quality of even second-rate Disney, it still holds up fairly well after all these years.  The incidental music, one of the show's highlights, helps to set the pace for the on-screen perils.  ""Guest star"", the late character actor, Everett Sloane, is fine as the riches-craved despot.",1012003200,6,1078,5.554878048780488
