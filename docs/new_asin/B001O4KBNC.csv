3728244,5,B001O4KBNC,"I started watching ""Peyton Place"" back in 1964 when the very first episode
aired (yes, I'm old!) and was crazy about it.  I have to admit that the big attraction for me was Barbara Parkins, an extremely beautiful woman and a fine, fine actress!  The series was thoroughly enjoyable and featured a cast of sensational actors and actresses.  I had pretty much
given up on the show ever coming to DVD, so I am especially thrilled that
it has!  Ah, wonderful memories of my youth!  Thank you for finally putting it out and please release the entire series!!",1237420800,6,553,4.6020408163265305
3728245,5,B001O4KBNC,"Before ""Desperate Housewives"", before ""Dallas"", before ""Knot's Landing"", and before the granddaddy of them all ""Dynasty"" there was ""Peyton Place"", television's very first primetime soap opera.
 By the end of 1963 networks saw the amount of ad revenue CBS was making off their daytime lineup of dramatic shows, and ABC felt there were potential ratings points waiting in the evening for a well written serial. ""Peyton Place"" debut on September 15, 1964 and became a smash hit. Airing twice a week, the series made stars out of Mia Farrow and Ryan O'Neal, who played  star-crossed lovers Allison and Rodney. Oscar winner Dorothy Malone received top billing as Constance, Allison's mother who bore a terrible secret. Viewers couldn't get enough of the complicated stories, back stabbing, and romance that filled the airwaves when ""Peyton Place"" aired.
 Airing 514 episodes ""Peyton Place"" still holds the record in 2009 as the only primetime series to air without reruns and without any hiatus period during the summer months. The show played just like a regular daytime serial. It became so popular that by June,1965 ABC aired it 3 times a week.
 The DVD version of ""Peyton Place-Part 1"" features 31 half hour episodes filmed in glorious black and white. Thank you FOX and Shout! for bringing back a true classic from the 1960's. I for one cannot wait to view the series as I wasn't even born when the show started. Being a follower of soap opera my whole life I have heard nothing but great things about this classic sudser.
 There is also more great news for ""Peyton Place"" fans; not only is this new DVD set coming out in May, but on July 14th, 2009 Shout! will be immediately releasing ""Peyton Place-Part 2""! We soap fans are in Heaven!",1236643200,23,1737,4.835016835016835
3728246,5,B001O4KBNC,"Yes, there Is a Santa Clause !!!
I have been waiting for the DVD Release of this iconic TV Series for years and now PEYTON PLACE is promised! See the Discussions Board about the series and you will find other people wandering around in the DVD desert, searching for their PEYTON PLACE. I see Shout is releasing this box set, and although it is Part One, I hope they don't do what Fox Studios have done with the MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW ---- releasing early seasons individually and then releasing the remaining seasons only as part of a COMPLETE SERIES box set.......... Please don't do this to us Shout.......
Other reviewers have conjured up great memories of PEYTON PLACE TV Series, but nobody has mentioned the great performance by Lee Grant, who pulled out all the stops and delivered a sledgehammer performance in her role. She won an Emmy as Best Supporting Actress in a TV Series for her work .. and belive me, she certainly deserved it... Ms Grant was obviosuly determined to leave her mark after having been ""blacklisted"" for years after the McCarthy anti-communistic witchhunts of the latter 1950's...
Also nobody has mentioned the wonderful, haunting theme music-- taken from the 20th Century-Fox film, starring Lana Turner and Diane Varsi....
This will bring back 1960's memories ---look at the size and length of the cars they drive... everybody are taking medication for something, popping doctor's prescriptions all the time.... see the fashions change, and Barbara Perkins becoming increasingly more and more beautiful as the series progresses.
See too-- the famous HAIRCUT of Mia Farrow --the one that made headlines, ( no pun intended) right around the world....
Oh it;s going to be great to see all that shouting, screaming, murdering, plotting,  lying and cheating --- all in a normal Peyton Place day ---- going on again.
To heck with the current economic downturn --- give me PEYTON PLACE and another plate of lobster dinner at the Inn. I'll then take a rest and sit awhile in the band rotunda in the Town Square and wonder who killed whom... and more importantly. will Dorothy Malone's eyelashes stay on, with all that fluttering.
I wanted this DVD set and now I'm a gonna get it.... It's a truly iconic TV Series--- the great granddaddy of all TV series and soaps --especially the medical servies and the soap operas we hate to love ....
And without giving anything away, just wait until the episodes burst into colour..it's such a wonderful shock !",1236470400,27,2471,4.855450236966824
3728247,5,B001O4KBNC,"Ever since I seen the Valley of the Dolls 40th Anniversary DVD Special. (see my review) and A Taste of Evil, hee, hee, famous line, "" Work up an healthy appetite, I have hamburgers piled to the ceiling."" I have became a Barbara Parkins fan. However, Barbara's best work is from good, used to bad girl Betty Anderson in Peyton Place. Fortunately, I have been able to start watching the series from copies from t.v. to dvd. However, like other fans, I am glad this is finally on dvd as a collector's set. I think later volumes should be released on dvd with interviews from the original stars, especially Parkins, and with other surprises. T.V. show is great. Setting is in a small New England town with skeletons in every closet.

Other great performaces include Dorothy Malone as the sexy Constance MacKenzie with the disposition of June Cleaver but with a Marilyn Monroe body, Ed Nelson, the ever so handsome Dr. Rossi, Casey Rogers, the second Lousie Tate on Bewitched, as the abused adultress housewife Julie Anderson, Tim O'Connor, returned convict Elliott Carson, and Ryan O'Neal and Mia Farrow as lovers bad boy, Rodney Harrington, and virgin Allison MacKenzie.

Show was the first night time soap, which was the grandfather for shows like Dallas, Knots Landing and Dynasty. Also, show created two t.v. movies, Murder in Peyton Place and Peyton Place: The Next Generation.

Funny Moments:
The Unintentional Funny Award goes to Dorothy Malone as the over serious beautiful mother of Allison, who bats her false eye lashes in serious content as she listens to everyone around her. Funniest episode so far is when Constance hollers at Julie Anderson after she finds out Allison's father has been shot, ""Get Out of My Way."" and then regains her composure as the perfect house wife and saids, ""Sorry Julie."" You will love this show. Buy it and have a block party at your house.",1235174400,7,1878,4.826086956521739
3728248,5,B001O4KBNC,"Peyton Place the place they we were all talking about in the sixties when things were not to be talked about. There was so much controversy and hush-hush. Drawn from a real-life small town. For 5 seasons of secrets ,lies and sex we found ourselves wraped up and glued 3 nights a week until its final hour. At 9:30 pm on ABC for a half-hour of the best television could offer in the turbulent 60's. The first successful night time soap that paved the way for all the night time soaps that followed. Well here we are finally going to see Peyton Place in Glorious Black and White all over again in the 21st century on our 50inch TV screens it doesen't get better than that. Thank-you Shout Factory for giving Peyton Place another place in life back where it belongs. Now a new generation can see what we couldn't resist from talking about and looked forward to seeing week after week.",1235001600,9,881,4.444444444444445
3728249,5,B001O4KBNC,"Love, lust, backstabbing, murder and illicit secrets. Dallas, Dynasty, Knotts Landing - or maybe The Simpsons? Wrong! Those themes and many more touched the lives of those who inhabited Peyton Place, the first-ever TV primetime soap opera.

By today's standards those storielines may seem tame, but in 1964 when the show premiered they were risque and shocking, more so even than the two theatrical movies that had preceded it, because this WAS TV, gosh darn it!

Peyton Place ran on ABC in half-hour episodes from Sept. 15, 1964 to June 2, 1969, racking up a total 514 episodes. In a truly historic five-disc boxed set DVD release, Shout! Factor has collected the first two seasons that were broadcast in black and white. The remainder of the series was aired in color. (Note, this is only the second true TV soap opera to receive a DVD release - the first was the iconic daytime gothic series, `Dark Shadows.' It also ran on ABC for five years.)

Peyton Place boasted an almost unprecedented cast of talented actors, two of whom got their start on the show but ended as movie stars: Mia ""Rosemary's Baby"" Farrow and Ryan ""Love Story"" O'Neal. The stellar cast was lead by Academy Award winner Dorothy Malone.

Executive producer Paul Monash rejected the ""soap opera"" label for Peyton Place, referring to it instead as a ""television novel."" The series was, in fact, based on the Grace Metalious novel. Interestingly, it ended up as the ONLY primetime series that ran continuously, never repeating a single broadcast in summer reruns.

The series took place in the title town, which was founded by the Peyton family, whose members included the Harringtons. Like any good soap opera, the plots were deliciously complicated. A few early plots involved Rodney Harrington, the oldest son, choosing between the town's bad girl and the respectable girl. His brother took up with the working class girl, while Ms. Malone's character was keeping a very private secret of her own.

Thus, characters married, divorced, loved and lost. Secrets were the staples of the show, but there was also a healthy dose of illicit passion, murder, and insanity.

Episodes began by depicting a church steeple. The title ""Peyton Place"" overlays the image as the church bells tone. An uncredited voice proclaims: ""This is the continuing story of `Peyton Place.'"" The scene changes to the town square, a rolling brook, then a panoramic view of the town. It dissolves to photos of cast members, and a brief recap of previous episodes narrated by Warner Anderson, who also played Matthew Swain. (Anderson left the series after the first season, but continued to offer his voice talents until the final episode.) The memorable theme song, ""Wonderful Season of Love,"" was composed by Franz Waxman, the lyrics written by Paul Francis Webster.

When the show premiered in 1964, Peyton Place aired twice a week. Both installments of the show were Top 20 hits in the Nielsen Ratings, inspiring ABC to air it three times a week in the fall of 1965. But, this move caused viewership to dip sharply and its popularity steadily declined. The series was cut back to two weekly episodes the following season, but it continued to lose its audience. In 1969 it was cut back to one weekly installment until it ended in June.

The core cast included: Ms. Malone as Constance MacKenzie Carson (1964-1968); Tim O'Connor as Elliot Carson (1965-1968); Ms. Farrow as Allison Mackenzie (1964-1966); O'Neal as Rodney Harrington; Christopher Connelly as Norman Harrington; Paul Langton as Leslie Harrington (1964-1968); Barbara Parkins as Betty Anderson Harrington Cord Harrington; Patricia Morrow as Rita Jacks Harrington (1965-1969); Evelyn Scott as Ada Jacks (1965-1969); Ed Nelson as Dr. Michael Rossi; George Macready as Martin Peyton (1965-1968); James Douglas as Steven Cord; and Ruth Warrick as Hannah Cord (1965-1967).

In the premiere episode, Dr. Rossi arrives in Peyton Place by train. He is picked up at the station by Rodney Harrington and his girlfriend Betty. When they drive him to the inn, Rossi catches his father kissing his secretary - Betty's mother!

The show was one of the first seen on network television to talk about sex and infidelity in a frank manner. As such, ABC brass would only allow the show to be aired at 9:30 p.m. Eastern/Pacific time, when children and teenagers were expected to be in bed. With the show in a ratings slump in 1968, the show was moved to 8:30 p.m. to draw in a larger audience - courting younger viewers they had once eschewed.

The series was revived briefly as a daytime serial `Return to Peyton Place' from April 3, 1972 to Jan. 4, 1974. Three of the actors from the primetime series reprised their roles - Frank Ferguson as Eli Carson, Patricia Morrow as Rita Harrington, and Evelyn Scott as Ada Jacks.

Peyton Place guest stars included a host of well-known actors: David Canary, who along with Ms. Warrick, is best known for their roles on ABC's popular daytime soap All My Children; James ""Star Trek"" Doohan; Mickey ""The Monkey"" Dolenze; Barbara Rush; Susan Oliver; Ruby Dee; Leslie Nielson; Greg ""Mission:Impossible"" Morris; Joan ""Knotts Landing"" Van Ark; Joyce Jillson; Diana Hyland; Gena Rowlands; Lana Wood; Erin O'Brien-Moore (who was in the original film,); Mariette Hartley; Frank Ferguson; John Kerr; Joan Blackman; Wilfred-Hyde White; Leigh Taylor-Young; and Dan Duryea.

Let's hope Shout! Factory follows this wonderful release with the remainder of this historic TV series.",1234656000,64,5494,5.023076923076923
3728290,4,B001O4KBNC,"Although not a perfect show by any means, it's easy to get hooked. Deft writing, good casting, and an over-arching philosophy espoused in which life is not filled with black-and-white morality, situations, circumstances, decisions, etc., but rather it is far more complex and difficult to judge what is truly right and wrong, who is really responsible or to blame. This is what I enjoy about the show the most. Did Constance do the right thing by lying to her daughter about who her father really was? How and when could she tell Allison that she was born out of wedlock AND that her father is in prison for murder? Was Rodney's father right in not turning in his wife and Rodney's mother for Eliot Carson's wife's murder when this father was having the affair with the murdered woman? He let someone else take Eliot Carson take the blame and spend 18 years in prison, but could he take away his sons' mother from them? Clearly, very difficult challenges.

Of course, while American cities were burning, Vietnam was raging, and there were major political assassinations in the 1960s, this show seemed out of touch with those political realities, (and you won't find a non-white in any show I've seen and I've watched more than 240), but this show, in its own way makes a political statement by stating that simple answers to difficult questions do not exist and easy moralizing and judgment is expedient and deluded.

BTW, there is a website or two where bootleg copies of the entire series is available if you look. The quality is so-so at best, but it's good enough.",1474416000,,1568,4.718978102189781

3728296,5,B001O4KBNC,"Despite being somewhat denigrated as mere soap-opera, this twice weekly drama series which premiered in 1964 and became an enormous hit with television audiences, ""Peyton Place"" holds up quite brilliantly some five decades later.
Extremely well written and directed with believable characters and plot lines. ""Peyton Place"", much like the 1957 film version, is far superior to its source material and is engrossing entertainment.
Anchored by a solid trio of stars in Dorothy Malone, Warner Anderson and Ed Nelson, the series introduced future stars Mia Farrow, Ryan O'Neal and Barbara Parkins in breakthrough roles and provided a showcase for the talents of fine supporting actors such as Paul Langton, Patricia Breslin, Kasey Rogers, Henry Beckman, Kent Smith and Tim O'Connor.

A special mention to the brilliant New England set built by the 20th. Century-Fox production designers and the wise decision to retain the beautiful Franz Waxman theme music from the original film.  This brilliant piece of music is one of the greatest in film history and gives the television series a real touch of class.
Simply put, this collection of the first 31 episodes is addictive viewing: splendidly acted, well paced and intriguing sub plots and superb production values make this continuing story a television highlight.",1456012800,5,1311,5.359223300970874

3728439,4,B001O4KBNC,"Television in the mid 60's was a hotbed of creativity, part of which included the introduction of Peyton Place (1964-69), the first prime time soap opera, based on the novel by Grace Metalious.  The half hour drama on ABC, followed the lives of the residents of the New England township of Peyton Place, located some 90 miles from Boston.  For the first season, the series aired twice weekly, and produced 64 episodes.  Peyton Place Part One contains 31 episodes on 5 DVD's, while Part 2 contains the remaining 33 episodes.

Peyton Place was a ratings success, attracting viewers by featuring strong characters, interesting storylines, and quality acting by a talented ensemble cast, which included Dorothy Malone, Ed Nelson, Ryan O'Neal, Mia Farrow, Christopher Connelly, and Barbara Parkins (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puppet-On-A-Chain/dp/B006HLBDAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puppet On A Chain</a>).

The story is developed on several fronts, following the wealthy and influential Harrington family, the struggles of Michael Rossi (Nelson), a doctor who has come to Peyton Place to take over the practice a deceased physician, and Constance MacKenzie (Malone), a shop owner with some dark secrets.  Compared to modern soaps, the subject matter might seem lightweight or quaint, however for the time period, the topics were quite provocative, compelling, and even scandalous.  It is no surprise that many became hooked on following the happenings at Peyton Place.  Some spoilers follow.

The 31 episodes in Part One, cover several main story arcs that overlap to some extent.  Rodney Harrington (O'Neal) is in the thick of things, as he discovers that his father Leslie (Paul Langton) is romantically involved with his secretary Julie Anderson (Kasey Rogers), who also happens to be the mother of his ex-girlfriend Betty (Parkins).  Rodney is attempting to begin a new relationship with Allison MacKenzie (Farrow), but his life changes when Betty reveals that she is pregnant with his child.  Rodney's mother tragically dies, when doctor Rossi performs an emergency operation.  The death results in an investigation of Rossi, and also affects Leslie Harrington's plans to take over a business founded by his wife's family.  Shopkeeper Constance MacKenzie (Malone) is concerned by Rossi's appearance, as he was in attendance at the hospital when her daughter Allison was born.

The drama does a good job of establishing a community that viewers can identify with, whether positively or negatively.  Secrets are a big part of the scene, and like any good soap, the storyline is often stretched out and slow developing, keeping viewers hanging as long as possible.  Back in 1964, adultery, premarital sex, and pregnancy, had a greater social stigma than they do today, and the feeling that these were weighty matters of a ""forbidden"" nature is quite evident.  There are few violent criminal acts, but there is deception, deceit, and suspense.  Although relatively tame, even in comparison to a 70's soap like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dallas/dp/B00028G7LG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dallas</a>, the down to earth drama of Peyton Place, was still a compelling watch for millions of viewers.

The quality of the writing is generally good, and is complemented by the acting, which is usually at a high level.  If there is an issue, it is with the character development of some of the younger characters.  Allison MacKenzie is a 17 year old, who sometimes has the mentality of a schoolgirl, and at other times has the maturity of a woman.  Betty Anderson is close to the same age, but seems much more mature.  She tricks Rodney into marrying her, and is prepared to challenge Leslie Harrington to get what she wants.  With an abusive father, Betty has one of the more stormy storylines, in the first season.

Image quality of the program is good, but not great, as the 31 black and white episodes are spread across five discs.  Unfortunately, there are no bonus materials.  As the first prime time soap, fans of 60's television may appreciate seeing what Peyton Place was about, and the action becomes more heated in the second half of the first season.

Looking back, the drama may seem dated, but quality of the acting can certainly be appreciated, as the series helped launch the movie careers of Mia Farrow, and Ryan O'Neal, among others.  Farrow, encouraged by then husband Frank ""Chairman of the boards"" Sinatra, would leave the series after a couple of years, and rise to stardom in the classic horror thriller,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rosemary-s-Baby/dp/B008MPQ0G8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rosemary's Baby</a>&nbsp;(1968).

3728443,5,B001O4KBNC,"The 60's were a time when melodrama was raised in scope to epic proportions. The Peyton Place TV series was perhaps the most successful to create a tragic mystique haunting each episode (similar to Quinn Martin's The Fugitive) and pulling the viewer into the tangled web of soap opera reality.

The actor's were outstanding, but so were the writers: Grace Metalious, John Wilder, Rita Lakin, Sonya Roberts, Robert J. Shaw, Carol Sobieski, Peggy Shaw--to name a few, and directors Ted Post, Walter Doniger, John Newland, Jeffrey Hayden--to name a few, even the inventive and quality production values helped make this evening soap rise to the heights of great drama. The frequent use of film noir lighting and creative camera angles added to the atmosphere of the sometimes dark and disturbing story lines.

The opening narration (Warner Anderson) and music (Arthur Morton and Franz Waxman) were also key for achieving a serious level of entertainment in this television classic.",1332633600,2,978,5.1835443037974684
3728444,5,B001O4KBNC,"For me ""Peyton Place"" (1964 - 1969) was for so many years (since 1970 when France aired all 514 episodes) a big mystery, a TV series not aired on German TV before the early nineties and then they only aired the color episodes (???).
So for the past 40+ years I wanted to watch the entire 514 episodes plus the two TV movies that were filmed a few years later.
And now we can only get volume 1 and volume 2, that's not even the first 70 episodes.

Come on, Shout Factory, PLEASE PLEASE release volume 3 and 4 next year and then volume 5 and 6 in 2013, because otherwise we will have to wait for the final volume until the next decade or so :(!

It took forever to release all 4 seasons from ""The Fugitive"" (David Janssen), because only 15 episodes per half season (why only half a season?) were released at a time. So why is Shout Factory making the same mistake?

It shows how far the standards for today's television programs have fallen. There are few exceptions like The Sopranos, Nurse Jackie and The Good Wife. These actors care about their craft.
I have contacted the maker of the DVDs to see if there will be more and they are working to acquire the rights. It showed the potential of Mia Farrow, Ryan O'Neal and Barbra Parkins. When more episodes become available, it shows how when Mia Farrow hooked up with Frank Sinatra and left the show, how it changed the direction of the series. Ryan O'Neal also  benifited from the exposure the series gave him. We also saw the making of stars such as Melanie Griffin, who then called herself Tippy Walker so nobody knew she was Tippi Hedren's Daughter.

3728470,3,B001O4KBNC,"I was one of millions of viewers who were addicted to the Peyton Place TV series back in the '60s. ABC never repeated the telecasts, and none of the very few attempts by local affiliates to run them in syndication years later lasted more than a very brief while. So I was thrilled when I saw that the series was finally being released on DVD, and I bought the first two installments. (One can't really speak of a ""season"" of Peyton Place, since it ran all year without any repeats.) My first reactions were mixed. The quality of the image varies; there are far too many scenes where everything is so dark you can't even see the actors' facial features--I don't recall it looking that way originally; obviously there has been deterioration of the film. And, judging from the two sets that have been released, I had also not recalled how truly bizarre and banal much of the dialogue is. Non sequiturs follow each other in rapid succession, almost like a parody of soap operas. But it is still enormous fun to watch extremely young incarnations of Ryan O'Neal, Barbara Parkins and Mia Farrow--they're supposed to be in their teens, but at the start of the series were actually 23, 22 and 19, respectively--and you do find yourself getting drawn into the storyline. But, like those early syndication efforts, this is another case of being left hanging. There have been no further DVD releases, and I see no plans for any. The two five-disc sets released contain a total of 64 episodes, a drop in the bucket when you consider that the series ran for 514 episodes. So there's no point in investing your time and money to wind up in a dead end.",1271289600,28,1637,4.571428571428571

This is the closest that TV comes to DARK SHADOWS in terms of addictive story lines, and brilliant characterisations.  All the members of the cast have incredible screen presences - some bordering on camp, such as Mr. Harington who speaks as a man posssessed with two demonic voices.  The illustrious Constance Mckenzie is ultra feminine, ultra coy, fragile to the point of breaking and certainly the model upon which the Supremes based their wigs and miss ross emulated her flirty style on stage.

3728473,5,B001O4KBNC,"I've said this about other shows that to me, were risky to spend my money on, but I am surprisingly pleased that I found a great new show/soap opera to get addicted to!

I went back and forth on this one repeatedly - I've been so happy with some of the old shows I've bought that I had never seen before because they were from before my time, or some that I vaguely remember liking or loving but knew that didn't mean the show was any good, so I finally took the leap when it went on sale and thank goodness I did!

I really love the feel and look of the show, the storylines which seem timeless in many many ways, the different types of families, and even the ways in which families/wives/husbands/kids/all roles are the same but different today.  It makes me glad I grew up as a woman during the time I did in some ways, and made me long for the way things were back then in so many other ways.

I put it in for a late night, good show to go to sleep to, because old black and white movies are calming for me - but before I knew it, it was 4am and I was finishing the second disc.  Finally had to just turn it OFF to sleep.  Calming and cozy, YES, but the addiction factor takes over and keeps you watching JUST ONE MORE EPISODE, IT'S ONLY 22 MORE MINUTES!

For those non-soap fans, it's really more of a continuing drama with multiple family oriented storylines.  But for Soap opera fans, it's still a win on every level-just not as in your face as today's shows.  I just passed on the first few discs to my mother who didn't watch it way back when but I know is gonna love it even more than I do and am gonna send it to grandma too, I think it's right up her alley and being her prime will bring back great memories.

The first two years are my favorite. They hed some really good writers (Ted and Mathilde Ferro, among them). They also had some good acting by Mia Farrow, Christopher Connelly, Dorothy Malone and Barbara Parkins. Later by Lee Grant.

The DVD release is not very high quality. I have to turn all the lights out in my living room when I watch it, because it's so dark. I guess they did the best they could. It would have been wonderful if they could have added a special commentary by Farrow, O'Neal, Parkins, and Grant.

week.  So my suggestion is to rent the first season and keep your hands on the fast forward clicker but season two don't.  But then it has been so long since I saw it maybe that won't hold up but I bet it does.",1243468800,2,699,4.162962962962963
3728523,5,B001O4KBNC,"While today's soap operas tend to focus on Mobs, tornadoes and event-driven storylines, Peyton Place is a classic example of what an excellent, character-driven drama can and should be. Peyton Place has long been the standard by which other soaps are measured: Life in a small town, where everyone knows everyone else... and secrets lurk behind every white picket fence. The focus of these first 31 episodes is on the young triangle of Alison/Rodney/Betty, and while the morality on display is wildly old fashioned, it's also incredibly refreshing. Longing glances and awkward dates reign supreme. Some reviewers have noted that the quality is not as high as they might have expected, and that dialogue or scenes are missing. As someone who never saw the original, it seems to have no impact on the viewing experience for the uninitiated.",1243296000,10,838,5.079710144927536
3728524,4,B001O4KBNC,"I am very happy to have, finally, this series on DVD. I had not seen any of the episodes before, but it's a great show. Some of the episodes here are presented in a similarly great form: pristine black and white (particularly the first disc -- first six episodes). Others (starting on disc two) look as if they were filmed from a 35mm projection on a wall; still others are very dark. Through the third disk, the episodes are a fairly uniform 25 minutes, but starting on disc four, there are obvious edits to the prints. Oft times it's not noticeable, but occasionally a scene will end or begin oddly and without transition music; in one episode, part of a scene, which was previewed, is missing. Speaking of previews, they are included. The previews are also accessible for each episode, which makes it convenient if one is not watching the entire disc at one time. Finally, as usual, SHOUT! has done a bang-up job on the menu screens, with animation and snippets of dialog to help set the stage for viewers not familiar with the characters. Again, I am glad I have this; I have pre-ordered Part Two; and I hope that better, more consistent prints are found for future episodes.",1243209600,7,1179,4.592417061611374
3728525,1,B001O4KBNC,"After viewing 20 of the 31 episodes, I am glad that I did not discard the shows I have on VHS.  On the DVD, there are several episodes in which scenes are deleted , dialog is cut off in other scenes.  I called Shout Factory to complain, but I doubt it will do any good.  It is particularly upsetting since there are so many fans of the show who waited for so long to have it released on DVD.",1243036800,14,391,3.9240506329113924
3728526,5,B001O4KBNC,"Ok this may sound weird but this show brought our family together in the mid 60s.
I was 10, my brother was 8, my sister was 12. We scattered in every direction after dinner but when it was time for Peyton Place we were all in front of the TV together. One time my mom threw a fit at McDonald's because they closed one of the ordering lines right before we got to the front, making us late for Peyton Place back at home. Ah those were the days.

My most vivid memory of the show (not sure which season) is Susan Oliver laying dead on the rocky beach at the bottom of a cliff. Also, the very last shot of the series that shows Ed Nelson (Dr. Rossi) in jail on murder charges awaiting trial as the camera pulls back.

I can't wait to see if it's as good as I remember it.",1242691200,5,768,3.9805194805194803
3728527,5,B001O4KBNC,"After all this time...can't wait for it to finally be released. Fun, excitement and the fantastic/amazing Barbara Parkins and a team of great actors. It doesn't get much better than this -this show started it all!",1242604800,4,213,4.944444444444445
3728528,5,B001O4KBNC,"""Ever live in a small town? Some morning you're going to wake up and realize that every face you see is familiar. You're going to have a definite feeling about each person, and they're going to have a definite feeling about you. They may love you or hate you, but they won't be indifferent."" So says Clarion newspaper publisher Matthew Swain to newly arrived Dr. Michael Rossi at the conclusion of the first episode. For the next five years, Dr. Rossi and millions of viewers worldwide spent 514 half-hours feeling little indifference toward the residents of Peyton Place, Massachusetts, the most infamous of fictional New England towns.

Although often cited as the progenitor of nighttime soaps such as Dallas, Dynasty, Melrose Place, and Desperate Housewives,  Peyton Place has little in common with those programs other than its serialized format. With a strong emphasis on characterization, the series more closely resembles the earnest verisimilitude of Knots Landing than the camp-infested shenanigans found in contemporary soaps. For instance, in Peyton Place, there are no exploding apartment complexes, machine-gun massacres at fairytale weddings, or heroines disappearing into flying saucers at season's end. Instead, viewers are treated to good, old-fashioned drama rooted firmly in familial conflict and divided allegiances.

For a series whose output was unprecedented in prime-time television (and remains so to this day), Peyton Place is shockingly well-written and superbly directed throughout most of its run. It also boasts one of the best ensemble casts of any nighttime drama in TV history, led by the solid Ed Nelson as physician Mike Rossi, Oscar-winner Dorothy Malone as graceful but guarded Constance MacKenize, Mia Farrow as her ethereal daughter Allison, Ryan O'Neal as moody, confused Golden Boy Rodney Harrington, and the stunning Barbara Parkins as town ""bad girl"" Betty Anderson.

Like any good soap, Peyton Place also has countless supporting players drifting in and out of the narrative with their own story arcs, some lasting for weeks and others for years. Memorable supporting players from these early episodes include Christopher Connelly as Rodney's sensitive younger brother Norman, Paul Langton as manipulative Peyton Mill manager Leslie Harrington, Mary Anderson as his imperious wife Catherine Peyton Harrington, Kasey Rogers as Julie Anderson, Betty's victimized mother and secret love interest to Leslie, Kent Smith as Dr. Morton, who instantly clashes with Mike Rossi, Tim O'Connor as embittered ex-con Elliot Carson, and Patricia Breslin as Laura Brooks, Leslie's wry, lonely sister who acts as a one-woman Greek chorus for her brother's many machinations.

In the first 31 episodes issued by Shout Factory, two arrivals to the seemingly tranquil town of Peyton Place set events in motion. The first is big-city doctor Michael Rossi, who arrives to take over the practice of the recently deceased Dr. Donald Brooks and finds himself entangled in the lives of practically every citizen. Rossi's youth and affinity for cutting edge medical techniques immediately rubs his peers the wrong way, resulting in a short story arc involving a prominent character's death, blackmail, and the suspension of Rossi's hospital privileges. Rossi also has a strange effect on the beautiful, widowed bookstore proprietor Constance MacKenzie, with whom he shares a secret association. Constance's carefully concealed past includes convicted murderer Elliot Carson, poised for parole from prison at the end of the first 30 episodes. Elliot vows to return to Peyton Place after serving 18 years for killing his wife, a crime he insists he didn't commit. His arrival and subsequent attempts to prove his innocence opens a Pandora's Box of secrets involving the Peyton family, triggering almost four years of compelling, non-stop drama that affects all of the major characters in one way or another.

Unlike the novel and film from which it was adapted, the television version of Peyton Place focuses less on the hypocrisy of community values and more on the day to day life in a small town. With that 1960's small town milieu, emphasis on subtlety of characterization, and large cast of recurring players, Peyton Place seems more like a dramatic version of The Andy Griffith Show than a salacious soap opera. Mercifully, for its first 4 years, the setting exists in a sort of Never-neverland, eschewing such topical subjects as Vietnam and student protests, which often seriously date other programs from that era. Although some might find the pace glacial, viewers who enjoy literate scripts, top-notch acting, excellent production values, and a lush musical underscore (by Arthur Morton and Lionel Newman) will definitely love the continuing story of Peyton Place.

It's difficult to hear what the actors are saying, so one turns the volume on high, then in-between scenes when it's music, it is ear-blasting so one rushes to turn the volume down, then back up when the actors start talking again.

It's a typical soap with old fashioned values but moves along with more pace than the soaps of today.  It slowly sucks you in and I'm genuinely enjoying it.  I guess it will be a disappointment when I reach the end of Part 2 as to date there is no more.  I'm glad I took the time to briefly visit and experience Peyton Place. I hope one day there will be a Part 3,1483574400,,534,3.765765765765766
