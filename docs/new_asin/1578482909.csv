196594,5,1578482909,"I teach this film and my students (18-21) love it.  I find it hilarious as well.

You most likely have never seen this, or even heard of it, b/c it was burried by the MPAA ratings board.  Although there is no nudity, no violence and little explicit sexuality, it is about women in search of an sexual pleasure and, thus, received a much harsher rating than American Pie.  It is smarter and wittier than AP (not that hard to do) and the acting is solid.  A very entertaining and progressive film.",1184889600,19,495,4.395604395604396
196595,4,1578482909,"This was a funny ""coming of age"" movie with today's modern teens.  It was enjoying to watch.",1182816000,,92,4.411764705882353
196596,5,1578482909,The young and talented Ms. Bonnie Root gives an all star performance in this coming of age comedy.  She is a real find and I look forward to watching her career progress.,1091318400,3,170,4.3125
196597,4,1578482909,"Cannot say enough about this movie.  Came upon it by chance one night on cable, watched it, watched it again, bought it.  Now, I admit that Henry and his songs to Stream have A LOT to do with it and the fact that you are rooting for her to stop listening to her friend with the really bad wig and 'tude and decide for herself... won't be disappointed.  Is a great get-your-girls-together-and-watch movie!!!!!
Do it!!! You'll thank me later, I promise.",1041033600,,451,4.54320987654321
196598,4,1578482909,"I really enjoyed the story, and found the cast to be excellent! This movie is really one for girls, since I'm pretty sure guys would have a hard time relating to the main theme.  Also, the music from this movie was really good!  I would definlately recommend this movie to any girl in high school or college!",982800000,9,308,4.385964912280702
196599,3,1578482909,"I liked this movie because I had no idea what it was going to be about.  Some of the names were familiar and the story seemed interesting.  I found myself laughing hysterically at the girls obvious immaturity and innocence to what ""real"" pleasure is.  It's a story about three girls getting to know more about who they are as they grow up and learning not to always follow the crowd.",974764800,6,383,4.442857142857143
196600,3,1578482909,The surprise here is the cast!  Not only are there big names sprinkled throughout the production but the cast as a whole is surprisingly good.  On  a sillier note in Thailand this film is being marketed on VCD as American  Pie 2,968112000,,228,4.357142857142857
196601,5,1578482909,"An absolutely charming entry in the coming-of-age field.  Donot be fooled by the.. cover; this is not in any way, shape, or form exploitative.  Instead, it is an intelligent, funny, and thoughtful exploration of the lives and minds of three priviliged NYC teenage girls (the location of this film is quite similar to the Upper East Side location of ""Cruel Intentions"").  We follow the three girls (a foul-mouthed Gaby Hoffman among them) through their various romantic, familial and, yes, sexual tribulations... All of the performances are excellent, and the star-studded supporting cast includes Mia Farrow, Peter Bogdanovich, Yasmine Bleeth, and Spalding Gray.  Like a junior ""Sex and the City"", there is quite a bit of mature (if graphic) sex talk; nonetheless, this is a film that every 15 - 21 year old girl should see.  Oh, and you guys who are big fans of ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"", ""Dick"", and other girlcentric teen flicks will love it too.  In closing, ""Coming Soon"" is arguably the smartest, most mature and most underrated teen flick of the past decade.  If ""Slums of Beverly Hills"" was riot-grrrl cinema, then this movie is pure cinematic Bikini Kill.",967939200,14,1159,5.005208333333333
196602,5,1578482909,I thought this was a great movie and very funny but not for the male gender.  Boys just won't understand and some boys I;ve found find the movie  insulting because they don't think that it could be possible for a girl not  to have an orgasim and it be their fault.  If you do watch this movie watch  it with your girl friends.,965260800,,326,4.111111111111111

196608,3,1578482909,"Sophomoric Humor. Entertaining, but wouldn't say I would recommend it.",1415404800,,70,6.1
196609,4,1578482909,"A humorous look at a very serious problem: most young women today have trouble reaching orgasm, and they don't have a clue why. The main characters are not conservative prudes, quite the contrary - they are bold and fearless in most respects, except when it comes to admitting they all have a problem.

The girls eventually ""discover"" that true romance is the answer, and the story supports that silly myth by miraculously making two of the three dysfunctional girls become orgasmic when they finally find a partner they feel true love for. This is an old fairy tale dressed up in modern teen-speak.

The film is well-done, photography excellent, and the leading lady is a beauty and not a bad actor either. Ryan Reynolds is disappointing in his role as the moody hero who saves the damsel in sexual distress, in contrast to a slightly more recent romantic comedy ""Buying the Cow,"" where his supporting performance virtually stole the show. Unlike ""Coming Soon,"" the more recent film is a masterpiece combining slapstick comedy and profound insight, but it's primarily about love rather than sex.

""Coming Soon"" draws needed attention to the widespread problem of female sexual dysfunction, so it's worth seeing for that reason alone. But the story merely perpetuates romantic myths rather than exploring the real causes of female sexual dysfunction or offering any solution. If you're interested in that important issue search the web for the keywords: clitoral erectile dysfunction.",1381449600,,1484,5.12396694214876
196610,1,1578482909,"This must be one of the most stupid movies ever made. A total waste of time and money. Lame story, poor acting, terrible dialog . . . I don't understand why someone like Mia Farrow would agree to be in such a piece of cinematic crap!",1342396800,,233,4.086956521739131
196611,4,1578482909,"Not as bad as some reviews would have it.  Granted, we're not talking top end cerebral work here, but it's an entertaining ride.  Ryan Reynolds shines as always.",1227052800,,161,4.714285714285714
196612,1,1578482909,"What an utter waste of time.  Stupid women looking for nothing more than an orgasm. Wait, did I say women?  Teenage girls playing as adults with adult parents acting like ignorant adolescents.  No explicit sex?  Are you kidding me?  I didn't find a single joke or scene funny in this ridiculous excuse for a movie.  The plot line and scenes just didn't make for characters that anyone should care for.",1207008000,7,401,4.6571428571428575

7799247,3,1578482909,"I don't really know what to say without coming across offensive and gross about a comedy movie that focuses entirely on a teenage girl desperately wanting to be pleased sexually the right way but that's basically the whole story.

Bonnie Root is sick of not fitting in with the other girls (her spoiled snobby friends Gaby Hoffman and Tricia Vessey) who claim they're able to climax with ease.  It's not like Bonnie has trouble getting a boyfriend.  It's that she's unable to feel... satisfied.  MAN this stuff is hard to write without wanting to go overboard!  None of these girls are likeable but they're not supposed to be- these girls are supposed to be miss perfect's who think they're without faults.

Perhaps the best character is Bonnie's mother (Mia Farrow's character).  She tries to be the good mother that raises her daughter properly, but gets a few surprises when she sneaks into Bonnie's dresser drawer and discovers things that a mother needs to address!  Well actually she didn't need to address these private things and I'm not sure a mother would really discuss such matters with their teenage daughter and would probably prefer to keep it hush hush, but then again what do I know!  I'm not a daughter nor do I have one, so I'd never find myself in this predicament.

I didn't even realize that was Ryan Reynolds with bushy hair playing the nice boyfriend!  And Ashton Kutcher is severely limited in his role to only a few moments later on.  That's a surprise there since he's usually the center of attention.  There's not much more that can be said about a movie that has such a trivial story from beginning to end (I'm not kidding either- the whole time!) but if you like over the top teenage comedies this one is okay though sort of uncomfortable to watch if you're a guy.  That whole bathtub scene... where Bonnie figures out that... nevermind.  Uncomfortable viewing for the guys!",1465948800,,1904,4.7272727272727275
7799248,4,1578482909,"one of the better teen movies that I've seen with quality portrayals of genuine human interests.  Devoid of the presumptive homosexual regimentation prevalent among ""educational"" institutions while honoring individual choices.  Healthier characters than anyone in the goofermint run ""schools"" I was compelled to attend when I was that age, but perhaps that was indicated by the Prep School situs.  May not have gone as far as ""The Harrad Experiment"" nor ""Brave New World"" but a very nice realistic movie.",1465689600,,504,5.3544303797468356
