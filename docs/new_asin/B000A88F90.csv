8076301,3,B000A88F90,"This is a well made video from a production standpoint but it spends most of its time rehashing basic ww2 wartime history and provides scant info on Germany's weapons research, plus it has lots of not at all factual editorializing on Germany being a very bad dog naughty Germany and those camps blah blah blah. A waste of time and money if you already know the basics about ww2 and the V1 and V2 German missles, but were looking for more detail on the technological achievements of ww2 Germany.",1350691200,2,494,4.561797752808989
8076302,4,B000A88F90,I like WWII movies and the rockets and V weapons - Hitler was mad and this movie shows that the Nazis could have won with their technology - Thank goodness that Hitler thru a way the war and the Allies won! It was this technology that sparked our US Space program.,1258848000,,264,4.196078431372549
8076303,3,B000A88F90,"This DVD is 53 minutes long, and probably 10-12 minutes actually talking about the V1 and V2 rockets.  Mostly filler footage, which is OK, but I as expecting more about the ""Secret Weapons"".  For the price you get what you pay for.",1213920000,2,231,4.476190476190476
8076304,4,B000A88F90,"Another good account from the War Zone. I felt that there was not anything done about the Jetplane and Tiger Tanks.

A very excellent story of the Long-Range-Rocket that would have been sent to New York or Washington if Hitler had not lost the war.

If Hitler used these weapons againist military targets instead of civilians he might have had a fighting chance to win the war.

Thank God for Hitlers sick ego and his revenge for London that he did not use them properly.

A good account of V-1 and V-2 weapons from eagle media.",1142380800,11,528,4.46875
