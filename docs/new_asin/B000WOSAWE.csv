2988744,4,B000WOSAWE,"I really like this dvd for 1 big reason: Variety!  I don't have to do the same workout or see the same trainer day in and day out - that really beats my biggest problem - boredom.

All of the trainers are fun and most of the workouts have one person (there are 4 in the background) doing a lower impact version of the moves.  Some of the choreography can be tricky and take a few times through to pick up - but that is part of the challenge.

This is my new favorite cardio dvd and I use it 2 times a week.",1211155200,,506,3.8365384615384617

I also felt that the workouts were more on the low impact side, and I didn't get that great of a workout from them.  With most of them, I barely break a sweat.  Also, some of the workouts spend too much time teaching the routines and then breaking in between - which amounts to too much down time for me.

I might use this for a light workout or for days when I don't really feel like exercising, but it certainly won't be a regular for me.",1201478400,14,706,4.124087591240876

The advertising is brief but present... and I'm willing to deal with it if it means they can pack THIS many workouts on one DVD. My favorite workouts were from Kendell, Violet, and Kimberly for differing reasons. Violet will leave your legs screaming but in a good way, Kendells is just fun, and Kimberly because she's just enjoyable to work with.",1199923200,12,610,4.554545454545455

2988753,5,B000WOSAWE,"These five workouts are really great.  They are full of energy, and the instructors are all knowledgeable and friendly.  They cue well and get you motivated.  After advertising their prefered brand of water (Propell), they go straight into it.  One of the five exercisers usually has a calorie burner moniter on, and at the end of the workout, you find out how much they burned during the workout and you'll know you roughly got the same.  The music is great and the set is nice and hip.
Each of the five workouts are approximately 25 minutes in cardio (then there is a warmup and cool down).  There is kickboxing, dancy combos, grapevines, shuffles and mixes of low and high impact to name a few.  I love how you can mix the workouts up so you'll never get bored, and while some are a little tricky to follow, it's fun trying to get there and improve on your last try.
You don't need any equipment for these routines and they really are so much fun.  You have to give them a go.  You'll love it, have fun and burn heaps of calories (especially if you put quite a few of these segments together).",1199491200,24,1096,4.3861386138613865
2988754,5,B000WOSAWE,I been workingout with kendall hogan and the rest of the trainers since i was 20 they always gave me good results everytime!,1367539200,,124,4.434782608695652
2988755,5,B000WOSAWE,I like having the five different workouts by five different trainers so I can mix them up depending on what I feel like doing. I also mix them up with the Star Trainers Abs & Strength training videos. Good bang for your buck.,1362096000,,225,4.255813953488372
2988756,2,B000WOSAWE,"It's true, these workouts, thought brief (30 min + cool down), really get your heart pumping. Time passes quickly with the fun & complex choreography...when I can follow it. Unfortunately,  there is far too little cuing, particularly for the complexity. I had to repeatedly stop & skip entire moves while I figured out what I was supposed to be doing. Even rewinding the DVD didn't help. Also, there is very little instruction regarding technique, even when a new move is introduced. Nothing about which muscles to contract, nothing about posture, nothing about safety.  (Gay Gaspar's has the worst ratio of complexity to instruction/cuing) Overall, I felt like these ""star trainers"" did a good job of showing off (their own fitness level & their abilities to choreograph) but they did little to demonstrate their teaching skills.

My second problem is with the chapter set up. One can skip ahead in 5 minute intervals & it's easy to skip the cool-downs if you want to do more than one workout. Unfortunately, at the beginning of each new workout you either have to watch a silly montage of all the trainers getting photographed & listen to the instructor's intro (including sales pitches) or start each workout 4-5 minutes into the first routine.

My last complaint, is the selling. If this were a free video on Hulu, I would think it a fair trade-off to have listen to the instructors selling product (their own or a sports or whatever). Ads put at the end of a DVD, so that one may choose to watch or not, are also a-okay with me. However, If I've paid for the DVD, then I find it extremely inappropriate to be forced to listen to sales pitches.

I plan to keep this DVD for those moments when I need a break from my favorite workouts. But there's a good chance I'll never do it again. Certainly, I'll never buy another ""Star Trainers"" workout. Also, I'll be very cautious about buying workouts from any of the trainers on this video.",1360800000,,1937,4.685294117647059
2988757,4,B000WOSAWE,"One of my permanent staples. 5 varied workouts to 5 different instructors with different styles, focus and movements. If you are easily bored, this is a great DVD to have. For the price, you get almost 3 hrs of workouts that will get your heart rate going.

Here they are rated in order, from hardest to easiest, from an aerobic perspective:

1. Kendall Hogan
2. Violet Zaki
3. Gay Gaspar
4. Kimberly Spreen
5. Rob Glick",1355443200,,420,4.5131578947368425
2988758,5,B000WOSAWE,"Honestly, apart from the Kendell Hogan and Kimberly Spreen workouts, I wouldn't have rated this DVD workout so highly. Kendell and Kimberly make this DVD worthwhile. Their workouts are fun and easy to follow. Their personalities are warm and motivating. They make you want to burn some calories. I wasn't too keen on the other 3 workouts, but give them a try too. You might as well, seeing that you paid for it, right? ;-)",1353974400,,422,4.64
2988759,5,B000WOSAWE,"I purchased this dvd over a year ago, and I still come back to it often.  I became familiar with 3 of the trainers, Kendall, Rob, and Kimberly through Excercisetv on Demand and I wanted to be able to train with them (and others) on a regular basis.  Was I pleased when I found this dvd!
I am a former aerobics teacher.  I taught throughout the 80's and 90's and finally stopped in 2007.  So, most of these routines are very similiar to what I used to do for the cardio portion of some of the classes I taught.
I love the variety; Rob's is a bit ""dancey"", which personally I love. Violet's has a martial arts base.  The other three have that athletic base (jumping jacks, squats), that many instructors used in the 80's and 90's.
I believe that each of the instructors breaks the routine down enough so that the choreography is not difficult to follow, but yet does not become boring either. And, each one of them has great timing and uses good music. In my opinion, each is a good motivator - not annoyingly sweet or aggressive in tone of voice.
If you are looking for a ""heart-blasting"" routine, none of these fit that need.  But, if you are just looking for a good, basic, enjoyable 20 minute cardio routine to add to your strength and core programs on certain days, I don't think you can go wrong with this dvd.",1350950400,,1314,4.3428571428571425
2988760,2,B000WOSAWE,"I remember this video from exercise tv. The reason why I ordered it is the workout from violet zaki, which is excellent of course. Unfornately I had to purchase the whole tape just to get to her. The rest of the trainers were terrible. Did they actually think they were working someone out? Violet's was the hardest. All of the others were very easy and unchallenging. Now if you are a beginner, then this workout is for you; but if you are intermediate to advanced, then skip this tape.",1350172800,,487,4.48314606741573

2988762,5,B000WOSAWE,"I love this 3-set video pack:  cardio, strength, abs. 5 different trainers, 5 different workouts in each category. For someone who gets bored easily, these workouts are perfect!

2988763,4,B000WOSAWE,"Star Cardio is a very good DVD that I use alot -

2988764,5,B000WOSAWE,I have this DVD but only use Kendell Hogan's workout.  The others were too complicated to follow.  Kendell's workout is easy to follow and has a good mix of upbeat cardio and strengthening exercises.  My butt is rounder because of the squats and my legs feel stronger because of the lunges.

2988765,5,B000WOSAWE,"These workouts are fun and very effective.  I am having a little trouble with the dvd, however, just haven't gotten around to informing Amazon.  They are very responsive when approached on problems, however.  Overall a good workout.",1294531200,,232,5.216216216216216
2988766,5,B000WOSAWE,"I ordered this because I wanted more strictly cardio workouts in my collection. You can't beat getting five 30 minute workouts on 1 DVD.  I actually have fun with Kendell and I really enjoy Kimberley and Violet.  Rob and Gay are too dancey and quick stepping for me, but thats just not my taste. This DVD has enough variety for almost everyone.",1291161600,,344,4.532258064516129
2988767,5,B000WOSAWE,"It's fun, because it's like, excersize wanna be dance. It gets you thinking about the dance and not the workout, but I have to do the excersizes over and over to actually GET What they are doing first. I think it's kind of silly how they just expect us to know everything. There are just non stop crazy moves out of no where. added into what they are teaching...They don't teach they just do it and some of the stuff doesn't make sense to me until I practice it a couple times. And I usually catch on to dance moves fast! I dk maybe I'm just slow on this particular video. So sometimes I like it because of the challenge, but today working out with it I was just like. AGAGGGHH. What the heck is this? It's fun though.",1285200000,,718,4.172661870503597
2988768,5,B000WOSAWE,This dvd has a lot of variety.  this workout is for intermediate or advanced exercisers. There is no cuing so it is a little hard to follow for people who are starting to exercise.  This workout is good for people who don't have a lot of time but still want a good workout.,1273363200,,273,4.132075471698113
2988769,5,B000WOSAWE,"Having bought the other two DVDs in this series and being extremely pleased with them, I ordered this video expecting a lot.  It has lived up to my high expectations, and although I don't love all five workouts, they are all different and good enough to give this DVD 5 stars.  These are the five workouts on the DVD.

Cardio Party w/ Rob Glick-This section is kind of a dancey, aerobic routine.  What Rob does is he teaches you three different little dance routines that consist of mambos, V-steps, and more.  At the end, he puts all three routines together for a really fun and slightly challenging routine.  Although it isn't extremely challenging cardio wise, it is a little hard to remember some of Rob's choreography in the third routine because at the last minute he mixes it up.

Cardio Kick-Butt w/ Violet Zaki-This is kind of a kickbox inspired workout.  It has fighting moves that are a lot of fun and that aren't in most kickbox workouts.  Yes, you could say that there are only two actual kicks taught (front and back), but there is a lot of other fun stuff such as karate chops, football runs, and elbow jabs.  Another thing that Violet does a lot of is squats.  At the end of this workout, my thighs were already sore from the squats.  However, it never got boring.  This is just a fun, kickbox-style, high-cardio routine with a lot of squats mixed in.

Cardio Expresso w/ Gay Gasper-This section consists of about three routines that are made up of cardio moves such as grapevines,knee repeaters, and step touches.  This was kind of like Rob's routine only it was easier to follow and not as dancey.  It does contain a few dance moves, howover, making it a good medium.  This section is very cardio, and some exercisers will like it because of its mostly basic moves.

Power Within w/ Kimberly Spreen-I was very disappointed with this section as it was interval training instead of constant cardio.  However, I loved Kimberly.  She was so genuine and sweet that she made the section fun.  It consists of about 1/3 toning that does not require weights.  It is mostly squats and lunges.  Then the rest is high cardio bursts that don't last too long, but are extremely high cardio.  Some examples would be skaters and leaps.  Although, I wasn't too pleased with this style, Kimberly made me enjoy this workout.

Peak Performance w/ Kendell Hogan-This section was more of a straight forward, sports-style routine.  The moves are such as shooting a basketball and knee lifts with a hop.  This was my favorite section, and Kendell was a very good trainer, as he always is.  This section is one routine that Kendell is constantly adding onto.  It is a lot of fun, and it is high cardio.

All workouts contain a short warm-up and cool down that are really nice.  They also all contain water breaks at about the 20 minute point.  Some people complained about this, as it does interrupt the workout, but I just fast-forward through them.  Altogether this is a great DVD with 5 workouts of various cardio styles.  It is a great DVD that I recommend to all.",1266364800,8,3061,4.61595547309833

2988771,1,B000WOSAWE,"I thought this DVD would be such a bargain with 5 different workouts.  I was disappointed with all of these workouts.  The first workout started fine then he got really complex. Why do they feel it's necessary to make thins so hard and frustrating, it's a total turnoff. The rest of workouts were not challenging at all. I was very disappointed in this.  I might give it another try only because I don't want it to be a waste of money.",1235088000,2,435,4.345679012345679

2988773,3,B000WOSAWE,"I actually bought this DVD because I really enjoyed Violet Zaki's segment when it was on Comcast OnDemand. I figured since her segment was so good, the others on this DVD would be good as well. Not quite.

Pros: I enjoyed Violet Zaki, Kimberly Spreen, and Kendell Hogan's work outs. I suppose 3/5 isn't too bad, especially considering the price! It certainly raised my heart rate, I had fun, and after 2 weeks, I lost about 3 lbs. Not bad! I did all 5 workouts (on seperate days) and according to my heart rate watch, burned 220 calories for each workout...NOT the 350+ calories they say they burned after the workout is over. Nonetheless, I was happy with the results!

Indifferent: Many people have complained about the Propel Fitness water hype throughout this DVD. Honestly, I don't care. They obviously helped keep the price of this DVD low. Plus, I enjoyed having the water break 20 minutes into the workout. I don't like having to pause the workout, take a drink, and then unpause. It's nice to have that break built in.

Cons: I HATED Rob Glick's workout. He'd show one simple move, like step touch, then add 10 more moves on in the blink of an eye, and say, ""Are you ready?"" and then modify the whole thing a minute later. It was ridiculous! 4/5 workouts contain mambo-cha-cha moves. I'm sorry, but mambo cha-chas are NOT cardio. I find it boring and confusing, especially when the instructor wants you to do it all directions, including ones where you're not facing the TV.

All in all - 3/5 stars, one star for each workout I thought was worthy.",1212796800,5,1556,4.586330935251799

One of the five exercisers usually has a calorie burner moniter on, and at the end of the workout, you find out how much they burned during the workout and you'll know you roughly got the same.  The music is great and the set is nice and hip.
Each of the five workouts are approximately 25 minutes in cardio (then there is a warmup and cool down).  There is kickboxing, dancy combos, grapevines, shuffles and mixes of low and high impact to name a few.  I love how you can mix the workouts up so you'll never get bored, and while some are a little tricky to follow, it's fun trying to get there and improve on your last try.
You don't need any equipment for these routines and they really are so much fun.  You have to give them a go.  You'll love it, have fun and burn heaps of calories (especially if you put quite a few of these segments together).",1199491200,24,1096,4.3861386138613865
3223251,5,B000WOSAWE,I been workingout with kendall hogan and the rest of the trainers since i was 20 they always gave me good results everytime!,1367539200,,124,4.434782608695652
3223252,5,B000WOSAWE,I like having the five different workouts by five different trainers so I can mix them up depending on what I feel like doing. I also mix them up with the Star Trainers Abs & Strength training videos. Good bang for your buck.,1362096000,,225,4.255813953488372
3223253,2,B000WOSAWE,"It's true, these workouts, thought brief (30 min + cool down), really get your heart pumping. Time passes quickly with the fun & complex choreography...when I can follow it. Unfortunately,  there is far too little cuing, particularly for the complexity. I had to repeatedly stop & skip entire moves while I figured out what I was supposed to be doing. Even rewinding the DVD didn't help. Also, there is very little instruction regarding technique, even when a new move is introduced. Nothing about which muscles to contract, nothing about posture, nothing about safety.  (Gay Gaspar's has the worst ratio of complexity to instruction/cuing) Overall, I felt like these ""star trainers"" did a good job of showing off (their own fitness level & their abilities to choreograph) but they did little to demonstrate their teaching skills.

My second problem is with the chapter set up. One can skip ahead in 5 minute intervals & it's easy to skip the cool-downs if you want to do more than one workout. Unfortunately, at the beginning of each new workout you either have to watch a silly montage of all the trainers getting photographed & listen to the instructor's intro (including sales pitches) or start each workout 4-5 minutes into the first routine.

My last complaint, is the selling. If this were a free video on Hulu, I would think it a fair trade-off to have listen to the instructors selling product (their own or a sports or whatever). Ads put at the end of a DVD, so that one may choose to watch or not, are also a-okay with me. However, If I've paid for the DVD, then I find it extremely inappropriate to be forced to listen to sales pitches.

I plan to keep this DVD for those moments when I need a break from my favorite workouts. But there's a good chance I'll never do it again. Certainly, I'll never buy another ""Star Trainers"" workout. Also, I'll be very cautious about buying workouts from any of the trainers on this video.",1360800000,,1937,4.685294117647059
3223254,4,B000WOSAWE,"One of my permanent staples. 5 varied workouts to 5 different instructors with different styles, focus and movements. If you are easily bored, this is a great DVD to have. For the price, you get almost 3 hrs of workouts that will get your heart rate going.

1. Kendall Hogan
2. Violet Zaki
3. Gay Gaspar
4. Kimberly Spreen
5. Rob Glick",1355443200,,420,4.5131578947368425
3223255,5,B000WOSAWE,"Honestly, apart from the Kendell Hogan and Kimberly Spreen workouts, I wouldn't have rated this DVD workout so highly. Kendell and Kimberly make this DVD worthwhile. Their workouts are fun and easy to follow. Their personalities are warm and motivating. They make you want to burn some calories. I wasn't too keen on the other 3 workouts, but give them a try too. You might as well, seeing that you paid for it, right? ;-)",1353974400,,422,4.64
3223256,5,B000WOSAWE,"I purchased this dvd over a year ago, and I still come back to it often.  I became familiar with 3 of the trainers, Kendall, Rob, and Kimberly through Excercisetv on Demand and I wanted to be able to train with them (and others) on a regular basis.  Was I pleased when I found this dvd!
I am a former aerobics teacher.  I taught throughout the 80's and 90's and finally stopped in 2007.  So, most of these routines are very similiar to what I used to do for the cardio portion of some of the classes I taught.
I love the variety; Rob's is a bit ""dancey"", which personally I love. Violet's has a martial arts base.  The other three have that athletic base (jumping jacks, squats), that many instructors used in the 80's and 90's.
I believe that each of the instructors breaks the routine down enough so that the choreography is not difficult to follow, but yet does not become boring either. And, each one of them has great timing and uses good music. In my opinion, each is a good motivator - not annoyingly sweet or aggressive in tone of voice.
If you are looking for a ""heart-blasting"" routine, none of these fit that need.  But, if you are just looking for a good, basic, enjoyable 20 minute cardio routine to add to your strength and core programs on certain days, I don't think you can go wrong with this dvd.",1350950400,,1314,4.3428571428571425
3223257,2,B000WOSAWE,"I remember this video from exercise tv. The reason why I ordered it is the workout from violet zaki, which is excellent of course. Unfornately I had to purchase the whole tape just to get to her. The rest of the trainers were terrible. Did they actually think they were working someone out? Violet's was the hardest. All of the others were very easy and unchallenging. Now if you are a beginner, then this workout is for you; but if you are intermediate to advanced, then skip this tape.",1350172800,,487,4.48314606741573

There are just non stop crazy moves out of no where. added into what they are teaching...They don't teach they just do it and some of the stuff doesn't make sense to me until I practice it a couple times.

3223266,5,B000WOSAWE,"Having bought the other two DVDs in this series and being extremely pleased with them, I ordered this video expecting a lot.  It has lived up to my high expectations, and although I don't love all five workouts, they are all different and good enough to give this DVD 5 stars.  These are the five workouts on the DVD.

Cardio Party w/ Rob Glick-This section is kind of a dancey, aerobic routine.  What Rob does is he teaches you three different little dance routines that consist of mambos, V-steps, and more.  At the end, he puts all three routines together for a really fun and slightly challenging routine.  Although it isn't extremely challenging cardio wise, it is a little hard to remember some of Rob's choreography in the third routine because at the last minute he mixes it up.

Cardio Kick-Butt w/ Violet Zaki-This is kind of a kickbox inspired workout.  It has fighting moves that are a lot of fun and that aren't in most kickbox workouts.  Yes, you could say that there are only two actual kicks taught (front and back), but there is a lot of other fun stuff such as karate chops, football runs, and elbow jabs.  Another thing that Violet does a lot of is squats.  At the end of this workout, my thighs were already sore from the squats.  However, it never got boring.  This is just a fun, kickbox-style, high-cardio routine with a lot of squats mixed in.

Cardio Expresso w/ Gay Gasper-This section consists of about three routines that are made up of cardio moves such as grapevines,knee repeaters, and step touches.  This was kind of like Rob's routine only it was easier to follow and not as dancey.  It does contain a few dance moves, howover, making it a good medium.  This section is very cardio, and some exercisers will like it because of its mostly basic moves.

Power Within w/ Kimberly Spreen-I was very disappointed with this section as it was interval training instead of constant cardio.  However, I loved Kimberly.  She was so genuine and sweet that she made the section fun.  It consists of about 1/3 toning that does not require weights.  It is mostly squats and lunges.  Then the rest is high cardio bursts that don't last too long, but are extremely high cardio.  Some examples would be skaters and leaps.  Although, I wasn't too pleased with this style, Kimberly made me enjoy this workout.

Peak Performance w/ Kendell Hogan-This section was more of a straight forward, sports-style routine.  The moves are such as shooting a basketball and knee lifts with a hop.  This was my favorite section, and Kendell was a very good trainer, as he always is.  This section is one routine that Kendell is constantly adding onto.  It is a lot of fun, and it is high cardio.

All workouts contain a short warm-up and cool down that are really nice.  They also all contain water breaks at about the 20 minute point.  Some people complained about this, as it does interrupt the workout, but I just fast-forward through them.  Altogether this is a great DVD with 5 workouts of various cardio styles.  It is a great DVD that I recommend to all.",1266364800,8,3061,4.61595547309833

3223268,1,B000WOSAWE,"I thought this DVD would be such a bargain with 5 different workouts.  I was disappointed with all of these workouts.  The first workout started fine then he got really complex. Why do they feel it's necessary to make thins so hard and frustrating, it's a total turnoff. The rest of workouts were not challenging at all. I was very disappointed in this.  I might give it another try only because I don't want it to be a waste of money.",1235088000,2,435,4.345679012345679

3223270,3,B000WOSAWE,"I actually bought this DVD because I really enjoyed Violet Zaki's segment when it was on Comcast OnDemand. I figured since her segment was so good, the others on this DVD would be good as well. Not quite.

Pros: I enjoyed Violet Zaki, Kimberly Spreen, and Kendell Hogan's work outs. I suppose 3/5 isn't too bad, especially considering the price! It certainly raised my heart rate, I had fun, and after 2 weeks, I lost about 3 lbs. Not bad! I did all 5 workouts (on seperate days) and according to my heart rate watch, burned 220 calories for each workout...NOT the 350+ calories they say they burned after the workout is over. Nonetheless, I was happy with the results!

Indifferent: Many people have complained about the Propel Fitness water hype throughout this DVD. Honestly, I don't care. They obviously helped keep the price of this DVD low. Plus, I enjoyed having the water break 20 minutes into the workout. I don't like having to pause the workout, take a drink, and then unpause. It's nice to have that break built in.

Cons: I HATED Rob Glick's workout. He'd show one simple move, like step touch, then add 10 more moves on in the blink of an eye, and say, ""Are you ready?"" and then modify the whole thing a minute later. It was ridiculous! 4/5 workouts contain mambo-cha-cha moves. I'm sorry, but mambo cha-chas are NOT cardio. I find it boring and confusing, especially when the instructor wants you to do it all directions, including ones where you're not facing the TV.

All in all - 3/5 stars, one star for each workout I thought was worthy.",1212796800,5,1556,4.586330935251799

I was hoping this would be similar.  Based on that I was very disappointed.  Over all each of these workouts have good elements, especially Kimberly's because she cues better than the rest of them, but I'm still on the hunt for the power fusion with the bar.  It is by far the best workout next to Victoria Johnsons workout series if you are looking for low impact high energy cardio.",1461628800,,529,4.357142857142857

8224594,3,B000WOSAWE,"I have exercised to two of the segments on this DVDs.  On one, the exercising does not keep tempo with the music and I find it very distracting.",1448755200,,144,4.142857142857143
8224595,3,B000WOSAWE,"Im going to preface this by saying that I have been exercising with mostly videos for almost 20 years, There was a time when I would have considered myself low advanced, thyroid problems derailed my exercise train but now on proper medication Ive been working my way through all I own and decluttering along the way. So after 18 months or more of little to no exercise, I made myself a challenge to workout daily, Im probably an intermediate now, maybe a low intermediate at that.
I did this workout over 5 days time each in it's own day, so I will review each of the workouts separately below:
Cardio Party - Rob Glick leads this one and for me the choreography was a bit too complicated for 5:00 AM. He slowly builds a pattern, repeats it on the opposite side, then builds a new pattern, once three segments have been built and gone through, he strings them all together. Then the obligatory propel water break, followed by a fourth segment built slowly like the others. There is a modifier and someone wearing a calorie counter. The impact varies, but the modifier is there to help you if necessary. For me this wasn't my favorite.
Cardio Espresso  Gay Gasper leads this one and for me it was easy to follow (unlike above). She follows the same process of building a pattern, repeating the opposite side and moving on to a new pattern before stringing three together and a propel water break. There is a modifier and a calorie burn monitor. Again there was some impact, but the modifier kept things low and was easy to spot when needed. I thought it was pretty fun.
Cardio Kick Butt  Violet Zaki leads this one, and is not my favorite. I generally love a good kickboxing workout, and Ive tried them with Violet before and I just don't click with her at all. I also felt a bit hornswoggled on this as this is billed as a cardio DVD, but there were seemingly endless squats and lunges in this. There was not a single punch thrown and very few kicks. At one point she says stop smiling. I think shes joking, but all the same, it rubbed me the wrong way. She follows the previous instructors pattern of building a pattern, repeating on both sides and moving on to the next pattern before stringing three together and then the propel water break. Modifier and calorie counter are front and center.
Peak Performance Cardio  Kendall Hogan lead this one and hes a joy. Energetic and upbeat without being too over the top. He also had the best music on the DVD, which is to say that I noticed the music and how well paired it was with the movements. I don't usually notice music at all, so this was something. This one was a little heavy on the squats and lunges as well, but unlike the Violet Zaki workout they had a more cardio feel to them if that makes sense. Same pattern of building each segment to the propel water break, modifier and calorie counter were there as well.
Last but not least Power Within  Kimberly Spreen leads this one and while I like her generally, I don't seem to click with any of her workouts and this one was no exception. Again a lot of squats and lunges here, but this one was built almost like a circuit with cardio intervals of higher intensity (not sure I would go so far as to say HiiT) built in between the squat and lunge combos. It didn't follow the same template that all the others followed as far as building patterns, but they made sure to get their propel break. At this point I feel as though this ought to have been free with a case of propel. The modifier in this one didn't modify much but the calorie counter was right on target.
Over all this one felt a bit like an ExerciseTV commercial wrapped around a bottle of Propel. The set was bright but had huge pictures of the Star Trainers blown up in the background and the intro to each workout seemed to go on a touch too long. I really liked some of the trainers, but didn't connect with their workouts.",1425340800,,3895,4.398058252427185
8224596,1,B000WOSAWE,"I hate this video,  I usually like the trainers on this video but this is just horrible",1420934400,,87,4.117647058823529
8224597,5,B000WOSAWE,I bought this because of some of the instructors on this - definitely would recommend purchasing this or the other two in the series!,1401840000,,133,4.583333333333333
8224598,4,B000WOSAWE,"Again, I bought this so I could get Kendall Hogan, who used to be an instructor on Exercise TV.  This is a decent DVD, some of the workouts are harder than others, just as some of the instructors are better at cueing than others.  All are around 30 min. so it's a decent amount of time and I don't need to add another workout to get a good calorie burn (I wear a HRM).  I never, ever burn the amount of calories the person on the DVD that is wearing a HRM gets and I usually keep up with them doing the advanced moves.  Most of the instructors use pretty basic moves that are easy to follow, Rob Glick is the most complicated and way too dancy for me and I wasn't crazy about his cueing.  Violet Zaki's workout is based on karate, which was new to me and I much prefer kick boxing but it was fun to do something different.  Most of them have either no or a very short warmup and cooldown, which is a problem for me so I usually add a good stretch when I'm finished.  There is the usual Propel water blurb at the front and a Propel water break about halfway through, both of which are totally useless but they can be worked around.

All told this is a keeper and a great addition to my workout library.",1367971200,,1201,4.080851063829787
