1053820,4,6305645493,"And it really did pay off. I thoroughly enjoyed this sci-fi/techno-thriller/horror romp...YES! A ROMP!
Norrington wrote a great script and the action sequences are tight. He also gets great performances from his actors. Dourif, of course, is fantastic as the mad scientist with a love-lorn crush on his boss that leans to the murderous side...
What seperates DEATH MACHINE from the majority of B-movie straight-to-video fare goes way beyond great special effects and lots of action and gore.  The characters are actually ENGAGING.  Usually, with low-budget horror, I'm HOPING most of the characters are done away with, but not with DEATH MACHINE.  I liked these characters. I didn't want them to die.  Of course, this heightens the overall tension of the film and makes it a great viewing experience.
Dourif might be a scene-stealer, but this is Norrington's film all of the way.  He wrote a fantastic script. His direction was on the mark. And he got the most out of his cast.
DEATH MACHINE is definitely worth the 9.99. Without a doubt.",996624000,9,1038,4.976878612716763

I am very happy I took a chance! I had no expectations whatsoever, just hoped that it wouldn't be a waste of time and money and it surely wasn't. Nice effects, though changing in quality they where generally above average. Some nice twists and turns in the story. A couple of well-known faces (look out for Rachel Weisz' 30 second appearance early in the movie). And above all, the humor. The humor is somewhat black and crude in this movie and that suited me (and the movie) just fine.

1053949,4,6305645493,"Death Machine was one of my favorite horror films to watch on television while growing up, although I admit that I never knew the name of the movie until I finally saw this film recently, and with pleasant results reminiscent of my younger days spent enjoying this flick. With a no-brainer plot, cheezy-as-hell execution, and a sweet pair of man/machine antagonists, Death Machine is a fun watch sure to please those who know what they are getting into, especially if alcohol and/or friends are involved.

Military contractor Chaank Armaments has been experimenting on creating the perfect soldier of the future, combining man and machine in a failed and deadly project. When the creator of the failed weapons, Jack Dante(Brad Dourif), is fired by newly-appointed CEO Hayden Cale(Ely Pouget) due to his recklessness, he unleashes his most powerful beast to date, a savage and indestructible machine whos sole purpose is to kill all who cross its path.

If you could not tell from the films title alone, this is one hell of a cheesy watch. The storyline is as simple as they get, and while this is a turn-off-your-brain-and-enjoy flick I still found it to contain some very cool ideas that sold this to me as a legitimate horror film. I enjoyed the idea of Hayden Cale being brought in to Chaank Armaments to run damage control over the failed man/machine project, titled The Hardman Project, and soon finding herself not only in a mix of lies and conspiracy, but face-to-face with a supreme beast of technology and revenge. Jack Dante, whose name is an obvious shout-out to Joe Dante, was a unique character who stood out among the other more serious characters, coming off as the one psychotic sissy who feels that no one appreciates him despite his great work, which he deems art. My only complaint regarding this enjoyable character was that there were long bouts between his usage, which I somewhat understand and am forgiving towards given we are given good and entertaining action during those long sequences, but nonetheless we are given the feeling that he is an important character, a star of the film, yet his screen-time is fairly low compared to everyone else. The dialogue between our characters is nothing notable, unless you are looking for some good cheese, which in that case the dialogue is sure to leave you laughing out loud at times as it did with me. I will not go as far as to say that this is a so bad its good horror film, because it really is not bad, it is just filmed in the vein of the 70s and 80s horror flicks. Thankfully, we get a good amount of action written into this piece, and its single location provides us with a nowhere-to-run scenario that forces our protagonists to run, hide, and eventually take up arms and fight back against the machine, providing non-stop entertainment via this well-paced story.

Writer Stephen Norrington also serves as the films director, and I applaud him for his fun execution and great direction of the films most important elements. Sure the acting could have been better from everyone except the fantastic Brad Dourif (Childs Play series)(in a role perfect for his persona), and the editing was off on numerous occasions, but thanks to good direction the action was good, the tension was high, and I was given an experience that I will never forget, and that is what matters most to me in the horror genre. Fans of creature features will enjoy the look and usage of Warbeast, who may not be a creature as far as organics go, but nonetheless he gives us everything a diabolical creature would, and with a unique twist given his mechanics. Even more awesome and quite surprising was that we were given some great live-action FX regarding Warbeast, and even the CGI FX were fantastic (for its time), and so well done that at times I was not able to tell the difference between live-action and CGI FX. This is definitely due to Norringtons FX background, which includes Aliens and Alien 3, which made him a good candidate for his next directorial effort, Blade, which sadly did not come with great CGI. We also get some good gore here and there, although this experience did not rely much on good kills, but more the awesome antagonist that is Warbeast, but I did not mind that one bit.

Overall, Death Machine is an awesome horror experience that gives us a fantastic killer, lots of action, and plenty of cheeze to go around. The FX are great, and Stephen Norrington does a great job executing this debut effort of his to make for one of the most unique creature features I have seen, and one that I will never forget.

I didn't see it so. I found Brad Douriff acting to be excessive, a classic example of what not to do with a role. The cinematography was mediocre at best, and the direction left a lot to be desired. It is a story that has been better told elsewhere. It was a cheap (and here I mean cheesy, not inexpensive) ripoff of a combination Robocop, and the Terminator. The only redeeming qualities of the film was the performance of Ely Pouget and the all to brief appearance of Rachel Weisz.

1054073,1,6305645493,"Death Machine (Stephen Norrington, 1994)

The best thing I can say about Death Machine is that it shows Stephen Norrington, whose second feature was Blade, learned a lot from his mistakes. Blade is a fun, fun movie that gets pretty much everything right that Death Machine gets wrong. A confused, muddled mess that came from some really good ideas.

Plot (I think, it's a bit tough to tell): Chaank Armaments, whose iron-fisted founder recently died and left the company to his daughter, Hayden Cale (model and TV character actress Ely Pouget), has been experimenting with things that, shall we say, would violate the Geneva Convention, all top-secret, and all under the aegis of lunatic genius Jack Dante (Heaven's Gate's Brad Dourif). Cale is horrified at the unethical nature of Dante's work, and within ten minutes of metting him, fires him and shuts down his entire wing of the operation...except that at the same time, a band of eco-terrorists named after horror film directors, headed by one Sam Raimi (El Maquinista's John Sharian), spurred on by a recent incident in which one of Dante's failed experiments got loose and trashed a diner (we see this in the opening scene), break into Chaank's headquarters and shut the place down in order to do as much damage as possible... leaving them, Cale, and her right-hand man Carpenter (the late William Hootkins, easily the best thing about this movie) trapped in the building with a very pissed-off Dante and the plaything he kept secret from everyone in the company, which he calls the Warbeast.

There's just enough promise that shows through here for me to be able to hypothesize that at some point in its construction there was a really, really good movie here, but that the ""good movie"" bits got stripped out and left on the cutting-room floor--the character development that would have injected some real teeth into Dante's obsession with Cale (he may be trying to kill her, but he's still trying to get into her pants at the same time) or put some genuine warmth into the banter between Raimi and Yutani, one of the other ecoterrorists. Hell, ANY of Yutani that got left on the cutting-room floor needs to find its way into a director's cut. The same goes for any scenes of Carpenter that disappeared; William Hootkins , who died in 2005, was a fearsome and far too underutilized actor who left his mark on every movie in which he had a part, however small (from Star Wars to Flash Gordon to even The Breed), and this is a movie that gave him a large enough part to exercise his considerable talent. Unfortunately, here it's playing to a mostly empty room. I'd like to see the original cut of this to see if it's really as good as I think it might have been. *",1375747200,,2720,4.7100840336134455
1054121,3,6305645493,"Death machine is a science fiction film that came out in 1994. The movie takes place in 2023 in a cyberpunk type future that Blade Runner paved the way for.

The story follows Hayden Cale, played by Ely Pouget, who is the CEO of Chaank Industries. Chaank Industries is secretly developing a death machine that can track its victims through fear. The creator of the machine is Jack Dante played by Brad Dourif. Hayden finds this out and tries to stop Dante, but he releases the machine to kill her and a group of stragglers. Together, they must destroy the creature and bring the secret to light.

Overall I thought the film was okay, but there are a lot of problems with it. Firstly most of the characters I thought were very bland. The lead girl, Hayden, tries to be the Ripley of this film, but I do not think she pulls it off. I found her to be uninteresting as a character. The same with the other main characters. I was not invested in their characters, so I did not care if they lived or died. The one character I thought was a lot of fun is Brad Dourif's character Dante. He is so over-the-top that I just found him very enjoyable to watch.

The acting is a mixed bag. The main cast did okay, but the supporting cast was horrible. For example, there was this random cop that appeared periodically in the film. The guy that played the cop is a terrible actor. He did not deliver one line naturally. Brad Dourif was the most over-the-top in the film acting wise. However, again he is so goofy that it is hard not to enjoy him. Dourif is easily one of the best aspects about this film.

The effects are meh, in my opinion. The wide shot of the city looked good. The style reminded me a lot of Blade Runner. However, many of the other effects looked off. For example, the effects of the death machine when it is moving are laughable. The design of the machine itself is also very lackluster, in my opinion.  The action scenes, however, I thought were well done and enjoyable.

Many elements of this film remind me of other Sci-Fi films like Blade Runner, Terminator, Alien, etc. In fact the character's names are almost directly taken from names from characters from those very films.  Also one of the characters even spouts a line directly from Terminator.  It is clear that this film was heaviliy influenced by those films.  However, those elements just made me think about how much better those movies are and how those elements are handled better in those films.

Overall this is an okay film, but there are many better Sci-Fi films out there. If you are a fan of Bred Dourif, then I'd say give this a look.",1367452800,,2614,4.427083333333333

  Death machine is an excellent movie for its time, and not to be judged by today's standards.  A Unique story line for its time about a corporation that has a lot of ethical issues in the areas that it promotes and studies.  Perhaps in a historical perspective this area of the movie is harking to the issues of cloning and stem cell research that was so prevalent during the years this movie came out, telling us a story of ethical violations of companies can lead to some serious issues and put many people in danger, and that only psychotic mad men scientist would ever contemplate breaking ethical barriers into unknown and untested science
  Also another cultural hark making the ""Humanist alliance"" the good guys (akin to green environmentalist) being non violent and taking down the establishment for the good of all mankind, whether they know it or not is another complex cultural motif that is from around the years this film was made.
  The movie however on its own premise is about cyborg soldiers, and uber killing machine robot called the ""warbeast"", and a ceo that seems not to know anything about whats going on in her own company, and some human alliance members that are trying to survive warbeast in a 65 story skyscraper.

Stop giggling. It's a super-warbot that goes in fast, is lethal and ruthless, and boogies out like its 1978, daddy-o! Only media scrutiny and dark talk of Congressional inquiries mean that brand new Chaank Vice President Hayden Cale (Ely Pouget) is brought in to bring order to chaos, and take all the fun out of Chaank, probably forcing it to go into online book-selling and sh*t.

Dante isn't having any of it: so in a glorious bow to simplicity, he unleashes the Death Machine and the rest of the show is all sorts of bloody hijinks, as Cale joins forces with a band of anarchists with more style than sense.

And really, let's take a second to make an ode to Style: director Stephen Norrington is all about this glittering, shimmering, steel-and-concrete techno-future, and he turns what could have been an otherwise colorless corporate hive into a shadow-haunted, steam-befogged House of Pain. He would really get his groove on in ""Blade"", but ""Death Machine"" served as a nice launch-pad.

Yeah, true, ""Death Machine"" is pretty much utter sh*t, but it's fun sh*t, especially if well sauced. And that's really the glory of this sick, wanton, drugged-out thing: it's very eighties, all evil corporations and tough no-bullsh*t crusader women and Brad Dourif striking a pose in his long hair and leather trenchcoat and BAD ATTITUDE, baby, and of course, the Death Machine, that shows up snorting and bellowing metallic rage, and has a real thing for tearing up elevators.

It's in Full Screen, cropped, and ugly as h*ll. It's Death Machine! Would you have it any other way?

movies.

Acting is excellent from top to bottom with a lot of original and funny dialogue.

The robo creature is genuinely scary .

The plot actually makes sense with good motivations.

I've watched this many many times.

Highly recommended.",1126051200,5,292,4.857142857142857

1054195,4,6305645493,"When you see a film with the title ""Death Machine,"" you probably won't expect to see cinema at its finest. This movie is one of those low budget schlockers you catch on the Sci-Fi Channel from time to time, sandwiched between low-grade clunkers like ""Convict 762"" and ""Fortress 2: Re-entry."" Why does it seem that bad science fiction films are worse than bad films in other genres? Don't get me wrong; I am not saying ""Death Machine"" is a total loss. I'm not saying it is great, either, but that's beside the point. What I am saying is that over the past year or so, a majority of the bad films I have seen are science fiction films. It isn't a recent phenomenon, either. I considered blaming the arrival of the Sci-Fi Channel--and its voracious appetite for programming--as a primary cause in the increase of bad films, but that isn't exactly the case. Several of these films were not made in the last year or two but in the early 1980s and 1990s. Obviously, atrocious films in this genre stretch back well into the 1950s, at least, so blaming a new cable network for the plethora of technology themed turkeys traipsing across my screen is unfair. Perhaps the reason has something to do with higher audience expectations and the absolute need for special effects. If the effects reek, so go the expectations of the film.
O.K., there's this big, bad corporation in the near future, see, and the jerks who run the place make lots of money developing big and better killing hardware for the military along with anyone else with enough money to deal. The latest project involves suiting up some poor dupe in a huge suit of body armor, wiping his memory and personality with a computer program download into the old noggin, and setting him loose to blow up the baddies. Sure, messing around with some guy's head probably violates a few archaic sensibilities--the Constitution comes to mind--but hey, a buck is a buck. Besides, the near future is an incredibly violent world where anything goes. Why not come up with a pseudo-Terminator like weapon to take out the trash? A few people in the country still seem to care about such prissy ideas as human dignity and rights, so the company brings in a female executive to investigate reports that the company is shamelessly using people as guinea pigs. Also, lest you think the managers are completely altruistic, higher ups at the corporation are also concerned about getting bad press over a few leaks to the media. So this gal roars into a board meeting full of vim and vigor, clad in tight clothing, and prepares to white tornado the whole stinking company. There's just one small problem with her crusade: no one wants her there, and certain troublemakers have a nasty habit of waking up in pieces or with their throats cut.
Almost immediately, our gal runs into trouble in the shape of project designer and resident psycho Jack Dante (Brad Dourif). Yeah, Dante is a little weird about his work, a little touchy when it comes to criticism or demands for access to his workshop, but aren't we all? His biggest, bestest invention is some sort of super fast robot, a heap of razor sharp metals, whirling teeth, and other assorted killing things held together with a bunch of electrical cords called a Warbeast. When this thing goes for a spin through the building after our heroine cuts off Dante's funding, no one is safe. Bodies fall like freshly mown grass under the unrelenting assault of Jack's super weapon. All of these hijinks just happen to coincide with the arrival of a trio of tattooed, punked out eco-warriors set to destroy the corporation's banks of supercomputers contained in a reinforced bunker in the basement of the high-rise. You can guess what happens next: our fearless heroine teams up with the eco-punks to survive the onslaught of Dante's death machine. The trick is to get out of the building in one piece, not an easy task when you have an automated can opener chasing you all over the place.
Fortunately, ""Death Machine"" manages to entertain largely due to the Warbeast and the warped antics of Brad Dourif as Jack Dante. Dourif assumes a persona so over the top that it defies normal description. Imagine if comedian Jim Carrey took the brown blotter at Woodstock and grew up to become Charles Manson, and you have some idea of what Dourif's character looks and acts like in this movie. His character is so much fun that I must give ""Death Machine"" four stars based on him alone. As for the look and attitude of the film, well, it is just as weird as Dante. Shrill blasts of techno/thrash music reverberate throughout the proceedings, set against a backdrop of technologically savvy set pieces lit up with lighting that is positively garish. Bloodshed abounds as well, with hardly a scene passing by without someone keeling over in a heap of busted bones and pulped flesh.
""Death Machine"" has plenty of flaws--including an uneven script, some uninteresting characters, and a general sense of the ridiculous running through the whole thing--but it is still an intriguing enough movie worth spending some time on. It's certainly a memorable movie, if nothing else. The DVD edition sadly offers ""Death Machine"" in a badly cropped fullscreen transfer with little else. Would I like to see a disc loaded with plenty of extras and commentaries? Not really. This movie is a throw away film best watched and remembered at face value. Remember, there is plenty more bad sci-fi than good sci-fi, but ""Death Machine"" manages to stake out a sort of middle ground. I would definitely watch it again.",1076976000,10,5560,4.768672199170124
1054196,5,6305645493,"Wow... This movie was amoung the worst movies I've seen in a very very good way.  I agree, the death machine alone makes it worth the rental.  There are two characters I have seen before in any movie all together and the rest of the cast I have not.  Makes for a good movie in my book.  The acting was actually not that bad but the plot was laughable in a very good way.  Aside from all of that, my favorite part was the terminology and the quotes that they used.  Any movie that can actually get away with say ""a quad-matrix googaplactic of memory coprocessors"" deserves some special recognition in my book.  This movie is amazing.

He builds things for a corporation and decides that he is boing to build the ultimate killer robot security bot. We have characters a-plenty in this and no real explanation at the start as to who the interlopers in the corporation are. You find out eventually and all of the story is very plausible. The building is on lockdown and it takes the whole movie for the survivors in the building to try to find the way out all the time being hunted by this killer machine. There were no real great acting being done here but it was a fun ride and as I said at the start, Brad Dourif was way too over the top and annoying.",1498867200,,735,4.146853146853147
