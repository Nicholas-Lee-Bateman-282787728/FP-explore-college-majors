While this film is a little dated by today's standards it is a truly enjoyable film involving as stated above a wonderful assortment of characters and wise-cracks from time to time. Oh! If you are a fan of the Land Rover Series II you will not be disappointed...

And bye the bye, I found a place that had copies of the film several years ago and bought two copies just to make certain I would never miss the beginning again! Out of loyalty to Amazon.com I will not state the other place's name and only suggest that you buy this copy from this seller.",1230336000,,794,4.394557823129252
8079968,5,B0001LVGWY,"This is a South African film, known here as ""Ride The High Wind"" and was released in 1965, not 1989 as the date says. It is an immensely eerie film with beautiful photography of the desert (especially if you view it in black and white) and tells the tale of a band of adventurers searching for a fortune in gold, allegedly stolen and buried during the Anglo-Boer War. Unfortunately, one among this intrepid band is a murderer............... ooops.",1120608000,3,447,4.743589743589744
