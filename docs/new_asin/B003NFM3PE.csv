8401027,4,B003NFM3PE,"I have to say this film is different. It may seem difficult both visually and in terms of plot sequences, but the film carries a simple message. Albeit deliberately terrible and over-the-top. I found it to be a powerful and provocative glimpse into the life of this mentally ill girl... Angela I believe is the character. This film, or the series of films, is very sexually pornographic and sadistic... almost a true example of the ideals of Libertines of old. De Sade would be proud! Not a five star film due to budget; however, I'm not sure I'd watch the large budget version;)",1495324800,,579,4.631067961165049

8401031,1,B003NFM3PE,"O.k. so I kept getting these movies in my ""recomended for you"" thing for the past couple years, and I have to admit I was intrigued by the comments and ecspecially the cover art so I recently buckled and checked one out.

 I was expecting to to have ""my mind blown, man"" Instead, I found myself cleaning up the living room while the ""movie"" was on out of pure boredom. Theres just so much wrong with this movie, the first thing being that theres like 3 mins. before the movie saying how its an art project and I believed it seeing how the guy picked such a lame name as lucifer valentine, which is just hillarious I mean it does look like a student film but imean would you call a Max Hardcore movie high art, or extreme art. Second the edititing is litteraly something that looks like you did when you were a kid with a camcorder and 2 vcrs, also the goofy story about bulemia and some broad banging her dad, might have been something a little interesting if it didn't sound like it was being read by a semi literate person, or if you've never seen a talk show.

I am convinced after reading an interveiw with this ""director"" that this is a joke, to make uninteligent people defend this as ""art"" which is kinda of a cool thing I guess. If not its at best a porn flick that i'm sure lots of people dig, but there is tons of stuff out there that does this puke and pee pee and mixing horror and porn stuff way better(even 70's stuff is done way better without being pretensious or more likely, not being made to insult people who aren't that bright)

so yeah, if your into really boring movies or puking I guess check it out. If your looking for something to shock or disgust you save your money and time.",1348531200,4,1704,4.25
8401032,4,B003NFM3PE,"Devilish director Lucifer Valentine subjects all jaded viewers to his final episode of relentless filth and heinous torture.  I'll admit, I was a bit leery to watch this disturbing conclusion after being visually victimized by the utterly evil developments in SLAUGHTERED VOMIT DOLLS and REGOREGITATED SACRIFICE.  Plus, I couldn't fathom how SLOW TORTURE PUKE CHAMBER could outsick it's predecessors.  But, never underestimate Satan and his twisted little minions.  This movie presents an all new level of hardcore shocking depravity to shred the remnants of your weary soul.

Of course you should be prepared for more disgusting regurgitation and gore.  Our favorite bulimic runaway Angela(again played with disturbing realism by Ameara Lavey)made the pact with Satan and her final instuction is to help the dark lord reel in another victim.  This new Angela is played by Hope Likens, who is subjected to all sorts of extreme torture, incest, and humiliation.

All the pukeage seems toned down in this one a bit, or maybe I'm just becoming desensitized.  It's still totally gross and hard to watch, but seemingly less frequent.  Even the gore seemed to take a slight step back here.  BUT(and it is a big but), this has a terribly offensive and sacreligious scene that is so freakin wrong.  Eye-poppin' shock value that you'd have to see to believe.  Somebody is definitely gonna burn in hell for all eternity.  Then there is a final bloody ultra-gross horribly awesome mutiliation scene to close it out that will have gorehounds squealing in delight.

Valentine works evil magic with a super-low budget throughout his entire Vomit Gore Trilogy.  He knows absolutely no boundaries that are legal.  The cast is fearless (and has quite a dark side that becomes evident).  STPC is graphic, disturbing, and sick genius.  This is meant only for the most hardcore fans.",1287360000,3,1863,5.129568106312292
8401033,1,B003NFM3PE,"I am the kind of person that has curiosity that kills, cats, people, expectations. When someone tells me that a film will twist my brain for life, I must see it. It has led to a many disappointment and possibly I am just too jaded by the age of fifty, always chasing the treasure. The thrill to beat all thrills. I took acid in the seventies, smoked pot, took downers and snorted cocaine. That is all past me now. I know what those things are and what they lead to. I still have not stopped chasing a thrill, though.
 For people who just need to see, like me, I think you will be bored. It is a lot of vomiting and some of the happenings sound much better when you're telling someone else about it than it was actually mind bending to watch. When will we all learn? I wish I would learn soon. For satisfying my curiosity, I pay much wasted dollars. If you are a person who gets off sexually or otherwise by this kind if sick stuff I guess it might be worth it.  For all the thrill seekers like me out there, save your money. I know some of you won't, just like I had to see for myself, but most people will watch it and try not to fall asleep. Snuff film aficionado's however, might get some worth. Hopefully cathartic in it's vicarious nature so that it eliminates the NEED to actually go out and do this kind of thing.  Other than that, a total waste of time and money. Lucifer Valentine is a very cool moniker though, wish I had thought of it.",1285718400,18,1446,4.17562724014337
8401034,4,B003NFM3PE,"First off, I only bought this movie cause I wanted to be the first with a posted review on amazon (hope to get some feed back). I have not seen the first two in the series but something tells me I don't need to. This is a movie that you will watch once and might not ever watch it again unless you are into crazy, preverse, and just down right discusting movies. I read the reviews for the first two so i knew what for the most part what i was getting. A couple of girls with bulimea and a guy(later in the movie) sticking their fingers down their throats and puking...eating the puke to throw it back up again. And while that is all happening a girl is telling a story about how her family messed her up. It will be one of the most messed up movies you could see. This is for sure the most extreme movie in my collection.

I give it 4 stars because of how extreme it is, the furthest I have seen in perversion.

There is lots of nudity, lots of puke, lots of gore. A GORNO so to speak not for the easily offended. You've been warned but don't take my word for it check it out for yourself.",1284768000,5,1090,4.018433179723503
8401035,5,B003NFM3PE,"This is the third and final installment of Lucifer Valentine's vomit gore trilogy, Slow Torture Puke Chamber. This film runs approximately 75 min. long and like the others has many extras on the DVD. Following the same suit as the previous, this film revolves around bulimic hookers who have devoted their lives to Satan. This film as expected will make the viewers uneasy in their own skin and a confession post viewing might also be in order! Prepare to witness acts so heinous and sacrilegious you might possibly not even make it through the entirety of this film. I am surprised a bolt of lightning did not strike me down from above, no joke. Caution to future viewers: The content of this film is extreme, Lucifer pulls no punches and goes straight for the throat with this one. This film is dark, nauseating, cruel, sickening, loaded with sex, nudity, body fluids, gore and very, very entertaining! If this sounds like your genre prepare to be astonished!

I will not get into the details of the imagery set forth in this film but will add that the women are looking quite sickly (drug use, the streets and bulimia taking it's toll) and also to be very careful with any audience's for this particular viewing! Most will NOT consider this even remotely entertaining.

Note to the director: As this film concludes the vomit gore trilogy, I wish Mr. Valentine the best of luck in whatever endeavors are next and can only hope that he keeps the blood, bile and insanity coming at a full wrench!!!",1284768000,5,1498,4.692015209125476
