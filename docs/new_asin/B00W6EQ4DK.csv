8712310,5,B00W6EQ4DK,"All movie history buffs should have this blu ray in their collection; I am amazed at the remarkable job they did in redoing this masterpiece of early cinema.  This restoration is much better than what I expected for films originally released in the 1920s.  Both the picture and sound qualities are excellent considering the age and even looks better than the ""Battleship Potemkin"" restoration by Kino.  This blu ray release also represents great value as it comes with 3 other films: ""Three Songs About Lenin"", ""Enthusiam: Symphony of the Donbass"", and ""Kino-Eye""  all very well restored as well.  The main course however is ""The Man with the Movie Camera"" which in my opinion is by far the best among all 4 films here.  I am amazed at how enthralled I was watching this from start to finish and as all classic films do makes me want to watch it again and again. Vertov certainly was a genius of early cinema and this blu ray is the proof.  Also included is a 25-page booklet containing notes about the releases.

Very highly recommended!",1510876800,2,1038,4.696132596685083
8712311,5,B00W6EQ4DK,"Just finished watching Blu Ray of Dziga Vertov most famous works. For those who do not know, he was an documentary filmmaker known for his experiments behind the camera. There are five movies in the set, four of which I've seen before: ""Kino-Eye"" (1924), ""Kino-Truth"" (1925) - that's the one that I haven't seen before, ""Enthusiasm: the symphony of Donbass"" (1931), ""Three songs about Lenin"" (1934) and his most famous work: ""Man with a movie camera"" (1929).
This is amazing piece of restoration, with some minor things going against it. So, here they are:
""Kino-Eye"" is a very amusing slice of life in Soviet Union. The chapters are widely different from comparison of Young Pioneers in the city and the country, to the fresh produce markets, to mental patients in Kanatchikova Dacha mental hospital. Here we see many of his experiments, for example, there are couple of segments shot backwards like meat in an abattoir changing back to live bull and leaving on the train. But overall the movie is the weakest of the bunch.
""Kino-truth"" and ""Three songs about Lenin"" are both about Lenin the first one done at one year anniversary of Lenin's death, the second at the tenth. It is obvious that Vertov was idolizing Lenin, and these movies are very personal. Some footage is re-used, especially regarding Lenin's funeral. The interesting thing that despite cult of personality Stalin appears for total of couple of seconds in the movies: standing next to the body of Lenin. This is as much as some famous purged people appear: Zinoviev, Kamenev, Tukhachevski, etc. The ""Three songs"" is a sound movie, but it still has the intertitles, sound used mostly for the music. The quality of restoration is pristine. The movies are very good, but you get the feeling why the party bosses were afraid to allow this avant-garde filmmaker to make more movies. They are just too weird.
""Enthusiasm: the symphony of Donbass"" is a rarely seen gem: one of the first sound movies made in USSR. Here Vertov experiments with sound as he usually did with the camera and results are great. The movie itself is probably the most political one of the bunch: it shows transformation of the USSR during the first five year plan. Church is converted to workers club, where was vodka there is sport, where was outdated coal mining modern (for the time) technologies slowly encroach.
The last one is the most famous one - ""man with a movie camera"". It doesn't have intertitles. There are no actors except for the cinematographer played by Vertov's brother Mikhail Kaufman. There is no screenplay. It just the life of the city from the early morning until the evening. And it is stunning. Trams leaving for a day run. People waking up in flats and on the park benches. Trains running. Intersections. Windows of shops. Pubs. Cars on the streets. Weddings. Funerals. Coal miners. Policemen.
It would've been great just historically, but it is also great artistically: Vertov never seen trick shot he did not like. And all of this is very appropriate tool to show the pulse of a city.
Great, great movie. The only thing I did not care for is modern soundtrack based on Vertov's specifications. It is not distracting though.
A very good blue ray, highly recommend for everybody interested in history or great cinema.",1484870400,4,3282,4.85204991087344
8712312,2,B00W6EQ4DK,"The video is sharp and clear enough alright, and the digital restoration of the film itself is excellent, but there is a TRANSFER problem with video frame de-interlacing.  In shots with rapid motion, multiple steps of motion can be seen WITHIN each single frame.  If you pause the disc on any frame in which rapid motion is occurring, you will see the flaw immediately.

Also, the musical score by the Alloy Orchestra is one of the WORST musical accompaniments to a film I have ever heard.  Simply AWFUL ""music"".  I wish there were an alternate track with a traditional classical score, but there isn't.  As it is, I'd simply rather watch this with the volume turned off.",1456704000,6,671,4.6923076923076925
8712313,5,B00W6EQ4DK,"Best version of this film EVER!! Superb photographic quality.
At long last the left side of the image has been included in its entirety, previously masked off (in all other versions) when transferred to a format where the soundtrack area masked out the image. This ratio is truly 1.33:1. The composition of images is now balanced, left and right.
Transferred, regrettably at 24 (or 25, I suspect) frames per second, rather than 20 or 21 frames per second, as would still have been the practice in Russia in 1929, just before the arrival of sound. There are many changes of speed in the film, fast and slow motion, but ""normal speed"" scenes still run too fast.
The Alloy Orchestra accompaniment is worthy, but I prefer my own edited selections of more symphonic and popular music of the time, including works by Glazunov, Liapunov, Balakirev, Kalinnikov, Stravinsky, Prokofiev, and others.",1441843200,9,888,4.966442953020135

8712317,5,B00W6EQ4DK,"This 2015 Flicker Alley BD was supposed to replace my copy of the original R2/PAL Bfi SD Purchased from Amazon UK back in May 2008. But it's informative to compare/contrast that one with this new release for: (1) an appreciation of the phenomenal restoration job by the EYE Film Institute, La Cinematheque de Toulouse, and Lobster Films (Paris) - it just doesn't seem possible to resurrect such an old film to near-perfect PQ; (2) a *very great* appreciation of how Nyman's original music soundtrack for the Bfi SD gives a *completely* different perspective on Vertov's movie. It could be a case study in an ""Intro to Film Scores"" class.",1435708800,5,637,4.853211009174312

8712319,4,B00W6EQ4DK,"When you think of Soviet silent cinema, 3 names immediately come to mind. There's Sergei Eisenstein (BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN), Vsevolod Pudovkin (MOTHER), and Alexander Dovzhenko (EARTH). These directors and their movies are celebrated for their use of montage editing. The man who pushed that idea farther than anyone else at the time was Dziga Vertov (""spinning top""), a pseudonym for David Abelevich Kaufman (1896-1954) who is not as well known as the others. He initially studied medicine and later began writing fiction and non-fiction before focusing on camera technique. By 1917 he was working as an editor on Soviet newsreels before taking his equipment to the battlefront of World War I and to protest movements at home.

A fervent Socialist and devoted to Lenin, he began to use his newsreels to hone his technique and to further Communist ideology. His primary concern was to develop ""film truth"" by concentrating on arranged images of everyday life and doing away with traditional narrative and dramatic structure. Nowhere is this more evident than in his avant garde documentary THE MAN WITH THE MOVIE CAMERA. It remains as fresh and provocative today as it was in 1929 especially in this new transfer which shows the film the way it was originally released. This digital restoration is a collaborative effort from several different organizations and it is an absolute revelation.

The pristine imagery is complemented by a persuasive new score from the Alloy Orchestra that truly complements the often startling visuals the film contains. To fully appreciate how good this restoration is, compare it with the other films on the disc which haven't been restored. They are quite watchable but look their age. MAN WITH THE MOVIE CAMERA looks as if it were shot yesterday. Speaking of the other three films, they keep this release from getting the full 5 stars. It has nothing to do with their look or sound (which is vintage early Soviet) but rather with the content. KINO EYE, ENTHUSIASM, and especially THREE SONGS OF LENIN are seriously heavy handed propaganda pieces that become tiresome after awhile despite their remarkable visuals.

The anti-religious imagery in the opening parts of ENTHUSIASM will offend some people while the endless shots of Lenin in his coffin surrounded by the grieving masses while extolling his virtues in THREE SONGS ABOUT LENIN must be seen to be believed. Of course this set will be of primary interest to  film scholars and those interested in Soviet silent cinema and as such it comes highly recommended. If you've never seen MAN WITH THE MOVIE CAMERA then you should. Orson Welles certainly did. Many thanks to Lobster Films, the EYE Film Institute, La Cinematique de Toulouse, and Blackhawk Films for the work and the materials. Also thanks to Flicker Alley for making the release of this rare material possible.",1432944000,13,2858,5.087420042643923
