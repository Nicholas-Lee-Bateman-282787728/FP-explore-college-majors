443048,5,6302250277,"Thelma & Louise: , Ridley Scott's great direction of Callie Khouri's flawless scriptof and a fine cast, splendid photography, music that was right on the mark in every scene.
This is what great movie making is all  about, and this one was my idea of superb entertainment. Not one scene was  off a scintilla. The actors' every facial and physical expressions brought  forth the emotion called for by every last scene, voice intonations were  perfect.
When Louise cautioned Thelma against being so open, Thelma's  response, after revealing her inner pain with expression, was simply,  ""Right!"" with an emphatic little nod of her head. A tiny snippet,  but like every other part of the movie it was precisely right.  When a look  would do, there was no dialog. We got it.
After at least eight screenings  I can't point to a single flaw, not even a weak point. Such passing  characters as Harlan Puckett and the waitress at the Silver Bullet were  perfect, both in casting and execution. ""Come on, Hal, not even a  teeny, weeny, weeny little drink?"" She was a jewel.
Leonard Maltin's  parting comment about it being another road movie was imbecilic. Thelma  & Louise was anything but a ""road movie."" It just happened  that much of it occurred on the road -- where else for two girls on the  run?
Thelma & Louise has taken a slight edge off some of my old  favorites.",947808000,4,1362,4.675105485232067
443049,5,6302250277,Thelma & Loise is truly one of the best movies ever made. There's one thing though. It's not just for women. Men can enjoy this beautiful film and it's meanings as well. A great movie that provokes powerful emotions  from within. Superb!,937094400,2,237,4.642857142857143
443050,5,6302250277,"Truly a masterpiece and I'm so glad it's on DVD.  However, I found that Scott Ridley's commentary spoke about just everything but the picture.  His early life, trials and tribulations, how to get a film previewed, how much  it costs, etc.  I guess some of you find this interesting (see a comment  below) but when we are fortunate to get a director to do a DVD commentary,  I think he or she should at least talk about what we're watching and not  the philosophy of movie making. There are so many things I'd like to know  about that went into the making of this classic film.",936057600,,576,4.367924528301887
443051,5,6302250277,"As a lover of the Southwestern deserts, I find this movie extremely appealing.  The film is a winner just for its artistic merits.  Ridley Scott knew how to put together the music, the mood, the pace, and the  setting.  Recall the curious matron at the bus stop gazing at Louise in her  convertible while she waits for Thelma, who incidentally was robbing the  store---that camera motion, the light, the music matching the naive  curiosity, and the incongruous presence of Louise in the T'bird.  And then,  the aimless driving in the moonlight surrounded by the rock monuments of  Arches National Park, and Louise's contemplating their fate amid such  beautiful surroundings at the crack of dawn---indeed a powerful scene  evoking the experiences of awe some of us have had when in the midst of  these humbling desert vastness.  What could she be thinking that kept her  awake, while her less mature soulmate was fast asleep in the car?  Even  more powerful was the scene when they flee the chaos of countless police  cars chasing them in the field, and finding themselves in the yawning rock  wilderness of Canyonlands National Park. The ominous silence, a minimum of  background music that builds up slowly to the portent of the helicopter  hovering, but still hidden, alongside them above the Colorado River, and  then suddenly emerging face-to-face, much to their desperation, or so we  think.  The director knew the magic of the desert and canyon wilderness and  used it to maximum advantage as spectacular backdrop to the concluding and  climactic part of this gem of a movie.",935539200,,1582,4.9655172413793105
443052,5,6302250277,"Yes, I had a hard time jogging this flic from my mind. The message it gives off is so inspiring, so empowering... and because it's given by two female lead characters, it's been termed a feminist movie. Sure, there was  sex, margaritas and wild turkeys straight up. There was armed robbery, the  murder of a would be rapist, and the shooting up of a large semi driven by  a horny truck driver. But hey, these girls never backed down. They never  gave up. Submissive... they were anything but. No wonder if caused such a  fiasco. Jerry Falwall would've rolled over in his grave if he wasn't alive  when this movie came out. Ha ha. Thelma and Louise is a classic. Sarandon  and Davis are out of this world. Pitt has a chest to die for. And the music  is wonderful. I have a convertible, and I love it because it makes me feel  like Louise. It's just a great movie.",931392000,2,862,4.3375

443133,1,6302250277,"This movie is propaganda and social engineering.  It's designed to manipulate the minds of viewers, especially young women.  This story is tragic, but it has the illusion of being inspiring  The ending is cowardly, but has the illusion of being brave. Thelma and Louise destroyed themselves - Metaphorically and Literally.

The beginning introduces the characters and establishes that Thelma is an unhappy house wife.  Louise appears and becomes a role model for her.

The real story starts when they go on a road trip and stop at a bar.  Louise hadn't wanted to stop there, but she did it for Thelma.  Thelma got drunk and spent the night dancing with, being all over, a guy at the bar.  Then she left with him.

Once in the parking lot she suddenly didn't know what was happening.  She'd given him every reason to believe he was getting sex, and suddenly she turned into a damsel in distress.

The pathetic bastard wouldn't back off.  He was going to have what she'd lead him to believe was offered.  The bastard would have groped her for a few minutes, pumped her a tiny bit, came very quickly, and left her unharmed.  As sick as he was, anyone who'd seen this more than once knows, that would have been better than how the movie ends

Louise pulled a gun, and Thelma walked away unharmed, no sex.  Then Louise shot him dead - not to protect or defend, but because he was an ass.  It would later be revealed Louise was a rape victim, so actually she murdered that guy for another man's crimes.

It wasn't self defense, but they could easily have claimed that.  But instead they run for Mexico.  That's the key part of the of movie.  The movie paints Thelma and Louise as victims from that point forward.

Louise has her savings brought to her, and then they pick up a hitch hiker. He and Thelma have sex, then she leaves him alone with the cash. He steals it, leaving them without money.  Leaving any complete stranger alone with a large amount of cash is stupid.  But the point was to blame sex for their loss, and to state that Thelma never had good sex with her husband.

From there things deteriorate rapidly.  Thelma robs a store.  So Thelma was officially a criminal. Then they take a cop hostage and lock him in his car's trunk.  They complemented each other on getting good at being criminals, when actually they didn't have a chance after that.

Then they shoot at a truck driver and blow up his truck.  The scene shows them as strong and powerful, when they were actually traumatizing a tiny little man.

Then the ending.  They're cornered at the Grand Canyon.  They'd spend the rest of their lives in Prison for their crimes.  Rather than surrender they drive off the cliff.  They'd reached the point where death was the best option.  But neither say ""I'd rather die""  Thelma says ""Let's keep going""  The picture freezes in mid air, with inspiring music playing, then cuts rite to a flash back of them on the road.  Creating the illusion that they do keep going.",1503878400,,2976,4.541509433962264

443135,5,6302250277,"I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater and I still love this movie.  My best friend and I went to see it together thinking it was a comedy about two friends taking a vacation.  It started out that way.  I thought all the actors were cast perfectly in their roles.  It was the first time seeing Brad Pitt in a film.  He was young and beautiful and he's still not too shabby. Thelma, Louise and the ""Cowboy"" made the movie but Thelma's husband, Louise's ""boyfriend""Jimmy and the FBI investigator roles portrayed 3 men: A creep who got what he deserved (so rarely happens); A pitiful, ""good man"" trying desperately to hold onto the woman he FINALLY realizes he loves (typical possessive male ); and a sympathetic cop (over the top).
Put them altogether and the piece fit.  The film showed sisterhood between two diverse women who just wanted to get out of Dodge and ""have some fun"".  As a woman, I was horrified by the rape scene and doubly horrified when Louise. . .well, I won't give it away.  Thelma & Louise's  switcheroo made me think of  married couples who solve life's problems and comfort each other; finding strength when the other is weak. Very well written and performed.  There are a few scenes that had little to do with the plot but added some comedy relief. I'm ordering a CD because my video is wearing out.  Indelibly etched in my mind as the best movie I've seen about 2 females trapped in a dichotomy of comedy & tragedy;
look more and more like they've been pushed through a keyhole; while their beauty still shines through.  One my top ten favorite movies of all time.
Thelma & Louise are in with some good company.  BTW:  Brad Pitt was Adorable:)",1503532800,,1675,4.481848184818482

443140,2,6302250277,"I heard much about this film since its release, pro and con, but never brought myself to viewing it til recently.  It has not weathered well over the years.  Its neo-feminism is as trope-ridden as the film's faux Southern accents and its male chauvinist stereotypes.  That this production is seen as ""pro-woman"" reduces the idea of feminism to role reversal: empowerment = power to inflict humiliation and violence.  This must be justified in terms of male characters written so egregiously misogynistic, weak, deceitful and violent that they just ""deserve"" whatever our heroines feel like giving them.

The clinker came, for this reviewer, as the self-assured police officer is reduced to a whimpering baby at gunpoint, his castration completed by forced return to the surrogate womb of his car trunk in a fetal position to remind him, supposedly, of ""where he came from.""  In the southwest desert this would amount to a death sentence.  I don't recall how the trunk air vents subsequently appeared - maybe I missed something - but how convenient that a Rasta daggaman (T & L's symbolic partner in liberation) just happens to be in the desert rolling a blunt and blows smoke into the officer's ""hole.""  I'm sure countless champions of womens' dignity cheered Timothy Carhart's execution by Louise for mouthing verbal threats, even though Louise was not present when the real cause of action was occurring.  By the time the totally unbelievable truck driver was brought down I was sighing a bored ""Really?  This is what their emancipation comes down to?""  Reducing men into the sniveling testosterone-poisoned wretches they are leaves T&L with the twin outlets of same-sex partnering and death: an interesting combination.  But this was the early 90s.

Harvey Keitel's Hal is the only decent representative of the other half - there has to be at least one good one to offset the general rule that all penises are the enemy.  Ironically, it is only after Thelma's sexual liberation by Brad Pitt's expert handling that she discovers her ""true"" violent female self. They seem to realize their bad choices by road's end; but the hype generally has this cliff-edge finale a metaphor for society's lack of place for truly liberated (ie, violence-empowered) women.  The ensuing cultural spinoffs - the Dixie Chicks' ""Goodbye Earl,"" Taylor Swift's ""Picture to Burn"" - allege that women, per Franz Fanon, are most emancipated when free to indulge in said ""liberationist"" violence.  I happen to disagree and see a new cultural trope now in full flower, one as ugly as its target.",1502323200,,2569,5.037825059101655

The movie was beautiful, the acting was great, their friendship was heart wrenching. But they are a bad example for grown women. It is an example of women exercising their rights and their freedom to act like victims. Sleeping with hitchhikers, robbing stores, and committing suicide is not admirable.

443405,5,6302250277,"This is undoubtedly one of the best movies ever about two women driving a car across America with the wind in their hair and the cops on their tail. Not that they have real tails or anything. I mean they're not some kind of human-horse hybrid. When I say 'on their tail' I mean following closely behind, like you do when you invite your friends over and then walk around the house pretending to be sardines... maybe I'm the only one that does that. Anyway, this is a damn good movie in an even better damn good kind of way that will keep you on the edge of your seat, until you fall off the edge of your seat and then have to sit on the edge of the floor (have you ever tried to find the edge of the floor? It can take a while). This movie has everything... except jam. I didn't see any jam in it. Not even in the restaurant scenes, but if you can forgive that  and if you're a Christian the bible says you should  then there's very little wrong with this movie and whole lot right with it. Both Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are superbly wonderful and will make you laugh, cry and blow marijuana smoke into the trunk of your car. The movie also stars a very young Brad Pitt. I will now give you an official warning:  There are a few scenes, with Brad Pitt, that will make women - and probably some men - swoon. So, if you're watching with someone who has a history of swooning then you should have your emergency swoon kit at the ready (smelling salts, brandy, megaphone, electric cattle prod, etc). You will need it on more than one occasion.

The story itself is brilliantly written and executed. Though no one actually gets executed. It's not that kind of movie. If you want to watch someone being executed watch 'The Green Mile' or 'The Godfather' or something like that. Meanwhile... back at this movie. I don't want to give anything away  because I'm not that generous  but I will tell you that the plot has more twists than Chubby Checker dancing down a mountain road and there are several iconic scenes, (not to be confused with ironic scenes which are not allowed any more because Alanis Morissette owns the copyright of that word).

Trust me, after watching this you will want to make a road trip yourself. Just remember to avoid Texas.",1466208000,,2248,4.363636363636363

443471,5,6302250277,"This movie is now a classic and when I saw it after many years had passed, it all came back to me as to why this film had such an impact on me. I would say after seeing the movie...I'm gonna do a Thelma And Louise on you!!

Susan and Geena were not superstars back then but they were respected actresses and this was important to the writer because she didn't want actors who would give preconceived ideas about her characters. Brad Pitt was also unknown and very cute which played very well in his role of a drifter, especially one that can seduce.

This film was visceral to me at the time because it showed women fighting back and saying no to the male super ego and fighting against male dominance. It was less important as a realistic document and more important as a film with a message and an outburst of feeling. I also admire the western quality in the visuals as in the John Ford films, because it takes the story to another level. Instead of it being about two women who are now loose cannons in a gritty and narrow environment it's about two women getting angry at the world in all its wild and vast glory; I find that very attractive.
During the course of the film Geena Davis' character, Thelma is difficult to accept! This is an important part of the experience; it's not about the logic or perfection or maturity of the female characters; it shows them as flawed; especially Thelma!

The characters function on many levels. Susan's character, Louise is more mature and interesting. People and in this case friends don't necessarily function on all levels of common sense and liability. This is the strength of the film and script. This is totally about chaos!

Thelma's husband actually has a more realistic view of his wife even though he is a jerk! And Louise realizes she doesn't really know her friend; that's throughout the script in Louise's reactions to all of Thelma's immature decisions; she realizes her friend is unstable! She brings Louise down and Louise can't fault her friend for these weaknesses for many obvious reasons. One being that she herself makes her own bad judgments throughout the film. Louise has to give up in the end; forgive her reckless friend and accept fate.

This is a strong female movie because the women are not perfect; they are as reckless as men can be! That is the strength of the film. It doesn't alter the message of women giving it back to the super macho ego. It takes women like them to fight back but it's Louise that is the real hero, Thelma is a sidekick, a loose cannon like any man can be! That is something we had never really seen in a modern film before.

We know nothing of these characters until the road trip; so there's nothing to compare them against; no prior history of their humanity. We have no idea how they are going to react in certain situations. It's the element of surprise that really works in this movie. Hitchcock always said when the audience expects logic in human behaviour they are not being realistic, because people don't usually act from logic but emotion and Thelma is all emotion!

The end is glorified in the movie; instead of two bodies at the bottom of the canyon it's two spirits who soar! This is the essence of all spirituality; caring less about the body and caring more about the soul. Louise realizes; wow this is the Grand Canyon and Thelma realizes I can't go back to who I was and after all that, I can't go to prison. Let's just go ahead, keep on going. I remember being really affected in that final scene.",1458950400,,3518,4.5133437990580845

Susan Sarandon and Gina Davis are flawless.
Harvey Keitel redeems men all men.

When this film first came out it was a shocking brilliant departure for all other films -- these women achieve the notorious apotheosis of Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid -- they are spiritual underdog folk heroes who spirits live on by those who honor and remember them

Before we had lesbian films galore, we had this film, this one shared life-pact kiss

Watch it and weep.

Show to every girl between 12 and 40 who needs to process what it means to be in the male gaze.

extraordinarily filmed -- a Western

forever,

444045,5,6302250277,"When I first saw this movie it hit me really hard. I was a teenage girl living in an emotionally abusive home environment. My dad was a very intimidating man who enjoyed keeping his wife and two children under his severe control. I watched my mom fall to pieces under his abuse; to the point where she attempted suicide and only lived because she did not consume enough prescription pills to get the job done. There are no words to describe the heavy weight of fear that loomed over our family and over me as the years went by and this man continued to have such a tight grip. The moment his presence was near we tensed up. So when this movie came along, I felt a strange sense of hope that one day .. someday .. we would break free from this abuse and start to live healthy lives.

These two women filled my thoughts with a certain inner empowerment. That there comes a time when many people see a door of escape and they take it. Watching the way Thelma's husband treats her brings tears to my eyes. So many good people, both men and women, take so much abuse off their partners when they do nothing to deserve it. So many lives are trapped in a state of no happiness as they feel unable to walk away or turn to someone else for help.

While the movie ending was a very sad one, it was a real fear in my home that either my mom or I would eventually set ourselves free the only way we felt we could back then. But one day, after a very heated fight, my dad made a remark that sent chills down my spine. I knew he had a rifle hidden in the trunk of his car that he thought my mom knew nothing about. When he made an ominous threat that our time was coming, I knew it was time for me to get my mom out of that house before someone ended up dead. The police came out, talked with my broken down mom in heavy tears then they went over to my dad. When they came back to us, they said ""this man won't hurt you"". They told us nothing of protective orders we could file nor did they offer to get us out of there safely if we needed to leave. They just left. So while my dad was out in his storage building doing something, my mom came to me shaking and scared, asking me to go tell my dad to leave. I knew better than to tell this man to leave his own home. We had been with him for 30 years (I am disabled) but this was still ""his home"".

So we left.

I used a credit card for us to stay in a motel until we could find a place to rent. Both of us were in uncharted territory, never having taken care of ourselves before. We were financially ill-prepared for such an exit but there was no safer thing to do but leave right then and there. The situation at home had reached a very dangerous point where my dad knew we wanted him out of our lives and he was in a state of panic where he was not about to watch us walk away to live out of range from his controlling reign.

It has been ten years. He has died (poor health), no longer able to torment anyone else. My mom has become her own woman with a job and a car. She makes her own money at a grocery store as a cashier. it isn't much but she is alive, has nobody holding her down or holding her back, and she is filled with more self confidence than she ever felt in her 30 year marriage.

This movie, while some claim it's a feminist movie, I see it as a movie that fills many abuse victims with hope. Hope that one day they, too, will find their way out of the prison they wake up to each day. This movie impacted my life when I would go to bed each night never knowing what I would wake up to the next day. Those were dark days, dark years. Too many wasted years.

I hope if anyone in an abusive situation is reading this .. I hope you find your own way out eventually. It might not be today, it might not be soon but please never give up on hope. Never give up on yourself. Never stop believing that some day you will set yourself free.

Driving over a cliff sometimes seems like the only choice but .. if my mom and I found our way out, trust me when I say, you can do it too. Until then, never let your abuser destroy your self esteem. You are worth so much more than they make you feel.",1388102400,7,4138,3.97710843373494

First they stop at a roadhouse to dance & have a few drinks and the trouble starts, then they pick up a ""hitchhiker"" (Brad Pitt) and he steals their money. It all goes downhill from there. Tommy Lee Jones keeps trying to resolve the situation but the girls keep making bad decisions. I did not care for the ending which is why it got 4 instead of 5 stars.

444123,3,6302250277,"Nearly twenty-five years after it's release, Thelma & Louise is still heralded as a classic, and is on most critics best films list. For years I'd heard about how outrageous and empowering this film is, but I'd never seen it in it's entirety. I've seen bits and pieces on cable and seen parodies of it, but I really never saw anything that made me want to watch it. The story is an interesting one about these two ladies who go on a weekend vacation. The ladies go drinking and partying, which gets them into some trouble and leads to them going on the run. This is one of those films that has those classic moments that really shine over the rest of the film. I found Thelma & Louise to be quite forgettable, but it's those particular scenes that will stay with me. The cast was in class all it's own and I think that's why the critics loved this film so much. Thelma & Louise may have been revolutionary for 1992, but in 2013, it's really not all that extreme, and in the years since, there have been so many copycats, that it's hard to differentiate it from all the similar stories that came after it. Geena Davis is just unbelievably good as Thelma. I love Geena Davis, I think she's extremely underrated, and it's her performance that makes this film work. How she doesn't win the Oscar for her portrayal of Thelma is beyond me. Susan Sarandon wasn't bad either, she's not really known for comedy and too me, she'll always be the one who prevented Bull Durham from being THE ultimate baseball film, but she was impressive. The cast member that was most interesting to me, was the young drifter, played by a good looking newcomer named Brad Pitt. In his first major film, Brad Pitt was so much different from the man we know today, it really showed the age of this film and just how much things can change in a relatively short period of time. It's hard to believe, but it was almost exactly five years after this films release that he starred in Se7en. As I said previously, this film is considered to be one of the best films of all time and it's gain that reputation because of it's performances and stand out scenes. Thelma & Louise have their moments on their little adventure, but in the end, it's familiar, predictable, and forgettable.",1372982400,3,2247,4.469586374695864

444185,4,6302250277,"As there are many different ways to interpret music, abstract art, Shakespeare or any art for that matter; so are different approaches to interpret this movie. ""Thelma & Louise"" transcend beyond the simplified interpretation as ""Bad Girls"" chick flick comedy, or a counterpoint to the male version of Road Movies. It could also be construed as a protest movie, a cry against the exacerbating violence in society. As soon as law and social morals are abandoned it may lead to a society in chaos.
 When I first saw ""Thelma & Louise"", I was shocked and perturbed by its ending; I kept asking myself what led to this tragic ending and if T & L had other choices than suicide. Following the events which led to this tragic situation, two casual women friends set up for a two days economical relaxation trip. During the journey they were sexually harassed, their money was stolen, situation started to exacerbate and out of control; they committed murder in self defence, armed robbery in order to survive, add to it disbelief in the juridical system to enforce justice. This chain of events eventually led to their self-destruction that was initially triggered by the violence in society. This idea is also beautifully conveyed by the ominous musical background played by the wailing and lamenting electric guitar.",1354752000,,1310,4.954545454545454
444186,5,6302250277,"The review ""It's Just A Movie"". Really? How observant-it is just that a movie. Movies ask us to suspend our disbelief for an hour or two. EVERYTHING doesn't have to be realistic - I get enough of that on the news.

Thelma & Louise react how some people MIGHT. Does it make sense the path they took to those of us in the comforts of our seats-not always. But it makes perfect sense to these CHARACTERS in this MOVIE. I guess if you have never been in a surreal experience it is difficult to extrapolate that to put yourself in these characters shoes. You DO NOT think logically or rationally. A large portion of your brain is trying to reconcile what has just happened & potential consequences of such.

Louise said it perfectly when she references the events being a ""snowball effect"".

For those of you not observant, Louise apparently was a rape victim and may have killed her attacker. Thus, it would seem from her viewpoint that the law would find that coincidence improbable & a slick DA & lame jury could lock her away. She may have done time for whatever was eluded to happening in Texas.

As for Thelma sleeping with Brad's character-again, some women's psychological reaction to rape is promiscuity. Or she maybe needed to try to take back her power in CHOOSING to have sex with him.

This movie is one hell of a ride & obviously one of my favorites. I'm sorry for those of you that miss out on all the subtlties in this gem of a movie. It is a fabulous character study of the wonders of the human psyche.

Tip: Louise is VERY anal at the start- buttoned up, starched collar-ish, no dirty dishes left in the sink, tidy, tidy, tidy. Controlled even when she is on vacation (she was awkward & stiff at the bar at first). Oh, what a transformation that occurs for this character.",1354752000,,1785,4.460122699386503

Thelma and Louise is just the opposite.  The scenes of the vista of the northwest are breathtaking, even more so
than the Hitchcock movie.  If Sarandon & Davis did not win academy awards then they were robbed and I think they were for I don't remember them getting awards.  Simply put it is the story of two girl friends going for a night out without male permission and Davis becoming intoxicated and a drunk dragging her out to back of a car and fixing to rape her.  Sarandon shoots him and from then on, hang on to your hats, you are going for one hell of a ride never to be forgotten.

444192,5,6302250277,"Ridley Scott has had a good run of things.  Sure, he's not done, but looking back at his career he could easily retire happy with what he's produced.  He's basically created a cultural landmark for each decade.  Between `Alien' (1979), `Blade Runner' (1982), `Thelma and Louise' (1991) and `Gladiator' (2000) he's established himself as a director full of range and talent and sustainability.  I have the utmost faith that his upcoming `The Counselor' will prove his talents once again (what a cast, what a story!) and cement his efforts for the next decade of film.

For me, `Thelma and Louise' could possibly be his finest film.  I have a very soft spot in my heart for this beautiful movie, thanks in large part to everyone involved and the depth of passion they poured into this project.  There is no doubt in my mind that this is the best film of 1991, and that year was astounding (`BEAUTY AND THE BEAST'!!!) so that is saying a lot.

`Thelma and Louise' tells the story of two best friends aptly named Thelma and Louise.  These two women, iconic thanks to the flawless way in which their characters are developed by both Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis, are victims of a society that takes advantage of them.  Thelma is being suffocated by her controlling husband, and Louise is a sassy waitress who is desperate to help Thelma break free and breathe some fresh air so-to-speak.  What starts out as a harmless road-trip turns into a panic when a man tries to force himself on Thelma, and Louise is forced to take matters into her own hands.  Now, on the run and paranoid of being found, these two women build on their strong bond as they realize all they have in the world is each other.

Ridley directs this film with such finesse, allowing these two characters to really shine.  He builds a film around two of the most interesting characters and give the audience a reason to be drawn to them.  But really, the star of this show is Susan Sarandon.  Wait, the star of this show is Geena Davis.  WAIT!  Seriously, these two women are so in tune with one another it's ridiculous.  There are many films that rely on co-leads to carry them and there is usually one particular standout who steals the bulk of the attention.  That isn't really so here.  For me, Sarandon and Davis make the perfect Yin and Yang.  Their differences only help to balance out the whole in creating such a refreshing take on the buddy film, because they complete one another in ways that I haven't seen before.  Sarandon's breed of `no-nonsense' aggressor is perfectly balanced out by Davis's nave sensuality.  Her flirtatious innocence plays devil's advocate to Sarandon's intense `all knowing' persona.  They draw off one another and push the envelope in such marvelous ways.

If ever the Academy should have had a tie in Best Actress, it was 1991 (but alas, they went with that Foster woman instead).

With a strong supporting cast that includes a breakout performance from Brad Pitt and a beautifully sincere performance from Harvey Keitel, Ridley Scott's masterpiece is one for the ages.  It touches upon such deeply moving themes as friendship and love and it manages to stick with you for all times.  I can still feel the chills I felt the very first time I saw this film; those tears still staining my cheek to this very day.",1339113600,,3313,4.663793103448276

In many ways, this movie is not about murder, but rather the crimes we sometimes all commit in our own secret lives, and the desperate measures which manufacture our escape from them, even if the escape route eventually leads into more trouble than it's worth.
It's about knowing what we did, keeping the secrets from the ones we love, and having to deal with problems in a manner of unlikely escape than simply confront, explain, and resolve the situation no matter how dire it may seem.

444230,2,6302250277,"I hadn't seen Thelma and Louise in years. I had forgotten everything about it except the attempted rape. It's an okay film but I still don't get how it became such a big hit. I guess the star power of Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon made this film so popular. They definitely brought spark to their characters but other than that this movie is nothing special.

Thelma and Louise are two hometown best friends. Thelma is married to a car salesman, Darryl and Louise has a thuggish boyfriend named Jimmy. Other than that, we know hardly anything about these women. The movie begins with a tiny glimpse of their regular lives and then they are off on the open road for the entire film.

While at a truck stop bar Thelma meets a man, Harlen who tries to rape her in the parking lot. Louise shoots him and the two take off. From there Louise and Thelma spend their time in hotels, staying clear of the cops.

There are many familiar faces as supporting characters such as Michael Madsen, Brad Pitt and Harvey Keitel.

The only big problem I had with the film was Thelma's completely unrealistic and annoying behavior. Here she is almost raped and in the next scene she acts like nothing ever happened to her! It was so maddening to see how she behaved. And if that's not bad enough she even has an affair (after almost being raped)! Pathetic and pitiful. That is why it's so hard to take anything that happened in Thelma and Louise seriously. Thelma's actions were despicable and too unbelievable to even comprehend. A huge disservice to people who have dealt with that type of violence and abuse. Even Louise didn't seem realistic. She just shoots a man and her friend is almost raped and she seems to feel nothing. She is just as cold and heartless to Thelma as she could be. Granted Thelma didn't seem like a victim but still Louise could've shown some compassion for her friend. All you get is, ""Shut up, Thelma!"" Louise was very selfish. All she cared about was getting away, not helping Thelma.

People always hyped this up as the classic chick flick but to me it makes women look dumb and silly with the things they did. Thelma acts like a two year old and Louise acts like some gunslinger who is living in a fantasy world. Neither of them reacted with any sense. You'd never be able to make this film in today's world and not be criticized for the women acting so dumb.

Another thing about this movie is it looks very dated even for being made in 1990. It looks more like it was made in the early 70's. The quality of the film hasn't held up well at all.

If you haven't seen this film in all these years you probably never felt the need to. Whether you ever check it out is up to you but you're not missing much if you don't.",1325116800,6,2730,4.394059405940594

It's photography is stunning, the acting is nothing short of brillant; both Sarandon and Davis play so well off each other it's a wonder any director hasn't paired them up again.

The only issue I have with this movie, and it's no minor one, is the motivation Thelma (Geena Davis) has about getting with JD (Brad Pitt).  Yes, he's Brad Pitt, but she was essentially raped not 24 hours before so to me, it's not believable that she would willingly be intimate with another guy so quickly.  A rather small plot point, which I overlook, but it nags at me as being utterly unbelievable.

To add to the confusion, the user submitted images show both regular and special editions of the DVD.

So I guess I'll talk about the version I have - the non-special edition version. At least the version I got has some special features. Two commentary tracks. One by the director Ridley Scott, the other by Susan, Geena and writer  Callie Khouri. I was hoping for a bit more insight into the writing, but there was still great stories that they told. With my audio setup, I noticed that the left channel had both Geena and Susan's voices clear, but the right channel wasn't recording Susan Sarandon's voice. Turning up the volume I could hear here in the background, but her microphone most certainly was not coming through my right speaker.

The problem is the same for the writer. She is ONLY heard in the right channel, not at all in the left, not even at full volume.

Ridley Scott gives an awesome commentary track. The only downside there would be it sounds kind of echoey, like's he's in a big living room.

The film transfer looks fairly good however, there is some black space on the far left edge of the screen. I hope that doesn't mean the image was shifted to the right and some is cut off. My guess is that's the look of the full film space because that would be where the audio track would be placed on the film.

The deleted scenes are nice. They are isolated from the film and you can view them all at once or view them individually. They also play the footage that was kept in the final film at the beginning and end of the cut scene to give it context, very nice.

Maybe I love it because Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are just such everyday people who manage to come across as unique- simple yet complex at the same time. Geena Davis is so naiive and lovable, but you just want to scream at her at some parts of the movie because their fate could have been different if she'd only just learned from her mistakes. I love the feeling of the journey, symbolized by the vintage thunderbird car, the vast roads and expansive scenery; captured in the way their clothes and make-up go from prim and proper to very basic; in the way Daryll goes from mistreating Thelma throughout the movie to crying for her at the very end.

444272,4,6302250277,"In 1991, the American road movie, ""Thelma & Louise"" captured America's attention.

One for it's strong female lead characters starring Geena Davis (""Beetlejuice"", ""A League of Their Own"", ""Stuart Little"" films) as Thelma and Susan Sarandon (""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"", ""The Witches of Eastwick"", ""Bull Durham"") as Louise but also was heavily debated in American media about America's infatuation towards the movie and what detriment that such a movie can have on society.  But also as the film would have resonance towards viewers for women's independence and calling upon Hollywood that having strong female lead characters in a film does work and also can be a financial success.

Directed by Ridley Scott (""Bladerunner"". ""Alien"", ""Black Rain"") and written by Callie Khouri (""Mad Money"", ""Something to Talk About"", ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood""),""Thelma & Louise"" was a commercial success grossing over $45 million in the box office and received six Academy Award nominations, winning one for ""Best Original Screenplay"". The film would also be instrumental in launching the careers of Geena Davis, Brad Pitt and writer/director Callie Khouri.

In February 2011, ""Thelma & Louise"" will be celebrating its 20th Anniversary with a Blu-ray release courtesy of MGM/Twentieth Century Fox.

VIDEO:

""Thelma & Louise: 20th Anniversary"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (Widescreen 2:35:1) and to watch this film in HD was quite impressive.  The colors of the southwest to the Grand Canyon showcase its detail through this HD release.  Skies are blue, the Thunderbird's blue pops out, Thelma's died reddish brown hair pops and for the most part, the earth tones are what stick out in this film.  There is a good amount of grain and blacks are nice and deep and I detected no artifacting, DNR or edge enhancement at all.

Definitely a major upgrade visually compared to the 1997 and 2003 DVD release and fans of the film will definitely be pleased by the vibrant colors and detail seen in the 20th Anniversary release!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Thelma & Louise: 20th Anniversary"" is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and French 5.1 DTS.  While the film is primarily dialogue-driven and also featuring the musical score of Hans Zimmer and music which was appropriate for its time back in 1991, where you will hear the surround channels really picking up is during the final arc of the film when Thelma & Louise are on the run as they tend to use the guns even more and also featuring a pretty significant explosion which comes quite crystal clear through your surround channels.

During the bar room sequences, you do get some ambiance but for the most part, it's when the action sequences are employed, where you will hear the more immersive sounds of the film.  But it's important to note that while there is action, this is not an action film and the clear soundtrack is quite appropriate for ""Thelma & Louise"".

Subtitles are presented in English and English SDH.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Thelma & Louise: 20th Anniversary"" comes with the following special features (all presented in SD):

  * Commentary by Ridley Scott - An informative and pretty cool commentary by director Ridley Scott.  Scott provides the more technical details on how challenging the film was to make.
  * Commentary by Susan Sarandon, Geena Davis and Callie Khouri - A fun and casual audio commentary from writer Callie Khouri who explains what she wanted to accomplish through he screenplay and also talking with actresses Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis, who talk about their characters and the scenes that they shot.
  * Deleted and Extended Scenes - (40:19) Plenty of deleted and extended scenes are included.  Especially the longer sex scenes with Geena Davis and Brad Pitt.
  * Extended Ending (with Commentary by Ridley Scott) - (3:42) Featuring optional commentary,the ending that I'm glad wasn't used for the final cut of the film.
  * Documentaries and Featurettes, including ""Thelma and Louise: The Last Journey""- (59:43) An excellent documentary in which Callie Khouri talks about the anguish she felt about giving another director a chance to work on her script but how she and Ridley Scott worked great together.  Also, how the talent were cast for the film and how many of them were newcomers at the time, especially Brad Pitt.  Interesting is Pitt's comments on his first major sex scene and how Geena Davis helped him through it.  Also, talking about the action sequences and how the film became a major hit and also cause for debate in the media.
  * Original Theatrical Featurette (with and without promotional narration) - (5:23) An older featurette in which the director and cast are showcased.
  * Multi-Angle Storyboards: The Final Chase - There are two segments featured in this section.  One is the storyboards (4:38) and the other is a storyboard with a shot comparison (4:38).
  * ""Part of You, Part of Me"" Music Video by Glenn Frey - (4:28) Glenn Frey's music video for ""Part You, Part of Me"" for the film.
  * Trailer and TV Spots - Featuring the original theatrical trailer, a total of three TV spots and a home video preview.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Thelma & Louise"" continues to be an iconic film, 20 years later.

Although there have been a few films to have strong female leads, nothing has come close to matching or featuring the quality of the characters featured in ""Thelma & Louise"".  This story about two women who set out to have some fun via  two-day vacation and then everything goes wrong.  It's quite plausible and although the film has a good amount of humor, the film is ultimately a tragedy.

Two women who had normal lives but their lives are forever changed.  But during their moments together, it's the most freedom that they have ever lived and together, they intend to make their time together meaningful and to go out with a bang!

In some ways, one can watch a road film such as ""Easy Rider"", another tragic road film and capturing friendship to the last minute, the same can be said with ""Thelma & Louise"" but with strong female character leads, it was something that audiences have never seen before.  And I can see how the film would become an inspiration for women, not just for strong lead character roles in Hollywood but the fact that you have a film showcasing women choosing freedom, independence and to leave their banal lifestyle behind.  Granted, in this case, it was accidental and as some media have made a case over, these two women should be not considered as role-models.

But the connection this film makes is not about the crimes that were committed, it goes deeper than that.  As Tori Amos has credited the film for the inspiration of her song ""Me and a Gun"" (which is about Amos' rape), the film especially Thelma being victimized as a slave wife under the control of a domineering husband and then being assaulted by a man who hits her around as if she is deserving of it.  No woman deserves this treatment and Louise, who has suffered rape before, shows Louise the benefits of freedom, away from the controlling Darryl and that she should stand up for herself.  We witness this change of Thelma throughout the film and the friendship and bond between friends growing.

This is the emotional connect that I have felt ""Thelma & Louise"" has managed to resonate with many viewers, many women, because these two women are not going to take it anymore.  And while some feared at the time that women would do some acts of vengeance on the men or husbands that have wronged them, the truth is that ""Thelma & Louise"" provided a voice for many women who have kept quiet about rape or their poor treatment by a love one.  The movie was probably not meant or was expected to resonate so strongly but it did.

As for the film, the imagery of Thelma & Louise grabbing a gun and shooting them towards a tanker, is one of the wonderful images of the film, and of course the final scene has become quite iconic and still remembered two decades later.

""Thelma & Louise"" is a wonderful and magnificent film and definitely a highlight of movie screenplays courtesy of Callie Khouri and I felt that having Ridley Scott as the director, gave the film its necessary push to make it seem raw, real and visual for the audience.

And of course, the wonderful acting by Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis.  Both were extraordinary in this film and I've read that Michelle Pfeiffer and Melanie Griffith were originally considered for Thelma and Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton, Anjelica Huston were considered for Louise.  Personally, it's something I can't even fathom.  This was a well-cast film and Sarandon and Davis had wonderful screen chemistry and the two did a fantastic job!  And of course, for the Brad Pitt fans, this is the movie that literally launched his career.

As for the 20th anniversary Blu-ray release, first let me say that Twentieth Century Fox has done a great job with these re-releases to celebrate the anniversaries of ""Dancing with Wolves"" and ""Raging Bull"" and here we are with ""Thelma & Louise"" and while I do feel the release is fantastic when it comes to PQ and AQ, while it does have the awesome ""The Last Journey"" featurette, its still the same standard definition features that came on DVD before.  I just felt that for a 20th anniversary, it would have been great to revisit with Calli Khouri, Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis.  I suppose that the footage shot for its 10th anniversary would be enough for people but it would have been great to have something new to compliment the 20th anniversary Blu-ray release.

Overall, ""Thelma & Louise: 20th Anniversary"" is a welcomed upgrade from its previous 2003 DVD release.  The film looks and sounds magnificent in HD and the audio commentary and featurettes included are still informative and enjoyable today.  If you are a big fan of this film or if you are looking for a film on Blu-ray that is well-made, well-written and well-acted, you can't go wrong with ""Thelma & Louise"".

I found the first viewing so compelling that not only did I view the deleted scenes and alternate ending, over the next several days I also watched it through both commentaries, then the whole movie two more times again. Less than a hand full of times in my life have I ever even cared to watch a movie more than once.

One reason I avoided it for all these years is that I think I had always envisioned T&L as perhaps a modern female equivalent Butch Cassidy, et al, type of bad girl shoot-em-up, or maybe some anti-male, female rampage-to-the-end. It's not that at all. Two otherwise middle class, middle-of-the-road, fairly attractive, rather uptight, southern women in their late-thirties who are best friends decide to take a weekend vacation trip together, ostensibly to get a much needed break from their respective less-than-fulfilling relationships.

Before ever arriving at their destination, things start to go wrong, terribly wrong, with the resultant desperado flight into oblivion that is a direct result of 1) being female in a subtly but pervasively misogynistic society, 2) making poor, but crucial, decisions as events unfold, and 3) an underlying history that becomes alluded to along the way, directly resulting from 1) and contributing significantly to 2).

I found the film score quite fitting throughout, especially the instrumental segues and interludes, which added a moody, melancholy vibe. And visually, much of the cinematography was quite striking, especially as they neared The End. (The last part was shot in the Canyonlands of Utah I believe it was.)

I think what I really liked about it was how the two women metamorphosed from ""who they were"" to ""who they became"" in their short but epic journey.

That said, though I do see metaphors within the story that are worthy of contemplation, I don't think this is some ""feminist manifesto"" or that there is any hidden ""moral"" to the story, and I appreciate many of the points put forth in some of the negative reviews here. I simply found it highly entertaining fiction, as any good movie experience should be.

There are definite ""flaws."" (Hence, the four stars instead of five.) Some supporting rolls seemed a bit mis-cast (or, more accurately, grossly mis-acted). Periodically there are off-the-wall things going on in the background that just don't add up. There is at least one scene that simply wouldn't have happened in the ""real world,"" and at least one scene that seemed put in just to add comic relief. All of which gives it a quality that I find makes the whole thing a bit surreal. On the other hand, overall the ""flaws"" didn't bother me much, and in some respects the whole surreal quality added a little something that in its absence might've made T&L less than what it turned out to be.",1262217600,3,2844,4.865702479338843

Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are terrific as two lost souls trying to take control. At times bitter and angry, this is a feminist manifesto that forces the viewer to ride along on this fatalistic trip to the edge and beyond.

Ridley Scott's superb eye and confident direction give writer Callie Khouri's compact screenplay the emotional sheen it needs to keep the viewer aligned with the protagonists.

We think, if we could only love them, then everything will be OK.  We feel the damage and abuse they have suffered and are sympathetic to their dilemma. But it's too late. They have made up their minds to take us over the edge and it is horrible and beautiful.  Ahhh, sweet release.

No--friend pulls out a gun and shoots the guy who is no longer a threat to either of them.  Ok--temporary insanity--not really self-defense, but they can probably get away with calling it self-defense.  Instead, no, they run away.  During their ""trek"" Gina Davis becomes such an imbecile and so annoying the viewer almost wants to commit an act of violence against her.  (she sleeps with a stranger and then leaves him alone in a hotel room that happens to contain all of her best friend's money.)  Sarandon's character, by contrast, is smart and likable--smart, that is, at least until she decides to take a seven-hour detour around Texas because she does not want to be in a state where something traumatic once happened to her.  Okay, understandable, to a point--but no.  Someone who is fleeing for her life doesn't have time for that kind of sentimentality.  And she has her (albeit moronic) friend to think of too.  Anyway, between the two of them they make sure that there is absolutely no way they'll succeed, and sure enough they don't.

A feminist movie?  Are people kidding?  If I wanted to hate women, and think ""after all women are idiots"", I'd watch this movie.

And come on.  The ""women good, men bad"" business is a little old by now, don't you think?  The absurdity of the male stereotypes in this film is pathetic.

And finally, the story isn't even interesting.

I have been hearing cultural references to this film for years, and finally broke down to see it. I thought that it would be a silly female version of the buddy/road film. But I was mistaken. Eighteen years after its release, ""Thelma and Louise"" is still a powerful and comic indictment of the swinish side of the American male. Just about every guy in the T&L is a boor -- the loutish, self-centered husband, the non-committing, violence-prone boyfriend, the predatory rape-ready good ol' boy, the betraying hustler, the disrespectful, disgusting trucker and male-dominated law enforcement. Every stereotype of the underbelly of US masculinity is on parade and is deliciously dispatched by the unlikely heroines of the film. Thelma and Louise represent femininity looking for a little respect and freedom, and finding none, blazing a pushback trail through the American Southwest. T&L is very well acted (Geena Davis, Susan Sarandon, Harvey Keitel and Christopher MacDonald are standouts), fabulously written, and believable.

 Written by Callie Khourie, who recieved an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, ""Thelma and Louise"" tells the tale of two best friends who go to the mountains for a weekend getaway, but a stop at a roadside bar changes their plans and lives forever. Escaping the police, Thelma and Louise encounter many characters on their cross-country journey, as they head to Mexico and a new life. Heavily regarded as one of the best buddy films ever made, the film is really a woman's picture, telling the story of how women are just as good as men, and how men can be arrogant, pompous, and abusive toward their female counterparts.

 Brad Pitt had his first mainstream role in this, and both Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis received Oscar nods for their performances.

But above all else, it's a movie about two humans getting caught up in a maddening spiral of events that have taken on a life of their own - a perfect parable for what's happening all over the world, day in and day out. You set something in motion and from that moment on it's beyond your control.  Thelma and Louise's only ""triumph"" is their acknowledgment that they have done this to themselves.  They don't say so of course; but their final action says it for them.  In that sense, this movie bears some resemblance to one of my other nominees for greatest movie of all time - The Bridge on the River Kwai, wherein the Alec Guiness character finally realizes his great mistake; but realizes it too late to save himself.  Just like Thelma and Louise.",1230595200,6,1705,4.550819672131148
444310,1,6302250277,"To describe this movie as feminist is ridiculous. The female leads don't use their heads, operate on pure and unchecked emotion (mostly fear-based), seem to feel alive only when they're exhibiting the same level of violence that the cartoon-character-evil-men they cross paths with have exhibited towards them, and finally ""triumph"" by committing suicide, albeit in a ""romantic"" fashion by driving their convertible, top-down, over a cliff at the Grand Canyon while they clasp hands in hysterical ""sisterhood.""

Give me a f^%$#&^g break here, people. Feminisim is about responsibility every bit as much as it's about freedom. I don't know about your world, but in mine it's necessary to have a functioning brain, to be capable of rational thought and right action, to know when to ask for help and when to give it, and to be able to exercise some impulse control and deal effectively with unfair and sometimes even abusive treatment. Because it's not a perfect world. Not for men, and not for women. Deal.

OK, the movie seems to posit that these two - especially the Geena Davis character - are so incapacitated due to the abuse they've suffered that they're not capable of any of that. Gee, sounds like the excuse often given by male murderers and rapists for the horrible things they do. And it just doesn't wash.

Feminism does not equal intellectual vacuity and man-hating - although to accuse this film of man hating seems laughable. There are hardly any ""men"" in it, just stereotypes of men who exist merely to give the female leads an excuse to dig themselves an ever-deeper hole of violence and idiocy leading to suicide.

Yes, suicide. Death. That's triumph? That's a feminist statement? Not in my book.

This movie isn't man-hating because there aren't any men in it, only cartoon characters. But it IS woman-hating because it never even entertains the possibility that women who've been treated with violence and gross unfairness, women who've had their humanity stifled, might still truly triumph by undertaking the mostly interior, unglamorous fight for their own humanity and might truly win by living out life - yes, LIVING it out - on their own terms: creatively, lovingly, intelligenty, compassionately, productively, with self-awareness, as adults, in this imperfect world. That's real strength, and that's real feminism. The two-hour-long temper-tantrum the female leads in this movie engage in is not.

This movie panders to spoiled, gutless American women who enjoy their ""victim"" role and who refuse to do the work of taking responsibility for their own lives, as adults, in one of the richest countries on earth. I suggest these women go to a place like Somalia and see what the women there have to deal with daily, and then come back and see if they still see a self-indulgent, self-pitying, mindless movie like this one in quite the same way.",1228435200,31,2868,5.014705882352941

444332,5,6302250277,"It is impossible to defend everything Thelma and Louise did as events unraveled.  Never mind illegalities; some of their misdeeds were deliberate and just plain wrong.

However, I consistently wanted them to make it.  If Louise was not going to turn her back on Thelma, then neither was I.  Louise was the brains behind the outfit.  Thelma was naive and less-than-intelligent, and she cost Louise dearly many times.  No one could have blamed Louise for letting Thelma go in hopes that she (Lousie) could still make it.

Louise's love and friendship for Thelma turned out to be more fierce than her instinct for survival.  Who wouldn't want to be on their team?

Another compelling thing about this film is the go-for-broke mentality.  As their situations deteriorate, they start pushing boundaries and limits in ways that most of us never will.  It becomes impossible to look away.

If you have only ever watched this on cable, you should rent this film at least once to see the missing scene between the stranded desert cop and the Rastafarian.  It offers comic relief in a tale laced with desperation.  By the way, the cop was played by the actor that portrayed Demi Moore's boyfriend in GI Jane.

Michael Madsen (Virginia's brother) would have been tempting for a lot of us girls.  Hats off to Louise for realizing that to a large extent he was only pursuing her because he could feel her slipping away.

444335,5,6302250277,"If you can imagine a blend of ""9 to 5"", ""Smokey and the Bandit"" and ""Bonnie and Clyde"", you should come up with an approximation of ""Thelma and Louise"": a mix of adventure, humor and comrade in the style of the Burt Reynold's chase movies, and getting even with the stereotypical men who try to abuse, control or recapture these 2 women intent on a short escape from their boring lives. The possession of a pistol or two and daredevil driving enables them to silence or elude most of the males who try to abuse or capture them or just have some fun with them. Clearly, Louise and Thelma initially have very different attitudes toward the men who try to seduce them. Louise makes it loud and clear  she wants no part of these amorous come ons, whereas Thelma, especially after a few drinks, is often flirtaceous and sometimes willing. But, Thelma eventually learned that fooling around with strange persistent men
can have traumatic consequences, and joined Louise in rebuffing these advances. According to the DVD commentary, many in the audiences cheered and clapped when Thelma's would be rapist is shot dead by Louise for his continued obscene threating remarks in the aftermath of Louise's breakup of the rape attempt. This clearly confirms what we may conclude from the popularity of confrontational westerns and action movies: that lethal vigilante justice, when done in appropriate circumstances, is considered justified by the majority of people, regardless of what the legal system thinks and does.
  One gets the impression that even if this duo didn't face probable long prison sentences, they might have become permanent runaways from their unsatisfying routine lives. It is significant that neither had children, which may have alleviated some of their dissatisfaction, and which made their overblown girls night out gone bad practical. The fact that both these women were often foul-mouthed, smoked and occasionally went to seedy bars turns off some viewers, who label them brainless white trash who perhaps deserve some of the misadventures they suffered in their attempt to  have a short escape from their boring lives.
  Brad Pitt and Michael Madison provide two handsome hunks for female viewers to drool over, though very different. Brad represents the perfect con man who exploits naive vulnerable women both sexually and financially. He was the perfect bad boy for Thelma to find release in. Michael represents a man who isn't willing to settle down to a permanent one on one relationship, but who is willing to make occasional sacrifices for the women he has relationships with.
  The ending seems appropriate for the duo. Like Bonnie and Clyde, the pair eventually knew they were doomed to long prison sentences, or to die in a shootout, car accident or by their own device. Like Bonnie and Clyde, they were prepared to elude their pursuers as long as possible, and to engineer their deaths if capture seemed imminently certain.

Virginia Slims specifically marketed carcingenic tobacco products to millions of women by promising them ""you've come a long way, baby,"" but we really haven't come as far as we should have. Thelma and Louise illustrates that very point with fine accuracy and almost too-close-to-reality dialogue.

I was so enamored of this movie that I purchased it and then watched it with each of my three daughters. After the movie, we had a discussion about why this was such an important film. The ending of ""Thelma and Louise"" is unspeakably sad but it too makes a powerful point about the futility and frustration of a woman's lot, even in our modern times.

""Thelma & Louise"" is one of the finest movies I've ever seen. In terms of acting, pacing, writing, cinematography and soundtrack, it is perfect in all aspects. The two main characters could've easily been cliched 2-D cutout rip-offs of Bonnie & Clyde or Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid, but the script injects them with enough originality and depth to set them apart. This is also thanks to the the fantastic performances of the two leads, Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon, who put on tow of the finest performances in all of cinema. They are backed by a solid supporting cast including Michael Madsen and the incomparable Harvey Keitel, as well as early breakthrough role by Brad Pitt.

The plot could've also been one dimensional and uninteresting, but writer Callie Khouri again made ot sparkle with inventive sequences, a solid mix of action, laughter and drama, and crackling dialogue.

And the direction by cinematic auteur Ridley Scott is audacious. The last sequence is one of the most beauotful images in cinema, and it brought a bit of a tear to my eye.

The special edition of this film is a must for all its fans, and the film itself should eb seen by all true cinema buffs.",1172361600,5,1427,4.650793650793651
444356,2,6302250277,"I understand why this film got such wide acclaim.  Great acting, interesting storyline, great cinematography.  However, I found this film quite violent, bordering advocating violence as a means for letting out frustrations, suicide as glorious end, etc., that I couldn't condone.

If one were not looking for morals in this movie, it may be ok. And to a population that is desnsitized to violence, it is probably ok too. but if you're the sensible type, it may not be for you.

There were many occasions in the film where the lead female characters could have made the right choice, but they kept choosing the more and more destructive paths, and violence escalating.  I suppose one could use this film to see what *not* to do and to show what can drive certain people to destruction, but given the atmosphere of the movie, that is not what it conveyed to me.

Thus I give this movie high marks for technical aspects (acting, cinematography, directing, etc)., but average/mixed bag for story content.  I believe anyone who is not angry or hating the world and how it is treating them, or ones who are not looking for ""blow up everything in its path"" movie will squirm watching this movie, and possibly come out with ""interesting, but, ew..."" reaction.

There are 5 DVD versions of Thelma and Louise:

1. Orion edition - the first release of the film, it was in a snapper case by Orion Pictures.  It's been Out of Print for quite some time.

2. MGM first edition - essentially the Orion disc, but in the first MGM case (with the blue sky background and the snapshot of T&L)

3. MGM Special Edition (with slipcover) - a flipper disc with the special features, the slipcover is different from the regular cover art.

4. MGM Special Edition (without slipcover) - same as #3, sans slipcover.  It's still a flipper disc.

5. MGM standard edition - Essentially the first MGM edition, except with the new transfer used on the special edition, and it's not a flipper (so you don't get the documentaries, trailers, music video, or storyboards).  The coverart is exactly like the MGM special edition (without slipcover), though there is no ""Special Edition"" banner.

MGM's DVD factories or wherever they make their DVDs sometimes mess up and put the Special Edition cover art in cases with the standard edition.

To always make sure you get the actual special edition, make sure it comes with the cardboard slipcover.  Because 9 times out of 10, if you pick up one that says Special Edition and it's a single-sided disc, you got the standard edition with the wrong cover art.

Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis gave tour de force performances as they embodied their roles perfectly. It's hard to tell which one gave the better performance there are times that I think Sarandon is better and there are times that I think Davis is better. I guess it just means that repeated viewings make you see important details of their acting.

I always regard the ending of the movie as one of the best and one of the most memorable (together with Seven, Casablanca, Butch Cassidy to name a few).

444379,3,6302250277,"This modern flip on Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is an entertaining thrill ride through the American southwest. Thelma and Louise's escapades were quite liberating for them, as they were two women held down by typical society's constraints. Both women were trapped in their lives as a housewife and a waitress, who had nowhere to go. They had never lived a life of much excitement, especially Thelma with her overprotective husband. The two women start their liberation small, with Thelma not telling her husband she'll be gone for the weekend and the end with things like murder and armed robbery. The film is a great example of how women are equally capable of anything men can do. In this case it just happens to be violent crime, something that men are much more associated with.

 Many have argued that the film is not actually liberating to women, because of all the male chauvinist elements of the film. Elements like condescending down talk towards the women and how the men seemingly win in the end (they don't get to Mexico, etc.). In my opinion all of these elements actually contribute to the film be liberating to women. How the women are talked about and treated in the film actually works in their favor, because in the end they do things on their terms, not the men's. For example the women don't get to Mexico, but they aren't captured either. They go out on their terms, by driving off the cliff. Another example is how they are constantly referred to as `girls' by the police, portray the police's opinion of them as very lowly and not dangerous. When in fact they prove to be quite dangerous and capable it makes the police seem stupid, because they underestimated them.

444403,1,6302250277,"I FINALLY watched this to see why this movie caused so much commotion. Well, perhaps it was because it was the first time women were portrayed as being equally moronic as men in the cinema  but to call this a ""feminist"" movie should make the feminists complain even louder than they already do. Susan Sarandon (who somehow always remains brilliant in any role in spite of her radical anti-American politics) does her best to salvage this mess... and mental myopic Geena Davis (one of the world's worst actresses) mostly plays herself (a ditzy, chicken-brained, witless, woozy for sure). In addition to the heavy-handed, rampant, anti-male bashing throughout this film, these woman are also portrayed as poor, woe-is-me victims from the start.

Who could have any sympathy for these imbecilic, confused, blundering women?  Life ""happened"" to them... in their foggy confused stupor of an existence... and suddenly they take charge and are alive and empowered only after crossing the line into being murderers, fugitives and gun-toting criminals?  Not even elementary good drama here, folks. They never grow, learn or transform... but just change from dumb victims to dumber outlaws.

If this is what people consider a ""cult classic,"" I would be tempted to ask of which cult they are a member.

The best moment of the film was the ending. Truthfully, I was deeply relieved and amused when it was finally over and couldn't wait for them to drive off the cliff and save the gene pool for future generations.",1106956800,24,1502,5.0120481927710845

This is one great buddy film, and not just for women.  These two characters are great.  They are full characters and real women.  Susan Sarandon should have won for this role.  It was a very complex character and not everyone could have pulled it off.  Again, the director is Ridley Scott.  He is a master.

There were too many missteps such as the troglodyte truck driver who seems unable to do anything more than grunt and spew obscenities.

444408,4,6302250277,"This is one of those movies that you can watch with your best girl friend, with the alcohol flowing, or you can have a quiet night in with your best guy, as long as he doesn't go on about the fact Brad Pitt is in this, and yes ladies, he does get his top off. Easy on the eyes, but the accents (or Southern drawls) will get slightly on your nerves!

Yet again, I seem to be on a roll, and having a mad time reviewing films that have a common theme in them - there's lots of driving! And I still can't figure out the stunt drivers and all that kinda nonsense! A total of five identical 1966 Thunderbird convertibles were used throughout the shoot: one 'star car', one camera car, one back-up car, and two stunt cars.

Susan Sarandon & Geena Davis make a great double act in this movie, with Susan acting more of the mother hen during some scenes, but sometimes it can swap over. And then they have a good girlie time.

There's quite a few funny scenes in this movie, and they're laugh a minute. The sequence where Darryl slips and falls over on the builder's supplies as he is leaving for work was unscripted, as Christopher McDonald genuinely lost his footing. Despite this he remained in character (how hard must that have been?! I would have fallen about laughing), yelling at the workmen as he got into the car and drove away. Ridley Scott apparently liked the result, and so it remains in the film. In the scene where the tanker truck is shot and blown up, the reactions of Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis were supposed to be genuine. Rather than filming separate reaction shots, director Ridley Scott rigged the tanker to blow up during the take, in order to get authentic expressions of surprise from the two leads. Despite this, they were so astonished while watching it that they forgot to actually react, so Scott had to film their reactions again.

For guys who are likely to start muttering about how Brad Pitt gets his top off in this movie, chill. I must be the only female in the world who doesn't think he's that terrific looking. He's easy on the eye, but not my type I'm afraid ladies. Give me Keanu Reeves over Braddy anyday! The problem with Brad is he looks like he would spend more time in the bathroom than me - except when he had that godawful beard that is! Brad leaves a strong impression as the charismatic blonde thief J.D. It's easy to see why this film made him a star. And what about the rest of the male actors? Harvey Keitel is charming as the sympathetic lawman, Hal, and Michael Madsen's turn as Louise's boyfriend Jimmy is wonderfully nuanced.

The rape scene - he doesn't end up raping Thelma, but you know what I mean - is very graphic in some scenes, with close ups of panties and Thelma getting slapped about, it makes me quite teary.

I enjoyed seeing the American countryside along the journey. From the dusty roads in the desert, the mountains and open paddocks, to the bars, hotels and roadside stops. It really gives a true feel of what the American rural areas are like. There's one scene filmed at night, where it's just them on an empty road, and it's breathtakingly beautiful. A scene to be seen - if you get my drift.

This special edition has loads of cool looking, but dull extras. Your bog standard extras basically. I was really looking forward to the alternative ending with commentary (love these things), but it disappointed me. For anyone with a tiny bit of an imagination could have imagined that they might have survived the fall. I always think that. The rest of the extras include: commentary by Ridley Scott; commentary by Susan Sarandon, Geena Davis and screenwriter Callie Khouri; ""Thelma & Louise: The Last Journey"": a 2001 three-part documentary (conception & casting, production & performance, reaction & resonance) featuring new interviews with Susan Sarandon, Geena Davis, Michael Madsen, Brad Pitt, director Ridley Scott, and writer Callie Khouri; featurette; deleted and extended scenes; ""The Final Chase"" multi-angle storyboards; and ""Part of Me, Part of You"" music video.

This film will probably in a few years be considered a classic if it isn't already. A must have for your collections. Just don't decide to go driving after watching. You never know who you might come across, or what you might do...",1099094400,3,4276,4.617105263157895

Thelma agrees to go away for a long weekend in the mountains with Louise, but only after giving her over-bearing husband Darryl (Christopher McDonald) the slip.  After driving for a while, the girls stop at a roadside nightclub.  Here, Thelma is hit upon by Harlan, a scummy local who tries to attract as many women as he can.  After several drinks, Thelma begins to feel sick and decides to go outside.  Harlan follows her and tries to force himself on her, but Louise and her trusty .38 intervene on Thelma's behalf.

What happens next is a cross-country flight across the American Southwest with Hal, (Harvey Keitel) , a determined detective, hot on their trail.  Along the way, The girls meet J.D. played by a young Brad Pitt.  He claims to be a student hitch-hiking his way back to school, but in reality, he is a convicted thief on parole.  Thelma, suffering from lack of attention in her marriage, soon falls for J.D., but J.D. is only interested in the $6,700 dollars that Louise's boyfriend Jimmy had sent to her by Western Union.  Soon, the girls are left without any money and are forced to turn to thievery to survive.

I thought this was a very good film.  Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are teriffic in their roles, and Brad Pitt and Harvey Keitel give good performances as well.  There are some good scenes in the movie, such as the gas truck exploding after being shot by Louise, and the State Trooper sequence is funny as well.

If you put the sexual politics aside, what you have is a story of two human beings who have spent their whole lives being oppressed and controlled by other people. Louise (Sarandon) is a waitress with a tragic past and an unreliable boyfriend. Thelma is a housewife with an arrogant, controlling husband. The two decide to embark on an impromptu vacation, but while stopping for a couple of drinks at a redneck nightclub, Thelma is almost raped by a lecherous customer, and Louise shoots and kills him in the parking lot. Instead of going to the police, the two decide to skip the country and head to Mexico, but a string of unfortunate events forces the two to commit even more crimes, turning them into bona fide fugitives and outlaws.
Strangely, what the two characters discover is that their new lives as outlaws are more satisfying than the stifled lives they led before. At the end of the film, the two make a choice to remain free and never surrender, despite the consequences.

It is the story of two friends living in Arkansas, both discontent with their current situation, who find themselves in more trouble than they bargain for while just trying to get away for a weekend of fun.  Their first stop at a night club on their way is where the trouble begins.  After having a few drinks Thelma (Davis) loosens up a little too much and her flirtatious behavior gains the attention of Harlan (Timothy Carhart), who is interested in more than just dancing.  When Louise (Sarandon) finds things getting out of hand in the parking lot she instinctively tries to protect Thelma and winds up shooting and killing Harlan.  Scared and not trusting that the police would believe their story, the two women take off.  After some consideration, Louise decides that their best bet is to head for Mexico.  Encounters with a handsome young drifter (Brad Pitt), an unsuspecting state trooper (Jason Beghe), and an offensive truck driver (Marco St. John), all trigger reactions that contribute to a crime spree which takes on a snowball effect.  Although all of their choices may not be the wisest, it is still amazing to see the depths that each woman is willing to go to in the name of friendship.  Watch as these two women transform from scared fugitives to defiant outlaws.

This Oscar-winning film takes audiences on a journey into a road trip that takes an unplanned turn.  Once Thelma (Geena Davis) has a close encounter with a rapist, their lives change forever.  After Louise (Susan Sarandon) kills the rapist, the action starts and never stops until the film's end.  The plot was written brilliantly.  They combine comedy, drama, and action wonderfully.  Their run from the law offers audiences many twists and turns as they encounter unpleasant visiters.  The intensity keeps audiences guessing their next move in every scene.  Only one other fugitive film comes close to the quality of ""Thelma And Louise"": ""Bonnie And Clyde"".  However, no other film released before, during, and after matches the uniqueness.  Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon add their own sense of theme in their Oscar-nominated roles for Best Actress.  Their words and emotions are flawless from their Texas accent to their intense life struggles.  All other actors perform their roles beautifully, including the then-unknown Brad Pitt.  ""Thelma And Louise"" is a great film for those looking for a great action drama.

444435,5,6302250277,"the special edition dvd from mgm is great, a lot of work has gone into it and it shows! the movie itself is just as amazing nowadays as it was back in 1991 and the screenplay continues to be a landmark, insofar as it was the main movie we studied at screenwriting class when i took film at university.
there are two commentary tracks on the dvd, one with ridley scott which is very informative regarding the technical side of directing the movie (and even talks a lot about his previous movies, especially blade runner), and the second track features susan sarandon and geena davis together with screenwriter callie khouri. this track is a combination of the three sitting together and monologues of the three regarding their aspect in the filmmaking process. khouri does go on and on about her script (deservedly so) though the real jem here is geena davis who is just so funny to listen to, it's like watching the movie together with her, and her chemistry with sarandon is great.
the deleted scenes are great fun to watch though inconsequential to the plot (therefore they were deleted) and the famous alternate ending which we've all heard so much about is finally presented in all its glory, though safe to say scott made the right decision by choosing the ending in the film itself. scott also has a commentary for the 3.5 minute long alternate ending.
the documentary is thorough and is extremely well produced (especially the way it introduces the brad pitt section, who made his film dbut on thelma & louise) and the music video for the forgettable theme by glenn frey is also present, as well as a storyboard for the final chase scene, which is about as exciting as storyboards get (they're not). there are also a few (horrible) trailers for the movie and a look into how the movie was marketed back in the day, really interesting actually.
ridley is a great director and this is another in his long run of fabulous movies (i ever like 'legend' a lot!) and the dvd is a top-notch production from mgm! it's a flipper with the movie on one side of the dvd and most of the extras on the other side, a great mgm idea that's more practical than 2-dvd sets. highly recommended! now all that's left to do is release a cd of the entire amazing film score by hans zimmer.",1080432000,,2272,4.557457212713937
444436,5,6302250277,"A film by Ridley Scott
One thing that I have never understood is that ""Thelma and Louise"" has been marked as this huge feminist movie (which happens to be directed by a man) that is taking aim at men and shows them all as pigs.  I don't get it.  On one hand this is a comedy (a lot of things are funny in this movie).  On another hand, ""Thelma and Louise"" is a western that has a car instead of a horse, and two women rather than two men.  It is a buddy movie, and a road movie.  Most importantly, this film is a tragedy (with all that a tragedy entails).  I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone who has not yet seen the movie, but considering the journey that these women go on and how it concludes, I don't see how it can be viewed as this feminist male-bashing movie.
Thelma (Geena Davis) and Louise (Susan Sarandon) need a vacation away from their men.  Louise just needs some time away from Jimmy (Michael Madsen) and Thelma is in a fairly miserable marriage where she is emotionally abused by her husband Darryl (Christopher McDonald).  Thelma leaves without telling Darryl, which she believes will get her in trouble when she comes back.  Thelma and Louise are off to a cabin owned by Louise's boss and they are going to have some fun (and for Thelma, this is a change).  On the way to the cabin they stop at a roadside bar to have a couple of drinks and dance.  Thelma dances with a guy who seems to be very sweet, but when she gets drunk he helps her outside and tries to rape her.  Louise comes out in time to stop the rape, but ends up shooting and killing the man.  Rather than go to the police, they go on the run not thinking that the police would believe their version of what happened (many witnesses would have seen Thelma and Harlan dancing cheek to cheek).
This begins what is really the heart of the movie: the women on the run.  Some have said that having the two women end up on such a crime spree (from the murder to armed robbery) is glorifying the crimes and celebrating the women, but I disagree.  We have to look at why Thelma and Louise did what they did and what happens to them because of those actions.  There is no celebration here.  Yes, there is release and a sense of freedom for the two women, but there is also resignation.  They did their best to get out of a bad situation but they were never able to get their lives back on track and while Thelma is finally having ""fun"", she also says late in the movie that ""something snapped inside me and I can never go back"".  This is tragedy.
Men do not come off as poorly in this movie as some critics have said.  Yes, Harlan the rapist is a horrible man, and he got his just reward.  Thelma is married to a real dirt bag of a man.  J.D. (Brad Pitt) is a mixed character.  He is smooth and charming, but ends up being a thief.  Yet, he is still a likeable and mostly sympathetic character.  To move to the other end of the spectrum, Louise's boyfriend Jimmy is an entirely positive male character.  So is Hal (Harvey Keitel), the FBI agent who is trying to bring Thelma and Louise in alive and as easily as possible.  He is trying to protect these women as well as apprehend them, but even Hal can see things spiraling out of control.
""Thelma and Louise"" is a very good movie made by a talented cast of people.  Geena Davis (The Accidental Tourist) and Susan Sarandon (Dead Man Walking) are both Oscar winners, and Ridley Scott is a three time nominee for Best Director (Thelma and Louise, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down).  Callie Khouri's screenplay did win the Oscar for this movie, and both Davis and Sarandon were nominated for Best Actress in this film.  There is a strong Oscar pedigree here and it shows in the movie.  It is a well told story of two women who in their attempt to break free from their lives end up going too far and become fugitives.  While there may be a celebratory feel to this movie, I believe that would be a misinterpretation of ""Thelma and Louise"".  It is an often comedic tragedy and simply is an excellent movie from start to finish.",1078704000,13,4047,4.2898550724637685
444437,5,6302250277,"This iconic movie starring Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis in the title roles is definitely NOT a chick flick - or if it is, then I don't understand what that term means. Thelma and Louise is nothing less than one of the great movies of the 1990s. Louise is a smart-mouthed waitress fed up with men, and Thelma is a doormat who SHOULD be fed up with men. With minimal planning or forethought, they hit the road - and, following a nasty event at a bar that results in near rape and real murder, they descend into the world of fugitives, running from the law in Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. Brad Pitt puts in a super-memorable performance as a lowlife drifter who takes advantage of them in the usual ways. And Harvey Keitel plays a cop with a conscience, another memorable role for a great actor.
The most thought-provoking part of the movie is watching the evolution of docile and fearful Thelma into a Strong Woman (capitals intended). The final scene as the law closes in, they lock eyes, and gun the engine, makes viewers cringe and say, ""No, no, no, pleeese...,"" but there is no other way this movie could have concluded.

444465,5,6302250277,"I can only repeat the great things already written about this film -- but on another level, THELMA & LOUISE probably changed the very face of movies, and its influence remains today.
How, you may ask?  Through one scene and one scene alone, the definition of male sexuality in American cinema was forever changed.  It also made Brad Pitt a major Hollywood star.
I'm talking about the scene in the lonely hotel room where Pitt took off his shirt for Geena Davis, revealing six-pack abs, well-defined shoulders, a muscular chest and nary an ounce of fat to be seen.  Brad Pitt took off his shirt and the women of America lost their collective minds.  The reaction in movie theatres to that scene was so visceral that every Hollywood leading man since has learned the potential value of hitting the weight room to ""pump up"".
Think about it.  Today, a movie producer wouldn't dream of casting a leading man who wasn't at least in top physical condition, and preferably with a killer bod to boot.  Before THELMA & LOUISE, a good male hardbody was a luxury in movies, and it usually manifested itself in action movies -- think Schwarzenegger or Van Damme. Today, a Hollywood male actor has zero chance of being considered ""sexy"" unless he's got that Brad Pitt bod that America first saw in THELMA & LOUISE.",1044316800,6,1300,4.6798245614035086
444466,5,6302250277,"A superb road movie with a difference! Director Ridley Scott shrewdly puts himself in the women's driving seat and depicts a tale of two longstanding friends who go on a weekend spree to escape their usual, monotonous small-town routines. What they have in common is both are dissatisfied with their respective partners. However what is intended as a wild holiday turns into a nightmare. Thelma (Geena Davis) and Louise (Susan Sarandon) hit a nightclub on their first night of freedom. Louise catches the eye of a man who at the end of the night trys to rape her. Catching him just as he is about to proceed with his vicious attack, Louise shoots the man. They are then plunged into a series of adventures as they head towards Mexico, dodging the police and intending to begin a new life. It is subsequently revealed that Louise herself was raped some years before which explained why she hastily shot the would-be rapist. Brad Pitt also stars in one of his earliest apperances playing J D, where Thelma quickly succumbs to his somewhat cocky charm. The film actually seemed to be a watershed for both Michael Marsden and Harvey Kietel who both went to bigger things (including starring together in 1992's masterpiece Reservoir Dogs). Both their performances are effective in this with Marsden playing Louise's long-standing partner and Harvey Kietel as the understanding detective who is hot on their trail though surprisingly displays a lot of empathy for the fugitives situation. As the film neatly unfolds it seems to steer along the voyage of self-discovery. The rich dialogue is complimented by superb, highly effective and concentrated performances from both the versatile Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis. The ending is sure to leave a lump in your throat! There are also some magnificent, eye-catching shots of the Grand Canyon captured along the way. The soundtrack is equally enthralling including tracks from the likes of soul superstars such as The Temptations and Martha Reeves and all add to the effect of this classic masterpiece. Certainly one of the best road movies made after the fantastic Bonnie And Clyde! Whilst there are some great laughs to endure along the way, Thelma And Louise on the whole stands as a compelling and riveting drama.",1038009600,3,2259,4.994694960212201
444467,5,6302250277,"Before I say anything else: Thelma & Louise is not a male bashing, anti feminist film. If you see it as that you are sadly identifying with the wrong characters! It's a thrilling tale full of life affirming energy and the two leads each deserved twenty Oscars each! On a par with Toys as my favourite film ... and I'm male! This is an alternatively powerful, harrowing and hilarious slice of 90's cinema that ranks among one of the best films ever made.
MGM released Thelma & Louise early in 2001, for a fairly early disc, it carried a strong line up of special features, which happily have found their way on to this SE re-release. The original release had a damn shoddy print quality, as MPEG encoders had still not quite been perfected yet, and the Dolby Digital 5.1 was all over the place!
Not now! The film has been stunningly remastered into anamorphic widescreen, and looks like it could have been made six months ago. The soundtrack also benefits extensively from a good cleaning up, still remaining in the standard 5.1, it has an enormous presence now. It is quite incredible that MGM have managed to house a 2 hour film plus well over two hours of extras on a single 9GB disc ...
The most rewarding extra feature on the disc is the new hour long retrospective made in 2000. It features almost all of the principle cast and behind the scenes characters, and is cleverly broken down into five sections: Conception, Casting, Production, Reaction, and the final section is devoted to the cast and crew looking back on one of the most brilliant pieces of cinema ever to grace the world, all looking understandably pleased to have been involved.
Elsewhere, you can enjoy two audio commentaries, one featuring director Ridley Scott (very rewarding and a good deal of technical information and insights into how difficult it was to get a ground breaking film like this made) and a second featuring Susan Sarrandon, Geena Davies and screenwriter Callie Khouri. This is a more chatty and funny track, but Khouri keeps the two witty cast engaged in conversation relevant to the film, not stopping a few hilarious outbursts along the way. The deleted scenes are very interesting to watch, and it is (for a majority of them) a good thing these were cut, they wouldn't really add anything.
A more controversial extra is the much hyped alternate ending. Extended is really a better word, showing T&L's '66 Thunderbird falling at an awkward angle over the cliff, somehow ruining the whole effect that the two girls had just launched themselves into freedom. The are also some very good storyboard sequences, startingly similar to the actual shots in the film and a collection of theatrical trailers and home video previews.
Please avoid the music video however, it is shocking 80's cheese and disturbing to think it was only 12 years ago!
All in all, MGM has done a fantastic job and put a lot of thought into creating this Special Edition, and if you already own the 2001 version, for God's sake go buy it anyway!",1037491200,59,3008,4.720532319391635
444468,5,6302250277,"Perhaps I am a bit behind the times, but I recently viewed 'Thelma and Louise' for the first time.  At first I was skeptical that the movie would live up to all the positive stories I heard about it years ago when it was released.  After watching the entire movie I am happy to admit that I was wrong to be so pessimistic.
'Thelma and Louise' is a brilliant look at the way our lives are affected by the decisions we make and it offers an insightful glimpse into the way many women think.  Although I cannot relate totally to either of these women, virtually every woman I know has personality attributes similar to these characters.  Their accidental adventures and traumatic experiences portray a magnificent connection between cause and effect.
True friendship is what holds this entire movie together and it is easy to see why both these women were nominated for Academy Awards.  I may have been skeptical at first, but I found myself rooting for these women and considering what I would do in similar situations.  While I cannot imagine ever going to such extremes, this movie presents a valuable lesson in learning how to cope with the problems life throws your way.",1036108800,3,1172,4.692682926829268
444469,5,6302250277,"I have a problem with some people who think that, because the two main characters of the film do technically illegal things, this makes them bad people, and therefore this is a bad movie.  Especially when there are those that seem to treat them as heroes. While they are not heroes, and I can't argue with many things the naysayers say, my opinion is that this is still one terrific movie.
The story of how two women go on a short-lived crime spree made a big stink when it was released in 1991.  How a housewife in a dead-end marriage, and a waitress in a dead-end job get pushed far enough to strike back was written about as a triumph of the feminist agenda and a strike back at the male-dominated world.  I also disagree with this other extreme point of view.  Every crime the ladies commit should have, in my opinion, been punished with some jail time.
But that old argument aside, there are other things that make the movie well worth seeing.  First, is the magnificent scenery.  I've made the drive from Illinois back and forth to Las Vegas many times, but have always taken the fastest highways.  As they try to make their escape by going down side roads AND avoiding Texas to get to Mexico, you get some breathtaking scenery that doesn't involve a Stuckey's or pecan logs.
Then there is the acting.  The males are good, especially Christopher McDonald who wants Thelma as a wife of his molding, but only if it doesn't take too much time from his TV football games.  But Geena Davis plays Thelma brilliantly when you see the thrills she experiences on their little adventure.  While maybe not the best way to solve her problems, you can see that this is a woman who's been needing a good time for a very long time.
But the cake goes to Susan Sarandon on this one.  Yes, she was premature in committing the first crime, but you can see that something from her past has finally been released at this point.  Not all at once, though.  The movie never really tells us her secret, but you can see it still simmering throughout the movie.  Next time you watch it, catch all the times she makes eye contact with old people on the road.  She holds this gaze for awhile, as if wondering if she will ever reach that stage, and if she wants to at all.  I believe these thoughts play a big part in their final decision.",1028678400,3,2315,4.411764705882353
444470,1,6302250277,"When this movie was released in 1991, a storm of controversy arose due to the film's glamorizing senseless violence, but, I didn't see the film for myself until 1993.  At that time I was in a state of post-tramautic stress (I was a victim of a natural disaster the year before) and vulnerable, and the idea of the movie swept me off my feet - and on the road.  After watching a tape of the movie a number of times I decided that I too would head out onto the open highway - the worse place for me at the time.  My plans went, in certain ways, as awry as they did in the film (without the violence, however), but it all ended when I ended up in a hotel room, broke and alone, and on the verge of ending up in jail.
As far as the tragic ending of the film, well, by 1995 I was back on my feet, somewhat, and working again, somewhat, when someone at my job (a woman about Thelma's age), like Thelma, committed suicide.  Unlike the movie, the despair of those she worked with, including me, was only beginning.  As I get older I've realized that God does not like this ending, at all - no one is supposed to determine their own ending to life, though I thought about it once or twice during my time on the road.
The point is, beware of this film - like many things in this life, what appears harmless ends up being a wolf in sheep's clothing.

444485,4,6302250277,"This is an important commercial film aimed at blue collar women who feel victimized by both society and the men in their lives.  Directed by Ridley Scott, who directed the science fiction classics, Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982), Thelma and Louise is an on-the-lam chick flick (with chase scenes), a kind of femme Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), somewhat akin to Wild at Heart (1990) and Natural Born Killers (1994) but without the gratuitous violence of those films.  Ridley Scott walks the razor edge between femme-exploitation and serious social commentary.  Incidentally, the script is by Callie Khouri who wrote Something to Talk About (1995) and Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood (2002) which should give you an idea of how men are depicted here.
Susan Sarandon is Louise, a thirty-something Arkansas waitress with an attitude and some emotional baggage, and Geena Davis is Thelma, a cloistered ingenue housewife with a yearning to breath free.  Both do an outstanding job and carry the film from beginning to end.  The characters they play are well-rounded and fully developed and sympathetic, in contrast to the men in the film who are for the most part merely clichs, or in the case of Darryl (Christopher McDonald), Thelma's boorish husband, or the troll-like truck driver, burlesques.
I have never seen Geena Davis better.  Her unique style is melded very well into a naive woman who never had a chance to express herself, but goes hog wild and seems a natural at it when the time comes.  Sarandon is also at the top of her game and plays the crusty, worldly wise, vulnerable Louise with tenderness and understanding.  Note, by the way, her pinned up in back hair-style, directly lifted from TV's Polly Holliday (""Kiss my grits!"") who appeared as a waitress in the seventies sitcoms ""Alice"" and ""Flo.""
Harvey Keitel plays the almost sympathetic cop, Hal Slocumb, and Brad Pitt appears as J. D., a sweet-talking twenty-something who gives Thelma the script for robbing 7-11s as he steals more than her libido.
This movie works because it is funny and sad by turns and expresses the yearning we all have to be free of the restraints of society and its institutions (symbolized in the wide-open spaces of the American Southwest) while representing the on again, off again incompatibility of the male and female heart.  The male-bashing is done with a touch of humor and the targets are richly deserving of what they get.  The ending is perhaps too theatrical and frankly unrealistic, but opinions may differ.
Best and most telling quick scene is when Thelma phones Darryl to see if he has found out about their escapades.  Weasel-like, he is trying to help the cops locate them, but he is so transparent to her that all she has to do is hear his voice.  ""He knows,"" she says to Louise and hangs up.
Best visual is when the black police helicopter appears suddenly, menacingly like a giant fly beneath the horizon of the Grand Canyon.  Also excellent were the all those squad cars lined up like armored battalions aimed at the girls on the run.
I also liked the scenes at the motel with J.D. and Louise's boyfriend.  They were beautifully directed and cut, and very well conveyed by Sarandon and Davis, depicting two contrasting stages in male-female relationships.
See this for Geena Davis because she was brilliant, vividly alive and never looked better.",1023494400,72,3385,4.895104895104895
444486,5,6302250277,"Thelma & Louise is one of those unfortunately all too rare movie gems which really engages the viewer. Watch it with a good friend and you'll find yourselves energised by the zest for life displayed by Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon in their stand out performances. Like Thelma and Louise, you'll want to ditch your jobs for the weekend and beg, borrow or steal a classic convertible car, before setting off on a road trip adventure along the USA's dusty mid-western highways.
The premise of the film is simple - put two ordinary people in an extraordinary situation and watch what happens as events start to snowball. Davis's bored housewife and Sarandon's diner-waitress are typical of thousands of women the world over. A chance encounter on the way to a run-of-the-mill weekend holiday in the mountains starts a chain of happenstance that thrusts the two friends into a situation where there are no signposts and no rules.
Thelma & Louise is often classified as a 'chick flick', but this is perhaps somewhat misleading. Certainly it is true that this is a film about two women, and the men in the story are shown as ineffectual or lacking in understanding (although watch for an entertaining appearance by Brad Pitt in what is regarded as his breakthrough role). However one of the main themes dealt with is the emotive and perennially grey area surrounding attempted rape and how the reporting of it is dealt with - this is clearly not the fluff and insubstantiality usually associated with chick flicks. Despite this and despite the outcome of the film (which on one level could be viewed as tragic), the brilliant and insightful cinematography of Ridley Scott leaves the viewer upbeat and with a tremendous sense of freedom.",1023062400,2,1731,4.891156462585034
444487,4,6302250277,"When I mentioned to someone that I watched this film.  They said ""Dude, it's a girl-film.""  I told him ""It was funny though, and I liked it.""  I can see why people might think of this film that way though.  But that would be missing the point of the film I think.
Thelma and Louise are supposed to be going off on a vacation, but a pit stop at a bar leads to a murder.  They decide to run as far and as fast away as possible.  Along the way, they make several mistakes that made it tougher and tougher for them to escape from the law.  But they sure as hell tried till the very end anyways.
I liked it because I'm tired of seeing bad guys being just that -- bad ""guys"".  With Thelma and Louise, you're not sure whether to like them or pity them.  They're not evil ""bad"".  They're what I would even consider ""naughty"".

============================

444488,5,6302250277,"Is there anything more satisfying then a romantic, funny, action-packed, well scripted AND well acted movie? Perhaps, but after watching ""Thelma and Louise"" I certainly have my doubts. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis star in this highly entertaining, truly heartfelt movie. When one begins this film, you immediately feel the need to choose a ""favorite"" between the two characters, Thelma or Louise. It is impossible. You can masquerade that you like Thelma more, or that Louise tickles your fancy...but the truth is that both characters are immediately likeable and hard not to love.
The basic plot: Thelma and Louise go on a seemingly weekend long roadtrip as a brief escape from their drab, unexciting lives. Their first night out, Thelma has a terrifying experience...Louise, in her efforts to save her, commits a major crime. Suddenly, they are no longer two pals going on a trip...they are fugitives running for their freedom and from the law. As the story progresses, their list of crimes grows longer, and their chances at reaching their destination seem to get slimmer as they get closer to it.
A thrilling romp through the southwest, with beautiful acting, writing and cinematography, this movie is a classic ""buddy movie"", ""road movie"" and ""chick flick"". Whatever label it is given, it is one of the best of its kind.",1021161600,7,1327,5.036363636363636
444489,4,6302250277,"THELMA AND LOUISE is a great movie about two women who set out on a weekend vacation, but end up becoming two fugitives on the run across the American southwest. The acting is wonderful. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis have never had finer performances and the supporting ""male"" cast does just as fine a job (not only was this the film that made Brad Pitt a star, this also was the movie that jump-started Harvey Keitel's career). After his success with ALIEN, Ridley Scott made a few lackluster films before striking the goldmine again with THELMA AND LOUISE. Just about everything he did with the movie illustrates how talented of a filmmaker he is, from the vista views to the soundtrack to the casting to the closing scene.

Nevertheless, with all the wonderful things about the film, the movie is simply a buddy flick, but with women instead of men. A buddy flick about two women had really never quite been done before and the film did cause some controversy. It is also true that the film touches upon broad topics and social issues such as rape, justice, and what it means to be free (freedom always comes with a price tag). The film also has a great soundtrack and some awesome visuals of the American southwest. Still when you drain the memorable melodies and take all the pretty pictures away, the film remains at the core as simply just another buddy flick. A really good buddy flick, but a buddy flick nonetheless.",1013817600,,1426,4.636363636363637
444490,5,6302250277,"The storyline is simple and maybe too unbelievable. Most of the male characters are stereotypes. But this movie is really about the psychological states of the two female leads and their road journey. And the movie does an absolutely terrific job portraying these and getting the message across, precisely.
Susan Sarandon is brilliant (though I think she does a somewhat even better job in ""Dead Man Walking""), and Geena Davis is just fantastic. Davis delivers a performance so amazing that I like her as an actress and her as the character Thelma right away. Too bad that she's up against Jodie Foster in 1991's Oscar.
Harvey Keitel's character (a sympathetic cop) is a nice touch. He's there to tell us that Louise and Thelma are not merely some crazy, self-centered irresponsible women. He said in the last scene, ""How many times has this woman (Louise) has gotta be fxxked over...""
Some may feel the ending is too sad, inappropriate or unnecessary. But I just love that ending. It sums up everything of the movie. Perhaps one shouldn't look at it as an unrealistic end of their lives; It's an end of their ADVENTURE. It's their LIBERATION. Just imagine how Louise and Thelma may feel when they make the final decision and what they may be thinking about moments before the end, holding each other's hand... oh, what the heck....",1009756800,7,1332,4.820960698689956
444491,5,6302250277,"Where to start...Ridley Scott started out his film career with 'Alien', which blasted him into Hollywood with the help of a memorable dinner scene and Sigourney Weaver.  Other movies followed but none so good as this.  Here the road movie is turned on its head in that it's two women behind the wheel this time rather than the men that we're so used to seeing.  This movie can genuinely claim to have it all.  There are some absolutely laugh-out-loud scenes, dramatic car chases and some truly touching moments between the two friends.  Difficult scenes such as the rape scene early on are handled sensitively and without exploitation.
Basically Thelma and Louise (with Sarandon and Davis giving their best ever performances - and yes that even includes 'Dead Man Walking') decide to up sticks for a holiday, but find themselves on the run after shooting a man.  What follows is a fantastic escapist piece and it's easy to see why it is so popular.  It's also thought-provoking when Thelma says 'at least this way I'm having fun'.  Is fun defying the law?  The audience certainly has fun watching the two break the boundaries, but the end result of the film seems to be that true freedom comes at a cost.  This is seen in a spectacular end scene on the Grand Canyon that will have you on the edge of your seat.
True, the humour is obvious role-reversal.  True the majority of the male characters are presented as pigs.  True, it is one helluva ride that will stay with you for a long time.",1007337600,6,1489,4.619771863117871

""Thelma and Louise"" features a literate and ironic script, some beautiful and captivating camera work from director Ridley Scott, and excellent work from Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon as the titular duo.
If this film has a flaw, it's that it plays the feminist card a bit too heavy handedly, and tries to make the story of these two women into the story OF women, and I don't buy it.

This is the film that inspired many women to action, renewed friendships and made some women feel powerful. Although most women probably did not end their lives the way Thelma and Louise do in this film, women everywhere gathered some sense of togetherness from this film when two friends go on the run as events and circumstances around them escalate. Soon they are running from the law and feel that they have no alternatives although the detective on the case, played by Harvey Keitel, seems sympathetic and sincere in his desire to bring the twosome back peacefully.

444533,5,6302250277,"This has to be the most entertaining road movie since theclassic, Bonnie and Clyde! The plot is of Thelma (GEENA DAVIS), a bored housewife and Louise (SUSAN SARANDON) who is a waitress at a coffee shop. Together they sneak off in a 66 T-Bird convertable for a three day fishing trip. However along their travels they decide to stop off at a nightclub and encounter a drunken, foul mouthed rapist who Louise shoots. It is subsequently revealed that Louise was raped and is the reason why she shot him. This plunges them into a cross country escape from the police as they head for Mexico to begin a new life. The performances are all beleavable and likeable and as well as the fabulous two leading stars, this movie features an early role for Brad Pitt and also Harvey Kietel. The dialogue is sharp and witty and sometimes quite sad giving the characters the depth to make this as realistic as possible which they certainly manage to achieve. Tears and laughter are the ingredients to this now classic movie and the ending is sure to get a lump in your throat! There are also some magnificent shots of the Grand Canyon. EXCELLENT!",967075200,,1129,4.621890547263682
444544,5,6302250277,"This movie is just perfect on so many levels.  It will literally suck you in, so take the phone off the hook and get some Jiffy-Pop and Brews ready.  It's a roller coaster ride of a movie, which is only made better with the  amazing score by Hans Zimmer.  My theory about this movie is not one of  ""feminist fantasy""; rather, it has a theme everyone can relate to  at one point or another.  I believe that this movie is really about the  numbing humdrumness of everyday life,and the way that we all accept our  lot, but that on some level we sometimes wish to escape.  The scene where  Louise pulls the car over and gets out and just stands there, looking out  in the night and absorbing all of the sounds, is particularly gripping; in  her eyes we see a crossover, a metamorphosis. It's freedom.  I also  appreciate the movie's working-middle-class undertones: Louise as the jaded  waitress, and Thelma as the edge-of-white-trash housewife.  This movie came  out at a time when the working class was finally being re-examined in  popular media, with shows like ""Roseanne."" This is a movie that  is about the desperation of modern life, and about quiet anger unleashed. A  must see.",966556800,4,1182,4.640776699029126
444545,5,6302250277,"For all the guys out there who felt the this was a 'male bashing' movie I say wake up and begin to realize that your reality is not necessarily a female's reality.  There are indeed men out there who display the same  disrespect and inconsideration for women as is portrayed in the film.  The  same can be said for 'The Color Purple'.  Another absolutely fabulous  film.
But for all you ladies out there who are steady screamin' 'You go  boy' I would say that you have to be willing to accept responsibility for  the choices that you make.  Like who you decide to date and marry for  example.  No one is responsible for those poor choices other than the  individuals who make them.  (Women)
That being said however, the film  depicts, what I believe as a male is, a very unfavorable reality for many  women in our society today.  Disrespect for women as people, potential of  attack, restriction of expression, the list goes on and on.  Once again,  none of that is any excuse for suffering the consequences of the bad  choices that we make as individuals.  In short, our society does much to  devalue, exploit, and subjegate women.  But at the same time if you date or  marry a jerk and you end up being mistreated then that responsibility is  yours and yours alone if you decide to put up with that type of behavior.  For that I have no sympathy.
To all the guys out there I say 'We owe it  to ourselves and the women who love us and treat us like Kings to treat  them far far better than we do.'
To the women I say ""Quit cryin' and  begin to take responsibility for your own lives""",959904000,4,1584,4.347079037800687
444546,5,6302250277,"This is an instant classic. Controversial and creating two instant female American icons. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are nothing short than perfect as Thelma & Louise, both creating equally likable and complex  characters. Considered to be a female buddy road-trip movie, but this film  is much, much more, mainly because of the excellent multi-layered  screenplay. Ridley Scott directed an instant American classic. Some scenes  are now considered classics, such as the ending. The 'male' part of the  cast are all excellent, Harvey Keitel and Michael Madsen are great. Brad  Pitt is also a stand-out in the role that shot him into stardom. Extremely  entertaining and even poignant near the end. This one is in a category all  of it's own.

444547,5,6302250277,"I put off watching this movie for years, as it was mostly referred to as a ""chick flick"".  Years later, I finally decided to rent it because I kept hearing bits and pieces of it and I was a little curious.  When I  saw this movie the first time, I was stunned, amazed, and completely taken  in.  And yes, as I guy I am hesitant to say it, but I was a little teary at  the end! But most of all this movie had me laughing on the floor  throughout, with Louise's dry humour and Thelma's dizzy antics.  I also  like the way that by the movie's end, the two characters virtually had  reversed roles.  Very clever. I have heard that Cher was originally  supposed to play Louise, but I cannot imagine any other artist perfecting  that roll better than Susan Sarandon.  She WAS Louise.  When they pulled  out of the bar after Louise had shot Harlan, there has not been any better  acting than Sarandon did, as Louise struggled with the consequences of what  had happened. Both Thelma and Louise deliver so many one-liners, you will  be laughing and then crying.  A very emotionally driven and all-around  entertaining movie.  Hands down, this is one of my favorite movies of all  time.",957830400,,1177,4.44811320754717
444548,5,6302250277,"""Thelma and Louise"" has been described as a road movie, a buddy film, a chick flick, and while it is each of these, it is so much more than the sum of all its parts that it defies an easy description. It's also been excoriated as an exercise in man-bashing, which it most emphatically is not. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis in the title roles bring a chemistry to the film that sets off sparks. The acting, Ridley Scott's direction, Callie Khoury's screenplay, the stunning cinematography, and above all, the film's score, played by the legendary B.B. King, make this one of the great movies of the 1990's.

The movie tells the story of Louise (Sarandon), a thirty-something waitress, tired of the excuses of her commitment-phobic musician boyfriend, and Thelma (Davis), a submissive Barbie-doll type housewife, married right out of high school, used to letting everyone else do her thinking for her, and totally faithful to her cheating creepazoid of a husband. The ladies decide they need a break from the unsatisfactory men in their lives and hit the road for some R and R at weekend retreat. A chance stop at a roadside bar ends in attempted rape and retaliatory murder, and Thelma and Louise are on the road for real this time, running from the law across some of the most spectacularly beautiful scenery in the American Southwest.

On their way, they pick up a lowlife drifter (a knockout of a debut by Brad Pitt) who almost ruins their chances for escape. When Louise, who has up to now been leading Thelma, is ready to collapse in defeat, it is Thelma who picks her up and takes over. One of the most interesting things to watch in this movie is Thelma's progression from a brain-dead zombie to a strong, resourceful, independent individual. It is Thelma who seals their fate irreversibly (murder may be a justifiable reaction to attempted rape, but there is no excuse for robbing a convenience store at gunpoint), and who rescues them when they are pulled over by a cop in Arizona.

Sarandon is excellent as Louise, radiating authority and attitude, but Davis gives the performance of a lifetime as Thelma, making a seamless transition from an empty-headed hausfrau to a don't-mess-with-me lady in charge of her own destiny. A defining moment in her character development occurs when she telephones her husband Darryl and responds to his with characteristically boorish demand that she ""get her azz back here now"" with a suggestion as to what he can do with himself. Darryl is the film's comic character, a smarmy jerk too full of himself to understand what a horse's azz he is, his hyperinflated ego shriveling to nothing when he realizes his days of intimidating his wife are over. The supporting actors are generally excellent, but outstanding among them is Harvey Keitel as the lead detective, sympathizing with the women's plight but sworn to uphold the law and rope these wayward ladies in.

The film is sad and comic by turns; the women have extricated themselves from the trap of unsatisfying relationships only to land into a deeper trap that is slowly but surely closing in on them. The humor is injected by some adventures along the way, notably with a highway patrolman who makes the mistake of a lifetime in pulling these two over, and dealing with a particularly obnoxious long-haul truck driver who tries to pick them up in Arizona, only to have his fantasies of roadside debauchery literally blown up in his face.

By the film's end, Thelma and Louise have grown and bonded so closely together that both they and we realize there is only one way out for them. They can only run so far for so long, and there is no way we are going to see these two ladies in handcuffs. The film ends in the only way it could end, and while it's a sad ending, it's also exhilarating to realize that Thelma and Louise lived more in a weekend than many people live in a lifetime.

444549,5,6302250277,"Even after numerous viewings, this film remains one of the most enjoyable I've ever seen. It works on many levels, mainly due to the likable personalites of the movies two fugitives, Thelma (Geena Davis in her best  role) and Louise (Susan Sarandon). Their exploits take them on a road trip  across the United States where they challenge male authority through a  number of cartoonish characters (sexist truck driver, stony-faced state  trooper, etc). Following the conventions of the road film, the two women  make both a psychological journey as well as a geographical one. What makes  their predicament so heartfelt is that they never meant to run from the law  in the first place.  By the end of the trip, they've reached a point where  'they can no longer turn back.' I've always wondered what that line meant.  Was this film taking a pro-lesbian stance? Or maybe the women found that  they didn't need the men in their lives to define who they were. This is a  film I recommend purchasing as it's one you should see more than once.",951868800,8,1037,4.731843575418995

444551,5,6302250277,"Alien made the director Ridley Scott famous, Blade Runner made him the king of adult science fiction. Thelma & Louise made him a bloody genious. No one else didn't want to do this movie expect Scott! They didn't  think there could be enough potential in a story about two women and a  thunderbird. That is really interesting. Ridley Scott took the challenge  and has done a wonderful work. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are both  perfect in their roles. The silent changing of these two characters is done  smootly in the film without underlining. You really start to feel what they  feel as the movie goes on. There is no doubt that they are good guys, even  then when they rob that store and when they blow up that perverts truck.  Harvey Keitel as a honest policeman makes a great role also. Brad Pitt was  annoying at first but what the hell, he IS the character he is playing. I  hate the fact that some people dislike this film because there are women in  the mainroles, and men are left to the background. I think that is just the  power of this movie. Geena&Susan are doing their roles with a good  taste, as well as the whole film.
Scott is the master of visuals. Movie  looks very good, every frame is planned. The plot is kinda simple but Scott  makes it work. He is not making  it too emotional or too artistic. It is a  real fine mix of entertainment and serious filmaking. Music plays also an  important role in this film. It is full of positive songs, and Hans Zimmers  original score with slide guitar is stunning. After you have seen  Thelma&Louise you just want to feel that freedom and that road by  yourself. No other roadmovie before this haven't painted the landscapes and  the enthustiasm of driving and getting away so well. This is a dramatic  story about finding yourself and finding that true meaning of frienship  that is eventually all that counts. I'm sorry but I can't think anything  bad about Thelma&Louise. It gets better every time you watch it...that  is a promise!
DVD was a good experience, the original widescreen ratio  makes the movie to look suberb. There is also lots of special stuff on the  DVD. For example Scotts commentary track and alternative ending.",949104000,8,2201,4.5886889460154245
