4117793,4,B003F3NDW6,"The same exciting cast, with Kadee Strickland (Charlotte King) offering the best performance.  However, there are signs of fatigue among the show's writers:  Many episodes are downright depressing, characters have more or less all slept with each other, and many twists in the plot are difficult to believe.  For example, why would a doctor recommend a procedure that puts his patient at a major risk of dying?  Why would a hospital administrator allow a relative to get into a patient's room, in defiance of a judge's order, knowing that the relative will unplug the machine?  Can a surgeon in the middle of a procedure decide to stop and have his patient die because he just found out that the patient was the cause of an accident involving the surgeon's daughter? Have the writers never heard of lawyers? Have they no knowledge of the hippocratic oath? And, what's with the cat??!!",1294444800,,884,4.866666666666666

4117795,5,B003F3NDW6,I so Love this T.V. Show!!  It's just as great as Grey's Anatomy and it's not just another Drama show.  The Characters display awesome performances that keep you in and out of your seat!  The intensity of each episode makes you wonder...do these things really happen in a hospital or clinic.  Wow!!!  I can't wait to continue watching and patiently await for more seasons ahead!,1289952000,,378,4.753846153846154
4117796,5,B003F3NDW6,"At times this season can be very sad and yet you are compelled to keep watching. The show keeps you going and actively makes you ask what is going to happen next. Is she going to die? Will the baby be alright? Will they find the other baby?
At other times this season is very sensual and erotic and you keep watching to see if they will end up together.",1289088000,,353,4.057142857142857
4117797,5,B003F3NDW6,"it took me a little while to get into Private Practice but I have to say season 3 is the beast season so far. It makes you laugh, and it makes you cry. Charaters that you didn't think would grow on you start to and ones you once loved start to annoy you. The shipping time on this was fairly decent and it came in pefect condition.",1288051200,,331,3.955223880597015
4117798,1,B003F3NDW6,I am very happy with my purchase.  I recieved in a timely manner and it was packaged perfectly.,1286841600,,95,4.277777777777778
4117799,4,B003F3NDW6,"In 2007, Shonda Rhimes (creator/executive producer of ""Grey's Anatomy"" and writer of ""The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement"") developed a spin-off of ""Grey's Anatomy"" titled ""Private Practice"" based on the life of Dr. Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh). For the most part, ""Private Practice"" Season One lasted about nine episodes and received a so/so reception from fans.

For the second season, viewers were promised a much more exciting season and sure enough, Shondra Rhimes and crew were able to take the series to different heights this time around.

The premise of the series is that Dr. Addison Montgomery has left Seattle Grace Hospital and moved to California to work for a private practice, Oceanside Wellness Center. In the first season, Dr. Addison Montgomery had to win the respect of her fellow doctors and relationships were examined in the first season.

In the second season, Oceanside Wellness Center is not exactly in the best circumstances as the center faces major financial problems, a new rival practice trying to steal their clients, more relationship problems and drama, cross-over episodes with ""Grey's Anatomy"" and to cap things off, a dark and twisted season finale that viewers were probably not expecting.

For the third season, ""Private Practice"" was all about personal challenges and taking things up a notch.  For Addison, we know that her promiscuity comes from her father and she knows she has to deal with it.  This season, she finds herself in more complication situations and also having to decide where she stands with Pete and Sam.

Naomi is also put into an interesting situation as her move to another center tests her friendship with Addison but also her business/personal relationships with the men she works with.  But most of all, she's tested as a mother, with a teenager who is growing up.

Violet and Pete must take on many challenges after Violet has suffered a major attack and now, not sure where she is in her life after the attack and having to give up her baby and making Pete a single father.  Cooper and Charlotte's relationship is tested and as volatile as a couple, they are also in love but have a difficult time showing it.

This third season features episodes that deal with personal and emotional challenges, discovery, heartbreak and tragedy.

VIDEO:

""Private Practice - The Complete Third Season"" is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1) - Enhanced for 169 televisions. Whereas ""Grey's Anatomy"" tends to be focused indoors, inside the hospital, ""Private Practice"" has a slick California look. Indoor scenes are well-lit and outdoor scenes are quite vibrant but viewers will notice the grain in the series. Even during the low-light scenes, you do see a bit of noise but compared to other drama series on television, the series is above average in terms of picture quality on DVD.

AUDIO:

As for audio, ""Private Practice - The Complete Third Season"" is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Possibly with the exceptions of the final episode with the sirens and episode 41 (Blow Ups), the series is primarily dialogue driven, so it's pretty much front and center channel driven.

The show is presented in English SDH, Spanish and French subtitles.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Private Practice - The Complete Third Season"" includes the following special features:

DISC 5:

  * Kate's Top 8 - (12:16) Kate Walsh talks about her top 8 favorite moments from season 3.  Featuring interviews with show creators and television crew.
  * Deleted Scenes - (8:10) Featuring 12 deleted scenes.
  * Bloopers - (4:27) ""Private Practice"" season 3 bloopers

EXTRAS:

""Private Practice - The Complete Third Season"" comes with a slipcase cover.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Oh Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers!  And the writers for both ""Private Practice"" and ""Grey's Anatomy"" series...  You listened to the fans and what good you have done to improve ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Private Practice"" this last season.  And you should be commended for what you have done.

Last year's ""Private Practice"" was going through an average season until things picked up towards the season finale which came out of nowhere.  But there had to be some improvements to this series.  The characters needed to be put in situations and challenges that they have never been before.

It was one thing for Violet to deal with her violent attack and then leaving her baby behind, we got to see how things would develop between Violet and Pete, Cooper and Charlotte, the love triangle between Addison, Sam and Pete and to also see some development with Naomi and her relationship with Addison starting to deteriorate and then to see her find some love in her life.  But instead of becoming the usual ""Private Practice"" and characters sleeping with this character and that character, there were some deep storylines where the talents were given moments to shine.

Kate Walsh did a fantastic job this season and she absolutely shined in episodes such as ""The Hard Part"" in which she gave such an emotional performance, Amy Brennerman also shined as the victim in the beginning of the season and also her return in the last episodes of the third season.  The writers did a great job in thrusting other characters in positions that they have never been in before.  Taye Diggs, Tim Daly, Audra McDonald were put into emotional situations and I really enjoyed the ups and downs between Adelstein's Cooper and Strickland's Charlotte.

I felt another positive about this season is by bringing in new characters (like they did with ""Grey's Anatomy"").  There is only so much viewers can stand of Addison sleeping with this guy or that guy and Pete or Sam being with this woman and that woman, it's time that the series had new blood and the addition of Amelia Shepherd, William and Dr. Fife was very good.  Especially the potential of Amelia Shepherd, which would lead to crossover episodes with ""Grey's Anatomy"" that did not always involve Addison.

And by the end of the season...as how Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers and the writers have shocked everyone with multiple tragedies in the sixth season finale of ""Grey's Anatomy"", the writers came up with a shocking finale in ""Private Practice"".

Of course, there is only so much you can do with tragedy and this is not something that people will want to see every season finale but it was necessary as ""Private Practice"" needed to pull off a season finale that could best last year's shocking finale.  And the writers were successful.  But now we can only hope that they continue the solid writing for the fourth season.

Overall, ""Private Practice - The Complete Third Season"" was the best season thus far.  The DVD contains a few special features and I wish there was more.  But the writing alone for this season was a major improvement and if you are a fan of this series, definitely give this DVD box set a chance!",1285286400,4,6861,4.93205574912892
4117800,5,B003F3NDW6,"Private Practice is an amazing show.  I recommend it to anyone that is into drama - TV.  I am a huge Grey's Anatomy fan - and I have been since season one, but I think that my favorite has now switched over to Private Practice as of the 3rd season of the spinoff.  The writers for this show create very intricate plots - there are many parallels between the patients' lives and the doctors' lives in each episode.  The only complaint I have is the ""recycling"" of actors.  Because Grey's and Private Practice occasionally have cross-over episodes, they remain connected, and it can make the show seem less real for die-hard fans when an actor plays a timid bird watcher patient on Grey's one season, and appears as a child molester on Private Practice the next.  That of course is the TV biz I suppose.  Ah well, it is still a fantastic show! Can't wait for season 4!",1285027200,,866,4.443037974683544
4117801,4,B003F3NDW6,"I've watched this season on live TV and followed it since the main character Addison left Seattle Grace (Grey's Anatomy) and lived in LA. Now I admit that the first season of Private Practice wasn't as amazing as it should have been following in the large footsteps of Grey's Anatomy. However, it was good enough to stand up on it's own.

The second season really didn't explore too much of the characters and focused more on the medical cases and those sort of stories which did make it good but the characters seemed somewhat shallow and hard to watch sometimes since we couldn't understand their intentions.

However, this season pulls us MUCH more into the character's history and actually lays down a whole case for everyone. Everyone had their shining moment and story which were pretty well written in my opinion and was much better than the previous two seasons. Especially jumping off Season two's cliffhanger. In my opinion, it was a strong show but there were times where I wished there was more.

I'm still a loyal fan and watcher.",1282694400,13,1043,4.751381215469613

4117875,3,B003F3NDW6,"I have watched all seasons of Grey's Anatomy even though I found the show annoying.  The show was annoying because the patients only had the following conditions: neurological problems, terratomas, perforated bowels, etc..  I liked being caught up in an occupation unlike my own.  After Grey's was over, I decided to watch Private Practice.  Private Practice is an exact copy of Grey's Anatomy.  In the Second Season of Private Practice, you actually saw Grey's Anatomy actors/actresses.  One promiment cast member is Krevner; she is now on Grey's Anatomy as Jackson's wife but on Private Practice she played a college student who gave up her baby.

This season of Private Practice, Naomi has moved to the 4th floor.  Violet is ignoring her baby because it reminds her of the crime.  Violet also has slept with someone's father.  Naomi's ex-husband doesn't really do anything and Pete spends his time waiting on Violet to come around.  Addison is not dating anyone and is delivering every distressed baby in town.  Imagine my frustration when one of the babies had a terratoma.  ENOUGH with the terratomas.

What I find interesting or odd is Shonda Rhimes' storytelling.  On her shows, family is NOT important, only friendships.  The emphasis is always on ""best friends"" which makes the shows feel juvenile.  These people are grown with kids of their own, saying best friend over and over again sounds stupid.  As adults, most people have a close friend or closest friend.

I am going to give this show one more season, but as it stands it is not that interesting of a show.",1439683200,,1574,4.893939393939394

But Paul Adelstein and Amy Brenneman are so unbelievable in their characters that I simply cannot watch them anymore - I'm starting to fast forward through their scenes.

4118027,5,B003F3NDW6,"My wife and I started with Season 1 a few weeks ago and she has watched all 100+ episodes.  I've managed to see about 25 but everyone I've seen has been so good, that inevitably I'll just start the next episode until I realize it's past 11:00pm and I need to be asleep.  Like all good or great TV series, having the ability to watch episodes back to back from Season 1 forward, is very similar to good book you just cannot put down.

This series has great combination of recurring cast members and some even get episodes that revolve around them only, with the other cast members doing cameo like appearances.  The topics they deal with are timely and although, the vast majority of the cast are M.D.'s or PhD's, they still experience the same things that go on in our lives.  Like having and raising children, issues with ex-spouses, occasional legal troubles, etc.

I have to say this is definitively not for the PG-13 crowd or younger as there is lot of sex and sexual innuendo however; these things are part of life too and they don't make an extraordinary effort to fit these contexts into the normal story lines.

All and all, I rate it a full 5 stars because the acting, writing and backdrop are all outstanding, in my opinion.",1372204800,,1234,4.482142857142857

4118099,1,B003F3NDW6,"Private Practice is great- this season was GREAT and it is definitely worth a watch.

However, after I ordered this from Amazon and watched through it when I went to ""sell it back"" to Amazon Trade-In it was denied.  It returned under the ""unauthorized edition"" policy which states that the disc or contents are not the originals released by the publisher.  I was really disappointed that Amazon would sell me this kind of version.  I will think twice before ordering season 4 through them or any other box sets.  Amazon really dropped the ball on this.",1322611200,,552,4.708333333333333

4118103,3,B003F3NDW6,"I think season three is probably better than season two of Private Practice, which is unusual for a tv drama. The plots are a little bit more believable and the characters are already well-established. I like the introduction of Amy Shephard (neurosurgeon), as I think she helps keeps things a bit grounded. This is probably my favourite series of Private Practice.",1302393600,,365,5.0
