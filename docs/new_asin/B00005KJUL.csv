1620327,4,B00005KJUL,"The only reason I'm giving this DVD collection a 4 is simply because it is the Rugrats. The Rugrats was the best animated show Nick ever had, period. It's such a mistake that towards it's end they just slowly let it dwindle and were unable to interest their new audience in All Grown Up. The Rugrats are my memory of the 1990s and my childhood, and it makes me angry that Nick hasn't released seasons of it. PUT OUT THE SEASONS!",1171756800,3,428,4.296296296296297
1620328,1,B00005KJUL,Where are the seasonal sets of this fine show.  They're doing the seasonal sets of Spongebob for crying out loud.,1136160000,27,113,4.65
1620329,4,B00005KJUL,"This Rugrats DVD celebrates ten years of fantastic adventures on Nickelodeon. The ten episodes included in this retrospective were handpicked by the fans themselves as the cream of the crop. Episodes include ""Angelica Orders Out,"" ""The First Cut,"" ""Reptar On Ice,"" ""No Bones About It,"" ""Be My Valentine,"" ""Chuckie vs. The Potty,"" ""Doctor Susie,"" ""Vacation Special,"" ""Finsterella,"" and ""Bigger Than Life."" Plus, you get bonuses. I loved these episodes so gave this 4 stars. I would have liked to see a Seasons box sets though instead of all these greatest episodes DVD's.",1124150400,54,570,5.206521739130435
1620330,5,B00005KJUL,"this show was so good. it reminds me of a my childhood. this is suppossed to be the top 10 episodes decided by the fans so I trust all my fellow rugrats fans, all you 6 year old kids better have chosen well or I'm gonna be pissed. i haven't seen it in so long. i stopped when baby dill came along. i saw one recently though, it was alright. it starts off as the babies are doing things for angelica like bringing her cookies and stuff. and chuckies dad makes a clubhouse for them and when chucky and his dad go inside to do something angelica lies to tommy and phil and lil and tells them that it's a rocket ship and that chucky and his dad are aliens.
the best one is when the babies goto the movies and they have to see some kids movie. even grandpa is mad so he falls asleep. hes so jewish so is tommy and chucky is SO jewish its not even funny. but they always have that christman episode too. anyways about the movie episode. its so cool cause the babies sneak up to the projector room and watch all the movies and they find Reptar.
another good episode is when the black girl moves in across the street and the pickles' family go over to their house and bring them jello as a house warming gift. its cool cause they go through all the rooms and they're all empty so tommy and co. have adventures.
rugrats is great and every episode is an instant classic. watch this dvd. although the hannika episode is always weird cause angelica is pharoah and tommy is moses and chucky, phil and lil accidently build the pyramind upside down.",1086739200,3,1534,4.22108843537415
1620331,1,B00005KJUL,"Some kids seem to really like these episodes.  I fear for them.  But, I fear more for their parents and society.  This cartoon features a collection of insipid, annoying children who make you wonder if they're intended to depict human beings or some lower, more grating form of life.  And it's not just the kids.  The parents and grandparents are unnerving in their own way, in part because you know that they gave birth, directly or indirectly, to these cloying offspring.
...
Anyway, my daughter rented this--and forced me to sit through it to convince me that it had some merit.  She was wrong.  ...",1018137600,3,602,4.6761904761904765

The Potty"" and ""Vacation""), but, this set of 10 most popular ""Rugrats"" episodes, as picked by Nickelodeon viewers online earlier this year, will make any fans happy for another 10 years. Even they'll be proud with the extras that served as the bonuses.

1620366,5,B00005KJUL,"Back in 2001, Nick had an online poll on nick.com for the Top 10 Rugrats episodes in its first decade, when the Internet was a lot slower & not so plentiful, and the fans of the time ultimately voted for the 10 in this disc, and a separate 2-tape VHS set, more than any other episodes at the time. All of the episodes in this special disc range from seasons 2 to 7, according to the season sets now available from Amazon, but with slightly-edited prints of Vacation & Finsterella, since they were whole 22-minute episodes without being called 2-parters, in the case of the Valentine special. But sadly, this disc contains things not found in any season set; bonus features, especially the rarely-seen pilot episode! Other bonuses include clips from 10 other episodes from seasons 2 to 7 that weren't in the countdown, the Pickles Family Photo Album short, and 2 old Rugrats music videos from Nick in the 1990's. You might as well get this disc to accompany the season sets, movie trilogy and/or Tales From The Crib DVDs, mainly for the bonus features since they're not in any other DVD, and this whole thing being a time capsule from bygone eras in Nick history and technological history; it's a wonder Decade in Diapers on DVD still being made & sold brand-new today! The 2 VHS volumes of this collection contain Retromercials & a long, old Nick jingle before the feature presentations got started, that aren't on the single DVD. For the bonus features' sake, don't hesitate to add this time capsule to your Rugrats DVD collection today, unless you've done it LONG ago and still have yours.

However, I felt hoodwinked because I bought 2 things and they came from separate suppliers so I paid double for postage.  So the $22 fee for the 3 things ended up triple the cost of the goods.  I did not realise until it was too late.  Not impressed at all.",1398643200,,321,4.283333333333333

1620395,4,B00005KJUL,"""Rugrats"" is a favorite of mine from my childhood. Every now and then I watch re-runs on that popular block on TeenNick called ""The 90's Are All That."" First off, the way this DVD is put together is very dated. It's from 2001 and was released to commemorate the 10th anniversary of ""Rugrats."" The show is now 23 years old and the seasons have been released as Amazon exclusives. The season sets are too overpriced for me though but finding this DVD for a cheap price is all I need (and maybe a couple other compilations). I remember seeing all of these episodes on Nickelodeon back in the day. I especially liked that it had the Vacation special. You won't be seeing the original intro. Instead it's the intro from the later seasons and there are intervals in-between each episode talking about the next episode. I only wish they included more episodes, but you also get a bonus...the unaired pilot episode, which was a treat for me. You also get two dated but classic music videos that were shown on Nickelodeon back in the mid 90's along with short clips from other episodes that weren't included on this DVD. Definitely worth it if you just want a simple list of episodes of ""Rugrats"" just for nostalgic purposes.",1380240000,4,1216,4.608294930875576
1620396,4,B00005KJUL,Even if you didn't grow up with Rugrats you can appreciate the humor and the moral of stories told.  The way they take everyday words and turn them into baby versions is quite clever.  A good gift item for the nostalgic or just those who want relatively wholesome entertainment for the younger generation.,1371427200,4,305,4.735849056603773

1620398,5,B00005KJUL,"The Rugrats has always been one of my favorite shows. It ran from 1991-1994 and then went on a small hiatus. It would eventually return to the spotlight. Then in 1998 the first movie ""The Rugrats Movie"" came out. The movie introduced Dil whom was unquestionably cute (although he's a bit of an attention hogging crybaby). Dil has to be my favorite rugrat (next to Tommy). Then in 2000 a second movie was released ""Rugrats in Paris"". Kimi (Chuckie's new step-sister) and Kira (Kimi's mom and Chuckie's new stepmother) were introduced. In my opinion, the addition of these 3 characters helped the show to grow and become extremely popular among kids. I thought the spin-off ""All Grown Up"" was OK. It was cool to see the babies as pre-teens.",1364342400,,738,4.728682170542636
1620408,5,B00005KJUL,"My 5-year-old loves the Rugrats and this was a great buy!

It is a nice series of different episodes with all type of stories and also has some neat special features which include: Rugrats clip gallery, 2 Rugrats music videos (Rugrats Rock and Rugrats Rap), The Rugrats pilot episode, the Pickles family phot album feature and more. Like I said a total must buy for any Rugrats fan or someone just starting their Rugrats collection.
To make this a total package this also includes the Rugrats Mysteries DVD.
