8508967,4,B0072M77QE,"The information presented in this video is excellent,and something no one has taught me in 30 years and 3000 hrs of flying. I feel this is a must-know. The reason I give the video only 4 stars is that it is mostly a lecture repeating what the book says. It would have benefited from much more actual inflight footage to drive the points home. As it is now, you HAVE to buy the book...it will make you a better pilot and make you understand rarely taught but extremely important concepts. If you already have the book, the video is somewhat redundant due to the absence of inflight footage.",1525046400,,589,4.462962962962963
