3940163,4,B002KE4ZIW,"Though definitely not on the same par as ""Roman Holiday,"" (to which it has been compared) this movie has its own charm. Great leads and excellent supporting cast carry a story that admittedly does stretch the limits of credibility, but is fun nonetheless. We see a glowing Olivia de Havilland playing a bored, bookish princess who is not impressed with the possibilities for marriage left among the noble bloodlines of Europe. When she overdoses on sleeping pills during a flight to stay at a family friend's ranch, she is found hopelessly incoherent after the plane has been forced to turn around due to fog. Her passage had been booked and paid for without a phone number or return address to preserve her anonymity, so they don't know who to call or where to take her. The pilots of the small plane, played well by Bob Cummings and Jack Carson, decide that Dave (Carson) will go home to his wife while O'Rourke (Cummings) pumps her with coffee and finds out how to get her home. His plan is starting to work when the owner of the diner where the coffee is being dispensed takes sympathy on the young woman who so obviously wants to go to sleep. He slips her a sleeping pill in the next cup of coffee and that seals the deal. O'Rourke calls his buddy Dave to have his wife (a bright and pretty Jane Wyman) come and undress her so he can put her to bed for the night. O'Rourke to ""Mary Williams"", ""Boy, are you lucky I was raised right.""

When she awakens the next day the princess chooses to hide her true identity, but does check in with her uncle and guardian (Charles Coburn), who then has her followed to make sure she is okay. Fun ensues as O'Rourke tries to stop the guy he sees following her, as she tries to volunteer for the war effort, and as her uncle discovers O'Rourke has 8 brothers and his father had 10 brothers.

Though the events in the White House scenes may be a stretch, the movie is fun and entertaining. Miss de Havilland plays the bored princess, the lost refugee and the self-assured guest at the White House with equal charm. Cummings goes from the slightly cocky pilot to the uncertain almost prince consort in a convincing manner. Not a solid four-star movie in my opinion, but I felt it deserved more than just an ""okay"" that the three stars indicates.",1284595200,,2283,4.485576923076923
3940164,2,B002KE4ZIW,"This movie starts off with some clever and funny scenes between a sleeping pill induced Princess and an unsuspecting pilot.  However, it quickly fades into tediousness as the romance between the Princess and the Pilot becomes ever more impractical.  I don't know why, but reverse Cinderella stories just don't seem to work.  And in this movie what should by all counts be a happy ending, ends up being a flat and  unrealistic disappointment.  Even for Hollywood.  Part of it is that Robert Cummings as the Pilot doesn't come across as likeable as in some of his other films.  He seems a little bit arrogant in a way.  And I found myself not wanting them to get together because of his attitude.  In the end, this movie is just for a night when there isn't anything else to watch.",1268438400,,779,4.586956521739131
3940165,4,B002KE4ZIW,"A decade before Audrey Hepburn dazzled everyone's socks off in ROMAN HOLIDAY, Olivia de Havilland was almost as terrific playing a similar role. PRINCESS O'ROURKE, with its 1943 theatrical release, is a terrific romantic comedy and it's set firmly in the wartime era. Besides de Havilland, the film stars a very underrated actor and one of my favorite guys circa the 1940s in Robert Cummings.

Princess Maria - she and her royal family exiled from some European kingdom presumably overrun by swastikas on legs - is presently in New York and terribly bored, her minders and her sourpussed uncle (Charles Coburn, very good) constantly looking over her shoulder. Respite comes when she gets a chance to go away to Frisco by herself, except that she's never flown before and she's pretty nervous about that. This leads us to a funny running gag on the airplane involving Maria and a procession of sleeping pills, the end result of which is that she ends up, woozy and out of sorts, in the reluctant care of Eddie O'Rourke, an airline pilot about to go into the Army Air Corps.

Eddie believes Maria to be a poor refugee and tries to help her out. Cue the falling in love and, later, the jaw-dropping surprise on his part, because Maria doesn't let on that she's in fact ""born to the purple"" until much later. But it all ends well, thanks in part to that gent on Pennsylvania avenue and his little dog Fala.

There must be heaps and heaps of this sort of movie churned out by the Hollywood dream factory back in the '30s and '40s, pictures rife with sentiment and patriotism. PRINCESS O'ROURKE happens to be a standout, and why is it that more people aren't aware of this little gem? PRINCESS O'ROURKE is plenty good and very funny. Another thing I appreciate is that the wartime propaganda doesn't bash you on the head like a preachy sledgehammer.

There's a warmth in this film, and it's partly because of the actors' performances but it's also partly because of the fine script. Jack Carson (who delivers several wicked funny lines) and a sassy Jane Wyman are wonderful. They play Eddie's friends and loving married couple Dave and Jean Campbell. Dave and Jean embody the wartime era's romantic tearjerker of a chestnut, the sweethearts soon to be parted, what with Dave also about to join the big war alongside his pal Eddie. Carson and Wyman's often playful, sometimes emotional interplay hits you unexpectedly, especially when that heartwrenching dance floor scene rolls around and the chanteuse starts singing ""Honorable Moon."" It certainly impacts the princess, and it infuses the story with a somber tone.

Charles Coburn as Maria's snobbish uncle imparts on his niece and on us the practical, sometimes harsh realities of the lives of deposed royals and the importance of crafting an alliance, of treating one's sons and daughters as commodities and marry them off to further benefit family and lineage. Initially outraged, Maria's uncle comes around when he learns that boys tend to run in Eddie O'Rourke's family tree. He's then heard to repeatedly marvel: ""Did I tell you he's one of nine boys... His father is one of eleven boys.""

Olivia de Havilland's performance is the key, though. Much like how Audrey Hepburn would play it ten years later, de Havilland's Princess Maria comes across as innocent yet curious but with that well-mannered demeanor intact. Not as delightfully coltish as Hepburn, de Havilland shared with her, at least for this one time, that sense of openness to new experiences. And a certain quiet grace. Oh, and she's wet in a bathtub, rrrrrr. I prefer her like this, more so than when she was playing, say, Maid Marian or Abbie Irving or Melanie Hamilton. But I'm a sucker for old-time romantic comedies.

Maybe the guy was bland or too generic or whatever it is, but nowadays Robert Cummings isn't as well remembered as his more celebrated contemporaries. Cummings, I thought, excelled in lighthearted comedies; he was great in THE DEVIL AND MISS JONES and THE BRIDE WORE BOOTS. He's a good looking dude with just that bit of goof in him. But he also represented in his more dramatic roles, just check out SABOTEUR, KINGS ROW, and DIAL M FOR MURDER. It sucks that not more of his films are available on DVD. He makes an excellent foil for de Havilland, although his character perhaps may have been a bit too preoccupied with the icebox. But he comes up with my favorite line in this film (""Prince... Here, Prince!""). I guess you just gotta hear it in context.",1266019200,8,4492,4.788387096774193
3940166,5,B002KE4ZIW,This story is light and fun.  Olivia DeHavilland is delightful but the real star of the show is Robert Cummings.  He's an absolute gentleman with comic appeal.  I also really enjoyed Charles Coburn as the Princess's uncle.  He goes out of his way to make sure the princess makes a marriage that is both beneficial to her country and will also procreate boys.  It's hilarious and I loved it.,1260230400,3,390,4.594202898550725
3940167,3,B002KE4ZIW,"Princess O'Rourke was a huge hit when it appeared on screens in World War II America. A reverse Cinderella romance between a sophisticated Princess from Europe, Olivia de Havilland, and a down to earth American flier, Robert (Bob) Cummings, the film was so popular a bomber was named after the title character, and screenwriter and first time director Norman Krashna won the Oscar for best original screenplay. With Charles Coburn in a supporting role and such a famous name as Olivia de Havilland at the top of the billing its absence from any DVD issue seems on the surface surprising.

Thanks to the wonderful Warner's Archive Collection this DVD both allows us a chance to see the film again, and explains why the film languished. The lovely Ms de Havilland begins the film in a near comatose state - from an overdose of sleeping pills - and never really recovers. Her performance seems equal parts confusion and disinterested annoyance. There are many stories about her travails during the filming, and frankly it shows in her lack of engagement. Part of this may be her total incompatibility with Cummings, who reportedly was often not even around to do his scenes, forcing her to work with a double.

Matching an actress of Havilland's depth with the lightweight Cummings needed a far surer hand at the directing helm than Krashna shows. Cummings gives it his all, enthusiastically repeating his by then already established trademark persona of the grown up boy scout, seen previously in Krashna's far better earlier, ""The Devil and Miss Jones"". Coburn, who was given such a rich central role in that film, is here limited to playing a very small part, given mostly mean, unfunny lines, and wasted.

The central idea that this socially impossible couple might actually marry pushes credibility, in a later movie version this fairy tale ending is rightly brought up short. The accompanying theme of war-time marriages among young people who've just met makes far more sense, though this fertile theme is handled with ever so much more discernment and sympathy by Vincente Minelli in his fine film ""The Clock"".&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Clock/dp/B000JU8H8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Clock</a>

The real stars of the show are Jack Carson, and most especially Jane Wyman, a young married couple facing separation. Wyman steals the show during a dinner scene at a Chinese restaurant with a brief intensely honest moment of fear and terror when she can no longer cope with losing her husband to the War. A striking scene since American film during this time rarely allowed genuine emotions of spearation anxiety without defining them in purely patriotic terms.

Krashna certainly had a wonderful basic idea, and its easy to see how this film connected with couples broken apart by war. Scenes at the very end set in the White House with a cute Scottie playing Fala, FDR's famous pooch, are pleasant and attractive in their way. Maybe in the end this is one of those films were you just 'had to be there' to enjoy it.

The same basic story, told to near perfection, would emerge about ten years later when Audrey Hepburn took the movie world by storm as the next runaway princess in William Wyler's masterpiece, ""Roman Holiday"".&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roman-Holiday-The-Centennial-Collection-Mastered-in-High-Definition/dp/B001EXE2ZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roman Holiday - The Centennial Collection (Mastered in High Definition)</a>",1250121600,8,3546,5.4381818181818184

3940176,4,B002KE4ZIW,"Princess O'Rourke is one of the cute and charming little films that tends to get lost under the heavy stature of classics such as Gone With the Wind or The Adventures of Robin Hood. Not that this film deserves elevation to an equal footing with those, but this is still, well ... darn good entertainment. Princess Maria and her Uncle Holman are exiled in New York City when their country is invaded by the Nazis. Holman is quite anxious to see Maria married and a mother, producing the necessary male heir as soon as possible, but she dislikes his choice for her, Count Peter de Candome. Marie meets pilot Eddie O'Rourke, who believes her to be simply another refugee from war-torn Europe. Eddie and Marie fall in love. Holman is delighted to learn that the O'Rourke family has an amazing proclivity for producing sons, and realizing marriage to an American could cement American support for the war and their country, promotes the marriage. Granted this film is formulaic and patriotic, but that doesn't make it any less entertaining or fun. The dialogue sparkles and shimmers with quite witty banter. The cast is most excellent, especially Olivia de Havilland, who is delightful and charming; if Cary Grant was the King of romantic comedies, then surely Olivia was its Queen. Also contributing to the overall fun are Jack Carson, Jane Wyman, and Charles Coburn. The weakest link, however, seems to be the romantic lead, Robert Cummings. He isn't bad, not at all, indeed, is he good, partly because he really is the All American American. But I would have loved to see someone like Paul Muni or Spencer Tracy, who rarely dabbled in the genre, cast as Eddie; perhaps then the film really would've been as great as some of the greatest. Ten years later the very prestigious Roman Holiday was made, and if not necessarily a remake, it was certainly a tribute; both films include scenes where the unaware hero has to cope with an exhausted and incoherent heroine. Trivia Bonus: That really is President Franklin Roosevelt's famous dog, Fala, playing a key role in resolving the romance of Maria and Eddie!",1329350400,,2102,4.825484764542936
