6601899,5,B00MU3Z2E4,I absolutely loved this DVD! I went on ahead and bought the bundle set for my Pastor for Christmas. I expect some great things in the future! Glory to God!,1418601600,5,155,4.2
6601900,5,B00MU3Z2E4,"If you liked Finger of God you will LOVE Paid in Full. It is full of testimonies of healings and heart-to-heart sharing. That is good, but I love the clips where they took the camera into churches, and especially out on the streets, and filmed healings as they happened. These are clips of ordinary people who move in the healing ministry.

Towards the end of the DVD there are sections on Practical Insights, The Difficult Side Of Healing Ministry, and How to Get Started where these same people bare their hearts and share what God has taught them. When you have gotten to the credits, don't shut it off. Go to the disc menu and scroll down to the section entitled Ministry Time. These same people move in words of knowledge and prayers for healing as led by the Holy Spirit for the conditions of those who are watching the DVD.

In addition to the DVD Paid in Full there is an accompanying book Paid in Full 40-Day Healing Ministry Activation Manual that I highly recommend:

6601902,5,B00MU3Z2E4,"This movie is off the charts amazing--if I could give it 10 stars, I would do so immediately.  It contains footage from years ago, such as of A.A. Allen praying for a blind person and seeing the person healed, and then people in our time doing the same.  It contains the best footage of a person getting up out of wheel chair that I have seen yet.  There are also many first hand accounts of healings that took place.  The one of the doctor treating a victim of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti is especially touching.

They interview more than 30 people who are actively involved in healing ministries, on the street and in other places, even showing some of them in operation.  But the point is made that it is about the gospel, and it's not just a focus on healing.  Healing is not everything, but it's a very important element of our lives. It's a chance to see and experience the power and love of God first hand.  In the movie, they are also very practical and talk in depth about the question of ""What if they don't get healed when I pray?""  The only way to find out how good this film is is to watch it.

This listing of the movie on Amazon shows it as rated R (at least right now)--that must be a mistake.  I have no idea what would give it such a rating.  There is no violence.  There may be one word that was bleeped out, a reaction of somebody on the street, but as far as I am concerned, this is a movie everyone should see.",1414281600,20,1433,4.167272727272727

6601911,4,B00MU3Z2E4,"This was a very interesting DVD.  It shows the reactions of those in the ministry of healing.  And also, the reactions of the people being healed.  Most importantly it shows what actions may be taken if the healing does not work immediately.  It explains the reasons that a non-healing may occur.  I would recommend anyone interested in healing see all possibilities that they may come across as healers.",1436745600,,404,4.882352941176471
6601912,5,B00MU3Z2E4,"Great content and well-produced.  I've watched Finger of God, Furious Love and Father of Lights.  I enjoyed them all but would rate this as the best of the bunch.  And it doesn't just document healing, it teaches how to get started.",1428883200,10,232,4.609756097560975

I also wrote a few 'nuggets' that will definitely increase my own faith in believing that God created all of us to be used as vessels for healing sickness and disease.",1533859200,,321,4.696428571428571
