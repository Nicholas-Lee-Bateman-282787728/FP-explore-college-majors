666198,5,6303521231,"Ok, so it was not very true and did not stick to history, but it was a good story.  Yes, it was BASED on a true story, which means that it is based on what is said and heard, NOT entirely true.  I thought it was an  excellent story with Great horsemanship.  However, I do know a few horse  people that were a bit disturbed by the  horse killing.  But other than  that I thought it was a good movie.",963792000,2,398,3.8875
666199,1,6303521231,"I too was intrigued by this ""historical"" film, so I did a little research also. I received this statement from the US Calvary Association:
""Unfortunately, this movie is yet another example of  ""Hollywood history.""  As far as we have been able to determine,  nothing even remotely like this ever took place. The flaws in this movie,  from a historical standpoint, are almost too numerous to list.  The 12th  Cavalry was not one of the regiments that was initially mechanized.  And  when the regiments were dismounted, their horses were turned in to the  Remount Service, a branch of the Quartermaster Corps, where they were  re-issued to other units.  These remount depots were large operations,  capable of handling up to 6,000 horses.  They were not locations where you  would send cast-off sergeants or troublesome lieutenants.  As we understand  it from an interview with the writer of the screenplay, the entire story is  based on a tale he was told by three old sergeants when he was a boy, and  even he admitted that the machine-gunning of the horses was a bit of  Hollywood color added to the story.  We have done research into the  regiments, mechanization, even the officers mentioned and given  ""biographies"" at the end of the movie.  Nothing has been  unearthed to confirm that any of the events shown in the film ever took  place.  In fact, all available evidence points in just the opposite  direction. Both the U.S. Cavalry Association and the MacArthur Foundation  wrote to HBO when this movie first came out, requesting that in light of  the facts they remove the ""based on a true story"" statement from  the movie.  They never even answered our letters. So, while ""In  Pursuit of Honor"" might be a good motion picture, it is certainly not  good history.  It is truly a shame that it is still being presented as  such.

666200,1,6303521231,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, but my curiosity was aroused because at the end of this supposed ""based on a true story"" movie, it does not tell you what happens to the characters in the story.  After extensive research and speaking with the US Cavalry Association and the MacArthur  Foundation this story proved to be a LIE. The US mounted Cavalry was not  retired until the 1950s.  This event never happened and HBO should  apologize to their viewers for a blatant lie...",947808000,18,473,4.719512195121951
666201,5,6303521231,"This is a great movie where men of our country disobey an order in Pursuit of Honor to save horses that are part of the Cavalry and have been for years.  They have been ordered to put to death Cavalry horses that are no  longer needed in the Army now that times are changing.  These men feel the  horses deserve better than to be put to death for serving their country,  even though they're horses, not men.  Although these men have been  disobedient in the past, I think they become true saviors, heros and  honorable men when they disobey this particular order.  They decide they're  going to try and save their country's horses and travel miles north to the  Canadian border to set them free.  They feel these horses deserve a  retirement from the Army not be put to death for serving it.  It's a rough  and rugged trek north being pursued by the Army for disobeying.  The news  gets spread throughout the country that this is happening and the whole  country becomes interested in this pursuit.  There's laughter and tears as  they travel north In Pursuit of Honor.  I thoroughly loved this movie and  have searched for over a year to own it.  Now I can watch it over and over.  This is a great film for adults and for children to watch with supervision  for what honor means in this country.  A wonderful movie.  I recommend it  to anyone.",912124800,,1344,4.464730290456432

667108,2,6303521231,"Nice little movie, good acting, a good film to match to ""From Here to Eternity"", to bad there's no shred of truth to it. 26th Cavalry Regiment (Philippine Scouts) still had their horses when they executed a mounted charge against the Japanese in 1942. 2d Cavalry Division didn't give up their horses until 1943. The Regular Army's Field Artillery was horse-drawn until 1940, the Army National Guard's batteries until 1938. 1st Cavalry Division was not dismounted until 1942. In 1920, Congress made the Infantry responsible for tanks. All the US Army's tanks were assigned to the three Infantry Regiment (Tanks). In 1935, the US Cavalry had perhaps a dozen armored and scout cars, which is why all eighteen cavalry regiments were mounted. In 1936, the Army begin buying ""combat cars"" (light tanks for the Cavalry). It was 1937 before there were enough to mechanize a single Cavalry Regiment. By 1938, there was a 7th Cavalry Brigade (Mechanized) of two regiments and each cavalry regiment was to mechanize one of its two squadrons. At the Louisiana Maneuvers in 1940, three ""horse-mechanized"" cavalry regiments were involved. The regiments' troops that retained horses had them transported by tractor-trailers.

Yes, the US army did dismantled the cavalry in the 1930's to modernize the army, but the horses were sold as army surplus to ranchers.  In the movie it says that they ordered 500 horses to be dispose of, but at $100 per horse that was $50,000, over half a million dollars in today's money.  Why would the US Army waste $50,000 (over half a million in today's money) during the depression when the entire army was only composed of some 100,000 soldiers (including officers) operating on a shoe string budget?  Yes, today's army might be wasting a lot of money, but we are also talking about a budget in the billions while in the 30's the army's total budget was only couple million.

668100,5,6303521231,"This is an excellent movie about the turn of the century when horses were being replaced with engines and the army no longer had use for the thousands of faithful 4-legged servants.  Don Johnson and 3 soldier buddies rescued them from a bloody death in a pit under the fire of a machine gun.  There are some ghastly scene that I do not know how they film without injuring an animal that were very hard for me to watch, other than I kept telling myself it's all fake, Hollywood, but I can't stand harm coming to an animal, especially our noble creature the horse.

It's the struggle of several cavalry soldiers, ordered to have hundreds of their horses slaughtered, instead trying to save them by making a cattle drive with them to Canada.  The Army pursues them in an attempt to stop them from reaching Canada with the horses.

The diversity of characters and their strengths was projected perfectly by all the actors.

Even the 'bad guy' was excellent in portraying the inflexibility of the military though in his heart he may have wanted to 'Don Johnson' to make it.

From the onset of the movie the politics of the military, the love and honor of being part of the cavalry, the passion and regard for a cavalryman's horse, and the unbelievable drive of a few honorable men to take a chance on losing their military careers to save a few hundred horses from slaughter brings a tear to one's eyes.

A young Calvary Officer Lt. Marshall Buxton (played by: Craig Sheffer) & three old veteran Calvary SGT.s headed by Sgt.

The story brings to mention some not so well known historical events of the period, it is well written with a great cast and is just a really good story.

1) Cavalry horses were never disposed of by machine-gunning them - either they were humanely put down or sold.

2) No one ever stole cavalry horses to prevent them from being shot and then took them to Canada.

3) The U.S. Cavalry Association, an organization composed of cavalry veterans, attempted to sue the filmmakers for slander over this film.  They couldn't though, because their organization had not itself been slandered.

4) There are numerous other smaller historical inaccuracies that I don't have the energy to mention, but other reviewers already have.

It's the Great Depression, and General Macarthur is trying to turn the American army into a modern force, with the growing threat of war from across the Atlantic looming.  As part of the process, the Cavalry is changing form, and the order goes out to herd hundreds of horses to Mexico to be slaughtered.
A young, idealistic officer (Craig Sheffer) and a grizzled veteran sergeant with a conscience, decide this is inhumane and against their principles and duty, given the Cavalry's sworn duty to protect his horse.  With a handful of men at their side, they take the horses on the run.  This leads to a chase across America as the army track them with orders to do whatever is necessary to bring them back.  Rod Steiger plays the retired commanding officer who is sympathetic to the cause, and Gabrielle Anwar his beautiful daughter who is a journalist and brings the story to a wider audience.
It's not a deep portrayal of characters, but it is nonetheless a compelling story, which wins points for being told in an economical way, without undue navel gazing.  Don Johnson is terrific in the role, a far cry from his dapper toothy grinned characters elsewhere, and Sheffer just about holds his own.

Doing so, they are pursued by the Army who is bent on stopping them, or killing the men and the horses.

If this film does nothing else, the actors manage to get across so clearly the love of the men for their horses and the conviction that what they are doing is right.  Direction is superb; every frame manages to catch the tension, the terror, the anger and the beauty of the land and horses running for freedom.

Maybe there is some logic to that, but to some Calvary officers charged with the task, it went against everything they believed. After witnessing the slaughter of the first hundred of six hundred horses, these men,choosing to defy their orders, become committed to rescuing the remaining horses. The audience is taken on a difficult journey as these men herd these horses from Mexico to Montana and the border with Canada and finally into Canada. They are followed by members of the Army who would kill them for disobeying orders and stealing goverment property. What is important to understand is that these Calvary men feel that they made a commitment to these horses just by choosing to be members of the calvary. To them, when the horses became unneccessary due to changing times, they were no more expendable than a person would be. Just because a superior officer had given them an order did not mean they should carry it out when doing so would be uncaring and cruel. They way this movie is put together, it is very believable. No where did I see that this was based on actual incidents, but it certainly is that believable. Also this movie is a great reminder that in the early twentieth century the western portion of this country had vast open spaces. It was indeed possible to drive five hundred horses two thousand miles from Mexico to Canada. Try that today!

669340,4,6303521231,"In 1930 General Douglas MacArthur was appointed chief of staff of the U.S. Army and attempted to modernize the Army.  In June 1932 he used not only tanks and troops of cavalry with drawn sabers, but also infantry with fixed bayonets to attack the Bonus Army in Washington, D.C., claiming the outrageous idea of American troops attacking former members of the Army who had served in the First World War was justified because the nation was on the verge of a communist revolution.

While that infamous moment in American military history is the prologue for ""In Pursuit of Honor,"" Dennis Lynton Clark's script tells what happened in 1935 when MacArthur changed the cavalry from men on horseback to men in tanks and ordered the destruction of hundreds of horses.  The decision does not sit well with old Sergeant John Libbey (Don Johnson) and his other NCO's, but it is young Lt. Marshall Buxton (Craig Sheffer) who decides after watching the infantry gun down a hundred horses that they are not going to let the same thing be done to any more of the creatures.  For these men it is a question of honor and they think when their service is no longer required horses should be treated the same way as former soldiers.  Of course, the film's prologue amply proves that MacArthur (James Sikking) is willing to gun down old soldiers along with old horses.

Libbey is certainly an old soldier at home in the saddle and Buxton is young, a West Point graduate, but they have in common a tendency to be insubordinate when it comes to matters of honor.  Libbey refused to ride down the women and children of the Bonus Army just because ordered to do so by Colonel John Hardesty (Bob Gunton), who is the officer MacArthur sends west to do the changeover.  Buxton knows nothing about Hardesty's past, but he knows that what the Army is doing to this horses is wrong and in a split-second he makes a decision to save the rest of the horses.

Since the army base on the American-Mexican border is south of them, the soldiers take the horses north and Hardesty sets off in pursuit with his mechanized force.  Unfortunately director Ken Olin made ""In Pursuit of Honor"" for television, which means the budget for depicting an epic chase between horses and machines was never there.  There is an entire dimension to this story with regards to the disadvantages of trying to find roads to travel on in the U.S. in 1935 in pursuit of a bunch of horses.

The best parts of this television movie are out in the middle of no where with the five soldiers and their hundreds of horses.  Johnson's performance is the cornerstone of the film, caught up in the attempt to save the horses without really pausing to consider the implications of what it means for any of them.  However, the whole ideal of the big confrontation that is building throughout the film ends up becoming something of an anticlimax by the time it is finally played out, although why is not exactly clear.  While the horses are heading north we have a subplot involving Colonel Owen Stuart (Rod Steiger), the retired former leader of the cavalry, who goes to the nation's capital to try and convince MacArthur of the mistake he is making, and his daughter, Jessica (Gabrielle Anwar), a young reporter.

The suggestion is that something bigger than the military is going to save the day, but that does not really prove to be the case.  If anything, the lesson of this 1995 movie is that the honor of the U.S. Army is where it has always been, in the hearts of its non-commissioned officers.  The officers can give all the commands they want, but the sense of what is right and wrong in the military comes in the looks of not only Sgt. Libbey's companions, Sgt. Thomas Mulcahey (John Dennis Johnston), Sgt. James Shattuck (Robert Coleby), and Sgt. Sean Quinlain (Neil Melville), put a pair of non-coms who are involved in the pursuit, Sgt. Ernest Gruber (Peter Curtin) and Sgt. Nathaniel Rutherford (Brian McDermott).

In 1935 President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent MacArthur to organize the defense of the Philippines, a fact that is not related at the end of ""In Pursuit of Honor.""  Actually, there is not any sort of scroll of information at the end to let us know what happened to the participants in this true story.  But the idea that FDR would boot MacArthur to the other side of the globe for thinking shooting several hundred horses is a good idea is certainly a decision you would want to applaud (although Herbert Hoover having done it three years earlier would be even better).",1104624000,88,4528,4.663316582914573

669344,5,6303521231,"Taking into consideration the fact that most Americans don't know anything about the U.S. Army, let alone the state of the U.S. Army in the years preceeding World War II, ""In Pursuit of Honor"" is worth watching.
The film is supposed to be ""based on an actual event"", but in all actuality, the storyline is highly improbable.  For example, I can't imagine the Army unloading a ton of ordinance (which, at that time, was much more expensive than it is today) in order to stop a herd of aging horses cross over into Canada, let alone  a mechanized infantry unit pursing the same herd over half a continent.  Those elements of the film basically make no sense.
However, the depiction of the War Bonus Protesters in Washington, although a small part of the film, is something that was real.  That the Army still used mounted soldiers a that time was real.  That the Armed Forces were unprepaired to do battle with the axis powers was real.  That the Army was in transition to a more modern force under Roosevelt (who knew that the country would be at war within the decade) was real.
I suppose that if someone wanted to get really technical, certain aspects of the film aren't 100% accurate, like maybe the exact unit designation of the squadron wasn't right, but so what?  Only a U.S. Army Cavalry devotee or a member of some mutual admiration society is going to care about this.  Everyone else is going to assume that the cavalry oufit in this film is only one of other such outfits that were employed by the Army at that time.
I'd like to see more films made concerning this era and how it effected our Armed Forces, not just the Army.  An understanding of this important period of time helps to explain how and why the magnatude of the U.S.'s present armed forces came to be.
I'd recommend this film with some reservations, but otherwise, I'd say that the period of time preceeding World War II and the state our our Armed Forces has been more effectively portrayed before, in more historically accurate films like ""The Sand Pebbles"".",1073520000,3,2034,4.596685082872928
669345,5,6303521231,"this was the kind of movie i grew with. it had a story and characters i could believe in. i cant seem to find any historical background on the storyline but that's not what matters. these were people dealing with issues of right and wrong. not of ""whats in it for me"". it dealt with the dirt and misery of commitment to an ideal. it was not full of sex and blood just for the schock value. the life of a calvary man was no picnic... when a person stands up for something that matters to them, it matters that they keep standing no matter what faces them at the end. that was the message i got from this movie and made me wish we had more movies like it. this was a wonderful change from car chases and blood just for bloods sake........maryann hughes",1046476800,5,750,4.179310344827586
669346,2,6303521231,"In Pursuit of Honor is a charade. Billed as a true story it isn't as the producer and writer later admitted. The costumes and props were semi-accurate. The horse furniture, weapons and personal equipment of the horse soldiers were right on with a couple of glaring exceptions. In 1935 enlisted men did not wear orniments on their campaign hats in the field and neither did officers. Those used in the film were grossly incorrect for any period. In 1935 EM wore knee length laced (engineer) boots with flexible uppers. The collar brass was too small, etc.",1029369600,,554,4.78125

Perhaps the biggest surprise was how admirably well Don Johnson carried off the roll of a battle hardened old boot.  The director and writer ""hollywoodized"" some events and created a film which brought tears to this old sergeant's eyes.  The depiction of General MacArthur is appropo; but the body of the movie is the plight of a small contingency of men against tall odds and direct orders.
Would this country ever destroy cavalry horses?  We left behind ""legions"" of finely trained military dogs (K-9's) in Vietnam where a staple is canine flesh.  The two main excuses I was told in the field were: budget cuts and the fear of spreading heartworms.  There were innumerable instances which defied commonsense and ethics during the Vietnam War, errr, Conflict.
Reality check time. The era depicted in this film is a time of the United States history which has been clouded by agenda and spin.  There were marches in the streets, payrolls were cut, veteran benefits were cut, pensions were cut, veterans were clubbed, millions were suffering for lack of food and housing (tons of federally stored milk, butter, and cheese were destroyed instead of being distributed to the needy), as told to me by my Grandfather who served as cavalry blacksmith during and after World War I.  He later crosstrained into cooks.  Either way, he said, there was no getting away from horses....:p",1014508800,56,1483,4.9757085020242915
669348,4,6303521231,"Just for the record the 12th cavalry regiment was dismounted not mechanised on 28 feb 1943,so the threat of swapping the horse for armour is  irrelevant. There are many references to the Mexican campaign but they also  don't hold water ,the 12th cavalry simply did not participate in the  punitive expedition. The only history in this movie is the bonus march,which  blends from real footage to modern footage almost fluidly. The film is a bit  of fun and it is always nice to see the US army prior to Pearl Harbour. The  Australian outback looks wonderful as economic alternative to expensive US  location. You all probably think i hate this movie but i actually really  like it,its just not a true story and HBO should know better,but its  cavalry and it will have to do until someone makes a movie based on Marsmen  In Burma.

7849064,1,6303521231,"Wow; out of 380 people that reviewed this, only 7 other people took the time to research this and find out that it is nothing more than HBO/Hollywood liberal lies. God bless the US Public Education system; how many Third World countries rank ahead of us???
This is a perfect example of how Hollywood really operates. There doesn't have to be a shred of evidence to back up their narrative, and they will still represent their fiction as ""based on actual events"" as they did in this movie. I guess i thought the Hollywood leftists were smart enough not to tell lies that are so easily disproved. But maybe not if 373 out of 380 fell for it.
The movie grotesquely portrays a military unit in 1934 inhumanely mowing down a herd of horses with machine guns, and blames it on orders from Douglas MacArthur as part of a transition from a horse based cavalry to a mechanized cavalry. From then on the movie shows the ""heroes"" who ""hate the United States"" rescuing the horses from the evil military. And of course the other hero, FDR, also tries to save the day.
Facts: 1: MacArthur loved horses and dogs throughout his entire life; they were a passion for him. He would not have followed an order to commit such a crime, much less give it. 2: The military used a mounted cavalry until 1946, when the remaining horses were sold at auction.
It is amazing that the MacArthur family didn't sue everyone involved in producing this for the absolute lies that were represented as facts in this movie. Maybe Ken Olin could skate (he was issued his Manhood Dismissal papers in the '80 for doing Thirty Something (all the ""men"" on that show wore dresses)), because he was just following orders, but the ones who were responsible for this...
