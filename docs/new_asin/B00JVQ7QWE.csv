8654049,5,B00JVQ7QWE,"Just wanted to let everyone know ONE little detail about this release,

As of the time I'm writing this, there is no blu-ray or digital high-def release that features ""Ong-Bak"" in its original uncut version with the original Thai score. This blu-ray, and other blu-rays, features the ""French Theatrical Cut"", which is basically the version that Luc Besson made before worldwide distribution. The French version features a new hip-hop score by RZA (which preserves some aspects of the original Thai score).

So what was cut? Well, basically a subplot involving Muay's sister dealing drugs, along with a few bits of pieces of violence, most notably during the final showdown between Tony Jaa and the villain's main henchman. Some dialog and scenery was also cut.

If you want the uncut version, I can tell you personally that the only English-friendly versions out there are the DVDs by Eastern Eye/Madman (Australia), and the Cine Asia R2 DVD (UK). As far as I'm aware, both are still in print. The Australian DVD contains the complete original Thai score whereas the UK DVD has newly composed music, but is still uncut. When Ong-Bak premiered to Western Audiences in its original version, one of the biggest complaints was the overly repetitive Thai techno track.

However, if you don't mind a few insignificant cuts and you like RZA's scoring, then by all means, buy this blu-ray.",1517529600,2,1381,4.991304347826087
