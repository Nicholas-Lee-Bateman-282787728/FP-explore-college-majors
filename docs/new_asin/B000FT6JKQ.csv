8126282,5,B000FT6JKQ,Are there English subtitles to the three movies?,1491264000,,48,5.125
8126283,5,B000FT6JKQ,I own the limited edition box set that included this version. With the big black case. THIS IS THE DEFINITIVE VERSION OF THE STORY! I loved 1 & 2 (would of rather watched 2 first). But had mixed feelings about the third. As it introduces characters and places them in different parts of the timeline. And I loved the ending..... But if only there was a version that told it all in order..OH WAIT!!! THERE IS!!!  BUT WHY IS IT SO RARE?! Well I have mine. And I truly wished the world could see this version... Epic tale!,1424044800,,519,4.295918367346939
8126284,4,B000FT6JKQ,This came with my infernal affairs boxed set dvd. It tells the whole Infernal Affairs story in chronological order. It is specially edited so that the three films are seamlessly inetegrated into one long film. Buy it if you are a big fan of the series. This dvd is very hard to find.,1172534400,3,283,4.3584905660377355
8126285,4,B000FT6JKQ,"This set came out in 2005. It is strictly for die hard fans. There is a limited amount of these sets worldwide.(I forgot the number)The one that I have is similar to this but it has 8 dvds. There are 2 dvds for each film. (One is the feature film, the other is for the extras.)The seventh and eighth dvds tell the Infernal Affairs story in chronlolgical order. It is specially edited so the three films are seamlessly integrated into one long film. The set also comes with a big black hard case to store all the dvds. KEEP IN MIND! I think the set here at amazon is different becasue this is only the 6 dvd boxset. Ask them if the set contains the rare chronological dvd. If it doesn't then I wouldn't buy it.",1172534400,5,709,4.220588235294118
8126286,5,B000FT6JKQ,"I just finished watching INFERNAL AFFAIRS with my dad right now. We loved it! It was an action packed thriller with edge-of-your-seat moments.

A man is expelled from a cadet class in his teenage era, then we go to the profile of a man named Lau, a cop who's on both the cop side and the gang side steals his identity, and are chasing each other. But after becoming a mole for the gang side, These two people find themselves fighting over each other's buisness.

This is a fantastic film with plenty thrills. See it!",1160092800,,516,4.421052631578948
8126287,3,B000FT6JKQ,"When first watching this film, I was blown away with the plot and acting.  Then the 2nd and 3rd movie followed up the next year and expectation wasn't disappointed.  It's like a Hong Kong ""The Godfather"" trilogy with cops.  I hope the American remake does not disappoint its viewers much like that garbage film ""Gangs of New York"" staring Leonardo DiCraprio.  Great trilogy, great DVD, great deal.  Plus you can't find this disc set anywhere.  I looked.  The only problem with this set is that it plays in the chronological order of the trilogy.  Weird, but interesting!",1160006400,3,570,4.804123711340206
