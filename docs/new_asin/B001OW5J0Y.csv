8331642,5,B001OW5J0Y,"A wonderful and detailed review of Hanuman's life and achievements throughout the 3 ages. Incredibly thorough and educational for all ages with many lessons, morals and ethics to be learned along the way. A fine addition to ones religious 'serial' collection.",1327276800,2,259,5.341463414634147
8331643,5,B001OW5J0Y,"I completely loved this DVD series. It is undoubtedly a very large series, being 36 DVDs long. But i must say that the depth of coverage is very good, so a lot of scriptural and historical research must have gone into making this series. The number of characters is very vast and its quite hard to keep track of names and places after a while. The scope of the storyline is quite vast, understandably, so this explains the very large number of characters invoked during the narration. The series is quite fast paced, but gets a little bogged down towards the middle. Nothing too bad though.

I recommend this to all Hanuman Bhaktas, to all parents who wish their kids to learn about the life of one of the most loved Hindu characters and to many other like me who just wish to rediscover his roots. A word of caution - As soon as you buy this product, be sure to check all the DVDs by actually running them in the player. Make sure you get replacements for any non functioning DVDs.
