There were two ""Oh My G_d""'s - that stuck out because it shocked me to hear that in a kid's video - and I remember being unhappy with other parts of the dialogue but can't remember exactly what they said, but I know they were saying things I didn't like my kids hearing.

Later my husband put it on when we were at our vacation condo (I would never have let them watch it again) and rather than make a big fuss I decided to let it run a while to see what the story was, and found it even less appealing when I was watching the animation because the violence seemed pretty over the top for a kid's animated film.

I guess I'm complaining here because Amazon is the best forum I know of to warn anyone who is going to buy/rent/borrow this video that I found it very inappropriate for my 3 and 5 year old daughters.",1184803200,,1051,4.157635467980295
