181177,5,155940860X,"One of the genuine trendsetters in Action history was this 1989 Action masterpiece from one of the genre's most skilled directors. After building his own ""gun-foo"" style througout the 80s with the classics,""A Better Tomorrow(1986)"" and it's sequel in 1988, Woo hits paydirt here.

Basically retelling to some degree, Jean Pierre Melville's ""Le Samourai(1967"", Woo adds a high octane sense of action and his ever present theme of male bonding to the mix for one of the decade's classics.
The sweet story about the Hitman's attempts to fix the eyesight of a beautiful singer whom he blinded in a hit, is handled with the appropiate amount of sensitivity.

Chow Yun Fat is one of cinema's great Action heroes, at once both cool and imposing, yet full of humor and sympathy, this is still one of the actor's great performances, not equalled in sheer coolness until Woo's Hong Kong swan song with 1992's ""Hard Boiled"".

The action scenes are among the most riveting and intense ever filmed, notably the explosive climax. A masterpiece of substained mayhem that nearly reaches the operatic, this is perhaps the best gunfight we've seen since ""Bloody"" Sam Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch(1969)"".

The DVD is presented with both English language and Chinese versions and are UNCUT, however the prints utilized, leave much more to be desired. There is also audio commentary by the man himself, John Woo and Trailers for the film and Hard Boiled.

It's sad that this is out of print, especially considering it's now classic status and the amount of films that it inspired in the States that ARE still annoying us on the big screen. I reccomend that if you really want a good film, skip that Matrix-knock-off and go for this John Woo classic that started it all.

181178,5,155940860X,"This film has been categorized as an action movie with a great deal of bloodshed. Superficially this is true but Woo's masterwork can easily stand beside Once Upon a Time in the West as a beautifully shot, highly stylized film that reaches far beyond the confines of a mere genre film. The acting is superb and the editing is Academy Award level. Only the score does not quite come up to the level of Leone's films.

181179,5,155940860X,"John Woo is a director who uses a style known as Heroic Bloodshed. The messages of the movies are always in the symbols, not in the story. The movie isn't designed for those who can't look past the violence. The movies are also heavily laced with Protestant Christian themes concerning the souls of his characters, usually exagerrated for the purpose of making them larger than life. For Example: Inspector Tequila in Hard Boiled. He kills, yes. He kills a lot. But the overall message is  not the violence, it's that the hero has to do what must be done, that he values the righting of wrongs done to a weaker character. You have to read into Woo films before you can say that they are ""Garbage"", because if you understand him, they're really not. I'm sorry more people can't enjoy his movies, but sometimes you need to look past the attitude that violence is never the answer. While killing is bad, being dead and allowing others who are above the law (a problem almost alien to the modern Western World) to exploit those who can't help themselves is worse.",1221696000,2,1059,4.603174603174603

181181,4,155940860X,"John Woo:you either love him or hate him but there is no way of looking at him except as a force of nature. The Killer was one of Woo's greatest Hong Kong features; long before he came to America and made  films such as Face/Off and Mission Impossible 2.

Made on a small budget this film is an homage to the classic action directors of Hollywood. There are shades of Peckenpah and of Scorsese. The films grainy look makes it almost perfect for this genre.

The story of a killer with a penchant for justice and loyalty has been done many times before but Chow Yun Fat and Danny Lee make it their own as the killer and the renegade cop who follows him.

Many have complained about the violence in this film. The film is extremely violent but the violence comes off as campy rather than as serious. When you have two men fighting hundreds it is hard to take anything too seriously.

The disc that I reviewed was the Criterion Collection edition. This edition gives a pristine transfer of the film and has a decently subtitled audio. Beware of editions that have any English dubbing since these editions tend to heighten the camp elements of the story rather than give a true translation of the dialogue. Also note that the Criterion Edition is expensive but you get what you pay for. Some of the lower priced editions of this film are known bootlegs that should be avoided.

The disc contains a commentary track by Woo and producer Terrance Chang and five deleted scenes.

If you can find or afford it this is essential viewing for action genre fans and for fans of purist Hong Kong cinema.",1182038400,2,1589,4.496527777777778
181182,4,155940860X,"I first got interested in Woo's work after seeing ""Broken Arrow"" in 1996. I was able to get my hands on a VHS copy of The Kiiler and watched it thinking it would be at least as food as Broken Arrow.

It wasn't.

It was ten times better.

The plot is similar to the Rock Hudson film Magnificent Obsession (although Rock is not an assassin). Chow-Yun Fat is an amazing actor who portrays the title character with great depth and believability.

But let's get down to why everyone REALLY likes this film: The action scenes are AMAZING. When the shooting starts, all hell breaks loose and you'll probably have to watch the scenes in slo-mo or rewind and watch them again. There is so much going on that it's hard to beleive that anyone would be able to choreograph and film such stylistic and hectic battle scenes, but John Woo does just that.

My biggest question is, why aren't Woo's Hollywood films just as wild and stylish. Woo's Hollywood work is very good, but why are his Hong Kong features so much better? They seem to be gritty and real whereas his Hollywood features seem to be glossy and watered down.

No matter. If you like action films, this is one of the best, but be warned. This film is VIOLENT and much of the violence is very graphic, so it's not for everyone.

Also, sometimes the dialogue seems a bit hammy, but I feel that it may be because of the loss of translation when the film was dubbed in English. If you're able to, watch the original Chinese version with English subtitles. I know it's heard to read while your trying to watch the action, so watch the dubbed version a couple of time to where you pretty much know what's happening and then watch it with the subtitles. The original actors' voices convey much more emotion and intensity.",1181779200,4,1763,4.473520249221184

Chow Yun Fat blinds a woman by accident during a shootout and he feels he has to atone which makes this more than just another violent action movie. John Woo gives the movie a psychological side that you don't see too often in this genre.

181186,4,155940860X,"Tagline: ""One vicious hitman. One fierce cop. Ten thousand bullets."" Haha! Yup. That just about sums it up.

Someone once said to Quentin Tarantion, ""I suppose Woo can direct action scenes"" to which Tarantino replied ""Sure, and Michelangelo can paint ceilings."" Well, ""The Killer"" is a John Woo movie, and there were plenty of action sequences. So if you want to see what Tarantino was talking about, watch this movie.

The movie is about a killer (this may explain the title) who accidentally blinds a girl during a gunfight. He feels bad after that and befriends her so that he can help her get an operation for new eyes. The only trouble is, she needs money; he should have money coming to him for a hit he performed, but the guy who hired him to do the hit doesn't seem to want to give him the money. And the cops are hot on his trail.

This movie may have one of the highest body counts of any action film I have seen. The action sequences are what this movie is all about; they are so over the top I have a hard time knowing how to describe it. You have one guy (the Killer) with a pistol and he single handedly kills 30+ other guys with machine guns, shotguns, grenades etc. Every time a bad guy gets shot there is a huge spray of blood. Every time someone reels backwards or jumps into the air the movie goes into slow motion mode.

The action scenes have energy; I'll give them that but they seemed a little cluttered to me. It was hard to get an understanding of where everyone was and what they were doing. Maybe that's what Woo was trying to do. I personally like to know where all the key players are and what their strategies are, but that's just me. This movie was a triumph of melodrama; so much so that it kind of took me out of the movie. I kept thinking ""Wow. He single handedly shot 15 machine-gun guys with that little revolver of his; he is an amazing shot but all those dead guys really stink. Maybe they need to train more.""

Better than Hard Boiled because it has car chases, Chow Yeun Fat use two pistols on most of the action scenes with slow-mo, the story is interesting and EASY to understand, The images, camera angles and movements, and the special effects are SO MUCH better than Hard Boiled.

181190,5,155940860X,"A number of things passed through my mind while viewing ""The Killer"".  Firstly, director John Woo, with the possible exception of ""Face/Off"", never approached the brilliance in his American endeavors that is on display here.  Chow-Yun Fat's screen charisma was never exploited in his American films.  Lastly, Quentin Tarantino knows how to borrow from the best.  This flick is just a rush from start to finish.  The action setpieces are ingeniously staged.  Characterization, unlike in alot of Western action films, is not compromised for pyrotechnics.  The film's title character is involved in two poignant relationships that are focal to the story, one involving a girl he blinded at a hired hit and another with a maverick police officer played very effectively by Danny Lee.  This film is a success in every aspect.",1127260800,5,820,5.159090909090909
181201,5,155940860X,"'The Killer' is rightly considered one of the greatest action movies ever.  Personally, my vote for greatest action movie would have to go to 'Aliens', but 'The Killer' definitely isn't far off.  The main reason 'The Killer' is so fantastic is because Woo understands what an action movie oughta be.  It's not about the explosions or car chases, though an action movie certainly can benefit from these things.  It's about the shooting.  Lots and lotsa shooting.  And this movie's got that.  And yet, it's got a lot of human interest, and it's even kind of touching, at times.  (Though the stuff with Jenny's blindness is perhaps a bit too melodramatic.)  Yun-Fat's Jeffrey is pretty much the ultimate action hero, as he gets the standard action hero mix just right:  He's tough and ruthless enough to be really cool, but still has enough of a heart that you can like him personally.

Perhaps the next greatest key to 'The Killer's success is the fantastic pacing.  Most action movies have all the good violence stuffed into a couple scenes, and much of the rest of the movie is actually pretty boring and uneventful.  'The Killer' avoids these flaws by being pretty fast paced, and not making any of the individual action scenes prior to the climax too long.  The  action's never far off, and no seen is ever dragged out longer than it needs to be.  That and, again, it actually has character's worth caring about, unlike most action movies, so the non-action scenes are actually of some interest.

Though Woo's style is immensely influential, none can match it.  Though he cites a number of influences, he could most basically be described as Peckinpah taken to the next level, with the countless edits, multiple angles and alternation between slow motion and regular speed that that description implies.  Also, he manages to ratchet up both the gruesomeness and the elegance in these scenes simultaneously.  And, finally, he manages to make the scenes as frantic and as wild as possible without losing any coherence.  (Take note, modern filmmakers.)  Personally, I think the first shootout may be the best one, though it perhaps just makes the biggest impression from being first.  The closing one is perhaps slightly too much, but it's still quite awesome.  Also the scene between Jeffrey and Sydney, just after he's been betrayed, ahh, fantastic, particularly the major reversal.  Best moment in the film.

Ehh, action movies are too hard to review.  Just remember, this is an action movie taken back to the basics (i.e. the shootout) but taken about as far as possible at the same time.

181208,5,155940860X,"Filled with grit, emotion, and psychological depth, not to mention lots and lots of blood, ""The Killer"" is the kind of passion play that is seen all too rarely in any style of film, let alone the action genre.  In fact, John Woo's Hong Kong shoot-'em-up masterpiece resembles nothing so much as Shakespeare with thousands of bullets flying around.  In this case the role of the tragic hero is assumed by Jeffrey, played in career-defining fashion by Chow Yun-Fat.  Jeffrey is an amiable enough sort, who also just happens to be a fearless, unstoppable assassin with a steely glare and a deadly accurate shot.  But when he accidentally blinds a lovely torch singer named Jenny while mowing down about a dozen criminals in a crowded bar, Jeffrey finds some new meaning in his life by assuming responsibility for the woman, even going so far as to try to get her a vision-restoring cornea transplant.  However, everything is far from hunky-dory for Jeffrey and his ward: after committing one last job to get the money for Jenny's operation, Jeffrey finds himself pursued by a small army of thugs as well as Chang and Li, two relentless detectives.  Oh, and his best friend and associate Sidney has (temporarily) betrayed him.  With all that's going on, the stage is set for a struggle on an operatic scale, with Chow giving his character just the right mix of warmth and gravity.

As one would expect from a film directed by Woo, with Chow in the starring role, ""The Killer"" contains more than its fair share of shootouts and chase scenes, all filmed with Woo's signature frenetic visual style.  However, it's what happens when the movie slows down that sets it apart from the pack.  ""The Killer"" is as much a drama as it is an action yarn, and it's a mighty good drama at that.  There are a bunch of scenes here that got my adrenaline flowing, but even more impressive, it's mixed with the kind of legitimately moving scenes that are almost impossible to find in Hollywood movies.  Behind the constant action is an often-moving tale of devotion, honor, redemption, and friendship in the unlikely setting of the criminal underworld.  The lines between good and bad, right and wrong, cop and criminal, are all blurred in a haze of moral ambiguity and divided loyalties.  While Jeffrey and Sidney attempt to restore trust after Sidney's betrayal, an unlikely bond forms between Jeffrey and Li as the detective and the assassin realize they're not that different after all.

As the story unfolds, building toward the inevitable confrontation, the tension and the emotional stakes only rise along with the body count.  Woo manages to elevate the crime drama to poetry, whether during a taut action sequence or a subdued conversation scene.  The movie's deservedly legendary finale, involving a crazed gun battle inside a church, is the only appropriate conclusion.  The viewer certainly needs some catharsis after such a harrowing journey, and Woo more than delivers the goods.  ""The Killer"" is one of the few movies of its ilk that can legitimately be called art.",1083456000,19,3057,4.866795366795367

He takes on one last job to pay for an operation which will hopefully restore her sight and allow them to start a new life together.  However, a tough Dirty Harry style cop (played with conviction by Danny Lee) who has been assigned to protect the target, and the gangsters who are behind the hit have other plans.  No punches are pulled.  The violence is completely appropriate to the goings on and the action expertly staged making great use of long, medium, and claustrophobically close shots letting you know at all times how the characters are feeling emotionally whether on the chase or on the run.  The gunplay is truly balletic and the actors ""act"" like human beings who know the fear and power these weapons instill.  One of the best examples of the extended chase ever put on film occurs during Chow Yun Fat's attempt to assassinate the target protected by Danny Lee.  Never have both a protagonist and antagonist proven more worthy of audience fandom and involvement due to the onscreen competentence and mutual respect each character posesses.  Watch from the edge of your seat as a little girl gets caught in the crossfire between Chow Yun Fat (the killer and the human) and the triad that betrays him.  Your heart will pound as Chow Yun Fat tries in desperation to get her to safety.  THE KILLER is a true MOTION picture and fully utilizes the capabilities of the motion picture camera to tell its story.  It is more than just a Hong Kong action film.  The cinematic nonverbals transcend all language barriers and can be understood in any part of the world.
John Woo is a master director and THE KILLER shows him at his finest.  It's a shame that he, like Jackie Chan, has been working here in America for the past several years and has not been given the opportunity to be the total filmaker that he is capable of.  In Hong Kong they were the masters, here they are simply doing the best they can as laborers.  THE KILLER shows why Chow Yun Fat is one of Asia's most revered actors.  He ranks right up there with Olivier, DeNiro, and Pacino in his ability to play a wide range of truly memorable characters.  Unfortunately, as is the case with Woo and Chan, his American films too have been so-so at best.  His first, THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, a pale Americanized revamping of THE KILLER has slowed down his success not allowing him to hit the American ground running as he could have.  Thank goodness Ang Lee snatched him up momentarily from a limbo land of mediocrity to create another memorably different role in CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON.
I keep hoping and praying that the great talents of Hong Kong who want to make pictures for American audiences get the chance to do it right.  Wouldn't it be great to see Hong Kong action films in English (not dubbed or subtitled) with the budget and technology that we have here?  Better yet wouldn't it be great if these Hong Kong masters worked together in American films?  Imagine John Woo directing Chow Yun Fat as a crime boss pitting Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh against Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and Yuen Biao!  The possibilities are endless.
Hollywood has noticed the popularity of Hong Kong's style of action but so far has merely tried incorporating it into Western pictures where it doesn't really seem to belong.  They let Hong Kong choreographers train young image-but-no-real-substance actors for a few weeks or months for films, but the action has always seemed a little manufactured with the actors merely going through the motions without having solid foundations in this type of art.  The veterans of Hong Kong action have lived with this kind of action for so long that it is a part of their film vocabulary and THE KILLER is a great starting place for anyone who wants to see true Hong Kong action.",1076025600,2,4105,4.687587168758717
181210,4,155940860X,"Jeffrey (Yun Fat Chow from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) is a professional killer who after being hired to do one last job finds himself being hunted down by the men he works for.  The same plot has been copied many times but what makes this film unique is that it is a story about friendship, trust and conscience.
Jeffrey is a calm, cool and collected professional killer who does his job well but we see from the very beginning of the film that he carries a burden around with him.  After Jeffrey's first contract in the film, he has painful flashbacks of the incident, so after that, he will never be the same.  He then decides that his next contract will be his last so he reluctantly takes the assignment for 1.5 million dollars.  But then things get complicated because the same men that he works for decide to try to kill him before he gets paid.  The middle man in the story (the man who pays Jeffrey) is caught between being loyal to his boss or being loyal to his friend (Jeffrey).  There is also a cop chasing Jeffrey who comes to admire him, but can his friendship with Jeffrey prove to be his undoing or work in his favor?",1075939200,,1137,4.3649289099526065

The movies almost 2 hours long and there are several slow parts. The action sequences are by far the highlight of this movie. Unlike Hollywood movies, the hero is not some muscle-bound Austrian who simply dispatches bad guys with a few shots and then says some sarcastic remark. In The Killer, Chow yun fat is a normal looking person who pumps an entire clip into some thug, who then crashes through a plate glass window or flies over a railing. The battle at the church and the first assassination scene are some of the greatest fight scenes on film. The camera work is great and the subtitles are okay. One of the things you have to realize that the violence is supposed to be over the top and outrageously violent, but the violence is never ridiculous. I don't think that people should complain about violence in Hollywood without noting that other countries make far more violent and explicit movies than the U.S. does.",1065916800,,1081,4.606217616580311

John Woo showcases his amazing ability to do a fantastic action scene with only 6 people involved. in a nutshell it is a story of redemption, friendship, honour and love, telling us that it is always better to do the right thing, the climax wrenches a tear from the eye every time. some accuse this film of being overly sentimental, and the style is an acquired taste, but if you love movies with a strong moal streak, and love beautifullyh choreographed gunplay, then by all means, this is the film for you",1062633600,,729,4.488721804511278

181215,5,155940860X,"Long before John Woo directed Face/Off, Windtalkers, Broken Arrow, etc was this movie. In 1989, he created a film that would surpass all action movies, and even today, has yet to meet a film that can compare.
In 'The Killer', Chow Yun-Fat's hitman character blinds a nightclub singer doing what was supposed to be his final hit. Out of sympathy and love, he attempts to pay a hefty amount of money to correct her eyesight, but has to overcome the hardest trials of his life to do so.
John Woo incorporates his classic parallelism & two sides of the law themes into this film, and they work perfectly. And even though this movie can be melodramatic at times, it does not detract from the movie at all. The actors here are top-notch, and the movie is superbly paced. Not to mention there is a gunfight every ten minutes or less.
If you ever wanted to see dual-fisted pistol action, this is your ticket. John Woo makes every gunfight into a work of art, and it is ultra stylish and magnetic. The last battle in the cathedral is quite possibly the best action scene ever created.
I give this title a well earned 5 stars.",1053993600,,1116,4.4754901960784315
181216,5,155940860X,"Despite what many critics might claim, John Woo isn't a particularly ""deep"" director.  While his films mine those hallowed pits of existentialism and its inherent links to violence a bit more capably than many other ""smart"" action movies, his use of symbolism is at best a tad heavy-handed, and at worst unbearably suffocating.  The Killer was perhaps the best example of this, what with its heavy use of religious iconography and Jeff's (Chow Yun-Fat) predilection for white clothing near the end of the movie, a ham-fisted visual approach to indicate Jeff's intended departure from his old life (a suit which predictably becomes splattered with more and more blood as the climax approaches).
However, does any of that matter?  Heck no!  Not when the direction is this stylish, the actors this good, and nearly every single scene just screams that utterly undefinable concept of ""cool.""  An impossible number of bullets fly, the heroes survive against incalculably impossible odds (and with panache to spare, no less!) and exploding fuel canisters are placed in the oddest of places.  Woo has an uncanny ability to craft delicate, ballet-like action sequences that will leave the viewer absolutely breathless, scenes which are undoubtedly helped by principal actor Fat's familiarity with Woo's technique (for example, you will notice Fat much more at ease with his character and movements than he was in, say, A Better Tomorrow I or II).
And that is, perhaps, what makes the Killer so utterly watchable and such a thrill to watch repeatedly - the elevation of style over substance (a sensibility that Woo would only take to new heights in his next film Hard Boiled).  The undertones of the story take a backseat to the hyper-kinetic gunplay, and logic has been soundly banished into the realm of heart-felt dramas and gritty war chronicles.  Guns have a seemingly inexhaustable supply of ammunition, reloading is for chumps, and one bullet is simply never, ever enough to kill someone properly.  Nearly 14 years later, The Killer still remains a hallowed benchmark to judge all other action movies against, and it is in this reviewer's humble opinion that no other movie of recent make, no matter how many of Woo's moves their respective directors might have copped, can begin to approach The Killer's majestic, even poetic dance of violence.",1050796800,,2343,5.096605744125326

The action takes place at break-neck speed, but often slows to the all-too-familiar Hollywood slow-motion style.  Oops.  Actually, Hong Kong cinema invented the slo-mo and John Woo is its most gifted expositor.  Though he has used it less successfully in his American films (FACE/OFF, the awful BROKEN ARROW), Woo's techniques were honed in Hong Kong, and best displayed in this 1989 action masterpiece.  The colors in the film are brilliant and jarring.  The action in this film is visceral and cathartic.  The story has some interesting twists, but the main attractions here are the all-out gun battles that shred the screen.  Easily better than 99% of American action films, THE KILLER is a great vehicle for a pre-CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON/REPLACEMENT KILLERS Chow Yun-Fat.  This film has to be seen to be believed.

181219,4,155940860X,"This movie is perhaps the best example of an action movie that still retains a story. Woo's characters actually posess emotions and are not just stock characters that shoot each other.
My only problems with the DVD are on the technical side. First of all, the video (1.85:1) should have been anamorphic, but like all of Woo's other HK flicks, they are not. The video quality is not spectacular compared to other restorations of older movies (the criterion of Robocop is a good example), but it is far superior to a VHS copy.
The audio remains in its original mono format. The soundtrack, especially the beginning of the film, is very unique. I hoped for a 5.1 or at the least a Dolby Surround mix, but at least you get the option of listening to the original language track. I HATE dubbed movies!

The music , the imagery , it all blends together to make one magnificent film.  If there is one thing I don't understand , is that some people rag on the fact that Sally Yeh's music is played continously throughout the movie.

 I'll be honest. It is a very bloody and violent movie. But the intensity between Danny Lee and Chow Yun Fat has seldomly been paralelled anywhere in cinema.

However, if you don't like guns then I have to say that this movie is not for you. Because John Woo definitely does like guns - lots of guns - firing incalculable numbers of bullets in all directions at every opportunity. Not surprisingly it's a violent movie, but not an especially gory one. Although the body count is high, ""The killer"" definitely oozes more style than blood and its many action sequences are all filmed with tastefully impeccable attention to detail.
It's essentially a film about redemption. Chow Yun Fat stars as a hit man with a heart. Hired to kill a gangster in a nightclub, during the shoot-out which follows he fires his gun too close to the face of the club singer who is blinded by the blast. Haunted by what he has done he keeps returning to the club, gets to know the singer (without revealing his guilty secret) and sets about raising enough money to pay for an operation which will restore her sight.
After his next job he finds himself double-crossed and pursued by deadly killers from both sides of the law and eventually forms an uneasy alliance with the cop who is initially out to nail him.

The commentary recorded by John Woo and producer Terence Chang is highly instructive. So the suspicions that had appeared in the movie lover's attentive mind during certain scenes of THE KILLER are confirmed by the director himself. THE KILLER is an homage to director Jean-Pierre Melville's LE SAMOURAI and John Woo confesses his veneration for the french Master.

The scene most implanted in my mind was the eerie haunting image of the church caught in the middle of a raging storm as the lightning flashes and Sally Yeh's song looms in the background. John (Chow Yun-Fat) was fantastic as the heroic cold blooded killer which leaves him torn between fighting for good and evil. He commits himself to Jennie (Sally Yeh) after he accidently leaves her blind during a gun fight in a night club where Jennie performs as a singer. John's conscience overwhelms him, giving him the compassion to help Jennie, trying to get the money to restore her eye sight. John's awkward relationships with his triad member friend Sydney (Kong Chu), and Inspector Li (Danny Lee) complicates the story more and allows us to understand the situation John is caught in more in-depth.

After this, watch HARD BOILED, and you'll see what I mean. That movie is simply fantastic, with a great storyline.
Chow Yun Fat is the man, no doubt about it. His performance makes this movie one to remember. The movie obviously does not have the budget of a big, Hollywood production, and some of the cinematic quality and production editing suffers as a result. The story line is fairly decent, but the police bureaucrat and mob boss antagonists were so over the top and underdeveloped that they seemed silly. The assassin friend, played by Chu Kong was both well-written and performed; it's too bad he didn't get more screen time. The dubbed version isn't all that bad.

I knew he had collaborated with John Woo on a bunch of films in Hong Kong, but I was weary of John Woo after seeing Mission Impossible 2.  Boy, was I wrong.  This movie rocks.
Chow Yun-Fat plays a assasin who is basically trying to get out of the killin folks business.  The result is he has to kill MANY more people to do that.  In the backround is his old partner who betrayed him, a vengeful cop on his tail, and the women he accidentally shot and blinded that he is now in love with.  In the foreground is some of the awesomest, loudest, bloodiest, guns smokin, bullets blazin, mayham ever captured on film. It really is something to behold.

We really feel for Chow Yun-Fat and Danny Lee as their characters gradually come to realize they're not so different.

Another is the interaction between Danny Lee and Chow Yun-Fat. It sounds campy and formulaic, but turns out to be emotional and very touching, in which a true friendship forms between the killer and cop. Chow Yun-Fat is one of my favorite actors, and undeniably, one of the coolest around, and definately is one of the elements that elevates the film to greatness. The action scenes are superbly done, with a biting sense of realism attached to them. The film is well-writtten, without one senseless moment, and Lowell Lowe's music is quite memorable.

The film's considerable power lies in the staging of the action scenes and Woo's confident use of the camera.  They transcend the story and some of the more absurd elements of the action (ie, handguns that fire more bullets than most police departments could afford) and give iconic power to the characters.

181267,5,155940860X,"Just like the first Die Hard in the states began the whole genre of action flicks back in 1987, John Woo's cinematic masterpiece The Killer sets the stage for this genre of movies in the east back in 1989 and is a continual inspiration for moviemakers even now and will to come. The combination of John Woo and Chow Yun-Fat is a lethal one - Woo's knack for visual story-telling in his own unique manner of angles, manipulation of motion, use of religious icons or even just plain silence brings a new dimension of technical excellence, coupled with Chow Yun-Fat's execution of his character with poise, charisma, heart and style results in an excellent tale about an assassin with a conscience, a tortured soul who is trying to redeem himself. The action scenes are incredible, carefully executed and choreographed in a visual-stunning way. Woo is definitely the man. So many Hollywood movies try to rip this style off, actually Woo even rips himself off in his American movies. (especially Mission Impossible 2 which was a definite flop for Hong Kong fans). Forget Cruise and bring in Chow. That's the winning combination in the long run, not some American wanna-be action star. Chow just has the charisma needed to give life to the character and Woo knows how to exploit that into a meaningful story.  Regarding the audio and video quality of the DVD, the audio, though recorded in mono back in 1989, could have been digitally remastered looking at today's technology and turned into Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, albeit somewhat emulated. The video transfer is pretty well done. High quality, if you think about material made from 1989. Nice transfer. And there is a nice menu. Decent extras.

The music isn't corny like the kind heard in most other Heroic Bloodshed actioners.  The cinematography is fantastic, thanks to veteran cinematographer Peter Pao, who is without a doubt in my mind, one of the best in the world (If you have a chance, check out films like Savior of the Soul,The Bride with White Hair, and  soon to be released in theaters- Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.....You'll soon understand what I'm talking about).  The action sequences, of course, are staged to perfection, and the acting, particularly that of Chow Yun Fat, is top notch.  This was the film that introduced me to Hong Kong Action Cinema.

From that day forward there has never been nor will  their ever be a greater action movie. The slow and almost trance like  action this film has with the amazing double gun action and Chow-yun fat's  wit and charm make this picture perfect in every shape and form.

181284,5,155940860X,"John Woo holds the distinction, not only of being the top director of actions films, probably in the history of the cinema, but of having made the quintessential movie of the genre.  ""The Killer,"" made in 1989, is  quite simply, the perfect action film.  Featuring an outstanding  performance by star Yun-fat Chow, as Jeff, the killer of the title, it is a  showcase of the specific action sequences by which the standard for the  entire industry has since been formulated.  But what makes it truly  remarkable, is that the story lives up to the action, as well.  Chow is a  professional killer who accidentally blinds a young singer, named Jennie  (Sally Yeh), during the fulfillment of a contract.  Filled with remorse  over the incident, he befriends her, and ultimately begins to care deeply  for her.  Up to this point in his life, he has killed people he believed  deserving of their fate, but now he's changed; he's beginning to comprehend  the sanctity of life.  There is one more contract he must fulfill, however,  for which he is to be paid one-and-a-half million dollars, after which he  will retire from the life and see to it that Jennie gets the cornea  transplant that will restore her vision.  Further conflict arises, though,  when the man who hired Jeff decides to have him killed as well, thereby  saving him some money, and tying up what he considers to be some loose ends  in the bargain.  Never before, or since, has such extreme violence been  so well integrated into the story, in any film; and Woo's sense of measure  is impeccable.  The violence is only as graphic as necessary, in order to  be effective in any given scene, and the gunfights are choreographed with  such precision and timing that it's like a kind of visual poetry.  Woo, in  fact, has given a lyrical, almost wistful feel, overall, to the film, which  accentuates the contrast between the romance and the violence even more.  His deft use of slow motion in the action sequences, and imagery  (especially in the scenes which take place in a church), are further  examples of the artistry and detail that make this such a great movie.  The  care taken with the story itself is a rare thing for a film of this genre;  not to say that action films, in general, are typically wanting in plot or  characterization, but in most cases, more often than not the story does  defer to the action.  But not in this one.  Jeff's epiphany, for instance,  and his feelings for Jennie, are played without the least bit of misplaced  sentiment or pretentiousness, for which credit must be given to Woo and his  stars; in the hands of lesser talent, it could all have easily played out  as maudlin and sappy, and been used as nothing more than a framework upon  which to build the action.  The supporting cast includes Kenneth  Tsang, Chu Kong, and Danny Lee, who gives an especially impressive  performance as Lieutenant Li.  ""The Killer,"" is simply nothing less than  the definitive film of it's genre, the ""Citizen Kane,"" if you will, of  action films.  Even given the subjective nature of cinema, this film is so  well done, and Woo has obviously made such an impact in his field, that it  must be considered as one among the all-time great movies in the history of  film.  This is a must-have for any serious video collection.",960940800,17,3307,4.678321678321678
181285,5,155940860X,"Anybody who enjoys furiously paced action mixed with superb drama and almost balletic violence should see this film. Probably Woo`s finest and most popular ""heroic bloodshed"" piece, it details the life of a  hitman, Chow Yun Fat, and his policeman rival, Danny Lee. Woo tells his  tale in typical flamboyant style, blending incredible action sequences with  slow motion and stills. At times the beauty of the violence amazed me. As  Chow Yun Fat is pursued by both the mob and the police he manages to  present a likeable hero in a tragically difficult situation. The  fascinating relationship  (and obvious similarities) between the two  leading men is brilliantly drawn out through the use of many interesting  ""gaze"" shots, long trakes and close ups. As intense drama,  friendship and tragedy unfold in the midst of a terrifyingly brutal world  the pace of the film is guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat  right until the magnificent climax. Without spoiling, let me say that the  finale is one of the greatest action sequences that I have ever witnessed  on celluloid.

181286,4,155940860X,"Recent action movies are heavily influenced by the HK Action genre and  John Woo in particular, especially as Woo makes more movies for North  America. Often the origins of some sequences in such recent action movies  is not clear. For example in MI2, Tom Cruise has just waved off the  helicopter trying to pick him up from the chemical storage island and  suddenly two motorcycles come leaping out of nowhere. Most people will ask,  ""Where did those motorcycles come from?"" If you have seen The  Killer, the more accurate question is, ""Why are there only two  motorcycles?""
Since HK action has much smaller budgets than US  productions, the directors use different ways of creating ""big""  action without eye popping special effects. One of the staples is an  inexhaustible supply of bad guys - after the hero deals with two, ten more  show up (these ten seem to tell their friends, and so on and so on). As an  enhancement, these bad guys also come on motorcycles and in cars.
The  Killer also answers why movies often have the hero and the hero's rival  pointing guns at each other's heads. The Killer has a sequence where Chow  Yun-Fat (the killer) and the police officer chasing him end up in the  apartment of Yun-Fat's love interest. She's been partially blinded by an  accident and can't see them. They have formed a mutual admiration for each  other and are hesitant to shoot each other, but more than willing to point  guns at each other. They dance around for a while, until Yun-Fat escapes.  This also provides another answer to Scott's question in Austin Powers of  why Dr. Evil doesn't shoot his nemesis... in HK action movies, the hero and  his nemesis often become friends.

Woo is a master craftsman, who can be compared, without any loss  on his part, to the likes of Francis Ford Coppola, Oliver Stone and Martin  Scorsese. His achievement lies in his unique style of filmaking, an  exquisite sensibility for symbolic allusion and an aesthetic approach to  violence. For many years a moving force in Hong Kong cinema, he has been  embraced by Hollywood and justly admired for his genius.

Love, friendship, betrayal, and of course, shoot out  scenes are all here with a taste of the eastern culture.  This culture is  seen from the very beginning to the very end.  Woo's english movies are  great, but are missing the flavor in order to gear the movie toward  american audiences.",947203200,,587,4.958762886597938
181307,5,155940860X,"This is Woo's second finest hour, but get the Criterion DVD, as it has Woo talking you through his imagery and symbolism, as well as 5 deleted scenes, one of which is actually interesting and important (and shouldn't have been  cut). The only caveat is that picture quality ain't all that great, but  it's a small price to pay, frankly. Auctions are your best bet.",945129600,,364,4.584615384615384
181308,5,155940860X,"A perfect blend of action and story. The Killer is John Woo's best movie. The gun fights are done better than ever. It's kind of like dancing while pasting someone's guts on the wall. If you don't get this one and your a  John Woo fan than you should be drug out into the street and shot. So buy,  care for it, and well watch it.",941587200,,329,3.9696969696969697

181310,5,155940860X,The Killer...What can I say? This is probably Chow Yun Fat's AND John Woo's greatest movie. I was just wondering though if anyone knows where I can get hold of the Criterion edition. It would be much appreciated as I am  a BIG BIG fan of both Chow and Woo.,939427200,,256,4.12
181321,5,155940860X,"What can i say about the killer that hasn't already been said. It's the perfect blend of action and story, done with such love for the genre, and a real feel for characterization above the beautifully staged scenes of  balletic violence. BAsed on Jean Pierre Melville's Le Samourai. Chow yun  Fat/John Woo/Danny Lee/Tsui harks finest jobs on a single film. This film  is beautiful, 'nuff said. If your able to pick up the Criterion collection  version, Do so! I found it in a local record shop which stocks DVD's. The  title is currently out of production due to a liscencing problem. Features  deleted scenes, which I had to own.",932688000,,630,4.73394495412844
181322,5,155940860X,"With this film John Woo puts the abysmal Heroes Shed No Tears (one of the worst movies this film buff has ever seen) firmly behind him.
The key ingredient was simple:  Sincerity.  Woo's sense of humour -- or perhaps  that of his writers -- has never been all that attractive, veering towards  the lowbrow, and coupled with his hyperviolent action scenes makes for some  incredibly awful moments of farce.
The Killer and Bullet in the Head are  where Woo makes no attempt at all to put in any comedy to  ""commercialize"" his work.  So no coincidence that they remain his  best films.  Chow Yun-fat nailed the intense crisis of conscience of the  titular role and is well supported by arrow-straight Danny Lee, classy Chu  Kong and delicate workhorse actor Kent Chang.
Woo's action choreography  reached its apex with The Killer.  The most unusual thing about this film,  however, is its look -- grainy, red-tinted, dirty, it's a perfect visual  choice for the story.  Lowell Lo's nostalgia-soaked score also plays well  in the context.  And as a cinematic document, some of the sequences will  blow you away.  Some of The Killer's strongest shots are offered up during  the non-action scenes -- the parallel panorama of Eagle Lee and Jeff, for  example, is pure cinematic beauty.
Woo's work since then hasn't quite  matched up to this masterpiece (Hard Target and Hard Boiled were especially  weak).  See it to see what is probably the most distinctive action director  in complete artistic control, going for broke in expressing his view of the  world.",928108800,,1551,4.884169884169884
181323,5,155940860X,"The Killer, starring Chow Yun Fat and Danny Lee( a team-up first seen in City on Fire), is a fine example of John Woo's ability to make the most violent scenes appear elegant and inspiring.  The final shoot-out is filled  with brilliant images, a statue of Mary is blown apart by a hired killer,  and as the action takes place orchestra music is played in the background,  thus adding to Woo's artistic intent.  The quality of the Criterion DVD is  flawless and there are even deleted scenes from the original print.",923616000,,516,4.615384615384615
181324,5,155940860X,"Not your typical American action film, John Woo creates high art with his choreographed gun battles with more rounds shot than all the Die Hard movies together.  Those of you looking for a Hong Kong version of  ""Face/Off"" need not read further, those of you who like to be  challenged and provoked by film must see this movie.  Truly a masterpiece  of modern film.  This is not a movie for the faint of heart, but neither is  it for the $50million dollar hero gets girl at the end crowd. Chow Yun-Fat  is at his most compelling in this film.  To convince the audience a bad guy  can truly be good and just is his ultimate feat.
On par with ""A  Better Tomorrow"" and ""Bullet in The Head"".",917654400,,686,4.322834645669292

The final shootout reminded me of the final scene from The Wild Bunch....blasting their way to freedom.  Just a terrific final act.  The film is also touching in a sense, in that the main character is trying to get out of the business and of course develops a relationship with a beautiful singer.  This is a good film.",1467417600,,447,4.45679012345679
7796024,4,155940860X,"Much like what Sergio Leone did for ''spaghetti westerns', John Woo put his stamp on 'Sweet And Sour Easterns' with this film. Yun Fat Chow certainly has this coolness and likability about him. And Danny Lee as well, as the unrelenting cop in pursuit. As violent and sickeningly sweet this movie is, it's also quite funny in places. The photogenic standoff where the cop confronts the killer at the blind love's abode is brilliantly suspenseful and hilarious. And may well be the antithesis for Mike Judge's 'Beavis & Butthead' (Though in this, Butthead & Numb Nuts has a better ring to it.) Over the top, yes! Overly sappy, yes! Overly violent, hell yes! But also very touching, funny and sad in many places. All in all, a fun movie that shows the many sides to John Woo.",1453852800,,772,4.642335766423358
7796025,4,155940860X,"""The Killer"" is a blood-soaked action film about a professional killer who accidentally blinds a young lounge singer during a job. A soft-hearted man, the Killer is portrayed to perfection by Chow-Yun Fat. The Killer, Ah Jong, does the best he can to take care of the girl, following her injury, including pulling off another job to pay for her eye surgeries. But as in most action films, it's never easy to pull off that one last job, and soon his former business partners, as well as the police and his financial backers, are all after him.

The film is excessively violent, so it's not for everyone. Still, the movie is well-worth the time invested.",1443657600,,652,4.6695652173913045
