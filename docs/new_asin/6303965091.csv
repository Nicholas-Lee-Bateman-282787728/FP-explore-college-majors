766183,5,6303965091,"Easily Mariah Carey's best performance, right at the peak of her career and arguably before she got weird. The opener is exciting and her voice, intonation and expression are absolutely impeccable. I could hardly expect anything better from a well-rested performer behind the closed doors of a studio. If you're an 80's or 90's kid almost every song will be nostalgic.",1363046400,,368,5.049180327868853

I thought be getting this DVD there would be songs that weren't exactly aired on the FOX special but NO its the same thing. It is an excellent performance she is BEAUTIFUL but the audio is so corrected. What is the point of calling it LIVE if you are correcting the audio???

766230,5,6303965091,"With no regard to other aspects of her career, of which I know nothing, Fantasy proves a fine showcase for a personable singer with the gospel sound in her voice. The 60 minute duration allows no time for a letdown or lull in entertainment quality as the star and a sizable cast sing and dance their way into one's favor. Ears unaccustomed to the intonations of the voice, which sacrifices clarity to vocal embellishment, in the common modern mode, will still find pleasure in the performance. Whether one enjoys the brief insertions of the star ""up front and personal""  is a matter of taste. There are not enough to cause a measurable degree of frustration for most viewers. Over-all, a show easy to recommend.",1262044800,,711,4.733870967741935
766231,3,6303965091,"Fantasy DVD was quite a letdown based on my expectations. Columbia didn't do enough to showcase the exceptional talent of Mariah Carey.

After her Daydream album, Mimi's voice got more strained and her image started to change, she just wasn't the same woman I adored as a youngster. Mariah's concert on this particular DVD is pretty much flawless, great performances include: Fantasy, Open Arms, Dreamlover, Without You, Vison of Love, and Always Be My Baby. I highly recommend this gem of a purchase, enjoy!",1209513600,,447,4.973333333333334
766233,5,6303965091,"I wouldn't give the 5-star so easily, but it cannot be denied that this is one of my favorite DVDs.  Yes, it was ""cut"" -- not a complete continuous concert -- but that takes nothing from it.

I was impressed -- yes impressed -- by Mariah's lack of showmanship.  It isolated her talent, which is her incredible voice (along with some great songwriting).  It made me appreciate the later CD, The Education of Mimi even more.  What a difference between the singsong stuff on this DVD, versus the bold stuff on Mimi.  When do we get a more recent concert, Mimi???  I'll buy it!

Additionally, for those of you with kids, this is a completely family-friendly DVD, including the ""Camp Mariah"" segment.  Mom, Dad and kids can sit in the living room on a Saturday night and enjoy the heck out of this DVD.  The part where Mariah enters stage-left during One Sweet Day is an inspiring moment.

Buy it.  I'm a ""Mimi"" fan for life.",1173484800,7,920,4.475903614457831

766266,5,6303965091,What is Sony thinking?  They release a great concert on dvd and don't even think about how the audio feature should sound.  No 5.1 here!!!!  That is some cheap crap for a great performer who made Sony hundreds of millions in the 90's.  The picture comes is great but you better turn your system up very high to capture the greatness of Mariah's voice.  Hopefully Island Def Jam won't be so cheap when they release The Adventures of Mimi Tour on Dvd this holiday season.  (I don't even know if they are releasing it on dvd just wishful thinking),1151366400,2,544,4.444444444444445
766267,5,6303965091,"This concert video is Mariah's best so far. The first time I watched it, I was speechless. I had never seen Mariah like this before. She was totally confident, relaxed and gorgeous. Her voice is not as strong as in her previous concert video - Mariah Carey. This, however, is one of the reasons why I love this concert. She demonstrates that she is really seasoned to the concept of live performnce, instead of singing as she would in the studio. She doesn't seem to be trying to prove anything to anyone. The entrance, singing Fantasy, is simply fantastic. My favorite highlights include: Fantasy, Dreamlover, Without You, Always Be My Baby, Vision of Love, I'll Be There...the whole concert! Two fantastic performances, however, are: Make It Happen - what a performance! Especially the little addition after the third verse of the song. I just love it. Next, and believe me, this is a classic Mariah performance. She sings Hero with a massive choir of young people. A single light from above illuminates her as she opens the song. She stands in a long strapless gown, on a plain stage with mainly bluish lights with a standing microphone. The choir marches out part-way into the song. She belts out Hero with a delicate thread of a voice. And at the end, she opens both her arms in a giving way to the audience...it is magical.

My only complaint is the way Vision of Love was cut on this DVD -I first bought this concert in the VHS format. On the tape, after she sings Forever, she introduces her back-up singers and then Vision of Love starts...with the intro music (though not with the bang as in the original version). On the DVD, right after Forever, you see the audience and then, WAP!, Mariah starts singing: ""Treated me kind..."" I prefer the VHS version of this part of the concert.

The bonus videos, One Sweet Day and Anytime You Need A Friend...I will talk about the latter.  The AYNAF remix video is fun fun fun. It appears to be mainly a compilation of behind-the-scene actions for the actual video of the original song and the photo shoot for the cover of the single. It's fun though. I especially love the part where a lady gave one of Mariah's back-up singer a little blouse (I imagine one of Mariah's) to try on! That was hilarious. In another scene, Mariah was 'ironing' her hair - black women used to press their hair to make it straight...so I guess Mariah was trying to emulate a black woman by 'pressing' her hair as well. Only thing is, she was using an actual iron!!!

Fab concert, fab bonus videos, fab product.",1125100800,14,2538,4.583700440528634
766268,5,6303965091,"In front of thousands of screaming fans, Mariah Carey does what she does best. She sings! Carey sings seven #1 songs. These chart toppers include ""Fantasy, Dreamlover, I'll be there (with Wayna Morris), Always be my baby, Vision of love, Hero, and One sweet day w/Boyz II Men"". In addition to her seven number one hits Mariah also performs other tunes that have made Carey ""The Biggest-selling female artist of all time."" (According to Billboard magazine) This concert was filmed in 1996, and displays Carey with a very confident voice. For example, nowadays, Carey's infamous pipes display the damage Carey has imposed on them over the years. However, in 1996, Carey's pipes are warmed up and ready to shine. And that's what Carey does, she shines. Carey nails all the songs, her double falsetto is perfectly timed, and overall Carey seems comfortable with the ""runs"" she has made a pre-requiste to all modern singers to accomplish.
  Another important aspect of the concert is Carey ""leaves room for fantasy."" One sees an elegant dressed Carey which is refreshing and almost makes you forget about her fashion diasters in the past few years.
  If you happen to have 60 minutes of free time pop in the DVD/VHS and enjoy some great entertainment.",1119312000,3,1246,4.919047619047619
766269,5,6303965091,"Mariah looks her best on this tour DVD.  And she is going from strength to strength.  It's just a pity there wasn't more special features and background scenes and interviews, etc...

I saw her live in concert on her Charmbracelet Tour and it was amazing.  I really hope that all her other videos that are unreleased on DVD will soon be availabel to buy.  And I hope she comes out with a new Tour DVD with new songs from her ""Mimi"" album - It's excellent - she's brilliant - what more can I say...

It has my favorites like Fantasy, Make It Happen, Open Arms, Dreamlover, Without You, One Sweet Day w/Boyz II Men, I'll Be There with Wanya Morris, Hero, Always Be My Baby, Forever, Vision Of Love and two music videos:  One Sweet Day and a bonus video that wasn't on the VHS tape, Anytime You Need A Friend (Club Mix).  There are also interviews and behind the scenes footage from The Fresh Air Fund's Camp Mariah.  This is an incredible DVD and Mariah's voice truly soars on this DVD above anything and everything!  Her 8 octave voice is so unique, she is like no other singer!!!  Mariah is my favorite singer of all time and it's a must have for Mariah fans!!!",1109116800,17,684,4.432
766271,4,6303965091,Great concert! Great performance!  It's a showcase of Mariah's awesome talent and the best songs of her career.  It's great that this concert is now on DVD but the downside is that my copy was not re-mastered for Dolby Digital 5.1 surround. I wonder if a Dolby Digital 5.1 version will be released so the audiophiles will also be very happy.,1103846400,4,341,4.573770491803279
766272,5,6303965091,"In my opinion, Mariah Carey was the greatest female pop singer of the 1990s.  And this 60 minute concert, recorded at Madison Square Garden, is perhaps her finest performance.  Recorded at the peak of career, this concert is virtually flawless.  Mariah Carey's voice is absolutely stunning.  She looks gorgeous, and the audience is visibly captivated throughout the show.  This is not only one of the most significant pop performances of the 1990s, but of all time, and should be a part of any pop music fan's collection.  Forget about the last 5 years of her career, including Glitter, the publicized emotional problems, and popularity deterioration.  This concert will make you appreciate the impact Mariah Carey has had on the music world.",1103328000,38,742,5.082644628099174
766273,5,6303965091,"I have always been a fan of Mariah's but I have to say that when this video came out she was definetely at the high point in here career. Vocally, artistically, and mentally. She performed her best songs (not only at the time, but even out of the ones she does today) live. I am still a fan but I am not as devoted as I was back in the day before the Rainbow album. I still think she is a fantastic singer, especially when compared to many of todays non-singing Britney's, Mandy's, Heather's, Buffy's and Kim's. But admittedly, she is not as amazing as she was in the mid 90's. Her voice was absolutely fantastic only rivaled by Whitney and Celine. At that time in her career, she had a superior vocal range of any other singer hitting her trademark ""whistle notes"" as well as singing in a lower range than most female singers could. She also had a power in her voice that she only uses sparingly today. Now she whispers through most of her songs until the end where she tries to blow you away with a bunch of vocal runs and screechy sounding whistle notes. In addition to her voice being of better quality back then, she also sang more skillfully by holding notes longer and not going crazy with all of the riffs and runs. Contrary to what another reviewer said, Mariah Carey not only did not lip synch this performance, but she has never lip synched her songs. She has occasionally used a backing track that she sings over (particularly in recent years) but she always showcases her true voice. You can tell because she sounds different every time she sings a particular song than she did the last time (sometimes better, sometimes worse). The quality of this video sounds like studio because it has been processed and edited but the performance was clearly live because she ad libs, and improvises many notes and runs. She doesn't do much dancing in the video so there would have been no need for her to lip synch anyway. I wish that Mariah would go back to singing ballads, and up tempo pop songs that she was so good at. I love hip-hop and R&B music, but that is not what I want from Mariah. She needs to go back to showcasing her vocal and songwriting skills that made her famous instead of whispering her way through lame hip-hop songs with sampled music and tired rappers. She also needs to be more conservative in her appearance now that she is getting a little older instead of trying to be the sexy temptress. At this point Christina Aguilera not only sings better than Mariah, but is more convincing and tolorable as the [...]. With that said, this is a fantastic video and if you are a fan of Mariah and/or great singing, you won't be dissapointed with it.",1102118400,4,2669,4.448979591836735
766319,5,6303965091,"Mariah Carey voice is so amazing live that her voice is just as good as it is in the studio.  She's one of the only artists that can pull it off.

766323,4,6303965091,"This is one of my favorite Mariah Carey concerts. Her rendition of ""Fantasy"" is one of the best she's done live. There is a palpable feel to this concert because the sold out crowd were as enthusiatic as they come. Mariah was huge when this concert was recorded and it shows in this footage. At the time, ""Daydream"" was her latest album so this concert features material mostly from that album. I love her ""Make it Happen"" performance and ""Always Be My Baby"". This concert is one of the last ones she did before she got divorced from Tommy Mottola, which means her image at this point was still more conservative. But that's one of the reasons I like this concert. This DVD edition does not offer much in the way of extras, but does have two bonus videos from the time period this concert was recorded. It features the videos for ""One Sweet Day"" and ""Anytime You Need A Friend"" (Dance Version). It took them a LONG time to release this on DVD and this is the first of some of her former VHS releases to go to DVD.",1098403200,8,1013,4.336842105263158

i would like to address the point of lip-syncing.no such thing happened, do you think is she had mimed that each song would sound different to the recorded versions?no! like all her live performances there are slight key or note changes in songs and added etra riffs etc.  i understand were you are coming from, it may appear she is, but this is due to the sound, a performance has to be produced and edited before going into production, the are always slight sound errors - like on EVERY music video EVER! i find it hard to believe she would mime - why shes never done it before this performance or after!!!

She always sings her songs with emotions and sensetivity. I think all of her concerts were excellent, but this one was my favourite.

Mariah's voice and stage presense is absolutely amazing in this awesome concert video.  I could not expect better from Mariah.  I disagree with the customer who commented that Mariah lip-synched on this video because I firmly believe Mariah does not do that on live performances.  She always sings with her real voice she does not sing over a format she has done before.  She isn't Britney Spears ok?  I loved how Mariah is so friendly toward her fans.  She always tries to get everyone involved in her songs and she wants to give back to all her fans, whether you got front row seats or you are way in the back, way up or way down.  Mariah always has that place for her fans.  I really felt as if I was in the concert myself!  I could just feel as if I were with her at MSG even if I really wasn't.  Her voice is stunningly beautiful.  Mariah has all her octaves and her pipes are in superb condition.  She can hit the highest or lowest notes.  The really cool thing is Mariah seems to be truly enjoying herself during her concert and she really gets her fans involved and keeps them entertained.  She only changes outfits about two times throughout the entire concert compared to her ""Rainbow"" tour when she changed about 9 times in two hours.  But I still think that her music is much more important than her image.  Of course Mariah looks gorgeous and her voice is equally impressive.  I would have paid 30 dollars for this video or more.

The ""Around the World Video"" can't even remotely compete with this stunning performance.  The power and emotion expressed in these songs by her could never be  reproduced (there are points in the video where she seems to be posessed,  at the end of a few songs it looks like she is snapping out of a  hypnotism).  Everything about her was beautiful at this time, but now ... I  don't even consider myself a fan anymore.  The new and improved,  ""trendy"" Mariah Carey is just a prime example of an artist making  the wrong decision.  The hip-hop attitude just doesn't fit her.  I was  still listening to her until the ""Around the World"" video.  I was  so happy to think that I was going to get to see her perform songs of the  ""Butterfly"" album (her last good album).  But the sultry dancing  and lip-syncing just don't work well with Mariah.  I'm sorry Mariah, but  you've lost  this fan (I'm only one of 1,000,000,000 other  ""band-wagoneers"" out there so it won't hurt that bad).  She  states that she is making up for lost time, but in reality she's just  trying to create a new image to sell more records.
