2116565,5,B0002S64SM,"Oh what a wonderful character we have in Elsa, she makes you chuckle with her intelligent quips and beautiful childlike posturing, pouting, her freckled face, and interesting disposition.

A lovely thread woven by a few great actors. As far as foreign films go, this is a good one to watch or give as a gift. Innocence washes over you as you watch this child and remember being, That.

Oh an aside, I must concur with the person who commented on the idea of this being a good movie to use to study french. The voices are crisp,and somehow sensual. I was thinking that learning language listening to a child's voice is much better than some adults voice contrived for the occasion of teaching....ahh so natural!! lol",1169942400,2,715,4.666666666666667
2116566,4,B0002S64SM,"LE PAPILLON deals cards that we've all seen before; in this case, it's the ""charming urchin works elderly curmudgeon into seeing life in a new way, and vice-versa"" hand.  But the film's beautiful outdoor setting and the masterful acting by Michel Serrault as said curmudgeon manage to overcome the film's worst sentimental tendencies.

But the plot does have some holes you could drive a Renault through; most conspicuously, how did Elsa free-fall into a deep crevasse without a scratch? And are we really supposed to believe she's nine? (She could be five.)Still, you have to admire any movie that spends so much time on entomology.

SIDELIGHT: If you have seen LA CAGE AUX FOLLES, you should recognize Michel Serrault, even without his makeup.",1169510400,3,745,5.040650406504065
2116567,4,B0002S64SM,"I teach KG-6th grade French.  It is tough to find French films (other than cartoons) appropriate for this age.  The Butterfly is a great film for French teachers.  Other than 1 off-color joke, there is no offensive material at all and the subject is totally appropriate for students starting in about 4th grade.  Plus it's short.  I enjoyed the film and plan to show it to my students.",1163289600,19,385,4.602941176470588
2116568,4,B0002S64SM,"I intended to see THE BUTTERFLY at a French Film Festival here in Boston a few years ago, but I purchased the tickets on line and must have made a mistake, because I was given tickets for another film that was showing on the same day at a later time. I then rented the DVD or what I thought was the DVD but didn't pay careful attention to the box and saw a Spanish film with the same title, a worthwhile film, but not what I wanted to see. Seeing this film was becoming as much of a challenge as finding the elusive as the butterfly that the main character is searching for in the film. Finally I had the correct DVD in hand, and saw a simple film that is both moving and charming.

THE BUTTERFLY (LE PAPILLON) is a relatively short (about eighty minutes) film that tells the story of a friendship that grows between a young girl and a man old enough to be her grandfather. Julien (Michel Surrault) is an older gentleman who has a passion for collecting butterflies. A young mother and her daughter Elsa move in the same apartment building. Elsa (Claire Bouanich) is often left alone and one day, as Julien leaves for a trip to find an elusive butterfly, the Isabella, Elsa is left alone. He has a choice: either he can leave Elsa with the police or he can take her with him. He chooses the latter, due more to impatience with the wait at the police station than any kind of attachment to the girl, and it is on the trip the two bond. We learn as the film progresses why Julien is alone and the importance of finding the Isabella for both characters.

The story of a young spirit touching the heart of a lonely older person is familiar and has been told in many different ways in films the world over, yet THE BUTTERFLY manages to tell it in an original way. The film is gorgeous to watch, especially the mountain scenes, and it never gets sentimental though it tugs at the heart.  It's an enjoyable film to watch and a great film to have in a DVD collection to watch again and again.",1159920000,43,1984,4.2712765957446805

2116595,5,B0002S64SM,"Bubbling with humor, awesome performances and lavish cinematography, The Butterfly, or Le Papillon in original French, is about a young girl named Elsa (Claire Bouanich) who is often left alone by her young mother Isabelle (Nade Dieu). She decides to leave on a trip to search for a butterfly with an elderly neighbor, Julien (Michel Serrault), a widower and butterfly collector.

Julien makes a decision to go to the Vercors plateau looking for a very rare butterfly called ""Isabelle"". It is rare because it only lives for 72 hours, and comes out late at night, but before midnight. Elsa, who knows her mother has left for several days, decides to join Julien and hides in his car. As the search for the butterfly progresses we see a deep friendship form between these two and we learn that Julien lost his son when he was a young man. We also see that Elsa is a very smart, mature and understanding girl who longs for her mothers love. Elsa's mother believes her to be kidnapped and involves the police who are now on a search or Julien and the girl and when Elsa accidentally falls into a deep hole and Julien goes for help, the police apprehend him. He leads them to the girl, but is taken away as he is suspected of kidnapping. The girl is rescued and Julien is released when the officials realize that he never kidnapped Elsa.

When Elsa's mother realizes what a dear friend Julien has been, she allows their friendship to grow and also begins to spend time with Julien. They help one another and the movie ends with them all being grateful for each other in their lives. A very sweet friendship, human emotions and both laughs and tears all characterize The Butterfly, a delightful film that truly captures your heart.",1423094400,,1725,4.633986928104576

2116601,5,B0002S64SM,A wonderful movie.  The story of the old man going hunting for a rare butterly and the little girl who manages to get him to take her along into the mountains is a bit sentimental but never cloying--only the French can do this so elegantly.

The story line is refreshingly different, visually it is an absolute delight, the acting is first class and I was reminded of why I like to watch French Movies: they are almost never clich&eacute;d.  If I had find a criticism it would be that the ending seems a little rushed,as though the cutting editor got carried away but that does show that lengthy explanations of the obvious are really unnecessary.  The Butterfly stayed with me for days after I watched it.  I recommend it for all ages.

The two principles, old man and little girl are both wonderful, the dialogue is funny and the scenery is spectacular (French Alps....it doesn't get any better than this).

There is a pun which is maybe not in catching butterflies but in the little girls' flutterby's

Dear Granpa and Little Red Riding Girl in the woods. no wolf, no granma.

2116625,5,B0002S64SM,"A wonderfully crafted film!  We love it!  It's visually beautiful with wonderful acting that is believable and real.

I pause to make the comment about how anybody could give this film three stars. This is not contrived Disney-like dribble in the least. I actually gravitate toward Foreign cinema because it is just exactly the opposite of American dribble. It's just that people today are so negative, they can't handle anything loving and good with out tearing it down because they are empty inside and have an attitude of ""if I am not happy, no one else can be happy either.""  Hmm, sounds like selfishness and an over inflated sense of self.  Hey, no wonder you're miserable.

never-the-less . . .

You grow to love the main characters and empathize with them.  You know this film has something good ahead.  It's fun along the way.  Little bits of sunshine and happiness.

The film's core theme is true: don't get so wrapped up in yourself and your troubles that you forget to tell the important people in your life, ""I love you.""  The little French girl (brilliant little actress)in the film is in many ways a metaphor for a beautiful butterfly herself. Or is the butterfly their friendship (the grandfather figure and little girl?)

You know this film will end happily (it has to), but you just don't know exactly how.  It's like, your going to get a gift; but what?

To the end, your like, ""What's going to happen?""

And the film keeps rewarding you again and again emotionally right up to ""FIN"".

The world definitely needs more films like this gem!  The same emotional flavor as ""My Father's Glory"", and as worthy as ""Kikijuro"" in it's poignant little story and honest heart.  As important to see as ""Salaam Bombay"" but for a much more brighter reason.",1258070400,2,1760,4.69281045751634

Julien is a former watch/clock repairman who now collects butterflies and lives a quiet solitude life.  Elsa is a latch-key kid who is left alone by her single parent (and neglectful) Mother.  Julien runs into Elsa sitting alone in a diner and learns that her Mom fails to give her a key to their apartment.  He brings Elsa home to wait for her Mother and she steps in his apartment and finds wonder.  (Best not to give away the storyline).

Julien is on a hunt to find a rare butterfly named Isabelle in the mountains.  After driving many miles, he comes to find out that Elsa sneaks away with him in the car.  The unlikely pair then head for the mountains in search of Isabelle while Elsa's mother and the police frantically search for her.

This is a warm and engaging feel-good movie for both adults and children.  There are many lessons here that Julien learns from Elsa and Elsa from him.  There is beautiful cinematography with scenes in the Alps and the movie is set to wonderful background piano music.  Great movie to watch on a Sunday morning...",1210032000,,1181,4.598086124401914
