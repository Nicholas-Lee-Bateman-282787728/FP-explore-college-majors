1993351,2,B0001DYG10,"the movie was of very poor quality,the pic was fuzzy and had some kind of colors in part of it.it was hard to see the pic at times.",1390003200,,131,3.7142857142857144
1993352,5,B0001DYG10,Very enjoyable film that can be watched by entire family.  Robby Benson does a respectable acting job.  Highly recommend this film.,1378425600,,131,5.190476190476191
1993353,1,B0001DYG10,"Wow!  I remember reading this book then seeing the film in the theater.  The DVD version looks like somebody took the crappiest reel, played it on the big screen and recorded with the cheapest camcorder they could find.  Picture quality: crap, sound quality: crap.  This DVD is crap.  To add insult to injury, there is a 'RE' watermark through the entire film like they were showing it on TBS.  My recommendation is read the book.",1377129600,4,430,4.666666666666667
1993354,1,B0001DYG10,"The storyline is as good as I expected, but the video itself was very poor. As if copied wrong. I prefer the book fo that very reason........",1351987200,3,141,4.2592592592592595
1993355,5,B0001DYG10,first purchase on amazon- was very happy with my experience- delievery was fast and book was as good as  condition discribed - would buy again,1232409600,,142,4.68
1993356,3,B0001DYG10,"The Amazon product description clearly states that this is DVD-R, which means that it is a no-frills copy of (most probably) a VHS on DVD.  Unfortunately, cheap copies are likely to be the only way this film will ever be on DVD.  Let's face it, even ""Ode To Billie Joe"" is just now getting an official DVD release.

By the way, some marketplace sellers are listing a single disc with ""Jory"" and two other westerns on it - ""Little Moon And Jud McGraw"" and ""Boothill.""  The quality is certainly no better, as this copy of ""Jory"" is also obviously from a VHS, with the occasional jitter and color that sometimes appears just slightly off.

If you want to see the movie for the first time, or didn't pick it up on its VHS release, it is well worth buying for the prices being asked.  Both for the Robbie Benson fan and the fan of '70's style westerns.",1231718400,3,847,4.3630573248407645
1993357,3,B0001DYG10,Although the VHS print was kind of hazy this was a good film for one of Robbie's first films.  The plot was good and the acting was great.  Too bad it is not on DVD.  It is film hard to find but worth it when you find it if you are a Robbie Benson fan.  The film is about a young boy growing up in the West after losing his father and joining a horse drive across the West.  He develops into a fine young cowboy--the film is old but a pleasure to watch.  Find it if you can.,1202860800,,474,3.7373737373737375
1993358,1,B0001DYG10,Jory DVD with Robbie Benson is very poor Sound & Picture quality. Sound and Video fade in and out like a cheap copy.  If this was an original DVD then the manufacture cannot reproduce a quality copy from the film version. DO NOT PURCHASE.,1190160000,5,238,4.409090909090909
1993359,5,B0001DYG10,"I don't know what the previous reviewer is talking about!! The color and print of this film looks great for an early 1970's film!

(Some film buffs may know that a ""new"" type of film stock was developed and used in the 1970's, which was thrown out the door at the end of the decade due to the film's color starting to fade rapidly in a just a few years. So most 70's films have this ""look,"" which Jory certainly does. This copy of Jory seems to have survived this film stock defect pretty darn well.)

No, it's not a ""perfect"" copy, with some occasional dirt and very occasional color issues (e.g. one scene was too red, but this could be the filmmakers fault during the original shoot). But unless you're a major studio with gazillions of dollars to ""restore"" a film, this looks pretty good.

I wish people would stop thinking all old films should look ""perfect"" to the standards of today's latest blockbuster films. No old film will ever be perfect, even the ones that HAVE been restored by a major studio (such as ""Dracula"" from 1931 and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" both of which have sound issues and film jump cuts in them).

The story is also pretty cool, with young Robby Benson going from a scared teenager to gunfighter.

So check it out and disregard the previous bad review!!",1179964800,8,1290,4.495726495726496
1993360,1,B0001DYG10,"I was thrilled to find out that Robby Benson's first major film was released on DVD as I had never seen it before on video, tv or elsewhere. But it was a very disappointing surprise. It looks like a very bad copy of the video printed directly onto the DVD. I wouldn't recommend bying this DVD.",1173484800,6,293,4.25
8011113,3,B0001DYG10,Just so so. I wanted it because BJ Thomas was in it.,1525996800,,52,3.4166666666666665
8011114,4,B0001DYG10,I ordered this movie because it has Robby Benson in it.  I have been trying to collect every movie that has this soft-spoken gentleman in it.  This movie did not disappoint.  It was shocking how cruel people were in the old West to this orphan.  This movie gave such a feeling of despair and suspense.  I kept hoping throughout the movie that somebody would help him.  Wonderful acting!,1524268800,,386,4.602941176470588
8011115,2,B0001DYG10,"I was named after this movie!!! I own a copy on VHS, I've never watched it. I don't like old westerns.  Just wanted to review it because I was named after it, lol.",1516320000,,163,3.9393939393939394
8011116,5,B0001DYG10,Childhood movie!! Loved it!!,1502755200,,28,6.25
8011117,5,B0001DYG10,"My copy of Jory was part of a family adventure box set and the transfer was excellent in both sound and video quality. Is it a visual masterpiece capable of comparison to today's video and sound standards? No, but it survived the passage of time quite well.

As far as the story, Jory rises to the occasion in it's presentation of heartbreaking life lessons for young Jory who has to carve a path for himself and grow up quickly, and he learns that even the most hardened steel of intentions can buckle under the weight of life's bullies and challenges. It is an exceptionally told and acted story and all of the actors shine, especially Benson who shows rare acting ability even among seasoned actors, let alone a boy in one of his first roles.

Jory is a worthy part of your collection is you love westerns with a deep storyline or a coming of age story fraught with hardships and sadness. I highly recommend it if you can find it on DVD in excellent form as I did.",1462147200,,967,4.396648044692737
8011118,5,B0001DYG10,"I read the Sam Bass paper back novel many years ago and it was excellent , this movie rendition though not the best copy of the film I found to be excellent . If you can find the book read it",1436572800,,191,3.682926829268293
8011119,5,B0001DYG10,Great DVD,1433721600,,9,4.0
8011120,5,B0001DYG10,"I just finished watching this movie, Jory on VHS by EDDE Entertainment and it was like watching a perfect DVD. This is my first review of any movie I've ever watched and I have a movie library of over 5000 movies. I really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end even with the shocking scenes that totally surprised me, I felt like jumping through the screen to see that justice was done and I'm happy to say, I didn't need to. Whoever said, kindness is a sign of weakness was truly wrong. Cherish your friends, your true friends, because you don't know how long they will be with you. The good news is, you will take that good part of them with you wherever you go. BJ Thomas played the character Jocko, who wrote and sang some incredible music and If you want to listen to music that will take you places, get a hold of BJ Thomas's greatest hits, however, my personal favorite ""Brown eyed woman"" is not part of his greatest hits, why?, I have no idea, it should've  been.",1428105600,,974,4.351648351648351
8011121,5,B0001DYG10,I was hoping that the movie would be closer to the book than it was. I was disappointed. This movie could have been so much more.,1424304000,,129,4.0
8011122,1,B0001DYG10,"Very disappointing, as the movie, clearly copied from a TV show, was dark, and blurry. I would not have ordered this DVD, had I known that the quality was so low, compared to what I have learned to expect from the various Amazon entities.

The movie followed the book only in some respects, but I place no blame on the seller for this drawback. I DO wish, though, that offering such a movie on DVD should be accompanied by some sort of source statement.",1406073600,,453,4.392857142857143
