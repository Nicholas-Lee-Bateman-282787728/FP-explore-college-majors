8534503,5,B0091YWU5O,"As a financial advisor and Christian, I find this perspective to be fascinating and eye-opening.  They certainly don't teach this view in our secular schools. Jerry Bowyer has other presentations that talk about the economic performance of countries that are God-centered vs not and their ultimate fate.",1417651200,3,303,5.446808510638298

8534505,5,B0091YWU5O,Making sense out of the vagaries and vasilations of economics is tough at any point but Jerry Bowyer's concise reasoning is a breath of fresh air.
