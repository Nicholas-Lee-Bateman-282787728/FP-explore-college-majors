4690500,5,B005GHJMX8,"This production from the history Channel is probably the best since 'I Know What I Saw' came out. If you are interested in the UFO subject then this presentation needs to be a part of your collection. It is based on the recent book by Leslie Kean 'UFO Generals, Pilots, and Government Officials Go On The Record. The DVD covers the incidents at Bentwater, England 1980....The Phoenix incident in 1997, The Chicago O'Hare incident in 2006, The JAL incident of 1986 and also the Belgium triangle sightngs in 1989. All of these incidents had many witnesses and backing data to prove that something strange/mysterious was happening at the time of the sightings. These type of incidents have been going on since WWII and before and are still happening today. Between Leslie's book and this DVD I believe we are at a new genesis in which science, governments, and military and civilian pilots are taking this subject seriously and are coming forward with their information. For decades this subject has been the brunt of jokes and ridicule not to mention all the frauds and hoaxers trying to obtain some kind of fame. But there were always a small portion of the sightings/incidents which could never be explained away. This DVD looks at some of the most important ones from the last 25 years. If you know this subject (UFO/UAP) most of what is on this DVD will not come as much of a surprise to you. However if you are a newcomer to the UFO/UAP subject you will come away with a new insight about the world we live in. The DVD does not say we are being visited by aliens but it does suggest that something quite extraordinary has been taking place in the past decades and even on through today. Once you view this DVD you may not view the night sky in the same way again.",1332547200,3,1766,4.556603773584905
4690501,5,B005GHJMX8,"I have a large collection of videos dealing with the subject of UFOs, and I have to say, this video contained information and documentation I have never seen or heard before.  This one definitely makes it into my all-time favorite top 5 UFO programs.

Leslie Kean is an investigative reporter who has been focused for some time on the topic of UFOs.  She is the author of the recent book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/UFOs-Generals-Pilots-and-Government-Officials-Go-on-the-Record/dp/0307717089/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">UFOs: Generals, Pilots, and Government Officials Go on the Record</a>, which, despite the occasional misstep, should be mandatory reading for anyone serious about the subject of UFOs.  In this film, Kean selects just a few of the best documented cases to explore; ones which have either been ignored by the mainstream media and downplayed by governments, but which have a wealth of solid documentation in the form of first-rate, multiple witnesses, physical trace evidence, multiple radar confirmations, and in at least one instance, physical contact and extensive examination by highly trained military personnel.

There were a number of segments in the film which presented evidence I have never before seen or heard.  Here are just a couple of examples.

In 1980, the US Air Forces bases on UK soil at Rendlesham and Bentwaters were the focus of multiple UFO sightings.  The crowning piece of evidence in this case has always been a tape recording made at the scene as craft were being observed to operate in the nearby forest by then Deputy Base Commander, Lt. Col. Charles Halt.  This is not new to the UFO research community, as both the actual audio of the tape and a transcript of its content have been available online to anyone who wants them for several years.  I have read the transcript and listened to the tape numerous times, and was very familiar with it.  It is interesting and compelling, but to me, at least, it never quite felt like the ""smoking gun"" everyone looks for.  This video reconstructs the events, using the tape recording in segments and placing them chronologically into the story as it unfolded. The tape was recorded in little bits, and when you listen to it or read the transcript you really don't get the feel for how all these little bits related to each other in chronological terms.  Perhaps because of this blurring, it lacked the impact it should have had.  But when it is broken up, and each segment is placed into context in a recreation of the total account... WOW!  It envelopes you in the atmosphere and experience of that 1980 night in the forest like nothing else ever could.  It becomes understandable after viewing this why so many of those witnesses that night are still visibly shaken by their experience when they are interviewed over 30 years later.  This film is worth the price for this one segment alone.

Another home run of evidence was the recorded call of an airman from the local Air Force base in Arizona during the 1997 ""Phoenix Lights"" incident.  The USAF denied they had record of anything unusual in the skies at the time.  Eventually, after Arizona Senator John McCain got involved and began pushing the military for explanations, the USAF claimed all that was seen that night were military flares dropped from planes; an explanation that has been shown to be untenable due to the timing involved of the sightings, versus the time the USAF documents the flares being dropped.  Still, the USAF has maintained this was all there was to the whole thing, and has denied any further knowledge.  This film plays the actual recording of an airman from that USAF base as he reported his first-hand knowledge of what was going on that night.  He states explicitly that US interceptor craft had been launched, and that he had spoken with one of the pilots who had gone after the UFO; a man he says he had never observed to fear anything.  Upon this pilot's return, the airman says, this normally unflappable pilot was clearly scared to death.  We don't have a full account of what the pilot saw that so frightened him, but whatever it was, it terrified him.  Though I had heard that a report had been made by a base airman, I had never before heard the actual call he made.  The tape is played in this documentary, and it is evident the airman is, himself, quite agitated and upset by what is going on.

Another incident occurred in 2006 over O'Hare International Airport.  A recording is played during the film of a supervisor there at the airport who is asking the tower for verification of what she has seen.  In the tape, she states categorically that a photograph of the object has been taken; something both the airlines and the FAA have denied.  The way she mentions it so matter-of-factly leaves little room to doubt she knew exactly what she was talking about at the time.  This photo, or photos, has never come to light.  A friend of mine who works at O'Hare, and who personally saw the craft, verified for me at the time that everyone potentially involved in the sighting was taken that day into a room and warned (read here, ""threatened"") in the strongest language that they were never to speak of what they had seen.  He said the people debriefing them made it clear that loss of employment would be the least of worries for anyone who did not keep their mouth shut.  Though I never had reason to doubt this friend, I must admit, after hearing the recording of the supervisor questioning the tower that day, I was left with no doubts in my mind but that my friend's account was 110% accurate.

One very interesting case explored in the film is the Belgium ""black triangle"" UFO wave of 1989 - 1990.  For those familiar with the case, there is a single photograph that has long been the subject of investigation.  It shows a clear view of the craft, and has been examined extensively by many specialists, most of whom have declared it to be authentic.  At about the same time Kean released her book and produced the film currently under review, the young man who took the photograph came forward and claimed he had hoaxed the picture.  In other words, his deceit goes undetected for 30 years and then he suddenly comes forward to confess.  He gave little detail about how it had been done.  The timing of the debunking of the photo with the release of Kean's book and this film, both of which give the photograph a prominent place in their treatment of the investigation, is rather curious, to say the least.  There seems little chance the photo would ever have been exposed for a fake short of its photographer making such an admission.  It has been studied so closely for so many years, with a verdict of ""authentic"" being the general consensus, that there seems little reason why the alleged hoaxer would feel a compelling need to come out 30 years after the fact and divulge his dirty little secret.  And again, the timing of the confession relative to the release of this film and Kean's book...curiouser and curiouser. This ""hoax confession"" is eerily reminiscent to that of Mac Brazel, the rancher who originally discovered the debris at Roswell.  After Brazel had told his story, the military picked him up and held him incommunicado for several days.  Upon his release, Brazel made a retraction statement for the radio station who had carried his original account in which he said he had found nothing but a weather balloon.  However, confidentially, he told  Frank Joyce at the radio station that the the infamous ""little green men"" really weren't green at all, suggesting he had been compelled by the military to make a false retraction.  Is is possible that similar pressure was brought to bear on the Belgian photographer?  Several people have suggested that the photographer should prove his confession by duplicating the photo.  Having done it once, and based on his general description of how he claims he hoaxed the photo, it should be relatively simple to duplicate the process and make another of equal quality.  To date, that challenge has not been taken up by the photographer, casting some doubt on the authenticity of his confession.  Watch this film and listen to the conclusions of the specialists who have gone over the photo.  When you hear the things they have noted in the photo which convinced them it was authentic, you, too, might question whether or not the young photographer could have faked it, or whether the real hoax is the confession itself.

There were other pieces of evidence in the film similar to the above that I had not seen or heard before and/or that were put into context for me for the first time, but I'll leave it to you to find them yourself.  What I can say is, this film is top notch.  It presents the kind of case that is hard to dismiss or wish away, as is all too common among the debunking crowd.  It will take a prominent position in your own UFO video library.",1330214400,28,8959,4.7911515940143135

4690505,5,B005GHJMX8,"It seems like some reviewers may give this documentary three stars, largely because it didn't ""wow"" them with cases they had not heard of before.  I am familiar with many of the cases presented in this documentary and I give it five stars, because it is that well done. I have recently watched three documentaries on the UFO Phenomenon:

- I Know What I Saw
- Out of the Blue
- Secret Access: Most Credible UFOs (this DVD)

Of these, Secret Access: Most Credible UFOs is the clearest and most compelling of the films. They stay away from conspiracy theories, sticking to facts, interviews and eye witnesses of the 5% to 10% of UFO cases that cannot be explained and that have multiple witnesses and evidence, such as radar readings, etc. The other two dvds are not terrible, but do not present the cases in a clear and compelling manner, as Secret Access: Most Credible UFOs does.

Part of the reason this DVD is so good is the participation of investigative journalist Leslie Kean, who has been researching UFOs since 2000 and is the author of the excellent book:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/UFOs-Generals-Pilots-and-Government-Officials-Go-on-the-Record/dp/0307717089/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">UFOs: Generals, Pilots, and Government Officials Go on the Record</a>

Keane is a no-nonsense researcher who only concentrates on credible cases that cannot be explained. Although her book has much more in it than this DVD, the documentary is a good visual counterpart to her excellent book.

If you want to watch a program that makes a compelling case for taking UFO reports out of the area of the tabloids and into the area of the scientific study of the UFO phenomena, then get this DVD.",1406678400,6,1729,5.201438848920863

The fact that many of these people who were under orders at some time ( to keep quiet)  have actually come forward and

4690507,5,B005GHJMX8,"I was skeptical when I purchased this DVD, because it was produced by the History Channel who have a long history of belittling those of us who don't by into the old lines like: ""you didn't see anything, it was only swamp gas, those are ice particles..etc..""

What a shock I had when I watched one of the best UFO documentaries ever. The production values are outstanding, they don't spend too much time on the old stories like Rosewell and Kecksberg, but get into more recent encounters. Honestly if you want something to show your skeptical friends, who are overly sensitive to production values....get this video!! You don't feel like you have to appologize for the music that was used, or the way in which the information is presented.

Bravo for the History Channel finally coming to their senses!",1378598400,6,802,4.762589928057554

4690509,3,B005GHJMX8,"""Secret Access: UFOs on the record"" is an interesting documentary about the UFO phenomenon from a non-sceptical viewpoint. It features investigative reporter Leslie Kean, British UFO expert Nick Pope (a.k.a. ""the real Fox Mulder"") and a somewhat repentant ex-governor of Arizona, Fife Symington. The documentary attempts to prove that the UFO phenomenon is real, consistent and ""material"". People are seeing actual craft. At the very end, the producers reveal that they believe in the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis.

UFO cases featured include the Rendlesham Forest incident, the Phoenix Lights and the Belgian UFO wave. There are also two lesser known observations (at least from my horizon) from Alaska and Chicago respectively. Witnesses include air traffic pilots, people from the military and police officers. As usual, the proper authorities feigned ignorance, came up with ridiculous explanations or mocked the witnesses. Ex-governor Symington admits that he saw the Phoenix Lights himself, but felt he couldn't go public with the information for fear of being ridiculed or creating hysteria. An interesting admission! The incident at Rendlesham Forest was (officially) not seen as a threat to the national security of Britain, despite having taken place near a heavily guarded NATO base stashed with nuclear missiles!

At least if the witnesses are to be believed, the UFOs looked like physical objects, often triangular-shaped, but had the ability to both shape-shift and disappear out of view almost instantaneously. This weird mixture of the physical and the non-physical seems to be typical of many UFO observations. Of course, the recurring triangular shape and silent flight of these objects make me suspect secret test flights of Stealth bombers or similar airplanes. The Belgian authorities apparently suspected the same, but USAF denied everything in an official statement (Belgium is a NATO member). The ""supernatural"" behaviour of the UFOs suggests either that the witnesses don't know what they are seeing, or that the phenomenon is paranormal.

Obviously, we could be dealing with different kinds of phenomena wrongly lumped together: most UFOs, after all, are not triangular shape, and it's difficult to find a completely consistent pattern in the great mass of UFO observations.

Be that as it may, I think ""Secret Access"" has at least demonstrated that something very strange is going on in our airspace and (perhaps) inside the heads of our duly elected officials and the military (but then, *that's* hardly news).

I don't think ""Secret Access"" is as good as ""Out of the Blue"" or ""UFOs in South America"", so I'm only going to give it three stars, but don't take it from me, watch it yourselves...",1351900800,3,2720,5.345794392523365
4690510,3,B005GHJMX8,"The endlessly frustrating cable TV UFO show rolls on with some fairly contemporary greatest hits courtesy of Leslie Kean and the History Channel.

To its credit, this program is not dominated by Ms Kean.  Her contribution - whatever it actually amounts to - is basically a hook for History to reboot some borrowed old news with a somewhat fresher style.

Recycling does pay off, evidently.  But other than an interesting, though typically too brief, segment involving Douglas Trumbull's personal skywatch project, the studious amongst us have already heard these tunes.  Decent CGI in the recreations, but more than enough time is spent on personalizing each case: padding in lieu of deeper or additional explorations. God forbid we get bored with too many facts and details!  Instead, the usual over reliance on super tight closeup confessionals.

Not bad for the price, but hey, History Channel, how about bringing some new UFOs to the party next time!  Sloppy seconds leave me blue.

(Postscript:  I neglected to mention that the fellow from SOBEPS, in the segment covering the Belgium 1989-1990 wave, is entirely incorrect in his assertion that until that time no triangular UFOs had ever been sighted with such frequency. The Belgium flap came on the heels of several years worth of enormous boomerang, ellipse, triangle UFO sightings in Westchester, Fairfield and New Haven counties, USA.  From 1983 to 1989 this was an ongoing event - in fact an overflight of multiple such UFOs had just taken place in Fairfield County, CT only a couple of months prior to the first Belgium sighting, facts which this representative of a major UFOlogical association, even if moribund until then, should have been very aware of.)",1342051200,,1720,5.085409252669039
