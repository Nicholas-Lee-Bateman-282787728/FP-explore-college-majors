8366188,4,B002DVS1UK,"Very good Spanish-made, Spanish-language film starring the singing child actress of the 1960's called Marisol.  The story is about a little girl torn between her widowed mother and her paternal grandfather.  I remember seeing it in the theater when I was a child.  On occasion it is shown on a Hispanic movie channel.  I would love to see this movie released in the US on DVD.",1374278400,4,376,4.651515151515151
