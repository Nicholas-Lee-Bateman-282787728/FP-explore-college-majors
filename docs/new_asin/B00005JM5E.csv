1480484,5,B00005JM5E,"Ahoy there, me hearties! I've got to say, this movie is (so far) the best movie of the year (we'll see how ROTK fares--hopefully well!). Johnny Depp gave a stellar performance as, who else, Captain Jack Sparrow (what a cool name). I don't know exactly what it is about him, but his overall demeanor throughout the movie put me in a rather good mood, and had me laughing to the end. Anyone who hasn't seen it (what are you waiting for?) needs to go. NOW! Oh, and *waste* your time by watching 'till the end of the credits. You'll thank me. :)",1057795200,,541,4.313725490196078

1480606,5,B00005JM5E,"The ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series has become so large and epic that it's easy to forget how relatively self-contained this first film was. Introducing Captain Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth Swan, Will Turner, and Hector Barbossa, the film focuses on cursed Aztec Gold and introduces many of the versions of piracy that dominated the latter movies. Mystical elements aside, the film is relatively character-driven, with the interactions between the main characters and side characters driving the action, the drama, and the humor. Even better, unlike the later bloated blockbusters, this film used CGI only when necessary and feels more grounded due to the limitations that placed on the story. Each successive ""Pirates"" film feels like an attempt to recapture the pure joy of this adventure story. Do yourself a favor and take a trip back to 2003 when Johnny Depp's portrayal of Jack Sparrow was odd, but confident, and Kiera Knightly and Orlando Bloom were up-and-coming stars. Enjoy Geoffrey Rush when he was a fun part of an ensemble cast and didn't have to carry an overdone, bloated blockbuster. The first remains the best and it's only with ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" that the series has achieved a sense of resolution.",1518480000,,1220,5.074626865671642

1480746,4,B00005JM5E,"Miss Elizabeth Swan as a child was intrigued with pirates. She has an opportunity to save one. In the process, she pilfers what looks like a piece of pirate gold. This simple act will lead to death and destruction, or romance and intrigue.

This well paced movie has every clich ever spoken in the classic pirate movies. It also has all the elements, gold, and sub-plots, and is sure to point them out to you should you miss one.

This is a well-designed movie with attempts to be authentic in many ways such as using real pistols from the era. There are several crews and you will notice that the extras change from one scene to the next. They did not skimp on the actors either. As with pirate movies of old, the main actors took the lion's share of the action.

Of course, you will have your eye on Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), his cronies and adversaries. However I was surprised to see their good taste in giving Guy Siner the part of Harbormaster; you may remember him as Lieutenant Hubert Gruber in the series ""Allo 'Allo!"" (1982)

There are no bones about it, this is superior to other Depp movies and will leave a good after taste. You may need to see it several times to pick up the tightly packed scenes and dialog. I have viewed the duel DVD package and found instead of just rehashing the movie scenes that they give different insights that you may have missed in the first viewing. Even the deleted scenes allow you to see the way the movie could have went.",1503619200,,1478,4.422794117647059

1480886,5,B00005JM5E,"This action-adventure film is very ambitious and very successful because it relies on great characters as much as a great fantastic tale. Its also the best of the franchise.

Director Gore Verbinski (A Cure for Wellness, The Ring, The Mexican, The Weather Man) is a man of depth and range.  The varied nature of the action will please viewers of all ages.  Ranging from daffy character-catapulting gags to fancy footworked swordplay, the stunts are abundant, diverse and, most notably, uncommonly interesting. The seafaring battle is especially engaging, being equal parts tense, funny and exciting, and all contributing to making this an outstanding somewhat family-friendly (at PG-13 with numerous off-screen kills) adventure movie. I love seeing the cannonballs tear through the ships with splinters raining across the screen. Watching the action scenes was simply energizing!  But bringing rewatchability and synthesis to the screen are the characters!

As Captain Jack Sparrow, Johnny Depp (Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Transcendence, Into the Woods) has manifested a character that no Renaissance Festival or Comic Con has gone without for almost 15 years now. This Keith Richards-mannerismed pirate has a drunken-boxing swagger and a nigh-slurred savoir-faire making him unforgettably charismaticyet nervously twitchy.  His somewhat bewildered and oft-shocked expressions draw nothing but grins.  From his very inception on screen we know he is not to be trusted, he has a sharp retort for everything, and this man knows how to make an entrance!

The cruel swashbuckling yin to Sparrows yang, Geoffrey Rush (Gods of Egypt, The Warriors Way, The Kings Speech) is a master of villainy and imbues Captain Barbossa with equal parts cheeky piracy and gross goon.  Hes so convincingly menacing, its hard to imagine he was ever Jack Sparrows first mate.  Rush owns every moment hes on screen as readily as Depp, and the two steal the show in their race to end a curse from their stolen Aztec gold.  During Barbossas efforts to gather all the gold coins and Jacks efforts to steal his ship back from Barbossa, a blacksmiths apprentices love is taken captive and all sorts of motives and chases cross paths.

But really, all the characters are memorable.  The bumbling duo of pirate deck swabs (Once Upon a Times Lee Arenberg and Dark Ascensions Mackenzie Crook) who smack of Abbot and Costello with the menace Home Alones Marv and Harry; the tactful use of Barbossas feisty monkey; the recurring foolish guards of the Royal Navy (who recur through at least part 3); we all love Governor Weatherby (Jonathan Pryce; Game of Thrones, Taboo); and even Will Turners (Orlando Bloom; The Hobbit trilogy; The Three Musketeers, Troy) blacksmith master had his moment to shine.  As our fair female lead, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley; Domino, Love Actually) is drawn with all the classic damsel tropeswhich she appropriately crumbles in the wake of her very defiance of them.  At only 17 years old, Knightley gives a solid performance for her iron-willed Elizabeth.

While overall gorgeous and a joy to watch, the CGI (particularly the undead pirates) didn't hold properly up.  I mean, it still looks very good and quite entertainingbut while absolutely stunning at the time of its release the quality drop (by todays standards) is inescapably evident.  But this is more than compensated by iconic scenes whose impact transcend the somewhat dated CGI.  The underwater scenes are numerous and crisp, the swabs wooden eye managed to almost feel like its own character, the undead march along the ocean floor was unforgettable, and seeing our two dueling skeletal captains dancing in and out of the death-knelling moonlight lives up to the trailer moment.

This film is simply fun for everyone and if someone tells you its not, they're probably just a constipated grump. Dont listen to constipated grumps! Moreover, I find the film is just as enjoyable today!",1494979200,,3960,5.186813186813187

Pirates of the Caribbean is a farce and a fun one at that.  While a tad long, weighing in at 150+ minutes, it's a decent enough movie the entire family can watch it together.

Fabulous fantasy brilliantly scripted, directed, acted, against a heavenly backdrop - kudos to the scout/producer, whomever decided on location. This is quite possibly one of the most tightly choreographed swashbucklers of all time. Every swish and swoop is executed with Olympian sportsmanship and accuracy.

There is plenty of swashbuckling action to enjoy and Depps performance is justifiably acclaimed, but it certainly goes on for a long time.  There is a shorter, more direct plot concealed in the overly busy script, and the filmmakers would have done well to find it.  It seems that a good deal of the carnage would not have happened had our heroes simply helped the crew of the Black Pearl to defeat the curse once they realized what was happening.  Maybe I missed a good reason why they didnt, but it seems that it would have been the humane and logical course of action.",1477180800,,788,4.688405797101449

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

1481457,5,B00005JM5E,"OMG do I love this movie! I must be the last person on Earth who never saw any of these movies when they came out, which is surprising considering I'm a huge Johnny Depp fan. I honestly don't know how I avoided seeing them all these years--and I wish I had seen this first edition in the series on the big screen. But I did watch it (blu ray) in a 44"" TV from just a few feet away, lol, and I loved it! I mean I really LOVED it. I can't wait to watch it again.

Yes, the plot is a bit convoluted here and there and they probably had to stitch a lot of little things together in what must have been a massive, beyond massive, editing job--but it all works. The storyline is brilliant, the special effects are the best I've ever seen (no doubt among the best ever created--possibly the very best) and the acting is superb. Johnny Depp is just off the charts.

My only complaint about this set (the 3-disc blu ray) is that the menus are kind of cumbersome at times. And unlike a lot of discs that will track where you were when you shut things down during a screening, this one doesn't--it drags you back into all of that opening nonsense and the previews. You can (fortunately) fast-forward through it all, but it's tiring.

Than minor criticism aside, one of my favorite films of all time. I hope I'll watch it many times.",1463270400,8,1321,4.234126984126984
1481458,3,B00005JM5E,"The best of this movie revolved around actors Depp and Rush.  Otherwise, too much with the special effects, goofy skeleton pirates (it didn't work in Sinbad and it didn't work here), generally uninteresting story, and its running time was too long.  On the good side, there are a lot of extras and several commentaries, which can be more interesting than the movie itself.  Of course, it could be years until I get around to viewing the extras.",1463270400,,444,4.740259740259741

1481517,5,B00005JM5E,"I write stemming from my husbands dream because I decided to watch The Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of The Black Pearl film less than 14 days ago after my husband explained that he had a dream of me being a space pirate who was as daring as the Captain Jack Sparrow character with a good heart. Out of curiosity, I decided to check out this film because The Pirates of the Caribbean; Curse of the Black Pearl was released around the time my husband and I were stationed in Japan (through the U.S. Navy). Additionally, my husband had this space pirate dream within the same 8 hour timeframe that I dreamed of being back in the U.S. Navy. Anyhow, The Pirates of the Caribbean; Curse of the Black Pearl stars Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow,Orlando Bloom as Will Turner, and Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann. The character of Captain Jack Sparrow ends up unexpectedly meeting both Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner spontaneously.  The fact that Captain Jack Sparrow meets both Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner so closely foreshadows the significance that these two characters are going to have on his life.  As the movie shows, the character of Captain Jack Sparrow is complex because on one hand he does end up raising the ire of influential people in power, yet at the same time the film does show moments where the character of Jack Sparrow shows his humanity and benevolent nature.  Of course there are more actors and actresses that play a role in this film, yet I must refrain from saying more to minimize giving away too much of the film.",1460851200,,1548,4.642335766423358

There are several very violent scenes where the pirates invade a town and people (both pirates and townsfolk) are killed by stabbing, shooting, etc.  There is a brief scene of a very young child lost, scared, and crying for his mother, which would likely be disturbing to children.  The pirates take the form of rotting skeletons in many scenes throughout the movie and look pretty gruesome.  A wonderful movie, great acting, but make sure your kids are ready for the violence.  I watched it in the theater when it came out and had forgotten how violent and scary some of the scenes are... I just let my 4th-grade daughter watch it -- she did okay and overall she enjoyed the movie, but some of the scenes were intense for her.

1481740,4,B00005JM5E,"Very entertaining theme park ride-turned-swashbuckler film, with plenty of action, adventure, romance, humor and creepiness. The film really hits the mark with its authentic feel - the pirates look and sound like grubby creeps with their yelling, shooting, drinking and general misbehaving. It's a fun ride, but probably more ideal for older viewers due to scenes of animated skeletons and some suggestive material. Johnny Depp rules this film as Captain Jack. His character is entertaining, hilarious, and completely drives the film.  The sequels to this film, though, left much to be desired, so enjoy this first outing.

1482359,5,B00005JM5E,"This movie works on many levels. It uses its charm subtly, has good moments with good writing, a strong cast...but it also is still the first of the lot. This movie, like the Matrix, introduces an exciting world that keeps a good sense of a simple story. We know about pirates from the old days, and we know how they tended to act and fare. And they stick with that by slipping in a little fantasy, but nothing too crazy or over the top. But also, like the Matrix, it flows from start to finish to give a real ambiguous ending that you can use to make your own stories of what could happen.

Alas, like the original Matrix, later installments tend to look prettier but tend to blow themselves up with content and not get enough cohesion. That should not discourage you at all from owning this. I feel that there are some movies that once they get sequel-fied, they tend to not translate well enough with the worlds they have created. Some movies are best left alone at one, while others are best enjoyed with just the first movie of the lot. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a movie that can stand out on its own in someone's collection. And given the recent craze of piracy along the lines of Black Sails and Crossbones in media, this is surely a prime example of why pirates are fun.",1443916800,,1310,4.346938775510204

1482508,5,B00005JM5E,"Chances are by now most know enough of the movies to know what they are and are not.  Curse of the Black Pearl was obviously the first in the chain of ""Pirates"" movies, modeled after the ride at the Disney Theme Parks.  In fact, this is the movie that takes elements from the ride and weaves it into the story.  It has the most basic, and probably least bloated stories of the entire series of movies.  And, it is probably the one that does not seem like it takes 2+hrs to sit through because the story is fun and the pacing is good.

It involves the main three characters, Captain Jack Sparrow (played wonderfully by Johnny Depp), Will Turner (played by Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightly).  Apart from the main three there is a huge ensemble cast made up mainly of character actors, all of whom play much larger roles in the movie than any other movies they have appeared in.  As good and original as Depp was in the movie, Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa stole every scene he was in, and the scenes with he and Depp together were the best part of the movie in my opinion.  It had the perfect blend of action, mystery, thrills and humor.  It definitely did not take itself to seriously, something that cannot necessarily be said for the sequels, and really wrapped up its part of the story by the end.  You can however see the seeds they were sewing for the subsequent movies by leaving Will's background a mystery.

As far as extras go, there are a ton of behind the scenes and making of features, as well as deleted scenes and a blooper reel.  Also included is the TV special about the making of the ride that aired in the 1960s.  All in all you get a good 2 plus hours of material.  Great for those who like going through all the bonus material.  And of course, the movie looks and sounds great on blu ray.  In fact seeing it on an HD television was the thing that persuaded me to jump into the blu ray discs.  You definitely will not be disappointed with the picture and sound.",1440892800,,2001,4.350404312668464

There does't have to be anything in this movie to necessarily seriously critique, it's just a movie that if your going to watch it, it can just be let alone as entertaining. As far as Pirate movies go, PotC is just made for entertainment and if you like pirates and movies about pirates then it is a very good possibility you will like this movie. As in many movies a few lines or scenes probably aren't necessary but it doesn't detract from the film. Actors do what is needed, don't overact just make the movie enjoyable. Script makes for a good pirate story and the movie score definitely adds to the film. Rate this 3.0 - 4.0 stars out of 5 simply for the entertainment and probably for the music score that adds to the film.",1438128000,2,842,4.3354430379746836

many things that I was into).  I absolutely loved this movie.  Orlando
Bloom is great as the hero blacksmith Will Turner and so is Keira
Knightly as Elizabeth Swan.  Special effects are great as Will seeks
to rescue Elizabeth, the woman he loved from a band of cursed pirates.
His only aid is another Pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow.  Will they rescue
Elizabeth?  Will Capt. Jack Sparrow ever decide whose side he is on?
Must watch!  Check out the sequels!

I loved a lot of Depp's movies before this (like Edward Scissor Hands and Ed Wood ) but this was just crap. It had a great idea, great actors, great characters, great look but what a terrible story.  Just the same thing over and over (girl gets kidnapped, then she is free, then she gets kidnapped, then free, and etc.) and they just drag it on and on. The fight scenes are entertaining for a bit (kind of like the 1980's action adventure movies of old) but then they too get to long. It was good idea and maybe if I were a kid I would have loved it (I doubt it though) but it was just plain boring.",1426204800,,690,3.964028776978417

OMG it was so good. I do think though that Johnny Depp made the movie. He is such a talented actor and can do such a variety of roles. The movie was great for kids and for adults.

WOW was I surprised. The movie ended up being a fun, action-filled ride and Depp was a surprise that stole the show. I've heard some of the later films in the franchise turned out to be disappointing, but this one was a great time, and enough fun that we've enjoyed watching it again and again.",1395273600,,489,4.268817204301075

1484616,5,B00005JM5E,"No matter how many Pirates of the Caribbean movies have come out and no matter how many everr will come out, this one will always be the best.  I often find myself wondering if the idea for at least the original trilogy had already been in place when this film was being made or if it was concieved after this film's success at the box office.  Sadly, I'm leaning in favor of the latter scenerio.  But again, this film was awsome and deserves all the praise and sequels it can get.  As anyone can probably guess, Johny Dep's Jack Sparrow stole the show, even when he wasn't in a scene.  Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom were also great, though I think Ms. Knightley was more lively...maybe that's because she plays second fiddle to Jack Sparrow, knows it, and wants to live up to the honor.  Well Ms. Knightley, your effort paid off.  I have never heard of Geoffrey Rush before (sorry to admit that), but his performance as the villainous Hector Barbossa was another effort that paid off.  Mr. Rush, I happily place you up among the likes of Anthony Hopkins and Heeth Ledger...well done, Sir, well done.  Overall, this film did not make a single mistake when it came to casting.  Furthermore, the set pieces were thenominal, putting us right in that time period.  You'll just about forget you're simply watching a movie.  I don't know if this film will ever be released in a 3-D version, but I don't care.  This film has plenty of realism and 3-D for me.  Enjoy.",1394064000,,1463,4.513307984790875

1484681,4,B00005JM5E,"I chose a four-star rating because this is a generally great movie. To me, it's the perfect blend of action, comedy, horror, and mystery. I would recommend this to any tween, because although it's rated PG-13, it's not as bad as they say it is. (Movie ratings are always exceedingly cautious.) This movie is epic, because it tells the story of the amazingly talented negotiator, Jack Sparrow, the natural beauty and leader Elizabeth Swan, and the sword fighter Will Turner. While Will sets out to rescue Elizabeth from the wily pirates on the ""Black Pearl"", Jack Sparrow sets a goal to get back his beloved ship, so the cursed men on the ship can't keep it any longer. It's a rather interesting storyline, and I highly recommend this movie to a tween who is looking for a unique, entertaining movie. *Please note that this movie has a few sexual-related sentences and scary images that may not be appropriate for young kids.",1387670400,,924,4.745341614906832

This movie with it superb plot, excellent acting, and beautifully shot scenes will transform you into the world of Captain Jack Sparrow and all of his pirate partners in crime for a real life It's A Small World, so the magical fantasy of the animated automatons has been transformed to the real life flesh and blood actors, and, it is just as amazing.",1377475200,,783,4.5

Depp went too far with his characterization, though I generally love his work. Special effects were good but standard for the time.  I loved the nods to the original ride (which I never went on but saw Disney video of) for example the drunk on the wine barrel among others.

The skeleton pirates are really cool, and the film is just really fun to watch.

1485199,5,B00005JM5E,"Please note, this review is for the contents of the blu ray edition, not the movie itself.

Many movies transferred to blu ray will have a very similar quality to the DVD version.  I've even seen some movies that appear to be worse on blu ray then their DVD counterpart.  This blu ray is of AMAZING quality.  To compare, I used the scene of Jack and Elizabeth stranded on the island (the famous ""Why is the rum gone?"" scene).  I never realized how fuzzy the picture in the DVD was.  The sand, waters, and detail of the clothing is all muddled.  The sound is decent, but compressed.  On the blu ray version, the sand is crisp, the waves of the waters are very detailed, you can even see the individual strands of hair on Jack's beard.  The sound is powerful and the bass sounds of the explosions comes through crystal clear.

The special features include everything that you got with the DVD version as well as a ""Scoundrels at sea"" feature that plays during the movie.  Turn on this feature and the pop ups appear during the film and you can select these pop ups for additional informational movies.  The main menu has also been changed from the medallion theme to a talking skull.  The skull is pretty cool looking, but can be annoying since you will make your selection, and he still wants to talk to you.

Bottom line, even if you have the DVD version of this movie, this is one that's worth the upgrade.  Currently, this retails for less than $10 on Amazon, so a great bargin, too.",1374537600,3,1485,4.428044280442805

The CGI is great. The film, for the most part, is simple, straight-up entertainment. The characters capture one's heart and the story moves along at a good pace.

There are several 'homage' moments to particular scenes found in the Disney ride, such as the iconic scene in the jail with the mutt and the keys.",1372464000,,478,4.901234567901234

1485298,5,B00005JM5E,"Saw this a bunch of years ago, but felt like watching it again on my son Zen's request. Zen has been interested in the soundtrack music.

Personally, I'm interested in seeing Keith Richard's appearances in the third and fourth movies.

The film is good, and full of crackling dialogue.

""I never would have thought of that.""
""Clearly, you've never been to Singapore.""

""Take what you can, give nothing back.""

""What did you make the rope with?""
""Human hair. From my back.""

""Thank you, Jack.""
""You're welcome.""
""Not you - we named the monkey Jack.""

Overall the film is full of great action, some of it by the wild-eyed, gaunt and stunningly beautiful Keira Knightly, some good humour, and the corny fun of ""pirates"" and ""Caribbean"", with its cast of scalawags and scoundrels and campy Hollywood soundstage scenes (ie the pirate's port). Johnny Depp creates a character with such goofy charm that we don't even mind the Luke Skywalker-edness of Orlando Bloom.

One of the interesting things about the film is the perception that the sets are real, that the boats are real, and that the explosions and stunts are real. The use of computer graphics seems to have been kept to a minimum, the important exception probably being the view of the ghouls preparing for attack by marching the ocean floor - a cool scene indeed. The other ghoul effects are also very cool - when moonlight touches the pirates their ghoul selves are revealed. This is done in a very spectacular cinematographic way, such as when Barbossa steps into the moonlight, uncorks a bottle of wine, and you see it flow through him. No wonder he looks on so enviously as Elizabeth tucks in to some real food, and Jack eats an apple.",1372032000,,1694,4.738095238095238

1485373,5,B00005JM5E,"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a fantasy film, that came into theatres 2003, which is based on the Pirates of the Caribbean Rollercoaster at Disney World. As the title already reveals the film deals with pirates. There is the pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who has lost his ship - the Black Pearl - to his former first mate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). On his chase he is supported by the young blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who wants to rescue his love Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly). The Governer's daughter is kipnapped by the crew of the Black Pearl and is the first to discover their secret.
The, also financially, very successful movie is a great spectacle. It includes humor, fun, action and a story with surprising twists that captures its audience. Regarding the perfect cast, Jerry Bruckheimer understands how to put his actors in action and how to underline the originality of each character. This leads to a very specific character, namely Jack Sparrow, who's uniqueness keeps the audience's attention on him for the entire, relatively long movie (144 minutes). But it is also the love story of young Will Turner and the noble Elizabeth Swann who, quite quickly comes to like the thrills of the buccaneer's life, which provides many humoristic moments, especially in the interaction with a bunch of dead guys - Barbossa's Crew.",1370995200,,1386,4.952789699570816

Parts of the movie gave the feeling of being claustrophobic and missing out on some of the action going on around the primary characters.

1485460,5,B00005JM5E,"There were no scratches, no defects in play. I was a bit disappointed how the pixels showed often, but that's probably due to the type of TV I have. It came in a Special 2 Disc Edition which was awesome. The ONE thing I didn't like about it is the inside of the jacket has white ash and smells as though the owner smoked a pipe. The smell is now gone since it's been here a few days at least. I love how the movie has at least a fair amount of humor and a good story. I loved this series as a kid, even though I didn't really understand the movies at the time. I just don't like how green screens become more obvious the second time you watch a movie you really enjoy, though. And I do wish they had more humor though, I mean it's Johnny Depp for crying out loud! There shouldn't be one seen he's in that something funny doesn't happen, which I believe every seen he's in he does or says something idiotic or witty. So an awesome movie. I mean, some of the dialect I do not understand, but all in all a wonderful series.

1486052,3,B00005JM5E,"I thought this movie was alright as a college student. Watching it a second time years later, it's boring. It's just a kid's movie, with way too much fluff. The director just wanted to make a 2 hour and 30 minute movie out of sheer pretentious. It's an element that effected the two similarly long-winded sequels. It's quite a shocker that the 4th was actually pretty good, given that the new director managed to efficiently tell a story without ridiculously requiring the film last almost 3 hours!

The movie did remind me of all the times I was required in school to write 10 page papers on subjects that only required a few. Why not put out the best product instead of adhering to ridiculous lengths mandated by yourself?",1344038400,,724,4.612403100775194
1486053,5,B00005JM5E,"First off, let me state, if you've seen my others reviews, you will see that I'm not much of a modern movie fan, most of the movies I like are the ones I grew up with, now set aside a few like the Bourne trilogy, the Batman trilogy and the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and honestly, I loved this trilogy, and I will state why.

First off, the acting in these (I know I'm reviewing only the first one, but I like all 4, but this one is the best if the series) but anyways, the acting in these are superb, of course we all know Johnny Depp is a fantastic actor, but he really shines on these, it's like he was really there, the way he talks, the way he acts, in my opinion, he should have won awards for these, and Kierra Knightley was great as well, she brought Elizabeth Swann to life, and she's very likeable, and Orlando Bloom (who I became a fan of after seeing the LOTR trilogy) is a perfect cast for Will Turner, really fits the part well and does a great job at bringing him to life, and finally Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, I mean was this guy really a pirate? you would think so after watching him perform this role, he really cared about his performance, as they all did, and that brings me to another reason why I like these films so much, is that the characters are really likeable and well acted.

Another thing, the production is superb, not over done with CGI, and some really nice sets and costumes that are really period correct, and the story is captivating and well thought out, with a great blend of action, drama, and some off beat comedy, it will make you excited, it will make you laugh, and most of all, it will make you like Pirates, another thing I must mention is the music, fits the movie really well, and the camera work is excellent, really capturing the feel of the film.

Now like I said, this one is the best of the series in my opinion, but don't let that deter you from checking out the other 3 if you enjoyed this one, because they are good too.",1343606400,,1976,4.181102362204724
1486054,5,B00005JM5E,"I am kind of new to the blue ray experience but this is one of my all time favorite movies. The story line was outstanding and the characters are fascinating to watch interact. I love the story but when it comes to being on Blue Ray it is even better.

The picture quality is phenomenal on our new digital television and clear as if I were on the set. It's well worth the money and the quality is amazing.

I am madly in lust -- er, in love with Johnny Depp. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are also very charming and seductive. So in addition to great photography and special effects and great settings and all of the rest, there's a baser stimulation to watching these healthy young bodies go running around and jumping in the ocean and all the rest.

Fine. There's also some incredible special effects, one heck of a good story, Captain Jack's off-beat but delightful -- no, make that off-beat AND delightful sense of humor, the stimulation of lots of fast action, and not all that much blood. After all, most of the people who get run through with swords are already dead.

1486137,3,B00005JM5E,"So I wrote these for my blog originally, but I decided to put them up here as well. If you liked this, read the others because they're meant to play off each other.

Pirates of the Caribbean I: Curse of the Black Pearl

This is the best movie out of all of them, I will admit, and I liked this one for a lot longer than the others. But yet, there are still lots of flaws in it. First of all, I would like to put forward my opinion on Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. Did this guy ever play a normal roll? I can't figure out why Jack Sparrow is everyone's favorite character. He's filthy (Not like Aragorn from Lord of the Rings filthy--he who can wear grease very well--but stand-five-miles-away filthy), he's a very bad pirate, and why do all the girls like him because he's not even good looking? Yes, real pirates and seamen were dirty, but Jack Sparrow would never have survived in real life as a pirate. He understands little to nothing about tactics, he seems to play everything by chance, and he's not a character anyone can particularly sympathize with. Your main character cannot be the comic relief. It does not work that way. You can't sympathize with him because he's a huge daftie who is more than a little crazy, and he doesn't even really have a redeemable character. So what is the point in making a character like this, espicially one you're supposed to root for?

Moving on to the other characters in the movie: Elizabeth. I will say something for this series and that is that they NEVER ONCE succeeded in creating a likable female character. Elizabeth is just the kind of female protagonist that I CANNOT stand. She's so gaga in love, but yet she can't decide who she should actually be in love with. Commodore Norrington? Will Turner the blacksmith? or, yes, even smelly Jack Sparrow the pirate who saved her because she fell into the water when her corset was too tight. We obviously see she and Will are going to end up together, why bother with this insane love triangle (or rather, love square)? She's not even smart, and she assumes she can do everything. And where exactly did she learn to fight with a sword? it just magically happens all of a sudden. She's such a predictable, typical female character that always shows up in movies like this that it's just boring!

Now, Will Turner wasn't so bad, though he was a bit of a static character because he really didn't change at all through the whole series, and if he had been really smart he would have just left Elizabeth alone and found a better girl because she had a serious track record of getting men killed and she wasn't even worth it. This isn't my favorite role for Orlando Bloom, I thought he did much better as Legolas and way way better as Buckingham in The Three Musketeers, but I don't really have anything against him. He does okay in the role of swashbuckling hero but yet his character's nothing really special. I think this is mainly because everyone gets overshadowed by Jack Sparrow who should really be the comic relief side-kick instead of the main character.

Now the two characters I liked were Barbosa and Commodore Norrington. Barbosa was a great pirate and if he had been the main pirate in this series instead of Jack Sparrow I probably would have enjoyed these movies a lot more. He had that classic swashbuckler Errol Flynn feel to him, and I love that. He had all the best lines as well, and frankly, he was the only person who ever did anything (besides Will) in the whole movie! Now Norrington on the other hand, was a great character, though I might be biased because I love the British Navy (mainly because of Horatio Hornblower). I think Norrington had a lot of potential to be great... if he had been cast as a character in a Hornblower or Jack Aubrey type movie. He didn't need to be stuck with all this supernatural junk and it ended up being the death of him, literally. Oh wait, that was actually Elizabeth...but I get ahead of myself.

Which brings me to the main problem I had with this series. This first one was not quite as bad as the others. I could get the Aztec gold and how it was cursed and the bone pirates weren't too bad either. Still a little weird for a classical swashbuckler, but not as bad as it gets in the later movies. The plot line in this movie was definitely more understandable than the ones to follow. At least there were no moments where you had to sit and stare at the TV going...wait, what just happened?

This movie seems to have a happy Princess Bride ending to it. Will get his (air-headed) girl, Jack gets his ship. Norrington...well, he gets the shaft, poor dear, but you know what? He didn't have to get stuck with Elizabeth! He should have been happy!

But, unfortunately, despite appearances, this was in fact not the ending, it was a start of another one of those really long and utterly tiring movie series that by the fourth or (heaven help us) the fifth everyone starts groaning and writing reviews like this... *shifty eyes*

- Great story and characters

Jack Sparrow became an instant legend after this movie as a crazy but smart drunk pirate.
This movie establishes the base for the other 3 though it can easily stand by itself.

1486502,5,B00005JM5E,"Films with pirates have been around since the creation of Peter-Pan. When different directors portray their own version of Peter-Pan, they tend to focus on Peter-Pan and then his archrival Hook. However, this was the case until 1991, when director Steven Spielberg released ""Hook"". Instead of being Peter-Pan for Halloween, kids were dressing up as Captain Hook and pirates. This trend lasted until 2003, when Disney released ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"".

""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is about a group of cursed pirates who are searching for one last piece of Gold they need in order for the curse to be broken. In Port Royal, the governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) has the last piece, and is clueless to its value. She found it on an almost dead William Turner (Orlando Bloom).
During a ceremony in Port Royal, Ms. Swan faints into the ocean, where Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) rescues her. While in the water, Ms. Swan had the Gold piece, which sent out a signal when it hit water to the pirates in pursuit.
Later that night, the pirates find her and take her. This upsets young William Turner and he requests that he be on the expedition to rescue her. When he is turned down, William decides to ask prisoner Captain Jack Sparrow if he knows where the pearl (their ship) makes birth. Being that Sparrow used to be the Captain of ""the pearl"" he knows all of the information William needs to know, William decides to break Sparrow out with the agreement that he will lead him to ""the pearl"".

What makes this film as great as it is, is the acting of Johnny Depp. He truly does do an incredible job playing the role of a pirate and single-handedly changes the way a pirate is perceived.
Also, ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" is very family friendly. Teenagers, Young-Teenagers and even adults will enjoy this film, as there is action, romance and drama.",1307664000,,1904,4.6805970149253735

Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley made perfect lovers, however generic, by simply being Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley.  It was their spirited entry into the mad world of Jack Sparrow that raised their situation from one of bathos to that of high adventure.

The upside down world created by the authors of the script managed to make pirates of us all by juxtaposing our rather dogmatic assumption that ""authority"" is always right or has a higher reason to be that benefits us all against our assumption that resistance to authority is ""wrong"" and a threat to us all.  In fact, if taken from a purely philosophical perspective, neither proposition is absolutely correct.  Taking either conformity or rebellion to extremes has proved devastating to society.

The first Pirates Of The Caribbean movie I saw was the second one, Dead Man's Chest (2006).  I saw it at a drive-in in July 2006.  What a nice summer night that was.  The movie, however, I thought was mediocre.  I figured the first movie would have to be better, and it definitely was.

Disney's Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl (2003) is everything a pirate movie should be.  It has action, adventure, fighting, treasure hunting, great daytime and nighttime atmosphere, everything you can think of when it comes to pirates sailing the Caribbean Sea.  This movie was based on the Disney ride of the same name.  Johnny Depp delivers a great performance, as does the nice looking Keira Knightley.

The special effects are truly awesome.  Sure, some CGI was used, but it wasn't overdone, in my opinion.  This movie really captures the feel and atmosphere and look of the Caribbean and pirate ships.  It was actually filmed in the Caribbean, not in California or some similar place.

The second DVD features over 10 hours (that's right) of extras.  Everything from how the movie was made to deleted and alternate scenes, audio commentary, blooper reels, a history of pirates, an image gallery, and so much more.  It'll keep you entertained for, well, over 10 hours.

If you like pirates, then you should see this movie.  Entertaining and visually stunning, I highly recommended this movie.",1283644800,3,1547,4.806083650190114

1486847,5,B00005JM5E,"POTC: Curse of the Black Pearl was released in the summer of 2003. Like the first ""Spiderman"" it represented an optimistic attitude following the September 11th attacks. When released in theaters, I underestimated ""Pirates"" like most. But when I watched I was instantly taken by the fun flowing story and Johnny Depp's Comedic timing as Captain Jack Sparrow. The story is set into motion when Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley) falls off a cliff into the water below. She wears an aztec gold coin around her neck and once it hits the water it calls out to pirates who need it to reverse a terrible curse on their lives. When they come to retrieve the coin Elizabeth is kidnapped. This event begins the plot to which Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) seeks to rescue her with the help of Jack Sparrow. While we wonder exactly who Jack is fighting for Will discovers his life is not always what he thought it was.

The most common complaint of POTC 1 is it's too long. Maybe, but for me the length is justified. The action, including many sword fights, is creative and non repetitious. The story and how realistically grimy the people are should have made this tale too dark. But the genius of Johnny Depp not turning his role into something too serious; made Captain Jack Sparrow join the ranks of Han Sol<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-The-Curse-of-the-Black-Pearl-Piano-Solo-Songbook/dp/0634067699/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl (Piano Solo Songbook)</a>o.",1278633600,,1565,5.361788617886178

It's a funny, swashbuckling adventure.  The plot is basically an excuse to give the pirates as much screentime as possible, but it works well enough and has enough suspense to keep viewers entertained.  Johnny Depp really carries the movies as Captain Jack Sparrow, the witty, amoral pirate captain. Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly are also good, and the supporting actors (including the monkey) have some funny scenes. This movie is easily the best of the three.

1486851,4,B00005JM5E,"Disney didn't do so bad by creating a movie out of an already established theme park attraction(theirs of course)and came up with a successful trilogy that has so far put around $3 billion into that empires coffers;an amazing feat by any measure. It also re-invented the pirate genre and whether you're a fan of it or not,this movie appealed to people across the board with its' universal themes of good against evil and love lost and found. It also couldn't have been accomplished in quite the fashion it had if not for a certain Mr. Depp. Totally ""a-depp-t"" at playing off beat characters Depp imbued his character with a certain je ne sais quoi;an off beat combination of drunkenness,delirium and effeminacy. One has to see the performance to appreciate it but it is,in my opinion,why ""Pirates"" did the business it did in the first place and garnered the wide appeal it otherwise wouldn't have had.
Pirates of the Caribbean-The curse of the Black Pearl""(released July/03)involves the story of one pirate by the name of Captain Jack Sparrow(Depp).Jack arrives via a sinking boat. It is a Buster Keaton gag in reverse(you will recall Depps Keaton-like portrayal in ""Benny and Joon"" and his self professed interest in same).Instead of in Keatons ""The Boat"" with the vessel launching and sinking totally into the water,here we have Sparrow arriving into Port Royal as the boat sinks and he steps daintily onto the jetty without getting his feet wet. Sparrow has arrived to commandeer one of His Majesty's ships to find and regain control of the Black Pearl taken away from him by another pirate Barbossa(Geoffrey Rush).At this time a local naval Capt. Norrington(Jack Davenport)is being promoted to Commodore and just after the ceremony he is standing with the governor's daughter Elizabeth(Keira Knightley)on the forts parapet and proposing to her .With a too tight corset binding her waist she suddenly faints and falls into the water. Capt. Sparrow sees the fall and jumps in and saves her life. When they are reunited with dry land Sparrow gets arrested for the pirate he is,but before they can put him in irons he leads them all on a merry chase. One hiding place leads him into a blacksmith shop co-run by one Will Turner(Orlando Bloom).Sword play ensues until Jack is cornered and is finally taken prisoner.
While in jail his ship The Black Pearl arrives into the harbour and sets about with some severe mayhem and destruction. They were drawn there by a medallion of Mayan gold which hangs around the neck of Elizabeth who is taken prisoner by Capt. Barbossa,who knows she holds an important key to undoing the curse which is upon him and his crew. The crew and he are cursed as half alive and half dead men because they stole the Mayan gold and spent it. They have spent years collecting it all and Elizabeth holds one of the last important pieces. The ship nows heads to the Island of the Dead to return all the stolen pieces of gold;with Sparrow and blacksmith Will Turner(Elizabeth's true love) in pursuit.
Barbossa believing Elizabeth's lie that she is the daughter of a former Black Pearl crewman by the name of Bootstrap Bill Turner,returns her gold coin and offers up some of her blood to dispel the curse. Of course this doesn't work and Sparrow is on hand to battle Barbossa. However Will knocks Jack out and steals off with Elizabeth. When Jack comes to he barters with Barbossa and agrees to lead him to the real descendant of Bootstrap Bill. Barbossa charges after Turner and the ship is sunk and so are Jacks bargaining chip. He and Elizabeth are stranded on a desert island together. Elizabeth lights a giant bonfire which attracts the attentions of a passing British ship commanded by Commodore Norrington. They proceed to the Island of the Dead in order to capture the pirates. They plan an ambush but in the meantime Jack persuades Barbossa to capture the British ship sitting out in the harbour. Barbossa's  crew indeed infiltrates the ship and in the meantime Elizabeth frees the Black Pearl crew who instead of helping sail off. Elizabeth returns to the island and frees Will. Will and Jack(who also has a piece of gold) throw them into the chest and the curse is finally lifted. As it does Jack fires a shot into Barbossa thus killing him and his crew fighting to overtake the British ship surrenders now that they are mortal.
Back at Port Royal Jack and Will are scheduled to be executed but Elizabeth stands up for them both. Will is pardoned while Jack escapes by jumping into the bay and is rescued by the Black Pearl crew. When asked for directions Jack consults his wonky compass and they sail away to new adventures. However the film ends at the Island of the Dead as a monkey of Barbossa's grabs one of the gold pieces from the chest and the curse is re-instated.
This film is a typical Bruckheimer venture with lots and lots of non stop action and SFX mixed together with a good sense of humour throughout. The picture contains a wonderful cast from Knightly and Bloom as the love interests,Jonathan Pryce as the doting but sometimes misguided father/Governor of Jamaica,Rush does a great stereo-typical pirate,several actors do funny turns as crew members both for the pirates and the British,etc. But the numero uno and top dog throughout the entire proceedings is Johnny Depp. He devours the scenery every time he is on screen and completely dominates the picture. His turn as Capt. Jack Sparrow is a marvelous piece of acting as he creates before our eyes a very eccentric character that you can't help but empathize with.
It is no wonder this film was the hit it was with such talent on hand.
Technically this two disc set has been transferred wonderfully in both the sight and sound departments. It is presented in its widescreen format and is viewable with DTS 5.1 or Dolby 5.1 sound. Extras include:deleted and alternate scenes,blooper reels,audio commentaries,featurettes:the making of,history of pirates,""diary of a pirate"" and""diary of a ship"",producers photo gallery,image galleries,scene progression for the underwater ""dead' sequence and many extras for viewing on a computer.

So you probably already know by now how much you like this film, but you're wondering whether to get it on blu-ray.  I'll tell you then quality is fantastic and I couldn't spot any defects.  The special features carried over and most of those are pretty fun.  The sound is stellar to compliment the picture.  And last but not least, it just looks good in your collection with the matching sleeves and set up.  I'll be getting the other two films in the series in the near future.

The only complaint I would have, is that some of the features are a little over the top.  Anyone who watches special features most likely won't like little games and treasure hunts.  We just want segments of behind the scenes and one commentary.  On this Blu-ray we have three commentaries(two too much) and a bunch of useless special features aside from the good ones.  That is my only shrug about this release.

#1 in the franchise will always be the best.  Even if you did not like the other two, I see Curse of the Black Pearl essential to any Blu-ray collection.",1274054400,3,1319,4.576923076923077

If you are thinking about watching this movie then please do it! I remember when I first seen it advertisted I thought, umm do I really want to watch a Pirate movie? But after watching it I was so impressed! It really isn't done cheesy at all like you see in the old pirate movies.

For the pirates to break the curse, they have to get all of the gold back and offer up blood with it.  I know that's a fast review, but that's the core of the movie.

The characters are fantastic!! I love Jack Sparrow! When I think of the word ""pirate"" he comes to mind. Depp portrayed Sparrow in a fantastic way! He brought so much life, wit, humor, charm and personality to Sparrow. Sparrow adds to much to the movie.  All of the characters play off Sparrow so well it gives the movie depth.  The other characters, Will, Elisabeth, the commander, Barbasossa and the pirates are fantastic!

This movie has so many plot twists that will keep the viewer glued to the very end, and wanting more. I know I did.

The transfer to blu ray is the best transfer I've ever seen! I was honestly blow away.  The sound is fantastic! You really hear the explosions and the waves at the ships sail through the water.  The sound is amazing! I just couldn't believe what I was hearing. It honestly was that good!  The image transfer was outstanding! The images were so crisp, clear and sharp it adds a wonderful aspect to the movie. As I said, this was the BEST movie transfer to Blu Ray that I've ever seen.  You can set the movie so it will little facts will pop up and tell you pirate facts that deal with the movie. This adds a great feature to a FANTASTIC movie!! Kuddo's!

However, although all these movies have amazing entertainment value, their scripts and storytelling SUCK in a way no movie has managed to suck.

There is zero cohesion, closure, and at least half of all the subplots you're introduced to vanish in the story without making any sense.

What follows is Elizabeth's nightmare capture by the frightening ghostly pirates, while Captain Sparrow has to dodge the British Navy, whom have sentenced him to death, escaping several near hangings, and escapades with the heroes and villains through the enchanting Caribbean islands.

1487232,5,B00005JM5E,"There's a reason why the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films are so popular . . . the action and adventures are endless! It's not just the unforgettable cast (Depp and Rush definitely steal the show as Jack Sparrow and Captain Barbossa), it's also the kick@$$ action sequences. The many battles in the Caribbean get the good ol' adrenaline pumping when they occur on screen. The music makes it even better: although I'm not a big fan of Hanz Zimmer, he really does know how to make some suspenseful Hollywood music. Humor has a wide range here: it's a Disney film, so there's bound to be comedic sidekicks and silly slapstick. I don't really care much for Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley, but they do add some nice touches.

This isn't for those who are in search of political or social implications. This is a high-octane action-adventure film that I'm sure a majority of the inhabitants on this planet enjoy watching.

A robust adventure with everything you could ask for in an adventure movie.

1487349,5,B00005JM5E,"Let me get to the point.  This is a movie that is filled with adventure and thrills, and is fun at the same time.  Want to stick around for a more in depth look?

Picture being an eight-year boy living near Anaheim when Disneyland opened their new ride ""The Pirates Of The Caribbean"".  I was that eight year old boy.  I left singing ""Yo ho, Yo ho, a pirate's life for me.""

Fast forward a little past four decades, when I finally popped in the DVD of the first of a trilogy of movies ""based on a theme park ride"" (as critics say).  Actually, there are a few scenes in common with the ride (including my favorite, of the dog with keys in his mouth as imprisoned pirates are trying to get the dog in reach to snatch the keys).  There were times I was wondering if I would hear the talking skull and crossbones.  There was a scene when some of the characters were taking a boat into a cave, and I expected them to descend down a waterfall like on the ride.  But they only sang the song a couple of times, and not complete in either case.

This is a summer special effects adventure.  There was one scene that made me think about an Indiana Jones movie.  Let me repeat that line:  There was ONE SCENE that made me THINK about an Indiana Jones movie.  This is a compliment.  It is not a bad thing for an adventure movie to remind one of Indiana Jones; there have been so many adventure movies, it is inevitable for parts of it to have been done before.  The Indiana Jones series is adventure at its best, and it made me THINK of that series, not LONG for it.  There's also a scene that will make you think of Kevin Costner's Robin Hood, and again it is a similar event in both stories.

The story telling is excellent.  It gives you bits and pieces that you will remember as the movie progresses, though it does call for a large dose of suspension of unbelief.  There are lots of twists and turns, and while I guessed one climatic action, most of the movie kept me guessing.

One thing this movie does better than Indiana Jones and ""Robin Hood Prince of Thieves"" -- it is much more fun.  There are movies that have such good all around cast chemistry that it seems like the actors are enjoying their job, which helps me enjoy the movie.  No, this movie didn't earn any Oscar nominations, but the characters are memorable, and even the villains were enjoyable and fun to watch.

This movie is PG-13.  I think that if a parent watches this with a nine or ten year old and talks to them about it, it would be okay.  (Those who know me know I believe that parents should always be with their children when they watch a movie, even a G-rated one.)

This movie is well done, but don't anticipate my watching the other two movies in the series any time soon.  You can say part of it is having watched a movie recently that I regretted, which was a sequel (""Addams Family Values""), so I'm not sure the sequels are as good as the original.  And while I enjoyed it, I did not love it.  It was an entertaining waste of time.  But if you have two and a half hours to spare and want an exciting fun movie, this is a good choice.",1233532800,,3110,4.209813874788494

Who says a theme park ride can't be a good movie? Tell that to Disney because their ride ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" has spawned one of the best film franchises ever and it all started here. ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" was a hit in 2003 and to this day, I watch it all the time. It's fun, funny, action packed, and enthralling and never leaves you bored. It's an instant classic.

Pros:
*Outstanding performances from Depp, Rush, Knightley, and Bloom
*Action packed and funny
*It feels like the ride
*Great and engaging story
*Wonderful music
*A movie you can watch over and over again

Cons:
*I have none!
My rating: 5/5

DVD REVIEW:

Okay, this was released back in the day when the 2nd disc had hours and hours of bonus material. I miss those days. The 1st disc features the main movie. The 2nd disc features everything you could ever want. The ""Epic At Sea"" feature gives you everything you could ever want to know about the making of the movie. There's plenty of insight on the set, and behind the scenes with some of the actors and producer Jerry Bruckheimer. There's so much here, there's nothing left unwanted for the hardcore DVD fan. In conclusion, a must have for movie lovers.

1487596,5,B00005JM5E,"PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL gives movie fanatics something they haven't enjoyed for some time now. A pirate movie that does not condescend to the viewer and shows an admiration for those classic films of the past. With little to cheer about since the days of Captain Blood and The Crimson Pirate, its about time one was made.

Based on the Disney ride of the same name, the movie doesn't just talk about a ride or go near the theme park. Instead, we are given an in depth plot with twists and turns that maneuver the viewer around until the final reel.

Taking place in the Caribbean (hey, didn't you read the title?) the story revolves around a young woman, the daughter of the Governor, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). Fascinated by pirates and all things around them, she helps a young shipwrecked victim named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) on her journey to her new home, taking from his neck a medallion so that he won't be tossed overboard as a pirate.

Years later, now grown, the two are in love but can never show it. She is of the aristocracy and he is a mere blacksmith. But adventure enters their lives and changes things for good.

A run in with a real life pirate named Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), a curse that was placed on the medallion and the entrance of a ghost ship called the Black Pearl result in the capture of Elizabeth. Bound and determined to rescue the woman he loves, Turner sides with Jack and the pair steal a ship, find a crew in Tortuga and set to sea to find the Black Pearl and her crew.

But the captain of the Black Pearl, a pirate known as Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) has plans of his own. It seems that the ship and its crew are cursed. And the only way for them to return to the real world is by collecting the last coin that they stole from an Aztec treasure. That coin is the medallion that Elizabeth wears around her neck. And blood of the person wearing it will be the second item needed for their release.

The action and adventure move along from there as Turner and Sparrow must rescue the fair maiden from the clutches of the evil pirate. But there is more going on beneath the obvious. To find out what, you'll have to see the film.

The action quotient of this movie is over the top. The sets, the costume, the writing, the direction are all up to par for a film of this sort. Johnny Depp turns in one of his most over the top (yes as much as ED WOOD) performances and it suits his character to a T.

The biggest plus for this one though is its special effects. You had to have seen them in the numerous previews already. The pirates are revealed as they truly are under the light of a full moon. Thus we have walking corpses and skeletons setting out to capture the coin and sail a ship to its final destination. These scenes have to be seen to be believed.

If you're looking for something that will beat the summer heat, swash your buckle and hoist your sails, then this movie is the one for you. Entertaining from beginning to end.",1205539200,,3011,4.343416370106762

I do not even pretend to discuss things such as cinematography, direction, etc. but I know a DAMN good story when I see one and this is it.  IMHO only, the second and third installments don't measure up to this classic.

I wish Hollywood would pay attention to what us ""peons"" out here in the real world really like and make more of these type movies.

But, standing on its own, PotC is a wild delight made up of equal parts swashbuckler, horror tale, and love story.  Johnny Depp as the flamboyant Captain Jack Sparrow has spent ten years trying to track down the crew that mutinied, marooned him on an uninhabited islet, and sailed off with his beloved ship, the Black Pearl.  Meanwhile his former first mate, Barbossa, has spent eight of those years struggling to lift from himself and his crew a fearful curse laid on them by their theft of an Aztec treasure.  The final remaining piece of that treasure is in the possession of Elizabeth, daughter of the Royal Governor of Port Royal, and Barbossa's men attack the island to acquire it (""It calls to us,"" says one pirate upon demanding the piece from her).  But there's something else they need to lift the curse: the blood of a fellow mutineer whom they murdered when he tried to dissuade them from taking the treasure.  Since they can't get his, that of his child--Will Turner, the young swordsmith who has loved Elizabeth since they met soon after his ship was attacked by the Pearl's crew--will do.  What they don't at first realize is that Elizabeth isn't the child they want, so they carry her off to Isla de Muerta, their hidden stronghold.  Will, desperate to rescue her, frees Sparrow from prison in hopes of getting his help.  What follows is a rollercoaster of escapes, rescues, duels, splendid sea-fights, and general non-stop action.

In the very nick of time Jack cleverly finds a way to break the curse, and at the end Will and Elizabeth find each other and Jack himself is saved from the gallows.

Depp's performance is a delight throughout (Jack will probably live as one of the best characters created in his career), and the motley crew he gathers up to help him and Will in their pursuit of the Pearl reminds me of Burt Lancaster's in his classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crimson-Pirate/dp/B000096IBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crimson Pirate</a>&nbsp;(there's also a scene fairly early on that's a direct lift from the latter, and anyone who has seen it will recognize it immediately).  Keira Knightley is a very competent heroine with definite tomboy tendencies, whom modern viewers will like, and Orlando Bloom (formerly known as Legolas, the Elven archer, in the LOTR trilogy) as Will does a good job as the young commoner who discovers that a pirate can also be ""a good man.""

So anyway... I liked it. Duh. Everyone likes Pirates. But I have to admit... I liked it for the characters more than the plot or even the fantastic special effects. Because as supernatural and contrived as this ragtag group of buccaneers seem at first glance, they're just... fun!  Jack Sparrow... who doesn't love Jack Sparrow? I mean seriously. Orlando Bloom is hot. Oh, wait, the character, right. I like Will. The stereotypical hero-turned bad boy.  And Keira Knightley, also, is hot, I have to admit. And quite a good actress -- as I understand it, this was her breakout role. It actually makes me curious to see Pride and Prejudice -- it says something about her acting if I actually have DESIRE to go within thirty nine and a half feet of something related to Jane Austen. But I digress.

I will also mention that I saw this movie for the first time before I ever watched BBC (I think it was BBC) series Ultraviolet, starring ""Norrington"" actor Jack Davenport. I'll say, after paying more attention to the character on the second watching -- he's a great actor. The character's... nuanced in ways I didn't pay attention to before.

I'm not going to rehash the plot, because if you haven't already seen it, I don't want to spoil it. But it seems to me it could have used one more... twist. The only ""major"" setback for the villains the audience is anticipating, and everything ends ""as it should"". But again, not spoiling anything...

If you haven't seen it, go rent or buy it. And then get the sequel. And the third film.",1201651200,,1766,4.662379421221865

1487708,4,B00005JM5E,"I am a big fan of 'Dark Rides' and when I heard they were doing a movie based on one of my favorite attractions at Disney World, I was ecstatic. I didn't see this film in theaters and I must confess I fell asleep on it the first time I viewed it in my home on a 36"" screen TV. I have since built a theater in my basement with a 10' screen and that is where all the ""Pirate"" movies should be viewed!......on a big screen.

I watched this film for the second time when 'Dead Man's Chest became available on DVD. I really liked both of these films but, I do not like films that can not be viewed as a whole by themselves. That is the biggest problem with all of these Pirate movies! It's just too much to take in. I watch movies because I want to be entertained for a few hours not rack my brain trying to keep up with a story line that grows bigger and more confusing with each installment.

Now that I have watched the third and not likely the last installment I am more confused than ever. I am rating this movie 4 stars because on it's own ""The Black Pearl"" is a fun,rich looking movie dripping with atmosphere.

1487713,3,B00005JM5E,"I don't go to the theater that often. A film really has to light my fire to get me to actually go out and see it. Well, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" got me interested enough to go see it when it was released in the summer of 2003. Why was I so interested? Probably because I occasionally enjoy fun adventure films in the manner of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) or ""The Mummy"" (1999). ""Black Pearl"" is a film of this ilk.

WHAT WORKS: The film looks and sounds great, which includes the actors, costuming, cinematography, locations and score. Johnny Depp as pirate Capt. Jack Sparrow is a notable character; Sparrow comes off as a young Keith Richards gone Pirate. Keira Knightley is beautiful as Elizabeth Swann; and Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom & Lee Arenberg are all fabulous in their roles.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK: When I first saw it in 2003 the film struck me as too long for such lightweight fare (2 hours and 23 minutes). It also struck me as boring and forgettable. I decided to see it again recently and came away feeling the same way. What makes it boring and forgettable? I don't know, it's hard to pinpoint. Maybe because it's too drawn-out; light fare like this works best at around 80-95 minutes. Maybe it's because many of the characters are unable to die because of the curse, which naturally creates a lack of suspense. Mostly it's because the story and characters, although fun, are absurd and superficial. I suppose it's too much to expect to glean some morsel of depth or truth from a film like this.

CONCLUSION: ""Black Pearl"" is a fun, goofy pirate adventure; it's okay but far from great like, say, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" or even the 1999 version of ""The Mummy."" It's overlong, overly light, kinda boring and ultimately forgettable. I know I'm in the minority here, but I'm not a fan and can't recommend it, except maybe to kids. But if it trips your trigger that's great.

1487815,4,B00005JM5E,"Many many years ago, the stories of pirates died in Hollywood, the interest and freshness just left it, and the name of swashbuckling piracy gathered dust in a box on a shelf in the back of a closet. Then, in 2003, Jerry Bruckheimer found the old box, dusted it off and said to himself ""Hey I could use this!"" And use it, he did.

With an all-star cast and the best crew in town, Jerry set out to do the unthinkable, resurrect the pirate name. Many people, upon seeing the footage-less teaser trailer thought the film would be so bad it would be a joke, but the director, Gore Verbinki proved them all wrong.

Through jolly musical themes, a suprisingly creepy plot, a fantastic cast, and awesome bits of nothing-but-fun action, Pirates of the Caribbean succesfully leaves the veiwer stunned, and wanting more (which, they brought, twice).

If you liked Transformers, Night at the Musiem you will probably like this movie.

It has everything.  A great cast, a great story, great action, and wonderful visuals.  You'll believe you are back in time and living with cutthroats.  But wait there's more, you also have a supernatural element that makes this like Lord of the Rings meets Black Beard the pirate.
The whole idea seems rediculous, but with Johnny Depp as CAPTIAN Jack Sparrow, he makes it all work.  Too be fare Orlando Bloom as Will Turner is the actual hero of the story, but without a doubt Depp is the star.  The movie would not work without him at such a great level.
Then there is Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann, who is as lovely as she is adventrous.  Knightley really is a great actress and her character is essential to the story so she isn't just another pretty girl in an action movie, though undoubtedly she is absolutely beautiful.
I won't go into the story since others here have already, but I will say that if you love pirate movies or action movies or comedies or romance or horror movies, this movie has it all and it's all top notch.

Director Gore Verbinski (Mouse Hunt) gives the audience a refreshing new type of movie which has become extremely popular worldwide (has been translated into more than fifty different languages). Just goes to show how good of a director he is.

Here Johnny Depp gives the performance of his career as Jack Sparrow, followed by a great scrip which is witty, slick and a refreshment in the movie industry followed by a great soundtrack. He is backed up with the handsome blacksmith, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the beautiful governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Australia's very own Geoffrey Rush who plays the cursed Captain Barbossa. All the main characters were excellent. Once the movie begins it doesn't let up until the credits roll. The sword duels, special effects were fantastic, ship battle and even the romance between Will and Elizabeth is sweet.

Since this movie was based on a theme park ride at Disneyworld I thought little of it at the time, until I went to see it at the cinema.

Just watched Pirates 3 today. So i can fairly say, Pirates 1 is by far the best of the trilogy. Not only is it the best of the 3, but the HD quality is at its best too.

i noticed no blemishes, no grains, no colors that were offset (even at dark scenes where those problems usually occur)... it was pretty flawless to me. Sound quality is great too! Besides animated movies, it's the best SHOW OFF HD MOVIE to show off to friends....

i've also seen King Kong HD DVD, which was also a great HD Movie... but i think Pirates 1 tops it.

its a MUST OWN Blu-Ray!",1180224000,8,844,4.254777070063694

1488347,5,B00005JM5E,"Featuring a terrific looking transfer, the Blu-ray of ""Pirates"" looks darn near perfect. Colors are bold and accurate and this has one of the most film-like looks I've seen. All of the original extras have been ported over as well as a new one that is interactive where you can access bits of pirate lore and history as you watch the film.

You've probably already seen the film in its previous DVD incarnation so hopefully you know the plot already. The format itself wouldn't matter if this was a bad transfer (witness some of the SACD or DVD-A releases that actually didn't sound as good as the original vinyl albums or CDs and you'll have an idea as to how badly this could have turned out)luckily Disney has taken great pains to try and capture the depth, texture and warmth of the original film itself. While it isn't as big a difference as comparing a DVD to a VHS, it is a marked step up from the previous DVD release. While the DVD looked extremely good, the accuracy at capturing the detail here leaves the original DVD in the dust.

Disney has taken a huge step forward with this Blu-ray and the companion sequel to ""Pirates"" also released at the same time. You may want to make sure that your firmware is up to date, though, as I've heard reports of folks having some issues with some of their players if they haven't updated it recently. If you're just now taking the plunge into Blu-ray I would make this disc one of the first that you purchase as it allows the format to show its potential.",1180051200,21,1505,4.449275362318841

Thank you Amazon for a super fast delivery.  Thank you Disney for DOING IT RIGHT!  Maybe other studios can learn from you!  Thank you BD Consortium for an EPIC format!

1488453,5,B00005JM5E,"I just watched "" The Curse of the Black Pearl"" in anticipation of the 3rd movie opening on Friday... Or tomorrow night for those of you lucky ones!  This is probably about my 7th or 8th time watching the movie, and with all great movies, there are always new things that you pick up in the movie.  There were a couple of references to Will (Orlando) Turner's father I picked up, and I finally noticed that Cpt. Barbosa did not die at the end of the movie.. Hence, his reappearance in the 2nd movie.. How the heck did I miss that before?  And it is always cool to watch the transformations of the pirates to skeletons and back again.  The scenes in reference to the ride at Disneyland are always enjoyed, as that is in my top 2 rides at Disneyland.

  Some of the extras on the 2-disc DVD are pretty cool.  I liked the Bloopers reel, and some of the deleted/extended scenes were interesting.  The ""Making Of"" was also interesting too.  One of these days i will listen to Bruckheimer's take on the movie.

  ""Dead Man's Chest"" is tomorrow night, and then I will be in line for the 3rd Friday !",1179878400,2,1091,4.315270935960591
1488454,5,B00005JM5E,"Whether you're new to Blu-ray DVDs or already have quite a collection, this one is a must-buy. Simply put, it has the best video and audio of any Blu-ray title released to date. With its mix of bright and dark scenes, its boatload of special effects and its rollicking layered soundtrack, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl"" is a perfect showcase for Blu-ray technology, and Disney has taken full advantage of it.

VIDEO

Though its contrast is sharp and bold, the near-perfect digital transfer reveals hitherto-unseen details and textures throughout its range. In nearly every scene there seems to be something new -- from the lace on young Elizabeth's dress, to the braids that hold the beads in the beard of Captain Jack, to the rotting, clinging skin on the pirates' moonlit skulls.

The colors, always good, are now simply great. Pure and vivid, they show off every brilliant yellow and orange in the film's Caribbean days; every spooky blue in its moonlight nights. Flesh tones couldn't be better.

The transfer has no grain, even in the darkest scenes, and there are no compression artifacts, so even the largest patch of color stays one solid hue. This, in turn, reveals even more minute detail. Have you ever noticed that the redhead's curls match the pattern on her dress? Or that the skeleton monkey has mangy fur? I hadn't, until now.

AUDIO

As you would guess, the uncompressed 5.1 soundtrack delivers amazing audio quality, with great imaging between its channels for a full 360-degree field of sound. But what's really cool is, again, all the detail. There's just so much sound here. You hear the wooden ships creak and moan as they sail. You hear individual instruments in the score. You can even make out every word -- well, most every word -- of Captain Jack's often slurred, sun-baked mumble.

BONUS FEATURES

The two-disc set contains all the low-res bonuses of the earlier standard release, as well as a nifty new one. Activate ""Scoundrels at Sea"" and, as you watch the movie, a prompt pops up every few minutes that lets you view a short clip about pirate history. You can skip it, watch it immediately, or build up a library of clips to view at the film's end.

To sum up, this is the best Blu-ray title out there. It's a great way to experience that big-bucks home theater system, and a treasure trove of entertainment fun.",1179705600,76,2365,4.748780487804878
1488455,4,B00005JM5E,"I think Johnny Depp is one of the most courageous performers working today. To go out on a limb (modeling the character after Keith Richards) without the complete blessing of the studio took guts. As with most Depp creations he leaves an unforgettable impression on the audience. When you team him up with a cast of talent that includes Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley and Geoffrey Rush well you can guess the rest. Bloom is developing into a convincing performer, Knightley, despite her beauty, is a surprisingly talented and unselfish actress and I think Geoffrey Rush is incapable of delivering a poor performance. And although her appearance was brief, whoever cast Thandie Newton as a pirate was a genius. The story was great and the special effects were even better.

Know for odd-ball roles, he is finally found one where he has hit star status, which has been long overdue.  Keira Knightley is wonderful to see in action and is going to be a big star quickly as she, for her youth, is quite an accomplished actress.  Orlando, whom was wonderful as the elf, Legolas, in the Lord of the Rings, whose carreer as an actor actually go its take off in that trilogy, likewise is great as the young love interest and heroe that is trying to save the Governor' (played with a properly tongue in cheek aplumb by Jonathan Price, who tickled my funny bone) daughter, Keira's character.  Orlando really learned a lot from LOR stint and is growing into being as great an actor as Leonardo Decaprio.  Look out Leo, you got competition coming up.  Jeffrey Rush as Barbosa was a wonderfully devious and sinister yet farcicle Captain of the Black Pearl.  The effects are superb and they really worked flawlessly with the movie.

I found the behind the scenes extras very informative and fun to watch, as much as the movie itself.

I enjoyed the whole package and can't wait for all the others to be added to my collection.  And to think that this was inspired by a Disneyland ride/ attraction.",1178409600,,1382,4.622950819672131
1488458,4,B00005JM5E,"Today movies find inspiration from video games, comic books, old television shows - everywhere! Still, it's surprising that a movie was made based on an amusement park ride. I don't know if I'm being silly, but that fact just astonishes me. This will end up, with the release of the third movie, as one of the most successful series of all time, and it's based on a ride!

This was a very fun movie to watch, and whenever Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) was on the screen, it was even more so. Keira Knightly is terrific, Orlando Bloom is, well, Orlando Bloom - he was easy on the eyes, and his acting was fine, if not good. Geoffrey Rush as Depp's foil was perfect.

The plot was simple and straightforward: there's a curse on some gold that the crew of The Black Pearl stole, and they need to return it to lift the curse. Not much to go on, one would think, but somehow Disney did a terrific job and churned out an entertaining two and a half hour film that didn't feel like one.

1488576,5,B00005JM5E,"There are two things I love: pirates and Johnny Depp.  Putting those two together is a dream come true.  And to have Depp play a pirate is even better.  I loved Pirates of the Caribbean.  This entertaining action-adventure film is a roller coaster ride of action-packed scenes and a feast for the eyes as well.  Set in eighteenth century, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl tells the story of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and the governor's daughter Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and their adventures after they encounter the rather bizarre and enigmatic Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp).  Jack wants to find the ship Black Pearl and his nemesis, Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and settle an old score.  But Barbossa has his own plans -- he wants to reverse an old spell that has left him and the other borders of the Black Pearl living as immortals that keeps them from enjoying the simple pleasures of life (like eating, drinking, etc.).  This puts Elizabeth in danger and Will Turner will be there to rescue her, but in doing so he discovers a few things about himself.

I had my doubts about this film at first because... well, it's a movie inspired by a theme park ride, for crying out loud.  But since I love Johnny Depp and all things that are remotely set in a different time frame, I decided to give it a whirl.  This film is such a fun treat!  Both children and adults could enjoy it and the special effects are wonderful.  I love the cast, especially Depp and Bloom.  Johnny Depp is gorgeous (even in over the top pirate regalia) and so talented.  He's a chameleonic actor who once again showcases his abilities to portray a character flawlessly.  Orlando Bloom is another gorgeous specimen and I enjoyed him a whole lot.  The weakest link to me is Keira Knightley, but fortunately the story doesn't completely revolve around her character.  The supporting cast, namely Jack Davenport, is also great.  I loved this action/adventure flick and I look forward to watching the sequel.",1171497600,2,2012,4.746397694524496

1488711,5,B00005JM5E,"I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Pirates of the Caribbean is one of the best action-adventure movies of all time. Director Gore Verbinski has found a winning formula with this combination of great acting, stellar special effects, and outstanding original music to tie up the package.

The story begins when Captain Jack Sparrow, played fabulously by Johnny Depp, sails into Port Royal, Jamaica, a British stronghold in the Caribbean. Soon, however, Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) sails into port with his notorious crew of pirates on board the Black Pearl. The crew attacks the town and kidnaps Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), who has a medallion of very special value to the Black Pearl's crew. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), decides to set off after the Pearl with the help of Sparrow. Soon however, the characters discover that Barbossa and his crew aren't what they appear...

All plot summary aside, the real question is: why should you see this movie?

First off, the film is worth seeing if only for Depp's performance as Sparrow. Instead of the common idea of pirates as sinister, Sparrow is a slightly insane, yet hilarious pirate who always comes through with classic one-liners. Depp's portrayal of Sparrow is what makes the film an action-comedy, and lightens up the normally dark nature of pirates. From his wardrobe to his off-kilter movements, Sparrow is an unforgettable character who has to be seen.

Also, the action sequences are outstanding. From frantic sword fights to tense naval battles, the special effects and interesting twists on classic formulas make the action sequences awesome. The special effects in Pirates are very well done and believable. They are most notable in portraying what happens to the crew of The Black Pearl in the moonlight (without giving too much away). The well-written plot realizes that an action movie  hinges upon its action sequences, and moves hastily through locations to keep the viewer from getting bored.

So, I highly recommend seeing this movie. It puts a piraty twist on the classic adventure movie formula and is very watchable. Between great acting and great action sequences, what else could you want from an action movie?",1169596800,,2203,5.071823204419889

1488920,5,B00005JM5E,"One of those movies I've been chomping at the bit to review since it's release, `Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' is what a top notch Hollywood blockbuster looks like; both visually stunning and completely entertaining, with a plot and characters we can care about coupled with special effects to put Spielberg to shame and humor that'll keep the entire family rolling with laughter.  `Pirates' may in fact be that all around perfect film, one that everyone can enjoy with absolutely no reservations.  It's about time Hollywood gave us something this complete.

As Captain Jack Sparrow, Johnny Depp worked hard for that Oscar nod without every really working at all.  His performance I guaranty you was not one he was campaigning for an Oscar, it's far too natural for that, and that's why I feel so overjoyed about his nomination.  It's not a performance that the Academy all too often notices for it has nothing they look for yet it proved to be everything they needed to award.  Becoming completely absorbed in his character he's almost unrecognizable here, and that what sets Depp apart from most of the pack in the first place, dire dedication and devotion to a role.

The plot here revolves around a group of undead pirates trying to break the curse that binds them in their `undead' state.  The leader of this group is Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who now commands The Black Pearl, a ship once belonging to Jack Sparrow.  In an attempt to reverse this curse they kidnap the beautiful Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly) and this leaves her father, Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce), up in arms.  Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the blacksmith who secretly pines for Elizabeth's attention, is determined to find her and so he enlists the help of Sparrow (who's determined solely to regain command of his ship) in order to track down the undead and rescue his love.

As I said, this film has everything you could wish for in a motion picture.  It has the action and adventure, plenty of eye candy (I personally prefer the gorgeous Keira Knightly but my wife is a major fan of Depp here), one liners and general hilarious scenes and did I mention those brilliantly slick special effects.  All the performances are great, Depp the standout as well as Rush who is splendidly iconic, but it was probably the biggest booster for young talent Keira Knightly who I'm sure was instantly noticed, not just for her beauty but also her dynamic chemistry with the screen.  A must see adventure for any fan of pirates, swashbuckling or just plain fun!",1166140800,4,2573,4.818181818181818
1488921,4,B00005JM5E,"You've got to hand it to Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio. They are a winning team of writers with a pretty good resume of flicks that they've combined on. Amongst others, they did the first two Pirates movies and are together again for 2007's upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End.

And all of the key characters from Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) are back in Dead Man's Chest played by the same actors...with the same director (Gore Verbinski). That's usually the most important ingredient to a successful sequel. The main addition to Dead Man's Chest is Davy Jones played superbly by Bill Nighy (Nighy plays a great monster; I loved him as the vampire Viktor in the Underworld movie series).

And all of the key players will be back for a quick return in 2007 with World's End. Can't wait.

The effects in Curse of the Black Pearl and Dead Man's Chest are great. The movies are visually spectacular from CGI ghosts & sea monsters to at sea adventure to make up effects.

There's lots of silliness in the Pirates movies, but it's deliberate. There's slapstick. There are death-defying feats. There's Johhny Depp (Captain Jack Sparrow) doing his best imitation of Keith Richards (true factoid, he has publicly commented that Richards is his Jack Sparrow character inspiration). But it all mostly works. After all, this is indeed supposed to be a movie for kids too, no?

It's must be tough to make a PG movie these days; it's hard to believe that this Disney theme park ride turned billion dollar movie franchise is getting PG-13 treatment. Kids 13 and under can see more violence and hear more profanity at school recess and at the local playground than they do in Pirates. How is it that National Treasure (2004) gets PG and Pirates doesn't? Ludicrous. But I won't get started on how neurotically insane the pressure is from certain groups on the MPAA to ""protect"" our youth.

I will indeed finish by saying that the first two of the Pirates series have grossed over $1,000,000,000 (that's a BILLION dollars) because they're good movies that kids can watch too. They're certainly not the best two movies in the world; in fact, Dead Man's Chest is probably more between a 3 and 4 star rating than the solid 4 star that Curse of the Black Pearl would earn alone. But numbers don't lie. People are drawn to this franchise. I am drawn to this franchise.

As Davy Jones says, ""One soul is not equal to another."" So describes my view of the MPAA rating system to the next guy's, and so analogizes my opinion of Curse of the Black Pearl versus Dead Man's Chest. Bottom line: both movies offer a total of more than 4 hours of time that can be spent nuzzling up with your kids. Hence, my recommendation: add the Pirates series to your cart.",1165795200,4,2742,4.618069815195072

As far as I'm concerned she loves them both.

As far as the presentation of the DVD, it's clean and the packaging isn't annoying. The menus don't take a long to cycle so you can just watch your movie and relax.

Anchored by a strong, fun plot, dazzling special effects and an instant classic performance by Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, ""Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl"" is a fantastic movie and the msot fun one can have while watching one.

When Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley), the governor's daughter, is kidnapped by the evil (and undead) Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), her friend since childhood, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), sets out to rescue her. In desparation, he joins forces with the wily Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who has his own vendetta gainst Barbossa: Barbossa has taken over his ship, The Black Pearl.

What ensues is nonstop action meshed in with great bits of humor and dazzling special effects. The undead zombie pirates are a great spectacle, and the set pieces and performances (even Bloom performs well in this one) are dazzling.

This two disc special edition comes with a treasure trove of amazng extras. This is a film that belongs in any and all dvd collections. It is one truly worth having.",1161993600,2,1148,4.96875
1489050,4,B00005JM5E,"Starting in the late 1990's, Disney's theatrical releases gradually lost the popularity and stature they once held.  Outside of Pixar, Disney could not come up with the big blockbusters that they used to produce on an annual basis.  Then came 2003 and the Pirates of the Caribbean.  Coming out around the 4th of July weekend, this movie combines all the essential elements needed for a great movie: good acting, a setting few can ever experience, grand action scenes, unique dialog, hair raising adventure, engaging music and an original story-line.  This movie has it all.

First the acting.  Johnny Depp filled this role like no other actor could.  It could probably be said that only he could have played Jack Sparrow, just like only Robin Williams could have played Popeye, or Eddie Murphy played the Nutty Professor.  Rumor has it that Depp modeled the role after Keith Richards of the Rolling Stone.  True or not, Depp also revealed in an interview that some inspiration came from a little-known book ""Sodomy and the Pirate Tradition"".  The cursed pirates of the black pearl provide an entire crew of villains that range from fierce to ridiculous, led by the charismatic and word-wise Barbosa.  And of course we have the romance between Will and Elizabeth.

Second is the setting.  Pirate movies are set in America's equivalent of a back yard pool; the Caribbean Sea.  The sets and settings of this movie show of the beauty of the tropical seas and tropical islands.  Whether it be the shipwrecks patrolled by hammerhead sharks of the Isla de Muerta, or the coasts of Port Royal, the vistas in this movie are wonderful.

Third is the action scenes.  We have swordfights, chase scenes and great cannon duels.  Of course these have all been done before; i.e. Cutthroat Island.  But computer graphics sure help.  Then there is the storyline.  Loosely based of the Disney ride; the story isn't the regular story of X marks the treasure.  No, the pirates know where the treasure is; returning it all is the goal, along with the blood of an important person.  This makes a combination of pirate lore with great imagination.  Last is the music.  Composed by the same individuals that worked on the music of ""Gladiator"", one can discern similarities between the two soundtracks.  But this is definitely better, and one of the better ones by Disney.  Exciting and rousing, the soundtrack for this movie was probably the 2nd best of 2003 after Return of the King.

All in all, a great movie that deserves 5 out of 5 stars.  But the DVD was not as good as it could be.  Specifically, the extra and deleted scenes on the second disc are fully fleshed out; yet they are not included in the movie itself.  For this I give this product 4 out of 5 stars.",1161388800,4,2744,4.73784355179704
1489051,4,B00005JM5E,"Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) arrives at Port Royal things begin to happen.  The story concerns Captain Sparrow, the Governor, his daughter, the daughter's intended (a Commodore), and the local blacksmith who owes his life and heart to the Governor's daughter.  Jack manages to save the life of the Governor's daughter, but that is not enough to save him from jail.  Then she is kidnaped by a band of pirates sailing the Black Pearl.  This prompts the blacksmith to team up with Sparrow to go and rescue her.  This they set out to do after embarrassing the Navy.

Captain Sparrow used to be captain of the Black Pearl until a mutiny removed him.  The crew, under a new captain, managed to become cursed and are now seeking a way to end the curse.  Apparently they need the Governor's daughter in order  to succeed.  The plot goes through some interesting convolutions as each of the interested parties tries to get what they want.  How each of these plot threads gets resolved will have to wait until you watch the film.

The characters are interesting and the plot well-conceived.  Ad some real swashbuckling to modern special effects and you get a pirate tale no studio could have pulled off too long ago.  I was particularly surprised at the integrity of some of the so-called bad guys in the film (there are bad guys and villains).  The ending also worked well without pulling out some cute solution.  This is supposed to be the first in a trilogy but I doubt the other films can equal this one in its better respects (although they will probably outdo the special effects).  A fun film with good acting, solid plotting, and great action.  Check it out.",1161043200,3,1662,4.672413793103448
1489052,5,B00005JM5E,"Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is a rogue pirate. He was exiled from his crew and left on an island. Jack managed to escape the island and is now looking for revenge and wants his ship back. Jack's former crew invade the town of Port Royal looking for a medallion that could rid them of their curse. They kidnap Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and her childhood friend, Will (Orlando Bloom), sets out to rescue her with the help of Jack Sparrow.

Pirates of the Caribbean is the big-budget adaptation of a theme park ride, starring actors you wouldn't think of being in a blockbuster. But, despite all that Pirates of the Caribbean is a marvellous success. It stole the spotlight off the Matrix Reloaded to become the Summer's (2003) 2nd biggest movie after Finding Nemo.

But how did it do it? Well, it was largely helped by the fantastic cast. Orlando Bloom pulled in the girls, Keira Knightley the boys, and Geoffrey Rush appeared to be hugely enjoying his role as a gold-hungry pirate. But it was mainly down to Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow, a Keith Richards style, rum-drinking, roguish yet charming pirate with a mind for gold. The role is superbly over-acted, and was the most memorable character of 2003, (Johnny Depp was robbed of an Oscar!).

Also, Pirates of the Caribbean was fun. It was a truly exciting, thrilling film with plenty twists and turns. The action was very well choreographed. Pirates features some very good action sequences especially, Jack and Will's first encounter, several boat fights and the finale.

Pirates of the Caribbean is very much a comedy. Jack Sparrow provides a lot of belly laughs especially in the rum scene with Elizabeth Swann. Elizabeth Swann turns to Jack in disgust when she finds that when he was marooned on an island the previous time, all he did was drink rum for 3 days.

""You sat on a beach for three days drinking rum?!"" - Elizabeth Swann. Jack Sparrow pauses then says; ""Welcome to the Caribbean, love!"" and then totters off. A classic scene.

Also making laughs are The Office's Mackenzie Crook as a wooden-eyed pirate Ragetti and two bumbling navy officers.

There are many small references to the ride that inspired the movie. In Johnny Depp's jail scene, a dog carrying the keys can be seen. In the drunken town of Tortuga, there are drunkards sitting on a swinging barrel. On a boat scene the parrot can be heard croaking `dead man tell no tales' a line relating to the ride. Rating out of 10 : 10, In a year, when comic book films and sequels dominated, Pirates of the Caribbean was a breath of fresh air. Johnny Depp steals the show and two sequels are now in production (Dead Man's Chest, already released, and At World's End, to be released in 2007).",1160956800,3,2714,4.689075630252101
1489053,4,B00005JM5E,"An entertaining, funny, special effects packed swashbuckler. Lots of sword-fighting. What I saw really motivates me to get the dvd. I saw this on USA & they seem compelled to show advertisements every 12-15 minutes, mostly promoting their own shows, over & over & over. This is a rather long movie at 143 minutes. You cannot fit that into a three hour time slot with all those STUPID ADS. Anyway, I never paid much attention to Johnny Depp before. He is delightful as Capt. Jack Sparrow flitting from scene to scene. There's a slight love story. He doesn't get the girl, but really doesn't care. His ship, the Black Pearl is haunted & he wants it back. Elizabeth is Keira Knight the eye candy & only female in the cast. She of course gets kidnapped. She is quite a good comedic actress. Very promising. I can't wait to see the other half of this movie with the sequel coming in dvd very soon I'd imagine.

1489055,4,B00005JM5E,"Frankly, and I'm sure I'll get slammed for this, but I didn't care much for Captain Jack Sparrow. Now my kids loved him, I on the other hand felt he came across as rather less of a hero. Maybe had he been a stronger presence I would have liked him better.

For the movie itself, it's pure entertainment. The undead crew of the Black Pearl, the quest to rid themselves of the curse, not to mention the side quest of Orlando Bloom who is trying to rescue the woman he loves. Excellent action and depiction of the pirate life.

If you are really interested in Pirates, you might try 'Under the Black Flag'. It's a book that details the history of pirates(I reveiwed it in an earlier review). It's chock full of their ways and codes.

I gave it four stars because I liked the movie, just not Jack Sparrow. I hear Disney even added him to the Pirates of the Carribean ride. Have to go back there some day to see for myself.",1158969600,2,918,4.264367816091954
1489056,3,B00005JM5E,"I cannot help but think that this film could have been much better in more capable hands. As others have noted, it runs way too long. Roger Ebert rather astutely observed that somewhere in this 143 minute movie could be a decent 90 minute movie; perhaps he is correct, though we might never know. Gore Verbinski should re-edit this movie for a director's cut and leave out about forty-five minutes; perhaps that would help resolve at least some of its shortcomings. The acting is nothing special, which is to be expected given the way the film plays like a combination of a slapstick comedy and a children's movie. Johnny Depp is a very good, serious actor, as evidenced in ""Blow,"" ""Ed Wood,"" ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" ""Finding Neverland,"" etc., though I didn't really like his performance in this film. He does much as much can be expected to develop his character, though I cannot help but wonder if he (along with the rest of the cast) considered this from the onset as simply a paycheck because it appears many of the actors didn't take it seriously and merely phoned in their performances. It doesn't help that they didn't have much with which to work, either. I'm not certain why the principle leads would sign on for two more entries to this series, though money would again be the prime suspect. Action-adventure movies can be fun and entertaining without being shallow and resorting to clichd tactics as this movie does; the recent Harry Potter and Spider-man movies are good examples of movies that successfully combine entertainment and action with competent, intelligent scripting. Furthermore, it seems to me the makers of this movie could not decide what the target audience for this movie would be, and the result is that it appears to be intended for children, yet is entirely too long to retain their attention and contains entirely too much violence and too many gruesome effects for children. This seems to be a problematic trademark for Verbinski, whose ""Mousehunt"" (1997) seemed to be clearly intended for children, yet contained some decidedly adult humor. I cannot really recommend a movie that has me wishing it would end halfway through it, which this one did. That is not to say it is bad or that it is dull because it is undoubtedly ambitious and there are moments throughout the film, until the last frames, which show undeniable sparks of energy. Some of the scenes work well and the action is more than adequate. Also, we don't see very many pirate movies any more, so it does have that going for it, you know, which is nice. Ultimately, however, the film meanders about, loses focus and is simply not good enough to warrant a viewing. With two more movies on the way, perhaps there was enough material among this trilogy that would have warranted making 1.5 or even 2 movies from the first the one. I received the DVD as a present, watched it once and must say I am not in a hurry to sit through it again.

There are really no other movies out there that have a character like Jack Sparrow, or are about just good, clean fun.  Star Wars was a bit like that and a lot of the older movies that have been made were too.

Okay Acting:  Fabulous, grand, great, cool.  I mean Johnny Depp is amazing, Geoffry Rush is perfect as Barbossa, Keira Knightley is great, and Orlando is passable, BUT its really about Depp's performance.

The Directing is good, ya know you don't really need to direct someone like Depp, but the effects are great and the story never lags or anything.  That was one thing that was stupid.  Some critcs complained this was too long.  What?  I would have been content to sit there for three and a half hours watching it.

Overall this is a fabulous film, but you might ask:  ""How can this, based on a Disney ride be good?""

The answer is, ""When is the last time you had a great time watching a movie?  Not a comedy.  Just a great time at the movies...for the older people(I'm not one of them, missed all the classics right)it would probably be Indiana Jones or Star Wars and thats my point....they don't make movies like this anymore, see it.

This review is for the UMD version, and the DVD version.  I did not review the Special Features disc, only the main movie disc.

I first enjoyed  this movie on my portable PSP system, as I commuted between my home and workplace.  I only watched this movie 1 or 2 chapters at a time, over a week or so.  And you know what.  I still LOVED IT!  It was truly amazing!

I'm a huge Johnny Depp fan, back to his original television series ""21 Jump Street,"" and the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street.""  He truly is one of the most diverse and talented actors in my lifetime.  I enjoy all that he is in, including this wonderful Disney fantasy film.

Special effects are excellent!  I enjoy the visual effects, etc.  When the pirates make their transition, for example.  Johnny is awesome as the main character.  I loved Orlando Bloom and all the supporting characters as well.

Very good show!  Rent or Buy!  Either way, you'll love it!!!

Enter Captain Jack Sparrow, a lost pirate, onto a small island in the Carribean, looking to commondere a ship.  In turn, he crosses paths with his old crew of the black pearl, where mutany is abound.  There is also a curse upon the pearl that, as the movie unfolds, one figures out how to cure...but of course there are a few twists that make a simple solution fun to watch.

I had heard from all my friends that this was one of the best movies they have ever seen... I wanted so bad to see it!  I finally bought it after all the talk was going around that the second one was coming out.  I felt like I had to watch it and not fall behind on the series.

It was a super-slow movie throughout the entire 2 hours.  The plot was pointless. The ladies dresses were revealing.  The pirates used the word ""bloody"" a lot.  Certain things that were wrong crept in as truths.  I come from a christian family and we all sat down and watched it and all had the same response.

Other than good and well-known actors and actresses this movie was utterly disapointing.

I'm not one that is very picky on the movies I like. I love movies like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, National Treasure. But I just couldn't understand why everyone was apprasing it with 5 stars!

This in not one, by far, that I would watch again.",1154304000,5,969,4.240437158469946
1489329,5,B00005JM5E,"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl finally breaks the curse of the bad pirate movie.  Most are unforgettable and justly so.  Pirates of Penzance?  Hook?  Ice Pirates?  Are there any fans of these films? I guess so.  But nobody is waiting in line for a sequel anytime soon.  So for Disney, to have a definite franchise made with this first outing, is something pretty special and a tribute to everyone involved in the film.

What makes it work?  It's the characters and story.  The action, while being spectacular is secondary and supports the intriguing story and loveable characters.  Depp's Jack Sparrow is an instant, quirky classic and Geoffrey Rush's obsessed and bitter foe is almost as fun.  Heck, even the monkey is better than most characters from lesser Pirate movies!  What might be most compelling is that these are not gleeful, happy go lucky pirates that we always see in movies. They are broken men in every sense and their appetite for treasure and booty is what has cursed them into the pitiful eternally sailing zombies they've become.

There's the notion that once a film offers up characters to love, the audience will follow those characters anywhere, because they care about them.  With Pirates of the Caribbean, we'll gladly follow them anywhere, under any sail and travelling in calm or rough waters alike.

1489331,4,B00005JM5E,"""Pirates of the Carribean"" is very simply, one of the finest action films to reach the cinema this decade. Gore Verbinski (Director of the film) leads a great pack of actors which includes the underrated Johnny Depp playing the infamous pirate Jack Sparrow, Orlando Bloom as Will Turner the young Craftsman turned hero, the blosseming Keira Knightley as the governor's daughter & a very good performance by Geoffrey Rush as Capitan Barbosa doesnt hurt the cast much either...

This film is not stop fun, the action is very apperent throughout and the same can be said about the comedy. I was 100% involved for the entire 143 minutes that it was playing. Johnny Depp's performance is astounding and should have been more seriously considered for the best actor award at the Oscars ... but I really don't think that it is Jack's Charactor is not the only thing that made the film so good. The collection of all of the witty comedy, non-stop suspense & action as well as some stunning special effects is what made the film so great. The film had great direction, a clever script and about as good of a cast as it could have hoped for ...

Gore Verbinski is one director that I think deserves a little bit more credit. He made a very funny film in ""Mouse Hunt"", a very creepy movie in ""The Ring"" and an all around good job in the film at hand ...

""Pirates of the Carribean"" will go down in history as being one of the great summer hits, the same can be said about Johnny Depp's wonderful performance playing Jack Sparrow..

The second film is good but not as good as this one, though it is still very much entertaning ... the next few should be a blast, I cant wait!",1153699200,4,1663,4.4605263157894735

First, you have people who are expecting deep, meaningful dialogue and acting. Let me say to them: It's a movie about Pirates, for Christ's sake. And, made by Disney, nonetheless. I wouldn't expect Casablanca from them, nor would I expect it from a movie about Pirates. Second, I have seen people comment on the ""historical"" facts of Pirates. It's fiction, don't take it seriously. Never does it even imply that the events were real, nor based on real events. And third are people who like to dissect the Pirates themselves, since they were, at least historically, raping, plundering, and pillaging scumbags. But, look, again I say: It came from Disney. If you were looking for non-stop bloodshed and rape, I don't know where you get the idea of Disney putting that out. The movie is oriented towards families, not history scholars or film buffs. If you didn't like it, too bad. However, I did enjoy it.",1152921600,11,1009,4.706214689265536

Why do they always have to come up with those boring politically correct movies? Doesn't anyone want to tell the people how things really went back then?

1489422,5,B00005JM5E,"Pirates of the Caribbean was the smash hit no one expected, making a blockbuster out of a long-forgotten genre, unlikely action leads, and a theme park ride as influence. Undead pirates have come to Port Royal to kidnap the governor's daughter (Keira Knightley) under the belief that she can free them from a curse placed by a chest of Aztec gold coins. A blacksmith (Orlando Bloom) enlists Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to rescue her. Depp's performance is now legendary, and the story is packed with good action set pieces that mix practical effects, stunts, and computer generated wonders. The film runs a little long, but is evenly paced so that it never becomes boring.

Disney did a great job with this 2-disc set, which has commentaries, deleted scenes, and numerous featurettes on both the movie production and the theme park ride its based on. Some editions come bundled with a 3rd ""lost disc,"" but the best bonus material is already here.

1489423,4,B00005JM5E,"I'll have to admit that I'm substance over style when it comes to movies.  In fact, I didn't even hesitate refusing this one in theaters for two reasons:

  1) It's a Disney flick, so there's always the threat of syrupy goodness through morals, bubbly yet not funny gags (which were prevalent in the previews that also made the movie seem a bit unoriginal), and characters who have a better chance of being remembered by infants, who have imaginations so vivid that poor CGI and a weak story is a stroke of genius(if you take into account Disney's other works that came out around this time, then you'd know that this reason is true, except Pixar, b-cuz those movies are Pixar productions through Disney distribution and therefore don't count).

  2)Actors starring in POTC provoked suspicion: Johnny Depp= chick magnet/acceptable by males b-cuz they most likely haven't watched that teen-soap he starred in, but has seen his other performances that has earned him a cool actor pass (the coolness right below Deniro, Pacino, Hopkins, etc...) Orlando Bloom= chick magnet/unacceptable by males because he really hasn't paid any dues as far as showing any real talent and is only in this movie because he's a chick magnet before being a 1/3rd decent actor.

  So I guess it's fair to say that my reasons are only from the outside looking in rather than looking into it and judging when I get outside.

  It wasn't until I stumbled upon it while my relentlessly renting father rented a bunch of new movies and I caught him watching it.  After watching it halfway through to the end, then watching from the beginning to the end, then watching it all over again, I realized I was almost a closed-minded fool.  I won't be rushing to the next Johnny Depp/Orlando Bloom colaboration or anything, but if they're recurring the roles for another POTC, then I'm definitely down for it! This movie was a good peice of work.  Screw the fact that this was ""historically inaccurate and that pirates raped, killed, and stood as a symbol of selfishness"" (which, in fact, isn't really historically accurate to all pirates, but that's another discussion)...this was a highly entertaining movie.  It's an adventure as big as Indiana Jones with lush environments, situational action sequences and gags that are inventive, and small intriguing plot twists that both make sense and save a character at the same time. If that's not enough, Geoffrey Rush (probably the only reason I would see the movie, but wasn't enough to make me risk a night of debauchery to watch it) is the antagonist who retains that brash arrogance yet animalistic flair that makes him cool to watch.  Orlando Bloom, while a chick magnet, is likeable in that he is treated like a newbie (synonymous with my statement of his acting experience) and is hazed, or punked, pretty regularly by Depp, who (here's the interesting part) uses a coherent variation of his character in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, which is infectious and captivating to the point where you forget about who plays the character and you instantly think he's a good antihero.  It's also at a good length.  I've always considered good movies at 120 minutes +, a decent expenditure. So yes, this movie is worth buying as long as you can accept that it's meant to be an excerise in entertaining everyone, then even the most hardcore of masculine movie-buffs will enjoy this as a guilty pleasure.  I gave it four stars because, like I said, it attempts and succeeds to entertain everybody. So there is love and hope and rare sappy one-liners that are sooo not the reason why I enjoyed it that I'm sure any self-respecting man would be hesitant to suggest it as a viable selection to those among his brethren who haven't seen it without proving that he's borderline gay.",1152489600,2,3785,4.810185185185185

First of all, there are countless factual inaccuracies in this movie that need to be addressed:

1) Pirates have a heart, deep down.  No they don't.  They are brutal killing machines like the bad robots in Robocop movies, and nothing will stop them (except maybe Robocop, because he is part robot and part police officer).

2) In pirate-y days people used to fall in love.  Untrue.  Love was discovered in the 1930s, between the two World Wars.  Pirates only know about hate and treasures.

That's it for the historical inaccuracies.  But also I strongly dislike pirates, so how could I possibly like this movie?

And the reasons are this: great actors/characters and a great storyline.  Sounds simple but too often we see actors that are miscast in movies.  Not in this case.  Johnny Depp IS Jack Sparrow, and after this great performance (he's like Keith Richards, ha!), you would not want to see it any other way.  He has the walk and talk down on a great character and his ensemble shines as well.  Orlando Bloom proves that he is more than just a LOTR elf and this was the first movie I saw with the gorgeous Kiera Knightley (not counting her playing the body double of Natalie Portman in Star Wars Episode One).  Both Orlando and Kiera are excellent and help Johnny Depp carry the movie.  My only complaint is the movie seemed VERY, VERY long, but it was very enjoyable.  A lot of good special effects although various crew members can be seen throughout!  Although Disney execs were scared at how well Depp's performance would go over, I would say they are now laughing all the way to the bank!  Risk equals reward!",1152489600,2,1126,4.552238805970149

Johnny Depp just may have his signature role in Captain Jack Sparrow. Not that he hasn't had many other memorable roles, but he plays the rangy captain with such irony and wit, making him one of the more gracious pirates of the silver screen.  Geoffrey Rush, as Capt. Barbossa, wasn't half bad either, as he led a motley crew of zombie Pirates in a quest to regain their lost humanity.  Sort of anyway.  The romance between Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley was carried to absurdist lengths, but nicely resolved in the end.  Jonathon Pryce is priceless as Keira's doting dad, willing to go to any lengths to please his darling daughter.  But of course Bloom has to fend off a challenge from another suitor of higher station.  The whole thing is just a barrel of fun, never losing its mad cap momentum, even when the scenes seemed totally preposterous.  A bit scary for the little ones perhaps, but not without a little parental guidance.",1152403200,2,1100,4.4874371859296485
1489427,5,B00005JM5E,"It's difficult to imagine that a movie inspired by an amusement park ride could be as good as this is, but it is. Much of the excellence of this film is due to some inspired performances turned in by some very gifted actors.

The eccentric Johnny Depp is the sheet anchor of PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN as Captain Jack Sparrow, the roguish, charming, unkempt former Master of the ship ""Black Pearl."" Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth Swann, the daughter of the Royal Governor of Jamaica, and teen heartthrob Orlando Bloom plays her love interest, blacksmith-turned-pirate Will Turner. Geoffrey Rush plays mutineer-turned-pirate Captain Barbosa, who is dedicated to recovering the last of a hoard of Aztec treasure that carries a curse upon it.

Unfortunately for Elizabeth Swann besides her corset, she is unknowingly wearing the last of the cursed coins as a medallion, making her the target of Barbosa and crew's depredations. Luckily, Captain Jack Sparrow has a score to settle with Barbosa, who'd left him castaway on a deserted island after stealing the ""Black Pearl"". Together with Bloom, he fights to protect Elizabeth and recover his ship. The Aztec treasure at the heart of it all is cursed; the holders of the treasure are damned to eternal unlife: Captain Barbosa and crew are naught more than living skeletons.

The very young (17) Knightley is full of spunk, and Bloom's Turner is evolving from a rather stickish boy into a swashbuckling man. But it is Depp who drives this picture with his portrayal of Captain Sparrow, ""a mix of Keith Richards and Pepe LePew."" Depp's love-starved stoner pirate staggers, rolls, swaggers and dances through every scene, giving the viewer a perfectly realized characterization, probably the one that will be the most memorable of his career.

PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN is helped immeasurably by a classical and archetypal storyline, the fact that is is the first of its genre in many years, it's whimsical sampling of old Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn movies (one scene is lifted straight out of THE CRIMSON PIRATE with Burt Lancaster), and not least of all by truly incredible sets and special effects. No expense has been spared and no detail overlooked. With it's mix of high adventure, comedy, and good old fashioned romance, this movie can't miss. Whether it's two sequels can measure up still remains to be seen as of this writing.

The dual-disc Special Edition DVD does suffer from overinclusiveness. In trying to fill the second DVD, Buena Vista Pictures has graced us with some surprisingly boring commentaries by Director Gore Verbinski and Johnny Depp, (it sounds as if they are falling asleep), and a host of other features of uneven quality. Far better are the usual ""Making Of"" documentaries and the commentary by Keira Knightley and Jack Davenport (who plays the Commodore, hopelessly in love with Knightley's character). Knightley and Davenport deliver their commentary with genetically English barbed wit.

The open-ended one sentence summary: Some cursed pirates kidnap Miss Swann, and her would-be lover teams up with a cool pirate to rescue her. Following so far?

Content Inappropriate for All Ages: Some pirate-like bad language, creepy zombie-things, blood, a few indirect references to prostitutes, (hey, they're PIRATES!), lots of drinking, violence of many kinds, and explosions.

Characters: 4 of 5 stars. Very likeable characters. As I'm sure everybody knows, Johnny Depp is a standout. Everbody else conveys their characters well (One of the better Keira Knightley movies). I have heard it said that the movie lacks romantic spark, and I agree that it could use a little more heat, but all in all, it's good. (They just kind of stumble around each other)

Plot: 3 of 5 stars. It's just a little too thick in here sometimes, but you can tell that they tried really hard. It's just pretty involved and kind of hectic. If you think too hard, you might frustrate yourself. Weaving in and out of this ""oh boy"" plot are brillant lines and classic scenes. (Jack Sparrow is a riot!)

Cinematography: 4 of 5 stars. First of all, the staging is very good, and the choregraphy is very nice also. Second, MOST of the special effects are believeable, except there's one or two little parts that wreck it for me every time. Locations and sets: superb.

Music: 5 of 5 stars. Hans Zimmer does the usual great job and provides a swashbuckling score with a memorable and popular theme. The ""scary music"" really heightens the scary parts.

Impact: 3 of 5 stars. After all that praise, why the low rating? Though the movie is quotable and charismatic, nice to look at and funny, I sincerely believe that it is 20 minutes overlong. I ALWAYS lose interest in the last half hour, I'm just pushed to the limits of my attention. If not for that critical flaw, I'd like this movie alot more.

1489512,4,B00005JM5E,"""Pirates of the Caribbean-The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is a relentless action adventure that is thoroughly entertaining.  The audience is seldom left to catch its breath scene for scene that cleverly reinvents swashbuckling.  The dueling scenes are inventive and the cinematography and choreographing of battles are superb.  Captain Jack (Johnny Depp) creates entertainment par excellence as the funny pirate, and Elizabeth (Keira Knightly) is captivating.  We have constant changing hands from the British to the pirates from prisoners to capturing, to blackmail, etc.

The main premise is that the pirates are under a curse where they can duel and be hurt but never die.  They are interested in British booty, something the military will deny.  In the course of events is Elizabeth's interest in Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the local blacksmith, even while she is being wooed by the aristocratic Commodore.

Non-stop adventure with new twists and turns with every camera angle make ""pirates'... fine entertainment.  Even if it gets tiresome at times when the pirates, unfairly, never die.",1152230400,,1092,5.376470588235295

1489516,5,B00005JM5E,"I seriously wasn't expecting to like this movie as much as I did. A pirate movie??? There's a lot of potential for lameness there. Like a lot of people, I decided that I wanted to see it because of Orlando Bloom (who definitely didn't disappoint!), but when the credits rolled I found myself with a new appreciation for Johnny Depp. I've liked a lot of his movies (Edward Scissorhands and What's Eating Gilbert Grape to name a few), but I've never really thought of him as one of my favorite actors. After seeing his witty, inventive portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow, how could I not include him on my list of favorites? From the moment he sails onscreen in his leaky, sinking boat (an image hilariously juxtaposed with dramatic, majestic music), Johnny Depp owns this movie. Savvy???

Anyway, enough about Johnny. I mean, I really can't say enough about the entire cast. Orlando Bloom (looking as handsome as ever!) plays Will Turner, a blacksmith who is somewhat reluctant to accept his pirate heritage. As the movie progresses, he does learn to accept it, which ultimately allows him to become the film's hero. Will lusts after the Governor's sophisticated yet spunky daughter, Elizabeth Swann (played by the gorgeous Keira Knightley). When Elizabeth is kidnapped by the cursed pirate crew (led by Geoffrey Rush as Capt. Barbossa) of the Black Pearl, Will has no choice but to team up with Jack Sparrow in order to find the Black Pearl and rescue Elizabeth. As you can imagine, much witty banter and swashbuckling action ensues. Yay! :)

I got this DVD for Christmas, and I'm so glad I did! There are all kinds of cool extras, like video footage from the making of the movie, pirate facts and trivia, a blooper reel, deleted and alternate scenes, a few ""Easter eggs"", and insightful commentaries from both Keira Knightley and Johnny Depp. If your computer has a DVD-ROM drive, you can also pop in the discs to get access to more bonus material, including storyboards and the movie's script. Another kind of neat little feature is the ""Moonlight Becomes Ye"" effects studio, in which you can take a scanned photo of yourself and find out what you'd look like if you were a cursed pirate.

Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl is really a must-see film. If for no other reason, see it for Johnny Depp's amazing performance, which was without a doubt one of the best of 2003.",1151712000,2,2393,4.733812949640288

So, when I heard Disney was releasing a feature length film based on my favorite Disneyland attraction, I was very curious to see how they were going to pull this off. Boy, was I blown away by this movie! I love the references to the ride throughout the movie, it shows the filmmakers were fans of the attraction as well. They even had the world premier of the movie at Disneyland, which I thought was brilliant. But what makes this film so much more than just a tribute to the ride is the performance of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow-without a doubt, one of the most unique and fun characters to ever grace the big screen! The cursed crew of the Black Pearl is awesome too, the special effects work on this literal ""skeleton crew"" was incredible, and the character of Captain Barbossa is the perfect pirate nemesis too!

When I think of pirates, I think of my favorite attraction at Disneyland, and when I think of pirate movies, I think of this film! Outstanding!",1151193600,2,1181,4.442396313364055
1489519,3,B00005JM5E,"I wanted to like the Pirates of the Carribean. I settled down with a pizza and a Mountain Dew, anxiously awaiting 2+ hours of great entertainment. But I am sorry to say that after one hour I wanted the movie to be over.

Generally I am fairly easy going when it comes to liking a movie. If it entertains me, if it gives me a story, if the acting is at least average, then I am happy. While the acting in the Pirates of the Carribean was more than passable with Depp and Bloom adding much to the film, the story put me to sleep. I don't generally find stories to be so utterly predictable that they are dull, but for me this story moved like molasses in January. (it was slow and I knew exactly where it was headed)

Also, I found myself not really caring what happens to the characters and story. My brain kept wanting to daydream, and my remote control finger was itching to hit the stop button. I didn't, hoping the story would pick up. It didn't.

This is a movie many may like. For me, it just wasn't happening. Maybe it was the endless scenes with pirates transforming back and forth between humans and skeletons? For about an hour it seemed as if the only point of the film was to feature this special effect.

Anywho, I recommend seeing this movie, but be prepared to be underwhelmed. Then again, you may like it. Depp is priceless and Bloom is passable, but without then this is a horrid film. Rent before you buy.

1489625,5,B00005JM5E,"Ok, ok, I admit it.  I was a skeptic.  How in the world could they turn a ride from Disneyland into a good movie?  But, being the Disney fiend that I am, I went to see this movie when it came out, and I immediately fell in love.

Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is needing a new ship, so he sails into Port Royal.  Being a pirate, he fully intends to steal one.  He doesn't quite get away with it, however, and winds up in jail.

That night, more pirates attack Port Royal.  But, instead of trying to free Captain Jack, they kill, pillage, and kidnap the governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley).  Seems she has something they want.

This doesn't sit well with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom).  He and Elizabeth have been friends since they were kids and he secretly loves her.  Despite his hatred of pirates, he makes a deal with Captain Jack to hunt down the Black Pearl and free Elizabeth.

What Will and Elizabeth don't realize is there is a very real curse on the crew of the Black Pearl.  They believe Elizabeth is their only hope of lifting it, so they will stop at nothing to do just that.

This movie works on every level.  While the story starts a little slowly, once the port is attacked, things pick up and the pace never lags.  The climax is a tad too long, but that's being nit picky.  Along the way we get some great swordplay, a couple double crosses, a few twists, and plenty of action.

Johnny Depp as Captain Jack completely steals the show.  Not only is he given the best lines, but he delivers them so well.  Every scene he is in guarantees at least one laugh.

That's not to diminish the work the other actors do.  Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly are also fantastic and do get their own share of memorable lines.  Geoffrey Rush makes a great villain with his portrayal of Captain Barbossa.  The supporting cast is fine as well.

The movie doesn't forget its roots.  There are loads of references to the famous ride including the song ""A Pirates Life for Me,"" and the line ""Dead men tell no tales.""  My favorite was the prisoners trying to attract the attention of the dog holding the key.  (Jack's line ""That dog is never going to move"" absolutely slays me.)  While they are fun for those familiar with the ride to spot, familiarity with the ride isn't essential to understanding the movie.  These bits add to the fun, but the story doesn't hinge on them.

And I must mention the special effects.  There are lots of living skeletons in this film, and they look great.  A little dated looking already three years later, but again it's being nit picky.  This film could not have been made any earlier and had the same level of effectiveness.  The special effects blend seamlessly into the film.  And, most importantly, they support the story being told, not the other way around.

While based on a Disney ride, this film is a rather scary ghost story with lots of violence.  Take the PG-13 rating seriously and view it to make sure your kids will enjoy it before you let them see it.

Having said that, this is a wonderful film for teens and adults.  It's got adventure, humor, and romance all rolled into one.",1150675200,2,3144,4.464788732394366

Depp and Rush, in particular, are so over-the-top you just can't help but smile at their virtuoso performances. And director Gore Verbinski just lets them have their fun.

The feel of the movie is somewhere in the realm between ""The Princess Bride"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"", with plenty of comedy, action, magic, and creepy evil skeleton pirates. Just the right pacing, plus an incredible score, keeps the movie going. My only concern is that the children viewing this might be confused by the nature of the actual ""curse"", as it is not spelled out very clearly. Still, the kids will have plenty of fun with the thrills and action. Just watching Johnny Depp stumble around and gesticulating like someone in the throes of a mild acid trip is hilarious enough. I recommend this movie highly.",1150070400,3,1063,4.808743169398907
1489628,4,B00005JM5E,"I originally went to see this film most reluctantly. In fact, the only reason I went to see it at all was because my sister wanted to see it, and it was her birthday. So, how could I not? Well, am I ever glad I did! It was a most enjoyable experience. While the film is long, running nearly two and a half hours, it did not seem so, as it is a fun filled, action packed delight that is sure to entertain people of all ages.

The story revolves around pirates with Johnny Depp in the role of Captain Jack Sparrow. He is a pirate who has lost his ship, The Black Pearl, to his arch enemy, the wily Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who led a mutiny against Sparrow. Unfortunately for Captain Barbossa, he and the mutineering crew commandeered some valuable booty that carried with it a curse that turned the ship and all aboard into a ghost ship, damned for all eternity, unless the booty is returned in its entirety to its rightful place. Therein, lies the tale.

Captain Sparrow, desperate to recover his ship, ends up on an island where his antics bring him in contact with the Governor's beautiful daughter, Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley), and the local blacksmith, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who is in love with the delectable Ms. Swan. Before you know it, they all end up together in a rollicking adventure on the high seas.

Geoffrey Rush and Keira Knightley turn in smart, top of the line performances, as does Jonathan Pryce, as the island Governor. Orlando Bloom also gives an excellent performance, though I found him decidedly unattractive in this film, thin lipped and sallow. It is Johnny Depp, however, who steals the show, a drolly funny and totally delightful scamp. Notwithstanding the fact that he has the best lines, Depp infuses the film with an infectiousness that is hard to resist. He literally makes the film.

The special effects are spectacular and the film provides fun for the whole family, though given the special effects, it is probably wise to leave those who are five and under at home. Everyone else is sure to enjoy this fun filled, fast paced film. It has something for everyone with just enough action, romance, and humor to keep viewers entertained.",1149292800,,2190,4.66580310880829

  I went on the ride as a child and loved it not knowing there would be an amazing movie after it. Pirates of the Caribbean is huge! with 2 sequals coming out there will be more sales than ever.

1489630,5,B00005JM5E,"Yo ho, yo ho! A pirate's life for me!

With the sequel set to come out in July, I thought it was time I reviewed the phenomenal movie that is Pirates of the Caribbean. The basic plot is this: A shipful of cursed pirates possess a treasure that causes them to turn into skeletons whenever there's a full moon--which is, through an unfortunate mistake, every single night. They must return the treasure to break the curse. Meanwhile, Captain Sparrow holds a grudge on the Captain, Barbossa, and intends to get around the slight difficulty of the fact that he is unkillable. Orlando Bloom as Will Turner lusts after Kiera Knightly as Elizabeth Swann, despite the fact that she is enaged to Commordore Norrington, played by Jack Davenport who gives a great performance.

This movie stars two of today's biggest stars: Johnny Depp, in the performance of a lifetime, and Orlando Bloom, in a performance that is pretty much an afterthought. I originally watched this for Bloom, but the character I fell in love with was Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow. He based the character on Keith Richards, and it shows.

You should refresh your memory with a quick viewing of this if you don't want to miss Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chest, which is coming out soon and promises to be one of the best summer movies. However, you'll soon find yourself watching it again...and again...and again...

The special features are nice, but the commentaries aren't that great. There are frequent long silences. The most interesting feature is the interactive exploration of a pirate ship. There are also some neat featurettes about the making of the movie, but none of the features are especially standout good. The main event is definitely the movie itself.

1489758,5,B00005JM5E,"Ever read those proposal stories where the guys buries his ring box inside something like 10 boxes, progressively bigger in size? It's as if there's way too much than is necessary, 2's probably good enough but 10? So Pirates of the Caribbean manages to be solid fun that feels way too long for it's own good. What you get here though is fun in the meantime it's just a case of a director loving his work too much.

It's a movie based on a theme park at Disneyland so it's obviously not going to have the most complicated plot but this is Disney so no need to worry. Basically, Captain Jack Sparrow with the help of Will and Elizabeth try to take down Barbossa, captain of a ship swarming with cursed pirates. That's basically it in a nutshell.

Many were skeptical about the film when it came out. Remember Cutthroat Island? For those who haven't seen it, consider yourself lucky. Us other people tried to erase it from our minds but we just can't, so another pirate movie, based on a theme park attraction also, surely wouldn't be a hit. And look at that, it became a huge money maker, most likely due to the action, effects and it's lead star.

It's produced by Jerry Bruckheimer so one word should come to mind: explosions. He likes make thing go boom very often and here you of course get explosions and cannon fire, although there is some swordplay too. The effects are quite stellar with some cool shots of skeletons washing the deck and causing mischief. My favorite shot is when they're underwater coming out from the darkness, very nicely done. Even later in the film where 2 characters are going in and out of skeletal and their real forms you can see quick transitions.

Watching you're bound to notice one thing: Johnny Depp. Incredibly versatile, he's one of the few actors that you can probably write him any kind of part and he'll be good(although to be fair, I'm not a fan of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). Drawing inspiration from Keith Richards, he plays an androgynous and very twitchy captain that you can't help but like. The rest of the cast is good too although I'm not a fan of Orlando Bloom in anything.

The length is an issue since they kind of overstretched a plot that's bordering on snapping in half but still it's great fun, just watch it now and then.",1144022400,,2288,4.516908212560386
1489759,4,B00005JM5E,"Director: Gore Verbinski

Cast:  Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport, Jonathan Pryce, Lee Arenberg, Mackenzie Crook.

Running Time:  143 minutes

Rated PG-13 for action/adventure violence and brief language.

Despite being rife with technical blunders such as the longest full moon in history, Disney's first non-PG film is proving to be a financial boon while at the same time collecting reviews from critics that run from tepid to red hot. I am in complete agreement with Roger Ebert on one point: Somewhere in this 143 minute tour de force there lurks a very good ninety-minute film.  Other than Johnny Depp, who fashioned his character's personality (and eye makeup?) after observations of his good friend Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, the cast of 'Pirates' reads like a Who's Who of English film actors, including Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport and Mackenzie Crook.  When screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio originally pitched the movie to the Disney executives in the early '90s, Disney rejected it. It makes one wonder just who is running the Disney Empire. Universal Studios have been combining action/adventure movies with theme park rides for over two decades (""E.T."", ""Jurassic Park"", ""Jaws"", and ""Back to the Future"" to name a few) only in reverse order-first the film, then the ride. This combination has worked well for Universal, and it seems almost absurd that Disney has taken so long to pick up on the obvious.

Situated in the British, Caribbean colony of Port Royal, Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley) wishes to live the life of a pirate and not a governor's daughter, while her admirer, the impoverished blacksmith, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), wishes to deny his own pirate roots. Then, a once mischievous Captain Jack Sparrow (played brilliantly by Johnny Depp) enters the town with his agenda of rounding up a crew, stealing a British naval ship and retrieving his rights as captain of the Black Pearl pirate ship, havoc ensues.  The entrance of the damned Black Pearl's crew into Port Royal is quickly summoned by the last missing piece of treasure, which calls them when Swann falls into the water with it (a gold coin) wrapped around her neck. The pirates sac the town, stealing Swann and headed to return the treasure and break their curse. The chase is on, once Turner springs Sparrow from jail, for the ship and its desired possessions. The hero's luck runs out, but just when all hope is lost, Sparrow devises a plan to save his ship, get Will his girl and escape the grips of both the cursed pirates and dim-witted British navy.

Filled with an excellent cast and first-rate special effects, ""Pirates"" makes it easy to truthfully accept the unbelievably fantastical events of the film including sword fights, pirate ships on the open seas, cannon warfare, and caves of treasure. Director Gore Verbinski brings out the best of his actors, who enable the sometimes-cheesy script to flow smoothly and as convincing dialogue. Depp's typical ability to create a quirky and enchanting character is again fulfilled in his drunken pirate role. He illustrates the character's bad luck but determined nature, making him the admirable good/bad guy. Depp's humorous line delivery and outstanding timing nicely accompany his scruff appearance, adorned with eyeliner, a bead-embellished wig, and braided goatee.  Rush also performs his role of the evil pirate convincingly and with his usual gifted acting talent. Bloom slips nicely into his usual typecast role as the love-driven romantic young lad, and his opposite, then seventeen-year-old, British actress, Knightley brings the adventurous, bold, and beautiful identity of Swann to life.  Though none of these characters exist in the Disney adventure ride, there are two similar scenes that lovers of the ride will recognize, one being the stop at pirate infested Tortuga Island. The storyline does become a bit boring and redundant, as the minutes turn to hours, creating the feeling of dj vu. Yet, the scheming scoundrel Jack Sparrow saves the day, and the audience's attention only to sacrifice himself to capture by the Royal Navy. Don't worry, though, it all ends well as a good Disney movie should.  Splendid, superb Hollywood fun.",1143849600,3,4277,5.161849710982659

1489858,5,B00005JM5E,"Firstly, lets bare in mind that there hasn't been a good pirate movie in a while. And that's just too long to go without one. Pirates Of The Carribean: The curse of the black pearl all starts out with a legend. A legend of cursed aztec gold. Anyone who touches or steals it is cursed to live the rest of his/her days as a walking bag of bones, unable to enjoy drinks, food, or touch. A lost boy on a wrecked ship holds the gold around his neck. A young girl retrieves it and holds on to it while they both grow up. After seeing what their grown up selves look like, we get a taste of the sea air and . . .in sails Captain Jack Sparrow. The real Hero of the story, in my opnion.

From the moment we meet him, we are already curious and slowly dipping into giddy excitement as he says his first lines and sounds remarkably like a drunken pirate who really leaves his mark.

He takes on the kind of personality of Buggs Bunny/Groucho Marx/Keith richards persona. But, like all pirates, he's always looking for a way out, a way in, or just a way to a good angle.

Throughout the adventures of Will, Elizabeth, and Captain Jack, we are steady as she goes and just begging for more and more and get delivered more and more excitement followed by endless laughs.

The jokes are well-executed, the special effects are good and not overally done, the plot is solid, the amount of settings is vast and beautiful, and the choreography of the sword fights is amazing.

All the way you'll be rooting for Captain Jack Sparrow and glued to your seat with rambunctious delight.

You'll love it. A sure-fire winner. Believe me, people, there was a reason why this little beauty of a movie racked in 600 million dollars worldwide.

1489865,4,B00005JM5E,"Pirates of the Carribean is a mixture of silliness and seriousness which can be odd but is never unitersting. Depp plays Jack Sparrow, a pirate outcast who finds himself running from those that find him a blasphamy. Eventually Elizabeth, played Kiera Knightly, is kidnapped by cursed pirates bent on getting back their gold coins so they can be human once again. Jack and Will, Elizabeth's love, set off to rescue her. Their adventure has drama and quirkiness, and has some unexpected turns.

The whole idea that these cursed pirates could ever actually have found every one of their gold coins is obsurd as some could very well be at the bottom of the ocean. The film doesn't play to historical realism. Instead it plays to creating a world of its own, and there is does a good job. There are some fun battles, and one of the better swordfights in recent cinematic history. Bloom and Knightly do adaquet jobs, though both are certianly overshadowed by Depp's onscreen carisma.

It goes a little too long at nearly two and a half hours, and I wasn't big on the ending, but it should satisfy most adventure fans. It's not a great movie. I'm not really looking forward to the sequel because I fear the combination won't work as well once again. Take what you want it's satisfying.",1139097600,3,1278,4.6755555555555555

I never saw it until this year when I was encouraged to get it by a friend. Even when I bought it I was preparing for disappointment despite the recommendations. I could not have been more wrong!

The storyline is believable; it is set in the 1700s during the days of the British colonies in the Caribbean. A pirate captain named Sparrow (Depp) has had his ship - the Black Pearl - stolen by another pirate, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). When Sparrow sails into Port Royal, he is incarcerated to await hanging. However, while he is in prison, Barbossa attacks Port Royal and kidnaps the governor's daughter, Elizabeth (Knightley). Knowing this, a young man named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) suggests the governor release Sparrow to track down Barbossa & his men. Sparrow & Turner hastily put a crew together to go after the Black Pearl & Elizabeth. What neither one knows is that Barbossa and his crew have been cursed by an Aztec treasure that they stole, and to which Elizabeth is carrying the last missing piece. The curse laid on Barbossa & his men sentences them to eternal life - as the living dead; a ghastly group of skeletons & ghosts walking the decks of the Black Pearl. Until the last piece of treasure is returned - 'and the blood repaid' - Barbossa & his men will remain cursed. The blood to be repaid? Elizabeth's! Sparrow, Turner & their makeshift pirate crew hastily hijack a ship to go after the wily Barbossa & get the Black Pearl - and Elizabeth - back in one piece.

This movie deserved Academy Awards for cinematography & score. It also had solid acting, especially Geoffrey Rush & Johnny Depp. Some of the scenes are a bit frightening and may not be suitable for the littlest ones.

1489939,5,B00005JM5E,"This has to be the stupidest idea for movie in all of history.  A movie based on an amusement park ride?  A pirate movie?  A cursed pirate movie?  A cursed undead pirate movie?  This couldn't have worked.  This SHOULDN'T have worked!  But somehow, it did.

Start with the cast.  Johnny Depp flat out steals the movie with a Captain Jack Sparrow that is partly Keith Richards and partly Pepe Le Pew, but Geoffrey Rush gives him quite a run for his treasure as the evil incarnate, Captain Barbossa.  Orlando Bloom as the earnestly heroic Will Turner and Keira Knightly as the spunky Elizabeth Swann round out the four great stars, but even the supporting cast members give memorable performances.  Jonathan Pryce is amazing as the cowardly, weaselly Governor Swann, and Jack Davenport is the very model of terminal stiff upper lip disease as the ramrod Lieutenant/Commodore Norrington.  Kevin McNally gives a fine turn as Mr. Gibbs.  There are also a couple of classic comic pairings: pirates Pintel and Ragetti (Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook) and soldiers (marines?) Murtogg and Mullroy (Giles New and Angus Barnett).

If you listen to the screenwriters' commentary track, you'll be even more amazed because beyond the basic concept of cursed undead pirates returning treasure rather than stealing it, everything else about the plot was constantly in flux.  So why does it work?  Well, beyond great performances, the key is the proper balance of drama and humor.  Like costumed superheroes before them it was almost impossible to imagine anyone doing pirates well; there had been too many embarrassing failures swinging wildly between camp and straight (Roman Polanski's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pirates/dp/B000AATRFE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pirates</a>&nbsp;and Renny Harlin's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cutthroat-Island/dp/B000NQRR1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cutthroat Island</a>&nbsp;come to mind).  POTC works because although the characters often say funny things and do funny things, they are deadly serious all the while: Sparrow is ever after his ship; Elizabeth is trying to save Will; Will is trying to save Elizabeth; the cursed pirates are trying to lift the curse; and Norrington is trying to lift the pirates... onto a gallows.  All these conflicting interests guarantee plenty of sparks.  The fact that the special effects are downright stunning doesn't hurt.

The question that cannot be answered yet is whether the creators understand why it worked.  With two back-to-back sequels in the works will this be another&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Back-to-the-Future/dp/B00006AL1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Back to the Future</a>, with two marvelous sequels or another&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B00000K19E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>, with two terrible sequels that leave you convinced the first movie was just a fluke?

Johnny Depp shines as Captain Jack Sparrow, a cleverly klutzy pirate who is in search for the Black Pearl and the crew that mutinied it from him.  Leader of the mutineers is Captain Barbossa, a mean dirty pirate with a curse that sends him searching for the pieces of some ancient Aztec gold... and the blood of a good pirate's son.

It also involves a side story about that young son (Will Turner, played by Orlando Bloom) and the love of his life (Elizabeth Swann, played by Keira Knightley), but nobody cares.

Honestly, Johnny Depp MADE the movie.  His perfect characterization of a quirky swashbuckler is both funny and memorable.  His personality and charisma shines from screen to screen as he tries to figure out how to get what he wants when everybody else seems to be against him.

Depp by himself, though, would have made for a strained and bad movie indeed.  Even a good actor with a good character can be dire and silly in a movie that doesn't compliment them.  Thus we have Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa, the driven evil that compliments Depp's Sparrow well.  Rush obviously had a lot of fun with the role and it's a real joy to see him, especially when working off of Depp.

It also has some pretty good dialog, stuff to make you laugh in between action moments.  Very quotable, stuff like, ""Where's the rum?"" which is bound to stay in fanboy lingo for ages to come.

  The Pirates of the Caribbean is an action-packed, thrilling movie. I think the movie is the best pirate movie ever made in history.

  The Pirates of the Caribbean is an action-packed movie. Captain Jack Sparrow kidnaps Elizabeth, daughter of Governor Weatherby Swann. Then, the captain breaks out of jail. At the end, Captain Sparrow and his archenemy. Captain Barbossa, have an all-out sword battle.

  The Pirates of the Caribbean is also filled with many suspense scenes. When Captain Sparrow breaks out of jail, the towns' people are chasing him around town. Then, Captain Jack Sparrow is stranded on an island without anything to eat. In the end, the two captains have a tremendous sword fight.

  The movie also contains a few comedy scenes as well. The Captain tries to talk to the women at the bar, but each of the women slap him. When Captain Barbossa is fighting Captain

Sparrow, they both turn into ghosts and then can't kill each other. In the end, the Captain kisses Elizabeth and tries to escape. He trips over the side of the fort, falling into the ocean.

  Lastly, the movie also contains some romance. The Captain's partner, Will Turner, kisses Elizabeth to start a connection between them. Then Captain Sparrow saves Elizabeth from the

horrible pirates. In addition, Elizabeth saves Captain Sparrow and Will from being hung.

1490155,3,B00005JM5E,"""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is the kind of movie that most people enjoy for different reasons, but that never really amounts to anything substantial. The script was altogether bad, so commenting on the individual performances of the actors seems to be the most logical thing to do. Needless to say, my focus was almost entirely on Johnny Depp the first time I saw this movie. He gives a good performance, and makes you want to watch him throughout the whole movie, and never pay attention to anyone else. However, seeing the movie a second time, I realized that Rush's performance was as good, if not better than Depp's. Orlando Bloom did an average job playing an average, slightly stupid character. Kiera Knightly was possibly the worst actor in this movie; she seemed fake and inconsistent throughout most of her performance. The only character worse than Elizabeth (who's lines, by the way, were most obnoxious and unrealistic) was the random female pirate, whom we meet when we hear a high-pitched squeal of ""You stole my ship!!"". Pirate movies are not made to impress obsessive feminists, okay? This actor, whoever she was, obviously didn't put an ounce of effort into developing her character. Commodor Noringtton wasn't too bad, except his change in the end seemed completely random, and not character-driven at all. Also, the music was terrible, especially for the half-dead pirates (good special effects), but maybe it was supposed to be bad?

All in all, however, this was a fun movie to watch. I could go on complaining about it forever, and thinking of ways it could have been better, but, as much as I sometimes hate to admit it, I really enjoy watching this movie.

Few people know this but Pirates of the Caribbean is based on a true story. My great grandfathers charactor is represented in the movie but I will not reveal it to avoid any legal trouble in the family. The movie is a fairly good representation of the pirate way of life, but not an exact documentary. To be percise pirates are drunk 94% of their lives, this is not shown in the film. Also pirates have a lot more sex than is shown. The director sliped in the scene where the ghost pirates kill all of the british soliders, though a ghost pirate can not be killed he can be defeated by an expert swordsman. A major downfall of the movie is the fact that the ghost pirates can not eat or drink successfully. A real pirate carries his ability to drink alcohol into the afterlife, therefore a real ghost pirate can (and will) get drunk.

1490283,4,B00005JM5E,"When I first heard that Disney had sunk to the depths of using its rides as inspirations for its movies, my first thought was, ""Where are they going to get new ideas for their rides, then?""  I did not feel any better when I heard the plot - a pirate crew plunders an Aztec temple and is subsequently cursed until all the gold is reassembled.  The cursed crew wreaks mayhem on the Caribbean in this quest.

I then heard about the cast - especially Johnny Depp and Geoffery Rush, two actors that only seek interesting parts.  And that best describes the film: a dull story raised well above its genre by the quality of the performances.  To wit: It is a standard pirate story containing shipboard swashbuckling and a damsel in distress.  There is also a potentially corny Jane Austinesque love triangle where the girl must decide between the noble and safe match in marriage over the poor boy she actually loves.  There is some novelty in the scale and quality of the special effects, but Erol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks have already amply covered this territory.

Depp especially, and also Rush descend on this plot with reckless abandon.  Rush chews up the scenery as the captain of the cursed pirates.  He had previously taken over the ship from its former captain, played by Depp.  As is common knowledge now, Depp somehow channels the personality of quirky, slightly effeminate rock stars (such as Keith Richards) in a way that he crafts a memorable and not out-of-place main character around which the film can support itself.  None of the action can be absurd because Depp himself is so absurd that this Caribbean is like a parallel universe.  Everything then follows from this performance - we can enjoy Rush's over-the-top performance, we can enjoy the absurd curse plot, etc.

Ironically, the best performance after Depp's might actually be Orlando Bloom's as the town's earnest and upright blacksmith.  He is in the unenviable position of needing to be the foil for Depp as the Depp walks off with all the best lines and action.  He wisely avoids trying to compete, or to try and create his own over-the-top characterisation.  Because of this choice, the film has a core of sanity to contrast and offset the performances of Depp and Rush.  The combination works extremely well, helped by the lesser characters, such as the naval commodore entrusted with hunting the pirates.

This DVD edition is quite good.  It's got the usual commentaries and deleted scenes, but also a very interesting making-of featurette suite, including a video diary of the captain of the Lady Washington (the ship that ""played"" the British frigate Interceptor in the film) and that ship's voyage from its home port in California through the Panama Canal.  There is also some information on real pirates - their lives and biographies of some notable examples.

1490289,3,B00005JM5E,"`Pirates of the Caribbean' is a mixed-bag of a film.  If you just want some fun and don't mind a moronic plot and some mediocre performances, this might be a great film.  In fact, it is possible that the silly plot and too-relaxed performances are genius.  They might be director's style.  After two watchings, I haven't yet decided.  Johnny Depp is certainly the main character, as Pirate Captain Jack Sparrow.  He plays a Kieth Richards knock-off; androgynous and with too much kohl under the eyes, he goes around like a man on a triple Quaalude overdose. Since he has all the good lines, this is actually probably deathly witty, rather than deathly dull.

Yes, the film is based on a Disneyland ride, so did you expect a Shakespearean plot?  No, and at least the silly plot has great effects.  Geoffrey Rush is also likeable as the pirate Barbossa, complete with all his clichs including the animal familiar and the ""arrr, arr, arr"" stuff.  Truth be told, he sounds like the old salt on 'The Simpsons.'

On the other hand, Orlando Bloom is so low-key as to be genuinely dull as the too-sincere young man who needs to discover his pirate roots.  And Jonathan Pryce, one of the greatest actors alive, is wasted in a smallish, poorly-played role as the British Colonial Governor.

So, a mixed review and a gut feeling that this is probably a film you need to see for yourself.  If you don't like the film, at least the ""making of"" feature on the extra disc is uproariously funny!",1125619200,3,1479,4.616858237547893
1490290,3,B00005JM5E,"...(and already a classic it seems) is the special effects, the THX-sound, and acting of Johnny Depp bringing life to a highly peculiar pirate (and well done so). The story has its' moments I admit, but personally I don't get the hype here. Opinions can be many, I realize, and it's a visually well-functioning adventure-movie with several of Hollywoods' ""hot"" act/ors/tresses (and with Johnny Depp on top I guess), but I think Orlando Bloom is the worst action-actor ever (he was ok in his feminine elf-suit when he played ballerina in the ""Lord of the Rings""-triology), but he gives overacting an entirely new meaning. And I find him simply annoying. He does not deserve to play lead next to the legendary Johnny Depp. Not that I am in awe with him and all his work (Depps' I mean), but the man certainly knows how to act and was the only joy to watch in ""Pirates..."". Him and G.Rush perhaps. The camera-work and special-effects iare indeed appealing, and the story has its' moments as mentioned -but it's not that amazing. People call this a masterpiece, and the most fantastic adventure-movie ever -but having seen it twice, and getting a bit bored the second -well, I have to say I disagree. ""Pirates..."" is ok. Average big-budget movie that does not inspire. The story is a bit too ""modern"", it's like ""Lethal Weapon"" on waves. Orlando Bloom should have been used as shark-bait, and I expected it to be funnier -of course Depp is the clown of the show here, but too much dialogue is wasted on things we've heard thousands of times before. Like the scene where those guards starts to argue over two ships and forget they are dealing with a pirate (the Depp-character in the beginning of the movie when he has just arrived the place where later the ghost ship attacks). That scene was just embarrasing, but on the other hand -it is Disney and ment for the children too...

This is simply a reaction of yet another overrated movie, no big deal of course -and people certainly have a right to've enjoyed it.",1125273600,,2009,4.659154929577465

1490458,4,B00005JM5E,"...this is a good film. It is fun, interesting and keeps the attention. It may not be great dramatic art but it is a lot of fun.

The story concerns the pirate captain, Jack Sparrow, played by Depp, and his quest to avenge himself of a mutinous crew and a stolen ship. What complicates matters immensely is that the crew and the ship are now under a curse and cannot be killed. Those same crewmen will do virtually anything to rid themselves of their curse and the ""cure"" involves an act of human sacrifice. Not just any human will do, it has to be the last living descendant of another pirate. That is where the love story comes in.

The movie is both macabre and funny. The naval scenes are laughable in terms of accuracy but enjoyable just the same. I just love old ships. Depp plays his character with gusto. He is vain, self-centered, crafty, dry of wit and hilarious.  This one is not to be taken seriously but it should be taken.

Something to consider is the DVD itself. I tired to play it on my computer but had no success. It worked fine in a regular DVD player but failed in 3 out of 4 computers I tried it on. Caveat Emptor.",1121990400,3,1136,4.269767441860465
1490459,5,B00005JM5E,"I wonder who at Disney Studios came up with the idea of making movies based on some of their theme park attractions? In my opinion, the idea should have sounded ludicrous, basing a feature length film on a 5-10 minute long ride, impossible. Apparently someone at Disney thought the idea had some merit, though why is beyond me. Especially when the first attempt was the incredibly lame Disney film ""The Country Bears"", it is mind boggling that even after such a failure that some executive still said ok to another movie based on a theme park attraction. But, thank God for that executive that gave the idea the green light, because had they not we never would have been treated to what is absolutely the best pirate movie ever created, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"".

""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" centers on a legendary pirate crew that stole a treasure trove of Aztec gold, that unbeknownst to them carried a dark curse. The curse was that if anyone stole the gold and then separated any of the pieces from the rest of the loot then that person would become the undead. In daylight they would look normal and would never know the curse was upon them, but when moonlight shone they would appear in their cursed form. Now, the undead pirates of the Black Pearl are in search of all the gold pieces they had stolen and spent on various items, a search that has led them far and wide. With only one piece left to retrieve they come to a British settlement in search of the final piece that will lift the curse. The regional governor's daughter, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) is in possession of the final piece and is taken when she invokes an ancient pirate code of parlay, which demands that she be taken to the pirate captain for negotiation. However, the negotiation doesn't quite go as planned and Elizabeth becomes prisoner of the undead pirates. With Elizabeth missing, a local blacksmith, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who happens to be in love with her, embarks on a quest to rescue his damsel in distress. To succeed in this endeavor Will must ally himself with that which he hates the most, a pirate. Assisting Will in his endeavor is the pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow (a hilarious Johnny Depp), who just so happens to know where the Black Pearl and its crew of the undead call home. For once upon a time, Jack was the captain of the Black Pearl, until he was overthrown in a mutiny led by his traitorous first mate Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush). Now this unlikely pair of heroes set off on their quest, one who is willing to risk it all for the love of his life and the other who simply wants vengeance and to reclaim what was once his.

Though the idea of adapting a theme park ride into a blockbuster movie must have sounded ridiculous (and still does), it's obvious that someone at Disney knew what he or she were doing and the gamble paid off big time. In my opinion the gamble wouldn't have been as successful if not for producer Jerry Bruckheimer (""The Rock"" and ""Con Air""). I wonder if Bruckheimer had any idea just how massive of a hit he had on his hands when he signed on to produce this film, who knows, but the choice was definitely a wise one.

All of the actors delivered outstanding performances, especially Johnny Depp (""Sleepy Hollow"") as the outrageous Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom (`Lord of the Rings' trilogy) and Keira Knightley (""King Arthur"") were perfectly cast as the other two leads in the film, lending a more normal tone to the picture to balance out Jack's quirky characteristics. Geoffrey Rush was probably one of the biggest surprises for me as Captain Barbosa, I had never seen him in a blockbuster type of film, but he handled the part with ease. Rush played the traitorous Barbosa with a deliciously evil streak who took great joy in the knowledge that he could not be killed, yet there was a hint of sadness at the thought of an eternity cursed and a yearning to be human again.

Assisting the cast, especially the cursed pirates were the visual effects wizards at George Lucas' ILM (Industrial Light and Magic). This group has always done outstanding work on all of their various projects, but the effects they've created here are by far their best ever. The scenes where the cursed pirates switch from human to skeleton form are absolutely flawless, outstanding work from a highly talented organization.

With all that being said, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is proof that sometimes a risk, no matter how foolish it may appear to be, can pay off many times over. All you need is an entertaining and solid script, with wonderful acting from the entire cast, and incredibly realistic CGI effects and you may just have yourself a summer blockbuster that audiences will come back to time and time again.

""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is rated PG-13 for violence and mild language.",1121904000,,4932,4.637299771167048

The characters are all good. There's the stuffy Commodore, all spit, polish, and rules. There's the evil pirate crew, grubby, growling, and direly in need of dentistry. We have not one but two pairs of thickwits for comic relief. We also have an Earnest Young Lad (Orlando Bloom), silently pining for The Maiden (Keira Knightley), who silently pines for The Lad, too, despite their different stations in life. Then there's the undefinable character who ties all the threads together, Jack - sorry, Captain Jack Sparrow.

Of course, Depp (as Sparrow) makes his character truly memorable. He's either a mad scourge of the seven seas, or a wobbly, mascaraed clown, or maybe both. Depp brings his unique versatility to the part, but the part also contributes to the breadth of Depp's career. Sparrow is one more in Depp's incredible spectrum of characters.

OK, we're not talking about anyone's epic masterpiece here. It's a summer movie, with adventure, goofiness, and people keeping their clothes on, mostly. Some days, that's just what I want.

1490463,5,B00005JM5E,"Enough has been said already about Johnny Depp's incredibly original performance....he both steals and makes the movie. If he had played the character straight, it would have been safer but a lot less enjoyable. I've got to wonder what everyone on the set must have thought when he showed up on the first day of shooting...$125 million on the line and your high-dollar, sexy, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. leading man shows up with catfish whiskers, impersonating Keith Richard in drag. The producers probably fainted....but thank god they had sense enough to let him proceed.

Geoffrey Rush (Capt. Barbossa) gives him a run for his money in some scenes, but Johnny rules the roost when it comes to creating bizarre characters.

I thought the movie seemed a bit long, with some redundant situations, but must admit that it was generally entertaining and amusing throughout, with some really great moments and dialog.

I was, however, somewhat distracted by Keira Knightley's lips....collagen OD??....and her incessant pouting. Someone must have told her that this would make her sexy and irresistable....they lied. Maybe she felt that since ""Keith Richard"" was going over so well, she would throw in a little Mick Jagger. Fortunately, the drunken beach party with Captain Jack restored her to my good graces, but for god's sake, Keira, lay off the collagen.

Buy, rent, borrow, or steal the DVD...it is a truly clever and entertaining 143 minutes. This, like the pirate's code, is not an inflexible demand....it is simply a ""guideline"".",1121472000,2,1529,5.153225806451613
1490539,5,B00005JM5E,"One of the most thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining movies to come along in recent memory, with genuinely clever dialogue (for a change) and a strong ending (avoiding the curse of so many recent movies that start out strong and then peter out - like DAREDEVIL for example).

Here's the point I want to make: This movie would've been even more shocking and scary had they waited to reveal the ""moonlight curse"" until Captain Barbosa stepped out on the deck of the Pearl, transforming into a skeleton before our eyes and scaring the pee out of Elizabeth. This sudden, terrifying revelation could've made a much bigger impact on the audience (and they shouldn't have wasted this scene in previews either). As it is, we first learn of the curse when Captain Jack is in jail and one of the Black Pearl pirates grabs his neck in the moonlight, his arm turning skeletal. But, as we learn later, Jack should've turned skeletal in that scene as well.

A minor complaint, as the film is still a huge load of fun.

Johnny Depp is a somewhat less dashing and romantic figure than Errol Flynn, but he plays a pirate with a wonderful flair for style, humor and a touch of drama. Orlando Bloom as Will Turner takes the romantic lead, primarily with beautiful Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann, the daughter of Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce).

We are quickly introduced to Captain Jack Sparrow, a notorious pirate. We also quickly learn that Captain Jack must be one of the luckiest men alive as he escapes from one catastrophe after another. We soon encounter Will Turner and learn that he has been making swords and practicing with them for three hours a day. Of course, we saw him in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, and we can attest to his apparent excellence with blades of steel. We also meet Elizabeth Swann early in this movie, and what a beautiful woman she is, perfect for being a central character from the beginning of this movie to the end.

The last central character we meet is the pirate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). We soon learn that Barbossa and the crew of the pirate ship Black Pearl have been cursed; a curse which can only be broken by gathering together of a chest of gold and spilling the blood of a certain person. Since the time of the curse Barbossa has been seeking a single piece of gold and a relative of a man named Turner.

The action continues briskly from the beginning to the end, with the often bumbling pirates seeming to keep the upper hand from the beginning to nearly the end of the movie. Of course, once we learn that the pirates are dead we understand better that they can not be defeated. I leave the end for the viewer to discover.

This movie is based loosely on the Disney ride. There are scenes in the movie that are based on scenes from the ride. Those scenes tend to be some of the funnier scenes. However, other than being inspired by the ride and having a few scenes based on the ride, the movie departs quite far from the ride itself, and the departure is all to the good.

There have been a few attempts at making swashbuckler movies in the last several decades. A few have done reasonably well. However, this movie is a nice throwback to the eras of Errol Flynn and Burt Lancaster. There are quite a number of nice stunts, and the ships are beautiful. The movie contains a number of moderately scary moments, and the violence is pervasive, so the PG-13 rating is justified, and should probably cause parents to consider what age should be permitted to watch this movie.

He staggers and slurs - he has said that he patterned his performance after friend Keith Richards as he figures his character has the personna of a modern-day rock star.  I'm not sure what Mr. Richards thinks of this. There's a scene where Captain Jack gets drunk as a skunk on rum on a deserted island, and his personna really doesn't change at all.  Captain Jack has lost his beloved pirate ship, The Black Pearl, to his rival Captain Barbossa, played in an equally fun and over-the-top performance by Geoffrey Rush.  Barbossa is the yang to Sparrows ying and he gets absolutely fantastic lines like ""I'm disinclined to acquiesce to your request - that means NO!""

Warning: NOT FOR THE VERY YOUNG!!!

.

Summary:

An enjoyable, interesting and fun pirate adventure with lots of good humor, great scenery, solid script supported by excellent acting all around.

WARNING :

ONLY for older kids and possibly teenagers and not too squeamish adults.  The ""Living Dead"" pirates (shown 2/3's of the way through the film) can bother more sensitive viewers!!

With that said, my young son - the pirate lover -  was able to differentiate between the story's realism and the ""Living Dead"" make believe - but, his older sister was not able to.

Review:

Fun movie with a great script, great filming, great editing, great special effects, great story, great acting, good humor, great scenery, lot's great story evolution, of fun. (this review is just too easy).

But, too scary for some people and not appropriate for the very young.  I really wish this had not been so well pursued, because I think this would otherwise be a fun movie for my young son.

Story:

Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is an affected pirate Captain in port in search of a ship in the 18th century Caribbean who finds the ""leverage"" (blacksmith and expert swordsman Will Turner played by Orlando Bloom) to re-acquire ""his"" ""Black Pearl"" ship that was taken from him by his mutinous crew and the infamous Captain Barbossa (expertly played by Geoffrey Rush).  Sparrow and Turner's adventure is propelled forward by Turner's love for Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley - in a very talented role as the Governor's daughter) who has been kidnaped by Captain Barbossa by mistake in her identity.

DVD's Extra's

Commentary is good, not great.  I wished for more.  Other DVD extra's are plentiful and excellent:  like making of the film, deleted scenes, etc. and well worth the time and investment for the DVD.",1116806400,,1804,4.9072847682119205
1490655,5,B00005JM5E,"This book is based on the Disneyland ride of the same name, not something that would inspire you to watch it....however, suspend any preconceptions because this is a terrific film. Starring Johnny Depp as the pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow, Orlando Bloom as Will, the young blacksmith and Keira Knightly as Elizabeth, the governor's daughter, this movie couldn't fail.

The story is a simple one. There is a ship, the Black Pearl, formerly owned by Captain Sparrow and now led by an evil captain (Simon Callow) and crewed by pirates cursed never to die until a final piece of stolen gold is returned to its rightful place. Elizabeth has been in possession of this missing gold since she was a girl but never known its significance. When the Black Pearl discovers the whereabouts of this missing treasure they set forth to Elizabeth's home and kidnap her. Soon Will and Jack are in hot pursuit, Will because he loves Elizabeth and Jack because he wants revenge on the pirates who stole his beloved ship from him.

Johnny Depp is brilliant as the camp, funny Captain Sparrow (whom he based on Keith Richards of Rolling Stones fame) and he certainly steals the show in spite of worthy performances from the rest of the cast.

Also Orlando Bloom has wonderful love with the heroine. I have to talk some about the skeletons because they are so powerful. They got cursed from the missing coins, so they must find the coins and correct them; otherwise they would never die, so they gave lots troubles to Johnny and Orlando. So it made the story became more interesting. Formerly I never liked a role so quickly and so profoundly as Johnny Depp's role. So it's a recommended movie for anyone who likes action, humor and adventure, and it's a good entertaining movie. I hope you will enjoy it.",1116547200,,978,4.5625

1490660,5,B00005JM5E,"The ever-brilliant Johnny Depp has listed his influences for creating the much beloved Captain Jack Sparrow: Keith Richards, Pepe Le Pew and, as TIME magazine just informed us, the mechanical pirates at Disneyland. I see another. El Gallo, the Spanish gypsy in Broadway's longest-running musical ""The Fantasticks."" Certainly Captain Jack looks more like El Gallo than the sketches Disney drew of him and we know Johnny helped create his character's look. El Gallo was first played on Broadway by ""Law & Order,"" ""Dirty Dancing, and Broadway star Jerry Orbach, who died last year. (Orbach once said his favorite Hollywood actor was Johnny Depp.) There is a funny inside joke in ""Dirty Dancing"" when Baby's dancing talent is revealed. Her mother says to that great Broadway star Orbach, ""I think she gets it from me."" The movie version of ""The Fantastisks"" (2000) starred Joel Grey (not as El Gallo). Joel Grey is Jennifer Grey's super-talented father, who was all set to become Johnny Depp's father-in-law in real life once upon a time. In ""The Fantasticks,"" the great worldy swordsman El Gallo crosses blades with an innocent young hero and even pretends to kidnap and seduce his fianc to help bring the young lovers together. He is wise, sexy, funny - sounds like Captain Jack to me!",1114905600,,1283,4.972093023255814
1490661,4,B00005JM5E,"If someone told me six months ago I would soon watch a film based on a Disney amusement park ride, I would have kicked him or her in the shin. Heck, if someone told me I would watch a Disney film six months ago I would have kicked them on the other shin and called it a day. I avoid Disney films like the plague--with a few notable exceptions mostly involving some of their older animated features--because I think the quality of their cinematic endeavors has dropped markedly over the last couple of decades. Yet I can now say I've watched ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl."" I didn't willingly seek this movie out at first, however. I heard so many good things about it, mostly focusing on Johnny Depp's character, that I felt I should give it a look. Too, my girlfriend raved about the movie after seeing it in the theater with her sister. And we all know what happens when the significant other loves something: he or she insists on inflicting said object on the other individual in the relationship. Looking back on the experience, things could have been much worse; I could have ended up watching the latest Jennifer Lopez or Meg Ryan flick.

""Pirates of the Caribbean"" begins by introducing us to Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce) and his daughter Elizabeth (played as an older girl later by Keira Knightley). The two are sailing from England to Port Royal, one of the country's Caribbean possessions, when the ship they are on comes across some wreckage in the water. They find a young boy, Will Turner (later played by Orlando Bloom) clinging to a piece of debris. Suspecting pirates are to blame for the destruction of this vessel, it's no surprise that we catch a glimpse of an ominous ship sailing off into the fog. We soon learn that this boat is likely the legendary Black Pearl, a cursed pirate craft that supposedly ran into trouble with some stolen treasure a few years back. Or something like that. Anyway, Turner comes aboard and the boat continues its journey to the island. Flash forward a bunch of years as Governor Weatherby Swann and his now teenage daughter plan her impending marriage to Commander Norrington (Jack Davenport). Will Turner stayed on at Port Royal as an apprentice to the island's blacksmith and, predictably, carries a burning torch in his heart for the divine Elizabeth. Of course, Elizabeth really loves him but class concerns prevent such a union.

Then the movie throws a wrench into this unfolding romantic drama as Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) arrives on the island in glorious fashion. He's a pirate by trade and disposition, no doubt about that, but he's also this film's salvation. He struts about in gaudy clothing, drenched in mascara, and spouts off the most irreverent dialogue. In no time at all the authorities take him into custody and prepare to hang him. He escapes, of course, just in time to witness the arrival of the Black Pearl and the destruction of Port Royal. Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), the Pearl's commanding officer, came to Port Royal to find the one thing that can remove the curse from him and his crew. What that is I leave for you to discover, but the search for this item leads to lots of sailing, battles full of clanging swords, and plenty of comedic moments. Turner soon becomes involved, of course, as he and Sparrow team up to defeat the nefarious Barbossa and rescue the beautiful Elizabeth in the process. As for the curse, it turns out that all of the pirates onboard the Black Pearl suffer a curious affliction involving rotting flesh and gleaming bone. They're dead, in short, but kept alive to roam the high seas for all eternity unless they can lift the curse.

""Pirates of the Caribbean"" languishes under what I consider one serious flaw, namely the length of the film. Good god this is a long movie! I don't mind watching lengthy films, but give me a break! This sucker rolls on forever, far longer than is necessary to get the job done. Worse, I kept hearing cues that seemed to hint that the movie was winding down only to hear the music launch into another series of soaring crescendos followed by more scenes. I threatened to break my watch if time didn't start moving faster. I'm extraordinarily pleased to see other people complaining about the runtime since I suspected I was the only one who thought the film needed some serious editing. Aside from the totally unnecessary two plus hours of high seas hijinks, most everything else worked well. The set pieces looked convincing, the acting was quite good, and the effects showing the crew of the Black Pearl morphing into their true undead forms very nearly redeems the overabundant use of CGI in most films today. Without Johnny Depp's totally outrageous Jack Sparrow, however, the movie would have foundered. He truly is as awesome as you've heard. The filmmakers are nuts if they don't greatly expand his role in the upcoming sequels. I won't watch them unless Depp gets more face time.

If you thought the movie was long, wait until you start watching the DVD supplements. The sheer number of extras included on the second disc boggles the mind. The commentary tracks alone, three of them, will keep you up so long you'll need to take a nap in Davey Jones's locker to recover. I say give ""Pirates"" a whirl if you haven't seen it if for no other reason than Johnny Depp. If you've got a short attention span, however, this movie may prove daunting in the extreme.",1114473600,,5447,4.700523560209424

Over all I would say that if you DON'T own this film, than getting the UMD version is good for some Jack Sparrow on the go. For twenty bucks they should have come with two UMD's so that you could get the features on another disc.  There are definetly alot of value issues to work out on this format.

1490733,1,B00005JM5E,"I love pirates and tales of adventure, so I was looking forward to watching this movie.  But it turns out, unfortunately, that this is a typical Disney movie, with the typical Disney humor.  Complete with the two stupid bad guys, the dumb British old guy plus (new & improved!) the dumb British young guy, flawlessly beautiful, haughty heroine, and Orlando Bloom as the hero.  I couldn't help laughing aloud to see that scrawny Bloom playing the part of a blacksmith's apprentice - !  The fact that the heroine gets stranded on a deserted island with a drunk pirate captain and presumably manages to avoid being raped also bothered me.  It seems to me that the movie makers were most interested in the horror aspect of the film, which was interesting but totally sensational and, I thought, redundant.

  Johnny Depp's performance was great, of course, but it couldn't save the movie.  The soundtrack is very enjoyable.  I'd rather listen to it than watch the movie.",1114041600,7,966,4.835365853658536

  They should have given some other nods for their acting like Best Supporting Actor for either Gefforey Rush or Orlando Bloom(but he'll probably get the Best Actor nod for the upcoming ""Kingdom of Heaven"" if it does well), or Keria Knightley for Best Supporting Actress(mabye she'll get a nod for ""The Jacket"").

  I was actually scared before I saw this movie(because of the skeletons), but when I first saw it, I actually had to admit that I liked it. So much, I saw it three times before getting the dvd. I recommend this to any one who love pirates in general and to any one who just wants a sense of adventure.

Pirates of the Caribbean is a movie not to be missed from the moment you strap onto this thrill ride until the very end. It is a movie that faithfully follows the pirate monopoly during that time period, all the while making fun of it in the worst way! Who would have thought that a mere ride of Disney's could have spawned such a movie! Certanly not the average person.

Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightly and Geoffry Rush follow closely on the heels of Johnny Depp playing the dapper, swaggering Jack Sparrow. A man who a few years hence had been marooned on a desert island when a mutiny led by his first mate erupted. Jack recieved a pistol with one bullet, ""To end his misery."" Fortunatly for us, there was no need for Sparrow to have such use for his Pistol.

He escapes and ends up on a british ruled island whose commander is dead set on routing out all pirates from the southern seas. And he does not take kindly to the untimely appearence of Jack. Enter Orlando Bloom, who is a lovesick apprentice and is swooning over the governers daughter. Keira Knightly. Bloom and Depp meet and from that moment forth you have the movie layed out for you. What occures and transpires will leave you laughing and gasping for breath. As the trills and humor come thick and fast. The music is awesome, and the CGI is pretty cool.

God bless Johnny Depp, for without him ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" would be just another empty big budget studio extravaganza - juvenile, bloated and over-reliant on stunt work and special effects.  But thanks to Depp's brave and witty performance, the film rises above its own inherent weaknesses to become at least a halfway entertaining picture.  He is the real treasure here.

""Inspired"" - if one dares use so lofty a term - by the Disney theme park attraction of the same name, ""Pirates"" takes us to the never-never land of swashbuckling heroes and shiver-me-timbers foolishness.  Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate who was left for dead on an island by his mutinous crew.  Sparrow, captain of the legendary Black Pearl, a ship with the reputation for possessing evil, unearthly powers, has now returned from his exile and is ready to exact revenge on the mates who abandoned him.  There's really no point in thrashing out the complicated but essentially simpleminded plot here.  Suffice it to say that it involves a diabolical curse, a literal ghost ship with a literal skeleton crew, a feisty damsel-in-distress and enough repetitive swordplay and ""avast me, hardy"" dialogue to keep the action adventure crowd purring with contentment.

For all the care that has gone into the look of the film - the costumes, set design and computer-generated special effects - ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" would sink pretty quickly were it not for Depp giving his all to keep it afloat.  His lisping, flamboyant, over-the-top approach to the character is exactly what this stale little tale needs to lift it above the ordinary.  One has only to see Depp mincing around - where anyone else in the part would have been swaggering - to verify what we have known all along about Depp as an actor, which is that he is willing to take risks and explore different avenues when tackling a role, even one as lightweight and insubstantial as this one.  He turns what could have been a mere walk-through, check-cashing part into an inspired comic turn.  One can only imagine what a boring movie this would have been without him.  For, indeed, the story itself is silly and the other characters (except for Geoffrey Rush`s evil Captain Barbossa) stiff, dull and uninteresting.  But Depp is the real deal, and all I can say is that I hope he received a large percentage of the film`s phenomenal box office booty.

When he faints she takes it. BIG MISTAKE! That gold happened to be the last of the Aztec gold needed to life the curse of the pirates. The curse basically allows them never to die. Sounds good?

He's a bit swishy, a lot irreverent, and very very funny. Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa is also a scene stealer and Orlando Bloom and Jack Davenport counter with great stick-up-their-butts characterizations.  While I wasn't that impressed with newcomer Keira Knightly, (her voice and diction aren't the greatest, and the little singing she did with Jack on the island was like nails on a chalk board), she did have great chemistry with the other castmembers.

The movie is huge, and I had wondered how well it would translate from big screen to television, especially during the epic galleon-to-galleon sea battles, but it does very well indeed. The sword fighting and stunts are exciting and believable and the entire look and feel of the film have both the kids and the adults shrieking with delight.

I know it's supposed to be based on the Disney attraction, but anyone who hasn't been on the ride need not worry.  Anyone will be able to appreciate it.

The bonus features of the dvd are great, and there's a lot of them, plenty of interviews and behind the scenes features.  My favorites are the diaries, especially the one for the ship, the Lady Washington, which was sailed from Long Beach, CA., to the Carribean where the they needed her for filming.  She was overhauled and revamped to look like the military vessels of the time, and she plays the Dauntless in the film. I also liked the blooper reel.

The plot line is fun and imaginative, the writing well done, the special effects are wonderful, but the real reason this film works is the casting. Every actor does a fine job with his/her role, in particular Geoffrey Rush, but the instant Johnny Depp sails on screen, you're hooked into it. His swaggering performance was over-the-top, campy, and just absolutely perfect for the film. He was truly the heart and soul of the picture, and just may have given the best performance of his career. The only thing wrong with the movie to me, the climactic sword fight between Barbossa and Capt. Sparrow seemed a bit long and drawn out, but that's a minor quibble in an otherwise fine film. Is it the best film of the year? No. Is it memorable? Certainly. It's fun to think that pirate movies, once the heart of Hollywood action long dead, are now back in favor and more are planned.

He didn't want to be in the public's eye at all times. So, he did bizarre movies and pulled his role off brillantly. When I saw the movie i understood why he did it, but was very upset by what happened as a result of his performance. And the movie is not really THAT good, come on.

1490949,4,B00005JM5E,"Unlike some films ('The Musketeer,' 'Godzilla,' 'Solaris,' etc.) from not so long ago, Walt Disney's PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL is not a disappointment to the expectations of its genre. Quite the contrary; it is a high-sea swashbuckling spectacle that truly entertains.

A vessel of Her Majesty's Royal Navy - navigating through murky waters near South America - stumbles upon a boy (William Turner) with a mysterious medallion. Nothing is made of that, until eight years later, when a pirate ship ventures into the harbor of Port Royal, an island outpost in the Caribbean Sea. Its crew disembarks and blasts its way into town, shooting, knifing, searching. Repossessing the medallion leads to kidnapping the governor's daughter Elizabeth (who has kept secret charge of it since its discovery) . . . and the now-grown Will Turner joins forces with swaggering pirate ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow to rescue the girl ... and settle an old score.

Johnny Depp pulls down a distinguished performance (for which he received an Academy Award nomination) as the comedic Jack Sparrow, a conveniently-underestimated pirate and victim of a mutiny led by his former first mate, Barbosa. Sparrow's only real cinematic flaw is an overreliance on mascara. The people and story assert that the pirate code consists more of `guidelines' than rules to be followed; we are left to wonder why Barbosa's offscreen mutiny is appealed to as some kind of actual wrong (""it wasn't right with the code"") when that code only sets out guidelines. Though not a major set-back, one might imagine that the response of the British officers toward certain persons' actions (toward the movie's end) feels a bit unrealistic, almost as though the filmmakers felt pushed by the need to wrap things up in light of the encroaching 150-minute mark and so force the persons in question to behave and react contrary to character. If the film has any further moviemaking weakness, it is (as perhaps hinted above) that it feels slightly drawn out, and is somewhat lacking in the kind of heart that made THE MASK OF ZORRO and THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO notably `passionate' presentations. In those respects, PIRATES doesn't seem great enough to qualify for epic status; though it is a much further cry from the disaster that some were expecting.

That this is a `family' film seems disputable. While Disney has long been known as a manufacturer of family entertainment, here the violence - while not actually gory - may be a little too severe and explicit for very young children. Carousing fills in the context of a scene or two. Also, due to a deadly curse, a crew of pirates is cast as a company of unsightly decomposing (and nonetheless `living') skeletons in the pale moonlight. To visualize the movie as another regular PG-13 action-adventure flick would impart a more accurate understanding.

With clashes of swordfighting, commandeering, blossoming romance, piracy and heroism, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN takes you on an enjoyable ride.

There is no need for a saving grace, as this is one of the best movies to come out, EVER! Boring, dumb? Yeah if you are a loser who is so badly into special effects like the Matrix that you are so close-minded about every other movie. Matrix is a great movie btw, but anyways...to be totally ignorant would be to say that the acting and writing sucks. What kind of movie-goer are you? You have no place to say in the matter, as your taste in movies is total garbage. Orlando Bloom is a great actor in this movie but Johnny Depp steals the show.

People go to watch this movie simply because they are intelligent movie-goers unlike n bruce. they have good taste in movies. oh yeah you can just assume that people only like it because there are hot characters and that's it. You don't KNOW a thing, you only think you do. Frankly YOU are the one that is a shallow poop head. And a hypocrite as well, I know for a fact that you believe Kiera is the only good one simply because you believe she is hot (and true, she definitely is) People went to see this movie because it's a great movie, so deal with that fact like a man.

You just do not seem to get it through your thick brainless skull, n bruce, that this movie DOES have substance no matter what you say. Yeah and you say people who like this movie are dumb, that's a definite example of the pot calling the kettle black. You should take a look in the mirror yourself but it would probably crack from the overloading waves of utter stupidity.

If you are a complete moronic waste of movie-goer space like n bruce you will not like this movie and create reviews about it when your opinion isn't really worth beans to begin with. People like n bruce do not deserve to go to movies, or to procreate either.

1491024,5,B00005JM5E,"Upon my first viewing, I was surprised as to how good it was. A humorous, action-packed pirate movie that had everything work out just fine. And Johnny Depp... is there anything he can't do? The man's a gifted actor and this movie only adds more credibility under his name. Orlando Bloom's acting wasn't too shabby as well, although I thought of his character as a bit annoying. The lovely Keira Knightley has since then become famous due to this movie. Job well done for her, although her character came off a bit annoying as well. And let's not forget Geoffrey Rush, yet another talented actor. I wonder how he landed this role... no matter, because the man also did a fine job.

The special-effects reminded me of how both recent ""Mummy"" movies were. And acting with no characters around isn't anything new. Remember when Brendan Fraser did that in the first ""Mummy"" movie? The pirates' CGI desings also looked similar to the mummies. And of course, the pirates' silly personalitites are seemingly similar to the mummies. Unfortunately, the pirates triumphed over the mummies.

Looking at ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" now, I now noticed how similar the movie was to ""The Mummy"" or for that matter, ""The Mummy Returns."" The heroes in both flicks are kinda silly but still good-looking men for girls to drool over. The heroes in both movies have to rescue a ""damsel in distress,"" thwart evil and rotting henchmen, and put an end to a curse. The only difference? A small love triangle that formed for a while in ""Pirates,"" but seems unnoticable to most viewers.

But does anyone give a care? Heck no! ""Pirates"" was better than one expected it to be. Though it may seem a bit too long, ""Pirates"" is a movie that you'll sit through and keep you entertained.

The DVDs features are also for those hardcore DVD enthusiasts. Cast and crew interviews, behind-the-scenes, etc., etc. All there to keep one interested in how ""Pirates"" came to be.

So sit back with a bottle of rum (or some other substitute drink) and enjoy the hit blockbuster ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.""",1101168000,2,2090,4.746556473829201

1491027,4,B00005JM5E,"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003). Walt Disney Pictures. Rated PG-13. DVD Running Time: 2 hours, 22 mins.
Directed by Gore Verbinski.

 The original review of November 10, 2004 has been changed  and updated on January 25, 2012 and February 16, 2018.

 Movie is based upon the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" amusement ride at Disneyland, Anaheim, California. Its Grand Opening was on March 18, 1967. The ride has made many modern changes and improvements since then. They even had a model of Johnny Depp as ""Jack Sparrow"" in 2008.  On special occasions, Johnny Depp himself has stood in as ""Jack Sparrow"" to surprise the guests on the ride.
  A little girl, Elizabeth Swann (Lucinda Dryzek) is aboard a ship. They come across a boy (Dylan Smith) on a piece of wooden debris that is floating like a raft and rescue him. His name is William Taylor. Up ahead is the burning ship. Pirates have attacked. The girl examines a gold medallion with a skull in the center.
 Now years later, Elizabeth is a woman (Keira Knightley). She still has the medallion and wears it as a necklace. William (Orlando Bloom) comes to visit Mr. Swann (Jonathan Pryce), Elizabeth's father, and shows him a fine sword. William sets his eyes on Elizabeth.
  Meanwhile, we are introduced to pirate, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) who just arrived at Port Royal. He is in search of The Black Pearl, a ship with black sails and is currently mastered by someone evil, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush).

After the end credits, there is one more scene.

1491029,4,B00005JM5E,"I love this movie, and the DVD is its own treasure, with all of the extras.  So why the pain?  Because, in order to get the Lost Disc, you have to purchase the entire thing all over again, which is an unnecessary expense to the many who already have the 2-Disc Collectors Edition.  I'm not sure if the good folks at Buena Vista considered how this will result in many of the original 2-Discers ending up in a lot of Used DVD bins.  Normally, that would be fine, but the people who are going to want the 2-Discer (as opposed to the Single Disc, Just-The-Movie edition) are going to be the obsessive extras collectors who will therefore want the Lost Disc.

The Lost Disc extras are great, but would it not have been at least a bit more convenient to put out the Lost Disc as a single component?",1099440000,5,793,4.295302013422819

For a movie based off of a themepark ride this is a marvel. I don't think that anyone expected it, but this movie was the blockbuster of the year! It's gripping, interesting, funny, scary, has great fighting, great acting and some of the most flawless CGI FX anyone has ever see- so why three stars out of five? Simply because I doomed myself. I hate this movie now, the only thing that keeps me from giving it one star is the memory of how delightful it really is. Why can't I stand it when I used to adore it you ask? It's easy, it happens to everybody one day or another: You have a movie you can't get enough of, you watch it so many times that soon you've memorized the movie- but you just keep watching it anyway! Soon you become tired of it and while everyone else is still in love with it you can't bear the mere mention of it. I did this to myself, unfortunately and I call out a warning to the world: Watch this in moderation or else all love you had for it will be wrung dry. Save it for special occasions when you want something just perfect to watch, that will help engender a feeling of it being brand new again.

1491031,5,B00005JM5E,"Let me first of all address one of the things that is misleading in the list of special features. Fans of Keira Knightley and Jack Davenport who may be excited to listen to a full-length feature commentary by the two English stars will be disappointed. Much like the DVD `The Girl Next Door' which promises an audio commentary from Elisha Cuthbert  and Emile Hirsch, what we have here instead is several scenes in which the two actors comment - though at least with Pirates of the Caribbean the two actors were obviously recorded together and the selection of scenes is more extensive.

Okay, now onto discussion of the movie itself - and what a fun ride it is (unlike the rather ho-hum DisneyWorld ride from which it takes its name and reportedly inspiration). Stealing the show and dominating every scene in which they appear is Johnny Depp as Capt. Jack Sparrow and Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, what we have is possibly the best pirate movie since such productions were in their heyday with such fun filled swashbucklers as `The Crimson Pirate.' Forget more recent pretenders such as `Cutthroat Island' and the truly terrible Matthau vehicle `Pirates', this movie shows that Hollywood can still assemble a good cast and spin a pirate yarn that is both enjoyable, thrilling and well written.

The plot concerns the effort by Depp's character to recapture his former ship The Black Pearl from his former shipmate and mutineer Capt. Barbossa. The curse of the title involves Barbossa and his crew being in a perpetual state of undead (cue some pretty nifty special effects) and new meaning to the term `skeleton crew.' Barbossa seems understandably anxious to rid himself of the curse (though why I am not so sure since it certainly gives him and his crew an edge in battle) and searches for a doubloon necklace that hangs around the neck of the beautiful Governors daughter Elizabeth Swann (Knightley).

One thing that did surprise me is that Depp does not play the romantic lead in this movie, deferring that part instead to Orlando Bloom as blacksmith Will Turner who vies for Elizabeth's affection with the Jack Davenports snobbish Cmdr. Norrington. Of course there are no prizes for guessing who will win out in the end.

One reviewer commented on the movie playing out like a wild Halloween party on the high seas. While this is true of many of the scenes in this movie there are some quiet moments and more traditional action movie moments to imbue this flick with a comfortable sense of familiarity for any of those who grew up watching the pirate adventures of yesteryear on Saturday afternoon television. It's a great ride and wonderful news that a sequel is currently in the works.

Although a three-disc edition of this movie is upcoming in November I opted for this 2-disc set and was mightily impressed by the special features. Aside from the slight disappointment noted at the beginning of this review, I relished the extensive background into the history of pirates. As a person longtime fascinated with the role of these high seas rogues I found the information both fascinating and enjoyable.

I also quite liked the 40-minute making of... documentary that included interviews with most of the principal actors (yes including Knightley) and a look at how many of the visual effects and computer effects were created. Together with a selection of deleted and extended scenes and blooper reel, the decision on if to purchase this or wait for the 3-disc set is purely a judgement call on how many features you want. But I can vouch that this 2-disc set will leave you truly satisfied - aside from the Knightley/Davenport commentary.",1099008000,9,3645,4.869354838709677

1491123,3,B00005JM5E,"This film despite it's astronomical box office grosses is an average picture.  It's not a bad picture just not a particularly great one.  What redeems this film is the acting of the principle performances particularly Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow.  Depp is one of those rare performers who can appear in an average vehicle and make it seem more than average.  The swagger and comic nuances of his character make it obvious as to why he FINALLY received an Oscar nomination.  Keira Knightley and Geoffrey Rush also give stand-out performances here.  Orlando Bloom is the only principle actor who does not leave an impression.  It leads one to believe that essentially he's just this month's pretty boy who is fortunate enough to appear in some high-profile films (""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, ""Troy).  Why do I say this film is just average?  The story is mundane.  The special effects are nice but if they don't enhance the story, so what?  Basically, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is the flavor of the month.  If you don't believe me, see how this film ranks in the public's subconscious in about five years.

1491124,5,B00005JM5E,"Based on the popular ride of the same name at Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer (""The Rock"" ""Con Air"", ""Top Gun"", ""Pearl Harbor"", ""Remember The Titans"", TV's ""CSI"", ""CSI: Miami"", ""CSI: New York"", etc) who knows a thing or two about making a kids film with plenty of action, suspense and special effects. This movie is no exception. With a strong script written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (""Aladdin"", ""Godzilla"", ""The Mask Of Zorro"", etc.), this film is PACKED with action, romance and adventure. GREAT film. Keira Knightley (""Bend It Like Beckham"", ""King Arthur"" [also produced by Jerry Bruckheimer], etc.) dazzles as Elizabeth Swann, the woman loved by William Turner, a young blacksmith with a mysterious past (an excellent Orlando Bloom, ""Troy"", ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy, etc.) and Commodore Norrington (a terrific Jack Davenport). Excellent music by Klaus Badelt (""Catwoman"", etc), star peformances by all and awesome special effects. Why'd the MPAA rate this excellent adventure movie PG-13? Only reason I can think of is so that it'll attract teenagers like myself. Adding 5.1 DTS Surround Sound was an inspired choice, because you can experience the picture in all its original theatrical glory (the movie grossed about $601 million; not bad for a Disney film). Disney is at the top of their game in this movie. Hope work on ""Pirates Of The Caribbean 2"" starts soon, 'cause I'm lookin' forward to a sequel to this adventure on the high seas. This is a movie for the whole family, though some images MAY prove frightening for children as young as 2. Directed by Gore Verbanski. Rated PG for violence.",1097712000,,1697,5.0
1491125,5,B00005JM5E,"If you've ever been to Disneyworld, you've probably been on the ride Pirates of the Caribbean because this ride is one of the most popular rides in Disneyworld.  And one of the most popular movies out now is based on this ride, The Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.  Its twisted plot, excellent actors, and awesome special effects will keep you watching, and then rewind it to watch it again.

 In the movie, a famous pirate, Jack Sparrow (played by Johnny Depp) travels around trying to get his ship, the Black Pearl, back but he runs into some trouble along the way.  The Black Pearl has been taken over by some haunted pirates, who are stuck between the living and the dead.  They need to collect all of the blood of the pirates and the Aztec gold coins to break their curse.  Elizabeth Swann (played by Kiera Knightley) is the owner of this last coin; she took it from William Turner when they rescued him from the ocean when they were only children.  The pirates have come to invade Elizabeth's town, and captured her to get the coin back.  Will and Jack team up with Jacks inexperienced crew, to rescue her and the ship.  They have to find the ship and battle against the pirates to get the ship back and save Elizabeth.  Will they succeed?

 The actors in the movie do a great job of depicting their characters.  Johnny Depp does an excellent job of depicting his character, acting as a drunken pirate throughout the movie.  He definitely does a good job in adding some humor to this action movie.  Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly also do a great job acting in the movie also.  Orlando has some awesome fighting scenes with swords, and skilled maneuvering.  All the actors in this movie seem so real, like they were living in the same era as the pirates were.

 The special effects and costumes were part of the reason why the movie was such a hit.  Johnny Depp looked like a real pirate because of his great costumes, hair, and makeup throughout the movie.  Also, Kiera Knighltey and Orland Bloom had interesting costumes to make them look like they were really in that era.  Besides the costume and makeup, the special effects is another reason why this movie was so realistic and made it such a big hit.  There are a lot of computerized effects in this movie, like the pirates that look like skeletons, or some of the fight scenes that were computerized.  There are so much unrealistic things in this movie that get your attention and make this movie a fun movie to watch.

 This, in my opinion, is one of the greatest movies of the whole year.  I loved watching it because it caught my attention throughout the whole movie.  The movie had many famous actors in it, like Johhny Depp, Kiera Knightley, and Orlando Bloom.  Johhny Depp was a great actor throughout the whole movie, and I couldn't get over how realistic he seemed.  He was like a real pirate, without a care in the world.  I also loved the special effects, its part of what keeps your attention to the movie.  If you're in for an action packed movie, with a comedic flair to it, I suggest that you go see Pirates of the Caribbean.  Your eyes will be glued to the screen the whole time.",1097452800,,3181,4.484320557491289
1491126,5,B00005JM5E,"As everyone Knows this Pirates of the Carribbean movie was based on the rides at Disney World and Disney Land but as silly as that sounds this movie is actually pretty good and the cast of Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley is top notch and I highly recommend this movie and I hope that the planned for sequels are just as good and that they can find a way to bring back Geoffrey Rush as Balbosa.",1096502400,,423,4.3
1491127,5,B00005JM5E,"""I am interested in entertaining people, in bringing pleasure, particularly laughter, to others, rather than being concerned with 'expressing' myself with obscure creative impressions,"" stated Walt Disney.  This movie definitely does exactly what Disney wanted.  It is entertaining for people of all ages.  ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" has been with Disney for many years, but it was finally made into a movie.  They hit the jackpot with Pirates of the Caribbean.  Every detail is flawless, which makes this movie the great success it is now.

 There is nothing like all the special effects in this movie.  With every cursed pirate, the animators had to make sure that each one was just bones in the moon light.  Having around fifty or more people to create a skeleton body for was a major task in itself.  Even the boats are magnificent because all the little details to make it look like the time setting.  The tattered Black Pearl ship was even a great task because you never see a ""dead"" ship.  All of the fight scenes were well choreographed. I never expected them to be that great.  Even the one secret cloud that the director put in one fight scene made a smile come to my face because I did not expect it.

 Not only were the effects great, but the characters made it so interesting.  There is the heroic boy that is in love with a lady out of his rank.  The damsel in distress is sweet and girly but she can and will fight, which makes it, feel good to know that women did fight back at the time.  And there is always the humorous hero of the story, which I never wanted his scenes to end.  By having such interesting characters already, the director had to pick the right people to play the parts and he did.  Orlando Bloom brings so much passion to every character he plays, but this one, I think, was his greatest role so far in his young career.  Bloom's performance almost convinced me that he was in love with Keira Knightley.  Knightley was an excellent damsel in distress, but her passion in the fight scenes she was in, made her a much greater distressed damsel.  Fighting back not only put her on the top of my list, but she would actually do everything, and made it funny at the same time.  How can anyone forget Johnny Depp.  He brings so much life and humor to this story that you can not believe.  His drunken walk and presence already gets you laughing from the first time he appears on the screen, but every line that Depp must say makes his character an unforgettable one.  He brings his character and everyone else's character to life and makes it all seem like it is a true story.  The whole cast was incredible and will do great in the sequel.

 The plot of Pirates of the Caribbean had so many twists that it keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end.  Every new twist makes the movie move faster, even if you don't want it to end.  However, by the end of the movie every little twist comes together to make a great storyline and movie.

 All in all, this movie was one of the greatest I have seen in a long time.  I will be sharing it with my kids when I have a family.  No one should miss an opportunity to see this excellent movie.  It is pleasing for all ages and has everything from romance to horror in the movie.  This is an old tale that has been turned into something so great.  Pirates of the Caribbean is probably one of the greatest movies of our time.",1096416000,,3399,4.3776
1491128,5,B00005JM5E,"Growing up as a kid I had to been to Disney World many times with my family.  The Pirates of the Caribbean ride was one of my favorite rides.  You get in these little row boats and it takes you through this journey of a night in the wild Caribbean in the time of the pirates.  So of course, when I heard about this movie coming out I knew I had to see it.  Not to mention that Orlando Bloom is probably one of the hottest men alive and since the time period was appropriate all the actors used their natural British accents!  The music is so neat; it works so well with the picture and the order of the events.  As the movie went on all of the elements from the ride at Disney World were taken and put right into the movie.  It was almost like you were back on the ride at Disney World.  I was absolutely amazed how well they took these scenes out of the ride and put them right into the movie.

Filmed on location in the sunny Caribbean, the overall story line obviously went far past the ride though.  The movie starts out as a flash back that Elizabeth Swan is having about the first time she ever encountered pirates which sparks her fascination from then on.  As the story unfolds, the unfortunate Captain Jack Sparrow (played by the amazing Johnny Depp) who was marooned on an abandoned island by his crew of enchanted friends and fellow pirates.  The story continues with a funny tale of a merchant worker who encounters this so called ""famous pirate"" Captain Jack Sparrow and their adventures together after each learns that they can help one another in some way.  They become friends and foe in a matter of a film.  Twisting through and before all this crazy plot is the love romance between Elizabeth Swan (played by the young Keira Knightley) , the governor's daughter, and Will ""William"" Turner (played by the gorgeous Orlando Bloom) , the merchant boy with the dark surprise that even he doesn't know about.  Jack Sparrow and William Turner have more in common then either of them ever knew about and this little bit of information helps them to both get what they both desire, treasure, of different sorts that is.  Elizabeth at a young age comes in contact with something that the Pirates of the ship the Black Pearl want; Jack Sparrow through out the movie is chasing after this dark pirate ship; Will Turner wants to be the hero of the story by capturing this pirate who is running the streets of his town and save the beautiful Elizabeth when she encounters trouble.  All of these three main characters are tied together in some way and none of them know that.  With witty lines and an enchanted character cast, including Geoffrey Rush as Barbosa, the new evil conniving captain of The Black Pearl,  this movie will having you want a piece of your own treasure to take home with you, or perhaps your own piece of Aztec Gold, just make sure you stay out of the moonlight.

This movie was one of my favorite all time movies.  I loved the cast and I thought that they played their characters each to their best, I honestly couldn't think of a better casting line.  The jokes and little things are what made this movie absolutely hilarious!  It's one of those movies that will have you watching it twice just so you can catch everything that is going on.  You will fall in love with this movie, as did I, and I can now probably recite this movie word for word without having to watch it.  Also another great thing about this movie is that they are going to be working on a Pirates 2, and that is due to come out sometime between 2005 and 2006.  I can not wait to see what is going to happen to the movie and where they are going to take it!",1096416000,,3654,4.368343195266272

1491200,5,B00005JM5E,"Pirates of the Carribean was a great, action/comedy movie back in 2003. Johnny Depp proves why he is one of the greatest actors in movies today, and shines in this movie as Captain Jack Sparrow, considered one of the worst pirates that ever lived in this story.

 The story itself is very intriguing, and throws in little twists here and there that keep the movie moving at a great pace and leads up to a great action ending. But I am getting ahead of myself. Orlando Bloom also stars as Will Turner, a young man who was found years ago when he was a boy in a shipwreck by Elizabeth Swan, Keria Knightley. Now years later, he is an ironsmith apprentice, who secretly loves Elizabeth, but cant come to say it out loud.

When a ship called the Black Pearl, considered by many to be just a myth, attacks the port that Elizabeth lives in, Elizabeth takes it to herself to demand the pirates leave. To do this she realizes the only way for the pirates to leave is to give them a mysterious gold coin that they seem to so desperately want. She gets her wish, but is also taken aboard the Black Pearl and cant escape. Will teams up with Jack Sparrow, who was in prison at the time of the attack, and they set off to rescue the lovely Elizabeth.

It turns out the pirates are actually skeletons! Cursed to wander the earth until they can return all the pieces of Aztec gold they stole years ago. That was where the gold coin comes in. Teamed up with a ragtag group of pirate friends, the two lead characters follow close behind.

The movie is great and the scenery really does look like it has come out of the ride at Disneyland. There are a lot of jokes and funny moments that never get dull. The fight scenes are great, and all three main characters have their moments in this movie. Add in some touching moments between Will and Elizabeth, and a great ending, and you get the best movie of 2003!",1094256000,,1890,4.327683615819209
1491201,5,B00005JM5E,"This movie was too well cast to be any less of a rating. Jack Sparrow, er, excuse me, CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is a down-on-his-luck, fast thinking pirate out to reclaim his ship, the Black Pearl. He bumps aground (or adock?) a Caribbean island where a British colony resides including childhood friends, Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). As children, Elizabeth helped rescue Will from the ocean but she swiped a medallion he wore around his neck in the process. The medallion, unbeknownst to Elizabeth holds many secrets for which a group of pirates will stop at nothing to own it. These just happen to be the same pirates in control of the Black Pearl under Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). Rush makes the crucial element to the movie -- a good BAD GUY -- ""I decline to acquiesce to your request... means NOOO.""

It's a true ""swashbuckling"" adventure with plenty of good lines, plot twists, and high sea battles between good and bad. The special effects are terrific as is the acting. The movie is definitely reminescent of the Disneyland ride for those wondering (if you haven't seen one or the other). Some critics did not like this movie but not all good things come in perfect, neat packages. Being a clever pirate doesn't typically fall into that category, and I enjoyed not being able to predict how the movie was going to end.",1093910400,,1379,4.794117647058823
1491202,5,B00005JM5E,"I thought this wasn't going to be that good. But, I enjoyed every minute of it. When it was over I was tempted to go see it again. Jonny Depp really surprised me. This is not his typical role.  JONNY DEPP WAS THE MOVIE! There is just no way of putting it. Orlando was good, not to mention really hot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But, he was rather wimpy in this one. If there is one thing that movies have always done right by its the music. Jonny sends you into a laugh attack with each word. The action is Great! The special effects are stunning. You just can't go wrong with this one.  My favorite part is when the pirates are walking on the bottom of the ocean.  And, then the last fight scene. And, the symbolic nature of the apple. I can't think of why anyone would not like this one.  I think the one reason Jonny is so famous in this movie is because of his first sighting. That ship sinking as he is standing on the top.  I don't care what people say, that's just classic. Then, when the cold sends off that wave.  And, it starts to get dark. That is really powerful. Then the beach scene. And, you can't forget Pola or was it posnip. Every scene was just as funny and good as the next. I won't mind being a immortal pirate.

1491203,4,B00005JM5E,"I hate the disney ride.  That said, this movie looked horrible based on the trailers. I still went to see it because I'm a big fan of Johnny's acting (he is always very into his roles and very convincing). The movie was great. It fit into the mold of pirates being treasure hungery and most drinking and having no love for government. That wasn't a problem though because its what we all grew up knowing pirates to be.",1093824000,2,418,4.358974358974359
1491204,5,B00005JM5E,"I've only been to Disneland once (and Disneyworld once) and I'm not sure if I even went on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. so I'll be one of the people becoming more interested in the amusement park after seeing the film...
I'd heard people say this was a really fun film-- and I'm in theatre with friends who are sometimes a little bit snobbish about pop culture-- so I did expect a fun, lighthearted, well-paced movie.
This was all that but so much more. First, it was extremely well cast, with characters who never sink into cliche. The British sitcom ""Coupling's"" Jack Davenport plays the Commodore who wants to marry Keira Knightly, the lovely daughter of the governor. In the wrong hands (and apparently, according to the commentary, in an earlier draft) it would be so easy to make him a jealous, swinish brute (a la Titanic). Instead he is a true antagonist with his own complex emotions and an overall nobility.
Orlando Bloom plays Will Turner, the blacksmith's apprentice found in a shipwreck by Keira Knightly and her father (played smartly by Jonathan Pryce). Geoffrey Rush as the sinister Captain Barbossa (whose mutiny gained him the ship The Black Pearl) is likable, an Irish rogue with style.
But Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow completely overwhelmed me and stole the show. Basing his somewhat effeminate, androgynous characterization on Keith Richards with a little Pepe Le Pew and a little Bugs Bunny, his pirate captain is sexy, funny, tricky and brave. He's a marvelous protagonist/antihero-- you always trust that he'll get out of danger, and that where his actions may seem treacherous, he has a larger purpose. At one point it even looked like he and Knightly would hook up! though it was probably a better choice to keep the young ingenue and leading man together. But I was bowled over-- had no idea Depp was that creative and accomplished.
But leave aside the cast, and there's still a dynamite story with an unexpected twist-- the pirates are cursed and are seeking to restore treasure, not to get it and spend it. This allows fantastic special effects (they turn into skeletons by moonlight) and a little bit of pathos (they can't taste or feel, because they're dead). But the movie keeps its silliness and light sense of humor-- the pirates are pretty stupid thugs and that makes them endearing.
The ships, forts and battles are magnificent. the DVD extras show just how much work and planning went into them and it really is impressive.
The movie is also greatly helped by one of the best action-picture scores since Star Wars. No strike that-- it IS the best score since Star Wars (the original).
This has all the joy and derring-do of any Errol Flynn, with the special effects of the 21st century.
Like the best ride at an amusement park, when it's over you just want to line up and see it again!",1093824000,2,2828,4.738336713995944
1491205,4,B00005JM5E,"When I first saw the trailer for Pirates of the Caribbean, I cringed at the thought of a movie based on an amuzement theme park ride.  I then cringed some more when I saw the ever growing popular Jerry Bruckheimer Productions logo.  ""This is going to be one of the worst films of the year"" I laughed to myself.

After seeing the huge success it gained during the summer and reading how most critics and audiences liked the movie, I finally gave in and saw it with a friend.  Well let me just say I am so glad I did!  This movie was complete fun all the way.  The sword play action was exciting, the special effects of the skeleton pirates were impressive, and Johnny Depp was fantastic as captain Jack Sparrow.  Depp's acting definitely brought in the ""fun factor"" to the screen which made the movie worth the price of the ticket alone.

I also didn't realize this movie was directed by Gore Verbinski; who expertly crafted the American remake of THE RING.  Pirates of the Caribbean is pure fun and excitement, yet there is also strong evidence of quality and talent.

Taken by itself, though, it's a pretty good hour and twenty minutes' entertainment. Johnny Depp, as Capt. Jack Sparrow, a not very prepossessing pirate, chews the scenery heroically. In fact, the Will Turner character, played in the best Errol Flynn fashion by Orlando Bloom, even remarks at one point on Capt. Jack's overacting. And Keira Knightley is a generally believable point of competition among the guys. Of course, if you know anything about ships and sailing (or about Caribbean history, or about British military and naval uniforms, or about pirates . . .), you'll have to put all your objections on hold and view this yarn the way you would a Roadrunner cartoon. I.e., it don't have to make sense, it only has to appeal to adolescent viewers.

One of the greatest things about this film is that the special effects are ultra real, especially when the moonlight exposes the dead pirates.  The DVD is wonderful, both disks.

1491443,5,B00005JM5E,"In the last thirty years any film, that had almost anything to do with 'pirates' could pretty much be labeled as a ""bomb"" among both critics and movie audiences alike. Couple that fact, with the ideal from the folks at Disney to make movies based on their theme park amusement rides and you have a recipe for a 'High Concept' disaster...right? Well, I hate to admit it, but ""Pirates of the ""Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl"" is one Summer, popcorn munching film, that I totally loved!! As the title suggests the story takes place among the 18th century Caribbean islands and the open seas. A somewhat loopey pirate, Capt. Jack Sparrow (a brilliant Johnny Depp) is searching for his former ship,'the Black Pearl' and the evil pirate crew, that now helms it. Now, under the leadership of the villainous, Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), the pirates have a problem of their own. Apparently, in the past, they had stolen ancient Aztec gold treasure and now they are ""cursed"" with a hellish existance of being neither ""alive or dead"". The only way to remove the curse is to collect up and return all the treasure, while spilling the blood of a descendant of a now dead crew mate, 'Boots Strap Turner'. They believe this comes in the form of a beautiful young women named Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley), who they have gone to great lengths to kidnap. This convoluted tale sounds like something out of a comic book or bad pulp novel. But does it work? You Betcha!! This is a fast moving story that keeps you constantly guessing and is filled with witty, quotable dialogue (""You better start believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner because... your in one!""). Director, Gore Verbinski has created an immensly enjoyable film. The movie steals all those old pirate cliches from every old Erol Flynn film you've ever seen and somehow turns it into a fresh and exciting piece of action entertainment. It combines adventure, humor, suspense and even a bit of horror. The closest thing I can compare it to is Speilberg's ""Indiana Jones"" film series. Everything is done just right in this movie. Dariusz Wolski's cinematography is both ominous and beautiful. The wonderful music score by Klaus Bedelt gives the film an almost majestic feeling, that adds to the adventure. The sword fights and the stunt work are great ""show stoppers"" and can only be rivaled by the work in Richard Lester's 'Three Musketeer' movies. The special effects are totally eye popping (love those skeleton pirates!) without overwhelming the story. But the thing that really makes this film special is the perfect casting and top notch acting performances. Johnny Depp (in an Oscar nominated performance) really holds this film together with his comical portrayl of Capt. Jack Sparrow. In subsequent interviews he has admitted that he based the character on modern day pirate & rock star, Keith Richards!! Not to be out done, Actor, Geoffrey Rush really chews on the scenery and gives us a great over the top performance as the Black Pearl's evil, Captain Barbossa. He can really scare the boots off you! Finally their is Actress Keira Knightley, who gives a 'star in the making performance' as Elizabeth a 'damsel in distress', who turns out can hold her own against the villainous pirates. I love the spunk and determination, that her character shows. The DVD to this film is crisp & clear in both picture and sound. The two disc set is loaded with tons of extras on the 'making of the film'. If you are in the mood for some plain old fun, film entertainment, then I would highly recommend ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl""!",1090368000,2,3610,4.824193548387097

However, I am an expert on ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", the ride at Disney Land.  Usually, I will ride it 6-7 times when I'm visiting the park.  So, you can understand how I was more than a little excited that my favorite ride was becoming a movie.
Sadly, what I got was little more than a meager bone thrown my way.  Director Gore Vidal has taken a stunning experience, and added useless new characters and plot, showing situations that were never in the original ride.  What's more, the classic ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" song is hardly heard at all here.  It's heard throughout the ENTIRE ride, Gore.
If you're in the mood for a pirate movie, I guess this is the place to come (although don't overlook the underrated ""Pirate Movie"" from the early 80s).  If you're looking for the ride captured on film, better just save your money and buy a ticket to Disney Land.  (or World)",1089849600,2,989,4.5423728813559325

This was especially apparent in the beautiful soundscapes, sweeping visual effects, and good storytelling with intriguing characters.  This was mainly a film of visual intrigue.  Port Royal (I beleive it's called) is just beautiful... both magical yet authentic in design, and I can see that care was taken in achieving authenticity of the time period in all aspects of the film.  Aethetics held up superbly
Regardless of what anybody says, Johnny Depp IS Capt Jack Sparrow...it's in his blood.  Very comical yet serious and sometimes delusional, and brave yet a coward at times... perfect execution of the role down to the ""T"".  Keira Knightley also very talented and well fitting for her role.... very beautiful I might add, almost enchating in a way like Johnny Depp's character.  Orlando Bloom's dialogue seemed a bit stale and reminiscent of his Legolas role, however he was well-suited for his role as Will Turner as well.

1491660,5,B00005JM5E,"I never saw the theme park rendition of this gorgeous movie, but I guess it's safe to say it is a massive treat for all ages. And it's also safe to say The Pirates of the Caribbean is faithful to its original theme. And what an adaptation it is...

  Anybody going to this movie for a history lesson would do better to watch the History Channel. Make no mistake. This is a straight-laced, on your face, bang on entertainment. The story is simple but rivetting. A mystical, near legend, pirate ship called the Black Pearl is out retrieving the Aztec gold it scattered across the vast expanses of the Caribbean. Any mortal soul who picks even a single gold corset from the cursed stone chest, will be damned for all eternity, only able to show his true undead form in moonlight. If all of the 882 gold corsets are replaced in the stone chest, the curse will be lifted. The pirates restore all of them except one. Where is it?. Who has it?.... And how to get it?.

  This preamble alone should give you an idea of what is in store for you in this movie. Betrayal, revenge, love and action are seamlessly blended to make The Pirates of the Caribbean a must watch. And if that is not enough, then watch the stars in action..(or acting!). Jonny Depp, as the rogue pirate Jack Sparrow, will amaze you with his acting repertoire. Along with Sean penn, he is probably the finest actor of  his generation. I don't know how much he moulded his character in the lines of Keith Richards, but it truly is one-of-a-kind. Depp's character is rather a cross between an evangelist and a gender confused woman. His gait itself will make you laugh and oh yes, his dialogues are the best in the movie. Geoffrey Rush as the double-crossing first-mate Captain Barbossa is an equal match to Depps multi-layered persona. Make no mistake. These two protagonists alone would see the movie through in equal measure.  The lovely Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann, Orlando Bloom as the love-struck Will Turner, Johnathan Pryce as Governor Swann of Port Royale and Jack Davenport as Commodore Norrington more than add quality acting to the movie. Disney has done well to renounce too much gore and make the movie available for all age groups. Apart from a popping eye (hilarious stuff!), nothing else in the movie could be termed by anyone as more than an 'uggh'....
  Director Gore Verbinski has started off from where he left with Mouse Hunt. Both the movies are a tribute to Verbinski's versatality as a 'people's director'. The special effects are astounding and the undead form of the pirates is rendered to the last detail. The music is witty and refreshingly upbeat, keeping with the tempo of the movie. And the movie dialogues are humorous and creative.
  This movie will no doubt spawn a sequel and guys like me only hope that the original cast would remain untouched. Afterall, how do you expect others to beat the tone and expression of Depp when he says ""But why is the rum gone?...""",1086998400,3,2965,4.637404580152672

The plot may be fairly thin (was it really a shock to find out that Barbossa was the traitorous first mate?) but this is an action/adventure movie, not a drama, so the hell with the plot.  Geoffrey Rush shows why he has an Oscar.  The man can play a great villain.  Orlando Bloom is beginning to show signs of typecasting (although he's not an elf in this movie, he is an action-oriented character like Legolas) but he's a decent action star, so maybe he should run with that.  Certainly is a better actor then that lump of uncharasmatic mud, Vin Diesel.  Jonathan Pryce is one of my favorite character actors and he is great in this film as well.  My only complaint is the talentless Keira Knightley.  Her only claim to fame was looking enough like Natalie Portman to be cast as her double in Star Wars Episode I.  Why the filmmakers decided that her limited screen time in that movie deserved to be turned into an extensive film career I have NO idea.  I was hoping her character would die during the movie to nix any chance of her appearing in a sequel, but alas, it was not to be.  Is it just me or does the up and coming crop of actors and actresses look just absolutely pathetic?

I've never been a Johnny Depp fan, but in the role of Jack Sparrow, pirate captain, Depp's bizarre, over the top acting style fits perfectly and brings the film to life. He is fantastic, and I actually found myself hoping he would win when he was nominated for the academy award (he lost). Orlando Bloom - who made his name as the Legolas the teenage heart-throb, extreme sports elf in The Lord of the Rings - is another pretty face who does his role justice. His job is easier - playing the straight-man daring young hero - but he does it admirably. Too bad Spielberg didn't cast Bloom or Depp in Catch me If You Can, it would have been a much better movie. Another real treat in Pirates of The Caribbean is Keri Knightly, who I had never heard of and have never seen since. She is an absolute stunner and she gives a strong performance too boot. Overall a very fun, entertaining movie. It has a good pace, it isn't too predictable (even if it is a pirate move based on a Walt Disney ride) and some of the characters will break formula and surprise you from time to time. One note to parents, we bought the movie on the advice of our neighbors who have a three-year-old girl who loves it.

1491710,4,B00005JM5E,"Pirates of the Caribbean is a great movie based off a famous attraction at the California based DisneyLand.
I remember being intrigued by this attraction as a kid, but the movie held me entralled. There were some slow parts and some elements of the movie could have been expounded upon. But, as it is, the feature is a little over two hours long. Had they gone into depth on everything then we would have never left the theater.
The story begins with the finding of a young boy, floating amongst some ruble in the ocean. He is found by the daughter of the current governor of an English Province located somewhere in the Caribbean.
Will Turner can remember nothing of his rescue, but he does remember the face of Elizabeth, the governor's daughter. Over the years, his fascination grows to love. Yet, as a poor Blacksmith he knows that there will never be fruition to his desire. That is until the Black Pearl comes to coast causing death and destruction. Along this perilous journey, you meet a very drunken, and extremely hilarious, pirate by the name of Captain Jack Sparrow played by Johnny Depp. Who also recieved an Oscar nomination for the role.
The pirate ship, the Black Pearl, is hell bent, and the crew seem almost unholy in their power. What comes next is raucous, rolling adventure produced by Jerry Buckheimer. If you are familiar with the name then you should know what to expect.

It's hard to tell whether he's doing a fey take on Keith Richards or he's imitating John Belushi imitating Joe Cocker, but whatever it is he steals this one.  Honorable mention should be paid to Geoffrey Rush, who plays Barbossa, Swallow's mutinous ex-first mate and current captain of the cursed Black Pearl with great panache and brio without playing up the camp elements.
 I really enjoyed PIRATES up until the time when the governor's daughter (Keira Knightley) is captured by the mutinous crew.  Maybe it was the CG animation of the skeleton crew in the moonlight that made me lose interest, but my attention took a long walk off a short gangplank right about then.  The interminable fight and heroine-in-peril scenes that followed didn't help any, either.

To escape this curse they must return all the Cortes gold coins that they stole together with the drop of blood of an ex crew member, Bootsrap Bill Turner. However, Bill Turner is now dead and Captain Barbossa must find his child.
Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is found by the Royal Navy with one of coins strapped around his neck. The Governor's daughter Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) takes the coin from Will thinking that he's a pirate, so that he is not arrested. Elizabeth keeps the coins for 8 years, until one day she is kidnapped by Captain Barbossa. Will Turner who is now a blacksmith and in love with Elizabeth hires Captain Jack Sparrow to find Elizabeth and they commandeer a ship from the Royal Navy and set sail to find Elizabeth.
This was a fun film to watch with lots of swashbuckling sword fights and chases. The plot keeps the film ticking along at a fast pace. The actors are brilliant especially Johnny Depp whose character is larger than life. I did find his ""Keith Richards"" accent a bit annoying and it sounded too modern for the film. The scenery of the high seas and the great sailing boats are impressive. The special effect creating the skeletal like figures are very real and you can imagine them fighting the Royal Navy.

His performance pretty much steals the show although the rest of the cast are all very strong. The scenery and the costumes are wonderful and some of the scenes replicate the Disneyland ride in a very amusing way.
The biggest risk the film takes is with respect to plot. Trying to create a story from the premise of a 10 minute ride was probably quite a challenge. However the writers pull it off and the story keeps us interested until the very end.

Theres one thing I want to point out - I've read more than once that it has major 'Flaws' in it and things that don't make sense. Please someone tell me what because I see nothing? I think the problem is most people don't get why Jack Sparrow isn't a skeleton the entire way through, which means they can't have been watching it close enough when he picks up a coin half way through which turns him into one. Its not hard to figure when you think that hes going to fight Barbosa in a moment and doesn't want to die.
Aside from the people who don't get it, I think its a great Film and I can't find anything wrong with it. People speaking badly about the 'English' woman in it annoys me like mad, I think Keira Knightley is better than ANY Hollywood Actress, shes got a natural charm about her and is stunning. I think she played the English rose portrayal beautifully. I think Orlando Bloom has improved and gone from strength to strength and as for Johnny Depp -
I'm going to give him an entire paragraph. I think Johnny Depp made Jack Sparrow his own character, he completely got into it and its believable.

This comic swashbuckler was quite surprising for me. Seeing as it was named after a theme park ride, why watch it? Probably a load of crap from unimaginative screenwriters, right? Wrong.
This movie's plot revolves around the cursed pirates of the Black Pearl, doomed to sail the seas til doomsday and never to enjoy drink nor food unless they could break the curse. How to break the curse? Find over 800 pieces of Aztec gold and stain it with the blood of one single man. So let's find us the man and the gold and finish it.
The last piece of Aztec gold is held by Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), daughter of the governor of Port Royal. One dark night, she is kidnapped by the Black Pearl's crew and taken to the ship. ""What be your name, missis?"" asked the captain, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). Thinking that if she turned out not to be the governor's daughter, the pirates would leave her, she replies, ""Elizabeth... Turner, sir."" She is taken and locked in a room, even as the Black Pearl leaves Port Royal.
Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), a blacksmith that loves Elizabeth, decides to try to rescue her. He forms a wary alliance with former pirate captain of the Black Pearl, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who is the only one who knows where to find the Black Pearl. It all goes downhill from there and the laughs increase and increase.
Johnny Depp delivers a convincing performance as (""Captain!"") Jack Sparrow. He is the star of the movie, a hilarious pirate who turns out to be a (relatively) good man.
This movie is a laugh parade as Jack and Will race against the clock to save Elizabeth and get away from Port Royal navy officials. This is a must-see and I will reveal no more as the movie is truly one to be experienced by one's self.",1083283200,,1948,4.474719101123595

That is, of course, until they bankrolled this, their best live action film ever. which, co-incidentally, is also the best pirate movie ever and the funniest film of the past year.
Pirates of the Carribean is long, no question, but it's entire girth is thrust full of humour, cool action, art direction to make you bow down and worship it, and the kinds of performances to make it unforgettable.
Written by the people who wrote the script for Shrek, the dialogue is fresh, edgy, but intelligent and damn funny. Gore Verbinski directs the affair with panache and aplomb, lending each scene a kind of exotic beauty, and making great use of the aforementioned art direction, and the Hans Zimmer/Klaus Badelt score (Badelt also scored Equilibrium, trivia fans).
But the heart and soul of this film is it's cast. Johnny Depp cements his status as the greatest modern actor of the US, while Orlando Bloom continues his love affair with period (this and Lord of the Rings), he is ably supported by the ham flavoured stylings of Geoffrey Rush as the ""A-HAR!"" villain, Keira Knightley as the requisite love interest, and some other fine British talent who deserve to be in more movies.
Again, the action is too much of a good thing, but it is grandiose, epic, and doesn't lose humour in place of explosions like other movies, making you laugh and gasp by turns.
So, drink up me heartys, and set this one out to sea for one of the best times you will ever have with a Disney movie.",1083110400,,1749,4.573248407643312

The leading heroine is also great, but I found her weird/ugly mouth distracting.  It was fun to see one of my favorite Disneyland rides developed into a great story and put on fillm.  Kudos to the shots taken directly from scenes in the ride!  Not recommended for children under age 12.",1082851200,,444,4.866666666666666

The only other person to NAIL a character so well was Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday in Tombstone.  This movie will definitely become a classic.  This movie is fun from beginning to end; the way a movie should be, unless of course it's a drama or something.  Anyhow, you can't go wrong buying this flick - it deserves the five stars I just gave it.

1491868,5,B00005JM5E,"This is by far the best movie I've ever watched in my entire life.
Johnny Deep plays the amusing Jack Sparrow, who is the main highlight of the movie. He's hilarious, he's odd, and you can never tell whose side he's really on until near the end.
Kiera Knightly does well in the role of Elizabeth Swann, the governer's daughter and in the beginning, the holder of a cursed medallion that a group of pirates that can never be killed desire very much. She plays the modern girl stuck in old times, as well as the damsal in distress.
Orlando Bloom acts as Will Turner, Elizabeth's admirer. (There's one in every story) Will goes on this adventure to save his beloved Elizabeth, only to relieze that to break the curse set upon them, the evil pirates of the Black Pearl require his blood.",1082592000,,783,4.4825174825174825

Completely lifelike and breathtaking ocean views.  And who can resist Capt. Jack Sparrow played by Johnny Depp.  His black eyeliner and the spunky, flirtatious attitude kept my eyes glued and mouth drooping throughout the entire movie.  And if the scruffy pirate isn't what your into you've still got the handsome yet lovable Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) to keep you guessing.  Keira Knightley did a beautiful job of playing the part for Elizabeth Swan.  She is a wonderfull actor and I can't waiat to see her roles in upcoming blockbusters.  Overall the movie displays suspense, intrigue, horror, and a bit of romance to keep the audience in tune with what is taking place.  Myself I have never had the pleasure of going to Disney and experiencing the ride first hand but if it's anything like the movie I can't wait to give it a spin.

Far and away the best Swashbuckler to date, Disney should stay the course with ""Pirates"" and produce a sequel (or two). Simply put, this movie was (and still is) GREAT FUN!",1082073600,,372,4.651515151515151
1491911,3,B00005JM5E,"Pirates of the Caribbean is a terrible film with a brillant star.  It's formulaic plot is about as predictible as your twelth trip on the epinomious Disneyland ride.  If you have seen Treasure Island or any other pirate-themed film, you have seen Pirates of the Caribbean.  The special effects are hokey and unbelievable, the plot is thin and disjointed.  A full 45-minutes could have easily been cut from this film, which would only have made the tortured plot more quickly and mercifully forgetten.
The only gem in this mess if Johnny Depp.  He has to have been the best actor to be Oscar nominated for the worst film.  He is his normal witty, charming persona, and he is clearly having fun making the best of a bad situation.  I would not have watched this film to the end if it weren't for him.  He turns in one of his best performances in a career of outstanding roles.
Whether Johnny Depp is enough to save this film is up to you.  Without him, it would be a waste of good celloid to have produced ""Pirates"".",1081987200,4,1014,4.467391304347826
1491912,4,B00005JM5E,"Although I have always been a Disney fan, at the age of 21, I find myself to be a bit old to watch Disney movies. But when I found out that Depp was in this movie with Orlando Bloom(Legolas from the Lord of the Rings trilogy) I decided to give it a go.
I was quite surprised that although Depp always seems to play strange charectors that I soon tire of, He kept me interested throughout the whole movie. His character, Jack Sparrow, is a funny down on his luck pirate preceeded by legends of his life that are mostly untrue. He does seem a bit....off from his past adventures, but it only adds to the hilarity of the movie.
Orlando Bloom plays Will Turner, the aprentice to the blacksmith. Will was found in the middle of the ocean as a child by Miss Swan as he calls her. Elizabeth Swan is the govenors daughter that is secretly the love of Will and she also secretly feels the same.
The graphics in this movie are well done although it is quite obvious that they are computer generated. The story in this movie could have been more in depth and a little longer, however, I found the movie quite entertaining and is one that I watch over and over.",1081987200,2,1149,4.275229357798165
1491913,3,B00005JM5E,"Every now and then a movie comes out that when first watching it you may be entralled excited and in suspensful, and then at the end you ask; What happened to the movie? This is pretty much how I felt after seeing this film. I did not hate it nor did I really like it. I respect the opinions of all those people who did enjoy this film and will not attempt to put them down.
The plot is most likely apparent to everyone thus I will not go into detail about it.
The first major problem with this movie was simple; Disney was the company that produced this film. Thus many scenes like those in the pub or on the island could have beniffited from an R rating. Because this film was produced by Disney, it was obvious that there would be a happy ending. I am not really saying that all happy endings are bad, but the ending to this movie was simply much too sugary.
This movie had far too many repetitions that were irratating by the end of the movie such as the 'parler' rule in the Pirate Code or the 'They are more like guidelines' phrase. I found all of these repetitions to be horribly irratating and put into the movie to provide a comic backdrop.
Possibly the worst things about this movie were the gaping plotholes. Some other reviewers said that this film was nothing but a few action scenes put together and plot was just the afterthought, I would not be suprised if the actual movie was made like this. Amongst these plotholes and errors in logic was the Black Pearl's crew's ability to change into skelatal sepulchars. In their first appearence in the movie, which was at night, they were not skelatons but then other times when it was needed to scare the heroine they were. Furthermore in the big fight between them and the English army by the end of the scene there was not one British corpse even though the crewmembers of the Black Pearl were clearly winning the battle. And of course the movie had to include a battle scene between two people who could not die.
Johnny Depp's acting was very good and his flamboyant character was in my opinion very funny and well constructed but the good characters end there. Orlando Bloom's character was horribly boring and uninteresting. And the pirate comic releif was nothing short of terrible.
Aside from all of these problems the movie was fairly enjoyable on the first sitting.",1081900800,4,2333,4.47887323943662
1491914,1,B00005JM5E,"It's one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. Pirates of the Caribbean is very overrated.

I saw this in theaters 6 times because it was so good and I have been anxiously awaiting the DVD. People say women like this movie because of Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom, and I say true, but I love their performance, not their looks (Although they are both attractive gentlemen). Johnny is at his comedic finest and you will not stop laughing and Orlando makes you root for the good guy even harder then normal and laugh at his comments that compliment Johnny's ""uniqueness"". Geoffery Rush is phenomenal and so is the actor (I am blanking on his name, sorry sir, you were still awesome) who plays Commodore Norrington (he needs way more publicity, he was phenomenal as well)...
This is by far the best movie of the year and without a doubt deserves awards for both content and actor performance. Knowing the Oscars, it will get overlooked, not enough ""big names"" in some over the top boring movie, so my vote goes to them by buying the DVD and encouraging others to buy it as well. Nothing says ""In your face"" to those who keep getting reconized for less then deserving work then getting surpassed in sales by ""box office poison"" Johnny Depp and his 'mates.",1081728000,3,1274,4.472103004291846

I didn't see this film in the theater, but when it came out on DVD, my parents bought it so I watched it at their house. It was an amazingly fun film! Johnny Depp should've gotten the oscar for his performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. Whatever movies he's in, good or bad, Johnny Depp is always great.
Orlando Bloom, while a decent actor, is just starting his acting career. He's off to a great start actually, with The Lord of the Rings films and this film along with upcoming sequels! But his character in this film didn't seem much different than Legolas in LOTR. Sure, he looked different, and he WAS playing a different character. But his mannerisms seemed quite similar to Legolas. I think he needs to work on developing new unique characters for the films he's in. Nevertheless, he still acted good in this.
Keira Knightley was great, although I can't remember what her name was in the film(I can't remember Orlando's character's name either!). She's just such a beautiful actress. She's got the look and the acting skills down.
The story is great. The special effects are great. The sword fighting is great. This film is great.

1491980,2,B00005JM5E,"I went into this movie expecting a lot more, and as obvious from my title on the review, didn't get it.
It is a good family movie, but for the most part fails on many other levels.
First off there is orlando bloom, who just doesn't work as the honorable man looking to avenge his father.  Even with a beard he just looks fragile, and his expressions range from confused to annoyed.
Johnny Depp is decent as Captain Jack Sparrow, but his character is overdone.  He comes off as silly a lot of the time.  I know his character is supposed to be a bit warped, but there is a limit.  Take away the silly walk and tone down the goofy facial expressions and it might have worked.
A lot of the bad guys, antiheroes, and costars were plain and simply dull.  The british naval officer lacked depth, the pirates were cardboard cutouts, and the female heroine, though a tough character just wasn't very intersting(a noblewoman who didn't want to be about sums it up), and the brilliant Geoffery Rush was wasted as the two dimensional pirate captain.
The movie had some interesting cinematography, but the action sequences were poorly filmed.  They were either too close to see what is going on or poorly angled, and there is a lot of them.  One of my friends referred to it as ""the pirate fight movie"".
If you want something to keep the kids entertained, use this movie.  If you want something for anyone over the age of 16, then find something meatier.  But what do you expect from a disney movie based off a theme show ride, about as much as a movie based off a video game.",1080518400,5,1563,4.418118466898955

I have developed a lot of admiration for her. If you enjoyed her performance in this, you must check her out in Bend it like Beckman. But she looks so different, she is hardly recognizable.

That was beyond corney.  But you've got to take into account that this movie has to appeal to children as well as adults, as it is a children's movie.

After seeing Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, I was not able to envision another person cast in that role.

1492049,4,B00005JM5E,"""Pirates"" is a fun romp of a film.  It has to be considering it is based on the amusement park ride of the same name.  Johnny Depp does a good job as Captain Jack Sparrow.  He seems to be about one swig of rum away from oblivion throughout the whole film.  Although most folks applaud Depp as the standout performer in this movie, the entire cast is deserving of accolades.  Although most of the characters are pretty stock, it's how they are played that makes this film so wonderful.  The acting is intentionally over-the-top.  Geoffrey Rush plays Barbossa, the greedy, mutiness pirate captain who commandeers the Black Pearl from Depp.  Rush brings something to the character that makes him more appealing than say, a Captain Hook.  The rest of the pirates are just as greedy and just as mutiness, but their stereotypical behaviors are set off by some brilliant acting.  Their are dumb pirates, mean pirates and, of course, one bad monkey.
I won't go into a synopsis of the film.  Instead, I want to speak about the overall production and quality of this flick.  The special effects are dead on(no pun intended).  The way the pirates dance in and out of the moonlight, changing from living beings to rotting corpses, is fun to watch.  The battle between the Pearl and the Interceptor is classic, excessive Hollywood fun.  Even the sounds of this film are played to perfection.  This is one of those movies that makes you wish you had surround sound if you are so not blessed.
So, if you like fun, bold adventure with just a little silliness, ""Pirates"" is definitely a fun movie to watch.  It'll have you wanting to go eat at Long John Silver's and scream ""Aargh"" all the way back home.  A fun, modern pirate movie in the classic pirate movie vein.",1078963200,2,1749,4.623376623376624
1492140,5,B00005JM5E,"I was so blown away when I finished seeing the movie ""Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse of The Black Pearl"" even with the high expectations from hearing all of the excellent reviews that this movie got and let me tell you, this movie deserves every great review that it gets. This is one of the best movies of 2003 and this DVD is a must-have. In so many ways ""Pirates"" is a major sweeping epic adventure that I have never seen before. I generally have not been a major fan of pirate movies until I saw this movie and you should not miss this DVD with all of the awesome extras on here.
 In a lot of ways, I view this movie as almost like two or three sub-plots all bound together into one amazing movie. I don't know about you but I sense that there were three small plots all in one movie but they all fit very well together on this sweeping epic adventure.
  The story unfolds where a British navy ship discovers a young boy named Will Turner barely alive in the ocean during the 1800s in the Caribbean Sea, and a young girl named Elizabeth Swann helps to rescue him from death after his ship was destroyed by unknown assailants. Elizabeth Swann is kidnapped by a fleet of rogue pirates and popular citizen, Will Turner, now a young man, partners up with a very unlikely ally named Jack Sparrow, a rogue menacing but friendly pirate named Jack Sparrow to save Elizabeth from the evil pirates. However, they soon realize that they are up against much worse enemies when it is discovered that the evil pirates are in an undead state, stuck between life and death and take the form of skeletons when exposed to the moonlight.
 Teaming up with Jack Sparrow, Will Turner fights against the evil undead pirate monsters to rescue Elizabeth Swann from their evil undead captain named Barbossa. Barbossa along with his evil fleet is seeking for a special artifact called ""The Black Pearl"" to bring him, and his pirate crew back to normal life as normal human beings and reclaim their power over the Caribbean. It is said that he is so evil that even Hell spit him right back out! Jack Sparrow on a personal note is also at war with Captain Barbossa to regain his long lost ship that was stolen from him many years ago.
 With all of these things, it is a long, dangerous but fun adventure as they aim to rescue Elizabeth Swann from Barbossa and prevent him from gaining a hold of the ""Black Pearl"".
 This movie succeeds on so many levels. TO me, this was one of the most unlikely success stories in movie history in recent years. Everyone involved in this project deserves the utmost praise that they have gotten. Although only in a relatively limited role, I thought that Jonathan Pryce was really funny as the bumbling Governor Swann and is a nice departure from the more traditionally villainous roles in his movies. Orlando Bloom also makes a nice departure away from the ""Lord of the Rings"" franchise and is absolutely fabulous as the brave-hearted Will Turner. I thought that Elizabeth Swann was the best damsel in distress character that I've seen in many years.
 The twosome rival duo Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush though really stole the two halves of the spotlight on here. I really thought that Geoffrey Rush was absolutely fantastic as the vicious undead pirate Barbossa and Rush really brought the evil character to life on the big screen. It's so cool seeing Barbossa's eyes wide open when he's being cunning and planning his ambitious schemes. Johnny Depp was the absolute perfect choice for the role of the mentally twisted Captain Jack Sparrow. He really brings the oddball, twisted, demented, yet charming personality of Sparrow to life on the big screen. I felt that these two characters were what made this movie so much fun.
 Any remaining cast members I didn't mention also brought a lot of personalities into their character roles in this movie.
 The best thing I think that really made this movie so successful is that it takes the darkness of pirate movies but gives it a more comedic undertone to make it more fun and adventurous without robbing any of the personalities away from them. I felt that this is one of the rare cases where a movie blends adventure, comedy, and epic fun and results in a highly intelligent and strongly thought-out masterpiece! I felt that comedy in general has gone through a decline in recent years but this movie though gives comedy a much-needed facelift. The directing is amazing too and the sceneries are also spellbinding especially with the underwater scenes in some places. I think that they really put a lot of time into making this and really made a strong script out of it.
 The DVD edition is something that is NOT to be missed. The movie itself is a real masterpiece but disc two also contains some really cool features. My favorites are the ""Blooper Reel"" and the part that goes into the part that involves the films making. Some of the sets were absolutely amazing and one set for a particular scene in the movie particular really blew me away at its grand scale and size. There are many other features that are not to be missed on this DVD edition but these sections I felt were worth mentioning but everything else I didn't mention here with this review deserves a look as well.
 Whatever you do, do whatever you can to get a hold on this DVD. Forget the VHS. VHS's offer little of anything anymore these days and get damaged too easily. The DVD edition has lots of treats on it and should be included in any movie-goers collection. This is a really amazing movie and an awesome DVD to go along with it.",1078876800,,5570,4.571142284569138
1492141,3,B00005JM5E,"According to all the positive reviews, it looks like this movie is one of the best ever made. I will say it's certainly a good entertainment For sure there is nothing to say about Johnny Depp, he's good and without beeing clairvoyant, I can say that there will be a sequel of Pirate of the Caribbean in a couple of years. That's a Hollywood movie with an old recipe making profits easily. Yes, kind of you already know everything in the first minutes that there will be a happy ending, a love story and heroism everywhere.
The only thing I will say it's Pirate doesn't create anything new. Many Pirate movies have been made in the past with the same kind of story. Okay it's maybe funnier but well with all the money they had, they could have found a better story where the plot and the final are not so foreseeable and better told.
I found some incoherences here and there showing the weakness of the screenplay. Well not sure everybody noticed them.",1078876800,,951,4.471264367816092
1492142,4,B00005JM5E,"When pirates attack the Caribbean town of Port Royal and make off with the governor's daughter, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), the young blacksmith who loves her, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom),  enlists the help of an eccentric pirate named Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) in tracking them down. The two men set off in pursuit of the dreaded pirate ship The  Black Pearl, captained by a cutthroat named Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). But Jack Sparrow hasn't been entirely candid with his plan to capture the Pearl and save the young lady.

Instead of being based on a book or an entirely original screenplay, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" has the unusual distinction of being inspired by the ride at Walt Disneyland. I have to admit, the movie is better than I would have expected a film based on an amusement park attraction to be. Gore Verbinski directs this energetic, fanciful tale of 17th century pirates who terrorize Caribbean seaports. The tall masted ships look good, but the underwater visuals look fake in the extreme. There are lots of battle scenes but very little blood. The story is silly. But the film's great cast keeps us entertained for nearly two and a half hours. Johnny Depp's hilarious histrionic performance as Jack Sparrow alone makes ""Pirates"" worth seeing. Sparrow's coiffure resembles that of the infamous Blackbeard, but his good-natured humor departs from reality in uproarious fashion. Geoffrey Rush is another heavyweight thespian who has a lot of fun with his villainous character. Orlando Bloom is charming as the earnest and dashing, but unfortunately socially disadvantaged, young heartthrob Will. ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" isn't about anything but frivolous fun, but in that the film accomplishes its mission.

I recently read a book about the Golden Age of Piracy: ""Under the Black Flag"" by David Cordingly. If ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" has piqued your interest in pirate culture, Cordingly's book is an excellent overview of real-life 17th-century pirates, including those in the Caribbean. It includes history of many subjects alluded to in the film: the real town of Port Royal, which catered to pirates, Corts' Aztec gold, the island populations of buccaneers, famous Caribbean pirates, and the general life, times and downfall of the pirates of that era.",1078876800,2,2290,5.181081081081081

It was brilliant! Considering the hit-and-miss nature of Disney entertainment of late, I was guarded in my expectations. Happily, I was delighted rather than disappointed. Almost all ages could enjoy the rollicking adventure. I say almost, because the ghost pirates could easily scare the very young (but what special effects!). The characters were fun (Depp's was genius), the location was perfect, and the story very engaging.

Fun.
This movie is fun from the beginning to the end, and doesn't pretend to be more than it is.  They could have completely ruined this movie and tried to make it a serious film, but they didn't and it isn't.

1492202,5,B00005JM5E,"Wow - I can't remember the last time I liked a Disney Movie!  But Pirates of the Caribbean is a delight from start to finish.  It's epic, it's simple, you cheer the good guys you hiss the bad guys and you end up with a warm feeling in your stomach. And it's not just the rum...
It's nice to see Johnny Depp pick up a SAG award for his performance here - he truly is the glue that holds the movie together. He's immensely watchable, with the swaying and the weaving and the fleeting looks of puzzlement that scurry across his face.  Fans of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas might perhaps notice certain similarities with the way he played Raoul Duke in that movie, but perhaps as hedonistic reprobates the characters are closer than they might at first appear.  Geoffrey Rush is also damn good, and Jack Davenport hasn't been this convincing since ""This Life"" premiered.  Don't worry Hollywood, you can still find Brits to be bad guys after all these years.  Also fantastic is Mackenzie Crook, Gareth from the brilliant BBC series ""The Office"" (He was the one with the ""independent"" eye...).  Playing with seamen in the Caribbean must be along way from Slough, but he handles it magnificently and, I have to say, made me quite proud.
 I thought the plot bounced along rather well, the visuals and the special effects were awesome but not distracting, and I'd recommend the movie to anyone and everyone.
The DVD set is also really good, with a whole host of outtakes, deleted scenes, how-did-they-do-that? specials and even a video diary from one of the pirates.

This movie is about more than just hotness though. It is one of the best movies that Disney ever made. The special effects are dazzling, and you really feel like you are in the pirate ship yourself somewhere in the Caribbean. And Johnny Depp makes the perfect pirate. The acting is great. Disney considered replacing him, and they're probably thanking their lucky stars right now that they didn't or else the film just wouldn't be the same blockbuster that it was. Too bad it didn't win any Oscars on Sunday, stupid Lord of the Rings, every category that Pirates was nominated, so was LOTR and guess who won. Personally, I think the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disney is one of the worst rides ever, blech, incredibly boring, but the same cannot be said for the movie, definitely one of my favorites",1078185600,4,969,4.537142857142857

My wife bought the DVD and made me sit down and watch it with her.  I fully expected to hate it (or at least be bored to death with corny slapstick and bad acting)
Five seconds into it, I was so engrossed I forgot who made it and forgot there was someone else in the room watching it with me.
Some interesting points:
1) I didn't notice until about the fifth time I watched it, but there was no cursing in it. They weren't trying to dance around adult language by substituting in stuff that would keep it from getting an R rating...The movie just didn't need it.
2) The special effects were amazing!  They weren't dulled down and cartoonish to keep from scaring the kids, and the transitions when the pirates moved in and out of the moonlight were better than anything I've ever seen.
I could go scene by scene giving examples of all the amazing aspects of this movie, but I suggest you just start with the first one, you'll be hooked.",1078099200,3,1085,4.257281553398058

Had anyone else taken the role of Captain Jack Sparrow, this movie would have been unwatchable.  The plot is cookie cutter, and Orlando Bloom as Will Turner, while very hot, is laughable.  It's pretty obvious that Will Turner is not supposed to be the guy we think rocks.  At least, I hope he isn't, cause he was pretty dumb.  In any case, Johnny Depp could deliver something written by Robert Jordan and make it seem like pure genius, and so the film wins out.  The cinematography is beautiful and the skeletons are pretty damn cool.  Geoffrey Rush does great as the pirate villain, and has his ""arrgs"" down perfectly.  This film is worth a viewing.

Although the story line is comic book simple (yes, straight from the ride in Disneyland), and the sets and special effects are grand, it was the acting that kept my interest.  Never afraid to look foolish (and thereby, they rarely do), the actors jump into their roles with wonderful relish.  Orlando Bloom repeats his swordsmanship from ""Lord of the Rings"" with expert craft and Geoffrey Rush skillfully convinces us that he is just as mad as he was in the ""Marquis de Sade"", but now seems to be having more fun.  The standout, with no surprise, is Johnny Depp's swishy pirate revival.  His androgynous swagger, expressive eyes and talent of delivering a witful line is pure mastery.  It should be no surprise that he was nominated for best actor, especially regarding his less than pro-Hollywood views.  This film is pure family entertainment with no thinking required.
The extra features are especially rewarding with much more than most DVD's.  The commentaries can be a tad self-rewarding and the CD-ROM feature could have been better, but the bloopers, deleted scenes and `behind the scenes' portions are great fun.",1077753600,3,1228,4.985294117647059

At points in the movie (Sparrow in the bar convincing the older pirate that Turner is indeed a treasure) were a little stiff.  It seemed as if the plotline took a backseat to the FX and to the characters themselves.  Depp, as Captain Jack Sparrow, is quirky and eccentric and the antithesis of the classic pirate.  He blows a breath of fresh air into this movie.  Orlando Bloom is totally believable as a slightly uptight orphan.  Keira Knightley is fun, fun, fun as an adventure-starved lady of the manor.

The plot is secondary to Depp's vamping and camping around the place, but still, it's a good plot: an adventure quest to recapture the good ship Black Pearl, a ghost ship taken over by Geoffrey Rush (he plays his part exceptionally well, too; but no one can compete with Depp, who completely and unashamedly steals the show), a mutineer who is desperately seeking Susan - no, that's another movie...desperately seeking to reverse an ancient curse that has reduced him and his mangy crew to live as skeletons in the nether world of the eternally undead.

After all how many pirates have you seen wearing eye make-up and sporting dreadlocks. And if that isn't odd enough he has a few expressions and movements that has one pondering his sanity.
The opening scene of him sailing ashore on a sinking ship is one of many that will make you laugh. The rest of the cast is great. I was especially impressed with Orlando Bloom's and Keira Knightly's support. All the rest the cast are well suited to their roles as well. The adventure that has them embarking on a voyage to recover lost treasure that is being guarded by a Ghost Ship is not at all predictable as one would expect.

The pirates are both pirates & ghosts.  I love the way they just effortlessly transform from human to bone.  I love how realistic & spooky looking the pirates are when they are just bones.  The pirates are evil to the core, who don't care what they do to the girl or how cruelly they treat her.
Johnny is hired in as a captain of a pirate ship to go out to sea to find her & get her back.  The action is good enough to keep you on the edge of your seat for a long time.  The special effects are very well done, a little over the top at times, but not enough to really be a detriment to the movie.
At 143 minutes (2 h 23 m) it is very long & seems to move along slowly at times, but it is just building up steam & momentum.  The fight scene with Johnny & the pirates is great as well, never a dull moment, & very well done.
The DVD itself is really good as well, 2 discs with a boatload of bonus materials, especially commentaries, deleted scenes, & extended scenes.  It would be nice to have a trailer on the DVD, though.

Anyways, here's my best attempt of reviewing the DVD release - focusing on the EXTRAS since everybody else seems to focus on the film (which is obviously brilliant).
<Commentary by director Gore Verbinski and Star Johnny Depp>
This is the feature I was looking most forward to yet it was probably the least interesting! The other commentaries are much more interesting and entertaining. Gore and Johnny mostly comment on whom they know in the film rather than how they did it. ""Hey look! It's so-and-so!"" & ""so-and-so is a beautiful beautiful person."" was typical throughout. Boring!
<Commentary by producer Jerry Bruckheimer and Stars Keira Knightley And Jack Davenport>
This was in fact the most entertaining of the commentaries! I don't really even like Keira Knightley very much but she was so funny in the commentary. I don't remember hearing Jerry Bruckheimer AT ALL in this commentary. As I recall it was only Jack Davenport and Keira. Jack is a very funny man and loved making fun of his character throughout. You can tell that he and Keira get along very well and had a good time with the film.
<Commentary by writers Stuart Beattie, Ted Elliot & Terry Rossio and Jay Wolpert>
This commentary track was very interesting. I thought it would be more boring than the ones with the cast but it wasn't. They talked about the writing process and what was in the various drafts of the film. They also point out many of the more subtle nods to the ride.
<An Epic At Sea: The Making of ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl"">
Typical ""making of"" featurette with all you expect from them.
<19 Deleted and Alternate Scenes>
Most of these were really ""alternate"" scenes and not completely new. There were more nods to the ride that I really wish made the final cut of the film. An interesting change they made was to the scene when Jack meets with Mr. Gibbs in the bar. Orlando's character was standing by a pole waiting for them to talk in private and an ugly fat woman comes up to him and he finds her repulsive. Well, in the alternate version it was an attractive woman instead. And there were more cuts to Orlando and his reactions.
<""Moonlight"" Scene Progression>
Showed a bit on how much work went into the special effects. They had to film each scene (that contained skeletal pirates) three times: once with all actors, once with only the uncursed (humans) and once with motion-control for the pirate actors so they could copy their moves into the computer for the skeletal reproductions.
When Keira did her scene where the skeletons throw her around it was only her alone with nobody else on set. The skeletons were all added later (obviously).
<""Below Deck"" - An Interactive History Of Pirates>
LOADS of information and facts about real pirates. It's basically an interview with a knowledgable professor-historian-expert dude, but it's chopped into pieces and categorized so you can only watch the parts that interest you instead of watching a lengthy interview. The downside is they removed the possibility to rewind or fast-forward so if you miss something, you have to start the clip over.
<""Fly on the Set"" Featurette>
Interesting footage of some of the action sequences uncut and before the cgi.
<""Diary of a Pirate"" - Behind-the-Scenes look with cast member Lee Arenberg>
This is DV footage by the very funny actor who played Pintel (the shorter, stockier pirate who was sidekick to the tall, lanky one with the wooden eye).
<""Diary of a Ship"" Video Journal>
A journey that the ship (used as the Commodore) took getting to the island where they needed it for filming. The crew on the ship went through quite a lot in getting the ship there - storms, passing through the panama canal, dolphins and more.
<""Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color"" - Archival TV Program>
This is an AWESOME look back in time to when the Pirates of the Caribbean ride was first ""unveiled"" at Disneyland. Hosted by Walt Disney himself (from the early 60's), it shows us the entire process in planning, designing and building the ride. It also takes us on a tour through most of the ride so we can see direct comparisons of some of the scenes from the film. It's been a few years since I was last at Disneyland so I had forgotten some of the features of this ride. Watching this I found at least 4 or 5 more ""nods"" from the movie.
<Producer's Diary Featurette With Jerry Bruckheimer>
I didn't know Jerry was such a good photographer. I thought this would be boring, but it's really great! It's basically a slideshow of several pictures Jerry took while filming. He does a great commentary throughout the ""slideshow"".
<Blooper Reel>
This was HILLAREUS! Nearly all the outtakes included Johnny Depp. He is a very funny man! My favorite was the part when the pirates catch him in the cave and he tries to remember the word ""Parlay"". Except in the outtake, he and Lee Arenberg (Pintel) adlibbed a long section where Johnny went into a Indian accent (something about curry) and then on to French foods (something about Mayonnaise). A total riot!
I don't have a DVD-Rom so I can't speak for those features.
Hope this helps a bit! :)
Johnny Depp really makes this movie! He is completely mesmerising to watch and steals every scene he's in. I can't wait for the sequel!",1077235200,10,5397,4.712169312169312
1492386,5,B00005JM5E,I love this movie and Johnny Depp was the only reason I went to see it in the movie theater. I bought the video and just love it. It has become one of my favorite movies. I highly recommend it to anyone.,1077148800,,203,3.857142857142857
1492387,5,B00005JM5E,"At first, I had thought this movie was just so-so from the trailers.  After I watched it, I became an instant fanatic.  Printouts from the movie are like wallpaper in my room at the moment.  Seeing it in the theaters 3 or 4 times, I waited for the DVD and as soon as stores opened I bought it, then watched it a total of 29 times thus far. (It would've been about 700 by now if it hadn't been for school and homework) This is a movie you can never tire of and is suitable for all ages.  Captain Jack Sparrow is BY FAR the most stunning character ever brought to life.  Johnny Depp is an amazing actor.  The humor, the wit, the charm...He's got it all.  You can't walk away from this movie without remembering that pirate. Back to the movie, its just awesome. You've got to see it.",1077062400,,780,4.16
1492458,5,B00005JM5E,"My daugter bought it before we'd even see it, but figured we'd take a chance on Disney and that Pirates is one of our must-do rides at Disneyland. I watched hers twice before I decided I had to have my own copy. I've watched it several times and I'm still not tired of it. Captain Jack Sparrow as played by Johnny Depp is one of the best characters ever created. No one could have done it better. All the actors were incredible, except for Miss KK. She was quite annoying at times and I think someone else could have given her character more depth. I now fast-forward through most of the skeleton or battle scenes, but I could watch Captain Jack over and over again. The extras on the DVD are great too. I particularly like the costume and makeup section.",1077062400,,755,4.361702127659575
1492459,5,B00005JM5E,"But Pirates is nothing short of an awesome movie. Johnny Depp proves yet again to be an extraordinary actor, and his talent and versatility go a long distance to make this film enjoyable and (almost infinitely) re-watchable.
There is a great amount of action, adventure and humor for kids, as well as some veiled hilarious references that adults alone are likely to get (apparently you've never been to Singapore).
The movie is clever, witty, funny, and just generally excellent enough to be enjoyed by just about anyone - even those that see Disney Co as the Death Star and Mr. Eisner as Darth Vader himself.",1076976000,,609,4.809523809523809
1492460,5,B00005JM5E,"Pirates of the Caribbean is an amazing combination of action and adventure that just about everyone enjoys. It has a superb plot, and enough action sequences to keep the audience interested.
  We first meet Elizabeth as a young girl aboard a ship heading to the Caribbean. We also get a chance to see a bit of  Norrington's character as well. The action starts quickly after Elizabeth finds Will floating in the water. After that, the plot picks up even more as we are introduced to the characters as they will be throughout the rest of the movie.
  But what about Johnny Depp? Of course he makes an appearance near the beginning of the movie as Cap'n Jack Sparrow, and he is hysterical. While the rest of the main characters are at a promotion for Norrington, Jack tries to steal a ship. Here, the plots collide when Jack has to rescue Elizabeth. (It's a long story why, you'll just have to watch the movie) Next comes the best action sequences (in my opinion) of the movie. Jack and Will have an awesome swordfight scene, all the while keeping up a great dialogue. The rest of the movie follows that same kind of pattern.
  Elizabeth gets kidnapped by the Black Pearl, where she learns something very interesting about the pirates and their curse. (Chances are you already know what this is, but in case you don't, I won't say it) Of course, Will, trying to be the ""knight in shining armor"" tries to rescue Elizabeth, but doesn't know where to start looking, so he has to team up with Jack. Humor follows Jack all the way through the movie, so of course simply getting out of Port Royal was hysterical.
  As for the rest of the movie, it is filled with great action and funny scenes. The plot does seem to move slowly at times, but usually you don't honestly care too much about it. This is a great movie to watch on a rainy day, when you have plenty of time to really watch it.
  The DVD features are definitely worth the cost. The deleted scenes, especially the scene with Jack and Elizabeth marrooned on the island, are spectacular, and they really help you to undersatnd the film better. The blooper reel is great, and probably the best special feature on the disc. Another great thing about this DVD is the commentaries. One of the commentaries is only selected scenes from the movie, so the entire thing only takes about half an hour. This is great because you don't have to sit through the entire movie again. There are other extras, like a tour around a ship of the era and a few documentaries, all of which are worth watching.
  All in all, this is a great movie well worth the cost and time.",1076976000,,2603,4.4778012684989426
1492461,5,B00005JM5E,"Johnny Depp's brilliant performance as Captain Jack Sparrow carries this film from strength to strength! Depp plays the pirate as a slightly effeminate, customarily inebriated, slurring, ne'er-do-well villian-turned-hero who charms, delights, and thrills at every turn!
This movie is just plain fun! You'll love the plundering adventure of the ""bad guys"", pirate sweeping fair maiden off her feet, and the smile-on-your-face, rocking-in-your-seat action!

Also the characterization of Barbarossa kind of reminds me off the Turkish Navy Commander in 15-16th centuries, sharing the same name with the character.
The visual effects are really good, with skeletons and big ships. And the story is kind of fun, too. Well basically this is a good movie for easy going entertainment.",1076716800,,537,5.044943820224719
1492537,4,B00005JM5E,"The Pirates Of The Caribbean is a high-seas, swash-bucking action adventure epic that became 2003's biggest surprise hit. Unleashed in the summer the film was set to become a success, but it went way beyond that by grossing more than $300 million at the US Box Office alone, and spending month after month inside the Top 10. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer (""Pearl Harbor"") and directed by Gore Verbinski (""The Ring""), ""The Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl"" is a film that will be adore by all generations.
The story revolves around Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) who's idyllic pirate lifestyle gets turned upside down when his enemy Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) steals his ship, the Black Pearl, and later attacks the town of Port Royal. Barbossa kidnaps the Governor's beautiful daughter (Kiera Knightley). In a desperate attempt to rescue both Elizabeth and the recapture the Black Pearl, her childhood friend and future lover Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) joins forces with Jack. The two set off on a suspense-filled adventure, but what they don't know is that a cursed treasure has doomed Barbossa and his crew to live forever as the undead.
Granted, the plot isn't very intricate. It's very lightweight which is to be expected because this is a Disney movie aimed at it's target audience: children. The film incorporates many different themes which makes it highly enjoyable and successful in delighting so many viewers. Action, mystery, humour, romance and the unforgettable characters all add to the film in making this a particular stand out film from the past year. The special effects in the movie are also worthy of high praise. They are superbly produced and you can tell that a lot of thought and effort has gone into them. The fight scenes are brilliantly choreographed, and the location in which the film was shot is also extremely scenic and picturesque.
Johnny Depp really does steal the show as Captain Jack Sparrow. His portrayal of Jack is both serious and light-hearted. It can be taken either way and he shines on both accounts. Orlando Bloom is good as the shy Will Turner. His love for Elizabeth is adorable in itself, if not for his photogenic screen appearance and rising celebrity following his role as Legolas in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy (2001-2003). Kiera Knightly works in superb contrast to the male leads in the film as the cheeky Elizabeth. Her upbeat nature and charismatic personality single-handedly supports a fraction of the film and keeps it going until the final scenes.
The Special Features on this DVD are extremely worthwhile. They include:
- Audio Commentaries
- Epic At Sea
- Diaries
- Fly On The Set
- Blooper Reel
- Pirates In The Park
- Below Deck
- 19 Deleted Scenes
- 'Moonlight Serenade' (Scene Progression)
- Image Gallery
OVERALL GRADE: 8/10
The Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl was one of 2003's most successful movies and received rave reviews from critics and the public alike. However, I do feel that people went a bit over the top with this movie. Something like this hadn't come along in quite a few years, so people were so quick to jump on the bandwagon by branding it the best film in years. In reality, it's not. Don't get me wrong, it is a very enjoyable film, but somewhat overrated. The success of this film sealed possible doubts about a sequel. With more than $300 million grossed from America's wallets, a sequel is inevitable. Hopefully it will be just as enjoyable as the first.",1076716800,3,3503,4.84
1492538,5,B00005JM5E,"I was skeptical about this movie when I discovered it was being made. Two reasons why? First, Pirates of the Carribean is my favorite ride. Second, Johnny Depp is my favorite actor. There was just something not right about it. Depp doing a high budget, Jerry Bruckhiemer produced, Disney inspired ride movie? However all my worries desserted me when I saw the film. It was a great movie with a dynamite cast and a good enough script to go along with it. Depp was so convincing as Captain Jack Sparrow that it didn't even look like he was acting at all. This movie made me feel like a kid again. Just the way ""The Goonies"" does whenever I see it. After watching the film I went to Disneyland a few weeks later. Usually when I go on the ride the line is 10 minutes. However this time I had to wait 2 hours, and I had a fast pass. There was something about the ride that was different, but in a good way. The movie made me enjoy the ride 10 times more than I had ever before. I was hoping that Captain Jack Sparrow would be in the attraction. Now there will be a sequel, that is undeniable considering this movie made $300 million plus at the box office. But I just hope that it at least is half as good as this one.",1076630400,4,1213,4.165957446808511

After seeing interviews with Johnny Depp in which he mentioned his role model for Captain Jack Sparrow was Keith Richards, I watched raptly as he sauntered and slurred his way through each escapade.  You cannot help but watch his every move, wondering what he would do next.
Orlando Bloom plays the idealistic blacksmith as Geoffrey Rush plays the evil pirate in control of the Black Pearl.  Both work well with Depp, which helps the movie move along.

The story is about cursed pirates/ zombie skeleton things...i can take ridiulous meaningless plots like this if they are at least witty and funny, this is neither. The movie is based on a ride at disney land for gods sakes. It has atleast made me much more cautious about what i see at the cinema.

1492631,4,B00005JM5E,"When writing the play THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE in 1879, English playwright W.S. Gilbert wrote the words ""It is, it is a glorious thing, to be a Pirate King."" And if these words have any grain of truth whatsoever, then Johnny Depp would own the whole beach. The throne of Pirate King is rightfully his, as far as I'm concerned. The crown fits him well. In fact, if it were down to me, I wouldn't think twice about giving him an Oscar for his totally mesmerizing performance in this film.

For one thing, the true sign of a good actor is versatility. And Johnny Depp is definitely one of the most versatile performers Hollywood has seen since the Golden Era, if not THE most. For every role he plays, he brings something completely new to the character. He changes his voice. He changes his appearance. The way he walks, moves... his every mannerism and facial expression are altered to fit whatever character he's playing. In ED WOOD he delightfully and hilariously parodied the atypical 1950s film star. In FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS he showed us how good he is at observing human behavior and imitating it by impersonating gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson. And in PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL (based on a popular theme-park ride at Disneyland) he dazzles us with his performance as Capt. Jack Sparrow - a despicable, sleazy, drunken pirate who speaks in slurred, confused incomprehensibles but inevitably wins us over with his roguish charm.

The story is simple: basically, there's this gold medallion. It's clearly a pirate thing. And it's currently in the hands of the governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) who lives on a British military installation called Fort Royal, a picturesque little island slap-bang in the middle of the Caribbean Sea. But the medallion isn't hers. It actually used to belong to Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), a young boy who was found floating on the surface of the ocean during Elizabeth's transatlantic journey to the island eight years ago. When his unconscious body was dragged aboard the ship, the 12-year-old Elizabeth found the gold medallion fastened round his neck and, fearing for his life, she took it from him and kept it for herself.

Since then, Will has grown up into a dashing young blacksmith (sporting a little Errol Flynn-style moustache) and he makes lots of swords for a living (""You need to get yourself a girl, mate!""). It becomes obvious that both Will and Elizabeth are romantically interested in each other. But there's a big social divide between them so we know for a fact they're not gonna get together. (Yeah... right!). It's at this moment that Johnny arrives on the scene. Or, if you prefer, Capt. Jack Sparrow does. With a mane of greasy dreadlocks and a goatie with multi-colored beads braided to it, you know there's going to be trouble. And you'd be right. It's not long before Jack is arrested and thrown behind bars. Some pirate, huh? Then, that very night, Fort Royal is attacked by a ship with black sails called The Black Pearl, and Elizabeth is kidnapped for being in possession of the gold medallion. Her unreqieted lover Will is now forced to take action. Knowing that Captain Jack Sparrow is privy to knowledge of all that is piracy, Will helps him break free from jail on the condition that he aid him on his quest to find The Black Pearl and save his beloved Elizabeth.

Believe me, there is a lot more to it than that. I mean, did I even mention the fact that the The Black Pearl is crewed by a bunch of immortal pirates who turn into skeletons when the moonlight hits them? Or that Jack's sworn enemy, Capt. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), stole the ship off Jack ages ago and abandoned him on a desert island with only a pistol and a bottle of rum for company? And did I let slip that the reason they need the gold medallion (which is one of many Aztec coins, incidentally) is to undo the curse of immortality that was wrought upon them by the heathen gods? No, I didn't tell you any of those things. I suppose you'll just have to watch the damn movie and find it all out for yourself.

The film is not without flaws, however. Location-wise, the story tends to jump around a little too much, and at 2 hours 23 minutes long it does tend to drag on its hind legs a bit. But the action sequences are spectactularly explosive (as you'd expect from a movie produced by action movie maestro Jerry Bruckheimer), Gore Verbinski's direction is crisp and efficient, and the script written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (SHREK, THE MASK OF ZORRO) is sharp, exciting and funny (if occasionally clichd). By the way, if there's anyone who wants to look deeply into this film (as I tend to do), take note of the mythical undercurrent with the references to Hernan Cortes (a real-life Spanish explorer who was mistaken for a god by the Aztecs). Historically, the cursed treasure idea kinda makes sense. And by including these supernatural elements in a pirate movie, they have succeeded in doing something very new and highly original. So I applaud them for that.

 I really enjoyed this movie. It has restored my faith in the Hollywood blockbuster after far too many disappointments. But it only gets 4 stars because there are a number of holes in the plot that could have been embellished upon. Such as: Why was Bootstrap Bill's blood so important? Why him, of all people? Still, I can't deny this is ripping entertainment. And very fun to watch. I'll recommend it to anyone. And I truly believe that Johnny Depp steals every single frame. To be fair, this is HIS movie. His performance is a real stroke of genius. So if you're seeing this movie for the very first time, you're in for a real treat. Don't miss out.",1076198400,2,5724,4.666997026759168

In the movie, Depp plays a rogue pirate and his actions and his banters with other characters are just hilarious. Bloom, as a blacksmith in the movie, stood steadily for justice and law, yet he displayed a strong faith in love and most importantly - friendship. The villan, Captain Barbosa, played by the accomplished actor Geoffery Rush was another plus to the movie.
Another complement for the director is the life-like computer animations and graphics. Because the pirates of the Black Pearl is under a curse fo the Aztec Gold, they turn into skeletons under the moonlight. The computer crew did a wonderful job to manipulate the movement of the bones of the pirate skeletons. It's great!

1492716,4,B00005JM5E,When I first went to see this movie I thought It was gonna be a little kid movie but boy was I in for a treat. It was an action adventure thing. The pirates looked real. When you start to watch this movie you won't wanna get up until you see the whole movie.; When you watch you feel like you are there with them. Great movie.,1076025600,,326,3.8805970149253732
1492717,4,B00005JM5E,"I have seen this movie twice and found it even funnier the second time around.  I am sure that had to do with the fact that the first time, I didn't realize Jack Sparrow's character was based loosely on Keith Richards from the Rolling Stones.  Johnny Depp does an amazing job.  I think because of his good looks, no one gives him the credit he deserves as an actor.  He's so smooth in this.  He didn't even have to speak to make the film funny.  He was Jack Sparrow.  Should he get the oscar?  It's hard to say because I haven't seen the other movies to compare. He should definetely get acknowledged in some way because his take on Jack Sparrow and his acting, were phenonmenal.  On another note, the filming was incredible.  It was such a beautiful mood piece.  It took you back to another time and place.  Coming from Disney, I was impressed.  Very enjoyable.",1076025600,4,862,4.414012738853503
1492718,5,B00005JM5E,"Like many, I have taken the Disney Pirates ride many times and the movie holds true to its tale.  Borrowing some of its verve, not to mention stealing some elements outright, from another great pirate movie The Crimson Pirate with Burt Lancaster, this is a fun, well made film.  The acting is much above normal with an largerly British cast.  Johnny Depp's Captian Jack Sparrow is off-beat, quirky, and a bit over the top, but an interesting turn for a surprisingly good actor.  Handsome Orlando Bloom plays the upright Will Turner who slowly takes to Jack and his flexible moral code with believable charm.  Geffory Rush is a fine villan as Pirate Captain Barbossa and Jonathan Pryce does a nice turn as the foppish Governor Swann of Port Royal, father of Elizabeth, the love interest and female lead.  The Special effects have equal billing, but don't overwhelm the actors as is so often the case.  The script is light, but interesting enough for adults and violence kept at typical Disney levels.  Better than most films of the genre and with lots of very funny throw away lines.  Get your popcorn and have a good oldfashioned saturday afternoon movie.",1076025600,3,1155,4.792929292929293
1492719,5,B00005JM5E,"Johnny Depp has always been one of my favorite actors. He has a sort of mysterious look to him, not to mention his incredible acting abilities. Also a long time fan of Tim Burton, who is an inventor in his own right, I always liked Depp's acting style, and can see why Mr. Burton chose him to star in many of his films. Though his film's seem to get fewer and farther between these days, Depp is still lighting up the silver-screen. His most recent film, of course, is Pirates of the Caribbean.
The film mainly follows the infamous Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), a drunken sort of character who is always getting into trouble. Depp's performance truly steals the show, and he pulls off Mr. Sparrow with ease. Another noteworthy performance is by Orlando Bloom playing blacksmith Will Turner, who is in love with the Governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightely). When Elizabeth is captured by Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush), Captain of The Black Pearl, Will goes to Mr. Sparrow, agreeing to free him from prison if Jack helps him locate the dreaded ship.
Probably one of the main reasons to see Pirates of the Caribbean is for the special effects. For those who don't know, the plot of the film revolves around a curse. The curse can only inhabit the body of pirates who steal a certain treasure, one of which I can not speak of as it will give away certain plot elements that are essential to the element of ""surprise."" This curse allows the pirates to be invulnerable, taking shots and being stabbed will not injure or kill them. With this curse comes a price, as by stepping into the moonlight will reveal a hollowed skeleton. With that being said, the transformation that occurs when the pirates step in and out of the moonlight are astonishing. Every bone moves the way a real human's skeletal structure should, and makes for some very pleasing eye candy. One of the best special effects sequences involves Captain Barbosa standing in the moonlight, drinking a bottle of wine. As the wine pours down his spine, some of the wine hits the rib cage, separating as it goes down to the wood floor.
For the average movie watcher, this is a great movie if you enjoy the fantasy-adventure-action genre. While the film does slightly drag toward the end (the movie clocks in at about 143 min.), it still makes up for it by keeping you involved in the story. It's also worthy to note that the film was directed by Gore Verbinski, the same man behind The Ring. While Pirates of the Caribbean may not be as scary as The Ring, it definitely has some great fight scenes and specials effects. Check this one out, you won't regret it.",1075939200,,2621,4.626609442060086
1492720,5,B00005JM5E,"Plenty of wit, beautiful locations (some computer-generated, though), lots of action, and gleefully enthusiastic performances.  This film deserved the box office success it enjoyed.
Depp is at his usual enchanting best, and he is surrounded by a supporting cast (all the way down to the comic relief pirates and British soldiers) who are enjoying themselves as much as he is.
Plenty of DVD extras, DTS sound, rich photography and clever special effects -- what more could you ask for?
Oh yeah.  A script.
And there IS one, thank goodness.  It feels a bit strange to see Jerry Bruckheimer's name attached to a big-budget film that actually has delightful script (albeit lightweight, but that is in keeping with the fun and lightheartedness of the film) for a change.  Credit the screenwriters of ""Shrek"" for giving this film just the right amount of humor without feeling the need to be too self-referential of its genre.
This film should forever put to rest any doubts about Johnny Depp's talent as comedic actor and leading man.",1075939200,5,1029,4.965116279069767

The characterizations are a wonderful blend of light-comedy and earnest genre work.  Depp and Rush keep the mood light enough so the other principles can play it mostly straight.  At times it really reminded me of ""The Princess Bride"" in its style and feel - witty but well-made.
The film does run a bit too long, not that it can't sustain the humor and action, but parts seem extraneous.  A leaner film would have been better.",1075939200,,577,4.553398058252427

But overall the film went on a bit too much and it wasn't anything that amazing.  I guess it's enough to satisfy a lot of soccer moms who are just now discovering that Johnny Depp is a great actor.  Oh yeah, add 1/2 a star to this. (I don't understand why Amazon uses the 5 star rating method, why not 4 stars being the highest and no stars being the lowest?

In my opinion the plot was cute, but a little bit childish and silly. But what is good in this movie is the fact that the good acting makes the bad plot up. Johnny Depp changes this movie from good to great.

1492794,4,B00005JM5E,"At first, I had no interest in seeing this movie. The reviews I  read weren't exactly shining. But when you're at the theatre with a bunch of people who can't decide on what to see and two of them can't even get in to a R rated movie, somtimes you just make the sacrafice. And you know what? It was worth it. I've always liked Johnny Depp, and honestly, this is one of his best performances. The movie was constantly making me laugh, usually because of Depp. Really, it's like they wrote the movie around him, then threw in some other people and a few more story twists. And there is the major (although not too major) fault of the movie. When Depp isn't on screen, you kind of stop caring about the movie and where the story is going. It's a good thing he's on screen a lot, or I might have fallen asleep. It's not that the acting is bad, it's just that none of the other characters have the charisma or the comedy like Depp's character. But hey, you can't complain. In the end, there is enough to keep you interested, and thankfully Depp's Jack Sparrow keeps delivering until the credits roll. It's worth a rental, and definetly a buy for those who like a fun, none-too-serious story.",1075852800,2,1186,4.366515837104072

Though they have put out many ""real"" films before, none can possibly compare to this particular piece of art. A tad bit roguish, with just a dash of vulgarity, yet a simple classic tale make this the best pirate movie to ever appear on the market, despite the doubts that a pirate movie could ever amount to anything. Johnny Depp leads the cast, of course, with Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley making stunning performances as well. After seeing this movie in the theater, I rented it the day it came out and bought it a mere week later. Great fun and entertainment, no matter what age or genre.",1075852800,,677,4.512195121951219

1492797,5,B00005JM5E,"""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is genius. Really. Unlike Lord of the Rings, which attempted to be a serious movie, but really wasn't, ""Pirates"" go through the whole story with laughter, originality, and best of all - Johnny Depp. It's not a movie that's good because it's made good by an actor. No. It's just that Johnny Depp performs so well and blends into the story that he makes the story. I can't imagine ""Pirates"" without Depp.
But even without Depp, it's impressive. The movie is just lovable. And it isn't really because of the action (personally, I hate movies that are ""good"" because of the action and graphics - Matrix, for example), the movie is good because of the plot and the words and it's very capturing.
Can't really say too much about this movie. Just go and watch it. I watched it like 5 times already and I'm definitely gonna see it a few more times. Go and watch it, you won't regret it.",1075852800,,905,4.490909090909091
1492798,4,B00005JM5E,"It's astounding really. The thing about this movie is that it's truly awful, really, and I do mean that in all sincerity despite the fact that I recommend it and think it's just plain terrific fun. As anyone will tell you, Johnny Depp is worth the price of admission and the movie deserves some credit, if only because it allows Depp the improbable yet workable platform to take the logic defying leap he does with his character Captain Jack Sparrow. It's hard to recall another character so singularly engaging...perhaps Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka? Aside from Depp, there's not much else left. Keira Knightly is hardly the toothsome heroine men would go chasing vengeful undead pirates to save and Orlando Bloom, playing the gallant suitor, is as dry and crusty as week old bread (it's difficult to discern if this dry and crustiness is the fault of the script or the actor).
The movie is silly and pleasing. Think Indiana Jones meets the Goonies, minus Stephen Spielberg's expert direction. I'll sum up this movie in two words: Johnny Depp.",1075852800,3,1042,4.826815642458101
1492799,5,B00005JM5E,"I also praise this movie. It was well thought out and well executed. Nothing could be better than watching a really good Disney movie. I'm a big fan of Johnny Depp and this movie is one of his greatest movie that he's ever done.

 Their makeup was extremely well done because I couldn't tell if it was really Johnny Depp or not. The pirates are great. Their makeup is incredible. They actually look like real pirates sailing the Caribbean. If you want a great movie to watch for the weekend or forever, this is the one.",1075766400,,519,4.395833333333333
1492800,5,B00005JM5E,I loved this movie! I have watched it three times now. Johnny Depp steals the show! I didn't even recognize him when I saw the movie in the theatre. The movie was fast moving and just like the Disney ride. I am hoping for a sequel to come out soon.,1075680000,,248,3.98
1492801,4,B00005JM5E,"The plucky daughter of a British governor and a local blacksmith take on the blackest of black-hearted pirates in this Disney action flick that's inspired by (and riffs on) the famous Disney ride.  William Turner (Orlando Bloom) is just a boy when he's fished out of the sea, his ship blown to pieces after an attack by the cruel crew of the accursed ""Black Pearl"".  Thought an innocent victim when first spotted that day by young Elizabeth Swann (eventually played by Keira Knightley), Turner wears a curious pendant - a skull-marked dubloon.  Elizabeth hides the dubloon, sure that the officious Captain Norrington will hang the boy as a pirate if the coin is found on his neck.  Years later, Elizabeth is beautiful young woman still obsessed with piracy, while Turner has become a blacksmith on the tropical royal colony they both call home.  As a lowly blacksmith, Turner can only pine silently for Elizabeth and work his frustrations out by practicing swordplay (3 hours daily).  Then the pirates, led by the thoroughly evil Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) appear.  They sack Port Royale, fixated on Turner's dubloon, and carry away both it and Elizabeth.  As the Royal Navy prepares a rescue mission, Elizabeth learns the dark secret of the Black Pearl's crew - how it was cursed by its plunder of Aztec gold to an existence of life-in-death (gorily rendered in CGI).
At this point, this sounds like another lame-brained idea for a Disney movie, or a misfire attempt to reinvigorate the swashbuckler movie thought lost at sea after two film adaptations of ""Pirates of Penzance"" in the early 1980's, a Roman Polanski flick from 1986, and ""Cutthroat Island"" all flopped.  Instead, the script tosses in Jack Sparrow - a sun-fried pirate driven slightly loopy after being marooned on a remote island years earlier by Barbossa.  Played by Johnny Depp (wearing more eye-shadow than Boy George), Sparrow is a wonder - part hero, part comic relief.  We never know what he's going to do next (neither does he), nor whether he will prove to be the worst pirate you've ever seen or the greatest pirate you ever will know.  Depp gives Sparrow some great mannerisms and a vicious accent (like Mr. Scott from Star Trek after one-too many Saurian Brandies) to go with his fun lines.  The joke is that his tropical-madness makes him the clearest-minded character in the whole movie.  Also great is Rush who makes Barbossa both formidable and laughable at the same time.
BUT IS IT FOR KIDS?  My 6 year-older was dying to see it, though it's borderline appropriate.  There's a heavy atmosphere of violence (reaching heights during several action sequences spaced throughout the movie).  The CGI that turns the crew of the Pearl into spectral wraiths is scary - though a fast and deft scene in which Elizabeth first sees them in their moonlit glory is actually quite funny (and reminds you of the movie's roots as a ride).  The overt violence (slashing and strangling) actually happens off the edge of the screen (just like in ""Holes"") though kids will know what's going on.  (The producers were probably afraid that they were verging into territory of the ""A-Team"" and figured that they needed to make a point that vicious pirates actually hurt people.)  That aside, this was a rollicking good film, and a reminder for his fans that there's less and less that Depp can't do.",1075680000,4,3355,4.862917398945519

I had heard enough praise about it to be confident enough to buy it without seeing it first. This movie had everything that I wanted it to have. Orlando Bloom who I liked already was great and he was played a stupid character but he managed to save the part. Johnny Depp was hilarious with his role as Captain Jack Sparrow. This was Disney's first PG-13 movie in the U.S and I hope not the last. I've grown out of Disney but I was impressed. This is a must see and a must buy.,1075593600,,608,3.9918032786885247

I saw it twice in theaters, I was dragged persay, and I found it unbearable to get through the second time.  At first, I wasn't real into seeing a movie of pirates.  It just isn't my thing.  People said the movie was humorous, but really I didn't get any of the humor in the movie.  The best part was the end with the monkey at the rolling credit.  However, according to my friends it was one of the best movies of the  year, so don't take my opinion for it.  My friend has her brain into writing fan fictions of pirates.  I don't know if the movie was so wonderful because of the hunkalicious Johnny Depp, who I don't find very handsome, or what.  However, the actors did a good job, Johnny and Orlando, and any female will start drooling over the presence of these two males.  I didn't though.  They just aren't my type.",1075593600,3,948,4.165745856353591
1492898,2,B00005JM5E,"Okay, this review is going to make me extremely unpopular, but some dissenting opinion of this film is required, I feel.  Back when ""Pirates"" was in theatres, the trailors gave me no compulsion to watch the film.  However, so many of my (female) friends insisted that this was the greatest movie ever.  So eventually I went to see it, and was quite disappointed.
If one looks at other movies I've reviewed for amazon, you would see that I'm generally a very generous and easy-to-please moviewatcher.  However, I was not overly impressed by ""Pirates"".  The movie was not terrible; I had an ""okay"" time watching it.  However, I really didn't see what set it apart from the next piece of action-packed, cheesy special effect-ridden Hollywood fluff like ""Hulk"" or ""Daredevil"".  I left the theatre thinking, ""that was it?  What was so great about it?""  Some girl is going to bash me on the head and yell, ""Johnny Depp, you fool!""  True, I admit that Depp's performance was mildly amusing at times, but oscar-worth stuff it ain't.  I find it to be around the same calibre as something from Jack Black, but no one is nominating Jack for an oscar.
The plot of the movie was...absurd at best.  The special effects weren't anything groundbreaking, and added with the plot, it produced a very cheesy movie, the kind you watch once and forget about.  Personally I felt that, despite the movie offically being a comedy, it took its childish and ridiculous premise way too seriously.
My feeling is that this film attained its level of popularity primarily due to the ""sex appeal"" of the film, particularly for the female audience.  My female friends insist that Johnny Depp is some kind of irresistible sex machine, and the addition Orlando Bloom is just icing on the Depp cake.  However, being a heterosexual male, the antics of Depp and Bloom do dreadfully little for me.  Keira Knightly, although objectively a pretty girl, is really not my type, and furthermore did not create a distinguishing and memorable character for me.  All she seemed to do was to get kidnapped, then do some obligatory ""girl power"" fighting towards the end.  So basically, there was really just nothing for me.
In the end the only character I really liked was that very honourable commodore who didn't get the girl and gracefully stepped aside to allow Bloom and Knightly's characters to be together.  That guy earns my respect.
In my opinion, this film was standard Saturday-night faire, not terrible to watch, but well-described by words like ""forgettable"" and ""undistinguishing"".  And now I must hide myself as many girls will seek my death for such ""blasphemy"" against the sex-god Johnny Depp's movie.",1075507200,9,2670,4.878048780487805

But, what the hell? This was never meant to be an accurately observed swashbuckler, so let's just go with the flow!
Slightly over-long perhaps, with some rather inane dialogue between the dramatic set pieces, but redeemed by truly magnificent special effects and some outrageously funny visual gags (sadly, one of the best is only found on the deleted scenes disk). A bit derivative in places - including a complete rip-off of the assembling the crew scene, stolen shamelessly from the brilliant Deathstalker II (the dwarf bit), but there's enough original material to satisfy most punters here. Human interraction with zombies has probably never before been more convincingly portrayed. The skeletal monkey was a gem!
Plenty of extras on the DVD 2-disk set, the ""Moonlight Serenade"" scene progression feature being particularly interesting, makes this pretty good value for money.
My 13 year old son fell asleep before the end, but I quite enjoyed it!

 I think this may be Johnny Depp's best performance, and to think that he actually had to convince Disney, who was about to have him replaced, to trust his instincts on how to portray Cap'n Jack Sparrow. I also liked Orlando Bloom's portrayal of Will Turner, the seemingly well-bred son of ""Bootstrap Bill"", the notorious pirate.

 The story line is also fresh for a pirate movie - not just a lot of plundering, pillaging and swashbuckling. I won't give it all away, but the whole ""crew of the damned ship"" concept really worked for me.

 The DVD also has some pretty nice featurettes, including interesting material about the CGIs for the haunted ship and crew, and the ships that were used in the movie.

 The best thing of all - my kids love it. They watched it over and over for about a week and spent their time in-between viewings talking about it.

Perhaps my pre-conceived notion that a movie based upon a ride at Disneyland couldn't possibly be good, but it was! Not only that, but it was great! While I wasn't impressed with the movie as a special effects film the acting and dialogue of this film were simply enchanting. Johnny Depp was simply amazing showing off his brilliance as an actor capable of many different kind of rolls, its little wonder he has so many fans across both genders, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I can be counted among them! Orlando Bloom did amazing as well; proving there is life for him after Lord of the Rings, and Kierra Knightly.... was she really only 17 when the film was made? She acts with a maturity well beyond her years, possessing both elegant beauty, and extreme talent. Such amazing talent, and such effort was put into this film that it was more than apparent that the movie was a labor of love for the crew. The only problem with the film that I have is a political side note, in that I am an advocate of anti-piracy efforts, the ""moral of the story"" at the end of the film was kinda poorly worded. I know the idea was to have the law decide to overlook the ""crime"" because the end result was good, however the film writers seemed to inadvertently endorse piracy which is a huge problem costing several entertainment and software industries billions (software companies loose a total of just under 12 billion every year alone). It makes me wonder how many pirated copies of this film are out there, or if the writers would have written the final scenes if they understood how dire the situation has really gotten. I'm okay with making pirates the heroes, this movie was simply put wonderful, I enjoyed it immensely, but the ending seemed a bit like a pro-piracy lecture to an extent. Politics aside, I am eagerly awaiting the sequel, and keeping my fingers crossed for the return of Johnny Depp in his amazing role in this film.",1075420800,,2127,4.498708010335918

IT'S BASED OFF A FREAKIN' 50 YEAR OLD THEME PARK RIDE FOR CRYIN' OUT LOUD!!  I would like this movie if it weren't for those dweebs who worship this movie, so it wouldn't be annoying! But of course, they wouldn't shut up about it, and i still drives me through the roof. Even my friend (i won't mention names) keeps repeating those stupid lines from that movie. AAHHHHH!!! It drives me insane! Even THE SUN newspaper, the newspaper that literally hates all movies gave it 3 1/2 stars. I can't take ittt!! Maybe i'm the only one who thinks this, but this movie is the most over-rated and irritaing movie yet. This review would be much more positive if people would just treat it like an actual movie, instead of a 'cinematic masterwork' or something.

1492989,1,B00005JM5E,This is one of the absolute worst films I have ever seen.  Gore Verbinski has never made a good movie.  Johnny Depp (who is one of my all time favorite actors) gives one of the worst performances I have ever seen.  How could this film make as much money as it did?  And why is Depp nominated for a best actor oscar?  What is wrong with the world that so many people got sucked into this bloated mess?  I can't believe how awful this film truly is...Embarassing in so many ways.  The only good thing in the film is when it ends...Then its finally over.,1075420800,8,551,4.190476190476191
1492990,4,B00005JM5E,"Without Johnny Depp being so amazing, this movie would not have the impact it does. He played his role flawlessly and I doubt anyone could have played his role as a thief and a pirate better. He does an amazing accent as well.
Aside from him, the movie keeps you attentive at all times - you are never bored, always entertained... and the humor is very tongue in cheek, which is nice if you like a little intellectual humor from a boat thief.
The computer graphics of the ghosts and zombies was VERY realistic. You could see a lot of time was put into making this movie. Nothing was left untouched. I have great respect for everything in this -- simply because in every scene your eyes are wandering all over the screen to just inhale everything you are watching. It is a fantastic movie!
The only reason I give this 4 out of 5 stars is because of predictability. Although there are some moments where you don't know what to expect... pretty much the whole movie you know what's around the corner. But at least what you see is good.
I'd recommend getting it for your dvd library!",1075420800,3,1079,4.42713567839196

1493064,5,B00005JM5E,"There have been a lot of half-crazed movie characters in film history, you know the one; the kind of vaguely insane person that the movie truly revolves around, with the other characters only there to provide stark contrast with their recognizably sane posture.  They're also there to wonder aloud to themselves and each other, ""What's the matter with him?""  To which someone usually responds, ""I don't know, but there's something about him that I like.""  The thing about those movies (a lot of them came out of the 80's and early 90's, I know because in school we all imitated them), was the the core of those movies was the zany character exploration, and that was just about it.  See what kind of situations we can cook up and then throw this crazed, witty personae in there and see what happens.
What's different about Pirates of the Caribbean, and Jack Sparrow in particular, is that the world he inhabits gave birth to him.  In the crazed personae movie--the nut-job seems to come out of nowhere, completely unexpected, which is half the fun but also half the shortcoming.  In Pirates of the Carribean, we expect Jack Sparrow to come sailing out of the horizon and to suddenly arrive in that world, and what a world!
I think what lends Sparrow such credibility is his mixture of characterization.  Yes, he's wild and I suppose ""free,"" but there are moments where he gets serious (saluting the dead pirates), moments when he has to act and can pull through (like jumping in to save Elizabeth), moments where he has to educate (telling Will Turner the truth about his father).  When this happens, we give the character Sparrow something we don't give the hollow, crazed personae; respect.  Give Johnny Depp all the credit for being able to switch between these modes as well; being serious and respectable while maintaining the aura of Jack Sparrow; that he'll stick his tongue out at us and run off with the gold at any moment, but not without his effects.
The world of ""Black Pearl"" is lush and surprising.  I didn't expect to believe the world of pirates, where all the exsists is ocean and the few ports that you can sail to.  Come to think of it, we only really see three locales during the whole movie, and the rest of it is on water.  How'd they pull that off?  My favorite scene is in the pirate pub where the bar-fight is perpetual; Jack Sparrow and his cohort (can't remember his name) sit and talk about ports, treasures, old pirates, schemes, boats, etc. all in the warm glow of candles and wood as they chug ale.  A pirate's life for me!
Geoffery Rush, brilliant as ever.  When he says, ""Too long have I been without the taste of food or the comfort of a woman"" I believe him.  The man is a pirate outright, but in his eyes you can see the years of torment on a man from the curse piling up on him slowly.  Notice too how he rolls his eyes perfectly when he's at the moment of breaking the curse, and somehow Jack Sparrow convinces him not to.  How?  Maybe ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" is really how Jack Sparrow has dogged Barbossa his whole career.
The supporting cast is good, even Orlando Bloom who is still in Legolas mode.  Even though he played up Will Turner nicely as a bright-eyed, talented, somewhat intense young man (who has serious anxieties about his lineage, but why not?  It would bar him from his chances of Elizabeth), I did keep expecting him to jump up and go, ""He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn!""  He does have a great moment where he jumps onto a ship with Sparrow and goes, ""Aye, avast!"" to which he's promptly laughed at.",1075248000,4,3558,4.5265625
1493065,5,B00005JM5E,"Having been disappointed many times by big blockbuster movies that, er, don't really hit the spot, I anticipated PoTC to be another movie to enjoy a bit then forget. It was, after all, branded as a goody-goody Disney movie with a bunch of heartthrobs casted in it. Big deal. How much can an undead pirate ensemble hold our attention and keep us in our seats?
Well.
Directed by 'The Ring' man Verbinski, produced by big time Bruckheimer, scripted by the writers of Shrek, and casted with eccentrics like the long-lost Depp, PoTC was a project that called upon an unusual combination of dedicated adventurers and artists who unabashedly engineered the movie to the extreme, purely for the audience's enjoyment. I mean, Johnny Depp with real gold teeth and eyeliner, and Geoffrey Rush with a pesky monkey on his shoulder? Different, indeed.  Not to mention those incredible supporting characters and outstanding set details that would keep your eyes glued on the screen.
And why was PoTC so great? Because the people behind the movie simply delivered their all, man. PoTC is romance, humor, adventure, suspense, and horror, all in one package, perfect for the cynical, the innocent, and those in between.  I was surprised to like it, but I completely did.
(Oh. And, I'm not the only one who has been surprised--and impressed. PoTC garnered FIVE Oscar nominations today, including a Best Actor nomination for Depp's, shall we say, unforgettable savvy performance. Trust the Academy on this. )",1075161600,,1488,5.020242914979757

Barbossa played by Geoffrey Rush, complicating things are the Elizabeth Swann played by beautiful newcomer Keira Knightley and the man she (secretly) loves Will Turner played by the amazingly Johnny Depp like Orlando Bloom. This movie is pure popcorn fun and true escapism, and it is a fun ride! If you haven't got this movie yet, go buy it now!",1075161600,,634,4.427350427350428

While I settled in with a magazine, it was not long before my reading was forgotten as I was absorbed into this swashbuckling tale.  Complete with adventure, mystery, romance (a spitfire heroine!), and a quest for treasure, this movie has all the right elements for a pirate film--and exceptionally well-done cinematography from Disney.  Not for your faint of heart, the film has some gruesome scenes of cursed dead pirates fighting their breathing brethren, so smaller children may be scared.

1493070,4,B00005JM5E,"""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  Johnny Depp as the charming yet unwashed Jack Sparrow was great;he really became his character and it almost makes you wish that Jack was real. Geoffrey Rush ( Captain Barbossa) was excellent, and he did a fine job being the ruthless and bloodthirsty pirate he was supposed to be. Keira Knightley ( Elizabeth) and Orlando Bloom ( Will) were SO CUTE together;their on-screen chemistry was phenomenal. Too bad they're not a real couple... he's with Kate Bosworth. Blaaaa =(.
Overall the scenery and special effects looked like a lot of work was put into them...but it took me a while to figure out where the movie took place ( guess the accents threw me off). The director, Gore Verbinski, has my highest compliments. You too, Mr. Bruckheimer, I've never been a huge fan of your movies, props to you on this one.
The only real problems that bothered me were the references to the Pirate's Code--what the heck?!--that was never fully explained, the corset gag that got a bit tired after a while, and in a place or two the movie dragged.
The battle and fight scenes (especially the one between Will and Jack in the blacksmith shop) were very well-done without feeling too watered down. But let us remember that this is a Disney movie. I'm glad that it wasn't too violent and there was very little, if any, bad language.
And what Disney movie is complete without a killer soundtrack?The music really fits the movie and compliments its goings-on. For every scene there is a great song playing in the background; it adds to the mood. The CD soundtrack disappointed me by being only 43 minutes long...but that's a whole nother review!!
Conclusion: See this movie! If you haven't seen it, you've got problems! If you have, see it again...I've seen it at least 15 times and it's still not old.",1075161600,2,1896,4.642857142857143

Geoffrey Rush as Barbosa was excellent as was the entire supporting cast. I am sure the people who didn't like this movie are the same ones who find Adam Sandler hilarious, Ben Stiller a knee slapping wonder, and Eddie Murphy bathroom scenes brilliantly witty.

It does an outstanding job of creating the scenery and ambiance of what, in my mind, the real pirates would be like.  Of course it is a bit picturesque, but that is exactly what the ride is like and the movie, as a spin off from the ride at Disney, achieves its aim well.
Depp is very good as Jack Sparrow, the shipless captain.  Depp plays a rocker type pirate, kind of a modern version of what a true good hearted pirate would be like.  On the other side, the cursed crew of the Black Pearl ship, which were condemned to eternal damnation in search of a stolen treasure.  Nevermind the usual good vs evil clichs, but Depp is smart and convincing as the good pirate, while Geoffrey Rush is very good as the evil Capt Barbossa.  The special effects are also a highlight, especially of the undead pirates' images.
Overall it is a fun movie, especially for the scenes that resemble (sometimes exactly trace) the images from the ride at Disney.  For example, there is a scene of Depp in prison trying to lure a dog to give him the key to his cell for a bone.

Keira Knightley is a wonderful actress, she plays the role of Elizabeth almost flawlessly. Also, this movie has the best fight scene ever, a sword fight between Jack Sparrow and Will Turner in the blacksmith shop. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.

In watching Johnny Depp prance and frolic through PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN I wasn't sure if I was watching a swashbuckler or the next segment of ""Martha Stewart Living.""  I didn't know if the next sword fight would devolve into another rendition of Rocky Horror's ""Let's Do the Time Warp Again,"" or if Depp's character would magically morph into the latest manifestation of Divine (with braided goatee, of course).
Yes, this movie has action, special effects, witty barbs, but to what end?  The characters are as one-dimensional as the robots on the Disney ride of the same name, and after the first fifteen minutes or so the mayhem and disarray become tiring.  And yes, Virginia, there is a plot, but it's as invisible as the air we breathe.
PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN also stars a wooden Orlando Bloom (sans the Legolas blonde hair) and a nefarious Geoffrey Rush.  The makeup sure looked better on Keira Knightley than it did on Depp, but what's a silly pirate boy to do?

I never said a word or looked away from the screen.  My daughter asked me if I was alright. That is how still and fascinated I was.  Buy this right now!!!!!!!!",1074643200,4,1072,4.384615384615385

1493293,5,B00005JM5E,"Best:
1) It's an exciting, epic swashbuckling adventure that's often very funny. The pirates are scary-looking, but generally hilarious in their antics.
2) The special effects are fantastic and cutting-edge. You'll have to watch certain scenes in slow motion to really appreciate the quality and seamlessness.
3) It's so jam-packed with sights and sounds you'll need to play it several times to witness everything.
4) It's more fun than the Disney ride because there's more happening, it lasts longer and you don't have to wait in line (ha).
5) There are so many special features you'll get sick of it all before the options run out.
Worst:
1) Johnny Depp's drunken English accent gets a bit tedious after awhile (but often makes his funny one-liners come across better).
2) It's hard to keep track of what's going on at any given moment, especially when the fighting action gets crazy.
Recommendation:
It's all good fun with a lot of rewatch value - and Disney's retail price is unusually reasonable. If you don't love this movie now, you might someday - so get it just in case.",1074643200,,1079,4.837837837837838
1493294,5,B00005JM5E,"It's not the greatest movie ever, but it really does rate high. Why?
1.  The special effects. Which almost never are a reason for me to rate a movie highly. The effects are not that great. The way they are used is what's so special.
2.  The way they treat violence and sex. How can a PG-13 movie be a family movie? When the subject matter is treated with . . . discretion. For example, we aren't treated to the blood spurting decapitation scenes, even though the primary weapon is the sword. But we know that plenty of blood is being spilled.
3.  Johnny Depp continues to be an actor first, not a model. Ditto for Orlando Bloom. They, and lots of others, are perfect in their roles.
All in all, an unexpected surprise. And good fun. If you're looking for an action/romance, this one won't disappoint.",1074556800,2,800,4.428571428571429

I loved all of it from the CGI to the sword battles between all the players to the happy ending. Even the booms of cannons and the destruction was all done well.

1493389,3,B00005JM5E,"I know most critics and fans love this movie. I enjoyed it myself, but I didn't think it was as good as most people have told me it is. Maybe it's because of my hatred of Disney for screwing up Pearl Harbor. I have never really liked Disney live-action movies. I am a huge fan of Beauty & The Beast, Little Mermaid, Lion King, etc. I just can't think of one Disney film that I have liked that has NOT been animated. Now, I know that Armageddon & Pearl Harbor were produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, but Disney was pulling the strings. I liked Armageddon quite a bit. I would rather be thrown into a pool of acid than watch Pearl Harbor again. But, those were not looked at as 'Disney' movies. This one is, however.
The plot is realtively simple......a pirate named Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) loses his ship, The Black Pearl,  when he is overthrown by his mate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and he is left for dead on an island. Later he ends up in Port Royal when it happens to be attacked by Barbossa using the Black Pearl. Along the way, Jack meets a blacksmith named Will (Orlando Bloom) who also happens to be quite gifted with a blade. He is in love with the Govenor's daughter, Elizabeth (the HOT Keira Knightly), and wants to marry her. Barbossa's goons then kidnap Elizabeth and a quest is on. Jack Sparrow wants his ship back and Will is coming along to rescue Elizabeth.
It's not a deep story, but it's well done. Johnny Depp steals the movie. His portrayl of Jack Sparrow is amazing. He acts like he is drunk the whole film, and has all the good lines. His presence on-screen is obvious and he is one of my two favorite actors (Edward Norton being the other). I haven't seen Keira Knightly in anything before this movie, but I certainly hope I see more of her. Yes she is unbelivably hot, but she is a pretty good actress too. While her performance here is not oscar-worthy, it hopefully will lead to more dramatic roles. Orlando Bloom does NOT shoot one arrow this whole flick. Now that I got that out of the way, he plays off Depp perfectly. He is the nice, heroic figure that this kind of film needs. He doesn't get the humorous lines that Depp or Rush receive, but he holds his own. Geoffrey Rush looks like he is having a blast with this role. While being a villian, he never really becomes hateable. He has that 'Disney-like' villian quality, but adding his own twist. Don't go expecting Dustin Hoffman from Hook. Which is a good thing.
This is also the first film I have seen that Gore Verbinski has directed. I must say, it's refreshing to see a Bruckhemier film that is not directed by Michael Bay. That is not a knock on Bay, it's just that you don't need a severe case of ADD to watch this movie. Verbinski doesn't really do anything that stands out, in my mind, but he takes what could have been a HUGE flop and made is a HUGE summer hit.
A sequal is already being discussed. All summer I had to hear about this movie, and now I know why. It's a good movie, but it's not the best of the summer. X-Men 2 & Termintor 3 were much better 'summer blockbuster' films, in my opinion. I thought this flick would suck, but it actually ended up surprising me. I would definately recommend checking it out.
This DVD is loaded with special features. I won't go into all of them, since you can just scroll up and look at it. Here is an overall look though....deleted scenes, blooper reel, commentaries, documantaries, featurettes, trailers and more. If you take away 'The Two Towers' extended edition DVD, this is the most packed one of the year.",1074384000,2,3547,4.407012195121951

1493393,5,B00005JM5E,"This film was great fun to watch.  I thought it to be a film which could have been rated PG, but that's not my area to judge.  Anyhow, Pirates of the Carribbean, starring Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and the beautiful Keira Knightley is an adventurous film full of fun and laughs.
The infamous pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), seeks to steal back his ship, The Black Pearl, in which he was overthrown and deserted on an island from the time before.  Sparrow's encounter with the British that looked to be his end, soon turned to be his ticket to redemption.  The pirates who sail the Black Pearl are cursed with a spell that makes them immortal, but full of suffering.  Wil Turner (Orlando Bloom) becomes the key to everyone's fate, as he joins Captain Jack Sparrow in a quest to rescue his love, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley).
Gore Verbinski, director, does a marvelous job directing this movie and deserves recognition.  The film was well presented and easy to view.  Truly a film I would recommend for anyone, even as a family movie.  One of the year's BEST films overall!",1074297600,6,1089,4.6947368421052635

The DVD sold millions worldwide and has now won the People's Choice Award for Best Movie.

The comedic timing is dead-on.  And all the characters are well-played.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.,1074124800,2,387,4.686567164179104
1493483,5,B00005JM5E,"As the lead line says, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is an enormously fun movie to watch!  I made the mistake of not catching this one when it was in the theaters but have quite happily made up for it with this wonderful DVD.  For those in my age bracket, like myself, this should bring you back to the good old days on ABC and the plethora of wonderful Disney movies that were shown on Sunday evenings.
This grandiose movie also brings to mind the wonder and skill of script writers and movie producers who could take a look at a ride at a Disney theme park and come up with such a wonderful script and full scale production such as this highly enjoyable movie.  I believe it was Jerry Bruckheimer that said in one of the special features that Hollywood had moved away from big pirate movies because they became too expensive to make but with the advent of the CGI it became a lot more feasible.  That being said, it's great that they've done so and hopefully we'll see more, great pirate movies down the road, because as a general rule, they're very fun movies to watch.
High praise goes to Johnny Depp for his performance in this wonderful film.  We already knew that he had a great range of acting skills to draw from but his rendition of Captain Jack Sparrow is utterly magnificent.  I believe this is the first film I've seen Geoffrey Rush in and he does an outstanding job in this film.  On to Orlando Bloom, where some may have thought his performance in ""The Lord of the Rings"" films might've have been the highlight of his career, think again, his performance in this film is just as outstanding and this incredible young actor can definitely be counted upon to fulfill the lead role in many a film to come!  Keira Knightley, what a beautiful and talented young actress she is, she performs quite well in this film and it will be great to see where she goes from here.
Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Gore Verbinski, both of which are responsible for some very influential films in the past; ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" was more or less destined to do well in the theaters and on the DVD sales racks with people such as these leading the way.  The score for the film is outright perfect, bringing one back to the many pirate movies of old yet being updated and greatly enhancing this wonderful film.
The Premise:
A young girl is on a Royal Navy ship with her father, the Governor of one of the British colonies in the Caribbean when, in the fog, she spots a young boy floating on wreckage in the water.  The sailors soon recover the child from the water and they soon also discover a ship that is in the process of sinking.  As she is looking after the young boy, she discovers a pirate's pendant on him and as she stands up and looks around she sees a torn and tattered ships sailing away...
What follows from there is most certainly a wonderful pirate movie that is fun for the whole family to watch!  I highly recommend this film to any and all who are fans of pirate movies or more succinctly, fans of well written and performed, entertaining movies!  {ssintrepid}

1493486,5,B00005JM5E,"This is a wonderful movie for anyone to watch. I was especially pleased with the absence of profanity (only 2 or 3 instances the entire movie).  Captain Jack Sparrow is a pirate who passes himself off to be incredible stupid, but who in reality is the smartest pirate you will ever see. It was very interesting to me to watch his thought process throughout the movie.  In addition, to Sparrow's antics there is the romance between Will and Elizabeth which is complicated by both Commodore Norington and Captain Barbossa.
Of all the supporting characters, my personal favorite is Panchetti who gives an eye-popping performance. He is fun to watch with all of his antics and they are just the right amount to enhance the story line but not detract from it.
I love the 2nd DVD that comes with this package.  It has a wide variety of items that include Jerry Bruckheimer's still shots taken from the set, historical background information, deleted scenes (3 of which I think should have made it to the film), interactive areas if you can watch the DVD on your PC, and the original Disney special of the opening of the ride.  I found it very interesting to watch the Disney special after watching the movie and seeing what all made it to the movie.
I have talked to people in all stages of life that love this movie: pre-teens, teens, young adults, adults and even senior citizens. If you are looking for something to appeal to a lot of people, this is it.

The extra features were not disappointing -- though the commentary with Gore Verbinski and Johnny Depp gets boring, the commentary with Keira and Jack Davenport is funny, and I particularly liked the included documentary, the ""fly on the set"" feature (really cool if you're interested in how movies get made, like I am), and the ""diary of a pirate.""
Overall, Johnny Depp is fantastic, the movie is rousing and has a great soundtrack, and if you're hedging over whether to buy it, the DVD extras make it worthwhile. My only complaint? Not enough Keira Knightley (sigh).",1073952000,3,755,4.684210526315789
1493549,4,B00005JM5E,"Upon the suggestion of my 11 year old neice, we purchased this DVD for our collection.  It is her ""all-time favorite movie."" -I can see why!

As the movie starts out, we come to understand that the Governor's daughter is fascinated by pirates. They rescue a young boy from a burning pirate ship - the movie gives hints that he may be a pirate himself. This sets up the rest of the movie.

It is an easy to follow story of a pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow(Depp), on a mission to get his ship (The Black Pearl) back from a fellow pirate who committed mutany taking it away. This pirate and his crew also gained the curse of the undead. They are unable to be killed (as they are already ""dead""!), and unable to taste food, feel things, etc. like normal humans. Very interesting - and the special effects are great!  Depp has many good lines here!

I don't want to give it all away, so I will stop there! Hopefully I have peaked your interest enough to convince you to invest in this one.

It is not a ""scary"" movie, but I did have to explain some things to my 4 & 5 yr old daughters. (They also enjoyed the movie!) I recommend this movie to all ages! It is entertaining and keeps your interest throughout!

I can give this some credit for the action, but there is really no plot to this film. Johnny Deep is the only one who can act in this film. It's about pirates looking for gold so they can break a curse. Thats somthing a nine year old can come up with. The days Diesny had good idea's are long gone.

1493553,5,B00005JM5E,"Pirates of the Caribbean simply exceeded every expectation I had.  As a fan of pirate history and stories, I knew I would go see the movie.  However, I'm not a fan of marketing tie-ins, and figured that a movie based on a Disney ride would lack in all aspects other than Pirate Ships Shooting Cannons.
Instead, I (and all viewers) were treated to a rollicking, humorous, and unapologetically fun film.  Johnny Depp is the rock around which this movie is crafted.  His captain Jack Sparrow is a loony buccaneer down on his luck, looking to steal a ship and go after his former crew.  Meanwhile, blacksmith's apprentice Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) crafts swords, practices with them, and burns with love for the daughter of the Governor of Port Royal (Keira Knightley).  When an ancient curse calls the legendary pirate vessel the Black Pearl to come and sack Port Royal, the adventures are underway.
I'll say no more than that about the plot; if you haven't seen it, you deserve to enjoy the movie spoiler-free.  Johnny Depp really makes the film with his quirky staggering and wide-eyed mania, slurring and smirking his way through gleefully cheesy piratical dialogue.  Bloom and Knightley are excellent counterpoints, being both virtuous and yet intrigued by piracy.
The DVD is stacked with extra features, including deleted scenes, featurettes, blooper reels, and more.  One of the more enjoyable bits is a documentary of sorts filmed by ""Pintel"" actor Lee Arenburg.  Arenburg takes a hand-held camera with him on set, and gives the viewer a neat look at both the filming of the movie and the cast and crew at play on location.
The ""Fly on the set"" featurette is fun, too, as it lets the viewer watch from the side as certain scenes are slowly crafted from initial blocking up to and including pyro and falling sets.
The special features add even more to what was already a movie worth owning.  If you like action, adventure, and humor all wrapped up in a package that almost all ages can appreciate, get this DVD.",1073865600,3,2016,4.797687861271676

but i had forgotten about johnny depp.  you must have faith in depp.  this guy MAKES every movie that he's in.  name a bad johnny depp movie...quick...can't do it, can you.  well, if you think long enough you can, but he's good enough to add at least some interest to anything he's in.  so there we go, a quirky movie it is.
you forget it has anything to do with the Evil Empire (disney, that is) when depp is on screen with his keith richards slurring, eye makeup and gold teeth.  i read somewhere that depp's daughter thinks her dad's a real pirate.  hell, so do i.
so if you're against summer blockbusters on principle, like i am, bend the rule a bit and see this one.  it's pretty good.",1073865600,,869,4.3354037267080745
1493555,4,B00005JM5E,"I have to say, when I heard that Disney was making a film called ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" I thought ""what a cheezy self-promotion"" (because of Disney's ride by the same name).  Then I saw actual previews and I thought, ""OH NO!  The action looks good!  But I don't want to see this movie!""  Well, I saw it. And greatly to my surprise, enjoyed it!
As a matter of context, let me say that there are a few things I like in a movie:  (1) something fun, (2) preferrably funny, and (3) a bonus if it has action.  This movie has all of these--and a little romantic interest to boot.  If you like these things in a movie---buy it or rent it!!

I am sorry I dismissed it so easily.  When I rented the DVD, I knew it was going to be fun when Depps character entered the story!  Magestic music.  Looking stalwart standing from what looks like the main mast of a ship!  Then it turns out to be a small boat!  It inturn sinks as he approaches the dock to which he calmly steps on!  The film is fun, the cast is excellent and you can tell they had a fun making the film.
Do watch for scenes that are based from the ride!  There are several!
Overall I love the film and the DVD is a great addition to the collection!  This is a film that you can watch several times and not get bored by it!

The story gets you stuck to your seat until the last minute.
Pirates of the Caribbean is a great movie.  I received a DVD player for Chritmas and didn't have any DVD to play on it yet.  I hadn't seen the movie in theater prior, but heard the best of it.  I don't usually buy movies that I haven't seen on TV or in theater first, but I took a chance, and wasn't disappointed.  I saw the movie last night, and this afternoon, and might watch it again tonight ;o)",1073779200,,632,4.277310924369748
1493649,5,B00005JM5E,"Pirates of the Caribean was not a movie I was really dying to see. Being Im not an 8 yr old girl, I wasn't very interested in anything produced by disney, I was much more interested in seeing Terminator 3, The Hulk, or one of many dramas that were out at the time. I ended up seeing it at the theater however due to my girlfriend's persistence. As it turned out the movie was nothing like I expected it to be, and I really enjoyed it.
The movie is loosley based (inspired would be a better word) around the ride that bears the same name at disney land. The time frame for the movie is nicely depicted throughout as being authentic enough to not cause any noticable historical inacuracies. The historical setting however is really just a convenient backdrop to tell an adventure story based on pirates. johnny Depp is the star, and does a pretty good job playing his role as a good guy pirate. Of course there is plenty of reference to treasure, ghost stories, and other good stuff.
The movie successfully combines various levels of enjoyment into one cohesive experience suitable for the whole family. Part ghost story, part adventure movie, part fairy tale, and part comedy - this one really does have something to apeal to almost anyone in one way or another. The director succeeded in keeping a light hearted note throughout the movie while adding in some slightly darker elements. I actually believe the moive was the first disney movie to get a PG13 rating, though it's completely harmless in my oppinion. It reminds me much of the indiana jones trilogy (whick actually INVENTED PG13, as temple of doom was considered too ""dark"" to get a PG rating, but not close to warranting an R rating). The goal was obviously to apeal to both kids, teens, and parents a like and create something that everyone could enjoy.
The blending of action/adventure and humor is superb and there are plenty of laugh out loud moments. The action sequences are also well done and the special effects are top notch. This movie has a little of everything, and really is an excelent experience from begining to end. It's mature enough for adults to thuroughly enjoy, but it's suitable enough for even the youngest kids in my oppinion.
All in all, Pirates of the Caribean was one of the biggest surprises I've had at the movies in a long time. I never enjoyed a movie i thought I was going to hate so much. If you're loking for an upbeat, adventure movie with lots of humour that somehow manages not to cross the ""stupidly silly"" line, this is it. I would call it the ""Indiana Jones of the year 2003"".",1073779200,2,2578,4.570194384449244
1493650,4,B00005JM5E,"In a Disney all-family film were no skin (but lots of bones!) is ever shown - which is rather ludicrous in a tropical setting - Jack Sparrow seems to be as jolly and gay as they come. While he battles with young and cute Will Turner, he shows the greatest interest in the youth and takes great care not to wound him, making the encounter last much longer than needed. Before, Jack had not the slightest interest in Elizabeth, the beautiful young girl he just saved from the waters. Later, standing alone on a lost island with that georgous girl, Jack seems attracted only to bottles of rhum. In fact, every few times he meets a woman he knows, she slaps him violently on the face, apparently for unknown manly promesses he did not properly fulfill.
Cap'tain Sparrow has a detached way of dealing with people (except his curteous sympathy for the handsome Will) and things, which he shows by his swaying way of walking and precious sharp-tongued talking which makes him the undisputed Queen of the Carribean. Jack actually appears wearing a crown at the end of the film!
Although Orlando Bloom is utterly handsome and sympathetic (however less inspiring than in his Legolas character), Johnny Depp - who has a long story of complex and outcast characters - easily steals the show. He is absolutely perfect in showing in every way, humour, looks, clothing, heavy mascara, rings and a pronounced taste for jewels, the ambiguous and androgynous personality of unforgettable Jack Sparrow.
This DVD looks absolutely stunning on a 16:9 widescreen TV, however this film is worth seeing mostly for Johnny Depp's performance. Happily enough the clever and handsome actor appears almost in every scene. Bravo Johnny!",1073779200,2,1705,4.903114186851211

It's humorous(thanks to Johnny Depp), visually extraordinary (thanks to stunning computer graphics, Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightley-- did anyone else think she looked like from Star Wars the Episodes?), and an interesting surprising plot.
I usually do not buy DVD's but I believe that Pirates of the Caribbean is a must have!  If you intend on buying a VHS, get a DVD player... now!  There are a ton of extra goodies that come with this DVD.  At least 10 hours of bonus material!  I am not sure if there is a full screen version, but the widescreen (almost always is) the best version because the edges aren't cut off and you get to see the director's vision, stunning scenery, and cream of the crop computer graphic imaging.
Ok, enough of this cheerleading.  If you didn't like what I wrote so far, let me tell you this- you won't regret buying this DVD!  Enjoy... I know I will over and over again!

1493654,4,B00005JM5E,"It seemed to me the movie was written in two halves. The first 45 minutes I thought was cleverly written and witty. It was fast paced and the action was not that absurd. But the last half of the movie was just a complete turn around. The story was going at slow paced filled with nothing but unnecessarily long fights. The only reason I actually watched it was for Depp's performance. The ending was predictable and fizzled. It clashed the wonderful movie I saw in the first half.
The plot is so-so. It starts out with the girl, Elizabeth, (Knightley), sailing to America where she meets William Turner (Bloom) when his ship is attacked by pirates. He is taken onboard and she takes his gold coin because she thinks that he was a pirate and doesn't want to see him killed. It jumps to her and she is around what 18. She is going to the Commodore where he is most likely going to propose. Capitan Jack Sparrow (Depp) comes to town on a sinking ship and is trying to steal another ship. When Elizabeth falls from a tower and he saves her. They, the British, try to hang him but he escapes. Sparrow meets Turner where they have a long fight. He is captured and goes to jail. The black pearl attacks. Elizabeth is captured. Turner, in love with Elizabeth, asks Sparrow to go and find her. He agrees. Turner frees Sparrow and they ingeniously steal a ship. The story then goes to somewhere where they find a crew. We then find out that the Black Pearl's crew is cursed and can't die or feel the pleasures of life. They stole the curse gold of the Aztecs and have to return it all and they can be freed. They think Elizabeth is the Turner they need. They try to use her blood, only a small cut from her hand, but it doesn't work. Then Turner saves her, but not before knocking Sparrow unconscious.  But then the Black Pearl run after them and........
I already fear I have give out too much of the plot. I'm sure you can guess the rest.
The Pros: The performances of Rush as the Captain of the Black Pearl and Deep as Captain Jack Sparrow are what really save the movie. Otherwise it would have been a disaster. Especially Deep's performance, his mixture of a suave drunk rock star pirate could not be duplicated by any other actor. It wasn't overly done like other things in the movie. The special effects are what you would imagine the magic of Disney would come up. It was well done.
The Cons:  It didn't really care for Blooms or Knightley's performance. He tried to act tough and heroic and denies his pirate heritage, but instead it seemed a bit too pushed. She also tries to play the girl-powered heroine, but that seems a bit contrived. There characters were the weakest part of the movie and so was there ""love"". There was no chemistry between them at all. It was more like they were friends than lovers. The plot was tolerable. The movie would have done better if it was Deep who performance should have been elevated to star instead of co-star. Bloom could not have carried the movie like Deep. The sword fights were well choreographed but it was too long and dull. The movie would have done well if they spent more time with plot development than sword fights.
Overall:  See it for a wonderful performance of Deep and Rush. Not for the plot.",1073692800,2,3247,4.426421404682274

1493737,5,B00005JM5E,"I was dragged to the theatrical version of this film by a bunch of girls who wanted to see a movie with Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom, and wasn't really expecting much out of it, particularly since it was a Disney film.  Well, it was a good film indeed, although I have to say the major downfall was Bloom's character.  I won't dispute his acting talent, but the character he played was the same old cliche Disney romantic bumbling bonehead with silly lines and a really comical composition.  Depp's performance was darn good; to play a character who was so out-there, and to do it with style, that takes skills.  Geoffrey Rush makes a great villain, even though the film doesn't do a whole lot to antagonize his character.  And then there's Keira Knightley... she may be the most beautiful girl alive, but she also has acting talent, and unlike many of her colleagues, she doesn't need to rely on her looks to gain her glory.  The less important actors came out with mixed results, but the Commodore and the governor were, sorry to say, not very good.  The music was pretty good, but I think it could've been stronger.  I could just imagine them using the intro to Dimmu Borgir's ""Progenies of the Great Apocalypse"" (which was done with an orchestra) in the battle scenes!  Anyway, although they had to make Orlando Bloom's character a typical Disney bozo, it really is a pretty good film.  Very out-there, but entertaining enough.",1073606400,2,1432,4.669322709163347

1493740,4,B00005JM5E,"What a fun movie!  Honestly, I expected little from this movie.  I was more than pleasantly surprised.  The visual effects are very good.  But you knew that from the previews.  What I didn't know was how quirky the plot is.  There are a lot of fun twists.  When you think you know what to expect, you find you were wrong.  And it is very funny.  I laughed a lot.
But it is exciting as well.  My 12 and 10 year olds found this to be a heart-pounding thriller.  At a couple of points they were so scared they said they found it hard to watch the screen.  Not from horror, but because they found the suspense hard to bear.  But they couldn't turn away.  Afterwards, they raved about the movie.
I personally loved the way the character of Captain Jack Sparrow moves through the movie almost apart from it, but deeply involved in every aspect of both sides of the issues.  He is after his own objectives and all his alliances are temporary and his methods brilliant.  Johnny Depp is superb in this role as is Geoffry Rush as the villain Barbossa.  Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom bring energy and verve to their roles and a fun to watch.  The whole cast enlivens this movie with the spirit of fun no matter how tense things get in the plot.
There are many many extras offered with this movie.  They are of varying quality and interest, but none are as fun as the movie itself.  For me, this was a surprising delight.",1073606400,2,1412,4.337164750957855

No one has played a pirate quite like Depp. He's flamboyant, foppish, charming, and cunning all at the same time. He truly is the shining point of this film, but a good performance by Geoffrey Rush and goofy lesser characters can't be discounted.
I got this DVD and watched it with 20 friends on a 60 inch flat screen TV with a killer surround system. Everyone had a blast and we enjoyed the numerous features in addition to the flick itself. Check out the outtakes, but stay away from the interactive tour of the ship. I honestly don't know why they wasted their time making that. It's pretty worthless.

1493820,5,B00005JM5E,"Disney, a company with a wonderful history of great films which has, in recent years, made a few flops, is back on top with this film (and another they released this year). Pirates of the Carribean has it all: Good acting, good script, great plot, and wonderful directing. It even has the right amount of action and violence vs. character interaction and dialogue, and the perfect amount of humor (most of which is found in Johnny Depp's wonderfully acted character, Captain Jack Sparrow).
At fact value, it's a typical ""girl gets taken, guy hooks up with unlikely ally and gets girl back"" film, like many we've all seen. However, taken further, it's a story about the bonds of friendship, what is moral and just vs. what is legal, birthright, revenge and not judging a book by its cover. We see in Captain Jack an unlikely hero - he seems like a typical ruthless pirate. However, as the story develops we learn that he's actually a pretty nice guy, and that's even why he lost his old ship, The Black Pearl, to begin with. Until the end, though, he keeps us guessing as to his real motives. He always seems like he's going to do anything to help himself, everyone else be damned, but in the end, he comes through and keeps to his word and helps ""the good guys win.""",1073433600,,1266,4.508695652173913

I thought this movie was a fantastic tale of adventure that could appeal to all ages. The special effects were awesome and very realistsic, and the dialogue was witty and entertaining. Johnny Depp's character was fascinating to watch on screen. His eccentricities gave a wonderful humorous tilt to a tale of curses and death. My favorite aspect of the movie, however was the music. The booming, fast-paced anthems of adventure on the high seas really drove the film home.

1493906,4,B00005JM5E,"In 2003, Walt Disney Pictures (along with First Mate Productions and Jerry Bruckheimer Films) produced what is probably one of the best pirate films of the past two decades.  Under the direction of Gore Verbinski (who directed ""The Ring"" in 2002), ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is a very entertaining and engaging film in large due to the wonderful acting of Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom (who played ""Legolas Greenleaf"" in all three ""Lord of the Rings"" films between 2001 and 2003), Geoffrey Rush and Keira Knightley, as well as superb special effects, good cinematography and good writing.  The principle writers for the film, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, have previously collaborated their writing skills on such films as ""Little Monsters"" (1989), ""Aladdin"" (1992) and the highly successful ""Shrek"" (2001), to name a few.  Two other writers who helped to write this film are Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert.
The story, which was probably inspired by a ride of a similar name at the Disneyland amusement park in California, follows the life of a woman, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), from when she is child (played by Lucinda Dryzek) while she and her father, Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce), are en route to Port Royal.  After successfully fending off a pirate attack, a boy named William Turner (Dylan Smith) escapes from the pirate ship and travels to Port Royal with Elizabeth and her father.  As a memento of the attack, Elizabeth keeps a gold coin that she finds in Will's clutched hand.  As an adult, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) works as a blacksmith.  Enter the enigmatic pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who is not particularly welcome at Port Royal.  He is imprisoned by Gov. Swann, but escapes when Port Royal is attacked by the pirate ship named the Black Pearl, which is commanded by Capt. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush).  Jack wants the Black Pearl, Elizabeth is kidnapped and the nature of the curse is revealed.
Memorable scenes in the film include the pirate attack during Elizabeth's childhood, Jack's arrival at Port Royal, Jack meeting Will, the attack upon the port, Elizabeth onboard the Black Pearl, Will and Jack leaving the port, and the scenes at the Isla de Muerta.  Other memorable characters include Mr. Gibbs (Kevin McNally), Koehler (Treva Etienne), Norrington (Jack Davenport), Ragetti (Mackenzie Crook), Pintel (Lee Arenberg), Mullroy (Angus Barnett) and Murtogg (Giles New).
At 2 hours & 23 minutes, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is sure to entertain both adults and children alike.  Overall, I rate the film with 4 out of 5 stars.

1493908,5,B00005JM5E,"Having watched the DVD, ""Pirates of the Carribean"" twice now (and I rarely watch ANY movie more than once), I can truthfully say that it ranks with any of the great fantasy/action films that I've seen in the past 10-15 years.  The closest comparison is the Indiana Jones series with it's cliff-hanging, non-stop action.
By now, you've read enough reviews or you already know what the movie is about, so let me skip all of that.
Filled with memorable characters, ""Pirates"" is a movie that will appeal to movie fans from 8-80.  Johnny Depp steals the show with his wonderful portrayal of pirate Captain Jack Sparrow.  Geoffrey Rush is great as Captain Barbossa, former first-mate of Sparrow's who has stolen his ship, the Black Pearl, out from under him.  (His character reminded me of Cyril Richards, the terrific Capt. Hook in the original ""Peter Pan"".)  And, newcomers Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley play the parts of the star-crossed lovers with energy and enthusiasm.
The scenery and CGI graphics add greatly to the production of this mega-hit.  Realistic ship-to-ship battle scenes and authentic-looking sword fights increase the realism of the film.  And, if you're into plenty of extras on your DVD, then you'll spend a lot of hours going through all the things (bloopers, 19 deleted scenes, the ""making-of"" the film, etc.) included with the film.
All in all, just a tremendous film that's great fun for the viewer and wonderful escapism.  Sit back and enjoy!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1073260800,,1488,4.995951417004049

The cast is a good one. Geoffry Rush, Orlando Bloom(Lord of The Rings) Johnny Depp, and Kira Knightley. She's in Love Actually, and I would watch her anytime. She's a good young actress also very beautiful. Listen to the commentaries, and you'll hear about (pout 1, pout 2, and pout 3,). She has a sense of humor people. The extras on the Dvd are an added bonus. If you like movies about pirate myth,  or if you like the ride at disneyland, or swordplay you should like this Dvd.

1493911,5,B00005JM5E,"Yes! Finally a pirate movie that captures the fun, swashbuckling aura that the Errol Flynn ones had.
This film is a real gem. It is not trying to be an pseudo-epic film with heart-breaking emotion, it is a comedic, visually exciting in terms of graphics, and fast-paced film.
This film focuses on the story of Cpt Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) wanting to retrieve his ship, the Black Pearl, from his so-called first mate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). However, it does not solely focus on Johnny Depp which I think was good. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's characters have their own interesting stories to tell.
Positive Points: Stellar Cast! Depp, Bloom, Knightley, Rush and Davenport work very well together.
Depp has proved him self to be a great actor with films like Edward Scissorhands but in this effort, he shows that he is versatile and doesn't take himself too seriously which is refreshing to see.
Script is original and quite funny for the light-hearted.
Brilliant DVD - especially the deleted scenes, blooper reel and the information on how the film was made.
Negative Points: It is an enjoyable film but the only niggle I had was the minimal interaction between Sparrow and Elizabeth...Shame, they would have made a cute couple!",1073260800,2,1238,4.956730769230769

Jack Sparrow. Geoffrey Rush's character, Captain Barbossa, is and excellent villian in the flesh and as a skeleton. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly also give very strong performances.
This is a must see film that has something for every member of the family.  For those who have never experience the attraction, they will want to go once the movie is over!

Geoffrey Rush is fantastic, too. Usually, I hate computer animation because it looks so fake, but this movie is absolutely fantastic! The skeletons look so realistic!

Also, don't let the wieldy long sequel-like-esque title, ""Pirates of the Caribbean, The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" scare you away, this is a good all ages (except for the young and faint of heart) movie to howl, swash buckle, and delight in.
The power trio of Depp, Rush, and Bloom find themselves in uncharted waters turning in entertaining performances in a family adventure film, but who said serious actors can't have a little fun.  Brando got to do the same in ""The Freshman,"" and Pacino most certainly did ""Dick Tracy.""  Johnny Depp definitely steals center stage as Captain Jack Sparrow as he tries to regain his piratical prominence commanding the Pearl.  Special effects only interferes with the greater story a few times along the way and we are left with a mighty good watch.

1493995,5,B00005JM5E,"Pirates of the Carribean is a real treat for people of all ages.  It's been a long time since Hollywood has made a pirate movie worth watching, and this one is a visual feast.  It's filled with all the sword fighting, ship boarding action you could ask for.  It has a very authentic feel and it's not at all childish as you would expect of a movie based on a Disney attraction.
What makes this movie really stand out is the performance of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow.  He is inspired in the rile and really makes it his own.  Without Depp, this movie wouln't be as good as it is.  He really steals every scene he is in.
Another point that makes this great is the attention to detail.  Whether it's Port Royale, or a pirate's ship, you just have to be amazed at the quality of the production.  You can really imagine you're there.  In particular, the scenes of ship to ship battle, with cannons blazing, are some of the most exciting scenes in the movies today.  If you love action or adventure, this is a must have for your DVD library.",1073088000,,1044,4.3076923076923075
1493996,4,B00005JM5E,"Pirates of the Caribbean is regrettably based on a Disney ride. Okay, we got that out of the way. The good news is that the movei features immensely enjoyable work from Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush, as the usually-protagonist Caption Jack Sparrow, and the evil Captain Barbossa, respectively. Depp's Keith Richards inspired pirate steals the show, in spite of frequent darkly funny lines from Barbossa. Also appearing in the film are the beautfiul and talented Keira Knightley, the too-talented-to-be-in-this-small-a-role Jonathon Pryce, the solid Jack Davenport, and the wooden but physically gifted (and hot, I am told) Orlando Bloom.
Recoginizing where the fun the movie lies, Director Verbinski focuses on the antagonism between Barbossa and Sparrow, and Sparrow's good-natured ribbing of everyone else. The movie does a good job of not letting too much times pass between swordfights, and staying light on its feet, and stays enjoyable throughout. By no means a great movie, it is an enjoyable way to spend the afternoon, and something you will want to again, to catch some of the more subtle jokes.
This transfer is gorgeous, with rich colors and clean lines. The three commentary tracks are okay, not great. The other features are numerous, though middling in quality. By the way, does any non-Pixar movie have a good blooper reel? This doesn't, and the deleted scenes should remains so.
Buy this DVD for the movie, not the special features.",1073088000,2,1449,5.170212765957447
1493997,5,B00005JM5E,"I was trying to find a movie that was appropriate for my 12 year old son. He suggested ""Pirates"".
From the very beginning, this was a movie that drew me in. I genuinely wanted to see what came next and how the characters were going to get out of each situation.
Although, I was immediately distracted by Keira Knightley's facial expressions. Whether she was laying in bed or fighting pirates, she looked like she had a ""dip"" tucked away in her bottom lip. I really found this to be very very distracting.
Otherwise, I won't go into great detail because there are some very thorough reviews on the board already, but I would say that this movie did for me what few movies do.. it made me forget about time and life and the outside world completely. When I walked out of the theater I was surprised that it was still daylight and felt a bit dazed. Pirates had taken me on a 2.5 hour ride and had kept my full attention the entire time.
Johnny Depp does a great job. I think this is his best role ever. My thought is that he is so used to playing pretty boy parts that sometimes they come out a little shallow.. but in Pirates he is definitely not a pretty boy and seems to have totally let go and just played the role from his heart (and his funny bone). I wonder how much of it was ad libbed and how much was actually in the script. I found him to be completely witty and charming.
As it turns out this was a perfect movie for me and my son to watch together. The movie included romance without making me uncomfortable or giving me things to have to explain later. A few who are younger might be a little affected by the ghostly pirates skeletons.
A sequel could easily be made and I would be eager to go see it also.",1073088000,,1716,4.203030303030303

People complained about not liking the storyline or thinking it was too long and boring.  After watching it on video, I wonder what is wrong with people??!!  There was nothing boring or long about it.  There were parts in the movie that were similar to the ride, which is one of the top bests at Disneyland.  The storyline was great and the acting made it greater!  Sometimes I think people don't know how to enjoy a simply entertaining film anymore.

1494100,3,B00005JM5E,"Sure, the trailer for this film looks good. And I fancied seeing it. And I finally got to see it. And did I like it? Not in the slightest. There's nothing remotely scary about it and cos it's aimed at the kids, and it's only a 12, there's not enough scariness in it to even terrify an adult.
I'm not an Orlando Bloom girl. He's too much of a pretty boy for my liking. Now Johnny Depp may be approaching 40, but he's much more my type. I like older men! In this film, he's pure comic genius. Not since Benny & Joon has he been so funny! The simple expressions on his face kept making me choke on whatever I was drinking at the time. I would buy this film purely for him. But not just now, and I don't think I'd be tempted to watch it for any other reason than Johnny Depp. The best thing about Johnny is he hasn't been stereotyped like most Hollywood actors (see Hugh Grant). He prefers to star in low budget films, or appears in these box office successes. And he appears only eight minutes into the film, whereas I was expecting him to appear much later on.
Keira Knightly is becoming a great actress in her own right, after becoming successful after Bend It Like Beckham. She manages to play the role of Elizabeth Swan perfectly. She's seen near the beginning of the film being forced into a corset, and then comes out with the classic, funny line near the end of the film: ""Like pain . . . try wearing a corset"".
OK, Orlando Bloom is a good actor. I'll give him that. I just don't see the appeal and why all the women seem to be going ga-ga over him since he hit the big time.
This film may appeal to the little ones. All the special effects (which is frankly nothing new), and the storybook quality might blow them away. But it's not for me. I was determined to watch the film right to the end (you never know, it could have got better), but I needed a stiff drink to watch it right through.",1073088000,,1895,4.166212534059945
1494101,4,B00005JM5E,"I have to admit, I did not want to enjoy this movie. I was dragged kicking and screaming to the video store and only grudgingly rented it at the insistence of my daughter. I thought it was going to be juvenile and silly. Yes, it was juvenile and silly, but I really enjoyed this film. Johnny Depp reminds us again why he is such a good actor. Cast as pirate captain Jack Sparrow Depp delivers a superb performance.
The opening scene was hilarious, portending what the rest of the movie was going to be like. This was one funny movie. The humor was unexpected, it just did not go where you thought it would. The continued reference to the pirates code being just one example of the off-beat humor.
Of course, the special effects were stunning. The evil pirate crew, cursed by Cortezs treasure are the evil undead. Without giving anything away, I sat in utter amazement how they were able to so seamlessly weave together these effects.
Not a film for the wee ones. The violence and the evil undead would give them nightmares for a month. But for the rest of us, it is an enjoyable evenings entertainment.",1073088000,2,1102,4.515
1494102,5,B00005JM5E,"I am going to try to dispell some of the misconceptions of the other reviews of this movie.
First off, it's fantasy. It's not real. Like so many action adventure movies out there, it's meant purely for entertainment.
Second, yes, I DO consider this family entertainment, although maybe some from the younger set might want to shut their eyes during some of the skeletal parts, or when the town is being ravaged by the pirates. All four of my children (from age 3 to 15) watched this and didn't have to turn their heads once.
Third - where does this movie drag? I've read several reviews where reviewers claim the movie drags in the middle. Really? I haven't found that to be the case at all. It held my attention throughout, even the necessary dramatic scenes.
Fourth - I like epic movies. Give me a Braveheart, a Gods and Generals, or a Lord of the Ring - movies with length and substance that grab and pull you in (lots of drama as well as adventure) over simpleton flicks like virually every Arnold Schwarzenegger (or other movies of his ilk) anytime.
It's worth your money and your time if you like adventure movies. Although this one's a bit off center (how can it not be with Johnny Depp? But he gives it that charm that's missing from so many movies similar to this), from the beginning til the end you'll be riveted to your seat.",1073088000,,1337,4.483606557377049
1494103,5,B00005JM5E,"When I first saw the commercials for this movie, I just laughed. My first instinct was to think that Disney had become truly desperate if they were resorting to making a movie about one of their rides. Then one of my friends said she wanted me to go with her to see the movie because she felt stupid going to see it alone. I only gave in when she offered to pay my way (not that it's much, but come on, free popcorn and drinks!) and I sat down to get ready for a long bore. Well, the movie certainly is long, but not boring in the least. The beginning set a creepy tone to get us in the right mood, then once we saw Jack we had the perfect set-up: action, drama, humor, and a love story that was unfortunately a little too far pushed to the back burner.
The only movie I'd ever seen Johnny Depp in before was Sleepy Hollow, so I wouldn't have recognized him if it wasn't for the fact that the commercials told me who he was. The fact that he could play a virtually always-drunk pirate so well cracked me up. I will never forget ""But why is the rum gone?"" That's the first quote from the movie that pops out of my mouth every time. Basically, I loved his entire performance, I just wish there was a little less eyeliner on the poor man. Then we have Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, who make a dream couple not only in looks, but also in their roles as a governor's daughter and a blacksmith. The rich and the poor, it's always the ultimate love story. Sure, Will Turner is a slightly stiff character, but he loosened up considerably by the end. Then Geoffrey Rush, I'm not sure anything I say could do him justice. Right along with Johnny Depp, he was the most perfect for his character.
Now we throw in the incredible special effects, fight scenes, and plot, and we have one of the best films of the year. The only thing I have to add is that I felt a little bad for Norrington by the end of the film. The poor guy needs a girl that likes him, he deserves it.

For there to be humor I was told by a teacher long ago there must be believable risk, and you must care about what happens to the characters.  I do not remember why he said it, but I think it is true.
One of the best parts of the movie is the sword play.  These people have been to school.  The sword fights do not look like creative camera work, they looks real.  I wonder how long it takes to learn to fence?

I thought that it was going to be some ridiculous gory pirate-type movie, but it is not at all.  The epic battle scenes are really cool and not really gory.  Orlando Bloom plays a somewhat shy blacksmith (he was 8 when he was rescued from the water), but the shy blacksmith image only lasts for about 10 minutes into the movie.  Orlando was obviously fantastic in this movie, but Johnny Depp (Captain Jack Sparrow) absolutely deserves an Oscar.  His performance is impossible to describe, you simply must see it in order to appreciate how talented you have to be to pull off such a complicated role.  This movie was highly underated by critics and is one of my favorite movies of all time.  It incorporates so many thematic elements, like comedy, romance, and action.

Let's face it:  other than Depp & the scenery-chewing performance of Geoffery Rush (who calls on every pirate stereotype known to man --- arrrrh!), everyone else is pretty forgettable, especially Orlando Bloom & Keira Knightley (and their attendent cheesy love subplot).  The special effects are decent enough, and the sword-fight choreography is generally average (where is Erroll Flynn when you really need him?).  The goofy soundtrack gets pretty old pretty quickly, and the plot in general doesn't exactly leave the viewer on the edge of his seat?
All in all, it is a pretty average film, except that Depp takes over the movie in every scene he is in, as he portrays perhaps the swishiest (or totally besotted, take your pick) pirate ever to be portrayed on the big screen.  Captain Jack Sparrow's utterly bizarre persona leaves one fascinated, and raises an otherwise run-of-the-mill pirate adventure flick to a higher, more enjoyable level.

The previews/trailers were a bit misleading as to what kind of good-guy Depp's pirate is. Thankfully in the movie itself he's irresponsible, unreliable, backhanded ... and therefore very funny. The actors are all great, the stunts are fun, and the effects largely convincing. Despite this being a Bruckheimer Production, I was pleased that the film wasn't pretentious.
The running time of over 2 hours was a bit long though, and there were some scenes that I found to being terribly boring: when two un-dead characters fight eachother despite knowing neither can win.
The DVD: All the bells and whistles one comes to expect of huge blockbusters. The outtakes are fun, and some of the featurettes are also good. I don't always like watching all the extras, but with Pirates of the Caribbean you will want to see how the movie was put together.

I think that the movie itself was fantastic and it must of taken months to build everything.(the ships, the sets, etc.) Gore Verbinski, the Director, did a splendid job putting in all the elements in this movie and that's what makes it a action/adventure story. Though the violence could be kept down a little more...it's still a fun family movie. Every family likes humor and this movie has lots of it, you just have to listen for it. After me saying it's a fun, great, family movie your probably thinking: What about what everyone said, about the pirates? Aren't they scary? How is that a good movie for little kids? Well, this movie might be scary for little kids. I still encourage you to buy this GREAT Disney Movie and enjoy it with everyone.

I don't even like pirate movies but this movie is most defintely an exception. This movie is incredible. I promise you, if you buy this dvd you will not I repeat you will not be sorry.

He is without doubt one hell of a package. Besides being very handsome he can also act, and act well! He is the heart and soul of ""Pirates"". Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp), former captain of ""The Black Pearl"" is out for revenge and Captain Barbossa is the target! Barbossa , his mutinous first mate, is played perfectly by supertalented Geoffrey Rush. His witty dialogue and pirate brogue add a wonderful touch to this adventure. Barbossa and his crew of ""msicreants"" are cursed as a result of stealing treasure that has a sordid history. They need to lift the curse by finding the gold coins of Cortez that doomed them to an eternity of living death and wash the curse clean in the blood of ""Bootstrap"" Bill Turner father of ""Will"" Turner, played by Orlando Bloom. The significance of Bill's blood is not really developed but that is not necessary in keeping the movie on course. Ms Swan (Keira Knightley), her father(Jonathan Pryce) and her admirer, Commodore Norrington(Jack Davenport) all play significant roles and the acting throughout is suberb. Without giving too much away, Will and Jack embark on a duel purpose adventure to rescue Ms Swan and seek revenge on Barbossa respectively. The result is a swashbuckling, rip-roaring pirate adventure set in breathtaking locations and non-stop action.

I loved the movie, though it is NOT one for the kids despite being made by Disney. To the people that complain about the violence, by their very nature pirates were far from nice people. The only problem I had was the accents seem to get strangely Australian rather than English by the end. There is also one point where Depp slide down a rope, a little difficult to do when your hands are chained together, he clearly throws the chain over the rope. Aside from that I loved it but then I prefer the darker movies. Buy it but do not buy it for kids! It's the same people complaining that thought taking the kids to see Jurassic Park a good idea...

And my God, why did they make this film almost 2-1/2 hours long?  I was getting restless after 90 minutes, and after two hours I finally threw in the towel.  Johnny Depp isn't bad, but as other viewers said, many times he races through his lines so fast that you can't understand them, which I find VERY frustrating and annoying.",1072915200,3,637,4.807339449541284

1494312,5,B00005JM5E,"""Pirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is great fun. It has romance, action, sword fighting, ghost pirates, great bad guys, great good guys, ships on fire, and secret treasure. It is funny, exciting and satifying. What more could you want in a movie?

Reminding viewers of every pirate movie they have ever seen, from ""Captain Kidd, ""Captain Blood"" and even ""Princess Bride.""

The personality of ""Princess Bride""'s great Spanish swordsman Inigo Montoya shows up in the character of Captain Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp. With the flavor of Dudley Moore's ""Arthur,"" Capt. Jack is almost sober, and always ready with a subtle quip.

In dashing good pirate fashion, the movie is about saving a damsel in distress. Keira Knightley plays the damsel, Elizabeth Swann, the daughter of the governor. Chased by the governor and his navy, and in the hands of bad ghost pirates, conflict and swordplay surround many scenes in freshly choreographed duels.

Fans of the ""Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"" will enjoy a scene when the ghost pirates are walking on the ocean floor. It reminded me of the ""Army of the Dead"" charging to fight.

It is a pure, family movie. The youngest children might find some scenes too violent, but older children will love this battle of good and evil.

I would have liked to understand more behind Capt. Jack's background, and more character development of Will Turner (played by played by Orlando Bloom). This is not because the movie is lacking, but because of how invested I felt in each character. I want a sequel.

I fully recommend ""Pirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl."" It is worth watching and rewatching, making it a great purchase for your DVD library.

1494413,2,B00005JM5E,"This movie's premise is fairly good.  A group of pirates stole 882 peices of cursed Aztec gold, spent it and found that the curse made them unable to be killed, yet also unable to experience life.  To end the curse the pirates must gather all 882 pieces and for some unexplained reason douse them with the blood of William Turner (a deceased pirate) or his descendant.  The special effects, sets and settings are terrific but some of the acting is just too over the top.  Will Turner played by Orlando Bloom is totally unbelievable, Jack Sparrow played by an over eye-lined Johnny Depp is frankly annoying and Commander Norrington is just too inept.  Probably the most annoying part of the movie was the comic relief provided by a pair of British Redcoats and a pair of cursed pirates.  Every time either one of these pairs appeared on screen I cringed.  Johnny Depp has maybe five amusing lines, but for the most part his mincing, overblown portrayal of a pirate captain left me nearly retching.  If this is the best modern filmakers can do making a pirate movie, I see why its a genre whose time is gone.

1494414,3,B00005JM5E,"The lead character is Captain Jack, a flamboyant tart of a man, who prances about like a back-up guitar player for an Aerosmith cover band.
The special effects are fine, the costuming a bit cheesy. The female lead is as satisfying as a twinkie doused in Sweet-N-Low.
The musical score is bland, the ""rollicking"" story reminds me of when I was four years old and first tasted paste.
The villians, red coaated brits festooned with all the pagentry of flags and medals, is trite. And how DARE they try to stop pirates from raping and pillaging.
Buy it for the kids, any 11 year old will enjoy the swashbuckling. If you are an adult with an IQ over 100, you are better of watching an Emmauelle movie..the acting is better.",1072828800,,718,4.530769230769231
1494415,4,B00005JM5E,"When people talked about Pirates of the Caribbean, I was glad that a Lord of the Rings actor (Orlando Bloom/Legalos) was getting a chance to do another film.  HOWEVER, as the movie was to be based off a ride - A RIDE - I wondered whether the script writers of the film industry had lost it.  Are there not enough good books left out there?  Are people no longer creating worthwhile scripts?
Protest aside, when some friends suggested we go, I went along with the crowd to see it.  I was expecting to be bored by an overly simplistic plot compensated by special effects and humorous but shallow dialogue.  Thus, I was in for a great surprise.  I absolutely loved it!  It is true that there isn't a whole lot of depth for the movie...but they scraped together enough to make one decent film.
For those who don't know, the premise is that the blacksmith in an English port, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is ""secretly"" in love with the govenor's daughter, Elizabeth. She, in turn, is in love with him - they fell in love way back when Will, as a child, was saved from the wreckage of a burning ship.  This love may have laid dormant forever except for 2 things - the arrival of the pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Elizabeth's accidental summoning of the pirate ship The Black Pearl.  (Sparrow did not come with this ghostly ship, as they had mutineed against him, as it were.)
From this explosive start begins a fairly fantastic adventure to save Elizabeth, to regain Sparrow's ship, and to make things right for everyone - including the pirates.  If it weren't for Sparrow's character, this may have just become boring and numbing.  However, Sparrow's character is so many steps ahead of everyone & is playing everyone off each other to such an extent that you stay engaged as you try to figure what he's up to.  It isn't until the very end that you truly know which side he was working for.
In fact, as has already been said, Depp really made this movie worthwhile.  Not only was his character well-written, but he brought this whole movie to life.  Everything about his character is perfect - the posture, the accent, the facial movements, his gait, his timing, his understated way of going about things.  You begin to realize that this whole plot hinges on him, but you're never really sure that you can trust him to bring it through.
As for actors, Depp is one of the few I've found in the ""younger"" generation that can truly act - rather than just take type-cast roles.  To see him alone is worth it.  However, everyone else in the movie does their part well enough to allow for a very enjoyable time.
The next question is...is there enough material to make a second movie from...?",1072828800,2,2687,4.54149377593361

With an all-star class featuring Johnny Depp as Cap'n Jack Sparrow; Kiera Knightly as Elizabeth Swann; Orlando Bloom as Will Turner and Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa; it's an obvious hit at first glance.  Add pirates, amazing special effects, ships, skeletons and a bottle of rum, well-- you've got yerslef a winner!
While the rest of the cast is exceptional, this is Johnny Depp's movie.  He steals every scene as the scheming, dirty, witty pirate Cap'n Jack Sparrow.  He adds hilarious facial charecteristics and just a bit of well, himself, into his charecter.  It's amazing what the guy can do.  He is just SO funny!  Just watching him walk makes me burst out laughing.  I love this guy!
The basic summary is: Elizabeth Swann is the governer's daughter.  She gets kidnapped by pirates, and the man secretly in love with her, Will Turner, invests in the aid of Jack Sparrow, a pirate, to save her.

Johnny Depp is in the role of CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW. This role was made only for Johnny Depp. I always thought Johnny Depp was one of the best actors, but none of his previous roles compare to his role in this one. He was amazingly outstanding. Not to mention, hystorically funny. He was the whole film. If Johnny is nominated for an OSCAR for BEST ACTOR for this film, he better get it.
Orlando Bloom is in the role of WILLIAM ""WILL"" TURNER. I never heard of Orlando until this movie. I thought Orlando was amazing in this. He deserves the OSCAR for BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR.
Geoffry Rush is in the role of the EVIL CAPTAIN of THE BLACK PEARL. Although, he wasn't bad in this role, he still wasn't all that great. Other than this film, I practically hate this guy's guts.
I do not know who played the role of ELIZABETH, but this girl is drop dead gorgeous. She's the next Catherine Zeta-Jones. As far as her acting goes, she should be getting the OSCAR for BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS.

1494590,3,B00005JM5E,"""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is nowhere near as good as its box office tally might indicate, but it does make an enjoyable evening's entertainment.
I've never taken the ride itself, so I can't compare the movie to its so-called ""source material"" (what's next, a movie based on the back of a cereal box?). And I am no fan of Jerry Bruckheimer, whose ""Bad Boys"" movies and ""Armageddon,"" among other cinematic debacles, were repulsive.
But ""Pirates"" succeeds largely on the strength of its acting. Johnny Depp turns in the first ""subtly hammy"" performance I've ever seen as Capt. Jack Sparrow, truly a memorable character. Orlando Bloom has that whole Errol Flynn thing going on, and Geoffrey Rush is in fine form as the dread pirate Barbossa.
The special effects are sometimes admirable, though the CGI sometimes feels lifted from ""The Mummy Returns"" (that's not a compliment). I dunno, the whole ""pirates who are actually dead guys (well, they're sorta dead) who turn to skeletons in the moonlight"" thing smacks of cheese, but then I thought ""Gladiator"" was just a bad B-movie, so I'm sure there will be plenty who disagree.
Gore Verbinski's passionate, energetic direction is another saving grace. On the whole, ""Pirates"" looks a lot better than some of Steven Spielberg's more recent work. The cinematography, set design, sound effects and art direction are stunning. Not ""Lord of the Rings"" level, but quite good, nonetheless.
I'm not a big fan of this movie, but it's sort of a guilty pleasure, sort of like ""Waterworld."" Three stars and that's it.",1072569600,2,1549,4.984555984555985

  I bought the DVD version and that was really neat because it has bloopers, behind the scenes, and special computer features including a 'Turn yourself into a skeleton' feature by uploading a picture of yourself and you can see what you would look like as a skeleton. It was really neat.
  The actors did a great job, although Orlando Bloom could have done better. Don't get me wrong, he's a GREAT actor, but his acting wasn't anything compared to LOTR in this movie.

1494592,4,B00005JM5E,"The Walt Disney Company, best known for being one of the premier family-oriented entertainment companies in the world, has experienced a slow-down at the box office with their animated films beginning to lose their edge and their live action fare failing to capture attention for more then one weekend. They have not been as fortunate as other studios as to attach themselves to successful franchises like Warner Brothers has with the Harry Potter series or New Line with The Lord of the Rings. They have become so desperate for a hit as of late that they begun digging through their archives and making some of their more classic live actions features such as Freaky Friday and The Shaggy Dog. But another ploy, that many analysts have taken as a sign of their limited ideas, they have taken up is transforming several of their famous Disneyland attractions into full-length feature films. The company?s first attempt to make the cross-over from tourist packing attraction to box office success story, The Country Bears, was an absolute embarrassment for all those involved. Barely (no pun intended) pulling in $16 million, on a production of $20 million, the film flopped with both the public and the critics. Hoping to bounce back, the second attraction-based feature out of the gate is Pirates of the Caribbean. Pirates is helmed by Gore Verbinski, director of the horror hit The Ring, and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. Not only that but it stars Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp with special effects created by Industrial Light and Magic. How could it fail? Quite easily. The pirate genre seems to have been labeled as much a poison to the box office as Al Gore and Michael Moore are to any political figure that gets near them. The latest example comes in the form of Disney last animated flop, Treasure Planet, which failed to recoup even half of its excessive $140 million production budget. And with a production budget just as large, Pirates is yet another big gamble for Disney, only this time they hope to get some luck going for themselves.

The story follows the adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate who seems to be low on his luck. It started nearly ten years prior to where the film starts off when Sparrow?s crew enacted mutiny on his ship and left him deserted on an island in the middle of the Caribbean with only a shotgun and one bullet. Ever since then he?s been moving from one location to the next in search of his stolen ship, the Black Pearl. It is by mere luck (something he desperately needs) that he happens to be captured on the same island where the last piece of cursed treasure resides. What cursed treasure? The treasure of Cortez that was stolen by Sparrow?s mutinous crew, lead by the menacing Captain Barbossa. Unbeknownst to them, the treasure was cursed and unless the treasure is returned, these men will remain the living dead. Though they look human during the day, at night (and in the light of the moon) they turn into grotesque living skeletons. They will be unable to eat, drink, sleep, or even feel until the curse is broken. Will Turner, the skilled blacksmith of the Caribbean town, joins with Captain Jack Sparrow in chasing down Barbossa and his crew who has kidnapped his true love, Elizabeth Turner, the daughter of the town?s governor. But there are far more mysterious reasons for Captain Jack Sparrow to team up with the young Turner that go beyond rescuing Elizabeth. The story for Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, even with its consistent lapses in logic and holes in its storyline, is one of the most exciting movies of the year. Considering this is a Jerry Bruckheimer production and his films are not known for their serious conformity, holes in this feature?s storyline should not come as a surprise to anyone. As with such other cult-classic action flicks as The Rock or Armageddon, it is best to ignore these simple misgivings and just enjoy a fantastically well executed action film.

The cast of Pirates of the Caribbean has to be one of the most impressive groups of actors and actresses assembled for a Walt Disney Pictures production in the last few years, not only for their star power but the fact that several members have an extensive list of creditable films attached to them which can only help a film of this nature. Johnny Depp, best known for his outlandish performances in Edward Scissorhands and Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas, continues his streak of surprising, and more importantly entertaining, roles with his Keith Richards-inspired Captain Jack Sparrow. Though it is rare to say that any picture?s success based on entertainment value relies solely on one performance, Depp?s Captain Jack Sparrow is the definitive highlight of the entire picture. The comedic timing and erratic motions of the character are so perfectly in sync with the entire the picture, while at the same time not distracting attention away from the film?s plot, that no one but Johnny Depp could have pulled off a character like Captain Jack Sparrow as successfully as he does. Orlando Bloom, best known for his role in the Lord of the Rings series, does wonderful job in the role of William Turner. Though there are several prominent questions about the character left unanswered at the end of this film, it is to be understood that they will undoubtedly be revealed in any upcoming sequels that are to follow this film?s success and therefore can be forgiven for the time being. Geoffrey Rush, a well known perform in Australia, is absolutely devilish in the role of Captain Barbossa. He presents both a creepy yet bit charming character that works tremendously well in this film. Keira Knightly, who?s break out performance in the independent flick, Bend It Like Beckham, has garnered the film even more attention, performs well in the role of Elizabeth Swann, the governor?s daughter who isn?t the ordinary ?maiden in distress?, a welcome change from past action flicks of this genre. The only performance in the entire film that seemed out of place was that of Jonathan Pryce?s Governor Swann. Its not that his performance is absolutely unnecessary, its just that he is given little to actually do and fails to really move things along. In fact, he seems to be more of annoyance and should have been scripted better then what was presented in the film.

Overall, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is without a doubt one of the best action films of the summer and one of the biggest surprises of the year. Despite lapses in the film?s premise and certain sword fights that don?t go anywhere, Pirates is one of the rare theatrical spectacles that every member of the family can find something about it to enjoy. Those special effect savvy individuals will be astounded by the creative and detailed CGI effects created by Industrial Light and Magic, most notably involving the grotesque skeletons presented throughout the film. The musical score, which, at the last minute, was conducted by Klaus Baldelt, and overproduced by Hans Zimmer, works perfectly with the actions on the screen and truly sets the mood for many of the key scenes. The nearly flawless production, as in the area of entertainment value, does have one outstanding problem which its two hour and twenty minute time length, which makes it seem in the minds of the movie-goers that the filmmakers may be overdoing things a bit.  But based on the children ? if they can stand watching Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets for a longer period of time then this, Pirates? time length should be no problem. Even a squabble here and there, Pirates of the Caribbean is one of the few this summer that be truly, and rightfully, labeled a must-see. Judging by reaction so far to the film, this could easily go down as one of the greatest cult-classic or guilty pleasure films of the year, quite possibly of all-time.",1072569600,3,7885,4.816974169741697

1494596,5,B00005JM5E,"Funny, scary, romantic and cunning, this movie is an exact take off of the infamous ride that it is named after.  So much like the ride, it seems at parts they just took a camera on it.  The battle where the pearl attacks the village is identical to when you ride between boat and shore on the ride.  The best is how they even incorporated the dog at the prison.
IT WAS GREAT
Not only is there not enough stars on Amazon to give this movie its proper rating, there isn't even enough grains of sand to represent the rating on the entire PLANET.

1494597,4,B00005JM5E,"One of this year's most talked about and applauded movies, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN is a visual wonder, and has some truly outstanding moments, and some quirky performances.  My only problem with it was its length.  It seems to sag in the last half, particularly in the scenes involving the blooding of Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom.  By this time, I wanted the movie to speed up and get to the resolution.  The extended swordfight between Geoffrey Rush and Depp, while a marvel of some fine special FX, seemed trite and anticlimactic.  The moonlight transitions were incredibly done, and provided the film's eeriest moments.  There were some great comedic relief scenes, and overall the movie is very, very entertaining.
Performance wise, yes, Johnny Depp did add some unexpected foppish flare to his role as Jack Sparrow.  At times, his transition to a more serious character, as on the island with Knightley, were touching.  However, by the time the movie was gearing down, Depp's performance got redundant and tiresome; but Depp proves how diverse an entertainer he can be; his lack of inhibitions in flauncing his role is commendable.
Sadly overlooked by many, however, are Jonathan Pryce and Jack Davenport.  Pryce plays Knightley's austere father with the usual priggishness, but underneath is a happy man who wants his daughter to be happy, too; Davenport plays Knightley's intended, Commandore Norrington, with a true sense of valor, righteousness, and an unexpected sensitivity and regard for not only his love, but his men.  Davenport's is the performance that I feel most Oscar-worthy.  Geoffrey Rush overacts; Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are beautiful, and give solid, if non-sensational, performances.
A great movie for entertaining; a point though that sometimes less is more.

When I first heard that the movie was being made, I had my doubts....most Disney films I had seen just didn't appeal to me. What a pleasant surprise!!! I was stunned by this movie. The acting was superb, all around.  There was not one actor who did not do a tremendous job. The special effects went way beyond my expectations, and the music is still going round in my head.  As for the DVD, the bonus materials alone are worth the price of the DVD. I especially enjoy the bloopers reel! It is hysterical.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.

1494661,5,B00005JM5E,"I am not one of the people that went into the theatres expecting this movie to be bad. I did go in to the theatre hoping to have fun. I was not disappointed, I was actually incredibly surprised. I was blown away by the performance of Johnny Depp, pleasantly thrilled by the character played by Orlando Bloom, and enjoyed the swordplay immensely.
The movie started out a bit slow, providing the background in a dream or a memory by Elizabeth Swann and then progressing to the present and illustrating something of the characters in the present of the movie. Thereafter the appearance of Captain Jack Sparrow starts the ride that leads through humor and high seas adventure reminiscent of the swashbuckling movies in the past.
Most of the action took place in melee as there was little cannon play. The melee was fun to watch and easily took over the screen. Most of the main characters had reasonable backgrounds and motivations.
I enjoyed the cinematography, as well as the soundtrack. There was no ""pop"" music that tried to push the movie, or to take it out of the time it was set in. Overall I enjoyed every aspect of the movie. It easily took me back to the era of the movies Captain Blood or Treasure Island, but surpassed them in all categories.
When we came out of the theatre, my wife and I could not stop talking about it. I ordered the DVD from Amazon as soon as I had the opportunity, and schemed for a way to get back to the theatres to see it a second time. I was not disappointed. I have enjoyed the DVD as well.
If you enjoy fun movies with action and character, this is a must have. If you are looking for a deep intellectual film geared toward garnering an Oscar, perhaps you should look elsewhere. This movie is all about entertainment, the art of having fun.",1072483200,,1776,4.467692307692308

The music truly adds to the non stop action of the movie and I've purchased the soundtrack too. Purely exilerating music! It is a real disappointment this movie and Johnny Depp are not up for a Golden Globe and probably not even an Oscar as they are definately deserving of one!

1494665,5,B00005JM5E,"I was real skeptical when this movie came out. All I could think is ""Oh great, Disney Corp. can't think of anything new to do so they are making films of the rides...Walt must be spinning in his grave!"" I grew up in California, and the first time we went to Disneyland was in 1963 or around there, and then we went back about another 6 times. The Pirates of the Carribean Ride was probably my favorite, and I was loathe to see it done badly.
This movie was NOT done badly. Johnny Depp was an absolute scream in this movie. I knew he was weird, but I didn't know he was capable of the type of humor he showed in this movie. The movie was actually a bit of a return to some of the old slapstick/one-liner movies of the past that no one seems to be able to do well any more. Every time Depp came on, I laughed until I cried. His mannerisms, his sarcasm, the rolling eyes, etc. made for a great movie to lighten my day. I really needed that. No stupid gross-out movies, no idiots like Adam Sandler whose language has to be a bad word every two sentences in order to garner humor, no SNL people trying to make comebacks. Just a very funny person doing a very funny role.
The plot is light, but it doesn't hurt to have Orlando Bloom in there also. He plays the straight man to Depp's funiness, but I agree with my daughters, Bloom is a good-looker (though I prefer his long blonde locks in Lord of the Rings).
Actually, I thought the plot was rather interesting. Since our family tree has it's own pirate in it, I know that cursing was rather rampant in those days. The thought that the pirates had to return the stuff they stole in order to regain their human forms, and the major fiascos that occurred in order for those same pirates to be defeated (since they could not die again) made for a pretty interesting plot).
But again, Depp was just amazing in this. A thoroughly enjoyable romp with lots of snickers and out-loud laughs. Some great sword fighting also.

1494666,5,B00005JM5E,"When I first saw previews for this film it didn't interest me at all as it looked too cheesey and bland. But after hearing all the rave reviews from friends and the media I decided to take a chance and I'm glad I did by the end of the movie I walked out of the theater in awe. This movie had everything I could ask for -action/adventure/comedy/suspence/romance/horror all wrapped into one. Plus not to mention a great cast that just made the movie more outstanding. Johnny Depp is one of the most elite actors out there today and his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow is beyond belief.
Pirates of the Caribbean was a welcomed surprise as every now and then a movie that comes out that manages to capture lightning in a bottle, this film does that flawlessly. I can only hope that the sequel will be just as good.

1494732,4,B00005JM5E,"This film is fun and so full of adventure!  I'm confused though, is Johnny Depp playing pirate Captain Jack Sparrow or is he doing his best Keith Richards impression?  Whichever may be the case, I still thought Johnny Depp's character was witty, clever, and entertaining.  Another Hollywood veteran, the brilliant Geoffrey Rush, was the antagonist of the story.  I honestly didn't think he was a very convincing villain in this role, sort of a Freddy Kruegeresque-this-villian-isn't-too-scary-because-he-has-too-many-one-liners.
Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings) and Keira Knightley (Bend it Like Beckham) are absolutely riveting young actors.  It is a breath of fresh air to see Bloom's talents in a role that doesn't include being a long-haired blonde elf.  He also, predictably, gets the girl (Knightley) at the end -- not before learning that his father was a pirate, sword-fighting with the likes of the cursed men of the Black Pearl, and saving his distressed damsel.  But this damsel is not helpless.  Knightley plays a very strong-willed young woman who doesn't just sit back and wait for things to happen.  She has one of the most frightful screams I have ever heard, very convincing.  She is definitely her own person, and follows her conscience and heart and not convenience.  But aren't they all like that in movies?
This movie is thoroughly predictable, but it was very fun.  If you like adventure and a little ridiculousness, you'll like this film.  I loved it!",1072396800,,1475,5.121338912133891
1494733,5,B00005JM5E,"After seeing ""Pirates"" in the theaters three times this summer, my husband and I eagerly awaited the DVD release and the chance to have the movie all to ourselves.  The movie itself was widely recognized as one of the most entertaining films of the year, after most people expected it to be typical brainless summer blockbuster fare.  Fantastically over-the-top performances by Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp bring depth and meaning to what might have been an otherwise unspectacular action flick.  Depp's impeccable comic timing makes all of his scenes enjoyable, while Rush's insatiable Barbossa is both creepy and poignant.
But on to the DVD extras:
Keira Knightley and Jack Davenport give hilarious commentary on selected scenes; I wished their commentary existed for every scene in the movie, as it was preferable to the commentary from Johnny Depp and Gore Verbinski.  Verbinski rambles on about the writing of the movie (superfluous, since the writers' commentary is also available) and Depp seems more interested in watching the movie than giving any insight into his character or the experience of filming.  You feel as though he wishes Verbinski would shut up for a few minutes.
The writers' commentary is definitely the most informative.  For example: The phrase at the end of the Tortuga pub scene between Sparrow and Gibbs (""Take what you can, give nothing back!"") is a phrase that was used by the actual sailors on the Lady Washington (the movie's ""Interceptor""). The writers also talk about what each actor brings to his or her role, how they adapted their characters, where the story comes from and what dialogue was improvised.  They also give hints about the eventual sequel.
Some of the other extras are entertaining, but I would most recommend:
Deleted and Alternate Scenes
Blooper Reel (though not as extensive as one would hope)
Diary of a Pirate
Walt Disney Archival material (you can see the original ride and its conception in the 50s!)
Moonlight Scene Progression [*Hidden material on this page: press the down arrow until the pirate skeleton's tooth is highlighted, then press enter for a brief interview with the man who was Johnny Depp's inspiration for Captain Jack.]
Disney comes through on this DVD with a closer look at the technology involved in the movie and the background and inspiration of the story.  If you loved the theatrical version, you won't be disappointed by this DVD.",1072396800,,2414,5.047738693467337
1494734,5,B00005JM5E,"Believe the hype. This is the best summer ""blockbuster"" to come along in years. Maybe decades. I'm thinking since ""Raiders"".
This is a movie that will appeal to an impossibly broad spectrum of filmgoer. Fans of ""old movies"" will marvel at the delirious swordfights and the appropriately hammy performances. Post-modern elitists will giggle at the witty screenplay and Depp's perfect performance...he's taking the material straight on, yet simultaneously winking at the audience. Kids and teens will love the action, the jokes and the walking skeletons.
Seriously. There's a reason this made a couple of hundred millions dollars this summer. It's a film everyone can like.",1072396800,,671,5.4
1494735,5,B00005JM5E,"I was not too sure about this movie from the previews I saw. Afterall, Johnny Dep was wearing make-up and looked quite feminine! Did I really want to see this? The answer is a resounding ""YES!"" Johnny Dep is masterful and creative in the role of Jack Sparrow. Dep created his own style of pirate that made Disney very worried at first. However, those who trusted Dep's genius talked the rest of the Disney crew into letting Dep Jack Sparrow his own way and it was well worth it! Who wants to see another rendition of a boring ""Argh matey"" pirate? I would far prefer to see the staggering, slurring, yet incredibly agile and ingenius pirate that Dep created.
Of course, another draw to the movie is Dep's co-star, Orlando Bloom (Legolas in The Lord of the Rings) as Will Turner. Orlando performs as Dep's straight man, but has comedic lines as well. Bloom does a great job as Will Turner - and looks great as well!
Finally, the special effects were top rate - what with pirates turning into skeletons every time the moon's rays hit them. Pirates of the Carribean is a definite must see - again and again!",1072396800,,1103,4.492537313432836

They had everything they needed to make one....except a good script. Next time lets hope they write thier way into something good.  This movie totally jumped the shark.

I should have trusted my instincts.  As adventure movies go, it's fairly pedestrian; a lot of action and noise, mega-zillion-dollar special effects; we've seen it all before.  But a good cast helps make the movie watchable.  Keira Knightly makes a sweet-sassy heroine; Orlando Bloom is winning and likeable as her young hero; and Geoffrey Rush is suitably malicious as the evil pirate captain, sneering and leering through a mouthful of teeth that never saw a dentist.  In fact, all the pirates are excellent; nothing romantic about this lot -- they look and act like the dregs of humanity they are supposed to represent.  But without Johnny Depp, the film would be eminently forgettable.  Depp is a knockout hamming it up as the hapless Captain Jack Sparrow, raccoon eyes smoldering and flashing inside rings of black eye shadow; he's a marvelous comedy actor and gives the movie a dimension it would never have had without him.  In fact, he's the main reason I was able to sit through this film.  Aside from its length, the movie doesn't demand anything of us, you just take it or leave it, however you're so inclined.

1494811,4,B00005JM5E,"Oh, pardon me...but I remember a time when Disney films used to inspire Disneyland theme park attractions - NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND! ""The Pirates of the Carribean"" is a convoluted tale with Johnny Depp at its helm. It's based (loosely) on the Disney theme park attraction that's been around since the mid-1950's. It's basically a sea epic, with a ton of digital effects and some good bits of comedy (again - directly gleaned from the Disneyland ride; the bit with the pirates in prison, trying to con a dog with the keys to their cell, is just one of the direct rip offs from the ride)but over all - and this must be said - ""The Pirates of the Carribean"" lacks in originality and the swell of overwhelming good fun that 'classic Disney adventures'- like ""Swiss Family Robinson"" had.
TRANSFER: There's good news here. A rich, solid DVD picture with bold colors, fine detail throughout, excellent contrast and shadow levels and minimal digital distractions - all add up to a really fine visual presentation. The digital effects are 'obviously' digital but hey, I seem to be the odd ball this way; I prefer a more real-looking film experience to something that looks like it came from a comic book. The audio is 5.1 and nicely balanced.
EXTRAS: A making of, some junket stuff, the theatrical trailer and some interviews.
BOTTOM LINE: I didn't like the film.

But enough about the superficial aspects of the movie. When I first heard a movie was being made after an amusement ride I scoffed, in the way that only a northeastern liberal of predominantly WASP ancestory can.  But I was terribly wrong.  Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush bring their characters(the former a lovable scoundrel, the latter a bloodthirsty fiend) to life in a way I could have never imagined before watching it.
It would be hard to find a line with more pathos that that of Rush's when he tells Knightly, ""I feel nothing, not the wind in my face, nor the spray of the sea, nor the warmth of a women's touch"".  As for Depp, whenever on screen he steals the show, parrticularly Bloom who so often seems lost in some medieval drama of many more centuries past(i.e. ""youre the one who threatened Miss Swann""-- far too proper to refer to the woman he loves by her first name).

1494816,5,B00005JM5E,"The idea of making a movie based on an amusement park ride -in this case, The Pirates of the Caribbean attraction at Disney World - seems risky to me. This be the formula for making The Biggest Dumb Movie of the Year. But somewhere in the moviemaking process, Disney found some of its magic at work. ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" may not be the greatest film released in 2003, but it is, in my eyes, the most fun. Ironically, it has much in common with the thrill ride which inspired it because, ditzy and illogical as it may be, it is so wildly imaginative, you want to turn around and experience it again.
The story takes place a few hundred years ago in and around a Caribbean island owned by the British. Elizabeth [Keira Knightley] is the beautiful young daughter of the island's governor. She seems destined to be married off to a priggish British Naval officer, though her heart belongs to Will [Orlando Bloom], a handsome blacksmith's apprentice whose life she saved years ago during a pirate attack.
The love story is a good setup for the action that follows. Enter Jack Swallow [Johnny Depp], a `mad as a hatter' pirate in need of a ship. Enter the Black Pearl, the fastest ship in the Caribbean, and its cursed crew. The Black Pearl's captain, Barbossa [Geoffrey Rush], is the one who marooned Jack, the former captain, on a small island. After this dastardly act, Barbossa and his mates tried to steal some Aztec gold. Turns out the gold had a curse on it. Unless they retrieve a medallion now worn by Elizabeth, they are doomed to being half dead and half alive zombies. Can Elizabeth help to save the day? Can Will accept his true origins, including the real story of the medallion? Can the dazed and confused Jack Sparrow come through?
I don't think Depp has ever not taken a role seriously, and here he creates one his most memorable characters - his Sparrow is one of the most unlikely heroes you will ever see onscreen. His decision to play Sparrow as a cross between a lunatic and a drag queen was a stroke of genius and adds immeasurably to the movie's success. It may be that his performance inspired the other actors - all good ones to begin with - to rise to the challenge. Or perhaps director Gore Verbinski [""The Ring"", ""The Mexican'] just has a way with actors. Whatever the reason, the acting here is way above average for a movie of this type.
""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is highly recommended.",1072224000,,2418,4.548165137614679

Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow is an absolute riot, the funniest movie character I've seen in a long, long time & the supporting cast do a great job as well. Special mention for Geoffrey Rush who does his finest Worzel Gummidge impression as Captain Barbosa! It's nice to see a lot of English actors getting themselves into such a big movie & it certainly looks like Orlando Bloom is going to get himself a nice little movie career on the back of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy.

The sets are grand, the acting is good, the script is sharp, the special effects are stunning...this movie has it all.  Johnny Depp is an absolute blast to watch.  His character of Captian Jack Sparrow is so well crafted and so much fun to watch, you just want to see more of him.  Keira Knightly is gorgeous as well as tough and Orlando Bloom gets to use some of the sword fighting skills he learned in Lord of the Rings.  The story centers on a ghost ship, The Black Pearl, which is full of cursed pirates.  Jack Sparrow is the rightful Captian and is looking to get his ship back.  The current Captian, played by Geoffrey Rush, is only intrested in removing the curse and doesn't care who or what gets in the way.  Knightly plays the girl who doesn't want to marry the stuffy commander that her father has betrothed her to, but finds something in Blooms character that drives him to her rescue after she is kidnapped by the Pirates.  The adventures take us all over the Caribbean, to seedy ports and hidden caves.  Broadsides and sword fights ensue as the everyone wants something different, whether be a ship, the last of a set of cursed gold coins, or the woman you love.",1072224000,,1396,4.52191235059761

However, Johnny Depp was in Pirates so I decided to see it - but not expecting too much.
For what this movie is, it's a great movie. No, it's not some dramatic, sordid story about love and heartbreak. It's not an indie film that borders on being pretentious. This is just a really fun, witty and colorful movie. Johnny Depp plays the slightly snarky Jack Sparrow and does an amazing job. His performance is a bit over the top - but not so much so that it beecomes obnoxious.
I'm going tos ay it again: I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I was expecting some glossy hollywood fluff and I was genuinely entertained for the entire duration of the film. ALL the characters were developed nicely, the story was strong and the visuals were great.

This movie is nothing short of amazing!! I was really surprised at how true Disney kept the story to the Disney World ride - while still keeping it a great movie.
Jerry Bruckheimer is the producer of this action-packed-hilarious movie starring Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightly.
The story:
When the daughter of the Govenor, Elizabeth, is kidnapped by cursed pirates of the infamous Black Pearl ship, it is up to Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) the blacksmith, son of a pirate who is in love with Elizabeth, and Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) the quirky and eccentrically charming pirate with a grudge, to save her. What none of them know, however, is that the Black Pearl and the entire crew are cursed forever as the undead (they look like regular people during the day, but are revealed as skeletons by the moonlight - and they can not be killed) and the only thing that can break the curse is the blood of the son of the man who bestowed the curse upon them - the blood of Will Turner.
The effects in this movie are amazing! I was blown away! The action scenes and sword fighting is superb, never a dull moment. The acting is spectacular!! Especially by johnny Depp - Captain Jack Sparrow. His blend of Keith Richards and Pepe La Pue are absolutely hilarious and mesmorizing! You can not take your eyes off of him!!
This is a movie that is great for the whole family - adults and kids (although I don't recommend for very young children who might find some scenes scary, and some are slightly violent)

The movie opens with an eerie prolouge, then jumps right into the swashbuckling, and mystery of the plot.  Johnny Depp is great in his role of the not so loved Pirate Captain Jack Sparrow.  He is hilarious.  Orlando Bloom ( From The Lord of the Rings Movies) is wonderful as the black smith Will Turner who joins Jack Sparrow (Depp) in the epic journey to capture The Black Pearl to rescue  Elizabeth Swan the governers Daughter played brilliantly by Kiera Knightly.  The Captain of The Black Pearl is  Captain Barbossa who is played  by Geoffrey Rush.  Rush is evil comedic and the perfect fit.
Overall this movie sweeps you off your feet and transports you into the epic jouney of action adeventure and comedy.
The only possibly down point of the movie is the running time, running at an approximate 143 Minutes.
Now to the Special Features.  The 2nd disc is full of fun facts and a 45 minute making of the movie.  There are around 7 Hours of entertaining  special features. Including Commentaires of the movie.

I am a big Disney fan so this review is not anti-Disney.
Much like movies based upon video games, movies based upon theme park rides just don't work. Or haven't worked yet. This movie had everything you could ask for. Major Stars, Major Director, Major Producer but NO PLOT. That is not fair of course it had a plot, just not a good one. And the plot that they did have has so many holes in it that as the end I was left asking myself ""did I really just see what I thought I did?""
Special effects were great, but once again studios don't care about the writing. How can you have a good movie without a good script?
But it all comes down to box office and since this one made millions, there will be more like it and the Hulk and Dare Devil and the list could go on forever.

Instead I got medicore action scenes, barely giggles, and cardbored, forgettable characters. What really amazed me was that this movie had no centerpiece action sequence. There really wasn't a single action scene to remember the movie by, or a memorable moment period for that matter.

I'd recommend this movie to anyone.
On the other hand, Geoffrey Rush also plays perhaps the defining role so far in his career.  The makeup, scars and of course, those rotten teeth, really places him in the movie, a pirate captain, cursed for eternity.  All that I can say is; AAAARRRRR!

1494940,5,B00005JM5E,"As a happy-ending adventure comedy, this is one of the cleverest and funniest I have seen. Rather than comment on the whole film, I'll limit myself to one character in one scene. Johnny Depp, of course, steals the movie from his co-stars (as the cover pic on the DVD acknowledges). His entrance into the harbor was well worth the price of admission to the theater, where I first saw the film. We get TWO side-spitting sight-gags in the scene, even before Depp speaks to a living soul. The beauty of watching this film on DVD is that you can replay that scene and any others to your heart's content (including slow motion). AND you can switch on the subtitles in case you don't hear some dialogue for whatever reasons. The DVD set includes a whole array of extras: historical stuff about real pirates, deleted scenes, out-takes (bloopers), comments by cast members, and info about how dozens of things were planned and achieved, including the sea battles, the actors' make-up and costumes, the elaborate sets, the fencing scenes, and of course the wonderful digital special effects. Granting that a 5-star rating for an adventure comedy is LESS than a 5-star rating for a serious film (but more than a 5-star rating for a goofy Leslie Nielsen parody), it is a strong recommendation for people who are in the mood for that sort of entertainment.

Dont get me wrong, this movie was very entertaining in its own sense but not something to watch over and over again, once for me was enough.

1495007,4,B00005JM5E,"I really must give two separate reviews.  The first, and easiest.
  This is a fun movie.  A dark end sinister villain plagues ports, a valiant and noble hero, with a entertaining yet effective keith richards sidekick.  Johnny depp as always is enamouring, and the eye shadow really works for him.  Its a movie you can sit down, have some fun, and really just be entertained.  But because of the Vastness of the production, I had higher expectations in certain departments.  The classic ""marry me even though im a stuffy jerk"" line has been used to death, even by Disney.  And our hero is basically a bumbling Legolas.  While I honestly like orlando bloom, I think maybe he should have finished acting school.  Elves are one thing, they don't show emotion.
as far as overall nautical realism, its a joke.  a crew of a half dozen can keep a ship afloat for months?  unlikely.  and ripped sails generally means no moving.  but of course, thats not what this film is about.  if thats what we wanted, then a flying mustang would have put bruckheimer on the butcher block.  realism on the sea calls for master and commander: far side of the world.  This calls for you to stop and rethink its purpose.  its a fun family action film that just happens to pull you in, unlike most others films that simply present you with a scene and expect you to accept it.  Verbinski truly has a knack for creating a 3D environment.  you not only feel what you see is real, you feel what is behind you is real too.  you feel the sun, you smell the salt, and most of all, you can smell those pirates.
this movie should have come out 20 years ago when i was a kid.  I would have been so thankful.  but im thankful that it came out, even though i don't want to be a pirate anymore...this makes me feel i still could.

I had obviously never seen it, but they saw it twice in theaters and once the DVD came out they had most of the lines memorized.  So, last night, they sat me down and told me to watch it.  Literally it happened as ""Oh my God!  This is, like, the best movie ever!  You will, like, love it!""  Keep in mind we are 15 years old haha.  The first 45 minutes weren't that bad, but then it just dragged on and on.  Johnny Depp slurred all of his lines and I could not understand much of what he was saying.  The fight scenes were so long and it was the same thing over and over.  Orlando Bloom, in my opinion, was very boring and lifeless.  Maybe his character was supposed to be that way, but still.  I kept staring at the DVD box when an hour and 30 minutes had gone by, hoping the movie would end soon. I still had another 45 minutes. Eventually, my two friends were so enraptured with the film (and Orlando Bloom) that I let myself fell asleep for the last 20 minutes, something I wanted to do after the first 45 minutes of the movie.

1495010,4,B00005JM5E,"Don't let the fact that this is a movie based on Disney theme ride and made by Disney.  It's not a kids movie although it's perfectly fine for kids as well.
It's a nice throwback to the kind of swashbuckling pirate movies of the 40's.  Johnny Depp is fanatastic in his over the top performance of the slightly foppish and drunk, Captain Jack Sparrow.  Jack is trying to get his ship back from a rival pirate played by Geoffrey Rush.
Orlando Bloom is along and actually does most of the swashbuckling as he tries to rescue his love from Rush and joins forces with Depp.
Maybe slighly scarey for very young kids as Rush's crew turns to skeletons in the moonlight due to a curse which they are trying to lift.
Great battle sequences with the vintage ships and strong swordfights.  Romance and comedy thrown in to boot.  A rousing adventure.
The DVD has many very good extras including multiple commentaries, deleted scenes, making of feature, pirates history, and more.",1071792000,,966,4.658823529411765

When I finally got the DVD, I watched all the extras and this DVD is jam packed with extras.  They say there's over 10 hours of extra stuff.  I'm not sure that it's quite that much (several items are repeated, especially historical commentary), but it definitely was interesting and plentiful.
My biggest disappointment though, was the DVD version of the movie.  IT WAS NOT WHAT I SAW IN THE THEATERS!!!  Quite a few of the scenes were shortened!  Most of the shortened scenes were included on the DVD in the Deleted & Extended scenes section, but I wanted to see the version that I saw in the theaters.  My wife and I were both very disappointed in this little trick.
Maybe the version we saw in the theaters was eventually shortened later in it's run.  I saw the movie the week after it came out.  But that still doesn't excuse the fact that the DVD was also cut.",1071705600,,968,4.3277777777777775
1495074,5,B00005JM5E,"PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN is one of 2003's most popular movies -- and rightfully so. It's a swashbuckling tale in true Errol Flynn tradition. If there's a negative, it is that maybe there's too much action. That's a pretty pale complaint. The story is fun and entertaining, the settings are elaborate, the scenery beautiful, and the players are excellent. Much has been written and said about Johnny Depp's portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow, and justifiably so. His off-beat interpretation is brilliant and he gets a lot of great lines to go with it. There are a lot of other fine performances here besides Depp's, though, from Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley right on down through the lesser roles. Perhaps my favorite is Geoffrey Rush as the evil Captain Barbossa. Rush brings a delightfully nasty swagger to the part, pulls off the most dramatic scene of the tale well, and also delivers some witty dialogue with a distinct flair.
The package also has a second disc packed with extra material. I'm not a big fan of all the extra ""special features"" packed with movie DVDs. Generally, if I want the movie, I get it. If I don't, I don't. The special features are just extra freight. I've watched most of this second disc, though, and it's worth the extra time and trouble. Of particular interest was the footage of Walt Disney discussing the original concept behind the Disneyland ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" ride and the following trip through it. I remember seeing this material when it originally aired on TV back in 1968 and it was a joy to see it again. Mr. Disney's enthusiasm for this last creation of his is evident. It's also interesting to note the original sets -- some have since been changed in subtle ways over the years to make them more politically correct for today's delicate sensibilities (HA!).
The PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN 2-disc collector's edition is a terrific package. You get a great movie plus some really worthwhile ""special features"" to go along with it. You can't miss. It's fun for all and gets my highest recommendation.",1071619200,3,2052,4.81586402266289
1495075,5,B00005JM5E,"I have seen so many films,old and new, that it is hard for me to find one that is refreshing and original.  I am so often disappointed.  Being a cynic's cynic, I thought to myself, ""How could a Disney film--yea a film based on a Disney theme park ride--possibly be that good?""  Yet I was compelled to watch it.  Unlike so many times before, I have no regrets.  Despite its source of inspiration, this was a very inspired film--very well done.  The story had a sense of originality and the acting was terrific.  Johnny Depp's character stole the show, of course.  It is funny that the editorial review says ""Depp gets all the good lines.""  That was exactly how I described the film to friends, ""Johnny Depp has the best lines.""  The dialogue was terrific.  This was one of the things that appealed to me most about ""The Count of Monte Cristo.""  Depp's Character Captain Jack Sparrow was one of the strangest, most eccentric and cool characters on film in some time.  His acting--I think you would define it method acting--was over-the-top without being cheesy.  Orlando Bloom was great as the idealistic hero.  I can't help but like this actor, too.  I loved his portrayal of Legolas in LOTR.  As I mentioned before, I am usually pretty cynical about such films and half-expected another mindless blockbuster ready-made to spoon-feed to the mindless masses (Independence Day comes to mind).  This movie, however, was a fun, but still intelligently made actioner--great special effects, but not relying on them to carry the film.  I plan to add this one to my collection.  I doubt you will be disappointed.",1071619200,2,1604,4.763636363636364

When I heard Johnny Depp was playing a pirate and modelling his character on Keith Richards, I became intrigued. Depp is one of, if not the, premier actors around. As Jack Sparrow, he steals the show. The rest of the cast do excellent jobs also. The movie has a good pace, has some humour and some great effects. On DVD, it looks and sounds superb, with plenty of extras. Overall, a pleasant surprise.",1071619200,3,557,4.470588235294118

His voice, his mannerisms, and the way he handles each scene make him such a delightful on-screen presence.  This was definitely one of the more entertaining and fun movies of the summer and one any action movie lover should own.  As far as extras are concerned, the deleted scenes are nothing special and the commentary is pretty standard fare, but can be informative if you can sit through it.

As everybody knows, Johnny Depp is more than perfect, but then--so is Orlando Bloom (sigh), and Keira Knightley is their perfect foil. I have seen Geofrrey Rush in all his films, and he never fails to turn in a blockbuster performance, as he does this time around. Since everybody else has already critiqued the film and the acting and the plot, I will confine my comments to why I love this film:
The humor is perfect. The writing is perfect. The music is perfect. The photography is perfect. The acting is superb. The directing is perfect. Um...did I say I love this film?
The extras are more than normally interesting, especially the deleted scenes. I found myself agreeing almost every time that this scene or that should have been deleted. I went through every single extra several times, and I NEVER do that; usually find them boring.

1495152,4,B00005JM5E,"Great movie and Great extra features in the 2-DVD set!  If you're considering buying this DVD you've probably already seen the movie so I won't rant on about how great it is other than saying it's an awesome swashbuckling adventure and Johnnie Depp puts a wonderful spin on the pirate role.  Also, the extra features (2 DVD set) are great and go well beyond the usual paltry stuff that you get on most DVDs.
However, be ye warned that this DVD ONLY PLAYS IN WIDESCREEN ratio - there is no option to format it for a TV with normal dimensions (Why?! - Your guess is as good as mine, - but that's why I only gave this 4 stars instead of five).  So, if you are one of the 98% of us who don't have a widescreen TV, you're going to watch it with those annoying blank areas above and below the picture.  This little fact isn't mentioned on the packaging - except for a little ambiguous snippet in small print under the specifications section on the back.
So, if you'd rather have all of the extra features (which are good) get the DVD set.  But if it's more important to you to see the movie take up your entire TV screen then I suggest you get the video (I'm going to return mine and get the video instead).",1071532800,3,1201,4.22707423580786
1495153,5,B00005JM5E,"An engaging spectacle of mainstream storytelling and action that everyone can enjoy, Pirates of the Caribbean is a real treat.  Based on Disney's theme park ride of the same name, director Gore Verbinski (who helmed the dismal yet surprisingly sucessful The Ring) laces the film with enough action packed scenes to satisfy any action fan, but the true highlight of Pirates of the Caribbean is the standout performance by the always excellent Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, and Depp's performance is worth seeing the film for alone.  Geoffrey Rush's scenery chewing performance as the undead evil Captain Barbosa is a highlight as well, along with lively roles for Orlando Bloom, the comely Kiera Knightley, and Jonathan Pryce.  The swashbuckling stuntwork and superb special effects nicely round out the film, but while Pirates of the Caribbean isn't without it's share of flaws (it is a bit too long for it's own good), it never fails to entertain, and is undoubtadly one of the best films to be released during the summer.  The DVD itself is a work of art, with plenty of extras and features that will please fans of the film.",1071532800,,1134,4.890625

1495155,5,B00005JM5E,"I saw this movie twice in the cinema over the summer and both times I loved it. It was only when I recently bought it on DVD however that I remembered exactly how much I loved it. I have owned it for about a week or so and I have watched it every single day. I never do this with movies. Ever. I get bored easily. The reason for this madness? Reason has nothing to do with it.
Firstly, the script isn't just beginning, middle, end. Each character has a background and story to them, even if you don't find out that much about it. This makes it more...well, not real, but as close as you can get in a movie like this. You could make a movie on each character. That said, the actual plot is genius, with twists and turns and I still can't believe it's two hours long. The time flies when you watch it.
Ah the characters. Johnny Depp steals the show, no question. I've loved JD since I saw Edward Sissorhands and I think this Captain Jack Sparrow is the best character he has ever played. Kiera Knightly, Geoffery Rush and Orlando Bloom are all equally excellent, each playing their part to the hilt. Even the cast extras are pure gold.
Action, Adventure, Romance, Comedy, Eyecandy, Great soundtrack, great graphics...It is everything a movie should be and more. I can't find enough words to share my enthusiasm.
On a DVD exras note: This is well worth the extra dinero. There is a feast of bonus stuff that will keep you amused for hours. There's even a bit where it takes you through the original ride.

Johnny Depp gives a FANTASTIC performance - he's got the comic timing down perfectly right down to his swagger and funny facial expressions.  He's totally awesome in this movie, and should be your main reason for seeing this movie.  He's ADORABLE as Captain Jack Sparrow.  (I'm so glad they are doing the sequel.)

I should start by saying, I didn't really want to see this movie initially.  A lot of the reviews said this movie was about 40 minutes too long.  I'd disagree on the whole.  But I did just tune out for the duration of Scene 11 (the 2 ships attacking each other)after relentless action, piled ontop of more action, with booming music to amplify the action.  Anyway, the story was unique and the acting was great.  Especially Johnny Depp in another great role and Lord of the Rings co-star, Orlando Bloom (who for some reason reminded me of Joaquin Phoenix in this role).  And newcomer Keira Knightley just completed a year of three hit movies (Bend it like Beckham, Pirates, and recently Love Actually).  She and Orlando really have a lot of potential and Johnny is finally getting the recognition he deserves as a truly versatile and dedicated young actor (a successful gen X-er).  I'd definately recommend this movie.

Pirates of the Caribbean meshes a fun script with great acting, well performed action sequences, and the perfect dash of special effects to create something totally original.
This script is truly a fantasy and the writers have done a wonderful job creating their own believable legend for us.  They have mixed the the right amount of believability with the unbelievable along with some great one liners and jokes, and the must have love triangle to make this wonderfully fun script.
No matter how great the script, if you do not have great actors to put it all together it wouldn't work.  Johnny Depp (Capt. Jack Sparrow) was great to watch on the screen.  He is such a great actor with such great range.  He got you rooting for the infamous pirates who are supposed to be the scourge of the seven seas, the perfect bad/good guy.  His partner in crime, Orlando Bloom (Will Turner) was great, the chemistry between Depp as well as his lady love Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann) was great!  Keira not only filled out her corset well, but she filled her part extremely well.
The action scenes where very well done, keeping you on the edge of your seat, but one thing that took this movie to the next level was the great special effects which really filled out the entire story or the curse.

It's all here, plus a good dash of ghostly horror, in the epic new adventure DVD release from Disney, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The $125 million supernatural swashbuckler is indeed loosely based upon the Disneyland ride we all know and love, but it's more of an homage than an adaptation. Director Gore Verbinski, with the help of his talented crew, got the look and feel of the ride just right... I could practically smell the fake fog and the phony gunpowder.

But after all the millions of dollars spent on the outstanding special effects, the costumes, the ships, and the scenery, you will remember one thing about this movie...
How Johnny Depp stole the whole show.
He is absolutely fantastic as Captain Jack Sparrow, the quintessential rogue pirate.  Depp played the part like a druken, drug-addled Keith Richards (he even said Richards was his inspiration), and he is hilarious to watch as you realize you can't take your eyes off him.
Without Depp this movie would be a three star affair in my book, but with the way Depp soared in this movie I give it a 4.5 out of five.",1071100800,14,1109,4.769633507853404

Johnny Depp is hilarious as Captain Jack Sparrow, the infamous Cptn Sparrow gets jailed, slapped, drunk and stuck on an island with Keira Knightly... one of his finest moments is on the desert island where he complains drunkingly about the rum! (just watch and you'l know and laugh)
Orlando Bloom is fabulously dashing as the young Will Turner. He's a blacksmith who gets caught up in all the palava over the curse of the Black Pearl.
If you're wondering, The Black Pearl is a ship. The ship that Geoffrey Rush is captaining. It's Jack Sparrow's old boat. He wants it back. Keira Knightly plays the love interest of Will Turner (amongst doing other things). She has the last coin that will undo a curse set upon those on The Black Pearl. Word to the wise, don't make her wear a corset!

I had very high hopes because of the actors involved, but this movie has no character development, no clarity of plot -- it is merely an action movie, that's it.  Two hours of fighting.  And if you want that, there are plenty of other movies you can watch that are far superior to this one.  Also -- what was Johnny Depp THINKING?  He slurs his words so much in this film that I couldn't understand most of them!  This movie was just plain SAD.

And that's exactly what we did, and I stayed up until 3:30 am watching it.  I watched it again the next day with my children, who also love this movie.  I tell you, I cannot get enough of this movie, and I hope the sequel is just as good, although since Johnny Depp's in that one too, I don't see how it can possibly be bad!!!  I can't say enough good about this movie, and I probably watch it more than any other DVD in my collection (and my collection is quite large)!

It would have been great to get Johnny Depp's perspective on his character and how he got involved in the project in the first place, and there wasn't much on Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom or Keira Knightly either. As for the deleted scenes, some of them should have been in the movie - it would have helped to explain things more.

I'm not one to pay attention to a movie just because of the actors, but hey, even I can't resist a movie with Orlando Bloom in it.  And I'm not just saying that because he's hot (which he is), but he also happens to have talent.

Firstly, there is always a bit of humor. Johnny Depp is masterful in this role, and is a truely amazing actor. He is hilarious, and i personlly just LOVE the way he walks and the way he talks. its like he has a permanent swagger, and a permantent slur. it's hilarious.
The second great attribution to the movie is the way it stays right on task. it does not get lost in the humor, nor does it get lost in the plot. there is always some humor, yet it still right on task with the needed serious scenes.  This is a movie for just about everyone, if your looking for comedy, romance, action, or the combination... its here!
Finally, the acting in this movie is masterful. Every actor/actress played his/her part beautifully. Johnny Depp did an awesome job! The whole cast did an amazing job though.
I would highly reccomend buying this movie/dvd for yourself or for a friend/family member. This would make a great christmas gift or birthday gift. Once again, i would reccomend buying this, it is a great movie, with a great plot, and an amazing cast!!",1071014400,,1250,4.434782608695652

Russell Crowe is equally stunning (although a bit foppish, which I found to be an interesting acting choice) in his depiction of Lt. Christian. Although I found the subplot about the love affair between Leonardo de Caprio and Kate Winslett a bit distracting, the film was redeemed by its massive restaging of the Battle Of Midway, with a memorable cameo by Ben Affleck as a kooky yet dedicated Kamikaze pilot (look fast to catch Ben before he bursts into a ball of flames!). DVD notes: The Def Jam documentary about the influence that the ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" ride at Disneyland has had on the hip-hop community is fascinating. The extra feature about the making of the product tie-in deal with the fast food chains really adds some extra quality time sitting in front of your T.V.

I thought it would go the way of most hyped-up summer blockbusters and be full of special effects but have absolutely zero story. However, I also expected nothing less than yet another brilliant performance from Johnny Depp.
I guess I was half right. Depp was outstanding and has added yet another memorable character of Captain Jack Sparrow to a long list of other distinguished characters such as Ed Wood, Ichabod Crane, Gilbert Grape, and Hunter S. Thompson.
Also excellent was Geoffrey Rush as Depp's nemesis. I think these two actors alone are responsible for taking what would have been a decent movie and making it a thoroughly enjoyable experience.
And for those of you craving action, this movie delivers and then some! While this movie clocked in at just under 2 1/2 hours, I never once felt like it was dragging.
Also worth checking out is the making-of documentary on the bonus disc. It is really fun and interesting to see exactly how much went into the making of this epic film, not to mention the entire crew's passion and overall enjoyment in participating in this project.

When the sailors turn into the undead, the transformation is unbelievable. The integration of the actors and the computer-generated creatures is seamless.

  As for the DVD, some people may have problems with the second DVD. There's very fine print on the back of the box that says not all features are available on all players.

1495780,5,B00005JM5E,"Most of the time, I am a sucker for the smaller, twisty mysteries and thrillers ala Mulholland Dr., Memento, Brazil, Identity and Vertigo. I love extraordinarily complicated plot twists, and quirky films. That said, Pirates of the Caribbean may well be the most surprising choice for me to make as the early contender for the best film of the year.
Pirates is an adventure film in the spirit of the Indiana Jones trilogy - it is lovingly crafted, and a whole lot of fun. Johnny Depp is one of the most surprising choices for a lead actor in a summer Bruckheimer movie, but is he ever perfect in Pirates. The dialogue is witty to begin with, but Depp invigorates every line with an entirely fresh interpretation. All others acquit themselves nicely (Bloom on his way to becoming the next Brad Pitt? and Rush and Knightley putting in stellar performances), but Depp is without a doubt the star of this show.
The curse (the pirates turn into skeletons in the moonlight) is a nice twist on the normal pirate movie, giving this enough originality to leap out from the rest of the genre. The fight scenes are well done, but also startlingly original. Typical fight scenes are usually rather straightforward, but in the case of Pirates, sometimes it almost feels like a Jackie Chan movie in that they make use of many things in the fights. Not only that but often, the fight scenes are laced with humor, and, surprisingly, originality.
It's hard to pinpoint what exactly makes Pirates work so well, but perhaps the best way to put it is that it simply has everything I come to expect or want from a movie these days. It has its eerie moments, its funny moments, adventurous moments, sad moments - it has romance, adventure, mystery, horror...the movie is easily accessible to anyone between the ages of, well, 5 to 95. And contrary to the seemingly popular opinion, this movie went by like a breeze for me. In fact, the only problem I could think of for this film is the horrificly lengthy title.
I know that almost everyone will enjoy this film at the very least, but this is for me the epitome of great movie making. For me it even surpasses such stellar mindtwist movies like Mulholland Dr., Memento, and Brazil. Why, you ask? The three mentioned are fantastically original, but sometimes that's not enough. I love those three to death, but Pirates of the Caribbean is probably the single most entertaining movie I've ever seen. No, the storyline isn't the most creative ever but boy, that dialogue sure is smart and witty. They make magic on that screen for the full two hours and a half running time, and that is what going to the cinema is all about. I'll be watching this one for many years to come, and perhaps that's the single best compliment I could ever give a movie.
p.s. to the reviewer who said that (s)he was disappointed about it being only widescreen - well in case you didn't know, 99% of films today ARE FILMED IN WIDESCREEN and are meant to be watched like that! FULLSCREEN MOVIES are almost all the time PAN & SCAN which means they just cut off the left and right sides of the picture and expand it so it fits your tv, so you get in many cases over 50% loss in picture. The black bars are NOT blocking off any picture or anything, it's when u have fullscreen that you're losing picture. If you don't want to watch a film the way the director intended it to be filmed, then don't buy it. PLAIN and SIMPLE. I'm glad that more films are being released on dvd for only widescreen now slowly but surely, as half the people in the world still seem to be so ignorant of the fact that PAN & SCAN/FULLSCREEN is not the way the director intended the movie to be. (the only exception is movies made around the 1950s i believe and before...those were originally filmed in fullscreen and are meant to be seen that way)",1070755200,,3820,4.521676300578035

He is so funny and likeable creating one of the best characters in recent movie history. Keira Knightly also does a great job. She turns in a sexy, fiery, and fun performance as Elizabeth. Orlando Bloom makes the most of his supporting role, but it's Johnny who steals the show from everyone. The special effects are nothing like I have ever seen. Brilliant! When the pirates turn into walking skeletons, it will amaze you. Pay special attention to the final fight scene between Johhny Depp and Geoffrey Rush.

The DVD is a fantastic deal, with 19 deleted scenes (most of which should have been left in the movie, in my opinion) including a funny improvisation between Johhny Depp and Barbossa's pirates. A blooper real is included as well, and our loveable Captain Jack never once drops the accent, even when he makes a mistake! Commentary, the making of, it's all included!!!

For those of you who don't know or haven't seen it yet, the story is about a group of cursed pirates and two mens quest to rescue a woman they hold captive.  Been there, done that....

And this movie was right on my order and it covers the fear of pirates and how they lived to enrich themselves. There is also a buzz in the air that a sequel is coming, that would be another great movie, which I am going to see for SURE, I hope you all do too.",1070668800,,640,3.819548872180451
1495876,5,B00005JM5E,"I'll admit, when I first saw the trailer for this film, I thought, ""Well, AHAHA. Another Pirate (based on a ride no less!) film to sink in the box office. Nice job, Disney."" But, being a huge Lord of the Rings fan, I had to see for the sole purpose of the beauty that is Orlando Bloom.
And, what do you know? 'Pirates' ended up being my favourite film of the year! Johnny Depp is absolutely hysterical as Captain Jack Sparrow, an ubsurd yet charmingly insane pirate who wants nothing more than to get his ship back from the betraying Barbossa, played to perfection by Jeffrey Rush. When Barbossa kidnaps the beautiful Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly), Jack teams up with Elizabeth's childhood sweetheart Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). All the while, stiff anti-pirate Commodor Norrington (Jack Davenport) brings up the rear in his own attempts to rescue Elizabeth. As previous reviewers have noted, this film would've sunk without Johnny Depp, who suprised many first-time-fans with his unconventionally comical skills. Bloom, Knightly, Rush and Davenport were also perfectly cast and give devoted performances. This film shows what diverse actors Depp and Rush are, and certainly converted me :)
The plot is oh so perfectly Disney. Skeletal pirates, cheesy one-liners, happily-ever-after ending. And yet is was so much more. As Disney's first ever PG-13 film, 'Pirates' is action-packed and fast-moving, a just plain *fun* watch. When you're not drooling over the cast's good-looks or marveling at Depp's acting skills, you're caring about the characters and dreading the end.
The DVD contains a film-geek's dreams. A hysterical blooper reel (""Arrr, swash swash buckle buckle""), documentaries, deleted/altered scenes, diaries, and so much more. The cast commentary of Keira Knightly and Jack Davenport is particularly fun (""Look at my cleavage!"").
Overall, a fun film for kids and adults. I hear tell of a sequel with all the cast returning (with the exception of Rush and Jack the Monkey). Hopefully we'll have a Pirates 2 to look forward to next year!",1070668800,,2052,5.1467065868263475
1495877,5,B00005JM5E,"Way cool family fun.  This movie is very entertaining and definitely one worth owning.  The script was well written with lots of twists and turns and surprises.  The general premise that it is based upon a ride at Disneyland at first caused me to think it would be sort of cheesy and made for the ten and under crowd, but that impression was wrong.
The heroine is beautiful and smart and not a just  one dimensional eye candy, while the two hero's, one a pirate captain and the other a reluctant pirate, are both multidimensional and fun to watch.  In a way this is a coming of age story about a young blacksmith that has a past he doesn't realize and a longing for a woman he can't have.
The acting is good and the action smooth, this is a high recommendation for a thrill ride of a movie.",1070668800,2,790,4.275167785234899
1495878,4,B00005JM5E,"The whole family enjoyed this action-adventure-romantic comedy.  Sometimes it is hard to write a script that combines those 4 elements into a coherent story but it all works here.  There is no nudity or simulated sex or fowl language.
The special effects are above average, with an occasion WOW!  The battle scenes when the bad pirates attack Port Royal is awesomely shot and visually very realistic.  You will see scenes with sets that you will recognize from the Walt Disney World attraction.
Even those who do not care for Depp (because he has said he hates the USA and has moved to France) will agree he does an excellent job playing Capt Jack Sparrow.
For my son, there are two things that make a movie great.  Swords or Litesabers and Sword-Litesaber fights.  This one has plenty of excellent sword fights.  Early in the movie Capt Jack Sparrow and Will have a very inventive sword fight that combines this movies hallmark, action with comedy.  The hugh sword in the end of the movie is marvelous fun, reminding one of the great fight at the end of THE MUMMY with Branden Fraser.
Jack and Will end up teaming up to rescue the fair damsel.  There is sufficient romantic tension in the film to keep my daughters interest.  The movie moves along at an excellent pace keeping everyones attention all the way.
I couldn't give this 5 stars, because there are other swashbucklers I like a little better, but it is a strong 4 star movie you will want to buy and own.",1070668800,,1464,4.596153846153846

Indeed it wasn't, and isn't. I think that ""Pirates"" surprised many with its witty lines, engaging twists and turns, and memorable, fun characters. Johnny Depp's performance as the staggering, rum-drinking and disarmingly gorgeous Captain Jack Sparrow will wow even the most hardened movie critics, and Geoffrey Rush does a fabulous job creating a despicable villain that you can't help but feel for.

1495883,5,B00005JM5E,"I can not tell you how surprized I was with this movie. When I first heard they were making a movie based on a theme park ride I could only imagine how bad this could get. Instead, I'm treated to a wonderful adventure that never takes itself too seriously. This has become one of my favorite movies of the past decade.
The movie succeeds on many levels. The four main characters, Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow (Pirate), Orlando Bloom as Will Turner (Blacksmith and son of pirate) Kiera Knightly as Elizabeth Swann (Daughter of Governor) and Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa(Evil Pirate), are perfectly cast. Over and over I'm amazed with the acting of Johnny Depp. He is able to take a character and make it his own. Orlando Bloom surprizes as he makes you forget he played Legolas in Lord of the Rings. Geoffrey Rush absolutely steals every scene he's in. And of course Kiera Knightly plays off each character perfectly.
The Plot is creative and original, with MANY surprizes. The musical score soars. Even the supporting roles are interesting and well developed.
The DVD has two discs. The second is the extra features which are overall good. I thought the blooper reel was cute, but not as good as it could have been. It also has the original ""Wonderful World of Disney"" featurette that had Walt Disney introducing the ride at Disneyland.
There are MANY things to enjoy here. But if you're like me you will just sit ack and let the adventure begin. I can only hope for a sequel!",1070668800,4,1488,4.640151515151516

But it is fun, entertaining and witty, something that so many Hollywood blockbusters have been missing over the past few years. This is an adventure movie on the high seas and the beautiful locales of the Carribean islands, that will keep you thoroughly entertained right through until the end.
The casting in this movie is excellent, and Johnny Depp really steals the show with his Keith Richards-esque pirate. Geoffrey Rush is always good, Orlando Bloom is a fast rising star, as is the beautiful Keira Knightley, who will surely be appearing on more of our local screens with her string of success including ""Bend it like Beckham"", ""Pirates"", and ""Love Actually"".
The DVD offers alot of good behind the scenes vignettes, enough to keep the lovers of this movie busy for quite some time. I believe this movie will continue to entertain for many years to come, so it is a worthwhile purchase for those who like adventure flicks.",1070668800,,1113,4.742268041237113

Excellent performances, decent plot, but the spectacular special effects really, really, are the icing on a tasty cake. the scenes as the skeletons move from moonlight to people in the dark are very well done.
I look forward to the 2nd disk of extras for tomorrow night's diversion, if they have anything on how the SFX were accomplished or pieces of them actually doing it, i would watch as carefully as i did the movie.

Better yet when I originally went to see the movie in the theater, there were quite a few kids filling the seats...so it's a good movie to watch with children. (Good babysitter material.)

1495940,4,B00005JM5E,"I saw this for the first time on DVD upon its release, so I have a relatively fresh view of the movie.  I missed it this summer because I was living on an island and sailing, so the nautical theme really appealed to me.  In fact the lack of theatres made me a bit annoyed.
In terms of story and direction, this is just an average (not bad) summer Hollywood popcorn flick.  It has all the set pieces to put you on the edge of your seat, and plenty of bang for your buck.  The undead pirates becoming skeletons as they walk though beams of moonlight was a particularly inspired touch.  What puts this over the top to become a great summer flick, however, is the acting.  Kira Knightly and Orlando Bloom put on fine performances, but as many have already noted Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush own this picture.  If the Oscars gave awards for spectacularly over-the-top performances, these guys would be in like flint.
Rush just oozes with the amusing sort of evil; the kind of evil that you don't take too seriously, but adds that needed element of danger to the movie.  It really is a long way from ""Shine.""
Johnny Depp apparently found a great mass outlet for his surreal character acting style (as a friend of mine noted, he's sort of a charater actor in a leading man's body).  He's supposedly channeling Keith Richards, and it shows.  I also detected some residual elements left over from Depp's mindbogglingly good portrayal of Hunter S. Thompson a few years back.  Check out some of Captain Jack Sparrow's hand motions and running stances if you need some proof.  Depp also gets some great one-liners, and gives them the best delivery this side of Bill Murray.
The disc is technically superior too.  If the picture isn't what the film geeks (so I'm one too; just not a particularly technical-minded one) call ""reference quality,"" I don't know what is.  I played the DTS track and it was going wild in all of the speakers of my living room.
As far as extras go, the 1968 special about the opening of the Pirates ride is particularly amusing.  Walt himself makes an appearance, and the female hosts come across as ther Stepford Wives.  Very creepy.  The featurette give the audience a run through of the ride itself too.  I remember totally digging it as a kid at Disney World, but I think the room full of animatronics would be a bit creepy these days (imagine being theguy or gal that has to clean them at night after the park is closed... spooky!).  There is a documentary on real life pirates present on the disc too.  It's geared towards a younger audience (well, at least attention span wise), but still manages to get some good information across.
This is the sort of film that puts brainless entertainment in the best possible light, and threatens to make a good name for it.  A solid movie and a solid DVD.  And if you're of age, I would heartily recommend taking in this movie with a bottle of Carribean rum.  It'll get you screaming along with all of the ""Ahrrrs!""",1070582400,3,2975,4.5299625468164795
1495941,4,B00005JM5E,"Johnny Depp is a riot and the centerpiece of this film. He adds an almost rock star quality to his character of Captain Jack Sparrow.  Just think Keith Richards only younger.  Depp is sarcastic, witty, calm, playful and comical.  He's also intelligent and manipulative in a good sense.  Captain Jack Sparrow is determined to seize his mutinied ship the Black Pearl from the mutineer himself Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush).  A ghost ship the Black Pearl's crew is seeking the last piece of gold and the son of a late pirate in order to reverse the curse they brought upon themselves and one that brings new meaning to the term ""skeleton crew"".

The special effects are critic-proof cheesy --- when they look bad, they're just right for the tone of the film. When they look good, they look good. (The ships, in particular, look great.) The other actors do a predictable but entertaining job as they talk about love and death and the importance of treasure. It's fun because it's so loose, but there isn't a moment when you think ""I'm watching a classic here."" This is a modern day B movie.
But Johnny Depp raises it to another level. His slurred speech, make-up, and costume are so over-the-top, he seems to be satirizing pirates while playing one. Depp is having fun, not taking one bit of this seriously, and the audience is in on the joke. If you ever want to make a point to someone about the importance of casting, just mention this movie. Without Johnny Depp, it would have sunk at the box office. With Johnny Depp, it became an accidental blockbuster, and with good reason: it's genuinely fun.",1070582400,7,1112,4.737113402061856

The producers were a bit worried about Depp's potrayal of his character. Depp told them that they could fire him if he couldn't portray the character as he saw fit.
I would actually rate the extra features higher than the actual movie. There is so much information including interactive exploring of a pirate ship, entertaining factual information on life as a pirate, etc. Like most of Disney's productions, Pirates is well made, and entertaining.

1496075,5,B00005JM5E,"The Pirates of the Caribbean is one of the best movies I have seen yet.  This movie keeps you entertained throughout it's entire duration.  From the witty comments and brain teasers that are given by Jack Sparrow, otherwise known as johnny Depp, to the exciting fight scenes, you are completely enthrawled in this movie.  Even if you are not satisfied with the film, you still can find a couple of key parts that are entertaining for you.
  The first scene is very catchy for the viewers.  The way they started it out, with the little girl finding the medallion on the boy, and then seeing the destruction of the pirates and their ship sailing away.  It makes you yearn for the rest of the movie, to be able to know what else is to become of the children and also for when you will see that ghostly ship of the pirates once more.  Then they cut strait to Jack Sparrow riding in on his sinking ship.  The look of confidence and strong will made me excited to watch the every move of his character and film work.
  Throughout the rest of the movie you are taken through many emotional, personal, and physical battles.  All the action keeps your eyes moving and your brain focused on what is happening.  You never get bored during this film because after every scene, you are left waiting eagerly for the next one and wondering what daft Jack Sparrow will do next.  The different ventures and quarrels are so exciting that you know you can always expect something great is to come.
  The ending is probably the most amazing part of the entire movie.  The fight scene, the plot and plan of Jack Sparrow that unravels through out the movie.  It throws you off guard when you see it.  You find out that some pirates can actually be great men and good people.  You see friendships made and rules bent.  You see fights and quarrels of long times brought to an end.  The ending makes you want more as you watch it come to the movies end.
  In conclusion, if you haven't seen this movie or think that you would not like it, you should see it anyways.  The colors and different artistic things catch your eye.  You are entertained during the movie, no matter what.  I saw this movie twice in theaters and twice since it has been released on DVD.  I can almost gaurantee that you will be satisfied.",1070496000,4,2286,4.430288461538462

It was done right though, has a great cast, good direction, nice special effects and great action. The script is just a little weak though. With lesser actors this movie might not have worked. I do see that's it's a little silly to have sword fight after sword fight with pirates that can't be killed though. I guess they think if they cut off enough limbs they won't be able to fight back anymore.

  Johny Depp is so much fun that it's easy to over-look that it's silly to fight un-dead pirates. His character and performance could've made even Cuthroat Island a good movie. Hell maybe even Muppet Treasure Island lol. His character is odd and totally original. He's an excellent actor don't know he has never been nominated. He adds much needed wit to the movie as does Geoffrey Rush as the cursed villain. Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings) and  Keira Knightley play it straight but are still strong in their roles. Orlanda Bloom is well on his way to being a big action star. Too bad he wasn't around in 1991 because he would've made a better Robin Hood than Kevin Costner. I hear their might be sequels, as long as Johny Depp comes back as Captain Jack Sparrow...I say bring them on. As for making more movies based on Disney rides.

1496079,5,B00005JM5E,"THE MOVIE
 Movies about cursed pirates died out and flopped decades ago but this movie is brings new enthusiasm the pirate genre has been looking forward to. This is a great popcorn flick that has really put the Swash back into Buckling
 This action/ adventure/comedy is loosely based on the ride at Disneyland. Although the similarities are somewhat few and far between this is probably a good thing as it escapes the Disney marketing attempt feel.
 The extremely well chosen cast could never be better with Johnny Depp brilliantly playing the light-hearted mostly-drunk pirate Jack Sparrow (sorry Captain Jack Sparrow). He provides most of the comedy in his one-liners, lucky escapes and defiant bragging. The romance is between the kidnapped Governors daughter Elizabeth Swann, (Kiera Knightly) and Will Turner (played wonderfully by man-of-the-moment Orlando Bloom) who comes to her rescue. The typical cursed pirate, Captain Barbossa of the titular `Black Pearl'  (played by Geoffery Rush) is the all round bad guy shouting traditional pirate phrases.
 The CG (done by Industrial Light and Magic) is literally ground breaking with cursed pirates turning from skeletal to flesh as they battle in and out of moonlight. This gives both an eerie and astonishing effect.
 To round off there are action scenes galore with numerous sword fights and canon fire which are amazing and really keep the film up to speed.
THE EXTRAS
 No DVD is complete nowadays without extras. With a full extra disc there is quite a lot to keep one amused for hours. There are three commentaries, which really depend on what you want to get out of a commentary the first is with Gore Verbinski (director) and Johnny Depp, which is surprisingly quite dull mainly thanking various people for hard work. If you are looking for trivia then the partial commentary with Jerry Bruckheimer (producer) or commentary with scriptwriters is for you, but the one I found the best is the commentary with actors Kiera Knightly and Jack Davenport (who plays Commodore Norrington) This commentary is also partial but is the funniest. The partial commentary is something I have never come across before but is quite an advantage, as you don't have to watch the whole film again and listen to people drone on about scenes that weren't really important to them.
The downfall I felt to this DVD is the interactive menus which if you just want to get the film to play means time is lost waiting for menus to load.
Back to positive and the second disc holds loads of good stuff. The first I checked out was the blooper real with the actors messing up, which you don't quite often get to see. The bad thing about this is that it was only 3mins. There are 19 deleted scenes, which I didn't really feel were very interesting so it just as well they stayed deleted.
 There are many different featurettes on this disc. The ones I'm liking the most is the Epic at Sea, Diary of a Pirate and Fly on the set which are all on the set interviewing actors etc.  which prove very interesting and in depth. There is also ""Walt Disney Wonderful World of Color"" which shows a bit about the ride for all who haven't been on it.
 The last line is I think this is a wonderful movie and the DVD really compliments it well.",1070496000,,3257,4.75886524822695

This movie is pure, old-fashioned popcorn entertainment and it stands to become one of the finest films this year. This film is full of action & adventure and doesn't carry so much of an ounce of worthless drama that tends to drag good quality movies down with it. With the current glut of science fiction film, Pirates brings the failing genre up with a unique twist of swahsbuckling antics that is sure carry over into the sequel, Pirates of the Carribean 2.
The DVD also contains deleted and extended scenes for those of you who really did enjoy this film. There is literally a ton of bonus features sure set to entertain after you've watched the main feature including how they were able to make the pirates teeth look rotten in the film.

Here's what I liked:
1.  Decent cinemetography and good choice of outdoor shooting locations.
2.  The actors seemed to be enjoying themselves.  No one took their performances too seriously.  None of that ""I can't believe I went to Julliard for this!"" subtext.
Here's what I did not like:
1.  Johnny Depp.  Yes, I know everyone has praised his performance.  For me, Johnny was merely adequate as the happy-go-lucky Jack Sparrow.  Over the top?  Certainly!  Brilliant, no.  There's no great skill to hamming it up.  In fact, he comes off as a bit mannered.
2.  Running jokes that sink like lead balloons.  How many times do we have to endure the same jokes over and over again about ""Jack Sparrow"" being the worst / best pirate ever?  Other jokes repeated so frequently that they lose any freshness they might have once had.
3.  Slow pacing.  It took over an hour of exposition to set up the primary conflict between Jack and the Pirates of the Carribean.  The movie totals over 2 hours.  You would think they could have picked up the pace and edited out some of the klunkier exposition.
4.  That annoying soundtrack.  Did the soundtrack sound familiar to you despite the tinny orchestra?  There's a reason why . . . They recycled most of it from music by Hans Zimmer for Gladiator.  Just check the credits . . .
5.  Cheesy special effects.  I know that George Lucas' Industrial Lights and Magic did the special effects for the movie.  Unfortunately, the CGI magic didn't quite work here.  I couldn't suspend disblief . . . everything looked very ""digital.""",1070409600,11,1763,4.651465798045603

The action is choreographed quite well and adds, doesn't distract, from the film. The fantasy is also a welcome addition as it blends reality with special effects rather seemlessly. The humor is genuine, timely and it doesn't feel forced.
I rarely give 5 stars and reserve it for best in genre. Of all the fantasy pirate-type movies I've seen, this is by far the best!!!",1070409600,,629,4.431034482758621
1496178,3,B00005JM5E,"Pirates of the Caribbean made every Disney executive fall out of their seats. It made every sceptic (including me) eat our pessimistic words. The trailers looked like another cut throat island waiting to happen. Well to say the least, 300 million dollars later, it was the surprise hit of the summer. I never saw it in theatres but caught it on DVD. Johnny Depp is certainly the star of the show, but to the credit of the entire production, he is not necessarily the only thread holding the show together. The main evil pirate is played with great ellegance and orlando bloom (type cast unfortunately) also does good at johnny's side. Gore verbinski brings back the thrills and serious adventure required to make a movie like this work. The action scenes involving the skeleton pirates are nothing short of exhilerating, always picking the movie up when it slows down. The only flaw found here is frankly the running time is almost rediculous. Such scenes as when johnny and the chick are stuck on the island, seem only to stretch the movie unecessarily. It seems that every character takes turns getting captured and seperated from the group. This could have been a tight 2 hour action movie, instead we are treated to scenes that are cutting room floor material. I hate to nit pick, I can sit through the longest of films, but not when I feel that the extra scenes bring nothing to the character dev or plot, they need to go. And we are treated to a very strange 2nd ending. Why didn't orlando confess his love on the boat at night after they beat the pirates? Why didn't captain jack swim away or stay on the island? It seems rather weak that all these things waited until they got back home so they could hang captain jack? It seems like their is a scene missing explaining why we got from point A straight to point C. These are minor things but ultimately it slows the movie down considerably.
I don't mean to put down the movie, it's a success in more ways than one. It's worth watching for the sheer fun of it all.  Verbinski has proven twice he can bring class to mainstream flicks with the Ring and now pirates. It's just a shame more wasn't done in the editing room to tighten it all up. Maybe the sequel can fix this. It's definetly worth seeing and buying if you don't mind the extraneous scenes.",1070409600,8,2308,4.521531100478469

We have all seen just how bad video games translate, so I figured this wouldn't be any different.  I was dead wrong.  I can rarely watch something with my kids that I actually LIKE as well.  This was an excellent movie with a great plot.  It was more ""fun"" than anything.  I wasn't moved to tears or made to think, but man did I have a good time.  So did my kids.

1496283,3,B00005JM5E,"Argh.
No pun intended, I'm sad to say.
I had expected so much from this film because it was hyped to the roof by so many critics and by people I knew, and it turned out to be juvenile, redundant, and a mere plodding from one scene/location to the next.
This film almost completely lacked momentum, characters were completely expendable or terribly undefined, the score was monotonous, and the entire movie was painfully unfunny.  I think I laughed twice, or chuckled, rather.
The problem is that the movie is rarely clever, and even Sparrow is only sporadically humorous.  Actually, he could have been really funny, except the scene direction, script, and his co-stars weighed him down.  For instance, when he's trying to distract the two guards during the commodore's promotion ceremony, the guards' lines were so obviously tailored for the folks at home (so we dolts can figure out what the Black Pearl is--how considerate), that Depp's very being near such dialogue was cringe-worthy for me.
And I ask you, how many times are we supposed to find it funny when someone gets clobbered in the head?  Or when an undead guy's eye falls out?  Or when the zombie monkey bares its fangs?  And why are we supposed to care about some nameless British navy guys while they're fighting with some undead guys, and with the utmost in confusing and erratic editing, besides?
The worthwhile aspects of this movie were wasted (such as Barbosa's motivation for wanting the curse lifted, i.e. his lackluster existence), and the expendable aspects (the two pirates in drag in the dingy) were stretched paper thin, and the movie grows wearisome about halfway through.
Further, couldn't the makeup artist have laid off the bright pink lipstick when doing Elizabeth's makeup?  And did she really need strategically placed highlights in her hair?  We're supposed to see her as independent, headstrong, and feisty, and yet the makeup department still has to doll her up most ridiculously.
Many people love or enjoy this movie.  Perhaps I'd like it better upon second viewing, and I'm going to watch it again to see if I can appreciate whatever I might have missed.  However, if I still find it dull, uninspired, and tedious, I will ""curse"" myself (argh) for wasting 2.5 hours when I should have known better.",1070323200,3,2286,4.898963730569948

1496290,5,B00005JM5E,"I admit I was a little skeptical when I was first considering whether to watch this movie, but watch it I did ... and was amazed!  This one easily ranks among the best movies I have ever seen, mainly because it blends a wide range of elements in a way that appeals to nearly every conceivable sector of the viewing public -- and does so without seeming strained or contrived.  Quite the opposite is true, in fact.  There is a smooth flow to the storyline and character development, although admittedly neither is especially deep.
The story centers on the quest of the cursed pirates of the ship ""The Black Pearl"" to recover a treasure that caused their curse.  They need to restore it to its resting place, accompanied by a blood sacrifice (the ""girl"" in the story) to lift the curse.  Meanwhile our hero, the pirate Jack Sparrow (um, that's ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow, if you please), wants both The Black Pearl and the treasure, but for his own reasons (not the least of which is revenge against the Pearl's crew for marooning him).  Against this basic backdrop, the story will lead the viewer on a merry chase around the Caribbean, with many great twists and turns along the way.
The film combines action, comedy (dare I say even a tiny dash of slapstick?), romance, history, suspense, and even some creepy supernatural stuff.  At the same time, it manages to leave out things like strong language, sexual content, or excessive violence and gore.  Although some of the scenes include some violence and blood, neither is likely to be objectionable to most viewers.  I felt perfectly comfortable letting my kids (ages 11 and 7) watch this with me -- in short, a family-friendly affair.
But of course, the best part of the movie was Johnny Depp in the lead role as Jack Sparrow.  This is absolutely a masterful performance, as Johnny plays this foppish rogue who is at once witty, charming, irksome, comical, and seemingly innocuous but in fact rather dangerous to those who cross him.  His speech is colorful and even a little flowery, but always with a slight slur that makes you wonder if he hasn't been lingering over the rum a little too long.  And Johnny Depp pulls off every bit of this role in a way that I think very few others could -- you can't help but love this character.
In short, this is a wildly entertaining movie for just about anyone who wants to be entertained.  It has something for everyone and is, in a word, just plain fun.  There's a good reason this one's a bestseller.  I urge you to find out for yourself.  I'll be adding this movie to my personal library very soon.",1070323200,,2591,4.6
1496291,4,B00005JM5E,"Gore Virbinski (Mouse Hunt, The Mexican, The Ring) has a wide pallet of directing styles but thanks to an original script and some great performances - coupled with incredible special effect - makes this film fantastic and extremely entertaining.
The film tells the humorous tale of a lost, but somewhat rumored Pirate whose reputation precedes him wherever he goes. The brilliant and hysterical performance of Johnny Depp (Chocolat, Edward Sissorhands, Don Juan De Marco) makes this movie a roller coaster of adventure, action and comedy.
Teaming up with partner Orlando Bloom (The Lord of the Rings, Blackhawk Down) on a mission to find the Black Pearl. ...P>The movie has a fast pace to it and a lot the entertainment is Johnny Depp on screen.

The Pirates Of The Caribbean ride at Disneyland has been a favorite of mine ever since my young childhood, so naturally I had to see the movie. I expected it to be a childs movie and was surprised by how it could be for children AND adults. This is Johnny Depp's greatest role. It made me fall in love with him. :P He is not the only great actor, Orlando Bloom and Kiera Nightly were also lovely.

1496373,5,B00005JM5E,"The Pirates of the Caribbean is one of those wonderful surprises that comes out of left field. It is a rare oddity--a big budget studio film that actually is able to balance style and content. The DVD set does much the same thing. While there is not as much substance in the extras, there is enough material to keep fans busy and it does keep with the look and mood of the movie.
The first DVD features not one but three audio commentaries. The first (and best) one is with director Gore Verbinski and actor Johnny Depp. This is a relaxed, conversational track as the two men joke around and hint at a very chaotic shoot with Verbinski admitting that he was hesitant to sign on to a film based on a Disney ride-would it have an actual story or just be a two-hour ad?
The second audio commentary is split between actors Jack Davenport and Keira Knightley and an interview with producer Jerry Bruckheimer. Their commentaries are for selected scenes, which cuts down on the dead air. The actors' track is filled with dry, self-deprecating humour but it feels like Knightley is trying too hard to be ""on"" and comes off as annoying. Bruckheimer's track is the epitome of business-like but is actually quite engaging because it is so informative.
Lastly, the film's screenwriters contribute a commentary. Subtitles that identified who was speaking at any given time would've been a nice option.
The second DVD contains a treasure trove of supplemental material. One of the highlights is ""An Epic at Sea,"" a 37-minute documentary on various elements that make up the movie, from casting to visual effects to the world premiere. While a bit on the fluffy side, it does convey the huge scope of the production and the challenges inherit with such an endeavour.
""Diaries"" is another stand-out extra that looks at the production from three different points of view. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer is an avid photographer who loves to take pictures on the sets of his movies and he talks rather eloquently over a montage of them. Actor Lee Arenberg, who played one of the cursed Black Pearl pirates, presents a fun snapshot of his experiences working on the film. Lastly, there is a so-so look at the life of the one real ship that was used in the film.
On a more educational note, is the surprisingly good ""Below Deck,"" a virtual reality tour of a pirate ship that allows one to click on various parts for informative factoids of the time period and aspects of pirate life by a historian.
There are many more extras to look through but these were the highlights for me. If you love the movie then you will love this DVD.",1070323200,4,2605,4.6529284164859

1496375,5,B00005JM5E,"After the huge flops of recent pirate movies, most notably the hugely underrated Roman Polanski's Pirates, and the actually awful 'made for the missus' Renny Harlin's Cutthroat Island, Disney did take a big gamble in making another one. But their gamble paid off handsomely, and this is due to the collective effort from all involved..
Gore Verbinksi with The Ring,The Mexican and Mousehunt to his name, manages to show a very impressive command of this epic (nearly two and a half hours),and give us a very solid and confident direction.
Jerry Bruckheimer is a veteran producer who knows a thing or two about the entertaining value of movies.
Ted Elliott and  Terry Rossio, succeed in writing a script that is loaded with humour, action and well developed characters, slightly cliched but thoroughly involving. And the humour is relentless, from the 'Evil Dead'-ish skeletons, to the pairing of Mackensie Crook and Lee Arenberg as two hapless pirates.
The cast made up of largely British actors, are wonderful, Johnny Depp one of the best American actors today, the great Geoffrey Rush, the smart and classically beautiful Keira Knightley, and of course the scion of British actors, and one of my all time favorites, Jonathan Pryce.
The editing contributed a lot to the success of the brilliantly choreographed action scenes.
The make up, costumes and locations were well researched and it is obvious that a lot of hard work has been done to achieve this.
In short, everyone working on this film contributed their talent and effort to make it the success that it turned out to be. A sequel with the same team is already announced for 2005!!!
So Pirates of the Carribean is a thrilling, entertaining and very funny movie,the like of which you rarely see these days..I was not bored and my concentration did not lapse even for a mere second! So fasten your seat belts and buy this movie now, for you will be taken on exciting ride, a much needed escapism full of romance,adventure and humour.",1070323200,5,1991,4.890532544378698

No one could ever could do a better job with that role.  Mr. Depp delivered an absolutely stunning performance that will for generations stand as one of the most memorable movie characters ever.  I've never underestimated Mr. Depp, but I was caught completely off guard opening day and left in awe that any actor could be that good, that real, that genuine.  If Mr. Depp does not win an Oscar, there simply is no justice on Earth.  Depp is astonishing every second he is on screen, which is most of the film.  Orlando Bloom's ""Will Turner"" is more or less just a comic foil for Captain Sparrow than anything else.  Turner is a pirate wannabe with a heart of gold.  Many could have played that part and I'm glad that Mr. Bloom got the chance to prove he could do more than just look cool in a white wig with a bow and arrow in the LOTR films.  Keira Knightly displays exceptional grace and emotional talent as the poor little rich girl.  Don't overlook the other standout performance from the great Geoffrey Rush, whose Barbossa character is the most stereotypical pirate of the bunch.  Barbossa is a more than worthy villain who relentlessly taunts all three heros.  Barobossa will give younger children many nightmares.  Tight script, flawless sets, authentic costumes, just right music and great location work add to the top notch quality.  The surprise ending at the conclusion of the credits was sheer genius.

I give it 5 stars because I personally like all elements of this movie.  It does have somewhat weak acting, and a pretty solid plot.  But Captain Jack Sparrow is enough for me to give it 5 stars alone.  If you don't like pirates don't see this movie.  If you don't like half drunk people, don't see this movie.  If you're looking for the best movie with the best plot, don't see this movie, because you will be disappointed and stupidly write a bad review about a great movie.  It's a movie for good times, not to be taken seriously.  Disney has produced another good title.  It's not aimed to please only adults, so if you're looking to rip on the childish elements of the movie, you'll find them.  So don't see it and shut up.
And to whoever is mad about this only being in wide screen edition, screw you.  You don't have to have a damn wide screen t.v. to enjoy widescreen movies.  I don't have a widescreen t.v. and I'm enjoying the picture just fine, not some hacked off, fill up the screen crap.",1070150400,3,1168,4.302752293577981

Probably 95% of the population does not have widescreen TV, and yet the studios continue to force widescreen DVD's on us. Bless the few studios that put both versions(one on each side).  I, for one, refuse to buy widescreen DVD's.  And I will not buy VHS...get it Disney?  I don't buy your movie.  I rent the VHS and make a copy...now I've got the MPAA mad, and you could so easily make everyone happy, and yourself millions more to boot.  Now for the movie...Depp is incredible in the swashbuckler role, being funny, cute, debonair, and just an incredible actor.  The movie will keep you entertained throughout, and isn't that why we like movies to begin with.

1496704,5,B00005JM5E,"Having never even heard of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, I had no preconceptions about the film.
I've always been a fan of Johnny Depp but, in this film, you can't take your eyes off him when he's on screen - and not just because of his outrageously campy affectations. A lesser actor would have failed totally and Jack Sparrow would have been just a cartoon character.
Both Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush seemed to be having great fun with their roles: Geoffrey Rush looked very much at home in his part of the wily and evil Capt'n Barbossa - the man must have salt water in his blood. As a result, the two ""straight parts"" of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley seemed a bit bland in comparison.
The action starts revving up right from the first few minutes and keeps growing. My only criticism is that the fight at the end was maybe a little too long, but that's only a small point. It's one of the few films I've gone to see two days in a row.
The special effects are great without overshadowing the story  and the whole film gives the long-neglected genre of pirate movies a good name once again.

Otherwise, great entertainment. Faithful to the pirate tradition, Depp almost immediately steals this film and clutches it to his heart until the final scene. Credit Rush with a formidable challenge to Depp's idiosyncratic performance. Having already stolen Jack Sparrow's ship (what else? The Black Pearl), his Captain Barbossa almost steals center stage as well. Almost. Director Gore Verbinski generally keeps the plot moving along. The special effects are outstanding. All members of the cast seem to be in perfect alignment with the whimsical tone. Credit Jonathan Pryce (Governor Swann) with keeping a straight face throughout all the nonsense. As with the Monty Python and Naked Gun films, it is imperative for everyone involved to sustain, indeed nourish a sense of gravitas. Of course the plot is highly contrived and relentlessly implausible. Of course there is a happy ending. Relax, suspend all presumption of rationality, and enjoy. We need much more such carefully crafted nonsense and should be grateful whenever we encounter it.",1069718400,31,1253,5.3979591836734695

I won't ruin the scene for those who haven't seen it yet, but it is easily one of the funniest moments on film in 2003.  The production value of this film is top-notch.  From the costuming to the music, to the fight-scene choreography, this film completely shines.  There is the obligatory ""love interest"" that is classic Disney.  You know the plot: the blacksmith's apprentice falls madly in love with the princess (or in this case, an unattainable rich-man's daughter).

1496710,5,B00005JM5E,"""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is one of the funniest action movies released.  Its unique theme keeps its audiences entertained the entire time.  Its plot was written wonderfully.  Its combination of comedy, romance, and action blend as one movie brilliantly.  Few other movies have mastered this difficult task.  The fights between the good pirates and the bad pirates never lose the action edge.  The romance theme adds more intensity to the action portions.  The characters' survival are more crutial due to the love.
Johnny Depp, especially, wonderfully offers his own humor into this movie.  His unforgettable behavior alone gives this movie the unforgettable comedy experience.  All the other actors also perform their roles wonderfully: Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, and Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush.  Their personalities heighten the movie's genre characteristics wonderfully.  Without them, this experience wouldn't be nearly as enjoyable.
The special effects look realistic.  The ships sailing, the gun shooting scenes, and many others could be easily mistaken for a real pirate war.  The characters' switch from human flesh to only skeleton never faulters.  No special effect is ever cheated, even the minor ones.
""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is highly enjoyable for those of all ages.  Those looking for unique action should watch this.  This will keep its audiences highly entertained the whole time.",1069459200,6,1467,5.424778761061947

1497033,5,B00005JM5E,"When I was a kid I liked pirate movies like Captain Blood, or the Crimson Pirate.  I haven't really seen many new entries in the genre, over the last 20 years.  I didn't think moviemakers could really bring back the sense of adventure, which I'd felt in those old films on cable.  Amazingly, I was wrong, this film has a lot to recommend it, even for today's discerning audience.
In past pirate classics, it seemed the hero either retired from piracy, or was secretly working for the king (The Kings Pirate movie comes to mind.).  In this picture we have a committed pirate, (played by Johnny Depp) with no apologies, or promises to reform.  He basically steals the picture from Orlando Bloom, with his over the top, flamboyant badness.
The story itself is an epic tale of a quest, a journey to lift a truly nasty curse on the pirates.  Special effects are extraordinary, and help drive the plot rather than detract from it.  The movie is long, and somewhat episodic, but the acting, and action sequences hold your attention throughout.  I understand they actually built two, full-scale, ships for this movie.  I can believe it, because the filmed shots of the deck fights, shipboard action, looked realistic. The movie had many unusual camera angles, more so than I'm used to seeing in these kinds of films.
The movie evokes images of Treasure Island, legendary ghost ships, and epic treasure hunts.  You have your pirate's cove, desert islands, cannon fights, raids, and romance.  The movie's beginning is designed to show us, that there is an obvious, but forbidden attraction in some of us, to the life of a pirate.  A kind of feeling, which brings a certain romanticized longing, for the freedom found, in that bold kind of profession.  Depp's performance adds just that much more credence, to this kind of emotion.",1068854400,5,1820,4.794871794871795

Most of the laughing was at Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, who I now believe is in the top three of talented actors. He was also good in older movies like Chocolat and Edward Scissorhands, and he is almost that good in this movie. The plot may be lengthy and elaborate at times, but if you like pirate movies, laughter, heck, if you like movies, this is a must-see. It made a lot of money in 2003 for good reason.",1068768000,,614,4.211864406779661

(A movie which should be released on DVD by the way)  And so I went to see Pirates of the Caribbean with expectations of a story that would be very entertaining, to say the least.  What I got was more than I could have ever expected and with every thought I have of this movie an incredible thrill comes over me that is hard to describe.  It brings back all of the fantasy and wonder that filled my imagination when I was young and commanded my sense of adventure so that I felt like I was along for the ride.  I was completely enraptured with this movie and with the amazing performance of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow.  His talent has always been undeniable, but now I feel as though he is unforgettable.

1497039,5,B00005JM5E,"This film is truly a piece of cinematic gold.  From Johnny Depp's flawless portrail of Captain Jack Sparrow, (who is quite possibly the greatest Disney character ever created), to that of the newest hot faces to find Hollywood, those of Orlando Bloom & Kiera Knightley, Pirates has something for everyone.
The story is that of young Elizabeth Turner, (Knightley) the stunning daughter of Port Royal's Governor, and her run in with the crew of the Black Pearl, a hoard of treasure-seeking pirates.  With help from the local blacksmith (Bloom) and the bumbling former-captain of the Black Pearl, Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp), the three must put to end to the curse haunting the crew of Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and reclaim the Pearl for Cap'n Jack.
Definately an experience not to be avoided, despite the film being based on, of all things, an amusement park ride.  Clearly the crowd favorite, Captain Jack always knows what he's doing, despite outward appearances.  As a media critic, I highly suggest this film for anyone looking for action, romance, humor, and if nothing else, some of the prettiest faces ever to hit the big screen.",1068595200,9,1141,4.989473684210527

It's just a wild ride. The whole overall feel of the movie is so... refreshing. Just the swashbucking, scurvy mates, ahoy... that hasn't been done in so long. The sword fights are great, the moonlight effects are excellent, plus bonus points for having a demon monkey. I really liked Keira Knightly, whose scenes on the island with Johhny Depp are just so fun. Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush do well with their parts, but the movie is really stolen by Johnny Depp. His amazingly hilarious Jack Sparrow is an example of great acting. He created a whole little world with his character, with his pronunciation, and his wacky hand motions.
Don't miss out on this amazing film!",1068595200,4,833,4.597315436241611

I went since my daughter is a fan of Orlando Bloom & he is not hard on the eyes for me either. The movie, itself, was very entertaining. Johnny Depp was hilarious & I am not a huge fan of his, since his films are so inconsitent, in my mind. My only complaint would be the soundtrack @ times overwhelmed but in home you can always turn it down. My other complaint is that @ times there was too much going on on screen. It could have used more close-up then cut to action (like LOTR) as in fight scenes but that was minimal. I took my 4 yr old to see it, telling her 1st that it might get scary but she was scared for only a second. Wait after credits!",1068595200,2,762,3.829113924050633

1497163,4,B00005JM5E,"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl

Elizabeth Swan: You were marooned on a desert island for three days and all you did was lie on the beach and drink rum?
Pirate Jack Sparrow: Welcome to the Caribbean!
The newest trend in movie making being sputtered out by the Hollywood dream machine involves Disney. Go figure. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl will shortly be followed by the release of Haunted Mansion, thus putting into motion this ""grabbing at strawsEinitiative of turning Disneyland/world/EMPIRE theme rides into blockbuster movies. Inhibit your gag reflexes at the thought of Michael Eisner rolling around naked in a sea of his own greenback for a second. Pirates is actually a really good time and one that you might not shelling out for again and again, damn him!
On a Summer Movie Scale of 1 to 10, Pirates of the Caribbean pirates a 9. Three factors have led me to make this declaration. First, yaEgotta have excitement and Pirates delivers with swashbuckling verve. Second, the visuals and dialogue contain references that might even make your 85-year-old grandmother chuckle. Third: the presence of Johnny Depp, possibly the most talented, expressive movie actor working today. How can you not love the man who based his character on Keith Richards? (There is an obvious fourth reason that you'd probably mention first if you were a 10 to 80-year-old girl. His name is Orlando Bloom and he's our token hot sun-kissed boy).
Depp is pirate Jack Sparrow, formerly captain of the ill-famed monster ship the Black Pearl. After being ousted from power by a gang of mutant mutineers led by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Sparrow escapes from his island exile to Port Royal in the hopes of ""commandeeringEa new vessel. Not much later, the aforementioned mutineers attack Port Royal. Their objective is to find the last piece to a puzzle that would liberate them from a vile curse (a curse which makes them flesh by day and rotted corpses by moonlight). Who possesses this puzzle piece? None other than gorgeous Port Royal citizen Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) and the hot patootie she stole it from, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). Long story much shorter: she is kidnapped, he enlists Sparrow's help to rescue her and the rest is Yo ho yo ho, a pirate's fight for three.
This pirate flick is fun for everyone. Even film academicians and intellectuals will have a good time despite themselves. Other than drinking my own bottle of rum on a sun-soaked Caribbean beach, I can't imagine a greater escape from reality. So, hoist the main sail and scuttle the jib, pack in the rum and follow the smell of treasure: we're huntinEpeg leg!

1497164,5,B00005JM5E,"This is going to be a short review: I love this movie because of the intriguing story...and Johnny Depp.  He completely shines in this movie.  Orlando Bloom did a very good job too.  This movie has so many nuances in it that leave you chuckling long after the movie is over.  The action scenes are exciting, expecially the final sword fight, the special effects are convincing, and the music is awesome!!!
Pirates is such a fun movie, with many fun scenes and Very sexy characters.  I was kind of surprised by the violence, though, it being a Disney movie and all, but one thing I've noticed is that people of EVERY age group above 7 or so enjoyed this movie.  There's something about it that makes people watch it again and again.  The Lion King is the best Disney animated movie, and PoC is the best non-animated Disney movie.  Get the PoC soundtrack, the music is great.  And get this DVD!!!  Of course you want to make sure you have a big screen TV first, because it would be a shame to watch this action-packed movie on a small screen.",1068422400,7,1040,4.426315789473684
1497165,5,B00005JM5E,"Now this film I really love. The story is superb, even though I had not expected it from a film adaptation of a theme-park ride. The special effects are amazing, the acting is fabulous, an overall thrill ride which takes you back to all the films you grew up with, repeated again and again. This is a pirate film with a twist, but still quite reminiscent of the Errol Flynn movies.
The two stand-out performances of this film are undoubtedly Johny Depp, who has made it a career of selecting roles for himself which are not only very suitable, but in which he shines and steals the show. This time, however, he has heavy competition in that department. Orlando Bloom, known for his role as Legolas in the Lord of the Ring movies, dazzles the movie-goer with his acting capabilities, looks and fighting skills. It seems a romantic hero is born in this movie...lets hope Mr. Bloom can keep shining and outperforming his co-stars.
The verdict? The only reason I wouldn't give this movie 5 stars is that I have seen a few better movies, in terms of story and other things. However, it is certainly one of the best movies I have seen this year! And well, as you can oly give full stars on Amazon, I'll give it all five...as I did truly love it...",1068336000,89,1241,4.47136563876652

I saw this in theaters 6 times because it was so good and I have been anxiously awaiting the DVD.  People say women like this movie because of Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom, and I say true, but I love their performance, not their looks (Although they are both attractive gentlemen).  Johnny is at his comedic finest and you will not stop laughing and Orlando makes you root for the good guy even harder then normal and laugh at his comments that compliment Johnny's ""uniqueness"".  Geoffery Rush is phenomenal and so is the actor (I am blanking on his name, sorry sir, you were still awesome) who plays Commodore Norrington (he needs way more publicity, he was phenomenal as well)...
This is by far the best movie of the year and without a doubt deserves awards for both content and actor performance.  Knowing the Oscars, it will get overlooked, not enough ""big names"" in some over the top boring movie, so my vote goes to them by buying the DVD and encouraging others to buy it as well.  Nothing says ""In your face"" to those who keep getting reconized for less then deserving work then getting surpassed in sales by ""box office poison"" Johnny Depp and his 'mates.",1068336000,285,1281,4.472103004291846

  Orlando Bloom was basicly stuck with the  ""pretty boy"" role,but he was great and he made the most of his few funny lines.
Keira Knightly.....................................I know all the girls went to see the movie for Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp,but i went for Keira Knightly..............................Anyway. Geoffery Rush was great at his role. Everybody should see this movie. My ONLY complaint(and its very small)is that the end was a bit too perfect.

I loved him as Jack Sparrow. It's funny Disney almost gave him the axe for the way he portrayed the Captin, but  mostly it's his preformance that everybody loves. You got the felling her was one of thoes people who were so smart it makes them crazy. That and he's been living in his own little world far to long.  He was just so funny and hot. 2. Orlando Bloom. Hot. British. Need I say more. 3. The monkey wasn't he cute. 3. Dead pirates hey they were funny. 4. Keira Knightley she rocked. you just know she gonna be a star. 5. Action this move had action, so you didn't mind your butt going numb so much. 6. Jonny and Orlando yummy twice. 8. Orlando and Jonny hubba hubba.

I didn't keep my hopes up because I figured that the movie wouldn't be really good. I mean, Disney was so desperate for an idea that they used a theme park ride for inspiration. It might not be worthwhile, right? WRONG! I loved the movie. It begins with a 12-year old Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and a governor's daughter named Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) when they first met out at sea. Elizabeth notices that Will is wearing a pirates Aztec gold piece around his neck and takes it so that no one accuses him of being a pirate. Then time takes them to the present (at least for them it is). A hilariously funny pirate by the name of Captain Jack Sparrow comes to their town and stirs up some trouble. When the cursed pirates of the Black Pearl arrive for that Aztec gold the adventure begins. I don't want to give away the whole story so I'll stop there. Anyway, I guess you could say that it's a typical unanimated (is that a word?) Disney movie. But don't let that stop you.

Yes, Orlando was a bit cheesy as the blacksmith desperately in love with Keira Knightly but all in all the movie was highly entertaining. Seriously, it doesn't matter who you are, you will enjoy this movie (unless you are a bitter old man in which case you probably don't like anything.)

Along with Geoffrey Rush and Keira Knightley of course. The whole cast of this movie was WONDERFUL. So wonderful, in fact, i went back to see it 4 more times. This movie is a PERFECT blend of action, drama, comedy, and romance. I was constantly laughing at the amazing character that Johnny Depp put together, and at the same time swooning at the beauty and bravosity of Orlando Bloom. Though the DVD is not out yet, i anticipate its coming and know it will not disappoint me. What more could a john and orlando lover WANT with BLOOPERS, and DELETED SCENES to see more of the men i so openly desire.
  In this movie, I thought keira knightley did an exellent job as elizabeth. At first i was soo green with envy that she got to KISS orlando and dance drunkedly around a fire with johnny, but she was so good at playing the governors daughter who isn't your ordinary damsel in distress -- i had to admire her. It is her idea to go back and save the man that she truly loves from the undead pirates of the caribbean. She was an exellent addition to this film.
  I also think geoffrey rush was the IDEAL man for the part of captain barbossa. He was so good at bringing out the essential evilness of the pirate that even hell couldn't handle. He as well brought a fair share of comedy to the movie, and i really enjoyed the swordfight between him and johnny depp.
I would recommend this movie to ANYONE without a second thought. Its a wonderful piece of art that deserves many, many awards. I hope everyone that gets this DVD is as pleased and as overjoyed as i will be.

Johnny Depp does a stunning performance, as well as hilarious and a little eccentric, all in all charming.  Orlando of course is as hot as ever, more so tho, with his sweet gentle love for Elizabeth who is also gives us a great performance as a daring adventure-longing girl who gets caught up in the middle of a ghostly galleon story.
  Chilling, hilarious, exciting, and one of the best soundtracks ever, this movie is absolutely a MUST-HAVE for any pirate, adventure, or good-lookin' actor fan.  :)",1067558400,4,704,4.833333333333333

Anyone who has ever ridden the Pirates of the Carribean at Disney World will be thrilled to see the  ride come to life and to be part of the story.  And the story is fantastic. Johnny Depp gives the performance of a  lifetime as Captain Jack Sparrow.  He is sooooo hot!,1067558400,2,304,4.172413793103448
1497484,5,B00005JM5E,"Who new a Disney movie about pirates could be so fun to watch?  PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN has been an enormous hit, scoring many fans and earning great money in theatres and now it is on DVD.  The movie stars Johnny Depp (from ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO), Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightley, and Geoffrey Rush.  The movie is about pirates, the sea, and adventure.  Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow, a weird, rougish, and sometimes hilarious pirate.  He is at a run-in against the law (the British government) and has a penalty of death by hanging for his small and unimportant, but many crimes.  The governor's daughter Elaine Marley (played by the beautiful Kiera Knightley whos starred in BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM) has the Black Pearl, an artifact that everyone in the movie seems to want.  She got it when she was a child, and when they found Guybrush Threepwood, the man Elaine loves (played by Orlando Bloom from LORD OF THE RINGS).  When Elaine gets kidnapped by immortal pirates, led by Captain LeChuck (Geoffrey Rush).  Sparrow convinces Threepwood to go and rescue the girl, and the adventures follows.
The movie is fun to watch with pretty cool action sequences, and excitement as well.  Depp makes a spectacular performance as Captain Sparrow, and adds a flavor to the film that just wouldn't be good without him.  Sparrow is a hilarious character and makes the movie very funny at times.  It is a truly ""fun flick"" that is just awesome to watch.  The movie was directed by Gore Verbinski who also directed THE RING, another one of my favorite movies.  With the help of the writers of SHREK, you can see how the movie became sucessful.  A great family film (though it is PG-13) and certaintly one of the better movies.  Go watch it!",1067558400,3,1733,4.66996699669967
1497485,5,B00005JM5E,"I couldn't think of a better way to introduce Pirtates to the 21st century. Walt Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is that movie and is a must see for everyone of all ages.
Pirates tells the story of the Captian Jack Sparrow(Depp). A witty and charming pirate captian that wants to get his ship back from his mutinous first mate Barbados(Irons). Jack along with everybody else knows the ship is cursed, but itsn't sure what the curse is. Barbados knows why they are cursed and knows how to stop it. Elizabeth Smart(Keira Knightly) has a piece of aztec gold. The gold is cursed and the gold calls to the pirates of the black pearl. Elizabeth is captured and Will Turner(Orlando Bloom) gets Jack Sparrow to help him go after the Pearl so he can get her back and win her heart.
That's the basic storyline to the movie. It's a fun story and makes a lot more sense if it's viewed by you.
Johnny Depp is fantastic in the movie. It's probaly his best performance of all-time. I'd love to see him get an Oscar nod for his work. He is absolutely funny. He really does steal the show in the movie. You have to see it just for his performance.
Orlando Bloom is great. A lot of people have knocked him saying he should have done a better job, and I just can't see those people's points. He plays the young heart throb action hero great. I can remember seeing lines of girls drooling over him. He is great and I hope to see him in more stuff besides this and Lord of the Rings.
Keria Knightly is great in her sopomore movie. She was Jewels in Bend it Like Beckham and she's even better in Pirates. She is gorgeous. She does a good job playing the heroin. I love her accent and she plays a good character.
The special effects are outstanding. Idustrial Light & Magic is the best special effects team in the world and this movie shows why. When you see the pirates in action when the curse is active they are great. It's some of the best effects of the year. You could watch the movie for the CGI and for the Ships. They have real ships and sails on real water. It's great to see it because it puts authenticity to the moive.
It's a fantastic movie. It's a lot more than you'd expect from a movie that's based on an amusement park ride. Jerry Bruckheimer has produced another hit and I've heard there will be two sequels to this. You have to see it.
I think this is the best movie of the year so far. I like it better than the Matrix and Finding Nemo. It's a must see. Don't miss out on it. It has everything that a great movie has and I know you will enjoy it.",1067472000,4,2576,4.227180527383367

1497489,4,B00005JM5E,"Haven't thought of pirates movie would be able make it back again in the modern days, especially when we are talking about we are in the age of Si-fi and fantasy movies that rely heaps on state-of-the-arts computer special effects. Nontheless Pirates of the Caribbean made a good return of the genre to the audience.
Frankly, judging from the dodgy and lengthy title, there was not much hope about it being either entertaining or creative. However, with Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush and Orlando Bloom as the leading cast, the attraction of the movie rocketed immediately. Johnny Depp, playing the weird ex-pirate head who got dumped on an isolated island in the middle of nowhere provided a lot of essential credits to the movie. His performance is stunning and spectacular and managed to turn this old jerk into a half-weighted hero. His gestures and all the small movements he created for the character did add a lot of spice to make the character jump out of the script. Johnny Depp once again proved that he could transform any roles into a real character that could last in people's mind.
Geoffrey Rush as the cursed power and wealth hungry pirate provided a lot of dynamics to the movie, especially when he was working with Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley. The whole movement of the story just came in and pushed the plot forward. Although working will strong actors like Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush, the two young cast members Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley were not worse off in performance. They showed great integrity in their characters and were able to match with their strong counterparts perfectly. Orlando Bloom still needs time to shake his Legolas image off, but everything needs to have a start and it seems that this is a good start for him. Keira Knightley showed huge difference when compared to her role in Bend it Like Beckam. Both of them should have good chance in the acting career should they be able to choose their roles carefully in the future.
The special effects of the movie concentrated on the transformation of the cursed sailor crew at different occasions and they were well done. It provides a creepy feeling in certain scenes and at other scenes created a haunting effect for the audience.
The story itself is a bit simple but in all is a very entertainment movie for just sit back and relax.",1067299200,,2333,4.762962962962963

Don't get me wrong, as much as I LOVE Disney and the nostalgia that goes with it, a Disney Pirate movie...? I mean come on, right? I've never been more wrong. Pirates of the Carribean is the best movie I've seen in a LONG time. I was dissapointed with matrix 2, xmen 2, etc and this was the show stopper of the summer, I was shocked! I can't WAIT for this to come out, I am not even pre-ordering because I plan to be at the store asap the morning this goes to DVD! Get this, I swear you won't be dissapointed!",1067212800,,625,4.008

I think it's the only time I've ever heard a pirate on-screen actually say, ""Arrr!"" without it sounding trite or cliche.  You definitely get the sense that the cast enjoyed making this film, and put a great deal of effort into their work.  Absolutely CANNOT wait to hold the DVD in my hands!!  Avast!

If you have not yet discovered Johnny Depp (shame on you!) this is the place to meet him. Not only is this movie interesting on the swashbuckler movie level, its also a slight parody of those perfect heroes and heroines we watched so long ago. Keira Knightly (of Bend It Like Beckham fame) and Orlando Bloom (Legolas in The Lord of the Rings trilogy) are the romantic heroes, and Johnny Depp is the drunken pirate who has to save their butts. There's laughs and thrills for everyone, little kids to senior citizens, and by the end of it you'll be wondering, ""But WHY's the rum gone?""",1067126400,2,732,4.511278195488722

I can't count how many times his character alone had me laughing.  And sorry, but even with the grungy beard and all, he was still hot!  Orlando Bloom was endearing as Will.  He was such a sweetheart.  A sweetheart with a very impressive sword arm but a sweetheart nonetheless.  Those two pieces of ""eye candy"" would have been enough for me to give the movie at least a 3 and 1/2 star rating.  Keira Knightley was great, too.  This was the first time I had heard of this young actress and was impressed with what I saw.
I was going to take my two oldest children, ages 8 and 6, to see this film but decided against it at the last minute because I thought that the scenes of the ""ghostly crew"" would be too scary for them.  I now wish I would've taken them because although the special effects were dynamic - I don't think any of the scenes shown would have kept the kiddies awake at night, clutching the bedsheets, while waiting for the ""scary pirate monsters"" to jump out of the closet. : P

It is a lacework of entertwined patterns that give the films a rich dynamism and imaginary broad perspective. Romeo and Juliet : Elizabeth and Bill, the daughter of the Governor and the son of a pirate turned blacksmith. And it succeeds because the Commodore gives way and yields in front of real love. The phantom pirate ship and the phantom pirate crew, the Flying Hollander demultiplied. And the curse is lifted giving victory to the rejected pirate captain and to the commodore. The South American treasure lost on some island, in some dark cave, and that is a curse for the pirates but can also be the treasure chest of all those who will survive the curse and there is only one. Perfect resolution of the dilemma : be cursed and be immortal, or lift the curse and die. Brilliant colors and costumes. Brilliant action full of humor. If you manage to follow all the allusions you will be laughing your backside off. Really great.

1497807,2,B00005JM5E,"I saw the movie in the hoopla of all the hype, when most people I knew were proclaiming this one of the summer's best films. Not unexpectedly, I walked into this one with high expectations, hoping for perhaps another Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade or even The Mummy (I'd never seen the other Indy flicks in theaters). Walking out of the theater a very long two-and-a-half hours later (actually, more like 2 hours 50 minutes, given the previews and the final scene after the credits) (this movie has way too many double crosses and false climaxes), I'm not even sure if this is better than The Mummy Returns.
Based off an amusement park theme ride, a lack of solid plot isn't a surprise. Orlando Bloom stars as Will Turner, a dashing blacksmith who's in madly in love with the beautiful Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley, a Natalie Portman look-a-like, except she's much prettier and appears to be a better actress). But when she's kidnapped by a group of ghostly pirates (led by Geoffrey Rush), Turner enlists the help of pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who appears a few cards short of a complete deck. Dark secrets are unearthed and it is revealed the undead pirates need to make a blood sacrifice to become human again.
It's not that Pirates' premise doesn't hold any potential, the movie does, after all, give us the prospect of an oceanbound adventure, the kind of movies you don't see too often. But Indiana Jones on water, this is not, for it lacks all of that trilogy's infectious sense of fun and thrilling ventures into the unknown (not to mention the smart dialogue and rousing John Williams' score). If not for Johnny Depp's performance and Keira Knightley's beauty and strong screen presence, Pirates might very well have lulled me into sleep.
The movie's biggest problem is its generic action sequences. Most of the swordfights are routine, directed without much flair or energy, and their bloodless presentation is just too juvenile-oriented for me. In fact, they all start to look the same after a while, so a little variety would have been appreciated. The film's one semi-creative fight, between Turner and Sparrow, is ineffective since you realize neither are in danger, and the climactic battle, pitting dozens of the undead pirates against the living, doesn't work since the fighting is done by characters I didn't give a damn about.
I like the actual concept of fighting undead pirates, but most of the villains are so goofy (especially the one keeps that fake eye), it's hard to see them as an actual menace. And when they are played for laughs, they're not very funny, either (how many times can we see an eye pop out before it stops being funny?). Also, making them former mates of Sparrow's sort of demystifies them (as if their goofy behavior didn't do so already).  Because Sparrow knows all the men, it makes their backstories less intriguing and mysterious.
As a pure adventure, Pirates is fraught with a lot of problems. It's repetitive, the characters keep going back and forth between the same islands and boats, sneaking in and out. The most successful adventures usually get the charaters going from A to B to C, rather than A to C, then B, and then back to C, then B, and then back to C (and in this case, even back to A!). I got sick of seeing that island cavern over and over in ten minutes.
But Pirates is not without merit. Its singular savior is Johnny Depp, whose introductory scene is so hilarious, I was afraid I'd choke on my laughter. Sure, some of his scenes don't work so well (like when he tries to get those two guards to distract themselves), but he's more often a blast to watch than not, and most of the scenes he's in are pretty enjoyable. I also liked Keira Knightley (almost easily the movie's best piece of eye candy when you compare her good looks with some of the goofy visual effects), who displays genuine fire and feistiness even when she's mostly played as a damsel in distress. Both performers make the best of their parts, elevating the material quite significantly (if Depp and Knightley weren't present, the movie would have gone from middling to bad in a heartbeat).
Klaus Badelt's score sounds almost exactly like Hans Zimmer's work in The Rock given a period flavor. It's distracting, I spent too much time wondering in what ways Badelt would rip-off scores from Jerry Bruckheimer films. But at least it gave me an excuse to pay attention to something in-between the scenes featuring Depp and Knightley.

1497809,5,B00005JM5E,"I held off writing this review for a long time, since I knew so many other people would leap at the chance to praise ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" up one side and down the other. It's not that the film doesn't deserve praise -- it does. It's the best swashbuckler to come out in fifty years. I saw it four times in the cinema, which for someone who has to drive sixty miles one-way to reach a theatre, is second only to my ""Lord of the Rings"" trips. The movie satisfies on a lot of levels. It has humor, romance, horror, and comedy. There's also a very unique, intelligent scriptwriter at work behind the scenes. The dialogue is (almost) all first-rate, though a couple of recent terms were thrown in for comical purposes. As a connoisseur of period films, I can tell you the historical accurately is fairly first-rate (with the minor exception of blush-worthy plot mistakes such as having Port Royal situated on the cliffs).
The cinematography on this film is what makes it outstanding. Whether it's Elizabeth Swann preparing to faint from a too-tight-corset on a parapet, or the tattered Black Pearl sailing in the moonlight, there's always something wondrous to gaze at on the screen. One fantastic underwater shot peruses a school of hammerheads as they drift endlessly through an underwater cove of sunken, ghostly ships. The introductory scene is also stunning, one of the most spell-casting experiences I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing. The Interceptor creeping through a mist-shrouded sea, the umbrella floating by, the magnificent horror of seeing a burning merchant ship, and our first glimpse of the Black Pearl as it sails into the fog. This scene alone makes the movie ticket price well worth it... and that's only the first four minutes.
As many profession and personal critics have observed, the film belongs to Johnny Depp's memorable performance as ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow, the single pirate able to elude the curse thanks to his crew mutinying before the gold could be spent. But the other performers shouldn't be overlooked in his hilariously likable wake. In the role of a very strong, independent heroine, Kiera Knightley manages to be both beautiful and spirited without escaping into clich. Orlando Bloom is more likable here than as the aloof Legolas he's become so well known for; with some excellent action scenes, he shows his unique skill with a blade as well as has the opportunity to carry off a romantic lead with a keen flair. Geoffrey Rush is at his best; being a fan of his endeavors, it was a pleasure to watch him on screen in a very different, very misunderstood role. He manages to make Barbossa both fascinating, horrible, and yet have a shred of sorrow at the end for his passing. Two extremely underrated actors, Britain's Jack Davenport and Jonathan Pryce, are given the respective roles of Commodore Norrington, Elizabeth's unfortunate fiance, and her governor father.
For once, scriptwriters haven't copped out and given us an easy decision. While being slightly arrogant and something of an egotist, Norrington is also extremely likable, a perfect gentleman, and one might even go so far as to say, the most noble character by the closing credits. Davenport plays him with just the right amount of lethargic enthusiasm and irritation; his scenes with Depp, always wrought with blatant humor, are some of the film's finest moments. Pryce doesn't have a lot to work with, but the audience cannot help but chuckle over some of his humorous traits, such as fighting a skeletal hand for his magnanimous wig. The music is also first-rate, very mood-setting with a certain sense of dramatic tension even in romantic scenes. The film is well worth a PG13 rating, but is never inappropriate for younger audiences. The mild innuendo will go over children's heads (and most parents as well, for that matter -- only literature history-lovers will pick up some of the sly historical jests), the violence is all quite bloodless, and there's virtually no profanity. The pirates are properly frightening and in various stages of decay, extremely cool from a CGI perspective.
A movie well worth its praise, and one you simply MUST own on DVD for all its subtleties.",1066003200,7,4197,4.929378531073446

Johnny Depp's performance as Jack Sparrow is flawless.  The acting level is remarkable, the set is magical.  Adventures with pirates could have never been more exciting than swinging with Johnny across masts and dashing through thrilling scenery with this gorgeous captain.  Heart goes racing from his first appearance on the screen.  You won't be able to see ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" only once.  Anyone would be mad to miss a voyage with The Black Pearl.

1497811,5,B00005JM5E,"This movie is a Great movie....... One of the best movies I've seen in a long time! Its about a Pirate Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) Barboosa (Geoffrey Rush)The movie starts out showing Elizibeth Swan and Will Turner as younge chrildren then is shows them as adults, and Elizebth falls off a balcony and Jack sparrows come to the rescue, but they find out he is a pirate and are going to hang him, so he exscapes but is captured again and put in prison. And the Pirates come in on there ship The Black Pearl, and Kiddnap Elizabeth thinking she is the daugther of Capt Bootstraps Turner, they kidnaped her b/c the need the blood of a Turner to cure the curse put upon them.... A curse that in the moonlight They turn to skelatons. But Will Turner sees them take her and frees Jack Sparrows from the prison without permission of the guards and makes a deal w/ him to lead him to the Black Pearl. They finally reach the Black Pearl And The Pirates find out that Elizabeth is not a Turner, so Will Turner makes a deal w/ the Pirates that he lets go Elizabeth and Jack and he will not shoot himself (Knowing They need his blood and if he is killed the curse will remain forever W/ there not being another Turner) So they free Jack and Elizabeth on a deserted Island. Jack and Elizabeth are rescued. And they go after Will. They find him and then Jack reveals a secret.... (That the curse is on him too.) So the Pirates nor Jack Sparrows can be killed, then there is a fight seen and Will cuts himself and puts his blood on a coin and so the curse is broken and Barboosa is killed. Then they return home and Capt. Jack Sparrows is to be hung... Do you think he can get out of this one? Well you'll just have to see the movie and find out.... All in all this is a great movie. You must see it, I thought it was going to be a stuped movie and didn't want to see it except every one kept telling be it was a good movie, so I seen it and now it is one of my favorite movies! :)",1065916800,,2031,4.157360406091371

1497813,5,B00005JM5E,"I too was disturbed that Will ""killed"" his own father by ending the curse, but aside from that little flaw, the movies WAS fantastic and Johnny Depp should win an Oscar nomination at least.  The special effects were perfect and the rest of the performances were outstanding too.  I loved the performance of the two British soldiers who did a great homage to Laurel and Hardy!

1497814,4,B00005JM5E,"I never expected this movie to make my all time list of good action movies, but it had. Johnny Depp, who excels at playing oddball characters, really took ahold of Captain Jack Sparrow. Sexy, yet clever, driven, but with heart, Depp took what could have been a very boring lead and made it into a stellar performance.
Orlando Bloom was also equally likable but he has some quirks in his charater. He didn't have much depth and his best scenes involve swordplay. Miss Kingsley played her part well though she also lacked character depth. All in all, the movie was great. The first action sequence when the Black Pearl enters the harbor blew me away. I think this film went above the action genre.
Geoffery Rush and the other pirates added humor but also kept the movie slightly dark. I expected some cheesy acting and even cheesier graphics, but Disney hit a gold mine with Pirates of the Caribbean, I think everyone was a little shocked at how the movie turned out, and it turned out to be awesome.",1065657600,2,998,4.581005586592179

However, it seems I had nothing to fear. The film opens simply with it's title, no Disney fanfare beforehand, and gets right into the storytelling.
What a story it is. I won't go into detail (you'll have to see the movie yourself.) Suffice to say that it left this 29 year old quite entertained and engaged throughout its' two-hour plus run.
Johnny Depp was amazing. His ""Keith Richards-inspired"" Captain Jack was intriguing on many levels. Keira Knightly was stunning throughout the movie. I guess they had makeup and hair people on deserted islands back then...
Geoffery Rush was excellent as the villianous Captain Barbossa. We've all seen too many one-dimensional ""bad-guys"" in movies, and it was nice to have a fully-realized character for a change.
The supporting cast were all great, especially the two BritCom vets, Jack Davenport, aka Commodore Norrington (""Coupling""), and MacKenzie Crook of ""The Office"" fame who played a very strange pirate with a glass eye.
Overall a great summertime movie that quite honestly the whole family can enjoy.",1065484800,7,1284,4.949074074074074
1497896,5,B00005JM5E,"This movie is full of great scenes, great laughs, and very great acting.  I agree with everyone who says Johnny deserves an Oscar, he has set the bar so high that most actors can't even see it.  I am not sure that the Academy can be shaken loose from its stagnant state, but if anyone can do it, it is a character by the name of Captain Jack Sparrow.
Geoffrey Rush's performance was also remarkable just for the fact that you also notice it, even when Johnny is stealing scenes.  Somehow he managed to be evil and cartoonish at the same time, and there was something very ""Disney"" about his character.
PoTC supposedly has a scene that pays homage to the movie ""Groundhog Day"", but after many viewings, I have not figured that one out yet.  But I've enjoyed trying - it has given me more opportunties to see a greatly entertaining movie.
Congratulations Disney, PoTC is already a modern classic.

1497901,5,B00005JM5E,"Yes, most girls out there originally intended to see this movie because Orlando Bloom is in it. I adored this movie and I will be the first to say that yes, Johnny Depp completely stole the movie. He had all the laughs, he had the best character and he's all around an amazing actor and in my opinion, he deserves an Oscar for his role. The first scene in this movie is my least favorite, I don't like the girl who plays little Elizabeth, I just...I didn't like that scene. The special effects are amazing, yada yada yada. GO SEE THIS MOVIE NOW.
On the subject of Orlando Bloom, I think it is a bit extreme to say that he brought none of his acting abilities to the movie and that he could have ruined this and that but oh, oh it was Johnny Depp who saved him. Is Johnny a better actor than Orlando? Yes. Easily. But here's my argument on the behalf of Orlando. He is playing the straight man (generally the less glorified role) next to Johnny Depp's comic genius. Johnny is a seasoned actor, he's been doing this for years, and Captain Jack Sparrow is by far the more interesting character. Personally, I think part of the problem was the script...I mean, most of it was great, but I think when they wrote Will's lines, they...made it too sappy, cheesy, whatever. You can't blame Orlando for that. But also, Orlando is trained as a stage actor. He went to Guildhall and has participated in other programs as a THEATRE actor, not a film actor and so many people don't realize that there is a huge difference between them. He went from doing stage acting immediately into film with no transitional training in there. That's why some of his acting is over the top and very staged-looking...because he's a stage actor and hasn't really had any film training. Lord of the Rings wouldn't help with training the subtleties of film because LOTR is a huge-scale fantasy, and thus everything is huge and over the top and otherwordly. Orlando DOES have talent. As an actor and someone who's seen enough good actors as well as bad actors, I can tell you that yes, he does have talent. He'll probably never be Johnny Depp...he may never win an Academy Award or be awarded some Lifetime Achievement Award...but he does have talent and I don't think we've had a decent enough chance to really see him shine. He was good in this movie, not great, but good. Very few people could have held their own next to Johnny Depp, but he did. But no one can steal the show when Johnny Depp's in the same movie.",1065225600,3,2484,4.449561403508772
1498012,5,B00005JM5E,"I admit, like a lot of people, the main reason I went to see this movie was to see Orlando Bloom. I know I know, that's a bad reason to want to see something, but to tell you the truth, his part wasn't all that great.  He did a wonderful job with what he was given, but honestly I could think of a dozen actors that could have done his part, but I don't think a lot of actors can carry out that British innocence and strength that coincides so well with Bloom.
  Of course, the best performance was Johnny Depp.  It is one of the best performances of his career.  I used to hate Johnny Depp before I saw this film, but I have an entire new respect for him.  Geoffrey Rush I think was great.  He was a great villain.  I almost didn't want him to die in the end.  The only thing he felt in a long time was coldness and death.  Rush did a great job, some very amusing lines as well.
  Keira Knightly also did a very good job.  Her and Bloom are by far the years hottest stars, with some great films for both of them (Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King-Bloom, and Bend it Like Beckham-Knightly)
  I was pleasantly surprised by this film and now a big fan.  What surprises me is how many films I enjoy seem to all fit together.  For example, I believe that if you are a fan of the Lord of the Rings films, maybe even the Harry Potter books/movies, you will throughly enjoy this great summer movie.",1064966400,,1399,4.065934065934066
1498013,2,B00005JM5E,"There are some movies that need to be more than two hours long: ""Gone With the Wind,"" ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Gladiator,"" ""Magnolia."" This summer's blockbuster ""Pirates of the Carribean"" is DEFINITELY not one that falls into that category, and its main flaw happens to be its drastically overlong running time (two and one half hours). Not only could the editor of the film have spent some more time doing some snipping, but the movie's sugary-sweet submental-script is embarrasingly spare. Its screenwriters MUST have spent a lot of time describing people getting hit in the head with various metal objects (a drinking game could be created with that overdone aspect of the film), for that seems to be a crutch on which the movie unfortunately leans. Yes, I'll agree with most of the rest of the movie-going public and say that Johnny Depp is fantastic in this film - he almost redeems it...almost. Sadly, the movie just goes on and on and on and on, jumping from ship to ship, and ""Pirates"" never seems to reach solid ground. Depp's performance becomes the only good thing about this movie, and it goes without saying that filmmaker Gore Verbinski (""The Ring"") should have just stayed on shore. Is the movie fun? Occasionally...but fun can only last for so long. Maybe DVD is a better medium for ""Pirates"" after all, though, because I sure could have used a fast-forward button in the theater.",1064966400,2,1394,4.836820083682008

However, that is not the case, since Johnny was backed up with a superb cast including the luscious Orlando Bloom, who plays the blacksmith, Will Turner.
This movie leaves the audience in suspence, it leaves them laughing out loud, and it holds on to their attention throughout the film.
This movie is absolutely WONDERFUL... I still can not get over the performance Johnny Depp gave in this movie... with his silly facial expressions, his sarcastic humor, his undying wit... he was just, quite simply, Oscar Material in that movie.

1498150,5,B00005JM5E,"A tremendously fun movie. In slight contradiction to the other reviewers here, Mr. Depp did not merely act his role extremely well, he completely submersed his personality into Capt'n Jack Sparrow and made him come alive as a real person.  When I looked at the screen I did not think that Johnny Depp makes a great pirate, I thought, ""Now HE'S a pirate I can like!  Wish there had been some like him back then."" [Edward England came close, but his career as a pirate came to an abrupt end when his crew marooned him for being too lenient to captives.]  To borrow words from Harrison Ford, ""I thought the POINT of acting was that you looked at the screen and thought --now THAT'S a [pirate]!""  Mr. Depp succeeds in this.
As to the rather churlish comments of one picayune person who thought it was stupid for the English to keep fighting foes they couldn't kill -- it's called SELF-DEFENSE!  The undead pirates were attacking them and fighting back was better than, ""We can't kill them so we'll lie down and die....""
Finally, a note for everyone who wondered about Sparrow's eye-liner and/or suggested sexual ambiguity:  Sailors, especially ones who had sailed in the vicinity of the East India Company(origin of Sparrow's pirate brand) and thus areas where use of kohl was common, used said kohl to cut the glare of the sun reflecting off the ocean.  Much like football players use that black stuff under their eyes, but are in no way sexually ambiguous.

I think it was a combination of the music, the actors/acting, the plot, and the fact that it was about pirates that really got me. In other words, I loved everything.
The music is amazing. I've got the soundtrack and I usually don't like orchestral music but I love this stuff. The rhythm and pattern of the music is really exciting and it will get stuck in your head and you'll hum it all day. It's so cool.
Johnny Depp shows how good of an actor he is, and how he can adapt to any role and really bring his character to life. Jack Sparrow seemed more real than any other movie character I've ever seen. He was hilarious. My friend and I spent the entire movie laughing. Orlando Bloom once again proves he can play roles with sword fighting and such. He's awesome. And I loved Captain Barbossa's crew. They were so funny.
The plot was so cool. It was twisted enough that it kept you guessing, but made perfect sense at the end. And you can go and see POTC a million times, and every time you'll pick up on something you didn't notice before. It's so cool how that happens.
All in all, I love this movie. It's definitely better than any other Disney movie ever made. I can wait for the DVD to come out. It's going to be worn out within a couple of weeks.

1498298,5,B00005JM5E,"Let me just say one thing up front. I didn't want to see this film.  I don't like pirate movies.  I wasn't particularly a fan of Johnny Depp.  However, a friend insisted that I see ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" and I went, moaning, groaning, and dragging my feet all the way.  So, the moral of the story is (for all you people who are skeptical and haven't yet seen this wonderful film) to keep an open mind.
This movie blew me away. First of all, Johnny Depp was amazing. I've never seen a performance that could equal his. You can't take your eyes off of Depp to even appreciate the other fine acting in the film unless you've watched the movie several times! Secondly, I liked the plot twists. It is rare that I watch a film and miss any of what is going on. I did with this film, and had to watch it several times in the theatre to understand precisely what was happening, and just how incredibly clever Captain Sparrow was.  Furthermore, watch the subtle shifts in Depp's performance when he's with people or alone. There's a clear difference.  Sparrow is far more focused, thoughtful, and decisive alone.  He's putting on a hypnotic act when in front of others.  It's a one man acting tour de force, awesome to watch.  Third, I was on my college fencing team and have always been really picky about the swordplay in a movie. There have been some great sword fights in the past, most recently in ""The Princess Bride,"" but the consistency and quality of the sword play in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" was highly impressive.  Some critics complained about too many sword fights, but I loved each and every one of them. They were terrific. Finally, the music and cinematography were wonderful, adding greatly to the overall impact of the film.  I consider it this year's best movie par none so far.
It's hard to come up with enough superlatives to describe this movie.  I predict that this film will become one of the true family classics, like ""The Princess Bride"" was. It is equally enjoyable for children and adults, and is entertaining no matter how many times you've seen it. The commentary (including Depp), bloopers, and deleted scenes make this DVD a clear must-have.  My only wish is that, like ""The Lord of the Rings"" DVDs, they would come out with an extended version of the movie.",1063324800,2,2290,4.569682151589242

Sorry. Got a bit carried away there. I've always been a sucker for pirate stories. Treasure Island was one of my favourite books when I was a kid, the above mentioned 'Long John Silver Impersonators vs Bournemouth Gynaecologists' is in my opinion one of the most brilliant Monty Python sketches ever, and I still think the 'Monkey Island' series from LucasArts are some of the greatest games ever made.
One can imagine I was rather excited when I first saw announcements for this flick being made. More so, it starred Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. Depp has been an actor I've lately grown a greater and greater appreciation for, and Bloom was simply amazing in LOTR, so I was rather curious to see how he'd hold up.
Finally. Once more a REAL pirate movie, unlike the miserably failed 'Ghost Ship'. Tough sea-hardened swashbucklers. The trailers confirmed this, and it was a definate must-see for me.
The story kicks off when little Elizabeth Swan, daughter of the governor, rescues the boy Will Turner out of the sea. Around his neck she discovers a medallion that proves he's a pirate. Not wanting the boy to get hurt, she takes and hides it.
Several years later, a group of cursed ghost pirates kidnap her because of the medallion, and Will Turner sets out to rescue her, along with the untrustworthy (or is he?) Captain Jack Sparrow, who almost got caught, and then almost got away.
So. The movie's got everything a good pirate movie needs: A band of bad guys, some good guys, a treasure (even though 'not all treasure is silver or gold, mate'), a damsel in distress, swordfights, and explosions (Trust Jerry Bruckheimer to blow stuff up any time of the day).
What blew my mind though was the humour included in the movie. From the very first moment the viewer meets Captain Jack sparrow, it's hard to not stiffle a laugh. Great little bits of dialogue, cleverly combined with visual humour. If you ever saw 'The Princess Bride', you'll know the type I mean.
The CGI in the movie was allright. Nothing we haven't seen before, but still it shows a great lot of detail was put into it.
The cast was excellent, though it seems as if particularly Depp and Bloom were typecast for their earlier performances in 'Fear and Loathing Las Vegas', and 'Lord of the Rings' respectively. However, they managed to give it enough of a twist to not have the viewer get the feeling he's seen it before. Geoffrey Rush plays a wonderful michievously dastard. The gorgeous Keira Knightley makes for a great damsel, and you can tell there's definatly a spark between her and Bloom. For fans of 'Allo, 'Allo, pay close attention, and you might recognise the harbourmaster as 'Leftenant Gruber'!
All in all, this movie's got something for everyone. There's fights, there's pirates, there's explosions, there's action, humour, the occassional backstab, and a gorgeous woman.
Go see :)",1063324800,4,2931,4.771653543307087
1498412,4,B00005JM5E,"I normally don't write online reviews, but I was inspired by someone who is trying to make PotC sound likesome sort of watered down version of a typical ghost story, which it definitely is not. Unlike some people who only like movies that have explosions every ten seconds and violent gore, I think this movie is good for the people that like movies that have a little bit of every genre in them. It has drama, romance, horror, comedy and action all in one fell swoop. The plot (although not original) is told in an entertaining way, and the fact that a pirate story could be told without resorting to complete and utter depravity is a testament to the good writing. It's not a deep-thinking kind of movie, but just a fun one.",1063324800,3,726,4.466165413533835
1498413,5,B00005JM5E,It's a fun-filled movies that won't leave you disappointed. Even though it's based on a Disneyland ride it's not bad at all. The special effects are awesome and the acting is great. Depp is good evenwith the pounds of make-up caked on.,1063324800,,235,4.619047619047619
1498414,5,B00005JM5E,"Disney has been known for their fairy tales such as Cinderella and Snow White. But with Pirates of the Caribbean they get a whole new style.
The story begins when a British Navy vessel comes across a burning ship, victims of pirates. Floating with the debris is young Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) son of famous pirate Bootstraps Bill. Around his neck is a medallion, a very unique medallion.
8 years later Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) arrives in the British village of Port Royal, Jamaica. The former captain of the Black Pearl wants revenge, on his mutinous first mate Captain Barbossa (Geoffery Rush).
All grown up, Will Turner, a black smith, has taken a fancy to Miss Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightly), the governor's daughter. When Elizabeth and Will met 8 years earlier she stole the medallion for fear he was a pirate.
As fate would have it Barbossa raids the town looking for his medallion, and it's owner. Will takes the help of Jack to find Miss Swan, and for Jack the Black Pearl.
This new motion picture by Disney will have you taking a whole new look at Disney. Johhny Depp is hilarious, all the actors did a great job in bringing this film together.",1063238400,,1166,4.665048543689321
1498415,5,B00005JM5E,"I've seen this movie 22 time in the theatre so far and plan on going back again soon...enough said!!!  Johnny Depp steals the show as well as a few ships & my heart...I've never seen him in ANYTHING before this, but the Captain Jack Sparrow character was so hot I had to see it AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN!!! OH MY GOD, HURT ME!!!!!  VERY original character due to Depp's wonderful portrayal of him, especially when you consider the fact that he actually went to the trouble of going to his dentist & having his front teeth capped in 3 different karats & colors of gold for this part!  THAT'S a dedicated actor for you!  Anyway, the whole movie is fantastic, the sets are amazing, the action will keep you awake for the whole 2 hours & 14 minutes, the musical score is unparalleled, and, AGAIN, the Jack Sparrow character is so fun, wonderful & different from anything I've seen before that even if I hadn't already loved pirates, I'd have wanted to become one after seeing this!  If you haven't seen it, go NOW--I can't wait for the DVD to come out, but there's nothing like seeing this 40 feet high & being in the middle of a good cannonfire battle.  This movie really NEEDS to be seen in a theatre the first 10-20 times...and there's a sequel coming!!!  Now, bring me that horizon...",1063065600,5,1284,4.438297872340425
1498416,5,B00005JM5E,"First of all, this is the best movie you'll see this year. Yeah, so what if it was based on another Disneyland ride, this ones actually good! The acting, action and graphics are incredible. If your picky about graphics (and trust me, we all are to some degree)this movie is a jaw dropper. Everyone in this movie acts out thier part very well. They worked very well togeather and it adds to the whole of the movie! The action, for those of you looking for blood and gore, don't ecpect a whole lot but it is very intense. The ships fighting, sword fights and when the cursed pirates take it over. There is also a little twist at the end so watch very carefully! Overall a great movie and I would reccomend it to anyone. In fact it's so good my firend and I have seen it SEVEN times!!! I really hope you at least rent it because if you don't you'll be missing out on a gret movie!",1063065600,2,877,4.195266272189349
1498417,5,B00005JM5E,"Pirates of the Caribbean is a delightful summer film filled with pirates, gold, monkeys, and the almighty eye-candy.  So far it has $275 million at the box office and still remains near the top of the charts.
Depp plays Captin Jack Sparrow, an alcoholic pirate who escapes from an island and meets up with Will the blacksmith, played by Orlando Bloom.  When Will's love intrest Elizabeth is captured by a hoard of pirates, it's up to Will and Jack to follow the cursed ship the 'Black Pearl' and save Elizabeth from certain death.
'Pirates' is a film that has wonderful comedy and jaw dropping special FX scenes.  Every one in the family will love this film although some young children may find it a wee bit intense.
It's the best film of the summer and is guarenteed to be a favourite in your DVD collection.",1062979200,,810,4.572413793103448

......
Johnny Depp has NEVER been afraid to voice his opinion. Thus, when he says something that angers someone, he does not apologize- UNLESS, what he said was grossly misquoted. He does not APOLOGIZE for things he says, when it is properly quoted. His statement to Stern, the German magazine, which is Germany's equivilent of the USA's National Enquirer and other disreputable rag's, was horribly taken out of context. No surprise considering the source.
Johnny's rebutle, above, was issued, not as an apology, but as a correction. Since he never does something like that when he is properly stated, you can be sure, what Stern said, WAS horribly inaccurate.
So, all of you who think Johnny un-american, you need to get yourself a girl mate!!",1062979200,,931,4.89873417721519
