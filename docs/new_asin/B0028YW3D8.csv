8357202,5,B0028YW3D8,"I couldn't wait for the DVDs to come out for season 2. It was one of my favorite. The dvds are similar to the first one. It's a complete season with some behind the scenes extras. In terms of quality, it's better than watching them directly on tv. I know this isn't that helpful, so I'm sorry.",1251331200,7,293,4.157894736842105
