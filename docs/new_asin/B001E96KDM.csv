8297203,3,B001E96KDM,i expected the video to be much longer than it actaully was.  what was there was good but it seemed as short as a commercial.,1300665600,,125,4.0
8297204,5,B001E96KDM,"I don't know if I've ever described something as all of the above...but this film is all of those things.
If the opposite of dark wasn't light... it'd be what this movie is.  The opposite of dark.  Sunny, elegant, demented and endearing.  Full of candor and dander.",1289865600,,265,4.595744680851064
8297205,5,B001E96KDM,"Loved ""Beauty School""! And it didn't matter that I'm not a dog owner. A wonderful chance to look inside a world most of us never see. Wanna peek?...see ""Beauty School""! Very funny as well as touching.",1234828800,,200,4.583333333333333
8297206,5,B001E96KDM,"I've been living in NYC for over 14 years and it's great to discover yet  another kooky place in the city. I've actually wondered where you learn how to groom dogs, and then this documentary appeared. The film is a great view into their world and some very interesting history of the grooming school business. I agree with Timothy Schadt's review - I want to see more!",1230508800,,368,4.492537313432836
8297207,5,B001E96KDM,"This portrait of the NY School of Dog Grooming is at times wry and very tongue-in-cheek.  It's also charming and highly entertaining.  And who doesn't think that a dripping wet dog is adorable?!?!?!?  The only flaw I found was the duration.  It's a short film and leaves you wanting more.  If you are a dog owner or just love dogs, you'll love Beauty School.",1228521600,,358,4.53125
