7725198,5,B01DWXO08E,"This movie was great.  I bought it after it was advertised on TWC Central and it was not a disappointment.  The story was believable and well laid out.

You may need tissues in some parts but the whole movie is awesome.  It is about time an original movie cam out that had substance to it.",1465862400,2,289,4.2
7725199,4,B01DWXO08E,"I don't remember this movie ever even coming to the movie screens! I thought it was a really good movie. The actors are all super talented, from Russell Crowe, who plays a troubled and ill recent widower who also happens to be a successful writer to Amanda Seigfried, who plays his grown daughter in flash-backs over a 27 year period. Aaron Paul is also in the film as well as Diane Kruger, Bruce Greenwood, Octavia Spencer and Jane Fonda in a modest, but important role.
I don't want to give away the plot as IMO, this is a film well worth seeing! It's not at all either a typical story or a predictable one, but it does touch on a lot of subjects that at some time or another, many of us will face. I thought the story was told beautifully and as usual, this group of talented actors do not disappoint.",1465689600,25,804,4.296052631578948
7725200,3,B01DWXO08E,"Katie's a promising psychologist with her own major relationship problem,  promiscuity and an inability to have a serious relationship.  The film weaves her story together with the more interesting story of her father's struggles.  By the time his story is resolved, it is clear to the viewer why she has the problem she does.  She comes to understand her problem when she deals, as a psychologist in training, with someone who has some of the feelings she once had--an indication of how widespread this kind of family issue is. Evidently, it is her experience as a therapist that enables her to overcome her own issues.  The non-linearity of the film's presentation of the story does not make it less predictable  It is a bit hard to believe that someone who is supposed to be as talented a psychologist as Katie could miss a diagnosis that the audience makes early on.  But then it is also hard to believe what her family does--real life issues are usually more subtle.  A good performance from Crowe.",1464825600,8,1003,4.757225433526012

7725212,5,B01DWXO08E,"Review of Fathers and Daughters
Hot Toasty Rag, September 29, 2017

After his wifes death, Russell Crowe cant cope with being a single father. He may be a beloved successful writer, but he has deep psychological problems. Twenty-five years later, his daughter Amanda Seyfried is getting her masters in psychology and volunteering at a childrens center. The film cuts back and forth between the past and the present, and while normally I don't like those types of movies, Fathers & Daughters is an exception.

For some unknown reason, this film was completely ignored during awards season, even though the acting is phenomenal and Brad Deschs script is powerful. Russell Crowe gives the type of performance that is deserving of an Oscar, but he didn't even get a nomination. He hasn't shown off his acting chops like this in over ten years. Kylie Rogers plays his little girl, and her performance in the film is incredible and heart-wrenching. I hope she has a marvelous career as she grows up; child actresses with that much talent are hard to find. I thought Amanda Seyfried would cheapen the film with her lack of talent, but surprisingly, she wasn't bad. Her character is written to have tons of problems, so her unlikability isn't really her fault. While I may be critical of actors sometimes, Im the first to admit when someone shows their hidden talents, and Amanda has a couple of very well-acted scenes in the film.

This is a very heavy movie, so get out your Kleenexes and have the pause button ready; youll need to take a couple of breaks and have a good cry. I watched it with my mom, but anyone brave enough to watch it with her dad will probably shed twice as many tears. Rent it, though, even if you need to watch it by yourself. Its worth it.",1506643200,2,1758,4.646302250803859

7725218,5,B01DWXO08E,This movie was superb! I have not a single bad review. The story line is heartwarming and I enjoyed how the writer interchangeably incorporates the love between a Father and his Daughter and a love story between two strangers. This movie highlights the importance of forgiveness and resilience in overcoming adversity! Great movie.,1501286400,,331,5.264150943396227

7725223,3,B01DWXO08E,"With so many great actors, this movie had the potential for being really good. Unfortunately it drags in some parts, is choppy and disjointed at times, and is totally sappy and stereotypical at others. While he was ok, this was not Russell Crowe's best performance; however, he really didn't have much to work with so I can't fault him. I don't think any of these fine actors were challenged by this script to bring their best forward. Mediocre at best.",1495324800,,453,4.675

7725232,2,B01DWXO08E,"The positive reviews of this movie are perplexing to say the least.  The characters are either underdeveloped or so one dimensional that it's one of the most trite films I can recall in some time.  Everything is a stereotype.  The ever-loving father, the rich uncle, the resentful sister of the deceased wife, the uncaring social work supervisor, the adult daughter who has ""man issues"" which she tries to resolve with sex, and the loving understanding boyfriend who will save her from herself.  Bleeech!  So cheesy and unrealistic!  Although Russell Crowe's acting was great, unfortunately, Amanda Seyfried's acting leaves much to be desired.  Skip this film.",1486598400,,660,5.228571428571429

7725258,5,B01DWXO08E,"This is such an emotional journey to take by watching the movie.  Outsiders may not always have the best interest of a child during difficult situations, and often will try to ram their own agenda down the throat of the ones going through difficult times, and try to take advantage of that challenging situation.  What I like about the movie is that it depicts how traumatic events in childhood can lead to poor decisions as an adult.  I think anyone who has experienced trauma in childhood, or is involved with someone who was traumatized, should watch this movie to get a better understanding of how people can make poor choices for themselves as adults.  And the best part is that it has a happy ending.",1483401600,,706,4.624

The story is of a young woman who's fast on her way of destroying her personal life because of deep seated loss. The actress Amanda Seyfried was excellent, the perfect casting choice to perform the delicate balance of good girl, sweet, intelligent and compassionate who acts out sexually (behaves like a slag).  Crowe of course is a Master so his performance draws you in immediately and bleeds you of empathy. Don't be disheartened as the ending is hopeful.",1477872000,5,776,4.834586466165414

I enjoyed the movie and while it did go back and forth into the past and present, I felt it kept me wondering what really happened to get her to the various points in the movie. It was a reflection and glimpse into what created struggles in her current situation.

Crowe is such a good actor, especially when it comes to the ""serious"" sides of things.  Amanda Seyfried (adult Katie) was amazing as well as her younger version Kylie Rogers.  I became so wrapped up in the storyline that I was arguing with the characters.  Mainly, Katie's aunt (Diane Kruger) and uncle (Bruce Greenwood).  At no point could I decide where the storyline was going or how it would all end.  Which is a fantastic feat with most of today's movie choices.  This is the second movie I've seen with Quvenzhane Wallis (Lucy/orphaned girl).  She previously played ""Annie"" in the 2014 re-make of ""Annie"" (also starring Jamie Foxx).

It really showed how much a father's love touches the core of a daughter's heart and how their relationship influences the rest of her life. Everything in this movie was deep and meaningful. I got choked up many times because it touched me deeply. Everything from her fear of real love to the self destructive patterns to the need to become a therapist worked so well for the daughter's character. That her father remained deeply committed to her was also profoundly touching. When it all tied together I wept and felt the same pain of intense loss. Without giving away any spoilers I can say I repeated the words ""oh no"" about five times because I was so saddened. Yet it all made sense. She was deeply wounded but she also decided to heal and allow love into her life despite the fact that it terrified her to think of losing someone she loved again. What a fabulous and touching story.

7725373,2,B01DWXO08E,"I did not like the ""Pursuit of Happyness"" either, by the same director.

With both movies, I could not get a tear to well up if my life depended on it.

I think in ""Fathers and Daughters"",  the back and forth in the time periods didn't contain enough substance to get the audience invested in the characters to feel much emotion.

When Russell Crowe got out of the hospital after several months, and took Katie out of his sister and brother-in-law's care, there was a missed opportunity for a complex scene.  She was very loved in that family, and it seems it would have been a more difficult separation than Katie just saying, ""Bye""  There should have been more background that would have given the audience a feel of how that separation affected everyone concerned.

I think Russell Crowe is a great dramatic actor, but he has a certain aloof quality.  He's great in ""Big"" movies like ""Master and Commander"" or ""Gladiator"", but nuance is not one of his best skills.

I think there has to be chemistry that happens naturally because of good writing, and direction, and actors that come together because of it.  This landed pretty hard.",1473379200,,1136,4.663316582914573

As his health deteriorates, he struggles to keep he and his daughter's lives afloat. His wife's sister, Elizabeth; struggling with her own demons, and a need to blame someone for the death of her only sister, grasps onto her niece, and attempts to take her away from her ailing father in court, with the help of her lawyer husband.

7725384,4,B01DWXO08E,"Fathers and Daughters is a film that even your not satisfied overall with the characters or the storyline, or you simply didn't like it, you can't deny it has some great acting in it.  Russel Crowe, I'm not a big fan of, but I would not only rate this as his best performance but acknowledge it was a damn good one.  The extreme uncontrollable shakes of his arm and hands seemed pretty realistic to me (granted I don't know anyone in real life who has to deal with this).  He portrayed well the stress from dealing with rich and powerful in laws who are malicious and bullying and using his daughter as a pawn for their vengeance against him as they clearly never liked him when he was married to his wife and blame the fact that she's dead, on the fact she was in a car with him.  His stress  was evident in the scenes where he's trying to keep his daughter.  Kylie Rogers the young actress who plays the child version of Katie does a brilliant job too, the museum scenes for example where she witnesses another mother with a child.  The older version of Katie has a Katie pretty much as a different character to the younger version, but Amanda Seyfried portrays what she has become well.  Aaron Paul does a pretty good job as the potential boyfriend who has to deal with Katie's actions.
Diane Kruger and Bruce Greenwood as the evil in laws were also superb.

The movie itself isn't as great as the acting.  This is one of those films that flashes forward and backwards through it's timeline. (Some mild spoilers may be worked out from what follows). Because it does this you can work some things you haven't seen happen yet was before they do.  Parts of it I wasn't sure when they were happening, such as the Katie as a psychologist scenes, which I assume happened before she meets Cameron, Aaron Paul's character as I can't imagine someone in that mental state could act normal to keep that job.  I found the line that  Cameron uses when he meets Katie about Fathers and Daughters being his favourite book when he as a kid to be a bit, ""yeah right"".  It's a book about a father and his daughter, something he was neither of so why would he have read it.  I get that it won the Pulitzer Prize so Crowe's character was obviously a great author, because he achieved that twice, but I still find it pretty hard to believe Cameron would have read it as a child. Being you're also seeing what Katie turns into early in the film, your kind of seeing her fathers efforts as well futile.",1472601600,,2482,4.388646288209607

7725397,3,B01DWXO08E,"Although I won't say this is the perfect family drama film, I am surprised at the critics panned this movie so much that it was never released in theaters and only released on DVD 3 years later.  I have seen far worse movies that get a big screen debut at least.  There is a great cast with this and some good performances from Russell Crowe and Amanda Seyfried.

The story is a good but the choppy direction with constant flashbacks throughout the whole movie tend to interrupt the flow of the story a bit too much.  Some of the flashbacks, especially in the beginning are a bit too subtle and tended to confuse the story a bit until I realized this was going to told in that manner.

Seyfried has a good emotional performance but there is a lack of true character development with both her and Crowes character which detracts from the otherwise solid performances from the two.  The other flaw in the movie is there are a bit too many plotlines going on throughout the movie with most of them not being fully developed or at least not developed as well as they should have been.

Even with its flaws though, I enjoyed the movie and thought that although it was not great, it was a pretty good family drama movie.  Seyfrieds performance along with some heartfelt, emotional scenes made this worth watching to me, even if it came up a little short in its direction and ambition of what it tried to be.

7725419,2,B01DWXO08E,"Italian helmer Gabriele Muccino has found his greatest stateside success with the maudlin parent/child dramedy The Pursuit of Happyness, which introduced the world to Will Smith's then-adorable son, Jaden. But he's been in a tailspin ever since, with the lowest ebb the overdramatic and undercooked Seven Pounds, a film that makes Muccino's mercenary work on junky soccer rom-com Playing for Keeps seem like a wise course of action. Muccino's latest is another histrionic piece about the connection between parent and child, the boringly-titled Fathers and Daughters, and despite a starry cast it's just another cloying sap fest.

Split between two time periods, both equally heavy-handed, Fathers and Daughters stars Russell Crowe as Jake Davis, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author trying to raise his 5-year-old daughter Katie (Kylie Rogers then, Amanda Seyfried as an adult) alone after his wife was killed in an accident. As if that wasn't enough, Muccino piles on the grief like a free buffet at Golden Corral. Nerve damage he suffered has made writing nearly impossible, and to make matters worse Jake is slowly but surely losing his mind. He also needs a hit book after his last one, the unfortunately-titled ""Bitter Tulips"" (Who would buy that??) flopped hard even though he thought it his masterpiece. Oh, and he might lose Katie to his reprehensible in-laws (Diane Kruger and Bruce Greenwood) still holding a grudge over the accident.

Throughout all of the pitfalls placed ahead of him, Jake remains a loyal and caring father to Katie, which makes the personal demons she suffers from as an adult difficult to connect with her childhood. But Muccino takes a valiant effort to do it, anyway. Twenty-seven years later and Katie is in college seeking a psychology degree. She's the classic case of a therapist who is more screwed up than any of her patients could ever hope to be. Intimacy issues abound as Katie sleeps with literally any guy who'll speak to her, and when she finds one who actually loves her (played her former Big Love co-star Aaron Paul) she ruins it. Those self-destructive tendencies aren't helping her to treat a young patient (Quvenzhane Wallis) coping with far more tragic circumstances than Katie ever had to go through.

In typical Muccino fashion the dialogue is corny and strangely on-the-nose, such as Katie's insistence, ""I don't love. I'm an empty well. There's nothing in here"". Okay we get it.

Jake eventually writes a massively successful book. Can you guess what the title of it was? ""Fathers and Daughters"", of course, apparently about the dull upbringing his daughter had. Somehow everybody loved it, but it's tough to figure out why. It's also a little absurd that Katie, a psych major, can't pick up on her own daddy issues, especially with the utter lack of subtlety Muccino tries to drive the connection home. Seyfried makes the most of an under-written and poorly conceived character, while Crowe is perhaps the most sympathetic he's ever been. It could be because we feel bad for him being stuck with this screenplay, but whatever the reason you can't help but feel for the guy. Crowe does seem to have formed a genuine bond with Rogers in the many scenes they share together.

Jane Fonda, Octavia Spencer, and Janet McTeer co-star, making for such an impressive list of Oscar winners and nominees you have to wonder if they all signed on just to work with one another. Surely it wasn't for the material, which is so heavy on theatrics it may have been better served going full-on camp.",1470182400,,3535,4.974619289340102

7725423,4,B01DWXO08E,"This is the touching story of a father and the relationship with his daughter which is not a surprise considering the title of the movie. This movie faintly reminded me of A Beautiful Mind as Russell's character is an award winning writer and not everyone can be a writer. Also like in A Beautiful Mind, Russell's character here suffers health problems. This time they take the the form of seizures making him unable to care for his daughter. Kylie Anne Rogers plays Russell's young daughter and she is a rising star. Russell's scenes with her are adorable. For a few years, Russell's daughter has to be raised by his sister in law as his wife has died. Being separated from her dad causes Russell's daughter to have a problem trusting men as a young woman. Amanda Seyfried plays Russell's daughter as an adult. She finds a good man who truly loves her but confesses to him she has no idea how to be in a relationship. I don't really see why she develops these problems as her father did not leave her of his own free will and he was able to take back custody of her after a few years. That might be one of the reasons I give the movie only four stars. There are a few scenes that are somewhat disturbing when Amanda is a young adult woman before she meets her boyfriend. She gives herself to anyone anywhere without any pride. Those scenes are tough to watch and make me unable to recommend watching it as a family including young children.",1469491200,3,1441,4.441509433962264

7725445,4,B01DWXO08E,"""That's what this book is really about, it's about me."" Jake Davis (Crowe) is a famous author who as just lost his wife and now he is in a fight to keep his daughter Katie (Seyfried). While trying to write a book that hill become a best seller he is trying to pay off lawyers in order to keep his wife's sister from taking his girl. Katie, all grown up now, is struggling to maintain a normal relationship. One of the books her father wrote as an impact on both their lives. This is a fantastic movie, and also one of the most emotional films I have seen in a long time. It may be because I am a father myself but I really got emotionally invested in this and found myself holding back tears over and over. Crowe does a perfect job of trying to balance being a father with trying to do everything he can to save his girl. Seyfried gives maybe the best performance she has ever given and is very believable as someone who has lost her way and doesn't know how to be happy and ""normal"". This is a movie I could go on and on about but I will just say watch this and you will feel the same way I did. Overall, emotionally powerful and gripping.

7725460,5,B01DWXO08E,"This is a fascinating movie not only because of the story it tells but how it tells the story.

Spoilers will be listed in this review so stop reading if you do not want to know.

It is told from 2 points of view set in 2 different times, 25 years apart.
It is told from the father's (Jake Davis) point of view as he struggles to regain his health after a car crash that killed his wife and left him brain injured and having uncontrollable seizures. You watch him fight to maintain custody as his daughter's (Katie Davis or potato chip, his nickname for her),  Aunt and Uncle try to take the child away and adopt her.  The Aunt and Uncle are very rich, to quote the Uncle, they have more money than God, while Jake is a struggling Pulitzer-winning writer.

The other side of the story we see Katie who is all grown up and knows little of the real struggles of what her father faced others than those in his last book Fathers and Daughters. Ironically it was named that as he was writing one night and she asked what about, he said it is about her- to which she replied can it be about us? Yes he replied, and renamed it Fathers and daughters.

It is now 25 years in the future and she is a social worker who is facing her own demons and must somehow adjust and move forward letting go of a very painful past.  If she is to find lasting love she must trust it to last and not disappear on her- trust history will not repeat itself.

At first it was a confusing but you quickly learn if she is grown it is present day but if she is little it is most likely her father telling his story. I think it is genius way to tell same story from 2 points of view at the same time.

We are left realizing we can be loved and adored but that will not ensure we are not carrying baggage. We all have ghost from our past that haunts us and come out damaged but it is dealing with that and moving forward that makes us who we are everyday.

Now about the cast:
Russell Crowe legend what can I say, you know him, we love him and he shines as bright as ever.

Amanda Seyfried, I knew her from Big love years ago, she has really grown a lot in her acting and she totally sold the part,

Aaron Paul I know from Breaking Bad (Jesse Pinkman), excellent job and perfect casting.

I cried so hard during some parts of the film. If only we could all have dad's who would fight for us , love us, one where we could be their potato chip.

Incredible warmth coming from Russell Crowe towards his daughter and of course she to him - the closeness we all wish to have with our family.  The entire movie was real to life, not the more far-fetched scenarios people seem to enjoy - although some reviewed it as 'predictable' - I found none of that.  Through the flip flops from little girl to adult, it was easy to follow, and nothing was ever lost in the story, but it made you see the transitions in her personality and why. Most of us reflect on our upbringing/past to understand our personality and behaviors.  This can be a very personal, thought-provoking movie and it could be mothers and daughters or sons and fathers, it won't make a difference.  My best advice is to watch the movie, think for yourself, and not concern yourself with the professional critics.  So many of the reviews were so off-base, missed the delights and the heartbreaks, had a lack of human compassion, were intent on echoing negativity - make up your own mind; bet you watch it more than once!",1523145600,4,1093,4.551020408163265
