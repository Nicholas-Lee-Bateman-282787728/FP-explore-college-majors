1445135,5,B00005JL57,"Most movies stick with me about as long as it takes to walk out of the lobby into the fresh air.  ""Y Tu Mama Tambien,"" is of a different order.  It's all the things you've heard:  a social satire, a road movie, a coming-of-age movie, and a meditation on friendship; and in all these things it is sharp, energetic, and very funny.  But as a meditation on friendship, and with its message of living life as fully as possible, it is also quite moving.  ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" starts with a bang - you'll see what I mean - and the energy doesn't let up for one second.  With all that, it even manages an extraordinarily poignant ending.  It is an artfully made movie, with no artifice.  The characters are real, and engaging, and they deepen as the movie progresses.  ... ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" is on the mark and true.  I think it was a good thing for Mr. Cuaron to get out of Hollywood.  This is a terrific movie, a little raunchy, very sexy, and finally very tender.  I hope it lifts your day as high as it did mine.",1018828800,10,1009,4.197916666666667
1445136,4,B00005JL57,"****1/2 ""Y tu Mama tambien,"" a stunning new product of the New Mexican Cinema that is achieving crossover success in the American film market, is a frank, open and uninhibited celebration of teenage sex - masterfully directed by Alfonso Cuaron and beautifully enacted by a trio of first-rate performers.  Don't miss it - provided you are not offended by sometimes-graphic depictions of sexual activity (please note that the film is unrated).  The matter-of-fact, unflinching way in which Cuaron films his sex scenes purges them of indecency and helps to bring a new frankness to a subject all too often approached by American filmmakers in the form of tittering exploitation (wherein the directors and writers seem as adolescent in their attitudes as the characters on the screen).
Not so here.  The film centers around two boyhood chums, Tenoch and Julio, just embarking on their careers as university students, who, for one last glorious summer, decide to revel in all the wildness, hedonism and promiscuity that carefree adolescence has to offer (the title of the film is emblematic of the youthful immaturity of the characters).  With their girlfriends away in Europe, the two decide to take a road trip through Mexico with Luisa, the attractive young wife of one of Tenoch's stuffed shirt cousins.  While on the journey, the three of them not only indulge in all the bizarre sexual hijinks that both the situation and their hormones would lead one to expect, but they also learn a thing or two about life, about relationships and about how sex can be used both to bring people closer together as well as to pull them farther apart.  For indeed, one thing the film makes very clear both to the characters and to us is that sex can often be employed as a weapon to wound those we care most about, especially with all the power shifting that takes place even in some of the most non-sexual of relationships.  The boys also discover that sex can be used as a sublimation to avoid recognizing what one REALLY wants.  This awakening leads to a final scene that is almost heartbreaking in its understated poignancy and pathos.
One of the most unsettling - and thereby controversial - aspects of the film (and the one that will make it uncomfortable for many in the audience) is that it refuses to take a moralistic stance regarding its characters' behavior.  The filmmakers neither approve of nor condemn what these young people do - they merely record the events with an attitude of detached objectivity that precludes any finger-wagging disapproval.  If the characters learn any ""lessons"" from their experiences, they do so strictly on a subliminal, subconscious level - and the same goes for the audience.
As a director, Cuaron displays a confidence and spirit rarely seen in filmmaking today.  Along with his co-writer, Carlos Cuaron, the director has chosen to take an objective, almost documentary-style approach to the material, allowing the scenes to play themselves out in a way that makes them feel realistic, spontaneous and almost unscripted.  He uses a shaky, handheld camera much of the time to enhance the immediacy of the experience.  We often feel as if we are eavesdropping on the lives of these three fascinating individuals.  As a result, not a single moment of the film feels forced, contrived or artificial.  (Only the fate of one of the characters seems a bit convenient and contrived). Cuaron is not afraid to let the camera linger on a scene a moment two longer than necessary - nor is he afraid to let the camera wander off on its own from time to time, such as when it spontaneously follows a woman into the back of a roadside caf to show us the cooks hard at work in the kitchen.  Many of the shots even have an elegiac, travelogue feel to them.
Cuaron has been blessed with three outstanding young actors - Diego Luna, Gael Garcia and Maribel Verdu - who bring his characters to vivid, endearing life.  Utterly naturalistic in their every move, gesture and facial expression, the three of them play off each other in such a way that we never doubt for a moment the truth and sincerity of what we are seeing.  American actors please take note!
""Y tu Mama tambien"" is a stylistic triumph from first moment to last.  It has a playful, expansive spirit, as reflected in its openhearted attitude towards sex, its wry humor, its affection for its people and its country, and its visual appeal and inventiveness (Emmanuel Lubezki did the glorious cinematography).  The film has heart, soul and chutzpah.  What more could a jaded filmgoer want?",1018051200,6,4563,4.839331619537275
1445137,5,B00005JL57,"I agree with all the reviews: this movie is very good, it is funny, interesting, sexy; the photography is excellent, with nice musical score, etc.
However, I was really moved by Luisa's character. She is a very nice and tender girl. In particular I love the scene where she is in the car with the two guys and she talks about her old boyfriend, her first love. In a way, she reminds me of Avellaneda, the doomed character from Benedetti's ""La Tregua"" (don't know the english title)",1017878400,5,481,4.540229885057471
1445138,5,B00005JL57,"This is the second of two important films which have initiated a renaissance in Mexican films.  In my opinion, it is a better film than its well-reviewed predecessor, Amores Perros. Both films share the fact that a leading role is played by the talented actor Gael Garcia Bernal. However, I liked Y Tu Mama Tambien better than Amores Perros because overall the characters are much more likeable.  The plot of the film involves a road trip to the Oaxacan coast undertaken by two 17-year old boys, Tenoch and Julio, who are best friends, and the older female cousin of  Tenoch named Luisa. Each of the boys has a girl friend who is his sexual partner but the girl friends have gone to Italy for the summer. Luisa is 28 years old, married, but distressed at her husband's unfaithfulness. What makes this film so profound is the fact that it depicts a situation where the two boys are simultaneously best buddies and rivals to each other.  Moreover, each displays both homophobia and homosexual desire toward the other.",1017705600,27,1015,4.75
1445139,4,B00005JL57,"...
This movie is Mexican, addressed to Mexicans and in Mexico City patois. ""In Mexican"", the class situations are totally clear, though this may not come through to a foreign audience. The movie is perfectly funny, sexy and light-hearted, but it's in no way a piece of fluff. There's an underlying seriousness that it never loses track of. Class questions are one aspect of it.
In other words, the movie is Mexican in the sense of purposely unamerican (Mexicans are like that). The way it handles sex is especially unamerican. The spice bites much deeper than you'd expect, and it does link with the class question. (Everything is strongly linked in the movie, it's the opposite of made-by-committee.)
It's also a road movie. But it refuses the spaced-out approach this implies for the two kids. The trick is that the entire movie has an off-screen narrator, who is never spaced-out. The narration tells you, ""ok, that's the way the place is now, but ten years before ..."" or ""two years from now..."" It lets you take it as a road movie, but not as a dream.
All this comes from making the movie the way some American movies were made in the seventies, only with thirty years' maturing. No fancy shots, no fancy-lit stuff -- no budget and no fleet of trucks to take to each scene. Nothing is shot unless the actors *feel* like shooting it that way -- no budget for two teams of lawyer to negotiate shooting conditions. The result is acting that at times is stunning -- some images you'll remember for years.
After what might have been the last image, when the trio separates, there is an epilogue that occurs a year later. This is not to be skipped. It gives the movie its true closure in the real world. However, it reveals things that the girl, Luisa, knew from the start. I feel this is a flaw. Our narrator held back information that made Luisa's behavior much more reasonable than it seemed.",1017100800,8,1895,4.609467455621302
1445140,5,B00005JL57,"This brilliant film takes the genre of teen comedy, only  to subvert it through insight and depth.  Journeying from Mexico City to a mythical beach, the two spoiled adolescents at the center of the film find that life itself ultimately explodes the protective bubbles that have isolated them from any true connection with their Spanish lady companion or their rural fellow countrymen. Bearing resemblances to the French New Wave films of the 60's, ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" goes them one better.  Instead of resting in brittle ironic wit, it surprises by turning genuinely moving in its final scenes. With Shakespearian gusto, Cuaron takes a stale, shallow genre and infuses it with high artistry and a fresh take on contemporary life.",1017100800,6,729,5.058333333333334
1445141,1,B00005JL57,"This movie doesn't tell a story, it is all about making easy money by showing sex among some popular mexican a Spanish actors. Don't spend time on this one.",1016928000,8,156,4.413793103448276
1445142,4,B00005JL57,"The film is very hot, especially since it is an independent film and the cuts are not as heavy when its a full-blown Hollywood production. The actors really come across natural with a knack for becoming their characters. The movie explores the three main characters and does so quite well. You really get drawn into the film and feel like you know the actors and almost as if you are on the road trip with them. This film has alot of sex and alot of nudity. The sexual energy just crackles! The actress, starts out being almost intimadated by the two younger actors when she first meets them, being that they are very sexual and forward. It is easy to see they are attracted to her. She seems to pull back from them uncomfortable but as the plot thickens and she gets to know the two teens, things start to heat up. She actually dominates the sexual banter and intiates the sexual foreplay. This actress is quite good, I have seen her in a Spanish film, where she has been beaten and has only one eye, this movie is in complete contrast and really shows her as a sad but quite beautiful sex symbol. The two men are also quite good and nice to look at. The story has narration that fades in and out that focuses on Mexico's landscape, the future, the political corruption, the environment, the poverty, etc. The film also shows this visual, by the road trip these 3 characters take. Lets see the movie said a couple of things to me that seemed to conflict, a pardox if you will. It spoke out about corruption in general, corruption in Mexico, possibly America's influence on Mexican politics, corruption of two younger men by a woman who was older than them(they were actually quite innocent to women, by the end they had a menage e trois and a homosexual experience), also corruption of the poor by the rich. The film also showed how to be free and live life to your fullest. Be free with your sexuality, embrace it and don't be ashamed of it... The girls freedom was compared to the sea and how it flows and moves in which ever way it wants. Also Mexico is also portrayed as full of life and energy, something to be brought of. Two views that seem not to mesh but actually do. The film is surprisely good! The director also did The Little Princess and Great Expectations. I do recommend it, I would have given it 5 stars, but something held me back, it almost made it to 5.",1016150400,10,2374,4.3977272727272725
1445143,4,B00005JL57,"Alfonso Cuaron's ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" begins frankly as an X version of ""Road Trip,"" with the usual dudely hijinks and teenage male camaraderie with Gael Garcia Bernal (Amores Perros) as Julio and Diego Luna as Tenoch. But Cuaron has a lot more on his mind than the mindless fascinations and reveries of lusty teenage boys; even though there is plenty of that on the screen.
The first indication that there is something different happening here is the somewhat detached, omnipresent and omnipotent narrator which  reminds me of Truffaut's ""Jules and Jim."" The narrator fills in the gaps of exposition as well as commenting on the hows, whats and whys of what is happening in the storyline.
Julio and Tenoch (a reference to the ancient Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, of course) along with Luisa,(28 yrs old and running away from a cheating husband), embark on a road trip from Mexico City to the beach. Julio and Tenoch see this trip not only as an opportunity to escape their parents, drink lots of beer and smoke a lot of reefer but also as one to maybe/hopefully get together with Luisa. This journey encompasses a myriad of situations: sexual, political, sociological and certainly comical yet Cuaron manages to meld all this together into a compelling whole.
Even though Julio and Tenoch are your basic, fun-loving teenagers, they also see themselves as philosphers; swimming in attitude and better-than-thou conceit. Julio is from the working class and Tenoch from the upper. Yet they have formed a solid bond and friendship and are inseperable, calling themselves ""charolastras"" or astral cowboys and setting up a manifesto; one of the tenets is ""the truth is cool but unattainable."" One of Cuaron's strengths is that he views these boys from an amused distance neither condemming nor affirming their actions. In fact sociologically, though the two are far apart in Mexico's class structure, Cuaron is careful to present them as equally capable of bad as well as good.
One of the major set pieces and sly political commentaries of the film is Tenoch's sister's wedding attended not only by the President of Mexico but also by more armed bodyguards than guests! The camera moves swiftly and giddily between the wedding party, mariachis, horsemen dressed in traditional Mexican garb, El Presidente and his many bodyguards, Luisa and her husband, Jano and Tenoch and Julio guzzling beer and flirting with Luisa. This recalls a similar scene in ""Gosford Park"" and is equally as effective and awe-inspiring in it's power to evoke rapid-fire commentary in a short space of time.
All of the major players do an extraordinary job of presenting the film's complex brew of drama, comedy and sexual explicitness but Maribel Verdu stands out as the wise, Mother Earth Luisa; always game for the fun, never tiring of, even participating in the joie de vivre of Julio and Tenoch.
Like Gulliver, much is discovered, much is learned by Luisa, Julio and Tenoch. At one point during the journey Luisa, who is a native of Spain, comments on Mexico: ""You are very lucky to live in Mexico...it breathes with Life.""  She could very well be speaking of this film as well.",1016150400,8,3150,4.941509433962264

1445239,4,B00005JL57,"The problem with many coming-of-age films is that they are too sweet and sentimental. This movie has the right idea in that director Alfonso Cuaron clobbers viewers with all of the sordid, lewd behaviors and language that two teenage boys and their buddies use with unflinching accuracy. The result is a coming-of-age movie that has more resonance than flicks like Risky Business or Fast Times At Ridgemont High.

The problem is, all that obscenity works against it. Cuaron frames warts-and-all adolescence with the idea that our teen years are the last time any of us have to indulge freedom and desire before the vast wasteland of career and conventional family. Many viewers, however, might decide that they are glad to have their adolescence behind them--not that youth is wasted on the young, but rather that teenage rebellion might be overrated.

What saves the movie is the central plot about Maribel Verdu. The menage a trois seems a little indecent though never exploitative. The older woman and both boys seem willing and able and, as far I can tell, no one is being hurt emotionally. Verdu has some secrets that aren't revealed until the end and a few years after their tryst ends. Her revealed situation makes you reconsider the motives of all the characters. It's almost enough to make you buy Cuaron's idea that adulthood--at least in Mexico--is a spiritual death and adolescence is a last-ditch desperation bid for survival.

Like I said--almost. Cuaron's movie is not more substantial than American 80's style teen sex comedies--it just displays a greater skill at moviemaking. It also has a really raunchy trio of players unafraid to do anything for their gifted director. Tom Cruise got his start in Risky Business and moved up to better projects. Cuaron as a director has moved up as well.",1487462400,,1808,4.96039603960396

Maribel Verd is not a beautiful woman and I don't buy it that two men are crazy about her and during sex they come so fast. (let's say less then a minutes) I know she is a well known actress though.
Maybe it's a Mexican thing about woman.

1445540,5,B00005JL57,One of the best films of the early 2000s.  Happy to see it get the release it deserves from Criterion.,1428537600,,102,4.1
1445541,5,B00005JL57,"Whether you've already seen the movie and love it, or have yet to see it, I strongly recommend that you see the Criterion Collection version of Y Tu Mama Tambien. It far surpasses any other version of this movie, for several reasons: I bought the Criterion Blu-ray + DVD version because, given the fluctuations of my home Wi-Fi, I found that on Netflix I was sometimes watching the movie in glorious HD, and sometimes in a far lower resolution. I wanted to see the movie consistently in all its beauty in 1080p. The new restored version, supervised by the cinematographer Lubezki, is completely upgraded visually, with richer more saturated color, and even a 2k resolution for future Hi-res players. (For those with only DVD players, the Blu-ray version comes with DVD's thrown in as well).

But equally important and far less discussed, there is a new upgraded English translation to the subtitles. The difference is huge. Rather than the literal and often stilted translations that occur in the Netflix streamed version, in the Criterion version, the Spanish dialogue has been translated into clearer, smoother, and more colloquial English. It makes for a much more coherent rendering of the dialogue, in which both the explicit and implicit content of the speech come through. Until you experience the improved translation, it is hard to imagine how much it adds to the movie's subtlety. Let me give an example of what I'm talking about: In one brief scene, characters Tenoch and Julio are catching up about an old friend of theirs. Here is the dialogue in the standard Netflix version:

Tenoch: What about Daniel?
Julio: It's crazy man. His dad threw him out of the house.
Tenoch: Wow, what a bummer, right?
Julio: No, but... he's really happy, man. He's got a girlfriend and everything.
Tenoch: Ok, well... That's good.

Here is the same scene in the ""director-approved"" Blu-ray version:

Tenoch: And Daniel?
Julio: Total queen at this point. His dad kicked him out.
Tenoch: S*** , that sucks.
Julio: No, he's super happy, man. Got a boyfriend and everything.
Tenoch: Then that's cool.

Not only is the old version incoherent (Why would the father be kicking Daniel out?), it totally misrepresents the meaning of what Julio is saying. Daniel was kicked out because he's gay, but Julio notes, Daniel is now happy. The old version totally misleads us by giving Daniel a ""girlfriend,"" when in fact he now has a ""boyfriend."" Further, if the viewer doesn't understand that they're talking about a gay friend, the viewer would also miss the level of support and tolerance that they show for their old friend.

Overall, the updated translation is full of subtle changes in the dialogue, many small in themselves, but in their totality creating a much deeper sense of what's being said, and what's being implied. Quality of translation isn't something we talk about much, because if you don't speak both languages, you never realize what you're missing. In this case the difference is dramatic. For lovers of this film, the $22 for the Blu-ray + DVD is money well spent.",1427414400,18,3067,4.911196911196911

The sound is superb.  It is also very clear and even between character speech, narration, background sound, and music.  The 5.1 enhances the music, IMO. The guys speak Mexican DF Spanish slang while Maribel speaks a more Castilian (Spain) Spanish, so you have to have an ear--but don't blame the soundtrack!

On Y Tu Mama Tambien includes a 10-minute featurette made during the production with interviews with director Cuaron, co-writer Carlos Cuaron, director of photography Lubezki and actors Gael Garcia Bernal, Diego Luna and Maribel Verdu. They take us through its inception to filming with the actors talking about what drew them to the project. Also included is a 40-minute featurette from 2014 that has all the aforementioned participants look back at the film.

The Making of the Film is a 22-minute featurette from 2001 that offers all kinds of behind-the-scenes footage during principal photography and sheds light on how Cuaron works. We also see the dynamic between him and his cast and crew.

Also included are three deleted scenes that are entertaining in their own right, but were justly cut from the film.

Philosopher Slavoj Zizek talks about the socio-political context of Y Tu Mama Tambien. He examines how Cuaron sheds light on Mexican politics in the background of certain scenes.

1445881,5,B00005JL57,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Y Tu Mama Tambien (aka And Your Mother Too)"" [Mexico, 2001]

1. This is a rare coming of age film that dares to explore the topic of young adulthood in a deeper way than most such films do. Honestly, when this movie was released in 2001, I don't think America was ready to handle it. Its too truthful.

2. It stars Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna as Julio and Tenoch, two horny teenage boys who are best friends. The movie opens with two sex scenes - each of the boys is giving a special goodbye to their girlfriends before the girls take a trip to Italy.

3. Once the girls are gone, the boys are bored, so they convince Luisa, the hot wife of Tenochs cousin, to go with them on a road trip to a beach - even though they made the beach up in their head. Their plan is to sleep with Luisa during the trip.

4. The boys plan begins to work, and of course both boys start falling in love with Luisa. This opens a much deeper well of sexual angst and tension than they are ready to deal with. Emotions become raw and secrets come out.

5. Every now and then a narrator jumps in to give some background information, or to tell the audience things that the characters don't know. Its a weird touch.

6. There is some political subtext to the film, which I admit I didn't really understand.

7. Bernal and Luna positively shine as the friends who love each other more deeply than even they know. The movie would have been an awkward flop without their emotional commitment to the roles.

8. The movie won a number of international awards. Unfortunately, the films explicit sexual content prevented it from getting a wide release in America. Which is stupid. Yeah, there is a lot of sex, and a lot of nudity (male and female) but its not pornographic or gratuitous. It is an integral part of the characters development. Anyway, once again, very few Americans saw this film.

9. Even today, there are people who will not be comfortable with this movie because of the open sexuality of the characters, and the way the movie sensitively exposes secret (but common) characteristics of close male friendships. And that's too bad. This is a touching and honest portrayal of young adults figuring out that their emotions are a lot larger and less logical than they expected.",1406246400,3,2291,4.461722488038277

I'm glad I didn't listen.  Alfonso Cuaron's break through film may seem simple enough, two horny teenagers taking their sexy older female stepcousin for a ride to the coast, hoping to score with her.  What they don't realize is that the road shall bring about a personal discovery that they weren't expecting.  Along the way, the mysterious narrator gives us an overview of the class structure and the social conditions of a modern Mexico, which gracefully situates the sexual misadventures within a society of winners and losers, the entire Darwinian spectacle of extreme poverty and wealth,and how the children of the privileged entertain themselves with sex, drugs, and plenty of risk taking.  Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal start out as raunchy teenagers, but their final scenes at the end of the film show their growth and acceptance of their own vulnerabilities, and yes, there's one big surprise in their own feelings and sexuality, and a poignant revelation about their tragic older woman who found a way to love them both.  Cuaron gets there  by staying true to the characters and letting them make all the mistakes of young age in order to get to maturity and even a bit of wisdom. This film is a great find. If you're the type of person who is more squeamish about sex than gun violence, which seems to be the priority of conservative prudishness in this country, then forget it, don't see this, it's not for you.",1388016000,6,1587,4.766423357664234

On this level, there was nothing special about it. Just below the surface, however, it was a little more interesting. Luisa quickly comes to understand who they are and what they really want though the two young men never quite come to terms with it themselves. Beneath that was an undercurrent that life is fleeting and no matter your status or station we are all subject to the random unfairness of life and the inevitability of death. Thus, I believe it is trying to say that in order to enjoy life, one must be true to oneself. I can find no fault with that philosophy, except that the balance between one's own needs must be measured with those of your loved ones.

He tells us things about the characters that they don't know about each other, for instance that Tenoch always lifts the toilet seat with his foot at Julio's house, and Julio will never know this.

As their car passes a cross beside the road, the narrator says ""If they had passed this spot fifteen years ago, they would have seen a few chickens. If they had passed it five years ago, they would have seen an overturned truck, many bloody chickens, two dead bodies, and a women wailing inconsolably.""

All I can say about it is that while I do see what so many people like in it, it just wasn't the type of film I usually like to watch.

Y tu Mama Tambien follows two young friends as they take the road trip of a lifetime with the wife of a relative of one of the boys. As they travel they discover much about themselves, their perceptions of each other & themselves, as well as things they'd been keeping secret from each other.

I wanted to like this film, but it just came across as a little dull to me. I did like the subtle messages in the film, but in the end this was just a bit of a chore to get through. The sex scenes didn't bother me all that much, as they were essential to the plot as well as to the character development of everyone in the film. I did like the acting in the film & I'm interested to see what else these three have been in- they definitely have a way of capturing emotions, especially the understated one.

1446328,5,B00005JL57,"One of those movies that have grown on me a considerable amount over the years, `Y tu Mama Tambien' was initially, in my eyes, a glorified soap opera.  I didn't really see the deeper things as flesh was flashed across nearly every scene in gratuitous amounts and love was tossed out the window for seemingly shallow aspects of lust.  I watched, stunned in more ways than one, and simply shrugged it off as just another exploitive film toted as art.

I'm so glad that my libido forced me to watch this movie a few more times.

The story of young Tenoch and Julio may seem one-dimensional and rather obvious.  They are nave and inexperienced young men who just lost their girlfriend's to school and thus have to embark of exploring their sensuality in other ways.  Enter Luisa, a much older (eleven years) woman who is going through her own set of self-discovery inducing life-altering situations.  She agrees to accompany the two desperate teens on their trek to a supposed beautiful beach, but it's apparent that their intentions are far more than just a nice swim.

Well, there will be swimming, but it's not ocean water they are bathing in.

What may come across as nothing more than a series of perverse sequences with no real merit is actually a deeply rewarding look at the need to express oneself without losing sight of the person we are aching to become.  These two young men are finally finding themselves, but not in the way in which they expect.  What appears to be nothing more than a careless romp turns into a truly remarkable adventure that opens their eyes to who they are destined to become.  The final scene (and by final I mean FINAL) is really what this film is all about; moving on from but never forgetting the events that have shaped your inner person.  Luisa, a woman full of vibrancy despite her emotionally crippling circumstances, is blossoming in her later years thanks to this bout of carelessness.

So maybe that is the point; that every once in a while we need to just let go in order to find our personal balance.

For me, the acting in this film is mostly superb.  The two young men, Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal, are fantastic.  They really capture the awkward spontaneity that comes from adolescence, the insecurity that corrupts our best intentions.  I love the way they fumble through their self confidence, as if their bravado is merely a mask for the fact that they are just as lost as everyone else; maybe even more so.  My qualms with the acting can be found in Maribel Verdu, who was one of the major reasons I initially read `soap opera' when watching this film.  Her actions can at times feel forced and contrived and clichd.  Both Bernal and Luna understood the naturalism of their characters, and I don't think that Verdu really mastered that.

But I am in the minority with that conclusion.

In the end I urge you to look at this film through a different set of eyes.  It is easy to get caught up in the intense bluntness of the scenes (I did) and forgo the actual message being delivered to us here.  Don't make the mistake of writing this one off.",1258070400,3,3101,4.564195298372513

This movie (unrated version) feels like a book in its seamless journey of 2 best friends and the object of their desires, whom along the way helps them become men and experience life. You don't see coming of age movies like this in America, with its political and social motifs that beg to be involved but are just treated as typical rural life scenery. And probably not as advertised, not a movie for the prudish. Overall a cleverly put together script and film full of life, mystery, tension, love, hate, and humor. Despite being a very good movie, I would only watch this movie again in the near future as film study (there is a lot happening sub-textually).

I just kept waiting for a point when I could feel something for the characters, but it never came. I didn't just dislike them, they flat-out irritated me. Not only were the characters exploitive and undeveloped, there wasn't much interesting about this film at all. Near the beginning, the two best friends masturbate together while talking about the wife of one of their cousins. I almost stopped it right then, but made the mistake of wasting more of my time. It basically was softcore porn, but worst because it was supposed to be a serious movie. This whole story was about sex and cheating, and not giving much forethought to either of these things. It tried to make it seem like it had a lot more going for it, but failed miserably.

1446332,5,B00005JL57,"Y Tu Mam&aacute; Tambi&eacute;n is visually quite different from most Hollywood movies and looks more like the independent film it is.  Each viewing reveals still more details and subtle nuances; the hallmark of a good movie.  It likewise touches on subjects that may be too taboo for American audiences, such as the frank depiction of the sexuality of Julio and Tenoch, the two male leads in the movie.  Virtually no American movie would dare to show two men simultaneously engaging in masturbation.  But in doing so the film explores the fluidity of sexual attraction, friendships, and human nature.  The film is equally frank in discussing how each of the two male leads have both slept with the other's girlfriend, although you may see that in American films.

One of the more interesting aspects are the film's nuances and cultural differences and if you are not familiar with Mexican history or culture you may not get the pun in the one character's name, Tenoch Iturbide.  Early in the film, he explains that his upper class parents named him Tenoch after the Aztec leader, in an effort to connect him to his Aztec heritage.  Yet his surname is oddly enough that of yet another Mexican ruler, the short-lived first Emperor of Mexican, Augst&iacute;n I.  Clearly this was intentional by director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, using the pompously named character to mock the wealthy white elites.  The film takes place just as the PRI, Mexico's dominant political party, is starting to lose its grip on power.  Both boys enjoy a life of privilege that most Mexicans do not, and their ambitions and goals show they ware not that different from most American teenaged boys.

The two boys meet Luisa, the wife of Tenoch's cousin, at a weeding, and wind up concocting a tale of an unspoiled beach they want to visit over the summer, and they invite Luisa to join them.  She declines, but a few days she calls back to say she wants to join them, and the three set off in a battered old station wagon.  I died laughing as the station wagon was a dead ringer for an old Plymouth Volar&eacute; I had owned twenty years ago after college.  It was an old car then and certainly quite old by the time this movie was made, and certainly not something reliable I would take on the road any distance.  Since the boys concocted this beach they literally and figuratively have no idea where they are going.  They stay at motels that most Americans would shun, and most Americans would never consider travel without making reservations in advance, let alone without knowing where they are going and what they would find there.  But the three are young and carefree, pointing out the difference in various cultures.  They think nothing of sharing hotel rooms and are nonplussed by the poverty they see around them on the way to the coast.

While staying at a motel, the sexual tensions between the three come to a head.  The depictions and descriptions of sexual acts here are very straightforward, and it is clear that none of the three are being faithful to any of their partners, be it husbands or girlfriends.  Again, this isn't per se shocking or unheard of in American movies, but the fluidity of morals here would be a bit surprising for American viewers as it's quite a cultural difference from our own norms.  The complications become myriad and overlapping in a way that is only hinted at in most American films.  In the end we learn why Luisa chose to join the boys on their quest, and it's a touching and poignant message about living life to the fullest in spite of conventions or societal norms.  Y Tu Mam&aacute; Tambi&eacute;n is not a movie for those easily offended or who are not sensitive to cultural differences.  If you speak Spanish you pick on a lot more of the dialog that is especially witty and well written.  For me it's an interesting insight into Mexican culture and society.",1246492800,3,3885,4.725519287833828
1446333,3,B00005JL57,"I love Mexico and have spent time at some of the beaches that are shown here...so I really enjoyed seeing the country and its people.  The story is fun to see unfold; it felt very real to me.

I think that the reason I didn't give it five stars was that there was sooo much gratutitous adolescent boy sex that I was glad when it ended.  Perhaps because I am a female, I'm just not as amused or entranced by it. It was well done and funny at times...just so much of the film was about sex--doing it, talking about it, doing it with oneself, doing it with the girlfriend, doing it with the older woman, doing it with each other (the two boys) fighting about it and then more talking about it! It would be interesting to count the number of minutes that sex is being shown or talked about... and see what percentage of the film this takes up.  I think the story, which was lovely in many ways, could have been equally touching without soooo much graphic sex.  I once had a boyfriend from Mexico City who was not much older than these kids and while he did like sex, there was a lot more than that to our relationship; he talked about lots of things besides ""doing it.""

The two actors who play the kids are both quite good.  I wasn't crazy about the woman who played Luisa.  She was not beautiful or particularly charming.  She had a terrific body--so again, this movie might be more appreciated by men than women.  The ending was telegraphed from early on so it didn't come as much of a surprise.

I found the voice-over overly ponderous...a man in a grave voice giving social and political commentary....as if to upgrade what could have been an unpretentious but fun adolescent boy movie to an art film.  I think the director wasn't sure what kind of a film he wanted to make and this is what came out.  Still, there are some nice moments that make it worth seeing.",1243987200,5,1864,4.337175792507205
1446334,2,B00005JL57,"It was an entertaining movie. I was tense during the movie, expecting some horrible event while they were traveling by car to remote places. I must say I was happy that nothing bad happened. The armed police or guerilla-like people on the road side made me unueasy.

It is definetely not a ""must see movie.""",1236038400,,307,4.581818181818182
1446396,5,B00005JL57,"I see ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" as so outrageously and unremittingly libidinous as to put it outside the realm of a routine ""road movie"" or ""coming-of-age"" movie.

Most coming of age movies (""Summer of '42,"" ""The Last Picture Show"") tend to show a slightly older woman showing a youngster the ropes.

""Y Tu Mama Tabien"" has randy teenagers, yes, but they not shy and repressed by any stretch. Julio and Tenoch are spectacularly frank and uninhibited with the slightly older, unhappily married woman who agrees to drive with them to find the lyrical, possibly apocryphal beach known as ""Heaven's Mouth.""

To me, this film tells us something about sexual geography. The girls and boys in Mexico city rut spectacularly and can squeeze in a 30-second quickie, beginning to end, before their parents come in the room to check on them. They have an open pre-occupation with sex and a partner tally that eclipses even that of the United States.

Still, notions of propriety apply to other liaisons. ** SPOILER ALERT ** As is often the case, more exotic sexual encounters -- with mature women, with each other homosexually -- require the boys to leave their everyday world and depart for the liminal, alternative reality offered by travel. And for their female companion, ** SPOILER ALERT AGAIN ** Louisa, she acts on her most primitive impulses to have sex with the youths only when the inhibitions against such behavior are removed by several factors: travel to a place where she is a stranger, anger at her husband's infidelity and knowledge that she has a terminal illness.

In other words, despite the freewheeling atmosphere depicted in Mexico City, the social constraints against women such as Louisa carrying on with Julio and Tenoche are incredibly powerful, such that only her impending mortality outweighs the risk of being viewed as a slut.

The traveler will also note ruefully the beauty of wonderfully named, replete with meaning ""Heaven's Mouth"" locale and that it is symbolically destroyed by pigs who invade the boys' campsite and plans for a large hotel development that will put the local fisherman who offers side trips out of business. Hopefully the actual location shown can avoid this fate.",1233273600,,2200,4.9809264305177114

The rated 'R' version still includes lots of raunchy sex, but leaves out the most important 5 seconds in the entire film - a kiss between the two main male characters. This homoerotic tension coming out is just about the entire darn point of the film, and the rated 'R' version was compelled to leave it out.

Yes, the original film is erotic and confronting; the American R certificate version leaves much of the nudity but deletes some crucial footage. For example, in the climactic scene at the beach once the long journey is over, the kiss between Julio and Tenoch ends up on the cutting room floor!

1446401,1,B00005JL57,"Y Tu is basically a teenage `road' picture by Alfonso Cuarn, the director whose biggest previous film was the odd update of Great Expectations, with Gwyneth Paltrow, in the late 1990s. The film is about 2 Mexico City teens, Tenoch (Diego Luna) & Julio (Gael Bernal) who hook up with the cuckolded wife of Tenoch's cousin Jano, Luisa (Maribel Verd). Basically, the 2 horny boys' girlfriends leave for Europe for the summer and after Luisa's husband confesses his infidelity she begs to go on a road trip with the boys, who are eager to take the 28 year old sexpot away to a mythic beach they have told her about.
  The friends both end up screwing Luisa, then inflicting pain on each other by professing to have screwed each other's girlfriend. Luisa is about to leave them both when they promise they will do things her way. They stumble upon a beach, have some adventures, then get drunk one night with Luisa, are prepared to engage in a threesome, until Luisa simultaneously takes both of them in her mouth. This penile congress leads the two boys to a night of homosexuality without Luisa's presence. The next day one vomits over his debauchery, they leave Luisa at the beach, return to Mexico City, and part. 2 years later they meet at a caf one last time, discuss the fact that Luisa died of cancer a month after their road trip, and never see each other again- Tenoch heading toward a life in the upper crust, while Julio goes off to community college.... I do get tired of critics who seem rapt by foreign films that mine the same material that Hollywood tripe does, with just as little success, yet somehow draw raves. Here's the only cogent piece of advice the film imparts, and its aimed only at the Tenoch-Julio demographic: Do not whack off too much or you will diminish your sexual continence. Thankfully I learnt that lesson before watching this film.",1222128000,15,1865,4.6314199395770395

My favorite line in the movie is when Louisa tells the boys ""You have to make the clitoris your best friend"". I saw that in a magazine once as one of the sexiest movie lines of all time. The music is also very good. I'm thinking about buying the soundtrack. If you can't decide whether or not to get it, you should. It's a good, fun road trip movie. It's real. It's sexy.

1446403,4,B00005JL57,"Y Tu Mama Tambien isn't really all that deep.  However, it's a great movie because it displays that male-bonding and behavior transcends culture.  An inside look at young males between 16 and 24 in Mexico is the same as young men in the USA.  Fart jokes, going to parties, drugs, making smart-alec remarks, hitting on women, and an insatiable sexual apetite (satisfied through perpetual masturbation in this movie) dominate life.  Although, the open homoeroticism doesn't seem to translate as well - which probably has more to do with Europe's relaxed sexual nature.

Tenoch and Julio are wild-living best friends who are intent on doing as much drugs and having as much sex as possible.  During a summer in which their girlfriends travel abroad to Italy, they set out to add an impressive notch to their belt: an older woman, and a possible menage a tois.

They meet up with Luisa, the Spanish wife of Tenoch's yuppie cousin, and because of marital infidelity, Luisa is seeking a little revenge.

In no time at all, the three are talking about sex and the tension is building.  Before long Tenoch sleeps with Luisa - less than a minute, if you're wondering - and the love triangle unfolds.  Soon enough after that, Luisa and Julio get it on - also less than a minute - and the jealousy reigns supreme.  It is because of this jealousy that each makes a startling confession: each one has had sex with the other's girlfriend.  After that confession it gets a little wierder.

Great movie, crazy sexual tension, incredible character development...a movie I highly recommend.",1205712000,5,1572,4.842696629213483

A couple of small points of dissent, however.  I found the extremely long takes to be disturbing (think Hitchcock's ""Rope""), and by the middle of the long takes I was struggling to see any minor flubs.

Winning 33 awards at film festivals throughout the world, this film was actually nominated for an Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay at the 2003 Academy Awards.

Y Tu Mama Tambien is layered in an irreverent bubble-gum euphoria with a cast that is 100% committed and convincing, giving the whole trip a tingling authenticity. Yet its underlying theme is the ephemeral nature of the drama we create in our lives, in this case over sex and relationships; the fun yet the actual shallowness of friendships; and the ultimate randomness and futility of it all. So, it is a rush of a movie.. first the surprising treatment of the frequent sex scenes that one could label soft porn yet is reluctant to do so because they are so appropriate and germaine to the story; then the hilarity of the road trip set up ahead of the disintegration of the happy trio's relationship under the pressure of sexual politics; and finally the melancholic ending which even though bleak, is not black because it is lightened by what went before.",1182124800,4,1044,4.643243243243243

Well, all that is true but that is really just scratching the surface.  It's about friendship, coming to terms with who you are, the ties that bind us together, how people come and go out of our lives, class differences, what it means to be Mexican and perhaps more than anything, death. I think ultimately, that's what Y Tu Mama Tambien is ultimately about.  However, it doesn't dwell on it, instead it offers death as an inevitable fact of life and in a sense celebrates it - without death, or at least the knowledge of it, we aren't truly alive.

The story is simple but excellent, I'm sure you know the gist of it so I won't get into it.  What I really liked is that there is virtually no exposition in this film - characters do things for reasons that the viewer just has to go with but eventually their motivations will all begin to make sense.

All the actors are superb, particularly the three main leads Diego Luna, Gael Garcia Bernal and Maribel Verdu.  The three of them have a chemistry between them that is both natural and magnetic.

From a technical aspect, the film is superb.  Cuaron is a superb director - he uses his settings perfectly and uses it as a means of transformation.  The urban jungle of Mexico City makes way to civilization mixing with nature on the Mexican highway, to finally the breathtaking oceanside beauty of ""Heaven's Mouth"".  As well, Cuaron favors long, uninterrupted takes and prefers to set his camera back and let things unfold naturally.  Both of these create a unique and pleasurable viewing experience.

1446534,5,B00005JL57,"The coupling of sex and death is ancient.  Y Tu Mama Tambien is a modern treatment of this theme.  Two seventeen year old boys go on a road trip with a twenty-eight year old woman who is beautiful and who is dying.  The boys don't know about her illness, however, and see the trip as an opportunity to further their sexual experience.  They act as most seventeen year old boys do.  They brag about their sexual exploits and their ability to please their girlfriends.  Their dying companion takes it upon herself to teach the boys what women really want.  Underneath this, though, is her fascination with the boys' youth and exuberance. Their bodies are strong and responsive, if a bit jittery and hard to control. Their energy is in stark contrast to her own, which must wane as her illness grows more severe.  The road trip is replete with references to death.  Even as the sexual adventure progresses, the boys' relationship with each other is also explored.  One is rich, the other of a lower class.  The boys have devised all sorts of chivalric rules to live by, yet the rules are broken.  Not only do they sleep with each other's girlfriends, they relate to each other on the basis of social status more than they are willing to admit.  The movie shows this in many ways, not the least of which is the way each acts when he visits the other's bathroom.  This is a coming of age film which is not corny and which doesn't hide the more black elements of growing up and losing one's innocence. Yes, there is a lot of nudity, but the nudity is not exploitive or (...).  It is natural and, I would argue, necessary to the film.",1181260800,4,1627,4.467796610169492
1446535,4,B00005JL57,"Y Tu Mam Tambin is a road picture, but it is more than that. It's summer in Mexico and teenage best friends Julio (Gael Garca Bernal) and Tenoch (Diego Luna) are bored. One is rich, and the other middle class. They are friends for now, but perhaps their class differences will tear their friendship apart eventually. But for now, they decide to take a road trip with a beautiful older woman, Luisa (Maribel Verd). She has learned of her husband's infidelity, and so she accepts their invitation.

They live for the moment, and are oblivious to the politics and social conditions of those less fortunate, but the movie still manages to bring in the social and political commentary, without losing the summertime feel good movie vibe. As the boys and their woman journey to the coast, the Federales are rounding up the peasants, and the audience sees it, but the boys live only for the moment and are oblivious to it all.

Less successful is the hidden gay agenda, which seems to be more the director's wish fulfillment, and surfaces near the end. Hey, you tricked us. I thought this movie was about our own wish fulfillment of the fantasy of being young and spending the summer traveling to the beach with an experienced and sexy woman. That part seems kind of tacked on, and tacky.

One agenda that is not hidden, and that shouldn't be, is the energy and vitality of Mexico. It is a raw, wild place, but really alive, really passionate and compelling.

I found it amazing that two young males could masturbate together, talking about women, turning each other on, so distant, yet so close. The main female character acts as a mentor two our young men. By the end of the film, you get the impression that the two main male characters could easily expand their relationship from friends to lovers. Each genuinely cares for the other. Also, you get a glimpse of life in another country, Mexico. This story is about growing up and in the process learning that something must be lost in order for growth to occur. Is it a loss of innocence? From my perspective, I use the following metaphor. It's as if these three characters are living in a darknened room and someone turns on a light. There is something sad in that experience. Knowing you are now more aware, but the truth is that you are free.

1446541,5,B00005JL57,"A translation of the title of this movie into English would yield something like ""And Your Mother Too,"" which would echo a phrase often used in so-called ""mother talk"" or ""wolfing.""  (If you're gonna wolf, you better wolf fast/ 'cause your old lady's got a face like a bulldog's Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies...)

Having been brought up in the United States and having attended the public schools I am no stranger to the phenomenon of teenaged boys being teenaged boys, having been there and done that myself, including the hazy, sunny obligatory motor trip to Tijuana and points south.  But what struck me while watching this fascinating film was how very like the guys I went to school with are Tenoch and Julio.  In fact I was a little reminded of the song ""Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard"" by Paul Simon.  Not much would have to be changed to see this as an American movie about young people in America near the end of the 20th century.

But this is about Mexico and it takes place in Mexico and even though Julio and Tenoch rag on ""Team America"" there is no doubt that their lives and the styles they copy and take as their own are enormously influenced by American culture, for better or for worse.

Gael Garcia Bernal who previously starred in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Amores perros (2000) plays Julio, who is from a middle class family.  Diego Luna plays his friend Tenoch (named after Tenochtitlan, Aztec founder of Mexico City) who is the son of a prominent Mexican politician.  Both boys live the kind of lives of plenty and privilege that the average Mexican can only dream about.  And so there is a certain decadent and hedonistic quality to the way they embrace life.  But what director Alfonso Cuaron captures with these boys and their adventure to an imaginary beach with an older woman is the zest of youth that throws itself wildly and madly into sex, drugs and the search for experience and the fulfillment of youthful urges.  What they learn from Luisa (Maribel Verdu) is something most young men really lust after, that is, how to please a woman sexually--well, at least they experience a first course.

Cuaron shows us teenaged boys as teenaged boys are: raunchy, randy, irreverent, and as a old army sergeant used to say, ""young and dumb and full of..."" you-know-what.  Well, not dumb.  Both boys are sharp and quick to learn about life, and as the movie ends and they go their separate ways, we know that both will go on to college and make a good life for themselves.  In this sense this is a coming of age movie with Lusia as mentor to the boys.

Looking at the movie a little more deeply we have to ask, why does Lusia go on the trip with Tenoch and Julio, and why does she let herself go, so to speak?  We learn that her husband has cheated on her (again, by the way) and had the temerity to call her up immediately after the fact and confess.  Later we learn that she has an even more compelling reason to indulge herself in a youthful fling.  (But of course you should see the movie to find out what that is.)

The sense of freedom and naturalness that Cuaron captures, not only in the area of human sexuality, but in the spirit of a vast country moving from a largely agrarian society to an industrial one, and the bewilderment that such rapid change makes people feel, is made especially vivid by the focus on the young, since they are the ones moving the fastest.  (Of course this focus doesn't hurt at the box office, since young people make up the bulk of viewers, in Mexico as elsewhere.)  However, despite what some reviewers have suggested, this movie addresses Mexican poverty in only a token way.  This is a movie about privileged Mexicans who could, as I intimated above, pass for Americans or Europeans with only a minor cultural shift.

Be forewarned that the sexuality shown here is about as graphic as any you'll see this side of an X rating, which is okay with me.  Certainly it is better than the usual violence that Hollywood serves up.  In fact I hope this movie triggers a change in the movie industry away from the belief that you have to titillate the mass audience with violence in order to be successful.  Sex will do just fine.

Bottom line: a vital, vivid romp that will delight especially the young.  Clearly this is not a movie for prudes or social conservatives--and that's an understatement!",1169078400,10,4376,4.544642857142857
1446542,3,B00005JL57,This movie is a sensual virtual trip of Mexico.  For many people this is about as close as they will get to experiencing the total beauty of Mexico without actually going there.  It is also a glimpse into the lives of young Mexicans couping with modern conversions.  This movie is a must for the adventurious who do not mind seeing the edge of society.,1167782400,4,352,4.46875
1446609,5,B00005JL57,"""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" is a bold, fantastic movie by one of today's most innovative directors, Alfonso Cuaron. Although he is well-known for such efforts as ""The Little Princess"" or the fantastic ""Great Expectations"", ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" is his signature piece-of-art, which directly influenced the Warner Bros. corporation to give him the third Harry Potter movie to direct. Why? Seems like Mr. Cuaron knows teenagers.

And he does, which is proven by this movie. ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" is about two teenage boys that are very sexual, and use sex as a ticket to their manhood. However, they are about to go on a road trip with a much older woman which is going to change their friendship, their lives and their viewpoints on life forever. It is one of those movies that can be understood on many levels - from a coming-of-age story to a softcore porno, if you will. However, there are so many themes this movie hides under the surface, it is almost claustrophobic. The exciting shots of these kids road tripping are connected with the lowest social class of Mexico and it forms a great contrast.

Yes, this movie has a lot of sexual content, full nudity and some very explicit sexual scenes. However, it helps create the reality of teenagers, their fears and their excitement. For a teenage boy, there is only one thing in the world to think about, and that is, undoubtedly, sex. All the scenes in these movies are shot in one long take, which showcases the incredible talent of these, almost incognito, actors. The camera and the direction is always top-notch, capturing contrasts in moods, colors and lifestyles.

If you like this movie (and chances are, you will), check out some other movies that deal with kids and their discoveries of everything life has to offer, try Fellini's ""Amarcord""or Tornatore's ""Malena"", with Monica Belucci in the role of her career. Seems like foreign movies deal with the issues of growing up and grasping reality better than the American ones, and if that is the case, ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" is a good place to start.",1167696000,4,2045,4.754929577464789
1446610,4,B00005JL57,"A compelling and unique coming of age story revolving around two best friends and an older woman, `Y Tu Mama Tambien' (`And Your Mother Too') definitely has its high points.  With perfectly natural and poised performances by the two male leads (at times Maribel Verdu's crying fits can border on the Soap Opera side), this film breaks itself away from the generic teen sex film and becomes something so much more.

Tenoch (Diego Luna) and Julio (Gael Garcia Bernal) have just kissed their girlfriends (Maria Aura & Ana Lopez Mercado) goodbye and are now left alone and bored with nothing and no one to do.  That is until they meet Luisa (Maribel Verdu), the seductive wife of Tenoch's cousin Jano (Juan Carlos Remolina).  The boys are immediately smitten and wish to pursue her, but she is in fact a married woman, and Jano is a very possessive husband.  After Jano admits his infidelity Luisa leaves him to accompany these two boys on a road trip to a beach called `Heaven's Mouth', a beach the two boys aren't even sure exists.

In the process the three of them become entangled in a strange love triangle where Tenoch gets with Luisa, Luisa gets with Julio, and in the end it looks like Julio gets with Tenoch.  More than just nudity and sex, `Y Tu Mama Tambien' cleverly attacks the human relationship, showing that even the strongest ties have their frailties, have their weaknesses and ultimately have their breaking points.  Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal are excellent here, truly in the moment and natural in every one of their scenes, and while Maribel is not someone I'd even call remotely pretty she does attach enough impish sexuality to her character that you can understand how these two boys would become attracted to her.

The script itself is wonderfully crafted, and of course the acting and beautiful locations add to its grandeur.  This film may not be one of your favorites, but it is truly a unique and original masterpiece of modern cinema that will be remembered if enough people give it the time of day.",1165968000,5,2032,4.730878186968838
1446611,4,B00005JL57,"Y tu Mama Tambien has much to recommend it. The overall plot is an old one, or at least seems as if it has been done before - two teenage boys, left by their girlfriends for a summer, take a road trip with sexy older woman who teaches them a few life tricks - but this is no normal road trip movie. Tenoch and Julio are superb characters that encapsulate so much of the condition of contemporary Latin American youth. They are bold, handsome and cocky, think they are sexual masters but the reality leaves much to be desired, and have a package of passion including a keen awareness of the bonds of friendship and a hatred of the US that rings so true. They undergo a bildungsroman experience following an exuberant attempt to chat up Luisa, the sexy wife of Jano, Tenoch's intellectually and socially snobbish cousin, at a wedding. Luisa agrees to go with them on a shabbily planned road trip to a fictional beach destination. What Tenoch and Julio do not know, and cannot know as they haven't yet undergone the pains of human existence as people become adults in the world, is how much Luisa is suffering. To them, she is a hot chick, a fun older woman who seems to like them, and responds to their immature adolescent stag rutting behaviour. But Luisa is a disturbed, pained soul. She plays to the boys' whims, culminating in two brief, sweaty sexual encounters. But these do not satisfy her. The true extent or her problems are not revealed until right at the end of the movie, in a surprising and moving addendum.

The backdrop of middle class Mexican lust and sweaty sex on the road is the real countryside of Mexico. The trio pass through tin villages, with peasant people and their old customs, like crowning the village queen, and flogging trinkets with supposed spiritual value to passers by. These scenes, whilst admittedly not quite fully integrated into the plot of the movie, present a poignant indication of the true state of affairs in Mexico, behind the pulsating sex and passionate bombast of the young and (relatively) wealthy.

Y tu Mama Tambien is at once a funny, true, and sad movie, and worthy of its widespread acclaim.",1163203200,4,2144,4.639473684210526
1446612,5,B00005JL57,"On the surface of Y Tu Mama Tambien, we are presented with a frolicking road trip movie that is laden with an unusual amount (by U.S. standards) of unapologetic sexuality.  Beneath that veneer lays a beautiful coming of age story.  Even if it is taken for nothing beyond these aspects, the work provides good entertainment and an inspiring story.

But, the reason this film moves me is found in a much deeper layer - one that gives those apparent, dime-a-dozen plot devices a reason to exist. Y Tu Mama Tambien has something (or, rather, a great many somethings) to say, and it says them beautifully.  It's about loyalty, honesty, economic divide, problems in sexuality, societal pressures, repressed emotions, love vs. lust, etc., etc., etc.

It's a contemplation of a point in a few individuals' lives where they are confronted with possibilities that could drastically alter the course of the rest of their lives, and how their lives were changed regardless of the fact that they ran from those possibilities.  It's also a depiction of how we have to make decisions that effect the welfare of the people we come in contact with, and how the best decision may hurt both the decider and the person by whom they are hoping to do right.

In a nutshell, it's about life - the dilemmas we are all faced with, the pain and joy that both inevitably result from virtually every decision we make, and the impossibility of controlling the complex experience that comes between birth and death.

Y Tu Mama Tambien is beautifully written, directed, acted, and filmed.",1163116800,4,1557,4.827067669172933

1446615,3,B00005JL57,"When it was announced that Alfonso Cuaron was hired to direct the 3rd installment of Harry Potter, Prizoner of Azkaban, there was considerable controversy and this was the film that brought it. When people learned that Cuaron had directed this film which has language and plenty of sexual situations and talk, many were arguing whether he was the right guy. Sure enough he was and people forgot about this film. Now I wouldn't say this was a terrible movie, but it's one of those that after you watch it, you kind of go ""oooookay, that was interesting"".

The first scene sets the stage: a teenage couple has sex while talking about not cheating when they go on their respective trips, meanwhile right afterwards another couple has sex as well. The men in both couples, Tenoch and Julio, meet Luisa, an older woman and the men agree to take her on a road trip. Really the whole purpose of the trip is to try to sleep with her but pretty soon the trip brings things to the surface that they weren't exactly expecting, or for Luisa either.

Since it's the most visible aspect of the film, I should address it: the sex. While it's not sexually explicit, it's a bit more risque than many films that you've probably seen. Full male and female frontal nudity as well as several realistic looking sex scenes will be on hand when you watch. Does it say anything about sex? Well, if you look for it anyway. It doesn't outright say it but there is a message that you can take different ways. One thing I did like in the film though is the narrator would do a couple of scenes looking at the past or future of certain events such as a crash. It ties into what the men aren't experiencing which is everything that's not about sex. From poor living conditions to connections, they're completely unaware and the narrator points some out.

Like many foreign films I've seen over the years, it's not exactly something you'll watch over and over(only exceptions so far have been Amelie and Crouching Tiger). Most people(mainly men) will watch it for the sex while the rest will try to see if there's a good movie underneath. Kinda, but don't think this is one of the best things you'll see.",1161302400,4,2172,4.549872122762149

1446617,4,B00005JL57,"It's a ""relationships"" movie, but about an utterly un-chicky relationship. It's about Tenoch and Julio, two boys at the end of their teens, right when their balls-to-brains ratio is at its worst. They cycle between extremes of bragodoccio, bone-deep uncertainty, and chemically altered states of mind, swirling in riptides of testosterone.

Then Julia sails into this maelstrom, or male-storm. Her mood is stormy, as well, and makes even deeper waves between the two friends as they sail off for a week at Heaven's Beach. Nearly 30 and newly jilted, she has fantasies at least as compelling as the boys'. Ironically, realization of one of her fantasies divides the two friends forever by joining them just too closely. Then, their three-way week alone at Heaven's Beach ends. The boys return uneasily to their ""real world,"" and Julia stays behind in Heaven.

But don't think you've really understood Julia until the very end. A moment in the last scene changes the meaning of everything that went before. Maybe not for Tenoch and Julio, but for Julia - and then, maybe for them too.

1446668,4,B00005JL57,"This film is actually one of the best explorations of the adolescent male mind on film. I am sure you know the story by now, two best friends, Julio (the poor boy)played by Gael Garcia Bernal and Tenoch (the rich priviledged boy) played by Diego Luna, are off on an adventure of learning life's subtle and stabbing lessons. They are joined by Tenoch's cousin by marriage, Luisa, who is 28 and thus 11 years older than the boys.

The film is painfully realistic regarding the hormone driven consciousness of adolescent males and females, exploring sexuality and drugs at a break-neck rate. How amazingly fast young men and women learn a vast range of sexual experiences and methods to get high. But this film takes this experience further, for sexual gymnastics and broken taboos take place within the context of relationship for most lucky human beings. And thus these boys learn to move from wide-eyed lust and masturbation images to the very real pain of jealousy and erotic visualization of the betrayal of the beloved. Competition and jealousy begin to unravel this idylic childhood friendship.

The young men frequently complain about 'fags' yet in the end Luisa is able to help them break many pre-ordained mental constructs and the power of sensuality brings all three together for intercourse.

As their eyes are opened to the destructive nature of erotic jealousy they remain blind to issues of social class and political repression. They pass through military roadblocks and see peasants arrested and living in poverty, yet they continue to talk about oral sex and sexual positions while a world of repression passes them by. In this regard the film is 100% accurate regarding adolescent male thought and pre-occupation.

There are moments of perfect humor, ofr example the speed with which both young men come to orgasm with Luisa, and the all knowing and patient look on her face as they experience orgasm.

The character of Luisa is also perfectly performed by Maribel Verdu, a young women who accepts her diagnosis of cancer and her husband's chronic adultery as the spring-boards for this adventure with two young men.

In the end, this film is about the growing knowledge and experience that human relationships are fragile, an incredible lesson that should be learned on the way to maturity.",1145750400,7,2308,4.997395833333333

1446671,5,B00005JL57,"I can't get over how so many reviewers missed the mark on this erotic, honest film.  But let me go back.  I have seen some of the latest Spanish films (Sex and Lucinda is great), which are hot all right, but this one, Y Tu Mama Tarnbien finally pushes the envelope to the realm of pornography.  Sure it's artistic, so it's not pornography.  It's actors getting naked and excited, so it is pornography; well, it certainly aroused.  I heard it was a good flick, but was sure glad my kids weren't around.  Why did she do that to those young boys, daddy?

Back in the Seventies, Deep Throat made porn films popular and the early porn directors actually thought they would merge their product into a respectable Hollywood studio.  That never happened.  Those who viewed the documentary Inside Deep Throat understand what I mean.  T Yu seems to bring sensuality and Hollywood entertainment full circle.  Naked bodies doing naked body stuff during a Mexican, On the Road buddy and older chick flick, well who'da thought?

I think the Mexican poor are romanticized somewhat by Cuaron.  They are shown to be sweet, suffering people with the thumb of the Federales everywhere. The Spanish Chick goes country with the natives finally, but the boys are bourgeois after all, and they end up going to college taking economics, which early in the film they swore they would never do.  That's not the only thing these macho Latinos would like to forget.

It's hard to get excited about Paris Hilton or the latest Brad and Angelina venture when Spanish and Mexican directors are showing you body parts and a primer on what to do with the before mentioned unmentionables.",1141776000,6,1653,4.750877192982456

I see things said of this picture such as brilliant, realistic, an accurate portrayal of coming of age, etc.  Let me first say this: If you wish to NOT see graphic group male masturbation, please take my advice and avoid this movie.

If, on the other hand, you live in fantasy land and think all teenage boys smoke, drink, get high and do drugs virtually every day (as well as masturbate with buddies at the swimming pool), then perhaps this movie is an accurate depiction of your world or what you think the world of 18-year olds embodies.  Let me say this: take comfort in the fact that despite what many of these reviews say, most teenage boys do not behave in this manner.  As far as I'm concerned I was no teenage angel, however I can aver that neither I nor anyone of my acquaintance either stayed stoned in one form or another 24/7, nor did they have casual sex with beautiful cousins (by marriage) with augmented breasts.

These comments aside, the movie was mildly entertaining.  Its inane storyline was cloaked in a pseudo-intellectual veil giving it a low-budget sleeper type of flare.  But  randomly interspersed social commentaries does not a masterpiece make.  I feel as if this film were American, it would receive more of an American Pie treatment from reviewers.

So like I said, it was somewhat entertaining, especially if you are fluent in Spanish, and I assume even moreso if you feel that the aforemetioned behavior is representative of young men.",1138665600,3,1555,4.7011070110701105

The boys are whirled in sex, jelousy, and trading dark secrets, that will change them for ever. It's a fascinating journey and the way any of the three leads interact with eachother is never phoney or uninteresting. You do learn something at the end that makes looking back at the movie even better.

This film is unrated obviously because the makers didn't want the dreaded NC-17 rating. It explores things American filmmakers are unable or unwilling to.

As others have said, it borders on soft porn. If this movie had been made in the U.S., it would have never received a major release, because there would have been outrage over several scenes (that I can think of), maybe more.

Those things aside, is it worth seeing this movie?

It's hard for me to say. It's not the type of movie I would see again. I don't know if I got anything out of it, except a distinct reminder of how tragic Mexico is. That a country as lushly beautiful as Mexico, with all the sun, sand and sea anyone could ever hope for, is a country filled with poverty, sadness and a frozen-in-time quality.

As for the story, it revolves around best friends, teenagers Julio and Tenoch (an unwashed, dirty, bad haircut Gael Garcia Bernal and a snot-nosed rich brat Diego Luna) and their summer saga of a wild car goose chase in search of what they think is a make-believe beach, Heaven's Mouth. They are joined at the last minute by an ""older woman"" Luisa (Maribel Verdu) who they met earlier at a party, where they discover she is married to Tenoch's cousin.

I suppose the boys' adventure qualifies for a ""coming-of-age"" story, based on the amount of sex that is had and the confrontations and realizations that occur, and I also suppose that one unique moment in this film (I certainly won't give that away here) makes it stand out from all other coming-of-age stories. Stand out, yes. Better? Not necessarily.

The boys themselves, although full of teen spunk and spirit, quickly bored and irritated me. They both were vulgar, self-centered SOBs, Tenoch much more than Julio, and they assumed the world was supposed to revolve around their whims. But I suppose in this way, the film was honest. Teen boys, desperate to have sex, cigarettes, drugs, desperate to be thought of as someone and something special, trying to prove they are better than one another... gee, I guess it's not just teen boys, is it? It's men -- something that Luisa comments on quite clearly in a brief tirade that most women will probably relate to.

As for Luisa, from the first moment we meet her, it would never occur to us that she would be this brazen sexual creature with a potty mouth. While I felt the actress did a great job, I also felt she was saying to herself, ""Jesus, is this what I have to do to earn a living?""

There were shocking moments that seemed totally real and others that seemed completely improvised. The thin plot is played out mostly in poverty-stricken Mexico, with the sounds of clucking chickens, snorting pigs, and other barnyard creatures floating through the soundtrack. You could almost smell the exhaust and the decay of the dusty roads this trio traveled on.

At any rate, Luisa's character may not make sense until the end, but even then, it doesn't strike me that she would necessarily have made the choices she did, but on the other hand, it may have occurred to her that it was the only choice she could possibly make.

There is also an omniscient narrator who constantly interrupts things and occasionally becomes irritating, but also has a slight Mary Alice/Desperate Housewives feeling in some of his dramatic observations, right down to some foolish pigs on the beach.

I guess, finally, I must recommend this film to adults only (as I just felt the sexuality was too strong to view for young people, even though that is what the movie is about). The movie may take you emotional places you are not ready to go and it may titillate you, falsely or shockingly, but there are one or two sad moments that seem quite powerful, as well as an incredibly powerful sexual moment that I certainly didn't see coming, and if you don't mind having your boat rocked for a while, you may possibly find this entertaining, if not disturbing.",1132358400,10,3973,4.669527896995708
1446735,4,B00005JL57,"There are many levels to this alluring film that may go unnoticed by the Non-Mexican viewer. I was impressed by the beauty of this film the first time I saw it, but my second viewing of it with friends from Mexico was more rewarding. There are interesting sociological aspects to the film given the contrasting rich and poor lifestyles of Tenoch and Julio, and other cultural nuances of the Mexican countryside's lifestyle.

The coming of age theme is one that may put people off as it can sometimes be associated with Hollywood's squeaky clean teen dramas that are packed full of cliches. However viewers can rest assured that 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' offers something far more inticing. What makes 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' so achingly real is the bumbling awkwardness with which these teenage boys try to impress Luisa, their older Spanish lady friend. These boys are certainly not lady's men and their womanising, just like their love making, lacks maturity.

Director Carlos Cuaron also takes a look at the difficulties that can develop in friendships, more specifically male friendships. The silent awkwardness and problems that remain unsaid keeps the relationship between Julio and Tenoch on edge for much of the film. Another interesting aspect of the writing is the form that the character development takes. We learn who the characters are simply by hanging out with them, mainly while they smoke joints in the back of the car.

'Y Tu Mama Tambien' is a beautiful and moving film which is by turns humourous, playful and poignant. It's relaxed ambling pace and varying moods will leave the viewer with a fresh outlook on life.",1127520000,15,1626,4.927007299270073

Another  thing: it is a foreign film. (Mexican) Another reason it may remain a small movie here,  the fact that the uncensored version is unrated.
  Two 17 year old boys, Julio & Tenoch say goodbye to their girlfriends for the summer. They are looking for something to do. At a  party they meet & are inspired by the impossibly sexy Luisa ,27 years old & the wife of Tenoch's cousin. They tell her of their road trip to find a mythical private beach. Her marriage is crumbling & she finally accepts their invitation to join them.
Their education begins. but not just sexual, she civilizes them, how a women should be treated, wants to be treated & not  merely a sex object. Their friendship is tested & they face some things they had not been aware of. Yes, there is nudity but it necessary to the story is not gratuitous.  Where early naked scenes were very funny these with Luisa are sensitive & tasteful.
An unseen narrator interupts from time to time to provide exposition & move the story right along. It is useful at the end. These are characters you care for & it explains what happens to them after & how everything changes.
  One tip: Please skip the tape from Blockbuster. Those prigs even censored the R version.

1446740,4,B00005JL57,"Alfonso Cuaron returns to the screen abandoning all those Victorian sensibilities from fairytales, to present us a contemporary coming-of -age-story.

At 28 years old, Luisa is tired from her life and decides to start over, after hearing some bad news. She accepts a rather unusual invitation from Julio and Tenoch, two teenagers whose friendship code is understood only by them and whose lives will take an unexpected turn around their hormones.

In a van called Betsabe, this threesome embarks on a road trip around rural Mexico through Boca del Cielo (Heaven's mouth), a place where sexuality, innocence and friendship will collide, while they endure a tragicomic transition through adulthood.

An off narrator makes references about the past and the future of the characters, as well as highlighting situations that try to explain the political and economical situations of Mexico

Y Tu Mam Tambin is a road movie that strongly contrast themes like friendship, sex and the lost of innocence. Playful, sarcastic, crude and tender, Cuaron's movie deals also with the convergence of situations and coincidence that defines people's lives.

Tenoch and Julio are great friends, but unconsciously, are also rivals competing for everything. The arrival of Luisa to their lives is the hardest test their friendship has to endure, because it reveals their immaturity and crushes their supposed trust in each other. Luisa is the catalyst for the boys to become men and they are the solution to help her break free from a life that was consuming her.

And it's precisely this experience together the thing that makes this group to find their way, although their friendship and lives are never again the way they were.",1122336000,4,1710,5.155234657039712

It is a thoroughly engaging adventure, leading you through some wonderfully remote countryside before finally coming to rest in an idyllic location.  There is plenty of coarse banter and sex to propel this movie, but there is more to the sweet looking cousin than meets the eye, the boys eventually learn.

* The two boys, Julio and Tenoch, are supposed to be the typical wild adolescents, racing through sex, alcohol, and drugs on their summer vacation.  They cuss and smirk.  We're supposed to feel good about them, but the fact is that they have very little redeeming qualities- not bad, exactly, but not good enough to make you sympathize with them, especially after finding out that they both slept with one another's girlfriend.

* Luisa is also shallowly characterized.  We can understand her actions- finding out her husband cheated on her, having a terminal disease- would make her take the actions she did, which have been characterized as stupid and pedophilic.  But we never get a handle on her, which is sad.

* Drugs are present in this film, which I don't mind occassionally, but jeez.

* No eroticism.  For a movie hailed as wildly erotic, I found it severely lacking.  Is it sexual?  Yes, although, if all the sex talk is taken out, there really are only three or four real sex scenes.  The sad thing is that there was incredible potential for it to be erotic.  The two boys joint masturbating on diving boards could have been hot, rather than simply smutty.  Both sex scenes with the boys were mechanical rather than hot.

1446792,5,B00005JL57,"There are two themes interwoven by this coming-of-age road trip picture:  The fates of its three main characters and the state of modern Mexico.  Picaresque and funny, it's a Mexican ""Huckleberry Finn"" with sex substituting for violence and an old car for a raft.

Julio and Tenoch are in a club--Astral Cowboys they call themselves--as offbeat as anything devised by Tom Sawyer.  They are 17 years old with all the mischief, shallowness, and prurience this often entails.  Their girlfriends leave for Italy, and they prepare to spend a summer marking time, preparing for a future that will gel in a few years.  Tenoch's wealthy father is urging him to study economics when the charismatic boy would prefer literature; Julio's more working class mother would probably be happy to see him gainfully employed.

Their bumming around includes weed-smoking, group sex, parties, dips in a country club pool (where they masturbate on the diving boards in a scene that recalls Fellini's ""Amacord""), horseplay, and conversation.  Things change at a more upscale party attended by the president of Mexico where they meet a 28 year old women whose marriage is crumbling.

She enjoys their clumsy come-ons and agrees to join them on a trip to a beautiful beach--Heaven's Mouth--which they made up as a sort of in-joke sexual pun.  The boys don't believe she'll actually call them, but she does.  In order to borrow his sister's car, Tenoch is forced to wade through a left-wing political parade, introducing the theme of turbulent Mexico into a film that had previously remained in the insular world of male adolescence.

Once the trio is on the road--to a beach that doesn't exist--Mexico goes by like a fever dream:  beautiful, colorful, hurt, empty.  Poverty and police presence on rural roads wake the boys up to a reality different from their own.

The adult male omniscient narrator/voiceover is more omniscient than most:  He sees the past and the future, speaking like the voice of God about the land and people before us in the film, telling secrets, telling the real story and counterpointing quite nicely the shallow exuberance of the boys in the car.  When he speaks, all else falls silent.

So we learn about accidents that took place on a curve in the road or a proud fisherman becoming a sad janitor.

Seeing Mexico as it really is is part of the boy's coming of age, but so is sexual discovery. They take their turn at clumsy sex with Luisa and wind up jealous with each other.  Learning they sampled each other's girlfriends on at least one occasion brings the whole thing to a boil, and Julio and Tenoch argue with Latin bombast.  Luisa has a theory that the boys have sexual tension between them, the kind insinuated by their morning skinny-dip in a leaf-cluttered pool lensed beautifully by director Cuaron with turquoise shimmer and unaffected nudity.

The boys and Luisa have secrets that the film's ending will reveal (but I will not).  Luisa cements her break-up with her husband across the road trip in melancholy telephone conversations often juxtaposed with the boys' carefree mirth.  In one scene she's balling on the phone while they enjoy a vigorous game of fooz ball.  Her sadness is deepened by something else, her secret, one only hinted at near the top of the film.

I really must remark that though the film's trio of main characters are listless and lost and that the peasant life it shows is charming but bleak, there are moments of robust joy and sensuality in ""Y Tu Mama Tambien.""  The night scene on the beach that leads to a tequila-fueled menage begins with a dance to a gorgeous ballad picked randomly on a jukebox.

The element of randomness operates with the film's ending too, which isn't pat or neat or sunny but rings true to life and the deep/shallow bonds adolesents forge, formative but fleeting.",1111622400,16,3835,4.858461538461539

Two teenage boys, Tenoch (Diego Luna) and Julio (Gael Garcia Bernal), are adrift when their girlfriends leave for an Italian vacation.  They smoke pot, talk sex, scheme, talk sex.  When they meet Luisa the willowy wife of Tenoch's cousin, they cannot believe their good fortune - especially because she agrees to accompany them on a trip to an isolated, gorgeous beach called Heaven's Mouth.  No matter that they made up Heaven's Mouth to impress her; they are going.  Their journey creates a bond among the three, not only sexually but emotionally, that we know will always be a part of them.  In several graphic scenes that stop short of hard-core porn, the characters discover that sex is both everything and not everything.

The film's stamp of individuality is the witty, deadpan narration.  Strangely, the scenes stop  for a second or two, frozen and completely silent, before the voice-over begins.  This roughness of editing actually adds to the film's charm by avoiding the slickness many of us are used to seeing in Hollywood films.  Gritty background shots of Mexico add context to these spoiled boys' adventure - and hint to the underlying reality of Luisa's motivation.  (Astute viewers will know right away what motivates her, but this knowledge only adds to the poignancy.)  Although this is often dubbed a ""coming of age film"", I never got the impression that the boys grew up until long after their experiences.  To them, it was a lark and a test of their friendship; only later, when they have already grown apart, do they see what it all meant.

This movie creeps up on you. The early scenes are quite amusing but I felt a bit disengaged - Julio and Tenoch are not, at this point in the proceedings, particularly easy to like.  But then the emotional plot starts to thicken and matters get more and more complicated all with a relentless and entirely gripping poetic logic. By the end of it I was more or less speechless. It's an outrageously beautiful, wonderfully truthful movie. There are very few road movies that bring such depth to the great central metaphor of that genre.

1446846,4,B00005JL57,"I find it impossible to write an adequate review of ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" without giving away much of the plot, so stop reading now if you don't want me to spoil it for you.

Still reading?  OK, here's the synopsis: a pair of 17-year-old Mexican boys (played by Diego Luna and Gael Garca Bernal), best friends, have just seen their girlfriends off for a summer trip to Italy.  The boys' thoughts immediately turn to getting stoned and getting laid.  They succeed at the former endeavor but don't have much success at the latter until a chance meeting with an older woman at a wedding starts things in motion.  Her husband, a cousin of one of the boys, has just confessed to adultery and she wants to get out of town.  So the three set off on a road trip to a beach that the boys have made up as part of their clumsy seduction routine.  Along the way we're treated to sex, secrets, lies, class distinctions, and political issues.  And despite the beach being fictitious, they actually find this mythical paradise.  But, alas, this is supposed to be a ""meaningful"" film, so we don't end at this happy place.  Things keep moving and all the relationships inevitably fall apart.

Many reviews have remarked on the sex in ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"".  I think it's a pretty frank view of teenage sex -- as frequent as possible, clumsy, and unsatisfyingly brief.  The cinematography works hard at keeping sex from being sexy here, and succeeds pretty well.  For those interested in nudity in this unrated version there's a good bit of the two male leads, but more time is spent showing them swimming or snapping towels at each other in a locker room than in the sex scenes.  The departing girlfriends are shown having farewell sex with their beaus, and we get to see the female lead (Maribel Verd) in three sex scenes and once topless on the beach.  So what's sexy about this movie?  It's the interaction between the boys and the older woman, almost in spite of the actual sex.  Having left an unsatisfying relationship she's eager to build a new one with these boys, and they're pliable clay for her to mold.  (She's also got another reason, but I won't spoil ALL the surprises for you.)

The secrets and lies are mostly about sexual betrayal, which is inevitable for juvenile characters who promise fidelity to their girlfriends and immediately try to get laid.  If these boys are bad at sex, they're even worse at establishing meaningful relationships; it's only the emotional glue supplied by the older woman who manages to give their brief affair any meaning.

The class distictions and political issues are mostly related by an annoying voice-over, telling us the sad history before, or the dim future that awaits.  One telling exception is the pair of back-to-back phone calls that starts the road trip in motion: the maid walks through room after room to deliver a sandwich to the rich boy before answering the phone for him, whereas the middle-class boy gets woken up immediately by the phone ringing just outside his small bedroom.  This visual contrast relates the class distinctions better than any voice-over telling us that the rich boy flushes with his foot when visiting his poorer friend.

Did I like ""Y Tu Mama Tambien""?  Yes.  Would I watch it again?  I don't think so.  While an effective film, it's mostly about the shallowness of teenage relationships, and shallowness doesn't merit close scrutiny.",1095984000,8,3404,4.731748726655348
1446847,3,B00005JL57,"I'm not really sure how to rate this film - I suppose it all depends on how you want to approach it. As a political/social commentary piece, I would give it a high rating. This aspect of the film is, in my opinion, well developed and thought out, with interesting metaphors and thought-provoking ideas that run throughout the movie. If I'm going on cinematography - A++, definitely, Alfonso Cuaron has an amazing eye and the entire film is beautifully shot.

The one area where this film didn't hold up as well for me was in the actual story. Simply put, I was pretty bored by the end and found myself reaching for the fast forward button. The characters are so busy developing the movie's underlying social themes that they don't do anything of much interest (besides the graphic sex scenes you've probably heard so much about). By the end of the movie they still didn't feel completely developed as characters in their own right (rather than walking talking metaphors), and I realized that I didn't much care what happened with any of them. I didn't see a lot in the way of a plot or of any character development - I suppose this mirrors the way that life often turns out, but it's not necessarily interesting to watch.

Essentially the movie is billed as a ""coming of age"" film, but anyone who is really honest will tell you, none of the characters really grow up, in fact most of the time, these characters unable to see their own bad behavior, fail to grow up at all.
I've seen movies like this before like in ""american pie"" and ""porky's"" and this is basically the latin version of those type of dumb adolescent movies.
I did find myself laughing in a couple of scenes however it's the laughing sense where your actually laughing at the characters and how dumb they are in getting themselves into certain situations.
Take the characters of tenoch (diego luna) and julio (gael garcia bernal), boys from the barrio who proceed to hit on a somewhat naive and weak older woman named luisa while her husband is away on business.
Luisa knows that these pathetic boys (they have no jobs and both of them basically live of the wealth of their parents), just want to sleep with her and keep using the most pathetic lines possible to ""score"" with her.
It's pathetic, but that kinda describes the whole movie. yeah it seems like it's a nice movie filled with some interesting locales of Mexico and a good blend of the culture but not really especially as presented through the eyes of these two losers.
Take a couple of scenes in the movie that kinda sum that up :
Tenocho farts in the car with julio beside him, he lays an ugly one and is reprimanded by Julio. Two minutes later Julio farts (the same guy supposedly who had manners) and laughs hysterically.
The two boys then laugh together as kind of like ""hahaha we pretend to like the rules, but we break them like it's a joke"".
That kinda seems to be attutide of the two. Luisa is just a ""fresh piece of meat"" that happens to be the target of these salivating lowlifes. lol
Even sadder is that Luisa succumbs to the advances of these two, however it's not due because of their charming personalities.. Hell no. It's actually due to the fact that Luisa catches wind of the fact that her husband has been having an affair with another woman.
Seeing her husband's infidelity face first, Luisa then like many women in that of position irrationally basically sleeps with both boys during separate instances..  LOL Even more hilarious is the case when these two fight over Luisa as if they sort of own her. Lol It seems that they are oblivious to the fact that they have basically had a couple of one night stands with a vulnerable woman who only wanted to strike back at her husband

For those sharp enough to pick them up, it's full of symbolism and wonderful contrasts, driven by the relationship between the two protagonists and best friends, and the older woman they meet.
Once you get used to the style of the film it soon becomes addictive. I couldn't take my eyes off it. There is a gentleness about it, and some poignant and meaningful statements about human life linger just below the surface narrative of sex and adolescent self-discovery.
Unlike some reviewers here, I don't find the sight of two teenage boys kissing each other offensive, and so am not willing to damn the film because of its homo-erotic content. This makes it realistic - not a terrible quality in a film.",1084406400,9,799,4.47945205479452
1446913,3,B00005JL57,"Luisa did not go on the road trip to get revenge on her unfaithful husband. She loved him, but she wanted to make the most of her time. Better to spend it on a road trip with some teenagers than wondering who her husband was seeing while she was sitting at home. The last sex scene wasn't a threesome--as Luisa said, they could have sex with each other, but not her, which is what she steered them towards.
I think it's about two kids learning to choose something other than instant gratification--not caring who they sleep with, what they do, or how they spend the rest of their lives. Their time with Luisa teaches them to take things more seriously, which doesn't happen until the end (there are lots of little things along the way, but that's obviously the final blow).

In truth, I did enjoy this film quite a bit, and perhaps would've enjoyed it even more if it hadn't been so hyped up. It is well acted, and has a nice organic feel to it. It is lightly funny, and almost always engaging. It features lush views of mexican culture, and natural landscapes.
That said, this movie doesn't really have much to offer on an emotional or mental level. Two lusty 18 year old guys take along a sexy older women on a road trip. Sex is handled with nowhere near the taste and tenderness as it was in the 2001 superb Spanish film, Sex and Lucia. That said, I don't believe that this (...) was supposed to be tender or anything. But the wild romps really didn't add any sort of feeling or effect to the film, and throughout, I kind of got the feeling that the director wanted to show how sensually fearless he and his cast could be.

1446917,4,B00005JL57,"I didn't know erotic existentialism existed, yet somehow director Alfonso Cuaron found a way to combine the plight of the human condition with steamy scenes that will melt your beer mug in his film Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN.
Seventeen-year-old pals Tenoch and Julio are hormone-driven, annoying boys with too much time on their hands.  When by chance at a wedding they meet the wife of Tenoch's cousin, a much older woman named Luisa (played exquisitely by a hauntingly beautiful Maribel Verdu), the stage is set for a powerful coming-of-age story, as the boys ask their new friend to accompany them to a secluded beach.  Once Luisa consents, and the road trip begins, this film powerfully, and at times humorously, explores the facade of resisted temptations--of a friendship put to the test. . .of a friendship that might be more than just a friendship.
Intertwined throughout the compelling cinematography, steamy erotica, and adolescent nonsense is a dark element of fatalistic existentialism--an element in the form of a narrator--that serves to remind the viewer this is no lightweight ""American Pie"" spoof.  There are times when the dialogue cuts away and the narrator takes over; the somber voice tells stories of tragedy and suffering, past and present, on the part of people we will never get to know--people who are mentioned only because of their proximity to the main characters.  Powerful, powerful stuff.
As much as I liked the film, I did have a few problems.  The two teenagers at times were so irritating I kept wanting to tell them to go to their rooms.  We learn so much about Luisa's background via the narrator, but learn very little about why she made the choices she did late in the film--especially given the immaturity of her companions.  And there's a tragedy at the end that comes out of nowhere. . .but is consistent with the bleak undercurrent of the film.
Spoken in Spanish, subtitled in English, Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN is riveting entertainment.  The DVD contains a short feature entitled ""Me la debes,"" which takes infidelity to a whole new level, and ultimately proves it's a small world, after all.  Due to the explicit materials, this DVD is for adults only.  Make sure your heart medication is up to date before viewing.

Three lives are woven together forever on this epic trip to the beach, and not only the boys' lives are changed - so are the readers'.

As my wife put it, this movie is a cross between an Italian sex comedy and a 70s-vintage German drama.  The bad parts of Italian sex comedy and 70s-vintage German drama.
As a character study with very little plot, it fails; the boys are self-absorbed, spoiled and unlikeable, and the older woman they covet is a cipher who we never really get to know, despite the endless talking.  She is just the McGuffin, something for the boys to lust after and fight about and then find themselves.  I guess they found themselves; the movie just sputters to a halt and I never felt like we had any closure.  For this movie to work, you have to care about the characters, and I just never got to the point where I cared about them at all.  Indeed, to echo another reviewer, when they turned down a dirt road when they werelost, I found myself hoping they would ride into an ambush just so the movie would be over.  In that sense, I cared about them in a negative way, but I don't think that's what the movie was shooting for.
I didn't object to the sex or the nudity.  Indeed, by and large, it was anything but erotic.  I suspect it was a more realistic depiction of young adult sex than what we see in Hollywood movies, and as such if the MPAA ever allowed such scenes in American films, young women would never have sex again.  I did object to the fact that there wasn't a single bodily fluid we didn't get to see.  Be forewarned: to borrow a phrase from Seinfeld, this is a pee party.
The best part of this DVD is the 12-minute short film (apparently a student film of the director's) in the Special Features.  This film is a riot, and after seeing it I can understand how the director got funding for this movie.  Cuaron shows real promise as a director.  I hope he tries again with a screenplay that is less of a downer and has more of a plot.
Y Tu Mama Tambien has a number of good things about it, which is why I didn't give it one star.  The performances are outstanding, and the technical aspects of the production (aside from the audio) are flawless.  As for the audio, the only problem (and it's jarring) is the abrupt audio cut every time we switch from the action to the narrator.  And we switch to the narrator a lot.  I thought something was wrong with the disc the first time it happened, as we went from a high audio level to zero for a few seconds before the narrator started talking.

He has a flawless eye for scenery and specifically the nature of growing up, pain, and internal suffering of human relationships.  All this coincides with the growth of his home country of Mexico.
The story centers around Julio and Tenoch, two very close, best friends despite their two completely different and separate family backgrounds.  They are typical immature (...) teenagers.  When they meet a beautiful woman, Luisa, who has her own set of problems, they convince her to take a trip to a made up beach.  Along the way, they discover themselves personally and grow, and also along the way, we as the audience, can watch the the growth and maturation of the country.

The film is VERY erotic - and I don't say that as a bad thing.  The plot follows two lusty Mexican teens and a woman in her twenties as they go off on a wild goose chase for a private beach.  Of course everybody ends up having sex.  We know this from the opening shot which is a full-on copulation scene.  There is a lot of sex and nudity in the film - which is the point: it's about beautiful naked people doing things nakedly.  When they're not having sex, they are TALKING about having sex.  However, these are a fun group of people and their little odyssey is strangely absorbing.
The movie is a wonderful trip.  I wouldn't look too deeply for meaning in the film.  The line that sums up the film's philosophy is: ""Your life is like the ocean - you should give yourselves away.""  Roughly that translates to, casual sex is the answer to all your problems.  That doesn't even hold up in the logic of the film - the sex, in the end, is more destructive than it is constructive.  Also, the sex is reprehensibly unsafe.
But all this is looking too deeply into a character study.  It is simply a well-made, independent film.

""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" is such kind of movie that, while it doesn`t bring nothing entirely new, still goes down as an enjoyable cinematic experience. Director Alfonso Cuaron did a decent though not-too-interesting adaptation of Dickens` ""Great Adaptations"" in 1998. With this more recent release, the end results are a bit better. The plot is about too teens and a late-twenties woman that make a trip through Mexico in a car. Obviously, they will face some inner changes down the road and their friendship, ideas and convictions will be tested and questioned.
Altough the movie is overrated, it still gives some food for thought as it raises issues about growing up, the differences between love and friendship and how it is to be a young adult dealing with new and difficult styles of life.

They're thus bored during vacation, swimming at the country club on Mondays, and smoking weed with their friend Saba, that is until at a wedding, attended by no less a personage than the President of Mexico himself, they meet Luisa, the wife of Tenoch's writer/cousin Alejandro, nicknamed Jano.  She's slim, elegant, and her being a Spaniard as opposed to Mexican makes her quite a dish.  They have the hots for her and even talk about taking her to a beach called Heaven's Mouth.
After learning that her husband has been with another woman, Luisa accepts their invitation to Heaven's Mouth, which may or may not exist, as their friend Saba is stoned out of his skull when he gave Tenoch and Julio the directions.  She is too well aware that they are hoping to score with her.  While on the road, they start telling her things about themselves, such as the order of Charolastros, an informal code they live by, such as being faithful to their girlfriends, not rooting for Team America in football, and condoning autoeroticism.  She in turn tells some things about herself, including her first boyfriend.  But she is still hurting from the affair her husband has, and she initiates first one and then the other boy, which causes tensions to flare up between them.
The unabashed, uncompromising sexuality in this film is more on a real basis than the stuff in American teen movies of both my generation and the current slop being shown in theatres.  The long distance scene of the boys fantasizing about females lying nude on diving boards is more realistic than anything round with pastry and apple filling.  It's quite profanity-laden too, as the male protagonists are quite potty-mouthed, to say the least.
Both Diego Luna (Tenoch) and Gael Garcia Bernal (Julio) make a good pair of buddies, with Maribel Verdu (Luisa) being their foil, big sister, and mentor in this road trip, which of course leads to their growing up.
The drama is interspersed with a sudden cutoff in the soundtrack, followed by a matter-of-fact audio commentary on the characters and their background, and in the case of a fisherman Chuy, who befriends the trio at Heaven's Mouth, his future, as it is depressing.  Another commentary is what the President does after the wedding.  First he condemns a massacre at the indigenous Cerro Verde, then goes to Seattle to attend a conference.  That in turn displays the division seen between well-to-do's like Tenoch and the elite, such as the President of Mexico, and people like Julio and the poorer people they meet along the way.
Luisa's message to the boys also encompasses the message here:  ""Life is like the surf, so give yourself away like the sea,"" meaning the dynamic impermanence of life's situations, and to enjoy and savour the present, because it won't last.",1073260800,7,2956,4.852882703777336

Quite simply, it's too frank in its depiction of coming-of-age sexuality that it would have never qualified for an R rating in the US.  Such a shame, because this film is one of the most provocative and engaging dramas of the past few years.
Julio and Tenoch are two best friends growing up in two different worlds in Mexico.  Julio lives with his single mother, a secretary who works hard to provide for her family.  Tenoch is a son of privilege, born into a wealthy family with ties to the ruling parties of Mexico.  Yet, the two form a seemingly ubreakable bond.
Both of their girlfriends have trotted off to Europe for the summer, and in their loneliness, Julio and Tenoch pick up a beautiful girl at least a decade their senior.  Enchanting her with fabricated stories of treasures untold, they convince her to accompany them on a trip to a remote beach.
Along the way, both Tenoch and Julio discover more about themselves and about their sexuality.  Any more I can not offer, for fear of ruining a lot of what makes the movie so interesting.
The DVD presentation of Y Tu Mama is bare-bones.  There are only a few special features to speak of, but a movie this good is its own special feature.  The only viewing option is Spanish spoken with English subtitles, which is wonderful, since this is a film that begs to be at least heard in its native language.

Yes, this is a simplistic, low-budget movie.  But this movie does an excellent job of presenting what life is like in Mexico, particularly as it relates to the class structure in Mexico.  Little things like the countryside, the shops, the Federales stopping traffic are all perfectly depicted.
The primary focus of the memo of course are two young teenage boys struggling with drugs, alcohol, authority and sex.  They meet a young woman just struggling.  The movie covers their relationship and the tragic hidden secret.
This movie will disappoint many.  But for me I was able to find some nuggets and learn from them.  I wish I had had the unrated version.

I, for one, do not know a single teenager who did anything close to the ""17 year olds"" in this filth. But I guess me and my friends were too busy expanding our knowledge instead of burying our faces in carnal desires.
Question- how do you sell a movie in the year 2003? SEX! Regardless of the consequences. And that's all this film is. There is no plot, and no characters, as far as I'm concerned.
This movie has no meaning. The sex is meaningless. In my day, sex with someone MEANT something. I simply do not see how this can be called art. And the acting? Please! Its just horrible. Its not art. Trash is all this is.",1069113600,21,761,4.219178082191781
1447132,4,B00005JL57,"By now this movie has become rather infamous as a result of its frank treatment of human sexuality, but while this is certainly central to the story and the relationships between the characters, it is a great disservice to the movie to view it merely in terms of its sex.  The sex is only a part of a tapestry which attempts (with mixed success) to tie together many diverse aspects of Mexican life and culture into a portrait of the people that make up that country.  More than any other movie I can think of, this film goes a long way towards presenting a culture (which is admittedly very different from the USA)  to an audience in such a way that through the conduit of the two best friends the viewer feels somehow akin to them and as a result to that culture.  From this perspective it is a wonderful movie about cultural understanding employing the medium of common human experience (the coming-of-age of the boys). I'm not sure if this was the filmaker's intention, or if everyone who sees this film will have a similar reaction to it.  The language the two boys employed when speaking to each other reminded me of many of my own friends (which maybe doesn't speak well for the company I hang around in), but this really gave me a good impression of the directors' honesty and understanding of our common humanity.
All this being said, when taken simply as a road movie (which is a good vehicle for other thematic elements yet not a very engaging element by itself) this movie is only mediocre.  This is sad, because the film spends so much time developing the relationship between the three main characters that it distracts it from the commentary of Mexican life only to replace it with a contrived and poorly concieved overall commentary about the dangers and necessities of human pleasures and their relationship with human pain.  I wish I could give this film a five for its clever narrative style, its frankness, and its broad all encompassing reach.  Unfortunately, the film mistakes the vehicle of its social commentary for the real film, and while not spoiling it, making it much less interesting than it could have been.",1068854400,4,2138,4.667553191489362
1447133,5,B00005JL57,"I had resisted seeing this movie for months, but when I finally was introduced to ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" at a party one evening, I was so spellbound by this hypnotic sexy journey, I found myself buying a copy the next day.
The true story involves our witnessing the very moments that make life worth living, despite all the harships that life has to offer.  Our heros are two young immature boys, at the beginning of their last summer of freedom.  One is the son of a highly respected government worker and the other is from a small working class family.  Their youthful friendship however is based on the games that children play, as they shrug off maturity and replace it with parties, pot and trying to live out fantasies.  Then their tour guide comes in: the beautiful wife of the upper class boy's cousin.  Both boys take to her quickly and fantasize about bedding her.
To impress her, they tell her they are going to take a road trip to a beach that doesn't even exist.  However, when the young woman finds out that her husband is having affairs, she asks them to take her with them and the boys plan out a journey to a Shangri-La that is as fictatious as their bold personalities.  The Odyssey then begins, as the trio start their long journey to find a beach called ""Heaven's Mouth"".  We then are left to examine the three and their short comings and inhibitions as they interact with strange minor characters along the way, have long discussions of friendship and the meaningfulness of their lives and begin to have sex with each other.  One must then wonder what happens when the boys realize their fantasies are becoming realities and that their are consequences to the poor choices they make and the choices they have already made.
""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" is brilliant in the fact that no matter who you are, you can't help but get a sense of nostalgia from seeing the roadtrip you always fantasized about taking yourself.  Each character represents a different way of life and we are exposed to the true nature of immortality and the fading of one's personal sense of glory.
To keep the mood of this journey surreal, the film gives the audience a narration of the true story behind every character seen.  We find out that a friendly fisherman will loose his job and his family will be forced into poverty and that the most noble characters will die alone and afraid.  Despite these morbid distractions, it is refreshing to enjoy the very moments that our protagonists will cherish forever.
The movie is very sexually charged and is full of  both male and female nudity.  Our heroine makes it her personal responsibility to teach her young travel companions what sex and love really is.  Despite the fact that boys are practically ten years younger than her, she sleeps with one of them, causing a lot of tension in the car ride.  To make up for this, she sleeps with the other one soon after.  These actions lead to the deterioration of the boys friendship, in which their fighting exposes a whole history of betrayal between them that has gone undiscussed.  When their woman companion threatens to leave the car trip, the boys are forced to make ammends, but must reevaluate their relationship - of course, this leads to a climax of all three characters having sex together, releasing all inner desires and frustrations.  This of course will seal the end of their friendship, their journey to Heaven's Mouth and the end of their youth, for when they return home, they must prepare to enter the adult world.
Though this movie appeals to younger audiences, one must remember that the sexual content  and vulgarity is high and the themes will take age and experience to go fully appreciated. Watch it now and you will love it, then watch it a few years and it will be perfection.",1068508800,12,3783,4.634730538922156
1447134,3,B00005JL57,"This mildly diverting road movie/buddy film from Mexico doesn't break any new cinematic ground, but should  make most movie buffs sit up straight for 105 minutes. If you bought all the hype that initially surrounded the film, you are bound to be let down, so it is best to dive in with an open mind and lowered expectations. The story centers around two teenaged pals enjoying that mythical ""Last Summer"" before college, career and adulthood beckon. The twist comes in the form of an earthy,voluptuous beauty,a slightly older cousin to one of the boys, who takes a break from her troubled marriage to join them on a road trip. At first bemused by thier silly macho posturing and braggidacio regarding thier sexual prowess,the woman tires quickly of the immature chatter and decides to teach them some Life Lessons (for her own enigmatic reasons, which eventually are revealed). The lesson plan mostly involves impulsive and furtive sex between all concerned, followed by the expected jealousies and petty recriminations.  This aspect of the film has been played up ad nauseum; the sex scenes are no more shocking or revealing than what we've already been watching in European films for years (in fact, the film's opening shot struck me as an homage to ""Betty Blue""). Once again, by the end of the film, you probably won't feel like you've just had a life-changing epiphany, but you won't neccessarily feel you've wasted your time either.",1067472000,18,1437,4.95850622406639

The way this movie was structured was just beautiful, how everything in the movie seemed to play an important role, not just the characters, but the minor characters as well. I also loved the scenes from Mexico, where it wasn't mainly Mexico D.F, but the rest of the country, which a lot of the time is overlooked in films.",1066953600,,527,4.333333333333333
1447136,3,B00005JL57,"This apparently titillating and hence duly controversial movie begins with a bang, literally, and doesn't let up for a second thereon. As you may already know by now, there's oodles of nudism and road sex, but it is not gratuitous or cheap.
Was I offended? No. Was I paying attention to the supposedly grandiose coming-of-age underlying theme? You bet I was. I didn't find the cheerful dropping of clothes every minute in the least bit distracting.
NO, I think the problem is not in that. Once you get past the (and lets get euphemistic here) ""visuals"", the real problem with the movie is that it never really grabs you with anything special. A couple of teenage boys set about on a cross-country trip with a clearly raunchy mature lady who supposedly knows a great deal about life's deeper things, having been married and scorned and all, and thus teaches them something deep and meaningful about life in between the casual romps.
Occasionally we have sheer duds of movies that are exalted beyond their true merit with the raves of critics and other mortals like you and me who cannot recognize what precisely they enjoyed about the movie. This one leads the pack.
Worth a watch? May be. Men may want to be a bit more decisive than that. But still, very, very far from a stirring masterpiece, or a ""celebration of life"", or anything quite as magnanimous as that.",1066435200,2,1363,4.707112970711297
1447137,4,B00005JL57,"Here's a film that gives me great hope as an alternative to mainstream cinema. The increased Hollywood-ization of foreign films has become a dire prospect and it's a shame to see how many great cinema industries have regressed in the last couple of decades (esp. Italian and French cinema). So, imagine my surprise when this movie came out of Mexico. It concerns the tale of a young woman in a troubled marriage who meets two teenaged boys who, in their attempts at charming her, mention a mythical beach on the Baja coast that they'd like to take her to.  She calls their bluff and the boys are beside themselves with excitement. For her, it's a chance to throw caution to the wind and to loosen herself from the constrictions of her life.  For them, it's a chance to maybe score with an older woman and take a road trip. There's many situations in the film that you've seen before, but, it's done with a fresh perspective and, as it's filmed in Mexico, an opportunity to see Mexicans like you've never seen them before. The most the average American has seen concerning Mexico is usually in gangster films about the L.A. barrios. Here, we see middle-class, urbane Mexicans and how they intermingle with rural peasants and natives. The film is sexually frank, even though on ocassion it tends to border on the cliche (the implication that male bonding rituals have a homoerotic edge to them is a tired one...this is clearly a somewhat feminist film.), but for the most part it seems to be about taking freedom to it's limits, be it sexual, physical, geographical, etc. The ending of the film leaves a lot of questions, especially as to the motives of the lead female character. Was she really just trying to broaden the boys' horizons and help them experience life as sensously as possible? Or was she really selfish and manipulative, knowing that her actions could destroy the boys' friendship, but caring little about the consequences. I hope I didn't give anything away with that one.  Despite very, very minor flaws, such as the aforementioned,  the film does give hope for the return of a sophisticated, erudite world cinema. The lead actors were all brilliant. Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal were both incredibly charismatic and believable as typical teens who think they know more than really do about life, proving once again that teenage naivety is a worldwide phenomenon. And bravo to the leading lady, Maribel Verdu. While not the most conventionally attractive of women, she belies a sexiness that would irresistable to grown men, let alone a pair of teens.  Her loose manner combined with some smarts make her a prototype of the modern woman, divided by her desires and what she's grown up to believe women should be like.  A phenomenal film that deserved every kudo that it garnered.",1065916800,5,2801,4.800829875518672
1447138,3,B00005JL57,"There has been a lot of buzz around the movie, but honestly I don't understand it. I watch quite a lot of foreign films, particularly Mexican, Brazilian, French and Indian. I really enjoy most of them. This was just ok. Production values were just ok. The actors playing the two boys aren't particularly nuanced or expressive. Sure they're 'natural' -- because I don't think they are acting at all, they are just goofing around, just as in their real life.
Maribel Verd, however, is truly an amazing actress. Beautiful, subtle, alternately nonchalant and highly emotional. She rescued this film for me, and I intend to go see anything else she is starring in.
As for major life messages, ""coming of age"" has been done to death. I'm not particularly impressed that these two boys have grown up a whole lot, and the fact that they are alienated by the end of the movie is just sad, not poignant. The ""life is short"" message is handled much better, and again much more subtly, by the Maribel Verd character. You really don't understand her actions and motives until the end, and then it is something of a revelation.

You will want to watch this film a number of times so that you can understand all the social commentary, and it will entertain you each & every time.  But don't let the noise distract from the core message - Mexico is a sexually maturing country that still has some learning before its masses can reach a place of honest, functional sex.  The maturing teenage boys represent the country's sexual culture which has recently gone from overly closed & conservative to extremely open & disfunctional, the older European women represents the happy medium of functional, guilt-free open sex.

Dear MGM,
I think it is quite disgusting that you released a cut version of Y Tu Mama Tambien onto DVD.  I accidentally purchased this abomination!
The director chose a vision and cut and edited his own movie, and simply by your own skewed morality, you decide to edit out scenes that may be ""questionable"" to certain people.
Let me suggest this: if something is ""questionable"" people can choose to rent it.  It's called America!  You mention that you have it in ""widescreen"" because of the director's vision. What about cutting parts of the movie because of your own hysterical censorship?
On the back of the box, you highlight a prominent blurb from the new york times that states ""Fast, funny, unafraid of sexuality.""  If only that could be applied to  MGM!
This movie is a wonderful story about coming of age in Mexico, and I for one believe it's awful that you edited to suit your own diluted tastes.",1060646400,10,989,4.596590909090909
1447175,5,B00005JL57,"I bought this movie without even having seen in first, purely due to the pile of positive reviews it had received.  The only thing I knew about it was that it was very sexually explicit.  Both the reviews and its mild notireity proved to be true - it's extremely good and the sex scenes are some of the more daring you'll find in a movie release.  The plot is basic enough, setting up best friends Julio and Tenoche on a road trip with older woman Luisa, who has just left her husband.  They tell her they're taking her to a beach called Heaven's Mouth, a place that doesn't even exist, and the rest really gives way to character development.
Above all director Cuaron (who's last movie, the underrated modern adaptation of Great Expectations showed a similar verve) seems to favour passion, with a sun-soaked camera lens and racy, explicit sex scenes that manage to capture all the awkward fumbling, lust and longing for true love that is apparent in his two gangly heroes.  They speak of sex and girls as if they're men, but as Luisa is quick to point out (and the script quick to show), they're still just boys.  This kind of sensitivity towards what would otherwise just be gratuitous nudity lifts the movie above films such as American Pie, to which Y Tu Mama Tambien is often compared to.  Whilst American Pie was impressive for its faintly feminist view on teen lust, it cannot approach the moral complexity that Cuaron's movie shows.  For example, is Luisa liberating Julio and Tenoche or entrapping them?
The acting is sublime, especially the two leads, although the naturalistic performances from everyone involved complement the handheld camera work well.  Yet what is most praise-worthy about the movie is the depressed feeling that it gives you at the end as each character is stripped bare (literally and figuaratively) of their pretences and masks that they show each other.  The use of an omniscient narrator that invests each place, each supporting player (including at one point a group of pigs) with a future and a past outside of the script means that this is a movie that reaches beyond the camera to gently touch its audience.  Whilst its sex scenes may grab you immediately, the movie as a whole will have a much more lasting impression on you.",1060560000,2,2267,4.728426395939087

This movie made me cry among many things. There is a strong showing of class distinction in Mexico. The ones that are on this trip are just young brats of light-skinned well-to-do families, and so is Luisa, a Spanaird.
There are many clashes throughout the road trip of harsh Mexican realities. Meanwhile the kids cruise and hardly pay attention to what is really going on. THey get to stay in hotels, have a car and don't have to work. After all their nonesne and fun they must move on.
The only time when the characters interact with the non-European blooded Mexicans, full mestizos is at the end, when Luisa is at the beach. What does this mean? This is the only time that she seeks them for comfort and companionship, otherwise the boys and Luisa just blatantly ignore their surroundings. An analyzation of this can be pivotal to the main message of the film.
Another similar movie is Ratas, Ratones y rateros (Ecuador 2001). It is a bit violent and hard core. It is another coming of age film, but while Y tu mama tambien cleans up pretty well at the end, this oen doesn't suggesting something even more profound and real! Also recommended.
This movie is hardly porn and despite some graphic scenes with nudity they are basically part of the scheme.

There are glimpes into the Middle Class life in Mexico, the poverty and how it must be to be a ""middle class"" teenager in Mexico.

Tenoche (one the male characters) father was Secretary of State, Julio's (the other male character) sister was a protestor against the government.
I liked SO much about this movie. I find that I can't pinpoint them all, however I must mention that there are quite a few sexual scenes in it and I do not recommend it if you are not open to the possiblity of homosexuality, or if you find drug usage offensive then this may not be the movie for you.
One thing that I have noticed, lately with my Foreign Film selections, is that the movies don't always have a Happy ending. They don't tend to leave any loose ends, but it isn't always what you think it might be...... watch the movie it is rather a good pick.... and despite what you may have heard there is a very good story here.

Either way, the story behind Y Tu Mama Tambien is an interesting one. While the movie contains frank depictions and descriptions of sexuality and drug use, it still remains a fascinating look at the relationship between two friends and what happens when a beautiful stranger interrupts their routine way of life. I reccommend this film. However if you are squeemish of explicit depictions of sexuality and nudity, it may not be for you.",1056585600,,588,4.94949494949495
1447244,4,B00005JL57,"Y Tu Mama Tambien is a road movie directed by Alfonso Cuaron (Great Expectations). Set in Mexico we are introduced to two 17 year old boys having sex with their girlfriends. The girlfriends are about to leave for a trip to Italy so they are looking to get just a little bit more fun in before the trip. They leave, and Tenoch and Julio are left to find their own entertainments. They are part of Mexico's upper middle class and while at a party (thrown by one of their parents), they meet an older woman (in her late twenties). Not expecting her to accept, they invite Louisa(her) to a fictitious beach called 'Heaven's Mouth'. After learning of her husband's infidelity, Louisa takes the trip. Tenoch and Julio pretend they know where they are going and head towards a beach they hope will really be there when they get there. Before reaching the beach, the two have sex with the married woman, Louisa which resulted in fights during the travel time in the car. They later halt the fight and begged her to get back to the car as they agreed to listen to what she says and what she wants them to do......
This is a very sexual film, from the opening scenes to the denoument. There is a lot of discussion about sex, a fair amount of sex scenes (graphic and tender at the same time), and this just feels honest. We are not given nudity for the sake of nudity because in this film it feels essential to the ability to tell the story. The camera shows, but doesn't linger. There is also a gay act between the two boys, at almost 3/4 of the movie, after both were drunk. When they found out that they slept together on the same bed the next morning, they ran out of the house and vomitted.
The road trip and the development of the characters are extremely well done and the film rises well above the concept of the source material. We see Tenoch and Julio begin to grow up and grow into the men they will likely become. They begin the movie very immature and only looking for sex, drugs, and hanging with their friends. This movie shows the first steps beyond their childhood. Y Tu Mama Tambien could have easily become a Mexican version of American Pie or Road Trip, but this is much, much better. Highly recommended with a warning of a lot of sex(inclusive of one scene on masturbation near the bank of swimming pool where the 'things' which was fired out drop into the pool water) and nudity.",1056585600,2,2390,4.409502262443439

Once you see the ending, and realize why the girl was on the roadtrip it will make you want to watch the movie again.
There is also lot of socio-political commentary on Mexican life, which distracts many people from what I feel is the actual message the movie is trying to give.  That message is that life is short, and when life is very short you should savor every moment of it.
This movie does have a lot of sex, and a lot of vulgarity.  The subtitles translate virtually every intresting word into something starting with F, so if you don't speak Spanish you are really going to miss out on some colorful language.",1054684800,25,885,4.25
1447321,5,B00005JL57,"i saw this movie at the recommendation of my friend with some reluctance.first, i knew that alfonso cuaron had directed two films before and i didn't like them.and second, if my friend like it, i knew that this movie probably has a lot of sex. but i went and saw it anyway and i was completely blown away. it was quite a moving experience. and since a lot of people (no doubt) have summarized the film, i'll just review the dvd.the format of the menu, is quite nice; big, bold letters with scenes from the movie playing in the background and accompanied by some muzak.the first surprise is probably the first special feature you'll come across- the short film, Me La Debes, which, translated, means ""You Owe One"". it is pretty much a companion piece to the film, directed by carlos cuaron, alfonso cuaron's brother (who also co-wrote Y Tu Mama Tambien). you can see that much of Y tu Mama's profanity and sexuality came form carlos cuaron. this short film is about a family who have sex before going to bed(but not with each other! the father has sex with the maid, the daughter has sex with her boyriend). i found it brilliant and hilarious, though it does lack Y Tu Mama's depth and poigancy.the deleted scenes are a bit  disappointing, especially if you're expecting more sex.you only get three extra scenes and they're less than a minute long each..but the stoned scene is pretty funny.the making-of featurette is great, even though it is too short. it is delivered in the same spirit as the movie, complete with the deadpan narration, and just as funny,too. my favorite part is alfonso cuaron's practical joke on lead actress maribel verdu.and then there's the commentary, alas nothing from the director but form the cast members, who share as much insights and anecdotes as their characters.and lastly the trailers, which partly annoy me, 'cuz they don't really tell you much about the movie. and seeing that you never hear a word of dialogue, you'd think you're going to watch a silent film.it's the same for the majority of trailers for foreign films.the digital tranfer is great, giving much sheen to Emmanuel Lubezki's verite cinematography. and the sound's pretty good, too although this type of movie doesn't really require 5.1 audio.the movie is really the reason to buy this dvd. it lets you see a another part of world cinema, mexico. and along with amores perros, y tu mama tambien puts it firmly on the cinematic map. you kind of wish there were more movies like this;but then again, that's what makes them so special,so maybe not. anyway Y Tu Mama Tambien is a treat.",1054166400,,2585,4.7317073170731705

1447324,5,B00005JL57,"I've seen this film twice now and can say it improves with re-viewing. But in looking through some of the other customer reviews, I was amazed at how many who complained about lack of plot or purpose completely missed major thematic points being flagged by the creators. There's a lot going on in this road trip/coming-of-age film if you watch and listen carefully.
No writer can call a beach The Mouth of Heaven (which is where the film's lead trio are driving to) without signaling, practically with flares, that he is making a thematic point. Consider how this one gets used: The two boys think they've just made up the name to con Luisa--they've no idea where they're headed. It later turns out that a beach called Mouth of Heaven actually does exist, and they are near it. In the end, only Luisa goes to it; the boys never see it.
Backtrack for clues as to why the boys never see the Mouth of Heaven: For all their sex- and drugs-obsessed horseplay, they are not social equals. One comes from a privileged political family (part of the PRI ruling party in Mexico, now temporarily out of the presidency thanks to Vicente Fox) and the other, as he is unkindly reminded, is ""peasant trash."" They go to the same high school, but their post-graduation futures are going to be very different and that is what is really coming up on the horizon for them--not a celestial beach where they can honestly be friends forever.
All through the boys' juvenile dialog, and highlighted in the omniscient voiceover, are details that point out not only how the pair aren't similar, but also how much they've already internalized the social attitudes that will inevitably pull their friendship apart. The poorer one lights matches in his friend's bathroom after he uses it; the richer one uses his foot to raise the toilet seat when he visits the other one's house. As Luisa comes to discern, their relationship, while often affectionate and close, is mostly a sham and riddled with unspoken secrets and class-derived mistrusts.
Throughout the film, the creators take off on sidetracks to look at various aspects of Mexican life and culture. The film is clearly slanted toward non-Mexican audiences, because much of what they show is information to help outsiders understand the social realities facing these young men. Remember that the middle-class is much smaller in Mexico than in the US or Europe, so necessarily these two boys, while exuberantly individual, are also representing the largely dichotomized Mexican society in the way they inter-relate and yet remain separate and closed off. (Luisa, importantly, is Spanish, so she shares our view as an outsider; it is her job to help us uncover what is awry with this pair.)
Try looking at the film from these deeper and more symbolic viewpoints and I think many viewers will find the creators have given their audience a lot to think about during the film, and many reasons to care about what happens to the protagonists. The sad last scene isn't just a gathering up of plotlines, for the news about Luisa IS anti-climactic for us. The emotional punch is in watching the boys as they finally get an inkling of what Luisa was trying to tell them about themselves on that trip, and then push the realization away.",1052092800,29,3253,4.80035650623886
1447325,5,B00005JL57,"My local video store only carried the R-rated version of this film.  I was surprised to read that there was a more complete and unrated version and so I ordered it.  I was immensely moved by the film when I first saw it and the unedited version adds to the understanding of the final product.  If there is any disappointment it is that I do not have enough Spanish under my belt to understand the tracks where the actors discuss the film.  The ""Making of"" featurette is another interesting addition to the experience.  Some have written that the unrated version is more pornography than anything else.  I could not disagree more.

1447326,3,B00005JL57,"After seeing the trailer, I was very eager to see this movie.  Sold as a voyage of self discovery with a naughty flavor about it, I was disappointed in the film.  Mainly, I was hoping for something with more substance.
The sex scenes are somewhat abundant, but I wouldn't necessarily call this soft porn.  Other directors, such as Philip Kaufman, direct movies that are contain both eroticism and substance.  Maybe I was expecting too much, but I couldn't help being reminded of junior high/high school locker rooms, and the juvenile sex talk that incurred there.
On occasion, the main plot was interlaced with scenes of the political environment of Mexico.  I enjoyed these scenes, but they never seemed to relate to the lives of the boys.  After a while, they became tiresome because you see that the only thing that will appease the boy's horniness is a full divulsion of the truth regarding their sexual escapades; and in doing so, and explanation of the title.
The ending left me wondering if anything had changed. Both boys seemed to have missed an opportunity to grow up, and instead of both of them going through a life-changing event, they just end up behaving like children on a playground.
The director, however, does accomplish some good things in this picture.  The cinematography is good; the movie contains many good visual sequences and I did enjoy getting another view of Mexico in this film.  Overall, its decent.  I was just hoping for something better.",1050624000,4,1472,4.856
1447327,5,B00005JL57,"""Y Tu Mama Tambien,"" directed by Alfonso Cuaron, tells the story of two young guys in Mexico: Julio (played by Gael Garcia Bernal) and Tenoch (played by Diego Luna). When we meet them at the start of the film they are straddling that line between boyhood and manhood, and are interested mainly in hanging out, taking drugs, and having sex with their girlfriends. But there relationship is challenged when they take an erotically charged beach trip with a more mature woman named Luisa (Maribel Verdu).
""Y Tu Mama"" is a combination of road trip and coming-of-age story. The film is sexy and often very funny, but with an edge of sadness and introspection running throughout. A voiceover narration is effectively used as a cinematic device.
The cast delivers superb performances. Verdu has an offbeat sexual allure and delivers a very touching performance. Luna and Garcia Bernal bring an appealing energy to their roles, and there is solid three way chemistry among them all. The film is full of visual appeal, and some scenes almost have a documentary feel. There is some wonderful footage of the people and places the trio encounter on their journey.
The graphic nudity and sex scenes of the unrated version may be a bit much for some viewers, but I found this aspect of the film to be well integrated into the filmmakers' overall artistic vision. A story of lust, loss, and tenderness, ""Y Tu Mama"" is an enjoyable and moving film.",1050624000,12,1432,4.82520325203252
1447377,3,B00005JL57,"I am giving this review 3 stars because I know Amazon will apply it to both of the two versions of this movie they sell, the R-rated one and the unrated (probably NC-17) one. Quite simply, the R-rated one (which I saw) is maybe 2 stars, and (according to my wife, a native Mexican) the unrated is 4-5 stars.  Hence, an average of 3 stars.
My wife, a professor of Spanish Literature at a major US university, first saw this movie at a film festival and came home to tell me I had to see it. Well, by & by it came out on DVD and I rented it, picking up the R rate one, not realizing there were two versions. Comparing the technical data, it appears there are 5-6 minutes cut from the original (unrated) version for this R version. As we watched the movie, my wife almost immediately began saying ""huh, what's going on?"" Almost all of the most explicit scenes were cut. Based upon what my wife said of what they were (I have yet to see the full version), the first few expurgations were of only minor relevance to the plot, but the very final one (most of the scene in the cabana during the last night the boys spent with Luisa on the beach) is absolutely critical to understanding the whole point of the movie, and what happened in the conclusion. Obviously I don't want to say what happened & what was said in that scene missing from the R-rated version, since it would ruin the movie, and I don't want to do that to anyone. As it is, watching this R-rated version has ruined it for me -- sure I can go and look for the unrated one, but it won't be the same now that I already know what will happen.
Put simply, the R-rated version has a totally incoherent ending due to the cuts made to achieve the R rating. I found it completely unsatisfying, and my wife (who loved the full version, which I presume to be the one on the ""unrated"" DVD) said she would also have had a totally different opinion of hte movie had she seen only the R-rated one. The unrated is not for the sexually squeamish apparently -- the movie shows male sexuality in a way that Hollywood never would; remember the near NC-17 rating some movie recently almost got because it showed even just a male star's bare behind? -- but for the most part the sexuality is apparently ""realistic"" and plot-driven, not gratuitous.
In summary, my wife, who has seen both, would say that if you are willing to ""risk"" offense at the explicit sexual scenes of the unrated verson, it is a must-see; but if you are nervous and would opt for the R-rated version, don't bother, it is a waste of time. My wife attended the film festival screening (ie unrated version) with a number of colleagues and students, and apprently at least one of the more conservative undergraduates was a bit put off by the masterbatory scene at the beginning, among others.
A couple other notes on the movie - I found the use of voice-over narration entirely too heavy-handed (my wife is more forgiving of it however). And the quality of the subtitle translation is poor - I speak basic spanish but need subtitles to follow a movie completely, so I tend to be listening and reading at the same time when watching movies such as this. At times the disconnect between what the dialogue and the subtitles said was bewildering.",1050278400,51,3248,4.404326123128119

1447379,4,B00005JL57,"For those who shy away from foreign language films because they think they are boring or only for film snobs should see Alfonso Cuarn's ""Y tu mam, tambin."" This film has more in common with ""American Pie"" or ""Up in Smoke"" than say, ""A Room with a View.""
The story centers on two [over-sexed drug-induced]teenagers who convince the sexy wife of one of their cousins to go on a road trip with them. In a typical American teen comedy, the sexy older woman takes on a purely platonic role. For example, in John Hughes's ""Weird Science,"" two boys create their concept of a perfect woman, but as soon as she is created, she becomes like a sister to them. It's essentially a tease to draw teenage boys into the theatre.
In ""Y tu mam, tambin,"" the boys get more than just sisterly advise from their traveling companion. Marbiel Verd as ""Luisa Corts"" remains a sexual creature throughout. This makes for a more complex and ultimately satisfying film.
Ms. Verd creates a nice mix of maturity and emotion throughout in this film. Meanwhile, Gael Garca Bernal and Diego Luna as the two boys capture the spirit of youth. They are also not afraid to go where the story leads them. See the film to find out.
""Y tu mam, tambin"" deals with sexuality in a very frank and open way, unlike most American films. Some might find this quite refreshing. Others may be put off by it.
A minor complaint about the film involves the sound mix. Throughout the film there is voiceover narration. Just before the narrator speaks, all other sounds abruptly disappear. Usually, when there is narration, the background noises are lowered, but are still perceptable underneath. At first I found this jarring, but eventually I got used to it.
The film also has a cool contemporary soundtrack. Local Los Angeles area disc jockey Liza Richardson was one of the movie's music supervisors.
The DVD also includes a lot of nice bonuses. ""Me La Debes,"" a short film by Carlos Cuarn is a nice companion piece to the film. It also includes deleted scenes of ""Y tu mam, tambin"" and a ""making of"" featurette.
""Y tu mam, tambin"" was IFC's highest grossing film before ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" came along. It also won this year's Independent Spirit Award for ""Best Foreign Film.""

1447380,1,B00005JL57,"This movie was a pointless waste of film stock. I had heard many great things about this movie, and expected to rent it and be faced with an intelligent, provocative portrait of humanity. I got soft-core Mexican porn with no story.
Every character in this movie irritated me. Both the boys were immature, hypocritical and annoying. I hated them both. Also, that is not how seventeen year old boys act, no matter what their nationality. Luisa was a sad degenerate who was just as pathetic as anybody else in the film. Well, that's just my opinion.
I didn't mind the sex, but after a while it got incredibly predictable, and very annoying. For a film, the sex was very natural, but it never added anything to develop characters or bring the story along.
What bothered me most about this mess of a movie was the lack of plot. Nothing really happened. The film skips from sex scene to sex scene on a web of juvenile jokes and mindless exposition. These are occasionally mixed with totally pointless gross-out scenes, like when both boys ""help themselves"" on diving boards over a pool. Character developement? Not here. When a revelation finally comes, you already guessed it twenty minutes ago and you don't care.
By far the best part of this movie was the narrator. The crystal-clear lucidity he brought to moments in the film was beautiful, especially in the end. His omniscient commentary almost makes the movie worth watching, but there just isn't enough of it. Before the narrator speaks, the sound cuts out abruptly, jarring the viewer out of the flow of the film. The first time it happened I thought there was something wrong with my DVD player.

1447381,3,B00005JL57,"This affectionate coming-of-age film/road movie was simply, in my opinion, not as great as I was expecting it to be, judging from its various awards and nominations.  That is not to say it is not without a certain distinctive charm and several affecting moments.
The plot concerns two young friends who set out to find a fabled beach with a woman who is much older and married to a relative of one of the boys.  Along the way secrets are shared and by the end of the trip sexual contact has occurred in every possible combination among the three road-trippers.  Yes, I know it sounds like a lot of other films you've seen, but in some ways it really stands out.
The actors in this film do an amazing job.  Most of the characters start out as cliches, moving the story along with stereotypical actions.  But such one-dimensional characters are really brought to life by this great cast.  The boys are perfectly cast and eerily able to make us believe they have known each other all their lives.  Maribel Verdu brings a tenderness to her character that is necessary to make us believe that this little group actually sticks together through the whole film.  What really stood out the most to me were the sex scenes.  No, not just because they were explicit.  If I want explicit I can go to a porn store.  But the sex scenes in this film bring you closer to the characters as well as bringing characters close to each other.  Whereas sex in most American films seems to be airbrushed and sterile and just advance the plot, ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" presents scenes of incredible sensuality and intimacy despite their locations in cheap Mexican hotels or cars alongside a road.  Another pleasing aspect of this film is its cinematography.  The natural look of the film onscreen perfectly matches the boys' raw language and the willingness of the camera to follow characters into bedrooms, bathrooms, or behind closed shutters.  There are also no tight closeups in this film, leaving the acting to create the intimay between character and audience rather than filling a screen with an actor's face and expecting that to create sympathy for the character.
The only downside I saw to this film was its script.  Yes, I know these are adolescent boys, but certainly we don't have to have a juvenile sex joke in EVERY SCENE?  The poolside scene was totally unnecessary, I thought; character development came through the more slow, intimate portions of the film and sequences like the pool scene just made me say, ""Huh?  What is that doing here?"".  Also, there seems to be a political undertone that is never adequately addressed.  While traveling through Mexico the group sees evidence of many social classes and lifestyles.  There is an allusion made by the god-like narrator to the change in the ruling party in Mexico, and there is a brief digression about the future of the man who guides the group to the mythical beach.  But none of this is really tied together and it winds up looking misplaced.
Overall this is a film worth seeing for its superb acting alone, as long as you are not easily offended.  I hope to see all of these actors in future projects where perhaps a better script will allow their talents to really show.",1048550400,13,3216,4.683274021352313

1447384,3,B00005JL57,"AND YOUR MOTHER TOO
[Y Tu Mam Tambin]

(Mexico - 2001)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Digital

Two inseparable friends (real-life best friends Gael Garca Bernal [AMORES PERROS] and Diego Luna [VAMPIRES: LOS MUERTOS]) fall hopelessly in lust with Luna's sister-in-law (Maribel Verd, AMANTES), a beautiful young newlywed who's just discovered that her no-good husband is sleeping around. Hoping to escape her troubles, she agrees to accompany Garca Bernal and Luna on an extended road trip to a fabled - and perhaps non-existent - beach where the two guys hope to indulge their mutual passion for Verd. But their journey becomes fraught with tension (sexual and otherwise) as various secrets come tumbling out of the closet, driving an emotional wedge between the two friends and their heartbroken passenger.

Opening with two simulated (but incredibly realistic) sex scenes, Alfonso Cuarn's ambitious Mexican road movie establishes itself as a force to be reckoned with from the outset. Though hugely popular on its home turf, particularly amongst hormonally-challenged younger viewers, Cuarn's script has more on its mind than mere titillation. AMERICAN PIE this ain't!

Set during a time of social upheaval (the decline of the much-hated Institutional Revolutionary Party which governed the country until July 2000), the three principal characters travel through a Mexican landscape scarred by a corrupt political system which has divided the country as never before, generating unlimited wealth in the major cities and devastating poverty throughout rural communities still rooted in ancient traditions. Verd offers her sexual favors freely to the boys (for reasons which only become clear at the end of the film), but despite their bravado and passion, the two friends are sexually immature and therefore unable to deal with the emotional consequences of their actions. When confronted with the evidence of various infidelities, their anger - sparked by jealousy - hints at a twist in the tale which cuts right to the heart of the narrative and confronts its audience with the most jaw-dropping revelation this side of THE CRYING GAME.

This is a movie which dares to tell the truth about sex and sexuality, not merely to provoke the audience (though the nudity is both generous and cheerful, and the beautiful Garca Bernal has since become something of a poster boy) but also to illuminate the three central characters and the motivations which underpin their relationship. Quite an achievement.",1047859200,9,2519,5.364556962025317

1447453,5,B00005JL57,"A magical mystery tour of adolescence by way of Mexico, this beautifully evocative road movie never hits a wrong note. What begins as a naturalistic portrait of two teenage boys widens its scope as their journey progresses, taking in Mexico's troubled political past and present, class resentment, and all manner of sexual behavior, until climaxing on a note of near-metaphysical grace.
The slow accumulation of detail, from both the riveting cast and the gorgeous landscape, along with a visceral sense of real life rare in movies, give Y Tu Mama Tambien a curious cumulative power. One moment it's simply a moderately entertaining road film with an immoderate amount of onscreen sex...minutes later its raising the hairs on the back of your neck as only uncanny art can.
In the end the film is as sad and beautiful as the vanishing landscape it portrays. Not to be missed.",1047168000,8,874,4.9523809523809526
1447454,5,B00005JL57,"Often described as one part buddy-film, one part road-film, and one part coming-of-age film, Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN offers the story of two teenage wannabe studs who coax a slightly older and somewhat more sophistocated woman into a road trip to the beach--never dreaming that the woman might have a personal agenda of her own.  The premise is hardly an original one, but in the hands of director Alfonso Cuarn and a truly remarkable cast the result is absolutely astonishing.
As a number of people have pointed out, Tenoch (Diego Luna) and Julio (Gael Garcia Bernal) are not entirely likeable characters: they are thoughtless, self-indulgent, crass, and rarely think above their belts or beyond the next joint.  But their encounter with Ana (Ana Lpez Mercado) will shake them out of their adolescent-inspired sense of superiority in more ways than one: as their friendly rivalry for Ana's favors escalates into open jealousy, their revelations demonstrate that they are no less hypocritical than the pompous and corrupt adult society against which they so pointedly rebel.
The film is unexpectedly satirical, neatly adopting a ""boys will be boys"" smile and then quietly but sharply undercutting it by transient images of poverty, decay, and death that the trio encounter as they move out of their rather sheltered existences in Mexico City and travel the backroads to the sea--images that the boys ignore with a youthful zeal but which foreshadow and then underscore the series of punches the film delivers at its conclusion.  The cast is impressive, with Luna and Bernal the very image of thoughtless, vulgar youth, while Mercado is remarkable as Ana, a woman in her late twenties who seems to be fleeing from a faithless husband and seeking revenge in casual sex but who secretly has a still more weighty motive behind her actions.
The film has a great deal of nudity and sexual activity; there is also considerable drug use and profanity.  A great deal has been made of that, and particularly of the intense kiss between Luna and Bernal--but ulitmately Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN is less about sex, drugs, and youthful excess than it is about responsibility in relationships and how failure to keep trust can have devastating consequences in platonic, romantic, and sexual relationships.  The DVD package is quite nice, with several interesting bonuses, and although the subtitles are in white they are easy to read.  Overall, an impressive film--but one perhaps best viewed by middle-agers with some perspective than by the youth it satirizes.  Recommended.",1047081600,10,2548,5.095923261390888

The whole film is narrated POORLY by some guy who's voice was slowly but surely putting me to sleep.  We could win any war if we just broadcast this film to the enemy prior to invasion.  Besides that, the two guys were just annoying, and clearly not very loyal to each other.  What the hell kind of friendship do they really have?  They both sleep with a woman, perform TERRIBLY, and then get mad at each other for it?  Thats what the fools wanted!  Ok, yes, they did bad things with each other's girlrfiend's... but that could be worked out easily enough.  These guys must have hated each other from the beginning of theirfriendship.  And the woman they both left unfulfilled?  Oy.  The ending of this film is worse than the ending of AI.  I was waiting for someone to just burst in and kill all of them.

I admit that this tale begins with a couple of young girls with the kind of shape that pleases a male audience.  That they were less than scantily clad certainly got my attention.  After that, the movie dwindled into a road movie where the two girls are off to Europe and their less interesting boyfriends engage in a road trip to the beach.  Now, I didn't think Mexico was that wide, but this beach trip takes forever and these main characters don't get any deeper in their conversation.  It amazes me that some foreign films get so much attention when there are some truly good ones out there.  El Mariachi is practically a classic.  There is a commentary in Spanish but I don't speak enough to understand it.",1046736000,7,802,4.605633802816901
1447457,3,B00005JL57,"Watching 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' reminded me of books I used to read about film-making and the done-to-death techniques new film-makers use so that their final effort is somewhat of a coherent piece of work. This film is one of those oddities that both insult you with its' cliched use of the cinematic medium, and at the same time inspire you with its' tale of young love and hopelessness. Any art-house or international film viewer will find it hard to dispel this film as either 'garbage' or 'a masterpiece'. To me it is neither, which is a pity because the blurbs looked so promising. Then again, they said very good things about 'The Life of David Gale' and look what happened.
The story, which has many Mexican-born individuals feeling mighty insulted, is almost non-existent, except that we are treated to the escapades of two young boys and an older woman who choose to drive their car through picturesque Latin America without so much as a care in the world. While this leads to some interesting situations and dialogues, it is hardly uplifting, and I suppose any film critic who loves Carne or Truffaut would balk at some of the drivel presented here that is intended to be 'artistic'. None of it really is, even though there are some grogeous shots of the sunset and overtops of water bodies.
The young actors are indeed very talented, yet even they look disinterested in patches. Perhaps this has more to do with their characters, but it all leads to a feeling of tediousness and uneccessary melancholy, none of which I quite appreciated. To some this may qualify as marks of a stunning new film, but 'Y Tu Mama Tambien', while somewhat involving, lacks any new spirit or sense of beauty that is present in so many other Mexican films. Even English language films dealing with the Mexican experience, such as 'Frida', seem to know more about conveying the true sense of the culture and the Latino way of life.
The DVD on the other hand is both well designed and easily navigable. The 'deleted scenes' make you realize that you hadn't missed much, as most of it is just gratuitous sex without actually showing any skin, which may work for some viewers. The commentary is solely in Spanish without any English subtitles, so if you don't speak the language, this feature is useless to you.
Mildly recommended. This film definitely wasn't worth the hype though the climax made you sit back and think for a bit. However, considering that the ending of 'Dumbo' made me do the same thing, this isn't much of a recommendation, or a good thing.",1046563200,6,2543,4.7040358744394615
1447458,4,B00005JL57,"Y Tu Mama Tambien is overpraised.  That said, it is a very entertaining, predictable road movie set apart from many others in the genre by the excellent acting (way ahead of the boys in this aspect is their older road companion played by Maribel Verdu), often funny dialogue, interesting use of voice-over, loose storyline, natural light cinematography and, as all reviews note, frank treatment of sex.  The boys are goofy, hormone-driven, feckless, and idiots, as they themselves agree at one point in the movie.  In other words, exactly like a Blink 182 CD, lots of fun.  The film's attempts to make a statement about class in today's Mexico, while sometimes subtle (e.g. when the road trip goes by the native town of Tenoch's nanny from his birth and he says nothing to his companions), do not -- for anyone familiar at all with the country -- really add the deeper dimension director Cuaron apparently wanted.  No viewer should be surprised by any of the twists here, least of all the road trip ending or the revelations in the coffee shop coda.  Enjoy the ride, but don't fall into the trap of thinking this is a movie for the ages. The boys learn a little, as adolescents do in jolts and stages, and we get a good, bittersweet show.

Y Tu Mama Tambien suffers from no real plot other than two spoiled brats waiting to get laid and stoned. If the film isn't insulting enough then try the degrading Spanish only pathetic attempt at a Director Commentary section. Don't expect the director to give you any insight into this stink bomb just be forewarned that the actors continue to talk trash about the female protagonist's body.

1447521,5,B00005JL57,"""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" is a triumph for Alfonso and Carlos Cauron.  Their Oscar nomination for best original screenplay is richly deserved.  No Hollywood film in my memory has nailed the teenage experience quite the Cauron brothers have here.  You never get the sense that Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna are acting.  Guided by the writers' pitch-perfect, teenage dialogue and Alfonso Cauron's expert direction, these guys are the living embodiment of the term ""raging hormones.""
I love the scene where Maribel Verdu's Luisa leaves her house to meet the boys for their road trip.  As the car honks outside, Luisa grabs her bag and heads downstairs.  Except, you don't see that.  Instead, the camera slowly pans away from the chair and lazily makes its way to the opposite window.  Once there, you catch a glimpse of Verdu hopping into the car.  But, before you get to window, Cauron traverses an entire wall filled with pictures and knick-knacks representing a pastiche of the life Luisa has shared with her husband.
The message: this is potentially what she's going to leave behind.  It's a message delivered *so* subtly and skillfully that, well, frankly its a spine-tingling moment.  Because not only is it great moviemaking, it's a sign of the measure of respect the director has for the intelligence of his audience.
In short, this film is sheer magic.",1045785600,5,1356,4.929515418502203
1447522,5,B00005JL57,"I can spare the gentle reader many details, as I am sure they'll glean the overall plot structure of the movie from the numerous other reviews here.
I think this movie spends its time toying with the thin line between love and frienship.  But, in masterful fashion, you're never shown this as the author's or director's intention.  Instead, we are made to appreciate the main characters...who are easy to identify with.
These 2 'boys' are on the verge of being legal adults.  Their pursuit of an older woman, introduces a voice of reason to their common adolescent antics.
Ultimately, they allow childish jealousy to create a veil of contempt for each other.  The ensuing rollercoaster of events brings adult viewpoints into their lives...literally strangling away the loosened threads of adolescense, leaving them with the taught constricting tapestry that is 'society.'  And, it happens so fast as to leave the viewer wondering what had just happened.  Unfortunately, you know what just happened...and you feel the same emptiness that the characters happen at the same time.
I likened it to The Sixth Sense (M. Night Shamylan), in terms of the ending.  Mainly, because the story is woven in such a way as to titillate while you are being made to care about the characters.  You assume something will be happening throughout but, when it does, you didn't expect it at all...and then, it twists yet again to leave you sitting there in awe.  In the end, the events happen quickly and briefly and they make SO much sense, that you are literally left stunned that you didn't actually see it coming.
I'll draw from another review to succintly describe my feelings as the credits began to roll.  (paraphrased) ""The author and director paint upon a canvas as we watch.  When they are finished, we are left with the beautiful work, framed and silent.""
The acting in this movie is absolutely incredible.  Continuity left a bit to be desired, as their trip to the beach takes days, and nobody ever discusses anything regarding the trip itself.  Yes, there's a lot of nudity...but I'll simply echo the common dismay at American puritanical cinema.  No, this isn't American...but I had to buy the unrated version separately, since I didn't know we had to [alter] the original to make it...uh...'safe' for American's to view.  :)
I strongly recommend this movie!!!  Get the unrated version if you can though.  Movie ratings are not required, and often result in robbing the viewer.
I watched this movie 3 days ago...and I just can't get the ending out of my head.  It really makes you think, and reaffirms the melancholy of having society's mandates negatively affect us.",1045440000,6,2659,4.910514541387025
1447523,1,B00005JL57,"A profane, vulgar, irrelevant, irreverent, distasteful, and (worst of all) ultimately boring film that is part buddy flick, part road movie, part coming-of-age drama, part soft core porn and totally a waste of time.  Two seventeen-year-olds on the cusp of manhood embark on a trip to a non-existent beach in Mexico accompanied by an older woman who is married to one of the boy's cousins.  Along the way, the boys confess they have slept with each other's girlfriends; then they each have sex with the older woman; then they sleep with each other.  Oh, yah, the guys also do some drugs, masturbate into a swimming pool together, discuss the size of their genitalia ... you know, regular teen angst stuff. Oooo, and the older woman, she has like this, you know, totally tragic bummer of a secret that doesn't come out until (yawn) the end of the movie.  All this, and an omniscient narrator, too, who frequently interrupts the soundtrack to point out ""significant"" facts and reveal the eventual fates of minor characters, etc.  In addition to the semen in the pool, there's also lots of on-screen urination, some blood, even some vomit!  Yep, when it comes to male bodily fluids, this is one movie that has it all.  Ssszzzzzzzzzz ....
If unappealing characters spouting gutter language and showing off their unattractive bodies is your thing, go ahead and have a look.

With their girlfriends going on a trip to Italy the two young men are free to travel any where,  possibly to sow some wild oats. They agree to invite Luisa (a sexy, experienced woman in her late 20s who wants to get away from her womanizing husband) along on an auto trip to a fantasy seaside paradise which they inventively name ""Heaven's Mouth."" The film is often reminiscent of the Francois Truffaut classic ""Jules and Jim.""
Tenoch and Julio are at the stage of their lives when they are just about to relinquish their boyhoods and finally enter manhood. Luisa acts as the catalyst (often, but not always sexual) for their putting aside their childhood rites, including their rivalries and jealousies, and to learn what it means to be adults. They also inadvertently learn some interesting things about their friendship.
The film often includes background scenes which show the sufferings of the less fortunate of Mexico. There is a wonderful and often humorous subplot of our trio meeting a proud fisherman and his family who have dreams of economic betterment. Current political events in Mexico also plays an important part in the film. One of the boy's father is an appointee in Mexico's ruling government. A voice over narrative throughout lends to the film a dreamy, story-telling quality. The film's bitter-sweet, but very poignant finale should be recognizable to any one who has ever grown up.

1447528,5,B00005JL57,"On the surface, Y Tu Mama Tambien is a road trip movie. The plot is formulated around two teen boys' and one woman's expedition to a fabled, secluded Mexican beach. The movie carries a good sense of humor like most American road trip movies, but it is not a strict comedy-genre piece. There is an overwhelming realism about the two teens that is often overlooked in American films about adolescence like American Pie or Scream, for instance. They are not characterized by a single role or stereotype and their personalities are realistically conflicting: they fight, make fart jokes, ignore their surroundings, and have moments of real compassion and incredibly mature perception. The Spanish woman that travels with them is also a brilliant characterization. She is incredibly honest and [] liberated. The interaction between this woman (who does not pretend to embody a childlike innocence) and the two teens is revealing and refreshingly uninhibited.
Y Tu Mama Tambien is really two parallel stories. One is of the road trip of the upper-middle class teens and woman, the other is of the landscape and people that they encounter. There is a voice over during the film that briefly explains the background and/or future of a specific setting. Some of the most interesting storyline happens in the background of the trio's expedition.
Y Tu Mama Tambien is a worthwhile piece. It is a lively portrait of adventure and human interaction. It deserves praise for its fearless representation of what life is really all about: ""to love [] and life!""",1041897600,23,1544,5.03515625

Intimate moments lead to bitter anger and resentment.  It's a suprising film and the characters seem very real.  They spout some philosophy that kids their age will do (the woman is always the mature center though) and there is also sexual discovery in this film that seems almost abrupt if you go not knowing what this film is about.

You have an idea about how this film is going to go when one moment, the two male leads are masturbating in front of one another while laying on diving boards at a swimming-pool and the next, following a pretty unneccessary ""money-shot"" into the water of the pool, the narrator begins chatting about some movie that's nowhere to be seen.
""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" is beautifully shot, well-acted, but ultimately frustrating in the worst possible way.
The ""plot"" consists of two recent high school grads who say good-bye to their two high school girls and move on to their next step. In the process, they meet a beautiful Spanish girl who is about ten years older than them and ultimately invite her to a beach that is supposed to exist somewhere along the Mexico coast but doesn't really exist at all. The metaphor here is too thick for words.
To watch the three of them interact while driving to the ""beach"" is fun but one gets the feeling that there was zero script and that the whole thing was improvised. Of course, nobody would ever KNOW this because the audio-commentary on the DVD is in total Spanish and even an individual who was totally fluent in the language wouldn't understand it because the cast and crew sound like they're speaking from an acoustic bathroom with a pillow over the mike. It also doesn't help that they seem to be drunkenly rambling and that's a shame because I really would have liked to hear the thoughts from the cast and crew.
Anyhow, for all the hooplah that surrounds this film, it really IS sexy...it's just that most of what is here is a juvenille and silly mess. The forementioned narration is TOTALLY off and at times, is SO separate from the film, that you actually wait for one of the actors to look at the camera and say, ""Shut up! That's not even what I'm thinking at ALL!""

Most small-timers and foreigners don't have the resources, and most big-timers don't have the guts to make such a compelling film as this one. Kids. Obsessed with kid things. Blissfully unaware of the events surrounding them. Learnig, or not learning, by doing.  A true coming of age movie. Oh, it better at least get best foreign film.

The sex scenes have a refreshing realism to them, there's none of the MTV-stylized fake glamour designed to titillate repressed American audiences.  It's just people being people physically enjoying people...nothing more, nothing less, no inhibitions but also no pretensions either.
Why no ""masterpiece""---poor film editing makes for several slow and over-long scenes.  This movie feels longer than it is, just doesn't flow as well as another recent (much closer to ""masterpiece"" status) Mexican film, ""Amor es perros.""  That being said, the characters are brilliantly cast and you could do much, much worst than watching this movie.",1040860800,5,937,5.360544217687075
1447600,4,B00005JL57,"Great writing, great acting, great sex.  And the characters are all likeable.
I have very only a few complaints with this movie.  It has too many handheld camera shots -- the director retained a steadycam operator, but didn't use him at all! The film employs a narrator.  The narration is intentionally over _dead-silence_ -- i.e. the other audio is completely muted when the narrator speaks.  This is jarring to the listener, and is obviously a slap in the face of the classical use of narration.  These are bad, trendy filmmaking decisions which take you out of the story and thereby undermine its effect.
The narrator sometimes provides reasonable background information, but other times, for no good reason, he speaks of future events unrelated to the film itself.  For instance he speaks of how an undeveloped beach in the film will fall victim to the construction of an ""exclusive"" hotel.  These gratuitous political messages undermine the real value of the film: the depiction of a fascinating and tender friendship between two young men and an older woman.
One of the final scenes (a friendly discussion over a table in a bar) is pure magic.  I generally dismiss long takes as pretentious, but this one is so flawlessly acted and lit (and the camera is steady enough) that it makes up completely for the film's other flaws.
Finally, a wonderfully erotic film which doesn't cheapen sex, but instead gives you plenty to think about.",1040342400,2,1438,4.913223140495868

Has had sex with his best friend's girlfriend several times.  Has sex with his cousin's wife.  Likes to drive car while intoxicated.  Charming boy!
Julio: Another 17 year old beer-swilling layabout pothead.  Has had sex with his best friend's girlfriend several times.  (He reveals the first of these escapades to his best friend solely out of spite.)  Also has had sex with his best friend's mother!  And with his best friend's cousin's wife, of course.  Another charmer.
Luisa: 28 year old married adult woman who commits adultery by seducing two 17 year old children, both individually, then together.  Endorses the consumption of pot and copious amounts of beer by the children.  Indeed, permits them to drive while intoxicated.
Somehow this stuff didn't come through very clearly in the glowing reviews of this movie.  Instead, the reviewers talked about the ""innocence"" of the boy's sexual awakening and other such hogwash.  Am I being too judgmental?  Just imagine the outrage there would be if the sexual roles were reversed -- if it were a 28 year old married man fostering the debauchery of two underaged girls!  Why should the outrage be any less about this movie?

The trip through the Mexican countryside is visually fascinating, but the story is hackneyed.  I can't call this a coming of age story because it is hard to see how the boys would be matured by this escapist fantasy.  And do people really find this erotic?  It's all very predictable and has a ridiculously manipulative ending.  Hugely overrated.  But I'd love to see a grown-up movie in the same setting.",1039910400,5,617,4.710280373831775

Some nice touches on the directorial part. The naration is fluent and quite informative, by providing a glimpse into the future rather than telling you about the past. thumbs up here, as this is really adding to the story. The actors are also quite good.
However, I found myself at times bored - some of the scenes are just too long. The good parts - yes, the ones that are more erotic - are too few and far between. They are also not inspiring - check the sex scene in Thelma & Louise for example - it's less revealing and better than all the scenes in this movie together.
If you wonder what these include, they include 2 scenes between the lead characters and their girlfriends at the beginning of the movie, 3 scenes between the guys and the leading lady (2 a lone, and one together, including a kiss between the boys) and one more so-so cut scene. There are more scenes in the short movie of the director's brother which is included as a bonus - a nice touch, and in fact better than the main feature itself.

1447604,5,B00005JL57,"Y Tu Mama Tambien is a great film. The direction is snappy, heartfelt, natural, beautiful, and as the film goes on, what may seem like a simple story, a light-hearted road-trip, becomes something more, something which takes on a life of its own and transforms the mundane into something exceptional.
The three main characters, two sexually charged but well-meaning 17 year old boys, and a 28 year old woman dealing with the potential crumbling of her marriage, among other things, come together in a realistic intersection of excitement, tragedy, and lust as they embark on a spur-of-the moment road trip vacation, heading across the gorgeous Mexican landscape on their meandering way to a mystical, beautiful beach called ""Heaven's Mouth,"" which may or may not exist. (The boys, each smitten with the stunning twenty-something woman they have found themselves introduced to, have hastily patched-together the 'trip' (they had no such trip planned, but, as young people so often do, they put it together in no time flat, their spontaneity completely intact) as a chance to spend some time with the woman, though the real occurence of their intentions with her (romance?) is at best tenuous as they embark, considering she is married to the uncle of one, and is quite a bit older, in a different stage of life, to say the least. She is the slightly world-weary adult. This intrigues them, adds a level of mystery to her that their current same-age girlfriends somehow do not have. The film works in part by painting their desires and curiosities against hers. They are looking to her (perhaps without realizing it?) in some way for answers to questions in their lives, for what comes next, plus her experience (sexual and otherwise) must also intrigue them. For her, facing a crossroads in her life herself, they perhaps represent a lost freedom and innocence that she may want to reclaim for a time. Beyond all this too, this semi-seriousness, is the fact that each of them just wants to have a little fun. To have an escape, perhaps. From the familiar, from decisions (should she stay with her philandering husband? What career should the two boys choose? Should they stay with their girlfriends etc?), from familial obligations and for the two young men, from parental 'supervision' and influence.
The plot of the film, or what carries it along, is the fact that of course there are two of them, so the question is how could any romance between either one of them and her work? This 'plot' somehow in the end comes second to something else, something more bittersweet and nostalgic, a depiction of three lives at a moment in time so realistic it is almost uncanny.
Simply put, the three take a ""trip"" together, in more than one meaning of the word, and much as in life, once the period of time in their lives is over, neither of the three will be the same. The things they think, feel and do, the things they say to one another, their interactions, as well as the things they see on their way, the way little slivers of the lives around them on their travel get picked up by the three, and the viewers, by a sort of osmosis, make up the larger 'picture' here. The film itself at the beginning is like a pencil sketch, with the beautiful watercolor pigments slowly being brought in, one by one, as the moments go by, until, as the film ends, there is this full painting, framed and silent, that is worth a thousand words somehow.
What is it about the freedom inherent in these Mexican and Spanish and other foreign films that is so delicious? Whatever it is, the amorphous loose and languid quality is in full force here, to good effect.
Featuring some truly fantastic acting, great directing, music and locations, y Tu Mama Tambien is a stunner of a film, and I highly recommend it.
Speaking generally, the filmmakers here nail that amorphous 'something' that translates what could have been just another movie into movie-making magic. If you liked this film, seek out Sex and Lucia, from Spain. Each carries within it a world worthy of checking out and staying for a while, and, though S&L contains more fantastical fictionalistic elements, and YTMT is more of a reality-based, reality-feeling (almost documentary-feeling at some points), they both reveal what is magic about film-making, that indefinable ""It."" Looking forward to more by all three main actors, Maribel Verd,
Gael Garca Bernal, and Diego Luna. Enjoy!.....",1039651200,,4425,4.839050131926121
1447605,4,B00005JL57,"""The best way to summarize ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" would be to borrow some of Neil Young's lyrics which inspired the grunge generation: ""Better to burn out than to fade away"". The reference to Neil Young fits perfectly with the road movie genre anyway - and grunge fits in terms of subject and character with this film in particular. Moreover beyond the sometimes too easy sexual-teen-comedy (where full nudity and bodies getting laid are shown repeatedly) it is its real philosophy, and its genuine attitude towards life which make the movie strong and powerful. Not that the sexual content has to be thrown away, it's more the attitude towards sex which is new and interesting than the images seen too many times. The three main characters talk about sex, fart freely, and masturbate together (or each other) in a genuinely free spirit. This attitude is interesting and new. Another way to describe it would be to say that the words are more important in the movie than the images. These words and the attitude of the characters create the film philosophy which says: life is not much, enjoy it to the max as long as you can, you never know when it will end. The film says more elegantly: ""Life is like the surf, so give yourselves away like the sea"".
The only problem is that to be sure to attain his goal, Cuaron has a tendency to say too much in too many different directions: a social context mixes with an analytical (too analytical) voice over -- the past mixes with the present, our characters mix with other people's life (which are not in the movie) and finally a last twist at the end (which would be unfair to describe here). All of these were maybe not necessary and clutter the film with a feeling of ""too much"". The talent of the director and moreover what he has to say about life were strong enough to keep us captivated until the end. Anyway it remains a very strong, clever and subtle film about sex... and life. Don't miss it."" By Phil Ed for [URL]",1039651200,3,1965,4.538028169014084
1447606,5,B00005JL57,"Y Tu Mama Tambien is a solid film about the bond between two teenage boys and how that bond is challenged when a woman comes between them. The two boys meet one of their(unhappily)married female cousins at a family function and just on a whim the boys ask her to join them for a week at a remote beach. To their surprise she agrees.
One thing that keeps the story interesting and gives it its unique perspective is that the movie is spiced throughout with little narrative asides which comment on the course different lives take. The boys are young and full of energy and enthusiasm. The slightly older and very sexy cousin at first seems like the summers big score but soon the boys are at odds with each other as they each try to win her attention and then they are odds with each other when they must confront the ""truths"" of their own friendship.
As the movie progresses the two boys story of innocence and the end of it is contrasted with the cousins story of experience and her desire for a last taste of the innocence the boys will soon be losing. The film feels very loose and free capturing the boys in moments of fun as well as moments of conflict but it is very well constructed. Many films try to capture youth and never seem to get it right but this one gets both the passion and the pain of being on the cusp of adulthood just right. It also gets the pain and passion of early adulthood just right as well as the cousin and her unique situation and how she deals with it is just as memorable and central to the film as the two boys story is.
It has the feel of a light and breezy comedy in parts and yet in other parts it offers the insight associated with a serious drama. A rare and honest and bold study of what youth feels like. Very nearly a perfect movie. And a great soundtrack. And great cinematography. And yes it is very very sexy!

Beneth that, there's a truely great coming-of-age story.  While that sounds really cheesey, it avoids all those cliches made popular by American coming-of-age comidies like ""American Pie"".  There is real heart in this film.  The characters are quite loveabe, espically the female character (who's name escapes me) who has some very meaningful and loving things to say.  The ending is very sad though, and while I'm not spoiling it for you, it's a double-whammy (i'm sure I spelled that wrong).
The theme is blended in well, about how being overly compeatative can prevent you from seeing and experiencing life.  Frequently, the female character will be talking to someone about a very important issue, and the boys will be in the background, playing fooze-ball, or football.

Now imagine a road trip movie, but one with intelligence, sensitivity, and depth (in addition to the usual sex, drugs, and rock & roll).
Got it? You now have the foundation for a delightful, thought-provoking film-- Y Tu Mama Tambien.
I really loved this film. It perfectly captures the coming of age adventures of young men. There is only one thing on the top of their minds, and this film gives a realistic, frank look into those minds. The sub-plots deal with deeper issues: friendship, honesty, trust, commitment, betrayal, sexual identity, death, memory, class, Mexican culture, and politics- all blended into a delightful, beautiful film.
Julio and Tenoch (Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna) are superb as the raging-hormoned 17 year olds. They mix machismo, sensitivity, recklessness, teen stupidity, and soul-searing, life-changing discovery. As the older woman, Maribel Verd, Luisa Cortes shines. She is gorgeous, frail, emotionally shattered, strong, in control, and teaches the two young men about the richness of sex.
There is a LOT of sex in this film; after all, it is about two seventeen year old boys, on a road trip with a gorgeous older woman whose husband just confessed to infidelities. Maribel Verd has reason to experience new sexual adventures; she talks intimately and frankly with the boys about sex, and Julio and Tenoch are willing students. Director Alfonso Cuarn gives us a view of real sex, raw sex. The film is frank about the psyche of teenage boys-- a lot of talk (and action) related to self-gratification and sexual acts of all sorts. But it is handled differently from most American teen sex films: not the brainless, sniggering, puerile portrayal but rather the naked facts of life and love. If you are offended by such frankness, this is not a film for you. But if you would like a film that directly and beautifully deals with the subject, you will love Y Tu Mama Tambien.",1037750400,37,2138,4.9748603351955305
1447660,1,B00005JL57,"Road trip?  Sure, but really no one matures--at least not that you can tell  Sex-crazed adolescents?  Absolutely, but you see those all over these days.  Sad?  Well, by the end I really didn't care about any character (except maybe the pigs).  Hilarious?  No, although I laughed at the beginning.  Sexy?  Not really, but you do see some skin.  [I agree with the reviewer who thought more salaciousness would have helped this picture.]
So the guys are obsessed with sex.  They don't change their behavior and it's really hard to figure out what the director or writer are trying to say.  Well, they do learn that they are both like to have sex with the other's girlfriend.  I didn't gain any sympathy for them in the end.  [The kiss at the end made me hopeful that something interesting might come out of it, but in the end that fails too.]  All in all, rather standard fair.
And what can I say about the Spaniard?  Is she any better than the boys?  Not that I can tell.  Personally, I could imagine any number of better ways to live one's final days, but playing into adolescent fantasies really does not top the list.  In fact, it doesn't make the list.  [OK, going to the beach would be there somewhere.]
Oh, and the narrator.  Poor device.  The rule of any good story: show us don't tell us.  The exposition just serves to keep the director and writer from having to actual develop a well-thought out scene.  And getting insight into Mexico.  Well, I have my doubts.  I thought the visuals of the film (particularly the contrast between middle-class Mexico City and the rural areas) were good enough.  And each time the narrator was about to speak, I thought the sound had gone out on my TV.
About the cinematography.  Excellent.  In fact, I think you could turn down the sound (and in my case turn off the subtitles), fast forward through the acting bits and just enjoy some of the wonderful images.
I had heard about this film from a lot of people.  Most loved it.  I wasn't going to go that far because I've been burned by ""art"" films before.  So I didn't expect much.  Unfortunately, even that was not delivered.

1447662,5,B00005JL57,"This film could easily have turned into a typical coming-of-age story peppered with farcical sexual episodes. But under the masterly direction of Cuaron, the story of the two teenagers and one woman who bring them into the adult world through her own mortality becomes something magical and enthralling. The film is an ardent paean to life - it extols the beauties of youth without sentimentalizing or belittling it. The sexual urges of the young boys, and the terrible forward-moving current of them, are lovingly told. What sets this film apart from other movies are the specificities. The masturbations scenes, the funny manifestos these boys write for themselves to keep their friendship, etc... all these things are utterly believable, and real. This makes the climax and the denouement of the movie more heartbreaking and effective, because the passage of youth into adulthood tears down the beautiful romanticism of their youths, and the viewers are reminded of the universal rite of passage, when beauties of every youth must give way to a realization of inevitable mortality. This is universal filmmaking at its finest.
One of the most interesting features of the film is the narrator's side-comments. Seemingly these comments don't seem to matter directly to the story as they touch on the tangential elements and characters of the movie. But as these accumulate, and in the context of the main thrust of the movie, the narration always intimates that there's more life than what's immediately depicted. By commenting that there's a teeming world beyond the main storytelling, the filmmaker is reminding us of the breathtaking fullness, joy, and sadness of the world that's around us.
It's a relief to see films like this made. It bodes well for Mexico, as the country continues to make unbelievably good movies. I hope the shameless commercialism and blandness that pervades the movie market in the U.S. don't infiltrate that country and the artists that make these films.",1036972800,25,1983,5.161490683229814

1447736,4,B00005JL57,"The director Alfonso Cuaron is probably known for his two works for Hollywood major studios, ""Little Princess"" and modernized ""Great Expectations,"" both of which can boast the fresh, beautiful photography.  Now he goes back to his roots, Mexico, to make another beautiful film about the two boys and a woman who hit the road to ""Heaven's Mouth,"" the most beautiful beach in the world.
The two leading Mexican boys Julio and Tenoch, both after graduating from high school and their girlfriends in Europe, have nothing to do except smoking marijuana and enjoying a wild party.  Then, at the wedding party of one of Tenoch's relatives, they encounter a beautiful wife from Spain named Luisa, who is years older than them, and seems to know much more about life.  Though she is quite out of their league, the boys invite her to the road trip to ""Heaven's Mouth,"" fictional beach they created to interest her.  They thought it failed until later they receive a call from her.  She says yes.
And the travel starts.  Luisa has her own reason to go with the boys, but it is not my job to reveal it here.  The film follows their trip to the beach, and the events surrounding the developing relations between the three people on the way are recorded with the realistic photography by Emmanuel Lubezki (behind the camera before with Cuaron's previous works), whose effective camera captures the beauty of the place in a French New Wave touch, being always spontaneous and still energetic and beautiful.
But the center of the film is these two boys, and it would be very hard for any of us to dislike their honest characters.  They are endearingly natural, and inspite of (or because of) their dirty words and wild behaviors, we come to be sucked into the situation surrounding them, which in itself is not particularly new and original, but anyway you like them both.  But some would say rightly that Spanish actress Maribel Verdu may be called the real star of the film, whose emotions are quite naturally conveyed to us, drawing the younger (maybe decade younger) boys to her.
But we have some warnings before watching.  The film has steamy, graphic sex scenes, which may be off-putting to some of the viewers.  Frankly I am still wondering whether or not Cuaron really needed these scenes, and anyway it is certain that if some director from outside Mexico, from America or wherever, should have made this film, he/she would be deemed and even severely criticized for describing Mexicans as stereotypes, just the way some of Latin actors/actresses are treated in Hollywood.  But we know Mexican people loved it, making the film a huge commercial hit in there in 2001, so director Cuaron made a point, I should say.
But to me, the most fascinating side of ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" is not the road movie aspect or relations between the three, but the fact that the film, with its unique narratives (occasionally cutting into the story ... another New Wave trait), doesn't forget to mention the hard reality of Mexican society.  There is poverty, death, pain, and politics surrounding those apparently joyful kids, and at those moments we realize that we are watching the layers of stories at the same time -- the story of those boys, and possibly the stories about those who could not be them, or who are living behind them.  Perhaps only when we notice that fact, the film starts to be a really meaningful trip to the heart of Mexican culture.",1035676800,2,3429,4.760539629005059
1447737,5,B00005JL57,"Adult-themed movies are rarely made these days in America, the country which, ironically, is the porn capital of the world. The MPAA's rating system is confusing and often contradictory. No studio wants the dreaded `NC-17' rating because, among other reasons, many newspapers and TV stations won't carry ads for movies so rated. To me, it's a sad, hypocritical situation. Fortunately, other countries do make movies for adults. ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" is from Mexico, and, while its graphic depiction of sexual situations may seem startling to American audiences, it is far more honest, compelling and intelligent than its timid, childish American counterparts. [""American Pie"" is a perfect example.]
Two teenagers, Julio and Tenoch [Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna] are looking forward to the pleasures of summer. They've just graduated from high school, and their girlfriends are going off to Italy for an extended stay. After biding the girls a fond farewell, the boys set out to have as much fun as they can. At a fancy party, they meet Luisa [Maribel Verdu], the wife of Tenoch's cousin. The pair is smitten by the older woman. Impulsively, they invited her to take a road trip with them to a beach they know called Heaven's Mouth. She politely refuses. Later, when she catches her husband being unfaithful, she announces that she is ready to see the beach. [Her real reason for going is not revealed until the film's final scene.] The problem is that the guys made the beach up. Despite this technical problem, the trio sets out for the long drive to the ocean. At the end of the journey, they find a wonderful surprise. Along the way, Luisa teaches both young men how to treat a woman. They also learn other, more serious lessons about life.
On the surface, this is a comedic `road trip' movie, one of the best ever made. Beneath the surface, there lies a poignant, meaningful coming of age tale.
This lively, well acted and beautifully photographed film is highly recommended for adults but not for children, for whom it was never intended.

1447738,4,B00005JL57,"Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN is yet another example (like AMORES PERROS) of how the films from Mexico have a unique style that is maturing rapidly.  The pace of this tour de force of the effects of testosterone on young lads is breathless, so much so that the viewer yearns for the moments of stillness that do come and are all the more poignant for there role as relief.  Much praise has been heaped on this film and I think for the most part it  is well deserved. There is not the sophistication of the films from Spain, but there IS a sense of experimentation, go-for-broke effect that just feels right.  This film is graced by the beauty of Maribel Verdu (perhaps the fact that she is from Spain adds to her level of sophisication) but the gleam comes from Gael Garcia Bernal who once again, as in AMORES PERROS, reveals a young actor with explosive screen presence and who gives every indication that he is a star in the making.",1035590400,2,922,4.405882352941177
1447739,5,B00005JL57,"Of course, it's more than a ""road trip"" film, but the action does revolve around a long car trip to the ocean.  The performances by the three main characters are outstanding because they don't seem like performances at all.  The two guys talk the way real people do, interrupting each other, elaborating on something the other said, like two eager puppies trying to impress the older woman.  She does a brilliant job of transforming herself from a virginal and naive wife of one of the boy's cousins, into a self-sufficient, independent woman who no longer tolerates the boys' nonsense.
The movie shifts from being an exuberant celebration of youthful excess, to a more thoughtful and profound exploration of the nature of each of the three main characters.  The last 20 minutes are a surprising conclusion, but totally in keeping with the rest of the film.
This is definitely a movie that engages the viewer from the very beginning and does not let go until long after the closing credits.  I have found myself thinking about this movie much more than I usually do and am looking forward to watching it again very soon.
The video transfer is excellent, as is the Spanish Dolby surround audio track.  Subtitles are generally well done, with colloquial English translations that are reasonable equivalents of the slang that permeates the film.  There are very few extras on the DVD, but that's not really a problem.  A film like this stands on its own.",1035417600,14,1451,4.82258064516129
1447740,5,B00005JL57,"There is a moment in ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" where the film arcs from being merely great to classic. It's a scene towards the end of the film, when the three prinicpal characters let loose in a beachside bar with copious amounts of alcohol. Luisa, leaving the raunchy conversation, slides over to a jukebox, selects a song, and then turns to look directly into the camera. She stares momentarily, and the begins an enticing dance, beckoning us into the story, her story, their story. Suddenly, everything transcends the real, and we, the audience, become one with the film. For me, that will be a cinematic moment never to forget.
As I will never forget ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"". Part teenage sex comedy, part slice of life, part wonderful delve into the deeper sides of life, somehow it all melds into one amazing film. We first meet two late teen boys, Julio and Tenoch, who come from two different worlds, who manage to forge a complex friendship. They are crass, disgusting, drug abusing boys who are so full of themselves, so full of life, you fall in love with them immediately.
Together they schmooze the innocent Luisa, who, after discovering her husband had an affair while away, decides to take the boys up on their offer of a trip to an ocean. The three of them have a road trip of a lifetime, full of revelation, self-disclosure and real human moments. The film soon becomes more, so much more than a sex romp through the Mexican countryside, but slices of life that only this film has presented. It is bold, and real.
Bold and real, which may scare people away. The unrated version, which showed across the country, is the masterpiece which you should see. For once, theaters dared to carry an unrated film, and thus prove that the American public is willing to see movies that aren't cowtowed to a rating system that's marginally effective for parents trying to make judgments for their families, but the rest of adult American completely ignores. The fact that this film did so well, and is critically a sucecss, should bode well for the entertainment industry.
That issue aside, this film is life, and its real. If seeing life in all of its raw and uncensored moments bothers you, I suggest moving along and skipping this film. However, if you want to see a film I know is the best film of 2002, then check out Y Tu Mama. It's tagline gives us some more mental food to chew on:
""Life has its ways to teach us. Life has its ways to confuse us. Life has its ways to change us. Life has its ways to astonish us. Life has its ways to hurt us. Life has its ways to cure us. Life has its ways to inspire us.""

1447741,3,B00005JL57,".... Really. I _did_.
I am a longtime fan of international films and I _love_ a good comedy. Having heard some really great reviews of this movie, I was the first in line yesterday to rent it when it came out on DVD and then couldn't wait to watch it last night.
This morning I went back to the reviews that had recommended it just to make sure that I had watched the same film.
Now I am not saying that there isn't ANYthing here that is redeemable, because there is. There are some funny moments and some witty dialogue. But the movie, for the most part, is not as deep or as profound as the hype makes it out to be. In fact, it seemed to me to _avoid_ such areas, electing instead to stay pretty superficial and sensationalistic. It may tread deeper waters than American Pie, but that is not really saying _much_ by comparison, is it?
After I watched Y Tu Mama Tambien, I watched a short film called ""You Owe Me One"", also by Alfonso Cuarn, that was included on the DVD. It had many of the same elements of Y Tu Mama Tambien and was actually more humorous.",1035331200,5,1058,4.216748768472907

A road movie should contain some enlightenment for the characters and for the audience. And this IS a road movie, I don't care what other reviewers say. I found none. For everything the characters go through, you're pulled into it with them. This much works. Although I didn't care at all for the two male leads I grew to like them eventually. The female--Luisa--is on a sexual fling. She enjoys both the boys and finally brings out their attraction for each other. At this point I need to address the nudity and sex. It's there all right, but neither is enough to really hit home the emotions that will surface later. It comes off as trashy and teasy and that's not what is needed to give the gut impact we will experience later the full blow. I know this sounds ridiculous, but for once had a film's nudity been more explicit it would have worked in favor of the film as a whole. The characters would have been more realistic. It doesn't have to be as raunchy as it is here. Just frank and natural. I hope that makes sense. Anyway, the ending is one of the worst endings I have ever seen in a movie. It just ruins the whole film. It just bums you out. You don't want to watch the movie again because the ending's so bad and there's nothing else in the movie to rewatch because there's either not enough of it or it's not explicit enough. It sends mixed messages in every direction. I will not recommend this film to anyone. Period.",1035244800,13,1550,4.311643835616438

The film is another take on the old ""coming-of-age road movie"" theme, but it is slicky filmed by Alfonso Cuaron (who apparently will direct the third HARRY POTTER movie) well acted and thoroughly absorbing. Y' TU MAMA TAMBIEN manages to bring something new and refreshing to an age old movie tradition (I mean, this sub-genre probably began in 1969 with EASY RIDER)and deserves to be seen.

The sex comedy elements of the movie are likely to offend some viewers, but they are essential to the realism of the film. This realism touches on the sexual practices of middle and upper-class Mexican boys, the sexual malaise of well-to-do Mexican adults, the nature of friendship and trust, and the social and political climate of post-PRI Mexico.

The transition from boyhood to manhood is a favorite topic of directors, but often the subject is treated with sentimental extremes. It is rare to find a coming-of-age film that is neither heavy with drama (such as ""The Graduate"") nor reduced to nonstop slapstick ... gags (like ""American Pie"", which was an enjoyable comedy but certainly not art). ""Y tu Mama Tambien"" treads with ease the line between farce and melodrama. It sensitively but candidly addresses issues such as friendship, competition, social politics and the male ego while offering up a steady stream of laughs. Gael Garcia Bernal once again proves himself one of today's finer young actors on either side of the U.S.-Mexican border (and, in my humble, crush-tainted view, in the entire world).",1033084800,2,918,4.967532467532467

The sexual frankness and nudity may seem shocking to American audiences but, however crude, strikes one as a realistic depiction of randy adolescent obsessions. The shadings and ambiguities in the two boys' relationship with each other, as well as with Luisa, the woman, are superbly conveyed by the actors, making the unexpected climax, where their friendship takes an unforeseen turn during a three-way sexual encounter, credible, if no less breathtaking. Cuaron, the director, loads the simple plot with a bit more baggage than it can comfortably bear--a hidden tragedy, and detached narration with a distinct political bent that seems out of place.

Where the film falters is in the female lead character's fatalist tendencies that sends the film into a predictable spiral towards the second half of the film....

1447820,3,B00005JL57,"A friend of mine read a review of this movie in the paper, and didn't want to see it because it was described as being ""about"" two bored rich boys drinking beer, masturbating, making vapid crude jokes, and seducing a married twenty-eight-year-old woman, while going on a trip to rural areas that we never get to see in any cultural depth and which the boys don't seem to properly appreciate. (And that is indeed the plot, more or less, the paper didn't describe it comepletely inaccurately.) My friend said, ""who would want to watch that?""
But then, I finally saw it, and it was actually quite good. sometimes a great movie isn't ""about"" its plot. (The movie ""American Beauty"" sounds pretty unapealing when described just in terms of what events happen and in what order, etc, too-- and yet it is brilliant.)
 In addition to the above description, 'Y tu Mama' is also ""about"" what it means to these two teenage boys in urban Mexico to be men, how they constantly talk about sex in a competitive manner that really masks their sexual attraction to one another, and how this attraction eventually becomes aknowledged in some fashion during a long road trip ostensibly undertaken for the purpose of seducing an older woman (who herself has an interesting and sad secret).
Meanwhile, there is the occasional voice-over narration, which sounds like a combination sociologist/leftist travel guide, commenting on the areas through which the boys drive, sometimes with minute detail but without any depth-- which seems to serve the purpose of distancing us from the teens, reminding us that they really are spoiled, and that the rural areas are no more 'their culture' than they would be an Anglo United States resident's culture, and that real things happen in this landscape, regardless of what little happens to our 2 silly boys.
It's a cool film, and it's funny. I think its one main drawback is that the most appropriate audience for it, other teenagers, are probably not allowed to see it due to its lack of a ""rating"".",1031184000,2,2017,4.829479768786127

They do things, like talk about sex, go to parties, and talk about having more sex, that normal teenage boys do.  ...P>I took my friend to see this film and to my disappointment she dismissed it as porn with a plot.  It is so much more.  Few films are this complex on so many levels.  Yes, there is a lot of sex, but it is not erotic, in fact it is so realistic it is comical.  As young men go, these guys are far better lovers in their stories then in reality.  But again this film is not about sex.  It is about reality.  It is about social structure and social change.  It is about love and friendship.  It is about comedy and tragedy.  It is about growing up.  It is a relevation in this day and age of no substance film making.
One last note.  The performances are fantastic.  And the way in which Alfonso Cuaron decided to shoot the film, using lots of long one takes, only made their performances more impressive.  Cuaron has made a film that I hope will inspire a movement in the industry towards making more raw and honest films.  I was inspired.",1029110400,8,1369,4.256809338521401

Bored, and with raging hormones, they invite a slightly older woman on a road trip.  When she discovers her husband has been cheating on her, she agrees.  What follows is funny, bittersweet and filled with outrageous carnal experiences as they travel through a Mexico with wide social and political disparities.
Gael Garcia Bernal is cast as Julio, the rich boy who attends parties where there are more bodyguards than guests.  Diego Luna is his middle-class friend.  Both are excellent actors and their macho chatter and ribald jokes kept me giggling throughout.  Miribel Verdu is cast as Luisa, who joins them on their trip and teaches them a thing or two about life in general and details of eroticism in particular.  She is a sensual beauty and the focus of every scene.
There is also a voice-over narration, which points out details along the road such as accidents that happened several years ago or the place where a servant in Julio's home had been born.  All this is background for the three main characters though, whose joyful romp is filled with fun and erotic discoveries.  The dialog is explicit and real and the situations very human. It is not until the ending though that it all gets tied together, and, like the characters, I was sad and yet filled with a sense of completion and a deeper understanding of the fragility of life.

You can classify this movie as you wish - road movie, coming-of-age tale, may-december interludes, study of a woman in mid-life crisis, sex-starved youth meets lonely woman longing for love and affection  - but no matter what the tag is, it remains a masterpiece of modern cinema.
The three main leads (Gael Garcia Bernal, Diego Luna, and the amazing Maribel Verdu) all deliver knockout performances that led me to a rollercoaster of emotions culminating in two realizations: 1) that life is too short to waste and 2) that life's lessons come to you in the most unexpected situations.  Sure, there is sex dotted generously in this 2-hour film, but they are quickly outshadowed by everything else.
While I originally saw Y Tu Mama Tambien during the film festival in Venice, I was fortunate enough to buy a DVD copy of this movie in Hongkong (foreign movies in this format are released much earlier here) and add it to my growing collection of must-see movies.

1447873,3,B00005JL57,"Let me begin by making a confession: the road picture is not one of my favorite movie genres. In general, it seems to be an opportunity for laziness on the part of the filmmakers - characters meander from one location to another, traversing an overly symbolic path while wallowing in plot contrivances and stock character development... It's not as awful as some of the recent Hollywood trip tripe (Crossroads comes to mind), but it's far from a groundbreaking endeavor. It's often diverting and occasionally funny, but it's ultimately inconsequential.
It's summer in Mexico and teenage best friends Julio (Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal) and Tenoch (Diego Luna) are about to embark upon the adventure of a lifetime. With their girlfriends in Europe on vacation, the two boys are left to their own devices, and quickly become bored by the uninspired routine of an aimless existence. One day, while attending a wedding, they impulsively invite a stunning older woman, Luisa (Maribel Verd&uacute;), to accompany them on a car ride to a distant beach. Shortly thereafter, much to their surprise, Luisa telephones and says she would like to come. She has recently learned of her husband's infidelity and has decided to leave him, and the trip gives her an opportunity to start anew. So this odd trio- a sexually liberated woman and two horny teenage boys - end up on a journey that will involve booze, drugs, and sex.
Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n got his start in Mexico, arriving in Hollywood in the mid-90s...  However, it's also worth noting that Y tu mam&aacute; tambi&eacute;n depicts one of the most popular teenage male fantasies: going on a long trip with a gorgeous, willing woman. So this movie isn't necessarily more realistic than its Hollywood counterparts - it's just not as dumb...The two characters are driven by drugs and sex, and are only occasionally distracted by something of substance. Yesterday is a fading memory and tomorrow is less tangible than a dream. Today is all that matters. The more interesting character inhabiting Cuar&oacute;n's fantasy is Luisa, who has her reasons for being an unlikely companion to Julio and Tenoch. She has thrown off the shackles of an unhappy marriage for a plunge into the Epicurean lifestyle. There appears to be more motivating her than a surge of twenty-something ennui, but it isn't until the end of the film that we find out exactly what that is. She wants to do something different - to be vital, sexy, and wanted.
Y tu mam&aacute; tambi&eacute;n doesn't shy away from graphic depictions of sex, and there's plenty of nudity to tantalize anyone who gets tired reading the subtitles... Although he's not quite as explicit as French director Catherine Breillat (Romance, Fat Girl), there are times when he comes close. Y tu mam&aacute; tambi&eacute;n depicts full frontal male and female nudity, simulated intercourse, fellatio, cunnilingus, and masturbation. And there's a little homoeroticism thrown in for good measure. Cuar&oacute;n's frank attitude towards sexuality is in stark contrast to that of mainstream American teen movies, which reduce sex to something naughty and cute in order to achieve a PG-13 rating.
Those expecting Y tu mam&aacute; tambi&eacute;n to be a film of great significance will be disappointed. Despite being subtitled and having won raves at international film festivals, this movie doesn't deliver anything more dramatic than a road trip garnished with an aggressive portion of sex and nudity. It's well-acted, but there's not much in the way of a plot. Cuar&oacute;n throws in some politics concerning the economic rift between the middle-class and those living in poverty, but doesn't dwell on the situation or its ramifications. If the movie has a statement to make, it's that one can only live in the moment for so long (the epilogue emphasizes this).",1023062400,12,3845,5.142172523961661

1447927,4,B00005JL57,"In his last film, the Ethan Hawke/Gwyneth Paltrow remake of ""Great Expectations"", I felt like director Alfonso Cuaron wasn't able to fully spread his wings and use all his talents.  Hampered by the rigid structure of the book, Cuaron had to scratch and claw to get his beautifully arty shots into the film.  That particular tension doesn't exist here.  In tackling a road movie like this, one with a searching narrative, Cuaron is able to lead his camera into nooks and crannies as much as he desires, in order to find true cinema rather than just a movie.  One shot in particular stands out.  After enduring a lengthy conversation at a picnic table, the camera abruptly gets up and leaves, exploring the kitchen area of the restaurant.  There it finds a gaggle of old washerwoman, dancing sprightly to the music playing on the radio.  It's a moment of pure joy that has nothing to do with the story being told, but doesn't need to.  Cuaron also has a fun time, during the many car scenes, letting his camera float from the car to capture crucifix imagery; one is painted on a rock face, another marks a grave.  The agnostic in me wanders if he's making a grand religious statement, i.e., the characters must bypass the cross in order to get to Heaven (or rather Heaven's Mouth, the name of a beach that doesn't exist... or does it?).  On the other hand, knowing how this all ends, maybe it's a condemnation of their nihilistic ways.  A movie that offers paradoxical interpretations through one dominant motif is just fine in my book.
Cuaron composes his scenes through a series of long cuts.  I've always loved this technique, for it allows the director and the actors to subtly build tension over the length of the take, and it creates a voyeuristic feeling in the audience.  Cuaron's actors never let the takes stray from the reality of the scene, and for a film dominated by two actors in their early twenties, that is saying something.

Gael Garcia Bernal plays Julio Zapata, and Diego Luna plays Tenoch Iturbide.  The boys are real teenagers: animalistic, horny, insensitive, passionate, stupid, etc.  But each is exceptional in his own way.  Bernal captures lower-class pride, but also envy of his richer friend.  Luna, playing the son of a man important enough to invite the President to his daughter's wedding, captures Tenoch's reckless and wasteful rebellion quite well.  The boys together are stunning, ably showing the close bond that Julio and Tenoch share.  In the beginning they are asked to play scenes that at first strain all credulity (lying next to each other on diving boards, pants down by their ankles, I wondered, ""Is this how teenage boys bond these days?""), but given the benefit of hindsight, perfectly show the exact relationship that they share.
Maribel Verdu plays Luisa Cortes, the older woman who tags along with Julio and Tenoch on their way to the beach.  Luisa is a fascinating and complex character, much more than the buxom babe that she at first appears to be.  Maribel has to play several scenes where she is crying uncontrollably, and to her credit they never cross the line from stark to maudlin.  She also has to become the catalyst for the boys sexual reawakening, and she pulls off the desirability and sensitivity of this part of her character with stunning assurance.
The sex scenes, and there are four of them, are clumsy, energetic, graphic, and, well, quick (in a sense).  The film opens with an unapologetic shot of Tenoch in bed with his girlfriend.  She is leaving for Europe the next day, and Tenoch, in mid coitus, makes her promise not to ""[sleep with] any Italian guys"".  It is a perfect note to begin for a film as free and open and immature as this one.
That being said, most of the film's first third didn't work for me.  A clumsy narrator intrudes often to give the audience background information on each of the characters.  I'd prefer to be shown this kind of thing than told about it.  But eventually, the narrator settles into another function, one that amplifies the film greatly.  He starts to break into the action with talk about the characters' unmentioned pasts, then their unmentionable presents, and then their unknowable futures.  We find out that one secondary character, a fisherman, will soon be put out of work by the coming influx of commercial fishing companies; seeing this man, happy in his element while the audience knows his fate, is a heartbreaking moment.  The film becomes, then, just a snapshot of these people's lives, one that is affected by all that came before, and that truly affects all that comes after.  In some very surprising and extreme ways.  Be patient with the clumsiness of the beginning, for you will see that it was necessary when you get to the poignant end.  This is a fine film that truly gains power upon reflection afterward.",1020816000,22,4836,4.757793764988009
1447928,5,B00005JL57,"There will never be an American film like ""Y Tu Mama Tambien""--certainly not as long as the Weitz and Farrelly brothers hold sway in Hollywood. Alfonso Cuaron takes the basic plot of a Hollywood teen sex comedy--two rowdy teens take the woman of their dreams on a road trip to the beach--and makes something amazingly nuanced, powerful and moving from it. Middle-class Julio and wealthy, politically connected Tenoch are recent high-school graduates looking forward to a summer of hot sex and getting wasted. At a wedding reception, they meet Luisa, the sexy wife of Tenoch's older cousin, and spin a tall tale about Heaven's Mouth, the beautiful, secluded (and nonexistent) beach where they plan to spend their summer. Nothing more is said about this until--after receiving two very bad pieces of news--Luisa calls Tenoch and tells him she's coming with them. From then on, you get some traditional road-trip horseplay and sexual badinage, but also some things American audiences wouldn't expect, as the trip simultaneously fulfills Julio and Tenoch's brightest dreams and brings their illusions crashing down to earth. A trip that begins in youthful high spirits ends in lasting sorrow and painful self-knowledge. Throughout the movie, Cuaron has an omniscient narrator tell us facts Julio, Tenoch and Luisa never learn about each other; he also has a running commentary on characters the three pass on their way--poor and oppressed Mexicans who will never know the luxuries the protagonists take for granted. The political and class divisions of Mexico are a powerful undercurrent in this movie, adding to its sting and poignancy; the moment in which Tenoch and Julio finally turn their class resentments on each other comes unexpectedly, but inevitably. ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" is extremely profane and contains loads of explicit sex--it is emphatically not for the easily offended. But in delineating the narrow lives of his three main characters, Cuaron illuminates universal truths about human nature, with a touch so sure you'd swear that Chekhov had been transplanted to 21st-Century Mexico. Maribel Verdu (Luisa), Gael Garcia Bernal (Julio) and Diego Luna (Tenoch) are superb actors as well as being extremely sexy, and one hopes that more movies starring them will make their way across the border.",1020556800,53,2305,5.249322493224932
1447929,5,B00005JL57,"The subtitles aside, it's obvious from the very first scene of Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN that it's not a U.S. production. So, take that, MPAA!
Two Mexican teenaged pals, Julio and Tenoch, have just said goodbye to their respective girlfriends, who are leaving on a vacation to Italy. Now, awash with raging hormones as boys of that age are, they spend their time obsessing about...well, you know...and doing everything possible to keep their reproductive organs occupied. Soon, they meet Luisa, a ten years-older woman married to a distant cousin of one of our heroes. Apparently devastated by her husband's ongoing infidelities, Luisa impulsively agrees to accompany Julio and Tenoch on a drive across country to a mythical beach called Heaven's Mouth. Luisa genuinely wants to see the seashore. We all know what the boys want.
I'd better tell you now that, while Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN is exuberantly erotic, it's not smutty. Or, at least, it shouldn't be in the eye of the beholder unless it's been forgotten what life involves.
The film is, of course, a coming of age story. Luisa's unabashed and uninhibited sexuality puts a predictable strain on the boys' friendship as she tries, at times with great exasperation, to get them to set aside their adolescent callowness (and grow up, for Chrissakes!). But, while the movie is sometimes a comedy and very much a teenaged boy's fevered fantasy, it's more than that. Julio's family is of middle-class affluence, and Tenoch's is simply just rich. In their drive across Mexico, the boys barely notice the poverty and police presence so much a part of the country because their minds are elsewhere. But, the audience sees it, and is reminded of the economic gulf separating societal elements by the occasional voiceover of an unseen narrator. One particularly poignant incident involves the travelers paying a monetary tribute to a rural ""queen"" in order to pass a roadblock, a garland of flowers stretched across the pavement by poor villagers.
Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN doesn't rate the appellation of ""great"". The theme has been presented too many times before. But the humanity of it is intensely engaging. The boys, played by Gael Bernal and Diego Luna, are admittedly immature in all the ways that make even girls of the same age roll their eyes in disbelief. But they carry it off with such zest that it's impossible not to like them. And I can testify as a former adolescent boy that Maribel Verdu as Luisa could rightly be the centerfold of the most feverish daydream. However, her role goes much deeper. As the plot unfolds, the audience realizes that the ostensible reason for her leaving her husband isn't what's driving her. When we learn what the real cause is, we are left profoundly sad at the immense tragedy of it.
See this terrific movie, especially if you're the parent of a teen boy and you've forgotten what demons drive a young male of that age. This could be the best foreign film of 2002.",1019865600,178,2940,4.846918489065606

1447931,5,B00005JL57,"Alfonso Cuaron follows his two fine and individual literary adaptations - 'The Little Princess', 'Great Expectations' - with a modern, 'original' road movie that is more novelistic than either of them.  In the ironic mode of 'Magnolia', 'Amelie' and 'The Royal Tennenbaums', the very cinematic action is broken off by a parodically omniscient narrator who provides every scene with more detail than it needs, filling in back-stories, articulating feelings characters don't show, and even inventing futures for them.  But whereas this narrative voice in the previous films was a part of their breathless stylistic brio, here it performs a different function.  Each narration is announced by a breaking off of the action, a turning down of sound - rather than integrating itself with the overall tone, it breaks it, distancing itself from the comic antics, trusting the extraordinarily natural acting to keep our sympathy with the characters.  Though initially jarring, this device provides some of the film's most haunting effects, adding layers of perspective unavailable to young characters only living for the moment, but which may agonise them in hindsight.  Time and again, the film's narrow focus - two spoiled kids, who spend all their time joking,bragging about sex, drinking and smoking pot - is opened out to reveal different Mexican lives, lives not quite so privileged.  The road movie - the boys are taking their adulterous cousin's wife to a non-existent beach they drunkenly boasted about at a wedding - is a time-honoured vehicle for both a journey into one's developing, maturing character, and also into the state of the nation.  So while the Mexico the trio pass through is full of the colour and variety they patriotically boast of, it is also riddled with poverty, institutional racism, police brutality, and signs of death and residual superstition everywhere.  At a moment of supreme joy in the story, the narrator will intrude and tell us that such and such a character will lose his job and his home, or that someone died in a road accident etc.
This device makes us less guilty about enjoying the energy and the wit, the generosity and the hormonally volatile company of two brats, one very rich indeed.  When they are having fun, the film sparks with pleasure at life; when they are not, you become impatient with the film's sombreness.  These kids need to be well off - only they have the freedome of mobility to travel through the various Mexicos Cuaron wants to show us.  They also have the complacency that needs to be tempered.  But one of these boys is an inheritor of the Mexican elite - his father is a government minister once linked to a near-genocidal  scandal; the President attends the gloriously gaudy wedding of his sister, all bullfighting and mariachis.  The boys, for all their sexual exploration, are like two Presidential envoys, investigating and reporting from Mexico, while the real rulers swan off to Washington for conferences about globilisation.
Critics have compared 'And Your Mother Too' to 'Jules Et Jim', but the disenchanted political element is completely absent from Truffaut's film; a closer precursor would be Blier's Gerard Depardieu classic 'Les Valseuses', another road movie about two sexually obsessed young men who really want each other, and which casts a sharp eye on contemporary France.  The difference being that Cuaron cares about women, and his Luisa is a wonderful creation, her own zest for life co-existing with all kinds of pain, fear and betrayal only partially glimpsed through cracked windows by the boys.
'Mother' shares a continuity with Cuaron's previous films, not just in the theme of young people unmoored from their dubious parentage and heritage, and the bittersweet narrative development, but in his amazing use of space, his ability to turn the domestic and familiar into the creepy and alienating - look at the supermarket high-jinx suddently caught in a vast, alienating long shot.  His loose shooting style conceals immensely complicated compositions, framing paralell stories in the one sequence shot or image, to devastating effect, such as Luisa's break-up call to her husband while the companions she can see are reflected beside her playing foozball.",1019433600,22,4250,5.155523255813954
