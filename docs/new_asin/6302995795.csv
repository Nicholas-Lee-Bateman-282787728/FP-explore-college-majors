I simply LOVE this film. The Wicked Lady is another Dunaway film that gets better as time goes by. Filled with romance, sex, camp, over the top acting, badly shot scenes, however in this there is a fun, action packed story line. British humor is found throughout the film. Truly excellent film worth watching over and over again.",1283731200,3,384,4.579710144927536
532398,4,6302995795,This movie was intended to be tongue in cheek and not to be taken seriously. A lavish production with a good cast and Dunaway looks radiant. An interesting storyline keeps the action flowing in this highway robbery costume film.  Too bad it`s not on DVD.,1280448000,2,254,4.644444444444445

She later turns into a robber on horseback to gain more wealth & meets Jackson...another robber & falls in love with him. She later betrays him when she finds him in bed with another woman (Marina Sirtis) Highlight of the film is the catfight between Sirtis & Dunaway WITH WHIPS! (whoa!) I must add there's a lot of ""naughty cheesecake"" displayed with some ""very interesting"" bedroom scenes. (Hence the ""R"" rating.)",1055376000,14,553,5.087912087912088

532494,4,6302995795,"KINO LORBER are rapidly getting quite a reputation for releasing good quality hard to find films. Winner has his critics (and then some) but I can't help but find this remake hugely entertaining. I thought it was beautifully filmed, immensly overacted by Faye D, but I can't quite see anyone else in the part (she would have made a great ""Forever Amber""), with nudity abounding, violence (the ""Quote"" Erotic Whipping duel between Faye and an almost nude Marina Sirtis), sex (Oliver Tobias and Glynis Barber (body double?) in a very unerotic scene), and a plot that never stops so you can question any developments. Lovely stuff and 98 mins of ""adults only"" fun. The transfer from Kino is first rate, 16.9 ratio clear picture bright colours and good sound and SUBTITLES. This film is obviously not to everyone's taste, but if you want some rudish fun and you Like Faye, well you won't be disapointed.",1431648000,2,899,4.806451612903226
532495,3,6302995795,"Some remakes are remodels, with little resemblance to the original, and some are word-for-word copies. The latter is not uncommon with films made from plays, but less so when a film is reimagined decades after the first attempt. Surprisingly, the 1983 Wicked Lady could have been shot directly from the 1945 script - only a few incidental scenes. and fistfuls of nudity, have been added. And they share a common problem - how serious are they?  I believe the 1983 version was an attempt to duplicate the success of Tom Jones, a doomed enterprise without the charm of Albert Finney or the wit of Fielding. It has the same feeling of careening between drama and buffoonery. The original may even be worse, with broad acting and exaggerated facial expressions that were either a spoof of 19th C melodrama or a particularly egregious example of it. I found it hard to tell, but the context suggested the latter: tawdry sets (London in winter), awful day-for-night photography, and comical special effects (during the studio-shot horse riding, you wonder if the actors are going to fall off their chairs). The acting is competent, though, and sometimes excellent; James Mason so dominates his scenes he quickly became a star. The 1983 version, despite an impressive cast list, is terribly miscast. Denholm Elliott is too old for the role, Alan Bates (in Mason's spot) looks exhausted, and Faye Dunaway is hilariously bad (unless you want to be merciful and take it as a flat-out comedy).  It reminded me a bit of the Psycho remake; you realize just how critical casting is to success.
  The 1983 director, Michael Winner, was harshly assessed by Andrew Sarris in The American Cinema, but that was early in Winner's career and he redeemed himself later with some really good films, like The Mechanic. This project was a distinct retrograde step (or fall).  Like others who have posted here, I assume everyone involved was in it for Golan-Globus's money, but the heights of Fielding/Richardson were never scaled.
  Of course, the casting gods were kind enough to provide a fully nude Marina Sirtis, and, really, the film is more interesting as a rogue planet in the Star Trek universe, than as any kind of shining star in the principals'.
  If you are going to buy it, though, the small premium for the Blu-ray version is well worth it.  The photography, by the reliable Jack Cardiff, is the one jewel in the crown.",1430697600,3,2408,4.851219512195122

532499,2,6302995795,"Other reviewers are right - Michael Winner's remake of the vintage classic The Wicked Lady turns out more like ""Carry On Dick"" only with bigger star names.

I can only assume the film was intended to be a comedy, but it's hard to tell as the film wavers all over the place. Faye Dunaway and Alan Bates act like they are in an uproarious bawdy romp, but the rest of the cast play it straight. Faye Dunaway is particularly odd, she continuously pulls the most bizarre comedy faces and bugs her eyes out in an effort to portray the scheming and greedy personality of the lead character Lady Barbara Skelton, whose exploits form the main story of the film. There's definitely a juicy tale here, with Lady Skelton robbing, seducing, lying and murdering her way through the cast to get what she wants, but the presentation here really wastes the material. The events of the story are dashed through at great speed, giving the viewer little chance to empathise with any of the characters, but as most of the emotions are portrayed in such a throwaway manner, I certainly never felt drawn in. Again Dunaway suggests no depth to the character she plays. But the presentation of the action is the real offender. There's no time for anything to sink in. As soon as the film starts, Lady Skelton is stealing a man, then next minute she's married, then stealing, then tricking, all without pausing for breath

There are some things to enjoy, including the beautiful English scenery and antique architecture, plus some nice performances from Denham Elliott and Prunella Scales in supporting roles, but the smaller parts, such as bawdy waitresses and strumpets (of which there are many), are wretchedly hammy. There are many scenes of nudity, all of which look completely incongruous for the period the film is set in, and exist only for titillation.

To sum up this is a very juvenile film with little depth, and a huge waste of talent and money.",1405555200,,1932,4.72700296735905

532501,4,6302995795,"To mark the passing of Michael Winner and to celebrate the film's 30th anniversary, the time would now seem to be propitious to finally release this movie on DVD even if it's only a DVD-R as most older movies are these days. Of course it all boils down to who currently owns the rights. Originally made for the Cannon banner, most of those films wound up being purchased by MGM whose DVDs are now being distributed in conjunction with 20th Century Fox. There could also be a problem with the soundtrack by Tony Banks (of Genesis fame). He may be due royalties which the current owner of THE WICKED LADY doesn't want to pay. That happened to a number of late 1960s and early 1970s American International titles when they first came out on video. There could be many different reasons for the delay but whatever they are, they need to be worked out! If the film looks great on VHS (which it does), think of what a proper aspect DVD would look like.

The film was roundly panned upon its original release in 1983. The Brits hated it because they saw it as an unnecessary R rated remake of the beloved 1945 film with Margaret Lockwood and James Mason and the Americans hated it because they either didn't realize that it was meant to be tongue-in-cheek or found it too over-the-top for their liking. To criticize Dunaway's performance as overblown is to totally miss the point. Alan Bates, John Gielgud, Denholm Elliot and the rest of the cast are having a fine old time and the cinematography by Jack Cardiff (THE RED SHOES) is gorgeous to behold. There is definitely gratuitous nudity and the nearly X rated horsewhipping scene is truly outrageous but that adds to the overheated atmosphere of the film. It's either your cup of tea or it isn't but either way it deserves to be available in the digital format. Is it a fun historical romp or overdone melodramatic trash?

7833945,4,6302995795,"Just finished watching most of this older ""Faye Dunaway"" film about a wealthy high society English noble lady who marries into an estate, but finds she needs to obtain more money and thus becomes a horse drawn masked robber of the night while pretending her double life doesn't exist in front of her servants and the ladies of court.

  The film's shooting location, which appears to have been a mansion in Merry Old England, is absolutely fantastic.  I really enjoyed the scenery of the film including the lavish ball room set with the remarkable period costumes, and cheerful Christmas-Holiday scenery at the dance-wedding scenes.  The red uniformed police-soldiers in the old British depictions I really liked.  The only harsh and vicious scene is the whipping fight between Dunaway's character and the heroine played by ""Star Trek's"" Marina Sirtis, which is pretty graphic but outside of that I really felt the movie imagry wise was a gem. We have Faye Dunaway basically reprise a similar role she had played in ""Three Musketeers"" in this main villain.

 I also felt with that the R rating was far too harsh, and my standards are much different from the traditional and in my opinion way to over censoring American MPAA's opinions, where in other movies depictions of men shooting people with an AK-47 or stabbing other men are acceptable with a PG rating, but a film like this which has a few scenes of human sexuality automatically gets an R which in itself is insane. So thus for me I would have rated this film maybe PG or PG-13 because basically despite the violent and gruesome ending scene, I found nothing perverse, violent, or foul about the rest of the film at all whatsoever.

 I loved seeing the people in their 1700's British themed look, the enlightenment era of both Europe and America, and I found the jolly dancing and image depictions delightfully enjoyable for history fans.  So this old one gets a mild thumbs up, possibly for ages 11 and up but it is clear that probably only adults would be interested in seeing this one, kids & teens might be bored with it since the plot takes place in the far past.
