Dame Kiri takes us behind the scenes in Covent Garden.  We see the interaction between the opera singers and the conductor.
I enjoyed this DVD and Dame Kiri's presentation is excellent.  My only disappointment is that I would like to have seen and enjoyed even more. An encore would be nice.",1364860800,,429,4.545454545454546
8150293,5,B000JGWD28,"If I have one DVD of Dame Kiri Te Kanawa that would be on top of my shelf to enjoy, it's have to be this one.

I first saw  on TV  this in 1992, and love it a lot to have it on tape, but, this DVD truly the best ever!

It's mainly Dame Kiri's tour of the Royal Opera House put together with excerpts from various performances from the 1980's, most of them is on DVD. Kiri herself appeared in three excerpts, the 1982 ROH Rosenkavalier Trio, Klange Der Heimat from the 1984 ROH Feldermaus (as does the little clip from Act 3 between Forsch and the conductor, Placido Domingo) and the Act 1 Duet from the 1982 Verona Otello (She does tell the story of how the performance got barely overshadowed by the Italians' victory at the World Cup that night).

There are other excerpts as well, but the true star is Dame Kiri, taking a tour around the ROH (the Lobby, adressing room, the Convert Garden Record Shop, the Costume Shop and the Stage Door outside the ROH), telling about the various performances on the DVD.

All in all, this is one Kiri DVD (Alongside her 1984 ROH Feldermaus that I have on DVD, as well) that I would enjoyed the most.

Highly Recommended.",1161561600,23,1159,4.313364055299539
