555456,5,6303085547,"Although not a despot known to many, Shaka Zulu controlled an empire at the height of his power comparable to that of Napolean and was as brutal as Vlad the Impaler; this miniseries very succesfully shows his rise to power, relationship with British envoys, and eventual fall.

As the mini-series opens, a solemn South African representative listens to the British elite, including Queen Victoria, belittle his people and then begs them to let his people keep their sovreignty.  The series then flashbacks to the British embassy going to meet Shaka, running into trouble, and eventually earning his trust after an assasination attempt.  The series then flashbacks to his rise to power from a young boy to the most powerful man on the continent of Africa.  The flashbacks never get confusing, the story is always well told.  The cinematography is brilliant, the acting (especially by Henry Cele in the title role) is very competant, and the characters are very compelling.

The series has a little something for everyone, although I think it would appeal more to history buffs like myself.  In addition, there is substantial amounts of nudity, as most of the African women go around topless.  While the nudity didn't detract from the narrative or become gratutitious, it is something to think about before letting younger veiwers watch.

All in all i heartily reccomend this mini-series, whether for a really, really rainy day or an hour at at time after work.  8.5/10",1092528000,,1467,5.024793388429752
555457,5,6303085547,"AN ""EXTRAORDINARY"" FILM IN EVERY ASPECT OF THE WORD ! A 4 DVD SET UNLIKE NOTHING I EVER SEEN BEFORE, IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY. GET THIS MOVIE WHILE IT CAN STILL BE FOUND.",1067040000,11,168,4.121212121212121
555458,5,6303085547,"Empires rise for the sole purpose of cresting in the valleys of time, destined to always find a stumbling block and fall into the sea. From those that never see the setting of the sun to those rapidly built on the dreams and conquests of one man, this is the legacy of anything that rises to power. So has it been with many, and so it was with the birth of the Zulu nation and their prophetically foretold figurehead, Shaka, as they moved forward and conquered all.
The validity of this tale, well, that would remain something of a speculative tale since there are so many elements of witchcraft and prediction riddling it. Here, things that might have been mentioned briefly are accented to play out the 220 minutes of production, birthing a legacy of darkness and shadows. Still, as far as a tale adapted for television goes, it was brilliant and enjoyable to watch. Many of the elements that led to the myths of this man and the growth of his empire are included herein, from tales of a son that would one day slay his father and propel his people into power to those that spoke of how he would succumb. It covers the boy himself, his relationship with his mother and how they were outcast, and it shows him grow into something that was propelled only by the need for vengeance. Here, turns that could have prevented this from happening are showcased and the markers making him are defined, helping one understand his accent from nothing to a soldier to a feared ruler.
And it also introduces many people that know nothing of history to a name they should all know; that of Shaka Zulu.
Presented alongside this is the European side of the coin and what Shaka Zulu meant to it. It shows the overestimation of how expansionism into areas fueled by ""savages"" were, and how the cultures of those neighbors shared were actually more than the occupiers bargained for.
Seeing the Zulus as nothing more than barbarians, the British Cape Town establishes itself and survives with little to know interruptions. Then, out of the blue, the Zulus begin taking over everything. Tribesmen could be found running to the hands of the slavers, trying to avoid Zulu spears.
And that makes the British apprehensive.
Then it one day finds itself looking at a situation of enormous proportions, the Zulu close at hand and the white men knowing nothing about them. Added to this was the fact that the garrisons therein weren't equipped to deal with a force of that size, the journey for reinforcement is a four-month journey by sea, and they could find themselves overrun by then. So, an alternative solution is rendered, sending a crew of men out to negotiate and to showcase fear in order to provide a solution.
And thus begins a tale of gunpowder and magic, of chess and tactics, with groups of men from different worlds playing mental games of chess.
In the rendering of this tale I personally liked how both sides were shown as players trying to outmaneuver the other. More impressive than that, however, was the fact that Shaka Zulu was portrayed as a powerfully intellectual leader and not as an insignificant threat. Instead of falsely delivering a savage into our midst, the viewer is shown a world outside of the world that the Europeans knew, introduced to its continental customs the people that conquered it with shields and spears. Within those showings, the game of cat and mouse is played and the outcomes, they have more to do with internal afflictions than anything delivered by the white man.
It also covers the effects Shaka had on the way wars were fought, on the way people were encouraged, and on the impressive way that one man's mind functioned.
And then there's all the lovely impalings that begin to fall like rain, too.",1058140800,16,3727,4.691603053435115
555459,5,6303085547,"Shaka Zulu was by any standard an exceptional production.  The cinematography, script, actors and setting were all superb.  Henry Cele was extraordinary as Shaka and I can't imagine that there is an actor anywhere in the world who could have portrayed him any better.
The native settings and attire added greatly to the production.
The characters and performances were all top notch and the relationship between Edward Fox (as Farewell) and Henry Cele (as Shaka) was portrayed beautifully and powerfully. Drama at its very best.
This production is without doubt as good as anything I've ever seen on television or in the movies.
The DVD would have been greatly enhanced if post production interviews could have included Henry Cele.  He was truly the star of this series, and that's saying a great deal given the quality of all of the other performances.",1043971200,9,853,4.992957746478873
555460,5,6303085547,"It's refreshing to see the series in it's original uncut form. I bought this set, though, because it promised ""Interviews with director and actors"". Well, you get the director and you get Dudu Mkhize, who plays Nandi, but that's it. I was expecting to see at least a few minutes of the succulent Henry Cele (Shaka) talking about his experiences making this series, but I was sadly disappointed.
For those who are unfamiliar with the story, it tells about the legendary King Shaka, his rise to power and how first contact with the British forever changed the Zulu kingdom and it's people. There are a lot of supernatural elements in the story, but I have no problem being swept away, suspending my disbelief and enjoying the legend. The intrigue and disception that takes place at the royal court is much more ""down to earth"" in it's harshness and Shaka's cunning interactions with the British Lt. Farewell are powerfull and enjoyable. (Ofcourse Henry Cele's fantastic physique adds to my viewing pleasure too).
I would recommend anyone to buy this, it's great.",1039392000,17,1060,4.894444444444445

555740,5,6303085547,"I recently tv binged on this mini-series on Netflix. This South African production from the mid nineteen-eighties is epic. It is simply a fantastic story of the great and legendary King Shaka of the Zulu nation, who in the early nineteenth century united disparate African tribes into one indomitable fighting force. Shaka was a Zulu warrior unlike any other before or since, a brilliant militarily strategist and ruthless leader, and this is his story...and what a story!

It is also, in part, the story of South Africa and the fear which the colony of Cape Town had of attack by the Zulu nation. Refused  militarily troops  by the Crown, the colony sent  a small diversionary expedition of civilians led by a perceived eccentric, Lt. Francis Fairwell,  into Zulu territory to try and forestall any such attack. So, this is their story, as well.

The late, great South African actor, Henry Cele, is mesmerizing as the adult Shaka. He dominates every scene in which he appears and is simply outstanding in the role. Despite great performances by other cast members, including that of Edward Fox as Ltd. Stairwell,  Cele's is one that is simply unforgettable. The production values are also excellent, and the setting and costumes lend an air of authenticity of time and place. It is simply a terrific mini-series. I was spellbound.

Those who enjoy historical dramas should love this epic mini-series. I know I did.",1499558400,,1415,4.940928270042194

555746,5,6303085547,"This is a region B, South African TV series production centered in the Zulu controlled area of Natal of what is to become South Africa in the first quarter of the 1800's. The drama, and I do mean drama, concerns the effort of small party of primarily Englishmen to make contact with the native leader Shaka during the rise of Shaka (Chaka) of the Zulu nation. Great photography and engaging story telling. The portrayals are very realistic to my western eyes and contain some very hard edged brutality yet done as a legitimate part of telling this complex story. Clothing is time period correct with women bare breasted and men in loin cloths.",1495324800,3,643,4.699115044247788

(THAT'S A LOT OF MOVIE)  Not only that but the missing parts are the very parts of the story line that made it a great movie .  Another thing that should clue you to the real value of this version is Henry Cele who portrays SHAKA isn't mentioned in credits at all .  Without Celes' performance it would have been a movie with no class at all .

His mother's rightful place should have been with Shaka's father. The king of the Zulu nation. The king wasn't having that. After years of hopping from tribe to tribe, Shaka, his mother and sister finally got achance to take their rightful places as king Shaka and  his mither, Queen of Queens!! If you have never seen this movie, have an open mind and take a look at it. I have seen this movie countless times and I still watch in awe when Shaka tells his mother to take her place as Queen!! All those people who dissed Shaka's mother in the past, all of a sudden, had to bow down to her, that is if they wanted to live! I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!",1413072000,,817,4.203821656050955

My only criticism with this set is that they chose to change the musical lyrics to English.  Somehow it takes away from the soundtrack.  Though I had no idea what was being said in the original music, I didn't care,  it's sounded wonderful.  Now, not so much!  But, I continue to watch this series at least once a year.

556571,5,6303085547,"There are a number of extraordinary facts about this miniseries that jusitfy the claims of compelling and controversial made in the product description noted above. Arguably the most prominent fact is that SHAKA ZULU was produced when the country of South Africa was still firmly in the grip of the abhorrent system of racial segregation known as Apartheid.

For anyone who has forgotten what this politically-enforced system meant, stories like SHAKA ZULUwhere the central character is a black man who is seen to be a brave and intelligent (albeit flawed) rulersimply were not tolerated. The official (read white-enforced) view of Shaka as taught in South African schools at the time was that he was nothing but a tyrant, crazed and bloodthirsty, whose assassination was justified.

SHAKA ZULU is an eloquent, epic and extraordinary depiction of Shakas life as written by American writer Joshua Sinclair and realised by white South African filmmaker William C. Faure. The story of how SHAKA ZULU came to be made is only touched upon in the relatively brief interview with Faure that is included in this set. Without doubt, a documentary could be made recounting not only the circumstances under how the production came to be, but also exploring the lives of some of the key personnel, especially Faure and star Henry Cele. Faure died in 1994 and Cele in 2007. Its unfortunate they are not around to talk about what was clearly the most significant artistic endeavour of their respective careers.

However, lets be thankful for what we do have  this outstanding miniseries, remastered and available on DVD for your home-viewing pleasure.",1397433600,5,1637,5.119850187265918

I have loved the music over the years but haven't been able to find the original mini series at an affordable price. The $30  I paid was worth every penny. Henry Cele as the great Zulu warrior king Shaka Zulu steals this series. He is MAGNIFICENT. While his methods were brutal, he united the many Zulu tribes to become the greatest nation and most feared force in South African history. In the early episodes you come to understand how Shaka's vengeful nature developed. Sorry, but this story is truly about the Zulus, the English were interlopers seeking control and power over a perceived inferior race. What a surprise they found. Shaka outsmarts them at every turn. Unfortunately, as with many men of power he loses his way and after the death of Nandi, his mother, his anger and ultimate insanity nearly destroys his people. Loved, loved. loved the series.

He took a tiny tribe of little influence and turned them into the most powerful force in the African subcontinent.  His times were cruel and violent and he was a product of his time.  The leading part is exceptionally well played by Henry Cele.  This story is simultaneously a story of the painful and bloody rise of Shaka and the manipulation practiced by the Europeans to bend the local natives to their will, not always with the results that they expect, particularly with Shaka.  The 'complete' set in historical order should be Shaka Zulu, Zulu, then Zulu Dawn.",1371686400,,670,4.791304347826087

Or the fact that absolute power corrupts absolutely, which is why we have a constitution. How about the consequences of one's actions? Jealousy, revenge, treachery, peril, love.  Great stuff.  Oh, and one heck of a history lesson.
The acting is top notch. The settings and scenes are realistic and authentic. The story is told masterfully. You really feel as if you are seeing Shaka's life unfold in front of you.

556864,5,6303085547,"The story of Shaka is related based on Zulu legend and the diary of Dr Henry Fynn - as such, the actor who plays Fynn is also the narrator.

What I appreciated is a look into Zulu politics - yes, the native socio-political scene in Africa in the 1800s extended beyond savages running around in their birthday suits. The rivaly between clans reminded me of the Houses in Dune, and was dominated by themes of honour, protocol and strategy. Quite interesting was that pre-Shaka warfare was dictated by the notion that the less the bloodshed, the more succesful the tactic... and was more of a power-joust than an actual battle.

So this is probably not the most historically accurate TV series you'll ever see, but it's very entertaining. The existence and role of Pampata (Shaka's girlfriend) is highly debated; and although Fynn's diary does make mention of an authenticated pregnacy, it was most likely by another girl.

A bit violent, so not recommended for small children - but I would recommended it for people from an African background who yearn for a bit of pride in their roots.",1300320000,2,1085,4.76063829787234

557004,5,6303085547,"Shaka Zulu may not be the landmark miniseries Roots was, but it does offer probably the best production values of any miniseries.  Director, William C. Faure has a good visual eye for the African landscape. Unlike Roots, Director Faure explores the mythology of Zulu culture that frequently goes into folklore, much like the legend behind the Knights of The Round Table. Some history purist may not be enamored with this approach, but never-the-less it is entertaining. Some may also find the violence gratuitous and the nudity a little overdone.
Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the miniseries is the class of cultures between the British emissaries and Shaka. The British use their know-how to manipulate Shaka, but he is shrewder than they bargained for.  When the Irish doctor tries to introduce Shaka to Christianity, Shaka turns Christ's message into purely militaristic terms. He believes he can derive power from the British and their religion. To prove this he sends the British into a gully with cannon to fend one of Shaka's enemies. When the British succeed he is even more impressed with their knowledge.
I should point out this may be one of the most violent shows ever shown on television. There are scenes of impalement and grisly battle scenes. Henry Cele, playing Shaka, is also a very imposing figure. He is tall with a deep baritone voice, and one of the most ruthless lead characters I can remember.
Purists may not think this is a perfect historical drama, but it does cover the basic history of Shaka and his formidable army. Production values and music are at motion picture standards. This series has been featured on the History Channel.",1281139200,,1669,4.957142857142857

557070,1,6303085547,"Although this item is hyped as ""the complete 10-part television epic,"" anyone with an IQ above 50 can see that it is anything but complete.  First off, the set contains only FOUR cds, which is a huge clue that something is amiss.  The first cd begins with an epilogue of sorts, detailing the threat of the Zulu Nation to the British interlopers in Africa, and ends right after the shipwreck of Freewell's crew and the taking of the translator crew member by the Zulus.  However, cd #2 begins its narration talking about Nandi and baby Shaka's status as they relocate to another clan as if the viewers are already familiar with her and the issues surrounding her migration.  And, even though cd #2 ends with Nandi and her two elementary-school-aged children being accepted into another clan,  cd #3 opens with Freewell and his crew admidst the Zulus and a much, much older Shaka followed by the assassination attempt on Shaka's life.  At this point in the series I became thoroughly disgusted.  I had watched this series on A&E twice before and remember some of the crucial parts that were excised, namely Shaka's evolution as a warrior and leader, his influence upon the nature of warfare, as well as his subsequent rise to supremacy; in addition to the elevation of his mother, Nandi, and the initial meetings between Freewell and the other British interlopers...pardon me...crew members.  None of these things were included in this collection, therefore for the makers of this series to proffer it to the public as the complete collection is disingenuous at best and thievery at its worst.

557179,1,6303085547,"This series misrepresents the real Shaka as he has been recorded in the oral narratives of the Zulu people. Mazisi Kunene compiled these narratives in to the epic ""Emperor Shaka the Great,"" and it tells a much different story than the Brittish, who suffered their worst defeat prior to WWII at the hands of Shaka. I wonder what a miniseries done by them on George Washington would be like. Shaka was a genius of war and politics. He was a brilliant leader loved by his people and his legacy still lives but this miniseries is not it. It is clear that the filmmakers didn't see it necessary to consult with any experts the likes of Kunene, and instead relied on all the discredited accounts recorded by the Brittish. What a shame the revolutionary that defied Brittish imperialism couldn't be portrayed with the affection that Braveheart was. Clearly, the the filmmakers are just recreating the illusion they have of the Zulus and frankly it is racist. When will western people stop speaking for Africans and let them tell their own story. The real Shaka is much more inspirational, impressive and humane than this series is capable of depicting namely b/c it is a one side of the story masquerading as both sides.

For several years, I looked forward to this particular series coning on television every year - but like most ""good cinema"", they haven't been showing it in recent years. If they have - I haven't been able to find it.

So that's why about 3 years ago I started searching for it and couldn't find it in the traditional book/dvd stores. I was so excited when I found the miniseries here at Amazon - I put it on my wish list for Christmas:)

The acting is superb. The story makes sense and seems historically accurate. And the story is riveting. Not for the faint of heart, this is a miniseries that is for adults only.

557185,5,6303085547,"I spent my teen years in South Africa, so I really wanted to see this. When I was young my parents saw it, but this is definitely not a kid's show, so I'm glad I waited until now. However, this is an enthralling (if disturbing) story.

Shaka Zulu has grown into a legend of mythical proportions, and my impression of the movie is that, the attempt was made to portray the story as it is told in legend. In other words, there is a lot of fiction, but it is not fiction injected by the writers--it is fiction injected through years of lore and storytelling. I actually like this approach because it somehow seems more real than if Hollywood just made up what they wanted to.

The actors did a tremendous job in portraying this story of the man known as Shaka. Truly, this is a gruesome story that is not for the faint of heart. There is enough gore to rival today's movies, and this was 100% a result of Shaka. Pre-Shaka, the Zulus were a small herding community that conducted its wars in a ""jousting match""  manner. Shaka, through intense vengeance and hate changed the whole outlook--not only of the Zulus but also of the whole subcontinent.

This story starts with the British attempting to reach Shaka to make an alliance with him. It then moves to a few episodes that show Shaka's youth so as to show his reasons for hatred. After showing Shaka's path to supremacy (and tyranny), we are again taken back to ""present"" when the British are attempting to communicate with Shaka. The whole sequence of this story works very well.

If you use short terms to sum up this story, there are several descriptions that could be used: brutal childhood, military brilliance, witchcraft and superstition, British arrogance, and painful love. This is really a fantastic story that covers the gamut of emotions.

In the course of the 8 1/2 hours of story, there are a few scenes that stood out to me. Maybe you will have different ones, but the ones that left an impression on me were: 1. The scene where Dr. Fynn is telling Shaka about the King of Kings 2. When the ""swallows"" (or whites) were forced to go to battle with Shaka 3. Shaka's reaction to his new son and 4. Shaka's reaction after the death of his mother. I guess all of these tie together in that they show Shaka's twisted way of thinking.

It's hard to say the ending of this movie was triumphant, but it was a relief. Be warned--don't watch this just for entertainment. While entertaining, this is a history lesson that will likely leave you feeling ill to your stomach. A powerful history lesson indeed, though, and you will see events that changed Africa!",1184803200,5,2611,4.542553191489362

557227,5,6303085547,"This one is great. It is well done in terms of story, action and historicity. It takes liberties but it well conveys the legend of Shaka, the king that transformed the Zulus from a minor tribe into a major power.

The backdrop of the series is a colonial government that is worried about the power and threat of the Zulus. Since the colonial office is in a parsimonious mood, funds are not available for sending troops. Instead, an officer of the royal navy is sent to make contact with Shaka in order to try and make a friendly alliance. This officer is played by Edward Fox.

Fox and his band make contact with Shaka but start off at a disadvantage since they are themselves shipwrecked. Even so, they manage to pique Shaka's curiosity and become his valued assets as well as being his prisoners. During the course of this, a series of episodes are used as flashbacks to explain how Shaka came to power.

The series is fascinating. It relies on legend and on history. Many of the actors are big names but most of them have only cameo roles. The real stars are the Zulus, particularly Henry Cele (as Shaka) who are telling their own story. There are ten fascinating hours.",1176076800,2,1173,4.523584905660377

Set against the emergence of British power in Africa during the early 19th Century, the film provides some valuable insights into comparative cultures...

Shaka (Henry Cele) is a man of considerable height, thin, with athletic body and white teeth who can read and write... He is a great warrior, tactically, strategically and physically... He rearms his army with a long-bladed, short-shafted stabbing spear, which forced them to fight at close quarters... He goes for extermination, incorporating the remnants of the clans he smashed into the Zulu, making it increase with numbers and power..

The Mini-Series begins with a letter to the British king (George IV) regarding the Zulus' potential threat to the Cape Colony... In an attempt to intimidate Shaka into an alliance with the British empire, the Secretary of War sends a delegation to inner African to meet with the fearful warrior...

We see :

- The meeting of Nandi, an orphaned princess of the neighboring Langeni clan and Senzangakona, the chief of the then small Zulu tribe... They are instantly attracted to each other... Nandi becomes pregnant, at the same time as Kona's wife, but the marriage did not last... Their marriage violated Zulu custom, and the stigma of this extended to the child...

- The couple separated when Shaka was six, and Nandi took her son back to the Langeni, where he passed a fatherless boyhood among a people who despised his mother and made him the butt of endless cruel pranks... He grew up to be bitter and angry, hating his tormentors... The Langeni drove Nandi out, and she finally found shelter with the Dletsheni, a subclan of the powerful Mtetwa...

- Shaka ruled with an iron hand from the beginning, distributing instant death for the slightest opposition...

- While en route to Shaka's capital, the crew's doctor saves a girl who is in a coma and nearly buried alive by her tribe... Impressed by both the deed and their horses, Shaka agrees to meet with the crew... And so begins the clash of two cultures, two different worlds...

- Shaka, seriously wounded for saving an unknown warrior (King Dingiswayo), is nursed to health by a beautiful Mtwetwa girl...

- Shaka, believing in total annihilation, joins the Mtwetwa army and creates a dangerous weapon for the African warfare...

- Shaka grants Port Natal, with its ivory rights, to the British crew after he is saved by the crew's doctor from an assassination attempt...

- Shaka's mighty army saving the British delegation in a battle against thousands of Ndwandwe warriors... To test the alliance and allegiance of the British delegation, Shaka orders them into battle alone against the Ndwandwe warriors...

- With his mother's death Shaka becomes openly psychotic... Thousands are killed in the initial paroxysm of his grief...

- Shaka rules by the sheer force of his personality, building, by scores of daily executions, a fear so profound that he could afford to ignore it...

Set against the spectacular panorama of the Zulu tribal homelands, and with graphic violence and frequent nudity, ""Shaka Zulu"" is a tremendous epic Mini-Series, chronicling the rise and fall of one of the most famous South Africans who has already passed into legend...",1168560000,55,3712,5.050736497545008

Skip over that other hollywood movie that was made recently. This miniseries is rich and accurate in detail, no cost or effort has been spared to make it look like the real thing.

I gave it 4 stars:

- the bonus material did not contribute anything substantial to my understanding of the movie.

- there seems a break in the continuity in the story at one point when suddenly Captain Farewell and his buddies re-appear on the scene.",1168300800,5,578,4.637254901960785

557277,5,6303085547,"The mini-series ""Shaka Zulu"" is a compelling story about one of Africa's (and indeed the world) greatest military strategists and king of the Zulu nation, Shaka.

Shaka's military genius can be illustrated by the fact that he was very familiar and employed most of the principles of war that modern senior officers learn at staff colleges around the world. Fighting a war involves careful planning and consideration. The Principles of War were used successfully by Shaka as important tools toward achieving success in war. The application of the 9 principles of war by Shaka can be illustrated below:

Clear Objectives:  All his military operations were directed towards a defined, decisive, and attainable objective (except at the end when the British exploited successfully their superior weapons technology).

Offensive:  Shaka knew the importance of seizing, retaining, and exploiting the initiative. He achieved success by aggressively moving forward, catching the enemy off-guard to force them to surrender or terminate their resistance.

Mass: Shaka's army used the concept of, ""Shock and awe"" of concentrating overwhelming combat power at the decisive place and time shocking his enemies into submission.

Economy of Force: Shaka used to focus the right amount of force at the right time at the right location.

Manoeuvre: Shaka would place the enemy in a position of disadvantage through the flexible application of combat power.

Unity of Command:  For every objective, there was one person responsible for war fighting decisions, the great elephant himself (Shaka).

Security: Shaka did not permit the enemy to acquire an unexpected advantage except that due to superior technology, the British ultimately triumphed over him

Surprise: Shaka's wars were short, with few lives lost (on his side), and he largely achieved this through the application of the principle of surprise. Shaka would destroy his enemy's will to fight and do it as quickly as possible.

Simplicity: Shaka prepared clear, uncomplicated plans and clear, concise orders to ensure thorough understanding. Winning his numerous wars did not depend on his Generals alone, but on the initiative, bravery, and courage of those on the front-line.",1138665600,15,2220,5.437317784256559

From the producers:

He was an illegitimate prince who reclaimed his birthright with brilliance and brutality. He created a vast new nation from warring tribes and forged an army that defied the most powerful empire on earth. He was Shaka Zulu, and his story made TV history. Brought to life in an epic, 10-part production, the story of the legendary, 19th-century African king became one of the most compelling and controversial miniseries in television history. From his boyhood in exile to the bloody struggles that solidified his rule and his proud defiance of British colonists, SHAKA ZULU is the unforgettable tale of a man who stood at the heart of a battle between two worlds.

557281,5,6303085547,"""Shaka Zulu"" is dramatically effective.  It's downright addictive.  I watched the entire 500-minute series in a single day, because I just couldn't stop.  (I actually watched most of it in a single sitting, but had to deal with a couple of interruptions near the beginning and the end.)

On that basis, I have no choice but to award it five stars.

Still, I must note a significant omission.

The series follows Shaka through his early life, his rise to power, personal issues he dealt with during the time he was king, his madness, and finally his death.

What is glaringly absent is any in-depth portrayal of the kind of king he was before he went mad.  My knowledge of Shaka was quite limited before viewing this miniseries, but I knew that he had made changes to the Zulu economy, judicial system (if it can be called that), and other aspects of Zulu life.  I was really hoping to learn more about this.  What did he do in his role as king?  In what ways did he affect the lives of his subjects?  Were they better off or worse off?  The kind of king he was says something about the kind of man he was, so this is an important part of his story, and I wish the miniseries had delved into it.

Despite that unfortunate omission, I can't help but award the series five stars.",1127692800,15,1276,4.374468085106383

557284,5,6303085547,"One of the best movies/series I have ever seen; the story is epic and well-told, and the acting and cinematography are fantastic.

What I liked best was the ambivalent nature of all of the main characters, not the two-dimensional cardboard cut-outs typically encountered in movies (and series).  Shaka, while certainly a great leader, warrior, and king, is also certainly an utterly ruthless, blood-stained tyrant; this production does an amazing job of illustrating these and other facets of the man.  As other reviewers note, Henry Cele was just amazing in this role.

The English characters were also portrayed well; the leader, Lt. Farewell, is depicted as a well-intentioned rogue seeking ivory, but ultimately his relationship with Shaka changes him.  Normally he might not be a very sympathetic character, but compared to the  British colonial officials in Capetown, he is practically a paragon of wisdom and virtue.  The Scottish doctor meanwhile attempts with rather limited success to school Shaka in the tenents of the Christian faith--Shaka has a way of turning all of the doctor's earnest efforts completely backwards.

Finally, a comment about the large portion of the series devoted to Shaka's birth and childhood--it is Shakespeare and Greek tragedy rolled into one--prophecies, witchcraft, parricide, regicide, vengeance, love, war, etc.  Very very interesting.",1104192000,119,1378,5.492890995260663
