8125136,1,B000FOQ1I6,Thought I was ordering foreign film with sub titles. My mistake,1472860800,,63,4.818181818181818
8125137,3,B000FOQ1I6,"This is definately not a great movie, and the cover is kind of deceptive, but it's not bad for a low budget film.  First of all, the hero, Ben is not too bright.  He can't understand how he got such an easy job that pays so well.  Stop and smell the coffee, Ben.  Get a clue, and there are clues all over the place.  Sarah, played by Kristi Clainos, is a corprate headhunter who gets him this great job then seduces him.  Rather easily I might add.  Anyway, this movie is worth a look.  I probably wouldn't own it, but it's not a bad horror flick.  Oops, let's not for get the ending.  That was kind of silly, and the garbage disposal scene.  ew[...]  If you're a horror fan you should at least be able to say that you've seen it.",1157068800,4,730,4.099290780141844
8125138,4,B000FOQ1I6,Took a chance on this one.  Liked the cover.  Not the best horror movie out there. but a requirement for this genre.  Suspenseful and funny.,1155600000,4,140,4.52
8125139,4,B000FOQ1I6,"I enjoyed this movie.  A little slow at some parts, but I found it entertaining, funny, and a little scary.  I liked most of the characters.  The special effects were pretty good considering the budget.  Nice work overall.  Worth a watch!",1155600000,4,238,4.7073170731707314
8125140,2,B000FOQ1I6,"Sarah the main character aka vilan, plays the stalker kinda person. She however does not have the lead in the movie, meaning she is not what you see on the cover. This film lacks its gore, however has some graphic scenes. worth the rental, But do not buy, unless you like a dead hore...",1155600000,,286,4.314814814814815
