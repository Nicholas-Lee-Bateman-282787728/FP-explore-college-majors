1968846,5,B00013B2JE,"This soccer instructional video/DVD is one of the best things I have seen in a long time. Quite appropriate for indiviual or team players ages 7-14.  The pace of the video is very fast yet it gets many points across well.  The team used in the video is obviously a highly talented team that was needed to show the many drills done right. It is still Two thumbs, and eight fingers up! Well done, very very well done!",1084060800,14,415,4.3076923076923075
1968847,5,B00013B2JE,"This DVD has soccer drills coming at you like a hard hit corner kick. The format is excellent with good explanations and very well paced.  Professionally edited, worthwhile soccer drills and skills galore make this a must for any soccer coach or parent's DVD library.",1073865600,4,267,4.933333333333334
1968848,5,B00013B2JE,"I recommend this well-produced video for all players 6-16, coaches and parents. For the 3 years that I've coached soccer ages 8-12, I have found this video to be one of the best I've seen. It is helpful to both the kids and their parents. You can do many of these drills in your driveway, backyard or in the park with or without your team. My own kids, ages 9 & 11 have probably watched it 20 times and still enjoy it. This is great value for the money and you won't go wrong. The producer of this soccer ""gem"" gets it in a number of ways, production value, creative drills & great narration that gives you some very valuable tips.",1062115200,21,631,4.223140495867769
1968849,5,B00013B2JE,"Unlike other sports instructional videos that have more talk, less action, ""Championship Soccer Drills"" seems to have hit home the structure of a successful instructional tool that keeps your interest. Divided up into different categories such as, shooting,
ball handling, back moves etc., the video is an encyclopidia of soccer drills and skills. Nice production values including some good slow motion and stop action of the shooting technique are also a plus. The age group which would seem to get the most
out of this creative video would be 6-14 (male and female) as well as older players up to high school age could also benefit.
The video is a valuable asset for parents who have little idea about how to modify sport skills so youngsters can be successful. The brilliance of this soocer video is that he uses two key elements of learning; assure player success and introduce novelty so players don't get bored. The wide variety of activities assures that both parents and players will be able to learn together in a positive environment. This is a real good buy!",1058659200,20,1069,4.8791208791208796
1968860,5,B00013B2JE,"An absolutely well rounded terrific video -- spanning all aspects of team and individual play. I own a number of videos and books -- usually too basic or far too advanced. Schupak's video is exceptional in that it takes soccer coaching to a high quality level in terms of creativity, theory and tactics. I am recommending this to all coaches who want to get serious with their players and also have fun! I'm back to buy additional copies for my assistant coaches.
My highest, 5-star recommendation.",1246579200,2,498,4.8023255813953485
1968861,5,B00013B2JE,"We got this DVD this past season, and my kids have watched it dozens of times. They practice the moves in front of the TV, then they go in the yard and practice on each other for hours on end. The drills are really dynamic and with some of them you say to yourself;
""why didn't I think of that"".
Great Job!",1245628800,3,306,3.9516129032258065
1968862,5,B00013B2JE,"You will be a coaching hero with CHAMPIONSHIP SOCCER DRILLS. Intertwine skill drills with fun drills will make for better stimulating practices.
This is not only one of the best soccer videos I have seen but one of the top instructional videos I have ever viewed. The video is almost flawlessly produced. Everything a new or experienced soccer coach needs is right there.
The video is composed of shooting, ball handling, back moves, heading techniques, team passing drills and loads of fun games and more. Perfect for travel teams, school teams and recreational teams.
VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1243728000,2,594,5.134020618556701
1968863,4,B00013B2JE,We enjoyed watching the dvd with our son who is a novice.  It was helpful to us in getting a better understanding of the game.  He started with an U9 team who had been together for about 3 years and he missed a lot of the fundamentals which were taught to the others in the earlier years.  This helped to bridge the gap for him.,1207785600,2,328,4.015384615384615

1968865,5,B00013B2JE,"In one word ""awesome"". I am the director of an academy. We have players from 5 yrs. to 20 yrs. old, and I suggested this DVD to all of my coaches. Unfortunately, I have bought other soccer DVD from ""famous"" soccer players and just wasted my time and money. But this DVD is full of numerous soccer drills and meaningful insights and not useless talk. I would highly recommend this DVD to coaches for children 8 and up to adults. Many of these drills can be adapted to meet the specific needs of the children or older players. I have taken one skill from the video and modified it into over 10 different skills. Great buy, a must have!!!",1196985600,6,635,4.34453781512605
1968866,5,B00013B2JE,I coach a HS girls soccer team and took a seminar with Glenn Crooks (Rutgers women's soccer head coach) and he was teaching some of the same exact drills in this video.,1191974400,3,168,4.28125
1968867,3,B00013B2JE,"I bought this for my [...]based on all the great reviews and discovered that it is for intermediate to advanced players.  The drill  discussions are super short and fast and way too advanced for beginners with little or no instruction or footage on technigues.

I was disappointed and am looking for a thorough dvd that discusses and shows the fundamentals. If you start wrong, you finish poorly.  Fundamental techniques should be the starting point for beginning soccer players.",1174867200,13,479,5.102564102564102

1968869,5,B00013B2JE,"As president of our soccer league, I have recommended ""Championship Soccer Drills"" to all my teams (coaches) on the recreational and traveling team level.  The video has numerous meaningful drills and tips. Many of the drills can be adapted and even changed to fit the level of play.  The recreational teams will be able to use almost all of the drills.  More competitive type travel teams will use many of the drills as they are, but might need to increase some of the challenges in these drills.
  This is one of the better instructional soccer videos/DVD's I have seen.  The presentation is clear. The techniques are very good.  The flow of the video is the best part with ""little talk"" and ""more action"". Most leagues should have a video like this in their library for coaches.

8005920,1,B00013B2JE,"I am right now doing research to find some good DVDs for my youngest son, who plays soccer in a U9 Academy team, and loves to play goalie.

I am finding out that practically all positive reviews for this product, and for all Marty Schupak products, are fake. The techniques used are pretty interesting. First, the basic shills: 5-star reviewers who review positively all Marty Schupak products. Then, to make it more believable, reviewers who only give 4 stars, but still spend their reviewing careers positively reviewing Marty Schupak products.

Where you reach real hutzpah is when Marty Schupak uses some of his shills to actually comment on *REAL REVIEWERS* who pan his products, by criticizing the actual reviewer! Now that's a beauty. Another interesting approach (see Peter Ramos below) is to have a shill comment on how there are good and bad reviews of the product, but he personally finds is quite good, although not quite as good as the 5-star reviews say! But, if you check Peter Ramos, he also has the track record of a Marty Schupak shill :-)

Here is the list of reviewers that I believe to be shills for this DVD: Sports Spiirt, Rita Derosa, Robert Scott, Peter Ramos, Carl Smith, Louis Trent, Mark Depeter, Victor Green, Mark Wilson, E. DeRosa, James Leonard, Lee Russel. Those I think are shills but am not 100% sure are Genaro Alvarado, Ray Thomas, Reggie Santos, Brian Foster (single review, 5 stars, this DVD only...). That's practically all the good reviews for this DVD.

On the other hand, the bad reviews are practically all Amazon verified purchases...

So far, the best reviewed DVD on goalkeeping that I have found is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Keeper-Soccer-Safekeeping-with-Coach-Tony-Waiters/dp/B00030A69C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Keeper!

8005921,5,B00013B2JE,Lots of excellent drills that apply to different skill levels/ages.  Easy to absorb and translate onto the field as a coach.,1381017600,,124,4.904761904761905
8005922,2,B00013B2JE,"This was advertized for soccer training, the soccer portion was small; but half of it is basket ball training. what a waist! this is dishonest sale.",1378771200,,148,4.730769230769231
8005923,2,B00013B2JE,"I had great hopes from this DVD based on Amazon reviews. However, I am very disappointed. The DVD shows a series of drills (about 1-2 minutes each) in a monotonous fashion with some kids practicing with their coach on a field. Production quality is not good. What is shown doesn't seem much different from what I see every week in my son's soccer practice sessions. DVD menu consists of 5-6 options. One option starts playing the sequence of drills. The option for practice schedules brings about three screens, each suggesting how many minutes to spend on different drill categories. Other menu options are about advertising of the company's other products. I don't know about coaches but kids certainly won't get excited about soccer with this DVD.

Then how can the product have raving reviews? Check other reviews posted by these reviewers. Most of them review nothing but only this company's products. Some have as many as 70 reviews, all about this company's products. Some reviewers post the same reviews repeatedly. In short, don't rely on these reviews.",1275782400,6,1062,5.0

8005925,5,B00013B2JE,"I've gotten numerous sports instructional videos and
CHAMPIONSHIP SOCCER DRILLS has distinguished itself from
the others. The brilliance of this soccer program is threefold:
1) Creative
2) Organized
3) Valuable Tips
The arrangement (and flow) of the drills and the authoring with sections really
help to keep you absorbed. The professional narration adds to the production values.
One is tempted to recommend this for only beginners and intermediate soccer teams, however
most of the drills can be adjusted so that advanced individuals and teams will enjoy them
and also improve their soccer skills.
I have no reservation giving this program my highest recommendation.

This popular soccer set By Marty Schupak also includes the reviewed DVD.

8005927,5,B00013B2JE,"Quality soccer practices will translate to improvement for your team.
CHAMPIONSHIP SOCCER DRILLS is more about drills and less about
World Cup soccer techniques.  With that said, I cannot see
any reason why any organized team with a progressive coach
will not improve his practices following this program.
Our U14 travel team loved the drills.
We improved, had fun and the players want more!
You cannot ask for anything else.
