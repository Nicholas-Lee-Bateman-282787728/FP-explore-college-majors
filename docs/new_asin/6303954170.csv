7856792,5,6303954170,"At first glance this looks like a vehicle for between work actors. You spend the first few minutes saying where have I seen that person before. Then all of a sudden you are into the story. You say ""Oh yeah I have seen that formula."" They give you enough overt clues to predict ahead of time what is going to happen. Then somewhere along the line the actors melt out and the characters are real. Every so often they throw in a ringer or a herring. And just as you figure it out ""you are wrong!""

The whole experience is over too soon and your are left thinking what could of happened ""if only.""",1502150400,,593,4.201754385964913

7856798,5,6303954170,"Brian Dennehy is at his finest as the hard drinking, womanizing brother in law of lawyer Sandy Stern (the terrific Hector Elizondo). As Sandy Stern represents his brother in law secrets come to life that affects Sandy's own family. This characters were first introduced to us by Scott Turow in ""Presumed Innocent"" and you will be carried until the final moments when everything comes together. A must see.
