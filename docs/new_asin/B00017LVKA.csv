1975606,5,B00017LVKA,"Both of these programs are very well done. I have shown both of them to my university students (survey course on Ancient Cities / Ancient Civ., and Roman History), and they not only learned from them, but found them compelling as well.

In particular, my students appreciated the Pompeii program because it brought home to them the magnitude of human suffering in this disaster, as well as the helplessness and ineffectiveness of well-intentioned government officials attempting to intervene (e.g., Pliny the Elder, who sailed into the conflagration with a Roman fleet to rescue survivors, only to be overcome and suffocated by Vesuvius' poisonous fumes). It was especially poignant in view of the Katrina disaster that had overwhelmed New Orleans mere weeks before they saw this program. Especially effective is how the program follows actors portraying specific, historically-documented individuals and families of Pompeii (all drawn from various walks of life, e.g., merchants, politicians, gladiators, and slaves; men, women and children) through the different phases of Vesuvius' eruption. The final images, showing the actors in various positions of death recreated from and juxtaposed with images of the skeletons or body casts of the actual individuals just as they were found, are particularly moving. They also serve as a powerful reminder of one's own mortality... so this show is perhaps not for anyone in the throes of a midlife crisis!

The Gladiator program also does well in fleshing out the lives of Rome's professional blood-sport combatants beyond the arena. One learns how and by whom they were trained and cared for and what their daily lives could be like. It also explains how many gladiators formed  guilds to ensure that none of their colleagues killed in the arena should lack proper burial, or that their widows and/or orphans should lack care. A parallel storyline involves the construction of the Flavian Amphitheater, or Colosseum, under the Emperor Vespasian (69-79 AD) and his son and successor, the Emperor Titus (79-81 AD). The climax of the program is the fight immortalized by the poet Martial, in which two very popular gladiators fought to a draw before the Emperor Titus in the last days of the 100-day celebration held for the dedication of the Colosseum in Rome (in 80 AD, before the Colosseum was completed). For its depth, drama, and sensitive approach (it is NOT overly gorey, so can be shown to grade-schoolers as well), I give it top marks.

It is also nice that both programs deal with virtually contemporaneous events (they occurred within a year of each other), thus serving as a snapshot in time of Rome and Roman-Italian society in 79-80 AD.

Finally, production values are particularly high for an historical documentary, thanks in large part to CGI techniques employed throughout to recreate landscapes, cityscapes and volcanic explosions. Costumes are also largely accurate, as are the sets and set decorations (unlike ""I Claudius"" and Marlon Brando's ""Julius Caesar"" both of which committed the anachronistic faux pas of having on set busts of emperors who were not even born yet... relatively speaking, of course).",1141603200,27,3170,5.220039292730845
1975607,5,B00017LVKA,I used this in my classroom to teach about Pompeii.  The kids loved it and it held my intrest even after the 8th time I had watched it.,1140825600,11,135,3.8214285714285716
1975608,1,B00017LVKA,"Was looking forward to watching this story, given the glowing reviews, unfortunately there was nothing in the description to indicate that it could not be viewed in Australia. One assumes that if you are selling to an international audience information that important would have been a courtesy, if not just plain honest.

1975609,5,B00017LVKA,"This review is in relation to Pompeii-The Last Day only.

Pompeii-The Last Day, brings to the screen the last hours of one of the most well known cities of all time.  The irony lies in that the city owes its fame to the spectacular and tragic way in which it was destroyed.

The director's presentation includes effective narration in conjunction with the re-enactment, by a variety of citizens of Pompeii using authentic dialogues that have survived in diaries and other records, of actual conditions.  It is an AMAZING and accurate way of conveying the feelings and emotions that the people of the time would have experienced since making use of primary sources has always been the best way to find out about and examine the past.

The actors give it their 100% and it really shows; they have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are extraordinary to say the least!  Consequently, it is a film that can be watched over and over again.

Peter Nicholson and the BBC deserve credit for doing an OUTSTANDING job with this highly educational and entertaining project!

The setting, the dialogues the costumes, and the music are all wonderful!

In a nutshell, Pompeii-The Last Day will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.  It is a film definitely worth watching, especially for those with a soft spot for History and all things Roman, and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!",1115510400,10,1423,4.9411764705882355
1975610,4,B00017LVKA,"...but not the one shown on the Discovery Channel though.

All the reviews you are going to read below are excellent, this DVD is a very good combo (the gladiator documentary is also of very good quality) extras are numerous and interesting.

HOWEVER the version played on TV was 1 hour 40 minutes long instead of the English version of 50 minutes we have on this DVD. The editing is different, the music is different, the narrator is different (american accent). There is a 50 minutes additional part with all the actual site of Pompeii and it's dangers to the new cities that were built since the eruption which is also very informative.

Both versions, English and American are very good, I guess you just have to make your own opinion when you'll see a reprise of the show on TV (or you can still go on the discovery web site to find the American version DVD which does not include the Gladiator combo...)

It's time Amazon.com start providing the DVDs from this source as well, because if you are interested in Documentaries you don't have access to all choices available just by visiting their website right now...",1108684800,47,1120,4.641414141414141
1975611,5,B00017LVKA,"First of all, let me express my feelings on this movie-WOW!  This DVD has a narrator that pops in and out leading the viewer through the lives of some of Pompeii's citizens.  He then lets you basically enter into their lives and you somewhat feel that you are watching the ""mountain"" (they did not know it was a volcano in 79 AD) explode.  I was really moved just seeing how people dealt with this disaster.  The movie also shows the artifacts of today linking them with the characters in the story.  They also show the casts of the people as they lived out their last minutes on Earth.  Let me say that this is one of the best movies out there.  You will not be disapointed.  Even to the guys that like action flicks, I think you will like this one since it is a TRUE story.  For the gals out there, you will also love it as I did since it is a dramatization of something TRUE.  I usually don't buy just any movie, but I am definately glad that this is one I spent money on.  ENJOY!",1107648000,59,983,4.148148148148148
1975612,5,B00017LVKA,"The documentary/drama of Pompeii is one of the more dramatic of BBC historical productions of recent note.  The last day of Pompeii, just before and during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.  This is no mere documentary presentation, nor is it a docu-drama in which things are enacted and carried along soley by the narrative.  This production weaves together historical narration and live-action progress, together with very impressive CGI recreations of the cities of around the bay of Naples, including Misenum, Stabiae, and Herculanium, a city buried by Vesuvian flows before Pompeii's final fate.

Perhaps the best-known actor here is Jim Carter, followed by Jonathan Firth, both well recognisable from television and cinematic film.  The other actors are lesser known, but good actors who play their parts well, both in terms of presenting a believable picture of Pompeii as a typical Roman city, as well as the kind of struggle and fear one has against the unknown.  Included in the teleplay are clips of actual artifacts of the archaeological digs and reconstructions of Pompeii; these often fade into or fade out from the action in the plot narrative.

Many characters are featured -- Pliny the Elder and Pliny the Younger, watching from afar; Polybius and Stephanus, local politicians and merchants or workers part of large households; various gladiators, slaves and other local figures whose identities are now lost, but whose presence is known from the remains found in Pompeii.

The narrator overlay tells the progress of the eruption (Vesuvius, a major volcano, erupted for in excess of 20 hours at least, according to accounts from Pliny the Younger, accounts that were not believed at the time) -- this progress is recounted hour by hour, as the first earthquakes occurred, the pillar of smoke rising (up to 15 miles into the atmosphere) -- as Pompeii's inhabitants had never seen a volcanic eruption, they had no idea what they were witnessing, and thus most did nothing to escape.  The falling pumice, then rocks and coals, then the air thinning, the volcanic lightning, and the gaseous mixture into the air are all chronicled.  The narrator talks about the finds later, such as looters who remained in the streets long past time there was any hope for escape.

Pliny the Elder, across the bay a bit from Naples, was too fascinated by the developments to flee for his life.  A naturalist (he wrote an encyclopedia of natural history which is one of his only surviving works), he observed the collapse of the volcanic column as a piece of rare history indeed.  Pliny the Younger recounted much of the details from which this particular history is reconstructed.

The piece shows a bit of the archaeological reconstruction -- Pompeii lay buried and forgotten for some 1500 years, until rediscovered accidentally during excavations for an aqueduct.  The documentary also recreates what would happen to modern cities around Vesuvius today given a similar catastrophe, with literally millions living around the volcano today.

Dramatic, impressive, and historically fairly accurate (so far as my reading of Roman histories permits me to judge), this is an impressive production by any standard.",1107043200,12,3204,5.144508670520231
1975613,5,B00017LVKA,"A realistic docu-drama, this is a telling of the building of Rome's Colosseum which started under the rule of Emperor Vespasian and was completed by his son and heir Titus in 80 AD. It also shows the training of the gladiators, many who were slaves, but a few who would trade their liberty for a period of time for money, and sometimes fame.
The decadence and brutality of the Roman games, as well the brave and desperate men who were the entertainment, make for a riveting story;
The central figure is a historical gladiator by the name of Verus, who was a slave working in a quarry when chosen for the arena. Robert Shannon is good in the part, exhibiting much physical prowess, grace and style.
Filmed in Tunisia, it boasts the latest technological wizardry to duplicate the Colosseum and the audience, using matte paintings and crowd replication among other techniques.
Produced and directed by Tilman Remme, the dialog is in Latin, and the narration by Liev Schreiber, whose modulated voice is always a pleasure to listen to.
Having seen the empty shell of what is left of this extraordinary structure as it stands today, I found this recreation fascinating and informative, with enough drama and action to make it interesting for repeated viewings.",1080259200,73,1254,4.864485981308412

1975627,4,B00017LVKA,"A detailed view of the last day of Pompeii. It's hard to plan to evacuate a city when you don't know you're living on a volcano; Latin doesn't HAVE a word for volcano. Based on an eye witness account, long discounted, this dvd is as historically accurate as modern society can make it. Also raised the question: What will modern Naples do if, and when, the volcano erupts again?

1975628,4,B00017LVKA,"I watched this today to make sure it was appropriate for my high school Latin classes. Thankfully it was! There is some suggestive material (when discussing how gladiators were sex symbols in ancient Rome), but they tastefully pan elsewhere if a gladiator is going to meet his end by sword. My favorite part of this, however, is the fact that they chose to have the characters speak in Latin, rather than in English. As a Latin teacher, I love this because it gets my students hearing Latin and in a ""realistic"" setting too. Simple commands like ""pugna!"" or ""pugnate!"" should be easily understood by even the most elementary, beginning Latin student. Excellent job. I did find it a bit slow at certain points, (hence 4 rather than 5 stars), but overall I do think my students will enjoy it and learn something from it in the process.",1442016000,,833,4.673469387755102

1975703,5,B00017LVKA,"This is a pair of docu-dramas which re-enact two stellar incidents in the history of Rome.  Coincidentally, both occurred during the reign of Titus (son of Vespasian).

The first depicts the final day of the doomed city of Pompeii.  Using archeological data as well as the writings of Pliny the younger,  the makers of the DVD walk us through the individual lives of some of the denizens of the city who perished on that fateful day.  To be sure, some conjecture is involved, but the conjecture is based upon the best-available evidence.  Historical figures who are otherwise long-since-forgotten are brought back to life to ""tell"" us about their last day on the planet (nearly 2,000 yrs in the past).

The second docu-drama recounts the inaugural games of the Flavian Ampitheater (nicknamed the Colosseum as it was built on the spot where there was a statue from Nero's Golden House < the Romans razed it).  We get an inside glimpse into the construction of the massive structure as well as the very 1st combatants to perform there from the memoirs of a gladiator who was involved in the building project and was also a man who fought on that first day.  He earned his freedom that day, symbolized by a wooden sword (known as a Rudis) that he received from the emperor Titus.

There are also historical accounts from Roman historians who were there.  As the viewer will see, not everything went according to plans that day!

The movie about the Gladiator (#2 on the DVD) was also very good.  It tells the story of one gladiator and how he went from a slave to one of the stars of the Colosseum.

Both movies use facts from period writings as well as artifacts to recreate life in the Roman Empire.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone interested in the story of Vesuvius or Gladiators.  It is appropriate for ages 10 and up.",1367366400,,725,4.365671641791045

1975712,5,B00017LVKA,"When I saw the image that advertises this video, I feared it would be another one of those lousy pseudo-history videos that sacrifices accuracy for the sake of sensationalism, all to make a buck for the businessmen film makers who couldn't care less about history.  Not so here.  This video struck me as an accurate and careful history lesson, with nice special effects recreations of ancient Rome and also of the interior of the Colosseum when it was filled with ancient Romans.  The people, when they speak, speak Latin, which is a very nice touch.  If I could have, I would have rated this 4.5 stars, instead of 5.  I liked this video a lot; but my enthusiasm is not unbounded.  The gladiator fights were good for a history video, but nothing special, a bit B-movie-ish, definitely not even close to being as impressive as, say, the fights in a movie like Gladiator with Russell Crowe.",1358726400,2,888,4.660256410256411

I only watched A Gladiator's Story though.",1350864000,,362,4.934426229508197

The presentation gives a personal account of what it must have been like for people that lived in Pompeii when Mt Vesuvius errupted. I also enjoyed Collosseum -A Gladiator's Story, as it gave good insight into what it must have been like to become a slave and then end up become a gladiator. I would highly recommend this dvd to anyone who has an interest in history and the lives of people of the Roman period.

1975720,5,B00017LVKA,These two shows have top notch cgi effects and recount two actual events from the roman era. Pompeii and the gladiator story. The acting is done by real actors too so you get a real docudrama effect that is incredible. THe bbc rivals national geographic channel here in it's excllence compleely. The effects are stunning and you they actually cover the ftes of real people of the day and in the case of the pompeii one it's really tragic. We even see how these peoples bodies were discovered. It's quite a work of filmmaking and these two stories bring us back to a long lost empire that is modern western societies direct ancestor. ALthough we have moved on away from the hideous slavery and monstrous gladiatorial games thankfully. But watching these two shows will help you gain a better understanding of those days and see the participants for the people they really were.

1975721,5,B00017LVKA,"Please note: this review is for the US version of (only) the DVD documentary - ""Pompeii: The Last Day""

Like many others, I've always been fascinated with the story of the 79 AD eruption of Mount Vesuvius in southern Italy back in ancient Roman times and the havoc it wreaked upon the cities and citizens that lived around it. Recently I had the opportunity to actually visit the world heritage sites of Pompeii and Herculaneum - the two communities that suffered the most in the volcanic eruption and were amazingly preserved by the catastrophe to be re-discovered centuries later and restored to the light of day so that present generations could have a unique appreciation of a vanished way of life.  I bought a copy of this DVD prior to visiting Pompeii and really enjoyed it, but it took on a whole new dimension after having actually walked around the excavations.

This documentary does an excellent job of re-creating the everyday aspect of ancient Pompeii, bringing to life the characters and places that archaeologists have pieced together from the remains that have been found at both Pompeii and Herculaneum.  Based on the architectural remains of a politician's house, a fullery (ancient laundromat), and the colosseum the documentary re-imagines the individuals who would have populated these sites and the human drama they would have experienced during the events of the great natural disaster. Also portrayed is the noted Roman historian Pliny the Elder, & his nephew Pliny the Younger, who provided eye-witness reports of Vesuvius's eruption that helped to guide the accurate re-creation of the various events pictured.

The production values of this DVD are really amazing and the CGI effects of the volcanic eruption(s) are totally realistic and awe inspiring / horrifying.  This is no sad little model mountain with laughable smoke and fire effects - the computer imagery accurately captures the massive scale and nature of the explosions and pyroclastic flows that decimated the surrounding areas and buried the cities over the course of just a few days.

After telling the story of the ancient eruption the DVD goes further by examining the potential for a similar eruption in our modern time - when the population around the Bay of Naples now numbers in the millions rather than thousands. There is a cool scene where (via CGI effects) the modern narrator is sitting on a deck in Naples and in the distance Vesuvius begins a new massive eruption.  The special effects crew provides some imaginative visions of pyroclastic clouds sweeping over the contemporary city scape to emphasize the message that 'the clock is ticking!'.  Anyone who has a penchant for historic volcanic action will doubtless find this an enjoyable watch - definitely the most realistic depiction to date of this cataclysmic event.",1309392000,,2825,5.084233261339093
1975722,5,B00017LVKA,"As always, BBC does a great job recreating history, and this is a family-friendly production.

1975724,5,B00017LVKA,"I purchased this video to complement my class's study of Rome.  The video is so effective because it uses the story of two famous gladiators to communicate what it was like to fight in the Colesseum.  It is detailed without being gorey.  It is engaging without being too fictionalized or simplified.  It truly is the best documentary I have seen for middle/high school students on the subject.  After showing it to many students, now for three years in a row, it remains the student's favorite documentary.

The cinematography captures the scenes wonderfully, without becoming a cheesy over-produced extravaganza.  By incorporating simple Latin phrases in the dialog, the introductory Latin student is hooked, and the Roman life details help the viewer to identify with aspects of humanity (funerals, religion).  A quick pace and frequent references to help the viewer understand the significance of the scenes make the story clear and enjoyable.  As a Latin teacher, I used this in a unit with my 7th and 8th grade students who enjoyed it immeasurably.  A winner!",1174089600,8,664,5.346153846153846

Before you see this film, I would recommend that you become familiar with the geological term ""pyroclastic flow"".  It took me some time to grasp just what this was.

The program on the Colosseum was, (amazingly) nearly as stunning.  Similar techniques are used to show how and when it was built and just what was going on in there.  There are all kinds of jobs, perhaps you have one right now, but ""The Beastmaster"" job was not an easy job at all.  It was a tough job, but somebody had to do it.
