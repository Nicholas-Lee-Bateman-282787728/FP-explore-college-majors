8749483,5,B01B6YHZC4,This is an oldies from 1959 with Gina Lollobrigida and Anthony Franciosa. Is a good movie about the life and death of a call girl. Recommended for all Gina Lollobrigida Funs.,1504051200,,174,4.645161290322581
8749484,3,B01B6YHZC4,"When I used to watch the Late Show with my mother, one of the movies she always talked about and looked for was GO NAKED IN THE WORLD as it was the first adult movie she saw in theatres back in 1961 when she was fifteen years old. The film has remained elusive and we never did get to see it on the Late Show or even VHS. I recently bought Warner Archives DVD release and this is a film, while not in the same league as RETURN TO PEYTON PLACE, BY LOVE POSSESSED or BUTTERFIELD 8, that has the same 1950s vibe as those scandalous-then-quaint-now pictures starring Lana Turner, Elizabeth Taylor, etc.

Gina Lollobrigida is a high-priced call girl who catches the eye of Anthony Franciosa, whos been serving in the military while trying to find himself. Tony falls in love with Gina, whilst establishing his own identity, apart from his domineering construction company tycoon father Ernest Borgnine. The movie begins promisingly, as Tony meets Gina shes seated in a flaming red restaurant booth (the director may as well have painted VICE WARNING on the wall behind her!) and the dialog is overripe and hooty:

Well, leave something on me, I might catch cold Gina purrs as Tony undresses her seductively with his eyes.

Unfortunately, the movie doesnt sustain this level of camp throughout and as it progresses, it amounts to a series of scenes and events weve seen before in more memorable pictures. Also, Franciosa seems a little too old and worldly to be believable as a guy who wouldnt recognize Gina for what she is right from the get-go and the film would have worked better had a more boyish actor been cast in the role. An okay view but it doesnt have the replay value of some of its better known contemporaries. The widescreen print looks terrific, however (check the screen grabs I posted). THREE STARS.",1475193600,2,1811,4.653125
