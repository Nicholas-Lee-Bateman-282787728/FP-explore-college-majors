8022552,3,B00025XKX2,"The Riddle of the Leopard on mount Kilimanjaro
has more than one solution?
Hemingway was a drama type: he always was going over his
lost loves and his ""failure"" :
even after he got the Nobel prize.
He usually just got drunk and went fishing or hunting.
Here he thinks he's dying and has made the wrong turns in life.
The Leopard found his blue screen of death
by following a mountain goat past where it was safe for him.
The Leopard like Hemingway was a predator after his prize.
We know that even in death for some the prize remains theirs.
Here a short story becomes nearly a great movie.",1193875200,,590,4.324324324324325
8022553,5,B00025XKX2,In THE SNOWS OF KILMANJARO writer Gregory Peck reflects on the loves in his life as he lays waiting to die at the base of Kilimanjaro in this Hemingway story. The story juxtaposes his past live with his true Ava Gardner and the present with his wife Susan Hayward. THE SNOWS OF KILMANJARO has a very good Bernard Herrmann score. John DeCuir and Lyle R. Wheeler's Art Direction is exquisite and adds to the strange mystique of this film. Henry King's direction is rather ethereal.,1166486400,,479,4.647058823529412
