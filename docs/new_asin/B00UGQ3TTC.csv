8706199,5,B00UGQ3TTC,"THE YOUNG SAVAGES (1961) is a black and white movie of the ""film noir"" genre.  As such, the viewer will be treated to cinematography, where weird camera angles are used, such as the camera being near the ground and pointing upwards at a steep angle, or where the camera is elevated, and pointing down at a steep angle.

THE BEST MOVIE IN EXISTENCE.  For various reasons, I consider THE YOUNG SAVAGES to be the best movie ever made.  So many characters play a strong and convincing part.  Of course, there do exist other movies of comparable greatness, and among these are Run Silent Run Deep, Twelve Angry Men, Inherit the Wind, and Singing in the Rain.  There are many street scenes from upper Manhattan, and these are all a delight to the eye.  The street scenes are reminiscent of the street photography by Helen Levitt.

TWILIGHT ZONE.  So many of the characters have also acted in episodes of Twilight Zone.  These are the following.  TELLY SAVALAS plays a detective here, and he stars in TZ's Living Doll.  MILTON SELZER plays a psychiatrist in a prison, and he acts in TZ's Hocus-Pocus and Frisby, which stars the divine ANDY DEVINE.  LARRY GATES has a small part as a courtroom lawyer, and he stars in TZ's The Shelter, where he plays a family doctor.  EDWARD ANDREWS plays the district attorney and he is also running for public office. He stars in TZ's You Drive, and also in TZ's Third from the Sun.  Edward Andrews is known for playing characters that are obnoxious and sneaky.  He also acts in Son of Flubber.

AMBIGUITIES.  Burt Lancaster plays an assistant district attorney, and his supervisor is a character played by Edward Andrews.  Lancaster's mission throughout the movie, is to determine the degree of guilt of each of the three Italian teenagers who killed a Puerto Rican teenager.  The Italian gang is The Thunderbirds, and the Puerto Rican gang is The Horsemen.  The three Italian teenagers are admirably played by David Stewart (he plays a moron who is not capable of thinking more than one hour ahead of time), John Davis Chandler (he plays an evil killer who is the gang leader), and Stanley Kristien (he plays an aggressive thug with a soft spot, and he'd earlier rescued a young Puerto Rican boy who was about to be murdered via drowning, at the hands of John Davis Chandler).  The ambiguities faced by Burt Lancaster, all of which add drama and excitement to the plot, are as follows:

(1) Burt Lancaster had, in a much earlier time, dated the mother of one of the accused murderers (mother of Stanley Kristien's character).
(2) Burt Lancaster's character is named ""Hank Bell,"" and a complicating element in the plot, is that he'd shortened his name from the Italian ""Bellini"" to ""Bell.""
(3) The mother of the murdered Puerto Rican boy repeatedly demands of Lancaster, that he gets the three Italians executed.
(4) Edward Andrew's character, who is Lancaster's supervisor, tells Lancaster that he wants the three Italian boys to be executed.
(5) Lancaster's wife is a flaming liberal, and she is aggressive towards Lancaster, and she demands that the three Italian murderers to get a light sentence.

LUIS ARROYO.  This movie is filled with remarkable performances.  Luis Arroyo plays the teen leader of the Puerto Rican gang, The Horseman.  With great skill, he plays a charismatic teenager.  He snaps his fingers, and other people obey him, e.g., by giving him a cigarette.  Younger teenagers serve his needs, e.g., by serving as couriers and providing him with information.  Also, in an amazing tavern scene, Luis Arroyo (only a teenager) has a dialogue with Burt Lancaster (middle aged attorney), and Luis Arroyo manages to present himself to Lancaster as an equal, and to convince Lancaster of his demands.  And then, there is actress PILAR SEURAT, who plays the young sister of the murdered Puerto Rican boy.  I could devote paragraph upon paragraph to describing her amazing acting, e.g., her dignified and confident poise in the witness box during the courtroom trial, when she acknowledges that she started being a prostitute at the age 14.  Also, her anguish occurring in the moments right after her brother's murder is one of the hundreds of finely acted scenes in this movie.",1484697600,,4218,4.846368715083799
