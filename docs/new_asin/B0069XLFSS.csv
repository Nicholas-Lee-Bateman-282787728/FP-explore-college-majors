The film unleashes a myriad of emotions in you. It will make you laugh , keeps you involved and fills you with hope and confidence about your own self. Even though it deals with Indian characters, I see it as a story that can happen in anybody's life regardless of where they are from. The music was refreshing, story is convincing and real life. Performance wise, senior actors like Lillete Dubey and Sarita Joshi have shown their mettle as great character actors and the rest of the cast assiduously walks along. Would definitely recommend and encourage people to watch the movie. Its a great piece of independent film that could be a perfect introduction for audiences who are new to the Bollywood or Indian style of films.",1325548800,6,862,4.677631578947368

8495583,5,B0069XLFSS,"Fun film! Raj (Sachin Bhatt) is sexy af, Nani (Sarita Joshi) is hilarious, and the club scene is my favorite because Nani has all the best lines here (especially the one about her film days)!  It's worth watching through the credits, you get to see some of the crew dancing =]. I liked the message of the film, not overly preachy, just the right amount of cheese and something most people can probably relate to with their own crazy family drama. My only complaint is Raj doesn't have enough shirtless scenes, but as a bonus in the credits you get to see more of Raj's shower scene.",1500249600,,582,4.4392523364485985

It has intertwining story lines that I cared about and was really a heartwarming story of growing up.  Beyond that, the music and dancing are fun and entertaining and the ending was satisfying.

8495588,4,B0069XLFSS,"for me, watching this movie, was great.  the plot and the acting was pretty good and of course, because of the fact that the movie was in english rather than in hindi, it was that much more enjoyable and so much easier to understand and appreciate!!",1362700800,,249,4.413043478260869
8495589,5,B0069XLFSS,"Most of the movies today are bad remakes, superhero related or very poorly written.  Bollywood Beats doesn't fit into any of these categories, which is a good change.  I was glad to see such a fun film with likable characters that acted well.  Watching this movie was also a learning experience of different cultures and touched on realistic situations.  The dancing was fantastic and overall was an entertaining time.  If you want to see something different than the mainstream stuff coming out of Hollywood, then watch Bollywood Beats.",1329436800,4,537,5.056818181818182

If you want to forget everything, be entertained and smile, this is the movie to see.  It's just a fun!",1329177600,,242,4.333333333333333
