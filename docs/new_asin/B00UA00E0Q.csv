7031230,3,B00UA00E0Q,"it's cruel of me to give this only 3 stars, I know. I blame the BBC. Clarke's masterpiece deserved more budget, more time and effort for at least three or four more episodes. If I forgive the BBC, then yes, what the directors, writer, actors did was worth 5 stars.

My main criticism was the pace. Too fast. I could continue nit-picking: Norrell wasn't fussy enough. Childermas wasn't ironic enough, the Gentleman wasn't manic enough, Lascelles wasn't languid enough, etc. etc. But so much was left out that would have been so wonderful, and budget and time restrictions weakened so many key parts. As a result, the whole production took off in its own direction, which again, was not bad, relative to the almost weekly train wrecks the movie industry gives us. I was somewhat pleased that the overall takeaway ""message"" did eek out, i.e., that the land is the magic, and we as humans have only to reattach ourselves to nature to reap its subtle wonders -- if not magic.

Again, I'm mean and cruel because I'm selfish: I wanted a very special, very wonderful filming of this tremendous book, but I got merely serviceable good.",1436832000,15,1126,4.710659898477157
7031231,5,B00UA00E0Q,"I absolutely adore Susanna Clarke's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/massive-first-novel/dp/0765356155/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">massive first novel</a>, a brick of a book that presents a meticulously crafted and researched alternative-world version of the Regency era in which the likes of Lord Wellington and Lord Byron rub shoulders with Clarke's fictional characters.

The novel explores the history of magic and the social mores of 19th century England with humour and grace and mystery and atmosphere, in which polite society is gradually invaded by the dark and perilous realm of Faerie when two great magicians begin to dabble in things they shouldn't.

Mr Norrell is a practical magician, eager to present himself to society so that he may assist in the war against Napoleon. He's not taken remotely seriously at first, though all that changes when he returns to life the Lord Pole's young fianc, and instantly becomes the talk of London. It's only a matter of time before he crosses paths with the younger and less predictable Jonathan Strange, and despite their very different outlooks on what magic is and how it should be used, takes him on as an apprentice.

But the resurrection of Lady Pole came with a very steep price, and both magicians and innocent bystanders alike are unknowingly drawn into the designs of a fairy simply known as ""the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair"", a dangerous creature who has no real understanding of right or wrong - only in pleasing himself.

As irreconcilable differences in ideology drives the two magicians apart (Norrell wants to remain ""respectable"" while Strange is drawn to the wild magic of old), their positions become more vulnerable - both to an ever-more demanding public, and the secret designs of the powers they meddle with...

Obviously with a book this big (and it is a BIG book) a lot of condensing has to occur, but screenwriter Peter Harness does an admirable job in keeping the bare bones of the expansive plot intact, whilst still capturing some of the scope of the time-line and nuances of character.

The production is well-cast, with both Eddie Marsan and Bertie Carvel as the titular characters; Marsan capturing the stinginess and snobbery of Norrell (though they can't help but soften him a little toward the end) and Carvel as a dead-ringer for the amiable, energetic, almost handsome and deeply passionate Strange. Charlotte Riley makes for a sweet natured but spirited Arabella Strange, and Ariyon Bakare serves (literally) as the long-suffering butler to Lord Pole who knows better than anyone what's really happening to his wife.

Marc Warren as the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair left me a little cool - though I'm sure many will appreciate his performance (this sort of intense and sinister persona is what he's good at) I've always pictured the fairy as having a *lighter* sort of menace - the type of person with whom it's more dangerous to be a friend than an enemy; like a child convinced of their own superiority and with no understanding of how their behaviour affects others.

But as though in compensation, Enzo Cilenti is a perfect Childermass - the voice, the insolence, the very *look* of him makes him the embodiment of his book counterpart. He was easily my favourite aspect of this adaptation.

In many ways this take on ""Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell"" can be described as a ""primer"" to Clarke's book. I've many on-line friends who have watched the show and were sufficiently intrigued by it to seek out the source material, which is infinitely deeper, longer and more detailed in its characterization and world-building. But though Clarke's beautiful prose and quirky footnotes are lost in the transition from page to screen, some readers who found the book too long and meandering may well appreciate the fact that this adaptation churns through swathes of material in a matter of seconds.

The production values are as good as they come (the BBC must surely be considered the experts in period dramas by now) and the special effects worthy of the big screen. That said, the portrayal of magic is apt; not as a flashy light show or with energy beams pouring out of fingers, but as a straightforward gift achieved with the appropriate tools and concentration.

With seven episodes in all, there's sufficient time to cover the most important plot-points of the novel, and though some characters and subplots are inevitably lost through the cracks (Aunt Greysteele!) there's also enough ""breathing room"" for the characters to come across as actual people rather than one-dimensional puzzle pieces.

Whether you're a long-time fan or a newcomer to ""Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell"" there's plenty in this adaptation to enjoy (and hopefully it will spur on Susanna Clarke in completing her long-awaited sequel!)",1435968000,23,4857,5.157560355781449
7031232,5,B00UA00E0Q,"I have not loved a TV show as thoroughly and completely without complaint since Firefly. An absolutely astounding bit of entertainment in its own right, it also has the distinction of being one of the purest adaptations in book-to-television or book-to-film history. I can't think of an adaptation this faithful since the Megan Follows-led Anne of Green Gables.

I cannot possibly recommend it enough. I intend to buy multiple copies and give them away as gifts. Even to people I don't like that much.

So absolutely worth your time.",1435881600,20,533,4.977528089887641
7031233,5,B00UA00E0Q,I loved the book and loved the series. I highly recommend it. This is so much better than any fantasy series or movie that has been released within the last ten years!,1435708800,3,167,4.25
7031234,5,B00UA00E0Q,"Does anyone know if there are subtitles?  If not, then that is my only criticism of this fine production.",1435449600,2,105,4.526315789473684
7031235,5,B00UA00E0Q,"I can make no comparisons to the book since I've not read very far in it yet, but perhaps that's a good thing.  Every work of art must be it's own thing, borrowing, certainly, inspired by other things, certainly, but copying nothing.  And honestly I have never seen anything quite like Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.

On the surface it's a tale about how magic re-enters the world.  But if that was the only thing it was about, it would almost certainly not be as rich and intriguing as it is.  Magic isn't really the central focus here.  Rather, what we see is the politics of magic (and life), the tension between different ideologies with Norrell upholding the idea of practical, disciplined, ""respectable"" magic, and Strange seeking the old, wild magic of the Raven King.  Neither sees that the two are not mutually exclusive.

Everything about this production is perfect.  The performances are superb, the sets and costumes spot on period pieces with just enough oddness to keep the viewer from settling too easily into the notion that this is simply an historical drama with magic.  Magic and its trappings flow through every aspect of the production.  It's not just the showy surface magicks, but it is part of the fabric of the drama.

What little I've read of the book suggests to me that the production makes the story a bit more accessible.  The cumbersome footnotes are either worked into the script (or setting) or eliminated.  The pace is more rapid, the story more condensed.  So I'm going to guess that even people who were not able to get through the book may enjoy this series.  Either way, I believe it's well worth watching.",1434240000,25,1647,4.726315789473684
7031236,5,B00UA00E0Q,"Having watched the high-definition version of the long-awaited seven part serialization of the Susanna Clarke novel about the return of magic to Napoleonic-era England after a 300 year long absence, it is gratifying to say that the series more than does the book justice. Those of us who loved the novel were somewhat worried that no single film could approach its richness of characterization and period detail, and certainly no two or three hour film could. But a seven part serialization with production values as high as any I've ever seen, a recreation of the era that is so lovingly detailed you would think that you were watching a documentary rather than a drama, and acting so spot-on that the characters seem to have literally leapt off the page and on to the screen, give this series all of the life that made the novel so remarkable. Not since the 1995 Colin Firth Pride and Prejudice has there been a small-screen version of a celebrated novel as brilliant as this one.

Especially note-worthy is Eddie Marsan as Mr. Gilbert Norrell in what will surely be a career defining portrayal for him. He is the character exactly as I pictured him: reticent, withdrawn, quietly arrogant, brilliant and perhaps slightly afraid of his gift. Bertie Carvel as Jonathan Strange is not quite what I envisioned (I saw him as somewhat more dashing and self-assured), playing him as a bit quirky and unfocused but his performance soon grows on you until he seems to become Jonathan Strange as his facility with magic grows. Two other stand-out performances are Marc Warren as the enigmatic, unstable and possibly quite evil Gentleman-with-the-thistledown-hair. This character is mesmerizing in the novel and Warren gives him that quality of unpredictability and brilliance that is often quite chilling to watch. And then there is Mr. Norrell's assistant in magic and public relations, Childermass. He is beautifully played with low-key acerbic irony by Enzo Cilenti, complete with flattened Yorkshire vowels and a strange fascination with the hidden dangers of magic.

Paul Kaye as the bonkers street magician (and possible mouthpiece of another magical dimension) Vinculus, is certifiably insane as the character, yet assumes an unnerving cogency and scary down-to-earth naturalness whenever he engages in prophesy that may prove so dangerous and deadly. All of the many performances are excellent with none of them inappropriate enough to be called failures in portrayal. The sets and costumes are beautiful, with textile and surface textures in high-definition that have an almost three-dimensional quality. The sets are beautiful representations of the period. Especially wonderful is Mr. Norrell's large magical library at Hurtfew Abbey. It has so much personality and charm it is almost another character in the series. You will crane your neck to read the titles on the spines of those rare and ancient books of magic. The special effects are superb. They are naturalistic enough to be believable and the CGI seems to have been used sparingly so as not to disturb the strong down-to-earth grounding in reality of the story and its feeling of complete believability, regardless of how magical events ultimately become. The show could double as a history of the Napoleonic era in England but with magic added as a commonplace, matter-of-fact occurrence.

If you were worried that the book would lose some of its impact and panoramic scale with its transfer to the small screen, you have nothing to worry about. The series has been made with consummate skill from all hands and it is an absolute joy to watch. It is also interesting to note that Director Toby Haynes spoke of Amadeus being a touchstone for the way he envisioned this production. There are several points of similarity between the films, the most obvious being an envy-driven struggle between two talented men. If you haven't read the book yet, I recommend you do so before viewing the series. It will be much clearer to you and you may enjoy the greater depth that knowing the characters so intimately can provide as you watch all of the many events unfold. But whether you read the book or not, the show stands on its own and it is brilliant. I recommend it with the greatest enthusiasm. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is magical in every way.",1431907200,129,4312,5.0195530726256985

7031239,4,B00UA00E0Q,"I saw this series before reading the book, and while I liked it a lot, the last few chapters seemed rushed, and there was much that seemed rather ad-hoc and not in keeping with the overall narrative. Reading the book, I discovered hat while the producers of the TV series were generally faithful t the narrative, they missed most of the humor, all of the subtlety, and a god deal of the motivation of the characters. There are scenes in the TV version that don't appear in the book, and were obviously contrived to squeeze a 750 page narrative into a TV season, and I understand why that was done- but at the same time, a tremendous amount was lost. If you read the book, you'll find the TV show entertaining, but disappointing.

Novels and video both expose different and wonderful points of view of the same events.  The imagery and dialog is excellent.  Costuming is excellent and the sullen, somber settings add a sinister dimension that is not as fully developed in the Novels.  Carvel and Marsen are excellent as Strange and Norrell, but Marc Warren as the Gentleman adds the depth of villainy needed for true heros.  What truly makes the miniseries is the secondary characters, Lady Pole (Alice Englert), Vinculus(Paul Kaye), Childermass (Enzo Cilenti), Stephan Black (Ariyon Bakare) and surprisingly Mr Segundus (Edward Hogg).  Without these characters you would never see the horror, pettiness, insensitivity, sacrifice and humor of Strange and Norrell's feud.",1474675200,,840,5.465116279069767
7031265,5,B00UA00E0Q,"I loved the book by Susanna Clarke, original, well-written with great characters. The BBC series is even better.  It adheres fairly closely to the book in terms of characters, mood, and plot (with some exceptions) but it tightens up and streamlines the plot, increases the tension, and makes a more coherent narrative.  I preferred the movie ending to the book. With both book and move, I loved the evolution of the relationship between Strange and his mentor Mr. Norrell. The actors who played the parts were perfectly cast.  In particular I loved Bertie Carvel who played the vivid, and imaginative Jonathan Strange (I think he'd make a great Dr. Who) and Enzo Cilenti brought such charisma to the role of Childermass.  What a lovely voice!  The costumes, special effects all made for a fantastic experience.  If you love fantasy, this is among the best I've seen in a while.

I must confess to having series doubts about how faithful of an adaptation this seven-episode mini-series would be to the beloved fantasy novel of the same title by Susanna Clarke.  I shouldn't have worried.
Peter Harness did a completely masterful job of adapting Susanna Clarke's magnificent novel of dueling magicians with inflated egos in Regency England.during the Napoleonic Wars.
Actors Bertie Carvel and Eddie Marsan bring the pair of dueling magicians to vibrant life as they wage their own private war for the heart and soul of ""English"" magic now that the lost supernatural art of magic has found its way back into the real world after a three hundred year absence.
A simply spelling-binding and engrossing television adaptation.

7031294,5,B00UA00E0Q,"""Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell"" is one of the most fascinating and engrossing books I've read is some time, and I am not usually huge fan of fantasy stories.  When I went online and read about the BBC's seven part series of the same title and read the reviews I decided to buy the video.  Considering how many stories are going on all at the same time and how much magic is involved in the book I was curious as to how this would translate onto film.  Happily, seven hours of watching later, my fears and concerns were laid to rest.  The casting is inspired; the sets are gorgeous; and the magic is truly amazing.  Be warned that some of less important characters from the book are made into one composite character.  If you love JSMN the book treat yourself to this compelling video production.  You'll be glad that you bought the video!",1456876800,,841,4.457516339869281

7031306,4,B00UA00E0Q,"One of my favorite books, I was anxiously awaiting this video to see how well it captured the ""magic"" of the literary work.  Sadly, it falls short in several areas (a few minor spoilers in this review).

Rather than being a consistently ""good"" movie, the production is full of hits and misses.  Some of the casting is flawless and spot on.  The characters look, talk and act consistent with the book.  However there are some rather strange failures that make me wonder whether the casting was wrong - or the screenplay writing - or the directorial advice.  The ""man with the thistledown hair"" is supposed to be a mercurial, narcissistic sociopath.  In the book he constantly switches between child-like glee to dark anger; from logic to complete borderline lunacy.  It is this mercurial nature that makes him so interesting as a character.  In this movie, he is portrayed as a very flat, one-dimensional ""evil"" villain.  I do not believe this to be the fault of the actor - but rather the role he was instructed to play.  Norrell was amazing.  Strange was just ""ok"".  Childermass was amazing.  Drawlight was just ""ok"".  So it went throughout the movie.

The other issues I have with this movie is with plot decisions made in the screenplay.  There is always a challenge when you distill literary material for the screen.  I think in many areas this production does admirably to move the plot along, and skip background material or sub-plots in the book to fit it into a 7-hour format.  However there are several areas where the plot isn't just shortened; it is changed - and in some of those instances the movie fails utterly.  The joy of the book comes from the slow build-up of the characters, the background, and bringing many disparate elements together into an amazing climax where all the pieces fit together.  The movie... for some reason... glosses over and/or changes many elements in the last chapter of the book for no reason that I could tell.  There is an extra ridiculous added scene where the man with the thistledown hair is being shot at, and is making characters dumb, deaf, and blind.  Why?  The entire lead-up to the confrontation between Steven and the man with the thistledown hair is changed and diminished - and the final battle is such an afterthought in the movie, that they have to explain it in borish, literal dialogue:  ""this is why you are here: to fulfill your destiny... I am destined to kill you... no don't!... yes I must...""  It is cringe-worthy it is so bad and disappointing.

So I must give this production 4 out of 5 stars.  My wife, who never read the book, didn't like it at all.  As a lover of the book, I found it an amazing attempt that succeeded more often than it failed.  But where it failed, it failed spectacularly.",1453766400,9,2765,4.652892561983471
7031307,1,B00UA00E0Q,Great show ... I only wish I could watch the last three episodes!  Disc 2 - in both my packages - has read errors.

Every actor is perfectly cast. Bravo to the director and all who made this novel come to life.",1451952000,,270,4.42
7031309,5,B00UA00E0Q,"As good, if not better fantasy than ""Game of Thrones"". About a Napoleonic-era England where magic has disappeared and the magicians who changed that. Great casting with Eddie Marsan as the prissy Norrell and Bertie Carvel as the wild heroic magician, very much the proper English explorer of his age. However, a big caveat - Suzanna Clarke, the author of the superb novel this is based on, left the characters stranded at the end of the novel and there has been no sign of a sequel for 12 years. We just have to get over it. I'd rather have something brilliant that leaves me hanging a bit than something pedestrian that finishes up with a stupid, hackneyed end.

Buy this because I doubt BBC America will re-run it any time, buy the book because it is even better than the series (just don't buy the mass-market edition because the footnotes are too small to read - and the footnotes are a HOOT and provide tons of detail, just like Terry Pratchett's.)",1451952000,4,953,4.573099415204679

What those few collectors who know of these books know that magic in England has disappeared and with it any chance of knowing whatever happened to the Raven King.
  As Mr. Norrell believes that magic if not studied properly would result in disaster.  However as he tries to stop various groups and cults by denying them the books they need to dabble in it they cannot be a problem.  that is until he encounter a man called Jonathan Strange.
  Jonathan Strange is the only son of a wealthy landowner who has for the most part in his life be unable to find his place in it.  With a father who thinks him to be nothing but a nuisance and the love of his life by his side Jonathan Strange has no clue as to what to do.

7031340,5,B00UA00E0Q,"What makes both the book and the television series a delight is the subtext that the real magic is creativity. Its a clear parallel. Whether you approach the process in a careful Norrellite fashion or with the impromptu intuition of Strangean ways, the truth is the Raven King flies in like a force of nature and smashes everything apart and thats what inspiration does. The reason we need to see how Arabella and Lady Pole and Stephen and Childermass approach the same magic is because this is not a masculine art as we so often have seen it portrayed, nor is it the province of one race or one class, but its an essential human one. We are all undone by the Raven King, who is not a man after all but the power of inspiration that breaks us apart. Try as we might to control his force with systems and rules, the ravens cannot be contained. They are myriad and indeed impossible to kill. What makes us humanthe creative processis how we put the shattered parts together again and go on.

7031351,5,B00UA00E0Q,"The surprise delight of the summer for me! I read the book some time ago across a length of time (it is a pretty long book but stick with it and you will not regret it!) so many details were no longer fresh in my memory. I think that helped in the sense that I was not a stickler for details in the book making it into the miniseries and allowed the miniseries to be enjoyed by its own merits. More importantly for me was that the series captured the spirit of the book and brought to life the main protagonists. So glad it ended up a miniseries instead of a shorter movie to give it a better opportunity to develop the characters and as it is the pace does proceed pretty quickly (especially compared to the book -- I saw this as a plus that benefited the televised version). While I would have loved for it to have been even longer (it doesn't really stop long at any point) there was enough to get me engrossed in the plot and characters. A big congratulations to the whole cast. Everyone brought their A-game to the table however long or short the scenes were and all made their roles distinctive and memorable -- I thoroughly enjoyed the performances.  The 2 leads Eddie Marsan and Bertie Carvel ARE Mr. Norrell and Mr. Strange in my mind forever more. Special mention for the actor Enzo Cilenti who plays Childermass, manservant/assistant to Mr. Norrell -- he was fantastic! Oh and one other thing -- awesome special effects! While big magic is sparingly done they did a great job in picking the key moments to showcase it. And not to disparage any of the smaller feats of magical display and slight of hand -- I freely admit doing a double take with the camouflage bush scene with Childermass.",1440979200,,1700,4.431309904153355

7031354,5,B00UA00E0Q,"Every 3rd Thursday, the York Society of Magicians meets over a large dining table. This is a gentlemens club in that Northern English city  they discuss magic and analyze it, but would never be so crass as to actually try their hand at it. THAT is the purview of vagabond street magicians, charlatans plying their craft from yellow tents in the market square.

This is, after all, 1806 Edwardian England. The dawn of the Age of Reason. And everyone knows Magic has been lost from England for 300 years. Even so, young John Segundus dares to bring up the question: Why is no one actually trying the spells? Not only that, he, and fellow member Mr. Honeyfoot, bring to the Societys notice the reclusive Mr. Norrell of Hurtfew Abbey, who says he WILL perform magic for them.

When Mr. Norrell does just that, he is so celebrated in the newspapers that he moves to London. Norrell is at first embraced by Society, with a capital S, where everybody mispronounces his name, changing NOR-ill to nor-ELL, which sounds fancier, doesnt it? Norrells aim, after 40 years of studying magic in the solitude of his library, is to make magic a respectable profession once again.

What Norrell doesnt know is that another Englishman is just finding his aptitude for magic, and this Jonathan Strange is a natural, with no intention of studying for 10 years, much less 40 - he is as brash as Norrell is careful. And then theres the crazy street magician, Vinculus, who accosts Norrell with a prophecy by the Raven King:
Two magicians shall appear in England
The name of one shall be Fearfulness
The name of the other, Arrogance
The first shall fear me
The second shall long to behold me
The first shall bury his heart in the dark wood beneath the snow
Yet still feel its ache
The second shall see his dearest possession in his enemys hand
Both will fail
The nameless slave shall be king in a strange land
I will return.

I have never read the book on which this series is based, so I had no idea what to expect with this series. It presents an off-kilter weird and unique idea of magic.  By the end of the 4th episode I was finding it unsettling  not only is it a bit creepy, but it is difficult to tell who is good, or who may be good, or who may change into good. It is very difficult to describe the series in a short synopsis, because there are several story threads (most of which I don't mention above) and they are all important. No wonder the book was made into a TV miniseries, instead of trying to scrunch it into a single movie.

I will say that I thought the parts about the militarization of magic were spot-on to what would happen in real life. The magician would be a mere tool. Miracles would be expected just because the general gave the order. The series has lots of splendid acting, and I thought Marc Warren, as the malignant fairy The Gentleman was especially curdling. Wonderful special effects - the rain ships stand out. And a total non-Hollywood ending. That said, though, this show does not have an action-movie pace. You'll have to slow down a bit and enjoy the ride.

This TV series first aired in May 2015.  It's unusual, for a TV series, for the DVD/BluRay to be available so soon afterwards (not that I'm complaining). The show has 7 episodes for a total of 406 minutes of odd and magical viewing. If you buy the show on discs, it is presented in 16:9 anamorphic with Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, and English subtitles are available.

There is one DVD/BluRay Bonus Extra, the featurette: ""The Making of Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell"" (27 minutes) Commentators include Bertie Carvel (plays Jonathan Strange), Peter Harness (screenwriter), Nick Hirschkorn (producer), Eddie Marsan (plays Mr. Norrell), Toby Haynes (director), Enzo Cilenti (plays John Childermass), Charlotte Riley (plays Arabella Strange), Ariyon Bakare (plays Stephen Black), Marc Warren, Will Cohen (VFX executive producer) and Jean-Claude Deguara (VFX supervisor).
Haynes says, It was a huge responsibility visualizing this book, bringing it from the written word into television. It is incredibly dense. It has all these footnotes; it has this huge magical history, 200 characters and a huge number of locations.

You will  love the quirky and complex characters and the way the actors play them. The Raven King is the best. In the story, their are many different ideas about magic and what purpose magic will play in people lives. You truly get a feeling for each character and the setting in which they are trying to make England magical again.

7031358,5,B00UA00E0Q,A wonderful series for fantasy lovers and period piece lovers alike! My wife and i watched when it was originally aired on BBC and I just had to have it for our home collection!,1440115200,,177,4.235294117647059
7031359,5,B00UA00E0Q,"As an admirer of Ms Clarke's magnificent book of the same name, I considered skipping this adaption to avoid disappointment. Nevertheless, I watched it. And I loved it. Here's why:

1. THE MINISERIES DOESN'T OVERREACH
It isn't trying to recreate the entire book. Such a feat is impossible, at any rate. If you loved your own image of the characters and scenes from the book, have no fear: you can maintain your own version after seeing this. (I now have two ""versions"" of this tale -- the one I created in my head while reading, the one this miniseries has created. They shall coexist, happily.)

2. THE SCREENPLAY WRITING IS **BRILLIANT**.
This is the adaptation by which we should measure all others. Some of the characters shift places, some exit the world in different ways,  some of the plot points have locations and actions completely altered. But all of it fits together to stay true to the overall thrust of the story. We should have expected that such a carefully crafted novel would receive equal treatment for the adaptation. Notably, I find (1) Jonathan Strange more passionate than his book version, and (2) Childermass much more assertive with Mr Norrell. But these are necessary to (1) advance the cause of English magic more quickly, and to (2) get Norrell out of his library and into action being the stubborn little man that he is.
At one point, I exclaimed to my wife ""I can't believe they're going to leave out the [spoiler omitted! more spoilers omitted!] part!"" Then, about a minute later, they put it in at a slightly different moment. Delightful.

3. ARABELLA AT THE END!
For those anxiously awaiting a sequel, Arabella's actions and words at the end of the story are tantalizing indeed. There give hints of things to come, which, assuming Ms Clarke approved the script, will give you a little more to speculate about as we anxiously await the sequel that will, surely, come to pass. Hopefully before many of her faithful readers pass.

REGRETS
Any fan of the book will have a few regrets. This is not intended to detract from the adaptation -- edits were necessary.
Alas:
[mild spoilers in here. I hope they're mild. If you haven't read the book, no need to read them anyway]
- The secret of the moss-oak is given away as soon as Stephen digs it up. So when you-know-what happens at the end of section 2, we already knew-that-was-going-to-happen, if you get my drift. (If you don't get my drift, you shan't regret missing this moment. Be grateful.)
- As mentioned by many, and will continue to be mentioned, John Uskglass looks surprisingly Goth.
- The entire John Uskglass moment lacked some of that King-to-Loyal-Servant feeling that, in the book, felt like Childermass's redemption. I wanted Childermass to have that moment, and he didn't get it. Shucks.

Get yourself a copy of the book and the movie. Bask in the excellent storytelling you'll find in both.",1440028800,2,2887,4.764

I just finished re-watching it yesterday (I'd seen it originally on BBC America) and I want to turn around and watch it again.

7031362,5,B00UA00E0Q,"[My apologies for a long review, but I suspect fans of the book may want to know certain things, and people who have not yet been introduced into the worlds of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell others.]

If you haven't read the book, which this, then go read it after watching the mini-series. If you're a fan of the book, this is an outstanding adaptation. If you watched the version that aired on BBC America, know that the episodes in the Blu-ray edition have a few minutes added that were missing, making it worth a purchase if only to add a few nuances.

Set in an alternate reality England in the early 19th century, where magic was an acknowledged part of history, lamented and all but forgotten. Suddenly the magic is back with two very different men and the legend of the Raven King at the heart of it, in the ultimate ""be careful what you wish for"" plot. A study in dichotomies, the story that unfolds seems to pit head and heart, faerie and England, master and servant, prophecy and reality, and much more.

If you're a fan of the book, keep in mind a film adaptation is neither logistically nor financially possible. Extended character perspectives and thoughts might be toothsome on a page but tedious on the screen. Some segments of the book are shortened, and minor characters have been incorporated into others, or edited out. The essential plot hasn't changed, and the changes made do not fundamentally alter the story. In some cases expanding on what can be read between the lines but didn't work on the written page, in others streamlining for flow and occasionally surpassing it. Thats not a fault of the source material, but a testament to it.

If you can allow for those differences as a fan of the book, you will be pleasantly surprised, and have a new way of enjoying the story, with much to divert you until the second book is out. If you have not read the book, there is a lot packed in, so you still have surprises waiting for you in the book.

The entire cast is strong, and the main cast is superb, with one exception (and that may be a directorial decision and not a reflection of the actor). They may not always first appear as they might have originally in a reader's eye, but each make the character their own. Expect accolades next award season for the cast (and the production -- but particularly Eddie Marsan). The performances alone will give you something to talk about for a long, long time.

Three major characters stray significantly from the source material, for different reasons. Stephen Black's story, fleshed out in the book, is truncated. Although his significance isn't diminished, and logistics and costs are a factor, there are a few scenes less than expected. While Ariyon Bakare is more than up to the task of portraying the exquisite dignity and agony of a black man in Regency England, the subtleties may be lost on some. Simon Guests Sir Walter Pole is more sympathetic than the one on the pages. Childermass on the other hand, has his story expanded, and with the unexpected casting of a younger, attractive actor.

A lot of Childermass was left to the imagination in the book, so the casting choice of Enzo Cilenti may be surprising. In some ways it's a very different Childermass than the one that starts in the book, but I suspect it aligns with the one in the author's mind. From what Ive read about the production, it has Susanna Clarkes approval. Cilenti will make converts to his Childermass, as he chews the scenery with some gravelly utterances, several eye rolls, strategic slouching, and chemistry with every other cast member he shares scenes with. The enigmatic Childermass in the mini-series is more provocative, as its even less clear who is steering whom.

As someone who hadnt read the book first  in large part due to the fan-fare around it  I was delightfully surprised with the mini-series as a story. Reading the book within days of watching the mini-series, I can say they are both outstanding, and unlike the typical Norrellite/Strangeite dichotomy, its possible to love both the book and the mini-series.

Its well-paced based on a tight script, and while the more fantastic sequences may be limited, it does a lot with whats used. Its worth repeated viewings with plenty to discover on each subsequent viewing, especially to appreciate just how well woven this adaptation is. Every point seems to have a well-placed counterpoint that emphasizes most every plot twist and turn. The occasional bow to more mundane sensibilities, such as sand on a camera, and a few choreographed moves better suited for a theater stage than a sound stage, are easy to forgive. And on some occasions where they had to sacrifice parts of the story, they were able to tantalizingly make up for it (such as an aerial shot that will simultaneously make some military history buffs giddy and wanting more).

Its clear just how much thought went into every aspect of the production on top of the outstanding source material. It does have a 26 minute ""making of"" bonus feature that's got a little something for everyone, too.",1439510400,12,5075,4.728506787330317
7031363,5,B00UA00E0Q,"This is without a doubt one of the best miniseries that I have ever seen. I'm a big fan of the book and they did a remarkable job translating it to film.

7031364,5,B00UA00E0Q,"When you find an utterly delightful television series combining history and the completely impossible with the whimsical grace of the book upon which this series is based - well, that's amazing.  When you realize how easily they could have succumbed to the perils of doing a mini-series, you are frankly amazed that they avoided all the pitfalls and triumphed.  I would have said it could not be done.  Thanks to a wildly intelligent script, tremendous effects, and the wonderful talents of both Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell (Bertie Carvel and Eddie Marsan) - in fact, the entire production crew is spot-on - they've made the series better, if possible, than the book.  A delightful exercise in whimsy (I love the idea of Jonathan being the Duke of Wellington's magician at Waterloo), with a sweetly British sense of the ridiculous that is right out of Alice-Through-the-Looking-Glass.  Bravo to all concerned!",1437609600,4,914,5.10738255033557
7031365,5,B00UA00E0Q,Why BBC cannot issue all these great series with Spanish subtitles?,1437350400,2,67,5.181818181818182
7031366,5,B00UA00E0Q,"Published in 2004, Susanna Clarke's Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell was an unusual debut. Almost a thousand pages of faux-Victorian prose, the book was littered with footnotes and festooned with footnotes explaining about the world and characters. Championed by fans like Neil Gaiman, the book became a massive, international publishing sensation and Hollywood soon came calling. However, adapting the book for the screen and retaining its storyline whilst also honouring its length and commercial sensibilities (the book is not well-suited to be turned into an action blockbuster trilogy) proved too challenging and the film rights were allowed to lapse.

Enter the BBC. Unburdened by commercial considerations and with growing confidence following a string of recent hit series, the BBC took on the challenge of adapting this weird, strange and brilliant book and did so by turning it into a weird, strange and brilliant series. They have form here, having taken Mervyn Peake's supposedly unfilmably weird novels Titus Alone and Gormenghast and turning them into a compelling (if perhaps a bit too ahead-of-its-time) mini-series in 1999.

The TV series, of course, can't match the complexity and depth of the novel, even with seven hours to play with. Instead, it takes avoiding action by streamlining some of the action, removing much of the interminable second half of the novel (there's a lot less faffing around in Italy and Venice in the TV version), and refocusing the narrative on Strange and Norrell's relationship, on the situation with Lady Pole and the menacing activities of the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair. Some of the losses from the novel are grievous - the loss in the particular of the witty footnotes is a shame - but in the event are survivable.

The TV show succeeds through the strength of its casting, particularly the genius casting of Eddie Marsan as Norell and Bertie Carvel as Strange. The two actors spark off each other brilliantly and Carvel embodies Strange perfectly as he moves from fop to gentleman to soldier to tragic hero. The rest of the cast is superb: newcomer Alice Englert is superb as Lady Pole and feels like a future Doctor Who companion in waiting. Charlotte Riley is likewise compelling as Lady Pole, aided by a script that gives the female characters a bit more to do than they do in the novel. Another absolute stand-out is Enzo Cilenti as Childermass, whose world-weary cynicism conceals a genuine sense of humanity that gradually comes to the fore (culminating in him giving excellent last line of the series). Marc Warren also imbues the Gentleman with requisite menace, although arguably he is less whimsical and changeable than the character in the book.

The series also has mind-boggling production values. It is, simply put, the best-looking drama series ever put out by the BBC. It has a confidence and swagger to its use of effects that outclasses the likes of Doctor Who, not to mention wit and imagination. A sequence involving a ghostly fleet, the famous scene where the statues in York Cathedral come to life and another scene where horses are summoned out of sand are all fantastically realised. The Battle of Waterloo is convincingly brutal and ugly, even on what was reportedly a fairly small budget. Another scene where Strange has to summon Italian soldiers back to life, only to find them speaking the language of Hell and having to find a way to get them back to speaking Italian, is both a stunning technical achievement and also a profoundly weird one. The book has a feeling of offbeat strangeness which I assumed the TV show would drop, but if anything it doubles down on it.

There are minor weaknesses: the key subplot revolving around the Gentleman's relationship with the manservant Stephen Black is not given a huge amount of development, and in particular lacks Black's interior characterisation. On TV, Stephen comes across as being far too acquiescent in the Gentleman's schemes rather than fighting against them more, and this makes some of his later character development feel a bit unconvincing. Norrell also gets a little lost in the mix as the emphasis moves to Strange for much of the middle and latter part of the series, although this is also the case in the book.

The BBC's version of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell (****) is superbly-cast, well-written and faithful to the book even as it has to streamline elements from it and improve other elements. It is an elegant, bizarre and compelling adaptation of the novel, and is well worth watching.",1437264000,7,4550,5.011904761904762
