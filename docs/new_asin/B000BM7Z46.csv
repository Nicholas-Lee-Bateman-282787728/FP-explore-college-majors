The house, of course, has lots of color and style (you can see it in virtually all of Sterling Pictures's movies). Randal Malone is awesome as the spooky, mishapen butler. Exactly what I wanted to see in my straight-to-DVD pizza flick! Fun times!",1349481600,,365,4.71875
2423979,4,B000BM7Z46,"I watched this movie and I liked it. This is a different horror movie, which can be funny too. The drama, and plot is something that in my opinion is out of the box. You have to see it, so you would understand my point of view.

2423980,2,B000BM7Z46,"If people are to be completely honest about the reasons for renting what must seem a tawdry low budget t-flick (which this surely is), then one would hope there will be less umbrage about the disappointing production values or acting or writing - since these aspects were not the true purpose of watching the movie.  I am confident that the main reason (assuming there are other reasons) for watching this film was to see nude women.

Such was the case for selecting this film (as I suspect it is for pretty much anyone else who sees it).  I had no high expectations for any particular aspect of the film, and had read plenty of reviews which helped identify the film's limitations and shortcomings.  Further, I have helped produce some no-budget indie films and shorts, so I tend to be a little more understanding and forgiving towards movies with low production values.  I actually had an open mind and high hopes for WITCH'S SABBATH.

The film is about a strip club where Satan-worshipping exotic dancers conspire to lull there unwitting and dull-witted customers into a grisly beheading death, in order to offer the sacrifies as an unholy tithing.  Their sinister goal is to claim six hundred and sixty-six souls by the end of Halloween Eve.

That having been said, this movie just wasn't very good at all.

I will admit that I rented it not only because of the chance to see naked women (it wasn't as impressive in this film as I had hoped), but also - as strange as this may sound (and please don't get the wrong idea) - I wanted to see how the decapitation special effects were done, as these are among the most difficult effects to achieve competently, particularly where the production resources for special effects are limited, as with a small budget film like this.  I am currently working on a film that has scene which calls for a character to be beheaded, and I was hoping to get some useful insight or at least an indication of what other low-to-no budget productions were utilizing as a standard of comparison.

As it turns out also, this film did not provide much in the way of helpful information with regards to the special effects anyways (they were just using latex fake head prosthetics that bore a marginal resemblance to the castmember and pulling them off the ""victims""), AND the nudity factor was uninspiring as well.  Though I am very appreciative of the naked female body, and grateful (normally) for an opportunity to see it, the presentation of it in this film was gratuitous (a word I seldom use in association with female nudity) and yet tedious (a term I almost NEVER use in association with female nudity).  It takes a truly unimaginative and inadequate effort to accomplish that.

To sum up: the acting was subpar, but nobody who plans to see this cares anyways.  In spite of this, there was too much time given to showcase the low-grade acting through exposition and character & motive development - none of which added anything to the film and in fact turned out to be a liability which slowed the pacing.  There were topless women featured frequently, but they were not especially attractive unless you are into sluggish goth strippers who look a bit on the haggard side with too many tattoos, low-cost breast augmentation, and not enough energy or dancing ability.  The gore and special effects were mediocre, even for a fairly low-budget film.  Truthfully, the money they used to pay Ron Jeremy would have been much better spent in a number of ways towards actual production, since he really added nothing to this film (in fact, why does anybody even hire him to appear in films?)

I don't know if this movie will appeal to those who end up watching it.  I can say with confidence that those renting it will be less unhappy than those who buy it.",1188259200,5,3786,4.681749622926094

2423982,4,B000BM7Z46,"This release from Brain Damage Films has a coven of witches that run a strip club, the Sin & Skin.  These witches must obtain 666 souls and deliver them to the Dark Lord before All Hollow's Eve to insure that the witches will survive for another year.  While the film itself had its share of gore and plenty of blood spattering, they easily could have gone overboard.  Think about it - a strip club operated by a bunch of hot witches?  Led by Syn DeVil?  Body count easily could have been much higher, but this wasn't gore for the sake of gore.

Auriana (DeVil) instructs her evil beauties to chat it up with unsuspecting victims while in the club, and then give them a special invitation back to the ""house"" for a party ""they won't soon forget"".  Prior to visiting the club, Seth (Eli James) talks his girlfriend Eliza (Christine Cowden) in to going along with him and his buddy Damian (Eric Coffin).  Eliza decides she will bring along Amber (Rikki Barry) so the four can go together.

There was so much character buildup between Damian and Amber you have to wonder why??  The entire relationship seems irrelevant and nothing more than a filler for space.  However, the introduction between the two does start to reveal the mentality of Damian: the typical lonely guy whose every waking moment is spent concentrating on getting some.  The point?  Just like Damian and Amber's relationship, nothing.

Once out of the club for the night, the four friends get their invitation.  Unsure of the whole thing, they decide to check it out anyways.  Somewhere in between, the lovable Hedgehog - Ron Jeremy (playing Craven Moorehad - a bible salesman with a bible for ""every denomination"") - is sucked in to the plot when he stops at the girls' house to try and sell his wares.  You know he gets added to the body count.

Overall, this was an enjoyable flick at face value.  Plenty of skin from the beauty's (Syn's leather strap outfit is forever engraved in my brain!), plenty of bloody being splashed around with mucho beheadings.  Some of the acting didn't hit the mark, and not all of the effects did either (the thing at the end??), but its still a decent flick.",1170028800,2,2159,4.616797900262467

2423984,1,B000BM7Z46,"I don't know who wrote the first review for this movie, but some people should not be allowed to write reviews!  This movie was awful from start to finish.  It was like a very low budget porn, but with cheesy sci-fi, goth imagery in lieu of sex scenes and/or attractive people.  The ""hot"" women are average at best... their big, fake breasts are sure to tantalize anyone who has just chugged a six-pack though.
